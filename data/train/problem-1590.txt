"I don't have time for tidying. Tidying is boring," Sherlock shrugs. He looks around, then wrinkles his nose. "No room for the camp bed. You don't mind sharing, do you?"
"Shut up, you idiot," Sherlock says and it doesn't sound cruel or pissed off. "You haven't offended me. The reason Mycroft and I don't get on is because he's so serious and miserable, and I'm an arsehole so I go out of my way to wind him up. It's through my choosing."
"Come on, we'd best go down before she decides I've been murdered and calls the police," John gets up off the bed and goes down the stairs, Sherlock closely following behind.
"Thanks," John can hear the smile in Sherlock's voice. They're quiet for a little while, embracing in comfortable silence under the shower spray. Then on an impulse, John speaks up.
"You can stay, if you want," John says. Then he blushes because he realises what that must've sounded like. Sherlock chuckles.
Come to think of it, John does have vague memories of throwing the jumper at Sherlock when he had nothing else to wear to go home.
John thinks. John can't get mad or fall out with him. He's not really got many friends. In fact, as far as John knows, he's Sherlock's only proper friend. Oh, Sherlock sits with Molly Hooper when John's got detention or rugby practise over lunchtime and he talks to Greg Lestrade sometimes because they sit together in Chemistry and are both interested in going into detective work, but they're just at-school friends. His shopping plans next weekend are the first time John's heard Sherlock even mention spending time with either of them outside of school.
"I wanna stay here forever," Victor comments ducking his head to kiss Sherlock's curls, passing over their shared post-shag cigarette. Sherlock snuggles closer.
"You aren't going to tell your dad about this, are you?" John asks; he has a newfound confidence now that it comes to defending Sherlock.
"Yeah, yeah, alright," John laughs. "Go wait in the front room and pick a film, alright? I'll bring it through."
"Be mad at your brother, if you want - though I can tell a mile off it's only jealousy. I'll acknowledge his flaws. He's only human. At least he isn't a junkie. You're pathetic, Sherlock."
Each time, John's amazed at how truly scary Mycroft is; for someone so startlingly ordinary-looking, he's damn intimidating. Sherlock's never gone into the specifics of his brother's job, but John knows he's very important and very influential in the government. It shows in the way he walks and talks and acts. Speaking to him stirs up distinct memories from John's childhood of being a seven year old sitting in the headmaster's office.
Is this, he wonders, what all the cuddling all this time has been about? Is that why Sherlock held his hand earlier? Because he's got... some kind of crush on John? That causes John to panic. Oh god. Has he been giving off the wrong signals? Does Sherlock think John likes him back? Oh dear Lord, this is awkward. How the hell is he going to explain this one?
But then John's lips are back on his and any train of thought is well and truly derailed. John's belt somehow comes undone and his hands are now fumbling with the button on his jeans.
"It's just... well, I was talking to Phil Anderson after rugby practise on Saturday," John says. Sherlock is very still for a second, very quiet. Then he shrugs.
Sherlock honestly can't believe his luck. He's never had anything that resembles any form of proper relationship before, not even friends with benefits. For his first to be with someone like John - someone so kind and sweet and cheerful and friendly and damn gorgeous - well, that's a stroke of luck if ever Sherlock knew one. It's not ideal, the whole 'friends-with-benefits' situation. Not exactly what Sherlock wanted, but its better than nothing and he'll take all he can get on that front. He loves kissing already, despite his lack of experience. But he panicked when John tried for flesh-on-flesh contact. He's never been that intimate with anyone before. In fact, before kissing John, he's never been more intimate than cuddling or holding hands. John's had more than his fair share of experience; being as good-looking as he is, as well as a nice guy and captain of the rugby team, he's generally got girls (and guys, come to that) falling over each other for his attention, though he doesn't seem to notice.  John could have his pick of any of the girls and most of the guys at school. And he's picked
"I thought he was more interested in me than he was," he says, limply. "I misread signals. It was a misunderstanding."
"Hey, dreamer. Get over here," John's soft voice interrupts his thoughts. Sherlock turns to see John sitting on the edge of his bed, patting the space next to him. Sherlock cautiously moves over and perches beside the blond, who takes his good hand, rubbing his thumb over Sherlock's knuckles. The taller boy swallows and bites his lip, watching the trail of John's digits over his hand. John's other hand comes up under his chin and gently lifts his head until they're looking each other in the eyes. "You alright?"
"Well you're hardly in a rush to defend me," Sherlock mutters it, but Vic hears and he squeezes Sherlock's shoulders apologetically.
He drives to the old abandoned hunting cabin, down near the lake. They used to meet here to rendezvous in secret - when neither one's house was empty and they couldn't bare to be apart for any longer. It's become overrun by moss and weeds and it's bitterly cold even inside in the winter. That never mattered to them. They had plenty of ways to keep each other warm.
"Uh, yeah, please, I um..." John indicates the cans underneath his arm. Mike leads him through into the kitchen, where he's handed a glass with a flourish and left alone while Mike goes off to host. No sooner has he emptied the first can does someone tap him on the shoulder. He turns to see Molly Hooper, a mousey-haired, sweet-natured girl who he knows Sherlock sits beside when he bothers to turn up to his Biology classes. He's a sneaking suspicion that Molly's something of a crush on his friend, and her question only confirms that.
"Well, you're not a complete idiot," still in that monotone. "Use your better judgement and decide what to believe."
"Oh," John repeats. There's a long silence between them while he gives Sherlock a long up and down look. Things are ticking away in his head. Bruises on his neck from an on and off boyfriend who just 'got a little bit too excited'. He isn't stupid. People have kinks, and maybe this is theirs. But why would Jim be a secret. John bites his lip.
up the attention, his eyes fixated on her abundant chest. Every so often they flicker up to her face and he fakes a smile, pretending he's actually listening. All in all, it's a sickening display and Sherlock's almost outraged that they've dared to drag it into his safe space. He doesn't even wrench his eyes away when Anderson leaves with a wink and a waggle of fingers and a promise to
John's in luck, though, and Sherlock doesn't appear to be at school that day. It's not unusual, really; Sherlock often skips the lessons he deems 'boring', which is the majority of them. Still, John's worried that Sherlock is upset or offended and it's his fault. That's the last thing he wants. He shrouds it well under a mask of indifference, but Sherlock's a wreck and John knows it. He doesn't want to cause his friend any more emotional grief. He just wants him to be happy. That's what the kiss was about, he tells himself. He just wanted to make Sherlock feel better. Make him happy, like he said he feels when he's with John. It wasn't because John's
He does it a lot, when he needs to clear his head. Walks around the park about half a mile from his house and smokes a lot. It's probably not safe, but he can run fast and fight well if it comes to it, so he's not too afraid. Besides, he's never need to run from or fight with anybody so statistically, he can safely assume he's going to be okay. It's not like it's a bad neighbourhood or anything. He's not worried.
decision to send me there, not mine," Sherlock points out. "Besides which, if I was going to get into trouble for it, I'm sure it would've happened a long time before now."
"Yes, well, thank you for the rare concern about my health, but you're actually about three years too late for that," Sherlock shrugs.
He abuses the accelerator and brakes too hard and John is hanging on for dear life by the time they reach Cedarstreet High School, muttering a string of curses under his breath. Sherlock laughs at him.
"The party doesn't start until seven. Shops shut at half five at latest," John points out. "You have no excuse except you're an anti-social bastard. Come on. Please? For me?"
It was colder out tonight than John had initially realised; the sky had been clear when he left the house, and so he assumed the weather would be mild at best. He’s only wearing a jumper, no jacket on top. Without a word, Sherlock shrugs off his own coat and drapes it around John’s shoulders.
"A guy I know," Sherlock is being deliberately vague, John can tell. He doesn't press any further, for fear of frustration. After a pause, Sherlock continues. "Besides which, Victor Trevor will be there."
"Listen, Sherly," Phil steps up, and they're nose to nose. "If you're a queer that's all fine and dandy, but you might want to leave Vic
That warm, soft smell like  toast and the tumble-dryer and soap. The smell of security and home. And he
"I just told you, I saw it," Sherlock's annoyed - he so hates repeating himself. "Feel free to take the chair."
"Right okay," Lestrade holds his hands up. Sherlock skulks in here enough that Lestrade knows not to push him when he doesn't want to talk. "But if you ever decide you
"I dunno, nothing else on I suppose. I can change it if you want, or we can put a film on?" John says, but Sherlock waves a dismissive hand.
"I'm sorry, Shez," Sherlock feels the warm weight of full lips on top of his head. "I've told them they're being unnecessarily cruel, that they should back off a bit. I got a bit of stick for it, but I think they listened. I hate seeing you upset."
A group of fourth-years pass by them, a gaggle of girls. They giggle as they get near, all of them nudging each other and stealing glances at the boy at his side and for a second John thinks they're swooning. Then one calls out to him
"The Bond series are classic cinema," John says, defensively. "But no, if you're that adamant, we'll watch a movie of
across Sherlock's face. It was only a split second, but he looked sad and scared and angry and vulnerable all at once. John doesn't want to push him - not yet anyway - but at the same time he's dying to know what went on that's caused Sherlock to have so much disdain for a bloke he was obviously keen on once upon a time. Sherlock himself is talking at speed about taxonomic classification, obviously desperate to get the conversation as far as humanly possible away from Victor Trevor.
"Plans with who?" John is confused. Sherlock doesn't have any other friends at school, and he's not mentioned any outside.
"I'm starting to understand the whole 'piss off' thing, you know," John says, but he's grinning. "How did you
"You have a gorgeous laugh," Sherlock comments, briefly releasing John's hand to light up a cigarette. John's cheeks get warm and he realises he's blushing.
It's with that thought in mind that Sherlock takes out his phone and dials the only number he knows by heart.
sexually attractive. He readily critisizes John's taste in women (though that's probably just so he can be a contrary prick) but has never stated any preference himself. Realizing they're all still staring at him for an answer John just shrugs. "I dunno. I mean... he's pretty much asexual as far as I know."
He goes to put his hand on Victor's arm, only to be punched in the jaw so hard he stumbles back a couple of steps.
"Look, I do not fancy Sherlock Holmes, alright?" John said, starting to get pissed off now. "I'm straight, and nobody is going to change that. Not Sherlock or anybody else."
They get twenty minutes into Lost Boys before they lose interest in it and get interested in each other instead. They're a tangle of lips and limbs and sheets for a long while and somewhere in that time they both end up in their boxers. Sherlock starts to get nervous then, especially as John's hands trail further down his chest and stomach. When they reach his crotch, Sherlock gasps and pulls away. John's hands fly away from Sherlock's body as if his skin is white hot.
When they eventually get downstairs, John calls up their Chinese place and they cuddle on the couch, Sherlock's head resting in John's lap. He bridges his fingers just under his nose and flutters his eyes shut, muttering for John to "let him think". The smaller boy is more than happy to do so, just watching something silly on the television, playing absent-mindedly with a stray curl near Sherlock's ear. Its some stupid reality show in the telly, the kind of thing that Sherlock moans endlessly about. John usually agrees, but now he finds himself enthralled. So much so that he doesn't notice that Sherlock's opened his eyes and is watching him. He's startled when the dark haired boy takes his hand, stroking his fingers gently.
"Trust me mate. Sherlock is," he says. "You know my mate Vic, don't you? Victor Trevor? Sciencey bloke, always wearing that leather jacket? He was like you once. Tried to be nice to old Sherly, tried to be his friend. Thought it was 'unfair' that people were 'unnecessarily cruel' to him. And you know what happened? Sherly tried to get in his pants, even after he'd made it obvious he wasn't interested. He's a sicko, John, trust me. You're better off away from him."
Sherlock gets his phone out but his father knocks it out of his hand. Sherlock doesn't have time to protest it much before he's dealt a sharp slap so hard it jerks his head to the side and makes him stagger back a step. He stands rooted to the spot. The whole left side of his face burns and he wants to rub his cheek to soothe it, but refuses to give his father that kind of satisfaction. He doesn't lift his hand, doesn't move at all. He waits for his dad to make the next move, expecting another slap or a punch. What he does get is much, much more painful.
"Sherlock," John sighs. "Don't be daft. Look, it's your first time. You're bound to be nervous. If it's any consolotion, it's my first time with a bloke. I'm nervous too. I'm not disappointed. I'm totally happy to go at whatever speed feels right for you, alright? Just let it all come naturally."
it, but it's John's favourite and to be honest the idea of sharing a carton of ice cream with John really appeals to Sherlock.
"Mycroft's a twat," Sherlock says simply. "Open the window." It's advice rather than a request, John realises as Sherlock brings out a cigarette and brings it up to his lips. John grumbles about it but obliges, cracking the bedroom window open.
"Fuck, Shez," it's more a strangled moan than an actual statement, as both of them are down to their boxers.
"It's fine," Sherlock smiles. "There are other ways to keep warm besides than the boiler, you know."
When Sherlock goes to grab another book from a shelf, a shadow is cast over John's Chemistry notes. He looks up to see a guy he vaguely knows from Biology class. He's conventionally handsome, all smooth olive skin and big brown eyes and springy black hair and strong jaw bone. He's generally got a gaggle of girls not far behind him and is friends with some of the guys John is on the rugby team with. His name is V-something, some typical posh person name that John can't quite recall. Vincent or Virgil or something.
"Thank you," Molly pats her newly-coiffed hair, a small self-conscious smile finding it's way onto her face. But not before a flash of disappointment. Sherlock was right - John isn't a total idiot. She's clearly gotten herself all prettied up in hopes that she'd catch Sherlock's eye tonight. Still, she goes out of her way to make conversation with John, and the two are quite companionable for most of the evening.
"Well I came for the chair but that was..." the boy looks startled and confused and.. impressed. "How d'you do that?"
The second they realised Mycroft had entered  the room, John had pulled his top back on and fastened his jeans, mumbling apologies. Sherlock didn't. He folded his arms defiantly and refused to put his shirt on again. He's still refusing now, sitting next to John on the sofa. Mycroft is standing in front of them, half-full whiskey glass in hand, leaning against the mantlepiece. John half-expected to be read the riot act. But Mycroft is silent, as if he's contemplating what he's just seen. The quiet is worse than any lecture they could be given. Sherlock doesn't seem at all bothered on the surface; he's examining his fingernails as if he hasn't got a care in the world. But he won't look at John and he keeps biting his lip. He's just as nervous as John is.
"Got quite chatty with one bloke," he says, tactfully. Mum would have a fit of hysterics if she knew people had been unpleasant to her John.
Sherlock grins at him then goes through into the living room. John hears him opening the DVD cabinet and rifling through the discs. He hopes to hell he won't pick something boring - that would be such a Sherlock trick. Pick something totally opposite to an action film just to get on John's nerves. John busies himself making drinks - tea for him, hot chocolate for Sherlock. He takes both mugs through to the living room and sets them down on the coffee table. Sherlock is curled up on one corner of the sofa, and John sits next to him and sees that he's picked
"She's a little witch," he mutters, more to himself  than anything, and Sherlock laughs, blowing out a smoke ring.
"You alright, mate?" he asks, gently, and Sherlock lets out a long sigh, closing his eyes. He shakes his head, and John shifts his weight from foot to foot. "Right. Sorry. Stupid question. Uh... d'you want a cup of tea?"
John's parents couldn't make it, but that didn't really phase him. They often can't make his matches; they both need to work weekends to make ends meet. Sherlock was there though; he makes a point of being at every match, though he barely understands the game at all. He stood in his usual place on the sidelines, Harry faithfully at his side, the two of them wearing scarves in the team's colours. She doesn't understand the game any more than Sherlock does, but they've taken it upon themselves to cheer John on any time he gets remotely near the ball and it honestly gives him the morale boost that he needs when his team is losing hard.
Somewhere along the line, Sherlock has ended up with a lap-full of Jim, anchoring him in place with arms around his waist, their lips locked together. They also appear to have both lost their shirts at some point, and Jim's nails up and down the length of his back are doing absolutely
"Why?" John wrinkles his nose. He's only met Sherlock's parents once. His mother is one of those women who spends a fortune on makeup to hide her age and swishes her way through life with a sweep of a scarf and a jangle of bracelets and the flash of a credit card. She's very eccentric in a
"You've had that fag lit for nearly five minutes now and you're just letting it burn out," John points out.  "You never light cigs without smoking them. Something's bothering you. What is it?"
looking. This car looks like it's had a number of previous owners who didn't treat it so well. There are tears in the seats, mended by duct-tape, and a fraying, faded rainbow-patchwork blanket on the back seat. There are several of those tree-shaped air fresheners hanging from the rear-view mirror and, most amusing to John, a hula dancer in a grass skirt swaying her hips on the dashboard.
"I don't believe it," John shakes his head. "You don't misread signals - and even if you did, you'd never admit to it."
He expects a cock-sure agreement or something about being too emotional. But instead, he gets an ear-to-ear grin and a genuine-sounding
It's the class that's boring. The teacher is tedious, the pupils are worse and the course content is positively
"Leave him," the elder Holmes advises. "You know what he's like when he's sulking. He'll want to be alone for a while."
"What did you say to them this time, anyway?" John asks, as they wait by the curb for a cab with its light on. Sherlock smirks.
"Don't be sad about it, Shez," Vic says, as if the pause never happened. "Just give it a bit, we can be together properly. When we go to Uni, get out of here. Away from my dad and my mates."
It isn't the first time John's had that thought in the past twenty four months. Sherlock's got this annoying habit of pissing off people he really shouldn't, and one of those people is Charlie Magnussen. He's in the school year above them and he knows everything about everyone and is notorious for blackmailing people into doing his dirty work. Thing is, Sherlock knows everything about everyone too and Magnussen doesn't like to be challenged. He himself is a scrawny, speccy git, and John reckons one-on-one neither he or Sherlock would have a problem taking him on. But Magnussen never fights one-on-one. He's got a pack of mindless hard-knocks who he pays to do that for him, and John and Sherlock have to run to avoid getting their heads kicked in. So they're running now, Sherlock's leather boots and John's old holey trainers splashing through puddles, the pair of them utterly saturated with the pouring rain.
It was so casual, he probably didn't even think about it but Sherlock can't help realising that nobody, aside from Lestrade, has called him
Its different from the kind of kissing they've grown accoustomed too. Usually the kisses are long and slow and gentle but this is fast and heavy and passionate and animalistic. Sherlock doesn't exactly hate it. This time, he lets John's hands go up his top and grope, does the same himself, uses his fingers to trace the bumps of John's spine, the arch of his shoulders, the taughtness of his chest.
He pulls into school just as the morning bell is ringing. He retrieves his bag from the boot and heads straight for the library without even bothering to check which lesson he's supposed to be at.
"Victor Trevor is, to put it bluntly, an almighty cunt and I'd rather spend as little time in his presence as possible," it mostly sounds completely matter-of-fact, except for the place in the middle where Sherlock's voice hitches.
The first thing John saw when he turned around was Sherlock, well within earshot, smirking at him with a mischevous glint in his eye.
Sherlock calls at his retreating back, but the librarian just keeps walking towards his office. Sherlock sighs deeply, but elects not to protest to much. After all, he really
"You're a dirty liar, Sherlock Holmes," he mock-scolds, and that's one of the things about him that's so brilliant. Nobody else can read Sherlock like he can, nobody else
"I am so regretting complimenting your ego," he says, shoving his rugby boots into his bag and sticking his feet into his ordinary trainers. He hops to his feet and holds his hand out to Sherlock. "Come on then, Mr Fantastic. Mum and Dad are away 'til Sunday and Harry's on a school trip to Paris. I've got the house to myself all weekend - you can stay over if you want."
There's a downside to being in the house by himself, though. He's left alone with his thoughts and, though most bad things are instantly deleted from the mind palace, some of them worm their way through when he has a rare and brief lapse in concentration. Within the past sixth months, Sherlock's become hyper-aware of how ostracised he is by his peers. It wouldn't usually bother him. He's never had friends, not really. Molly tags around with him sometimes, and sometimes he's grateful for her company. She's clever enough that she can hold at least a half-decent conversation, and she has a no-bullshit type of view on life, which Sherlock admires even if he doesn't admit it. But they're just at-school-acquaintances. They're not
"I've got just the thing. Be back in a second, honey," Jim winks at him and leaves the room. Sherlock hears him rummaging around somewhere else in the house. He returns a couple of minutes of later with a small baggy of white powder. He dangles it temptingly between his thumb and forefinger. "Got this just yesterday. Thought of you, actually. Peruvian. About as pure as it gets. This is good shit, honey."
"I had a good doctor," Sherlock replies, beding to press a small kiss against John's temple. "Thanks for bandaging it for me, love. It'd never have gotten better if it wasn't for you."
"Fine, if you promise not to tell Mum and Dad. Just go, please," John rubs the space between his eyebrows and Harry looks satisfied, turning and heading back up the stairs. John waits until he hears her go along the landing and back to her bedroom. Then he turns back to Sherlock, and they smile awkwardly at each other.
"C'mon. Let's go up to my room. It's more comfortable," he whispers. Sherlock nods, following John up the stairs and along the landing to his bedroom.
he's practically begging for Sherlock to fall for him. But God damn it all, he won't let that happen again. What's the point of falling in love when he himself is so damn unloveable? What's the point of falling in love when you're only gonna get hurt in the long run?
"No," is the sharp reply. Vic's not usually short with Sherlock, but he figures it's the drink talking and tuts.
"It's complicated," he says, groaning at the impossibility of ever explaining friends with benefits to an 11-year-old.
"You're gonna be an excellent doctor one day," he says, softly. John grins back, and takes Sherlock's good hand in his own.
cocksure. He's an okay player - nothing brilliant - but he seems to think he's Jonny Wilkinson. He has a level of arrogance that matches Sherlock's, but on Anderson it comes off as cruel. He talks down to everyone, even his little tag-along Seb Wilkes, who doesn't really say a lot but jumps whenever Anderson tells him too like a loyal little flying monkey. Anderson's yet to say anything to John outside of
"Sorry, can I just steal this chair?" a male voice cuts through Sherlock's studies, startles him a little.
John's mum's voice comes up the stairs, causing the two boys to pull apart. They're both flashed and breathing heavily, Sherlock's hair ruffled from John's tugging hands. John laughs at that and uses his fingers to flatten it down (or to the extent that Sherlock's hair
"If you're just friends, why do you kiss him?" she wants to know, and John rubs the bridge of his nose.
Because that's all it is. Confidence. He's scared he won't be good enough for John, the way he's never good enough for anyone else. But John was just as eager as Sherlock with the kissing. Just as hungry and desperate for it. He seems to be just as interested in Sherlock as Sherlock is in him. Sherlock finds himself grinning like a loon at the thought of John. The callouses on his palms and the pads of his fingers, the smoothness of the skin on his arms and neck, the silkiness of his hair, the firmness of his muscles, the strength of his arms around Sherlock's waist. And his
"No I... I have to go. I'll see you at school on Monday, yeah?" he starts to walk out of the room and Sherlock follows, pulling a pair of jeans on as he does so.
"That or you wanted to stare at Leonardo DiCaprio for two and a half hours," John teases, and Sherlock smirks.
"For heaven's sake John, it's not what it looks like," Sherlock bats his hands away. John reluctantly steps back.
"Come to Sally's party with me tomorrow," he says, and Sherlock's grip on him becomes slack. "Come on. It's not like she'll
"Of course I have to," John says. "What kind of best mate would I be if I let you get your arse kicked by yourself, eh? Friends don't let friends do stupid things alone, Sherlock."
"Ms Heath, is there an issue?" the voice of Mr Lestrade, the school librarian, startles the dyed-redhead into turning around. She smiles in that simpering, sickening way that she does to all conventionally attractive men.
"Are you implying I'm a slut?" she sounds shocked, as if the suggestion is simply ludicrous. Sherlock shrugs.
"He gets really pissed off with me any time I ask him about you," he says. Vic smiles humourlessly there.
It makes sense now John thinks about it. This is such a typically Sherlock-y thing to do. Try to prove John wrong, because God forbid John should ever be
"I'm confused as to why you didn't let me do this last time," John whispers, leaning forwards until their lips touch.
The outburst has frightened John, who is unused to seeing his new friend so animated and emotional. After a second, Sherlock regains his composure and picks his paper up again without a word. There's an uncomfortable, unsettling silence that stretches between them, one John is wholly unaccustomed to.
is, and that's not something he wants to have consider. He doesn't particularly want to have a boyfriend, not yet. Not until he's figured out his feelings. He clears his throat. "Friends with benefits?"
"Oh, just get out of my sight," their father snarls, and for once, Sherlock is glad of his brother's presence. No doubt some kind of argument would've ensued if their father wasn't so eager for boring politics talk with Mycroft. He strides off, up the stairs and into the bathroom. He remembers John's warning about not showering to keep the dressing dry, and grumbles as he drops the plug in the bath and turns on the hot tap. He hates baths - he's far too impatient to wait for it to fill. Showers are quick, easy. Baths mean waiting and waiting is boring. If anyone else had said it, Sherlock would probably go ahead and shower anyway, but John's pretty wised up on medical stuff. He wouldn't tell Sherlock to bathe instead if it wasn't absolutely necessary. He trusts John.
Certainly, Sherlock finds little comfort from his elder brother, Mycroft. They've never gotten along, even as children. Sherlock was wild, adventurous, curious, always digging holes in the garden and climbing trees and usually ending up with some sort of injury. Mycroft was more reserved, more quiet. They remained much the same into their older years. Mycroft became a cold, distant man, where Sherlock became - and he's the first to admit it - a contrary arsehole. There's no common ground between them, no shared interests. And no affection. They shake hands on odd occasion but Sherlock can only remember twice in his entire life that Mycroft has hugged him. The first was at their parents' funeral. The second... Sherlock doesn't like to think about, is trying desperately to delete it from his mind palace.
"Is that a yes?" John says against his skin and fuck, if the vibration of the sound doesn't feel amazing. Sherlock breathes out heavily.
"Piss off," Sherlock shrugs one shoulder, and the boy laughs. It's a nice sound. Warm and pleasant, like bells.
"Uh... yeah, if you don't mind," he says. Clearly it's not something Sherlock is comfortable talking about. But John saw the flash of
Sherlock gladly staggers inside the dingy little house, collapses as soon as he's in the front room. It's got a threadbare sofa and a worn old armchair and is thankfully devoid of junkies passed out on the floor for tonight. Jim stands in the doorway, regards him for a couple of seconds before he walks over, cradles Sherlock's face, turns it this way and that to examine it. When Sherlock winces, he tuts.
"Yeah, him," he shrugged. "Are you and he... are you like... boyfriends? 'Cause I don't mind if you are... y'know... gay... but Sally reckons he's a bit..."
of sensible shoes on the wooden stairs, then across the landing. Mycroft knocks once on the door then pushes it open.
"Shame, that. It'd do him well to get out and talk to people, I think," he says. "Still, I wasn't holding my breath for him coming. He's hardly your social butterfly, is he? Can I get you a drink?"
"Um... no. Sorry," Sherlock says, giving John's hand an apologetic squeeze. "I was miles away. What were you saying?"
"It's an adrenaline kick, if nothing else," Sherlock shrugs. "And anyway, you could always leave me. You don't
"Caring isn't an advantage, Sherlock," he mutters it out loud to himself. Even as he's saying it, he's typing out a message to John.
Sherlock sits in his car for almost half an hour before he plucks up the courage to drive to his destination.
"Mm," Phil clearly wasn't listening to him. "Listen, John. You've been spending a lot of time around Sherlock Holmes, haven't you?"
Suddenly, John's hand is grabbed and yanked so hard he feels as if his shoulder is being pulled out of its socket. He stumbles into an alleyway, and a hand he recognizes as Sherlock's falls over his mouth with a hurried
"He seems alright," John shrugs. "Bit strange, but really clever. Sharp-witted, you know? And friendly enough.  He took me to my classroom when I got lost."
"You want to know if I'm going out with Sherlock Holmes?" John repeated it. "Of course I'm bloody not."
He looks angelic in the dwindling sunlight. His tanned skin takes on a golden glow that is almost otherworldly, and his hair gleams like polished ebony. And his eyes. Oh, those eyes. They were the first thing Sherlock fell for, those big, doe eyes, so dark you almost can't tell iris from pupil. But they're warm with it too - he's only seventeen, and already he has permanent crinkles from smiling so many times. Cheery, bubbly, happy Vic. Everybody's mate. Always smiling. Except he isn't smiling now. Now he's watching Sherlock with an achingly pretty expression of frightened earnest.
"Don't," Sherlock cuts him off, and he can't stop the way his voice catches in his throat. "Don't you fucking
It's more home to him than his house is. He's been an avid reader since he can remember, and surrounding himself with books is one of few technically legal ways he can find comfort. He'll read anything. Fiction. Non-fiction. Classics. Modern. Horror, thriller, sci-fi, fantasy, true crime, action, even the odd romance. Those, he reads because they remind him of his mum. For Dad, he reads books about sports, a subject that he has no interest in whatsoever. Sometimes, when he's down and can't get hold of any good stuff, he'll thumb his way through some tedious romance novel or the autobiography of some asinine football player until he can almost hear Mum or Dad reading it to him and he feels a little bit better again.
Sherlock likes John's bedroom more than his own, always has. John complains that it's too small, but Sherlock thinks it's perfect. Cosy and comfortable - his own feels far too big, even with the black walls and carpet. John's is the same blue he chose when he was eight, though he's pulled down the embarrassing dinosaur border that used to run round the room. The carpet used to be blue too, but it's faded over the years to a sort of sludge-grey. The room is much neater than Sherlock's, though it'd be hard to be less so. There are posters pinned up around the room, of bands and movies that John likes and England's rugby team and Muhammed Ali in his heyday. There's a world map too and a few pictures of John and friends (there's several which include Sherlock, which gives him a little swell of pride).
These feelings he's been having for John are weird, and Sherlock doesn't really know what to do about them. He's not very good at emotions and sentiment. So he did what he does best and researched it. Apparently he's supposed to test the feelings out, see if John feels the same. That's comfort. It makes it feel more... scientific. Like an experiment. The cuddling was a happy coincidence, something that's been happening more or less since they became friends, though Sherlock has been pressing closer and squeezing tighter recently, and John doesn't seem to have any qualms. He was startled by the hand-holding, Sherlock noticed almost straight away, but he didn't let go or even loosen his grip, though he wiggled his fingers. He also let Sherlock keep his jumper, which is a promising sign. The kiss was supposed to be Sherlock's biggest move, but he chickened out at the last minute. He was scared. He's never kissed anyone before John, so he wasn't really entirely sure what to expect, but the internet said that John should press his lips back against Sherlock's and melt into his arms and just relax into it. But he didn't. He tensed up under Sherlock's forearms and he didn't push his lips against Sherlock's. He did the opposite; his head jerked back ever so slightly and that was Sherlock's cue to pull away. He didn't talk about it afterwards. Just pretended it never happened. He thought John was mad at him, but he felt gentle, calloused fingers on his skin late in the night. It didn't make him any less unsure.
"Well even if I was, it wouldn't matter to me if you 'minded' or not," John said. "But that's beside the point. I'm straight."
"Of course," John beams back. "Come on, we'll watch a film in my room. It'll be loads warmer underneath the duvet."
In the ten years that have passed since their games stopped, Mycroft and Sherlock have grown so far apart nobody would ever think they were brothers. Sherlock's grown to resent Mycroft, and he'll begrudgingly admit its mostly based on jealousy. He's tried his whole life to get his father's approval, to get some kind of affection, a smile or an 'I'm proud of you' or an 'I love you'. He's never got any of the those, despite his efforts, despite his work. And yet Mycroft gets them in ambundance, without having to put any effort into it at all. Sherlock's sure his father goes out of his way to say it to Mycroft when he's in the room, make Sherlock even more jealous than he was before. And it works.
With a shaky hand, Sherlock wipes the dampness away from his cheeks and closes the message thread.  John really isn't making it easy to not get emotionally attached. With his silly
"Who the hell is Jim?" John's nose crinkles. Sherlock's never mentioned a Jim to him before - and clearly he didn't intend to do it now. John can see him cursing himself in his head. After a couple of seconds, he clears his throat.
"Like I said. Misread signals," Sherlock lies. "Picked up on some wrong vibes, clearly. Won't happen again."
"I..." he was about to say of course not, but he stopped himself. Come to think of it, he's not really sure of Sherlock's sexuality. He often teases his friend about fancying male actors and singers, but Sherlock is yet to confirm or deny whether he does or not. Actually, he's never known Sherlock say he finds
As soon as he enters the house, he's engulfed by two strong, slightly sweaty arms and greeted with a familiar, grinning face. Mike Stamford is a talkative, slightly plump boy with a cracking sense of humour and not a bad word to say about anybody. He's one of a few people John is truly glad to have met; they got talking when seated next to each other in History, where they discovered they both had intentions to become doctors later in life. He's everybody's mate, and the party shows it; there's barely room to breathe in the lounge, lest you bump into the person next to you.
"Okay. Alright ," John says, turning his eyes back to his worksheet. It's only then that he notices that Sherlock hasn't even got his pen or his book out. John looks at him, confused. Sherlock always at least
"Crystal," John replies, and he's a little offended. He'd never dream of doing anything to hurt Sherlock. If Mycroft knew anything about them, he'd know that. John bites his lip. "I think I should go. Tell Sherlock I said I'll see him tomorrow, won't you?"
John's ringtone cuts through his sleep. With a groan, he rolls over and blinks at the glowing red digits on his alarm clock.
"Why?" John's nose wrinkles in confusion. He gets that not many people like Sherlock, but he assumes that's because he's a pompous, arrogant prick who goes out of his way to make people not like him. What difference does it make to Anderson if one person in the hundreds at school wants to spend time with Sherlock?
"Does he have to have done anything? He's a twat every time he breathes," Sherlock mutters, taking a drag. Realising John's still staring at him he sighs. "He found... stuff in my room. Told our parents."
"Maybe he overslept," he suggests and, when Greg looks unsure he adds "Or maybe that death-trap car of his has finally given up the ghost."
Once upon a time, when they were kids, Mycroft and Sherlock had been friends. The elder was expressly forbade to play with his little brother, but he obviously decided this was grossly unfair. It's the only time Sherlock's ever known Mycroft go against their fathers wishes. He'd sneak into Sherlock's room after their Mum and Dad had gone to bed with an armful of toys or an idea for a fantastic new pretend game they could play. They had to be careful not to wake their parents, so they spoke in whispers and crept around the room on tiptoe, but to Sherlock, it was magical. Mycroft would generally stay until long after midnight, when Sherlock would start to get tired and rub his eyes. Then Mycroft would tuck him in and tell him a story. Sometimes he read them out of books, but he mostly made them up himself. They all had one recurring character; Captain Sherlock, the bravest, scariest, most respected pirate in the world. He dug up many a treasure chest and had lots of exciting adventures. Sherlock always fell asleep before the story was finished, and when he woke up in the morning, there was no sign that Mycroft had been in the room at all.
"It's no problem," John settles against the skinny boy's shoulder. His hand rests on Sherlock's chest, fingers strumming against his sternum gently. They cuddle in the quiet for a while, the only interruption the soft buzz of
As cold as it is outside, the heating has been on in Sherlock’s house all day and as a consequence, it’s so hot Sherlock’s starting to sweat. Without really thinking about what he’s doing, he pushes the sleeves of his –
John takes the two steaming mugs into the front room and sets one in front of Sherlock. The taller boy immediately picks it up, nursing it in his icy fingers, desperately trying to draw some warmth into them. John sits beside him somewhat awkwardly and pats his arm.
"Um... no," John says. He doesn't know why he hesitates; he and Sherlock have shared a bed plenty of times. Hell, they share a bed every time Sherlock stays at John's because there's no spare bed. Maybe it's because of the hand holding. Or maybe its because of the conversation they had before dinner. Either way, John feels strange about sharing a bed with Sherlock tongiht. Not uncomfortable. But... off.
believe it. And they've known Sherlock for a hell of a lot longer than he has. Maybe he's a dark side that John is yet to see.
Sherlock waltzes into their shared Maths class, last lesson, twenty minutes late. The teacher raises his eyebrows but Sherlock mutters something which he obviously accepts, because he waves the brunette to his seat at the back of the class. He slots in beside John and smiles.
"I'm sure if I wanted to 'get a man' I would be perfectly capable, thank you, Amelia," he swaps out the chemistry notes for the biology ones. "As it is, I'm perfectly content with my own company."
"I know the things people say, John. But Sherlock isn't a bad person," he says, instead of answering the question. "He really isn't. He's just a bit... mixed up. Not his fault, poor sod, he's had a rough time of it with his family life. He doesn't know how to do emotions, never has. I know he hides it well but he's so...
"Of course you did. Because you're bloody brilliant," John says, and Sherlock agrees. John's about to call him a pompous twat, when a confused looking Harry approaches the car. John's nervous all of a sudden - what if she hates Sherlock and it makes things awkward? But he needn't be. The second she gets in the back seat, he starts talking to her as if he was just a normal person, a regular old friend of John's, and they get along spectacularly.
"I don't care about him," he says, blowing out smoke rings. Then he pauses. "But it... it upsets Mum."
"Okay, then. Let's go to yours," he says, allowing Sherlock to lead the way. It's a longer walk from school to Sherlock's house but that's okay. It means John gets to hold his hand for longer and there is, admittedly, something alluring about watching Sherlock's breath on the air every time he speaks. He's speaking a lot, on one of his usual rants about how everyone at school is an idiot, especially their lowerclassmen, and how he shouldn't have to share corridors or valuable air with them.
Mycroft gave him an allowance to buy a car when he passed his test, offered him several suggestions of shiny, sleek, foreign things that go unnecessarily fast. Much like the car Mycroft himself drives. Sherlock supposes he was supposed to be keeping up appearances, helping his brother maintain his reputation. Which is why he instead opted for a secondhand Vauxhall estate which was probably blue once upon a time, but has been faded by time and sun to a murky greyish colour. There are tears in the upholstery which Sherlock has repaired with duct tape and concealed with an old fraying rug he found at a car boot sale years ago. Mycroft hates the thing and, for that reason, Sherlock loves it all the more.
"But there's no way to do it without them suspecting something's happening," Sherlock says curtly. "I know."
By Thursday, they've got it to a tee; they share glances and smiles all day at school, and they have lots of 'accidental' brushes on hand-on-hand in lessons where they sit together. At the end of the day, they go to John's house and snog on John's bed or the sofa until Harry gets home from school. Keeping her quiet is easier than John had anticipated; she's usually notorious for blackmailing him into doing what she wants him too. But she's suprisingly easy about this, her only demand being that John helps out with her Maths homework. Sherlock generally stays until well into the evening when John (and often Harry) will walk him to the park.
"Just... thinking," Sherlock says, trying to shake off the subject. John is, as usual, sympathetic enough to know not to push too far. Instead he changes the subject.
For a second, John is kicking himself - he thinks that Vic will be as touchy about the subject as Sherlock is. But to his surprise, Victor laughed.
"I think 'amazing' was the word you used at break time," Sherlock grins and, despite the over-confidence and cocksure nature of it, John can't help grinning with him.
"What? I don't under-" Sherlock doesn't even get his full sentence out before Philip Anderson and Sebastian Wilkes emerge from the bushes that Victor came from. They've all been drinking, clearly, but Victor's by far the worst off.
"You know what happened then," he says, his voice just a fraction quieter and a fraction softer and a fraction sadder than usual.
"But I can't hate my own father?" Sherlock guesses. Then he scoffs. "Mycroft said the exact same. But I do, truly. This isn't teenage hormones or whatever, John. I hate him. It's alright, he hates me too. Tells me at least once a day, when he's around. He hates me because I'm not perfect like Mycroft. I'm nothing he wanted me to be. I'm not the child he wanted."
"I didn't say that," Vic sighs. "I just... I've gotta go, Shez. Clear my head. I'll see you on Monday, honey, alright?"
Sherlock ignores him, lays back on the black leather couch he's claimed as his and arches his fingers under his nose, closing his eyes. It's a sign for Lestrade to leave Sherlock to his thoughts, which he does after around half a minute.
"Let's go to my room," he mumbles, biting John's lip gently. The blond nods and they stand, still kissing, and Sherlock backs John towards the door.
"Thank you," Sherlock buries his head in John's neck to hide his blush and John laughs, stroking Sherlock's hair.
He's the last to leave the changing rooms, scraping the mud out of his boots because he has this new bag and his mum will go bananas if he gets it all muddy. He hears the door open and close behind him, and someone steps into the room behind him. He freezes, until he hears that familiar voice behind him.
"I know. But I... I..." Sherlock swallows, then shrugs. "I feel like I'm disappointing you. I mean... I just... you've done all this before, and I know other people  - all those girls - they're more... they're... not as nervous as I am."
"Harry, shut up," John groans. "I'm not gay. And Sherlock isn't my boyfriend. We're just... we're just friends."
"Oh my -" John takes a deep breath. "Look, Harry. If you go to bed and stop asking questions, I'll buy you a bag of fizzy cola bottles on the way to school."
Sherlock Holmes does not form emotional attachments. He has to remind himself of that. It's unnecessary, getting involved in people. Distracts the mind from things that are more important. Besides which, when you're Sherlock, it'll probably end up badly for you. He certainly learned
John waits until Sherlock has vanished past the end of the street before he shuts the door and goes to bed himself.
"Is Sherlock your boyfriend now?" Harry's been babbling on since they left the park and John's doing pretty well at ignoring her. "Hey, does this mean you're gay? Do I have a gay brother? This is awesome. Does it mean you're gonna come shopping with me and stuff?"
They burst into peals of laughter, like it's the funniest thing any of them have ever heard. Sherlock bristles but keeps walking. John feels his nose crinkle in confusion.
"He likes me," Sherlock has to say it out loud, just so he can hear it . And that makes his smile even wider.
His back is pressed against the wall, the damp, pebbly surface scratching his back through his jumper. From their place in the shadows, they can clearly see the orange-lit street, but can't be seen from anywhere beyond the mouth of the alleyway. They wait, both of them breathing heavily and nursing stitches in their sides, until they see Magnussen's cronies pass by the opening. They wait until their pounding footsteps have faded down the street and around the corner before Sherlock drops his hand away and they allow themselves to make any noise.
Somehow they're kissing again, and Vic has ended up on top of Sherlock with one hand cradling his neck and the other carding through his curls. Sherlock's arms wind around Vic, one at his waist, the other at his shoulders so he can scratch the back of Vic's neck in the way he knows makes his boyfriend melt. It's a lifetime of bliss before they break apart for breath.
"Ah," John says. Sherlock hates his whole family, John knows, but his mum is the exception. He adores her, practically worships the ground she walks on. John swallows. "Well. You did say you were gonna stop using... stuff months ago."
Of course, he's tried to bring it up again with his friend, but Sherlock isn't having any of it. He either tells John to shut up, because he's trying to think, or ignores the question completely and starts an extensive rant about an entirely different topic. Clearly, there's something being hidden, something Sherlock doesn't want John to know. He's determined to get to the bottom of it, but already he's realised that Sherlock Holmes is a stubborn git, if nothing else. If he doesn't want to tell John something, he's not going to, so the blond will have to be sneaky.
"You needn't look so worried. Mum and Dad are out," Sherlock rolls his eyes. "I want to go to mine tonight."
He makes up an excuse about having plans and needing to dash off. He'll make up for it by watching a Bond movie over the weekend, he promises. John seems happy enough with it - said he'd like walking to enjoy the rare British sunshine instead.
"It helps me cope," Sherlock replies. "Dad and Mycroft... kids at school... it all just gets too much sometimes."
"Dad would go crazy if he found out," was Mycroft's only response, before he went off back to his bedroom and left Sherlock standing alone. The games and the stories had officially stopped, but Sherlock woke up on his birthday to find a box in his room, wrapped in shiny silver paper, containing all of his favourite toys from their old games, as well as a book of Captain Sherlock stories, all written out in Mycroft's neat printing.
cold. He's really bundled up, wearing a tee-shirt and two jumpers underneath his coat as well as a full hat-scarf-and-gloves ensemble. Harry laughed at him this morning, said he looked daft in the stripy scarf and bobbly hat, and he's damn glad he didn't listen too her now. He huddles further down, bringing his shoulders up in an effort to keep his ears warm.
you know? You could predict the conversations, they always talk about the same bloody things. You're loads more interesting. I mean - we always have a laugh, you and me, don't we? And you're my best mate. Is that a good enough reason?"
"I know you don't want to hear it Shez, and I know it doesn't make anything better," he says, quietly. "But I'm sorry. I really am."
If anybody else used it, they'd be promptly told to fuck off. On Victor's lips it sounds perfect. And oh, what lips they are. Full, perfectly shaped like cupid's bow, concealing two rows of straight, dazzling white teeth and curving upwards into the most gorgeous of smiles almost every time he's in Sherlock's presence. Nobody else smiles like that because of Sherlock. Nobody else listens to him playing the violin and applauds afterwards like it's the best thing they've ever heard. Nobody else will dance with him in private - sometimes romantic and slow, sometimes daft and crazy. Nobody else kisses his curls and calls him their
and she just smiles wider. She sits on the side of John which isn't occupied by Sherlock. John grits his teeth and feels every muscle in his body tense up. Sherlock obviousl feels up and gives John's fingers a squeeze that's subtle and comforting and reassuring. Or it would be, if Harry didn't see it and smirk at John again.
This is something that's been a semi-regular occurrence since Sherlock and Vic ended. Jim's never hidden the fact that he's got something of a soft spot for Sherlock; always letting him know about the best stuff first, always playing with Sherlock's hair, telling him how pretty he is, making dodgy proposals on more than one occasion. Sherlock's not entirely sure what they
"Maybe," the librarian says, slowly. He's worried, John can tell, though he's not entirely sure why. Surely it's no great tragedy if someone is a little later than usual, even when that someone is Sherlock bloody Holmes.
"It's no problem," John says. They sit in the quiet for a long time. Then John swallows. "There's no shame in being confused, mate. None at all. In-In fact... I'm pretty confused too."
When John goes up to the library at lunchtime, he finds Sherlock is in there again, in the chair where he'd been at break.
"Something you don't need to worry about," Sherlock assures John, with as comforting a grin as he can manage.
"Sorry to bother you," he says - he's got one of those smooth, deep voices that is perfect for radio. "Is this seat taken?"
"You want some whiskey? Didn't bring any glasses, but then again I never remember you having an aversion to swigging from the bottle," Vic offers.
to mean anything," Sherlock picks up his Chemistry notes, reads them over like he's bored of the conversation already, which he is. "It means what it means. Robert may be an idiot, but he's rather a decent idiot and it's a shame he ended up with somebody who'll exploit his decency for her own personal gain and use him for sex whilst simultaneously fucking anything else with a pulse."
He doesn't sound so sure about it, but John doesn't comment because he's learned that Sherlock is stubborn as a mule and there's no point in arguing with him. He glances out of the window towards the house.
emotions, John. I've got too many of them, right now. And it's your fault. I feel... good when I'm with you. I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm not really a cuddly or affectionate person. But with you it just... it feels right. I'm so confused, John."
"I know what you're going to say. But it's true. I am literally not the child he wanted," he says. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. He's never told anyone this before, though he himself hears it once a week at least. "They... they wanted a daughter. They already had a boy, their precious little Mycroft. They wanted a little girl to make their family perfect, make it complete. Mum had her 20 week scan and they said it was girl. Mum and Dad were over the moon, obviously. Got everything they ever wanted. But scans can be wrong. I got born and I was a boy and they were so disappointed. Mum cried, apparently. They didn't want me. If they'd known I was a boy they'd've had me aborted, Dad says. He resented me from the second I was born. Fobbed me off on nannies where they could, interacted with me as little as possible. He even told Mycroft he wasn't allowed to play with me, 'cause that'd give me ideas that someone actually wanted me here. He made damn sure I knew I wasn't wanted from day one. That's why I hate him."
"Don't do this, Vic," Sherlock closes his eyes and shakes his head. "Please don't do this to me. I'm trying to move on. Please don't make me fall for you again."
Sherlock lights a cigarette when they're done, offers it to Vic, just like he used to in the old days.
Sherlock to hit him back. But he can't do it, can't bring himself to hurt Vic. So he clenches his fists and doesn't break eye contact until Phil smacks him in the back of the head. He almost yells out, but he bites his lip hard. He's not giving them that kind of satisfaction.
"No you don't. You're seventeen. You aren't going to start smoking," his father warns, and Sherlock has to fight to not laugh out loud.
"So not enough, then," Lestrade says. "Listen, mate, I know I'm just your school librarian and all but if you need to talk..."
"Just remembered. I have a ton of work to do for Psychology that I haven't even started yet," he says, not looking Sherlock in the eyes. "I'd best get home and finish it."
"No, you can have it," John tells him, just as Sherlock rounds the edge of the bookshelf. He stops dead in his tracks and V-whatever looks sheepish all of a sudden, a slight blush tinging his cheeks. After a couple of seconds he swallows deeply.
"Thanks," Anderson had said, looking John up and down. "That gangly bloke watching today, the one with the legs and the cheekbones..."
"Great," Sherlock smiles and slips his hand into John's. He doesn't show it but he's secretly thrilled that John's so casual about holding his hand in public. They keep their fingers linked the whole way home and Sherlock's glad because, despite the sub-zero temprature, John's hands are warm and his own fingers feel like icicles. He doesn't talk as much as usual on the homeward journey, just smokes and stares straight ahead, letting John talk rather than actually listening to him. He's lost in a train of thought. When Mycroft had left his room last night, he'd thrown something of a tantrum and pulled posters down and thrown pillows around and played The Sex Pistols on top volume to drown out the bangs and yells. Eventually he'd crashed out and fallen asleep on the bed, minus duvet and pillows. He didn't hear anyone come in, but when he woke up he had a pillow under his head and a blanket covering him. The only sign that anyone had been there at all was the old book of handwritten Captain Sherlock stories, open on his bedside table.
This afternoon's different though. Sherlock links his arm through John's and steers him the wrong way when  they're heading home from school.
No, Sherlock decides. He isn't going to fall for John. Besides everything he's got Jim. Jim who is gorgeous and friendly and caring in his own way. Jim who can make the pain go away, rather than asking him to talk about it. Jim who's always up for a party, always up for a good time. So maybe Jim doesn't love him, and maybe he doesn't love Jim either. It's better that way, he tells himself. No stupid, pointless emotions to get in his way. With Jim, it's all cut and dry - they get high and they fuck and that's all it ever needs to be. He tells himself he doesn't miss pet names that aren't
"I'd better not," he says. "Thanks for the offer, but my parents don't actually know I'm gone. I'd better get back, they'll go mad if I'm not in when they get up."
"Your shoulder," Sherlock waves a hand towards it. "It's a sporting injury, isn't it? Let's see - there's a tan up to your elbows but not on your upper arms, suggests you wear some kind of shirt with relatively short sleeves. Good physique, though it's starting to deplete. You're out of practise. An old injury, happened a few months ago. You've got lean legs, so it's something that involved a lot of running around... more upper body strength than is required for football. Rugby, then. You're small, narrow hips, broader chest. Means you're lighter, can move faster than most... ideal build for a half. I'm guessing you did yourself a mischief in the scrum?"
"He's talking about you trying to get into Victor's trousers when he'd already made it obvious he doesn't want you," Sebastian chimes in. "Poof."
"No," Sherlock says, quietly. Then he takes a deep breath. "I had an argument with Mycroft and I got really mad and punched the wall."
“I may or may not have pointed out some of the less pleasant features of that Smallwood girl he’s so interested in,” he says.
"So what makes it different this time?" John asks. Then something in his head clicks, and he smirks. "Oh my God!"
– jumper, up to his elbows as he confirms the order and is quoted half an hour for delivery. When he hangs up the phone and turns to John, he realises his mistake.
Sherlock gets on with John's parents much better than he gets on with his own. John's mum is short and blonde, like him, with the same kind smile and friendly manner. She's into affection in a big way and constantly smothers John and Harry in hugs. His dad is taller with mousey-brown hair and a moustache and glasses. He's not as big on hugging but he frequently gives John affection pats on the back and hair ruffles. They go down the pub together sometimes to watch the rugby and he calls John 'bud'. Sherlock likes them because they're
He's confused, to say the least. Sherlock had pulled away from the kiss almost as quickly as he'd intiated it. John didn't have time to even register what was happening, let alone reciprocate. Immediately after, Sherlock had rolled over and switched off the bedside lamp, mumbling goodnight and seeming to fall asleep within seconds. John knew he was pretending at first - nobody, not even Sherlock bloody Holmes, can fall asleep that fast - but now he's slackened up and his breathing has slowed. He's definitely out cold now, and John wishes he could get the same way.
Since Phil Anderson fed him the initial rumour that Saturday afternoon, more and more have trickled to him as he's become acquainted with more and more people. Some are fairly tame, almost kind in comparison to the rest. Sherlock just grabbed the wrong end of the stick, they say. Made a pass at Victor Trevor during a tutoring session - some kind of lewd, dodgy comment that wasn't well received. He got a bop in the nose for his efforts and Vic never spoke to him again. Others are more sickening; Victor made it apparent from the get-go that he wasn't interested, but Sherlock wouldn't hear of it. Wouldn't take no for an answer. Spoiled, selfish Sherlock Holmes was so used to getting what he wants that even when he couldn't, he took it anyway. Poor Vic was traumatised, skipped classes for a week because of it. Never pressed charges though; too scared of what might happen if he did.
He looks up to see a relatively short, narrow-hipped blond boy with dark eyes and a thick porridge-coloured jumper with the sleeves rolled well up smiling at him. He's new - Sherlock hasn't seen him milling the corridors with the throngs of arseholes he's forced to spend six hours a day, five days a week with. Besides which, if he wasn't new, he wouldn't speak to Sherlock. Nobody his age who's been at the school for any length of time does. Sherlock notes the way that the boy stretches his shoulder out and winces slightly as he waits for a response.
"Listen, I don't want to be a pain or anything but you're the only person who's name I know so far. Could I ask a favour?" John says. "I'm a bit lost. Chemistry Six, know where it is?"
John seems to like Sherlock. It's only been one day, but he already seems like... like he wants to be friends. And Sherlock Holmes doesn't have friends, never has.
"It doesn't upset me," Sherlock says flatly, and Victor tilts his head up with a hand under his chin.
“I think you get off on pissing people off, don’t you, you mad bastard?” John snorts, and Sherlock just grins.
Harry dashes inside as soon as Sherlock pulls the car up outside, itching to get started on some History project she's been set. John lingers a while longer.
School is torture, especially because they take so many of the same classes. The fact that he can look at Vic all he likes but he can't touch him at all sends Sherlock nuts. Now, when they have the full week off and Sherlock's home alone they're free to spend all day every day together, so that's what they do and it's bliss. They started seeing each other by accident, when Sherlock was helping him with Chemistry in the library and one thing led to another. It was casual at first, a cheeky snog and a grope in the library when nobody can see them, a sneaky blowjob in Sherlock's car while he's dropping Vic off at home after school. Nothing serious. Friends-with-benefits, or so they call it. It's escalated from there to the closest damn thing to a full-blown relationship Sherlock's ever seen. But it all has to be done in secret. Neither one is out yet and, though Sherlock could care less if everyone at school knows, the prospect of people finding out his sexuality can and has driven Victor to tears on more than one occasion. His dad wouldn't get it, his mates wouldn't get it, he'd become an outcast. So it's all done on the hush-hush and, though it bothers Sherlock and they've had a few arguments about it, they're just happy to be with each other. They live for times like this, when they can be open and affectionate, sprawled across Sherlock's bed in a tangle of arms and legs and sweat-damp sheets.
"I'm not in your room," Mycroft points out, waving his arms to show he's on the other side of the threshold. There's a pause. "Are you okay?"
He doesn't go straight to bed, though he desperately wants to. Instead, he pulls on a pair of sweatpants and an old hooded sweater and heads back out of the house. Usually he'd walk, but his legs won't carry him all that way so he thumbs down a taxi and has it drop him two streets over from his destination - he's almost embarrassed for the driver to know where he's going. He just got seven shades of shit knocked through him to keep Vic's dirty little secret, it only makes sense that he indulge his own. By the time he reaches the house he's looking for, he's gritting his teeth from the pain and hanging onto the door frame to stay upright. He manages to knock somehow and, after a little shouting and banging from the other side, it swings open and Sherlock forces a smile.
Sherlock sits down, perhaps a little heavier than he usually would, and starts turning the pages of the book slightly more roughly than normal.  He's a little
"Sorry," John says, swallowing. He prises Sherlock's fingers open as carefully as he can and examines his hand, feeling for broken bones. He doesn't find any, though there's a lot of bruising and a little swelling. There's no break, but there's definitely a sprain, and it looks like a bad one. John looks up, meeting Sherlock's eye. "What happened?"
"How you do so well on exams is beyond me," she says. "You're such a bright boy. Well, you'd best be off. Don't want you being late. I'll see you later, dear."
"He mostly just calls you a cunt and says he wants to be nowhere near you, to be honest," John confesses.
Who the hell is calling him at this time? He can hazard a guess. One check to the caller ID confirms it for him, and for a second he considers not answering. Then he decides he'd better, because it's got to be bloody important for Sherlock to ring rather than text.
"Something's bothering you," Jim says it against Sherlock's lips, pulling away just slightly. He's clever - almost as clever as Sherlock is - and that's maybe one of the reasons they get on so well. It's not often either one finds an intellectual match.
"Wasn't expecting you so early," he remarks, stepping aside to let Sherlock in. Sherlock shrugs one shoulder.
"She always wins," John sighs, not wanting to admit it. They're at the park now, and Sherlock throws his cigarette stub on the ground, grinding it under his heel. He sighs heavily.
"I didn't," Sherlock shrugs in a way that would be nonchalant if it wasn't so forced. "We're very... on and off."
"Wrong one, I'm afraid," John replies, as cheery as one can be at eight o'clock on a Tuesday morning. Call-me-Greg looks at him then, his nose crinkled in concern.
"To be honest, all those lot are a bit boring," John sighs. "I like them, the rugby lads and Sally and that lot. But they're just so
"Someone was really trying to ruin that pretty face of yours," he mutters. "You'll be wanting something for the pain, then?"
"Told you it was a good film," Sherlock whispers to John. They've shifted position since the start of the movie, so now John's head is resting on Sherlock's shoulder. If Sherlock turns his head he gets a mouth and nose full of silky pale gold and he doesn't totally hate it. Harry sits next to the sofa, cross-legged on the film, and watches the film avidly along with them.
he spends so much time alone. He's obviously very intelligent, and quick off the mark to go with it if what he said in the library is anything to judge by. And, John can't help noticing, he's devastatingly good looking. All alabaster-pale skin and unkempt black curls and silvery blue eyes. And holy crap those
Its the only room in the house that doesn't fit the colour scheme, Sherlock's bedroom - and that's just typical, just like Sherlock himself. The rest of the house is all cream walls and pale carpets. Ever the rebel, Sherlock had (without permission, of course) painted his bedroom black when he was  14. The carpet is black too, though Sherlock's got a frayed and faded old rag rug beside his bed. All over his walls, he's tacked up posters all over his walls of old rock bands, and there's a photo of he and John on a school trip to Paris last year in amongst them somewhere (John's moved almost to tears every time he sees it). He's got an impressive hifi system, and a large collection of rock and punk CDs. Most of his reason for owning them is because he likes to play them at top volume and piss off his dad and Mycroft. He's comfortingly messy; it's the most teenage thing about him. John's never seen the word 'floordrobe' apply more to anyone else. The laundry hamper is full, and John makes a mental note to take it down to the utility room in the morning.
"Oh," John doesn't believe it, but he's learned already that there is exactly zero sense in starting an argument with Sherlock Holmes. No matter who is wrong and who is right, Sherlock is winning simply because he's so bloody
"Thanks," he said. "Now come on. Let's get out of here before we use up all the hot water. Chinese on me?"
“Oh, yes, I think it is,” he plucks at the material. “Um… yes, I wore it home from your house one day when I stayed over last month, don’t you remember? I was supposed to give it back, but I forgot.”
"Sherlock, come on. Stop being childish," Mycroft tuts, so Sherlock sends a middle finger in the general direction of the doorway. "Well, I can see you plan on being stubborn as ever. If you do want to talk about this, I'll be in the longue."
"Thanks," John replies, with a smile. "It's nice to just get back into it, you know? I've been out of practise for a bit."
"Yes, I heard. That's excellent for him - I'll send him flowers," Sherlock says. His father's jaw tightens and he gives Sherlock that look that just screams
"Jesus Christ, Harry. Yes, we just snog," he says. "Can't we stop talking about it now? You're making me uncomfortable."
John finds Sherlock in his usual position in the library on Monday morning. At first, nothing really seems off.
"Well... okay," John follows Sherlock to the door to see him out. They pause on the threshold and exchange an awkward brushing of lips as they say goodbye.
Sorry for not updating in 23650 years, been busy AF hope y'all are still interested in reading this.
Sherlock. Things like telling their parents about finding drugs in Sherlock's room might not be just to get Sherlock in trouble, but to protect him from getting himself into it.
"Seems I underestimated your friend. He's done a very professional job," he lets go of Sherlock's hand. "You really need to reign in your temper, Sherlock."
“Don’t be sorry,” suddenly, there’s a pair of warm, soft arms around Sherlock’s waist and a head on his shoulder. “They should be sorry. Not you.”
"Same reason you did, I suppose," Vic says. They're both silent for several long moments. Then Vic sighs heavily. "Look, Shez, I'm-"
"I didn't say anything that wasn't true," Sherlock sniffs. "Mycroft used to buy me fags. Still does, sometimes. How can he get mad about straight fact?"
"Of course not," Mycroft says. "I know you don't have the best picture of me, John, but I'm no monster. Sherlock is my little brother, and I care a great deal about him. I don't want him to get hurt."
