“ Hold on. I gotcha, big man.” Dean steps away quickly, attention now aimed solidly on the squirming infant.
“ No, I don’t.”
“ I know. I’m sorry,” Castiel sighs out his apology and attempts to salvage the overly complicated side braid. “ I believe I overestimated the progress I’ve made.”  He gives up trying to correct the plaited hair’s course and gently finger combs it loose in order to start over on something simpler.
Castiel sits silently for several long minutes, debating the best strategy that doesn’t end up with him in jail for assaulting Nicolas Adler.
” I know. It’s so bad it chases away all the nightmares.” Castiel smiles, his singing falling into a quiet hum, his hand still petting the blonde head.
Cas finally releases him, nipples swollen and spit shiny, only to push the shirts higher and drag his lips across a firm pec to rest softly in the center of Dean’s faded anti-possession tattoo. Since taking the plunge together, they haven’t really had time to explore each other properly, but whenever Cas manages to expose the bold flaming circle and pentagram inked below his collarbone the older man lavishes it with sweet attention. Even without knowing its history (other than Sam having an identical design, inked together right before the younger Winchester left for Stanford), Cas can sense its significance to Dean and treats it accordingly. Just another reason Dean has fallen so hard for this blue eyed angel of a man.
“ Wha Din see?” Jack crowds against him.
is good enough for you, and Dean Winchester is far from perfect, but he’s about as close as it’s gonna get.”
Dean is still giggling over the emoticon in Cas’ last text when he hears a soft knock on his kitchen door before the light scratch and squeak of it opening. He calls out, “ In here!”, from the couch and tilts the bottle higher for Alex to easily suck down the last few drops. For a moment, Dean had been afraid that Alex was about to settle into another ten minute post bottle cat-nap, throwing off his entire sleep schedule, but the burping process has fully awakened him and those bright eyes are wide and searching for the source of the soft shuffling of feet.
One does not mediate with the devil.
“ Fuck. One thing at a time Dean.” Cas practically growls, his hips also bucking under Dean’s weight. “ There’s not enough blood flow to properly process the fantasies that just wiped out all my higher brain functions at that new piece of information.”
“ Be careful, Charlie,” Castiel warns her softly.
A chuckle escapes Castiel and he leaves her to it. He has his own programming to plan or finish up, depending on its place on his timeline. Currently he has two adult programs coming up in the next two weeks;
Dean presses in slowly, aware of the other man’s every breath, as he deepens the kiss. They break away to suck in air only to fall back together almost instantly. Dean is the first to introduce tongue into the mix this time, running the tip of his along Cas’ upper lip and shivering when he feels the answering touch of Cas’. It’s not exactly gentle, but firm and slow. Like they have all the time in the world. Dean loves it, this lazy pacing without a hint of the desperation that sometimes edges their limited experiences.
“ Well,” Cas slowly makes his way to the other side of Dean’s face, leaving small kisses in his wake. “ I’m thinking about how much I want to worship every inch of your body until you completely come apart beneath me.” When he reaches the opposite ear, Cas drops his head to Dean’s shoulder and sighs heavily. “ But I’m literally going to fall asleep standing up if I don’t get to a bed soon.”
“ Okay.”
Dean’s face is frozen for a split second, before it relaxes into an amused grin and a snort of laughter. “ You don’t have to say,
He allows a few ragged breaths to be absorbed by Dean’s shoulder, allows himself to breathe in the scent of laundry detergent and whatever Dean had for dinner, reminiscent of Cain’s cabin. Then Castiel sucks in a steadying breath and lifts his head, unclenches his hands. He leaves them splayed on Dean’s back, unable to completely move away just yet. Allowing himself a few extra seconds of comfort.
Castiel listens as the younger man yawns and snuffles into the pillow. Sleep is finally catching up to Dean. Castiel, as well. Eyelids heavy, muscles relaxed. He leans in and presses a kiss to Dean’s forehead. “ Goodnight, Dean.”
“ My apologies.” Mr. Novak seems genuinely contrite about his faux pas, but rallies quickly with a, “ Hello, Dean. You may call me, Castiel.” He pauses expectantly.
Dean meets with Cain and Cas has a nighttime visitor.
He lifts the candle to his nose and takes a big sniff. The scent is subtle, not overly sweet. Perfect. Cain knew exactly what Dean would like.
Everyone at the table, with the exception of Jack who is very much absorbed in building a waffles and strawberries tower, stares in various levels of wide eyed incredulity.
fuck, i hate autocorrect
He climbs out of bed.
So Dean gratefully accepts a cold bottle of beer and tips it back.
“ I certainly do,
“ Yeah. Yeah, I’m good.”  Dean swallows down the anger, the helplessness, knowing it’s not going to do anyone any good. The kids need him to keep it together and be his usual goofy self and Cas needs him to keep the kids calm. He can do this. He will do this. For them. “ Let’s go.”
“ No pop.” Dean is sad to confirm.
Castiel slumps further in his seat, crossing his arms over his chest, defensive. “ It’s not that easy, Meg.”
It’s a surprise party. Of fucking course.
So loved.
Dean squeezes the candle between his hands, swallowing a sudden surge of uncertainty. “ Did you kiss me back?” He honestly doesn’t remember Cain kissing him back. Okay, if he’s truly honest he doesn’t remember Cain
over his collared button up and under his usual trench coat. Cas wearing a pair of Claire’s purple sparkly dress-up wings over the trenchcoat. Cas wearing a bee antennae headband that bobs gently with every motion.
Castiel takes it all in with a worried look, his hold tightening around Jack who is now beginning to squirm. “ Of course.”
Castiel tightens his embrace, noses into the soft spot just under Dean’s ear. “ You were afraid I would call it all off for them.”
“ Then what do you mean?”
The obvious answer is that it refers to Collette. After all, there are quite a few memorials to Cain’s deceased wife in his work. But if that’s the case, Dean finds it odd that Cain would choose this particular candle to gift him every time. Like shoving the ghost of his dead wife in Dean’s face. Very much not like Cain.
“ I’ll walk with ye” Rowena stands, setting the books on the stool before smoothing her dress. Her smile is wide and predatory, aimed squarely at Castiel. She loops her arm through his, giving him no choice but to crook his elbow and escort her through the building. Castiel keeps his eye on Claire and Jack as the older steers the younger toward the candy stations. Garth’s is first and as the children chat up the least scariest werewolf in history, Rowena casually brings up, “ Your man is quite handsome.”
And I stand behind every single one of my previous texts.
“ I know it’s not really my place, but… Do you need, like… Can I do anything for you?” Dean stumbles over the offer, obviously finding it hard to choose the right words. “ I mean, if you need to talk or - you don’t have to talk about it, if you don’t want- but if you do then-- well, not that I’m great at the talking part, but I’m good at the listening. I think.” He’s staring down at the toes of his boots, a slight shrug in his shoulders. “ Or anything you need, really.”
“ You are a saint, Cain. I’ve had the most insane cravings for it.” Jess begins placing other items into her little pile at the front of the table. “ And it’s Jess when I’m not at the clinic.”
Castiel hums around his mouthful, then slowly pulls off to leave a line of small kisses back down the panties until he can suck in the pliant sac, one firm orb at a time. Dean squirms under him, spreading his legs further apart and tilting his hips up into Castiel’s touch.
Dean blinks at Cain over the bowl of popcorn, his hand deep in the middle of the fluffy kernels. “ Huh?”
Castiel dreads a birds and bees talk, but decides to answer this particular question honestly without the extra details. “ I was much, much worse.” He smiles at the memories. He’d been an absolute mess when Amelia went into the hospital to be induced and passed out twice during the actual birth. “ But your mother was very patient with me and once I got to hold you I felt much better.” He pulls her in for a hug that she quickly squirms out of to smooth out her costume. Castiel wonders if hearing such anecdotes would help lessen Dean’s anxiety. He’s already reaching for his phone when Rowena stands up, signaling the beginning of storytime.
It had been real love, Dean has no doubts about that, and losing it had devastated him. Sent him into a self-destructive tailspin Bobby and Sam had barely managed to drag him out of. Dean knows he’s lucky to have gotten out with only a Dory tattoo, a dropped assault charge, and one-hundred community service hours for drunk and disorderly charges.
“ You can text us whenever you’d like while we’re at Gabriel’s, Dean,” Castiel assures him. “ It’s a bit of a free-for-all with no set schedule. Other than no one’s allowed to get out of bed before seven am.”
“ Is this okay?” Cas’ voice is deeper than usual, rougher, but still so earnest. Always concerned with Dean’s comfort. “ Dean?”
Sam puts on Bitchface #6. “ I thought you were bringing Jess’ car.” He opens the back door, but Dean steals the baby and pushes Sam toward the curb where Nurse Clif is helping Jess stand from the wheelchair.
Sorry, I just don’t buy all that.
Everyone shook their heads with neutrality or disgust, depending.
“Sure you can,” Dean said. “I’m sure you can also be nice to Benny, right?”
--” Bobby began, and was thankfully cut off by Gabriel’s sudden appearance.
An hour later, Dean and Cas were alarmingly tipsy inside a hardware/outdoor store.
“Hey, I’m really glad you and Jess are getting along so well,” Sam said, looking a little too sappy for the occasion.
“Woah, hold your horses,” Zachariah said. Dean hadn’t even realized, but he’d subconsciously gone for a door that wasn’t there, intending to find Sam. “You can stop Sam another way. A better way.”
CASTIEL
“All that stuff we said last night,” he said. “That was real, right? We really said all that?”
Fine! I promise.
No, no, Dean-o, he’s Lucifer now, remember?
“Don’t remind me,” Cas said darkly.
“You’re our family already, Cas,” Sam said, smiling reassuringly.
Bobby was silent for another moment, then began his frantic search again.
The eye contact lasted a moment longer, tension in the air thick. Then, in a coordinated movement, Dean reached out to pull Cas towards him just as Cas surged upwards and connected their lips. Dean groaned involuntarily as Cas’s entire body pressed against his, whether due to a drunken lack of coordination or a need to be close, he couldn’t say.
?” Sam said, spinning around angrily. “And you knew about it?”
Dean tried to respond, but he didn’t have a body to move anymore.
Dean drove past the first several towns he passed. Once he had his water, he didn’t really feel that food or sleep was really necessary, so there was no reason to stop driving. It was already almost night when he started driving, and he didn’t stop until the next morning, though his progress had been significantly slowed towards the end by an errand that was becoming increasingly urgent.
“So?”
Yeah, Cas, what the [BLEEP] is this bull[BLEEP]? How’d Gabriel find us? Are you really you?
“So, get this,” he said. “Siobhan’s friends said that a little under two years ago, Siobhan had a minor psychotic break. Said she claimed she was being stalked by demons. They wanted to send her to a mental hospital, but then once she found out she was pregnant with her son, all the demon-talk magically went away. Until yesterday, when one of her friends got a frantic call from Siobhan, claiming the demons were back.”
“So, Sammy,” he said. “Whatcha doing in Assfuck, Iowa?”
“Bobby,” Dean said with a tentative smile.
The previous day, they had picked out an abandoned warehouse as the site of the trap. Cas immediately got to work, and drew a number of intricate sigils on the walls, while Dean carefully poured the holy oil. Once the sigils were up, Cas stalled for a little while longer, trying to find something to improve, before consenting to begin the ritual.
? Don’t tell me Lucifer exists.”
“We don’t know what Alastair looks like now, right?” Dean said, fishing through the glovebox, where he knew there were some long-neglected binoculars. “He could be one of those guys.”
Dean nodded, and Castiel reached over to touch his arms, one at a time. Dean felt a slight pinch, and saw a couple lines move themselves around, and several of the wobblier lines straightened themselves out.
for a ritual,” Dean mused.
“Hey,” Dean said, roused by Cas’s stirring. “Morning, Cas.”
“Yeah, we need to run,” he said. “It’s too late. Death is rising.” A quick glance at the hole in the ground revealed that it was getting larger, swallowing the bodies of the now-dead hostages as it expanded outwards.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That was great, Cas,” Dean said, pulling the other man up to kiss him lazily. Cas draped himself over Dean and let it happen, kissing back gently until Dean’s lips were sore.
“Who the hell are you and how’d you get Dean’s body?” Bobby said in a dark tone.
“Thank you,” Cas said.
“She’s, um, helping,” Sam said.
Eventually, the cold drove them back in. Everyone else had turned in already, so they shucked off their outer clothes in the entryway, hoping that they wouldn’t wake everyone up. They snuck upstairs, trying to be quick about it. Dean kept complaining that he was cold, and Cas kept pointing out that he had been the one to faceplant into the snow, and Dean kept saying that he had faceplanted knowing that he had a warm bed to return to and Cas should really not worry so much about being quiet and worry more about letting Dean return to said warm bed, and Cas finally relented and raced Dean up the stairs and into their bedroom. Neither of them wondered if the biohazard Gabriel had released into Cas’s room the previous night had dissipated yet.
Everything about it was embarrassing -- Castiel knew that. They were too old for this type of thing, much too old, and he’d had plenty of opportunities over the years to just do it, to bite the bullet and confess, and he hadn’t. Dean hadn’t either, which was a detail Castiel considered notable.
By the time Gil was done, Dean still hadn’t figured out the why.
“Everyone needs that Christmas gift.”
“I see,” Dean said softly. “Well, look. I said I wouldn’t let you die a virgin, and I meant that.”
“You’ve never done this, have you?” Dean said, beginning to gently jack Cas through the thin fabric of his pants. “Never jacked off?”
“I would have liked having it in the gross-ass closet,” Cas said. “Or anywhere, really. The back of your car. The panic room. The pits of hell.”
- Dean spent a hundred years in hell, and twenty-nine on earth.
An immediate question then came to Dean’s mind, the question of
“That’s the spirit,” Dean said, patting him on the back.
“Insolent, as ever,” Zachariah muttered. “Perhaps after some time to stew, you’ll make the right decision. You’ll see that putting this off is nothing more than an absurd attempt at a power grab.”
“No,” Dean said, eyes still glued to the binoculars, where he was seeing something he had never expected to see again, something he’d both longed for and feared in equal measure. “Well, yes, Alastair, but… who he’s wearing.”
GABRIEL
“In what sense?” Cas said, looking slightly confused. “Do you mean--”
“Or we could do that thing that they do in the old movies where they string up popcorn and hang it on the tree?”
THANKS FOR BEING HERE 🖤
“You couldn’t possibly pressure me into anything, Dean,” Cas said. “I can make my own decisions. I
you need to be,” Zachariah said. “You’ve been trying to hide, I know it, but we have spies everywhere. You can’t hide forever, Dean. And those sigils you have on your ribs can’t block out Michael. He knows you too well.”
They spent the next half hour in the nearly-empty tree lot, painstakingly smelling every remaining Douglas Fir. The top two ended up being a normal-looking one that Dean claimed smelled “only kind of good” and a tree with a slight crook in the top that was obviously emitting the best smell of any of the trees on the lot.
A snowball came barreling at Cas so fast he couldn’t react, and got smacked right in the face.
wrong.”
Chapter 5 will be posted tomorrow!
“Right,” Cas said. “Go to sleep, Dean.”
“Um, who are you?” she said in a bratty tone. As she made eye contact with Dean, her true face showed through, and Dean recoiled.
“My name is Castiel,” he said. “I am an angel of the Lord, and I want to raise you from this place.”
“All the same,” Dean said.
“It’s too late for this kind of talk,” Cas said, waving dismissively. “Lucifer has risen, and he will bring with him the end of days. The angels will oppose him, but we fear insurgence within our ranks. Lucifer can be very convincing, and many of my brothers and sisters have died in battle already. The end is nigh.”
Dean forced himself to take a breath, noticing as he did that the air around him, for the first time in decades, smelled clean and fresh and
you nut up at last. It’s taken way too long.”
“Why are you asking me that? I’m not the one who almost died,” Cas said. “For the second time.”
“Hey, how do you feel about this wrapping paper?” Dean said, holding up a golden, sparkly thing with a disgusted look on his face. Cas looked at it closer and noted that it said “Have a Blessed Christmas” over and over in a swirly cursive font, with cutesy stylized snowflakes scattered throughout.
Dean could not possibly identify the exact moment he had first picked up the knife in hell, but he knew that Castiel had first found him a few years after.
“Is that bad to say?” Cas said, taking a tiny step forward and looking deeper into Dean’s eyes.
“Someone has to lock you in the panic room,” Bobby said grimly.
All around him, the night began to light up, in uneven patches and with an unnaturally blue light. Dean felt Michael settle over his skin gently, like dew on grass.
There’s a longer pause and a thoughtful
The next morning is just as hot and humid as the one before. Dean briefly wonders if he’ll ever get used to the humidity here. Heat, he can handle, but this oppressive moistness is just shitty. And according to Sam it starts as early as March and sometimes lingers well into September. Sometimes even October.
Accepting himself and coming out are wonderful things. Dean has obviously done some research on sexual identities online, which is very encouraging. But having an actual queer person to speak with face to face, to interact emotionally, as well as intellectually, is a luxury not everyone has had. Castiel considers himself extremely lucky to have had Meg for most of his life as his partner in self discovery. He remembers Sam mentioning once that he and his brother both hail from a small town in South Dakota via Kansas. LGBTQI and their allies were most likely very thin on the ground there. Even here, Nashville is a lonely Blue dot swimming in a bigoted Red sea.
Castiel is about to protest, but Gabriel is shrieking through the earpiece. ”Yes! That! Do that! You’re a saint, Winchester!”
Castiel stares at the photo of Ruby hanging around the neck of Nicholas Adler. It’s a selfie, slightly blurry, as though her hand was unsteady on the phone. Or maybe he jostled her as she took the picture. They have matching smiles; wickedly curved, white teeth bright and sharp. Except, where Ruby’s expression is filled with a heat that Castiel can practically see radiating from her- all flames and passion- Nicholas’ is the exact opposite. Cold. Calculating. Cruel. Textbook psychopath and Castiel doesn’t understand how this woman can’t see that. But, that’s not how abuse works, he chides himself. As much as he dislikes her, Castiel sincerely hopes Ruby will make it out of this particular relationship better off than poor Kelly.
“ That’s okay. The important thing is that you tried, right? ” Claire asks, parroting Castiel’s oft repeated mantra when the children fail at some new skill.
And Dean. Beautiful, kind, empathetic Dean lets it lie with a simple, “ I can relate to that,” and a gentle smile. Then he stumbles a bit when Castiel attempts another half turn and Dean catches his toe on the edge of the rug. The blush springs to his face. “ Crap. Sorry.”
And then he’s entered the reading corner, empty save for the attractive brunette casually lounging in one of the hideously patterned chairs. Ruby does not seem surprised to see him. She drops her phone in her lap and pats the seat of the neighboring chair in invitation. “ Hey there, handsome.” She’s wearing the same lipstick as Halloween night, same flirtatious smile.
The next half hour is spent eating and drinking with sporadic conversation scattered between mouthfuls. This is what Dean looks forward to the most; this easy companionship that doesn’t know what an awkward silence looks like much less ever experienced one.
“ Sam, let the man relive his glory days.” Jess is already buckling up, shifting slightly on the pillow Sam placed in her seat.
Jess is oohing and awwing over basically everything. Dean is interested in the candy and honey filled jars which are just beyond his reach so he waits patiently as the vendor takes care of the customers ahead of Jess, his back turned to bag up their items. It’s pretty loud, with all the people and outside noises and kids playing not too far off in the park so Dean can forgive himself for not immediately picking up on the voice until it is aimed squarely at him. Or at least, right beside him.
“ Kinda like stepping back in time, right?” Jess gratefully accepts the box and slurps her drink, head tilted toward Dean in thoughtful study. “ I swear it takes ten years off your age. Laugh lines notwithstanding.”
Castiel is smiling, that gummy smile that makes Dean want to keep it there all the fucking time. “ Yes, we’ll follow Claire.”
“ Jack, we have got to get some sleep tonight because I think I’m legitimately losing my mind.” Cas presses another kiss into the damp blonde hair and Jack snuggles closer.
No one else mentions the sudden change in topic and Castiel simply assumes the red inked handprint on his shoulder means something very personal to Dean. Maybe Castiel will find out later, maybe not. He lets it slide away as the conversation turns toward safer topics, like Cain’s coterie of cats and Sam’s current obsession with binge watching
“ Yep.”
every single night?”
He can feel Cain’s presence, the light scent of aftershave as the man passes by and approaches the table. “ I have the security footage if you’d like to see. But I’m reasonably certain it was Ms. Cortese.”
Cas’ expression doesn’t change. “ Yes.”
, and the pharmacy line finally picks up.
The stoic man nods over his bowl of gumbo. Dean wonders how the hell their relationship works when one can’t see and the other rarely speaks. Or maybe that’s
“ I could totally--” Charlie begins a protest.
“ … I can’t sleep.” Dean’s whisper is so close, warm breath across Castiel’s face. Irritated little huff.
Dean breathes in the cinnamon and bourbon scents, subtle honey beneath. He loves this scent the most and Cain always slips one in, regardless of what else Dean orders. He wonders, as he often has in the past few months, what the story is behind this particular combination of fragrances. Not everything has a story, of course. But Dean has noticed that most things are labeled simply, describing the main scent; Peppermint, Pine and Cinnamon, Coffee. And a few things have more fanciful titles, like Collette’s Favorite and, of course, First Kiss.
Then it’s bottle time again and Dean is honestly a bit bored. Chill, but bored. All this baby stuff seemed so much more exciting when he was a kid watching out for Sammy. So he pulls his phone out with the hand not cradling Alex in his lap and begins scrolling through his social media sites. Nothing interesting. Dean could text someone. Like… Cas’ number is pulled up in messenger before Dean even finishes the thought.
Dean laughs quietly, then leans in to kiss the grumpy face. “ Would… would you be disappointed if we just went to bed? I mean, are you comfortable with that?”
“ Dude, I’m not trynna--”
There’s never enough time, as far as Dean is concerned.
Claire is quicker than the adults, squatting down to face Dean. “ Your boy parts okay?”
“ Yeah, uhm. I’m wearing panties.” Dean’s voice, however, is quieter as he continues. And his gaze nervously flickers away, out the window, then down where he stares at their joined hands.  Might as well put it all out there. “ I like wearing ‘em sometimes. They feel good and they make me feel, uhm, sexy and, uh, you know, confident and I--I got a new pair for myself after Christmas and I’ve been saving them for today because… it’s my birthday. ” He shrugs. And waits for Cas’ response. If he likes the idea, then they can continue getting handsy. If Cas isn’t into it, well, Dean can go commando and then they’ll carry on. It’ll be fine, either way.
It was getting darker and darker out, midnight creeping closer and closer. Now that they knew that the ritual involved Death, the search for the site of the ritual had narrowed to any nearby graveyards, which should have been a big breakthrough. However, it appeared that Alastair had been anticipating having company, because large groups of demons were posted at all three of the nearest cemeteries, making it hard to tell which one was the chosen one.
With a gasp, Dean returned to the white room, where Zachariah was looking at him with false sympathy.
“Shit,” Dean said. “You think Siobhan had a demon child?”
“Er,” Cas said, blushing and looking down. “When humans have sex… do they normally do it one time, or--”
Cas didn’t, but he nodded all the same. Was it wrong to enjoy this? Dean tied his tie quickly, with expert fingers, and met his eyes wordlessly. Cas had been planning to react in some way, but found himself familiarly unable to when faced with the full effect of Dean up close. Dean had certainly aged since they’d first met, fine lines forming around his eyes and his skin losing some of the freckles it had once had, but his eyes were the same as ever -- so green you could drown in them.
“Lay still and don’t move,” Cas commanded.
With a high-pitched noise not unlike the sound of nails on a chalkboard, the first figure put a still-glowing hand to the nearest demon's head and smote it, causing it to sink to the ground in a burnt-out husk. The figure turned so that Dean could get a better view, still burning so bright that he couldn’t see any distinguishing facial features. But what he could make out was the faint appearance of black wings, thrown into relief by the blue light coming from the center of the angel.
“Here, you hold the trash bag,” Charlie said, offering it to him. “We can be more efficient if we just shovel crap into here at a more rapid pace.”
Dean sighed. “Yeah, all right. I’ll help you. Of course.”
“You’ve seen me shirtless before,” Cas said.
“Just don’t eat salads if you're worried,” Dean suggested. “That’s what I do.”
“I get that,” Dean said. “But you made it sound like the angels had some sort of plan, right? What happened to the plan?”
Cas just nodded, clearly as stressed as he’d been the previous afternoon.
“Hey, don’t worry,” Dean said, pulling Cas into his side. “I feel the same way. My job is pretty flexible, so you don’t have to worry about moving. And I’m not gonna run.”
“Is there a reason--” Castiel began.
“I AM ON YOUR SIDE,” Michael said again. “YOU WILL UNDERSTAND SOON.”
Hmm. I see the problem. Now is not the right time, is it? Poor Gabriel. These family squabbles are so hard for him to bear. He just wants it to end.
In the car, Dean seemed to regain his enthusiasm for the day.
” Dean said, moving forward to put the blade to the creature’s neck.
“Well, welcome to life on earth,” Dean said, trying for a light tone. “Worse than heaven, better than hell. That’s our whole thing, right?”
“Where are they going?” Gabriel said.
Dean was tempted to tease him more, but the angel just looked so at peace, lying on the bed with all his clothes still on and his hands perfectly clasped over his chest. Plus, Dean was tired as well -- the sleep had restored his body, but he still felt like his brain hadn’t had a rest in forever. It was easier to just roll back over and fall asleep again.
“We’ll be gone by then,” Castiel said, fixing Gabriel with a vicious glare. “I just need to know one thing, brother.”
“Did you sleep well, Dean?” Cas said.
“None of us are okay, Dean,” he finally said, tone devoid of any emotion. “I can’t fix any of it. And it appears that God can’t fix it either.”
“Offended by what?” Gabriel said, looking like a cat who had just discovered a nest of baby birds. Then again, he often looked like a cat who had just discovered a nest of baby birds.
” Castiel said. “Escaping for myself was an ordeal in itself.”
“Hey,” Sam said, sounding as though he was only half-paying attention. “Me and Ruby are in northern California. We’re not really sure what we’re seeing, but we think we could use some backup. Got a whole army of demons, looks like.”
“I haven’t gotten dressed yet,” Dean said.
“You sure about this?” Gil said. “Doing both arms in one go is a lot for most guys.”
plans all around, really spectacular.”
“See, I don’t think they do,” Alastair said, grabbing his shirt and using it to pull Dean right up against his body. Before Dean could react, Alastair was shoving the blunt knife up under his ribcage with a force that should have been impossible, causing Dean to breathe in a painful, aborted gasp.
“There is
“I’m always nice to Benny,” Cas said. Someone (Jo?) snorted with a little too much aggression.
Let me know if y'all want warnings in front of the chapters with NSFW content -- I didn't put any for this one because I figured it was in the tags for the work as a whole and I didn't want to spoil anything. But I can start putting them in for anyone who wants to skip the NSFW parts!
How distant from humans were angels, anyways?
“How did you find all this out?” Dean asked Ruby suspiciously.
They drove mostly in silence for another hour, until they pulled into the town where Cas had found Gabriel. Dean got them checked into a motel, while Cas disappeared and reappeared with a large crate of “supplies,” which he set down in the middle of the room.
Jumping the car was another memory that returned to Dean almost as soon as he attempted it. Strangely, it was the experience of driving the car that first began to really, truly convince Dean that he might
“We’ll just avoid them,” Dean said. Cas still wouldn’t look at him.
When it got dark, Bobby revealed that he had at least been somewhat supportive of the cleaning efforts by presenting everyone with beer and burgers fresh off the grill. Everyone gathered tiredly around the now-shiny-clean dining room table. Cas made eye contact with Jo across the table and nodded hello -- apparently she had been here all along, but so deep into cleaning the basement that he hadn’t even noticed her. As they ate, Charlie and Dean entertained everyone with tales of the last time they had LARPed, when Dean was in Charlie’s city -- apparently Dean had taken a very public fall during a very key moment. Warm from the beer and the sudden company of so many friends after so many months spent alone in his one-bedroom apartment, Cas laughed along to the story, forgetting to notice when Gabriel mysteriously disappeared for a short while.
OH, DEAN WINCHESTER, THERE IS SOMETHING YOU DO NOT KNOW. YOUR BROTHER HAS ALREADY SAID YES TO MY BROTHER. IT IS TOO LATE TO STOP HIM.
Dean fought against his bindings as Alastair continued to ramble, taking a blunt silver knife out of his pocket and stroking it lovingly.
doing. What happened to the Antichrist, Alastair? Do you really think it’s good PR to kill a baby?”
“All right,” Dean said, mildly concerned now. “Who are you?”
Taking advantage of Alastair’s temporary distraction, Dean tried again to revive his brother.
“Looks like you got into… some kind of something there,” Gil said, and then, mercifully, moved on. Dean supposed he had probably seen worse. “I can’t tattoo over that skin. There’s too much scar tissue.”
The collection of ornaments that they had to work with was a lovely combination of ancient, barely-together pieces from Bobby’s attic, simpler ones Sam had picked up from the store the prior day, and novelty ornaments Gabriel had snuck in somehow.
“I wanted to make sure you were dressed,” Dean said, slipping in.
Dean and Castiel, should you choose to forgo your individual rooms, you may spend the night together in the "fantasy suite," where you can test your physical connection if you choose to.
“I don’t really want to kill you, Dean, you understand,” Alastair said. “You could have turned into something beautiful… but it’s my orders. So we may as well have some fun with this.”
“I’m just kind of tired,” Dean had been saying, over their fifth beers in as many hours. “It was fun to be traveling all the time at one point -- sure beat everything else -- but, I don’t know, man, I feel like I never see you guys anymore. Sammy’s got this whole life, you’ve got this whole life, our friends are all settled down…” He trailed off. Castiel didn’t know what to say -- for nearly the entire time he’d known Dean, being a pilot had been his ideal job, and it had seemed like he really enjoyed it. He had overcome his fear of flying with the kind of aggressive bravado Castiel had come to associate with him, not just becoming a pilot, but becoming one of the hardest-working, most popular, charismatic pilots the airline had ever seen. Cas had flown with him once, and hearing the entire cabin laughing at his jokes had been a marvel to behold -- but then, what about Dean wasn’t a marvel?
“Lack of faith? Yeah, I can relate,” Dean said, reaching out to clap the angel on the shoulder. He looked up at the contact, meeting Dean’s eyes with an intensity that seemed unnecessary for the situation. “Sorry, man.”
Plagiarism is okay if you only plagiarism the most iconic scene in the entire show, am I rite
“Morning, Cas,” he said, trying to pretend nothing strange had happened and throwing his clothes on as fast as possible.
“Good,” Dean said. “Night, Cas.”
“Actually, I feel like I should say now, I love you, Dean,” Cas said. “‘Dating’ seems a rather flimsy term for what I want to do with you, and if that’s too forward of me, you may as well know about it now. I love you so much, Dean.”
So it was that he spent his days on earth, and his nights in hell.
“I think it could be ironic,” Cas said, noting that it was the only tube of wrapping paper left in what had previously been a full bin.
Castiel retrieved his pajama pants and old t-shirt before closing the door to the abomination. He changed awkwardly before sheepishly going to knock on Dean’s door (it wasn’t worth it to yell at Gabriel at this hour).
“And you believe him?” Cas said. “Dean, you have to understand. There is nothing I wouldn’t give to get you out of hell again.”
Hmm, I think I’ve heard that one before. I want to talk to my brother.
couldn’t stand giving up on the possibility so completely, not when his own demise was sure to be bloody regardless. He had to at least try.
“Thanks,” Cas eventually forced out.
“You drunk yet?” Dean said, returning to the table.
“I don’t know,” Dean said. “You don’t know Sammy like I do.”
“I was thinking we’d start by getting some alcohol,” he said. “Maybe even Christmas themed alcohol. Throw Sam a bone.”
“Cas,” he said seriously. “Your mission -- should you choose to accept it -- is to help me find the ugliest pair of socks in this mall to give to Gabriel. What do you say?”
“This is surely a cheerier use of your time,” Charlie said.
“We have
“No, what the hell, Dean?” Sam said. “You’re not an attack dog, you’re my brother. I thought.”
Cas bristled and looked ready to say something else, but a huge thunderclap came at that moment from right above the warehouse, inexplicably managing to break a huge hole in the roof. Gabriel laughed maniacally as rubble fell around him.

“You really trust that angel,” he said.
“By all means,” he said, passing the lube over. The other man put some on his long pointer finger, then pushed tentatively at his entrance, circling slightly as if to find the best angle before plunging in, his finger reaching impossibly further than Dean’s own could. Dean inhaled sharply at the intrusion, and forced himself to relax. It had been a very long time since he’d felt the sensation of someone else inside him, and it was strange, but also made him crave
Downstairs, the chaos with the tree was beginning in earnest, as enough people had woken up so as to cause a chain reaction, forcing everyone else to wake up as well. Sam in particular was sounding shrill enough to induce even Gabriel out of the panic room.
So his third option began to seem more and more inevitable. And it didn’t help that Michael had figured out a way to become semi-corporeal, appearing in the corner of Dean’s room at random times, smiling smugly. His form looked alarmingly like Cas’s, and his voice had stopped being at quite the intolerably loud decibel it had been before. Now he
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean said brightly. Cas figured it would be a good idea to throw him off the scent of what his real gift was, especially if things got awkward and Cas got too scared to follow through on giving the real gift.
“Sure, whatever,” Gabriel said, turning to leave. This time, Sam let him go.
death? Like--”
“Is this wise?” Cas said. “We have to drive home.”
“That was really cute, Dean,” Alastair said with a giggle. He pressed the blade harder, cutting off the oxygen to Dean’s brain. He wondered where he’d go when he died, again. Presumably back to hell, where he would get to enjoy another century of Alastair being a pain in his ass.
And an actual, living earthworm should
” Sam said. It was apparent that this wasn’t the first time this conversation had happened. “And some people are allergic to dust, you know. If you can’t clean it yourself, you should hire someone to come in every now and then.”
“Oh,” Sam said, his eyes falling shut again as he leaned on Dean and allowed himself to be deposited into the passenger seat. Dean vaulted into the driver’s seat and floored it, with no destination in mind other than
“Oh? How’s that?” Dean said, and Cas first thought he was being deliberately, mockingly flirtatious, but when he looked into his eyes, Dean seemed genuinely curious -- even a little sad, despite all the “it’s fine”s.
“Good morning, Dean,” Cas said. “I was about to wake you. We need to go.”
Doesn’t change my mind. I’m not saying yes to you, and Sammy's not saying yes to Lucifer. It ain't happening.
They chased each other around like children for a while longer. Cas knew that Dean hadn’t had the opportunity to be a kid for very long, which was why Cas felt such joy whenever he saw Dean able to let loose like this. Some people who barely knew him wrote Dean off as immature, but Cas knew that wasn’t the case at all. He hid it, but Dean was more mature than most, and deserved to laugh like a child more than most, too.
“Maybe,” Dean said. “Death probably likes more dead bodies, right?”
SAM/LUCIFER
“Okay, I’ll keep it simple then,” Sam said. “You feel like you were rejected up there, right? Well I’m telling you, you weren’t.”
. Cas was pacing a little, a shockingly human act that contrasted with his stiff posture and ever-present, perfectly ironed suit and trench coat. Sometimes, when Dean closed his eyes too hard, he could still remember Cas’s true form that he’d glimpsed in hell, could still almost see the outline of his massive form and could feel the innate power that had radiated from it, now radiating from his new vessel, so obviously
“Isn’t that a good thing?” Cas said, sinking down to replace his hand with his mouth. Dean watched him bob up and down, threading a hand through his thick head of hair and muttering soft words of encouragement.
“You have to tell me about these things, Dean,” Sam said, sounding exasperated.
“Castiel,” he whispered. “I really need you, man.”
Audience boos.
CASTIEL (grimly)
“I miss it too,” Dean said easily. “God, the shit we got up to at KU…”
“125 Fahrenheit,” Cas said.

“Interesting,” Dean said, momentarily forgetting to censor himself and act like he had already known about the handprint.

I've been shipping Dean/Cas since 2013 when I started watching Spn, but like a lot of people, had long since stopped keeping up until 15x18 aired. I'm glad I got this second opportunity to write Dean/Cas, since I was too scared to share any of my work back in 2013 :)
“We are not
“Cas!” Dean shouted, putting his hands on his knees and breathing hard. “You got your ears on, buddy?”
“Ah,” Dean said, understanding. If there was one thing he could relate to, it was disobeying stupid orders and suffering the consequences. “Well, if it’s any consolation, this seems like the right thing to do, right? So... that’s good?”

“Why would you owe me?” Cas said, brow furrowed in what looked like genuine confusion. “Dean is the one I saved.”
Cas sighed heavily, kicking off the ducks that had now begun lying on him and getting up so that Dean was forced to look directly into his eyes. “You are no longer in hell,” Cas said. “You are on earth, where miracles
There was a long silence. Cas sat as still as a rock.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’ll make up for the time we lost,” Cas said, meeting Dean’s eyes. His gaze was intense, filled with mischief and lust and a thousand things Cas couldn’t yet identify because Dean had never willfully showed them to him before. Cas felt something within him stir, and subconsciously licked his lips.
He still looks a lot like my brother! That’s a tough one to get past, plus, you know, he’s
“Thank god,” Dean said. “I don’t have to pretend I’m not in love with you anymore. That shit had gotten old.”
“What?” Dean said. “
“We should go inside,” Dean said, pulling back just a little. “Would be a shame to get frostbite.”
“Sure,” Dean said, clearing his throat again. “So, uh, why are you calling me?”
CASTIEL
The glowing mass retracted quickly, back into the human form from the rack. Castiel brushed at something on his shoulder as if nothing had happened.
Sam barely reacted, and Dean found himself wondering what the hell was going on with his brother. Normally Sam wasted no opportunity to get mad at anyone who implied he was
let you rot in hell.”
Sorry, you must not have heard my question! I said, do you have any idea who your final pick is going to be? I mean, you have some pretty incredible choices before you.
Fury swirled behind Zachariah’s freakishly wide eyes, and he reached out and pressed two thick fingers to Dean’s forehead. Dean felt a jolt, and suddenly he was in an eerily blank room, with white walls, white ceiling, a white floor, and no furniture or windows.
“I’m trying to do what you seem to want,” Sam said, hanging up before Dean could say anything else.
“I know!” Cas snapped, before remembering that he was currently on the offensive here. “I have a plan, alright? Your role in the plan is to not cause a ruckus, and ideally not land anyone here in the emergency room.”
“Following me?” Dean said. He remembered suddenly that they’d once run into their past selves while in the river, that Cas
“Just used to pain,” Dean said. He figured it was better to say that then the truth, which was that Dean wasn’t even
And then, finally, there was a break. Ruby showed up one day, looking worse for the wear, claiming that Alastair had at last picked a new vessel and was going to perform a complicated ritual the following night. And even better, he supposedly had the Colt, and was intending to use it in the ritual.
“You’d bother going all the way to hell to get me back, when you could just let me go now? You say you can track me, right? So why is it so bad that I want to go to my brother, if you can find me again?”
“Oh,” Dean said, scooting closer. As if still afraid he might be slapped away, he reached out with one slow hand at a time, cupping Cas’s face in his hands.
“No,” Gabriel said. “You have to stay.”
GABRIEL
Dean raised an eyebrow.
Cut to a sequence of shots of Dean and Castiel sitting on two adjacent park benches by a lake. Dean and Castiel sitting in the Impala. Castiel standing over Dean’s bed in the dark.
“What would you know about that?” Dean accused.
Cas took a sip, and fought the urge to spit it back out. If it was “barely alcoholic,” then so was pure ethanol.
“It’s an

“Okay,” Sam finally said. “I think we should take some time apart from each other for a little bit.”
“I don’t want to fight with you, Dean,” he said in an insincere tone. “We’re supposed to be on the same side.”
“Oh, I will,” Alastair said, with mocking friendliness. “I just need to tear apart your brother real quick, and then we’ll go our own ways. Well, for now.”
The cascade of dirt onto Dean’s face when he finally got the coffin open was almost a relief. Here was a sensation besides

he should be. He followed Dean, stiff and nervous despite his copious amount of drinks.
It was already getting dark out. Where had the day gone? No way could Cas say his piece today. Admitting it allowed him to relax, just a little bit.
“Point taken,” Dean said.
“You look nice, Cas,” Dean said. He hadn’t stepped away yet, nor had he released Cas’s tie.
“Really?” Cas said, leaning back to look Dean in the eyes. Dean noted with satisfaction that his pupils were dilated, and though he didn’t need oxygen, he was also panting slightly, perhaps on a forgotten human instinct.
“It was smart of you to lure him past the warding on the warehouse,” Cas reassured. “And it saved your life, in the end.”
“Oh, of course you did,” Bobby said, lowering his weapon only to pick up some water and throw it in Dean’s face.
Cas just sighed again.
“On Christmas?” Cas frowned. “I had assumed we were just going to open presents.”
“Me?” Cas said.

“Yes,” Cas said, all potential objections out the window in favor of observing the way the snowflakes looked when they got caught in Dean’s eyebrows and eyelashes.
“But why?” Sam said. “Why would he go to all that trouble when he could possess anyone he wants to?”
“I don’t know how,” Cas said, looking a little panicked.
His arms were pleasantly sore, as if he had gotten a massage from someone who had been just a little bit too overzealous, and he tried to sink into that feeling in an effort to avoid feeling anything else. He paced around the room for a while, trying to burn off some extra adrenaline. Eventually, he realized that there would be no burning off the extra adrenaline -- it was just
Really, this was Castiel's mistake. He should never have believed that Gabriel would rely on
“You’re Castiel, right?” Sam said as soon as he saw him, approaching the angel with an expression of awe. “We’ve never met in person. It’s such an honor…”
“Is that holy water?” Dean asked. Truthfully, he knew the answer was
Planning to post Chapter 6 in two days, and then after that I'll probably try to stick to this posting-a-chapter-every-day thing!

Dean looked away after a long moment and changed the subject. “So, I guess we still need to find Alastair, right? Do we know where he is now?”
I now have a ~posting schedule~ (also added to beginning notes)! Basically, I will be posting a chapter every day, with an extra day between 5/6 (already happened), 10/11, and 14/15. This is mostly because I like posting every day but 5, 10, and 15 are big chapters :)
“Hmm,” Dean said, deliberately ignoring the whispers. They abated immediately, but Dean had a feeling that if he tried to hear them again, they’d come back. “That’s tempting, but I’ll have to pass for now. There’s somewhere I need to be right now.”
“You can say that again,” Sam said.
“We believe the demons Azazel, Lilith, and Alastair were most instrumental in bringing this about,” Cas said. “They are Lucifer’s most devoted followers. I don't know about the rest.”
“No, but now I am. Get ready, kid. This is happening tomorrow. Your Christmas gift is your dear old brother getting you laid.”
“Not on freakin’ Alastair!” Ruby said.
“Really? What happened in hell, then, Dean?” Sam said.
“That sounds like a problem I can deal with after I find my brother,” Dean said politely. “Would you be a dear and point me in his direction?”
Dean scanned down the line of new arrivals, not sure what he was looking for. They all looked like demons to him, poorly-disguised, lower-level ones who wore their vessels uncomfortably and in such a way that their true faces showed through readily, if one knew how to look. None could be Alastair, who Dean swore he’d be able to recognize in any body, at any time. He was just about to put the binoculars down and tell Sam as much when his vision landed on the last demon in the line, and his blood ran cold.
“Next time I’ll do better,” Cas said, rolling over into what seemed like a nap (“meditative prayer,” Cas would later clarify). Dean smiled at the idea, and realized only after he’d gone to the bathroom, washed off his face, and gotten back into bed and into the angel’s idle arms, that Cas had just
“So,” Dean said, rolling over and looking at Cas with a puppyish expression on his face, “What do we do now?”
“Michael,” he slurred.
Dean shoved the warehouse doors open, and he and Sam came gasping back into the outdoors.
“Let me go,” Sam said through gritted teeth.
“Well, it’s the wrapping paper that counts, and ours is… Blessed,” Dean said.
They decided to start at the mall, where a virtual mob of people were running around, evidently doing the same last-minute gift shopping Dean and Cas were attempting. As they looked at a store with wrapping paraphernalia in the window, Cas watched a harried woman chasing her child around, and wondered if that was a better use of his holidays than his usual plans. He was supposed to have kids by now, right? But all evidence seemed to suggest that he would be a horrible father. Did he even want kids? Did Dean?
Zachariah grunted in frustration.
“We’ll see about that, little brother,” Gabriel said, looking sinister. “We’ll see.”
“Sure,” Gil said. It was pretty easy to read in between the lines and deduce that it would not be Gil’s best work, but as long as the shapes were all the right places, Dean guessed the symbols would do their jobs.
Sam knocked on the door of the trailer with an authoritative firmness. “Ms. Flannigan?” he called out, to no response. They waited a moment.
“Scheme against heaven?” Michael asked confusedly.
Dean attempted to communicate that he should keep going without moving his mouth. Luckily, Cas appeared to get the message, reaching down to twine his fingers in Dean’s hair as Dean focused and breathed through his nose, keeping his jaw slack. Truly, he had forgotten what this felt like, but he was starting to remember that he liked it, as Cas continued to make small movements all while letting out a truly satisfying stream of compliments and moans. It occurred to Dean that Cas had never watched porn, had never had sex himself, so had no idea what he was “supposed” to say or do. The realization made the entire experience so much hotter, as Dean realized that everything Cas was saying, he truly meant.
“Say it again, Dean,” Cas said.
“I was only worried I had hurt your feelings,” Cas said, a little angrily. “But judging from your reaction, I guess I did not.”
“Sounds like a big problem,” Dean said, turning away. “You guys should probably focus on that. I gotta go.”
CASTIEL (con’t)
What the--
“Or better,” Sam said. “Because I could kill her the second she betrayed me, but this angel could be betraying you as we speak, and we have no idea how to stop it. We have no idea if it even
Cut to a FLASHBACK SEQUENCE. Wide panning shot of Dean, looking thoughtful and standing beside his car, on a scenic desert road.
“I accept this mission,” Cas said solemnly.
” Sam said. “That I would be the one to take over hell.”
“How dare you, Dean Winchester,” Cas said, turning away.
“Gabriel cancels out Jo,” Dean realized.
“Guess that’s a good thing,” Bobby said. “Probably not a lot of happy memories made down there.”
“Presumably,” Cas said.
“My powers might work on him,” Sam said. “Or we could try to get the Colt? Alastair supposedly has it, right?”
There were also good moments, despite everything else. Dean occupied them hesitantly, knowing that the present version of himself fit into them like an incorrect puzzle piece, but never quite having the heart to point it out to anyone else. Like after their first hunt back together (a simple possession case, because Sam thought it was best for Dean to “ease back into it”), when Sam wordlessly got on the hood of the Impala after it was done and handed Dean a beer. Or the first time he made Sam laugh at something he did (Sam called it a “stupid prank”, but Dean had just been trying to leave his sandwich in a place he would be able to easily find it. So what if that place was the passenger seat of the Impala, where Sam sat unthinkingly and ruined his pants?).  The good moments, luckily, lead to more good moments, as Dean slowly re-learned how he was supposed to act around people who cared about him. He was able to pass as good-natured again. He was good at talking to people on cases, for the most part. Sam looked at him like he was a kicked puppy a little less.
“Room 34,” he muttered to Bobby, who thanked the bored-looking girl at the front desk.
“I wonder if they took her alive,” Sam said.
The mother of the missing ten-month-old, Siobhan Flannigan, lived alone in what looked like an old, but well-cared-for, trailer. She was a single mother, and claimed that someone had broken into her home and taken her child while she was asleep. That was all the papers said about her.
“No, seriously, I feel like we should take a turn around the garden together, or something. Like, you’re really sweeping me off my feet here.”
“Shall we do some RPing with Daddy Dearest, here, while we have a moment?” Alastair continued. “Anything you’d like to tell him? Anything you’d like off your chest before Death comes and we all go back to hell?”
And then he saw hell, the real hell, the one he remembered, and he saw himself back at the racks, torturing scores and scores of angels, angels who still clearly hadn’t fallen but were somehow cowed and powerless, getting carved into by some future version of Dean, a version who was cackling maniacally as he sliced and burned. As he laughed, his eyes changed color -- not to black, but to the golden yellow color of Azazel’s eyes. Alastair was watching in the shadows, flushed with an egregious amount of pride. He was free to indulge in the sin, after all -- his side had won, and Dean had turned.
“I’ve been hearing rumors of angelic activity,” he said, nodding. “The demons are apparently up to something big. Something big enough that the angels are finally walking the earth again. I haven’t met one yet, though. I didn’t believe it for a long time, but there are too many signs to ignore.”
Dean gathered all the saliva in his mouth and spit on Alastair.
“We’ll get the food,” Sam said.
“Fine,” he said, carefully fishing an ice cube out of his drink and taking the needle from Dean. He held the ice cube behind Dean’s earlobe and shoved the needle through Dean’s ear in one quick motion. “Can we talk now?”
“Don’t tell me you’re on Bobby’s side about this,” Charlie said. “The place was genuinely creepy. Like, I love Bobby, but holiday cheer is superior to dust and random papers everywhere.”
“Sam might burst an artery if our tree is visibly impaired,” Cas said. “What do you think, Alfie?”
Dean was being cowardly and trying to escape his fate.
“You seem reluctant to accept that good things can happen,” Cas said.
"I don’t want you to do this," Cas continued. "In fact, I would give anything for you to
“I have no idea what Jo would want,” Cas said, suddenly overwhelmed by the idea of getting so many gifts. Incidentally, he’d already gotten Dean a gift, and Bobby as well since he was their host, but he hadn’t spent much time thinking of the others. He felt like an asshole for it now.
of me?” Sam said. “Look, I know there’s a lot you’re not telling me, and I don’t want to pry, but it’s also really difficult when you constantly lie to me and act like this.”
“No chance in hell you're getting near those,” said Bobby.
They were quiet again until they got into the town -- some random, mostly quiet place in Iowa. It had one motel, and Bobby headed straight there. They checked every person who had checked in within the last week, and one name jumped out at Dean for some reason.
“I like your style, Bobby,” Gabriel said with a grin, directing Dean to place the eggplant in another prominent location.
but under Cas’s smothering gaze it was hard to get those words to come out of his mouth. He gulped.
Lots of shit happened that caused the massive delay but to make a long story short my hands don't work right :/ hard to type without working hands lol, but I had to work around it and finish this
“Hey, no it isn’t,” Dean said, reaching out to give Sam an amicable pat on the back. “Look at this nice creepy angel ornament we got here. Isn’t that soothing?”
soul? I don’t think I belong up here any more, Cas, I really think I don’t.”
When Gil switched to the left arm, they ran into a small problem.
GABRIEL
“I don’t know where Sam is,” Dean finally said, forcing his eyes down. The tension in the air lessened immediately.
“You didn’t know, Dean,” Castiel said. “And I got out anyway.”
“Why don’t I start?” Cas said. “There were things I wanted to say to you, when I came here… things I never had the courage to say to you before…”
Sam had split off already, trying to get into a good position to attack Alastair. Dean was standing behind a tree, preparing to Be A Distraction. More demons were arriving by the minute, joining the original circle and stacking themselves so thickly that Dean could barely keep track of what was happening anymore. It was time.
“All of… who?” Dean said. He looked a little confused. Was he freaking out? Cas was freaking out. Cas was going to repress this memory for all it was worth, he was never going to resurrect this memory, he was going to take back everything even slightly incriminating that he’d ever said about Dean, in fact, he would never say anything remotely nice about Dean Winchester ever again.
“THERE IS MUCH YOU STILL DON'T KNOW,” Michael continued. “MUCH YOU STILL CAN'T ACCEPT. BUT YOU WILL, DEAN WINCHESTER. YOU WILL LEARN ALL, AND YOU WILL SEE THAT WORKING TOGETHER IS THE ONLY WAY. I AM ON YOUR SIDE, DEAN WINCHESTER, AND YOU WILL SOON BE ON MINE.”
“I said,
Why is this so hard for you, buddy? You got all these supernatural beings fighting over you, and all you have to do is pick one. Just end it, already. Aren’t you tired of the act? I know I am.
“Cas, please,” Dean choked out, the cold air making his voice thicken and his eyes water after only a second.
It was a good try, little brother, but you need to let us go now. It’s not the right time. Dean isn’t ready.
“Just give it a rest, Sammy,” Dean said, going to lie in the bed and turning away pointedly. Sam stood where he was for a few moments before realizing that Dean wasn’t going to move or say anything else. Dean heard him redress and leave the room, shutting the door heavily behind him.
The producer finishes conferring with the others in the crew, and asks Dean to just read the contents of the DATE CARD he’s holding in his hand.
“You’re insane,” Sam said.
“That’s sex,” Dean said, grinning. “People kill for that.”
,” Gabriel said. “Imagine.”
“Cas?” Dean whispered. “That you?”
“No,” Dean said.
“So what’re you doing to stop them?” Dean said. “Ganking ‘em? You still got the knife?”
“I’ll get you started,” Alastair said. “Okay, why don’t we pretend that you just came out to your father. You just told him that you’re fucking that abominable angel who sprung you from hell. Repeat after me: ‘Dad, guess what, your precious all-American son is taking it up the ass from a fairy angel’-- oh, you don’t want to repeat after me, Dean-o? Okay, well let’s pretend you did, and then
How disappointing for the forces of hell to lose out on this
Thus, The Plan was born.
“Just don’t know why Sam thinks
Cas kissed like a person who had never done it before, at first, but he quickly picked up on Dean’s cues and opened his mouth, letting Dean plunge his tongue into his mouth with all the sloppiness and lack of finesse of a sincerely drunk person who had been thinking about his partner’s mouth for a long time, if he was honest with himself. Cas reached up, running his hands through Dean’s hair in a desperation that mirrored Dean’s own.
“You’re ready, Dean Winchester,” he murmured soothingly.
“Go up a little,” Dean breathed, and the angel brushed his prostate, just barely, but enough to cause Dean to arch his back involuntarily just slightly. “That’s good.”
“You don’t like these?” Dean said, holding his wrists up. “Wait ‘til you see my tramp stamp.”
How did you get that footage?
“Hey, do you think Jo wants a book on the story of Led Zeppelin?” Dean said, coming up behind him.
The next morning, Cas woke up to find that Dean was mostly on top of him. Despite the loss of feeling he was currently suffering in his left arm, Cas had to smile. He’d always suspected that Dean was a cuddler at heart, and now he had proof.
“The right thing to do is starting to seem more and more impossible,” Cas said, sounding frustrated. “I am beginning to understand humans more. From heaven, it all seems so obvious. On earth, nothing really is, is it? Smiting the town where Samhain was raised, that would have been the right thing to do, because it would have stopped that seal from breaking, and perhaps Lucifer would still be in the cage. But it was also the wrong thing to do, because then those people would have all died.”
and make him do anything, see how far that got them, but then he started to get visions of the tattoos melting off his arms and rendering him powerless and back in hell, so vivid that he could almost smell the sulfur and burning flesh. He fell asleep a few times, but every time he gasped awake as soon as he started to dream, his subconscious well-versed in the art of not letting him sleep too deeply.
get to know about it, hurray for you!”
“An Antichrist, yes,” Sam said. “These children are powerful enough on their own, but to offer one up in some kind of ritual amplifies it by a thousandfold. I think… I think Alastair is going to try to use this child to summon Death.”
GABRIEL
Alastair picked up one of Sam’s hands and kissed it, swiftly dodging Sam’s swinging fists. He geared up to kick him, but Alastair finally gave him the frozen treatment.
“Okay,” Dean said, rolling over so that he was beside Cas. He uncapped the lube, and put some on his finger. “So, you just go one finger at a time. Like this.” He felt a little embarrassed trying to open himself up in front of Cas, but the angel appeared so genuinely curious that it was hard to remain embarrassed for long.
“He really said they’d smite the townspeople, too?” Sam said, looking worried.
“Yes,” Cas said, releasing his arm.
“Dean,” Cas said with a long-suffering sigh.
“You actually know a way out?” Dean said.
GABRIEL
“Did you ever figure out why all of that was happening?” Cas asked.
I’m ready to “find love and settle this whole Apocalypse thing once and for all”… ugh,
“Take the stuff inside,” Dean said. “I’ll help him with this.”
“Excellent,” Cas said, getting up to leave.
A quick trip to the bathroom later, Cas felt alert enough to at least do a passable job of wrapping the gifts. Dean returned right on time, with two steaming mugs of coffee and the needed supplies.
“I can’t believe you were rude to an angel,” Sam said. “Shouldn’t we try not to provoke it? Do you think it’s angry at you?”
“Fuck," Dean said. "So... it's true?" He was looking at Cas like he had just shown him the gates of heaven. “You really do feel the same way I do?”
“In several millennia, the situation never arose,” Dean scoffed. “You gotta
“I’m already drunk.”
The demons not restraining Dean and Sam rushed around, pouring all the remaining ingredients into the large pot, which glowed and shook slightly. Alastair moved to stand in front of it, holding his hands up and chanting in a language that sounded older than time itself, his stolen face lit up by the bonfire in a pantomime of holiness. The demons around all sank to their knees in tandem as he said the last word, bowing deeply before the fire. There was a loud, sudden burst of lightning, and then nothing.
“Let me see,” Sam said, grabbing for the binoculars. Dean watched him scan down the line and realize the same thing Dean had.
Cas looked at him blankly. “I was planning to just sit here.”
“Nice night for it,” said Dean, who had already plunged into a soft snowbank, where he was now lying, smiling contentedly.
Christmas Eve,” Jo said. “Nor do they wait until the 23rd to get the stupid tree in the first place.”
piece of ass here. But what about Michael, Dean, how are we feeling about him?
“I suppose,” Cas said. Maybe it was Dean’s imagination, but Cas’s gaze seemed to be trained down slightly, eyeing his lips.
“Wait, what?” Dean said, making an effort to continue to pay attention to the road before him despite his very real urge to pull over and pay full attention to the conversation. “You knew about that and didn’t think it was important to tell me?”
done,” Gabriel said. “Like, never have I ever had sex with Sam. Who here has had sex with Sam?”
No, I don’t want Dean to turn into a demon, or say yes to Michael. I know him, and I know he won’t do either of those things, no matter how much a certain
a little distraction, and start drinking whiskey like it was a health drink that could cure him of all the ailments within. There was no alcohol in hell, after all, so he may as well get his fill while he could.
Dean cringed as Sam seemed to be attempting some kind of bow/handshake crossover. Castiel just looked at the offered hand in confusion, and Ruby rolled her eyes. Despite being out of hell for months now, Dean could still glimpse her true face whenever she made any facial expression besides her neutral one. It was always jarring, always reminding him that his brother’s judgement wasn’t necessarily sound at the moment.
Dean,” Sam said.
“Can we talk about it while I stab myself through the ear?” Dean said.
before.
“How delightfully middle school,” Gabriel said.
“I’ve seen this one, I’ll tell you the ending,” Gabriel said. “She forgives him, becomes a princess, and the blonde woman who was her rival ends up being exiled.”
“Is that good?” the angel said softly, voice so low and gritty that Dean felt a chill pass through his full body.
“On the contrary,” he said. “There is a demon on the loose that needs to be stopped.”
“Holiday cheer like… that dead mouse stapled to the ceiling?” Jo said, gesturing to an obscene figure Cas had somehow missed.
“Of course,” Jess said, getting up and smoothing her dress. “Sorry for boring you, Cas.”
“I’m sorry, man,” Dean said. “I shouldn’t have left you like that.” He had thought that Castiel would be right behind him -- in fact, the angel had promised he would be.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean said, pulling gently at his hair. “That’s amazing.”
“Let me get a couple things and be on my way,” Dean said. “I don’t want to hurt you, but I will.”
I think we’re supposed to play this out. Act how Gabriel wants us to.
Everyone eventually dispersed again to get dressed -- they were supposed to be “looking their best”, which hadn’t seemed like a big deal until Cas had received the news that at the party tomorrow they were supposed to somehow be looking even better. He hadn’t brought a suit or anything, but everyone else seemed to be prepared to dress to the nines, even Dean, who often took issue with this type of thing.
“They're playing what Gabriel describes as a ‘Christmas Eve drinking game’ in the kitchen,” Sam said, gesturing behind him. “I was sent to fetch you guys.”
“And let Sammy’s girlfriend mistake us for
Dean shrugged.
“All of it,” Dean said. “You’re not an angel. There’s no such thing. And there’s no way out of here.”
“You know each other?” Cas said, looking back and forth between Gabriel and Dean with comical speed.
Dean quickly brushed his teeth, splashed water onto his face, and gathered up his sparse belongings. “I’m ready,” he said.
“You picked a good vessel,” Dean said appreciatively, leaning down to lick up the shaft. Cas squirmed and muttered something Dean couldn’t make out.
too late for you! We can still have some fun before you die.”
“Okay,” Dean said. “So the demons were interested in her, then they went away, and now they’re back?”
“I just worry your information might be wrong,” Dean said. “This seems a little too easy.”
“Very clever,” Cas said thoughtfully. “May I try?”
One chapter left!!!!! Thanks to anyone still reading. I'm hoping to finish the next chapter soon, but it's sure to be a long one so it may be a week or so
“Don’t go too far, Dean,” Cas said, but he was laughing, not too worried.
Dean whistled appreciatively. “Taking no chances there, huh, Bobby,” he said.
Castiel considered that, and had to admit Gabriel might be a little bit right. Dean did actively avoid ‘chick flick moments’ (and always called them that, no matter how many times Castiel tried to convince him that it was hypocritical for Dr. Sexy’s biggest fan to be condescending about films intended for a female audience), and hadn’t been in a serious relationship in years. When had he ever seen Dean make a first move on a man, anyways? With women he was very comfortable being flirtatious enough to make everyone else in the room mildly nauseous, but with men, he tended to, well… choke.
Cas was clearly not kidding around, however, as he immediately resumed blowing Dean’s mind. Dean was embarrassingly quick to finish -- something about knowing that Cas had never done this before, combined with his display of power, managed to push buttons Dean hadn’t even realized he had. He spilled his load into Cas’s waiting mouth, almost more aroused by the situation than anything else.
the situation arise, if you catch my drift.”
Michael disappeared in a distressed
“Nah, you did, uh, fine,” Dean said, taping his best bow to Cas’s gift to Sam.
“This is no average demon,” Cas said, breaking eye contact. “Dean, are you aware that the demon Lilith has died?”
“So we have pet names for it already,” Bobby said. “Great.”
“You’ll have to trust me,” Cas said. “Now can you let me put these bags down?”
“Demonic omens have been everywhere lately,” Bobby mused. “More so than usual. Hard to keep track of ‘em all, almost.”
“You’re not going to spontaneously combust if you drink alcohol, right?” Dean said, leaning in to say it quietly. “Like, you can enter this bar?”
“Nope, just giving myself a makeover,” Dean said, infusing as much sarcasm and vitriol into his tone as possible. The man had barely spoken, but Dean already knew that he hated him. “Do you want to help me pierce my ear?”
“A moment” ended up being several hours long. The stakeout was boring for the first few hours, with Dean wanting to leave and try again elsewhere and Cas continuously insisting that the spell had worked and they just needed to wait some more. Dean eventually gave up on trying to change his mind and elected to pull out a deck of cards and teach Cas how to play cribbage. Cas initially seemed to think it was stupid, but he got increasingly competitive about it as they kept playing. Just when Dean had started to forget that they were waiting for a dangerous archangel, the winds outside began to pick up, the sky darkened several shades, and a vicious rain appeared out of nowhere and began pelting the side of the building.
“Wow, Cas,” Dean said. “You’re a real gentleman.”
close,” Jo said. “Just an hour off.”
Call Dean a skeptic, but Cas didn’t sound very puzzled at all. He made a mental note to ask about it next time he spoke to Cas alone.
“Alastair’s topside?” Dean said quietly. He felt as though his stomach had suddenly dropped several thousand feet.
CASTIEL
Cas pulled his fingers out slowly and pushed himself up to a standing position, the muscles in his shoulders rippling as he did so. Carefully, as if he were still thinking about whether or not he’d indulge Dean’s request, he unbuttoned his slacks and pushed them down, maintaining eye contact the entire time. Dean inhaled in anticipation.
Quick set of shots with Dean drinking beer with his brother, getting freed from heaven from Michael, being healed by Castiel.
Downstairs, Sam was buzzing around, attempting to cook for everyone while also handing out assignments and describing all that needed to get done during the day. Behind him, Jo was surreptitiously correcting his cooking mistakes, taking the bacon off the stove before it turned into a charred disaster and ensuring that filter paper wasn’t making it into the coffee.
“You think we should check it out?” Sam said.
“What the--” Dean started. His eyes had fallen closed, but now they snapped open, to see a very angry Cas hovering above him. They were in an entirely different place than before -- a desert, it seemed, as the cool night air had been replaced by scorching hot air, and the terrain all around them was sandy red. Dean was pinned on his back, and the sand underneath him was so coarse that he could feel it through his clothes.
“Course you can,” Dean said.
“No, it doesn’t,” Sam said.
A half hour later, they had a pile of somewhat lumpy, golden presents. Cas surreptitiously added to the pile his original gift for Dean, which he’d wrapped back in Boston, and Dean shot him a look.
“But like I said,” Cas said. “The situation hasn’t arisen, so I suppose…” He took an audible breath, glancing down at Dean’s lips in an unmissable tic. “I suppose I don’t know for sure.”
“Then why?” Dean said. “Why me? Isn’t there a whole army of souls in hell that would love to get out? Why did you pick
“I see that have have wasted no time in sullying your vessel,” Castiel said, gesturing to the tattoos showing through on Dean’s wrists.
“I’m not a man,” Cas said. “I’m a wavelength of celestial intent.”
But his eyes eventually adjusted to the near-complete darkness, and something about the quality of the wood didn’t seem like what he was used to in hell. Everything in the pits was like a bad dream -- dark and red, with all the details but the most agonizing and pertinent ones elegantly blurred out. It wasn’t something you’d notice in the moment, but here, with a comparison readily available, the difference was obvious. Dean shouldn’t be able to see the individual grains in the wood of the coffin. His legs and arms should already be cramping excessively from the limited range of motion. The coffin’s top should be converging threateningly on him.
a kink.”
"Merry Christmas Eve," Cas said.
Unable to argue with that logic, Dean lapsed into silence again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The timing wasn’t right,” Cas said.
“What about paper chains?” Sam said. “Charlie, you know how to make those, right?”
Cut to a series of quick shots of SAM WINCHESTER playing the role of LUCIFER. He flexes for the cameras, shows off his massive, skeletal wings, and winks at the camera as a building behind him explodes.
MICHAEL approaches Dean from a distance, still in the attractive blonde vessel, though he now has several burn marks up and down his arms.
Cas briefly disappeared. Dean heard a smashing sound, then a demonic scream, and Cas reappeared.
“That reminds me!” Sam said, and darted off to begin lighting all the candles that Dean had correctly predicted he had purchased. Looking at one enthusiastically burning candle called “Christmas Blessings”, Castiel had an unfortunate vision of Gabriel setting something in fire “on accident.” He wondered if Sam would notice if Cas moved all the candles to higher shelves.
, and as he clawed upwards, he could already tell that this particular onslaught actually had an end. A close one, too, judging by how quickly his outstretched hands managed to grasp at air and push against the ground. He gasped as he pushed his head through the hole he'd dug, pulling the rest of his body out of the ground and spitting out dirt. Clumsily, he rolled over and pushed himself into a standing position.
“Is that a rule?” Cas said, and laughed, for some reason.
“Wait,” he said, realizing something important. “Do
“Archangels are a different species entirely,” Cas said. “Imagine if an ant tried to trap you. Would you not squash it, regardless of what ‘side’ it was on?”
Luckily, he didn’t have to contemplate his limited options for long. A rustling at the lock told him that someone had come, either to rescue him or yell at him some more. Both options would at least distract him from the hellscape of negative thoughts raging in his brain. He groaned and pushed himself into a standing position, wondering if his full-body soreness was from the fight with Gabriel, the copious amounts of alcohol he’d drunk, or the sheer emotional damage of the evening.
“Normally the vessels have to offer permission,” Castiel said. “This being the realm of the damned, I was able to bend the rules and borrow this one, but I don’t have much time.” He stepped closer to Dean, looking deep into his eyes. Dean found himself unable to look away. “Will you join me in my escape?”
“Does he know that I’m back?” Dean said.
“You gonna punch me again, little bro?” Gabriel said, though his tone was gentle.
As it got dark, the members of the party slowly peeled off to their respective rooms -- an exhausted Sam first, then Jo and Charlie, who were both slightly jetlagged, then Bobby, who took Gabriel down with him.
“Eastern Colorado,” the guy said, looking towards the door. “Not too far from Limon.”
want that --”
“He can follow me,” Dean said. “He’s been following me for days.”
“Great,” Dean said. “Tell him to go fuck himself when you find him.”
“I gave everything to you,” Cas snarled. With another push, they were in a green valley, waterfalls visible in every direction and perfectly snow-capped mountains in the distance. Dean’s gaze flitted frantically back and forth, trying to pinpoint their location but also entirely unable to look away from Castiel’s burning eyes for longer than a millisecond.
“The devil never sleeps, Cas,” Dean responded, swinging himself out of bed and padding over to the bathroom. Cas checked a clock and found that it was actually just past eight, though the clouds in the sky were still thick enough to mostly obscure the morning sun.
The next morning, Dean woke up feeling refreshed, albeit a little vulnerable by the fact that he was still fully naked and Cas was sitting on the bed, fully dressed again.
“So,” Bobby said, looking on the attempt at festivity. “Breakfast?”
“It’s because of me,” Dean said. “He’s trying to fuck with me. He knew we would be here!” He put the binoculars down in alarm. “Wait, why did he know we would be here?”
“This is real,” Castiel assured him.
Ooh, so you're definitely planning on sending him home this week? Are we getting a spoiler?
Sam’s eyes slipped open, looking almost blue in the strange, angel-lit night. He seemed out of it, but focused on Dean quickly.
“Which friends?” Cas said.
“Precisely,” Cas said.
CASTIEL
“Are you sorry for the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth punch?” Besides a bruise on the side of his cheek, Gabriel luckily didn’t look too much worse for the wear. Cas supposed that being drunk had made his hits fall a little flatter than usual.
Dean found himself thinking of Ruby and wondering if that was actually the least insane thing Alastair had ever said.
Sam gave Dean a look like
(See the end of the chapter for
“They’re beautiful,” Dean said. “Should this be a joint gift as well?”
Sorry for the big delay on this one! health got real bad :/
“And Lucifer wants to bring hell to earth,” Dean said. “No one wants to just leave earth as it is. I got it.
“I--”
“You don’t sound like yourself, Dean,” Sam said. “What’s going on?”
“Will you help me, or not?” Cas said. He was sounding more and more stressed the longer he talked. “The other angels don’t understand why I oppose the plan. They grow tired of me… I stand out too much. I cannot make them help me. And there’s certainly no one else I can go to.”
The “ball” was alarming enough, but Castiel detected another alarming word in Gabriel’s sentence that required explanation.
HELLO, DEAN WINCHESTER.
“That’s it, then,” Dean crowed. “Crooked tree it is.”
So it was that on one random Sunday night, Dean chose
Luckily, Dean, Sam, and Bobby came in before the argument could escalate.
“I suppose,” Cas said. He was staring out the window absently, not seeming to take anything in.
“There’s a lot to say,” Cas said. “I should wait until your brother gets here.”
“Yes, shockingly,” Zachariah said. “Listen.”
MICHAEL
They were seated on two adjacent park benches somewhere in Minnesota, overlooking a small lake where ducks and other waterfowl were swimming around and squawking at each other. It hadn’t even been a full minute, and already the ducks seemed to be taking an interest in Castiel.
“Gabriel happened,” Cas said. “Can I sleep in here?”
“I’m here,” Dean said to the night sky. “Pattridge open space in Arvada, Colorado.”
to convince me?
“I will not say yes to Michael until I see my brother,” Dean said slowly. “Let me go. You have to let me go sometime, don’t you? Wouldn’t Michael be upset if you killed his true vessel?”
“Well, this room is barely habitable right now,” Charlie said. “We should clean it, for my sake.”
“Weren’t you already pretending to be helping?” Cas said.
“Even though Sam has a girlfriend now?” Dean said.
Gabriel glances quickly at Lucifer, then grabs Dean by the arm. The two disappear from the rose garden, and appear in a BROOM CLOSET.
“Oh really?” Dean said. “Did you also mean something different by befriending a demon? Am I wrong about your meaning there too?”
into Cas’s eyes even though he
“Okay, what date are we guessing for the proposal, then?” Gabriel said. “Let’s do that one first.”
“No, no, champ, you just stay right there,” Dean said, swinging himself back out of the booth. He ordered an entire bottle of the cheapest whiskey they had, and another pitcher of beer for himself.
“He’s just worried about you,” Cas said. “Much rests on your shoulders.”
“Sam is meeting us here,” Cas said. “You were nearly dead, so I had to remove you from the scene and heal you before anything else. By the time I got back, Sam had gone.”
Castiel sighed. “Stand back,” he said. He stretched out his arms and began glowing, that same blue color as his eyes had been before, and in an instant, the body the demon had created was gone, and a massive, skyscraper-sized glowing…
GABRIEL
They fled the store, but not before getting the bear spray for Bobby, an intricate (and expensive) Swiss army knife for Jo that they decided to offer as a joint gift, and an orchid for Jess.
sometimes happen. I was ordered to take you here because we have work for you, as I've told you already. But that work is not of import right now. You should go to Sam.”
“Oh, did you think we hadn’t found Sam immediately?” Alastair said, giggling. “How adorably naive. Bring him out, boys.”
“Did his name return to you?” Castiel said.
Miraculously, a gas station appeared after around an hour of walking. Soaked in sweat and nearly bowling over from how badly he needed water and food, Dean staggered into the place, looking, he guessed, like hell.
“He’s being useless, Cas, we should maybe go,” Dean said, eyeing the door.
“It’s not so bad under the lamp,” Dean said.
Dean slept a long, dreamless sleep, his first one in years and years. He woke up feeling pleasantly groggy -- at least, until he noticed that Cas was sitting on the bed next to him, watching him quietly. He snapped up into a sitting position, blinking rapidly.
Cas’s eyes softened just slightly, and they appeared and disappeared rapidly in an array of places -- an island in the middle of a lake, a McDonald’s where everything was written in a language Dean couldn’t recognize, a bustling, 10-lane road, a thick rainforest with trailing vines that whipped Dean in the face -- before landing in a deep, dark cave, so far back that Dean could only just see the spec of light that was the entrance in the distance.
“Yep, me,” the trickster said with a shit-eating grin. “Last time we spoke, I believe I was killing you repeatedly, isn’t that right, Dean-o?”
” Dean said. He hadn’t thought it would be that easy -- but then again, a lot of things seemed to be surprisingly easy with Cas.
“We have much to discuss,” the angel said.
“I don’t know, kiddo!” Gabriel yelled back. “But if you ask me, he isn’t going to save you, even if you do find him. If he isn’t going to come out of hiding for a fucking apocalypse, he sure as shit isn’t going to for a single disobedient angel, don’t you think?”
It really wouldn’t be all that funny, but Cas found himself doubling over with laughter anyways. “I need to sit down,” he said, collapsing into the floor model of the camping chair. He collapsed a little too far, though, and found himself halfway on the ground.
5x03 slapped but it could have slapped so much harder
Dean felt, rather than heard, Michael laugh gently at that. Dean’s fall seemed to be accelerating beyond what was physically possible, and he clamped his mouth shut to fight the sudden nausea.
He spun Cas around so quickly that Cas almost lost his balance, kissing him with an extravagant dip that left them both teetering slowly towards the floor. They fell into an undignified pile, but Dean was unshaken, looking up at Gabriel with a challenge in his eyes.
“We didn’t have a mistletoe,” Gabriel said innocently. “Don’t you think it would be wrong not to have a mistletoe?”
“They say anything about what that plan is?” Bobby said.
“I was simply wondering if I had done something wrong,” Cas continued, stumbling over his words a little. “I don’t know much about the mating rituals of humans--”
Was originally planning to have chapter 10 out tomorrow, but I got a migraine today so it might not be done in time :/
- Sam Winchester gave up all hope in the second half of the ninth month.
“What do they do at the end of Hallmark movies?” Gabriel said. He was enjoying this far too much.
“No, it’s Castiel,” Cas said, the phone making his voice sound even deeper and more crackly than usual.
? Much about this night was already a mystery to Cas, and he was still
REAL, DEAN WINCHESTER, IT IS NO FANTASY. YOU AND I MUST ACT NOW, BEFORE LUCIFER CREATES MORE DAMAGE THAT CANNOT BE REVERSED. HE HAS ALREADY CHAINED DEATH TO HIM. THE DAMAGE THAT HE CAN DO WITH DEATH’S POWER IS UNSPEAKABLE. SAY YES, DEAN. THE WORLD DEPENDS ON IT.
With a final stop to pick up every vaguely Christmas-related alcoholic item in the local grocery store, they were finally headed out of the mall and back out to Bobby’s. Christmas music trickled cheerily through the speakers of Dean’s car (supposedly Sam’s doing, but Cas noticed that Dean hadn’t bothered to change the station) as they carefully navigated the icy roads. Judging from the clouds above and the weather reports, it was going to start snowing very soon, and Cas hoped to be home before then.
He clenched his jaw, trying to keep his face neutral and his mind calm, though in truth he had no idea how he would be talking his way out of this one.
Cas paused for a moment, then nodded enthusiastically. “Yes, show me, please,” he said. “I would like to do that.”
of air. It had gotten to be so cold that Cas’s eyes began watering immediately upon exposure to the night air, and he shivered compulsively.
“Share warmth,” he muttered, his face already squished into the skin of Cas’s neck.
Well, Gabriel stuck us in the universe, so he can probably hear everything that happens in it, right? It seems like a shame to not make him as uncomfortable as possible, since we can't escape anyways.
“I don’t know,” Cas said with a sigh. “I'm not used to feeling such doubt, such lack of faith in my superiors. It is deeply disarming.”
“I have those sometimes,” Dean said.
Do you mean… Death?
Chapter 4 will be up tomorrow or day after :)
“What’s Christmas without a little stress?” Charlie said cheerfully. It was easy for her to put on a happy face -- she was by far the worst cook, so was in charge of the salad, which would probably take ten minutes, max, to put together. By contrast, Dean was in charge of the meat, which was a big enough job that Castiel had been assigned to be his assistant.
“He might actually find that useful,” Cas said. “That's a good idea. How about this water filter for Jo?”
“Are we putting presents under the tree yet?” Dean said. “Cause ours are
“What,” Dean gasped.
The producer tells Dean that they don’t air what happens in the fantasy suites, leaving it up to viewer imagination.
“Incredible,” Dean said, looking at him with awe.
So, should we take this reaction as a confirmation that Castiel is, indeed, a front runner in the race for your heart, despite the fact that he doesn’t offer any obvious means by which to save the world? Only promises to… “try to keep it the same”... God, how boring.
It ended up being much too easy to find Alastair. He was sitting in the middle of an abandoned warehouse, cross-legged and with his hands clasped in what looked like a prayer.
“I guess we’ll have to go that route, then,” Dean said. He insisted they pick up a few rolls of black ribbon to “balance it out,” then proudly paid for it, telling Cas he could get him back next year. First purchase done, they ventured back into the heart of the mall, getting jostled left and right by people in heavy coats with copious amounts of shopping bags.
“They might just decide not to get married,” Jo said. “Dean distrusts the government. I can’t see him wanting them involved in his life any more than they have to.”
“Whatever you say,” Cas mumbled.
They met at the diner again, Sam looking appreciably more pale than usual.
It was impossible to tell from his neutral tone if he was being serious or just fucking with Dean.
driving into town on a very icy road, arguing about their plan of attack. Dean was all for just pulling off to the side of the road and hacking down the first pine tree that they saw. Cas thought that most of the pines were much too tall, and probably illegal to cut down, anyways.
Cas manhandled Dean carefully, so that he was lying on the bed with Cas hovering over him, seemingly reluctant to pull away even a little. Dean was happy with that arrangement, letting himself get absorbed in each little touch, each little nibble, the feel of a body on top of him. Like the last time, he was able to forget all the existential shit he’d been worrying about within approximately five seconds of touching Cas. It was a miracle, really, a gift the angel possessed that Dean had never quite seen before.
After a quick lunch break, during which Gabriel treated Cas to a headache-inducing account of all the ways in which Sam had gotten finer with age and was now more eligible than ever, Dean was gesturing Cas out of the house with a false sense of urgency that probably fooled no one but Sam.
“Nah,” he said, sitting up. “How’d you know I was here?”
Clearly seeing that Castiel might agree with him, Gabriel chuckled and gave him a reassuring pat of the shoulder. “You’ll have to make the move here, buddy, unless you’d like to be single and pining away until you die. And I suggest you make the move. Sounds a lot more fun.”
“She’s a demon,” he said.
“How can it
“You missed two,” he said.
trip over them, knock over a candle, and start a small fire. His brother’s ability to place things in just the right spot to cause the maximal amount of chaos never ceased to amaze.
“Cas has been MIA,” Dean said. “He’s looking for God still, I think… where’s Ruby?”
It felt wrong to ambush Dean with a confession right before they went to sleep, so that option was out. But if he did it before night, it would probably still be too awkward for them to sleep in the same room anyways, so he’d be stuck on the couch. That would just add insult to injury. Maybe he could do it right before everyone showed up for the party? Then there could be a distraction readily available, and the whole thing could pass peacefully.
Alfie looked mildly terrified at being addressed. When he realized that they actually expected him to respond, he said, “The crooked one is marked down.”
It was harder than usual to raise the blade to the soul now. Every time he did, Dean briefly imagined it was Castiel again, and then he was thinking about all that the angel had said, and wondering if it could possibly be true, if there was a way out. But hope didn’t live very long in hell, and good thing too, because Castiel had told Dean not to draw attention to himself, and nothing would be more suspicious than a broken man suddenly believing. So he stopped believing in Castiel, and when the angel did come back to him later, and then again, and again after that, he started and stopped believing in him every single time.
bad dreams.”
Castiel studies the photo. “ You’re suggesting a more personal relationship.”
When it was all over, when they both realized that a year of playing house- no matter how peaceful and happy- wasn’t what Dean actually needed in his life at that moment, Lisa had told him she understood. That it was okay. But that Ben deserved better. And Dean agreed. Just like he’d silently agreed at the beginning to go along with Lisa’s lie about Ben’s father. Because Dean knew the truth and he still couldn’t bring himself to challenge her on it. To even be mad about it. It wasn’t his right.
For a very brief time he’d thought he’d found that in Lisa, the same year of that devastating wreck. Nearly a decade before, they’d had an amazing one night stand in Cicero, Indiana when Dean was passing through on his way to bail his father out of jail, again. She was nineteen, in her freshman year of college, her whole bright life ahead of her. He was barely a year older and still looking out for Sammy and still cleaning up after John. Nine years later, he was passing through Indiana again, this time in a loaner POS of Bobby’s, and couldn’t resist the pull of nostalgia that had him looking her up and knocking on her front door. And she’d let him in. Smart, beautiful, caring Lisa Braeden. And her eight-year-old son, Ben.
Oh! Jack almost forgot to wash his hands!  He puts his stool in front of the sink. The sink is very high so Jack stands on his very tippy toes and pushes the shiny handle and waits for the water to get warm and one, two, three...four soap squishes from the bottle. This soap smells like clean things. His bath soap smells like strawberries. But the sink soap makes bigger bubbles.
and the bear growls again and the bear is in Daddy’s bed!
Castiel frowns, finger pausing over his mouse. He should delete the message, without opening it. He really should. He has been for a few months now, the same email address popping up in his inbox every week or so, randomly. Despite blocking it after the first four or five just out of irritation. The messages themselves weren’t anything special nor gave any hint to their sender; other than someone who has mistaken Castiel’s cryptic email address (he’d made sure his work email did not follow the typical government format in order to stem the flow of press inquiries and trolls) for someone they’re acquainted with.
It’s an old conversation. Rowena is senior staff, having survived budget cut downsizing and personality conflict driven firings for the last forty years, whether by witchcraft or luck, she’s the one constant at Hunters Hollow Public Library. And Zachariah hates anyone he can’t control, so he is very keen on getting rid of the woman, by hook or crook. Which would leave Garth to step into her role and Zachariah doesn’t care for the young man’s sweet and messy nature. And with the appearance of Castiel, with his questionable celebrity status and office personality closer to what Zachariah approves of, the older man has mistakenly assumed that he’s found an accomplice in his petty mission to usurp Rowena from her rightful position.
to the ongoing birthday list he keeps on his cellphone. Jack’s list is mostly building toys and books.
So naturally he isn’t. Going that is.
“ Thank you, Mr. Cain.”  Claire bobs her head, then turns to her father. “ I’m going to wait on the couch for you, Dad.” She slips from the chair and tosses a,  “Goodnight, Mr. Cain,” over her shoulder before leaving the room.
Jack pushes a little harder, but there are only little drops now. He shakes his penis, like Daddy showed him, to get all the pee out so he doesn’t get his clean pull-up wet. Jack spins the toilet paper and he tears off a lot but then he remembers Daddy told him to, “ just use a little,” so Jack squishes all the toilet paper until it sits on top of the big roll and tears off a teeny tiny little piece and wipes his penis and drops the teeny tiny little piece of toilet paper into the yellow water.
“ Hey, sweetheart.”
“ Glad to see the weather hasn’t gotten them down,” Cain interrupts from the open doorway, hands full of a large pan, a small bag hanging off his elbow. “ Though I suppose the rain merely escalates their energy while indoors.”
January rolls on and Dean hits an age milestone.
” and--”
“ Go back a year and see what she was up to when she first started coming here.” Charlie suggests.
A wide band of blush pink lace. Shiny matching pink fabric below. Both incredibly soft to the touch and Castiel guesses microfiber because Meg had similar ones years ago and Dean hasn’t cautioned him to be careful with them as he surely would if they were authentic- and expensive- silk.  It’s a modest cut, though Castiel isn’t familiar with its official designation. Briefs? Hipsters? The waistband sits a couple inches below Dean’s navel, thin dark hair diving under the lace. The leg openings are not too high or tight, easily following the joinings of the pale thighs. Castiel runs his thumb up along the edge of one, then pushes the tip under the seam on the way back down.  The skin beneath is sinfully silky. He glances up at Dean, wanting to check on the younger man who has been uncharacteristically quiet.
“ Jess said you were practically bouncing when you came in and there was enough pep in your voice to confirm it, so… what have you and Big Daddy been doing for you to be all chipper and shit?” She laughs between nibbles of onion ring that Zeke places on the edge of her plate every few minutes.
“ Don’t get too attached, little man. It’s coming off when Jess has the baby. It’s just a pregnancy beard.” Dean leans into the touch though, allowing Jack total access to his whiskers; including rubbing his chin against the grain on Dean’s cheek.
Dean groans, making sure it’s audible enough for the blind woman to hear. “ Nothing. I just played with the kids for a few minutes before I left the house.” He stirs his thick stew, watching the vegetables and hunks of andouille surface and sink. Definitely not thinking about Cas’ bright smile or the way it made him feel all light and bubbly inside. “ They’re good kids.”
“ Din oh Daddy.” Jack repeats.
There’s just enough room for Castiel to crawl between the grass and broken metal and reach into this busted out window for the younger man inside. He seems in and out, a gash in his hairline bleeding profusely, face smeared in blood from a slew of smaller cuts. His eyes blink almost sleepily at Castiel’s hands on his upper arms. The older man must’ve gotten the younger out of his seatbelt, the poor guy slumped against the roof of the vehicle. Castiel has to lean in further to get a better grip on the man’s arms and as he yanks him free of the wreckage, he feels something scratching through his shirt, from between his shoulder blades and down his right arm to his elbow. It’s a vague, distant sensation and Castiel ignores the pain in favor of dragging the dead weight as far from the wreck as possible, mostly toward his own car parked a reasonably safe distance from the inferno. The young man- Dan he thinks he heard the other call him- begins to struggle in his grasp and Castiel tightens his grip and continues until he’s on the other side of his car.
each time. Dean tells him it’s okay and waits until the bulk of wet clothing is in before scooping up the fallen and tossing them on top of their kin. Then he leans down to search the washer interior for anything plastered to the sides.
They both stand and clear their places of trash before leaving the store. Dean holds the door open for Cain, he has no idea why except that Cain always used to hold the door for him when they were together. The sun is higher, hence the temperature has risen into the high eighties and the humidity is practically visible in the air. Dean’s t-shirt is already damp under his arms. They walk towards the edge of the parking lot, Cain making a broad gesture toward an old brown Jeep parked a few spots away from Baby.  Dean automatically leans left toward the Jeep and they continue in companionable silence until they reach the Jeep’s driver’s side door. Cain pulls his keys free from his pocket and turns to Dean.
“ I do. And that’s why I don’t want to leave my reply to your beautiful promise unspoken.”
Claire and Jack begin a discussion about what foods taste better when they’re older and Dean and Cas listen from the sidelines, providing information when asked. They smile indulgently over the children’s heads, socked feet in constant motion.
Currently, Gabriel is removing all the twist ties and plastic brackets holding Jack’s toys in their boxes before haphazardly wrapping them in red and green striped paper.  Jack was very patient last Christmas, but it had taken Castiel nearly an hour just getting toys out of their packaging, the items so tightly held in place by an inordinate amount of strappings it made it impossible for the toddler to do it on his own. Gabriel had mentioned the pre-wrapping removal trick (on recommendation from Kali’s sister, mother of three) and offered to make the presents more toddler friendly.
Castiel opens the messenger app and pulls up the long running conversation with Dean.
This must be the compromise Cas had been talking about. A picture of Nicholas Adler that Jack calls father even though he doesn’t really understand the distinction. Not at the moment, anyway. To Jack, it’s just the last picture in the book. But to Claire…
“ Could Dean get a puppy?”
He just wants one nice goddamn holiday where everyone gets along or is at least fucking civil to each other. Where Sam doesn’t have to worry about bringing his girlfriend home. Where Dean doesn’t have to make a choice between seeing his kid brother and fulfilling his obligations to his father.
When Castiel stands, glancing at his brother, no words are exchanged as Gabriel moves into Castiel’s seat to supervise Jack as Castiel quietly follows Dean into the dimly lit hallway. He catches the younger man’s arm before he escapes into the bathroom and leads him into his own bedroom, silently closing the door behind them.
Cain takes the entire thing and pats Dean’s back with his unoccupied hand, leaving it in place for long comforting moments. “ I’ll keep it at my cabin. No reason for the children to ever know of its existence.”
since he picked John up from the drunk tank in Sioux City. Dean is honestly shocked his father even made it that far to Bobby’s before getting picked up. Even more shocked that John had made an effort to visit for the holiday weekend, especially knowing that Sam would be there as well. Dean’s heart wants to believe that Sam’s presence is the reason why the eldest Winchester was making his way back, but he doesn’t hold out much hope. About as much as he has for John staying sober after this last run in with the law.
“ Ass.” Dean name calls, arm thrown over his flushed face, chest heaving.
Dean and Cas continue their New Year's Day activities.
Castiel chuckles. “ I think he’s asking for a grape ice pop.”
“ Cas?” Something hard and cold is poking his shoulder. “ Iss Gabe.”
“ I know you do. Thank you, Dean.” Castiel squeezes Dean’s raised forearm, then half-shouts toward the rest of the house. “ I’ll be back in a little bit.”
“ Here. Socks first, Grumpy.” Dean reaches toward the foot of the bed where Castiel notices, for the first time, his neatly folded university hoodie topped by a thick pair of dark gray socks.
There’s a flash of something warm and spicy, but Dean shakes it off, embarrassed, and answers confidently. “ Duh. Harvelle’s Roadhouse, New Year’s Eve, 2010, five seconds til midnight. You asked if you could kiss me and I nearly bit my tongue trying to answer before Ellen finished the countdown.” He takes another huge bite of cornbread and adds a spoonful of venison chili, grinning brightly in between. It’s an awesome memory that he’s held onto very tightly for a very long time.
Cain seems to come to a decision and takes a good breath before speaking. “ I have a place you could rent and--” he raises a hand to stop any protest. “ And this is not a romantic overture or some attempt at reliving the past, I promise. I have a house that I’m currently renting to a single parent family, but there’s an apartment attached. It’s not far from your brother and sister-in-law. I do live on the property, but on the opposite side, at the lakefront, so there is plenty of … space. This is a favor, between friends.”
Cas retaliates by swiftly pinning Dean’s foot beneath his own, somewhere in the middle of the empty space under the table.  Dean’s attention is taken by Jack’s diatribe about the day’s visit to the grocery store, creating a pause in the footsie battle.  As he listens to Jack trying to describe some sort of breakfast cereal, Dean is very much aware of Cas’ foot raising up, relieving some of the pressure on his toes. And then Cas is sliding the ball of his foot down Dean’s instep, then back to circle his ankle. Slowly, gently.
“ Yes.”
Alex stares at Dean with his dark blue eyes, tiny face scrunched in a laugh. Or a poop. Dean will find out eventually. The baby is snuggled happily in a bouncy seat on the floor at the edge of the kitchen, out of range of Dean as he cooks up his dinner on the stovetop.
“ I do, yes, but I don’t think it’s been the main reason for me not pursuing Dean.” Castiel glances around the floor and finds the matching cupboard door. He pulls it close, but merely lets it rest on his thigh, as he voices his worries. “ It’s the fear. Being afraid of something happening to anyone I get close to. It’s already paralyzing, just thinking about what could happen to the children. I don’t want to add to that.”
“ You’re crying, too.” Claire is quick to point out when they reach the end.
Castiel doesn’t want to entertain any other alternative, but the fatalistic side of him points out that the very first ones began arriving just after the court denied Nick’s request for visitations with Jack. There’s a restraining order, of course. No contact whatsoever with Castiel or the children, minimum of one thousand feet distance at all times. But Nick has managed to wiggle his away around plenty of rules and laws and semi-threatening emails would be the least of his accomplishments.
“ Hey, Cas.” Dean happily gives back his own wave.
“ You and Dean, you dope.” Charlie rolls her eyes, her whole body moving with it, and pats her knees in emphasis. “ Give me the deets. I rewatched your little episode on the cameras Halloween night and you two were totally adorable!”
Dean watches over the lasagna and the kids while Cas changes out of his suit- and god damn, if the man isn’t all kinds of James Bond fantasies fuckable in the slim cut outfit- and into house jeans and a ratty university sweatshirt. Then Dean trots home and removes his own too snug for comfort outfit in favor of the loose jeans he’d been wearing earlier in the day and his only clean halfway decent shirt; a black long sleeve henley with a bleach stain on the shoulder that he only wears around the garage now. Laundry is top of his list tomorrow morning.
“ I can see that,” Castiel nods in affirmation.
Ah, yes. Castiel can’t help but smile down at his daughter, hand tugging gently at her long blonde braid that he is very proud to have nearly mastered after three years. “ Very true. We’ll see how that works out.” In fact, he has already asked Charlie for assistance in choosing a LARP level costume and set of gear for the little girl, so Castiel makes a mental note to add
“ Uh, okay?” Dean is still frowning at the information. Overreacting tiger moms and clueless dads usually elicit jokes and eye rolls. Dean has to wonder what this guy’s story is that’s gotten him the sympathy vote from the normally straightforward, no nonsense Alex. He scratches at his jaw beneath his short beard and shrugs.“ No scolding, pour on the charm.”
Once the fabric is thoroughly soaked with his saliva and Dean is panting hard and fast, Castiel decides to move on. He carefully slides the panties down, tucking them under Dean’s sensitive balls. Castiel had gotten a few glimpses of Dean’s lovely cock earlier, before things became too intense, but he appreciates this chance for a closer inspection. The satiny head with a prominent flare, traceable veins along the shaft, a neatly trimmed patch of coarse hair at its base. Castiel gently fondles the pliant sac. Dean rewards him with a small moan and firm touch to the back of his hand, encouraging more contact. Castiel happily complies by curling his tongue underneath and rolling a firm orb into his mouth. It’s even better without the fabric barrier; contrasting textures of hair and skin, taste of salt and hint of soap. Dean curses under his breath, his hands flexing on Castiel’s shoulders. His cock swells even more, right in front of Castiel’s face, filling out completely and bobbing slowly over his navel. Castiel watches it- and Dean’s face- as he gives the same fond treatment to the other testicle.
