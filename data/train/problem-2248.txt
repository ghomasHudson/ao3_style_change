John selected another sweet and placed it in his mouth. Then he grinned and dipped his head down to his lover so they could each have a hummed and chewed, then swallowed it down. He prodded Sherlock's middle as it arched up into his own.
Sherlock grunted in annoyance as he completely missed the test tube and sent the irreplaceable sample dribbling to the floor. A week's work! Wasted! The tall, slim detective let out a low growl and then dumped a weak base over the spill to neutralize the lost sample. He would clean it up later. Right now, Sherlock needed to have a word with John, who by the sound of it, was currently demolishing the entire kitchen.
! God I just.." Sherlock trailed off, crammed the rest of his doughnut into his mouth, his concave belly rounding out to press lightly against his tight, silk shirt
"I don't see anything," he snapped finally, sounding angrier than he had intended. Truly, he had been more than a little distracted. But if he had to watch that one more time he might just burst. It was almost worse with the sound off. He kept hearing Sherlock's voice repeating the words. What the hell was that about?!
“Open,” John directed, lifting a large sugary doughnut from its box. Sherlock obeyed, plush pink lips parting and allowing John to shove the doughnut into his mouth. He chewed sluggishly then swallowed and leaned back, belly gurgling audibly even through the door.
John shoved his still clothed cock hard against Sherlock’s plump thigh and snaked his hands up to cup the man’s soft breasts, pinching the nipples that stood out against the fabric of his shirt.
"Mmm... Could be even better though," the detective replied, giving his stomach a sharp pat.
At last, John couldn't eat another bite. He fell back in his chair, trying to take some of the pressure off his stomach. He tried to breath shallowly, doing his best to suck in his massively overfull middle. He tugged at his shirt, now wishing that he had gone with his usual jumper rather than the button up that was now pulling tightly around his belly.
*****
Sherlock screams.
"Well, like I said," said John, smiling and glancing over. " We’re mates. I care about you, you stupid git." He chuckled to take the edge off the words. It was rather a lot like an "I love you".
"God yeah," John answered, flopping back against his chair where he slumped down and closed his eyes with a sigh, hand still on his middle. "For Mary."
John! Please
It was true that Sherlock Holmes could often be rather brash. His comments could be brutal in their honesty or simply intense in their onslaught. Still, it was rare that he actually succeeded in reducing Molly to tears. She understood that he often didn’t realize that his words could cut her to the quick. John had helped a bit. He both seemed to temper Sherlock and offer the needed condolences to anyone subjected to the detective’s rapier of observations. Still, it had been a bad week and his offhand comment on how she must be a bad pathologist indeed to not know exactly how her cat had died last month had been the blow that finally burst the dam.
John swallows. "Sherlock, just stay there. You're safe," he murmurs, eyes on the other man.
He sniffed them, then stared. They didn’t look to be so
Sherlock waddles over to the wall behind the throne-fit-for-his-fat-ass and gives it sharp whack with his wide hip, and a panel flies open, revealing a hallway illuminated by soft light at the end.  The sounds of an angrily squeaking chair and a "Wait, where are they?!" are heard, along with a soft chuckle from a female voice.
Sherlock stood, trying to make his coat puffier, demanding Lestrade to leave the windowless room and to have no one disturb him.
"We need to find Moriarty." John says it as if he’s just remembered that they need to pick up some shopping on the way home. He looks around the room, but the imps are gone, likely crawled off somewhere to nurse their wounds. The doctor realizes he is still in Sherlock’s arms, pressed up against him.
"A guess suffice? Crime of passion? Self defense? Forgotten safeword or framed?"
He reached his hand down, grunting, and grabbed another carton, emptying down his gullet. He looked around to the once trim, fit officers, each one his own size or large, panting, buttons and pants burst, on the round, moaning as their now enormous guts shifted and jiggled.
"Sherlock?" he called, tugging off his jacket and hanging it up as he came in, "What are you up to?"
I hope you enjoy this fic as much as I enjoy rping and chatting with you! I am endlessly glad you exist.
He tries to smile, tries to get Sherlock to buck up. He takes the detective’s hand.
"Oh, bugger, almost forgot about the gingerbread. They'll need icing." He stood and stripped off the rest of his costume, then went to the kitchen. He stood before the large tray of undecorated gingerbread. He looked down at his middle, prodded the muscles, then ate each and every one of the cookies before him as he iced them, his stomach protesting and gurgling by the time the next batch had been baked.
“I’m John,” he says pointedly, matching Sherlock’s gaze with his own, “Your captain.”
"Eat up."
He quietly pets the back of the man’s sandy-blonde hair, making him nestle into his soft shoulder.
"Holy shit."
John smirked and dug his hands in. "You're on."
John growled happily, shaking his arse, his hips jiggling, love handles wobbling, tits dancing as he tucked into more food greedily.
It crackles, the now dead man is panting.
John made a small noise of agreement. He shifted under the blanket, wishing he could undo his shapewear and his trousers and just let it all hang out, pat and play with his chubby gut, feel it in his palms.
He found a hastily scribbled note on his laptop. Oh, so a case then. John sighed and pulled his jacket back on. Looked like Sherlock's 'punishment' would have to wait. Damn.
John’s initial relief at seeing the detective has long worn off. The tape only confirms what he’d feared. Oh God, no.
"I did. A lot," John murmured, his hands sliding down Sherlock's sides and cupping that round bloated belly in his hands. Sherlock gasped softly and leaned into John, their too-full middles adding even more delicious pressure.
“Course,” said John, cuddling up to his lover further. “And I’m all yours.”
John looks back up at Sherlock, trying to see if the man is still in pain. Christ, how did they manage to get into this mess.
Sherlock huffed as he struggled into his corset, slipping on a tight tee, then his robe, and waddling downstairs, compressions shorts the only thing keeping his thighs from rubbing together
“Sorry for what?”
Then he pushed the material down, his pectorals soft and swaying under padded shoulders. Then a large round and fat belly blorped into being, jiggling and wobbling as he pushed the tight material down past it, love handles expanding as his gut sagged out and down. John groaned and gave his belly a hard slap, sending it dancing, then slipped a finger in to play with his wide deep navel, tickling the golden hairs that were scattered around it.
Molly realized her mouth was open and that things were likely to become very personal and private very soon. She closed her mouth and hurried off as quietly as she could as soft sounds of rhythmic grunting and thumping signaled Sherlock obtaining his reward.
"No, it's perfect."
what might happen, fat arse?" Moran drawls.
“I- what? No… “
He had watched it until he had it memorized. Until he closed his eyes and saw it playing on his eyelids, until he could envision Sherlock and himself in their places.  He wondered how close to a big gut like that he was. He wet his lips.
“Of course you are,” Sherlock replies, opening his eyes wide and blinking at John innocently. “I’m merely looking after my captain.”
By the fifth cinnamon bun, Sherlock feels nauseous, and by the seventh he’s in pain. He never eats this much, hasn’t in his entire life, his trim stomach bloated to a hard dome under his tight shirt. Another tape begins to play over the intercom.
"See good aren't they?" Said Greg, smiling and picking up another for himself as he leaned back to eat it.
“All taken care of,” Greg says, the silver fox beaming as he pats a massive white box beside him. He flips it open and helps himself, crumbs tumbling down onto his shirt and tie, his jacket left open to accommodate the great swell of his gut.
John looks up at the ceiling, small flecks of dust disturbed from their resting place.
The second is a group of seven twenty-something-year-olds, all male again aside from one girl at the very end, all essentially fit and strong, or thin and wiry, holding bits of camera equipment or microphones - a documentary team perhaps. The man in the middle sassily poses a tape recorder to his mouth, and he’s the only one among them that’s chubby - looking about twenty or so pounds overweight
"There's still dessert," Sherlock purred, walking his fingers along John's belly.
Thoughts began to flood Sherlock's mind for a moment, "How would he X and Y" but suddenly Greg's lips were on his and he was in heaven
"Fuck! Fuck yes! John you'll look tiny by the time I'm done gorging, we'll be the fattest men in New London! In the world!" He growled, belly snapping open his trousers, the buttons of his shirt, flooding it against John's enormous, caramel mountain. His bony chest swelled to budding breasts, then full, fat tits, short falling to the floor in tatters around him
"Oh- Oh Christ, Sherlock! Please, yes!" he whimpered at the teasing, the loss of contact. He looked down at Sherlock with pupil darkened eyes, begging to feel those plush wet lips around him again.
He smirked as Greg grunted and groaned, leaning against the wall to get to his feet, his belly clearly pulling him off balance, his soft barrel of a chest looking even wider as he stood, his chubby face scrunched up with effort. Greg reached down to help Sherlock, his other hand supporting his own gut. It still flopped and jiggled tantalizingly against his cock.
Absolutely perfect.
He smiled and accepted his new cup, eyeing Sherlock. He looked healthier lately, there was a glow to his skin, a sheen to his hair, a softness in his eyes.
As the corset hit the floor, Sherlock felt himself go rock hard. His massive gut flopped forward, spilling over his compression shorts and into the open air, hanging before him like a quivering mound of dough, an ocean of warm, soft cream.
"F-urp- fuck yeah," John belched, then chuckled, laying back with a moan, his overfull belly arching high above him. He reached for Sherlock's belly as well, groping and squeezing at it.
"Want some?" he offered his flat mate, "I made extra."
," he purred back, nibbling John's jawline, "I
"C'mon you!" the soldier snarls, keeping Sherlock behind himself. "Just try!"
John returned a half hour later, his purchase in a brown paper bag. He hesitated a moment, pondering. No, better not to give Sherlock even a chance to deduce what he was doing before he revealed the surprise. He ducked into Mrs. Hudson's and changed, pulling a pair of baggy red trousers up over his jeans and stepping into black boots. He slung on the roomy red and white coat and did it up. Maybe he should have gotten it a size down, but that hadn't seemed to fit his muscular shoulders properly. He pulled on a white fluffy beard and pulled the hat onto his head. He looked absolutely ridiculous, John thought, pulling on black gloves as well. Still, if it got a smile out of Sherlock...
"Sure thing, boss," Moran purred, trailing his fingers along Moriarty's chin. He tapped the glass of the car and the driver slid the hatch open.
Sherlock whimpered and kissed John hungrily, rutting instinctively against John’s hip. John kissed him back, slotting a leg between Sherlock’s, tangling his fingers in Sherlock’s hair.
I will. You don't need to wait for me to ask."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, but not until too late,” Victor confessed. “When his people broke me out. One of them let slip that they were going to frame you, convince everyone that you’d been my accomplice the whole time. And then I knew, and I decided to do something about it.”
“It’s alright, Victor,” Sherlock hushed, a hand on his shoulder. You don’t have to-”
“You defended me.” Sherlock looked at him, then, with a look John hadn’t seen since that night while he was bleeding out on the kitchen floor. “No one’s ever defended me. No one. Not even him.”
Sherlock rolled onto his back, luxuriating in the chaos of hormones crashing through his system. He squinted at the bright bathroom light and closed his eyes, listening to the sound of John moving around, running water. It was lulling- Sherlock felt tired in a way he knew he could very easily become addicted to, if he hadn’t already.
“I’d like to see the security footage,” Sherlock requested. “If you’re going to keep me prisoner, the least you could do is let me help you catch him.”
John was tempted, oh so tempted, to run downstairs and see what Sherlock's suit looked like. He could do it so easily.
“If you ever forget, then I’ve failed you.” John closed the distance, just for a moment, just for a kiss, slow and soft, until the cot frame groaned and tipped and he had to lean back to his own side.
sure of, though- if Sherlock hadn't known the true extent of John's feeling before that day at Battersea, he must know now. John had tried to be inconspicuous in his attachment, of course, but he had always known he was never much good at hiding things like desire or jealousy, and Sherlock was more observant than anyone John had ever tried to hide those kinds of things from. John thought of his feelings for Sherlock as an open secret, something that was known but was never meant to be discussed.
Sherlock stood a short while after, leaving John groaning and reclining, with his trouser button undone. He returned with a pumpkin and a pecan pie and loads of whipped cream, setting them out on the table. He cut them each a slice of both and doused them in whipped cream before passing one to John. The army doctor groaned, but wriggled himself upright, propping the dish on his distended gut as he kept eating slowly but methodically.
John lets out a whine, blushing at the sound. He really has got to stop doing that. Breaks character.
John breathed in and let his breath flow out, humming as he felt the man's desire continuing to grow. He shook his hips, love handles jiggling in Sherlock’s hands.
Sherlock’s eyes dart to it, his mind starting to go fuzzy. He wobbles after John as the doctor leads the way about the room. The giggle comes again, and as the two of them reach the head of the table, there’s another tape, this one from the documentary crew.
"Don't you think you've had enough?" he asked, clapping a hand on Sherlock's arse and delighting in the way it caused ripples to dance through the new flesh.
He huffed in annoyance.
,"  she says more forcefully, one sharp hand grabbing Sherlock’s ass hard enough to bruise, the other pushing him backward into the pool, where two other sirens rise up, grab him by the arms, and move Sherlock towards the chocolate faucet.
Then he tears off another, then another, his belly steadily rounding out, and he makes sure not to hold back a loud, wet belch.
“I- Yes.” John nods, swallowing the ‘sir’ before it can escape him. He goes to collect new clothes for himself, mind still in a heady daze. He doesn’t notice his reflection as he pulls out a fresh pair of pants and jeans, doesn’t see that the briefs are hugging his arse rather tightly, nor that a handsome muffin top spills over his waistband after he struggles to do them up, nor that his middle and chest seem to jiggle as he tugs a jumper down over his head. He doesn’t even notice that his jumper now rounds out where it once skimmed over flat abs. What John does notice, is that he’s feeling rather peckish.
John’s eyes widen and he nods eagerly, stuffing down his doughnut at double time. He pauses only to ask, “And if I- urmph- get through a whole dozen?”
Tears roll down Sherlock’s face as each remarks stabs into the detective’s heart, but he’s worried John’ll get mad again, so he looks down and tries to sob as quietly as he can.
He tucked in to keep up appearances of not having just eaten more than his fair share of crisps and biscuits and other snacks. His belly gurgled in protest, swelling out further between his opened trousers, still hidden beneath his blanket.
John laughed. "No. Course not. It's just-"
"You okay?" John asked, still rubbing and pressing gently at Sherlock's middle. The detective nodded and removed his hand to speak but all that came out was yet another loud burp. Sherlock flushed. John only laughed and rubbed more purposefully.
John is addicted to danger
"Mm, thanks. Wanna rub? Hurp-Hurts a bit," John mumbled, snatching at Sherlock's hand the next moment and pressing it against his gut. Sherlock felt himself trembling. He swallowed and slowly began caressing the tightly stretched skin. John's belly. John's warm overstuffed perfect-
"That...makes sense. In a way. Yzram was drowned in the deprivation chamber, whip marks across his back. But...
John smiled and slipped the ring onto Sherlock's finger, then chuckled into their kiss before it left him breathless.
"Cheers!" Jim purred, biting into the treat, then realizing his eyes going wide, "You-"
“Hogs don’t use their hands, dear,” he says lightly. Greg nods  and then eagerly tucks in, face first, his lips and cheeks covered in icing and crumbs. John stares, then jumps as he feels Sherlock slap his own arse.
In the control room, a lone button bursts off the too-tight pants of James Moriarty, startling the grey eyes watching  into focusing on him rather than the doctor and the detective on screen. Moriarty doesn’t notice, instead cackling wickedly
Sherlock stuttered, trying to take a step back, trying to escape that heavenly feeling, hellishly tempting ocean of caramel cream
"Mm, yes please," he purred, dipping his head down to give John's lower lip a teasing nip. "Now come on. I've been wanting you to fuck me since you couldn't get your trousers to close."
"Neither did you," John retorted, smiling softly as Sherlock loaded the deliciously starchy golden things onto his own plate.
"Still...you always look out for me," Sherlock said, finishing his slice, "It's....I don't thank you enough." His tummy gurgled as it rebelled against his fifth slice, one pizza almost gone between the two swelling men.
"From the serial robberies? Not really. I watched the thing half a dozen times." Then two dozen more after that.
"It is," Sherlock agreed, rather breathlessly. He selected another roll and offered it to John at the next opportunity. Clearly John wanted to eat, was planning to regardless of Sherlock's help. He could enjoy this. Just tonight.
John chuckled and was about to pocket the bite. Then he reconsidered.
"They can be," John agreed, frowning and feeling sad for poor little Sherlock being mocked for still believing in Father Christmas when all the others had had that snatched away from them.
He growled eagerly, reaching around behind to grab Sherlock's arse as he straightened again. His own portly body squashed flush with Sherlock's, his cock hard and pressing into plump thighs.
But they seemed to linger.
Sherlock rubbed his nose against the other man's.
“Sorry, my- Sherlock’s calling me,” John says, bobbing his head to Greg and seizing another three doughnuts before rushing off to Sherlock’s side. He catches a glimpse of that same smile on Greg’s face again as he hurries off but he doesn’t waste time contemplating it this time.
"I love you too," he said simply, then grinned, "If that was your best day, well, what's burgers and ice cream in bed going to rank as?"
"Yes," he whispered, giving the man's lips another peck.
*****
Sherlock toppled into laying on the sofa as John stumbled up, too drunk to pull back his lean.
He let out a squeal at his ass being slapped, then a moan, "D-do that again" He asked, suddenly blushing
Finally! Finally!
"Yes I...yes." Sherlock said, reaching to a high cabinet and stuffing a packet of biscuits into his pocket discreetly, putting the kettle on and wandering back over to the hall, leaning against the wall and looking to John.
"Sherlock, just stay with me okay,” says John, “Think about where we are. We need to stop this. Get out of here. Yeah? It's some fucked up shit of Moriarty's."
The detective’s eyes light up, and he stomps hard on the floor - then sees John look up on the screen.
John smiled and turned around, squashing his middle into Sherlock's and stretching up on tiptoe to kiss him properly because he couldn't resist the temptation any longer.
"What did you stuff this suit with? It feels...it feels very real," Sherlock said, voice going a bit husky as he stroke the suits velvet sides.
That didn't stop him from imagining Sherlock joining him however, eating until those stupidly tight shirts sprang off him and that lanky figure and skeletal face were plumped and rounded. Until he looked more like a blimp than a detective.
He passes out
“Yeah… yeah,” John gasped between pants. His hands moved down to undo Sherlock’s trousers, then he shoved his own aside impatiently. “Lube.” He grunted.
Greg cried out wildly as he came, fingers digging into the desk, into Sherlock's scalp, anything to keep himself standing as he shuddered.
"Is that...alright?" he added, brain desperately attempting to reboot.
"Oh God yeah," John lied. He chuckled. "I thought you were just going to hog it all, thanks."
"Er..." said Sherlock, attempting to conjure up a haughty air. "Maybe you should. Bed. You're drunk, John."
"Any cases on?" he asked conversationally.
He slides on down to his hips. Moriarty's right. Round, smooth... girly. And his butt is...well.
The glowing eyes stare at him passively, then look back to the screen.
He crossed to be closer to the man, setting his plate down, accepting another glass of wine as he shed his own mask. Features pale, a glass statue. Beautiful and delicate, but sharp.
John chuckled as Sherlock's fingers tickled him, squirming away slightly.
John's lips parted. He licked them and shifted slightly... Sherlock snoring there, a big round belly rising and falling, waking only to be fed more, lazily opening his mouth and gulping down whatever he was fed, belly spilling out, hands rubbing it sleepily.
Still, why the fuck was he getting hard?!
Desire Spirits were clever.
"Fuck!" the soldier shouts, furious with himself. That was a mistake. Several more sets of antenna rear up and scuttle towards him. John takes aim carefully and fires. He doesn't have many bullets to waste. He backs into the door, slamming his shoulder, damnit always the bad one, into it.
"Hard to miss," John chuckled, picking up the offered toast and eating it slowly, humming at the flavor, the melted butter and sugary jam. "It used to be the only way I could get you to eat something during long cases."
"They're... good," he noted.
"And you are mine*" Sherlock growled, roughly spinning John around, giving the man's massive arse a loud *SLAP*
The entire flat
"My brave soldier isn't frightened of a large free meal is he?" Sherlock rumbled.
"Thanks," said Deliah. She chewed her lip then ventured to ask, "So, are you waiting for someone?"
"We ate, and ate, and ate, furiously wanking to the thought of getting fatter, of...of each other getting fatter," Sherlock offered as his own story, squeezing whatever of John he could find.
"Still hungry?" he murmured. "I got you that ice cream you wanted."
The army doctor picks it up and stares at it in disbelief. More bullets. John quickly loads his gun and makes for the door, pushing it open. The corridor is dark, but smells dank rather than sweet. I stand for a moment, trying to let my eyes adjust.
"You are perfect."
Two, enormous spheres of creamy flesh, stretching the seat of the detective's sut pants to the limit. One reach further, and loud *RIP* joined the songs of the other officers, the pale, soft globes now on full display behind the detective as he reached on his hands and knees, fat gut brushing the floor, for more food
"It's not a problem," Sherlock said, much too quickly, imagined the man burping for him like the gorgeous little hog he-
Nearly every meal he ate lead to a quick trip to the loo for a wank, imagining how his belly would bulge out, round and fat, if he undid his underclothes.
“Jooooohn!” Sherlock wailed, rutting back into his captain in response. John rumbled appreciatively and stretched up to kiss and suck on Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock was running on autopilot, "Y-your belly is large by nine centimeters, Greg, but my arse is still...s-still considerably larger" He huffed, the mere statement of the sentence a physical activity
"I um, think I’ll have that kip now, enjoy the sweets," he breathed, swallowing and moving up the stairs, letting out a massive belch of his own as he reached the top.
!" Theres grunting, and a pop as something squeezes out of a chair, then a loud huffing sound, "
He smiled as Jim gorged himself.
"I was hoping so, I don't really see any of them having anywhere to spend the holiday, Mrs. Hudson
"Lead the way" the detective says, his confident Sherlock tone clearly a mask.
"Feeling good?" John asked, grinning.
"Yeah, well. You're you."
“Can’t-“
"Want another?" he offered, staring almost hungrily down at him.
“Good,” said Greg, pulling a doughnut seemingly out of nowhere and stuffing it roughly into Sherlock’s mouth. “You go and apologize then.”
It’s a lab, or at least it should be – it’s still much too playful in its atmosphere to be taken seriously. But that strangely growing, childish, part of Sherlock wants to laugh at the ridiculousness and honestly the sheer... fun of the room.
"You complete hog," John admonished, chuckling and leaning in to nip at Sherlock's jawline, pressing his chest further into Sherlock's hands with a soft huff.
His eyes widened as he took in the other man's jiggling white arse.
"O-okay, yeah, let's go. I'll cover us from behind. Stay close,” says the doctor.
John groans in agreement, gulping down more. More. More. And More.
"Rutherford isn't that odd of a name," said Sherlock haughtily. Though he had the impression that his ears were going pink. He cleared his throat and waited for the next subject to arrive. But John didn't take to any of them. He barely batted an eye when a blonde blue-eyed muscly young man sat next to him and started chatting him up. John was polite, but clearly not interested. That only doubled Sherlock's frustration. He wanted to kick something. Not redheads, not blondes, not dark hair, not tall, not short, not... Anything!
He spoke the Latin.
"Yeah, you’ve got me." The detective smiles, "Lead the way?"
"D-do you realize what you've done?! I-" Jim doubled over, then quickly snatched the doughnut, stuffing it into his mouth, "M-more! Now!" He yelled, then looked at Moran, eyes wide, "P-Please?"
the man," he tried to grumble, but he hummed and smiled around a mouthful of cookie.
He giggled as he looked into the bag, "Well, three more burgers plus fries might explain how my soldier turn into such a piggy," Sherlock teased, reaching his free hand down to jiggle John's gut, popping his thumb into the man's navel and exploring, greasy treat still hovering in front of those plump lips.
"Well, I love you, you prat," murmured John, chuckling and pressing in a bit closer to kiss softly in return, nipping at his lover's neck. "I thought it was high time we made things official. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Why shouldn't we be married?" He chuckled and slid his hands down a bit until they were circled around his love's waist. He had missed holding him like this.
Moriarty and Moran both throw their heads back and laugh, Moran's grip on John’s neck loosening for just long enough.
"How can we be out?! How can-"
“Yeah. Seems to be doing you some good,” John smiles, feeling brave enough to reach over and give that perfectly soft and proddable belly a poke. “Must be up three stone already.”
"Sherlock," John is quickly at the man’s side again, feeling for any permanent damage. "It's okay, I've got you. You did it."
“Politely and… and patiently. Try not to upset them further,” Sherlock answered, his voice small and soft as he looked at Greg with wide eyes. “I’m sorry. I wasn’t thinking-“
“After the accident, when I was all alone, I used- used to have this dream- you and I on a sailboat, somewhere far off, away from here. The
“What, really?” he sputtered, looking to Sherlock. “You sure you’re alright?”
“Revenge.” Sherlock shifted- his right leg had gone to sleep. “Moriarty’s specialty.”
you?” Donovan asked, crossing her arms, smug and defiant.
“I need you to know, John,” Sherlock whispered, “that the way I feel about you- and subsequently the way you make me feel about myself- is incomparable. I could search for a thousand years and never find its like.”
John stifled a sudden yawn. Now that the excitement had died down a little, his body was loudly reminding him that it was the middle of the night. His leg was sore, and he was tired.
This set off alarm bells, ringing deafening in Sherlock’s skull, resounding, clanging chaos.
“He knows that. Which is why your reputation won’t be enough for him. Eventually, he’s going to decide that he wants you dead, and no one’s going to be able to stop him.”
"Why would you want to eat if you weren't hungry?" John leaned one shoulder on the bricks while Sherlock stuck his key into the lock. He paused there for a second or two, obviously thinking of something. John would have killed to know what it was Sherlock was thinking. This was a common occurrence.
"Really?"
John looked once more at the garment bag and sighed. Then he took it up to his room. On his way up the stairs, he heard Sherlock's door slam open and then slam shut again.
Sherlock wanted to believe that this
John smiled and clicked off the lamp.

John had tried to bring it up, just the once (
"Just after three." Sherlock isn't looking at John anymore, John notes- there must be something quite interesting on the wall over John's shoulder, for all Sherlock's eyes seem to be boring a hole in it.
“You have no
There was a moment of tense silence, every muscle in the room pulled taut. An unblinking, unwavering glare passed between Sherlock and Mycroft the likes of which John had never seen. Sherlock looked as though he might take a swing at Mycroft at the slightest provocation, and John had realised there was a lot more at stake here than just death threats against an ambassador, though he had no idea what
He returned a few moments later with two garment bags slung over his shoulder and two shoeboxes held under his arm- he was followed closely by Mrs. Hudson, who kept trying to get a look at what he was carrying.
And then it dawned on him, a fresh horror.
“See, that one’s obvious too, if you think about it. Who would have the motivation and ability to meddle in Sherlock Holmes’s life to such an extent? Who would go to all this trouble? And old friend, perhaps? An enemy? A nemesis, maybe- you always did like that word.”
When he looked up, he was right.
“Christ, you’re gorgeous,” John continued, lifting Sherlock’s unoccupied hand, kissing each of his fingertips in turn. “Stunning, really. Not to mention amazing, and brilliant, and
John emerged from the bathroom with a damp flannel, still just as naked but significantly cleaner. Sherlock reached out for him, wordlessly, not even sure why he’d done it until John was back in his arms, wiping him clean. Of all the ways John had ever touched him, this was somehow the most intimate.
"Compliments of my brother," Sherlock said dryly; he draped one garment bag across the table next to John and placed a shoebox on top of it. He then disappeared to his bedroom without another word.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Moriarty doesn’t leave loose ends,” Sherlock repeated, swaying a little as he regained his footing, walking toward Victor. “So the question remains- why are you here?”
As the signs for King David’s became more frequent, Sherlock took a short jog west, followed by another north turn, until the streets became dirt, soaked into mud by recent rain. Past the last road sign, off the beaten trail, there was a service road. Where once it had been frequently used, it was now overgrown- certainly not passable by car.
sup hoes I'm back at it
“Your officers don’t know how to keep their mouths shut," Martin said, sat at the far end of the table, sipped what John had observed to be her fourth cup of coffee.
"Lube," John said quickly, between kisses. "
“For embarrassing you.”
alright, John?" Sherlock was asking, parroting John's earlier question whilst he poured them both a glass of wine. "You're being very quiet."
“However, that does leave the question,” continued Martin, “that if you didn’t help Victor Trevor escape, then who did?”
But that night in the kitchen at Baker Street, John’s blood on his hands- Sherlock wasn’t about to put John in harm’s way again.
“How very observant.” Mycroft smiled a patronizing smile, which John had long ago become convinced was the only kind of smile Mycroft had. “As it happens, I am here today because I once again require the services of my younger brother, intransigent as he may be.”
“What are you saying, Victor?”
“Well, Moriarty doesn’t leave loose ends, does he? If he’s done with you-” he gestured to Victor- “then it’s more likely you’d have turned up in a morgue somewhere, rather than this place. No offense.”
It was over before it began- he turned, but not soon enough- there was a cold, hard impact to the side of his face, and darkness swallowed him whole before he hit the ground.
“Fuck,” Sherlock replied succinctly. “I could, but then it would be over.”
Sherlock only blinked, tears welling up further.
“A little,” John admitted, catching his breath.
"Earth to Sherlock- come in, Sherlock."
“Do tell.”
if you're still reading this, thanks :)
John was already kneeling at Victor’s side, tearing his shirt open at the site of the wound, using the pieces of ruined fabric as a makeshift compress. Ever the army doctor, never pausing to help someone injured, even an enemy.
At this, Sherlock huffed. “I am not being
Sherlock glanced at John- John could see that he was about to lie.
John slipped out of Sherlock’s arms, snatching a pillow to prop up Sherlock’s hips. He slicked himself up, shivering at his own touch before lining himself up and slowly, carefully sliding his cock into Sherlock’s body, biting his lip until he tasted blood. Sherlock was gripping white-knuckled to the sheets, muttering curses and affirmations under his breath. It was taking John all of this concentration and will-power not to push forward, to just hold still and allow Sherlock time to adjust.
“Whatever gives you
"How does Hurst come into it?"
It was then that John appeared from the far end of the chapel, gun in hand. Sherlock, though he had gone to great pains not to involve John in any of this, was embarrassingly relieved to see him, the way he was always relieved to see John- in the early morning, snoring softly- late afternoon, in the quiet of the kitchen, poring over takeaway menus. Relief like the moments after a lost foot chase, huffing and puffing and laughing beneath the flicker of a streetlight.
“That still leaves quite a window of time,” Martin pointed out, “which is consistent with the timing of Trevor’s escape.”
“Only until eight,” Anderson qualified.
Sherlock has tears in his eyes when he kisses John this time. John brushes them away and kisses Sherlock back and keeps on kissing him, doesn't stop kissing him until the only word Sherlock remembers is John's name, until they're both coming apart all over again, clinging to each other without the slightest intention of ever letting go.
That was a bit of an exaggeration, to say the least. John had seen Sherlock prove murderous intent on multiple occasions.
As it turned out, the American Embassy was a deceptively large building.
Only, that would mean having uninterrupted time to do nothing but wonder what the rest of Sherlock's story entailed. John knew he already had a pretty good idea what had happened, unfortunately- but what he was really wondering was if the spell had been broken- if Sherlock was going to be willing to tell him the rest of it, or anything else for that matter.
Sherlock doesn't answer- John can hear him nodding, though, the rustle of his hair against the pillowcase, the only sound besides their breathing, deafening in the relative silence of the room.
“With all due respect, you don’t know him.” John looked to Lestrade, to Mycroft. “None of you do. Not really. It seems like I’m the only one who consistently gives him the benefit of the doubt. It’s no wonder he keep secrets, with how quick you all are to disbelieve him, to discredit him, to-”
Father was usually called “the professor’s soulmatch,” but his name was Siger. Sherlock always rather liked Father’s name. It looked so solid and spare, along Mummy’s third finger.
Harry was sitting unnaturally still, like she’d been slipped a paralytic in her clotted cream. Only her eyes moved—blinking, blinking—until she finally unstuck her jaw and scowled at John. “So what?”
“More committed than seducing her nurses and terrifying her therapists?”
“She removed it,” Mycroft said. His voice broke in a way that was, to Sherlock’s knowledge, unprecedented. “She burned her finger on the fireplace grate. Third-degree damage.”
“Eurus will find out, someday. About Hadiya.”
John closed the message before he typed something he’d regret.
If Mike was embarrassed, it only lasted a moment. Before John quite knew what was happening, he’d ordered a truly dreadful take-away coffee from the cart in the park and sat down next to Mike on a bench. The weather was bright and gray, in a way only Londoners ever experienced. He now knew that Mike Stamford had found his soulmatch (LOURDES, of all things) and was father to two round-faced, swotty children. He flipped through the photos on Mike’s phone and smiled fondly at all the appropriate moments. At least, he thought they were appropriate. Mike seemed satisfied with his participation, anyway.
. “Who was the first?”
Anthea sighed. “They fancy themselves in love, anyway. Eurus, of course, feels nothing in return. Doesn’t claim to, in fact. It’s the damndest thing.”
Sherlock nodded. It hurt rather badly somewhere deep inside his chest. Fear? No. He had, despite it all, outgrown his fear of Eurus. He was cautious of her. Wary. But this feeling couldn’t be fear, because Sherlock did not feel afraid. This was... something deeper. Something blue and cold, which made his eyes blink too much, on the verge of watering.
“Hardly,” Sherlock scoffed.
“If you need to break something, there are about a hundred bottles of your father’s crap beer in the cellar,” Clara remarked, filling a glass of water at the sink. She handed it to him, and John took a long swallow. It was strange, how very comfortable she seemed in his childhood home. How at ease.
She peeled away the flannel carefully, and Mummy and Father both leaned in. Sherlock closed his eyes. He waited. He waited. He opened his eyes again with a puzzled frown.
Mike grinned in a way which was a bit unsettling. “Old friend of mine,” Mike remarked, practically gleeful. “
—but the sort of sound that came from the bottom of one’s chest. Exhausted. Bleak. Painful.
His head was spinning, tilting to the left.
“Of course I’m not. Don’t be
“No,” Mycroft agreed flatly.
Harry’s curly blonde head appeared near the footboard. “I’ll go out your window,” she whispered.
All the cases of hate crimes against homosexual men which Harry references are real. Over the course of six months in 1989 and 1990, four gay men (Christopher Schliach, Henry Bright, William Dalziel, and Michael Boothe) were murdered in West London. These crimes remain unsolved, and led to mass public outcry. Colin Ireland killed five men - Peter Walker, Christopher Dunn, Perry Bradley III, Andrew Collier, and Emanuel Spiteri - and was convicted of their murders in December 1993. Several more high-profile cases followed, including the murder of Jody Debrowski, which was the first conviction for a hate crime motivated by homophobia in the UK (2006). These cases spurred a major investigation into police bias in 2007.

John read the letters aloud, pointing to each for Harry as he went:

Sherlock swerved away from the door. Oh. That
John had nine and a half years to Harry’s eight, and that made him just a bit wiser. Just enough to know what people meant when they said those sorts of things.
She took his arm with a squeeze. “Once more unto the breach?”
“Okay, then,” James replied. His mouth tucked up on one side in a small smirk.
“Tell evac I’m going to need a transfusion. Evans is AB negative. Have it ready when we arrive.”
“I know. It was... I had some things to wrap up before...”
“Fuck,” John choked out. “Oh, the way you
“Then who said anything about flatmates?”
“I know you’re an Army doctor and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you, but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him, possibly because he’s an alcoholic. More likely because he recently walked out on his soulmatch. And I know that your therapist thinks your limp’s psychosomatic. Quite correctly, I’m afraid.”
“Of course, Johnny,” the elderly woman nodded with watery eyes. “Goodness, you’ve grown into a right hero, haven’t you? So handsome! Just like your father.”
“Will yours?” John shot back, and then winced. “Sorry. Shit.”
and clicked his tongue.
. Mycroft, Anthea, and Sherlock were all too full of it. There was no room for their usual sniping and feigned detachment. “What do you need from me?” Sherlock murmured.
, however, are not.” Anthea stood, resting her hand briefly on Mycroft’s shoulder. He didn’t acknowledge the action, and she didn’t seem to expect it. She left the dining room without a word. Once she’d gone, Mycroft unclenched his jaw and went on. “Eurus believes you to be her adversary. As much as I am. I, however, am boring. I visit. I give her the opportunity to...
—but John figured that was the hemorrhagic shock. His brain shutting down as the oxygen ran out along with the blood. How long had he been lying here? It felt like ages.
. As he arched his back and keened, John’s mind went strangely, sinfully blank. It didn’t feel like going to Hell. He didn’t feel anything but pleasure.
“At least?”
John shot Harry an unimpressed look, but didn’t turn the station. They sat together, on the edge of a real fight, long enough for John’s anger to fade. For her part, Harry’s anger never really went away.
“My decision on this matter is final,” Mycroft announced, in something more like his usual tone. “Your guilt serves no function.”
“Just so.” His older brother lofted a brow. “Let me be...

to John, to make John talk to him. Not for any purpose, really, but because talking to John was pleasant. Sherlock felt awkward, rather nervous, but even that unusual sensation couldn’t dull the high. He stiffened his spine as he deliberately ignored the shorter man.
“Do you think Eurus knew for certain?” Sherlock wondered. “Did Hadiya reveal her soulname, in private?”
“Eurus is anything but impotent,” Mycroft replied with infuriating calm. “She has driven off so many doctors that the psychiatric staff is no longer willing, nor able, to treat her. Some she merely frightened. More recently, she’s taken to convincing them to love her.”
“Or dating every Helen he can find, hoping it’s me.” There was laughter in her tone.
Sherlock sat a long time on his bed, feeding his snarling brain. His stomach grumbled, too, but much more quietly. He ignored it. Supper was nearly over, and Sherlock had missed the deadline to deliver his chemistry lab to Ulysses for copying. Even if he went now, he'd get a
As the door swung shut behind him, he heard Mike’s smug voice ring out:
“You’ve got a boy’s name?”
anything. And he’s an idiot.”
“It’s not a party, Mum. It’s a funeral.” John gripped her hand, pressing two fingers against her wrist. Her pulse was quick but steady. “He’d understand.”
“Incest, love,” Harry shot back, fluttering invisible lashes.
John shook his head again. “No. He’s been out for weeks, apparently.”
“James?”
There was a hard, bright edge to Victor’s teasing smile. Sherlock shrugged. “Perhaps.”
“I hate this.” Sherlock ripped at his curls with his free hand. “I hate not knowing.”
“And you
“Shall we get you a plaster for your hand, darling?” Mummy let Father go and began to dig through the drawers next to the sink. She wasn’t looking at Sherlock anymore.
His younger sister eyed him wearily. “Three weeks ago.”
“That’s one way to put it,” Clara deadpanned.
“Yeah, well,” John finally responded. “I don’t think I’ll ever have £40,000 to blow on that sort of thing. He’ll just have to muddle through, like everyone else.”
And he was gone. Victor was gone. Sherlock was alone.
“That’s not true,” John argued. And it wasn’t. John didn’t know many men who had sex lives like his own. “Sure, he might not be a virgin. But he might be waiting, all the same.”
“No.” Sherlock turned away, which slammed the door on that discussion. (
“What’s a bloke like that doing around here?” Sally wanted to know.
“Nothing happens that you don’t want,” James soothed, leaning closer. John closed his eyes and his nostrils flared. “Do you, John? Want?”
Mycroft’s face smiled, but it was a lie. “Our lives are not without risk.”
“John?” The words came with a soft
“It won’t,” Ulysses snarled. “But I might.” He loomed over Sherlock’s slight frame like a human tidal wave. Sherlock forced himself not to react. “Give me the work, Freak, or I’ll make things very painful for you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I assume I’m not offered the same courtesy.”
“He’s daft, but he’s good to them all,” Harry murmured.
“Victor was never my
John’s bark of laughter surprised them both. He wiped his face again and set the empty glass in the sink. He offered Clara his elbow.
“That name on your finger says otherwise, boyo.”
“No?” Sherlock repeated in shock. He looked down at Lestrade’s hand. VICTORIA.
“A castle!”
John looked up from his feet to take in the scene. The cream pot was smashed against the far wall, little blue and white shards dripping across the lino. Mum was hunched a bit over the sink, rinsing a sponge, and she didn’t look up. Something on the stove smelled a bit burnt. Her hair was mussed, her apron twisted too far to the right. Da lounged in his usual chair at the table, sipping and sneering. John nodded, once, and took off for the door. Before he reached it though, there was another sharp
Basic training was designed to cull the herd, and John had privately expected to end up on the chopping block. He’d played rugby in school, so John was tough enough and pretty quick. Resourceful. Decisive. A man’s man, though his father never acknowledged it. The army, though... it wasn’t a secondary school. War wasn’t a game. John wondered if the higher-ups would see some inborn
“Oh, yes. Mostly with women, though.”
. Stop, come here. I want to come with you
for the impertinence of showing up late. Best to let Ulysses go without. Pain now or pain later—it was all the same to Sherlock.
,” Victor murmured, with his voice pitched low. “So few people are, you know.” Then Victor released the door, backing away with his hands back in his pockets. “I’ll look forward to tonight. I think you will, too.”
. “I know, Cap, Jesus, I know. Watson! Don’t you pass out on me!”
Sherlock wasn’t sure what to say. He’d managed to eat half of the bacon sandwich while Lestrade distracted him, but now his stomach was uncomfortably queasy. Sherlock really hadn’t deduced this. Lestrade was a liar, and Sherlock
That being said, John Watson spent his formative adult years in the UK military, overseas in countries were homosexuality is a serious crime. He also would have been exposed to "bacha bāzī" culture in Afghanistan, as many soldiers still are; I won't go into that here or in this story, but you can look it up if you really want to ruin your day. Not to mention the rampant sexual violence within the armed forces, which happens to both men and women. I have a friend who was very open-minded in high school, and came back from his first tour thoroughly homophobic after exposure to this stuff. Homosexuality and sexual violence are not connected, but men who want to hurt or dominate other men do use sex acts to do it. War zones are prime breeding ground for this behavior. Let's cut John "Not Gay" Watson a little slack, eh?
“We aren’t soulmates, Sherlock. Your soulname is... well, it’s
about his own desires. He wanted to learn. Anything, everything, as fast as he could. He fed his ravenous intellect like a zookeeper, struggling to keep the loudest and strongest thought, in that moment, from consuming its own kin. Trying to keep it contained, and entertained, and marginally less destructive than it might be otherwise. It was exhausting. Mummy and Father, with their orderly, well-disciplined minds, were no help whatsoever.
He stretched out across his small, neat bed and closed both eyes. Jesus fucking Christ, he hated this. All of it. He hated soulnames and soulmates and the fairy stories of romance that kept everyone swooning over such a ridiculous lie. His own soulname—SHERLOCK—glared back at him, as if in reproach, and he buried his left hand behind his head, underneath his pillow.
“Don’t cover up on my account,” James murmured. His voice was low, and a bit smoky, and John thought, the first time he heard it, that James ought to be on the evening news.
“Bad luck, mate,” Lestrade winced. “Me and the missus didn’t meet until I was in my thirties, though. Could still happen for you.”
“Ha. Too right. I’ve already got my supply chain well in hand here, though. Long distance is a bitch, but we’ve made it work.”
“Eurus is some sort of—of mastermind, in this analogy? Some great institutionalized Machiavelli?”
He grinned, in spite of himself, and pulled the door open. “Never.”

“Gina’s mum says that sometimes a soulmate isn’t like a boyfriend or girlfriend. You don’t got to live with him or anything.”
Clara leaned in, frowning. “Well, then, he’s an idiot.”
“Done for the day?” Victor ventured. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Not yet. Mum hasn’t told him. She said, maybe we could hide it for a while.”
“Glad my shoes don’t scream ‘eating for two,’” Anthea remarked dryly. “And no, Mummy, I’m so sorry. But we aren’t expecting.”
“Harry, I am
The UK government support benefits for people who were too ill to work were called "Invalidity Benefits" from 1971 to 1995. In 1995, they renamed these "Incapacity Benefits," and in 2008 this became the "Employment and Support Allowance" (ESA).
“Men. I have sex with men. I would never with another woman.”
“Expensive as shit, though, isn’t it? Even for you, on a surgeon’s salary someday. You’d think those rich wankers didn’t want to be found.”
“So... why did Margot go to Durham? Why didn’t you go with her?”
“Your mum needs another pint of cream,” Da said, in a slurred command.
Sherlock nodded, pulling a miserable face. He’d stopped crying, but the mirror over the sink reflected his red eyes and damp nose.
—there wasn’t any other word for it.
“What do you want?”
, he thought, so he repeated it aloud: “
Sherlock’s fingers twitched against his thighs. Mycroft’s eyes narrowed.
“No.”
At 12 years old, he advanced through to the Upper School. His piercing words weren’t much use against boys four years his senior. Sherlock couldn’t keep his mouth shut (truly

now.” It wasn’t true, but Molly still hadn’t given up on her relentless, pointless infatuation. He couldn’t abide her inept flirting in front of John.
“I don’t expect I’ll ever find out,” John confessed, quietly, and then swigged his water. “Posh bloody name. Not so many of those in the Middle East.”
There was a long, loaded pause. “I’m sorry, what?”
John glanced down and then back into Mike’s cheerful face. “I got shot.”
The younger man’s eyes were tight and achy, but Sherlock never let himself cry. It was the one thing Victor loved most about him. Sherlock Holmes was unbreakable.
There was an awkward pause, and John cleared his throat. “Does she like it?” he asked, and then flushed when Helen laughed loudly. “The

James nodded. “He’ll go home to his soulmatch. That’s what matters.”

Sherlock’s door opened, and he deliberately stood in the open frame to prevent Victor from stepping inside. “Is that what gets you off? Scowling?”
Sherlock huffed. “Fine.”
Sherlock was nine and three-quarters when his soulname came in.
Mummy’s given name was Merritt, but she preferred to use her middle name: Lydia. Lydia was the name on Father’s finger, much to Grandmere’s consternation. “Such
It was like a blow to the gut, even after all these years. Those words, in this house. John’s Da, red-faced and bleary-eyed, holding the bottle to Mum’s lips while she frowned, tried to pull away.

I did my best with the British military lingo and the medical particulars. I am neither a soldier nor a doctor. I welcome corrections in my inbox!
“You were working,” Clara said, eyes still on Harry. “Overseas.”
“Can’t afford London on an army pension.”
Sebastian’s blue eyes widened and his jaw stiffened. “Of course I do! What kind of question is that?”
Sherlock pressed his lips together, hard, and watched the water run clear and cold along the back of his hand. “Go. No! Look. Tell me what it says.”
If a person could be made for something, then John Watson was made for combat. Maybe it was his father’s blood rising up in him, or his own rough upbringing, or maybe just the strange chemistry of blood-bone-bile that settled his gut and steadied his hands. He could set a bone while machine guns blared in the background. He could stitch up a wound while bombs whistled overhead. And John could shoot a gun like he was born with it in his hand.
. Right. That’s where people who acted on their same-sex soulnames ended up. Right alongside the murderers and heretics and prostitutes.
But John’s reputation preceded him, and his soulname did, too.
? Really.”
“The probability of an unmatched soulname is—”
The wealthy put quite a bit of stock into the soulname mythology. They named their children strange, unique sorts of names, in hopes of narrowing the field when it came time to search out their partners. Names like “Sherlock” were passed down through generations, usually only once the previous owner had passed on, and an international registry existed for looking up potential matches. It was expensive—the registry—so names like “John” would never be on it. He wondered if his soulmate looked anyway.
you’ve made.”
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock breathed. “I’m fine. I’ll be fine.”
“What?”
Sherlock closed his eyes. He would not cry. “When are you coming home?”
John tilted his head. There was a manic glint in Mike’s eye that tugged on John’s memory. Nights spent in the dormitory basement, smoking weed and planning pranks Mike was all too eager to carry out. The child-size mannequin dressed as Napoleon, relocated every few days to stay ahead of campus police. The bubble solution poured into the fountain on the green. The toilet paper rolling down from the roof.
“Yeah...” Victor thought aloud. “Yeah, you’re right. Very good, boy.”
“Well, where is it?”
Da watched their interaction with those dangerous eyes. John swallowed. “Sure you don’t want help? I can peel potatoes.”

A spark flared in John’s eyes—a challenge. “We don’t know a thing about each other. I don’t know where we’re meeting. I don’t even know your
“What?” Sherlock bit out. “What don’t I know?”
“Why should she need to?” Anthea wanted to know. “Mycroft rarely carries out his own directives. The elephantine matriarch need not scavenge her own food or fend off her own attackers.” Sherlock reflected, not for the first time, on how perfect his brother’s soulmatch was for Mycroft. Annoyingly repetitive thought, and not a

“Goodbye, Mycroft.”
The phone on the desk rang almost as soon as he shut the door.

who knew what it felt like to want another man, and to wear the proof of that want on his own skin.
Sebastian’s expression was horribly patronizing. “Margot’s my true soulmatch. No question. The sex with Margot is... magnificent. Unparalleled. Once you’ve been with your soulmate, watched them when they—” Sebastian shook his head, flushed. “You can’t go back. Why would you fuck someone else, when your soulmate is
The worst of it was that Da was right. People cheated on their soulmatches—of course they did—and there were those who’d do any manner of illicit thing to a bloke for the right price. John was in fifth form; he knew all about that now. It wasn’t what John
“Yes yes
“I already am,” John chuckled, but she silenced him with a hard, biting kiss.
. No amount of retroactive atonement would be enough to balance the books.
John had heard somewhere that police officers, whilst in training, had to let someone use a taser on them. It was important for officers to know what it felt like before they tried it out on anybody else. That made sense, in a perverse way. Would dying—or, he supposed,
Sherlock couldn’t answer without screaming, so he didn’t bother to try. Mycroft sighed.

She smirked, sitting up. “I know.”
There was a meeting with Ella this morning. A

This feeling, though... this wasn’t what John expected.

“Five years, Victor. You can’t—I can’t—”
“Why doesn’t he just sell Avon and have done with it?” John asked.
. It was beyond sick. It was...
“Donovan!” Lestrade warned. Sally flushed. So much for decorum.
John curled his small fist, turning his hand palm-up in Gran’s loose grasp.
Sherlock’s small room in Saunderites House was his home for the better part of four years. He’d spent the first two as a woefully under-aged Lower School menace. Starting his fourth form at age 10 may have made sense academically, but it turned Sherlock into a complete pariah. He reacted like a cornered alley cat—lashing out with sharp rhetorical claws, ready to rip and tear and maul. His deductions hadn’t made him many friends among his much-older classmates. The professors weren’t terribly fond of Sherlock, either, come to that.
He could recall James perfectly, if he tried, but he found he didn’t really want to. Coping mechanism? Who the Hell knew? James was breaking in new recruits, reluctantly but no doubt efficiently, while John’s longest running relationship dissolved into something as distant and meaningless as everything else right now. Ran out of him like blood and piss, into the burning sand. Not that you could properly call what James gave him a ‘relationship.’
“Empress Wu Zetian, I should think,” Anthea replied sardonically. “
He’d bought Harry a beer that night, to take the edge off. So she could finally sleep.
“Does Da know?”
“Good. Don’t call me again at this number. I’ll let you know when we’re on our way to the airport. And Sherlock?”
The quiet was far less comfortable now, with the weight of Sally’s words between them. Sherlock was glad he wore his leather gloves, because Lestrade side-eyed his left hand with more-than-casual interest.
Harry arrived on a rush of Autumn wind and animated cursing. “John! You fucking bastard, I know for a
, you useless—” Sherlock stopped himself when Lestrade grunted at him. (
“Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for, and here he is...” He shouldn’t look at John. At JOHN. Not now, anyway, and possibly not ever. “Just back from lunch, with an old friend, clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan.” (
Sherlock stiffened. “I am not psychotic.”
“I agree. The psychiatrists, however, are less convinced.”
“I don’t hire prostitutes,” Sherlock replied coolly. “Too many variables.”
The Detective Inspector sniffed once, hard, and glanced down at Sherlock’s sandwich. “You finish that,” he commanded. “Your brother’s a nasty piece of work when he’s worried about you.”
“Sherlock,” Lestrade sighed, looking inexplicably fond. “She fancies you. It’s obvious, even to a moron like me.”
“She needs a break,” John said.
“It wasn’t working for me.”
It hit Sherlock, rather suddenly. Years of his elder brother’s rules and restrictions, chafing him raw. The drugs busts. The spying. His cool aloofness with Anthea. Their stoic devotion, and their public restraint. The unclimbable monolith of Mycroft’s expectations, and the phone which was always answered no matter how often Sherlock backslid.
. If Mycroft was a chess player, Sherlock was more interested in sleight-of-hand. “Dangerous intellects.” That’s what the headmaster said.
John sniffed a few times. “You don’t smell of it.”
. There are clinics who’d agree to work with us now.” She sighed, twisting a long piece of hair through her fingers. Clara was younger than John, but seemed so much wiser. More self-assured. “We both work so much. Such long hours. We’re independent people, Harry and I, with plenty of our own issues to sort through. I’m not sure we’ll ever want to bring a child into our mess.”
“I’m fine,” John wheezed.
“Jack!” Mum scolded. “She’s a nice girl. You bite your tongue.”
“If you tell Mummy, I will set fire to the Diogenes Club.”
Still smiling, Mike gestured toward his own waistline. “Yeah, I know. I got fat!”
Sherlock Holmes did not cry.
John glanced down at his leg. His mouth grew tight.
“What then?”
He was also strangely likable. He was charming. It really was all just a bit strange.
“Of course not. My marks are good. I’ve got recommendations. I can cover the fees myself.”
“How do you know?”
“You’ve argued
James was right behind John when he turned around. His face was inscrutable, but his eyes were restless—running across John’s cheeks and down his chest, from shoulder to shoulder and back up to his face. John could practically
The crowd around Mum was thinning, and John probably needed to step in and give her break for a while. Play the dutiful son. God knew Harry wasn’t going to bother. He caught his sister’s eye and bobbed his head toward the waiting mourners.
“Teaching now. Bright young things, like we used to be.” Mike shook his head. “God, I hate them.” John laughed, and it didn’t feel forced. “What about you? Just staying in town until you get yourself sorted?”
“Sherlock.” Mycroft’s tone was distinctly disappointed.
LOL? You're 36, Harry. Thirty-six years old.
John frowned. “No. I don’t fancy men.”
“Don’t you?” Mycroft said. Sherlock gritted his teeth. “Sherlock—”
“She finds me attractive,” Sherlock conceded, with a genuine sneer. “However, she’s a marginally intelligent woman. Surely she realizes what an abominable life partner I’d be sure to make.”
, yes...”
suffix. He pulled his cane over and stood with a long sigh, closing his laptop.
“Has she... experimented, then? Your friend?”
“Anthea and I will be there for Leavers’ Day. She’s looking forward to it. Do make an effort with your hair.”
“Yeah. I do.”
At seven-thirty exactly, Sherlock stepped out on to the front steps of the residence hall. Victor was waiting, hands still in his pockets. The shorter man had changed clothes: cotton-and-silk shirt, pale denim trousers, darker denim jacket with sueded leather at the shoulders. Purple-striped Adidas high-tops, the white leather kept glaringly bright. He looked... Well. Sherlock pressed his lips together tightly to keep his observations to himself.
“All right, Bumble,” Father nodded, taking Mummy’s hand. “Let’s go down to the sitting room. I’ll ask Miss Anna to brew up a pot of tea. I imagine we’ve woken her by now, all this racket.”
“Yes, I—” God, it was mortifying. “I need to come home.”
“Sorry,” the smiling man sighed, a bit put-upon. “It’s in my coat.”
Sherlock knew that tone of disapproval. Intimately. Even across nearly 2000 miles, Sherlock flinched in response.
“Then there’s only one way left to save you, if you won’t save yourself.” Victor reached back into the waistband of his jeans, and yes,
"You don't have to tell me if you don't want to."
Minutes, but what could have been hours later, Sherlock was sprawled on the bed, stripped to the waist, having lost his shoes and not being sure when or how he had done so. All that mattered now was that John was there, kneeling over him, working his hand between their bodies to pop the button on Sherlock’s trousers while he bit a bruise into the hollow space above Sherlock’s collarbone. Sherlock hissed and moaned in encouragement, pouting a little when John pulled away to look down at him.
“Enough of that now,” he says firmly, even if his pupils are dark  as black holes and there’s a carnal growl in his tone. “Piggies must eat. Finish the cake. The both of you.”
"Oh, hang on, we should leave the cookies out for Father Christmas," said John, hauling himself up with the help of the table and his lover. He managed not to groan too badly as his stomach sagged down. At least Sherlock was drunk.
A pentagram, but an unusual sort of kind. One meant to not only summon but contain, especially when summoning a spirit of desire.
Sherlocks mouth fell open as the perfect being before him got...well even more perfect.
Those are not the kind eyes of his John.
The table recedes slowly into the floor. Sherlock groans again.
Sherlock tears off a piece of the fluffy pink bed and stuffs it into his mouth, where it melts almost instantly into pure sugar.
John pressed himself against Sherlock with a low groan, fondling the man's arse possessively and kissing at his soft chest.
Today, Sherlock would bring up... whatever had happened. The detective marched into the kitchen.
"You like that, do you?" he teased, drawing his hand back again to slap Sherlock's doughy arse once again. The sound was incredible, the sight even more so as the fat shifted and jiggled.
"Sherlock! Away from the handle!" John bellows, not even sure the detective can hear him. He takes aim and shoots the candy knob and bolt which shatter. A set of razor sharp pincers suddenly find their mark in John’s wounded shoulder. He cries out as it bites the scar tissue, nibbling quickly through the shirt. The ex army doctor then snarls and bashes into the door again, squashing the bug in the process.
"Here," John murmurs, moving his hands carefully down to the man’s gut. It's hard to believe it belongs to Sherlock Holmes. The matchstick man in a suit he follows around London from day to day.  He tries to soothe the detective, pressing warm calloused palms at hard spots. He knows Sherlock can burp, they can at least get the extra gas out, try to relieve the pressure. John reaches down to undo Sherlock’s belt and trousers as well, then goes back to rubbing. The doctor needs Sherlock mobile. They need to keep moving.
The detective had grown even fatter since that fateful night, finding his capacity through the roof after downing a mountain of toast, ice cream, and pizza, wishing he could rub his soldier’s belly like that again, eyes trailing the man's form as he left, looking even more muscled than before, so tightly packed into his jumper.
The whip was found with Archie's fingerprints, and the elf dominatrix that runs the chamber insisted Archie was a violent dom. A man of intense submission would never use a whip...would he?" Sherlock asked, swallowing hard as he leaned over to the Food O Matic, typing without being free from John's lardy prison. An entire pizza popped out, covered with sausage, onion, and ham. Next to it was a seafood bounty, clams and mussels. Fried calamari and lobster. All dripping with butter and fat.
"Boys! Deliv'ry for you downstairs!" It was Mrs. Hudson, calling up to them from the landing.
John didn't get up right away the next morning, allowing himself a bit of a lie-in on his day off. It didn't turn out to be that relaxing, though, as far as lie-ins went. As soon as John opened his eyes, or maybe even before that, he was trying to solve the puzzle of Sherlock's deep hatred for the man whose life Mycroft had charged them both with saving.
to save the life of a man such as Hurst. The only intent I
“Both of you, shut up!” Sherlock snapped. He closed his eyes, pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to think between the dull beats of the pounding in his head.
This was how they found themselves walking back to Baker Street, cheeks touched pink by the wine and the cool evening air in equal measure, neither of them drunk so much as generally buzzed by the good company they'd found themselves in.
“All that means is that you don’t know anymore than I do.” He stepped back, nearly stumbled, when Victor reached for him again. John was close behind him. He couldn’t focus, couldn’t untangle his stream of consciousness with the white noise of pain threatening to drown it all out.
Sherlock had left quickly after that, knowing that whatever John said next would surely have been altogether unbearable. He hadn't been quick enough, though, and John had been alerted to his presence. He'd foolishly hoped that John would come running after him, to stop him, but John hadn't, cementing in Sherlock's mind just how attached he had become, as opposed to how attached John was not.
want to talk about it, then of course I'll listen. Of
, John thought, pulling back, only to thrust forward again, beginning a slow and shallow rhythm.
"You should know by now, John, that I only take the time and effort to make friends with people I consider to be truly remarkable."
Also, lots of exposition.
me to ask?"
Both Sherlock and Mycroft rolled their eyes in tandem- the effect was frightening. Martin just looked confused. Sherlock, for all his bravado, looked nervous now, exposed.
"But why?" Sherlock asks. "I've been running scenarios in my mind, trying to understand how and when it could have happened, and I-" he frowns. "There are variables missing. I clearly don't have enough data."
Sherlock took a deep breath and looked away from John for a moment, pulling at the sleeves of his dressing gown and biting the inside of his cheek, both things he did when he felt the need to occupy his hands or his mouth and there was no violin or cigarette nearby.
“Of course, the press will find out,” Martin continued. “And since it’s an open investigation, I won’t be able to give them much context. I can only imagine the sort of speculation that will ensue. Enough to ruin a good doctor’s reputation, I would imagine.”
) and decided that John looked even better now, not different but more familiar, more beautiful now that Sherlock knew the history behind the lines on John's face, the depth behind the blue of John's eyes, and the kindness of the heart John really had.
what you’re talking about.” The words came out like a hiss, ground to dust between Sherlock’s teeth. “How could you possibly have any idea at all?”
Sherlock laughed softly and put his head on John’s shoulder. “And they say
of boring," John pointed out. "The murder bit, I mean. A bit ambitious, isn't it? Trying to kill someone with dozens of witnesses present?"
John scoffed fondly and rolled his eyes, leaning away. Sherlock wanted to pull him back in by the front of his jumper.
He hadn't been here since the burial, a humid, orange day in the high heat of August, a day that was nothing like this one. It hadn't occurred to him that he should ever visit- Victor wasn't really here, anyway.
As soon as Sherlock came, John came too, shouting what must have been Sherlock’s name, though he could have sworn he lost all sentience. His vision whited out as he felt the wet warmth of Sherlock’s come splattering over his stomach and chest, his own orgasm filling Sherlock to the brim. For just a moment, it was impossible to know where the boundaries were between them, if those boundaries existed at all. The air disappeared from around them, their hearts skipped the same beat.
“So, what now then?” John looked around at the faces of all those gathered, and none of them seemed to have an answer.
with such venom that John nearly laughed.
“I could eat,” Sherlock answered almost immediately, right as John was mid-sip.
“Shit.”
“Our intelligence is limited. We have no way of knowing what sort of person the assassin will be, whether they will be posing as a staff member or a diplomat or even a civilian guest. We only know there will be an attempt on someone’s life.”
“You know, the thing about Moriarty is that he always gets what he wants.” He began to pace, slowly, back and forth across the base of the altar. “He’s never been denied, not once, not by anyone. Anyone but you.”
“Although,” Sherlock continued, “it’s perfectly natural that you would be, given how many denials you’ve made over the years.”
"Sorry. Yeah, I'm fine, I was just lost in thought." Thoughts that suddenly paled in comparison to how good the food tasted. John hadn't realised just how hungry he was. He chewed slowly and hoped to God that Sherlock wouldn't pry further than that. When it seemed that Sherlock might, John quickly changed the subject.
It was quarter of three when John and Sherlock were awakened by the knocking and shouting. John was awake in a second, leaping off the bed and going immediately for his gun. Sherlock lurched upward, nearly falling to the floor, far less coordinated.
Lestrade burst into the flat, waving his gun, fumbling around in the dark for the light switch.
Of course, none of that was comparable to this moment, this reality- that John loved him, that John wanted him, that John
Sherlock didn't confirm or deny what John had supposed.
"It concerns her Majesty's interests, and therefore it concerns my brother. He practically runs the Foreign Office, after all. Singlehandedly, at times." Sherlock took a sip of his wine, fingers so tight on the stem of the glass that John thought it might break. "And Hurst is a political ally who Mycroft does not wish to lose."
“Of course not, John.” Sherlock got to his feet, brushing himself off, steadied only by John’s hand on his arm. “Unlike some, my first instinct upon catastrophe is not to fake my death.”
something, that this touch wasn't without pretense, that John had some other motivation for it- but Sherlock was a scientist in all things, and so he could not allow himself to give into this bias, not even for a second. Simply
Sherlock nodded. "My only friend, in fact."
oops there's still a little more plot
There was a familiar desire rising up in Sherlock’s chest, one that he no longer attempted to suppress. He gave himself over completely, clawing at John’s shoulders, ridding him of his jacket, shrugging out of his own coat. It was no easy feat, what with John’s hands on his hips, pinning him to the wall while he kissed Sherlock senseless.
“Keep going,” Sherlock said. “I’m not going to break.”
John really wished he’d shot Victor Trevor when he’d had the chance.
“I’ll let you get some rest.” Lestrade smiled again, and then he was gone.

"I knew that
was the gun Sherlock had suspected was hidden somewhere. John instinctively raised his weapon as well, and then it was the kitchen at Baker street all over again, only this time Victor was pointing his gun at Sherlock.
, Sherlock wanted to ask.
“There was that old dinghy we found buried in the boat house- we fixed it up so we could row down the lake, remember?”
Victor spread his arms, stepping back until Sherlock could once again see the whites of his eyes. “Ask away.”
Twice, John has been woken by explosions. Small ones, too be sure, experiments gone wrong that set off the fire alarm and had John all but tripping down the stairs and into the kitchen to ensure that Sherlock hadn't seriously injured himself (or the flat) this time. On one of these two such occasions, he simply took one look at Sherlock, turned around, and laughed himself all the way back upstairs into bed, falling back to sleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow. Sherlock's eyebrow had only taken a week to grow back, and John had never been more endeared to Sherlock than when he'd noticed Sherlock pouting at his own appearance in the mirror every time he thought John wasn't looking.
"He talked me into it," Sherlock stated simply.
himself?) say the words.
“The bullet must have punctured his heart,” John surmised as Sherlock knelt down at Victor’s opposite side, feeling even dizzier than before. “There’s too much blood for it to be anything else. He’s not- I don’t think he’s going to make it.”
John shakes his head. His drowsiness is quickly wearing off, but he’s still none the wiser about where he is. John looks around, confused. There's a bundle, a dark bundle laying there.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and opened his mouth to continue speaking, “Honestly, I’m just being kind! Susana clearly never really cared for her any-urp!”
The scene was set.
"Good. I'm the same way. Do make yourself comfortable. It's boiling in here. You must feel molten."
"I-I should!" Sherlock said, a bit too loud, "I might grab a biscuit before I do, celebrate making a bit of headway in the case, I'll grab you one?" he said, wandering to the kitchen, pouring two cups of tea and snagging a few biscuits.
"N-nothing," Sherlock spluttered, swallowing as his mouth watered inexplicably. He felt he should avert his eyes, but couldn't bring himself to.
Then they should probably get to bed with Sherlock being in the state he was, John thought warmly. He gave the detective a quick side-armed hug and then waddled his way to the fireplace to set the cookies down.
"Your mum's a good cook," John murmured, smiling as he allowed himself to look over Sherlock again, "Don't think I've ever seen you eat like that before."
are the case! They were left at 221b for me and I...I’ve no idea what they mean!" The detective said, groaning and sitting down
At the end of the corridor rests another skeleton. "Human, female, 25 years of age" Sherlock says with a hiccup, "I...believe we've found 'Cindy.' " he finishes coldly, before his lip quivers a little, and he murmurs in a much smaller voice, "She just wanted to be their friend...she didn’t know." Sherlock sniffles, but  John’s hand squeezes the detective’s hand and he’s  back to himself.
Well Sherlock was a grown man now, and suddenly Mycroft and his former bodyguard were more round and spry and ageless than ever. So he'd snuck into a party he shouldn't be at, filling his own soft, spoiled little stomach with appetizers, his black suit straining around his growing, greedy tummy, bubble butt filling out his trousers to the point of screaming.
“Manners, Dr. Watson,” he chides lightly, “Hasn’t my brother taught you it’s rude to stare so?”
"Hurp-yes it is, love," John said, grinning and pulling Sherlock in to kiss him. Christ... he didn't know if he could move...
Sherlock kisses him, and lets him go, wandering over to pull on his trousers and shirt again. John watches him through a daze, not entirely trusting himself to let go of the wall just yet.
Sherlock lit the candles.
“You’ll apologize to Molly tomorrow morning. In person,” John growled, crowding into Sherlock’s space, his other hand squeezing at Sherlock’s thigh.
Sherlock only chuckles and proffers the butty again, his gaze level, compelling.
"Er, just in time, I wanted to try this pfeffernus recipe, want to taste one while they're hot?" asked John innocently. Not that they really needed more cookies. He muffled a burp and tried to suck in his stomach further, but it was far too full to compress very much.
John stretched and got up lazily, watching Sherlock's arse as the man walked away. He shook his head when he caught himself and went to change.
"What!? No! No!" Sherlock desperately tipped the box over, running his fingers over the crumbs that feel out and sucking them desperately
As John rubs he can almost feel the pressure go down, belly softening, and starting to ripple lightly under his hands. Sherlock is relieved when it seems to be helping. It doesn't seem to be going away though. The detective swallows in shock as his own hands sink into soft fat. Oh God...
In my mind, the Yoga intructer was Lena, from the fan fic Classic The great sex olympics of Baker street by XistentialAngst. In another time line John probably got lucky and got another go with her.
“Hi Sally. John just got kidnapped,” Molly explained without preamble. “He was thrown in a van and I am currently following him in a cab. What should I do?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Molly paled visibly and stared at him. She opened her mouth, but John put his fingers on her lips. He typed, ‘Molly, please. Whatever you know, I need you to tell me. I had snipers following Mrs. Hudson and me. We think Sherlock is still alive. Please, help me out here.’
Sherlock inspected the view out of the office windows. After some minutes he decided on one and opened it. He pushed a sturdy desk toward the window and helped John to mount the rifle.
Hours later, 3 o'clock on Saturday morning, Greg had a working theory and loads of leads.
A tall man stepped in, phone in hand. “Yes, understood. I will get to it immediately.” He sounded eager. He shed his black leather jacket and threw it on the kitchen counter.
John smiled. “Of course. I had no intention of sleeping alone tonight.”
Still no beta, all mistakes are mine. Sorry.
“I think I wrote it two weeks after New Year.” Sherlock processed the information. He was luckier, than he had imagined. Everything could have gone wrong. A few days later, he had lost his will to live, too.
John mustered him intensely. “Please, tell me.” He knew that something was nagging at Sherlock. “If you can't tell me now, after everything we discussed, when else?”
After that, John took his time to look through the sniper’s phone. There was almost nothing stored  except the few photos he already found and some mails. He was quite certain, that the name of the Sniper was Sebastian Moran, because one E-Mail was sent to him with that name. It would also fit the engraved initials on the bullets. The name seemed to be familiar, but John couldn’t place it. The e-Mails ordered Sebastion to keep an eye on John and Mrs. Hudson, and were signed by someone named Harry. John took his time to open every app and check their history. He jotted down two ingoing phone numbers in the phone protocol. The only other thing he could find was a downloaded map of the Polish-Czechs Border.
This however wouldn’t be enough. Molly needed support now. She scrolled through her contacts. Beside Greg, she only had worked with Sally Donovan. Perhaps she was able to help her. She pressed the dial button.
Puh – long ride. Hope you liked it. I am done. RL is currently ... dense. So if i find the time, I might revise some of the story, but I wanted it finished.
With dread, he powered up his laptop and opened the online banking app.
After thirty minutes of waiting, a balcony door on the upper levels opened and two people came into view. John recognized the Arab prince immediately. He had been featured in the news often enough. A woman with way too flimsy clothes accompanied him. At first glance she looked like an escort. But John knew better: it was Anthea. Despite the blond wig she was clearly recognisable to John. She shivered and stepped back inside the hotel room. There she moved over to a closed balcony window door to keep warm, but she stayed in view of the prince.
Mycroft sat impervious as ever in the seat facing away from the driver. An umbrella in an eccentric red and gold pattern rested against his knees. “Hello, Dr Watson. It is good to see you.”
After finishing and stepping through the kitchen into the living room, he steeled himself for some idle chatter. However he was surprised by a running telly, and the food laid out for two on the coffee table. John sat on the couch, opening a bottle of white wine.
John's eyes widened in understanding. “Oh. Sure. Yeah.” He stood up and held out his hand for Sherlock to take. John led him to the Sherlock's bedroom. There he stopped unsure.
Moriarty stepped closer, curiosity in his eyes. “How did you do it? How did you survive the jump?”
“It isn’t. We don’t know who we can trust. Therefore your help would be very much appreciated. We do this step by step. We keep under the radar. I will look the other way, on what you do. But I know you will be fine on your own.”
Sherlock indulged in the memories how he and John became closer over time, from formal handshakes to a pad on the shoulder, and one time a hug from John after a gruesome case with a happy end. Sherlock had no delusions about himself. He knew that he was not easy to live with; his only redeeming quality was his intellect. And he knew that John only saw him as a friend and was never attracted to him. He only had himself to blame, if John thought of him as a 'machine'. Hie riled John up on purpose, to chase him away. But currently when Sherlock felt his strength waning, he couldn’t stay aloof anymore. He didn't want to be alone. He was afraid. He imagined nothing elaborate, just a scene of being in bed with John cuddling closer to him and not being rejected, enveloped in a warm and secure space, resting.
John cast his eyes searchingly around the room, avoiding Sherlock’s stare.
The other victim only had an empty wallet on him. No home address or next of kin was to be found and nobody seemed to miss him. Both victims were strangled from behind and were disposed in dumpsters in back alleys. One back alley wasn't even far away from New Scotland Yard. There was no clue regarding the killer or killers, but the method of killing was similar. Both victims were estimated to be dead for three days.
John spent his Sunday with a lot of tedious tasks. First he cleaned all of the weapons and familiarized himself with them: the gun, the sniper rifle and the Taser. The gun he got from Greg was the same as the illegal firearm he had at home: a SIG Sauer. He cleand it and reloaded the missing bullet. John always felt confident using this model.
Greg was also visibly frustrated. He was a man with high morals, and he hated the rich and mighty that could escape prosecution with diplomatic immunity. “Sometimes I wish, we were in a Bond movie and we just could deport or execute those guys,” he snarled.
Martha Hudson also startled wake up. She blinked slowly and straightened in the chair. Her eyes cast around and rested on John.
“With your information, John, we can safely say, that the third sniper is taken care of, too. That is probably him.” Mycroft put the photo down in front of John. John took a look at the picture and nodded.
“Are you okay?” John asked concerned.
Sherlock also confessed his frustration that he couldn’t have gotten close to John due to the surveillance and how any sign of him being alive would have lead to the pulling of triggers. He also explained why he had had to leave London. If he wanted to win against Moriarty, he had had to find another way to weaken him and his network. Sherlock related how he had been able to convince an old school friend of Mycroft of the conspiracy and to help him. And finally he confessed why and how Irene was still alive. She was now living in Canada. When she had heard that Sherlock was captured, she decided to come back to Europe. She had two reasons for helping Sherlock: First to repay her debts to Sherlock and second, to take revenge on Moriarty. She had parted with Moriarty in bad blood – he just played her and she was furious because of that. The mansion they were currently hiding in belonged to a trusted client of Irene and he would do anything for her.
John moved back to Baker Street six months ago. They started to rebuild and strengthen their consulting business and their friendship. Sherlock made a conscious effort for more communication and less maniac behaviour. John channelled his anger into sports and work. Back were the easy companionship, exciting cases and slow evenings with take-away food and bad telly. One year ago, he never had dared to hope, to have all that back again and he was deeply thankful.
First, John put his coat on the hanger and went to the kitchen to make tea. Some routines were hard to break.
“Is one of them Moriarty?” Sally asked.
John had an inexplicable need to find Sherlock. The more he thought about the idea of him being alive, the more he craved to be at Sherlock's side. The whole story, or the game, as Sherlock used to say, wasn’t finished. And John refused to be just a bystander. He had started the whole thing with Sherlock and he wanted to finish it – even if it was the last thing he would do. John thought back on his last two months. He had felt dead. In the first week after Sherlock’s suicide he just wanted to rage at the insanity of it, but later on felt like his feet got kicked out mid-run, his body coming to a stop and tumbling down. He had no energy left and he was just going through the motions. He had lost his target, was being dragged down by gravity and waiting to crash. But now he was being pulled by a strange force toward the Czech-Polish border, and deep down in his bones he felt that it was the right direction.
His pursuers traced his mobile as soon as they knew someone was stealing information. But the mobile was essential in transmitting his data. He could not dispose of it. When they finally hunted him down, they were quite surprised to realise, who the culprit was: Sherlock Holmes, alive.
Mycroft smiled tight-lipped and started to explain his plan.
“Why do you need alcohol, when I am confessing here?” asked John amused. “I am spilling all my secrets about my sordid past, not you.”
Sherlock looked at John. This could work. They didn't have a driving licence, but if they don't get stopped by the police, that wouldn't matter. It was a risk they were willing to take. Both nodded at the same time. Plan accepted.
“What happened to you?” John asked Greg.
Sherlock was hot and restless. He needed John to speed up. But John slowed him down and reassured him: slow caresses along his body with his hands and mouth, hot and wet kisses on lips, neck, torso and finally his member. Sherlock knew that John had never anal sex before, except the one time with Sherlock some days ago, but he also trusted John to know enough how to proceed.
“I don't mind condoms, but I like the options that open up, when you don't have to use them,” John said with a twinkle in his eyes. He found the buttons of Sherlock's dress shirt and undid them slowly.  Taking the shirt off, he pushed Sherlock backward onto the bed and crawled atop him. Sitting above him he pulled off his own T-Shirt and tossed it away. He kissed Sherlock again, enjoying the responses to his ministrations. Sherlock's hands roamed over his body. John couldn't resist to ground his hips toward Sherlock's and finding an answering bulge.
John just shrugged. He felt quite relaxed and his private mission to find Sherlock had been a striking success.
“Now, Mycroft. No need to become sentimental,” Sherlock chided softly, but with warmth.
In a last minute decision, he took the Taser out of the trunk and wrapped it into some old newspapers. With some scraps torn from a dirty vest he tied it into a small parcel. He clamped it under his arm, shouldered his backpack, grabbed the damp leather jacket and left the bolt hole.
Mycroft's eyes widened in disbelief and understanding. “You heard that? You remembered all that?”
"Oh, you'll pay for that comment, hog," he purred, taking out a chocolate cake and roughly stuffing handful after handful into the fattened-model’s plump mouth, the piggy groaning and squealing as he swelled rounder and rounder.
"J-John!" He gasped, feeling heady, light.
Sherlock was sulking so much that his water almost began tasting bitter.
He fills his mouth with the cake. Fills his hands with warm, fat folds of rich caramel lard.
This man is frankly enormous, mountainous, the remainders of his shirt stretched taught over his shoulders, a great pale belly spilling out under a very round face to meet swollen hips that look ready to tear the fine material straight in two.
John belches, feeling slow and full but not done eating, then he spies a dribble of caramel running down Greg’s chin to his chest and he seizes his chance. He bowls the man over and pins him to the floor, humming as he sucks it from Greg’s skin. Greg squeals at first but then those sounds become moans and he lays back and relaxes. He belches and John groans, daring to kiss the DI. Greg hesitates a moment, but when neither of their lover’s step in, he reciprocates hungrily, grabbing at as much of John as he can reach, sucking at his lower lip, gasping as John presses his tongue into his mouth.
Sherlock gave a soft smile, taking up the slice reverently before biting into it.
"JOHN’S supposed to be the pig not SHERLOCK! YOUVE RUINED EVERYTHING!" He slams his fists on the table repeatedly.
"A life of eating and fucking with you two? Yeah. Sounds good," he said, then popped it into his mouth and lay back against Sherlock as Greg leaned over to kiss him. John hummed, then rubbed his stomach.
Sherlock laughed. "You're absolutely right, I'm mere seconds from fading out of existence due to malnourishment." He gave his huge soft gut a smack that sent the flesh jiggling.
He coughed, accepting the wine, taking a large sip.
John threw the other man a dark grin, then slipped a hand down to pump at Sherlock's erection, reaching under flab  and jerking him off in time to his thrusts which grew more and more erratic until-
Sherlock pulls the door open and the two step into the next, bright room.
John came home to heavy smells of cooking. He was surprised as his belly gave a loud insistent rumble.
"  There’s a sickening squelch, "
"Naturally," said Sherlock bracingly, lifting up the carving knife, "Leg or breast?"
John obeys, folding to his hands and knees and looking across to find Mycroft has undressed and collared Greg in much the same fashion. The grey haired DI is now investigating their table of treats. He reaches for a heavily frosted fairy cake but withdraws as Mycroft taps his fat rump with a riding crop.
The detective frowned, noting the pine tree strewn with lights in the small living room, bows and tinsel covering damn-near everything in sight, and that
the detective arched his back, keening softly, then burping once more. He smiled lazily down at John.
"What the HELL do you mean coming here!? Why doesn't anyone stick to the SCRIPT!?" he yowls. John just keeps staring, still holding Sherlock’s hand.
"For feeding your boyfriend? He's already a fat hog, what's a little candy floss going to do?" sneers Moran.
"And yet, here I am: living, breathing, in the flesh," growled the colonel, towering over John, old but strong still. "The boss sent me."
"No, you did that. Thought you were supposed to be my friend," said John, sitting back with a sigh and rubbing his eyes. It was getting late and his buzz was winding down. Now he just felt heavy and sleepy. He was just gazing past Sherlock, his eyes wandering. until-
Everything appears to be made of sweets. Sherlock extends a long arm and pokes a finger into the 'frosting' on the televison, only to find it actually
Another six months into their game, and John is very proud of his piggy’s progress. He tells him so as he is taking his measurements, kissing soft fat padded shoulder blades as he draws the measuring tape tight around the man’s soft flabby middle. He’s moved past potbelly now, into the territory of a proper belly, a
"Mm, yeah, day off," John replied, smiling and settling in comfortably. "Just a lazy day at home. I suppose I might go for a run in a bit, though." He had another piece of toast.
"You should have seen your face though, you looked so happy, love," John murmured, grinning and leaning into his lover, "I didn't get it all the way wrong then..."
“Sorry Sherlock, but I really can’t give you-“
"Full of lies? What are you on about?" asked John, raising his eyebrows. Then he had a suspicion. Was this to do with? No... not Sherlock. That would be-oh.
"Fuck off," John snarls, raising his gun. She doesn't have to know it's empty. Her grey eyes suddenly seem to glow yellow, pupils narrowing into slits, but then they are slate gray again and she slinks past the ex-army doctor to Sherlock instead, tips the man’s chin to her on long claw-like fingers.
John chuckled and gave his lover's hand a squeeze. He knew that wasn't entirely true, but Sherlock's humor was heartening.
"What about your breakfast?" John called after him as Sherlock ambled to the loo. His gait was resembling a waddle more and more as time went on, plump flabby thighs rubbing against each other.
Sherlock clung to John with a hunger, grabbing handfuls anywhere he could, crying out the spirit’s name.
He felt John's hand in his sides, squeezing at the new, fat flesh that had grown there, his entire body jiggling wildly as John pounded into his, the soldier's thin hips crashing against his enormous ass. His massive gut shook and put pressure on his rapidly stiffening cock, waves of pleasure shooting through him
He kissed John's cheeks, his chins, nibbling up his soft jawline
"The game is on."
John wakes up for what feels like the second time today. He blinks, but his vision swims. And he is definitely not lying in bed. No, the surface his face is pressed into is cold and unbelievably hard. He blinks again, feeling panicked confusion ebb up slowly from his chest to battle with reason.
Sherlock felt all the air leave his body. It was replaced by pure light.
"Good your keeping busy though. Surgery's been rather slow lately." John wasn't exactly complaining. That meant he had more time to eat at his desk during the day. He muffled a burp and shifted back a little to take some pressure off his stomach which was now definitely pushing onto his thighs and out from under his shirt. Luckily the robe was still covering him completely. Though it was feeling bothersome and tight. He pushed the band down a bit, willing to risk it with a table between the two of them.
"Seems as good of an excuse as any," Sherlock replied blithely. "I've been trying to escape Mycroft for decades after all."
Sherlock watched with lust. With need.
"Hello. Don't think I've had the pleasure of seeing you at one of my parties before," He murmured, voice deep and low but managing to slither to the other man's ear even in the cavernous room of the aged castle as he poured him a deep red glass of wine.
“Good piggy…” Sherlock purrs, a hand slipping to John’s stomach and rubbing it delicately.
"Come on, Sherlock. I think it's this way. We've got to be getting close now." John’s foot nudges a small box. More bullets. Okay.
"I... er. With me," he answered, his face flushing almost as red as his suit, " I might have... that is..."
He signaled for Greg to stand on the other side, his crotch at the perfect level,  lip of fat resting gently on his hard and throbbing cock, which Sherlock leaned his head forward to kiss lightly at the head
"What?" he asked, though his voice was fond this time.
"And what about you? Think you can help me, officer? Or did you stuff yourself so full you can't even move?"
Sherlock returned with two over-jellied slices of toast and hyper-sugared teas with whole milk, sliding the tea over to John and munching lightly on his toast, tummy gurgling under his corset.
"Go on, piggy. Eat a whole bed," Moran directs the detective.
"So... you two piggies know where someone could get dinner? I'm fucking starving"
John grunted, trying miserably to get a hold of himself. He pointedly tried ignoring the video, trying to hear anything but the words "Feed", "piggy", and "hog".
He sipped at his tea, "Another cuppa?" He smiled, wondering how much it would take before his flat mate was sloshing
John gives the tape player a bit of a nod, as if to salute the man who met his fate before them. He looks at the large book before them and swallows. There's a new name, the ink shining against the more faded names above it: Sherlock Holmes. The weight category is smudged, but getting clearer. The doctor purses his lips and looks up at the detective again.
Good, that meant that John isn’t trapped in one room - he's up and moving. They'll find each other and figure this puzzle out together - Someone needs to be here to admire a genius at work.
"I love you, Sherlock," John offered as his only explanation, "There is... one more thing."
Sherlock’s heartbeat quickened.
“Hey, it’s all fine. I mean look at me! You know, it’s not always easy to admit but it really is nice to have a man in charge. Someone to keep y-“
"Harry told me when I was really young. I'd broken something of hers and she was feeling spiteful," explained John with a dry chuckle. He put his hat onto Sherlock's head.
Then one snapped completely and there was a cry of relief as a huge dome of a gut sprang free.
He texted Sherlock to be sure, then sat sipping at his tea and forcing himself not to think about the video. He stood and opened a few cupboards, then began gathering some... snacks, for later. Brainfood.
Sherlock knits his eyebrows together in annoyance "I’m fine John, obviously." His stomach growls loudly, and he lays a hand on it. The detective’s eyes widen in horror. It feels....soft.
*****
Sherlock's lungs were burning. He realized he'd been holding his breath and so he let it out in a long stream.
"We gotta goto bed...Father Chris*hic*christmas iz coming," he smiled, tugging John towards their bedroom.
Sherlock’s stomach gurgles and he bites his lip. He can’t stop himself from breaking off the lollipop doorknob from the door and licking it. The detective whimpers and moves towards the table, the music playing over the intercom softly.
John and Sherlock share breakfast, memories and a few fantasies.
John gasped, grunted, then moaned, grinning. "As you say," he purred, rubbing his fat arse into that long slim cock.
. He groaned, and let out a long loud burp as well. Then he sighed and his big round belly only seemed to strain further into the air, the navel stretched impossibly tight. He hummed and reached up with one arm, slipping his fingers into the detective's curls. His other was still chasing crumbs from his last carton.
Sherlock rubbed at his rolled sides, trying to sooth the redness there, one hand exploring his insanely deep navel, moving about to cup the many handfuls of fat he'd developed since that case.
Sherlock burps and groans as John hoists him up and they stumble into the next room, the door shutting behind , a few muffled screams still coming through.
"Do you really-"
"Thank you, everything looks amazing," said John, nodding and scanning the table again. The smells had been driving him mad, making his stomach clench and growl in interest. But where to start?
He hummed and lay back, rubbing his new belly idly. Yes. He saw many more years of this to come.
Whatever is in the room with him scuttles past, light glinting off a hard shell. John feel revulsion coil in his stomach. Something about the clicks and the movements reminds him of a cockroach but impossibly large. Suddenly, there's a loud electronic crackle and John sinks up against the wall to hide from this new hell.
"I do not relinquish myself to you fully until all my questions are answered. Body, yes. Soul, no. Do we have a deal?" He asked, last of his willpower desperately holding on as no less than 200 tiny Sherlocks worshipped the great, wide ass of the creature before him.
Then he bit into his own.
Ok- Facts. Sherlock’s weight is skyrocketing, there’s no stopping that now, and it appears the more often he eats the more quickly it’s converted into fat.
"J-John! Yes!!!" He begged, grabbing at every handful of the massive man he could find
"Dinner?" he asked, feeling hungry already. He'd missed his usual dinner hour to visit the scene. Now he could really do with a good Pad Thai... or two. Maybe even three if he was feeling up to it. He rubbed his belly idly and didn't even notice that John's acceptance came as an odd stutter. John insisted on getting their meals to go and bought Sherlock an extra portion of chocolate mango mousse. Which was quite nice.
The detective practically purred as he sucked the ice cream from the wafer, licking a few sweet tendrils from it before biting into the wafer with a crunch. John quickly prepared another, which Sherlock ate just as eagerly, one hand already drifting to his middle, rubbing slow tantalizing circles over it, motions he knew would drive John wild.
With one swift movement, he gave one final suck and reach over to grasp at Greg's ball, pudgy hands squeezing against the man's thick thighs.
“Closer to four actually,” Greg answers proudly through a mouthful of sugar and bacon. “What about you?”
