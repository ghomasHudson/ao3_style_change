“Good,” Cas replies agreeably. “Perhaps next time we can each masturbate each other. I have heard wh—“
“If food were just for ‘sustaining life’,” Dean’s air quotes are insulting, “we’d be eating green power shakes and bunches of kale. Food—FRENCH FRIES—are not consumed to ‘sustain life’.”
“What, for real?” Dean seems more surprised by that than anything else Sam has said. Maybe the angry atheism was more nature than nurture after all. But then Dean adds, “So I guess God’s real then? That’s cool.”
Eileen and Cas share private conversations that Sam watches with mild interest and Dean side-eyes suspiciously. Eileen is, perhaps, the only one who doesn’t tiptoe around Cas, which he appreciates beyond words. While the rest of the bunker tends to treat him like an invalid or a child, Eileen acts as though nothing has changed at all.
Sam rolls his eyes and casts his brother an annoyed look. “Whatever.” He pulls his gaze back to Cas who sits next to him forlornly at the map table. “Point is, we don’t care that you can’t be our deus ex machina anymore, all right? We’re just glad to have you back.” Sam gives Cas his signature shoulder pat before getting up and maneuvering awkwardly around the table in his walker boot.
And yet, here he is. Castiel, Angel of the Lord, face half-cast in the ambient glow of a boondock motel streetlight, considers Dean with a look that cuts right to the core of him and does not recoil in the face of the obscene, rotting parts he knows are there, roiling and aching to escape, to prove the worst parts of Dean are the truest parts, too. Castiel, Angel of the Lord, brushes the knuckles of his most vicious weapon with tender kisses.
“I have work to do,” Cas says more seriously. “But I...” He hesitates and his eyes flick to the side. Dean’s beginning to learn it’s a tell for when he’s nervous. “I wouldn’t mind...
A strange, sharp sound pierces the air and Sam stops short. He and Cas exchange a look. Cas stands and strides toward where he heard the sound, somewhere below them, off toward the east. Sam hobbles over and they pause, waiting for the sound again.
The kitten makes a valiant jump from Cas’s knee to the floor, rolling onto its back with its legs kicking as it desperately reaches for Cas’s fingers. Cas scritches its rotund belly and the kitten clasps all four paws around his hand and little teeth bite down playfully.
Sam grins and it makes his eyes brighter. “Meet me on the roof?” He doesn’t wait for an answer, rapping his knuckles twice on the door and leaving.
“Yeah, so, I thought this could be a good place to…hang out. In the summer. Bring a grill up here? I’m talking to a guy in town who’s selling a firepit, but I may just build one myself if it’s too expensive. Thought it’d be, I dunno, nice.” Sam looks at Cas as if waiting for approval.
for movie night and the aforementioned funeral is about to happen and Dean would rather not weep like a baby in front of Sam, Eileen, and Cas when Matthew recites that Auden poem.
Cas follows a limping Sam to the eastern side of the roof where there’s a sizeable empty space that looks out onto their one-lane frontage road and the surrounding disused farmland the bunker is nestled into. Sitting in the empty roof space is now a large, dark blue duffel bag, a cooler, and two camping chairs, one of which is open while the other remains folded up and leaning against the wall.
“Oh,” Dean replies, all the quips and cleverness having bled out of him the moment Cas touched him. “Yeah. We can— We can keep it on.”
The microwave beeps at him and he empties the contents into a bowl. As he nears the doorway to the movie and gaming den, he’s disappointed to note that Sam apparently paused the movie when Dean left. Great. He could feign a headache, he supposes, but then there is a delightful little thought that maybe Cas will take pity on his sorry, weeping self and let Dean spend the rest of the movie curled against him on the couch in his arms. They try to keep the PDA to a minimum with Sam around, but this is what he gets for bringing
He’s hesitated too long. He huffs out a nervous laugh. “Sorry, didn’t realize this was gonna be such a hard choice.”
The more Cas mulls it over, Jack’s deal with the Empty to get Cas out seems too good to be true and while Sam, Dean, and Jack may not want to look that gift horse in the mouth, Cas is beginning to understand the repercussions of exchanging his grace for his freedom.
They stop at a local burger joint where Cas orders a black coffee and Dean orders a burger that Cas can’t help but frown at when it arrives, an absolute tower of a heart attack.
? The sound pitches up this time, as if in question. Whatever it is, it’s clearly coming from the field below.
Once Cas gets the lumber he needs measured, cut, and loaded onto their cart, Dean makes a beeline toward the checkout area, but Cas is quick to remind him the tools they have at the bunker are less than satisfactory for this particular project. Cas peruses each saw and electric drill, weighing the various features against one another. Dean disappears and reappears every five minutes or so to sigh pointedly or lean against the cart with a grimace. Cas pretends not to notice.
“We just need the sandbags,” Sam says. When Cas gives him a confused look, Sam clarifies, “Weights for the legs so this thing doesn’t go flying off the roof the next big windstorm we have. I left them at the bottom of the stairs in the bunker. If you don’t mind.”
A thought occurs to Sam as they trek through the woods, following the GPS trail left by Dean’s phone to the place he’d been hexed just that morning. All things considered, Sam would basically be doing Dean a favor. Is it a little manipulative? Maybe. But then again, Dean let an angel set up shop in his body for months, so getting some information from him while he’s got amnesia is just tit for tat.
“Dean, although I…appreciate your willingness to finally address this, you should know I never expected you to reciprocate. And you may flatter yourself, but my current state has no relation to you or my…feelings regarding you.”
“To a human, yes. I imagine the thing that sustains your very life would be important to you, but I—“
Dean reels back as a rush of wind and a distinct loss of pressure in the atmosphere signals Cas’s abrupt disappearance. A few moments later, Cas is back holding an entire pie. Dean wonders why he and Sam haven’t been ordering angel to-go service this whole time, but that’s a conversation for another time.
The drive back is quiet and Cas’s head is pounding. He thought perhaps there would come a time when the pain was so constant that he would no longer notice it or it would at least be
It’s not a question. But Cas has this little quirk of a smile on his face that has Dean’s heart pounding in his ears.
“Fuck yeah,” Dean replies and closes the distance between them with a fervent kiss. Cas inhales sharply and returns the kiss enthusiastically, although it’s clear they’re both fighting not to smile.
“Well,” Cas says and his tongue darts out to wet his lips, Dean following the movement with great interest, “nothing we’ve done so far has been traditional. Perhaps we should keep it that way.”
Dean clears his throat again and places the book back on the bed. “So, listen, Cas. I wanted to—well, Sam said I should...” Dean drags a hand down his face and looks at Cas. “All right,” he says, coming to a decision. “I’m just gonna come out and say it.” He moves to sit on the edge of the bed but stops himself before he hits the mattress. “Shit.” He touches his bloody shirt again and then says, “Should get changed first. Let me...” He holds up a finger and Cas watches silently as he hurries out of the room.
Sam points his thumb at the duffel bag and says, “Yeah, sorry. I would do it, obviously, but with my stupid leg...”
It’s sometime later (Minutes? Hours? Time passes strangely if Cas doesn’t make a point to pay attention, the lack of natural light in the bunker disorienting) when Sam knocks lightly on Cas’s bedroom door and peeks in. “Hey.”
Dean doesn’t wait for a reply before heading off to bed and Cas considers his own bedroom. Perhaps he should try to sleep. It’s typically a futile experience, but he’s also had a couple bouts of abnormally long periods of rest where he wakes up even more exhausted. If there were ever a rhyme or reason to this graceless thing, he hasn’t discovered it yet.
Cas, on the other hand, likes to take his time. It drives Dean up the wall, even though Cas has explained any number of times that Dean has had decades to figure out which foods and supplies he likes best, while Cas is just starting. It doesn’t help that humans have created seemingly thousands of brands of the same items with little to no discernable difference between them.
Cas’s eyes flick up to Dean, then back to the fry. “I really don’t see why this is...” he trails off.
“I was actually hoping to run into you,” Sam says. “Dean told me about your...” Sam lifts a hand and lets it drop. “Problem.”
Perhaps they both had the same thought: the cold, the fact that coyotes can be heard at all hours of the night, that they’re not too far from the main road into town so traffic is a concern...
A few turns of the dials and Cas finds the zoom function, then the manual focus. Sure enough, he watches as a large cat stretches its front legs, then its back legs, before disappearing behind the front wall of the shed. Cas spots more of them, some on the roof of the building, others among the bushes and behind scrub.
When the Empty took Cas’s grace, he was scraped raw, carved out and left hollow like a decorative gourd. His entire essence was ripped from him, and so his family is left with this—the husk of a creature who bears their friend’s face, stores his memories, shares his voice, but is not him.
Dean’s not sure how he always gets saddled with popcorn duty, although he’ll be the first to admit this time he’s not too bothered by it. Sam had picked out
Dean’s about to round the corner into the room when he hears his name and pauses. He hesitates because he likes to consider himself an adult who understands boundaries, but he’s also Dean Winchester and if Sam wants to talk shit about him behind his back, then Dean deserves to hear about it so he can retaliate accordingly. He’s thinking Miracle needs a bath and maybe Sam’s bedroom is the perfect place to let loose a 60-pound sopping wet dog to dry himself off on his bedsheets.
Dean goes to lean up, but Cas holds him back with a hand to his chest. “Dean, you think very loudly.”
for fuck’s sake! You saved me and Sam more times than I can count. You took care of Jack, even when I…” Dean swallows hard and looks down, shame coloring his cheeks. “You did all of that without any thanks, when half the time I was telling you you were wrong because I was…I was
“We could always go out to see if Mom shows up,” Sam suggests. “I know we’ve got night vision binoculars somewhere, if Dean didn’t leave with them in the Impala.” Sam looks thoughtful, then says, “I’ll go look. Do you wanna—”
Dean points a finger at Cas. “Secret ingredient. Trust me, I’ve tried to get Mama to tell me, but she’s as tight as a devil’s trap.”
Dean’s plodding along behind him, boots seemingly finding every single snappy stick on the forest floor. They’re not trying to be sneaky, but it’s habit now for them to try and walk lightly.
“Yeah, right,” Dean replies and his eyes dart to Cas, then quickly away again. “Well, um, I sort of talked to Sam and he mentioned—I mean, I noticed it, too, but with you guys being stuck together these days and that kid can’t keep his nose out of anyone’s business, I can tell you that from experience. But, uh, he just said he noticed you were, um—he said I should be the one to—because, well, you’ve been sort of…” Dean swallows and Cas watches his Adam’s apple bob with detached interest. “I guess I’m asking if you’re—if everything is okay?”
“Shed’s gonna be there tomorrow, man,” Dean continues. “Why don’t you hit the hay? You can figure it out when you wake up.”
Sam doesn’t reply right away and he doesn’t look at Cas, still staring out into the darkness. Finally, he says, “Can I ask you something, Cas?”
Dean pulls back. He and Cas stare at one another and Dean sees reflected in Cas’s eyes what he’s feeling: pure, unadulterated, passionate love. And maybe a little lust, but it’s mostly love, Dean swears.
“It won’t be as good as a pie straight outta the oven, but Mama Janie's stuff pretty much tastes good no matter what. Here.” Dean takes the pie from Cas, flips around, and sits at the picnic table properly. He motions for Cas to sit opposite him and he does. Just as Dean realizes they don’t have utensils, Cas holds out a spoon.
“Okay, well, then, we hit the books. We’ll get Sam and Eileen in that library and we’ll have Sam go through his nerd catalog and find the answer!”
“C’mon, Cas! It’s not a life or death decision here. It’s a fucking drill. Just pick the most expensive one and let’s go.” Dean is slumped over the front of the cart, one hand propping up his chin, and he grimaces.
“Uh, yeah.” Not enough time to get into that particular nugget of truth. “You’re actually— Well, we are both, I guess, friends with one. An angel, I mean. Um, Cas. Castiel.”
“I will need to go to the store soon,” Cas announces. Thomas has stopped purring and his eyes are closed, fast asleep.
The landscape is fairly barren given the harsh midwest winters, but low-growing scrub brush dots the field. In the distance, perhaps two hundred yards ahead of them, little pinpricks of light shine. Cas tries to count them in pairs, but they move, disappear, and reappear too often to get a proper gauge. There are, Cas estimates, at least a dozen.
Dean’s brow furrows. “I mean, I want you to tell me the truth, to tell me what’s wrong. If it’s…me or Sam or the bunker or whatever. Do you want to leave? Because you gotta know, man, we’d never stop you from moving on from this place. It’s not exactly what you signed up for, so I understand if you don’t wanna stick around.”
“Cas,” Dean says, trying the name out. He frowns. “Can’t say I remember the name but…” He pats his chest once more before letting his hand fall. “Good for me,” he concludes.
Just like that. Dean will never admit to this, but privately he has thought about it. Big romantic gestures involving flowers and music, and quieter proposals whispered in the dark, in their bedroom, against the nape of Cas’s neck. Dean’s always been too scared, too unsure of Cas and his thoughts on the decidedly antiquated ritual of marriage. Cas saying no is basically the worst thing Dean can imagine, and he’s seen some shit in his time. Besides, it’s only been three months.
Sam sits heavily in the camping chair and huffs. “Swear to God, it’s only been, what? Two weeks? And I’m already out of shape just from some stairs.” He pushes his hair back and squints against the sun at Cas.
Sam’s leg leaves him homebound for the foreseeable future. This is at first a godsend because it means Dean picks up case duty with Eileen, and Cas no longer has to shove food down his gullet for fear of upsetting Dean who, in spite of his impenetrably thick skin, looked moved to tears when Cas tried to skip out on dinner one night when he didn’t feel up to the charade of playing human. But as it turns out, having Sam around the bunker with nowhere to go is just as problematic, if not more so. Because Sam’s perception of others’ emotional states around him is so much more adept than Dean’s, Cas is suddenly forced to playact a lot more often. It doesn’t help that Sam seems to appear around every corner, in the kitchen or library or shooting range, ready to have cheery conversations. It’s clear he’s desperate for companionship and Cas wishes he were in a place to provide that, but every second is a struggle. All he can do is try to stay tucked in his own room as long as he feasibly can without attracting Sam’s worry.
of my grace. I was not made with a human soul. I have…nothing.” Cas opens his hands and then lets them fall closed.
Cas looks at the book laying on the bedspread in front of where he sits cross-legged. He’d forgotten it was there; he hasn’t touched it since this morning. Reading takes energy Cas doesn’t have. Even when he can convince himself to read, he has difficultly absorbing the words.
“I can’t say Dean or I really explored much of the land around here. And it’s pretty broken down…” He trails off. “I think they’re all…cats.”
the same, but then why are they called different names? One is “organic” and the other is “all natural” and Cas has no idea what either actually means. All the while, his head pounds, the pain growing sharper and more pronounced as he glares at the bright font on the boxes.
When the server returns, Dean puts on a polite smile. “We’re gonna need to order a plate of fries. Just a big ass plate.” Dean holds his hands apart roughly platter-sized. “Biggest you got.”
Dean’s hand—the one not wrapped around Cas’s back—curls into Cas’s hair and pulls lightly. It must be all right since Cas stutters out a soft “oh” and his head drops to Dean’s shoulder.
and only grouse about it being a chick flick for thirty seconds (he hasn’t completely tossed his reputation for hating girly shit in the trash; but he’ll never admit it’s because the girly shit makes him soft and he’s not sure his heart can take that right now) before accepting Sam’s declaration that ”it’s a classic” and absolutely required watching for Cas. Plus Eileen points out it’s one of the only movies with a deaf character whose entire plot isn’t centered around the fact that he’s deaf, even if he is a minor character.
Dean finally looks over at his brother in the doorway who is trying his best to look peeved, but he can’t help smiling.
“Cas,” Dean starts, but then doesn’t know what to say, doesn’t even know if he was going to say anything at all, thinking maybe he just wants to say his name out loud, like an invocation, like a prayer.
Cas leans down and presses a comparably chaste kiss against the side of Dean’s mouth. “Until later, then, Dean Winchester,” he murmurs.
However, Sam, ever the bleeding heart, says, “Obviously we’re not gonna do that, so I said we’d foster it until they found a home. I’m gonna head down there now—there’s stuff to sign and they have a bunch of info. Plus they’re gonna supply us with everything—food, litter, meds. They also said they’ve got advice for our new cat colony, so I’ll let you know what they say about that.”
“Hey,” Dean says and his voice cracks like the fucking traitor it is. He clears his throat. “Sorry. I’ll have to make another bowl.”
Cas looks back out into the night as he considers the question. “It’s as though I have these things, these feelings inside of me that I know were there and now that they’re gone, their absence is felt at an indescribable level. But I’m not…fully capable of feeling their loss
“I don’t mind,” Cas says, and he finds that he means it. It’s a welcome change of scenery, if nothing else. Plus, it feels surprisingly good to move his body beyond its typical route of bedroom to bathroom and back again with occasional stops at the kitchen for necessary meal breaks.
“So,” Dean says. He’s once again incapable of not smiling. He’s not even sure why he finds Cas’s love of fries so delightful. Maybe it’s the fact that he lied about it.
One night when Dean has cooked up a truly spectacular array of dishes, Eileen furrows her brow and signs,
Dean closes his eyes tightly, willing the impending headache away. “What happened? Everything okay?” He sits up and Cas stands, finally taking a step back.
Sam sees his chance and he takes it. “And, you know, there’re other monsters, too. Like, uh, sirens.”
“When I first came to earth, it was advised that we temper the senses bound to our vessels. They were a distraction, we were told. An antiquated form of experiencing existence that would hinder our ability to complete our missions, whatever that may be. My true form can better facilitate these experiences. What you would recognize as heightened senses of sight and sound, among other things.”
Cas smiles widely at that, his nose crinkling in that way that makes Dean understand why people swoon when they’re in love in old movies. Fuck, he really loves this guy.
Dean pulls himself into Cas’s space, their hands still clasped between them. “I also don’t have a ring,” Dean says.
Cas only hesitates a moment before following orders, and Dean is once again forced to convince himself his staring at Cas’s mouth as he chews is merely for educational, friendly purposes. But then Cas lets out an unholy moan that causes Dean’s entire midsection to do a somersault and his face warms.
Soullessness, at its core, removes empathy. Cas loves this chosen family of his and would be upset if anything were to happen to them, but how much of that is ritual, a pattern he has followed for more than a decade that’s embedded itself into his very DNA, like genetic memory?
Cas studies Dean’s face, the earnest concern in his eyes, the soft smattering of freckles that have dimmed in the winter months, the way his mouth pulls down slightly. “What would you like me to say?” Cas asks.
Cas studies Sam’s open expression with interest. It causes something soft to stir in Cas’s chest. “Thank you, Sam.”
Cas lifts a hand in vague acknowledgment before grabbing a box of oatmeal and turning it over to look at the back. He’s waiting for Dean to move on, as is his prerogative during these trips, but he just moves the cart forward inch by inch as Cas makes his way slowly down the aisle, not even complaining.
“What’s a cat colony doing all the way out here?” Sam wonders. “Don’t they usually hang out around, like, old ladies’ homes? Where they get fed? What’s the food source out here?”
“Okay, well, they’re at least hot chicks who lure men to their deaths, right? We need more hot chick monsters.”
“But not you. You were never afraid. Just…hopeful.” Dean’s tone is slightly awed. “Every time it looked like we were truly and totally fucked, you never gave up. And you always see the best in people, even when they…even when I don’t deserve it.” Dean rubs his eye with the back of his hand and sniffs. He shakes his head and then looks at Cas.
The earnest lilt of his voice tells Cas fairly unequivocally that Dean informed him of their soul-related conversation.
I do that same thing Cas does to Dean except it's me seeing innocuous pictures of my best friend castiel on tumblr dot com and absolutely losing it for no reason
For some time after Jack brought Cas back from the Empty, it was as though he’d been plunged into a deep and murky pool, struggling to keep above the surface. He remembers that feeling from the first time, always two steps behind his own emotions, surprised by the intensity of them and how they bled from him, raw and gaping like a wound. So he settles into this new way of experiencing life by distracting himself as best he can. This isn’t difficult, since they all have simultaneously shifted into alarmingly different phases of their lives.
Sam’s smile is strangely endearing and Cas narrows his eyes. It’s the same sort of look he’s used to getting when he’s the butt of some joke, but he can’t pinpoint what on earth Sam could be laughing at him for. Cas heads back inside and down the stairs where he sees four large, black weights stacked neatly to the side. He must have missed them when he came upstairs because they’re tucked into a dark corner. He sees them now, however, and sighs defeatedly at the
Cas tilts his head and furrows his brow. “And whose soul should he subsume to create this grace for me, Dean? Which human do you deem lesser than so that they can be a sacrifice? And there’s no reason to believe the grace created would sustain me. It still wouldn’t be mine. Jack is many things, but creating a soul out of nothing may still be beyond his powers.”
It was Dean’s idea to let Thomas out of his bedroom jail for a little bit as the kitten had apparently been crying nonstop for close to an hour, sated only when Cas visited briefly. Dean said only a real sadist could let the poor guy continue on like that, and Cas was happy to oblige. He was worried at first that Thomas would take the initiative to explore the bunker, an endless cavern of rooms with places to get lost and items to hurt him—or worse—but Thomas stuck to Cas’s side like a duckling to its mother.
Dean clicks his tongue, shaking his head. “Hate to break it to ya, pal, but you’ve got a terminal illness.”
Cas is once again grateful for the all-encompassing apathy blooming bleakly in his core. He’s prepared himself for every iteration of Dean’s rejection, but surely nothing will compare to the real thing, to seeing Dean in the flesh and hearing him say in his gruff and halting speech that he’s flattered, but no thank you. His eyes will shine with pity and condescension and Cas will shoulder it bravely.
So it’s nice not to feel, sometimes. Maybe that’s why he doesn’t delve too deeply into figuring out what this absence of feeling must mean, because he secretly desires that cold, distant nothing feeling. The more likely reason is that Cas already knows what’s wrong with him. He’s not looking it in the face, not acknowledging the truth of it that sits heavily on his shoulders, pinning him to the earth with its undeniable presence.
Dean plucks one off the shelf and hands it to Cas. “Return to the Big Valley,” Cas reads. “You know I always appreciate your reading recommendations, Dean,” Cas says carefully, not wanting to insult him if this happens to be a favorite, “but I believe this is a sequel.”
When Cas doesn’t continue, staring into middle space contemplatively, Dean clears his throat. “Well, it sounds like you deserve a human senses crash course.”
of it are one and the same. A fallen angel who chooses to fall, like his sister Anna once did, is reborn with their own body and their own soul. A shortcut, Cas thinks, that God designed with the knowledge that some of his first creations may envy humanity to the point of descent. Grace removed, such as Metatron did those many years ago, leaves a trace behind like a homing beacon, the same remnant found in any angel’s vessel after their inhabitant’s departure. It was how Cas could sense his own grace back in that library and hear Claire’s prayers so many years ago.
Cas contemplates the pros and cons of telling Dean the truth. He knows telling Dean will elicit any number of reactions, the most certain of which is his determination to somehow fix it. An inevitable impossibility. But he will have to know soon enough. Dean is nothing if not dogged in his approach to getting answers and there are only so many excuses Cas can give before there is only one answer left.
“Fuck, dude!” Dean says and before he thinks twice about it, he grabs Cas’s wrist and pulls him up from the table, leading him to the Impala. Cas comes without a fight and Dean doesn’t dwell on what it means that this millions-year-old celestial being is allowing Dean Winchester to manhandle him in a motel parking lot.
Cas seems to mull that over for a moment. “Yes and no. I hear remarkably less than what my true form could, but...” His tongue darts out to wet his lips, something he probably doesn’t even register, and it has Dean’s heart beating a staccato on his ribs. Too much caffeine, he supposes.
Everything in Cas rebels against the idea and he’s already coming up with arguments about the cold snap they’re expecting when Sam says, “Well, I don’t know. I mean, it seems pretty skinny. Makes me think Mom isn’t around anymore. Maybe something happened.”
Dean hums thoughtfully. “No, I guess not. And I wonder—" Dean shakes his head and stares down at his plate, brow furrowed.
“I got good news and bad news,” Sam announces the next morning as he steps into the bathroom and closes the door behind him. Cas is seated cross-legged on the floor with the kitten in his lap on its back scrabbling out with razor sharp claws to catch the tie on Cas’s hoodie. It’s technically Dean’s hoodie, Cas realizes belatedly, but if he’s noticed it missing, he hasn’t said anything and the bunker is unbearably cold at night.
“I think we can both agree we know what being soulless entails. Dean, I am not postulating. This is…the reality of the situation.”
1. Rahul Kohli plays Dr. Gregory in the film version of this that exists in my mind. They're literally the most attractive person and I think Cas (or anyone) would be hard-pressed to resist their charms.
Cas gives Dean a suspicious look but puts them on anyway. He stares at Dean, who is now marginally closer, his vision distorted around the edges. Dean smiles and Cas almost takes the glasses off, sure he’s being made fun of, but then Dean’s expression changes to something less amused and more fond. Before Cas can think any more on that, Dean clears his throat and taps the cover of the book in Cas’s hand. “Give it a go,” Dean says.
“Cas, I can’t be…the person you think I am. And if this—the not eating, the not sleeping, the disappearing for days at a time to be alone and not talk to anyone—if that’s because of
“I suppose I never considered it,” Cas is saying, his voice low but carrying in the quiet of the room. “There isn’t much that’s traditional about what we are.”
Sam snorts a laugh. “I wish it were that easy. Sorry, dude, but there’re, like, a billion demons. Well, more like thousands if I had to guess."
When they’re home, Sam is watchful and careful, his words soft and earnest when he speaks to Cas, which Cas recognizes as a kindness, but he still can’t help be a little irritated all the same. Sam’s incessant need to ensure everyone around him is okay, whatever that may mean to him at the time, puts Cas on edge, always struggling to maintain a neutral façade in case Sam tries to question him.
“You have a freckle on your lip,” Cas says softly as his thumb slides across Dean’s bottom lip. He says it barely louder than a whisper, but Dean still feels Cas’s warm breath mix with his own and it makes everything inside him feel alive, electric.
Dean’s heart sinks. He should’ve figured as much. It’s not like they need something as basic as marriage to solidify what they have. It’s already perfect. Don’t fix what ain’t broke, right?
Cas rubs his nose and finds graphite on his fingers. It doesn’t help him feel better, although Dean seems to find it mildly amusing judging by the upward pull of his mouth.
“Sure, yeah, true,” Sam replies. “But it’s not just about tradition, y’know. Anyway, I was just curious. You guys don’t have to do anything, obviously. But I just…” There’s a pause and Dean can almost perfectly conjure the image of Cas’s prying look in his mind, aimed right at Sam. “Dean’s a romantic,” Sam says finally.
Cas sighs. “Are you really saying you would spend an eternity in hell just so Jack won’t...what? Be accused of nepotism?”
Dean bites back a remark about SAT words. “Oh shit,” Dean says, a realization hitting him at full force. “Cas! You’ve never listened to music!”
“If you’re jealous, you can just say so,” Dean says and takes a too-large bite. He grins childishly and Cas can’t help but smile a little, even as he shakes his head in disapproval.
Sam pulls a half smile, sad and understated. “Yeah.” Sam drops his hand from Cas’s shoulder and Cas takes a small step back.
Guilt tinged with regret is the first real thing Cas has felt in a while and he’s almost delighted by it when it comes, but it passes when Sam replies, “Seriously, Cas? C’mon. I mean, yeah, it’d be super awesome if you could just,” he presses two fingers to his own forehead, “but we spent years without your angel powers and we did just fine.”
Once he makes it to where he approximates the sound came from, he looks up. He can just see the silhouette of Sam’s upper body from above and Sam shakes his head no to indicate he hasn’t heard anything else.
this body standing before Dean for the very first time. Cas’s eyes are slightly more reflective, somehow more opaque than normal and his mouth... Dean shuts down that thought and diverts his attention to his Impala parked some 30 feet away, sleek and shining with evening condensation.
Cas sighs, his breath fogging the air and Dean notices for the first time that there is something different about the angel. Something almost imperceivable, like when someone moves a piece of furniture half an inch and you don’t notice until you do and then that’s
A finger taps on the paper Cas is scribbling on and his head shoots up; he hadn’t even known Dean was there. Cas has been holed up in the library scribbling away while Dean, likewise, has been perusing the newfound tomes from the Newport chapter house, the books spread haphazardly on one table while he combs through a smaller stack on another.
This took me FOREVER to write and I'm glad to finally be posting it. This fic is what happens when you spend a year stuck in bumfuck, appalachia fostering kittens for a local rescue while also dealing with crippling depression. The transference is real, y'all.
Cas nearly rolls his eyes; the sentiment is there, at least. Instead, he turns from Dean as Dean steps onto the seat of the picnic table and sits on the top. Cas takes a couple steps, then turns back toward Dean.
The achingly familiar guitar plucks out a tune so intrinsic to Dean’s childhood and, frankly, to his present.
“Agh! Miracle! Stop it! Fuck,” Dean makes an aborted attempt to stop Miracle, but he looks like he’s discovered the holy grail, his tail wagging a mile an hour as he hoovers up the popcorn.
There must be a dozen or more different missing cat posters. Each one is more gregarious in print size and color as they have been layered on top of one another. The reward money ranges from $100 to someone offering to pay $1 million for the safe return of their pet.
Cas huffs a laugh and leans against the doorway. Dean’s still on the floor and he thinks about standing but he’s not entirely sure his legs would hold him up because—
Cas is staring at Dean, which is disarming at the best of times, but Dean tamps down any pesky feelings before reaching toward Cas’s feet and pulling out the box of cassette tapes from under the seat. “Time to introduce you to some real fuckin’ music,” Dean says.
Dean’s jaw clenches and Cas can practically hear the gears turning as Dean puts everything together. “I’m not following. I mean, Metatron took your grace before and you didn’t…”
Sam brandishes his cell phone and says, “Just got off the phone with the local shelter. So, they’re full right now. There’s a thing called ‘kitten season’ which is...exactly what it sounds like, I guess. Weather turns warmer and kittens are everywhere. So they said we can bring our kitten in, but there’s no guarantee that they’d be able to get him adopted...”
As the last riffs of “True Confessions” fade out, Dean glances over at Cas. He’s going to make some comment, some qualifying statement about the song, the band, the lyrics to ensure Cas that it’s okay if he doesn’t enjoy it. It would devastate Dean just a little, but really, it’s fine. But Cas has his eyes closed, face passive, completely tuned in and Dean swallows his doubts.
“Seriously, Cas,” Sam says imploringly, “you should just eat the fry before Dean makes a scene. He may actually force-feed it to you if you hold out any longer.”
Cas makes relatively quick work of the assembly with Sam reading out the directions from his seat. It must be only 40 degrees out and steadily dropping as the sun goes down, but Cas finds his flannel is plenty to keep the chill away. His fingers are turning red and slightly numb as he slides the last piece into place. The skeleton of the thing isn’t much to look at, but there’s still a niggling feeling of achievement when Cas steps back and regards this structure he put together.
“I’m sure whatever you choose is fine, Dean. I trust you.” Cas’s soft rumble sates the gnawing anxiety in Dean’s gut.
Cas raises an eyebrow at Dean. “You have the ‘magical credit card’.” Cas makes air quotes, mostly because it always makes Dean smile.
“Our first conversation is going to be about what you can and cannot say out loud to me. Ever. Under any circumstances.”
you notice. It’s the way Cas holds himself, his posture, and his hands at his sides that move more naturally where before he had the stature and countenance of a toy soldier. It’s like he’s finally
Cas feels it bubbling up inside of him, unbidden and seemingly unprovoked as Dean speaks until he bursts into laughter. It’s uncontrollable, hysterical, and he tries to quash it, but each attempt only makes him laugh harder.
When Cas thinks of the distant future, he doesn’t see anything at all. What once was a road map of infinite possibilities, the absolute splendor of free will and the endless opportunities it provides, is now a great swathe of nothing. It should depress him, make him grieve over something lost, but instead there is something that is uncomfortably close to relief. Having nothing in the future means an end to what he’s experiencing now. It means he can finally rest and stop playacting this version of himself that is for everyone’s benefit but his own. He doesn’t know what that ending looks like or when it will come, but its very existence brings him comfort like no other thing does.
“‘Modern human courting’?” Dean cuts in. “Who am I, Jane Austen? Christ, just...get out of here. We can talk later.” Hopefully when his heart rate is back to a livable pace and he can think straight.
“Probably for the best.” Sam takes a drink from his beer and stares into the distance. The sun has set into twilight, a dark purple hue ringing the horizon with the first few stars just starting to appear.
“Okay, then is it…” Dean trails off and looks pleadingly at Cas like he wants Cas to finish the sentence for him. Dean lets out a long, slow breath. “Right,” he says quietly, almost to himself. “I’m sorry. I should’ve…a long time ago. When you got back. But then everything just…” He gestures vaguely, then lets his hand fall into his lap. “Cas, you gotta know, I…I mean, all that shit you said? About me and
Secondly, posting schedule should be Tuesdays and Thursdays from now on. Everything has been written, there's just minor editing that has to be done. If there are any minor content warnings for each chapter, I'll be sure to post them in the chapter notes at the end and let you know at the beginning, but honestly this fic is largely introspective and also sometimes there are cats. Enjoy.
Sam lifts the night vision binoculars to his eyes and slowly turns to scan the area. “Most mammals have this thing called the tapetum lucidum behind their retina that reflects light and these binoculars should pick it up, too, making any living things a lot…easier to… Oh shit.”
Cas side-eyes Dean and sees the red creeping up his neck to his face as he stumbles over his words. Then Dean turns and gives Cas a lopsided smile in earnest.
“Yeah, actually, everyone kinda has their own siren specially for them that gives them, y’know, what they most desire.” Sam swallows but figures now or never. “Your siren was a dude, actually.” He keeps his tone light and casual. He itches to change the subject, because if this were fully Dean, they’d be so far away from this conversation it’d be in a different state.
Especially after what happened. How, even after spelling it out, Dean still acts as though nothing has changed. For all intents and purposes, nothing
Sam tries to hide his feelings, but that’s never been his strong suit, and the flood of joy mixed with self-righteous triumph (because he knew!) is overwhelming.
, the way his voice is deeper and raspier than usual and Dean can feel Cas’s voice vibrate in his own chest.
This time, he feels…empty. He rolls the irony of the word around in his mind. Listless, hopeless. Empty.
Cas frowns and turns his attention back to the kitten who has moved on to attacking the cuffs of Cas’s jeans. “So, we should put him back outside?”
Cas barks a laugh, surprising himself and causing some of the cats to skitter away again in fright. “No, Dean wasn’t lying. But that was a feature of my grace, unfortunately. And I couldn’t
Dean presses his hand to his forehead and says, “Holy shit, I am, aren’t I? I can kinda… It’s weird, but I can actually kinda feel something. It’s, uh…” He puts a hand over his heart and pats it a couple times. “Here. It’s weird. Like, I can feel the truth of that here.” He pauses. “That’s so friggin’ sappy. Am I usually this sappy?” He lets out a long breath. “Damn, that angel must’ve done a number on me, huh?”
Cas is too. Regardless, he’s suddenly feeling much more exposed here in the open field with no visibility. “We should go,” Cas says and with one last look at the curious eyes of their new feline tenants, they head back inside the bunker.
Cas is sure he’s supposed to be thankful, but he can’t quite find the appropriate words to say. Sam fills the void by adding, “Actually, that’s why I wanted to find you. Dean and Eileen left earlier this morning.”
“Yes,” Cas cuts in. “I would like to join you.” If they can find the kitten’s mother, Cas will feel better about this now possible kidnapping. He wonders what they will do with the mother cat if they do see her, because he’s still not on board with returning the poor kitten to the cold, but that’s a bridge they’ll cross when they get there.
“Oh!” Cas says, eyes widening in surprise. “Is it? My understanding of modern human courting seemed to—“
Dean rubs a hand down his face and glances at the red numbers glaring at him from the clock on the bedside table. 3:02 AM. Figures. Sam is in the next bed seemingly dead asleep. That also figures. He could sleep through a tornado ripping through their house—and he had, more than once, back in Kansas, before everything.
Cas’s left hand traces a path from Dean’s cheek to his neck where his curious fingers press gently at the nape of his neck.
“Thank you for the support,” Cas replies, turning away to head back to their abandoned shopping cart.
Dean’s face falls. “Oh.” His eyes narrow slightly. “Well, all right. Okay, that’s…good. I think. So, wait. Do you—why are you…in this ‘state’ then?” Dean makes little bunny ears with his fingers that Cas tracks with fondness.
It’s true that the nuances of human affection and relationships escape Cas. His first attempts at showing Dean his feelings, as convoluted as they were, were faulty if well-intentioned.
“Speaking of, Sam’s worried about you.” Dean says it lightly and takes another sip of beer, playing casual, but his lack of eye contact betrays his anxiety.
and a stirring of the air in their otherwise stale, dark motel room doesn’t startle him. Cas is known for showing up at any time or place with little regard for sleep schedules or appropriateness of dress.
It’s a squat, brown brick building. Outside the glass double-doors is a bulletin board behind plastic that’s scratched with graffiti—initials, hearts, and rude language. It makes it hard to see some of the messages posted on the board, but Cas doesn’t need to see the details.
A giddiness rises in Dean’s chest, which is unexpected. Aftershocks of necking an angel, he supposes.
Cas accepts the truth with no discernable trouble and only falters on what to do with the information.
“Perhaps nothing,” Cas finally answers. “I may be...” He trails off and Dean hesitates to interrupt because regardless of the ridiculousness of the conversation, it seems important to Cas that he explain this to Dean.
“No!” Dean cuts in quickly. “No, you didn’t do anything. I’m not—“ He huffs out a breath that’s supposed to be a laugh but ends up sounding more like a stifled cry.
“What I do hear—the crickets, the wind, the generator,” Dean follows Cas’s gaze to the buzzing machine by the motel’s front entrance. “It’s more harmonious. An orchestra of sound instead of a dissonant clashing of reechoes.”
Dean has nothing to say to that, and the way Cas is looking at him, at Dean of all people, like he’s a work of art to be appraised or even adulated. Dean can think of one way to make him stop, so he closes the gap between them, pressing his mouth to Cas’s.
“Christ,” Dean breathes. Then, since his chest feels lighter than ever, he adds, ”Do you and Sam both keep a thesaurus handy, like, all the time? It’s so obnoxious.”
Dean slams a hand over Cas’s mouth before he can finish. He stops talking but gives Dean a withering look.
feel a certain way about things. For example, he should feel elated to have a bedroom he can call his own, he should be grateful to be living in a world without a petulant god’s rule, he should show more gratitude to Sam and Dean who have taken him in without question. Instead, he is twice removed from the sentiment, as if watching a facsimile of himself from behind glass go through the motions. And on top of everything else, he’s not entirely interested in breaking through that glass. The penetrating fatigue is bone-deep, sapping him of all motivation, even in his own mind.
Sam can’t help but smile a little. “Yeah, it is nice. He’s smart and kind and funny sometimes and you guys fight like an old married couple, but it’s…yeah, it’s nice. Couldn’t have chosen a better angel for my brother, if that were a thing.”
Except this hadn’t happened the first time he was human. Before, every minor inconvenience, every interaction had left Cas drained, tired, and aching for a comfort he knew he could never ask for. And the overwhelming inundation of feeling never ceased, never even dulled in its intensity.
Cas reaches out a hand and Dean takes it. Cas pulls him to his feet. “You didn’t even tell me you loved me,” Cas points out.
Cas is too burnt out to explain that the likelihood of him sleeping is marginal at best and he therefore may as well be spending his time doing something useful. He’s saved from having to reply by the kitten, who wakes from his spot in the glow of the reading lamp to Cas’s right and pads over, only to flop down directly on the sketchpad.
of that loss.” Cas takes a sip of his beer for something to do as he looks at the thing inside of him in the face for the first time in a while and tries to put words to it. “But I know I
Dean somehow takes that as an invitation to enter. Even in the dim light from the lamp, it’s clear it was a total bloodbath. Cas tries to remember what color Dean’s shirt was before he left this morning. Certainly not the ruddy brown it is now.
“Ask me,” he repeats and Dean can see the mirth in his eyes. The little shit loves seeing Dean squirm, but two can play at that game.
Dean clenches his jaw in surprise and sits back in the booth (when did he lean forward?) “Adequate,” he repeats.
This is demonstrated perfectly by the cereal boxes Cas is currently clutching in either hand, his eyes darting from one box to the other. Everything
“Oh jeez,” Dean replies and Sam has to glance backwards to see the look of sincerity on Dean’s face to believe it. He looks genuinely upset at the news. Sam is so used to the emotional constipation, it’s a bit jarring seeing it all out in the open like this.
“I am merely telling the truth. In the celestial plane, the idea of only five senses is laughable. In fact, there’s a wonderfully entertaining joke about it in Enochian.” Cas’s lips have quirked into a small, reflective smile, but it falters at the deepening frown on Dean’s face.
-ational?” Dean’s heart drops when he thinks he’s ruined the moment with his stupid jokes and his stupid mouth.
Cas finds it distantly amusing that in spite of his weariness, he still can’t sleep. He’d struggled with the ritual the first time he was human. People really cannot fathom how strange it is to simply turn oneself off every day or so when one has spent billions of years awake. Still, he tries, and more often than not, he fails. He figures in between the stops and starts of his attempts he’s averaging a couple hours or so a night, but he’s more likely to stay awake for days at a time before crashing for a comparatively restful three or four hours.
Dean seems to be ramping up to something serious. What else could it be about except what Cas had confessed all those months ago? Why does Dean want to talk about it now? And what does Sam have to do with any of this? It’s possible Dean shared the details of the event with his brother; perhaps Sam has convinced Dean to address the situation.
“Can humanity not make one single task simple? Why must you complicate everything?” Cas grouses. He decides against reading any ingredients and selects the cheapest one instead.
Cas buries his face in his hands until he can breathe properly again and then wipes the tears from his eyes. He’s still smiling, he can’t help it. When he finally looks at Dean, he seems stuck somewhere between panicked and amused.
“Can we—” Cas stops himself from finishing that sentence. Cas is a burden as it is, especially with the way he’s been feeling. Or
As a roommate, Sam is incredibly considerate. While it’s true that their private interactions up to this point have largely revolved around Dean: helping him, saving him, and ensuring his oft-suicidal missions aren’t successful, Cas will admit he’s always had an appreciation for Sam’s softer, more sincere temperament when compared to his brother’s. Dean is often so tightly wrapped in his own emotional restraints that Cas doesn’t know where he stands, how to act, or what to say.
“I...am so sorry,” Sam says. Although even from upside-down, Dean can just tell he’s secretly delighted. “I woke up and— Well, you were gone so— But here you are! Um.”
As they draw closer, Cas intermittently holds up the binoculars. The lights flicker in and out of view, but they don’t seem to be retreating. A hundred yards away, he realizes the creatures are hiding within a small copse of trees with thin trunks and tall, bare limbs. Behind the brambles and bushes on the ground, there’s a small wooden structure of some kind in a sad state of disrepair.
"I'm bringing you home. Now come on." Dean helped Cas get up, and once Cas was on his feet, he was suddenly pulled in for a hug, with Dean wrapping his arms around Cas tightly. Cas, still weary of the situation they were in, quickly returned the hug and then broke apart.
Cas tried to block the voice out of his head. It hurt so much to hear Dean so desperate, but he couldn't ignore Dean, even if it were just a trick to make him suffer.
changed, because that would require Dean acknowledging that Cas told him in no uncertain terms that he loves him. Cas isn’t sure if he can be more explicit than that, if he can prove it any better than by being wrenched into oblivion for it.
Cas goes to the bag and sees what it is based on the image emblazoned on the front. “A gazebo?” Cas asks.
“Thank you.” Cas hopes his appreciation is seen as sincere enough to allow his escape without further questioning.
Dean looks down at himself with a frown. “Ah, yeah, fuck.” He pulls the shirt away from his chest and grimaces. “Kind of a messy one.”
“I wonder....“ Cas pauses, eyes flicking down. It causes his eyelashes to brush his cheeks. It’s a brief reprieve for Dean from his discerning gaze. “Could I—“ He looks back up at Dean.
Cas watches the buildings in downtown Lebanon roll past, four square blocks to its name. His eye catches on the community bulletin board in front of the post office and he sits up straighter.
“I do not. Wait— Are you reading my fucking mind?!” Dean is absolutely mortified, but then he recognizes the shit-eating grin on Cas’s face, even if it's not nearly as obvious or obnoxious as Sam's.
“Yeah,” Sam says and he finally meets Cas’s gaze. “From your…grace thing. Or lack-of-grace thing, I guess. How do you feel?”
noticeable. Unfortunately, it only seems to grow in intensity each day. He doesn’t think glasses are going to cure him of it, as sure as Dean is that they will.
Cas would be insulted if he had the energy for it. Instead, he brings his hand to his forehead to try and rub away the impending headache. “Dean, that’s not—"
Ah. That explains Dean’s particularly egregious show of impatience. Cas glances at his phone and sure enough, it’s nearing one in the afternoon. He makes an executive decision, selects a drill, and puts it in the cart.
Cas looks back at the book and is a little floored by the significant difference between his regular vision and that with the glasses. But more than that, he’s suddenly very aware of how mortal he is. He’s confronted with the fact that he does not have nearly the amount of control over himself as he used to and it’s disconcerting, to say the least. Change isn’t always a good thing, he thinks bitterly. He certainly wouldn’t have to worry about this as an angel. But then he glances at Dean who is staring back with that look on his face again, something close to fondness, but Cas has never been the best at reading expressions. Perhaps Dean
Time passes, enough for the cold to seep in and numb the tips of Cas’s ears and fingers and nose. Perhaps ironically, he finds this kind of numbness comforting, a reminder that he is present and living. He hasn’t always felt that way in the past weeks, drifting in and out of whatever this graceless abstraction is.
They walk in silence, just the crunch of gravel sounding as they make their way across the parking lot. Dean beelines toward the rotting wooden picnic table stuck in a small grassy patch adjacent to the main office of the motel.
The marked difference in Dean’s countenance when Cas takes that first bite is surprising. It’s like Dean’s been waiting all day to get Cas to eat that burger, despite the fact that it only got to their table five minutes ago. It occurs to Cas then that his behavior must be causing Dean a remarkable amount of stress. The realization sits uncomfortably in his middle, hot and roiling just below his diaphragm. He hasn’t been faking it well enough, he realizes. He’s let this thing, this numbness, come too close to the surface. He must be better about his façade in the future, he decides. That should assuage Dean’s worry at the very least, until...
Dean thinks that’s it, that Cas will pull away and they’ll go back to discussing pie or whatever the fuck, because where could this possibly go? Dean’s heart is still beating a mile a minute and it may just break through his rib cage if Cas doesn’t let go of his hand soon.
Cas breaks the kiss first and Dean whimpers at the loss of contact, because he’s pathetic and needy. He also doesn’t super care at this moment, and pulls Cas in again by his jacket (when had he clutched his jacket?) Cas relents, but only briefly before he pulls back again.
There is a panic building in Dean’s throat, threatening to burst and force his hands to eject the tape. This was a stupid song to pick. It’s too much, too close to a truth Dean’s not willing to look in the face. He thinks, what if Cas looks over and questions his choice, asks why he chose this song, and, well, Dean could stick to his guns. He could tell Cas that sometimes—most times—this is like the keynote for his life. He will drive head-first into peril without regard because that’s his job. And he’s over the notion of that ever changing for him, he’s over pining for a normality that was never in reach. But in the back of his mind, a niggling itch remains. Dean won’t stop, he won’t change, but if he could find an equal, someone to face the darkness with... There’s Sam. Of course there’s Sam. It’s always been Dean and Sam, but Dean’s aware that Sam carries within him the propensity for a life outside of hunting, outside of monsters and bleeding and fucking dying every goddamn year. Sam could have more. And maybe Dean could, too, in a different way. With Cas.
The Shadow gave an evil grin, then reached out a hand towards Dean and pulled their hand back, dragging Dean forward towards the throne. Dean came to a halt a couple of feet in front of The Shadow's throne, then as The Shadow clenched their fist, Dean dropped to his knees, screaming in pain.
this worked, Cas would be back with him. And now here he was, walking through The Empty with a tattered sleeve covered with dried blood as his guide. Even so, it still felt like he was walking blind.
He lent over Dean, carefully rolled him onto his back and looked at his face. He was pale and his lips were an unhealthy shade of blue. A tear trickled down Cas's cheek as he checked for a pulse. There wasn't one. He was too late. More tears fell as he sat there, looking at the body of the one he loved.
The two lay in front of them - An angel and a human, each with an arm reaching out and their fingers barely touching.
Cas looked up to see Dean lying on the ground, unconscious. He couldn't tell if Dean was still breathing. If he was even still alive.
Dean repeated his efforts to try and wake Cas and spent what felt like hours trying everything he could think of to wake the angel. Eventually frustration took over and Dean shook Cas as hard as he could while yelling his name. When that didn't work, Dean lay Cas carefully back down and felt defeated. He hung his head and a single tear rolled down his cheek.
He looked at Cas's peacefully sleeping form and pleaded. "Cas, please. You've got to wake up. I'm not leaving you here."
"Guess again. But I know who you are, you're the famous Dean Winchester!" The Shadow smirked at Dean.
be keeping his deal" they thought to themself. "And as long as the human is sleeping, it can stay too."
He felt like he had been walking forever but for no time at all. There was no way to track time in here, as he couldn't see how far he'd come, but all Dean knew was time didn't feel right here. As he walked, he wondered how much time had passed back at the Bunker. Sam had Eileen there to keep him company, but what if weeks passed? Or even months? Dean regretted not having a discussion about time before leaving.
"...Dean?" Cas had replied groggily as he opened his eyes to see Dean kneeling beside him and lit up by a soft glow.
"ENOUGH!" The Shadow snapped as they got to their feet. They pointed a finger at Dean and drew an imaginary line downwards. Dean held back a flinch, waiting to be hit with some sort of pain, but nothing happened.
"Cas…" He heard Dean's prayer. It sounded so desperate. Cas slowly opened his eyes and moved his head slightly to look towards his outstretched arm. There was a hand barely touching his. He knew that hand.
"You sacrificed so much and yet you still failed. And that one task that Heaven gave you, you know the one about saving Winchester? You just failed to complete it." The Shadow slowly walked around Cas while speaking "You've really got nothing now. No home, no family, and no friends. So how about you take a nap now? You know, curl up and sleep? No one is going to miss you."
After a while, the tears stopped coming and Dean lay down, with his head on Cas's chest, whispering his name, begging him to wake up.
He paused for a moment and looked at the sleeping angel in front of him. More tears started to break free
He looked around the darkness that surrounded him. He wasn't sure what he expected to see, but the darkness was unsettling. Even when he shone a flashlight, there was nothing for the light to hit and the beam of light just faded into the darkness. Dean switched the flashlight off and tucked it into his jacket pocket.
"Castiel. Wake up...Please." The voice cracked with emotion, with despair. But it didn't come from the lifeless body in front of him. It came like a prayer, echoing through his mind.
Cas's eyes snapped open. Regrets? What had Ruby told him? Those sleeping in The Empty dream of regrets.
"Dean, don't listen to them" The Shadow clenched their fist again, and Cas screamed in pain. "Feathers over there has done so much for you. He gave up his family for you. His entire life's purpose for you. And yet you can't even help him when he needs you."
"This must be one of The Shadow's tricks" Cas thought to himself, as he moved to lay on the ground beside the body. He couldn't bring himself to leave Dean, not even now. "Maybe I'm going to be tormented by having to listen to Dean pleading."
Dean and Cas turned to their heads to see the new arrival, who was draped across a throne some 15 feet away.
He looked down at the cloth in his hand and noticed a subtle blue glow to it. He turned slowly while holding it to try and figure out how it would guide him. As he turned left, he noticed it start to brighten and then dull again - He turned back to where it was at its brightest and started walking in that direction.
about this. He swallows down the anxiety building in his throat and says, “So, uh, how’s the whole human senses thing? Live up to the hype?”
“Yeah, man! If you thought fries were good, that’s small potatoes.” Dean finds great joy in the frown that pulls at Cas’s mouth at his incredibly good use of wordplay. “Pie, for one. Apple, specifically and—hey, you got wings! You fly to Mama Janie's Diner in Waverly, Kansas and—“
“Sam, why did you ask me to build this?” Cas asks after a time. He looks over at Sam to gauge a response, but Sam’s face remains impassive as he picks at the label on his bottle.
Cas moved Thomas from the bathroom to his bedroom the previous night. The kitten very suddenly came down with what can only be described as separation anxiety, the symptoms of which included yowling all through the night when left alone. Cas is secretly grateful because sitting on the hard tile of the bathroom had been hurting his back more than he thought was reasonable. Thomas took to his new living quarters right away, locating the cushy desk chair and claiming it as a prime napping spot.
First off, thanks to Alex for reading through this and making it make sense. Truly hashtag blessed to have you willing to read through this monstrosity.
He claws his way to the surface of his fever dreams and turns over to look at the alarm clock on the bedside table; fifteen hours have passed. Yet he’s somehow even more tired than before, which he didn’t think was possible, but the grogginess sits heavy on his eyelids begging him to sink back under. But even in his sorry state, he’s retained some standard of care and it’s been far too long since he last showered.
“I was wondering if you could help me with something,” Sam says. His face is open and pleading, a look that typically would’ve moved Cas into desperate action before, doing everything in his power to assist. Now his reaction is sluggish and slightly annoyed at the intrusion.
Dean glances up from where he’s on his knees, holding an empty bowl as Miracle frantically cleans up the mess he made.
When he finally makes his way back over to the gazebo, he takes the last few steps in slow surprise. Sam has affixed the heavy canvas roof covering and strung up lights around the perimeter of the area, little globes of ambiance that give the scene a dichotomic warmth. Sam stretches out to grab the other camping chair and with a swift snap opens it and sets it down next to his. He reaches out to hand Cas one of two beers he’s opened, and Cas steps over to take it.
But Cas’s nose crinkles and he laughs and it’s the most gratifying, captivating noise Dean’s ever heard. Dean laughs too, although a little self-deprecatingly.
It takes far too long for Cas’s eyes to adjust to the light. Even with the sun setting behind him, it’s been an embarrassingly long time since he’s seen proper daylight. He knows the bunker has artificial sunlight, but it becomes clear to Cas right away that it’s a poor substitute for the real thing. The cool weather is the first thing that’s made Cas feel awake in a long time, too, his mind finally dragging itself into something burgeoning on clarity. Cas takes a deep breath in and exhales, his breath fogging in the air.
"Hmmm." The Shadow looked thoughtful for a moment. "Well then, Castiel stays, and I kill you." The Shadow grinned "You go to Heaven or Hell, I don't really care, and I get to sleep."
Every so often, Dean stopped, held the tattered sleeve and pointed it in different directions to make sure he was going the right way. As time went on, he found he had to make small direction changes more often - He must be getting closer.
Dean clutched tightly at the glowing piece of cloth in his hands - He could have cried with joy (and may have quietly shed a tear or two in private) when Sam had finally found a spell that not only found a way to get into The Empty, but could also act as a guide. It was hard to cut Cas's bloody handprint off his jacket, Dean's hands were shaking as he did. It was the one thing he had left. And his one reminder of what he had lost. But, as he cut the fabric, he told himself it would be worth it because if, no,
"You two are the most disobedient, annoying beings I have ever met. If I could, I'd spend eternity tormenting you. But you both are too loud. However, one last thing before I rid myself of you." An evil grin crept across The Shadow's face, and they looked at Cas "This human will hurt you in ways I could never dream of. You'll wish you were back here. Don't forget that."
He sped his walking up, trying not to get his hopes up, but eventually broke into a run as he approached the light that lay ahead of him. He could see a figure laying on the ground, softly glowing, and he could recognize that trench coat anywhere. It was Cas.
Cas scrambled over to Dean and reached out to touch his hand holding the cloth. The hand was ice cold.
The Shadow let out a dramatic sigh. "Yes, but for how long? How long until he comes back to wake you up? Or something else wakes you? Why couldn't you just be a good boy and Let. Me. Sleep?"
Eventually, Dean broke the silence. "Why did The Shadow send us here? I thought surely it was pissed off enough to send us to Alaska. Or to that brewery that put blueberries on pizza."
"I...I should have told you before...years ago. I tried to ignore it. But it wasn't until you said….you told me you loved me...that I realised." Dean let out a sob and the tears fell freely now. "Since that moment, I've…I've regretted not telling you." Dean wiped his eyes on his sleeve
He stopped again to check his course, when something caught his eye in the distance. Dean squinted into the darkness, trying to work out if his eyes were playing tricks on him or was that really a faint light in the distance? He checked the direction against the glow of the sleeve - it was the right way.
Dean skidded to a halt beside Cas, who was laying on his back with his eyes shut, and dropped to his knees.
Dean reached out his hand to grab his shoulder and shake the angel awake. But Cas didn't wake, there was no response at all.
The Shadow walked back to their throne, laughing, as they forced Cas to relive some of his most painful memories, until he eventually gave in, passing out with an arm reaching towards Dean, just short of being able to grab his hand.
Cas quickly scrambled over to where Dean was lying and put his fingers against Dean's neck to check for a pulse. Dean's skin was warm, and he felt a steady pulse. Cas could have cried with joy right there, but he couldn't, not until Dean was safe. He briefly pondered the best way to wake Dean and carefully rolled Dean onto his back and placed the glowing cloth on Dean's chest for a source of light. Surprisingly, rolling Dean didn't wake him. Cas placed a hand on Dean's shoulder and shook him. Dean started to wake up, and went to make a noise, but Cas quickly put his hand over Dean's mouth. Dean's eyes opened wide in surprise at this move and he started to fight off Cas, until he recognized the face staring at him. Cas lent forward and whispered in Dean's ear "We need to be quiet."
"I'm sorry I couldn't save you Dean. I'm sorry." He let the tears flow freely as he grieved for his dead friend.  His dead love.
The Shadow smirked as they surveyed the scene in front of them. The Shadow had felt the moment the angel had awoken and had soon seen that he returned to his slumber, along with the intruder. They had also made sure they were punished for waking The Shadow and causing such pain, leaving them trapped in dreams of failed rescue attempts.
Cas frowned at the reply. "For a hunt? Because we both know my grace isn't as strong as it was, and my abilities are limited."
Dean nodded and Cas removed his hand from where it covered his mouth, then helped Dean into a sitting position. A voice sounded from behind Cas.
Cas was about to ask why a tracking spell was needed but as soon as he looked past Dean he remembered where he,
Cas smiled brightly at Dean, cupped Dean's cheek with his hand and carefully wiped away the tear. "Of course. I'll stay as long as you'll have me."
"And look, Castiel is looking to sacrifice himself again for you. Always the protector, never the protected, isn't that, right? Nice try, but there's no protecting him this time."
Dean tried again, a bit louder and with more force "Cas, come on buddy, wake up!" He shook him again, grabbing him with both hands this time. But nothing. Dean let out a little laugh, trying not to let the worry set in "Who knew you were such a sound sleeper?"
Dean gripped Cas's trench coat by the lapels, intending to try and wake him again, but his grip loosened and he leaned forward to sob into Cas's chest, feeling utterly hopeless.
Cas rushed forward to try and help Dean, to save him, but he soon found himself falling forward to his knees, overcome with pain. After what seemed like an eternity, The Shadow unclenched their fist and the pain stopped. Dean was on his hands and knees, head against the ground, breathing heavily, while Cas had managed to stay in a kneeling position, hand grabbing at his chest.
Dean stood tall, not reacting to The Shadow's threat. "Being dead won't stop me praying to him, and that'll wake him up. And maybe I'll pray to a few other angels too, really get a party going in here." Dean turned to look at Cas and grinned "What do you think Cas? Wake up a few of you brothers?" Dean looked back at The Shadow, still grinning.
Castiel woke up. He could tell he was lying prone on the ground, with his left arm stretched out, as though he had fallen unconscious while reaching for something. He focused on his surroundings - It didn't feel like he was outside and there was no noise at all. But it also didn't feel like he was inside. From behind his closed eyelids, he could tell it was dark out, but there was a small light source nearby. Maybe a flashlight? Was he on a hunt?
