“Uh,” Dean says, because he isn’t really sure how to recover from the shape of Cas’s mouth around the word
“Kay.” Sam leaves him, and Dean eyes the paper, innocuous. He goes over to the desk and unfolds it, and balks at the dense handwriting covering the entire inside page and, when he turns the paper around, the bottom half of the back too, opposite to where Dean’s written PARENTING AUDIT. Sam’s crossed out the lines GOOD STUFF and BAD STUFF, and crowded all the rest of it in with his neat cursive.
“I’ll leave you to it, then,” Cas says. Dean doesn’t say,
“Not much reason for it, ‘less you wanna get back to that dead kid,” says Dean. “Do we wanna get back to that dead kid?”
“Coulda told you that myself.” Cas tilts the pan to slide the egg onto his plate. Sam wonders where he learned to do that. “You comin’ back today?”
“You won’t.” Donnie shakes his head. “God damn, Dean, I’m— I don’t know, hell, I’m sorry you had to deal with this while I was out getting— goddamn ice.”
“How’d—” Dean swallows. “How did he
“But I’d. I’d like to grow old with you.” He pauses, and says — and it ain’t the first time now, far from it, but every time it hits him in the solar plexus, “I love you.”
“What do I do?” Dean asks him, ‘cause he’s got no clue anymore. All he knows is the undertow that pulled him in when Cas left, and the way his grief coughed him up when he came back.
“Thanks.”
“Please try to understand,” Cas says. “I spent a lot of time with him before he was born.”
“Seriously,” Claire adds. “You give us a call, we’re there.”
“Anything,” Cas says, and he raises his arms to let Dean pull his shirt off, and he— he isn’t wearing anything under it so it’s just him, his skin, the hair over his chest. Shit.
“Holy shit.” Frat Bro #3 runs a hand through his hair. “I mean— shit, I’m glad nobody got hurt.” He whips his head up. “No one got hurt, right?”
“Shit,” Dean gasps. Nothing will bring Cas back. Cas is more dead than dead— atomized, probably, no spirit left to wake in the Empty.
Dean chokes on his beer. Cas is
“Do you… want more tea?”
“Weirdly enough, you too,” Dean says. “I know we only got, what, five minutes on the clock, but… how’re you doin’? You’re all right, after everything?”
“Just out.” Dean’s voice is tinny and muffled, something in the distance like he’s outside next to a highway. If he actually went out and got himself wasted in a ditch Sam’s gonna kill him. “Jesus, I’m too old to sleep in the car.”
A few months ago — well, twelve weeks and two days ago, to put it plain — they got Cas outta the Empty.
Sam startles, and then picks up the sheet gingerly, as if it’ll bite him. “Uh.”
pronouns? “Huh?”
So Dean gets in the car, and stares out past the windshield. He is completely empty. There isn’t a thing inside him. He’s nothing. Null and void.
Dean turns around and sees Claire coming out of the bar. “Claire’s comin’ back, I gotta go.”
. That’s all Dean can think. He hunches over to peer at the tattoo through the clear plastic wrap. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. And the second word Dean thinks about it is:
“Okay, okay, wait a sec, just— Cas—” Sam shoves Cas against a wall, just to get him to stop fucking
Dean slumps back in his chair, stunned. He looks at Sam. His brother. His baby brother. He raised him, raised him up good and right, more of both than Dean ever was.
Last week. One week ago, he’d told Sam to tell him it was okay, and— and Cas showed up, out of the blue, and he’d said
Arguing with a brick wall. If he’s so ready to leave, then let him. “Fine.” Dean doesn’t realize how loud he’s talking until Sam flinches out of the corner of his eye. Fuck.
Sam was the one who jumped into the Cage. He understands. He knows exactly what Cas is feeling right now. “Okay,” he says, but he says — because no one said it to him, when he jumped, when he put evil after evil inside of his body and let it turn him inside out — he says, “Come back, though. You’re not a burden to us. Come home when you’re done.”
, he asks,” Dean laughs, curling into Cas’s knees, uncaring about the various liquids all over his chest. “Cas.” He reaches up and Cas meets him halfway, lets Dean pull him down so Dean can kiss the corner of Cas’s mouth lazily. “It was fuckin’ awesome.”
“Reacting when people, y’know. Say stuff.” Dean shrugs and hopes to God Sam doesn’t make him actually say the words
Dean scrambles for the hallway, half-jogging to the kitchen. Not that that’d make a difference if he fucked it up so bad Cas left, if he— if he— Dean pauses, tries to breathe, can’t. He’s the worst piece of shit in the world. Cas left. After all that, all the things Cas said, after Cas said
Dean doesn’t know how to reply. He doesn’t know how to walk it back; how to say, all right, yes, I lied. I wasn’t makin’ it easy on you. I was makin’ it easy on me. Dean doesn’t know how to say that he wanted— because, fuck, he
Christ. “Yeah,” Dean breathes, and lets Cas press his shoulders back, step into him like he’s a great unstoppable force and Dean is more than movable. He’s flexible. He’s
“You all right?” Dean asks, eyes on Cas as he goes under and stays under. He’s moving, at least, so evidently he can breathe, or he doesn't need to breathe, or whatever. Sam doesn’t understand the boundaries of Cas’s power, but unlike Dean, he can accept when things aren’t for him to know. Or maybe their divergence only happens around Cas. Around Cas’s friendship, and whatever it is that isn’t friendship for Dean.
Dean closes his eyes, and tells himself it’s okay if he holds on just a little longer.
“Like Dad?” Dean asks, and then he laughs. She hates the way he laughs. She hates everything about what’s happened to him, but she loves him. When she can see her baby in him, she loves him so much. “S’funny,” he says, chuckling quietly, “Dad always— always said I looked like you.”
“No, wait— wait a second, Dean.” So Dean waits, as Mia figures out what to say. She says, cautiously, “It seems like you might want to talk about this with someone who isn’t involved in the situation. I’m happy to be that person for you now.”
“Sorry, what?” Cas says. “I can’t hear you.”
Dean kisses him for that, and then kisses his chin. And then he— he kisses the underside of Cas’s jaw, feels him shiver under him, wriggles one hand between Cas’s body and the bed so his hands can meet at his back. “I want you for you,” he says, holding him. “That shit I was sayin’ about your grace— I’m sorry. I’m sorry, man. That was my worry. I’m tellin’ you now— I don’t care if you’re useful. I don’t want you useful. I want you here. You understand me?” Dean pulls back to look Cas in the eyes. “All I want is to have you here.”
“You got your angel blade,” Dean says, mouth dry. He swallows, and his throat clicks. “Don’t gotta worry about crap like— like this.” Human crap, he thinks. Winchester crap. Once, it hit him that in that other world, the one Zachariah tossed him and Sam into, they were still named after guns. Smith and Wesson.
“Cas is coming back,” Sam says quietly, and Dean looks away. “I’m saying— I’m saying it, it doesn’t have to be all on our shoulders. What about Jody and the girls up in Sioux Falls, huh? They can handle stuff like this.”
There’s a long pause. Dean can’t look at him. The only reason he even knows Sam is still in the room is because he’s trapped under Dean’s legs, and Dean’s not thinking about it any more than that.
“Yeah.”
. The thing is just. Well. Dean doesn’t go there.
He stands there, waiting, as Cas’s hand slides up, slowly, deliberately. His fingertips reach the neckline of Dean’s shirt, brush against the skin of his throat. Oh, God. Dean holds his breath as Cas’s palm moves to cover his carotid, as his fingers curl around the back of Dean’s neck, as his thumb presses gentle below Dean’s Adam’s apple.
“It kills assholes,” Dean says, squatting in the middle of a dust field next door to a rundown church because he didn’t want to get his tires dirty by driving all the way in, and he’s tired of standing, although his knees are probably gonna regret it soon. Cas and Sam look down at him, and he grins. “I’m an asshole. Maybe if I just sit here and yell a bit, it’ll come.”
“I should.” Sam frowns. “There’s— there’s nothing stopping me. There aren’t any rules. Who the hell’s gonna— man, I
Sam blinks. Frankly, he thought she wouldn’t notice. “Uh.” He has no idea how to handle this. “They’re friends?”
“She’s the one I called a few weeks ago,” Dean admits. “It ain’t for me.” It probably could be, if he gave it another shot, but he can’t fucking think about therapy right now or he’ll blow. A shrink to tell him all the ways he’s fucked up, yeah, he already knows. He knows.
“It’s cooked!” Cas eyes him from where he’s hunched over, burger already halfway to his mouth.
Dean drops his head, heavy and just— just finished. Done. “Yeah, hah,” he huffs out. As if the not-knowing was the easiest part of being a kid.
“Interesting.” Sam’s mouth twists as he thinks, and Dean just keeps his hand on Cas’s back, it hitting him all over again that Cas — Cas who commanded legions, who raised Dean from the pit — might’ve choked himself to death on monster-dust. “Did it say anything about your resurrection?”
Donnie crouches down next to him, hand on Dean’s back, as warm as Dad’s gun is cold. “Jesus Christ, Dean, yeah, I don’t want you to die either. You don’t deserve that.”
He jumps when someone knocks on the door. Fuck. Dean scrubs a hand over his face, tries to breathe in, can’t really hold it past the catch when he thinks too hard about—
When Dean looks at Jack, he sees Sam. He sees in him Sam’s curious eyes, his writer’s hands — hands made for making new things, not for killing, the way Dean’s are.
The only sound is their breathing. It’s so— quiet. Just the two of them, under their blankets.
Cas likes it when the sun gets low, turns the sky pink. He’ll spend hours out there, sitting and watching as the wind blows spirits into the tall grass and the clouds turn yellow and purple and then blue, and then when nighttime comes, Cas tilts his head back and looks at the stars.
I fucked this one up because I lied to Cas. I told him from the get go that I was in love with him when I thought I wasn’t. And then I ended up figuring out that actually I was. Unreal.
“What were you like as kids?”
. He doesn’t even normally shave, but this, being on display, it feels like something you should prepare for. “How do you want me?”
Dean swallows. He looks at the pastor, with their robe and their hair, and he wonders, how did they do it? How can they stand there like that, as if— as if— how could they put both parts of themselves in one body? He asks, eyes on the computer screen, “For me?”
Sam smiles. “Glad you approve,” he says to Jess, wherever she is.
Cas, for once, is the one to look away first. “Please just go,” he says to the wind, and Dean can’t listen to him. “Please. Just leave.”
“You think I’m just gonna let this slide?” The guy’s holding his gun with two hands. His arms are shaking. “You can’t just— I should call the fucking cops.”
who I am.” Dean exhales. Christ. It’s not even fucking true.
Another five minutes. The sun boils down on cornfed country, the road getting flatter and flatter the further he goes.
“That was— too much,” Cas says, stilted, and he stands up. “But to your question. I don’t really pray.”
things— he’s just so
. “Is that— would you—”
It’s been almost three hours since Dean texted him
“He left.” Dean presses his thumb into his forehead. He feels… he feels so fucking stupid. Cas in the bunker,
“What,” Dean breathes, as the pastor says
“No worries.”
Dean thinks of all those mirrors, thinks of killing his black-eyed self and seeing Cas’s bloodied face in that hotel room mirror and remembers, vaguely, exploring the structure of his cheekbones when he’d lost his memories. Every time — every time was just as bad as the other. “You know how many times I put— the number of bars I went to, rolled my sleeves up so girls would see my forearms? You know how many times I’ve done that?”
Sam swallows. “Yeah. ‘Course, Bobby.”
Finally, his eyes focus enough to see Cas’s face, crinkly with a smile. “Good?”
“All those kids think I’m a menace,” Dean laughs, pulling back to look Cas in the eyes. He can laugh about it, ‘cause all he means by
overtaking cookbooks in the kitchen and
“Hey,” he says quietly, once he gets himself set up, propped up on the hood of the car. He won’t drink — doesn’t trust himself not to overdo it, and he’s driven so far that the route home won’t be easy and mindless.
Dean thinks of Cas in his bed last night. “Well, jeez, I sure hope not—”
“I know.” Cas puts a warm hand on his shoulder. “All I want is— for you to grow into the fullness of yourself. For you to be happy.”
“It means something when I have a twenty-two year old feeling unsafe at her workplace because a customer doesn’t know the difference between yes and no,” Donnie chimes in, and takes the phone out of Dean’s hand. “I’m gonna break this, because it disgusts me. I suggest you figure it out.”
“Stanford?” She’d heard, vaguely, that Sam studied pre-law, but didn’t realize it was at a big college like that. “Holy crap.”
“If I made you again,” Cas murmurs, “Would you like it if I put my hands here?” And Cas pushes himself up a little bit and puts his other hand to Dean’s chest, so he’s pinning him there, left hand over Dean’s right hip and right hand over Dean’s heart. Looking down at him from a distance of a foot, maybe, but the leap of earth to heaven for all Dean can move right now, Cas says, “You’d know, if you could see the mark of my hands, that I wouldn’t leave you.”
“I can guess,” Dean says, because his voice is wrecked. And normally around now he’d be asking for Cas’s dick as impolitely as he can manage, but something about this — about Cas, and about thanking him for hitting him — makes him more willing to see where Cas is going. He spreads his legs, and Cas presses in further, and it’s— Dean’s breath catches abruptly.
But the truth of it is that it’s a lie. It’s a bald-faced lie, it’s Dean trying so fucking hard to keep Cas here that he’ll lie to his face about this, the most important thing in Cas’s life. It’s— it’s disgusting. Dean says, mouth dry, hating himself, “Cas, if you— if you want me— I’m yours.”
Dean hangs up, and looks at the phone in his hands.
Trust. A loaded word, for the two of them, but Castiel hopes that Dean can at least trust him with himself.
. Dean slides his hands all over him, close, close, puts his mouth on Cas’s collarbone ‘cause he can’t stop himself. “Lemme— lemme.” Dean puts his hand on Cas’s ass, biting short and shallow against the pulse in his throat, and uses his grip to lever Cas towards the bed.
“Ha.” Dean shakes his head. “No. Fuck. Fuck.
He thinks about texting Claire for help, and doesn’t do it ‘cause he’s not an asshole and twenty-four year olds shouldn’t have to gay Yoda for the forty-two year old men who get their dads killed. And anyway, it isn’t really— after all the things he’s seen, it shouldn’t be a big deal. After the number of times he found himself waking up in a bed with three other men during that summer with Crowley, and the way Benny had touched him, early in those Purgatory days— he shoulda
Dean opens his eyes, doesn’t even want to imagine what kind of expression is on his face as he looks at Cas. Their eyes lock, and Dean can’t get enough of it, Cas’s brow furrowed as he watches Dean’s face for clues, as he presses into him and Dean’s chin tips up and his breath hitches and his eyes stay right on Cas, all through it. “It’s amazing,” Cas murmurs, pressing two fingers into him, not quite dry and not wet either, not anymore, just rough enough for Dean to feel it at that, their single point of contact. “You almost look— surprised, by how good it feels. It’s the most beautiful thing in the world.”
“Shit,” Dean gasps, once Cas lets him up for air. As the endorphins hit him, he says, “Yeah. You too.”
Dean nods. He huffs out a laugh. “S’nice, you can think that way,” he says. “That you can be in the life without— without it bein’ everything.”
“Jesus fuck,” Dean hisses, collapsing on the ground next to Cas, clutches his hand tight. Who cares what Sam sees. He holds his hand there and looks at him, thinks that actually, he won’t survive the next time this happens. He won’t even have to go out and do it himself — the grief will just kill him right on the spot.
hi friends! i feel very terrible about leaving this fic to rot for so long- please accept this extra long, meandering, plotless chapter which is almost entirely about dean's abandonment issues as penance.
“Wasn’t too much,” Dean says, even though his brain is fully experiencing a blue screen of death. “It’s— interesting, s’great— I mean— it’s— good for you, man,” he finally settles on, feeling stupider and stupider the longer he keeps his mouth open.
“Dean—”
. “C’mere,” Dean mumbles, trying to pull Cas closer, somehow, thinking
He’s fucking serious. Good God. Dean, mouth dry, says, “Oh. Okay.” Does he
“Well, it’s just—” And then Dean finds himself wanting to lay the whole sorry story out. He says, “He came back. And, I didn’t want— we’re lucky, to have so many chances. And the things he said, ‘fore he died, I just.” He doesn’t know how else to say it. He says, “I just wanted him to stay. But then it got— saying it, it got to be too much, I didn’t wanna keep—
“Anything, babe—”
He thinks about what Cas said to him probably every single day. He could recite Cas’s speech by heart. He remembers, so distinctly, the way Cas had said
“Undoubtedly.” Cas kisses Dean’s knuckles, and then pushes him off and stands up. He’s got that look in his eyes, that twinkle, when he asks, “How was work?”
“Sucks,” Dean grumbles, because Cas is always right. Asshole. He presses his mouth against the shirt under his face — not a kiss, not really, but it could be, if you wanted to read it that way. Dean just does it. Just instinct in him, close quarters, and Cas’s smell, the warmth of him in his room.
“Really,” Dean murmurs. It should be a question, but it comes out like a sigh, like punctuation. Like a dream. He closes his eyes, and puts his head back against the cushion. “You really think that would be okay.”
“My body, I mean, d’you— was it.” Was it right? It can’t be right, or maybe it’s Dean’s soul that’s wrong, ill-fitted to his body. He was never more in tune with himself than when Alastair was curled up behind him inside his hands and his ribcage hissing
when he sees it. He comes home the next day with a pair of emerald studs in the shape of small hearts,
“All right,” Dean says, because no matter what he feels about it, he ain’t dying anymore, not anytime soon. And Sam settles, and Cas leans back. Dean thinks, suddenly, of Bobby and coming across that ruined scrapyard and yelling into his voicemail
But Cas, above all else, gives as good as he gets. Dean watches the curve of his mouth as he snipes, “What, Dean? Do you want me to say that I love you? Is that what you want from me?”
“M’fine,” Dean grits out, sniffling. “Sup?”
The two of them lie there for a moment, until the sweat gets too cold for Dean to tolerate being extremely goddamn naked. Dean blows out a breath. Good
Cas looks like a dream. That’s what Dean thinks — that Cas looks unreal, like something out of his imagination. He picks his way across the field in his practical boots and his comfortable sweatpants and his shirt busting at the seams ‘cause he still steals Dean’s clothes even though Dean’s about half the size he is, maybe ‘cause it makes Dean’s breath catch in his throat when he does. Dean wouldn’t know. Cas makes his way to a tree: a cottonwood sprouting up out of the empty grass, greener than all the rest of it. He stands and looks at it, and some bird — Dean wouldn’t know, he lives in a fucking bunker — cries out sharp and sweet, and the sun comes out from behind the leaves, rising in the east over the creek. Dean shoves his hands in his pockets and feels incredibly human.
There’s two things in his hands: a pair of sweatpants, and a matching tank top. “You’ve never worn them, so maybe you won’t have an idea of what you look like in them. You’ll just be comfortable.”
The last two worlds were weird, and Sam ditched them as quickly as he could — there was one where they were all coffee shop employees and for some reason Zachariah was their grumpy yet semi-likeable boss, and another one where Sam went darkside with Azazel ten years ago and led the demon army to rise against the human world. Sam’s not sure which one was worse.
I stand by what I said last time — step number one is apologies. I bet you don’t even remember this, but I always think about this one time you said sorry to me. I came home after a fucked up day at school and you snapped at me (you probably had a fucked up day too, come to think of it) and I just couldn’t take it. I just shoved my headphones on and felt real shitty about myself. But then ten minutes later you tapped me on the shoulder and you said sorry and you gave me a Twizzler. Dad never said sorry to me once in his life. You probably can’t even imagine what a difference that made to me. Or maybe you can.
No one else knows. Dean probably knows at least a little of it, since he does their laundry, but Sam hasn’t— Dean’s never brought it up, so Sam hasn’t either. She likes having things that belong to her.
“Ha. If he ever sticks around long enough to have a conversation, maybe I’ll ask him.”
He thinks about the last time he saw Mia. His rage, how dangerous he was. The way Jack flinched away from him like it was instinct. “Last time,” he says carefully, “you saw me when I was in a. A bad place.”
“Okay,” Dean says, and releases him. He takes a step back, and breathes out. “Okay.”
mean, anyway, to an angel?
Sam calls it a night after Under the Red Hood, but Cas sticks it out for the next movie in their DCAU marathon. Dean watches Darkseid whale on Superman and can’t stop fucking thinking about it, the heat of Cas’s body next to his on the couch, and Cas calling himself a gay man, and Sam looking up prayers for queer love, and Alistair calling Dean
“It’s science,” Dean says, hopping up to sit on the table. “It’s, like, a survey or whatever.”
“I found this only a few weeks ago. This is the only gravesite I’ve found,” Cas says. He blows out a breath. “I don’t know why I come here. I can’t— it’s strange to remember a time when Hephael was close to me. When we were one. Hephael would have destroyed me for what I am today, although I… I’m glad of where I am, now.”
“Call the cops on the guy you’re threatening with a gun, real smart,” Dean says. And then, before Dean has to talk his way out of a fucking hostage situation, the door to that back alley opens. Asshole’s head jerks to look at Donnie coming in and Dean takes the chance, jumps over the bar to smash his nose in and disarm him in one go.
“Start wearin’ crop tops,” Dean jokes, but Sam pauses. Dean says, “Uh.”
To Sam, or rather, to that powered-off TV, he says, “It feels. Like I’m going through the motions, or something.” He exhales. “Fuck, Sam.” He’ll never get it together. Cas deserves someone who can hold his hand at the farmer’s market, who can kiss him in public and write poems for him and pick flowers on a whim and put ‘em in vases, and Dean’s. Dean can never do that for him. It ain’t in him. He still has his father’s fury coiled up too tight inside him, and it’ll never let him go.
. And he reads as it turns to rot.
Dean doesn’t say anything. Fair enough; Sam doesn’t know what he could say.
Dean barks out a laugh, acid in his throat. “Did you— Jesus, man. No. No, s’just.” Just me. It’s just me that’s wrong. “Shit, never mind.” He hates his fucking
Once they get the backyard propane tank all set up, Jody puts a beer in his hand and lets him go to town and he makes ten burgers on autopilot without even questioning it, like a suburban dad robot. Embarrassing.
“That’s unbelievably stupid,” Sam says, right as Cas goes, “Dean, your self-sacrificing tendencies disturb me.”
It takes him a few days to work up to it, but he finds Mia Vallens’ contact info online — she’s wearing the same face in her headshot, at least, which makes it easier. Dean flips his phone in his hands nervously and then mans up and dials the fucking number.
“Nah,” Sam says. “I just— I dunno. Maybe it’s… it’s comforting to think that there’s… something. Maybe just other people. The universe.”
She sits there, sipping her water, waiting for him to look at her again. Finally, eventually, after maybe a minute, maybe two minutes of silence, he looks down at one of the boxes next to the couch and asks, “You want me to set up your TV for you?”
On the drive down to the river, Sam turns the whole mess over in his head. Is it the nephilim — Jack — playing with them? Throwing stupid little side quests at them? Is he curious about dust storms, or is this about the idea of justice? And why the Oklahoma dust bowl?
it. Idiot.
Is every child like this? Dean sinks down to sit on his bed, smoothing out the paper against his knee. He can’t do this to Jack. He can’t put this on Jack. He can’t tear himself apart the way he does for Sam ‘cause he won’t make it through. He’s older now. He doesn’t have the energy for it. And the things he’s done to Sam— he remembers it crystal clear, the way Sam brought him a burger after the Mark. After he wasn’t a demon anymore. He’d chased his brother around the bunker with black eyes and a hammer and when it was done Sam brought him a burger. How did they come back from that?
“Is this what you wanted?” Cas asks, voice low, low as anything, as he pushes Dean up against the door.
Eight months. Good God. Dean pushes his fries to her and tries to breathe through it. Eight months, which means it’s nine months since Cas left him. Since Cas—
. All his clothes are for men. All his clothes were picked, by him, to make him into a man.
So Mary digs around in the kitchenware box to find a pot to boil some water in, because she doesn’t own a kettle and doesn’t have a microwave set up yet.
“Sam.”
What does he— ”Shit,” Dean realizes, stricken, “I don’t. I don’t know.”
“It’s— it’s, it’s a—” Sam huffs out a breath. “S’just part of a service.”
“He’s—” Dean exhales. “You haven’t met him. You don’t know who he is.”
Cas’s hand reaches down, and then Cas thumbs across Dean’s face, starting from the crest of his cheekbone down to his ear. Dean breathes in heavy, inhales as Cas leans down— and Cas presses his thumb against Dean’s lower lip and Dean opens for him, easy, he knows it, and Cas sets the pad of his thumb against Dean’s tongue. “Suck,” Cas tells him, and Dean gasps, shivering all over with it, gets Cas’s thumb wet, hard already from it. “And—” and Cas takes his thumb out of his mouth and Dean follows it, follows him, mouth open and empty. “Shh, shh,” Cas says, and puts two fingers into Dean’s mouth and Dean is— he’s fucking grateful for it. He sucks at Cas’s fingers and imagines— imagines it’s Cas’s dick in him, loves that, loves thinking about Cas over him, covering him, broad and big and filling him up.
“How did you and Cas meet?”
Dean holds his breath for a moment. And then, exhaling, he says, “You… you too.”
“But—” He can’t stop himself. He’s the worst man in the world. “‘Course I love you, Cas.”
Yeah. All right. Dean looks up at the stars. Would it have been better, to zap from one to the next like a bee from flower to flower, without being able to appreciate it? Is it better to know what you’ve lost only after you’ve lost it?
“Why do you say that?”
“Oh, fuck—” and Dean comes like that, shivering, his hands tight on Cas’s hips as he grinds up against him, biting Cas’s lip. “Cas— Cas—”
Sam nods. He says, “Y’know, it’s. I mean. No judgment here, man. Sex is… complicated.”
Dean huffs out a laugh, and relaxes, all the tension coming out of him. Of course he is. “God, you’re so much better at this than I am.”
?” Dean barks. “We got a half-angel menace on the loose, and Mom’s about had it up to here with her deadbeat sons, and Cas—” and Dean looks at him in an old way, the way he looked sometimes when he talked about Dad, about when it was bad. Or, when he talked around it, because Dean has never told Sam about anything that Sam hadn’t seen with his own eyes. He looks very, very scared. “I don’t get you, man.”
Dean grimaces a little, waves, tries not to awkwardly duck his head the way Sam does when he meets someone new. Does it anyway, because his brother’s rubbed off on him like shitty gas station receipt ink.
Mia chuckles. “Yeah, I moved to a new state, but I’m doing all right. I’ve actually been getting quite a few hunter referrals, which is a new set of clientele for me.”
, and Dean’s grin falters. It’s obvious to everyone but him, isn’t it, all the people at the grocery store can see that he’s texting someone he’s— into, or whatever. If someone looked over his shoulder two minutes ago then they’d know it was a man, too, or they’d think so. And that’s fine. It is absolutely, unequivocally fine. So Dean, suddenly wracked with nerves, texts back
Cas comes out of the river before Sam has to reply. As he puts his coat back on, Sam can see small clumps of green behind him, clouding the waves rippling from where Cas stepped out of the water. He puts his wet socks into his shoes, which just proves that the water didn’t have anything to do with Dean telling him to take them off.
“Sam.”
“I don’t wanna be a man,” Dean admits, feeling it curl in his chest. But he is a man. Look at him, his fucking— at least when he was younger it was cute for him to dress up like a girl, coulda been sexy if anyone around was into it, but
He can tell she’s surprised. Professionally, though, she clarifies, “Together… romantically?”
Cas asks, “Would you— would you say it again?”
Good lord. Dean’s been reading too many of the poetry journals Cas subscribes to. He tells Cas they can’t afford to drop two hundred a month on subscriptions — if he wants to spend that much money he might as well sign up for classes at KU and get access to their library system — and Cas always says he “likes the hard copies,” and anyway Dean’s job is “only a supplement” to the credit card fraud. Straight to the heart. But anyway, Cas likes to have stacks of
“Jesus. I’m sorry,” Dean murmurs. “That wasn’t— you were askin’ a nice question. It just reminded me of what I said, back then.”
Dean cants his eyes left. Like always, his gaze catches on all the parts of him, on Cas’s jawline, his inevitable stubble, that quietly noble profile of his. He swallows.
nothing, you said,” and Cas smiles, a little, “‘Cas, you son of a bitch. I’m not leaving without you. There’s nothing for me out there, if you’re here. So come back to me.’”
Dean’s mouth twitches up into a smile. “Kept askin’ questions, though. Why didn’t—” Dean inhales. His eyes flit down to the counter for one long moment, and then he looks back at her. “Why’d we always have to move around. Why didn’t we have a mom. Where'd Dad go when he'd take off for days at a time. That kinda stuff.”
“I’m sorry for your loss.” Amy munches a fry philosophically, and Dean tunes back into the real world. Cas is dead, you dumb fuck. All you can do is live. “Do you want to talk about him?”
The way Cas looks at him— it’s too much. He doesn’t deserve that. “I won’t,” he says warmly, and Dean looks away.
Cas shifts back. “What?” His eyebrows draw together in confusion as he takes his hand off the table, puts it in his pocket, goes back to standing upright. “You’re not going to…?”
Dad raises an eyebrow. “This the kinda guy you let within twenty feet of your brother?”
Aw, crap. “No, no, I’m—” He swallows, thinking of Sam’s letter. “I’m sorry,” he says, and it doesn’t even sting much. “And anyway, it’s not— this isn’t your project. You two go out, have fun. I’ll try to find some stuff on dwende. Dwendes?”
Who writes this shit. “A prayer.”
“Every drop of rain,” Dean says, like it’s something nice and not something that’ll always be broken inside him, the way things went with Jack at the end. His kid. And the way he treated him— it was like he didn’t know himself.
. You fuckin’— fuckin’ sap.”
“Nah, shit, never mind,” Dean says, thinking it again:
Last thing: Don’t bring your kid along for your revenge ride. Yeah, obviously you’re not gonna drag Jack across motel rooms for the next twenty years, but Dad’s mission was more than just the constant moving. He put it inside our heads. After he let me in on the mission, I’d wake up thinking Yellow Eyes was watching me all the time — which he probably was, come to think of it, but I don’t think it was because of that. I think I just had the idea of it in me because of how Dad talked about it. Or maybe it was all the same. Maybe that’s why Dad was the way he was, because it was good for Chuck’s story,
until the end of time!”
, “it seems disingenuous to pray when I know there’s no one to pray to.”
, and kissed Cas until he stopped feeling sick in his stomach.
Claire and Jack don’t say anything. He closes his eyes into that silence. Stupid. He is so fucking stupid. “Dean,” Sam says from across the table, chiding, and Dean exhales, nodding. Yeah. He knows.
Cas lets him go. Dean flexes his hand and thinks
“Yeah, sure, all right.” Dean pulls up a chair as Sam unplugs his earphones. There’s some kid on the screen — or, hell, maybe they’re not even that young, but everyone looks young to Dean these days — wearing some kinda robe and standing at a pulpit. Dean would say they’re a picture of Christian devotion except for the fact that half their hair is shaved off and the other half is dyed into a rainbow. “What kinda denomination is this?”
“Yeah,” Dean laughs, chokes, tilts his head back against the wall, closes his eyes ‘cause he can’t face it. He shouldn’t have done it here. It isn’t the dungeon but it looks— it looks too damn much like it. He shouldn’t have done this here. “Yeah, he sure does. Pretty sure that’s half my fuckin’ problem.”
All the air goes out of Dean’s chest. Like he just forgot how to breathe. The only thing Dean knows how to do is look at him. He can’t see him on the ground like this without seeing his wings, without seeing Lucifer’s knife in his back. Six months ago Cas had looked at him and said
Things were easier a decade ago.
He makes sure Sam runs his drills, can take Dad’s M15 apart and put it back together in under two minutes, knows not to carry the Jennings around when it’s loaded. He sets up empty beer cans in overgrown industrial fields four miles from the highway and watches Sam shoot them down. He tells Sam half-made up rumors about other hunter’s kids who died ‘cause they couldn’t reload fast enough, tells Sam about how Dad might let them stay in one place for longer if he thinks they’re safe, tells Sam he can earn stability if he just holds his pistol right.
“You get a lotta people coming out to you?”
Claire nods. She takes a pull of her beer and she’s twenty-four now, and by that age Dean had already grown out of putting back tequila shots like water, but he still looks away from it.
who Sam is. I got no clue what I am.”
“Just, ah.” The pastor finishes,
“Please don’t say that.” Cas wipes his face and walks towards the car.
After it’s over — shifter dead in a shootout in the sewer system, like always — Sam thinks,
Out of the garage, Cas makes a beeline for their room, so Dean steers himself to the Dean Cave, and sits himself in front of the TV, and tries not to think about much of anything at all.
“Shut
‘Cause Dean— all time has proven is that Dean is a man barely hanging onto decency by the skin of his teeth. He hasn’t got it in him. He just hasn’t got it in him to let Cas go.
“Non-binary.”
“You’re my friend.” Cas puts his hand on Dean’s forearm and Dean nods, because yeah, that’s— that’s always gonna be true on his end, no matter how bad they fuck up. “So. I don’t see any loss here.”
to the guy, y’know, he’s—”
And, anyway, none of it’s a lie. She loves him, in whatever strange uncertain way they’ve found to love each other. She loves all of him. “It matters to me, in the sense that you matter to me,” she says carefully. “I want to learn about every part of you. All the important parts.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, and he rubs a hand on Cas’s shoulder. “Yeah, me too.”
“No, no, no, shit, man,” Sam rushes to say, “Cas was— I mean, he’s been out this whole morning. No way he overheard. Sorry, I shouldn’t have brought it up so soon after, I really didn’t hear a word, I just wanted to offer.”
Cas doesn’t say anything else, though, so Dean— Dean risks it. He thumbs slowly across the small dip in Cas’s wrist, feels Cas’s skin prickle under his touch. He slides his hand up Cas’s forearm, reaches his elbow.
Cas nods. He turns to look out the windshield and says, “When you figure it out—”
“Jesus
“Yeah, yeah, I know, s’just.” He shrugs. Looks out into the night. Looks at his car, his home, and thinks — Claire will have four walls on solid legs. Claire will have the high of a good hunt followed by a home cooked meal out of Jody’s kitchen, and when she gets bored of that, she’ll have the research library at the bunker.
“Well, yeah, I—” Good going, Dean, remind the guy about losing his wings. He tries, “I mean. Do you pray?”
“Don’t you have it handled? With your little hunter network?”
He works it out as he talks, no idea what’ll come out of him ‘til it’s out there. “I kept waiting for it to go sideways, an’ I kept thinking— if you—” Oh, God. “If you see what a mess I am, if you figure out that even— even when it isn’t the end of the world— even when we’re not in fight or flight mode I’m still like this, then you’ll.” He swallows. “Then you’ll go.”
as the white glow of his grace sped through all of Dean’s body like a lightning rod. And suddenly, with Cas there in front of him and that trembling resonance in his fingertips, he hadn’t been certain anymore that it was okay at all.
“Y’stopped reading.”
“That’s you?” Dean asks. “It’s really you in there?”
Of course, neither is true. It was Cas’s choice to live in the bunker. And Dean has done better things. Dean raised Sam, after all, and Sam is a better man than either Dean or Cas will be.
“Okay, so after the lugs are hand tight, then you tighten with the lug wrench. You want them snug but do not, I repeat do not reef on it. The car is up on a jack and you don’t need to have it fall off. You’re trying to change a tire, not flatten your hand,” Dean instructs.
Cas comes up beside Dean, staring angrily at the pamphlet on geology, “I don’t understand the name. This place is nothing like the moon. The moon certainly doesn’t have such a rich ecosystem.”
“Dean, we should go to sleep,” Cas murmurs, snuggling into the bed. Dean could point out he’s going to freeze to death overnight but doesn’t. He’ll grab another blanket since sunshine is clearly a blanket hog.
Dad always said Dean had terrible manners. Another thing Dad could never fix.
Dean pats Cas on the shoulder, “He’s your kid, Cas. The rest doesn’t matter.”
Castiel seemed surprised by the offer but accepted. He was in a rush and his bird was becoming more agitated by the moment. Dean was half-afraid the thing was gonna peck his eyes out.
“You’re luvdisc, because you’re loved shaped.” Dean says. He starts to blush. Shit, he wasn’t supposed to be the one blushing.
Cas beams. “I would love to.”
After breakfast, he puts on
Cas insists they drive out to the trailhead below the jetty. He drags Dean down an old road where they can get onto the jetty, clambering over boulders to do so. The waves are a lot bigger up close. He does get an adorable photo of Cas trying to take a selfie as his hair is blown in every which direction. They eat lunch in a quieter area down the road before heading out.
Dean shrugs, “He’s a Milton. He can’t resist mucking things up.”
Dean looked at Cas. His face was unreadable. He finally sighed, gripped Cas’s shoulder tight and gave him a sad smile. “I’m gonna miss you pal. You’ve got a bright future out there.”
“You son of—” Dean barely gets out as he cracks up. He attempts several times to finish his sentence but he keeps laughing. Cas tries to maintain a composed facade as he finishes wrapping the corn in tin foil. Dean eventually gets a hold of himself, enough to flip the burgers.
“We will.” Jack turns towards his snakes, “You four behave for Dad.”
“You’re welcome, Jack. Now, I’ve been delayed. If I’m not home by 6:00 pm, could you get dinner from the freezer? There’s leftover french onion soup and one of Dean’s sourdough loaves on the top shelf,” Cas instructs.
Dean watches as Cas pierces his neck, next to the Adam’s apple. Cas’s breathing becomes heavy but he remains silent. A white glow begins to fill the tube. It’s not half full when Cas drops the extractor. He’s broken out in a sweat. He looks exhausted suddenly.
Dean sticks his tongue out at Sam, “Your loss but I’m being serious.”
Claire agrees, “It would be cool to have Honey and Bee along. They’re such chick magnets.”
Dean lies in their bed. They sleep together. Well, they don’t
“This,” Cas points to the tomato bed, “Will be done soon. This will be for my kale. Don’t make a face Dean. Jack is going to attempt some brussel sprouts. I’m thinking of putting up some plastic over it to extend the growing season as much as we can. I don’t care for store-bought leafy greens.”
“Why would I do such a thing? You’re not a threat,” Castiel says.
“You didn’t want to stop,” Dr. Mills says. “Look at your mark.”
“Lissuin,” Cas repeats. “It’s a type of fragrant flower from…”
“Fine. Fine. I’ll net off the chicken run Cas. Because I’m the best husband around,” Dean smirks.
“Hand it over. You owe me,” Charlie says, trying and failing to pull it from Dean’s hand.
“WHAT?!?” Dean almost chokes.
Dean pushes those thoughts aside. Cas needs him right now.
“God, I love you so much. I want you to fuck me. I’ve need you to fuck me. I will explode if you don’t. Just like Jubilee.”
After helping Jack with his gear, Cas heads back inside. He’s got Dean's weekly Winchester summertime barbecue to prepare for. It will be a reprieve from his week of trying to troubleshoot the batch loading workflow. It seemed to find a new and exciting way not to function every other minute.
“We’re not accredited Dean. You could start tomorrow. We are looking into accreditation options but there’s really no independent body to evaluate us as of right now...”
He’s not quite sure what it means. He doesn't doubt the tulip is for Dean but he’s never had a flower last this long. He bestowed the name after the tulip remained resolute.
Anna hops from Cas’s shoulder onto the dock below. She does her awkward little bird waddle over to the pliers, before grasping the tool in her foot and flapping up to sit on the armrest of Dean’s chair.
Dean gestures at the massive hole in the ground. “Don’t lie to me. I saw Meteor Crater with my own eyeballs.”
“Cas,” he whispers, and he can hear it in his voice, the nerves. “Cas, are you—”
Claire calls him up for a case out in Pennsylvania. “This is Dean,” she says, bluntly, to the gaggle of kids around her at the bar. Or, young adults, Dean figures he oughtta say. Hell, they’re full-on real-ass adults if they’re Claire’s age. Get a grip, Dean.
“Dean,” Cas murmurs, soft and steady, as his hips start rolling down into Dean’s. Oh, fuck. Dean chokes out a half-moan, bites his lip to keep it in ‘cause it’s embarrassing, how good it feels. Or like it oughtta just be between the two of them, and quietly.
Cas smiles, though, a little pleased, quiet and content. “I know Sam wanted to preserve some fresh basil for his spellwork,” Cas says, and Dean thinks,
“Could ask you the same,” Sam says, pulling out two beers from the fridge. “Want one?”
Dean’s mouth twitches. He should give it to Charlie to wipe. He should donate it to one of those places that recycles electronics or whatever the fuck.
he is— like when did he get
“Why, would that work?”
Sam shrugs. “I dunno. Might try to commit to— to learning more about, about witchcraft. Call up Max.”
He looks at the page, his handwriting awkward and cramped. He thinks about high school English teachers asking
“Dad never said he was proud of me,” Dean says, still smiling. “Always had higher expectations’n I could meet, my old man.”
“You got enough leftover grace for that?” Dean asks instead. “Hidin’ anything else up your sleeve?”
isn’t filling the drawers past capacity, fuck, fuck,
“Whatever.” Dean looks up at Mom through the window, waiting for their order. Sam watches him huddle into himself, as if he’s cold. It’s a 65-degree summer night.
He doesn’t know which would be worse. And then he thinks: You are the love of my life, and you’re dead. I can’t look at Jack without seeing you. I can’t even breathe right most days. So it doesn’t fucking matter whether I loved you back or not. You’re the love of my life, and you’re dead.
why,” Dean murmurs, looking at his hands, hands that look more like Dad’s than anyone else’s. Winchester palms made for loading and shooting. “Why I’m so angry all the time, why I’m— Sam, s’just. There’s just so many— it just feels all wrong.” He looks at the TV’s blank screen in front of him, thinking about the last time he was in here with Cas. They’d watched this Eastern bloc black and white flick called
Cas turns towards Dean, reaching out to grip his shoulder. Cas hopes the touch is grounding for Dean. Just as Dean’s touch is for him. “I am truly sorry Dean. I know how much Bobby means to you. I’m always here for you. In any way you need me.”
The entire day has been like this. One disaster after another. He had wanted to polish up his journal article this morning, but a software update had caused the library catalog to cease functioning. There was nothing he could do while IT sorted it out with the vendor. Then a student dumped a bedbug infested book in the book return. After triaging the infestation, the catalog still wasn’t fixed, and the campus awards committee ran an hour late.
Never, in a million years would he dream of ever stepping foot in a place like this. There was absolutely no need.
“I promise Cas.”
And so it goes. Winter changes to spring. Spring changes to summer. Dean spends some days reading. Some days working. Castiel seems to delight in teaching Dean about the house, the gardens, the changing rhythm of life there. He even insists that Dean work desk duty. Dean swears he’s awful with people but Castiel thinks customer service is an appropriate job for Dean.
“Oh, those car lessons came in handy. One of my friends, a human, doesn’t know about the whole son of Satan thing, her car got a flat. Everyone was impressed I could change it without even looking at one youtube video,” Jack informs them.
Dean found out soon after they began sharing a bed that Cas had a limited range in movies. Dean would play his favorites on his laptop and Cas would lean over and watch. Eventually, Dean just placed the laptop between them. Cas hadn’t seen many of the classics. Well, what Dean considered the classics.
Yeah. Big, strong, tough fighter. Excellent comparison.
Dean prepares. Killing an angel requires a weapon touched by the Divine. An angel blade. He’s one short. No matter. He’ll entrap the bastard in holy flames and figure out the rest from there.
Dean lets go of his wrist only to crowd right into Cas’s personal space. “Is it the tenure thing? Is that it?”
Jody smiles warmly at Dean, “We don’t hunt enough to need all that much help but you aren’t dead which is a good sign for a hunter. Too many die young. You can bartend for us, if you want. Wouldn’t hurt to have another pretty face around here.”
Dean had reviewed his options. They could get a mattress topper to put over the cushions. Except where are they going to store it during the day? Dean could ignore the problem, except he can clearly hear it all night. Dean could get an air mattress but he’s back at the space issue again.
“You know about Sam and Eileen?” Dean asks. It sounds too much like an accusation.
Dean channels surfs for a while. Cas us busy reading up on elk.
“I’ve got an idea for your institute,” Dean says, getting to the point of this conversation.
Sam sighs deeply into the phone, “You can’t just leave and not expect –”
Earth Angel is a bit of a drive down the 105. It’s actually across the bay in another small coastal town. South Bend. Better for business Cas tells him. There are a few tourist shops here and there. Earth Angel fits right in.
Cas doesn’t back down, “Is that why you loudly complain about how sweaty you get when we hike for more than a few miles? I wish for us to go backpacking. You require the proper equipment and attire.”
Dean looks pissed. “Ignore my jerk of a brother. I’m thirty-three. I don’t get crushes. Look Cas, I know you’re here to work. I’m sorry I made you uncomfortable. It was just nerves, okay. Let’s just forget this ever happened.”
“Alright. I’ll type up my notes and send you the information. And Dean,” She pauses.
“You sound like your father. He holds a grudge for every time I’ve defeated him in scrabble. He got cocky because he beat me the first few times. You should have seen his face the first time I kicked his ass,” Dean says, grinning at the memory.
Dean almost laughed at the realization. Some angel Castiel was. Cleaning up gas station messes. Shouldn’t he be leading armies or smiting demons?
“Very well. Then marry me.”
Dean cuddles against Cas on the couch as he puts on a documentary dinosaurs Jack has seen a million times but wants to see again. Dean pulls a blanket over the both of them, reaching over to the end table to grab the popcorn bowl.
The Gas-n-Sip is indeed busy tonight, despite it being past midnight. It’s the only gas station and convenience store that’s open twenty-four hours a day for miles.
“Wait, aren’t they already a couple? They do everything together.” Jack wonders.
Dean puts the hat aside, smoothing down Cas’s soft hair. “You do look damn good in that hat Cas. I’m not ready for everything quite yet but we could get to second or third base tonight.”
Once Benny arrives and loads Jubilee up, the three of them pile in Baby. Jack and Dean are still arguing about the smart car when Cas realizes they’ve missed the turn-off towards his townhouse.
He has the physique of a hunter. He’s made for quick bursts of action. Hauling his ass up 2,000 feet in the wrong shoes almost kills him. He cannot see how people do this for fun.
Dean was not subtle about asking questions. It had been a mere week into their budding friendship when Dean spotted the rainbow cufflinks Cas had worn to work that day and asked if he was “gay or something” in an extremely clumsy manner before backpedaling and insisting it was totally cool if he was.
Now, apparently they share nothing.
Cas slides over to Dean, pressing close. He moves to put two fingers to Dean’s temple. Dean flinches away on reflex.
He clears his throats, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Cas gives him a pitying look. “No. You sometimes think very loudly. To answer your question, you have an anti-possession tattoo. Every hunter I have ever encountered had one. You seem fond of poking me with iron. Your brother co-runs the Leahy Institute of Supernatural Learning.”
“Good morning, Dad. Good morning, Dean. I’m ready for the boat tour,” Jack says. The kid is definitely prepared with a pack full of gear.
Castiel tilts his head, “Most of my guests come here to relax Dean.”
“This makes you look like a tax accountant. You do know that right?” Dean had teased as he tightened the half-windsor knot around Cas’s neck.
The camper itself is pretty nice. Little dinette on the right as you walk in. Wet bath on the left. The kitchen has got a sink, three burner stove, microwave, and miniature oven. There’s room for a queen size bed up top. Dean puts in a memory foam mattress. He’s not giving up everything.
The hot summer day has turned into a slightly more bearable evening, the air is muggy, thick with the smell of hickory smoke while Dean angrily rants about meat. It’s perfect.
Dean scoots closer to Cas. He presses a kiss to the crown of his head. “Me too.”
Dean should have a chit chat with Sam. About a lot of things.
Damn cute little guys. Don’t worry about dinner. I’ve got it covered.
Finally the angel lowers his wings, sings something in a language Dean doesn’t recognize, and flies away.
Cas gives Dean a reassuring smile, “Thank you for telling me. I’m honored that you’d feel comfortable telling me. With regards to your question. I have suspected since we first met, given your vested interest in my gender and sexuality.”
“I could get a job. Or go hunting again. Or literally anything else,” Dean gasps out. Maybe losing his grace has affected Castiel’s judgment.
“We can’t get married,” Dean finally says, possibly minutes later.
For a dork who owns a nursery and writes on the side, Cas sure has a natural talent for pool. Dean should have known, the guy’s got a serious competitive streak. He sits at the bar and watches Cas play a few rounds with the kids.
Sam was in pretty bad shape. Turned out his girlfriend had passed away. Car accident. Sam’s heart just wasn’t in it anymore. Dean figured Stanford wasn’t going anywhere. He told Sam to pack up, they were getting out of town. A road trip would at least get Sam out of the house.
Cas joins them in the afternoon, weary of sleeping too long and messy up his sleep schedule.
Cas should leave before he embarrasses himself anymore.
Castiel puts Dean up in one of those. Why he’d give Dean a room, when actual paying guests could have it, is beyond Dean. He gets the impression he shouldn’t question the motives of former wavelengths of celestial intent.
“I know that. I mean, actually strange. Other worldly. There’s the supernatural sure but I didn’t believe all that crap about the mountain until I saw it myself,” Jody says.
” Cas gasps as he climaxes, clenching tightly as his orgasm shutters through him.
“Cas?” Castiel asks, his voice quiet.
“Yes. But no. But also yes,” Dean mutters.
“You’re damn right it is. I’ll see you soon.” Dean says, winking at his fiancé.
“What are you talking about? Don’t answer that. The point is this has the right energy. Cas is liable to jump your bones after seeing you in this,” Charlie says. “You both have terrible taste.”
There’s absolutely no way he’s manifesting twenty years too late. But, if for some reason he is, he’s not too keen on showing Cas. The mark might be liable to do something stupid. Like try and Bond with Cas.
of course. Changing the oil in his soulmate's car. Dean makes a mental note to look up smart car maintenance. Don’t need another car exploding.
Dean doesn’t know what to say. He’s madly in love with Cas but some days he wonders why an angel like Cas would bother with him. Yet, there is no hint of dishonesty in Cas’s words. Dean just needs to have a little faith.
Cas goes, easy for him, and Dean looks at him sprawled there, with his thin sweatpants and his bare toes. Fuck. He goes to his knees ‘cause— ‘cause— ‘cause what else is there to do, when you have someone lookin’ at you like that. “Cas,” Dean whispers, puts his hands on Cas’s knees.
“Fair enough.”
. “I just needed a damn break.”
Dean nods. “Yeah. Sure did.”
Fuck, that’s selfish. But it’s true. I want to be dead before Cas goes and if this universe has anything of its own in it outside of Chuck then that’s coming sooner than not. Fine by me. I’ve been alive two decades too long far as I’m concerned, but Cas hasn’t really lived yet. He doesn’t know what he likes. He doesn’t have a favorite sweater yet. He doesn’t know if he likes karaoke. He doesn’t have a comfort TV show — but I guess the entirety of television is his comfort zone. Still. You gotta give him a chance to figure it out.
Sam waves a piece of paper in the air, so Dean can see it. Christ. He can see his own block handwriting on the front: PARENTING AUDIT. “Aw hell, Sam, you didn’t have to—”
“Developed through extensive market research,” Dean cracks, because if he has to treat this seriously he might lose it entirely.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Okay, FYI, we’re not taking relationship advice from a fifteen year old who picked the name
Cas looks at him, and the way he looks, locking eyes like it’s— like nobody ever taught him the way to do it, like no one ever said Cas, look, man, when you’re having sex with someone for the first time it’s supposed to be awkward and you’re supposed to keep your eyes closed so you don’t see the fumbling around— ‘cause no one taught him that, no one, this is just what Cas is when he’s acting on instinct. He looks into Dean’s eyes and his brow furrows and his thumb dips in, further, and Dean closes his mouth around it and meets his gaze because like hell if he’s going to be the one to teach Cas that what he wants is wrong.
It doesn’t occur to him that he could just follow Cas out.
“Cas,” he croaks out.
“Yeah.” Dean blinks at the neatly-ordered boxes filled with cursed objects in front of him. A good place to air your secrets, in a warded room full of secret-keepers. “And. And a… a friend.”
“You ever miss ‘em?” Dean asks, like a fucking idiot.
Cas shifts beside him. Dean catches it out of the corner of his eye, Cas’s body moving. “Not the way I would miss you or humanity if I had to leave. Maybe I miss it like— the way you’d miss being a child. The ease of it. But it wasn’t really uncomplicated, you just— didn’t know enough to grasp the truth of it.”
“Jesus, Dean.”
And then Cas takes his fingers out of his mouth. Dean
“We don’t know shit,” Dean retorts, because they don’t. Cas could be dead right now. For all Dean knows, this very second Cas is a vessel with burnt-out wings staining the ground behind him and Dean missed whatever pathetic sliver of a chance he had at maybe being a little less lonely than he feels every single goddamn day. Christ. He’s sweating. He shouldn’t have had eight old-fashioneds last night. But hell, they’d just kept coming.
Mom barrels out the door with her enormous bag of takeout, presumably because she must’ve actually ordered seventeen tacos like she swore she would after the fight. “Chimichangas for everybody,” she says, eyes wide at the stars above them. Sam thinks: you’re on your way out already, and you just haven’t figured it out yet.
“No,” Cas says, “I know Naomi’s interference. I wouldn’t be talking here with you if I was under her control.”
He hangs up just as Claire gets to him. “Hey. How’s it going with the witnesses?”
“God, fine. Gimme a pen.” Sam stretches a hand out and Dean hands him a pen. He watches Sam write:
Dean puts Asshole’s thumb on his phone to unlock it. He scrolls through his recent texts, grimacing at the contents of the fraternity group chat. “I’ll call someone from his frat,” Dean says, waving Lindsay off when she tries to help.
, Sam hinting that
But he tries to make up for it. Cas texts him at the grocery store to ask if he can pick up flour, and Dean says
“Shoot.”
. This is frankly humiliating, and besides, if Dean were to engage in spooning, he would definitely be the spooner, not the spoonee. Cas mumbles something behind him, pulls him in closer, and Dean softens.
“God, yeah,” Dean says, rolling onto his back as Cas pushes himself up on his knees, leaning over his face. He watches, mouth falling open as Cas unzips himself, pulls his dick out of his boxers. “Fuck, are you gonna— Cas, are you gonna come on my face—”
Dean shrugs. “Yeah, maybe.”
He thinks about Sam. Sam, writing in his journal, smiling more often than not these days. Eileen switching Dean’s beers out for non-alcoholic ones when he finishes a full six-pack on movie nights and not saying a damn word about it.
“Yeah,” Cas says, but it’s—
“Good,” Amy says, “Nat’s fantastic in the kitchen.”
“How’s your neck?” Dean asks gruffly, tilting his own head back to look up at Cas, because he can’t think of anything to say to
Oh, God. Dean swallows. “Yeah?”
“All right,” Cas says, gentling his grip. He says, smoothly, “Let me— then let me tell you what I want.”
, Sam didn’t get anything from Dean. Sam would be worried, but Dean’s always forgetting to check his phone; hell, the only time he looked at it more than three times a day was when he was waiting on a text from Mom. It’s only been seven, maybe eight hours anyway.
Frat Bro blinks. “Uh.”
Trying to piece together different parts of rituals from different books is leading him nowhere useful. Sam tries to focus, but even he can’t make something out of nothing.
. Maybe he’s entitled, or just getting old, but he’s pretty sure he’s more useful on the bunker computers than killing his knees climbing rusted out manhole ladders.
“That’s good.” Bobby sighs heavily and releases her. “Jeez, that’s good, kid. All the women in my family were the smart ones, y’know.”
He says, to Dean: “As always, I love you.”
“Gender can be occupying,” Castiel says, thinking of Dean’s own wrestling with the large gulf between his body and his soul. “Sam has a lot to say on the topic, I believe.”
“Of course, Dean,” Mia says. “It was nice to hear from you again.”
“Dean.” Dean looks up at Cas again, and Cas grins at him. God. He fucked up. He fucked up. “You can’t— you can’t imagine how happy that makes me feel.”
, sang Don Henley, and Cas had smiled.
“Okay,” Dean says, leaning in, anxious and sick and in love and nervous over it all, nothing perfect or scripted to speak of. Just him, and Cas, and the TV rolling the postproduction team in the background. “Yeah.”
“Dean,” Cas breathes. Dean touches him, feels the weight of him, slides his hands up to his chest — Jesus, he got big. Cas leans in for a kiss and Dean gives it to him, sets his hands clenching and twitching on Cas’s wide and unconquerable shoulders. He can’t think on it too long but that’s okay because there’s nothing to think about, other than Cas’s hips over his, his rough thumb rolling against Dean’s cheekbones.
And then Sam says something groundbreaking, but he says it so gentle, as if that’ll make it any easier. “Have you considered that you… might actually be in love with him?”
“Well,” Mary says, clearing her throat, because she doesn’t want to look that one in the face. She doesn’t want to see it at all. “What about the nephilim? I know we’ve been talking around the idea of them being related, but maybe we should look into it more closely.”
Dean watches him when he does it sometimes. Got him in a panic the first few times, thinking Cas had gone out and hadn’t come home — but there he was, right where Dean left him, head tilted back. It’d been cold out. Dean had shrugged off his flannel and walked up to set it on him like a blanket instead of launching it at him from the doorway, and Cas had turned that wondering face onto him, eyes wide and full of stars. Hadn’t needed to say thank you, but said it anyway. Dean had left him to it.
“Dean,” Cas says, pulling him in, and Dean — Dean
isn’t what they’re really talking about anyway. Dean breathes in shakily. “Well,” he croaks out. “Me, too, y’know.”
“Not stereotypical,” Mia says, but there’s a smile in her voice. “Do you want to elaborate?”
Dean works it out on some dough, and then puts a roast in the slow cooker, and then makes more chili than you could shake a stick at. He bakes macarons and sugar cookies. After a solid three hours in the kitchen, his breathing slows. It’s fine. Cas is allowed to leave. He’s not— Dean’s not that guy. It’s fine.
Dean pats his hand against his side, right over where Castiel knows his gun is hidden in an inside pocket. No gun could stop a nephilim, but Castiel still bristles. “Hunting just means looking,” Dean says, obsequiously. “You never hunted for your keys? Or your phone?” Castiel thinks: You are so beautiful, and so obnoxious.
And Cas says Dean broke the connection. “No,” Dean says, remembering it. He knows it well. He was healed, suddenly, and everything was as clear as it could’ve possibly been. Cas had said
Ha. Oh, fuck. “Pulled me out of a—” and hell, he thinks, Mia knows who he is, what he does. And no one’s gonna tell. He admits, “He pulled me outta Hell.”
, the way he always did, even before that Thanksgiving. Jess liked it, so Sam never put a stop to it.
“Okay,” Dean says, “that’s, uh. I mean, wear whatever you want, more power to ya. Just seems outta character.”
Cas turns to look at him. Abruptly, Dean can’t feel his sweat anymore. In that blistering heat all he sees is Cas. A vision. The way he’s lookin’— “No,” Dean says, and then Cas’s mouth twitches up in a smile, and it cuts at him hard. “Cas, don’t—”
“S’not a—” Sam laughs. “I guess it is, whatever, I dunno why I’m getting— defensive, over, over a word. I just.” He shrugs. “Sometimes I write about— about what I’m feeling.” He pulls his hand back from Dean, digs his right thumb into his left palm, something that brings Dean back to those godawful days when Lucifer was in his brother’s head. “When it gets real bad, I’ll, uh. I’ll describe all the things I can— can see, or smell, or whatever. Or I’ll just.” Sam exhales. “Just how I’m feeling. Or things that— that happened. I’ll write ‘em down so I know they… so I remember.”
“If anyone, it’d be you,” Dean says, desperately, trying to get it out there before he has to see it on Cas’s face when he realizes it isn’t enough. “You know that. You know it would be. But I— it’s broken in me, and you deserve better than—”
our decision, man,” Dean says. Christ, Cas’s got a martyr complex bigger than the state of Texas, like an asshole. Dean, meanwhile, has never been much for saints. The dead don’t give much of a shit about him either.
“Here,” Cas says, and Dean begrudgingly pulls Baby over into the dirt, in case some punk with an attitude tries to barrel down the one-way while they aren’t looking.
. He’d said that. Dean had driven him three and a half hours for the sunset and put him on the roof of his car and played Bitter Creek for him, and Cas had still said that.
Dean remembers they drove to the barn where Cas first touched down in Jimmy’s vessel, ‘cause Sam said something about a site of close connection even though he couldn’t— he couldn’t have known what Cas said, Dean hadn’t said a word. But they went to the barn.
“No, hey, it’s not—”
“What do you mean?”
Well, shit. When you put it like that, there ain’t much idiotic about it.
. Yeah, Dean’s all sensitivity and eloquence.
Dean watches Sam unfold the piece of paper. He pauses. He reads it. His mouth twitches. “Dean.”
Dean realizes that. He is— he’s realizing that. “Yep,” he croaks out, and then asks, palms sweating, “Didn’t you already know that? You got that— the upload or whatever, from Megadouche.”
“Dean—”
.” Dean finally heads back to the other side of the kitchen to put away the groceries. Hopefully the milk didn’t go bad while he was mooning over Cas. “You tell
is enough to get him back to level. “Sam was lookin’ up some prayers yesterday. Kinda interesting.”
all right, but what if he could. What if people could talk about him without calling him a man. He thinks a couple sentences in his head.
Eventually, Cas says, “I think… you don’t remember what you said in the Empty, when you came for me.”
Dean lets his hands fall from his face as he continues, in a rush, “And it’s not like it— it
How could he do that? How could Cas— the first, the only angel to tear it all down, to come down to earth, the— oh, God— the only person to ever see something in Dean he hadn’t put there himself— how could he become nothing, just like that? After he saw something deep inside Dean, saw Dean not as the dad who put breakfast on Sam’s table or the son who propped up his drunken father, not the angry gunslinger or the slutty womanizer, but saw him for him. Just Dean.
