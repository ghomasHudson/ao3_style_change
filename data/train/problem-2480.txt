"If I will what? Oh yes,my clothes" Sherlock quickly looked away and dug inside the bag, embarrassed. No telling what would get back to Mycroft if he let himself get distracted so easily by something so simple and basic.
"Hello? Is this from the one putting things on part of my lawn?" He pushed the button and talked into what hoped was a recorder,or an old,distance talking device.
John pulled some of the rope up to hook Sherlock to it before smiling, pulling Sherlock to him nose to nose, and making his first jump down.
"Don't be daft John, Mycroft has a grounding rod if it were a concern."
Sherlock sighed and walked away, " Come on John, let's pack our things," he said as he left. John was right behind him giving Greg an aggravated shrug as he followed.
"Your insistence on me playing so nice is not anything I care to resume unless it's needed. Here,it was not. I'm trying to tell them and figure out where the others are." Sherlock said.
"Now William! You don't stop your push ups yet, and we haven't even started the stretches. You need to be in excellent shape and endurance so you don't hurt yourself..  I want to properly leave here with you. Your idea of tact..." John turned towards Mycroft with a steady look and a smile as Sherlock resumed push ups. "Our time isn't up,I got more when I was down earlier. Everything on Baker Street will stay fine until I get back to work tomorrow and he might have a case. It's rude to barge in where your not invited, so if you will, leave us alone here"
Knowing how to get something that close to him, without seeing the one who had scribbled the map (even after trying his own tracing back), he knew to take the threat seriously.
Looking in the fridge,he saw the latest carton of milk John had bought that hasn't been put to use yet
"I may be just old, but there used to just be fortune tellers and cons people had to be wary of. Now these waves of magical recognition groups,with witches,tested telekinetics... I'll just meet up with you tomorrow and we'll just do the final steps to close this case" Lestrade said,then he turned towards them."Would you like a ride to Baker Street on the way to my office?"
John looked closely at his work,then started to lightly blow on the left ear.
"Sherlock? Are you hurt!?" John said,stumbling over and around the debree left over.
------------------------
"Thier getting sloppy! Oh! Maybe they want to be caught!" Sherlock shouted towards them.
"You may see it as a heavy start, but I've already finished the last part of the bottle of white wine for my plans" Sherlock said, before clinking his glass with John's and taking a sip.
" Your getting irritated easily John, and I'm sorry"
When they stopped at the station, someone was already waiting for them, holding the door.
"You're still exhausted, but she was busy at the park and was out after dinner, we've had no cases with this snow, and I've missed you not being here half the day and night" he hissed.
John lay down and stretched out, burying his head in Sherlock's chest as Sherlock ran his fingers through his hair.
That's how he knew what size ring to slowly pay off and get for Sherlock.
"You're just eating way too fast. You need to start sleeping off what this case did to you and you'll feel full. Any more and you'll start to spew! I know how you get with cases" John said.
"Away from Mycroft and his ambassador meeting mess?" Sherlock grumbled. As the adrenaline was crashing hard in his system, sleep was not sounding bad at all, but he didn't want to be kept track of and looked after by his brother after such a case!
"She is quite busy with your captain in the small room on the very top,now you need to stay calm until you can be taken back to England. Also don't know when we'll get to eat again between these storms" She looked at Sherlock and gave him a slow grin." No need to worry too much,you have your captain and I have mine. I doubt yours will be interrogated too harshly.You two just need to be questioned separately,or so I was told to tell you. I'll fix myself a plate and eat here, so you wouldn't need to worry about a thing"
He set the bag of clothes on the corner chair, and watched as John stumbled awake, looking downwards and modestly pulling a blanket,then the towel back around his waist.
When they sold the things they could not use,left of thier son's, Sherlock went ahead and bought the wheelchair for testing purposes.
Will definitely be editing and trimming this down when I dare get a thing called free time
John never found other men attractive. He was in the army where he was around plenty of other men on a regular basis, and never saw them as anything other than teammates,higher ranking bosses, patients...
Not only did everything stay settled with this small family and early marriage,but later in the week Mrs. Hudson stopped by with a tray of scones.
"Mycroft said to call you and only you,see you soon downstairs, goodbye" she said before hanging up.
It didn't take long before the massage had Sherlock relaxing. Well,his shoulders were smoother, and he was getting less and less tense. Of course some of the past turture scarring reminded John of the island of Santorini. He saw pictures and read about it from a magazine article one of his platoon mates had in his army days. Still beautiful in it's own right,but formed and reformed through volcanic lava.
Lestrade looked at the map that suddenly showed up with the phone buzzing.The phone showed the other phone it was linked with to be closer to Ireland, and the signal was slow.
"Well, this keeps being being added to and growing" John looked at the familiar door. He had made calls to the Sussex house, and after the phone getting passed around many offices,the latest name Sherlock went by was still presumed to be dead.
Another time while making this tale that I thought 'well, I'll just have a few things happen and go on with it, and getting things done and worked in took a lot more time and work than planned
"There is a very small trail that leads down from here. Makes sense if he had drones transporting so often, not all of them would fly. I saw the outline of the mansion back behind us here," Sherlock said, pointing further inside the cave room,or whatever it was they were in, "and the small trail went further down and along the other side of the cliff to a level of rough gravel. From there, Mycroft's holiday house is just a walk towards the channel, and should be right where the collection of holiday houses is leased and rented. I know where to go and we are so CLOSE John! I'll show you outside, and we have to be closely in queue down the cliff side. You can go ahead of me, although I hope your trips to Tesco's and military service has given you a thorough understanding of staying in queue," he ended with a smile.
"So now we are looking at the end scenes in a fashion, but do you have an idea what we should look for along with artist?" Lestrade said, shaking his head.
Something seemed off from the start, but Sherlock knew he had no gas lines or anything too caustic near his fireplace.
It was not long before clothes were by the stairs,in front of the fireplace...and it didn't take too long before Sherlock lost the ability to only focus with no physical distractions.
"You don't get it John! I've run into it before, had it well under control for years, and now it has come back in a different form,but I've seen how that goes too" Sherlock said,now looking down as he buttoned down his shirt.
The wife looked at her husband,shocked,while the husband seemed to try and sink under the table.
John thought back to the idea,does Sherlock not think his disappearance would be a reason for many people to worry themselves sick?
The chairs and table had been moved in front of the stairs, and parts of the floor marked with boundaries and X's made with bright green tape.
Lestrade smiled," Let them walk,or take a cab..... don't worry about them now".
"Thank you Grant,but we already have a ride there and have to make sure none of the evidence gets ruined" Sherlock said.
"Others that have been trafficked! Thier drugged,beaten and trained to fall in line and do as thier told" Sherlock hissed.
John was curious,but didn't want to move too much in case he was supposed to be mindlessly watching TV and Sherlock was just doing something trivial,like an upstairs loo run before going back to sleep.(at the moment,the tv held no interest for him)
" She finished off my cup of coffee before bedtime, and hasn't been up since. She may be your biological child, but you may be living with another one just like me" Sherlock said with a grin before working on his tea.
Fortunately, there were two beds. One was parallel to the window and open. The downpour of rain made it hard to see anything outside until lightning flashed again.
They soon got to adventures checking off different life to do lists, and still go back to Sussex every few decades to raise bees again.
Looking at her husband,she wrote a check and gave it to John,never taking her eyes off of her husband.
Sherlock stopped playing, set his violin and bow on a stand by the window,and sat on the end of the couch. He didn't know what he could play to make the tears stop,but he could hold a crying John.
He couldn't seem to stay still, and John figured he must finally be relieved to get a case.
"That is the other business they wanted me to be part of. They suggested using the meeting with Mycroft to thier advantage. They were trying to drug me until I would have no choice"
Her, Anderson,and Lestrade were going to meet where Anderson was with the suspect,now apprehended by Sherlock and John.
Soon the phone in the room rang. John answered it to hear a front desk voice.
Sherlock reached his hand to brush across John's chest,then down his stomach. When John was starting to look down at the left hand, the right hand held the back of his head by the hair as Sherlock leaned in to start kissing him. Then the left hand was brushing with slowly increased friction across John's crotch area.
When both were back at 221B, Sherlock sat at his chair and John got a cup, a packet of tea, and a sample of coffee he wrapped in a coffee filter.
"Hello, I am a little concerned about the same thing, but I finally found time to go to this and don't want to miss out. There's crime all over London" Sherlock shrugged, trying not to look strange.
"She's another part of our expansion. We trained her early,but to take over other business avenues in a place like London,we need to make the right appearances. A negotiating piece like you could make high level law overlook ALL sides of our dealings...or, my wife is right. You could have bidders from all around to pay for you.
===================================
"I was able to get my parents a 3 story house off of what I made with Fortnite alone!...I don't care what many in my family thinks, I don't need anyone like you to take care of me". She took another bite and seemed to wave him off
John started the coffee and was watching Sherlock pace.
Getting a cab to the courthouse was,as usual,too easy to do when Sherlock hailed it.
Sherlock seemed busy in his mind palace again, which was understandable. This case turned out to be a disappointing let down after he was so excited the day before.
He peered over where there was a coffee and tea shop that was built up in what used to be Mrs. Hudson's apartment.
John stirred. Did he just get invited to? No,he must've heard wrong,so he started towards the stairs.
"Not picky at all, but I'm not doing any contests for a while. The case that started this,the 15 year old that won the drinking contest at the Babylon 5 meet up?" Said a guy dressed....quite oddly.
My heart's just a trinket  for show
For a while,both men seemed to be gone from the living room. First Sherlock, then eventually John. Some would come in and clean up the area from time to time,but even they did not stay long.
She was put to bed upstairs, and the now shared bed was stripped. Nothing was found,and John's frustrations were building up to be quite evident.
He had to dig around in some of his old army gear that had been stored for years to find the ropes, climbing gear, and metal grips that would be needed to climb unknown terrain. He knew it would be rocky, and there were many cliffs. Hopefully they could get what they needed inside of the plastic lined bags. Sherlock had simply nodded and agreed it would work earlier. John was hoping all would get done and they could be inside somewhere before the storm hit too hard, but it never hurt to try and prepare.
" Someone that's depended on, but not thought of as important by many. An artist, but not thought to be such. I want to see the next scene,to see if they keep progressing" Sherlock said absently with a wave.
John could feel Sherlock's pulse throbbing through his hand, even as he gave John a steady look and his leg stopped tapping. Sherlock could mention the practicality that John's grey hair would stick him out among the long time employees, but he didn't care to worry John in any way further than the danger they were sneaking past different forms of guarding to get into. John was already giving Sherlock enough confidence to keep checked. Knowing he had someone who, over time, stayed by his side and made so much easier for him was something he would never forget. He might be confused as overlooking this blessing by those who only thought they could multitask.
"It doesn't burn eyes like lotion does" John said,kneeding his wrists into Sherlock's shoulders.
They came and arrested her for 'harassment',then took a blood sample from her to verify that yes,this was Jessica Bailey,who later tried to bribe her way out from behind bars.
From the door of the beach house, a shorter blonde man came out, holding a bowl of something. He smiled at the taller man and shoved the bowl in his hands, pointing at the bowl,then the puffins, swiping his hands to signal 'no', and walking back to sit on the only step at the front door to watch the man (not his brother, maybe his boyfriend?).
Sh- The perpetrator will be trading details concerning the missing persons at the event taking place at the new opening and meeting area going on tonight at the new government tech headquarters.
"What is that you've done? Are you making yourself something for once before I go?" John said smiling"It is nice to see you take care of yourself, and not try to live on coffee and patches alone all the time"
"This helped me once, when I was far away and in a bind. I didn't want to use it too often, because of everything else it brings. Lots of feelings that remain impractical to have right now, but maybe keeping this at a human perspective is why it hasn't been solved." Sherlock said before he began to shrink.
"A very squirmy one that needs to be questioned" Sherlock said,still trying to hold down and partially sit on a woman who now started cussing. In a definitely female voice while John was wrapping up his call for help from the M.E.T.
Well,after reading more prompt tales for this month, I figured I might as well throw one in and not leave our boys entirely hanging
John was helping Sherlock wind down from a case that they were able to get solved, even with a short time limit of such. At the very last minute, a flight takeoff had been stopped,and the perpetrator arrested and taken out.
"If I had not caught up,if I had not punched and tackled that man before Donavon cuffed him..."John sternly huffed
He slowly rose up, careful not to make Sherlock's head drop on the hard surface as he did.
" That's one of the milkless dishes, Fruity Oaty Bars. They will make a nice side with your coffee. You can get them as is,or with cinnamon added" the waiter explained.
He quickly jerked inside with a gasp and stood against the inside of the wall while Sherlock was quick to run over.
Sherlock got his key out and opened it.
They were dropped off right by the building they were at earlier. Sherlock, carrying his own bag, pulled John with him in the alley.
"Why can't we both be on the floor like you said? You have mentioned I would have no trouble blending in with many on several occasions," John said.
"I haven't seen any signs that anything more has been done since the weather turned worse. The company made by the man who mined and owned the cryptocurrency has been calling who he can to keep track of the theft. Him and his company and workers have been falling apart now that he has little other ways of paying anyone or for anything,but I do have theories." Sherlock explained, looking at the face of John,still seeing signs of worry.
She hit a button built into her instrument panel and heard the crackling from the one who let her replace Jeremy. This was done soon after he was the one who brought the looked for men here at a time everyone had been told it wasn't a time for private flights.
===========================================
"Did she have dark hair and eyes Sherlock?" John asked as he had dumped two cans of stew in a pot, and was stirring as it warmed up.
The high rise went up quickly until it stopped several floors far above ground. There was a small staircase built in the side of the building, that John couldn't see until Sherlock unscrewed some bolts with a driver that was tucked along the rise. He then slid a door open before crawling in.
"SMOKE US OUT?!" John stood up with the pan and looked back at Sherlock.
Had to do some reaserch for this one as well,and it helped drive a plot I was clueless on what to do with
"I think I need a long bath" Sherlock said,"I want to work through this adrenaline with what the husband wanted to train me in the way he looked at me,both actually.Don't act like it's never been on your mind. I'm not a monster as well,if you just want to sit and watch tv at the hotel,I can respect that and just keep making and going through more bad coffee. You can also think of it as part of recovery and we can never talk of it again if you wish,and imagine I am whoever you want. Now let's go closer by the road" he said before grabbing John's hand and leaving in a rush.
They were hurrying up and running around the apartment, grabbing coats,scarfs,files... something about a case.
John set the clothes down and made sure Sherlock's snoring, naked form was properly tucked in the bed right. Pillow under head, blanket over body and not rolled in a corner. Mostly in the center of the bed. He then got the clothes, found more socks under the bed, and set everything outside of the room before locking the door.
"You should relax more,you don't look well at all and we can all see it" Mrs. Hudson  whispered in Sherlock's ear.
Finally getting to a good area!
He greeted and said goodbye to Rosie rubbing her eyes and coming down the stairs. Both of their plates and Sherlock's coffee were on the kitchen table,and John had cooked his first. Eating his eggs and working on the second cup of coffee as he made thier breakfast.(He had given the first cup to Sherlock,who had risen early for a post case night. John figured it was the smell of the coffee,which could help the sleep filled eyes and get him stirred before Rosie would be up.)
With no mind to the honks and curses received along the way, he jumped from car to car until he jumped on top of a ladder he had propped on the side of the building and climbed down.
"You know,we could end up starting a fire here, and burning it all" John said,sticking his hands into his armpits for warmth.
"You must be the Rodriguez's" Sherlock said, turning back around and looking in thier direction. He waved his hand towards the couch. "Have a seat,please" he said, as if he was remembering lines he was to say.
Sherlock checked his mobile and breathed a sigh of relief.
John got his cup of coffee with a plate of what looked like large,long frosted wheat squares with different colored fruit oozing from each one. As ordered,the left side also had brown sprinkles all over the squares.
Sherlock smiled,took John's bag to be put down on his side of the room, and started stripping.
John stood up with his back straight and feet together.
Mycroft stepped closer and quietly whispered to the guard who turned and left. Mycroft turned and walked towards Sherlock, who was going straight to Mycroft's office.
Sherlock had an easier time with his family, where he had kept distant enough and it was just accepted that he could take everything in stride and even Mycroft helped with the legality of getting much set up for very long term use.
Here's an idea to aim for now that I did some research
Sherlock saw the husband walk to him, cracking his knuckles,while right by him. He turned to get a better look. The wife was readying a syringe. She noticed him looking at him and smiled. Seeing the shadow right beside her,he knew when to dodge.
"Not a concern," Sherlock said, undoing his seatbelt. The cabbie slid the card through the reader and gave a total, but Sherlock was already jogging out.
"There were many footprint trails leaving the fire Sherlock, it's not enough to go on suspicions alone. What else would you try to have written up to do!?" Lestrade said, looking back at Sherlock.
"Among other things John. I couldn't ask Lestrade or Anderson to help me with the sparring. I know you can fight, and we have done one dance when I showed you the waltz. This should come easier to you, and there will be too much costume for anyone to ever recognize you. Just keep in mind"
"Yes" Sherlock told the driver before looking downwards." Make it quick, we should have been there already" he said,as he gave the driver a folded cash bonus.
As they walked away, there was fuss from what seemed to be the well dressed man on a mobile, but it was in what sounded like Cantonese.
"I was given some strange co-ordinates. This weather won't get better where you're going. You shouldn't have embarrassed him to this extent, I do hope you find safety."
"Now that you are here John" Lestrade said, walking over " still cannot afford to have you two around to possibly disturb evidence just yet, but I called in and got you two a room at the hotel down the Marylebone. Just identify yourselves and show I.D. it's already been paid for. This should be cleared and you both will be able to return tommorow"
" What business is it of yours? That man right there" Sherlock turned and pointed behind him "is Dr. Watson, and both of our clothes are simply being cleaned" the coffee maker dinged and Sherlock was quick to turn towards it. "The coffee is finished. Feel free to leave, as I am not making any for you".
As the skull could hear slurping and sucking noises, Sherlock's eyes were soon open and John gave a low whimper as his hips started moving.
Well, winning can take many forms
"Everyone has been accounted for, arrested and are being taken away." Lestrade said to Sherlock and John.
"So, as you said,you need things like....what we did earlier, off and on now when you shift?" John said
He smiled and worked on the fire again, looking back at Sherlock.
"Well,there and there is blood obviously,that contrast over there and coming over on a top layer is bile, but it's much fresher." John said " Did forensics get a sample here to see if it's from the same person?"
With such things as the catheter and the IV, now also being taken out, who knows how long he was out. Where was he even at?
It was a florist shop,that sold flower arrangements at the lowest level many of the drifter or flying cars would leval at to shop,but this was still an older part of London.
In the reality outside of John Watson's head,he didn't actually make it to 3 months of keeping mostly hands off and distanced. He didn't like to leave Sherlock alone to meet clients they knew little about,but he couldn't ask him to stop consulting. He took work off earlier on several occasions afterwards so Sherlock would not be entirely unguarded, but it seemed the client base went back to being made up of the cluelessnessly upset, but harmless. /p>
"Yes,but you made too many of the same kinds of mistakes" Sherlock said, getting up from his microscope"Another woman with short,dark hair, and the head to get far in her field .But still a small mistake being made that sets everything up to fail.".
"You use it as a stabilizer in your lab! When you can't use water!"
"Thank you" John said, sipping from his cup. "Although many would think it odd to stabilize the great Sherlock Holmes into just as bland as the rest of us to prevent more fights than usual"
John jumped when he heard the door squeak quietly, a nurse had just been in to check Rosie's stats, she shouldn't be due another check so soon. John turned and stiffened, he hadn't seen this guy before and he looked a little too threatening to be in a children's ward. John swallowed hard, and before he could react, the guy had pulled out a gun and fired. John expected to feel the heat and the burn of a bullet, but instead he felt a sting in his neck, as if he had been stung by a bee. His hand shot up to his neck and pulled out a dart. He was furious. He could feel the drug taking effect but he will not let his daughter go!
“You love me?” He had asked, and Mycroft had stilled in pushing John out the room, forcing him to answer.
The other man scoffed. “Yes, but you led them to their deaths and you survived when she should have done. You used her for your own needs.” The other hissed and gave a kick to John's stomach, making him curl in on himself in pain. “How did you manage to survive!?”
The body itself was a female, wearing a lot of pink. Lestrade did look pale when he got Sherlock, and refused to mention anything about the case. Just explaining that he needed to see it for himself.
“John!” Sherlock snapped as much as he could in his condition, getting his friend to focus on him instead.
“She's alive, an ambulance will be ..” The noise upstairs had Sherlock stopping mid sentence. Then John had heard it, a cry. A baby's cry. His daughter.
They had finally made it to the crime scene, an abandoned factory, not too far from civilization. The factory was due for demolition some time that day, so obviously the police had assumed the killer had dumped the body here in hopes it would be lost under the rumble and written off as a terrible accident. It was the manor in which the young female was killed that made Lestrade get Sherlock, no matter what the other's on the force had thought about him.
'Did you Miss Me. M xoxo' written in the woman's blood.
It was just any old Tuesday for John. He'd gotten up around 5am and was ready to start his day. He was not normally up this early, but then again, he would defiantly not fall back to sleep. Not after last night's (This morning's?) nightmare. So instead he had gotten up, trotted down the stairs and headed straight for the kitchen. The flat was dark, almost hitting winter and Christmas not too far away so there was no early morning light, no birds, just the whistling of the wind as it battered against the windows.
No that she was in the warmth, the cries had settles to sniffles just as john entered the room, he ignore Sherlock completely and placed the basket on his chair.
“I ain't leaving either.” Lestrade piped up, gazing hard at Mycroft and crossing his arms against his chest as if daring him to make a move. Mycroft only nodded as a television set was wheeled in and the door made secure.
"Twins," Sherlock whispered and shook his head slowly. "Well. That's one way to fake your death I suppose."
"She's mine." John whispered back. "I'm a father, and she's mine."
The sound of more feet rushing to his side caught his attention, the order to clean him up barley registered with him. He knew that shuffling, he recognised the voice that replied in the affirmative and he definitely knew the sounds of a bed being wheeled in.
Sherlock growled loudly and felt like throwing his phone out of the window. So Lestrade didn't even now!? What the hell was going on.
And thank you for the comments and kudos, hope  you're still liking this.
"Yes." Again John looked to Mycroft and shuffled nervously a bit. "Our job can be a bit dangerous at times, but she is safe within these walls. You can remove the surveillance within the flat, but not outside the flat. If we are out and Rosie is within these walls with a nanny, or Mrs Hudson or whoever, and you see something that is amiss outside, you contact one of us straight away, no questions asked, and you get someone over here if we can't make it quick enough."
He swallowed hard and lifted the Moses basket by the handle and carried it inside, closing the door with his foot. He continued up the stairs, never taking his off of the baby in the basket, or the envelope against the blanket.
Doctor Harrison made his way to Rosie, checking her breathing, taking her temperature. At one point, he took a blood sample, which made John stiffen and inch closer, but still Rosie didn't stir. John was panicking, trying to keep calm, his leg began to ache and his left hand began to shake. It wasn't right! Doctor Harrison had checked all vitals and checked Rosie's eye reactions as she slept and he frowned.
"Ah yes, of course. You may have a trust fund Sherlock, but I know John does not, therefore .."
“Sherlock!” John went to move, but again he was stopped. He felt torn. “I swear to you Jim, to you both. I will kill you.” John growled and the he moved. He grabbed the agent's wrist, twisted the gun from his grasp and used him as a human shield against Agent Number Two as he fired. With his shield, he shot a head shot to agent number two and pushed the other away from him. He raised his gun to Sebastian Moran, a fire in his eyes.
“Sally!? What the hell!?” John had to yell over a screaming child, only now did he lower the gun. He was about to turn to take his child, just to hold her when Sally's voice stopped him.
“You killed my brother!” Moriarty screeched, his anger escaping him, making him lose his composure. John would never admit it out loud, but Jim's changeable attitude terrified him.
It had taken a lot longer to get to the crime scene as Sherlock would have liked. They had to explain the appearance of the little girl in the flat to Lestrade, and then Sherlock had to fight them both in getting John to come with him. Sherlock had refused to work without John, John had refused to leave Rosie behind and Lestrade had refused to let a new born baby onto a crime scene. It was tedious. In the end, John had reluctantly handed Rosie to Mrs Hudson, with strict instructions to call if there was anything, and Sherlock had to practically drag the man from the flat.
It was hard to write, so please take care x
The silence was deafening. “Of course. You took her in just as much as I did, you've become smitten with the poor girl. I may be her biological father, but she is still our daughter.” another shiver ran through him just as the hospital door opened and Mycroft entered the room, mobile outstretched towards John, his face so full of anger, fire and ice. “Now I see why they call you the Ice man Mycroft.” John whispered, taking the phone without any further question. It appeared to be for him after all.
There had been no word from Moriarty, nor from John's kidnappers. Everything was silent and Sherlock hated it. He needed to get out of this hospital bed and he needed to find John, then find Jim. In that order, despite what the stubborn git had said.
John was beside himself all day. He would pace the living room when Rosie was resting. Or he would pace the living room holding a crying Rosie, or a tired Rosie, or even a hungry Rosie. With or without her, John would pace the room. It was beginning to get to Sherlock, just a little bit. So after three, possibly another four hours of this pacing, Sherlock had, had enough. He rose from his seat and grabbed john by his arms, effectively stopping the pacing.
Sherlock had had checked out so John looked after his little girl. Fed her, bathed her and changed her. Then he settled her down for the night and got to work. He was not idle during Sherlock's adventure. He was, as Mary had put it, obsessed. But he had gathered more intel than anyone else because he knew where to look. Or rather, it was a happy incident.
“Don't you fucking dare!” John yelled, stepping in front of the gun, on hand pointing in Sally's face. He didn't care that her hand shook, he didn't care that she paled a little, and he didn't care for the officers behind her. All he cared about was that she had just pointed a gun to Sherlock who was holding his premature baby. “You ever raise a gun towards my daughter again, I will have you!”
John was marched into Scotland Yard, flanked on either side. To left was Donovan, gripping his arm tightly as his hands were cuffed behind him. A second officer walked on his right, not touching him, only giving side long glances and smirking every step of the way. A few officers led the way, while the remaining that had busted in their home early that morning where walking behind, obviously to avoid any escape attempt. Like that was going to happen. John's face was like thunder, pain and anger flashing in his eyes. Donovan really did a number on his left shoulder, and he vowed to make her pay for that, as well as aiming a gun at his daughter. He silently swore to have her badge.
“Tell me, did you know the leak?” He asked, and again John felt compelled to answer.
“Of course I do you prick. You're my best friend, my only friend. You saved me when I was half dead. You showed me what I was missing and brought me back from the brink. You're amazing and wonderful and I love you.”
He lifted his head and raised an eyebrow to his would be torturer, but no words were coming and John could not quite understand. But then again, maybe whoever this guy was intended to break his fingers? Which would hurt for a while and could have ever lasting effects, depending on how they were treated afterwards. What he was not expecting to see was a collection of wooden tooth picks, sharpened more so at one end, and a small hammer. Suddenly realisation dawned and John struggled relentlessly.
With that they both giggled softly, trying not to wake the little girl from her slumber, and Sherlock breathed easily once again. He will adapt. He meant every word, he would be lost without John, but not for reasons John suspects. Sherlock is not as unfeeling as people around him tend to think. It's not that he doesn't care about sentiment, or that he just doesn't care. It's just that he cares too much.
“How else is the government going to extract the truth from its enemies!?” Sherlock retorted and scowled at his brother. But all his energy was wiped. His breathing had become harsh, almost gasping through constant pain, he needed rest. Which Mrs Hudson could tell as she had increased the morphine just slightly and had called for a nurse to induce a sedative. God bless that woman, Sherlock thought as he slowly slipped back into his own darkness.
Donovan made her way to the chair in front of John, a desk separating them, and her college took to the one in the corner. No one said anything while Donovan set the tape to record and pulled out a couple of folders and papers that were secured in a case at her side.
The man stepped back and he disappeared from view. It was only a few seconds later that John felt the crack of the whip against his naked back, the burning sensation of his skin break apart and he yelled out in pain as the whip lashed against his back the second time. A third. Fourth, fifth, John was lost to agony and lost count. He could feel the warmth of blood seeping over his back each time the whip connected with such force against his skin.
Hello again! Thank you for keeping with me on this one, I do hope you're all still interested in this. Not yet close to finishing but I will get there.
This was done using my phone, during break times at work. Enjoy
I hope you're still with me on this. Please leave a comment/Kudos, let meknow what you think :)
John was led out of 221B in handcuffs when he refused point blank to leave his daughter. Mrs Hudson was a mess of tears as she held onto a tired, upset Rosie and watched as John was driven away in a police car with Sherlock following in a taxi.
Sherlock was silent at John's sudden outburst. John noticed Sherlock's shock and he sagged a little against his head board, one hand coming to rub at his face. “Sorry. I just .. I just. It makes sense now as to how he walked if I'm honest.” John whispered.
“Watch it.” John snapped, trying to get as comfortable as he could, but it was impossible. “Can you at least remove the bloody cuffs?” Again, there was no answer.
“Because Moran was a complete moron, he gave us back our tags and clothing, including radios. Which were in good working order. Which was how I knew we were dead when they said they would free us. They cut loose our bonds and led us to the desert and set us free. We ran, all three of us ran for it. I saw the first one go down after five seconds, Bill not long after and he fell right before me so I went down with him, shifting my position just slightly. The bullet meant for my heart, went into and out of my left shoulder instead. I knew I had to remain still and appear dead, the Taliban would not have known to check for the pulse and Sebastian was too far away to check himself, so I remained still and silent, eyes closed not daring to look until the sun set and night fell. I knew they wouldn't be stupid enough to stay out during the night. It was too cold. So when it fell, I radioed for evacuation and kept my radio on so they could triangulate the single. I gathered the other two together and huddled with them. They were dead but the least I could do was ensure they got home. The rest is down to exceptional hospital staff and army medics. I was sure I was dead. Came close too."
“But you're not gay.” Sherlock could only reply.
Sherlock paled and stood stock still. He ignored Lestrade but turned to face John. John who had gone as white as a sheet. His phone in a trembling hand as he spoke calmly to Mrs Hudson. Once he had hung up, he quickly fired off a text. Sherlock knew he was getting Mycroft to keep an extra eye on the flat. When John nodded, Sherlock turned towards the crime scene, taking in every detail, as he would any other case. He then went to inspect the message that was left him him against the wall.
"We. John, we." Sherlock placed an arm around his best friend and pulled him into an embrace. "We will think of something I asure you. But first, she'll need a name."
Warning: torture!
“The autopsies revealed nothing either. I'm sorry Sherlock.” She supplied, moving closer. Sherlock in instinct actually held Rosie out to Molly to enable her take a hold. She shifted on her feet but finally took the child and moved to the other side of the bed, allowing Rosie to still be within reach and sight, Molly knew Sherlock a little too well.
Salty, but,sachirrine tasting sweat
Another round of re-edit the last chapter,then make the next
John grinned " That we do, I certainly got enough. I'll be over there until this is done."
Several ideas on what to do here,but nothing solid,so let's just jump right in
He reached up his pant leg and ripped the keys from their sewn in area.
John smiled knowing when a good bit (but not all) is healed, Sherlock may be pacing tracks in the floor and dying to get out. He may try anything to get John to tell Lestrade to give him a case to work, but as his doctor...well,this is not the first patient he's had to enforce restraints on. Maybe the largest by far,but not the first.
"We're not that different at all, I'm sure you can see. Now work with me to get the stops and trouble lifted so I can get even with the truth. Or things might get worse for you and your tied up love" Irene quietly hissed at Sherlock,who dove into his mind palace.
"What do you suggest I do? Let the next one get away?" he smirked.
"John," Sherlock said nearby, softly. "The hail is back, and that is all. It's Sherlock. We are in Lundy. Getting evidence. That is all. You were curled against the wall before you rolled down here. Can you talk?"
Now with this talk of staying at Molly's,she fingered the necklace chains in her pocket. At first, she didn't know how to get the necklaces off of her parents without them waking, but then she saw the part that kept them held together.
During the short time it took for the butter to melt,he put everything that had been taken back into the refrigerator. He would wait before working with further mixes and molds until after this was finished.
Sherlock grabbed John's hand and ran as sounds of hail hitting solid object could soon be heard.
"Why doesn't John have what looks like large ear coverings?" Sherlock asked.
Several girls were gathered in a circle talking,in red,blue,yellow,and one had a green colored uniform.
The luggage was being taken out from another storage section at the bottom of the plane, and the young, drugged son was taken out of the duffel bag. He had been ducktaped into a curled ball before being stuffed in and wrapped in clothes,but still. With the large luggage storage location, before the plane had reached too high of an altitude,he would have frozen and suffocated on the too thin air.
Sherlock welcomed the latest clients that emailed thier queries to the blog.
"What do you make of this? It's like a Degas gone dark. This flowing part through here? That's spinal fluid. They had to have let it dry before they could use it like this,or it would be runnier" John said, swabbing a sample of the fluid before bagging it and moving on.
John looked up, sniffing and wiping a sleeve across his nose before looking Sherlock in the eyes. " It is not something you would get. I need my drink back" he said before leaning over to get up.
"Thank you for getting this back," he turned towards the fire and curled back into a ball,but let the quilt drape more." I could get used to more time off until more roads are cleared up." He then looked at Sherlock and started to sit up with a stretch.
John sees so much within thier lives,but he observes none within it.
They stepped outside and walked along the street lights,as it had been dark for some time.
Sherlock walked in the kitchen and looked through the cabinet, getting a cylinder out. He then poured from the cylinder into a small pot, and set it by the sink.
He could hear steps behind,then beside him. He turned and put his arms around John,who was crouched.
"I'm going to spar with you and see what needs to be improved in your fighting. I don't expect you to carry a real blade on you, but in a real fight you use whatever you can get your hands on and use the same moves and balance as you do at these"
" I could not if I wanted to"John said sighing, holding Sherlock closer. " I'm back to not knowing what I...how anything works it seems." He smiled and looked at Sherlock."If I knew being with you could be like that? Why have I paid for so many dates...I know what you'll say"John said,with a finger over Sherlock's lips. " I also owe you for tonight and don't even know how you would like me to make it even or if I could."
He wasn't sure how to keep a conversation going when he was far out of his element.
John waited until Sherlock's curls were pretty far down before starting himself. Closing what he could behind him, it began as a pretty tight squeeze.
John finally got home at 221B,but was puzzled at the police cars parked,and driving by it. He went to Sherlock giving his statement on the front steps.
"Speaking of your brother sir,he knows we're here as ambassadors to some trades going on between different parts of a business we would like to expand further with" the man said.
With Moriarty's latest plan, just finding Sherlock was not all it took to rescue him
"I don't know who taught you that,but you're unlicensed to use magic at a crime scene,and you could still be looking at a cover up, made to be found so we will chase after the wrong facts instead of gathering what will help us." Sherlock said.
Looking down, John saw Sherlock laying on the floor by the still made bed facing the door.
That ass was anything but proper and professional. He was not even guiding his hand when it had been heading to it. Sherlock had put on bits of weight over time since he's been back living with John again. Most of it went to muscle,that could be seen clearly along his scarred back. That right there,he thought as he looked back down at the end of Sherlock's spine,was much more bone when he last dressed in a sheet.
"So,this is a costume,but what is that?" Sherlock said, pointing to the other hand.
Btw,these chapters can work together,but I did not set out to mean them to work in a linear fashion
He had sat in his own chair and stared at Sherlock.
"First part is up this, it can end at one of my bolt holes, but we'll just go further. Let's go," Sherlock had said a minute ago before looking at John, then going up the ladder.
"This is why we are both raising Rosie now John" Sherlock smiled over his cup before drinking." We see no need to put her in a box we understand."
"Just another double life set up,using someone with money to support someone who can't keep it" Sherlock said as he looked at the wife "thank you,but I should be leaving. Anything from here is all legal work, and we work in investigative consulting,not divorce".
The wrestlers they filled in for had been given a paid break to far away hikes and cabins by the accusing wife using her husband's credit. They were questioned quite thoroughly, and found not to be accomplices to Edwardo in any way.
This has turned out to be cut up into more chapters than I thought. At least this is a finished story that's been formatted and cut,so I won't leave any readers hanging while life stops the story
I have to get away John thought, a shower could do him good. He could have been too long without a date,but if he was honest,he knew no woman could be structured like that...
He walked over and placed a hand on his shoulder and gave it a shake. When Sherlock looked up,he pointed to the mug and gave a thumbs up,then down.
Our daughter? Mycroft stayed quiet. He never thought he would hear such a thing from his brother,but he had no time to argue. Something about him did sound very different.
After his parents passed away in a car accident,he inherited thier debts, and could not go to the art academy he had been accepted at.
There was better dining available for the surgeons and high level doctors closer to his office, but this section was empty of nurses,tech staff. The food was,well,it worked well enough.
"She found someone. There is no wedding because her partners parents don't agree to this,but they have also been fostering a pair of siblings they will legally adopt while thier at it which they also do not agree with. I was happy to call and hear her voice when I called her this morning. We'll be meeting up at the new Selene's later with the whole group, for what she joked will likely be the last drink they will risk having for some time with kids around"
"We need to go now gents, your familiar with how he can be" John said, tugging Sherlock's arm. "Good luck Katy! Will see you soon if you're moving near here.Ask everyone else,we have to go!" He said, blowing a kiss her direction.
As years went by, and the flurry of cases was brought back to the living room,the skull saw and heard many things the living ones would love to know the secrets of.
Only someone descended from the Holmes line can own it. So,every few decades when Sherlock and John have to move everything to a different name they go by, the last Holmes has a different 'son' that shows up. He takes over payments for it, and often enough time has passed that no one will know this 'son' looks exactly like the father that raised bees with a partner and left.
Then he turned and walked further down the alley, seemingly fascinated by the 'artwork'.
With that much evidence,it wasn't hard to lock him up.
Sherlock showed her a picture of a large house with a pool with people barely seen taking the for sale sign down.
He prepared a needle and injected him with Ritalin.
The way Sherlock was such an exception in so many areas....
The cab stopped in front of 221B, and John let the driver run Mycroft's card to pay.
Sherlock's nerves were still rattled,but he slowly cooled and drank his tea. He stoicly let the heat calm him and sighed,but his shoulders would not relax.
This meant the clothes would feel worse! He took a hotel pamphlet and his cell and closed the door behind him as he went to the bathroom.
John thought so clearly before he started snoring into sweaty curls....
"Mycroft knows right where the paperwork is, even though he wasn't invited. We didn't need to bother anyone to act as witnesses with the office staff and that was good enough." Sherlock said,"now back to this,unless you want to have an over the top 1st anniversary dinner and invite half of London."
He soon heard the kettle boiling and looked to the kitchen, where a plaid clad John was there, fixing tea for both.
Sherlock was sitting in his chair with his hands propped in front of his face,but his coat and boots were still on.
Which was good, because soon a naked,sweaty Sherlock sprawled himself across the bed with a mention of "feels better" before he was out.
Sherlock opened the door and stepped into the hallway. John was relieved that Sherlock was wearing clothes. They were not good clothes,being a t-shirt, silk drawstring pants and house shoes,but he was covered.
Then, Sherlock,then John were back around again. They brought a baby that was loud, and looked at the skull at times.
John took a deep breath and calmed himself before looking at Sherlock and asking. "How what goes exactly? You're not giving an answer that points to anything. You know I will help you if I can, but not if I don't understand. Speak to me as your doctor, we'll go from there"
Then he heard noises from the bedroom.
Soon, Sherlock stepped out of the bedroom, wrapped in a sheet, and walked towards the laundry room.
Anderson looked at his phone he had recorded with, knowing the file will be transferred among computers at the investigation office.
"Hmmm" John hummed as he backed up and looked into Sherlock's eyes."I want to talk to the MET,but I feel this is a trap that is being waited on. You sound sick,or not quite right.I have a few more days before being expected at work. Do you have anything in your lab where I can draw your blood? You've been drugged for days! I want to at least...no,not my office...maybe have Molly see what all is in your system? What were you given that led to Moriarty giving you back, hands off?"
John was soon back with two cups of hot tea made the way both liked thiers. Drinking the hot tea settled Sherlock somewhat, but he still wasn't in the mood to get up or even pace much. He figured he would spend a lot of the time sleeping this sick feeling off,but he watched as John took a sip,set his cup down,then walked over to unplug the phones and the TV before sitting back down.
" Is that what you think?" Mycroft smiled
John sighed, how was he sure? Then looked to the kitchen. Looking through it, he soon found a kettle in the pantry, along with different canned goods and a few boxes of dried mixes.
Sherlock went to his chair and sat in it,while John went to start the kettle.
John stretched again,then looked out to see the sunlight over the horizon.
He then returned to the couch, and leaned into Sherlock without making him move or change out of his pose.
"Thank you" John said,then he turned to Sherlock." I'll phone a cab here, and I still have Mycroft's card to pay for the ride. You can talk,we can sleep, whatever you need" he explained, trying to keep calm.
Rosie had no interest in any of it.
It sniffed the evidence on the table,then ran to the door. Sherlock shifted back to human, looked at the door,then looked out different windows. One window he seemed content with, and left it open as he shifted back to a fox form.
So, in the end, what was the point of it all? Apart from proving that everything Sherlock has ever believed about sentiment is true?
John shoots Sherlock a dirty look, encouraging him… well,
If it was, Sherlock hides it well.
And John has chosen her in return.
He’s got something for almost everyone on his list. Rosie has just recently begun to take an interest in picture books, so John and Sherlock had agreed to get her a big bunch of those, and John has just spent the better part of an hour scouring the Children’s section of Waterstones for the best ones. That part had actually been mildly festive as John had looked forward to going through them with Rosie on his lap. They’re also giving her a stuffed tiger (the only gift idea that Sherlock has contributed with this year, but predictably the best one). It has been on display in the window of the little second hand shop on the corner of Baker Street for the past two months and Rosie has been eagerly gesturing and giggling and exclaiming “tiger, tiger” at it every time they’ve taken her past it in her stroller. Sherlock says he’s been close to getting it for her on no less than five separate occasions just from the sheer longing on her face. It’s a bit on the pricey side even though it’s second hand, but what the hell. It’s Christmas.
confiscate.”
If Sherlock doesn’t wake up, what was the point of all of that?
John chuckles.
of all people, deprived of any control over his own transport… there’s something deeply wrong about that, something unnatural, grotesque even. The man who sees through everything and everyone in seconds, the man who proclaims himself to be a brain (the rest of him being mere transport for said brain), the man whom John has often thought to be half cat from the way he manages to move with such complete grace and dignity, his movements always flowing and vibrant yet completely controlled down to the last muscle… for that man to have no say in when his eyes are open or closed, for him to simply go out like an extinguished candle with no prelude and no warning… if John never has to see that again in his life, it will be too soon.
“I suppose I did. I…”
He swallows again. Damn his suddenly dry mouth.
Sherlock turns his gaze on him.
angry, he’s bloody furious! But at the same time, he can’t avoid the realisation that just seeing Sherlock, just hearing his voice and feeling the heat from his body, just being bloody near him again after two years, just
… John can’t be back quickly enough.
. But I didn’t know that, I just felt… I felt…”
Sherlock steels his gaze. “Brother mine… get out.”
“It’s not all your fault, Sherlock. Far from it. I’m… Christ, I’ve messed it up too. You don’t know the half of it. And I’m sorry. It’s true what you said, that I never asked, that I never
“I love you.”
It’s not a proposal. John doesn’t want to chalk this up to anything as ordinary, as stereotypical, as
Suddenly, he can’t stand it. He can’t stay here, he needs to get out! He needs to shut the door, lock it, bolt it, place a dresser in front of it if that’s what it takes! Sherlock turns and slams the door behind him, automatic locks clicking back in place. Up, up, up, now! He nearly stumbles on the stairs in his hurry. He wants out now. He wants to go back to the safety of Baker Street, back to the safety of the real world. His hand reaches for the handle of the door and…
“Why didn’t you call me?” His voice is strained with emotion, but at least he manages to keep himself from shouting again.
Again that reassuring tone of voice, utterly persuasive in its lack of demand.
In any case.
Sherlock looks at him unfathomably. If nothing else, John’s reply seems to have put a damper on his anger.
By now, it’s happened at least half a dozen times. It should start to feel like a routine, a new part of their dynamic just like Mary is. It just doesn’t. It catches John unawares every time and steals his complete attention. It seems a bit not good, to be honest.
Mycroft turns towards him then and John is struck by how much this resembles a court of law. A court of law that he very much doesn't have the patience to deal with right now.
was somehow all wrong. The absolute nightmare of feeling as though every step he took was across a plain littered with landmines and the wedding itself was the day when he finally, irreversibly stepped on one. Every minute spent examining the confused, conflicted tangle of emotions in the pit of John’s stomach that has been there for years, but only truly came into its own the moment Sherlock came back from the dead. Seeing his new life being ripped apart in two minutes flat when Sherlock stepped through those doors at the restaurant, crashing back into his life with the elegance of a two-tonne cement truck. The process he went through when he met Mary, rebuilding his life after Sherlock while building a new life with her. All the pain and heartbreak he endured after he thought Sherlock had died the first time around. All the
As time passes and John still refuses to appear, Sherlock can feel his impatience grow. After how angry John had seemed to be yesterday and his promise to be back first thing in the morning, it’s a tiny bit rude of him to postpone his return like this, isn’t it? It must be at least noon by now. Mrs. Hudson hasn’t stopped by yet either. And that despite the fact that Mr. Chinnery must surely have left by now to play what Sherlock is genuinely unable to refer to as music, at least not without such a hefty dose of sarcasm that it never fails to appal John and Mrs. Hudson alike. As though it’s his fault he was born without the appropriate level of amusia to endure Mr. Chinnery’s so-called playing.
Sherlock’s face has grown dark and cold, an impenetrable, furious mask.
“The waltz. Turned out to be suitable for dancing after all. I was slightly worried it was going to prove too fast for your two left feet.”
Also, I am DUMB!! For some reason, I never noticed the big, obvious "Reply" button under the comments section, which is why I haven't individually replied to any comments before now. That is hereby rectified. I don't know how I could have missed it, but... well, you live and you learn. I will attempt to reply individually to all comments in the future as well!
“Two, Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrow. They seem to zone in on him, like a missile ready for launch. It changes the entire way he looks, the way he holds himself and the expression he carries. He switches from insecure vulnerability to piercing intensity in the blink of an eye. John has never known anyone else who could do that. Though it seems to repel most people, it’s always drawn him in. He finds it almost electrifying, spreading a thrumming beat from the tips of his hair to his deepest core and back. Making a shiver run down his spine.
As John turns on the telly and finds some mundane cooking show to watch (do they produce any other kind of television program these days?), Sherlock shifts into a somewhat proper sitting position, mostly to sit closer to him. John’s jeans are slightly damp against his pyjama bottoms. Is it raining outside? A quick glance out of the window confirms his hypothesis – and a voice springs up in his head, congratulating him on his successful deduction with no small amount of sarcasm. Sherlock isn’t quite sure if the voice is his or not.
How could he possibly say any of that though? But he doesn’t want to lie either. This is not a time for dishonesty. This is not a time for shying away, for withholding how he actually feels. Not out of concern for who John is and wants to be, not out of concern for what others might think of him, not even out of concern for Mary and what this might mean for him and her.
It’s almost dawn when he and Moriarty make their way back to Baker Street. Moriarty follows him all the way to the front door, watching as Sherlock finds his key, but he hesitates in the door. It instantly replaces the warm, floating feeling that Sherlock has been nurturing all night with a nasty cramp of unease.
Mrs. Hudson is chatting with John’s uncle. Lestrade is having a drink with one of John and Mary’s colleagues. Molly is dancing with her new fiancé, the man whom Sherlock is about 80% certain is named Tom. Janine, Mary’s friend and bridesmaid that he has been forced to briefly make an acquaintance with today, lights up when she sees him looking and he returns her smile instinctively, taking a step towards her… as she points to the man next to her that she has managed to attract the attention of and sends Sherlock a thumbs up.
“How is he?”
His opposite and negative is not out there. Jim is not just another criminal to be outsmarted and defeated. He is not even the best criminal opponent that Sherlock will ever face.
It’s not a creak. It’s a roar of deafening proportions, as though an earthquake is about to tear the entire construction apart. His head feels ready to explode. God, just stop it, stop it,
Perhaps he’s being paranoid because he has something hide.
Moriarty moves onto the small step separating the front door from the street. It’s not big enough for two people to stand on at the same time and parts of his shoulder and chest end up pressing against Sherlock’s side. He’s standing so close that Sherlock almost convinces himself he can feel Moriarty’s heartbeat like a warm pulse reverberating out from him. Everything else is dead quiet.
He’s wretched.
Sherlock takes a breath in, holding it for a second before letting it out again as deeply as possible. He empties his lungs as best he can and pictures himself opening the front door of his mind palace. Opens his eyes to look down the hallway even though his eyes in the body lying on the sofa remain closed.
Sherlock has never been strong enough to resist it. But John has always been there to resist it for him. John has always been strong on his behalf. John has always given him a reason to fight it, offered him an alternative target for his loneliness.
bed in
The silent, tormented gaze of the person he loves more than he loves himself. The person who’s proved to him once and for all that whatever thoughts and affections Sherlock might have spotted in his eyes from time to time is no match for the love he has for someone else, the love that Sherlock can see only too clearly. The loud, expectant glare of the person he loves as he loves himself. The person who wants Sherlock, who sees him for who he is and not only accepts him, but encourages him to be the best he can be, and yet now asks him to do the one thing he just cannot do.
“You can’t always live up to the expectations of others, you know… Much less your own. You can try, but it just… life doesn’t always work out that way.” John presses his lips together, regretfully and yet almost resignedly. “Or maybe… sometimes you don’t know what the right thing is. Not just what you
John is showing none of that hesitation now. In two short seconds, he’s reached to the front of Sherlock’s shirt and undone the buttons, pushing it out of the way with an almost childish sense of urgency and entitlement. Sherlock is still wearing his dressing gown on top and his decidedly dishevelled shirt is partly lost beneath it. When John’s hands run over his now naked chest and it’s almost electrifying, an intensity like nothing Sherlock has ever experienced before. He thought that a seven percent solution of cocaine was lightening in a bottle. That was before this.
He stops in front of the last door. Hesitates. This is it. This is the deepest, darkest corner of his mind palace, at least as far as he is aware. The demons beneath the road… this is where he traps them. Where he pushes them into a recess, hides them out of sight and locks the door in a vain hope that he might forget about them. This is a room he’s fought with all his life, a periodically returning sickness at the very centre of his being. There have been periods of relative peace and quiet, periods where Sherlock has been able to largely forget about this door and what’s behind it and convince himself that it’s all under control. The longest of these periods, the most lasting time of peace in Sherlock’s life, has been the time spent with John.
John’s smile deepens, but Sherlock isn’t fooled. The sadness is still there in his eyes.
“Miss you too," he responds, by reflex.
“Is vite.”
Apart from that first night when John didn’t have the energy or indeed the mood to listen, Sherlock hasn’t mentioned his activities or whereabouts during the last couple of years with more than a sentence or two thrown in every once in a while.
“You did, did you? You went to the park?”
It’s not normal.
“I’m here. You alright?”
John frowns.
Logically, John had known that being inside another man would feel different to being inside a woman. As straight as John has tried to make himself appear, he has had thoughts, especially following some rather interesting anatomy lectures during university and some rather too steamy showers during his military days. He’s no stranger to the rodeo. But experiencing it in person, feeling it rather than just imagining what it would feel like…
Rosie is pointing out of the window for what feels like the thirtieth time this afternoon, apparently completely besotted by the way the snowflakes seem to suddenly appear at the top of the window only to subsequently disappear at the bottom. Her hot breath creates fog on the glass. Her arms are flailing excitedly.
not to shout. Leave it to Mycroft, let him run through his dictatorial shit and then John can say what he really needs to say afterwards.
He isn’t quite shouting, but it’s close, and it takes Sherlock completely by surprise. He must have hit a nerve somehow, although he isn’t sure which one or how. He finds himself recoiling slightly from John’s outburst, still far from his usual self and unable to respond to the accusation with the same degree of bravado and self-confidence as he used to.
He closely looked at, and was able to read what he was earlier given.
John looked and visually traced the chaining over Sherlock to a carefully put together explosive at the back of his head.
"Why should that be a problem? We have a case, and my shoulders acting up. There was nothing planned about this,and your brother can swim or stay in his mind palace in the hot tub for all I care"John retorted.
He soon saw the familiar face of John,still kissing into a mess of hair, using was that Sherlock's? Knocked lower stance to steady him between his legs,but still stay lower,so he was kissing upwards.
"Moriarty was over this it seems" Sherlock said quietly in a strained voice, looking past John's shoulder." he's done something to me. The perpetrator we were after last works under his orders. I don't know what they did, but they took steps to bring me back here to in his words,"be ugly to the eyes closest to me". Apparently my cell was put back in my coat. I was drugged for days it seems".
Then he had come back, and over time John recovered enough to try and get closer to his old, familiar habits.
" No sir! I can do well with the worst they can-" Gerald mentioned.
Well,am finishing up The Ying-yang Master: Dream of Eternity, and in it,many royals are dressed by many servants. A murder done by one that gains a jealousy would be too easy to do,and they would be able to hide small things where a brush or a nudge or so would result in what can look like an accidental death,so maybe I'm too busy seeing how to kill people. See what boredom and frustration does?
Oh yes,John thought,he now has sweat chill.
He didn't like to work on cases alone anymore, despite having done so at different times for a good part of his life. He sighed,this was arranged,not by the MET, but by proof he was not alone.
Sherlock smiled and leaned into John until they pulled up to 221. With one hand, John got his wallet out, gave the cabbie cash, and put his wallet back in his pocket. For once, telling the cabbie to keep the change as he nudged Sherlock out of the car. (While Sherlock kept a solid grip on his hand as he stepped out) Sherlock was nearly running upstairs, pulling John along as John dug for the keys.
"I meant to land! And then to find Mycroft's holiday house before the storm drowns everything!" John said, keeping his eyes closed and taking a few breaths to stay calm.
Lestrade dropped Sherlock and John back home,where they had talked about getting Rosie back from staying with Mrs. Hudson. What was collected will go to labs,which objectively show what there is to show, they will all see.
Sherlock looked towards John and mouthed 'keep talking' while his eyes were darting towards the guard.
Not his parents,not Mycroft (grabby as he always has been with control over Sherlock).
Sherlock figured out, even found stain remnants where blood had changed color and dried, instead of getting washed completely off.
After soaping up and washing his hair,John turned the water off when he was well rinsed. He dried off with a towel he wrapped around his waist, and stepped into the room.
She also made two teas from a pitcher,but with her back to him,he only saw her pour into two cups before turning around,serving it to both, getting her plate, and sitting on the other side of the table.
" What have you made sense of about the case,or" John looked around, waving his hand in front of the fireplace."this mess.....wait,that doesn't look like firewood" he said, staring at the wood pile.
Even if it's to fuss or complain, I love getting comments!
He set the legs by the stack of the old,dry firewood, and threw the seat in the fire. Disc part with bullet holes,leather and all.
Yes,balance is important,and learning to fight and react to an opponent fighting was often joked about in the military as being dance like. Learning details of an opponent directly.
A helicopter soon landed on the spot on the roof and the pilot waved them over without turning anything off.
"I'll just get this going a small bit, maybe if it warms up everyone can get some better sleep. Ice wads tearing the roof up and everything" John jokes.
Like many others,they looked to Sherlock's cold,hard logic and thought it would be a final saving grace to something they could not have planned for.
This was odd, but it blended in the shadows of the rocky uneven, ground here. This was certainly not London, but not a place that had much even ground anywhere. John tugged on the rope when they were both on the ground, and it was pulled up before the helicopter rose and was soon gone.
John looked Sherlock in the eyes,corners of his mouth perking,but keeping a calm face.
Back to, very short on time,but I don't want to miss out
Sherlock texted Mycroft and settled back on the couch by a very disgruntled John.
And then there was you
Sherlock's head lowered down to his templed hands before adding "Another thing Lestrade will see clearly when we get a signal . Oh,the pot of coffee is gone I see, but at least we have that luxury here"
Sherlock smiled."You would know,I saw you packed your swim trunks before we left,so I grabbed a pair as well"
"Your evening wear is on your bed,hurry up and get out of your smelly work clothes,thier waiting for us!"
It was unfolded in an open area by the stove, then John simply unzipped his jacket and spread it out on the back of the chair before turning to face it more towards the stove. His shirt was dry, except for being sweat soaked through, so he laid it out behind the chair in the floor.
"Yes,the hotel is pretty full right now,but to not lose any possible customers this soon after opening, when you leave,they will be marketing the room as where Sherlock Holmes had slept. Hope you don't mind" Lestrade said, nodding with a quiet amusement.
"Not quite" Sherlock said, popping the last nite of his cupcake in his mouth. He quickly swallowed, and John had long given up on making him eat slower after a case. He seemed to inhale food at times, but he simply kept an eye on him for the signs of choking that never showed up.
He held the medics arm and leaned outwards, looking at John talking to the investigators and keeping the doors from closing.
"Wise choice" the waiter said,typing that into his tablet.
Sherlock started watching the flames from his eyes.
"Fresher? You are just as bad as he is over there with boss. Here's the bag of sample bottles, feel free to get what you want" Anderson shoved the sample bag in John's hands and walked towards Donavon, right as Sherlock walked by him headed towards the scene.
John was able to pull the shirt over his head and along his arms without affecting the bandaging he had made in a hurry earlier. It had seemed to hold,and there were no further signs of bleeding.
"I've stayed out of here,so you can have your sleep and I won't bother you with my coffee making,pacing or thought processing, but if this case is triggering your dreams-"
John looked at Sherlock,gave a few parting details,then ran to him as medics had arms on each of Sherlock's shoulders and pulled him back on the cot.
I know the end is not romantic. It's not meant to be, but it is a show of comfort after having the boys go through this mess. Harm wasn't done,but neither are dumb or that emotionally tone deaf, even when such is wanted
John hefted both bags and carefully carried them down. He was certainly not in a position to skip down like Sherlock had, and as usual the bastard was likely able to pull it off with grace AND speed.
Sherlock kissed him while slipping something small in his hand.
He had made it up the front steps because he had John supporting him,so even that would be out.
John had left earlier in a Doctors uniform and bags. He had work that could not be put off. The now toddler,was being kept elsewhere, and away from all that was in the living room.
The soft, wider lighting of John's lantern was able to get closer to something that sparkled, but didn't move with the water reflecting the lightning flashes.
He looked at the TV,then looked around for any headphones. He could not find a pair of those,or any place around the TV frame to plug them in at.
" I won't insult the salt like one that stabilizes me in some of my moods" Sherlock said,taking a sip from his cup. "Different salts are named from the acids and bases that composes then, hence,more stable ph balances"
He then took off his shoe and tied the laces to the spots on the sides on and near the pin on the explosive.
" Would you like some tea? We can talk this out and I'll see where I can help you once I get out of these work clothes."
John swam until his shoulder relaxed and old memories of waterboarding and other tortures were chased away. Sherlock had stayed in the hot tub going over facts of the case until John stretched,walked over and got in the hot tub as well.
The hotel door buzzed as Sherlock paced around the room, working on his fifth cup of coffee.
"Could you hold these right here John? Don't let anything fall"
The chicken and rice was quickly taken care of before a well dressed couple sat at one of the tables. They looked around,and soon waved Sherlock over.
Digging through a few computer drawers and even quickly within computer cases Sherlock found a few flash drives, a few card drives and he held them close to his lantern. Several he kept, one he hesitantly kept, and two he tossed aside.
She stood up and waved at a chair on the other side of the table. She looked so young and thin,he knew he would have to ask and knew women didn't like talking about thier ages.
"I'll have to take you off this case Anderson" Lestrade said sternly, stepping towards him. " If any of this could be true,then you can't be allowed on the field unless perhaps,you can show yourself to be valuable enough to be brought along with someone who can block whatever you may try. For now, there's many spreadsheets to be worked in the office". Dimmock marched Anderson to be put in the back of the investigation can,hands kept up and kept in sight.
Early on, those who tried to keep him dependant on something they sold,so they could take it away when they wanted.
"I'll almost give you a week to stop what you're doing John *sigh*,but when you're done, do you know what all that can be used for, aside from the rubbing I would never turn down?"
"You still beat yourself up over the wrong things. Come here by the fire and sit here" John said, tapping his foot."I'll be out of the kitchen soon" he said before he headed that way.
" I'm sorry John,this is not enough"Sherlock said,after finishing another plate.
"I am Sherlock Holmes. Mr. Holmes sounds too much like you are seeking my brother" Sherlock said, before turning his chair towards the couch and sitting down.
Oh yes,more repeat edits,but hopefully I've done this somewhat justice.
"It's common explanation that you can dig your own grave or be promoted beyond your competence,but the facts still point to truth" Sherlock said,then mumbled to himself"whoever taught you mage magic did so very badly"
Hate leaving teases,but when I got home I was interrupted,told to put the phone away and watch something,ECT. every few minutes! but I need to crash for my next escape to writing alone with lots of coffee tomorrow...then the round of re edits will begin.
If more people had not tried to drive on the road with the ever changing, horrible weather,John would have not been asked to camp out at, and keep working most of a week at the hospital.
"Of course I had to make do, we couldn't sneak a bed down here, we set up a frame of lighting and "Moriarty walked closer to where Sherlock was  standing/held up and turned his head to look him in the eyes." Having you chained to the wall and at my mercy does have it's appeal,but" he stepped back.
" One question at a time" Moriarty purred, " I know why he keeps you around! I made this more of a challenge, and you still went right about where he is! Now soon you both will learn to overlook anything I do and leave me to my games. Otherwise,you will find yourself in one".
Sherlock got up and followed him in the kitchen. " You still intrigue me. You can be so caring, but still show signs of something else entirely within you"
A piece of mushroom caught in his throat and he caughed before taking a sip of his tea.
This turned out to have a lot of darkness,but neither of the boys is so much as scratched too much at the end
Ok, that's long enough,so I'll end it here before I get back home and add another chapter to this set of adventures that isn't even properly started yet. Things will get fun and antsy soon.
"Why are you he---- what brings you here?" Sherlock said, flinching because he forgot the manners John's been so insistent on.
"What 'game' is it now?" John grabbed a smiling Moriarty's shirt and pushed him backwards.
He read thier order off to them,gave a total, and was soon off to the kitchen.
Ok, I read long ago a story made from the P.O.V of different inanimate things found in 221B. No idea where it is now, but this is inspired by that,and with joining in the Febuary prompt list late,might as well do the first I missed last
"I didn't like that snakes were chased away,that isn't always needed. That's why you had to be pinned to the table thoroughly. I didn't need any more of the worst dates around chasing you off and making you sad, Again" Sherlock then looked at John and took his own sip of coffee.
"Please give me any details you have, things may get interesting soon" said Sherlock.
"That would be nice John,do we still have sugars"?
"Well, if any of them did thier actual jobs correctly,we would not be seen too soon" Sherlock said,then looked at Lestrade. "Did they mention which room?"
"Don't come after me in a mess if you're going to leave so much open. Actually, do as you normally do,and don't come after me until I come after you"
They haven't been able to get back there yet, because of the crime that seems to only get worse with the growing population,and the popularity of London.
He was happy a case finally showed up. So far after the holidays,the rest of winter had pretty much everyone staying home and not doing much with the built up snow.
Well, there's a bed,our boys, and exaustion,so what next?*grins*
'He's stressed out and maybe needing clarity on several things. Just what I thought,he needs to be shown directly.'John thought, starting to pull on the belstaff.
There was also word of odd findings,that had to have been smuggled out of high end parts of China, Korea, and other heavily guarded and limited places. They were found in odd places,such as appearing in a pawn shop, showing up in a yard of a well to do duchess, and so on. They were found with small notes signed with a kiss mark,and teasings about getting around. This seemed to fit right in with this case, because it was suspected to be from the same person.
Sherlock set what he had down on the table and stepped over it, walking towards John and wrapping him in an all consuming hug, holding him close.
Crouched down, he lightly shook John awake.
That was a short, but many years later still felt like too long of an ordeal for John to put his family through. He got to the second door at the end of the stairs, and let himself in that as well.
John had taken his small knife, carefully put it through the seam work along the inside of the leg ankle, and let it slowly move upwards, cutting seams until the knife was close to Sherlock's groin. He then repeated the action with the other leg, leaving a narrow patch to cover between Sherlock's legs.
Sherlock ran his fingers through grey/blonde strands.
He was drugged. The pasta was delicious,but the tea was bitter. Another mushroom based dish!
He let enough panic and worry through to start the adrenaline. Even with it going through him and the rush of fight/run going through his nerves,he got up slowly and walked up, and out into the rain. Being drugged to be slowed,and being able to channel adrenaline was an unsettling mix, but Sherlock only did as necessary to keep control and stay balanced.
" No need to get worked up. I found a smaller model that was injected,but it still needs time to adjust. I have a dose with inhibitors I could inject you with if you want to be back to yourself for a few hours, But!" And he stood up and put a finger over Sherlock's lips. "No more than that! You will still have your mind of course, but the bridges you have made over the past few years? Well, I will leave that for you to destroy yourself. Then I will have my own fun and my dear terms it will not be hard for you to consent to for me"
Art made by chained-to-the-mirror !
Sherlock grabbed his hair, then stood straighter with his hands in front of his face, thumbs tucked under his chin.
"What are you doing?!"Sherlock asked, exasperated.
John pulled Sherlock upstairs to his old room. Sherlock smiled,so John was planning on something loud? Something he wanted to start in a pristine area, with no plans on keeping it that way?
Well, predictions had not turned out to be correct, like Sherlock had mentioned. John thought it best to let him sleep, see if there was coffee to go along with having a coffee maker in the kitchen, and see what can be done with what was in the pantry.
It didn't take long. The samples were put inside an insulated box, and Sherlock's arm was grabbed as Mycroft tried to pull him towards his car.
What all is found, and what still awaits?
John smirked at Sherlock as he rolled his eyes and shrugged.
Still hoping I don't mess up horribly and lose more readers along the way
Soon,a light green film showed up around the scene, and a light blue path of footsteps led from the edge of the rooftop the scebe was back to the victim.
"We've had a series of power outs,off and on,and in different parts of London, leading here actually. A note was left on my desk with this address and talked of you. Said it was from an old comrade,but then gives a series of threats?" Gary said.
"WHAT?!" John yelled in frustration before getting his head back in his hands.
More art from chained-to-the-mirror!
John looked around. He was some place he had seen before, but was unfamiliar. There was no one else around but-
If he could just get under the pin held in place by a small string.
It still had 221B below it,but the building been blown up,torn down,rebuilt, redesigned and added to before another rebuild. That last one was only 200 years ago, but time flies when you stop staying dead.
"I think this will work for you John" Greg waved and walked them over to a bag. "This didn't quite work to fit Anderson,but I think it will fit you oddly enough." He said, pulling out an orangeish yellow Star Trek uniform before turning to Sherlock. "When I told other staff that I was bringing you in on this case,they gathered a collection and went to a high end costume shop to get you this" he said, before pulling out a long,blue uniform with something oddly shaped in the other hand.
Today and last night it had been fiercely windy. Now there was to be a warmer patch before another freeze set in the next few days.
"What can I get for you?" The waiter said with a smile," you can also tell me what you like,or any allergies you have,and I can make suggestions"
Even if I get hated for the steps I take with it,,,but details are important!
John walked closer to Sherlock as two escorts arrived at their flanks to walk them down the stairs and out.
After filling and sealing the tubes up himself,(I know where my veins are John,no need for you to chase them when I've known how to make them cooperate for years) and putting each one back in the holder they were all lined up on,John took it all to the refrigerator to preserve them until Mycroft got there.
While the man was cuffed and taken to an electric police cart (only until it was taken out of the airport and to the police car by the sidewalk),John was seeing to the child.
"This is not a waltz,so yes, better to let me lead this dance for a while" John said with a smile.
He tried to move, but then heard a familiar voice.
John felt oddly at a complete peace doing something completely outside of what he thought could ever make him happy. Not just something different. This wasn't a childish expirement or a dare, but finding beauty where he least expected it. Sherlock's mind was layered and beyond what most could....he grabbed Sherlock's hips tighter and his own body moved with barely his own mind there to actively guide it. It was something that he only found odd later and laughed about it, but his mind was only distantly there. Because all of him was there and focused on the present.
" The cleaners just finished,and while everything is set to keep an eye on my brother,I have elsewhere to be. Feel free to do as you two wish while you're 'just swimming'" Mycroft said as he turned and left on the elevator.
They both scarfed through the Thai John had ordered,and crashed in thier own beds.
The first pic by asleepatlast inspired all of the cuddling scenes written here, and the final pic is done by chained-to-the-mirror!
That only solidified what was left to do.
He bent down to start kissing John. He preferred it when his pupils were changed from another type of concentration that should be remidied right away...
"That was quick,is it a case?" John asked
John walked inside 221B .A long, hectic night shift was sprung on him when the Doctor that usually worked Monday nights in that part of the hospital was sent home. This was after being treated for a broken ankle.
"Well, not everyone has seen what we have, lived through what we have, or" and John walked over and planted a kiss on Sherlock's lips before handing him his cup and going to sit in his own chair with his cup" has a mind that could even keep up with yours. Some of my patients I would like to knock out. Some try to hide or make allowances for the ones that keep putting them in there" John sipped and continued " many parents try to forget that thier children are made to be quite durable and not everything is an emergency. Worries only come from some that never seem to notice a thing when there IS an emergency with thier child"John said, laying back and rolling his eyes.
“So,” John whispered, shifting slightly against his bed. Now that he was here, he could feel tiredness seeping into his bones. He yawned and moved to climb into bed, snuggling within the covers but still watching Sherlock. “What do we do from here?” He asked.
Warning for some violence, not to Rosie, but I must note that she's not well. I don't know how else to warn you all about this chapter. It's a little dark.
Mycroft nodded once and left the property. Sherlock saw John relax a little more and returned to his chair. Sherlock followed, sitting in his own as if on auto pilot.
“She's gone Sherlock.” John whispered and clung to Sherlock. “They stitched her eyes shut, named her the blind banker and left her body to rot in her flat.” John's shoulders shook as he cried and Sherlock held on tightly.
“Yes. She's three weeks old now, but she shouldn't have been born for another five weeks at the most.” John reached over and stroked the little blonde hair, hardly visible but definitely blonde.
“Fine. But let me tell you this, next time Sally Donovan, you fucking call first.” John was angry.
It had been almost five hours, thirty seven minuets and twenty nine seconds. Not that Sherlock was counting anyway. He was sat up in his hospital bed, holding on to a sleeping Rosie and watching her facial expressions as she dreamed. A blank slate, just ready to be written on with everything that makes her, her. And her father was not around right now to see the little twitches she makes as she snores lightly. The curl of the fingers as she dreams. He would never in his lifetime understand it.
“Bugging the place Jim, really?” Sherlock replied. How the hell that man can be so calm annoyed John to no end. “Now, I ask again. What do you want?”
Sherlock snarled and walked faster, making his way towards the interview rooms. “No.” Was all he said before trying every door he came across. The third door he opened held the chief inspector, and beyond the glass was Donovan, yelling at John. Sherlock noticed straight away John was having a PTSD episode and he stormed out, ignoring shouts from the Chief, glad that Lestrade had held the man back.
“You're wanting to run a check on any close family members? You think they're seeking revenge?” Sherlock asked and Lestrade shrugged.
I must point out that there is some small mentions of child abuse in this chapter. Very small, but it's there so I've updated the tags as well.
Molly gasped and held Rosie a little closer, protective instinct. She'd make a good mother one day. The deduction flew through Sherlock's mind without warning, just before his initial one took hold, his hands grasping the sheets tightly.
WARNING, WARNING, WARNING - Torture!!
John nodded once and looked around the room. It was spacious, a child's cot by the window, a rocking chair close by and monitors if needed. Very clean, very respectable and way above John's pay grade. “Does Mycroft have an abundance of private rooms for any and all occasions?” He asked as a joke and turned to Anthea. She winked, but said nothing as she left the room. John shook his head and sighed, placing Rosie in the cot bed gently. He placed a hand to her head and frowned at the temperature. He placed his other hand against her chest lightly, making sure her breathing was clear. It was. But still, something wasn't right.
Sherlock refused to look at John, instead he chose to watch Rosie intently as he lay her in his arm, using his now free hand to feed her the bottle. He watched her and he watched her, silently promising never to let anyone or anything hurt her. Ever.
“Just so.” Jim sniggered. “So, how are ..”
"Sherlock!?" The nudge had came without warning and he blinked a number of different times, his phone held loosely in his hand as he gazed somewhat dumbly at John. His John, conductor of light. But he's frowning. Why is he frowning? "Are you alright?"
Sherlock's posture stiffened as John clung onto him. It was strange but John felt the anger vibrating through every inch of him. John suddenly became wide awake, pushing the thoughts of Mary aside, he'll deal with those later. Something was wrong, something to do with that damn phone. John removed himself from Sherlock and looked up at his best friend, he used one hand to wipe at his eyes and he composed himself, suddenly soldier ready.
John had made his tea and went to sit in his chair, resting the hot beverage against the arm and stared into the darkness. He was still moping about, his last relationship had not really worked out. Mary she was called. She was beautiful, always made John laugh, and she was there to hold his hand through the few months Sherlock had been gone. But as soon as he had returned after 6 months of being dead, John went back with him. Mary was not amused. An ultimatum was given and in John's defense, if she had loved him as much as she had proclaimed to, then she would not have made him choose. Right?
“Mycroft?” Sherlock was suddenly pale, his hands shaking as his eyes dropped to the envelope in his brother's hand.
“Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, she spoke of Jim being a little creepy. Her words. He would lash out, make people beg and plead for their stuff back. He'd take their dinner money of course, make them pay for his services. Even back then he was building a web. Vicky even said she believed he had the teachers in his back pockets too. The school was never the same when them two started.” John shivered and motioned to the two pictures of the two boys.
"And what is so wrong with that?" John intercepted, cradling his child in his arms. He must have retrieved her from up stairs, and made a bottle as he was holding towards her lips gently, coaxing her into drinking before looking back to Mycroft. "I honestly appreciate the help and the gifts Mycroft, but as Sherlock had said, we will manage. I'm ... I mean we," He looked down to Rosie, then to Sherlock for a second longer before staring back at Mycroft, "are here to stay. If we are wanted that is?" Again, back to Sherlock, and Sherlock couldn't help it. He grinned.
“Well, me and Mycroft are certain that Colonel Sebastian Moran is ...”
“What is it?” John asked carefully, waiting for the signal. But John noticed Sherlock wasn't staring at him, but glaring at the glass, his hand gripping the phone in a death grip. John reached for Sherlock's wrist gently, the one holding the phone, Sherlock didn't budge, instead released the phone to John. Now Sherlock stared at John as he read the message and felt his own anger flare. But on top of it all was a great and powerful fear. Nothing that he had ever felt before, and it almost brought him to his knees. It would have done if Sherlock hadn't grabbed a hold of him in time.
"What?" John can't believe his ears for a moment, which might be what gives him pause in his otherwise rapidly mounting anger. Sherlock is looking down again now, hiding his face, but John thinks he sees a glimpse of regret there. Guilt. If he does, it reflects his own. Sherlock chose not to call him when he needed help to stay clean because he didn’t want to spoil John’s mood? Because he didn’t want to interrupt John’s honeymoon? John wants to be angry at this too. He wants to bring up he and Mary's conversations over the previous months. How she would constantly remind him to make sure that Sherlock knew the wedding wouldn't change anything. How she would encourage him to take Sherlock out on a case, even going so far as to downright force him to find Sherlock a case if nothing obviously presented itself. How she would repeat to him over and over again the importance of reassuring Sherlock that it was still the good old days. And John had tried, he really had. He’d thought that Sherlock had understood. John wants to be angry that he hasn't, angry that he once again seems to underestimate and undermine the strength of their friendship.
He supposes that it should worry him, figures that he would be concerned if he wasn’t so out of it, registers this fact without really taking it in… and closes his eyes again.
“No, no, it’s alright. Really, I…”
“I want you to solve crimes if that’s what you want. I want you to
in his eyes in a way Sherlock hasn’t seen in so long it almost feels like a dream. A distant memory of a lifetime ago.
He doesn’t know what to say to Sherlock about it either and just ends up passing on her regards with no further comments or elaborations. Sherlock makes a non-descript sound at that, but there’s no telling what he’s thinking.
“Is that so?” Sherlock stared back, his heart beating that little bit faster the closer John got. Soon enough, there was hardly any space between them at all. John had to crane his neck slightly. Sherlock swallowed.
"Was any of us?" Sherlock laughed softly and moved towards the kitchen. He reached for two mugs and set the kettle to boil. "You know, there are a lot of experiments to conduct now we have a child in the house. Just think of all the fun .."
Sherlock followed in the cab, his hands flying over the keys as he sent a text to his brother,
Please, let me know what you think <3 x
“Liar!” Donovan threw the crime scene photos against the desk, right in John's view and he was lost. He saw Mary utterly beaten, her face bruised, her body cut and beaten, her could count the number of broken bones. She must have suffered so much. But the worse thing were her eyes. Her beautiful eyes, they were stitched closed, with perfect stitching. No wonder they though of John, giving his Doctor background.
Loud banging and a flurry of foot steps against the stairs had John straight out of bed and Sherlock reaching for a now screaming Rosie, the noise having woken her up with a jolt. John was standing in front of the two, his Sig in his hands after grabbing it from beneath his pillow and aimed it at the door, his heart hammering, adrenaline pumping and anger surging through his veins. It was just after midnight, his daughter terrified, whoever had the nerve to break into their home and bang about better have a damned good reason before a bullet went through their eyes.
“Tell me again how you came to this conclusion.” Sherlock demanded gently, not turning to look at John. He heard the smaller man move from his chair and come to stand beside him.
“What? How did you get here?” John asked, his body refusing to lie still, convulsions hitting him when he least expected it and he was beginning to sweat. Not good.
“Welcome Johnny boy.” Said the voice and John instantly recognised it from the phone call. John growled but said nothing. The feet came closer, a hand in his hair and Johns head was forced to look into deep blue eyes. He hissed in pain as his hair was pulled. “Don't you recognise me? Well of course you don't. You wouldn't even know me from Adam I suppose. But maybe you know of Charlotte Green?” John flinched at the name and his body stiffened. “Care to tell me about her?”
Sherlock stared at the two portrait photos that were now pinned to the wall of 221B Baker Street. Pinned around them were articles and crimes and even the petty little thefts. Everything that John had found he had pinned to the wall. There was a lot he discarded as pointless, which now lay burning in the fire place. He picked apart most of John's work, but not in a bad way. He couldn't. John had actually, possibly by complete accident, stumbled upon something outstanding. He will always be Sherlock's conductor of light, even if he was an idiot.
"Copycat killer," Sherlock muttered, finally coming out of his head. The room was bathed in a full light, John was in his chair, baby monitor on the table next to him. Rosie must be in bed, it was late into the evening now. "Has to be."
The case was a dead end, just as Sherlock knew it would be, but that didn't stop him from being agitated with everyone and everything. The dead female was a Jane Doe. The wedding ring was planted, the way she was dressed was just for show. Having to explain all this to the idiots that made Scotland Yard was very tedious. And Sherlock had ensured everyone knew of this.
John sighed, still refusing to look at his best friend as his own heart ached. “I'm not no. I don't know what I am. You love whoever it is you love, does it really matter what they look like? I thought you of all people hated labels?” John sighed. “If we don't go now, we'll be late.” And he left.
“Can you tell me of your whereabouts Tuesday evening?” Donovan asked as her reply, not looking at John, but looking through the folders in her hands.
"But John, just think of it." Sherlock pleaded. "She's like an empty slate."
“Put. Her. Down.” John growled. Jim laughed and Moran didn't move. So John aimed the gun and Jim and fired without looking. The hiss Jim gave and the flinch of Moran, John knew he reached his mark Grazing him just as he was meant to. “I said. Put. Her. Down. Or the next one goes between his eyes.” The silence was thick in the air, suddenly broken by distant sirens and Jim's moaning of pain.
Sorry about the delay, I've been getting battered by real life at the moment and I'm struggling to find the time to get a chapter posted. I will try but I'm not sure when the next one will be, but thank you for waiting and sticking with me :)
“Oh I see, and you're in a position to point a gun at a two week old baby?” John hissed. “Has anyone been in touch with my lawyer? I'm assuming I have that right at least?”
“We find Jim, and we stop him.” Sherlock whispered, the promise in his voice. “We'll stop him before he can rebuild.” Sherlock moved back to John's bed, sitting down on the edge once again. “After everything I had done in order to destroy what he had built, something tells me he's out for revenge. He'll make a mistake and we'll catch him, along with his second in command.”
His people were distributed, hospital staff were questioned, CCTV was confiscated, but still nothing. Rosie and her capture had vanished into thin air, so it would seem, and this is what made Mycroft so damned furious. No one gets passed him and his surveillance and lives to tell the tail.
WOW! I honestly cannot believe how many hits this has already, I'm honestly touched. I do hope you're enjoying this. If there's any errors that jump out let me know.
“Mycroft has men descending on Baker Street this very second,” Sherlock said to John. His voice was calm, how could he be so damn calm! But then again, one of them needed to be after all.
“An Army Doctor, invalid from Afghanistan due to a gunshot wound to the left shoulder, causing too much nerve damage for you to pass your physical. The limp that came with it was also a deterrent to accepting you back. The psych report mentioned anger out bursts, illusions, you reported friendly fire? You believed that someone within the British army attacked your unit because you were too close to confirming illegal activity?” Donovan continued, John remained silent, but his mind was beginning to drift elsewhere. He fought hard to remain in the present.
"Rosie." John answered without skipping a beat. "I was always hoping to have a child, always wanted a little girl by the name of Rosie, after my mother. God rest her soul. John whispered, not wanting to wake the now resting baby.
“It's addressed to you brother dear. I've had it scanned and it's not an explosive but a DVD. I have requested a television to be brought in, so that we can view it together. You won't be alone in this.” Mycroft said, his tone softening due to the look of pure fear on Sherlock's face.
“Maybe you should sleep. Rosie will be up in a few ..”
“Rambling John!” Sherlock hissed.
Very mild warning here.
Mycroft had scoffed, "you? You Sherlock? You are going to help Doctor Watson with his new born .."
“But you couldn't quite possibly bring forward the real culprit could you.” John continued, staring his death glare straight at Jim, his smile never wavering, his gaze never flickering. “Of course not. You would lose your right hand man. The real man behind the death of his sister. Or is that you? Not so keen on the suicide yourself? You must be so set apart from your brother then.”
Those months leading up to Sherlock's return, even the months following, while he was with Mary, there was something. Just something. Something he could never quite put his finger on. She had gained a little weight, but had always worn baggy clothing, refused to be naked around him and refused to change around him. But still, how could he have not realised!? Was he really that blind!? If he had known, he would have fought harder for their relationship, he would have tried to make it work. maybe that was why she had hid it so perfectly.
