interested.
John grinned, eyeing Sherlock’s behind hungrily, “Come along, Sherlock, time to get started.” John led Sherlock from his clinic and into another cab. Kneeling with the plug was almost uncomfortable but he slowly grew accustomed to the odd way it nudged him from the inside whenever they rounded a corner. They drove through the streets of London until they were close to its heart, “There we are, Baker Street. It used to be divided up into separate houses, but I’ve managed to buy them up one at a time and went through the bureaucratic process to remodel it back to its original singular form. I’ve kept a couple of tenants just for tax reasons, and they pay rent by looking after the place for me, so I don’t need a cook or a maid or anything like that, I need a pet.”
“I’m not…” Sherlock began to protest but the words died in his mouth as John’s worried expression made him think twice, “Fine, I agree that there’s a large chance that it won’t go well at first but John,” Sherlock moved, kissing his beloved friend tenderly, “It’s always been you, John Watson. If there is any person on this earth who can be with me like this, it is you and no one else.”
Distantly, he'd known this was a definite possibility, but now he had firm assurances.
Sherlock looked sharply at John. The soldier’s face was a blank, but Sherlock could still see the misery behind it. John was full of regret. It was blatantly apparent that John had feelings for Sherlock and didn’t have the faintest clue how to say so. Sherlock sighed internally and forced himself to say nothing because this was just more of the same. John had to get over whatever was holding him back on his own, he wasn’t going to try to help, not anymore. There was nothing to say at any rate. Sherlock was with Danny, for now, and John was with whomever he was currently shagging. Their old lives together were over, and it was new beginnings all around. “He is. We get on well. It’s…educational.”
that he loved him. He would explain that Sherlock was unique in this world and that John would be honoured to be allowed to remain by his side. John would spend the rest of his days making it up to Sherlock. Standing up, John made up his mind. He was going to go to Sherlock and
Sherlock’s body shuddered as his eyes grew dark, “Finally.” Sherlock climbed onto John’s lap and pushed against him until his back was against the mattress. It was fast, rough, messy, and thrilling. Sherlock made a mess with the lubricant, but John didn’t care because one finger at a time, he got to stretch Sherlock’s open. Sherlock kept fisting John’s cock, sometimes too roughly, but both men were too impatient to wait for gentleness or to even try to go slow. Sherlock made John hold his cock still as he sat upon it. They gasped together as Sherlock worked John’s cockhead in, the taller man groaning with some discomfort as he rushed through the beginning, “So long, been waiting so long. It’s everything I dreamed it would be.”
John couldn’t let that happen, “No!” he exclaimed loudly, “No, Sherlock. I’ll be fine. I’m fine. It’s all fine.”
Now John felt proud.
He didn’t need to say more because a much-sobered doctor now spoke with chagrin, “Sherlock, I apologise. You’re right. It’s none of my business, after all, I hardly call you when I’m going to…”
was perfectly happy to let it be.” It was Mary’s voice, but the sharp biting tones were so different than the chirpy positive woman he’d once lived with. She’d dropped her British accent as well, now sounding like one of the personalities on American weather stations. It shook John more than he expected.
“Come along, dear.”
you care for him, bloody hell, did you manage to forget what you were like when you thought he was dead? Don’t you remember any of that? Have you felt anything even remotely like that for your wife?” John shook his head and Harry snorted, “Idiot.”
“Don’t be. You have nothing to be sorry about. This is all my own fault.
A short while later, Sherlock was extracting a wiggling bundle of energy from the pram. Rosie was layered up in what was possibly far too many clothes, but Sherlock didn’t like taking chances with her. Still, she was happy enough to toddle away to play with frozen twigs and icy rocks, and bits of dead grass, chattering to herself happily as she rolled around and explored, wobbling back to give Sherlock handfuls of organic matter that he bagged and stored for later examination. He wasn’t worried about her socializing opportunities, all it took was a little bit of time, and collecting samples occupied her until the inevitable happened. Soon enough, other children came by and within thirty minutes, a conglomeration of adults and toddlers stood around and let time go by. Sherlock sat on a dry-ish bench to keep a close eye on his now distracted god-daughter. It was a bit crowded by now, all the benches full, so Sherlock wasn’t surprised to hear a deep voice ask, “Is this seat taken?”
?” John hung his head again and his sister made a disgusted sound, “Of course you didn’t, so listen here,
Mycroft voiced a warning in a gentle voice, “Have a care, brother. John is nearly lost to you. Don’t allow your frustrations lead him to believe that he is worthless. You know how insecure John is, he needs to be needed.”
We’re a wreck. Together we don’t even add up to one functional person, we’re a mess! How is that worth it?”
why he was there! He’s sick right now, he’s
John made a sound that was almost heartbroken, and he clutched at Sherlock’s arm, “I love you too, Sherlock, I’ve missed you so very much.”
“I think I love you,” John blurted out. He was stunned by his own choice of words. He’d never meant to confess his true feelings to his friend, but they’d tumbled out of his mouth without care. Sherlock was in a precarious social position as an omega living alone with an alpha. He trusted John to control his instinctive need to take and dominate the breeding half of their rare gender, most omega were bonded as soon as they became fertile. John didn’t want to be the alpha responsible for making his friend lose the place he’d carved out for himself as the world’s first and only omega consulting detective. He wasn’t some domesticated and housebound pet, Sherlock was entirely independent, and John respected him far too much to ever presume that his advances would ever be welcome.
faithful to him and had
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Everything is poisonous if you know what you’re doing, but to more specifically answer your concern, no, nothing will cause you harm.”
“I don’t mind, I rather like feeding you up. It looks good on you.” Neither man made further reference to the term
That handful of words made John go still, his mouth open and his face filled with stunned joy. Sherlock realized that his nightmare was comprised of all his hidden fears and weaknesses, his doubts, his uncertainty, and had been a reflection of how he’d always assumed love would impact him.
In his endless nightmares of grief, John had his friend’s blood on his hands as he keened out his desolation from his loss
Sherlock pulled his knees further apart, reaching back with his hands to spread himself wide. He used his middle finger to trace the edges of his hole and silently gasped at the shiver of pleasure he felt. It made him angry. He didn’t want to enjoy what John did to him, but it was no use, “Sensitive, isn’t it? Answer me.”
she hasn’t tossed him to the streets because he won’t stop raising his wrist.”
Sherlock felt a twinge of something.
“Sherlock, what the fuck is going on? I just saw John’s blog. Who is that woman?” The DI sounded as furious as Sherlock had ever heard him be.
things. That’s where your stuff ought to be.” John looked disconcerted, “Sherlock...”
love you but I’m never forgiving myself for putting you through hell.”
“Yes, sir.” Without further conversation, Anthea brought him back to Mycroft’s. Once there, Sherlock had a small bite to eat, a large glass of milk, and made himself ready for bed, though it was too early in the day. He wasn’t tired, but he knew the shock of the breakup had not yet worn off, and that he would be better equipped to deal with things if he allowed his transport to just rest. He missed John’s warmth, his softness, his steady presence. Sherlock’s bed was cold and empty, and he was lonely enough to bring his skull to bed with him, curling around it as he made himself drift off to sleep.
mentioned that he is spending face-to-face time with her, not ever. When I asked him how far things had gotten, he looked like he would rather swallow his own tongue than answer me, and the guilt couldn’t be clearer. He’s been having an affair. He has stated that I have no say in what he does with whom, that he could
“No, you don’t,” Mycroft said sharply. “I think you should just go.” Sherlock didn’t say anything. He was curled up into a tight ball and John saw his shoulders shaking as he wept further. John hated himself.
Harry was heartless as she immediately routed him. She didn’t give him a chance to sober up more or to sleep. That very evening, Harry forced John to begin boxing up all of Mary’s things, searching online for local charities herself and popping over to the local shop for extra boxes. Mary had been dead for months now, and even though he hadn’t loved her at the end, John still hadn’t cleared away her possessions, blankly choosing to live around them instead. Harry took charge of Rosie, getting started on the mountain of unwashed laundry that John had just been ignoring, checking in with his progress every few minutes to ensure that he did what he was supposed to do.
, and not a very good one. I’ll never be able to love you like I loved her because I would have to love you less, and by now I know for a fact that it’s impossible.”
Whatever he was trying to say was lost when Sherlock flung a long leg over John’s hips, settling himself directly on top of John’s prick, capturing it between their two bodies. Sherlock’s hips snapped and rolled, smearing his abundant lubricant up and down John’s shaft until it was drenched. Sherlock’s cheeks were red with arousal, his eyes wild, “Need you.”
John climbed into bed, and instantly Sherlock felt warm and safe. Pretending, he rolled over as if hard asleep and crowded John. Instead of pushing him away, John opened his arms, allowing the detective to curl up tight against his side, his head pillowed on John’s shoulder. “Yeah, I like that.” Sherlock felt a kiss being pressed to his forehead, “This is all I want, Sherlock,” John continued to whisper, believing that Sherlock was asleep, “I just want to make you feel good, to look after you. You’re the best part of me, and I’ll never forgive myself for hurting you. One day, I’m going to wait until you’re awake to say this but,” another kiss was pressed between Sherlock’s closed eyes, “I love you, you nutter. I’m going to spend all my days showing you. All I want out of life is to make you happy.”
. “You are
“He is. I do.” John took a deep breath before scrubbing his fingers over his eyes, now exhausted and blank feeling. “I’m just done in.” He had a weird craving to go find one of his regular pubs, just to enjoy the generous attention he always received and a stiff drink, but he couldn’t, not tonight, maybe never again.
“Or how you don’t seem to need to eat food on a regular basis,”
Who do you work for? Is this a setup?”
Closing his eyes, John let the blankness drag him under, his mouth turned down in a frown of pure sadness.
The captain seemed only mildly curious and there was no reason whatsoever to deny the truth. You didn’t lose your citizenship for a single transgression. Sherlock dimly recalled that the law had taken him far more times than even the most generous judge would be willing to forgive before he’d been stripped of his legal identity. His mind was fuzzy though, and while he knew that he had a lot of information stored in it, Sherlock had no desire to access any of it. He had enough to deal with right now. “Honestly? Neither, everything, anything. I just wanted the world to disappear.”
Sherlock had to force himself to his feet. John was nearly there, his hand was reaching out to help him, but Sherlock managed to flinch aside before they made contact, splattering his blood on John’s trouser leg by accident. John didn’t seem to notice, his focus was on Sherlock’s face, and the doctor looked so sad, so upset, but his voice was gentle, pleading, “Sherlock, don’t go. Please. Don’t leave.” John’s face was painted with concern and regret, but Sherlock was in too much pain to care. “
Sherlock lived in a dingy flat only a couple of blocks away. It was temporary. He was going to the USA in a few days to help a friend. Once he left, the chances of running into his one-time lover were nil. They hadn’t exchanged names and they didn’t seem likely to. The second they got through the door, the soldier bolted it shut, and made Sherlock get on his knees. Nothing got Sherlock started faster than being made to suck cock, and the soldier was perfect, using Sherlock’s bright curls to control him. By the time his thick fat cock was wet and hard, Sherlock was fully erect as well, and literally gasping to be fucked. The stranger’s cockhead was bulbous, the rim widely flared, unusually so, and it made Sherlock gag. He adored it and wanted it inside of him elsewhere as soon as possible.
Such a delicate questioning touch! No one ever touched Sherlock the way John did. He was so knowing, so gentle, so firm, so direct. Everything about John was earnest, honest, sincere, and dependable. Sherlock found that his mouth was watering and he had to swallow hard, incapable of answering.
John nearly lost consciousness from the force of the impact and the first thing he did was check for Sherlock. His omega was slumped over the steering wheel, momentarily stunned but already coming back. “John! Are you unharmed?”
“He did all that, why?”
“I have other thoughts, about other things, John Watson.” Sherlock’s gaze wandered downward. “I’ve lain in that very bed on so many nights, wanting to do so many things with you, to you.” He leaned forward and inhaled deeply, “Remember the first time you met Sally Donovan.”
you if you try to touch me! I need my alpha! BRING HIM TO ME RIGHT NOW!”
“Yes, John.” Sherlock wanted to assure John of his feelings in return, but it was too soon after the nightmare for him to be comfortable saying such things. “There’s more but I’m not ready yet.” Even if his mental state weren’t completely fragile right now, which it was, his body was a mess. He felt secure in the knowledge that John cared for him and would stay with Sherlock while he healed. John was someone he could utterly rely upon. When Sherlock was a bit more rested, he would be able to articulate the nightmare he’d lived in his mind, that way, if they somehow managed to move toward intimacy, John would know if Sherlock’s possible reluctance wasn’t because of him.
you can’t give David up, okay, you
. John was mad about that since the stranger wasn’t interested in bringing John home, and left him on Baker Street, drunk, horny, and full of rage. The guilt didn’t manifest until much later.
He gripped John’s hips tight and inched inward until he was fully buried. Unable to wait for more than a moment, Sherlock began to press and rock, pulling out more each time until he’d built up a fast sliding rhythm that made John grunt upon each re-entry. John was chanting his approval with huffed out repetitions of the word
“Couldn’t what?” Harry was frowning again, “I told you
“We underestimated the stress and damage done to Doctor Watson. You weren’t the only one to suffer. He doesn’t even know about Ms Morstan yet.”
. John put his child to bed and got himself ready to sleep.
John was the one holding Sherlock’s hand now, “I know we can be off our game with one another, but I don’t want to go, Sherlock. I know we make a right mess of things repeatedly but we’re getting better, I hope.” Sherlock smiled, his eyes a bit teary, but he was listening intently, “Sherlock, I love you. I want to be with you. I want you to be able to rely on me, to know that your trust in me is well-placed. Yeah, I could have done without some of the shite we dragged ourselves through but…better, yes, we’re getting better. I’m not so off my head anymore and you’re…well, a bit more perforated than you were before, but you’re still the same insane madman I fell in love with all those years ago.”
“Yes, it is. You’ll never trust me otherwise. I’m no good. I’m old and broken. I’m feckless and untrustworthy. I’m a slag and a brute. Every relationship I’ve ever had has taught me that I’m never going to be enough for someone. I’m not anywhere near your level, Sherlock. I can never stop loving you, but I’ll never deserve you.”
Sherlock shook his head. He didn’t want to say a word. Instead, he turned his face to the wall and tried to ignore both of them. John cleared his throat, “My sister, well, she’s a bit of a hot-head, and she didn’t understand what happened between us correctly, so she might have…well...”
very sorry, little brother.” Mycroft sounded sincere. Unspoken was
“You love me, and I love you, especially your little wee,” Sherlock yawned again and seemed to be falling asleep.
The doctor was named Douglas Coates, and he was plump, cheerful, and very competent. He reminded Sherlock of Mike Stamford if the good doctor went in for walrus moustaches and swoopy waxed hair. Doctor Coates looked like he’d been plucked out of an earlier era and stuffed into a slightly too small lab-coat. Sherlock liked him, “Well, lad, you're in a bit of pain, aren’t you? Good thing that cab was only going fast enough to rattle your cage a bit. Don’t worry, a tablet or two, and you’ll be right as rain. We’ll keep an eye on your bruises, and the swelling from the sprains should be mostly gone by as early as tomorrow. You came close to having a concussion, but apart from some passing wooziness, you’re all in one piece. There’s no real reason to keep you longer than tonight so let’s plan on a morning visit and see about letting you go home.”
“You had a
“Me too, Danny. I would like that very much.” Their smiles were fond and filled with affection but that was it. Sherlock was enjoying Danny very much, but his lover was right. Danny wasn’t John, and no matter how fragile their connexions were at this moment, Sherlock knew that he could never be entirely without his soldier, not forever. “I’m still going to help you with your case.”
“Untrue, Doctor Watson. Sherlock has responded positively to your presence dozens of times. If not for your constant vigil, my brother would have died almost immediately.
wasn’t at fault for what had happened and that the puzzles were as intriguing as ever. The only thing holding him back was John. He wasn’t sure he was willing to investigate solo as he once so carelessly had done. Years of experience had taught him that it was preferable to have someone guard your back, and no matter what else happened between them, there was no one he trusted his life with more than John Watson. The decision was made easier one night over dinner when, on his own, John asked Sherlock to take the latest client who had begged them for help. “I can’t skive off from work the way I used to, but I’m still very willing to help, that is, if you’d like my help.”
. His brother helped him to his feet and ignored the tears that would not stop falling. Sherlock’s sobs were silent, but they wracked his body with tremors that made his abdomen ache and his thighs tremble. Silently, Sherlock was tucked under the covers of the soft bed that waited for him, and for the first time in decades, Mycroft combed tender fingers through his brother’s curls until Sherlock’s eyes closed and he managed to fall asleep.
Mycroft sounded unusually gentle when he replied, “Sherlock has no alpha.”
. It would take some time to overcome his mental trauma, but if it meant having a proper relationship with John, a relationship he now recalled wanting desperately for years, then Sherlock swore to himself that he would do anything necessary to make it happen. First, he needed to heal. His body ached, and Sherlock found it strange to be grateful that he’d nearly been blown to bits by a bomb rather than hurt by the man beside him. “I’m so tired, John.”
“Well, no John, not exactly. I will be tied to you forever but not you to me. It’s a one-way bond. I will be yours forever, but you will have no reciprocal bond. You are human. It doesn’t work on you.”
It was infuriating.
“John.”
“Yeah, beautiful, my good boy, my pretty pet. Come inside me. I want to feel your pretty little cock fill me up.” John’s head was dropped back, sweat running down his neck as he moaned loudly, “So good, I needed this, yes, I needed this. Put your come in me, Sherlock, my lovely lad, my pretty little thing.” Sherlock couldn’t stop it. With an embarrassed grunt, he ejaculated deep inside of John, his orgasm intense with shame and bliss combined. He had never once had an orgasm with another person, but he couldn’t help himself now. John shouted just as his cock sprayed a jet of hot come all over Sherlock’s belly, “That’s it, oh fuck, that’s good, so good, fuck yes, fill my arse, so good!”
dream counterpart had been the aggressor. “I could never hurt you like that.” John looked like he wanted to curl up into himself and disappear.
“Indeed John, though I don’t think that trading kilts is something most male friends do.”
That didn’t give John much time to sleep. Another message followed immediately.
John just smiled and gave his name to the

, “Take me home.”
“Oh, you’re working with Mycroft.”
“I’m already yours, you fool, wake up, John, please wake up. I don’t want this to happen this way!”
Now, John staggered away from 221 B Baker Street in a complete daze. He couldn’t stop the continuous replay of how Sherlock had looked with Danny’s prick in his mouth, his body posed wantonly. He had been incredible, and it made John want to gouge his own eyes out. He couldn’t stop imagining what it would feel like to be his cock that Sherlock had been taking in, but it was Danny he’d had that first time with and not John. Grief tore at him as hard as self-recrimination. Sherlock had waited for him, had endured his wroth, had taken every handful of crap that had been flung at him, all because he loved John. John knew he was wrong on so many levels. He didn’t deserve Sherlock’s love. He deserved to watch the man he cared about be with someone else, just like he’d forced Sherlock to watch
John felt his eyes well up, ashamed of his tears but Sherlock simply wiped them away with his thumbs and kissed the tip of John’s nose, “Are you sure?” John needed to know, he needed Sherlock’s assurance more than he’d ever needed it before. “If we do this, I swear, on everything that matters I swear, Sherlock, I will never be anything but true to you. I’m sorry about before. I’m so...so...sorry.”
, John, you never should have mattered. Maybe I wouldn’t have been tortured if not for you. Maybe I wouldn’t have been force-bonded to a monster if not for you. Maybe I wouldn’t have torn myself in two when I killed him with my bare hands, not that you care, John. You never cared. You never wanted me. You always wanted someone else even though I gave and I GAVE and I GAAAVE…” Sherlock was screeching now, frothing at the mouth as his eyes dilated so much that they were nearly black. “GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!” He was shrieking shrilly but John couldn’t move, so stunned was he by the information he’d been given and by how thoroughly unravelled his once unshakeable friend had become.
“Better?” Sherlock combed the wet hair from Danny’s brow with his fingertips. When Danny nodded, Sherlock shut the water off, and together, they towelled off. Sherlock now knew that Danny’s body was hairier than his, that Danny’s uncut penis was long and thin like his, but that his cockhead was fat and flared, barely contained within its foreskin. Danny seemed to find Sherlock’s arse very attractive, patting it dry with his own towel before they dressed in pyjamas that Sherlock provided. Sherlock found a brand-new toothbrush in the cabinet, and silently thanked Mrs Hudson for her endless mothering. Once their teeth were clean, Danny yawned hugely before asking, “Can I sleep with you? I am just…soul weary.”
The room smelled heavily of ejaculate, so this wasn’t the first round, not by a long shot, and the scent was amplified by a fresh addition of genetic material, his orgasm heralded by Mary’s triumphant sigh as her lover filled her to overflowing.
Did Sherlock know? How could you, John?” Sarah looked completely scandalised, “How could you step out on your bond-mate?”
John fidgeted, “Sort of...yes, but...bloody hell, I’m making a mess of this, too.” John got down on one knee and took Sherlock’s hands between his, “William Sherlock Scott Holmes, would you do me the honour and privilege of allowing me to call myself your husband, to swear in front of anyone you wish that I will always be a true and faithful partner, and to allow me the chance to try and make you happy for the rest of our lives?”
Minutes flittered away at speed after that. It seemed as if mere moments had passed but John wasn’t in London. He was in Greenwich Village, in the Park, standing on one half of the heavy line that divided the world. He had eyes for only one person. Sherlock strode through the small crowd of friends and family that were attending, his gaze locked on John. Standing on the other side of the line, Sherlock took John’s hand and together they faced the serious-looking man in front of them. Words were spoken but all of John’s attention was on the man beside him. Sherlock looked solemn as he kissed the ring that shone on John’s finger, “John, this is our new beginning. We are starting a new life, in a new year, at a place where everything begins. We’ve come full circle, and I look forward to all the rest of our new beginnings.”
!” The workman shoved Sherlock to the side as his crew made their way down the street. All of them eyed the taller man with mean eyes, the heavy tools in their hands or over their shoulders all poised threateningly.
“The Green?” John chuckled sleepily, “Sounds very…organic.”
The case took ages. After allowing Sherlock to examine the body parts
They worked at the puzzle in silence for a long time before John asked if Sherlock wanted tea. When the detective nodded, John rubbed Sherlock’s shoulder on his way to the kettle, and then again before he sat down once more. Sherlock said nothing, and absolutely did not casually set his hand down right next to John’s while he leaned over the table to fit in two more pieces that he had found. Their table was small and most of it was taken up the puzzles or plates. It was mere convenience, not a desire to hold hands. Clearing his throat, Sherlock made himself focus on the pieces.
Sherlock relaxed, all his anxiety and confusion gone in an instant.
John was in love with Sherlock.
“Sherlock,” Lisa trilled, blindly happy as she swanned over, her hips wagging back and forth in gross exaggeration, “We finally have a chance to see each other face-to-face!” She was in front of him now, her lips puckered as she went for his cheek. Repulsed, Sherlock jerked back and nearly bashed Mycroft’s face with the back of his head. She tittered and stepped back, “Oops, I forgot, girls aren’t your area.”
Sherlock was smiling now, his eyes bright with tears still, but he looked softer, more content, “
. Sherlock was the one to lay a gentle hand on John now, his eyes filled with heat as he mouthed the words
Sherlock nearly fell to his knees, his unexpected orgasm taking all his strength with it as he heard John cry out his own pleasure, clearly thinking that the water and the bathroom fan would hide his noises. They didn’t. Sherlock managed to wobble his way back to his feet, grabbed some tissues to clean up his mess, and fell onto his half of the bed. He’d only just managed to get his breathing under control when the bathroom door opened, “Asleep already?” John’s voice was fond, “Silly bastard.” John’s words were affectionate, sated and content, “I knew you were tired.”
“Well, I said I would.”
. Sherlock understood entirely. Danny bit down on Sherlock’s shoulder to muffle himself as his hips snapped, grinding down hard and Sherlock gasped as he felt his lover throbbing deep inside his body. Danny shuddered several times, small spasms making his hips thrust deeply a few more times before he went limp. They stayed there, still connected, panting harshly until they’d finally caught their breaths and could move a bit. “That had to be one of the most satisfying fucks of my life.” Danny’s voice was rough and tired, “You really are a genius.”
“No,” John was shaking his head, “No, that’s not alright. That’s far from alright. This is not what I want in a marriage, Mary. I wanted you and me to be
There was only one thing to do so though it hurt wretchedly, he managed to make his voice work, though not very well, “Police! Someone? Help me, I was attacked. He’s here. He’s right here. He keeps hurting me.”
He felt drained, wiped out, and he was carrying an odd kind of stiff tenseness in his back. He knew he was constricted somehow but for some reason, he wasn’t worried about it, “Don’t move too fast, or at all if you can help it. You’ve been under for a very long time; your muscles are weak.”
John was completely stunned. He couldn’t speak at first and it wasn’t until Sherlock’s pleading gaze turned away in defeat that he broke free of his temporary paralysis and said, “Yes, god yes.” John reached out and pulled Sherlock close to him once more, “This is the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, a fantasy come true, well, sort of. I never once imagined you confessing yourself like this. If anything, I thought I would break down first, I did, I was. I was going to tell you somehow but I never managed. You’re far braver than I am.”
“What? No! That’s not what I meant at all!
John Watson loved Sherlock Holmes. He had admitted it to himself right after he’d thought Sherlock had died, and now, he wasn’t certain any longer about his reasons for concealing his feelings. Perhaps it was because it made his personal failings that much worse, that he’d done everything to Sherlock to exhaust his endless rage, even though he loved that frail genius, even though Sherlock was almost more important to John than his only child. Even thinking the comparison made him wince because he was also unsure who he loved more, and it tore him apart to know that he couldn’t even give his child his whole heart.
He stopped talking for a long time. John found himself reaching out and pulling Sherlock in for a rare hug. Sherlock was stiff and unresponsive for only a moment before his long arms wrapped around John’s torso and tightened like steel bands, “You know you can tell me anything, ask for anything, don’t you, Sherlock. I just want you to know that. Go on, say what you need to say.”
took you from everyone.
tell you because you are an ungrateful heartless selfish self-repressed prick. Yeah, I used to be off my tits on drugs, so
“Very much, John Watson.” John noticed that the Holmes brothers tended toward excessive formality whenever they were presented with emotionally charged situations. His instincts hadn’t been wrong then, Sherlock was definitely attracted to him and was accepting John’s subtle offer of more. He couldn’t rush this. Sherlock wasn’t very experienced, or experienced at all, was he? John wondered what he should try next.
John gasped when Sherlock’s hand reached between his thighs, his long musician’s fingers attempting to span the circumference of it and failing. It made the omega groan hungrily, and wriggle downward to mouth at the huge head. John gasped again at the sensation of Sherlock’s hungry eager mouth doing it’s best to get any part of John inside. No one tried, not ever. He was too big, and his previous lovers had all used their hands and never their mouths.  “It’s glorious, John, so big, so fucking huge.” Sherlock’s voice sounded shaky as if he could barely contain himself. “I’ll never have enough of this. This is mine, only for me. Only I will ever know what it is like to have you inside. Only I can handle the magnificent John Watson. You are mine and you are incredible.”
His surprised mental question was answered a moment later when the woman he thought he’d loved replied scathingly, “Jim blew his own brains out before the job was done. We’re never getting paid now until we can prove that both of them are dead. If Holmes hadn’t resurfaced, then everything would have just kept going. But no, you’re the one who wanted to close the contract so here we are.
“A beginning?”
She led them right upstairs. Sherlock felt faint and nauseated once again.
John began slowly, pressing and grinding, enjoying every uncontrolled clench and agonised wheeze he got out of Sherlock. “You’re going to feel me for
“I just knelt there.” Sherlock wasn’t unaffected by what they’d done together, and he didn’t regret it either. He felt relieved, content, and pleasantly weary. His heart had raced, his breathing had become laboured, and all it happened without a problem. Fleeting regrets that John wasn’t his first were just that, fleeting. He hadn’t been John’s first, after all, and if they did ever manage to become lovers, Sherlock wouldn’t even be within double digits of John’s first time at anything. It was what it was.
Sherlock stopped walking, his face serious as he carefully cupped John’s face in his hand, holding him as if the smaller man were made of the most delicate of materials, “Being away from me is killing you, my love. Your body is wasting away because your spirit is broken. I don’t want you to die. I don’t want to be cold and empty inside any more. I want my heart to come back to me where it belongs,” Sherlock bent down just enough to press a single chaste kiss onto John’s mouth, “I am only alive with you, my dear John. Be with me and let us both live again.”
. He was lying face down but supported

Both men were smiling at one another, their faces filled with love, commitment, and trust. They weren’t letting their history prevent them from having a future. Both men were dedicated to the task of bettering themselves in order to be a better partner to the person they had cleaved to, mind, heart, and soul.
room,” Danny was shaking his head, “I’m downstairs with Sherlock, your old room still has your crap in it anyway, Mrs Hudson would be over the moon to have Rosie close by, and
preferences. Sherlock couldn’t deduce more than that because he spent so little time face-to-face with John. It made sense though, considering what Sherlock had taken from him.
Sherlock retracted his hand and didn’t make the attempt a second time. John was mortified at his own reaction. When they reached 221 B Baker Street, John was wishing he hadn’t moved back so that he would have someplace to run and hide that wasn’t here. This wasn’t going to end well at all.
“No!” John protested.
Sherlock was the world’s most observant man but when it came to his own home, Sherlock seemed to be completely lost. He literally wouldn’t be able to find his own mobile if he set it down anywhere but the coffee table or the kitchen counter. John had to call him so that the great detective could deduce its location via the ringtone. Sherlock had no idea where the laundry hamper was; he put his laundry in a pile in the corner of his bedroom. He had been entirely surprised to learn that they had a linen closet, even after residing in the flat for months. It just didn’t register on his scales of important things to retain. Maybe the box would just get dusty as weeks and months drifted by.
“Certainly, sir, allow me to show you some potential fits.” The young man reminded John of Kiran, pulling out almost a dozen different lengths of fabric. John felt anxious, but the young man was sympathetic as well as gentle with him, “What colour is the outfit?”
“So I know the truth better than some, that’s one of the reasons I married you, Vi, for ne’er have our bloodlines ever come in contact.” He laughed heartily and Vi just shook her head, amused at her husband’s old jokes, “I am kidding with you, our John. The cousins aren’t inbred, not much, anyway. Still, new blood, what what.” He nudged John in the ribs.
The angle was uncomfortable, but Sherlock managed to press his mouth to John’s backside. It took a fair amount of effort, but he managed to slip the tip of his tongue in. John groaned. Sherlock used his hands to keep John spread wide and when it was possible, Sherlock began bobbing his head shallowly, letting his stiffened tongue push deep before pulling it back, “I think I want one of those long fingers in there. Wet one with spit, push it in slowly.”
“Irreverent but challenge accepted. You know I’m a scientist John, I will demand repeat performances of any sex act you wish to try, for the data.”
, I will have no choice but to use that bit of video I took at the celebration quiz night at the pub. You remember that one, Sally? You begged me to delete it, but I didn’t. I have a blog, and I’m not afraid to throw you right under the bus if that’s what you make me do.”
The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur. John didn’t recall anything he’d heard, hadn’t written a single note, and couldn’t even remember the names of the guest lecturers. There was a final dinner planned, and one more night in the hotel. John wasn’t sure he could endure it and began to mentally calculate the effort involved in leaving early. He’d need to rebook his train tickets, and he’d have to pay the room fee whether he stayed in it or not, it was far too late to cancel. It was also very late. He’d end up spending most of his time at the station waiting to leave. It just made no sense, but at the same time, being so close to someone who had once meant everything to him was hard to deal with.
best friend. You are capable of being a good person, John, remember that.”
There could only be one reason for his presence, “So, lecturing or attending?” They were standing in a hotel the was currently hosting an event centred around advances in forensic investigation.  Sherlock was still an in-demand commodity, or so John had read in the papers. In the last few years, the consultant also became known for his appearances at similar events, instructing new generations of detectives on the
Sherlock understood, he really did even though he missed his friend, and assured John that he was there to help in whatever way John deemed acceptable. The sting remained, however.
He thought about his relationship with Mary. Earlier today he had wanted to make a commitment to her. Before they’d met his life had been so empty. Even though he’d just seen the man, there was still a hole in John’s soul where Sherlock had once lived. Being with Mary wasn’t the best relationship he’d ever had, but at his age, he had doubted that he’d find better.
“What?” Danny sat up, his eyes going up and down Sherlock’s body hotly, “A virgin? How did I manage that, again?”
“You’re too arrogant to listen to anyone but yourself so I’m going to sit here for the next few hours and keep reminding you that you are a pathetic lowlife who needs to grow up and act like the man he used to be!
Sherlock tried to walk away but John wouldn’t let him go, “No. I begged Mrs Hudson to bring you here so you could understand everything. You don’t have all the details. Please, Sherlock, please. Let me explain what is going on!”
“I know you do, my darling man. Everything you did, everything you endured, all of it was because you loved me. I never doubted that for a moment. I am so sorry that I made it so that you doubted yourself, though. I’ll always regret that. I’m so so sorry, Sherlock.” John stepped forward, pressing their bodies together, “This was a case of both of us being stubborn, but mostly me also being stubborn
“I know, John.” Sherlock knew how long it had been since John had reason to enjoy the holidays. Christmas at the Holmes house had ended rather horribly. The Christmases before that had been filled with grief. The first Christmas here had been the best of the lot, and even that had been only modestly tolerable, ending with John losing his girlfriend and Sherlock miserable with jealous loneliness.
a tad complicated. He could
Sherlock felt an uncomfortable sensation in his mid-region. He had unintentionally made John feel awkward and possibly unhappy by not embracing his suggestion without hesitation. Sherlock quickly looked John over. The doctor wouldn’t meet Sherlock’s eyes and instead stared off into the distance, his hands already pulling the puzzle box cover back over the pieces, giving up before they even started. Sherlock blinked and realized that if John had been a child the last time he’d tried such an undertaking, perhaps it had been a happy memory he’d wanted to share with Sherlock and now felt silly about even attempting, “I’ve never done one, actually. I’ve only ever worked on crimes or chemistry.”
Not to be outdone Mycroft retorted, “I’ve looked you up…
“You have to go see him, he
“Suck my cock while I read. Do it slowly, play with me. I don’t want to come, I just want to enjoy your pretty mouth.” Sherlock climbed off the sofa and knelt on the thick carpeting in front of the sofa. John obligingly undid his own belt and flies, lifting his hips long enough for Sherlock to pull his trousers and pants completely off, “Don’t forget my bollocks, I like the way it feels when they get attention.”
“Good try, love. One bland mashed meal, coming up.” Sherlock grumbled a bit on principle but secretly thrilled at being openly referred to as John’s
“Indeed.” Sherlock was leaning back! They were touching now, boldly touching. John was almost laying on Sherlock’s shoulder, their hands palm to palm.
Sherlock felt his cheeks heat, “I wasn’t really thinking about what I was doing. I just did it.”
At first, John had been filled with a weird jealous anger. It wasn’t until he realized how large the shoes were that John realized that these weren’t shoes meant for a lady, they were meant for Sherlock.
John thought about it. Sherlock needed to eat more but he wasn’t going to go so far as to cook for them, yet it was just as easy to make three sandwiches at once as it was to make one, so he just did it, eating his immediately.
, and had to privately admit that his good soldier had worked wonders with the slow roasted root veg that he mixed together. It was gently flavourful, filling, and warm. Sherlock felt like dozing again as soon as they’d eaten, but instead of sending him to bed again, John spread a spare blanket out on the sofa and cuddled a non-resistant Sherlock while they watched truly appalling telly.
John began to lay out Sherlock’s light lunch, “I left it for Harry to use. Her battery won’t recharge.” Sherlock scrutinized him, examining the doctor’s face closely.
John felt his heart ripping open with agony. Those words hurt in a way he wasn’t prepared to deal with. John knew that in the past he’d chosen so many other things over Sherlock, and in so many unnecessary ways.
“Hmm, typical motor reflexes for a British male in his fourth decade, temperature only one degree above normal, an average rate of breath, heart-beat well within the normal range…John? John, do you know who I am? What do you see, John?”
John found himself being gently led to the bedroom by a sloe-eyed Sherlock. The man’s cock only seemed to be getting bigger, the lump in his pants poking obscenely outward with every step. When they arrived, Sherlock wasted no time stripping them both down to their skins before falling to his knees once more, “You don’t have to.”
With a hard look, Sherlock scowled at the short man in front of him, saying sharply, “Long enough that we are now living together. Danny just brought his things in today.” Graciously, Danny allowed Sherlock to also wrap an arm around him, “I’ll just be a minute, my darling, all right? I just need to get Rosie’s things and have a word with her father.”
Sherlock was frowning again, “You have developed an eating disorder. By my calculations, you’ve ingested barely 800 calories in the last three days. Why are you starving yourself?”
. Thanks to
Sherlock looked over everything carefully and a strange expression had grown on his face. His eyes were dark and sombre, “Why John? Why all of this?”
Sherlock had a great deal of money put away, even aside from the generous Trust, enough to retire on if he so chose, and he chose. He put out the word that he was no longer in business, and spent his days doing experiments. He still had a lot of questions about things and was interested in forensic sciences as much as he ever was, but the
Now Sarah was the one looking uncomfortable, her omega status obvious, and her memory of the heat they had shared still clear in her mind, “Be that as it may, John, everyone who knew you thought the same thing. We all thought you and Sherlock had pair-bonded but now you’re saying you didn’t, and that you were with someone else when he came back. Now you expect Sherlock to just
John’s answer was unhesitating, “Like I’m doing something worthwhile, like I matter to someone at last. You do such incredible things, Sherlock, but when you’re not, you let me look after you and spend time with you, and you don’t let anyone else, just me. I’m not special, not really, but you make me feel like I am.”
John wasn’t sure that he liked this idea.
John eventually got work at a different clinic, though his professional reputation had taken a serious hit due to the downward spiral into alcoholism that he’d so recently publicly undertaken. He was back in therapy as well, a mandatory requirement necessary to change the minds of potential employers regarding the doctor’s ability to deal with stress. It took some time before HR was grudgingly willing to admit that John was more than capable as a doctor and well-suited to dealing with the more traumatic cases that came in, leaving the routine check-ups and procedures to less experienced personnel, but he was on notice. His continued employment depended on his reliability, the first bit of trouble, and John would be out once more.
.” John felt like an idiot for not understanding a word she was staying but she kindly explained further, “The designer who created the shoe, and the name of the actual design.”
, detective.” Supplies forgotten, Sherlock stormed out of the store and took to the streets again. He checked with several old contacts and got himself going again. He wasn’t hiding from his network so his new number being spread from key person to key person until he’d firmly established contact with the entire web.
. Sherlock could physically feel the bonds of friendship that had once tied him to John wither and die between them, leaving him cold and anchorless.
“Actually, omega scent receptors are twice as sensitive as alphas, so he actually can smell it on you. Also, Sherlock seldom bothers to lie. He doesn’t care if he hurts people’s feelings.” John wasn’t even trying to hit David any longer. He was too busy fighting off Mary who had apparently lost her mind with rage. John fended off her swings easily, and each deflect made her angrier.
In slightly better cheer, John did as he was bid, hardly even noticing what he was eating as he mentally went over the possibilities his life could hold, “You know I’m going to bollocks this up, don’t you.”
“Ah.” Unperturbed, Kiran selected a number of items and held them up for John to look at. Taking pity on him, she selected three knee length ones -  one with a flirty hem and two others that would cling tightly to Sherlock’s legs. John thought for a second about the shoes and how long those aforementioned legs were and pointed to the more playful one. “Excellent choice, sir. She will be very happy.”
John blinked at the stream of unexpected messages and stumbled to his front door. When he opened it, he discovered Sherlock, arms laden with shopping bags, and a sheepish expression, “Sherlock?”
Sherlock made an important connection, and it rocked him
Sherlock had no choice but to follow along as well as he could. The leg-irons rasped at his naked ankles and by the time he got to the end of the auditorium, he knew they were rubbed raw. By the time they were in the parking garage and inside the cab that waited, Sherlock’s ankles were bleeding.
“Amusing, John, but worth considering. We’re at the airport now and we’ll be going dark, though not by choice. It’s very nearly Neolithic around here, no wireless. I’ll talk to you in a week. Don’t forget to give my message to Watson.”
When John came home he found Sherlock in the kitchen, his aubergine shirt tucked into his tightly fitted trousers, stirring a heavy-bottomed pot carefully, “Go on and have a wash, this will keep until you are done.” The doctor’s smile was genuinely delighted, though he didn’t say a word about the dramatically altered ambience of their home.
This woman had her reasons, but John had no right to get in the middle of a tumultuous relationship. He had his own shit to sort out and he needed to do it now. Calling the clinic, John explained that he couldn’t make it back for the afternoon. It was all paperwork, so after promising to use tomorrow’s day off to finish it, John rang off and went for a long soul-searching walk.
Guilt mixed with determination grew.
in a heartbeat, his voice soft but certain, “If you make it difficult for me to take Sherlock back home
what they talked about. He shamelessly read John’s texts and reviewed his blog posts hourly. So far, they had covered nearly every single case John had ever posted. Her texted cooing and praises made him physically ill with their saccharine inanity. Her name was Lisa, pronounced
Sherlock had never had to deal with a maelstrom of positive feelings before. He didn’t do feelings, or emotions, or relationships, but here he was standing on the cusp of a whole new lifestyle that would potentially involve lots of all those things! “You’re sure?”
Sherlock stood and glared down at John who wasn’t making any effort to meet his angry gaze, “I suppose it’s my fault somehow? I caused this to happen
Having heard the treatment that Sherlock’s subconscious had exposed as his deepest fear, John Watson seemed more determined than ever to prove to Sherlock how devoted and gentle he could be, if given a chance. The flinches became more infrequent until they finally stopped entirely. While it was incredible to have his every need lovingly catered to by John, Sherlock was similarly desirous of an opportunity to prove his more-than-amiable feelings for his good doctor.
“I know, I’m complete trash.” John looked down at the floor. He felt so helpless, he’d made all of those idiotic choices on his own and now he would have to live with the consequences forever. “Sherlock, all I can do is begin again right now, right this instant. I love you. I will be here for you for the rest of my days. I’ll do anything you want, any way you want, for as long as you want. My life is entirely within your control. There will never be anyone else for me, not ever, not even if I never get to see you again. I love you, Sherlock, and you will always be my omega whether we can bond or not, the person I care about more than anyone, the person I will go to any length for, and the person I would rather die over than be without again.”
of John, and despite his social short-comings, Sherlock bolstered his odds by applying his many skills to calculate the path to successfully obtaining his goal of
The blond man looked startled, then to Sherlock’s bemusement, his cheeks coloured. “My name is John Watson, I used to be a captain in the army, but I’m discharged now. Call me John.”
He woke a short time later with John spooned to his back, “That was glorious, my pet. You are doing so well.” John took Sherlock to the shower where he washed his slave all over before getting Sherlock to do the same to him. Sherlock hated himself for giving in so easily, ashamed that his transport was so easily subverted by experienced physical manipulation. When they got out, Sherlock received another brand-new set of pyjamas, now accompanied by a long dark blue silk robe and a pair of heavy-soled and comfortable slippers. Dressed casually, John led Sherlock to the dining room where another elderly lady was helping Mrs Hudson serve an elaborate dinner, “Ladies.” John dismissed them as soon as they were done, “Sit, Sherlock. Have a bit of roast.”
Sherlock looked sheepish once again, “I couldn’t decide what to get. It’s been so long, and I can’t say with certainty where your tastes might have changed.” He looked down at the sizeable pile, “I admit, I have been excessive. I wanted to tempt your appetite. I know you have problems with food.”
John fetched a basin, some scent neutralising soap, and a soft flannel, giving Sherlock a gentle sponge bath, dabbing his delicate skin until he was clean, obliterating their combined scent regretfully. Utilizing all the skills he’d gained while doing medical work for the military, John managed to change the sheets, despite the fact that his omega was still completely insensate. It would be hours before Sherlock was able to be roused from his much-needed slumber. He looked peaceful and at ease for the first time, and John could not stop running the warm damp flannel over his body.
John didn’t seem to have a problem with the taste, or indeed, anything that had just transpired. He pulled Sherlock to his feet the second his trousers were back in place and kissed him deeply, almost hungrily searching for any trace of semen on his new lover's face. When the afterglow faded a bit, John was grinning hugely, “You’re amazing. I was not expecting anything of the kind.”
Sherlock went to the kitchen bare arsed and uncaring. The plug had a wide base, so he sat it on one of the wooden kitchen chairs, slicked it with even more lube, and then sat down on it. With a pained groan and a shocked gasp, he allowed gravity to force his body downward, the large toy making a sucking sliding sound as it settled into place. Sherlock had to sit and breath for several minutes before the pain ebbed away enough for him to dare stand up. The heavy plug pulled at muscles he’d never been aware of and it made walking a whole new experience.
“So am I.” John replied instantly.
, John. When you go out with Lestrade or Hooper, you just tell me. You don’t make secret assignations with them and then never mention it to me. How often have you seen this woman? How far has it gotten already? Have you had sex yet?”
John seemed to know just what to do to soothe him. Using his right hand, John reached around to grasp Sherlock’s cock, smearing the pre-cum that wet the head along his shaft until he was slick enough to stroke. Sherlock felt his whole body respond. This was what he’d wanted for so long and it felt incredible. Only John could do this to him, only John had the right. Sherlock groaned again and it triggered a reaction from John. Deep inside himself, Sherlock felt John swell and jerk right before he pulled almost completely out from Sherlock’s body. John pushed forward again and together they groaned. John did it again, only faster, and he kept doing it.
Use him any way you want, consequence free! Make him do your housework, or if you want a bit of fun, he can also service you in bed, you can practice your kinks without worrying about physical damage…”
. Of course, John called her
, in some way that other people could see and recognise.”
. Sherlock couldn’t help himself, he looked all around the room. The spaces where his things once lived were still empty, but possibly not for long because her fashionable coat was tossed over what used to be his chair. There were boxes stacked all over the living room. A rolling suitcase with a glittering charm fastened to one of the zippers was sitting beside the tallest stack.
“It’s a solar system puzzle. There are factoids built in so that you can learn about what’s around our planet. I thought it would be a bit of a laugh.” John shook his head, “It’s okay, Sherlock, it was a rubbish idea anyway.”
John felt Sherlock embrace him, the omega sobbing openly over his back. “John, please come back to me?”
“Cuddle?” John grinned again at Sherlock’s discomfiture. “I can’t think of anything I’d rather do. I’d love it in fact. Come here, love, as much as you want, whenever you want.” Sherlock moved right on in and was soon huddled against John’s slightly over-warm body, with John’s left arm draped over his narrow shoulders. John knew that Sherlock was touch-starved and promised himself to make up for the lack. His illness had opened a door he’d never thought to see through, and now, there were so many paths to explore. He couldn’t wait. Right now, John Watson was the happiest ill man in London, safe in bed with his husband-to-be, and in the dawning hours of a whole new life. “I love you, Biscuit.”
, and never mind that! How can you consider walking away from Sherlock Holmes? Even when we were dating it was clear that you and he had real chemistry between the two of you. Pull your head out of your arse and fix this.” Sarah stormed away, angry tears in her eyes, but still yelling at him as she marched off to her bedroom. She stomped back out, shaking her finger at him as she asked, “Also, people with children separate all the time, it’s not unheard of, unlike your ex-fiancée! If Mary was so important to you, why didn’t any of your friends know her? Answer
Sherlock didn’t want to. He felt like he was being trapped like a cage had sprung up around him unawares, and there was nowhere to go. Reluctantly, Sherlock opened the folded top of the box closest to him. It was filled with books, the covers of which seemed to match the wallpaper at 221 B Baker Street but with his profile picked out in a silhouette in the centre of each arrangement. In the middle was a large bold title picked out in rich gold lettering, ‘
strained, and they all avoided one another as much as possible. John was his only friend and
“Come on, love, a year isn’t so bad. It will give us time to really plan and save up for whatever you want.” Sherlock’s shoulders slumped in defeat and he stopped his energetic display of petulance to go stand by the man he was trying to cleave himself to, “Mycroft will need at least that long to secure a date, his invite is going to insist on a plus one.”
John wasn’t sure pointing things out was going to be a good idea, but he had to know for sure, “My cock, how tiny it is. You can’t want that, not really.”
“You were cheating on your wife when she was alive, wasn’t
Doubt filled him once more and he intensely disliked the feel of it. He forced out the words, wincing at the notes in his voice that betrayed his feelings to his brother, “
“It’s complicated,” Sherlock’s voice was cold, the unsubtle hint to just drop the line of inquiry as loud as a shout. “Don’t try to understand, Donovan, it’s none of your concern. John is here of his own free will. My brother can attest to that.”
“Why would I hate you?”
John’s heart hurt anew.
John would never hurt him, but his illogical fear wasn’t having any of it. His erection began to shrivel away, “It’s not a problem,” he said in a studiously offhand way, “Just a momentary urgency.”
“John.” Now Sherlock’s hands were roaming, and John felt warm, “My beautiful alpha, so strong, so perfect.” Sherlock’s words were melting the ice inside and John felt his body relax. Sherlock’s voice grew deeper, warmer, “Such a handsome clever alpha, so good to me, so good for me.  You are so strong, stronger than any alpha I have ever met. You never have to prove that you are strong or brave because you are strong and brave where others are only posing. You keep me safe when no other person on this earth is able to do so. You are kind, so kind, and it makes me feel humble that despite the fact that anyone at all would be deliriously happy to have you that you have decided to choose me. I’m difficult, rude, mean-spirited, callous, and yes, as Molly said, I am cruel. I need you, my John. I need you to keep me right. I need you to shine your light for me, to keep me from darkness, and when I fall into the abyss, I need your selfless heart to bring me back again. You are never weak, never broken, my beloved alpha. You are everything to me, everything I need you to be.”
Sherlock was astonished and more than a little humbled that this brave, broken, and relentless man held him in such high esteem. Sherlock wasn’t worthy of someone who was as pure inside as John Watson was. Sherlock was a junkie, a liar, a manipulator, a ripper of veils, a ravenous devourer of information. What few faults blackened John’s character could not hold a match to the gaping vortex of Sherlock’s soul. Somehow John negated that. He didn’t need to change Sherlock, they fitted one another naturally. Now that they were together, Sherlock could to rage and rail as he needed, all the while safely cocooned within the unbreakable embrace of John’s love.
Shivering with the cold, Sherlock rushed back to 221 B Baker Street and safety.
Sherlock allowed himself to be herded towards the kitchen table. John reheated his meal and presented him with his small cup of pills. Sherlock swallowed them down and chased it all with a sip of tea. He dutifully ate the meal John had made for him, appreciating that John had made the sandwich exactly the way he enjoyed and that the soup was freshly made and was filled with savoury goodness. When he was done he rose to leave but John stopped him, “Sherlock. I need to say something.” Sherlock paused, but then sat himself down again and looked up at John. The doctor seemed nervous, and even a little upset, but also determined. “I’ve said something awful out of anger and I can’t take it back. It’s out there, and I can’t change it, no matter how hard I wish that I could. All I want to say is this; maybe you are a freak, lots of people say it, mostly to be rude, but also because they’re a little right. You’re an aberration. You’re nothing like the rest of us, you’re unique, one of a kind.” John hesitated, “I know that all sounds terrible but consider this, you’re like the next stage of human evolution. You’re a freak because you’re so smart and so capable, and just so much
“Then the game is on, Watson.”
or was I having a really great dream?”
“How tall is your partner?”
“Kinda obvious,” Danny said, and Sherlock felt another kiss being pressed to his forehead, “Let’s sit down. I always want a good cuddle after an upset and I hardly ever get a chance to, so, come on.” Sherlock had never cuddled with anyone before, not even Janine. She’d sat on him, slept in his bed, and used his bath, but they’d never cuddled. He’d woken up tied to John on more than one occasion but being hauled away while enemies attempted to murder them couldn’t be classified as a
. Fine, no fancy breakfast but get up. I want to know what medical device you got.”
“What?”
John didn’t move for several seconds and for a moment, Sherlock thought that this might be the end of everything. Instead, he heard the distinctive sound of John spitting into his own hand and felt the doctor smear it around his shaft before pushing in again, “I can’t believe you did this, that you want this! I’m going to fuck you so hard.”
a professional private clinic that Mycroft chose with even more painful awkwardness as well as a high chance of having to put up with a lot of well-intentioned and sincere conversations about
Sherlock gave him the name of the street he was on but kept walking. There was a distinct lack of messages from John for the entire time. Mycroft had three homes in London; one that he lived in, one that his colleagues thought he lived in where he took important meetings, and a guesthouse for their parents when they came to Town. Sherlock a room in each of them, a space set aside permanently for him whenever he needed it.
Danny sighed and began explaining, “Mycroft is only helping because he knew a friend of mine, someone who died. It was murder.” Now John felt guilty for making their situation about himself.
“You can’t stop me,” Sherlock leaned right in, wasting no time at all, and licked a short, wet strip up the side of John’s still soft prick, “Delicious.” Sherlock slid his lips over John’s cock, allowing it to lay upon his tongue. With gentle suction and deliberate licks, Sherlock made John hard. Soon he was breathing raggedly as Sherlock lavished all his attention onto John’s small cock. The detective seemed to be in a trance, his eyes lidded and his lips red with friction. It felt amazing but it wasn’t quite enough to bring John over the edge, “I want more.”
“You’re a bloody natural, and we don’t need a reason if we both want it and we do. Proceed,” groaned John, “It’s brilliant.” Sherlock gripped John’s hips and responded to his wordless plea. He used his thumbs to hook under the waistband of John’s bottoms, sliding them downward, and John used one of his hands to yank the garment down until it was at his knees. Sherlock pulled his own bottoms down just enough to release his prick. The head of it was dark and jutted wetly out from his foreskin. Pre-ejaculate was in generous evidence, and following his instincts yet again, Sherlock used it to make himself slick before he went back to rubbing his shaft between John’s arse cheeks. He held onto John’s hip with one hand while he used the other to press his cock firmly against John’s backside, rubbing the wetness around John’s hole but never once trying to press in.
“Right.”
John felt guilty all over again
“No, not pathetic at all. Alex was…Alex was pure. It wasn’t just that he’d never had a lover. He had principles. He was good. He was talented in more ways than I ever had time to learn, but some things…for some things he was spectacularly ignorant.” Sherlock laughed as he heard John’s own words come from a different mouth, and nearly cried from the unexpected intensity of it. Danny sniffled, his eyes filling again, but he used a tissue to clean himself up and smiled damply up at Sherlock, “He was a lot like you, I think. Brainy. Beautiful. He studied or practiced all the time. I was the only person he made time for, the only one who made time for him. It wasn’t anything incredible. We hung around my shitty flat. We lay in my bed and just…talked. It was difficult for Alex to relax, at first. It scared him, intimacy, he never expected to want to have some. He didn’t know how to handle how it made him feel. His family was, well, let’s just say they were
Mycroft left, and Sherlock ordered John to follow him to their bedroom. The bed was still messy, so John tidied it up so that Sherlock could haul down their suitcases. He made John stand by the wardrobe to hold hangers while Sherlock carefully folded away a broad selection for both of them. He ordered John to check and load his handgun, so John did so with military precision. He always kept it cleaned and oiled, so it only took a few minutes before it was tucked into the new back holster that was threaded onto his belt so that the weapon was snug and secure, out of sight, but within easy reach. “There you are, my John, a proper soldier.” Sherlock fussed with John’s jumper, tugging it straight and making sure the collar of his shirt wasn’t crooked.
. It had led to an impassioned embrace that he could still feel. He was tender and almost sore, even more so now that he’d been almost violent in his ablutions. Sherlock thought that John stifling his sounds with his hand had been arousing and lovely, but now he questioned it like he was questioning everything
“So? What of it? She’s cheating on her wife instead of her husband. It feels pretty much the same from my end of things.” Sherlock didn’t want to know a single thing about Lisa or her shell of a marriage.
don’t have a problem.” He nudged Sherlock, “Don’t be thick, just say yes. He’s your best friend, you can’t have him living in the streets with a wee babbie, don’t be cruel for pride’s sake.”
“He looks like shit.” Lestrade’s concern had grown, “Why is he so…quiet?”
John couldn’t help but notice that Mycroft had dropped his honorific. It made him aware that he had agreed because he cared about Sherlock as a person, and not because he had medical skills to offer. “I won’t.” That promise was very easy to make. John had already set aside all the months he had been depressed and suicidal. The knowledge that he
had frightened the slaver with a single look; there was a story there, and with the clues now available, Sherlock knew that he was intrigued enough to pay complete attention to his master. “My name was Sherlock Holmes.”
Mary and Sherlock followed until they were all back on the street properly. The beta smiled at Sherlock whenever John looked their way but once, John saw her expression twist into one of mild distaste, her eyes hard and flat. Each time John had calmed down enough to try and ask a question, the first sound from Sherlock’s mouth made him see red with rage, his nose filled with that unexpected omega scent mixed with blood, and he would lash out physically once again. John shouted things out, demanding answers but never giving Sherlock time to answer. He was nearly incoherent with a combination of overwhelming relief mixed perfectly with rage.
“Yes, John.” The name was as boring as the man appeared, but Sherlock couldn’t shake the impression that it was all a mask.
A polite knock at the door made him suspicious, and cautiously, he answered. There were four people bearing several shopping bags, and one of them was Anthea. For once, she didn’t have a mobile in her hand, but she did step around John to lead her team into the flat where they filled the shelves in the kitchen with edibles, stuffed the fridge to capacity, and hauled up a large rolling cabinet filled with medical supplies including sexual aids. John went over the heat-reducers, pain relievers, ointments, bandages, and other sundries that he wanted on hand to combat any potential medical malady that did not require instant hospitalization. He sighed when he saw the emergency contraceptives, mixing them in with Sherlock’s thick health shake so that ingesting them wouldn’t upset the omega’s delicate constitution.
John remained silent while he worked the keys off his ring, setting them on the mantle rather than giving them directly to Sherlock. John kept looking at his feet and mumbled something about Rosie being at preschool for the day and that he’d been wondering what cases Sherlock was working on. Danny kept his eyes on John, his voice thick with incredulity. “Seriously, mate? From what I understand, you’ve been using Sherlock as free childcare for ages, that you don’t bother calling or texting to see if he’s okay unless you need him, you don’t even pay for storage of your shit upstairs… that’s got to go by the way… and that while you tell him you’re working when you drop your girl off, you’re actually going on dates? Now I’m here and suddenly you’re
Sherlock lay there, and felt awful physically, mentally, and emotionally. Half a year ago he’d never envisioned himself being caught up in such an unenviable position, and now he thought back to all the cases of spousal abuse he’d come across and finally understood how easy it was to be harmed by someone you loved. He was getting off lucky, considering.
Sherlock read all of Rosie’s favourites, making the faces and doing the voices as she smiled and watched intently. John wrestled her into her pyjamas and fought to get her under her blanket, his baby intent on being awake as long as she could see Sherlock. The detective gave her a stern look and shook his finger at her when she kicked her blanket off one more time, “This is the end of operational hours for today, Watson. Time to maintain your transport which, as we know, requires an adequate amount of sleep. It is now 8:30, well past your optimal bedtime. Don’t argue, we wouldn’t want to deviate from your ideal schedule. First eye. Second eye. Good.”
to call her by the name she’d falsely married him under, he had no legal way to explain anything unless he violated the
“You didn’t have a choice, I know that. You couldn’t let anyone know you were alive.” John argued.
John’s face turned red as he confessed, “Sherlock went into heat. He’d been bonded to someone else very briefly years ago, but his alpha died almost immediately, it disrupted Sherlock’s personal chemistry,
be better suited to you than anyone else, honestly John, how can you be so tremendously blind to this? You two were practically made for one another but you chose someone else instead!?”
“If you still want to, John. We’ll have to see how you feel. Sleep now, my brave soldier.” Sherlock’s hand carded through John’s damp hair, stroking it gently until John slipped into slumber, sleeping deeply as his fever finally broke.
to ignore the human suffering around him to focus on solving the greater puzzle.
than one might imagine. Sherlock had a brilliant imagination, but even he had to admit that he had vastly underestimated John’s endowments. It should have been frightening but all he felt was arousal and excitement. John had overwhelmed him, disrupting Sherlock’s ability to form coherent thought nearly perfectly. It was a rush like none he’d ever experienced, and Sherlock wanted it to last forever nearly as much as he wanted John to get on with it.
some alphas who were small enough to engage in all forms of sex with a beta, but John was not in that number. Instead, he and Mary relied on manual stimulation and intercrural sex, and many other delightful workarounds.
John felt better now that he’d put some effort into the flat. He made up a plate of finger-food that his baby enjoyed, and while he had everything out, John put together some sandwiches, wrapping them individually and storing them back in the fridge labelled with a note stating that they were there for anyone who was hungry.
John is moving forward with his plans and he receives assistance from an unexpected source.
For most of his life, John had enjoyed the rumours about his package, about how big it must be, how good it would feel, and how enviable it was. He loved the rumours because they distracted him from the truth. He looked at it and grimaced. His prick only needed to be held with two fingers, not because it was cold, but because there was practically nothing to it. It was John’s greatest failing and laughably, his biggest secret. At a minuscule 8 cm, it could barely be called a cock. He hated it.
He did.
John felt the horrible familiar and well-deserved sense of guilt now sauced with a sickening degree of possessive jealousy as Sherlock spoke, “I’m sorry I did that to you. You did nothing to deserve what I put you through. I have no excuse. There is no way to earn forgiveness.”
“Your intended?”
. It wasn’t a dirty little fuck in a toilet stall. That all ended even before Alex. I
John turned over on the sofa to look. He blinked. Sherlock was wearing a rather daring and festive ensemble. It was…interesting. The detective’s slim waist was being coaxed into a more hourglass configuration by a corset that was decorated to look like a piece of gingerbread, the seams all picked out with fat bands of white fabric icing. A large cherry coloured gumdrop was saucily set right in the centre of Sherlock’s chest, in line with where John presumed Sherlock’s nipples were, another over his friend’s navel, and the last one rather pointedly set over Sherlock’s groin. A puffy skirt in a matching shade did nothing at all to obscure the detective’s generous backside, and the puffy sleeves that adorned the upper portion of Sherlock’s otherwise bared arms looked like gingerbread edged with swirls of icing. A little tiara topped with a glittering ribbon bow twinkled in Sherlock’s curls, and to finish the look off, Sherlock’s lips were candy-cane red, as were the two small circles of red carefully painted on his cheeks.
Mary hadn’t had nearly the same effect on him and they both knew it now. John felt a bit guilty but at the same time he was a tad irritated with her lack of faith in him, and then he felt guilty all over again.
“Billy, I mean, Sherlock!” The old gent wrapped his long arms around his son and gave him an exuberant squeeze, “My how you’ve grown, my boy! You look a right proper adult now.”
Sherlock absolutely hated John. He could think of six different ways to murder John while he slept and cursed silently because he knew he wouldn’t try any of them. Once his master died, Sherlock would just be sold to a new owner. He would never be a citizen again. His genetic material had been registered under the
He hadn’t lifted a finger to defend himself. Sherlock had to find another alley, so he could throw up a second time, and blow his nose to temporarily clear it.
, just a particular someone.
Sherlock knew
Sherlock screeched to a halt at the vision that greeted him. John had clearly been impatient and was twisted around to finger himself, his arse glistening with the bit of saliva he’d clearly added, “Yeah, come on. I’ve never done this before but I’ve thought about it so much. I want you inside me, Sherlock, as soon as you can.”
as soon as she could to facilitate her return to the Society life she preferred. Papa was absent most of the time and when he was around, he seemed bemused by his children, unable to understand the torrent of questions and complaints that poured out because both boys knew they’d only have their father’s attention for a quarter of an hour at best before he disappeared for weeks of work yet again. Mycroft did his best to give Sherlock attention, but he was as crippled as his brother when it came to parsing out exactly how to show his feelings. Now, John was giving his best friend an experience in affection that Sherlock had always thought had been a fictional construct and not a potential reality.
Sherlock was going to vomit. Instead, he managed to keep his balance though his head was spinning and followed his ex-landlady into the flat where all happiness had died.
“I love you too.” John felt faint now and his cheeks hurt a bit from the amount of smiling that he was doing. They both stood there staring at one another, grinning. “I don’t know what to do now. I didn’t really plan this or anything.”
Now Sherlock was the one in distress and John laughed. This was a problem he could handle. John took another deep breath, then pulled out Sherlock’s state-of-the-art laptop and compelled the man to make a list of things his mother liked or enjoyed, then pared it down to items they might be able to procure on short notice. John then did a search of the immediate area to locate shops that might feasibly sell those items and organised a shopping trip.
“John, you can return to the kitchen, that is, unless you need to use the loo to relieve yourself. If that is the case, please do so in whatever manner is your normal method, and then meet me at the kitchen table. In your own time, no need to rush.” Sherlock seemed saddened to have to be so clear but John appreciated it. He did need the facilities, almost desperately now that he was allowed to think about it. He went there quickly and spent several minutes doing his business and then cleaning up. John checked the time, it was very early in the morning and that’s when he normally showered so that’s what he did. He shaved, too, and even went back to their now shared bedroom for fresh things to wear. When he found Sherlock in the kitchen, he saw the omega drooped over his microscope, an expression of desolation on his face. “Well done, John. You may sit.”
“I’m going to kick Mycroft’s flabby arse,” John promised darkly, “What’s he been going about while I was away? I knew I shouldn’t have left.” John set down his bags so that he could chase Mycroft down before he got to his car.
for this amazing gift <3
The blush on Sherlock’s cheek was startling to see. John was used to Sherlock being calculating and precise, but now he stood in front of John, almost wiggling like a puppy, his long toes drumming on the floor before Sherlock turned away and busied himself making notes on his laptop, but John wasn’t so unobservant as to not notice that Sherlock had to correct several entries, fumbling at the keyboard. Sherlock was flustered! John scented the air but he could sense no discomfort.
Donovan stood there still, “Forgive him, Sherlock. Work it out somehow. It’s worth it.” She looked sincere but there was nothing he wanted less than to agree with her about anything.
“I can sign
is featured, it’s nothing.” If Sherlock had a weak spot in his otherwise stunning collection of useful facts, it was that he was completely useless when it came to anything to do with pop culture. His idea of contemporary music was paced out in centuries, and nothing as mundane as a Top Ten pick. It amused John endlessly. “It’s one of those herbal ones from Mrs Hudson, doesn’t need sugar, the ones with the bears on the box. So?”
dating.
I misunderstand, brother mine?”
“You are involved in something large, much larger than yourself, and it has cost you. I understand that very well, unfortunately.”
Mary looked surly, ignoring her own nudity, and the fact that she had a lover completely exposed, his large cock shrinking fast as John glared at him. He had every right to beat David to death, and David knew it. The only thing stopping John was the fact that he’d also cheated on Mary. She didn’t know but that didn’t give John any moral high-ground. “It’s not like you’ve ever noticed.”
He grew bolder. Time after time he let himself grown closer and closer to orgasm, stroking himself as silently as he could, muffling his panting breaths with his free hand, and hoping that the noise of the shower obscured any soft grunts he couldn’t stifle. He was learning John’s rhythms and paces and was beginning to understand when the soldier wanted to drag things out or when he just wanted to get off as fast as possible. Sherlock learned to play with his bollocks, to finger himself a bit when he felt like a bit more stimulation and learned the many different ways he could touch himself for pleasure.
“No, you really aren’t.” Sherlock sounded sad, obviously seeing that John wasn’t being truthful. “Come to bed, my John, rest.” John turned around and climbed into bed, closing his eyes immediately. His entire body relaxed and went limp the moment Sherlock joined him, “I’m going to hold you, my John, though I should tell you that it will likely comfort me more than it does you. I apologise if I am violating your boundaries.”
6:15 am – I had coffee while I waited for you to wake. Going for a walk now. Text me. SH
The woman pulled off his cock and just arranged herself onto her back, “Extra hundred, love.” Spreading her legs, the prostitute just reached down and fingered her anus quickly, “No switching though! One or the other, but not both. You’re lucky I’m letting you change up now.”
Sherlock’s blush grew darker, and his eyes seemed to have trouble finding John’s face, “Mummy presumes. She knew I was trying to relocate you after our meeting earlier this year.”
, Watson! I’m leaving.” Sherlock elbowed John in the chest, hard, shoving him aside to yank the door open.
It made John feel a tiny bit angry that his astonishing friend had to hobble himself in so many ways.
“Yes, yes, it’s all new and fragile right now, and from the looks of things, Dr Watson has some psychological issues to pair with his psychosomatic presentations. Fascinating. He’s marvellously broken, my dear one, I see why you adore him so. Permission granted. You may wed whenever you can soonest organize a day, in fact,” without pause, Mummy Holmes twisted around and called into the house, “Mycie, Billy needs a marriage licence, call one of your people will you?”
, John, that's what I'm trying to explain. You
“How do I make you feel?” Sherlock was genuinely curious.
“Get out.” John was furious, “Don’t threaten us, don’t even try.” He glared until Donovan finally backed out of the room and left them alone. John deflated the second she was out of sight, “I’m so sorry, Sherlock. This entire mess is completely my fault. I ruined
“At least Mary and I have a relationship that’s real. She told me about you,
The floor was icy, and the hard boards hurt Sherlock’s flayed back but he remained where he was until John bent over and ran a soothing hand though Sherlock’s curls, “Very well. It’s going to take at least two days before the after effects of that shot clear up, and then you will be required to continue the duties I expect from you. Go to the bedroom and get under the blankets. If you know what’s good for you, you will take this time to sleep and recuperate.”
The complete displacement was enough to shock John into really thinking about how he’d behaved. Sherlock blocked his number, as did Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, Molly, and nearly everyone he knew at New Scotland Yard, even Sally Donovan and Philip Anderson. The shelter arranged therapy for John and found him a tiny flat to live in. He was sent to see a specialist to help with his anger issues, and with them, began his journey to wellness, but the battle against his self-hate seemed doomed from the start.
he’s an omega to boot? He sees you as his alpha. Even when you thought he was a beta, you treated him like your omega. I’m not sure what you want from me regarding this?”
Years passed. Sherlock gave up club life almost immediately because his soldier had raised his standards far too high. He let his natural hair colour come back, much to Mycroft’s relief, mostly because Sherlock just didn’t feel like making the effort to be eye-catching. The men he took to his bed after that were tepid and boring, hardly worth the effort of pulling a condom out, so Sherlock stopped picking them up. Anonymous sex was dull now. He took up detective work more seriously and even gave up drugs in order to focus on his Work. More time passed, and he gained the reputation for being austere but brilliant, a cold unfeeling genius who solved crime but only because the puzzles captivated him. His shitty flat on Montague street palled, and so Sherlock went to visit his old friend who had just moved back from the Americas. She offered him a space to rent, a much better location, but he needed a flatmate.
. “Mycroft went through every channel he had access to. Apparently, one of his hobbies is to collect the acquaintance of people who are extraordinarily talented at different things. One researcher was growing panels of experimental flesh, sort of a universal donor kind of thing, I’ve got his papers already loaded onto your laptop if you want all the technical details.”
She came to him, her face a mess of tears, her arms extended as if to embrace him. John held back a stomach-churning retch and stepped away from her. “John, no! I love you, John, don’t leave me! We can work this out, I’m clean, David is clean, we’re normally more careful than this but I know you helped Sherlock through his heat and I just wanted someone to be with.
The next morning, Sherlock checked his mobile. Mycroft had plugged it in, so he had plenty of battery to see the barrage of comments that had flooded John’s blog, most of them shocked and angry. He also saw that John had texted and phoned him numerous times in the night, each one becoming angrier and more demanding than the last. Sherlock read the last message, “Answer your fucking phone, you arse!”
She looked sympathetic, “Oh, I’m sorry, dear, they were cut off you in emergency. I can arrange for you to...”
John made no attempt to hide the fact that he found Sherlock physically attractive, taking a good deal of time to dry off Sherlock’s bum before making sure every speck of moisture had been dabbed away from his penis and testicles. He wrapped Sherlock’s ankles after treating them with a medicinal cream, checking him all over one more time to make sure he’d treated every single mar or bruise. When he was done, John slapped Sherlock’s arse lightly. “Bend over, now there’s a good boy.” Sherlock found himself braced on the examination bed exactly as John had made him stand during the more penetrative part of his visit. “Hold your arse cheeks apart, I need a proper look, not just a finger in.” Sherlock blushed harder than he ever had in his life and miserably cupped his own bottom, pulling himself wide open. He heard John use his camera several times before he felt a delicate finger sliding over that mostly untouched bit of body, “Well done, lovely boy, that’s going on my blog.”
“He has every right. He’s my mate.” John argued stubbornly.
“Yes.” Sherlock sat up and allowed John to help him out of bed, “Now.”
Sherlock placed the order, rattling off a list of items, then, answering the server’s questions regarding their preferences for each dish. John wasn’t paying attention. “I wasn’t sure you’d like everything.”
John was laughing now, “No, no, no, they don’t actually live in space.” John explained the worldwide network of scientific endeavours, the countless numbers of people involved, and the ever-growing list of off-world projects that were going on or being planned for. Sherlock was floored, “How do you not know this?” John exclaimed, “I thought science was your thing.”
“That’s…” Sherlock raged, “That’s ludicrous!”
a doctor, and I
“Yeah, alright.” John was flushed now, his eyes sparkling with happiness.
“Mine?” John didn’t bother hiding the fact that he was highly sceptical, “I’ve never been
He couldn’t tell, his mind wasn’t clear right then. A steady beeping was speeding up and it seemed to be getting louder. Sherlock was coming around and he wished he wasn’t. He hurt everywhere, inside and out. His heart was as sore as his back, his head, his legs, and especially, his arms. He heard someone groaning in misery and eventually realized that it was him. “Sherlock? Sherlock?”
“As your sister, I know full well
. Wild-eyed and in a growing state of shocked disconnect, Sherlock strode out from the Metropolitan Police Station and headed away.
. If you are a good boy, I will reward you. If you are a bad boy, I will punish you. I don’t care either way because I will enjoy all of it.”
Mycroft looked relieved, “I’ll ask the kitchen to make that stew that John likes.”
“No, go on. You can read the stories while I get her changed.” Rosie eagerly climbed into Sherlock’s arms, her chubby body moulding against the rigid planes of Sherlock’s front as if she had poured herself onto him. Sherlock’s expression was gentle and a bit pleased, he kissed her curls before turning to go upstairs while John followed.
He rolled under his blanket. There was no point in pyjamas, the only person he wore them for was John who had already sucked his cock before fingering him open. Now Sherlock’s arse felt sticky and cold, his cock was softened but still very sensitive. Sherlock was too emotionally spent to do anything about it. John left the room and Sherlock closed his eyes tight and tried not to let the tears spill over, covering his face with his hands, fingertips pressed tight to his eyelids as if that would stop the agony from leaking out. This entire evening had been confusing and awful, marvellous, and heart-breaking.
, Aggie?” David looked infuriated, “Is this true?”
“Nice to see you, brother.” Sherlock tried to dismiss Mycroft as he accepted a farewell kiss from his alpha. John noted that Sherlock’s nose wrinkled as he leaned in, and even he couldn’t deny that he smelled rather corpse-like.
They were so lost to their senses that it took almost an entire minute of silent outrage before David smelled the fury coming from John who stood silently in the doorway watching another man’s semen gush from his fiancée as he pulled out. Mary was smiling and giggling a bit, but David was craning around her torso to stare at John in shock and horror, “Oh my god,” he whispered.
Everything was blurry for a long time. Eventually, John realized that he was drowsing on Sherlock, his cock flaccid and spent inside the used condom, both at least safely outside of Sherlock’s body and drying onto the sheet below. Sherlock was entirely still, sleeping heavily, his limbs splayed out widely. His face was peaceful and John could even hear a slight snore. He hadn’t seen Sherlock sleep this heavily since he’d first come back from the dead. Carefully, John peeled himself off before he crept to the loo. Rinsing out a flannel in hot water, he snuck back the bedroom and washed Sherlock down. It was the middle of the day now but John was completely wrung out. He washed quickly and debated about going to his room before he realized that he was being entirely ridiculous. Walking softly, John returned to Sherlock’s room and pulled a duvet over both of them. Sleep came quickly.
For once, Mycroft set aside his normal condescending and often mocking tone, speaking to Danny with a straightforwardness that startled Sherlock. “I have been working for one government organisation or another since I was in university,” he began, “More than long enough to become acquainted with and versed in all the intricacies of the unspoken world that has our entire society at its beck and call. It’s all about knowing the correct people, not necessarily the upper echelons of society, no, that is a vain and pointless endeavour, rather, I knew it was necessary to establish connections with the people who would be the focal points of influence for many social domains.”
John lay there with a silly smile on his face as Sherlock began to snore. This had been the best date he’d ever been on. He’d never had his body accepted the way Sherlock had done and for the first time in his life, John was absolutely certain that he’d made the right choice.
Mycroft pleaded sincerely for the first time in John’s memory, “Remain with him for his heat. He can’t have suppressants, not anymore, and even if he could, he’s far too weak. Do not even
, not trash
“Doctor Watson, yes, your party has just been seated. Drinks are already on the way. If you’ll just follow me?” The man was shorter than John but confidently threaded his way through the large crowded room until they were at a private table. John’s mouth was dry, and his throat closed off so tight he almost couldn’t greet his dining companion, “Sherlock.”
he’s been on suppressants for far too long.” Sarah nodded her understanding, she knew full well that the longer an omega was on suppressants, the harder it was on their bodies. “I stayed with him but the minute it was over, I snuck away and went back to Mary only to learn that she’s been sleeping with her ex-boyfriend again, or rather, still. I ended it with her but by the time I went back to Sherlock, he was too angry with me to accept me back, and I don’t blame him.”
“Is that so?” Sherlock was thrilled that John hadn’t moved away, not the tiniest bit. He was in fact, leaning so close now that Sherlock could feel his body almost pressing against his.
6:45 am – I’m at the park. We should feed the ducks together someday. SH
“Shit.” The doctor was sitting in the back close to Sherlock and was frowning at the abrasions he now saw, “Fuck. I realize it’s against the law to sell you uncuffed, but do they damage merchandise on purpose?”
“Do you dream about this?” John’s cock was going to tear him except it didn’t. It slid deeper and deeper, pushing him wide open, invading him in a way no one had ever attempted before. Sherlock welcomed it. He felt full, taken, wanted, desired, and needed. It was bliss that his transport had been designed to appreciate, and appreciate it he did.
John mourned the loss of the antique cases and sturdy Victorian writing tables. “Not to worry, Mrs Hudson, I’m certain we can sort out something.” She looked so relieved that John felt guilty. His downward spiral had cost all of them, and he hated himself all over again. His stomach began to cramp, and he clenched his fists to calm himself.
“Now you’ve freaked John out! Isn’t there a happy medium with you, Sherlock?” Danny sounded both amused and impatient.

John shook his head, “I’m not really sure about how, but…yes.”
“You’re wrong.” John insisted, “We’re fine. We’re better than fine. Having a bond…we don’t need one. I just need…he’s my only…he’s just…
John’s mouth was open in shock, “So, either you live forever under this magic mistletoe

Sherlock didn’t answer him with words. He folded back the covers, enjoying the crisp clean smell that arose. He lay down and pressed his nose to his pillow. It smelled of detergent and fabric softener, but also faintly of himself and of John. There was nothing else there and it made Sherlock feel good to have proof that John had not shared his bed with anyone at all, “Come here.”
. He didn’t even ask for
“Both of our names are on the microwave, she loved that card.” John knew Sherlock adored Mrs Hudson but he wasn’t the sort of man that recalled details like presents. That he’d thought of a card at all was a bit of a miracle. John just stepped in and smoothed it all over. “It’ll just take me a tick but I’m going to wait until she’s properly asleep, that’s why I’m having Earl Grey instead of what you’re having.”
Sherlock threw up in the shower.
“John, I don’t want you going out to pay for sex, not because I lack empathy for your needs, but because I want to be the one to fulfil them.” John was completed flabbergasted. Sherlock wanted John to have sex with him? Why? “I’ve always been attracted to you, John, and more, since I’m confessing things. I find myself quite besotted, truth be told, so much so that the last few years have been an effort of endurance simply because you were threatened and I could not tolerate that fact. I did everything I could to keep you safe, and in my own way, to keep you happy. Now, I find that it is myself who is unhappy, endlessly so. I have come to an elegant realization, one that will deeply mitigate all the many problems that have become part of my everyday existence.”
“The thing?”
“How do we keep him safe? Her employer has many eyes, we are obviously being watched.” Sherlock looked agitated. John distantly wondered who they were worried about and wondered a tiny amount about Mary. “I’m only recently officially home, it’s just a matter of time before we’re in a more vulnerable position.”
“Yeah, you did. You gave me
would have been with you, not for a minute. Sherlock is possessive, jealous, clingy, and demanding. He’d never share and would never agree to be shared. I thought I was doing the right thing by coming back here because even though I love him. I made you a promise, and I had meant to keep it. I would have spent my entire life devoted to you because I told you I would. Were you dying, Mary? Was David giving you his alpha pheromones to save your life like I was saving Sherlock’s?” Both of them looked abashed, and stared anywhere than at John or one another, “It’s over between us, Mary. Obviously, we can’t trust each other, not about this.
John had his doubts. Danny seemed to fit Sherlock perfectly. He was handsome, obviously clever, intelligent enough to catch Sherlock’s finicky eye, and interesting enough that the detective had not only welcomed the new man into his bed but into his home and life. John tried not to heave yet another self-pitying sigh but failed. If Sherlock had once loved him romantically, it was pretty clear that he was over it. “I think that all I’ve done is guarantee that I suffer the maximum amount possible before having to admit that it’s over for good between the two of us. Sherlock has Danny now, he doesn’t need a second. I’ll give this a try, Harry, but if it’s too much, I’m going to have to just leave. I can’t do it. I
He was supposed to be with Sherlock and Sherlock was supposed to be with him.
