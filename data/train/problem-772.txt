Equal parts bewildered and stunned by the abrupt appearance, John could only manage to stutter out, “You have what, exactly?”
,” breathed Sherlock, the word loaded with a plea that a thousand other words couldn’t possibly convey. It was all he had in him, that one word. One final loaded plea.
But there was his voice again, right on cue. Those words shouted at John in the heat of battle lived on inside him as though Victor really were next to him, shouting through gunfire. Victor would not let John sleep. Victor would haunt him all his life. Victor would not let John know peace.
Frozen where he sat, his body betrayed him in far too many ways. His palms felt too sweaty, his neck impossibly tight, his chest allowing neither his lungs nor heart to behave properly. He wanted to read it- God, he wanted to read it. Yet he was terrified of what may lay within the pages. This envelope, thicker than the first, held a couple pages of insight. These were John’s inner thoughts on Sherlock; words he thought he’d never be able to say to him.
Let me begin by saying: I am so sincerely sorry for not responding to all of your lovely comments on the past two chapters. I have no good excuse, but a feeble one: I've been so incredibly busy. I vow to you all that I will respond to all of them tonight because I sincerely, truly, deeply appreciate every kind word you all have left. Please forgive me.
He crumbled internally, his soul giving out, the tragedy of the truth too much to live with. Still, his knees were locked, his muscles tense and while his mind, soul, and will-power changed to dust, he stood helplessly still save for his head, which finally rose to meet the terrified eyes of Victor's widower.
He escaped to the washroom with murmured apologies to Mary, dabbing at his face and button-up with a towel, refusing to look up when Sherlock walked in positively leaping.
The boys board the train for London leading up to the night before the competition. When John accompanies Sherlock to his hotel after a hypnotizing night, desire threatens to overwhelm them both.
He was frozen in place for too long. The absence of a clock to abandon hints of the passage of time was disillusioning. The light cascading in from the moon outside danced as he stood, the tell-tale signs of clouds shifting outside. His joints screamed at him for relief, his stomach too-empty from a hunger that now seemed to be a part of him. His mind was strangely quiet, even as he attempted to make deductions regarding the apartment around him.
“No!” corrected Sherlock so quickly that a great deal of beverage spilled onto the table from his nervous hand motion. Ignoring the spreading orange mess, he reached a hand out across the table toward Lestrade, hoping the motion would help convey his sincerity. “No, I am not poking fun, George. I mean it. You’re sharp and you pick things up easily. You just- you know- sometimes need help getting there.”
“Oh sure,” he drawls with a voice dripping in sarcasm. His knee started digging into John’s back and spots appeared everywhere around him. “You were acting that way because you
“Have you come for me?” came the bleary voice that was certainly not borne of his mind. It was real, an authentic sound breaking through his senses to become perception of the scene around him.
” John obliged her curiosity, turning just slightly to stare at a damp spot on the wall that was nearer her direction.
“Er- nevermind,” mumbled Sherlock, his feet shuffling away in response to his brain’s demand to escape before he could be bullied again.
Sholto took a sip of the tea he’d made for himself, his eyes remaining utterly focused upon John, who refused to look away- refused to blink. “I will agree on two conditions.”
Gratitude bloomed inside John’s chest, Sherlock’s words reassuring an ancient part of his tired soul.
The traditional fifth-year anniversary gift is "wood." There is surely a sexual fic somewhere in there but this is rated T.
It wasn’t long before their active case took a backseat in both of their minds. While Mary behaved in a way that Sherlock described as “boring,” the two men kept themselves amused until she did something “not boring” by challenging Sherlock to deduce random facts of the people around them. The game left them both red in the face from laughter, an easy bond between them that relieved the ache in their hearts.
“Aye aye, Cap,” he called with a wink to Wiggins and three of them laughed. Sherlock was certain he missed the joke even as he smiled along with them, content to partake in a joy that was not his.
He was undoubtedly stunning and talented, but even these qualities were not enough to ease the resentment that raged inside him at the sight of him.
Sherlock lazily held up the scotch in his hand, the liquid sloshing dangerously close to the lip of the cup. The next moment, in one swift motion, the rest of the drink was flowing down his throat.
She wasn’t. She wasn’t worth it and he damn near hated her. Hated her for not being Sherlock, hated her for being the source of his reasoning to leave Sherlock, hated her for shooting Sherlock, hated her for manipulating him, lying to him, and dying a death that prevented him from viably hating her for all these things. It wasn’t that she was gone and Sherlock had promised to try to keep them safe. It was that she died without granting him the gift of forgiveness. She died protecting the man he secretly loved, she was a hero, and John could see no end to the reasons why all of that made him a horrible, awful man.
Two months previous, when the two of them had begun their tumultuous affair of the heart, Sherlock had whispered between desperate kisses that he wished to take the physical relationship slowly. John had incorrectly assumed the request was born from a distaste for sex and agreed with no hesitation. He didn’t need Sherlock’s body to love him. He just needed him.
“No, no, I’m sorry,” Sherlock rushed to say. His face was hot with embarrassment, his words failing to leave him fast enough. “I don’t know why I’m here, I didn’t mean to offset your practice-”
Hastily, he flipped on the radio with the eagerness of a starving cat reaching for scraps of food. A smooth, low voice of an announcer filled the tiny flat and the background noise supplied him with the motivation to move once more. He escaped the drab kitchen to rummage in his closet, the radio growing soft from distance but remaining audible as he pulled a button up over gaunt, lifeless skin.
“Of course they’re cute,” muttered John, embarrassed to say it any louder. “Look at them. They’re adorable.”
“Wait- wait, Sherlock I’ve just realized,” said Lestrade loudly, though he couldn’t be bothered to sit up properly.
His tears were screaming to come out, but he refused them. He was an idiot- a proper fool- to not have considered this. Of
The other members shuffled out after short practice while Philip was stunned to the place where he stood. He saw John provide the pair of them with one last glance before he, too, took his exit.
John ran hastily moved to his seat and cared more about sinking into his desk than he did about whatever instructions she was providing. With a grateful sigh, he relaxed against the plastic and rapidly dug out his art supplies.
His senses were alarmingly sharpened. He was aware of the sudden hush that came over the room, aware of the flush that came over the boy’s face as he had to approach the teacher. Sherlock felt a strange pull of an unfamiliar emotion as the boy made his way to a desk to a chorus of murmured mockery.
"Jawwnn. What are you doing?" Sherlock's sleepy, post sex voice was alluring but John stayed where he was, looking at Sherlock with that charming, puzzled look that he so often wears.
Sherlock latched onto John's lower lip and sucked it into his own mouth lavishing it with his tongue before pulling away.
He could feel the shameful ideas of John dealing with his problem begin to drift into his thoughts where they were escaping from a crack in his mind palace. He wouldnt be opposed to John helping him in that way but he would never ask him to do that. He knew that John wasnt secure in his sexuality even if the oblivious doctor did not and he would not send him into a chrisis over his own selfish desires.
Sherlock opened his eyes and what he saw nearly made him come then and there. John looked him in the eyes as he moved still slow, still so agonizingly slow towards Sherlock's cock to lick a line from base to tip. Sherlock cursed and his head dropped against the matress, afraid that if he kept looking at John he would come too fast, and this would be over too soon. John kept up with the tentative licks until he spontaneously swallowed Sherlock down to his base before coming back up to suck at just his head, bringing Sherlock very, very close to the edge.
He donned his professional, doctors voice as he waited for Sherlocks response. Sherlock sighed tiredly.
"Jawn. Nothing Ive ever done with you has been a one off thing. Why would doing this with you be any different? I know that you hate when I say it but as always you see but you do not observe. When I was explaining my predicament to you earlier when did I tell you it started?" Sherlock pressed a small kiss to the doctors chest as he waited for John to answer him.
"Oh, John. Sherlock's ruining my nice walls! We've just patched them from last time. He's found that blasted gun you thought you hid properly. He must have torn the whole flat apart trying to find it. You know how he needs to shoot things when he's frustrated. Oh John, would you please go up there and sort him out? The boy is causing more damage than your rent is worth!" With that final utterance she straightened her blouse and bustled  past John hurriedly, the door knocking closed loudly behind her. Another sigh escaped him as he hobbled ip the stairs tiredly.
John stood very still, unblinking and nearly catatonic, trying to comprehend what Sherlock was saying to him. The man he has known for nealy 5 years, who has shown no interest in any sexual relationships, who has had virtually no sexual urges ever, is telling him he cant get off. Its got to be some sort of joke.
"My name is Sherlock Holmes." The stranger folded his arms and leaned them against the banister of the balcony.
John rolled his eyes and went to put on the kettle mumbling about Sherlock being a insufferable git. But no matter how annoyed John was with the cranky man he still brought him tea. Whether he drank it or not. He sipped his own tea and watched the lanky man acrossed from him, trying to guess just what was frustrating him.
"As much as I love hearing about the wonderful nerve endings in the human anus I'd much rather have that lovely mouth of yours back on my arse. Hop to, genius."
He brought himself back to Sherlock and situated them so that John sat on the bed, on his knees in front of Sherlock, who still lay down, his knees drawn up with both of his feet planted on the bed, legs pressed together, his erection trapped between them. Sherlock panted as he waited for John to continue.
Sherlock was not oblivious. He was constantly aware if his next door neighbors strangely welcomed gazing. He knew he was attractive to some degree and often used his so called beauty to his advantage during cases. People had always fawned over him and tried to win his favor through cat calls and poorly delivered pick up lines but none of them ever interested him. But this man, this one interested him immensely.
Sherlock was breathtaking. Looking like a fallen angel above him, his halo of dark, beautiful curls fell over his eyes, partially blocking them from view. Sherlock stared down at John as he passed a hand down John's chest slowly coming to rest just above his pubic bone, conveying his want while also asking consent to touch him. John felt his stomach flutter at the thought and nodded his head clearly, grabbing Sherlock's hand placing it squarely onto his hard and already leaking cock. Sherlock wrapped his fingers around him immediately and John huffed out a whine at the intant pleasure.
"Right. This a joke then? An experiment? Its 3 AM Sherlock, I have work in 4 hours." John crossed his arms and he looked sternly at Sherlock. His annoyance quickly turned to confusion as he watched Sherlocks face crumple as he shook his head vehemently. He became increasingly agitated and looked about to cry.
"You sure? You sound strange.. you arent hurt or anything are you?" His own question made his heart thrum with slight panic. He pushed open Sherlock's door and flicked on his light before Sherlock could begin his protests. John looked Sherlock over for damage but did not see anything that would cause him pain. When his eyes landed on Sherlock's sheet clad lap he saw the tent and realised with a rather audible "oh" what was wrong with him. They finally locked eyes. Sherlock's forehead glistened in a sheen of sweat, his face was flushed in obvious embarrassment but he couldnt seem to look away from John.
Sherlock ducked his head to watch his hand move on John's cock, the head dribbling precome which look absolutely mouth watering. Sherlock couldn't resist shimmying down the bed to take John directly into his mouth, swallowing around him causing John to cry out his name as he came sharply against the detective's tongue. Sherlock savored the complex flavor of John Watson while the doctor huffed out breaths as he came down.
Sherlock was already plunging a hand into John's pants, grasping at him softly and pulling a huffed shout of pleasure into the air from his doctor, which he happily kissed silent. As sherlock sped up his hand, John pulled away just slightly, barely an inch away, to huff hot breaths into Sherlocks mouth which he gladly returned. Had he not just came Sherlock would be hard in an instant but in his boneless state all he could muster were a few enthusiastic twiches against John's thigh.
Sherlock moaned as he felt John hard as rock against the bare skin of his hip through the fabric of John's pants. He rolled so that he and John faced each other on there sides before slotting a hand between them to tease at Johns waistband. He would wait for conformation before going further. John broke the kiss and nodded against his cheek whispering his conformation against Sherlock's long pale neck while placing small kisses here and there.
"Ive been trying all day. It started just after you left for work. At first I tried to ignore it, thats almost always worked before. However when it didn't I tried having a cold shower. That didnt work. By then I'd gotten very annoyed with it and I needed to take out my frustration. You know how I like to shoot the wall. Found your gun in the pocket of that suit you never wear. Pity too, its a nice suit. Anyways I heard you talking with Hudders so I stopped with the gun and waited for the reprimanding I knew you would dish out. Ive been like this all day. I was half hard for short periods of time but I was still like that all day. Waited until after you had gone upstairs to try and get off. I even tried pornography. Nothing Ive done has helped at all."
"I have nothing but respect for prostitutes but I am not about to go and have sex with someone I dont know Jawn. And There isnt anyone I know enough—trust enough to even consider asking. Not an option."
As creepy as it was, John couldn't help but stare at his next door neighbor who stood stuped against his balcony banister with a lit cigarette dangling from his long fingers. He was an absolute beauty. A mop of dark, inky curls framed his angular face and from his seat in his living room, John could tell the man was thin but fit. The man had recently taken to strolling about in just his pajama bottoms and everytime John saw him he practically choked on his own saliva. John hasn't fancied many men but this one had him instantly captivated. John took care not to blatantly stare at the gorgeous man, but it was difficult. John sat gazing at the man, head resting against his palm not unlike the fashion of a lovesick schoolgirl. He glanced at his watch and sighed. If he didnt get a move on he would be late for work.
When he got to the bottom of the stairs he saw that the living room was dark and deserted. Sherlock was in his room then. He thumped down the hall and knocked on his door, calling to him quietly through it.
The doctor, who was still standing quiet and still grabbed sherlocks wrist as he tried to move past him. He pulled a puzzled Sherlock back into the room and pushed him back so that that he gently returned to his bed. Sherlock realised John had finally understood he was being serious and wanted to help him. He sighed and turned to face John who had also sat down on the bed, although he sat further from Sherlock than actually necessary. Awkwardness and all. John took in a deep breath and looked Sherlock in the eye.
"What do you want me to do Sherlock? " John's lovely voice rumbled in his chest and Sherlock closed his eyes in pleasure. Christ, Sherlock thought, he could get me off with his voice alone. Sherlock groaned at that thought, fantasies alrwady forming in his mind palace.
What he had expected was a hard cock being shoved into his ass. What he got instead was a soft, barely-there kiss on one of his ass cheeks, and then the other. And then, all too quickly, a rough tongue slithering right between them. John, understandably, shouted at the immediate pleasure that shot through him at the sudden contact.
"Yes, thats exactly right. Now what do you think would cause me to become so aroused just after you left? Hmm?" Sherlock began to smirk, knowing very well that he was being smug. John was silent until he suddenly let out a chuckle.
"What do you-What can you do if... if you cant. You know? If you cant.. finish? Ive been trying but I can't seem— I-I cant—I cant get off."
"I love you too John. Dont panic. Its okay, love."  Sherlock snuggled into John's chest, once more placing small kisses against his chest to calm him. John slowly untensed and relaxed into Sherlock's hold, nuzzling into his curls to breath him in deeply before kissing him softly on his forehead. They held each other until Sherlock sighed contentedly, turning onto his side for John to hold more comfortably.
John had been silent for a while now, facing the door now, poking at his lip a bit. Thinking. Sherlock could tell. He was restless and still ridiculously hard under his sheet but waited patiently for John to tell him what to do. John tensed briefly and Sherlock watched as he sat up a bit, straighted him self up and turned once again towards Sherlock. He began speaking slowly after taking a deep breath.
He gave John a minute to process everything. John huffed out a breath, a sort of laugh before speaking himself.
"Jawwwnnn! Oh god please!" was all he got out before coming hard into John's eager mouth with a deep baritone moan. When Sherlock came to a moment later he found John still between his legs staring up at him with clear adoraion and lust abundant in his eyes. Sherlock couldn't help himself anymore, not with John looking up at him as if he were the most beautiful thing to ever grace the earth. He dragged John up his body to lay against him and without hesitation kissed him soundly. John froze for hardly a second before he was kissing Sherlock back, a broken cry escaping his lips like a sigh.
He could not bare, if Sherlock died now. It was like a lever had switched in John’s head. Tears started rolling down his face and quiet sobs escaped his throat. He rarely cried, especially not in front of other people, but he just could not take it anymore. A small wet spot, which grew bigger quite quickly, formed between his shoes. John felt someone sitting down next to him and laying an arm around his shoulder. It was Molly, who also seemed to have cried.
“John, I have known you for quite some time now, you have opened up a lot lately, but there is a question you never answered and I have the feeling that this is still bothering you. Do you remember the meeting after Sherlock had jumped from the roof of St. Baths?”
When he came back with Rosie on his arm, who was a bit sleepy by then, John had already made dinner. Sherlock could smell the scrambled eggs and toasted bread immediately when he started going up the stairs. He looked at Rosie, who seemed to have smelled it as well, since her face lit up. She loved scrambled eggs and squeaked. The detective could not suppress a sheepish grin when he saw this. He entered the kitchen and placed Rosie in her special chair before taking a look at John, whose face was concentrated and fixed on the pan in his hands. Sherlock took three plates out of the cupboard and placed them next to the stove for John to put the eggs and the bread on.
The detective was shouting abuse at him constantly and even if John was probably the most patient human being in Great Britain, there was a tipping point for him. He had given small hints that his intention towards their relationship had changed, but either Sherlock had not understood them or he had just decided to ignore them because he was not interested. John shook his head, it was Sherlock after all, there was no way that he had NOT realised what the doctor was doing. The ever so light brush of hands when John was passing him something, the lingering looks when Sherlock was in his mind palace, the deep eye contact when John tried to calm him down again.
Good decision. John was partly relieved that she let go of the Sherlock topic, but he didn’t like to answer this question either.
Sherlock stopped playing the violin, when he heard voices in the hallway, of which he one could immediately identify as John’s. The other one obviously belonged to a woman. He rolled his eyes at the thought of what was coming and slumped into his armchair. His stomach turned, because he hated seeing John with someone else, not that he hadn’t got used to this, but he had thought that John would not go on dates, at least not in the near future. It didn’t seem very wise to him to jump from one relationship into another, especially with a young daughter. On the other hand, maybe this was just a fling and John needed a distraction.
The therapist looked at him for a second and then said: “This seems to upset you more than you are ready to admit. Why do you care so much?”
“Yes”, John could see it know, it was right there in front of him. He only had to look into Sherlocks eyes and he could see all the love the detective felt. John did not need him to say the words, Sherlock said ‘I love you’ through his eyes, he said it through caring for Rosie, he said it through everything he did for John. After realising this, a wide smile spread over John’s face.
“I am not quite sure. I do feel okay, my job is fine, Rosie seems happy and is making progress really fast, but Sherlock has behaved very strangely the last few weeks. He does not solve any cases or leaves the house at all. He is just sitting there, saying nothing and spending the whole day in his mind palace. We barely talk and when we do, he always looks extremely sad or snaps at either me or anyone else. I just don’t understand.”
“Okay fine, if you can’t even look up from that damn screen when someone is trying to tell you that they are in love with you, you probably don’t deserve them anyways.”
“It is definitely not a good thing. I wish he would tell me what is going on. I would to be there for him, no matter what it is. I want things to go back to where they were before.”
Sherlock sipped at his tea and realised that it had gone cold. John seemed to have finished his shower, because the bathroom door opened and a half naked figure stepped into the hallway. The doctor was wearing nothing but a towel around his hips. Sherlock quickly lowered his gaze, knowing very well what would happen to certain areas of his body when he kept staring.
Silence. John could not speak, his throat was dry and he could not breathe from the weight that now pressed down on his chest.
Mycroft’s voice was much quieter than Sherlock’s, but John could still hear everything very clearly.
John had decided to go back to his old therapist, since he knew he could trust her and she already had an idea of how he thought about and dealt with his problems. After he had started to open up a little, it worked out really well and he always felt better after talking to her.
“I wrote it especially for her bedtime, so it did not sound too loud or agitated for her to fall asleep.”
“You said to me that there was stuff that you wanted to say to Sherlock but could not say it before he died. I asked you to tell me about it, but you didn’t. I get the strong feeling that after his return and until now you still haven’t told him this, whatever it is. Is this right?”
He did. He wanted the detective to roam around, be sarcastic and sassy and arrogant. He knew those were the things that usually annoyed him, but he missed that. He wanted Sherlock to run around on crime scenes. Dammit he wanted him to be happy, but at the moment, this mess of a man seemed just lost in his mind and John couldn’t do anything.
All the pressure that had built on John’s chest fell away now. Sherlock would survive. They could still have their happy end. They would be fine, at least that was what he hoped. He had no idea what would happen, after he finally could admit what he was feeling.
John was taken aback, because for a split second, he imagined having seen an incredibly hurt look in his friends’ eyes, but then it was all gone and the facade was back up.
“You know precisely that my brain does not work well and my thought process slows down after consuming food, because the parasympathetic nervous system and thereby the digestive system begins working and drains the energy from my brain.”
Of course Sherlock was being sarcastic, but John could not other than smirk, as it was indeed something his roommate did on a quite regular basis.
“I think it would be best for us to leave now.” He led her to the door and helped her into her jacket, before apologizing for his friend’s behaviour.
He smiled and began putting on the pyjama. When he had finished he laid her down in her crib and quickly went downstairs to get his violin.
“No, I don’t mind, I can do that”, the taller man’s mouth tucked slightly upwards and he took a short look at John, who seemed very relieved.
John thought of his and Sherlock’s happy moments together, the first case, where this wonderful man showed him that he indeed did not need a cane, when they came back breathless and were laughing about each other’s stupid jokes, when Sherlock pickpocketed Lestrade or Mycroft in order to get to information he usually did not have access to, when they escaped together after John had punched the officer, who said Sherlock was a freak. All those moments had been full of joy and Johns heart welled up.
John thought about how his friend behaved more like a father than he did. Right now, he was with her doing god knows what, but John knew he could trust Sherlock with this. He was absolutely wonderful with her. The way he looked at her… John interrupted his thought process at this point, he could not think of his roommate like that.
“You’re working with Sherlock Holmes then? How is he like? I can imagine it is kind of hard to live with him”, Amber interrupted his thoughts.
Sherlock pulled him even closer and lowered his mouth right next to John’s ear, his voice low and raspy:
The world blurred, when John opened his mouth and slightly licked Sherlocks lower lip with his tongue. Sherlock’s immediate response was a low sigh, before he also opened his mouth. John pushed his tongue slowly between Sherlock’s lips and when their tongues met, a jolt of electricity went straight to his groin. This felt magic.
She kept fiddling with her hair, as she scanned the room. She seemed to take interest in every little detail of their flat picking everything up and looking at it very closely. As she went past Sherlock’s armchair, she let her hand slightly run over his back.  Sherlock huffed and picked up a newspaper to be able to ignore what happened around him.
He remembered that he needed to answer: “Well, I don’t know, maybe you just enjoy staring melodramatically out of the window.”
“Listen Sherlock, is there anything you want to tell me? Because you can, I mean tell me, no matter what it is. I get the feeling that something is completely off and if that is true, you should talk about it.”
“When did you plan on telling him it is me you are after? How long did it take you to convince him to bring you here? Five minutes? Oh no, I see, it was seven, you aren’t that clever. You should be disgusted by yourself, using John to get to me. You repeal me.”
“I saw him leave opposite the rest of us with Sherlock toward the bar,” Sholto said, his shoulders straight, his trombone already in its case and held tightly in his rigid hand.
When they withdrew, the silence was thick with tension. Sherlock turned around after a small eternity spread out between them, turned up the collar on his jacket, and strode away. He moved so smoothly, John was reminded of ice dancers.
“Hmm?” Sherlock had been transfixed by some portion of his mind palace, but John watched as his friend’s pupils dilated in the transition back to reality.
“Exactly,” said Sherlock triumphantly, leaning back in his chair. “So sometimes I can explain my deductions like a well-reasoned thesis- such as your tan explaining that your service was in the Pacific rather than in cloudy Europe. But other things- the way you carry yourself that screams soldier and the way your band mate was staring at you… See, those things are visual stimuli that allow me to
He seemed taken aback, on the cusp of offended, but Sherlock didn't know why. Nor could he figure out why, strangely enough. The dulling impact of alcohol on his mind was not one he typically cared for. Now, however, it felt nearly… relieving.
The pair sat with their toes in the water, Victor wiggling his to create thoughtless splashes as the two fell into a comfortable silence and Sherlock could
Sherlock could not possibly fight back the all-consuming smile that stretched his cheeks to near-pain. He loved him so much. John Watson: his best friend, his blogger, his conductor of light, his moral compass, the love of his life, and his husband.
The man ran closer and closer, looking crazed as he flitted from bed to bed in search of Victor until he was close enough to Mycroft for him to see his still-fresh battle scars. There was a significant gash on his left arm that was clearly the damage of a rock- most likely from a fall he took. The fog of war was still over him, his mind not yet realizing that it should be processing any pain from his multitude of broken skin. His name tag and rank were smeared with mud and were difficult to make out, but based on the visible evidence, he reasoned them both and called over the din of the tent:
“Drinking game. If you take a shot, I will confess something about myself that few people are aware of. If I take a shot, you must reciprocate.”
The unforgiving cement beneath him left a bruise where his body was frozen in paralysis. The whole of his right side was a pattern of black and blue, exposing his lack of movement where he lay in this place of misery.
He’d been at uni for three years now with no problems. But it’d been years since they’d seen this sort of rainfall and John’s normal route to his art classroom was completely useless. Unable to traverse it, he’d sought an alternate route that only succeeded in making him late to his class.
“Hey,” he practically shouted, volume inappropriate and causing a look of surprise to flash over Sherlock.
I promised a post-S4 fic, but I personally align myself with the belief that The Final Problem wasn't real. So to me, the infamous "hug scene" is one of the last of the S4 canon. Therefore, I think this qualifies as a follow through on my promise. (Please let me know if you're interested in reading metas about how TFP is TAB from John's perspective.)
The silence that coated the lot of them was poisonous, humiliation flowing through thick and hot through him. 4-Fs were individuals deemed unfit for service. Sherlock, of course, was more than capable of serving. Mycroft, however, disagreed. He'd been forced to help the war efforts in manners other than military service even when Sherlock had begged Mycroft to let him serve.
The music halted to a stop, Philip’s voice rising above the tense silence of their judgement. “He doesn’t remember the bridge!” He was exasperated, tense, and made it quite clear that Sherlock was an unwelcome addition to their band of veterans.
Then, in what felt like one simple blink of an eye, John awoke with bleary eyes to the soft music of the Love Actually movie menu floating through the room. When had he fallen asleep? Where was-
He pushed himself off the wall, turning to face the lot of them. A fire burning inside him, this cruel, unstoppable desire for even one Goddamned thing to go right. In his face and stature, the band must have seen his determination, his desperation for life. They fell silent, every eye upon him. Some held anger, some confusion, and some dismay- yet in every pair of eyes, he saw the desperation to maintain a grip on this dream that matched his own.
A leap of courage supplied him with the strength to commit his hand to a grip on Sherlock’s shoulder, his fingers applying pressure and sensing warmth beneath the cotton shirt. “Hey,” he whispered, resisting his desire to lean in further but willing the sincerity of the words to ring true. “You’re going to be great. You’re going to blow them all away.”
The shouted accusatory question hung in the air, desperate for a home, a realization, an explanation. Sherlock showed no reaction, not even the slight tightening of his eyes, the drumming of his fingers, or a nervous swallow.
His tongue was tied watching Sherlock walk with attempted-grace back toward his bedroom. John’s mind was muddled with thoughts. Those thoughts of regret that plagued his life, those thoughts of things he wanted to say, and those thoughts of apologies that needed to be cried into the void that had become their relationship. These thoughts ricocheted around his head until they were all-consuming and threatened to obliviate him.
And he was right. “Technically, no,” he admitted. “I’m just a med student. But this isn’t technically a clinic or any formal treatment centre so they let us future doctors take a crack at it.”
It was like how John described to Harry how he’d wanted to go to the store yesterday but had run out of time to do it. Casual. Nonchalant. A simple fact. Nevermind that he didn’t know who “David” was and this supposed “David” just stabbed a man.
His pale, thin legs spread for miles on either side of him and John groaned at the outline of his cock beneath his navy blue pants. His mouth came down upon the exposed skin of Sherlock’s stomach, landing teasing kisses around the area until he caught the elastic waistband of the underwear between his teeth. A glance up showed him Sherlock’s frustrated expression when John began to pull the pair down with his teeth just a bit before allowing it to snap back into place when he released it.
, he thought to himself, but his loose tongue was only too happy to confide in the Detective Inspector.
The radio diminished to muddled murmurings. The whole world was edgeless, a shadow of itself as the world inside John’s mind churned with the beginnings of a life-changing idea. This was it- he knew it was. This was what he’d been waiting for, this is why the universe had been denying him everything he’d requested.
Good idea, actually. John took another as well and successfully finished every drop within. John looked at Sherlock, his nerves dancing around him to the rhythm of a salsa. It was just a question. He could ask him. Just ask him. Do it.
“If I left it- all of it- behind…” John said softly, the breath of the words flooding Sherlock’s mouth.
A bit of warning that tomorrow's may be late since I work from 9 am until 9 pm. I apologize ahead of time and I will try to get it posted in a timely fashion.
And with a blind joy that could not have been more out of place in the desolation surrounding them, the two men exited the room. There was only the seven of them, frozen in disbelief, their minds rebelling to ferociously against the information thrust upon them.
“Hey,” he said sternly, pulling away to look at him and ignoring Sherlock’s whine of protest. “Don’t do that, my dear. None of that matters anymore, alright? We have each other and we’ve been through hell to get here. I think we’ve earned the right to stop dwelling in the regret we both drowned in for years.”
Sherlock smiled with infuriating patience. “Perfectly sound observation but I was hoping you’d go deeper.”
“I suppose you’re right,” he joked with a jab of his elbow at Greg’s arm. “Come on, you’ll like him.”
Victor sat in thought for so long, Sherlock wondered if he was going to ignore the question. Yet his jaw tensed every few seconds and he continued to fidget with his hands and his toes continued their splashing in the water and he knew Victor was struggling to find the words.
“I’m sorry that I will not accept being little more than a person of interest for your pathetic blog, John.” The words were rigid and monotonous. They were practised words, John knew. “But as you know, I prefer to work alone; all you do is slow me down.”
Sherlock looked pleasantly surprised to find John’s understanding. The way his eyes softened, warming as they took John in was doing things to him- dangerous things.
“So we watched our friend die in the first shots of the ambush and he looked me in the eyes- I was frozen in panic and grief- the war bursting with explosions all around us and he reminded me that we needed to get through this. He reminded me of the train- it cleared my head, as it always did. The hope of it all. I nodded, my panic fading as I looked at him and it was replaced by a familiar clarity of war. Still, Victor took over the situation, leading our men to action while bullets and grenades flew around us.”
His right eyebrow arched in response, but his face remained otherwise stoic. He removed his hand where it sat beneath John’s own, drawing it away as he strode down the hallway. Perplexed, John watched as he walked back into the sitting room, the soft
John: always reserved and withholding. This letter shed a sharp light on his true feelings and, much to his surprise, it placed an inexplicably dreadful weight in his heart.
These shifts at the arena were usually boring. As the doctor on duty in the event of an injury or illness on the premises, he saw shockingly little action. It was only a few days a month that he accepted this job. It was merely a position he’d take when he needed the extra money. Well, this week he needed the money.
Imagining a life without Victor was painful. He considered every cold, isolated, painful path his life could have gone done without him and he became more and more grateful every day to have Victor in his life. He was a shield against words of cruelty, a confidant for the doubts and concerns that crept along the edges of his mind. They were as inseparable as two people could be, the only source of companionship that the other needed.
A long silence stretched after the words. Despite the silence, he knew John wasn’t asleep due to the irregular nature of his breathing. He allowed the silence, though there were about a million things he wanted to say. Instead, he ran through every series of words he had ever wanted to speak aloud, prepared to say them if the opportunity came. He wouldn’t allow himself to stay silent- not anymore.
There was a ball of anxiety suddenly present in the pit of his stomach. He wasn’t sure what to say, so he decided on: “I mean I know his name was Sherlock Holmes. How do you know him?”
Without missing even the slightest of beats, he moved his hands to unfasten his shirt, wincing as his right arm pulled in to his torso to fiddle with buttons holding the shirt closed. John, the future doctor, felt the craziest urge to look away. “What’s your name, then?” the man asked while he was uncomfortably struggling with the shirt’s removal.
“Because,” John said slowly while Greg put a hand over his mouth to hide a smile at John’s thinning patience, “we all need this.”
Sherlock seemed to consider this for a long moment. Finally, after considering, he said: “Then you will not need to go out with me again.”
The word repeated in his head over and over and over and over until John was mad with it. There was no breath, no blinking, no sense, and nothing other than the sight before him.
The words were screaming to get out, pounding at the door of his vocal chords, but still, they came out slowly, almost not coming out at all. “I think I cannot let go, John. You should know… you’ve connected me with happiness such as I have never known. You’ve surrounded me, filling my life with color and joy I may never know again.”
“Nothing nearly as interesting,” she said, though colour rose to her cheeks to reveal her pleasure in the change of topic. “I did get married!”
The woman hustled to grip the proper size cup and pulled on the tab to release steaming coffee into it. When it was nearly spilling from the lip, she expertly snapped a lid on top and handed it to the man with a professional smile on her face.
There was only one instance in all of his life when he’d needed a fix more. It was upon realizing he forgot for only the shortest of moments the exact shade of Victor’s eyes.
Sherlock stood in the doorway, allowing his eyes to acclimate to the darkness that was covering the flat before him. Slowly, black-and-white detail seeped into focus, revealing a plethora of items loaded with sensitive memories.
“I suppose it’s just… the most likely explanation,” he stated with the inflexion of a question. “They’re clothes for boys. Probably not your dad because of the style of them- only a few years old- and it probably isn’t very likely that he would have kept clothes for so long. It could have been a friend, I guess, but still… brother is more likely.”
,” he reprimanded, voice suddenly stern. No challenge was more irrefutable than someone else's doubt and Sherlock’s denial in his ability was a flame in his chest.
“There’s more,” he whispered and Sherlock was certain he wouldn’t be capable of movement until he heard the rest. “I have a deduction.”
He was magnificent. John was reminded forcibly just how bisexual he was. The form of the man was stunning and he wanted to stare for ages and ages and ages but somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew his stillness and inaction in retrieving his art supplies made it seem as though he were uncomfortable. He wasn’t, but he hated that people might think it so he put every effort into acting normal, retrieving his pad and paper.
The atmosphere at The Wallace couldn’t have been more drastically different than that of The Crescent. While their standard hub was lively, well-lit, and alive with a crowd of socialites eager for an opportunity to engage in conversation and dance, The Wallace was a dark, quiet place, an escape for the daily turmoil of its patrons. Still, a gig was a gig and a bar was a bar.
PSA: If you're worried about anybody's character development, I simply ask that you have faith in all the planning I did for this fic. :)
Hand on the doorknob and panting with the effort of his wanderings, he swung open the door to see a half-dozen heads turn to watch his entrance. Among them was Professor Hudson who rose an eyebrow but silently gestured him inside, continuing her sentence.
Sometimes it seemed that Sherlock was surprised by the natural flow of a conversation. It was as though Sherlock knew exactly how a conversation
But John had scrambled for so long, worked so hard, and burned himself in the effort to get past his death. It was too late now. Sherlock’s return tonight was not an answer to John’s wishes; it was a spit in the face to the immense effort he had gone through to move past the ordeal.
The man sized him up, scanning him from hair to shoes with sceptical eyes that felt an awful lot like standing naked in a crowded room.
Reconnecting with John Watson brought forward feelings that he had believed had dissipated. Rather, it turns out they were simply dormant, waiting for his return to awaken. He’d always thought maybe- just maybe- John was hiding a part of himself as well. Actually, Philip still thought that. It was a beacon of hope for him, this minor, microscopic possibility that he wouldn’t have to be alone. Or at least, it
Her laughter stopped as suddenly as it had begun, crashing into a wall of silence. He jaw slackened and she looked taken aback. “I’m sorry, were you not joking?”
He headed towards the door and only realised what he had said when he felt a strong hand gripping his arm. John turned around to find Sherlock looking at him in the most vulnerable way he had ever seen him. There was a hurricane of feelings visible in his eyes.
He thought of leaving, because this conversation obviously was not meant for him to hear. However, he could not convince himself to turn around and leave. He was too curious about what would happen. Besides, when his best friend needed help, he would be there for him. He knew well enough that this might be the only way to find out what had been going on with Sherlock the last couple of weeks. He had acted very strangely. Sherlock was always energetic and active, but now he spent his time lying on the couch or in bed. He did not take any cases, although there were a few interesting ones. The detective’s mood was worse than ever and he had been immensely aggressive towards his roommate recently. Usually, this only occurred when he was bored, but it was different this time. John found this very alarming, but when addressing the subject, he was not able to get anything more out of the detective than angry huffs, dismissive arm gestures and constant silence. Considering all this, John decided to stay on the stairwell and listen for just another few minutes.
He hated it when John brought his annoyingly stupid dates along. They were always so dull and none of them deserved his attention, time or affection.
John’s heart jumped in his chest and his knees got weak. Sherlock’s lips were so soft and tender, but tasted salty and bitter at the same time. John had never experienced or felt anything like this. It was so completely different to a woman’s kiss, especially the angle, but he loved this. He loved Sherlock. When they broke apart he could see all of Sherlocks usually so well guarded feelings, right in front of him. All the pain and the sadness, the disappointed hope and loneliness. Then John understood.
When he heard steps, he quickly adjusted his position and began walking up the remaining stairs. Only seconds later, the door opened and Mycroft stepped out into the hallway with a concerned look on his face, which disappeared instantly when he saw John.
“No, no Rosie is fine”, Lestrade replied quickly “it’s Sherlock, he got shot and it does not look good”.
He loved playing, especially for Rosie. He chose a comforting and calming melody and she fell asleep quite quickly, but Sherlock loved the relaxed look on her face and kept on playing for a while. Unexpectedly, just for a short moment, he felt at peace with himself and the world. Standing there and watching Rosie sleep peacefully made him feel whole. His life had never been easy, people always hated him for who he was and when they did not, he had shut them out when they came too close. The one person he let closest, he gave his heart to, was the one hurting him most and he needed all his strength to not let him see that. Rosie gave him hope, because he loved her just as much as he loved her father, but she could not hurt him in the ways John did. Sherlock thought about what they could be, if only everything was different. He never had acted on his feelings as long as Mary was there, even though he wanted to really badly. However, now that she was gone, he still could not, because John was convinced that he was not gay and had other things on his mind anyways.
Mycroft let out a little derisive laugh:” Yes, but the brain of a dead man does not work at all. Listen, I know you never do what I suggest, but you should take care of yourself, because believe it or not, there are people who care about you.”
When he had finished playing the violin, he silently closed the door behind him and went down the stairs into the living room, where John was already seated in front of the television. Sherlock put his violin back in its case and joined him on the couch. They had done that for a while now, so it was not unusual that their feet touched. However, it made Sherlock feel slightly unsettled, so he decided to shift a bit away from his friend, who shot him a slightly confused look.
The order was so commanding, John, the Captain in the Royal Army, fell silent instantly. He narrowed his eyes, eyebrows fully pulled together in confusion as he tried to piece together what was happening.
emotion doesn’t mean I am not in possession of any,” said Sherlock with a dainty wave of his hand that wasn’t holding his blended Mai Tai.
“No, please, Sherlock. Please just listen, okay?” John pleaded. Sherlock was physically closed off, his arms crossed, his mouth tight, his body full of tension. John scrambled into his seat once again and leaned in, gazing at him with nothing but hope and eagerness.
John closed his eyes, his forehead falling to rest upon the cold wall. He took in a shaking breath from his tight throat, his eyes burning.
Never in his life had John known such shame. It filled him within an inch of overflowing, the surface tension stretched thin on the horrible sensation. It churned in him at a nauseating tempo.
They reached for a glass at the same time, realizing simultaneously what the other was doing and reaching faster, the drinks positively flying off the tray and down their throats. Yet Sherlock’s glass was the first to hit the table upside down, a grin of exuberant victory painted across his angular face.
“Bloody hell,” Greg injected into the silence that had settled thick around them all. “Johnny, why didn’t you mention he’s a regular Frank Sinatra?”
John is certain Sherlock would rather be somewhere else and Sherlock is certain that John won't like the Real Sherlock so they're both awkward and trying to be far cooler than they are. Poor boys.
John Watson was giddy with Christmas cheer and flushed with heat from the half-consumed cup of tea in his hand. His brother- more ridiculous than he could have imagined- was quite literally hanging off of him. One arm was thrown around the shoulders of the solider while the other was resting in playful motion on his stomach, both legs a mess of limbs over John’s lap. The two were sickeningly affectionate, unable to keep their bodies apart since they confessed their mutual affection.
“No, he hasn’t served,” conceded John slowly. “But he lost his wife in the war. He’s a widower. He’s as much a part of the wartime experience as any of us.”
His blood was singing. His heart was light. Even Victor’s voice, ever present in his war-fogged mind was diminished to an unheard level. His mind was focused on only one thing: the instinctual knowledge of the instrument before him. It was a part of him. It was an extension of him.
“Ah ha!” his companion shouted, the declaration startling John out of his spiralling reverie. His head snapped up as Sherlock called out, “Wiggins!”
John was smiling despite himself, his eyes narrowed and head shaking. It was a smile more beautiful than any sunrise, and smile that corrected all wrongs in the world in a flash. “Alright,” he said slowly. “What’s going on, then?”
There are times, following the consumption of a decent amount of alcohol- of which nine shots certainly qualified- that a person doesn’t know how much they’re impacted until they stand up.
Sherlock felt a rush of blood that he prayed stayed out of his cheeks. “What about him?” he shot, a bit too quickly with perhaps too much venom.
Sherlock blinked, the question taking more than a second to process. He held up one finger and took a great gulp of his beverage, the small umbrella sinking lower into the glass. It was impossible, he knew, but the impact of it
And now this. A kiss. A proper, intoxicating, passionate, wildly inhibited kiss. But not really. It was for a case.
“Coffee,” he said at the cashier, already disinterested in any small talk she could offer. “Two sugars.”
, which this chapter is based on. A whole 18 songs! I urge you all to NOT listen ahead or you shall have the upcoming plot points spoiled. However, those few of you familiar with the musical will be happy to know that my ending will be quite different... :)
And so they sat together, pounding the drinks until the pair were right and proper mates. Sherlock unabashedly snorted his Mai Tai out his nose when Lestrade cause an uproar of laughter with a spot-on impression of Anderson. Lestrade asked him to make deductions about the bartender and the pair fell over in giggles when he could only muster, “He is a man. He is… male,” after a solid minute of concentrating as hard as he could.
“John, I am a man with a heart that offends with its lonely and greedy demands,” Sherlock half-sobbed to a John two weeks from marriage. “Without you, I am merely a shadow of life. I might as well be dead.”
Sorry for the late update. I am exhausted beyond reason and I sincerely cannot tell if this chapter makes any sense. I hope it does.
“Alright,” he said, more to himself than anything. “I shouldn’t have- I should have told you long ago. That first day, really.”
He learned that anything shy of the whole truth was considered a lie. He tested this theory when he was ten in the mirror, trying to say, “My name is William Holmes, my favourite colour is blue.” The words were reverberating through his head ready to explode yet fell silent in his throat. He cleared his throat and gagged- the sensation of attempted truth was quite painful. He tried again, speaking a statement that was partially true: “My name is
There, in that question, was the truth of his anger. He was enraged with Sherlock because he loved Sherlock, always had, but had stayed with Mary anyway. Through this choice, he had bet every future happiness on her being worth what he gave up.
Body weak from both physical and emotional exhaustion, he swept up every last letter and found his way clumsily to his bed. Ignoring the dust that coated the fabric, he crawled under the sheets. All around him was a cloud of dirt that evaporated within second, the particles that had spent years settling themselves into the sheets flying away to find a new home.
Hushing him again, John placed one hand gently against his shoulder to keep him in place. “It can wait, Sherlock. Don’t push yourself.”
John had just begun sputtering in contradiction when Sherlock’s hand flew up to halt his words. “I will. But not here and don’t go getting the wrong idea.”
A long moment passed in silence as his mind visibly churned in thought. “I know a guy…” he trailed off, remaining silent for so long, John grew uncomfortable, unsure whether he would continue or not.
Just like it was before. The war was over and now everything could apparently be exactly the way it was in 1938.
His mouth traversed up and down the expanse of him until he was dizzy with the sensation of him. He opened his eyes to steady himself and saw Sherlock mouthing words he couldn’t hear into the air, his eyes fluttering rapidly as his eyes rolled back. The sight was so hot, he sped up his actions, working his tongue more aggressively against him as he did so. Keeping his eyes on Sherlock, he watched the impact of the new speed hit him. Hands grabbing his hair more tightly, he gave a feeble thrust of his hips against John’s mouth but he seemed to lack enough strength to put any real effort into it.
It was a rhetorical question that was answered by Philip. “And which original should we be preparing for the contest?”
” bellowed Sherlock in a breathy voice, and John felt hot, thick cum fill his mouth. His body rocked with intense pleasure as waves of fluid spilled from him, his hands holding John’s head on him. He had no complaints about this, feeling like he’d waited years to be able to suck Sherlock off like this. They hadn’t gotten around to this bit last time they were together. His tongue traveled the still-pulsing cock to get every last drop of cum he could garner from Sherlock.
John placed a teasing kiss along the base, gently sucking on each ball until Sherlock was rightfully squirming for want to be sucked. He flicked his tongue along the underside of him, refusing to give him exactly what he wanted- yet.
“I think that would be a wonderful idea,” John said simply. Something plummeted within Sherlock. It was short and cruel, a quick declination of Sherlock’s attempted advances. John was clearly trying to keep his face a calm mask as his words rapidly shot down nearly every hope residing within Sherlock’s heart, which had grown so large, the deflation of it was all the more painful. “Sherlock, I… fancy you a great deal.”
“What’s wrong?” He lifted a hand to gingerly wipe tears from a face bruised by John’s hands and feet.
“No.” The sincerity he answered with stunned John, body freezing until Sherlock released him with a continued explanation. “I really was given a 4-F classification. That part was true.”
“How?” repeated John, throwing more weight behind the word this time. “How do I stay with you? How do I leave Mary and come to be with you? How do I pack my bags, close a door on everything I know? How do I lock that door and walk confidently away to be with you?”
“What if he opens a door that I can’t close?” continued Sherlock, his eyes penetrating deep within John soul. “What if when he sees me- really sees me- he wants to again?”
And yet every day was better. It was never easy, but it got easier. It was months of work, months of communication, months of dredging up their mutual pain. Forgiveness rang through their bones as they cleansed themselves of the regret that flowed through their blood. Sherlock fixed himself, John put himself back together, and they both built themselves to be better men through the combined effort.
The duality of Sherlock’s will was tearing him in two. One part of him was screaming to consume the letters in quick succession, devouring the content like the ravenous man in love he was. The other part of him- the part screaming in agony- was demanding to walk away from the ink confessions held within those deceptively benign envelopes It caused him extraordinary pain to read what he had done to John. It was worse to know what Sherlock had missed.
Still, the fact remained that he couldn’t tell a full truth. He couldn’t even tell his classmates or family, “Hello, just be aware that I can’t tell the truth. Everything I say to you is a lie. Don’t believe me, ever!” because that was, infuriatingly, the truth.
"Jawn." Sherlock interrupted his rambling. Once he'd gotten his attention be continued softly, his face reddening more and more. "If you think you can help me then by all means please try. I can't stand this anymore. If it doesnt work then Ill go to hospital but Ill try anything before that. I trust you John."
John was absolutely stunned. Not only by the man's straight forward boldness, but also by the man's deep, honeyed baritone voice. John was absolutely starved for sex. He knew it could be dangerous but how on earth could he manage to turn down this beautiful man? He couldn't speak for quite some time bit when he did his voice was shaky at best.
His every move was slow and deliberate, giving Sherlock plenty of time to back out. What John didnt know is that Sherlock would let him do anything to him right now. Whatever John wanted. John slid his hands up Sherlock's calves then put one hand on each of Sherlock's knees and gently pushed at each one until Sherlock was splayed open before him. That act alone made Sherlocks blood course through him like a wildfire.
Hands tight in John’s shirt, he pulled John into a kiss that instantly left the world behind. There was only Sherlock Holmes and John Watson and an ancient desire to touch every inch of one another.
Just John. There was not anything out of the ordinary, per se, except everything about John was extraordinary. In his exceptional being, John was absolutely perfect.
“What?” interrupted Sherlock with a genuine appearance of astonishment. The word was flat with utter confusion. “I’m not upset that I fell.”
“Alright, put me down,” he said shakily and Sherlock granted the request. When John’s feet were firmly planted on the ground once more, the two men were frozen in a tense silence, their eyes flinting from one another to randomized items around them.
Leave it to Sherlock to have the exact statistic at hand. “Piss off,” he said, his smile ruining any semblance of sincerity. “Mind if I join? Unless I’m mistaken, you were going to teach me some invaluable lessons on… what’d you call it? The
“Absolutely.” He finished the rest of the eggnog in his cup for courage. “You better watch out, women everywhere will be falling over themselves if they see you in such a handsome jumper.”
Please be aware that this timeline and progression of events is similar to BBC canon, but will differ in several critical ways, especially as the story progresses. Stick around for plot development!
There was nothing to do but laugh. Through the insanity, through the unlikely truth of it, through the tense knowledge, they could only laugh. Sherlock’s laugh was a deep, reverberating thing, warm enough to heat the space between them.
He could barely pay attention to anything at all, still hyper-aware of every eye glance, whisper, inquiry, and action regarding the boy. Through it all, the red-haired boy simply sat at his desk, stared straight ahead, and showed no hint of recognition of the whispers around him.
Five impossibly long hours later, John was off of work and ready to relax. It was his understanding that most people clocked out and sighed with anticipation of getting home. For John, however, the thought of going back to his flat where sounds were too loud, his thoughts too consuming, and his dreams unbearable left a tight knot of dread in his stomach. His feet carried him back to the shop, his mind reeling against the ridiculous choice.
He reciprocated the motion, opening his mouth against Sherlock’s to move his tongue inside the man. Their tongues brushed together, their lips pressing together with more vigor than before. On his side, he felt Sherlock’s hand twitch and John needed no further cue: maintaining contact with his lips, he rose clumsily from the floor and wrapped one leg at a time around the man’s hips until he was straddling him while Sherlock’s hands lifted tenderly to rest upon either side of John’s waist.
, they were best friends. He was John’s one shining light to provide him with guidance through hell.
There were just over one hundred of these alternate realities that he could have traveled through, though he was cautious of how many rooms he entered. At first, the alternate-realities were bittersweet: in the early days, their close friendship was almost comparable to the wild affairs Sherlock created in his Mind Palace. The more doors he entered and passed, however, the further along their story they got. These doors weren’t bittersweet at all; they were heartwrenching.
was he supposed to go talk to him? Why couldn’t he do it himself? He knew Sherlock well enough to know he’d never obtain a straightforward, honest answer to any of those questions. The man loved to avoid answers by instead providing replies he thought were clever.
“Damn it,” he finished, his voice brimming with anger but his face betraying his disappointment. “You need to do it.”
Yet the third measure came to a swift close and, content or not, he had to begin. He took a shaking breath and the classic words flowed from him- from an ancient source of bravery he knew not how to consciously access:
Then, sudden and loud, a rapid succession of descending piano notes filled the air around them. An 80s synth melody so intoxicating, he immediately arose from the booth, his unfocused eyes finding his friend by an ancient jukebox.
The bartender silently obliged, a man whose face was forgotten the moment he turned away. John consumed the fresh liquid in an instant, wishing the dulled sensations could kick in as rapidly as he could drink it. He twirled the empty glass along the sticky countertop. The air was thick with sweat, the murmur of voices like a wall of pressure against his ears. It was too much, all of it.
“Smart man!” said Alex, infuriatingly maintaining his jovial mood as an unparalleled mix of denial and gloom settled upon the seven men who’d been miles above the world mere seconds ago. “As I’m sure your trumpet player will see, every question you could have will be answered on that page there. Feel welcome to drop a letter to the address at the bottom there if there’s anything else we can do for you lads.”
“Oh dear, I’m afraid he’s not here at the moment,” she said with her voice brimming with regret as though she hadn’t just set fire to John’s world with the smallest of strikes.
It was quite fortunate that Sherlock’s face, flushed with colour, was not visible to the man now reaching one arm clumsily toward the top of the tree. John placed the star on the tree at a strange angle, his hand coming down to slap at Sherlock’s hands.
Greg wore a casual smile, approaching Sherlock with an easy grace and a halo of chocolate hair. He was indubitably handsome. He carried his bass without a case as though it were an extension of his hand and not a twelve kilogram hunk of wood.
“Right, er-” John said, face coloring with humiliation at needing to be asked to stand up. He searched for the words- any words- to say, but none came. His tongue was heavy in his mouth, suddenly too large and too dry. “Right,” he said again, grabbing his phone off the table and moving it to his pocket as he stood.
“Oh, please!” said Lestrade with a laughter that fluttered his words. “Come off it. You can’t pretend you haven’t noticed how he's changed you.”
It's the night of the band's first performance at The Cresent. Despite the thrill of playing for a crowd after years, the hour-long set will only be the second best part of John's evening.
Miraculously, his cheek twitched with a hint of a smile, though no such smile broke out. “You astound me, John Watson.” The sentiment was abrupt, unexpected. John started, praying his cheeks would not betray him. He was about to stutter out a nonsensical response when Sherlock continued, “I told you. I have a brother in high places.”
Instead of asking anything back, John took a big gulp from his wine. He thought of the first time he had eaten at Angelo’s. He remembered the smooth light on Sherlock’s face and their kind of awkward conversation. Angelo had assumed that they were a couple, of course John immediately corrected him, but Sherlock had not said anything. He had corrected Angelo’s every sentence, but remained quiet regarding the “date” topic. Sherlock had said many confusing things that evening. Girlfriends were not his area. He hadn’t said that about boyfriends…
“I’m serious Sherlock, I did so much for you in the last couple of weeks and you have not been exactly nice to me, so the least you can do is listen to me.”
“Sherlock”, John growled, the atmosphere was frizzling from tension now. Sherlock groaned, lowered the newspaper and heard himself blurting out his thoughts:
He lowered his gaze to the floor and tightened his jaw before looking up again. Sherlock could see the disregard and incredible anger in his eyes and swallowed hard. Meanwhile, Amber’s face had lost all colour and her mouth stood open. She seemed to pass out any second. John shot Sherlock another abhorred gaze before he said:
John left the flat at 10 o’clock in the morning, he didn’t know how long Sherlock had already been awake or whether he slept at all, but the detective had prepared breakfast for the three of them and they had enjoyed the sleepiness of a Saturday morning. Now that he left the flat, he inhaled the fresh air of a cold spring morning. Sherlock would surely have told him now, that the air was indeed all but fresh, since in winter the carbondioxide in the air increased, because the trees could not do the photosynthesis due to the missing leaves. He smiled at that thought and hailed a taxi to drive him to the therapist’s house.
“I don’t know. Maybe I care so much, because I just want him to be happy after all this stuff with his sister”, he got slightly frustrated when he realised he was not really convinced by this himself.
Sherlock looked at this with disgust. Why did no one ever appreciate honesty. The door slammed shut, they were gone again.
“Oh Jesus Sherlock”, was the last thing John said, before the detective kicked the bedroom door shut behind them.
The water boiled, so he took two cups and the kettle and walked over to Sherlocks chair, where he put down the cup on the coffee table. The detective showed no reaction at first, but laid the violin back in its case eventually. He flopped into his chair and took the tea without saying a word. A ‘thank you’ would have been nice, but John did not want to make a fuss this time. He sat down opposite his friend and savoured the first few sips of the tea. Maybe he should ask straightforward what was bothering the detective, now seemed like the appropriate time.
He grimaced and made room for him to walk past. Mrs. Hudson had called Mycroft a reptile once, maybe this comparison was not so wrong after all. He waited a few more seconds on the stairs until he heard the front door closing with a “click”. John slowly exhaled, he hadn’t even noticed that he had been holding his breath the whole time. He slowly pushed the door to the living room open and spotted the detective staring out of the window, Sherlocks back was turned towards him, so he only saw the outlines of his roommate’s slim figure and the mess of curls on the back of his head. His robe slightly moved in the draft that was caused by the open door and window. John found it complimented his features even more.
He sunk down in his chair. He felt empty and exhausted. The therapist took a few notes and then she put her pen and notebook down. She spoke the next words very carefully:
The three of them really were a family, but with the romantic involvement of the parents missing. Sherlock really hoped that this might change one day, even though this seemed impossible right now. He could predict so many things and knew nearly everything, but regarding this topic he couldn’t tell what would happen, he just didn’t know. And he really didn’t like not knowing.
At home John took care of Rosie and spend some time playing with her. She really was an Angel. Her smile was bright and her mood also affected John positively.
“If you were awake you would give me a weird and confused look now and ask me why. I will provide you with the answer: William Sherlock Scott Holmes, I am in love with you. There, I said it. I fell for you. I have no idea when and why, but I did. Why do people love anyways? What does love even mean, it is such a complicated thing and I have no idea what will happen when you wake up, but I had to get this out of my system." He shook his head, what in the world was he doing?
The dark-haired man pulled him back into the kiss, before starting to pull John’s jumper over his head. John had already begun unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt when he realised that the detective was slowly guiding him towards the bedroom.
Sherlock’s heart began aching, he didn’t want John to be with someone else. He wanted him of his own, he wanted to say, ‘this is my boyfriend John Watson’. He wanted to kiss him, to hold him close and never let go. He wanted him to be happy, of course, John of all people deserved to be happy the most. On the contrary that meant Sherlock had to step back when it was somebody else that made John happiest. He had done this many times before, stepping back, he had gotten used to the pain, but this time it was much worse than ever before. Not because Amber was so special, or John showed affection towards her in any way, but because John still seemed to go for women and did not seem to consider any alternative.
“Hmm, I don’t know, maybe because you just were shot and nearly died?”, was his friends answer, of course equally sarcastic.
Now John was just clueless. He wanted the old Sherlock back. He loved it when Sherlock was ranting and rambling about all the idiots out there or when he paced through the room, walking right over the coffee table without even realising it. He enjoyed it when the detective played his violin (yes, even at 3 o’clock in the morning) or did his experiments on the kitchen table. Sure, he hated the smell and he would never use that table for food again, but he had gotten used to it and now that none of that was happening, he honestly missed it.
Sherlock’s face was only inches apart from his, so John could feel the detective’s flat breath on his lips and the heat radiating from his body. He shut his eyes and closed the gap between them.
Sherlock slowly exhaled when his blogger had disappeared into the bathroom. He made John think he went off into his mindpalace, but that was not true after all. He just could not stand the asking expression and worrying look on his friend’s face anymore. He would not tell him what was going on in his head. He knew that he could very well trust John with everything, not that Sherlock enjoyed talking over feelings and problems, but he was aware of the fact that no matter what was happening, the doctor would be there for him. Usually he would have told John about his problem by this point, but there was this one single thing he could not say out loud in front of him. Sherlock was completely and utterly in love with his roommate.
John’s stomach turned, his heart clenched and he could feel his hands turning sweaty. The last thing he had said to Sherlock had been horrible and he did not apologize. All of this seemed like a very bad dream. Why was all this happening to him again? John forced back his tears, no he could not cry now.
The last couple of weeks had been really painful for John. After Sherlock had been released from the hospital, he had been even grumpier than before. He incredibly bored, since he was not allowed to go on cases again and therefore had to stay home. John had done his best to make it as easy and interesting as possible in the flat. He had tried to keep Sherlock occupied and busy, but it did not seem to have worked out.
John let himself fall into a chair and let his face sink into his hands. He stared on the ground, Lestrade’s words echoing in his head. He said unlikely, so it still was possible that Sherlock survived. John had to hold onto this straw, otherwise he would lose his mind. He did not realise when Mrs. Hudson together with Rosie, Molly and Sherlocks parents arrived. He did not realise that Rosie started crying for her father.
If he knew how much fun it was for Sherlock to spend time with Rosie, he would be surprised. Half an hour later the doctor raised and announced that he wanted to go to bed, because he never knew if and when Rosie would wake up at night, so he would try to get as much sleep as he could. Not much later Sherlock also disappeared into his room and went to bed. Of course, that did not mean he would sleep, no, he usually did not sleep any longer than 2 or 3 hours at most, but he could not play the violin at night or experiment with gun powder, because the risk of waking up John and/or Rosie was too high. Like this, Sherlock just laid there in bed, stared at the ceiling and sorted his mind palace.
“I used to think that you had feelings for me too, but since you have returned from the hos…” he was not able to finish his sentence, since Sherlock had grabbed his face and pressed their lips together.
“What I do with my body is none of your business, no one asked you to watch over every part of my life, so just stop spying on me all the time”, shouted Sherlock.
John saw him as a friend, this would never change, not today and not in 10 years. His mind was just completely off track because of the painkillers the doctors were giving him. If John felt the same way he did, he would say something now, when he, Sherlock, had barely escaped death, that was when you usually realised you had feelings for someone. That John said nothing now could only mean that he had either no romantic interest at all and Sherlock had been wrong all along, or that the feelings just were not strong enough for John to act on them. Either would break Sherlocks heart. He closed his lids again, so John was not able to see the pain in and the tears that burned at the back of his eyes.
The few times when he was alone and able to think rationally, he realised that he was proved wrong, that he did have emotions, even though he liked to think he was above all that. He always had emotions and if he was being honest with himself, they were what had kept him on track during his cases. His sister did not care, his brother did not care, but he, Sherlock, he had always cared. He cared so much it tore him apart. On one hand he hated it, but on the other hand it made him feel  alive. When Sherlock thought this, he began smiling and the smile did not disappear when he doze of in a light sleep somewhen in the early morning hours.
“So, you know”, Sherlocks voice was merely a whisper “you know about...”, he didn’t finish the sentence.
“Sherlock be reasonable, you will starve yourself to death if you don’t eat at all”, Mycroft started again.
At home, John had climbed up half the stairs when he heard a loud conversation from the living room, which he quickly identified as a fight between Sherlock and his brother.
Girlfriends weren’t Sherlocks area, boyfriends were. Sherlock had never corrected anyone when people were assuming they were a couple. Sherlock had jumped off that roof for him and when he came back and apologized John had only seen the betrayal and not that Sherlock really wanted him to forgive him. Sherlock had accepted that John married a woman. Even the wedding, hell, he had done everything to make it the best day of John’s life. The speech Sherlock held had been so wonderful and only now John realised that this speech had been a love letter to him. He fought back his tears when he thought of Magnussen, Sherlock had crossed the red line to keep him safe. Sherlock had killed for him. After Mary’s death he went through hell and back just to get John’s attention and help him overcome his grief. He let John punch him nearly to death without saying anything at all. Sherlock found out he had a secret psychotic sister and there had not been one single word of complaint when they were captured in Sherrinford. He had just pushed through and had done his best to get everyone out of there alive.
“We’ll see.” Sherlock placed a plate and a plastic fork in front of Rosie, who could eat most food on her own by now. There would be quite a lot of her portion next to the plate by the end of the meal, but she made progress.
John could already feel the anger building in him. He also was exhausted, he had no energy to keep pushing Sherlock to talk to him. It made him feel frustrated, because it really was not easy for him to talk about this stuff either, but he still tried to. When he rose from his chair, he did not shout at Sherlock, but his voice was full of hurt and anger and bitterness:
”So… ehem… What exactly did you think? That throwing yourself in front of a gun would be a good idea? “
“So basically, you’re running around London and solving crimes and being a professor at Baths is just your day time job?”, Amber asked curiously.
“We will have to keep him for a while, but one of you could visit him now. Since he is asleep and needs rest, everyone else should go home and come back tomorrow.”
“Actually, it isn’t that bad”, Johns answer was short and not exactly polite, but he didn’t really care.
Only then it occurred to John that Sherlock might not be exactly used to this, so he interrupted the kiss and looked up to him. There was this incredible intensity in Sherlocks ocean blue eyes and it took his breath away. It made him feel so wonderful and special that his heart swelled. Sherlocks eyes changed into a questioning look, so John stuttered:
And then it dawned on him. Right there and then John realised that nothing today had been about Amber and nothing yesterday had been about the therapist or Mary. It had been about Sherlock and him. It always had been and it always would be. John’s heart clenched when the puzzle finally came together. He, John Watson, was in love with Sherlock Holmes. It was time to accept it. He had supressed these feelings for so long and it had cost an immense amount of energy to deny it. He not only had lied to himself, but to everyone around him as well. He loved Sherlock with every part of his body. He loved him for his laughs, they were really rare, but when John could see them, they were the most perfect thing in the world. He loved him for all of his flaws, his arrogance and his ignorance to name only a few, but most of all, he loved him because of the way he was with Rosie.
This made Sherlock ache, even if he hated to admit that he could feel such a thing. Seeing John every day, knowing about their shared feelings, but not being able to do anything about it, because his friend had not realised it yet. You cannot tell someone that he is in love with you. If Sherlock dared to say anything only vaguely pointing in this direction, John would get mad and confused. He already was a mess. Sherlock’s death, his return, Mary’s death, the whole drug story and Eurus had worn John down emotionally. He had a little daughter whom he needed to care for and Sherlock could see how he struggled sometimes and the one thing he did not want to do was pushing him over the edge by telling him about either of them being in love with the other.
“Stewardess, two cats at home. John, she is wearing cheap perfume, probably not one you should go for. She has not been on a date for a long time and spends most of her free time playing tennis. Her hair has not been cut in four, no five month, I really don’t think this is the standard you are looking for John.”
Despite knowing she wasn’t coming, John foolishly allowed himself to remain planted in that seat, allowed his eyes to dance around the room, scanning every face for her face. Pride wouldn’t let him foolishly stand and walk out, allowing everybody in the room to confirm what they already suspected. Pride also wouldn’t allow him to sit here and allow those around him to pity him. Especially the waitress, so smug in her- correct- assumption: John Watson had been stood up.
The liquid that had been working its way down John’s throat suddenly had a new destination. Coughing, he stared at the man in complete bewilderment.
Sherlock was right- Sherlock was always right. It took time- roughly twenty minutes- but eventually, Mary grew bored. The gentleman who she’d been courting before John had left and she had no luck with any other gentleman in the place. All this according to Sherlock since John had waited in the washroom all the while.
But it was Christmas day, Mycroft was internally counting the seconds until he could leave, and the whole house held the stench of love.
That one unseasonably cold morning in April when the clouds were heavy but didn’t drop their moisture where Sherlock paraded all over London hand-in-hand with John because some villain needed to believe they were together. They’d gone flower picking, their hands warm in each other's grip. John had looked at Sherlock with all the love and adoration he’d always wanted to show on his face. Sherlock put a flower behind his ear and the light brush of fingertips along his face haunted him later that night. Apparently, their act had worked because Sherlock reported that some scout had reported back to the head criminal that they two were dating.
“Alright,” he said. “You need to make sure to keep this dry for one whole day. After that, you need to wash and rebandage it two times every day, okay? Take pain pills as needed but otherwise, you're good to go.”
Time was inane. It could have been one second or seventeen weeks or ninety-seven years later when Mycroft crossed to the door to leave Sherlock alone- completely alone.
Then he went to uni and his object of affection shortened in two senses of the word: Tall, lanky Jonathan became a thing of the past and short, stocky John Watson replaced him. His very first words to Philip had been “Excellent finger work on that sax,” and Philip, mouth dry and heart racing, had been instantly in trouble.
John fought the urge to scream and drag his nails against his skin. When he’d been seven years old, his parents had declared him a “prodigy.” He wasn’t, of course, but having a child prodigy had them feel special. In reality, John was simply musically inclined. He picked up the accordion and learned quickly, rapidly becoming more than adept at the instrument. He’d played weddings for years, including for Al and his wife, Molly. At nine, he’d then taken to the piano like a fish to water, the music alive within him. He’d stuck to the piano, continuing to learn until there was nobody better. But still, the ability to play the accordion lived within him.
John shook his head slowly, the motion conflicting with the eye contact he maintained with Sherlock across that impossibly long intimate moment. “It’s… challenging, you know. It’s hard for me to… tell you how I feel. That is, how I feel the same way toward you.”
Sherlock laughed at his feet, the sound light and melodious in John’s ears. “Right then. See you around.”
“Your insomnia,” Sherlock said slowly, leaning forward to rest his chin on his propped up arm. “It’s related, isn’t it? To Victor, that is?”
He riffled through the letters until he found an envelope matching the description: unbalanced writing with a great deal of effort evidently put into keeping it clear and controlled.
Philip’s life would have been so much easier if he could have continued to live in denial. It was a thought that would come frequently to him since his heart was a damned fool. His heart didn’t understand what his brain knew far too well: there could be no realization of any desire he held. Ever.
“But- but-” and his entire body was shaking, his eyes blurry, his world shattering. He forced himself on, the clarity of battle- this dramatically different sort of battle- overcoming his urge to run. “But- I didn't throw the grenade hard enough. It… fell. Back into our trench. It rolled too far away from me to risk grabbing it for a second throw. It was better- safer to get out. I screamed at everyone to get out, screamed it over and over and watched everyone scramble away and I, too, crawled my way out.
Tobias was clearly annoyed with Greg’s display of affection but simply rolled his eyes and said, “I’ve killed worse, I suppose.”
So he suffered- silently. He hated himself, hated the situation he was in, hated his choices and he took it out on Sherlock Holmes.
He had not expected even the slightest bit of resistance. Though in hindsight, he should have. The lot of them were trained professionals in the arguing department.
Philip looked between John and Greg, silently seeking answers to a question he didn’t want to ask. “What do you-”
I've always been obsessed with what everyone must have been thinking when these two met. Ergo, this story.
Remaining stoic, Sherlock stepped forward as though to grab the thing from John’s hands, but manoeuvred expertly once he was close enough to act upon his whim.
THE VIEWS OF JOHN H. WATSON REGARDING FRANK SINATRA DO NOT REFLECT THE VIEWS SHARED BY THE AUTHOR. ;)
The boys at his school were cruel. The classroom with white walls, one blackboard, and a suffocating lack of air was a cesspool of mockery that Sherlock shrugged off with an indifference that was wholly fabricated. Every day, he would shoulder the burden of being the class “freak” with a false calm until he got home and could lay in the comfort of his bed to curl in on himself.
John said nothing, just stared across the miles between them and processed the words. His eyes, animated, reacted precisely as Sherlock predicted. First, going wide with shock, then narrowing suspiciously, the irises darting wildly around the pair of them. It was as though he was attempting to spot the source of the words- as though he would be able to find a criminal with a gun in-hand who was forcing Sherlock to say the words.
His footsteps faltered, back turned to John for a long moment before he shot him a sideways glance and said, “No. He drinks there.”
Sherlock’s eyes darted to and from John, his discomfort clear. “John,” he said slowly, leaning back slightly- no, leaning
“Right,” said John, trying desperately not to allow his excitement to show. “Can you tell me who they are?”
“When he finally looked up… he was so confused. He didn't know what to do and I couldn't explain so I just kept shouting-”
He’d initially dismissed Mycroft's insistence that this case needed his help. He'd only agreed to it when Lestrade read through the case and convinced him that he was the only one who could solve it. Though he would rather shave his head than admit it, it was proving more difficult than anticipated.
. A man that I develop affection for. What if when he sees me, he’s only disappointed? What if he runs away and I can’t stop it?”
The affair with a woman who held no candle to him. The woman- a safe choice even in this turbulent affair- was a meager attempt to achieve something similar to what he left behind that night. His frenzy to choose any option other than the desperate, all-consuming love currently at 221B made his heart ache with longing.
The effects of their shared shots were now diminished to next to nothing, though the high of their shared exhilaration- in the case and in their conversations- kept them unnaturally giddy. It was true that neither of them could recall the last time they’d felt quite so sincerely happy.
John’s fingers wrapped hesitantly around his pawn, certain he must claim the queen for his long-term safety.
“Okay,” he said into the silence following one of Sherlock’s gorgeous violin renditions of We Three Kings. “Don’t get mad.”
“I was not about to let an army doctor, only recently back from the war, with no family or friends who is only just now attempting to return to dating get stood up and publically humiliated. So where does that leave my options? I could come up and pretend to deliver a message, but why then could she not have called or texted you herself? If she could contact me to pass a message, it seems unlikely that she would be unable to tell you. Alternatively, I could have come and offered to have dinner because I saw you were alone, but you have a great deal of pride and I doubt very much that would have spared you any more embarrassment than if you were to simply leave. Therefore, my only option was to come up and pretend to be the one who was late. It spared you the public humiliation, proved everybody’s assumptions incorrect, and also placed the sole embarrassment on myself. I am the jerk who was late and made you wait, you are the hero for waiting so long and having faith that I would come.”
No one was surprised, of course. Mycroft recalled Greg feigning a surprised gasp before abandoning the charade.
Face still twisted with displeasure of the alcohol rushing down him, Sherlock let out a tight “Ah,” spinning the shot glass between his fingers but remaining quiet.
All the discussion of Victor’s partner and never once had he used any indication of gender. The conversations ran through his head on repeat in dizzying circles until John was mad with the repetitions.
Once again, thank you so much to everybody who is reading, subscribing, kudo-ing, and commenting. I appreciate and adore each and every single one of you. You provide me with endless motivation. 💖
It wasn’t. It was a bit short on him, his hip-bone jutting out from under it when he reached for a book on the shelf. Even so, he looked so handsome that John couldn’t bear to look at him for too long. Beholding him made him far too randy, for lack of a better word.
“He’s good.” Greg rose his eyebrows when he said it to John, nodding his head to Sherlock. “Don’t piss him off again or I’ll take advantage of it and find out what other dirt he has on you.”
“Text me,” he said, as smooth as could be. “Perhaps we could attend the London Symphony one evening.”
He was dizzy with the thought, deliriously attempting to grasp what was happening as Sherlock’s hand rose to John’s mouth, silencing the many protests that had been inadvertently escaping John’s mouth
John stopped, a file of messy papers held in his hands, hair a tumble and face confused. “What are you on about? I’m nearly fifteen minutes early.”
So they waited. And waited. As the list of bands still left to perform shrunk and the list of bands who already had their shot grew, the nerves collectively rose.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but his mouth still twitched into something to betray him. “Fine. My turn, yeah?”
Slowly, carefully, ever so gently, John lifted his arms to reciprocate. He felt the way Sherlock’s skin was soft beneath his fingers, felt the warmth seeping from beneath his clothing. It was intoxicating, unexpected, and addicting. John wished he could pause the world and live in that one moment for eternity.
He threw himself into his studies. He leaned into his natural ability to read the experiences of those around him. If he could burrow himself deeply enough into the pursuit of learning, he could ignore just how few people desired to come near him.
His life without John had been no life at all; an endless blur of coping mechanisms, purposefully denying joy, and reveling in the pain he would cause himself in an effort to feel something.
“Yeah,” whispered Sherlock. John risked a minuscule glance up to him and saw that he, too, was looking at the ground beneath them.
“No kidding? How do you know him? You wouldn’t happen to know what happened to, you know,” he said and pointed to his head, whistling.
“To see if these ridiculous penguin socks really do make one iota of a difference in foot warmth around the house.”
“I asked if you wanted to take a walk. You asked me why you would want to do that and I told you that you didn't want to but otherwise I would go alone.”
Never in his whole life would he have imagined that such a flawless exterior would be host to an excellent interior. Here’s just some of the thing he’d learned about him: his fondness of violin transferred to an eventual talent with guitar as well, he hated the band who was playing and didn’t mind missing the concert, he lived in London but his job kept him on the road a lot, his favourite composer was Bach, he hated the Hungarian Rhapsody, he had a small family (parents still together and one sibling- a brother who was “a piece of work”), and he’d always dreamed of having a job where he could actually use his sharp mind.
They crossed the stage, ingrained instincts causing them to, once again, fall into a march to their positions on stage as the previous band shuffled off and the woman announcer of the radio program could be heard as the backing track for their journey.
This earned a smile- a begrudging smile, but a smile nevertheless. “Afraid not. Service left them less disciplined.”
John’s lingering silence ensured that Sherlock would never reach peace. So long as John’s silence held possibilities, he would never accept the fate that seemed to be haunting him, calling him: he would always be alone, after all. John was not heaven-sent, after all. He had been wrong, after all.
This information churned in John’s brain, turning to mush as he tried to reason it. “So your brother... What? Has influence in matters of government?”
“Yes,” he said quite unconvincingly. Then he did look up, a layer of his icy demeanour seeming to melt away before him. “I need to thank you, John.”
If Sherlock was an attempted guest in the village, the lot of them had agreed to slam the proverbial door in his face. Not one local would whisper, no resident would gossip, and not even the stupidest among them would be of any help to his case. Three dead in as many months and they were scurrying like cockroaches from aid.
He’d ask someone how their sleepover was and they would get angry because suddenly their girlfriend was screaming questions at them. He would make small talk and inquire about a woman’s recent engagement but she would burst into tears, calling him a jerk.
