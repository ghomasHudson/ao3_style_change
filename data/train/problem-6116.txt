“Oh! That’s what you were on about!” Then he joined Steve in search of the camouflage curtains. RDJ’s realization was quieter and he ventured a little further down the tunnel.
“I’ll get right on it.”
“So I’ve heard,” Steve nodded. At the knocking of a mallet, the room grew quiet.
Tony thought again. Tony was worrying like the world was ending and he only met Steve a week ago. Why did he feel this way? Tony mentally shook his head. He needed to focus. Loki’s spear grew brighter.
“I wish Tony recovered before me,” Steve said out of guilt. “I still don’t know what happened to him. Your father said it was my blood; my fault.”
“Ya gotov otvechat.” The Soldiers reply was muffled due to the mask that covered his mouth, but rough. Steve didn’t recognize the voice. The language was different.
"Huh, You wouldn't happen to have this nightmare before would you?" Director Fury asked as he pulled a lever behind some books. The bookshelf opened. They both went in. Shield still glowing white. The bookshelf closed behind them. In the small metal elevator they were in, there was a railing and a second door.
"Wait. What about you?"
What do you guys think of the notion Steve has?
"You don't have a pod?!" Natasha burst out shocked.
Thanks for the kudos and comments!
“You have nothing to apologize for, merman. Anyways, what is your name?”
Tony watched with worry. Frustrated that he was compromised. Frustrated that he couldn’t swim to Steve and protect him.
"My father wanted to banish you, yes. Merpeople can be… protective. But I'm in debt to you. You saved me. I... I need to repay you."
"All rise! Now is not the time for formality! This merman is not to die for me!" The Prince said urgently. The nurses swarmed the merman and laid him on a bed. They turned him on his stomach to reveal the dark red open wound from the blast that Obadiah delivered on the merman's back. There was the answer to the question of blood. The merman’s skin was burned. The melted skin was blocking the blood of the wound, keeping the blood in. For now. Nurses gasped at the sight and swarmed around gathering the necessary remedies and tools for the treatment. They hooked the merman up to a heart monitor and the beeping began.
friend,” Tony said with a cocky grin. “Tell the others about your promotion a little later when I get you a copy of the document with the Royal family’s seal -- which is in my room -- so you have proof.” Tony winked. “Anyways, exciting news aside, we should probably check on Steve." Pepper nodded, not able to wipe the smile off her face. The 2 headed to Steve where the nurses were already wrapping the wound.
As he isolated his thoughts from his tiredness, Steve felt a wave of emotion.
"JARVIS? Can you give me a layout of this part of the castle?" A hologram map appeared in front of Tony. It showed the hall and around 16 rooms branching off of it. "Put up the marks of my friends and the unused rooms." 5 names and 3 marks appeared over 8 rooms close together. "Oh perfect! Steve pick a room."
“Approximately 35 miles from the prison block.” Agent Hill answered. “What if they try to break in-?” Steve heard no more of the conversation. ‘Break in?’ Steve thought to himself. He decided not to worry. Director Fury looked like someone who could handle it.
“I thought you, Loki, and Tony should all have a say in it before anything was done. But your Father thinks it unwise to wait in light of what has happened a few days ago in the prison.”
"Am I going to be banished?" Steve looked into Tony's brown eyes. Tony could see the sadness and loneliness in Steve's eyes. Then Steve looked at everyone else. Queen Maria spoke first.
Then he’s not angry. He is grieving. It was like he lost Bucky all over again. But he couldn’t bring himself to cry. Steve thought that he probably shed all the tears for Bucky he could when he first lost him. Finally, he found the strength within himself to get up.
“My pleasure,” Steve smiled. “Wait,” Steve lowered his voice. “So Loki is in the prison block as Deceit? Is there a way to get him out?”
“Don’t tell me you haven’t threatened to banish your own son.”
See? I did as I promised. Boom. XD
He was now housing major sharp pains in his chest. He looked down at himself while breathing heavily. Tony couldn’t see the glow of the arc reactor under the small amounts of blood on his chest. (Merperson blood stuck to any solid object it makes contact within the water.)
“When I first came here. I was unconscious. But the nurses gave me a remedy that jump-started my heart. It had a side effect and I got to see a glimpse of the past. You and your son argued about my banishment.”
The water's reflection danced on the dark grey rocks of the cave. Steve looked out to the opening of the cave. Below the rising full moon, it was all ocean. Across the Atlantic. That's where the enemy lines were. Steve had tried so hard to get across to the Army base across the ocean, but he was just not good enough. It was pure luck that Steve was accepted into the army in the first place. Steve looked at his tag.
“I’ll explain later,” The merman said. “Take your ring, and focus on making it bigger. Like when you fought Obadiah. Focus on its size.” Steve did as he was told. He focused. Right before their eyes, the ring enlarged and turned into a shield.
Tony was greeted at the gates by a worried Natasha and Bruce and a smug looking Clint. Clint's and Bruce's jaw dropped, and Natasha's eyes widened as they caught sight of the shield Tony was holding.
“Many, sir.”
“Huh.” A mermaid with a dark brown tail and hair pulled up in a bun swam over to Fury.
Steve tackled the Winter Soldier and caught the Soldier by surprise, causing him to loosen his grip on the mermaid who wrestled her way out of the Soldier’s arms and was gasping for breath.
"Nightmare, Sir."
Tony swam around so he was swimming on top of Steve’s back and slipped both arms underneath Steve’s armpits and locked his hands around Steve’s chest. Tony slowly brought Steve closer to his chest to carefully fold Steve’s back-fin and began to swim as fast as he could to the castle entrance. If Tony could at least make it there, he could get some help.
She was
"We can’t talk about that here. Come with me." He turned and swam down the hall. Steve tried following but once again, forgot about his back-fin being folded in and ended up nearly face planting into the floor, defending himself with his arms. The merman turned around and gave a small "oh" noticing Steve's bandage. "Alright take the ring and enlarge it.”
“It’s fine,” Steve said. There was a red dot on King Howard’s neck.
Anger flared within him again. “He’s back then he’s gone. So he’s a hit-and-run?”
Steve thought, then said quietly, “And how did you know I was the one who intervened? As far as I know, I had a mask on.”
Tony thought to himself. He put on the ring for safekeeping. Tony snapped out of his thoughts and turned his attention to the merman.
Steve looked around. At the base of the pool, there was a tunnel. Curious, he clumsily made his way through the tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, there was a mirror-like wall and a big bolder with carving. Other than that, the tunnel was mainly empty. He first looked into the mirror out of nagging curiosity. He was extremely muscular and had gills on both sides of his rib cage. His human upper part was decorated in scattered individual blue scales. His tail was made of blue scales and gave a white reflection. He looked more closely and saw the tips had a striped pattern of red and white.
“IronTail told me.”
“My pleasure,” Steve smiled. “I should thank you for your hospitality, your highness.”
They made their way to the dorms.
“Ouch,” Steve said out of sympathy.
Just as I promised: a chapter posted later today.
Then the memories flooded back in. The attack. The fight. Obadiah. The Winter Soldier. The group. Thor’s and Loki’s tails. Tony. Bucky’s tags.
"Yeah... It's me..." Steve confirmed. “How do you know who I am?” The merman sighed.
“Who-?”
“Yes, sir. Back in the hall where we met, I enlarged the shield but why didn’t it glow blue? Why didn’t my tail change like last time?”
“Not at all. You are actually the first Patriot to be able to make the change at all, as far as I know. There are only 6 others besides yourself who can make the change that we know of.”
“We can’t tell anyone,” Natasha whispered frantically trying to shut Clint up. Bruce just put a finger to his lips with a ‘stop-talking-right-now’ face.
But before Steve got a chance to read them, he heard a scream of another man. 'Oh no! I have to help him!' were Steve's immediate thoughts. He felt an incredible determination to help this man. He grabbed the shield and pulled. It glowed blue before it was separated from its place in the rock. When the rock and shield lost contact, the shield continued to glow and Steve began to glow as well. He looked down to see his tail change color.
HAPPY NEW YEARS EVERYONE!
.” Then with a smile, she said, “He looks strong.” Pepper winked at Tony. His cheeks turned a light shade of pink.
ANYWAY:
“What should I do?” Loki asked.
“YOUR HIGHNESS?!” It was Captain Danvers.
"Yes. However, there are those who are purer — have more heart — hence, more righteous."
“Jarvis?” King Howard said confused. “Tony’s old butler? But he died.”
“My apologies, sir, I only just found the shield yesterday. And how did you know my ring was actually a shield?”
“I can’t help you there. I can’t make the change, period. You would need to talk to IronTail.”
“You seem to know so much about the shield. About my encounter with Obadiah. How do you know all this?”
“You are in no position to demand anything, King Odin.”
"No! You cannot banish him, father!" Tony said as he motioned to the nurses to go back to treating the merman. They did so.
So basically, for those of you who have been wondering about the magic in the story so far, this chapter is exactly what it was named; clarity. NOT EVERYTHING is explained in THIS chapter but I'm hoping that I haven't lost people because of unexplained details so PLEASE be patient and  BARE WITH ME! Thanks.
“We haven’t met,” King Howard gave a warm smile.
"Do you remember anything before that?" Queen Maria pressed on.
"You won't get away with this Obadiah!" Anthony yelled.
When the glow died down, they looked to see a blonde, muscular merman. His tail had changed to a lighter blue and his scales had a white reflection. The tips of his fins had the alternating striped pattern of red and white. The merman had a chain around his neck. It had a name on it:
“I didn’t know you were a prince,” Steve said thoughtfully trying to break the silence.
"Howard, let them heal this merman. You can banish him from the Stark Reef later. He did save our son's life. He saved Tony's life, Howard."
Steve thought in grief. He floated down unable to tread water any more. It was as if everything but his mind shut down as he thought the only thing he could:
“I like you. Don’t worry. There’s more. IronTail isn’t the only superhero. There is a group. IronTail is a part of it. It’s called the Avengers Initiative. It’s a group of, so far, 6 merpeople with remarkable abilities and skills. They were brought together to, for the time being, protect the Stark Pod.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, Prince Anthony!" Thor said and winked. He was one of Anthony's trusted friends. With a spear at hand, he continued to lead the charge as he and his silver scaled tail raced to the front. Loki, also Tony's friend, followed his brother with another spear and dark green tail.
“Agent Hill?” Fury addressed.
Steve mentally slapped himself for his irrational hurry.
“STOP!”
“Your Highness?”
“Yes. The Avengers…” Fury pondered on the name for a moment. “In fact, many pods believe that the change is a myth.”
“What’s going on?” Howard asked in a hushed voice. Steve’s anger turned to unease.
“Let’s get going?” Steve asked.
"It's
Steve put Bucky’s tags around his neck and peaked his head out of the infirmary door. Empty. Why? Where is everyone? He ventured out of the infirmary and down the hall. Curiosity killed the... cat? Fish? Catfish?
"Tony..." Queen Maria started.
"I-I..." Steve stuttered. "I'm trying to..."
"Yes you are, you saved me. What are you-?"
Steve’s blood was all down Tony’s abdomen and tail. Steve’s wound was creating another cloud of blood. Tony looked up when he heard a piercing shriek.
“Obadiah is a part of Hydra. He’s been manipulating you all from the start,” Steve said as they turned the corner. Steve nearly swam into the wall. “Right. No backfin. I gotta remember that.”
“The formalities are necessary so all know who the superior is, Prince Tony,” Captain Danvers said bowing deeply.
Captain of The Royal Guards. She was always shown the utmost respect from everyone. Even the Royal Family. Prince Tony was... getting there. Carol did not reply to Steve. She instead turned her back, swam towards the King’s throne, and took her seat right in between Pepper and King Howard. She smirked at Steve as she sat down gracefully as if to taunt him.
"When we arrived, the merman was fighting bravely against Obadiah Stane," Thor declared. "Our battle cries distracted him and Obadiah struck the merman."
"If you don't take my word you can ask Mr. Squid-man," Steve said pointedly. "Also... um... If you don't mind me asking... Where did you get that ring?"
Hey guys!
"You're going to pay for that merman," Obadiah said as he fired at Steve using the gauntlet. Steve dodged out of the way. The blast missing him by a centimeter. 'This is harder underwater,' Steve thought. Steve weaved through the forest of black tentacles and slammed the shield against Obadiah's back. Obadiah gave an angered roar as he turned around and fired at Steve who raised his shield again to defend himself.
“Your banishment?! Why don’t I remember? And why, above all, did I want to banish you?” The King looked genuinely concerned.
“HA! HE’S ALONE!”
“Can you fight?” She asked.
“Hey!” A familiar voice called causing Steve to turn his head, the developing anger relinquished. It was the lieutenant from earlier.
keep the Stark Reef safe, Anthony! Whether he saved you with that thing or not!"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Loki’s adopted?” Steve blurted out, eyebrows raised. “Sorry…”
ALSO, I changed the summary. Thoughts?
“You shouldn’t have to do this,” King Howard said frowning.
"H-hi... Anthony?" Steve asked as a confirmation.
"Of course Prin- I-I mean Tony," Peggy said giving a small bow out of muscle memory. "Come on girls!" Peggy led the nurses to a bed and Tony's friends helped Steve to the clamshell bed. Tony grabbed Pepper out of the crowd. Steve was swarmed by nurses and Peggy had him turn on his stomach.
"Sure, Carol,” Tony said smugly. Carol thanked the nurses and left, but not before giving Steve an ‘I’m watching you’ look. “Anyways, we need your help girls," Tony said motioning to his friends who were supporting Steve. "We found 'Mr. I-Don't-Want-To-Trouble-You' and cleared everything up. Can we get a treatment going for him?"
“Actually, only 2 of the 6--,” Fury paused for a moment and shook his head. “Now 7 merpeople that we know,” Fury corrected, “-- can make the change were actually born in the Stark pod. The rest are foreign.”
pod?”
What do you guys think? Is it good so far? I hope you're enjoying!
“You, Rogers, are the most disciplined young merman I have ever met.” Fury paused for a second. “Here,” He swam forward into the room and grabbed a small object. “This,” he said as he turned back, “is a panic button. I know you don’t need it for you. This is when you can’t make the change due to circumstances. If you are in front of other merpeople. Press the button six times, and the other 6 will come to your aid. Your identity is everything. Remember that. Click it once to signal to me that you’ve made up your mind about joining the Avengers Initiative. Alright?” He said holding the small clip-on button. Steve hesitated before taking the button and clipping it on his tags.
“Well, it would only be fair on my part. Loki and I discussed it earlier in case you should ever ask so he’s alright with it. It would explain what happened back there with my father. I think you should know.” Thor reasoned more with himself than Steve. “Well,” Thor cleared his throat. “It all started with Loki finding out he was adopted-“
No one ever spoke to her like that.
"I... I don't know. All I remember is my father abandoned my mother before I was born and then she died a few years ago... I... I've been alone ever since..." Steve trailed off. It was the truth. Kind of.
"There... There is a pod of mutated merpeople, Hydra. They roam the 7 seas and wipe out pods. Keep the Princes and Princesses as slaves and test subjects.” A moment of silence passed as Director Fury punched in a code on the panel and verified his Identity. “We do have a problem with them.” The door opened. “Especially since there has been speculation that Obadiah is from the Hydra pod. And that’s why IronTail recommended you. We need your help. With your ability to make the tail change, skill with the shield in battle, and what looks like strength,” Fury gestured to Steve, “we have more of a chance. That is if you will accept.”
"My pod? I..." Steve remembers the stories people told back home. Merpeople did indeed live in pods. He had to come up with a story. "I don't have a pod."
At first, it looked like there was nothing there. Just barren rocks and cliffs. Tony continued to swim to what seemed like right into a huge mountain. Then he passed through the entrance of the Barrier. A whole castle was revealed. Tony and the merman were showered in the light it produced. A reef full of colorful coral plants surrounded the base. The castle walls were smoothe in contrast to the great mound it stood on. It was as if the castle was carved out of the mountain that Tony saw outside of the Barrier. Tony looked back. He was surprised to see that the merman was not bleeding. Why?
“Bruce,” Steve whispered as he gently shook him. “Bruce. Wake up. Bruce.”
The merman was entangled in a squid's tentacles. Except the tentacles were connected to another man's upper body. The squid man was holding the other red and gold gauntlet. They were far away but just far enough for Steve to hear them. Steve started to swim toward them clumsily.
A scrawny, young man ventured to the cove in tears. Nothing but laughter had followed him. It echoed in the blue, moonlit cave.
“He did.”
“There you have it. Besides, I wouldn’t have told you IronTail’s identity without the Prince’s permission. He was, in fact, the one to recommend you.”
“I’ll escort myself out, sir.” Steve miniaturized the shield, put it on his finger, and turned to leave.
Bucky’s tags.
"7:30 am. Why did you wake after not even 2 hours of sleep?" Fury stuck his arm behind some books.
But the change didn’t stop there. An upper part of a suit the same shade of blue for his new tail formed around his upper body there was a white star in the center of his chest and 2 thick white strips wrapping around his shoulders aligned to the star. A mask formed around his face covering his blonde hair.
Getting over the shock quickly, Steve dove under water. 'Ok so... If I really am a mer... a merman... I can breathe underwater... Right?' Steve slowly breathed in... Through his sides? He lifted his arm and saw gills on his sides.
"What? I... 5:30 AM Tony said," Steve thought out loud, "So around 5:45, sir."
“Yeah sure. You had him on the ropes,” Steve said sarcastically as the Winter Soldier drew a knife silently from his black uniform.
"Stop calling me Anthony! It's Tony!" Tony called after him smiling. Tony's smile faded as he turned his attention to the masked merman he was barely supporting. Still holding the merman's shield, Tony raced to the Castle Barrier that lay in the reef ahead. A reef in the Atlantic? Yes. How? The royal family's inventions.
"Did you get to the part where I said, 'If you banish him, you banish me'?" Steve turned.
“I’m sorry...” Steve said for lack of a better response.
Without further ado, here's the next chapter!
This chapter is a little short but as I'm writing, this is a good place to stop. Thanks again for the comments and kudos!
Steve opened his mouth to ask why Tony, the prince of the pod, didn’t have a ring or why Loki didn’t just teleport them to the infirmary, but no words came out. Loki seemed to understand his confusion.
"Let's get you a room in the castle to stay in," Tony chuckled. Thor and Loki wrapped Steve's arms around their shoulders and the 7 of them started to make their way to the door. Pepper grabbed Tony before he left.
Shocked, Steve swam forward a little.
“The quiet type are you?” Obadiah chuckled. “You two should be best friends.” He gestured to the Winter Soldier. Steve gripped Bucky’s tags tighter. “Alright then..." Obadiah's eyes were drawn to the tags around his neck. "You know, that chain that you have around your neck, you got it from the Soldier, didn't you?" Steve nodded to hide the fact that they were actually his. "I don't understand why the Soldier keeps it. It belonged to a human he was ordered to kill years ago."
“Steve, no!” Tony yelled after him and tried to follow but Hawkeye stopped him.
"Hey, girls," Tony said innocently. All the nurses spun around and let out surprised gasps and squeaks. "Please don't bow!" Tony said quickly as they all began to bend down. "I hate the formalities of royalty..." Tony muttered.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Bruce? My son’s friend? Why?” King Howard turned to see Steve leaned against the door frame for support. “Are you alright?”
“I WANT MY SONS BACK STARK!” Odin snarled.
“Alright,” ‘Fury’ said as he opened the doors and swam into the room. Steve's shield followed hence Steve was dragged with it into the room. The room was a study filled with books and maps. “What’s your name?”
It's Thanksgiving break so don't expect updates this often.
“Please. Just call me Dum Dum, Mr. Rogers.”
“He isn’t bleeding out,” Another called out. Nurses communicate other reasons that were not the case.
"Follow Director Fury." The shield and Steve started glowing white. Steve's glow died down after a moment. It brought Steve upright forcefully and suddenly jerked him forward towards ‘Director Fury’. "Ah!" Steve exclaimed out of surprise. The ‘Director’ shushed him and continued down the hall the shield followed dragging Steve with it for a while. When ‘Director Fury’ finally stopped in front of a large set of double doors he turned to see the white glowing shield dragging Steve and cracked a smile. Steve smiled back sheepishly.
“The castle? Deserted? My boy,” Howard chuckled, “Odin is just very dramatic when he sees a servant. He normally doesn’t have to see them in his palace. This part of the castle was ‘evacuated’ so that we would all be spared from Odin’s tantrums,” Howard grinned. “The servants should be back at about 7:30 this morning.”
“You caught Deceit, one of 6 vigilantes, yet you lost my son,” Odin snarled.
“Stay if you wish,” King Howard told Steve. “But only speak when spoken to,” he warned. Steve nodded. He watched King Howard swim to his throne and take a seat next to his wife, the Queen.
"NO!" Steve got in between the 2 and raised the shield to block Obadiah's blast. The gauntlet fired and the shield withstood it. Not a scratch on it. Steve charged at Obadiah and slammed the shield against Obadiah's head. The squid's tentacles loosened. Anthony was able to untangle himself. "Get out of here!" Steve yelled at Anthony.
“Bucky’s tags…” Steve murmured. “Where are his tags!” Steve panicked. He looked around frantically searching only to realize that they were in his hand; as if they never left. Steve calmed down and began to think a little more with his head than with his feelings. Realizing that he was on a clam bed that was closed. He felt a little claustrophobic. He looked to his right and saw a remote control. It had “Open” and “Close” buttons on it. Steve pushed the “Open” button and opened the clam bed top.
“Because of this,” Steve took the dart off the nightstand and handed it to Bruce. “The Winter Soldier tried to get him with it.”
"Steve?!" Tony reached out to Steve. Steve gasped when Tony’s hand made contact with his shoulder and his ocean blue eyes returned. Steve was breathing heavy. "Steve are you okay?" Steve’s eyes flickered between Tony and the shield/ring before settling on Tony.
“We should continue this in private,” Howard said cautiously, taking a glance around the courtroom of elites of the Stark and Asgardian Pods -- who were whispering to one other.
“I can’t exactly explain. But I do need to know why the castle is deserted.” Steve said as he picked the object off the bookshelf. It was a dart. It contained red liquid in it.
“Odin,” Howard spoke in a soft voice. “Relax. Yes, my son is barely breathing because of this merman’s blood.” Howard gestured to Steve. “But it was my son’s choice. He saved this merman. This merman saved him a week before. The merman is not at fault for my son's actions.”
“I will not give my answer, Father. Not without Loki. Not without Prince Tony. King Howard is right on that matter.” Thor swam away, not allowing anyone else to speak.
out of so many tight spots with treating injuries and all.”
“Yes, it does.”
“I still want my sons back,” Odin growled.
“You are too merciful,” Odin spat out. “I shall stay here until our sons give their consents. I’ll see you at the trial.” With that, Odin left. There was a moment of uncomfortable silence.
“Here,” King Howard pointed. They entered the lab.
Also, "'The quiet type are you?' Obadiah chuckled. 'You two should be best friends.' He gestured to the Winter Soldier." Oh, I love the irony there.
"Mom don't pester him!" Tony said taking notice of Steve's discomfort.
“I like this pod,” Steve stated plainly. “If this is what I have to do to help, then I’ll do it. Besides,” Steve’s voice softened, “it’s the closest thing to home than what I’ve had for a long time.” Howard gave him a small smile. Steve’s face hardened with guilt. “Also, if it’s true that Prince Tony is barely breathing because of me, I don’t deserve any less.” Howard’s face turned solemn.
"Oh man, so what time did we actually meet?"
“I don’t think anyone really knows except maybe Queen Maria and Prince Tony,” said a voice that definitely wasn’t a nurse. Tony knew that voice well. It was Carol Danvers, the most loyal and overprotective Captain of the royal guards. Carol’s dark blue tail and bright red fins were now receiving a treatment of some sort. She brushed her blonde hair out of the way of her sharp blue eyes as she said, “But I don’t trust this new merman.” At this, Tony made a face of annoyance but quickly regained his composure. He glanced at Steve and the others who also could hear. Steve’s face showed a flash of guilt. “Something's not right about him.”
So... This chapter is short. Don't fret. I will update later today to make up for that. I started writing the next chapter and I'm really excited to share it with you guys.
"Hello, Friend Tony. Obadiah Stane is in custody," Thor said as a nurse took Loki’s arm and wrapped it with a bandage. She then went back to her original duties.
"Oh! Wait. Sorry. It’s your ring. You um… dropped it when Obadiah hit you. Here," Tony said handing him the shield/ring back.
“It seems fitting that the first of the two to wake is the foreigner,” Odin sneered. Steve automatically felt unbelievably guilty. It showed on his face. Howards face remained calm. Why?
“How about this; My son and your sons will be given your request. If there is no problem among the 3 of them, Thor and Loki may return to you and your pod and become the princes of the Asgardian pod once again.” Steve frowned.
“Get…! Help!!!” Tony barely croaked out. The pain in his chest became sharper with every word. His body went limp and he slowly fell forward. The last thing he saw was Steve’s face before he blacked out.
Steve woke with a scream. He had the nightmare about Bucky being grabbed by the tentacles again. One thing new showed up. After he yelled "Hail Hydra" and the red symbol showed up in the sky, he looked to his hands and saw the flesh was crimson red.
Tony stopped at the door. The nurses were speaking with each other in an urgent voice. Tony stopped his friends and motioned to them to be quiet.
“Your Highness, I would be comforted if You would be escorted to your destination with protectors,” Bruce proposed.
"Oh. It's you."
"Right, s-sorry," Steve muttered as he tugged at his tags nervously. "Call me Steve."
“However, my father was ashamed of Loki after everything. He banished Loki from Asgard, but I thought this wasn’t fair. It was my fault Loki was in this mess. When Odin proclaimed Loki’s banishment, I stood against it openly. I knew Odin would never go back on his word, so I told him to banish me as well. Out of rage, Odin did so and Loki and I wondered from Asgard together. In our time out in the open ocean, Hydra tried to kill Loki on multiple occasions for revenge of their army Loki destroyed. Shortly after, we accidentally swam into Prince Tony and his battalion as they were traveling to Asgard to discuss the war’s events.
When Tony saw Steve float down to the ground, he took the chance to swim to Steve faster than Hawkeye could stop him. The Black Widow came back with reinforcements.
He turned around to see another fin on the back of his tail that trailed up his spine and ended at the base of his neck which also had the striped pattern of red and white. ‘My tail is like the American flag.’ Steve smiled at the thought and turned to the bolder with the carving. Clumsily, he swam toward it and read: "When the Moon is full and the night is warm, those who swim in the water under the moon will have the goodness of their soul reflected on them and they shall turn into a creature of the sea."
Steve was so taken aback by this statement that he straightened his back in a swift and sharp movement. His back, still being sore, did not agree with this and gave Steve a sudden sharp stabbing pain to which Steve responded to with a yelp.
She was loosing. The Winter Soldier had her in a grip. He was choking her.
“With all due respect sir, I’m going to need more information than: ‘the prince you saved is actually a masked superhero’ and ‘we need your help’.” Fury smiled.
The mermaid caught her breath.
"Does Steve know about the suit?" Pepper asked.
Then he saw Obadiah. His heart pounded so hard when he saw Steve swim to the point where his back was against the wall. Then he saw the Winter Soldier and Obadiah swim away as fast as they could.
“Which room?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The last 3 words were so cold, everyone in the room could have sworn that the water's temperature dropped by 10 degrees. King Howard turned and left. The rage had not left his face. Without anyone else noticing, a merman with a black tail, black trench coat, dark skin, and an eyepatch slipped into the room and seated himself in the back.
"Mom? So... Queen?" Steve asked the mermaid. She nodded.
“I’m very sure, sir,” Steve assured. Halfway down to the dorms were Bruce and the others slept, Steve gave a small hiss of pain as he leaned on a wall for support. King Howard barely heard it.
"Thanks, Pep." Tony hugged her. "Honestly, I don’t know what we’d do without you.” Tony gave her a smile and turned to follow the other 6.
"I am so sorry..." Queen Maria said softly. "What's the last thing you remember?"
“Help me get his red, white, and blue tail to the infirmary!" Tony said. He and Natasha led as the 4 of them raced the mysterious unmasked merman to the infirmary.
Steve didn’t know.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve thought,
I've noticed that a lot of fanfiction makes Howard Stark an antagonist to Tony. I kinda broke the rules on that... Thoughts?
Steve swam after him. He knew it may not be his place. But Thor was his friend. Steve had to be there for him. Captain Danvers made an attempt to get up to stop Steve but was stopped by King Howard. She sat down. Steve nearly knocked into the door on his way out. He cursed under his breath at the bandage that kept his fin folded in. “Thor, wait!” he called. Thor did not stop. “Thor!” Steve followed Thor’s silver tail to the sparring arena that he and Loki would train in, then lost sight of him. “Thor?” Steve tried a third time as he scanned the arena.
“No, Clint. I don’t want to prank Thor and Loki while they’re training,” Bruce mumbled and turned over onto his back, his head facing the window of his room, away from Steve.
Steve could not stay quiet anymore. He was done putting up with this mermaid silently.
“I- What?!” Steve was taken aback. Even so, King Howard was calm.
“Father?” Thor stood in the doorway. “What is the meaning of this?”
“He is,” Thor agreed and smiled. “He also tried to get rid of the spear of Laufey but no matter how hard he tried it would always return to him. Though the potion wore off, there were still permanent side effects. It affected me too since I consumed the potion and the potion is magic. We gained the power of the change, as you saw us earlier. I obtained the power of underwater thunder, and Loki obtained the power of illusion. We named ourselves Thunderer and Deceit. We kept our powers to ourselves therefore, no one knew but us. Loki shield's our faces with illusion so no one would see our faces.
On the other side of the room, Tony spoke to Pepper.
"Now, Steve," Peggy said. "You know that with the fin on your back folded in, you won't be able to swim properly."
"I lost my mother, then a friend shortly after, sir," Steve answered shortly.
"Yeah. I was wearing parts of it when he saved me... Hey, Pep?” Tony lowered his voice. Pepper looked Tony in the eyes. “Can I just thank you? You’ve pulled
Steve thought to himself.

“Hawkeye you need to help her!” Steve said as he swam to Hawkeye. Tony followed.
As they all trailed out of the broken window and into the murky waters, merpeople made small sounds of horror as they swam through the battlefield that was currently littered with the floating lifeless bodies of guardsmen. Tony looked away. Steve put a hand on his shoulder. Tony looked up at Steve and gave him a small smile. His eyes didn’t reflect the smile. They looked full of loss and grief. Tony must have known some of these guards. Steve gave Tony’s shoulder a squeeze for comfort. The group stopped. Steve looked ahead.
"Hey, Are you alright?" Steve turned to see Anthony.
“Prince Tony sneaks out of the castle and isn’t provided with a ring for his return. I wasn’t provided with the ring key because I’m a foreigner like yourself and on top of it I… don’t have the cleanest of pasts...” Steve gave a weak understanding smile. He looked, if possible, even more pale. Loki looked down a flash of urgency was seen on his face and his spear flashed a green glow.
"That is one nasty mark you got. Just a poke and it hurts like hell right?" Steve nodded. "And it's an open wound. That would rate a 42 on the scale so about 3 weeks."
“Yes?”
Steve thought. If he could get the Winter Soldier to say something, maybe Steve could recognize him. “What happened to you?”
"I-I… What?" Steve stuttered, surprised Tony knew his name. “How did you..?”
“King Howard. This is not for you to decide! Not anymore. I demand-!”
"Guards! Seize Obadiah Stane!" The mysterious lone merman with the shield turned to see Anthony back with reinforcements. Obadiah took the chance to blast the distracted masked merman in the back. He let out a cry of pain and began to sink into the deep waters below. His eyes were closed. He made no sign to show his consciousness. No struggle to swim up again.
"I... I need to put this back,” Steve said fiddling with the ring.
"If you don't touch it, it'll be fine Clint," Steve chuckled sitting up. Some nurses in the back giggled. Steve tried to get up but entirely forgot about what Peggy said about his fin on his back and nearly knocked into Tony who caught him and laughed. "S-sorry!"
“Fire away.”
“Would you to come with me to the lab, your highness? This dart could be the reason for your blackouts.”
"My dear, how did you know-?"
“If not here, asleep,” King Howard said. “It is a little early.”
“When it came to war, King Laufey was ruthless and neglected his son whom he considered a runt. He left Loki to die as a baby. When the war was won, Odin found Loki near Laufey's spear — which had untold powers and is not the one Loki wields in battle as Deceit — and took Loki to raise as his son and locked Laufey’s spear away."
'There's no way...' Steve thought to himself. He took his tags off him and threw them as far out in the ocean as he could. A tear slid down his cheek. 'There's no way I'm putting up with this anymore.'
"Is that-?!" Clint started as he and Bruce swam over to take the merman off Tony’s shoulder.
"What time is it now, sir?"
Steve thought. He felt tired so, he propped himself up on a pillow. Steve laid back for a moment -- thinking, sorting out his thoughts and feelings.
“He and his father, King Howard — with the help of Friend Bruce — tested Loki and the results showed the truth. We were released. King Howard, Queen Maria, and Prince Tony asked us to return to our home. We explained who we were and why we couldn’t, that we had no place to go, and Hydra was after us because of what Loki did to the army with which he attacked with. So King Howard took pity on us and allowed us to stay. The Stark pod forgave Loki for his attack, and Prince Tony became one of the best of friends we ever had…” Thor stopped speaking for a moment. “Well, that’s our story. I thank you for sitting through it. It’s good to get something like that off the chest.”
“Yes, Mr. Rogers. However, he is not awake, sir.”
“Duty calls?” Steve asked.
resourceful. If you give him any scenario, he will use anything as an advantage. I’ve yet to find something to get him with. Then this happens. The prince all of a sudden needs saving and the merman happens to be around when Obadiah has the prince cornered.” Tony became really annoyed at this and knocks on the door before opening it.
He was In the infirmary. Steve made an attempt to get up. His back felt sore. Steve took notice of the fresh bandage that wrapped around his lower back once again. He still had his tags. The “Call Button” Fury gave him was still clipped to its chain. He still had his shield miniaturized into a ring on his right ring finger. He sat up. There was no one there. He looked around.
The 3rd merman had a dark green, black and gold lined tail. He, too, had a helmet that was gold with long horns and made no attempt to hide Loki’s face either. He had an actual cape made of dark green seaweed and he held a golden scepter.
"I'm not righteous." Steve countered immediately.
"This merman saved my life father!" Howard's expression had not changed. Rage radiated from the King's face. "Using this," Tony raised his hand with the ring shield. The King swam back in shock as the Queen moved forward by the King's side. No one but the King and Tony’s friends seemed to know what it was.
“JARVIS is an AI created by your son, your highness. JARVIS, is Bruce in his room?”
All the clam beds were open and neatly made except one. There was a bed that was closed. It was right across from Steve’s.
Steve shook his head skipping over the shield and started over. “... I heard a yell. So I sped out to help them. I saw you." Steve looked at Tony. "You were in the squid-man's tentacles and he was going to kill you."
Noticing the faces of Thor and Loki, Steve gave a small frown that added to the confusion on his face. Another contribution to the mix of feelings that radiated from Steve.
"Ah, that explains the bags under your eyes." Steve raised an eyebrow in confusion.
“Whom you cared for enough to banish?” Howard countered calmly. Steve’s eyes widened.
“Teleportation,” Tony explained shortly, “Nice job Loki,” he said quickly. “Steve. Your ring. You are the only one that has the key ring to the castle.” Steve didn’t question. He gave Tony the gear ring and Tony took it and pushed it into the keyhole and turned it.
Midterms are this coming week. Why do I procrastinate so much?
“Steve. If we don’t hurry, you’re going to bleed out,” Tony said worriedly looking down at Steve, as they swam through a steep upward tunnel. Steve looked at him dazed. He looked as if he was about to pass out. Tony had to do something.
Hello. Sorry for keeping you all waiting. I took an unexpected trip and was unable to post for a while.
Steve decided to take the offensive and punched the eye protection part of the mask off. The nose and mouth were still covered, but when Steve looked into the blue eyes of the Winter Soldier for the first time, Steve felt as if he knew the merman.
“The door to your right.”
“And you are in no position to tell me that I am in no position to demand. Not after that whole fiasco you had. With Obadiah Stane, the new foreigner that you accepted into the pod, after the breach in your barrier, after-“
“JARVIS?” Steve said as they made it to the dorm corridor. King Howard frowned.
Steve had so many questions but held them back. He knew they would all be answered when the merman ‘explained later’.
"Yes. Follow me." The guard showed him the way out. Steve was able to keep his swimming disability from the guard. They made it to the entrance. Steve thanked the guard and started to swim out into the ocean.
“Good morning Mr. Rogers, how may I assist you?” The AI interrupted.
“100.”
“I… c-can’t,” Hawkeye managed. His voice showed he desperately wanted to. “I have orders to keep you all safe. I shoot, I draw attention to us. I can’t leave you unguarded. I’m c- I’m compromised,” He said with pain in his voice.
"He was angry at me and took it out on you. I'll talk to him tomorrow or- today," Tony chuckled as he checked the clock on the wall. "5:30 a.m. already?" Tony muttered.
“Why would you want both of us back, Father? Why the sudden change of heart for Loki? Do you not remember why Loki left in the first place? Why I left?”
Wires, that were connected to weird looking machines surrounding the bed, were connected to something - or someone - in that clam bed. There was a timer on one of the bigger machines. 25:23:30 and counting down.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Bye..." Steve said quietly. He tucked himself under the sheets.
Against all odds, Tony finally managed to make it. He lay Steve down on his stomach on the floor of the castle. Tony couldn’t think straight. He became dizzy and floated down to sit next to Steve for a small breather otherwise he was going to pass out.
“Steve! Oh gosh! You’re awake! What about Tony?” Bruce asked as he sat up.
"Ok, so the names are the ones in use. The other marks are the rooms you get to choose from. They aren't in use."
“Steve Rogers, sir.”
"So I'm going to be banished?" Steve interrupted. "If I'm not welcome, then you could just tell me..." Steve fled. He tried to get out as fast as he could.
The scales made a wave from the tip of his tail to his waist and seemed to flip over revealing another side. His tail was now a darker shade of blue. His fins were the same color as the base. There was a striped section around the thigh part of his tail alternating red and white. There was no reflection.
"My pleasure, sir." The projection disappeared.
He would be a sailor on the ship with Bucky, then a storm would come. He'd look up to the sky and see a red symbol. A skull with 6 tentacles. Black tentacles would come out of the water and come towards him. He'd scream something and the tentacles would stop and turn to take Bucky. For the last 2 years, he never knew what he screamed in the dream. Last night, it was crystal clear; "Hail Hydra". He had to write it down.
"P-prince?!" Steve nearly squeaked. "I-I... Should I be bowing?"
“Your Highness!” Bruce nearly squeaked he frantically got out of bed and bowed.
“The glow in his chested stopped working,” Thor explained. “They say it is because of the rarity of the exposure of merman blood, Friend Tony did not put a shield for it. So when his chest was exposed to your blood...” Thor trailed off. “In truth, I was afraid for both of you...” he said uncharacteristically quiet. “I have not seen injuries quite like those, even in battle.” Thor’s tone then changed. “But if you woke, Friend Tony will as well!” Thor put on a smile. A moment of silence rolled over the two.
Steve pushed back against the Winter Soldier and grabbed him by his uniform and turned him around and pushed the Soldier against the rock wall. But the Winter Soldier pushed back and again, Steve was up against the wall. A chain slipped out from under the Winter Soldier’s uniform. It looked like the army tag Steve wore. Both froze.
“Will you explain what going on on the way?”
"Ok. Um... How about that one?" Steve pointed to the room next to Thor's and across from Clint.
So what do you think of the Asgardian Princes' story?
Three mermen followed the Black Widow. The first was a green-skinned merman with a ‘hulk’ of muscles. His tail was purple with a green gamma symbol on his lap. He was almost 3 times bigger than Steve.
Nurses swam around the room doing their jobs until the big double doors of the Infirmary slammed open. All turned to see the Prince and his friends holding an unconscious merman up. The nurses all bowed to Prince Tony.
The Winter Soldier let out a cry of pain and dropped the knife. It missed the ledge they were fighting over and floated down into the depths of the ocean. Steve looked the Winter Soldier in the eye and saw frustration. The Soldier charged at him again pushing Steve into the rock wall, again and again, punching Steve in the stomach. The last push against the rock wall put the pressure on Steve’s back too much and the wound opened up again earning a short but sharp cry of pain from Steve.
Tony caught up with the others who made their way to the part of the palace where their rooms were. They were waiting for Tony.
. You're gonna need to explain what the hell this is about."
“I...I thought you were him. I…I thought...” Steve went beet red with embarrassment. Tony seemed to mull it over, and then finally let out a genuine laugh.
"Go get some sleep, would ya? I'm gonna ask Jarvis when I get to Philly and if you're not in bed by then, I'm driving right back."
"Come on, cut me some slack." Tony took a swig of his soda. "I didn't get into baseball until I was already in college, when Rhodey got me interested. Of course I was gonna root for the home team when I was stuck in Boston."
worked.
tell me how that went.”
Tony had told him, clear as day, that he didn't feel like part of the team anymore.
"Wow." Tony was panting, staring at him, trying to catch his breath and wondering if he was really seeing the beautiful supersoldier kneeling before him, or if this was some delirious dream from lack of sleep.
Tony Stark. But uh...just not the one you know. It’s okay, Steve. If I know him...well...
He straightened his tie and took a deep breath in the mirror before leaving, heading straight to the quintet before he lost his nerve. He walked right in, seeing everyone already on board, except for one man.
“Well, I’m him!” Tony lit up. “Tell me all about it. We’ve still got some time to kill before I’m sent back.”
7-17-12
They sat there, enjoying the view in quiet companionship, until the sky was pitch black. Steve took his blanket and draped it over Tony. It wasn’t very cold, but he knew Tony liked to be bundled up.
“Oh. Uh, of course, yes.” Steve tried to be polite, but was scanning the room for Tony. He’d lost sight of him, and didn’t know how to get out of this conversation without just shoving her off.
Steve was so happy to have all of them.
"My favorite!" Tony gasped, "How'd you know?"
A small part of him kind of wished he’d kept the sheets on. It’s not like Tony would ever come into his bedroom again. And yes, maybe it would’ve been gross - but he already missed the smell of Tony, the feeling of waking up next to him, in the safety and warmth of his arms. He missed the assurance he felt when Tony kissed him so gently and unabashedly. Like loving him could be the easiest thing in the world. It
In his younger days, Tony might have jumped right back on Steve, could have probably gone all night with this stunning hunk. At his age, though, all he had was this blasted post-sex clarity. Fuck. He hoped Steve was still interested, even after he practically threw himself at him. Steve had just been so goddamned
The real reason he was here was a little... embarrassing. In reality, he was looking to get away from the fireworks tonight. Jarvis said they were banned in the park, so he'd carefully timed his days to bring him here today.
“I know! I know. I was supposed to finish the solar sail tonight. But my head wasn’t in it. I conked out halfway through.” Steve wondered what he was talking about - he wasn't privy to all of Tony's latest projects - but the engineer sounded apologetic, and his hand was softly caressing its way up to Steve’s shoulder, so Steve listened attentively. “And…I couldn’t stop thinking about
“So you like me because...because I’m a fuck-up?” Tony blinked.
Tony gasped and jolted awake. He felt heavy, terrified, and saw Steve Roger's face staring back at him. For a second, he thought he might be dead, when he heard another roar, and looked around, seeing Hulk and Thor standing around him as well.
"I'm sure he will. Too bad he'll miss today's game though. Seems like he really enjoyed it." Natasha replied. As she and Bruce discussed all the other sporting events the god might like, Steve was becoming more and more antsy. He should've said something last night, in person, at least then he'd have a better gauge of how their dynamic might have changed. Maybe he should have stayed in bed after all, he couldn't imagine trying to talk to Tony now, in front of everyone. But it would be much too forward to ask to visit him in his penthouse, right? Maybe he could invite Tony to his apartment. Shoot, he should have made breakfast there, so it would be just the two of them. Would it be weird to take some pancake batter up? Maybe no one would notice-
would be there.
"Nonsense. It's easy, you'll pick it up." So Tony explained the buttons to Steve, and sure enough, it was a really simple game to figure out. The supersoldier speed and reflexes probably helped, so soon Steve was being dragged around the whole arcade, putting S.G.R. on as many scoreboards as Tony made him play. As good as he was at these games, Steve didn't really care for them, but he loved seeing Tony cheer him on, fully committed to obliterating every high score in the arcade, so he gladly played as much as Tony would want.
He wondered if that made Steve back home the evil-Steve. No, of course not. Steve was a wonderful person. To everyone else. When it came to Tony, well, there was a time, long ago, when Tony basked in the warmth of Steve’s radiant glow too. Steve was his biggest fan, he remembered bringing him down to the lab for the first time. Steve was in awe, and was really the first person he’d ever met who asked him questions about his work. All the time. Not because he wanted to sell it, like Obi had, or because he needed to know when to release products like Pepper did. Steve was just genuinely fascinated with Tony’s work. And Tony liked that, he liked knowing that all his effort wasn’t falling on deaf ears. Steve would praise him whenever he showed him a new invention. Would encourage his projects and ideas. He was shy, he didn’t really ever ask for upgrades to his Captain America suit unless he really needed it, but he loved seeing all the new Ironman upgrades, would constantly ask to test them out, to spar with him, he was always by Tony’s side.
"Pals." Steve leaned back in his seat, wondering what it would be like if Tony Stark was more than just a pal.
Nat - she might look perfect, but she’s hiding some dark things, Tony. She shuts us out, is afraid of disappointing those around her, so she hides her true self. Doesn’t let anyone know who she really is.
"You know I can hear you, right?" Rhodey threw a kernel of popcorn over to the pair.
“Then how come you and I never worked?” Tony mumbled under his breath.
"You said you don't have a pod?" Tony asked. "Join the Stark pod."
“Director, we had a blip on the radar.”
PS: I know my chapter lengths are kinda inconsistent. Sorry. It won't get any better. I'll try to keep the chapters longer. ;)
"We will discuss this later,
“So am I…” Tony murmured.
“It was my choice to tell you my past as well as Tony’s when he told me a part of his. None of you said anything afterward, so I thought it wasn’t my business.”
“Steve. We need to get you to the infirmary. Your wound’s open. You’re bleeding.” Steve didn’t react at all. “What did they do to you?” Tony muttered more to himself than to Steve as he shook Steve a little by the shoulders. Still no response. “What did they do to you?”
“I am Director Nick Fury. You may call me Director Fury. Do you have any questions before we proceed?”
“Soldier?” A new but all too familiar voice said from behind the Soldier. Steve hid the tags in his fist and didn’t dare to move. It was Obadiah.
"You know, the mermen who have wielded the shield you hold have had recurring dreams. They were all warnings of enemies they would eventually have to face." Steve thought for a moment.
“This is a useless condition when there is only 1 of the 3 available to give consent of my request! Loki is missing, and your son has been unconscious in the infirmary for the past 2 days alongside the foreigner.”
"I'm sorry you all had to hear that. I'm sorry Mom. Father cannot do this to me. To my honor. If he banishes this merman, I go with him until I can repay him." Tony swam to the chair made of coral plants next to the merman's clam infirmary bed and took a seat. His face morphing from anger and disbelief to tiredness and worry. The silence in the room was almost deadly. The nurses whispered as they treated the merman.
“Um… I’ve only made ‘the change’ once and I have no idea how I did it…”
"Ah. So what are the marks?" Steve asked.
“Just as loyal as when we first got you 2 years ago. Very good,” Obadiah smiled,
HHHH I'm gonna die cuz of midterms. I may slow down a bit after this chapter cuz midterms are all of next week. But afterward... WINTER BREAK! IM SO READY FOR IT.
“We have to get him. As far as I have seen, Hydra moves fast. I’d much prefer if you came with me just in case if you don’t mind, your highness,” Steve said.
A nurse with long strawberry blonde hair held up a bottle. Another nurse, with short brown hair, motioned to her to do it. They force fed the merman as the heart monitor held a long beep signaling, the merman’s heart stopping.
“Mmn?” Bruce groaned.
"Oh, it's you." The merman said. Steve got up fast.
"U-uh I'm here?" Steve answered still on the floor. A dark-skinned merman with a black tail, a black trenchcoat, and an eyepatch swam into Steve's view. The merman's face hardened as he recognized Steve.
Tony looked at Steve’s blue eyes. They were empty. The smile Steve gave him so many times since Tony’s met him wasn’t there. He had no emotion on his face. Yet a feeling of dread and hopelessness radiated from him.
“No. I want to hear this now,” Odin hissed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peggy swam up to Pepper. “‘He looks strong’, huh? Then the Prince blushes? Are you implying something, Pepper?” She asks playfully.
“Wow. Loki is a true hero,” Steve commented in awe and perhaps a small bit of admiration.
“Steve Rogers, sir.”
Steve was a little surprised at the contact but hugged back -- fist still closed with a metal chain similar to his own in it. Loki’s green glowing spear grew into a blinding white light. Steve buried his face in the crook of Tony’s neck to block out the light. Tony shut his eyes.
“Tony, if he is joining the team, he needs to prove that he can fend for himself. Tail Change or no. Let see what he can do,” He murmured. So they watched as Steve swam at the Winter Soldier.
Steve slowed to a stop to look around.
Sooooooo? Whadayathink?
"My name is Queen Maria. Ah… A small introduction, My son, Tony," She pointed to Tony. "The brothers Thor and Loki," She gestured to the blond merman with longer hair and a silver-scaled tail with a red reflection and the merman beside him, who had raven black hair and a dark green tail with a gold reflection. "Clint and Natasha. They are also siblings," she pointed to a fawn brown haired merman whose tail was purple with a black reflection and a mermaid with red short hair and a blood-red tail also with a black reflection. "And finally Bruce." She pointed to a lean merman with brown hair and a lighter green tail with a purple reflection. "Now my question, are you alright?" She pressed.
“Who’s there?!” Odin snarled.
"We all are sleeping in so sleep tight. G'night!" Tony winked and left Steve in his room.
“Why would you think that?”
Steve started clumsily swimming with no idea what to do.
“Tony said that his father, the King, doesn’t know about his suit hence, he doesn’t know Tony is IronTail. Does the king know about the group?”
BOOM. Can I just pride myself on that ending? I really liked it. (Sorry XD. That was a little narcissistic and arrogant.)
Steve thought.
P.S. - IF YOU ARE CONFUSED ON A PART OF THE STORY; Please let me know in the comments so that I can do my best to fix it and make it the least confusing I can.
"But Pepper, how do you know-?" The short-haired brunette nurse asked but was interrupted by Pepper again.
The infirmary doors slammed open again. The nurses all bowed. It was the King and Queen.
“Is it common to be able to make the change?”
"Yes, sir, almost every night for the last 2 years, sir." The Shield stopped glowing when Steve took hold of the railing for support.
“Got it, Steve,” Bruce said as he rapped the dart in seaweed. “Be careful. Both of you.” He gave a quick bow to King Howard then swam off to the lab to analyze the liquid in the dart.
Tony remembered that he found out a lot of the new proclamations through the nurses' gossip and rants. He opened the door a little bit and peeked through.
(See the end of the chapter for
“STEVE!” Tony yelled when he reached Steve he floated down next to him. “Steve?” Tony said softly. “Are you ok?” Steve didn’t respond. He didn’t even look up.
“The group? The Avengers?”
"What happened 2 years ago?"
“Steve,” Tony spoke softly. “Steve you have to help me.”
"No... You said that?"
“Speaking of pasts, I find it curious that after sharing your full past with us you asked us nothing of our pasts in return,” Thor thought out loud.
The second merman had a dark metallic gray tail with 6 lighter pads that made the tail look like armor. He had an enlarged bright red back fin that made it look like a cape. He held a hammer and had a silver winged helmet. Thor’s face was seen clearly under the helmet.
The next time Steve woke up, it was to some light kisses on his cheeks, and warm hands tapping his chest. He didn't need to open his eyes to know exactly who was in his bed this time, and he couldn't help but smile, pulling the offender closer and nuzzling into his hair.
"Um...I was thinking...you said whenever I was ready and...I think I'm ready. Maybe we could dry off and take this into the bedroom?" He nervously suggested. They had discussed it, as much as Steve enjoyed giving head, and he REALLY enjoyed it, they decided to have sex only when Steve felt ready.
Tony was beaming. His eyes sparkled with delight. It was so, painfully clear to Steve that this Tony was wholly, unbearably in love with his Steve.
"I...I've got to...um, I'll be right back. I'll see you at dinner, yeah? Bruce is making...something, I don't know. But you'll be there, right?" Tony frantically gathered his jacket and phone, scrambling towards the back of the lab.
with you. But I understand if...if it's just not in the cards." Tony didn’t say anything, but he closed the gap between them, letting Steve wrap an arm around his shoulders and pull him close to his side. They sat together for a few minutes, letting Steve’s words hang in the air. The weight of Tony’s body against Steve’s, the steady assurance of Steve’s arm on Tony, it knocked their walls down, all their barriers, all their inhibitions crashing around them.
"I'll miss you too." Tony leaned back into Steve's hand, which had made its way to the short hairs on the other side of his neck. Then he was leaning forward, and closing his eyes. Poor Tony must be exhausted, after this long weekend. Steve took the hint and wrapped Tony up in a hug. The other man stiffened. He...must not have been expecting that? Surely Steve wasn't taking this too far, they'd been so close all weekend. But after a second, Tony's hands found their way around Steve too. It felt...wrong, out of sync. Like Steve had missed something, some clue. They broke their awkward hug and Tony smiled his best press smile. Steve could tell he was looking a little disappointed through it. All the same, Tony walked up the stairs, turned around to wave goodbye, then the doors closed and the jet was tugged onto the strip and took off. Steve watched until it was just a dot in the sky, then it was gone.
You kiss babies and help old ladies cross the street and everyone loves you. The team loves you. The team is happy to follow you to the ends of the earth - because you’re an amazing leader with or without me. You’re like, the picture-perfect boy scout and soldier and hero. And I’m….well I...I don’t fit in. I’m nothing like you guys. I met Other-Steve when I was in the mirror dimension.”
"So we had just gotten off the bike."
“He doesn’t have

They were silent for a while, until Tony quietly spoke up again.
“Oh, Lord. I better supervise.” She followed him to the bar.

is in charge. I’m only co-leader on paper, to keep the UN happy. He’s the real leader here.”
"Oh….oh baby…fuck, yes!" Tony moaned as Steve explored Tony's opening further, taking small cautious licks at first, then delving in. Steve had wondered what Tony would taste like down there, and to be honest, it didn't really taste like much of anything but clean skin - he
“Tony?” Steve interrupted. He knew Tony would go on all day if he didn’t remind him that he wasn’t a physicist.
"Hey." Steve asked once he was feeling okay, "When's your birthday?"
"Need any help getting to bed?" Tony asked, looking up at Steve with wide eyes. God, Steve would've loved to say yes. Maybe Tony would help him change. Maybe tuck him in. Maybe he'd see that Steve missed him so much, and offer to stay. Cuddle. But no, he was so tired, he couldn't trust himself to do the right thing right now.
“Nah.” Steve picked Tony up in his arms, carrying him back into the bedroom. He loved that Tony was so pliant, letting Steve pick him up whenever he wanted, without fuss. “We have to become a close-knit group before we can do all that, right? So a day to just hang out is the perfect team exercise.” Steve loved hearing Tony’s little giggle as he finally let him down in Tony’s closet. He hooked his chin on Tony’s shoulder, watching him pick out clothes for the day. “Unless you have any objections?”
“Oh, Tony. It doesn't matter.” Steve said. "How could I be upset with you when you're
“Hey, uh...I like you...too?” He told his shampoo bottle. Ugh, no. That sounded stupid. “Look, Rogers. I know I've been a dick since you got back, but...that was my mistake. We used to be friends. Can we go back to that?” His echoing voice sounded desperate and broken against the tile walls. No - that wasn’t right either.
"Are you drunk? Maybe we shouldn't-"
It was almost a month later before they told each other how they really felt.
"Don't worry, we'll walk it off first." Tony got up and pulled Steve up with him. "Our ride is here!" He dragged Steve over to a towncar that had just pulled up.
"Stop! I don't- I can't-" This new world, he didn't know anyone. Bucky wouldn't shake his hair and punch his arm in a playful way ever again. He'd never get another letter from Peggy. He wished Bucky was here. He wished his ma was here. Someone he knew. Anyone familiar. Now he was freezing cold. He was so cold, for so long. Why am I here? Why me? Why is this happening-
Natasha nodded and the quinjet came to life, it would be a short flight to D.C. What would he say? Would Tony cause a scene? He remembered seeing Tony again for the first time after Siberia. He had the same sick feeling in his stomach. How did he keep finding himself in this situation? He was always letting down the man he looked up to the most.
"Uh...you want honey in your...coffee?" Tony was puzzled but took out another spoon.
"Goodnight Winghead."
been out. He would go to those horrible company parties with you just because he knew you hated them so much, and wanted to make your night a little more bearable. He came running back the moment you called him, without hesitation. You said so yourself - he’s tried time and time again to talk to you since he's been back, he's even called to ask
It was coming to an end, but neither made a move to pull away. Instead, Tony spoke up.
"I've never been there before, but it sounds like nice family bonding time." Clint gave his thumbs up. Steve was so relieved.
, if last night is anything to go by.”
"Valet's got it, don't worry." Steve turned around and sure enough, someone in a suit was taking his bike around the corner. "Come on. They've got the best enchiladas, though the tacos are to die for too. I think we should get you both."
to amend the language eventually." Tony pouted. "We needed it signed as quickly as possible. Of course the first draft wasn't gonna be perfect."
"Guess you're right." Steve walked over to a nightstand, picking up a phone identical to the one Tony was always tapping away at. "So this is the telephone you were telling me about?"
Steve woke up to a knock at the door.
Steve pulled back a bit, relieved. "We won." It was all that needed to be said. But Tony could never leave it at that, especially when he was still running on adrenaline and nervous energy.
Somehow, he got through some semblance of a conversation, until Steve asked if he was coming upstairs. Tony decided that he needed to stay in the lab. Steve was such a good person, nice, kind and had trusted so much in Tony. He opened himself up to be friends, and had even come to Tony for help, without fear of being ridiculed.
universe.” He teased as he wiggled his right hand over his bicep. Tony noticed a ring. Clearly a wedding ring.
"Try it, babe. I'm telling you, artichokes go great with spinach and loads of cheese." Steve held up a slice to Tony, who rolled his eyes, but took a bite anyways. He tried to hate it, he really did, but...ugh! Somehow, it did taste delicious.
"Sure. I'll be there." Steve watched as Tony ran out the back door, towards the garage. He wondered if he'd crossed some line, but it was just as likely that Tony really did have to suddenly go do something. The man was as unpredictable as the weather. Steve turned around to head back to the elevators when he spotted his Captain America helmet sitting next to the gloves Tony was working on. It was sleek, updated. Looked futuristic and simple at the same time. He turned it and saw his wings on the side, the same style as the ones on his bike helmet that Tony made for him not long ago.
"He's being modest." Pepper interjected. "He was amazing, Tony. It went better than we ever could have hoped for. I don't want to make any promises, but if the board votes yes tomorrow, you know who to thank."
When he walked out of the bathroom, he was hit with the unmistakable scent of...sex. He looked to his bed and it was a sticky mess. Right - how had he forgotten already? Other-Tony had told him, right before he left, to get his sheets washed. He pulled the sheets and cover off and threw everything down the laundry chute. After putting on fresh bedsheets, he laid out and stared up at the ceiling.
"Nah, no one will recognize you this way. Let's go." Steve led them outside, where they walked seemingly in a random direction. After just a block, Steve found what he was looking for.
"We...slept together?"
"Ah." Steve leaned back and closed his eyes. May. Too bad that just passed. Maybe he could give Tony a late birthday present. It's only a couple months late. Wait. May? Steve thought back, he was at the tower already in May. He didn't remember any party for Tony. His eyes went wide with horror.
“So, um…” He’d been too nervous and too busy to ask earlier, but well, it was now or never. He didn’t know if he’d ever get the chance to come back and ask again. “How did you and Tony end up together?” The question made Steve light up with excitement.
"Great idea, Jarvis. Thank you." Steve smiled and jumped up, heading back down to the communal kitchen. Thankfully there were a lot of leftovers from Bruce's cooking, and Steve grabbed the cake he hid earlier, threw everything in some bags and headed to the elevators. He bounced on his heels on the way up, a bit nervous about seeing Tony, but they had been talking for weeks now! So it's okay, right? I mean, it was only through text and a few times through video calls. But, it wouldn't be weird now that it was in person, would it? No, of course not, everything was fine when we hung out in LA. Shoot, maybe I should have asked first if I can come up. Maybe I should stop at my floor and give him a heads up-
TW: A small insinuation to thoughts of suicide. Not major, but it's there.
"Really? The Red Sox? Aren't you from Manhattan, though?" After a while, they had taken residence on the stools facing the stadium, where they could see the whole field. Facing the windows, he felt like he could ask Tony anything without fear of being interrupted. To his surprise though, the rest of the team seemed to be intent on leaving them be.
Tony's hands slowly came out of his pockets and hovered over Steve's waist for a moment, before reluctantly landing instead on his shoulder blades with a light pat.
Once the elevator doors opened to the roof, he realized he had the same observatory as the one back home, and he had a great view of the night sky to compare to his own universe’s star formations. He saw a backwards Leo constellation right away, which was a good sign that everything was in order, but he’d need to look for some deep space stars to make sure all the measurements were correct.
"Everyone who recognized me these last few weeks recommended movies and music I should listen to, you know, to catch up with the times. An old couple recommended I watch LOST." He knew he was goading Tony on, in reality most people had warned him to stay the hell away from that show, as it wasn't worth the time. "They said it has a satisfying ending."
Steve took a good look at Tony. He looked...worn out. Hair disheveled from raking sweaty hands through it, eyes red and dry from overuse, and he was still in his full suit that he left in this morning, as rumpled as it was. He was stretching himself too thin, and Steve just wanted to pull him close and pet his tired head until he got some rest, but instead he walked over, careful not to kick over a pile of books on the way, and set up the TV tray on the bed next to Tony. He wondered if Tony would even eat, even notice he was there, or would mind if Steve fed him, took care of him. He was about to open his mouth to say something, anything, when Jarvis spoke up again.
"Ha Ha!! Stop Tony!" His sadness washed over him. He would make the most of it, the time he had left with his friend. If he only had one night with Tony, he certainly didn't want to share it with anyone else. He'd had more than enough company of strangers over the last several weeks. "No dancers, no massages. Let's just hang out together tonight, if that's okay."
As he sat on the back porch of the cabin, overlooking the lake and the huge moon peeking up through the mountains, he wondered what Tony was doing. Hopefully not still working. He's so close by, but I should leave him to it. I'll see him tomorrow. I wonder if he can see the moon from wherever he's at, it looks gorgeous tonight.
Steve was too keyed up to stay in Vegas any longer, having woken up at the crack of dawn feeling invigorated. He checked out and jumped on his bike, excited to make his way to LA today. He would be a day early, but figured he could kill some time by getting to know the city.
Could he? No. He couldn't even consider it. He was Captain America, for God's sake. He knew he was a high profile person, and it's only been a fluke that he hasn't been recognized more often on this trip. Realistically, he was aware that Jarvis could probably find him somewhere private, discreet. Tony had even encouraged it! Or was that a joke?
mean a lot to me, Tony. And I’m here
"No! No, of course not. It's not that I don't appreciate...shit." Tony pulled over a chair and sat down. "It's my fault. I should've explained how this stuff works."
The shield rattled as he set it down on a table.
“Oh Steve!” A shrill voice stopped him in his tracks. Tony must’ve heard it too - he turned his head just slightly to see who was calling out for Steve before going back to his own conversation.
“No!” Tony shot up, apparently offended at the question. “Of course not.” He huffed. Shoot, was Tony not drinking anymore? Steve wasn’t sure, they hadn’t exactly talked very much since...well since before Siberia really. They had spent time together after the reconciliation last month, of course, but it was always around the others, and the subject hadn't come up.
He looked around the room for the time. 6:37 A.M. Why was there no night shift nurses around? Or day shift nurses for that matter? Steve decided to check outside of the infirmary doors. Might as well just ask for help from a passing guard. Besides, who would be awake at this time? He shouldn’t attract too much attention.
“I’m fine. My back’s sore,” Steve brushed off. “Why Bruce? He has an interest in this kind of stuff. Also, because of Obadiah’s case, I can’t trust other staff with this,” Steve said. “Sorry.”
He got out of bed and swam as fast as he could to the door. Swerving to the sides at times but he made it he barely pulled the door open and clumsily slipped through the door. Then something smacked him in the back right on the spot.
"My dear hasn't your pod told you that humans are dangerous?" Queen Maria asked with concern in her eyes.
“Is that a no?” Obadiah asked. Obadiah frowned and swam forward toward Steve. Steve’s back fin folded in as Steve backed up even further. His back was now pressed against the wall. Steve had nowhere to go. He was trapped. “Huh. You have guts to turn us down like this. I like you.” Obadiah winked before addressing the Winter Soldier, “Soldier,” he said as he turned around. The Winter Soldier turned to leave and both he and Obadiah swam away and out of sight, probably faster than Clint would be able to say, ‘well that was fishy.’
"Alright. Let's get you settled, shall we?" As Tony led Steve into his room, Steve's face filled with worry. "What's up, Steve?"
“Speaking of ‘anything for my best friend’, I asked Father for something a little special for you -- before the whole argument happened so it’s already written in stone until you die. Or get fired.” Tony said. Pepper frowned in confusion. Then, Tony gave a small respectful bow, “Doctor Virginia ‘Pepper’ Potts, Honorable Physician of the Royal Court.” Pepper gasped.
"A 42 on the scale?!" Clint whisper-yelled. The others made surprised noises. "You know how rare that rating is for merpeople?! It must really be bad, huh?"
“Lead the way,” King Howard said still getting over the name of the AI. Steve opened the door to Bruce’s room. The room’s main theme was a calm dark green. It was also decorated with green seaweed plants. The desk was covered in work papers. Steve swerved as he swam to Bruce, who was sleeping calmly on his stomach, facing the entrance of the room, in the clam bed that had the same colored dark green sheets.
"When did you fall asleep last night?" Fury asked with a grin on his face.
“What? Steve, how did you- do have a magic touch or something? Or like an aura?”
“GET BACK HERE, VIGILANTE!” All of the guards followed Loki. Tony turned to Steve. The cloud of blood was now starting to envelop Steve’s shoulders and waist. He looked tired and dazed. Pale was now an understatement. They had to hurry. They began to make their way through the gate and into the tunnels that led to the castle above.
Now Steve had enough. He wished Bucky could come and comfort him. To tell him to get off his sorry ass and try again. Try harder. But Steve was well reminded by his nightmares that Bucky was gone. Gone in a storm overseas. ‘Taken by some squid monster and drowned,’ the survivors said. ‘Drowned or rescued and taken prisoner by pirates.’ Steve didn’t know what to believe.
He finally took notice of his broad upper, mainly human, self. His arms were muscular. He curiously poked at his biceps to make sure he wasn't dreaming. 'No, they're real…’ Steve confirmed to himself, bewildered.
“Tony told me he had a suit. I saw him wearing it… well… pieces of it. He never said he had a secret identity.”
“Why don’t you trust the merman, Captain?” Peggy asked.
"Your father doesn't seem to be fond of foreign merpeople... He um..." Tony sat Steve down on the bed.
“GET HIM!”
Wow! Thank you so much for the Kudos, comments, and views! It's more than I thought I'd get. I know this is a shorter chapter. I promise I'll post something tomorrow or even later tonight. I'm on a roll today -- writing wise -- and I'm always excited to share my writing as soon as it's done!
Tony thought to himself. Natasha, Bruce, and Clint all went into different rooms in the hall. Thor and Loki led Steve to a wall and Steve was able to support himself and did the same. "Hey JARVIS!"
“You may not have them until all of our children have had a say in this, Odin!” Howard repeated in annoyance. At that, the front doors of the throne room flew open.
"Alright! Finally!" Tony said excitedly. "We're in a part of the palace that Father allowed me to install JARVIS in! You guys can go and finally rest. It's been a long day. I'll help Steve out." Everyone nodded.
“It worked!” They heard Loki say excitedly. Then Loki began to pant, “My,... that… took a lot... out of me.” They came apart and looked around. They were at the gate of the castle.
Who's also ready for winter break?
"Where is Laufey's spear now?" Steve asked out of curiosity.
There, in the middle of the new room was a rock. Embedded in it was a red, white, and blue shield with a white star in the middle. Around the room there were statues but Steve didn't pay much attention to them. Steve made his way to the shield. On the rock it was embedded in, there were more words carved.
“Anything for my best friend.”
“When Loki freed himself of Hydra’s grasp, he called for a retreat. He dared not to return the army. Instead, he led the army to its demise.”
His eyesight was growing darker.
“You don’t remember any of it? Has this happened before?” Steve was now concerned for the King.
he saw Bucky get grabbed by the tentacles. Strange...
“We need Bruce Banner,” Steve said quickly
"I can't..." Steve said to himself as more tears made their way down his cheeks. He dipped his feet in the water, buried his face in his hands and cried for who knows how long.
"Aahhsssss!" He tried to keep himself quiet for the others who hadn't woken up yet and his outburst came out as a hiss. He fell to his hands and tail and turned around just in time to see the doorknob click in its place.
“Let’s see,” Steve said. The mermaid opened her mouth to protest, but the Winter Soldier swam at Steve, attacking him. Steve avoided the knife. The Winter Soldier swung the knife at Steve again and Steve blocked it. He tried to disarm the Soldier by holding the Soldier’s arm back but the Soldier dropped the knife and caught it with his metal arm and proceeded to try to stab Steve again. The 2 mermen danced around like this for a while. The Soldier's knife skills were superb.
“I’ll need time,” Loki said, then he turned around and raised his spear. It began to glow a warm green. Tony turned back to Steve, who was creating a cloud of red behind him with his open wound.
“I… I’ll have to think about it… I’m… not on the best terms with the king. He doesn’t trust me. IronTail told me that the king was angry and took it out on me but-“ Director Fury interrupted Steve’s pointless babbling.
"You have moved passed that Loki. We have all forgiven you," Queen Maria said kindly. "I must go now. Your King, Howard needs to be persuaded."
“No, I’m serious.”
He looked back at the remote control. “Is there a nurse help button on here or something?” He wondered aloud. Steve couldn't find one. He looked around his bed. Nothing. He didn’t want to wander out of the Infirmary in fear of running into unwanted attention. The call button Fury gave him should only be for emergencies.
“Also, the castle has heat sensors with the ability to ID merpeople so anyone who left through the gates. Those same merpeople must come back through the same gates. Otherwise, they are considered an intruder,” Tony added as the gates opened.
"Seriously?" Sam rolled his eyes. "You're such a dumbass."
The next time he drifted back, he was hugging his pillow. Feeling just as nice as before, but able to form thoughts now, being a little more awake. He didn't want to get up just yet, so he nuzzled his nose into his fuzzy pillow, trying to shield his eyes from the sun. Hmm....were pillows supposed to be fuzzy? He didn't know, but it was radiating warmth so he didn't really mind. Then the pillow cuddled back into his neck, and let out a little sigh. Huh. Pillows didn't usually do that. The pillow started to snore, little puffs of air tickling the skin under his ear. Okay, wait.
"Aw, that's okay. There'll be plenty of baseball to watch. I'm okay just doing this." Steve turned Tony over, pushing him into the couch cushions, nuzzling into him. The handsome genius laughed, and didn't stop his relentless attack. Steve let his hands roam, feeling every curve of Tony's supple body, enjoying every kiss that he was gifted. He didn't know how much time had passed when he heard the elevator doors open.
"Label looks all weird." Tony called out as he ran the sink. Steve didn't know what he could mean. It was the same, name brand toothpaste he'd used since he arrived in this century. “Ow! What the hell, your water’s so hot. Pipes must be running too close down here.”
"I'm fine!" Steve looked like he might combust any second. He
The elevator doors opened and he hurried to the portal. The machine started its power-up sequence when suddenly, Tony realized - once he stepped through, Other-Tony would instantly be pulled over the threshold back here. They couldn’t occupy the same universe at the same time, after all. But he had no way of knowing if Other-Tony was in the lab right now, seeing how the mirror dimension had gone off course, and he still didn't even know why. He’d gotten immensely lucky last time - if Other-Tony had been in another room at the time - much less another state or country - the force of space pulling him into the coordinates of the portal might’ve killed him.
just saved all their asses. But seeing that smile, Tony's heart started to slow down, and his tense muscles relaxed - he knew that he needed to keep living, if only to see it again.
“No, thanks. Not really that hungry.”
So Steve told him. Everything. From the awkwardness of trying to learn to work together as a team, to finding out about Bucky and Hydra, to Ultron, to the bombing in Vienna and the horrible climax in Siberia.
"Tony. Hey." Steve's heart jumped a little at that nickname. His brain helpfully supplied him with memories of last night, Tony sweetly calming him down with names only his ma had ever called him. It's not that he didn't like being Cap. He didn't mind all the nicknames the team came up with, actually. But, well...it had felt really nice, all things considered, Tony's words washed over him like a warm breeze at the end of that horrible experience, lulling him to sleep. Now, he was back to being just Cap.
It was clear that Steve didn’t have any reservations about their relationship. He didn’t seem to want to hide it, he happily held Tony close, smiling wide as wandering fingers trailed mindless doodles over his chest. Tony didn’t want to hide it either - he wanted to shout it from the rooftops, wanted to stamp “PROPERTY OF TONY STARK” in permanent ink all over Steve, but right
, not Captain America, could light up a room, light up his whole life, without even trying.
"Fuck!" He gasped as he suddenly came. He tried to bring his other hand up to catch his come, but couldn't pry it away from twisting in the sheets when another orgasm hit in quick succession and come landed all over his undershirt. His body went boneless, all his muscles relaxed. He lazily squeezed the head a little, watching the last bead of white slick drip out.
Pepper said he needed to play nice and come to this Tech Expo. The expo itself hadn't been too bad - lots of promising ideas from eager, brilliant, scrappy grad students, in fact. He was seriously considering funding some of the projects. But he really didn't want to be at the after-show social right now. They were playing great music, but everyone here was either an industry leader, or a grad student, and as much as he wanted to join the dance floor, he didn't like
“I’m not leaving you again. I mean it.” Steve moved a little closer. Tony didn’t move away. “I’m sorry for everything Tony. I know it’s no excuse, but I was so afraid of disappointing you. I thought, maybe, if I could just find Bucky, just
"Nah. Got plenty of signed baseballs in Howard's collection. Feel free to take whatever you find if you want to go to the mansion sometime."
We didn’t find out the truth until after...after we did
"Hey."
“You’ll what?” Natasha asked as she snuk in from behind them, followed by Clint.
"They're saying it won't make the shareholders money. But I'm not doing it to make money though..."
“I’ll knock you off your feet, Rogers.” Tony promised. Steve walked back inside, leaving Tony to watch the skyline below. He kicked his feet out over the edge, swinging them back and forth gleefully. He hadn’t felt this exhilarated in years. He stayed out on the roof a little longer, thinking of all the places he could take Steve. Would he like a nice, quiet restaurant? Or maybe a baseball game, he’d have to check the schedule for tomorrow. They used to talk about taking Steve out dancing someday - maybe he could find a ballroom somewhere that operated on a Monday night. Hell, he had enough money to
"You know, like a trial run. Are you planning on taking a special girl there on a date, and wanted to scope it out first? If so, it's a nice place. I bet she'll love it. I sure did." Tony was peering at their shoes as they walked to the elevators, but Steve could feel him holding his arm just a little tighter.
"I mean, what happened to me yesterday? It seems like you might know." Steve tried to explain, "I've never felt like that before. I was so worried about nothing all day. Weird, like I couldn't focus on anything, and my heart was racing a lot and I felt so much dread. Then last night, well, you saw."
“No...no.” Tony’s expression steeled. “You must have me confused with someone else. That’s not...that’s not me.”
"Steve, I couldn't ask the team for such a big favor.."
"I know it seems like they're all against you." Steve walked over to the elevator, Tony following after grabbing his bag from the couch. "And maybe they are. But you've got us now. Your team, the Avengers. And we'll help any way we can, okay?"
“You don’t have to talk to him, Fri.” Tony barked. “Run a scan and tell me who
then he'd shoot a pack down to the dugout for the team!"
What she meant when she said it was a shame that he always put Pepper first in their relationship. Tony
“Because the moment I tell him, he
He shook this thought away. No. He really couldn't go and fall for the guy. Straight as an arrow Steve? Not a chance. He sighed as he walked over and flopped back on the couch.
"Yes, Captain?"
"The...the dark ones. You hated them so much you put little crying faces. You were right, they're a little low on the waist, but Barton made us buy them anyways. Don't worry I won't wear them," shit, he was talking about these stupid pants instead of apologizing about breaking his trust. "But really, I'm so sorry Tony. I didn't mean to look. She was just showing me what texting was, honest. Please don't be mad at her, I'm the one who asked!"
the best idea after all.
"I guess." Tony slouched down. He wasn't so sure about that, but he supposed he could give it a try.
"No! I mean
"SHIELD's had him for months, Tony." She pointed out. "They did a whole program to catch him up, and I'm sure he's learned things along the way." She placed a hand on his phone. "Jarvis can take care of him for now. Why don't you let the man get settled in. I'm sure he'd rather hang out with you in person anyways, instead of a bunch of notes."
"Where you were holding him through the entire ride."
"I'm not a superstar, Tony." As annoyed as he had been a moment ago, he couldn't help but smile wide, he hadn't expected to see Tony today at all. "I really didn't need the royal treatment just to get here."
"You know, Thor left for Asgard last night. He said he would be back by the end of August though, I'm hoping I can convince him to help me with a few more experiments before we leave for Tajikistan." Bruce made light conversation as they worked.
“Shut up.” He tried to make an angry face at her, but after a second his smile bled through, and they found themselves laughing out loud. “Oh god, he knows what my
"Here. It's not a vegetable. Trust me, you'll like it." Steve held up the bite, following under it with his other hand so it wouldn't spill. Tony didn't argue, he just opened wide, accepted the food, his beautiful lips curling around Steve's fork, and hummed in approval. Steve got such a rush, a pang of arousal running through him at feeding Tony. He really needed to slow this down, he would surely embarrass himself if he kept this up.
Being with Tony was easy, so much easier than being teammates, or friends. It’s like he was made for this - to be Tony’s.
Everyone was having a blast. Thor even decided to stay a few more days so he could learn about the sport. Bruce was happy to explain all the rules and regulations to the god, Thor interrupting once in a while to run out the front door, dragging a flustered Bruce behind him, to join the rest of the fans in an occasional cheer or chant. Clint and Natasha were taking full advantage of the bar, and although everyone was witness to Natasha finishing at least a couple beers an inning, she didn't seem to waver one bit. Clint, on the other hand, was just drunk enough to heckle both teams, apparently not aware that neither batter would hear him through the window.
“That’s too bad.” Steve took a seat next to him. “You should ask Steve out. He would say yes.”
, what, they couldn't at least spring for Netflix? Are those heathens at SHIELD trying to catch you up one decade at a time, or what?"

"There's no other time. The bride and family are secure, the goons will get suspicious soon. Get under that skylight, NOW Stark. " Natasha left no room for discussion.
"Jarvis?" Steve wasn't sure why the AI wouldn't open the door.
today.
"Ha ha. I tried to tell you. I tried telling you a lot of things, actually. Sorry it took me so long." Steve was on cloud nine, finally on a real date with Tony.
See you all next time! (Soon, hopefully!)
While Tony rambled on, Steve put the helmet down on the bike, and then wrapped Tony up in a big hug to shut him up. Tony froze, eyes wide as Steve pulled him close.
As Tony worked on the bike, he kept mumbling all the reasons Steve just wasn't ready to leave yet to Dummy.
“No. You can stay.” Tony whipped his head around excitedly, but Pepper held up a finger. “I only have one stipulation. You need to be honest. What is going on with you? Rhodes told me about Steve. How he had sex with...your twin from another timeline or something.”
Tony threw an arm over his face. "Thanks, J." Well, if anything, at least he knew Steve was set to face the 21st century.
Wait. Were they staying at the same hotel tonight? Steve wondered as he was shoved into the backseat of the car, Tony crawling in after him. He must've been quiet a bit too long while mulling this over.
"You...need to tell me something? What's up?" Tony looked up at him with his big doe eyes, and Steve sucked in a shaky breath, not sure how to phrase this.
They laughed and talked, and at the end of the night, after they'd ordered takeout to eat while watching world class cooks duke it out on Iron Chef, Steve made Tony promise to come back tomorrow so they could watch the end of that season, he really wanted to know who would win. Tony huffed a
"Positive." Steve placed a tender kiss to Tony's lips before turning the water off and grabbing a fluffy towel, smiling when a giggling Tony squirmed under his groping, lightly patting and rubbing his skin dry. While Tony grabbed some lube, he quickly toweled himself off too, and followed Tony to their bed, squeezing handfuls of soft, silky skin along the way. They fell onto the sheets, their kisses becoming more heated, hands roaming lower, until soon Steve found himself on his back, tightly holding Tony's thighs, trying to rub his hips up against the other's.
“He said he was sorry for trying to hurt Bucky, said he knew it wasn’t his fault, but he couldn’t control himself in the moment. He asked Bucky for forgiveness, and it seems like they're okay now. He helped Shuri - the scientist from Wakanda - fix Bucky’s mind and his arm. He even invited us all to come live in the tower. Said it would be good for the team. But, still. Every time I try to talk to him alone, he finds an excuse to leave, or avoids me altogether. We were such good friends before all this.” Steve said.
"Whatever you're thinking right now, please let it go, darling." Steve's big hand caressed his cheek, and Tony nodded, blinking away tears, wondering how Steve knew every time Tony doubted himself. "I've always been yours, Tony. I'm sorry it took me so long to tell you. I love you." Tony's eyes shot open. "And I'll work every day to convince you of that. Even if it takes me a lifetime. I'll show you, over and over again, that I love you."
"Haha, yeah. Stuck in that shell of yours. Even when you aren't in the Ironman suit, you just put on a work suit. Stuck, see?."
Steve, you know. That’s the only reason the team even signed the New Deal.”
"I can't just
"I'm sorry, we have to
"Yeah." Tony smiled and kissed back. "I think I could stomach some veggies if you're the one feeding them to me." Steve smiled against Tony's lips. He could definitely do that.
“What’s wrong, baby?” Steve easily maneuvered around him, wrapping him up in his arms, clearly concerned. Why the hell was this Steve kissing him?? Were he and Steve
“Oooooohhh…” He let out an involuntary groan. He let himself relax and enjoy it for just a second before realizing who was making him feel so good. Shit, Steve again. His body became rigid.
"Grand Canyon. Not a bad way to spend a birthday. Are you planning on spending your night in Sin City?"
"It's not
Steve didn't move. He waited, staring at the now silent, empty portal, as if the other Tony would walk back through any second. But he didn't. And now that the right Tony was back - well, their conversation had gone about as well as any other they’d had since Steve returned to the states.
"I was
Steve sees Tony for the first time since he found out about the incident.
“Sorry, you’re right, you’re right. Cockblock isn’t ‘PC’. He delayed your romantic conquest, or whatever the kids are saying now. What, are you blind Stark? Let the man work!”
"You did?"
"What?"
"I'm pretty sure I wouldn't fit in there."
"That's right." Natasha, as observant as always, quickly backed up Steve's change of subject without question. "We might not even need construction cranes. Thor could probably just fly any heavy materials over to us."
“Are you okay?” Steve pushed and pulled Tony’s limbs around, patting down every inch of his body, furiously checking for any scratches or loose shrapnel that may have hit him.
“You could never disappoint me.” Tony replied. “Make me blind with rage? Sure. Drive me crazy? You bet. But you would never disappoint me.” Steve hummed, unconvinced.
“...Why?” Tony asked.
"Captain Rogers? Mister Stark has returned for the day and is heading down to his lab." Steve let out a shaky breath. Even after weeks living here, he still wasn't used to Jarvis sometimes.
“Finally!” Sam exclaimed as he too dropped on the couch next to Bucky. “All that moping around from the both of you is done now, I hope?”
Tony turned back and walked through the portal. This universe was just too much for his weak heart to handle.
Steve was giggling to himself at this point, Tony really liked to go on, didn't he? He put his phone up and revved his bike back on.
“I don’t know, but Tony was really wound up tight. I just hope he doesn’t take it the wrong way.” Steve grimaced.
"Got that J? Tell him that Pepper said to go to the SI entrance door if he wants a driver, don't use the taxis." Tony smiled back.
flustered
Of course Tony would make his trip back home as embarrassingly extravagant as possible. Steve was blushing furiously at the half dozen flight attendants assigned to make his trip 'as pleasurable as humanly possible' (their words, not his.) It was ridiculous! He was the only passenger! They kept asking if he would like a cigar, a bottle of cognac, some caviar, a magazine, a facial. Steve was reeling at all the offers, wanting to sit back and relax, but being too polite to ask them to leave him the hell alone. When they finally landed that night, Steve was exhausted from the constant barrage and couldn't wait to get to his room to finally get some rest after this long day. When he walked off the jet stairs, though, a familiar face was waiting for him.
"Lucky kid." Tony commented. Steve looked at him, chest thumping, wondering if he was going to give himself away right now.
"Mmm...yeah, I don't get it. But this turtle is gonna go back into his shell and get some shut eye."
"Please...need you inside me." Steve let out a shaky breath, barely holding himself back from just slamming Tony against the bed and rubbing their bodies together until he felt release. No, he needed to be patient, this is what he'd been waiting for.
“Lab, FRI.”
"Are you sure he's straight?" Rhodey rolled his eyes. "Did he come out and tell you that, or are you just assuming?"
"I'll take the repulsor blast, thanks." Steve joked.
It took just a few seconds longer for Steve's brain to reboot and realize that he was not, in fact, holding his pillow. He was holding Tony. In Tony's bed. Tony was cuddling back. Fuck.
“Of course, sir.”
"Got it....done?" Steve looked down and had a helmet in his hands. It was a simple, but stylish looking motorcycle helmet. All black, except for a small wing on each side, and a mirrored visor in the front. "Is this for me?"
“Ha.” Tony finally put his weapon away, and pulled his helmet back altogether. “He got the math wrong. This isn’t a mirror universe at all. It's no wonder my HUD is offline. You. Don’t move.” Tony pointed at Steve as he started to look around the room again. “What’s the date today, Fri?”
"Hey!" He held up the box for Tony to see. "It's Old Gold! They used to sponsor the Dodgers! Just like Red Barber used to say on the radio after a home run!
"I had work..." Steve didn't even know why he was trying to hide anything from her.
"Y-yeah?" Steve didn't know why this was still so hard.
“So what does all this have to do with him saving sex with you?” Pepper's voice interrupted his thoughts.
Tony was already getting addicted to seeing that smile as much as possible.
" The formal word tasted like dirt in his mouth, too honorable a title for such a man. "I don't normally make it a habit to wear my uniform outside of battle." He glared at everyone present. "It's despicable the way you all speak about the owner of this company."
When Tony was good and ready, Steve got on his knees, lining himself up. He saw Tony bite his lips nervously, staring down at Steve’s huge cock. Steve leaned forward, and gave him a peck on the lips.
"Uh..." Steve didn't want to correct him, because doing so would be admitting that he knew exactly who called this in. Natasha would be the death of him. "Maybe they have us confused with someone else. This seems...romantic."
"You sure do travel a lot." Steve said, and Tony just lifted one shoulder, biting into a sweet ball of fried dough. "Thank you, but I'm not sure I'd make very good use of them. I can make a few things, but I'm not a home chef or anything."
that was B.S!"
"It's for you, our world traveler!" Clint came up and plucked the presents from his hands, placing them on the gift table. "You're not supposed to bring presents to your own 'Welcome Home' party you know."
"I'm sorry to wake you. It's just that your checkout was at 11 and it's almost noon now, so the front desk wanted me to come check on you."
"You have a visitor, boss." She replied casually. "You might want to answer." Tony rolled his eyes. Great. Now
“Good. Guess I’m back in the right universe then.” They stood, watching each other for a second before it became unbearably uncomfortable. Tony coughed and walked over to the control panel. “Anyways, I’m here and I’m alive, you can go back to bed now, grandpa.” he waved Steve off as he began to unpack his things. Steve couldn’t move, his heart felt like it was stuck in his stomach, and so he quietly watched how Tony worked on the screens in front of him, manipulating the numbers and gauges effortlessly. The same screens the other Tony had just touched, only seconds ago. “FRIDAY, run another simulation on Mirror Alpha. This time, account for any changes in atomic structure after 1974. The divergence must be due to the discovery of the weak nuclear force. I don’t know why it would change anything but-”
"Yes! Bathroom!" and Clint was gone in a flash.
keep them. And
Now....now it was like they could never see eye to eye. He wouldn’t be surprised if he walked back through the portal and found a fuming Captain waiting to tear him a new one for some reason or another. It was no use dwelling on the past.
"You know, if you want me to back off..."
"I mean, I have enough money. It would only be a few million-"
"Oh! Let's go back to that Cuban place! I could go for some more dancing!" Tony gleefully suggested.
“Yeah, it’s his nickname for me.” Steve continued. “He’s so kind and thoughtful. He’s charming and loves me unconditionally. I couldn’t imagine my life without him.”
"No." Steve practically growled. He couldn't control his hands, one groping Tony's soft, round bottom, the other clutching his waist, pulling him impossibly closer.
He was also trying to make it easier on Other-Tony by keeping the suit on. It would take hours to depolarize the tower if he were to spread his atoms all over the place. But well, he already knew it would be a bitch to do the same once he got home, seeing how he’d sent over an unaware Tony Stark into his own universe. So he supposed he’d just have to tell Jarvis to let Other-Tony know he needed to depolarize the observation deck if he didn’t want to blow his cover. He flipped up his faceplate, ready to come up with some excuse for whatever the other man needed, when Steve kissed him.
"I'm sure you're exaggerating." Rhodey tried to settle his fears. "He hugged you. If he was put off by a kiss, he would've pulled away, or pushed you off. Did he do that? Explain exactly how it happened, it was probably a misunderstanding."
"Heh. Well." Tony muttered as his eyes went wide and the tips of his ears got a little pink as he stared at Steve laughing. Steve pulled himself together, and smiled, encouraging Tony to go on. "So...well what do you know so far?"
"You're so infuriating." Tony growled between tender bites and kisses. "Down the hall. Last door on the right." He ordered, and Steve diligently carried them right over, anticipation bubbling in his stomach as he felt Tony's hands fumbling with his shirt buttons.
He listened; A few teenage boys talked about driving out to the city to see a movie tonight. Parents telling their toddler that they would order a slice of Sunshine lemon pie if he ate just one more bite of carrots. An elderly couple video chatting with their daughter. It all seemed so normal, and after Steve finished his meal and paid, he sat a few minutes at his booth just breathing. In and out.
"What??" Tony jerked up and put his phone down, closing out Jarvis' dictation. "No!" He whined, "He's just new! You know that. What if
“Is...is that okay? We don’t have to. I just thought-”
“Same date.” Tony mumbled as he finally found what he was apparently looking for - a compass. He shook it a few times and seemed unconvinced, going to the window to look out at the morning sun, then turned around and started looking through Steve’s things again. He found Steve’s phone in his drawer and turned it on, starting to flip through his apps.
"Oh. Good." Steve pocketed his wallet and phone, trying to recover from all this tension. "Come to the cafe with me? I want some breakfast before heading out."
"I wasn't much better." Tony opened the car door for them and they got in. "So, that means you need to give me a good ol' Captain America knock-out next time I act like everyone else is beneath me."
"As platonic friends do."
"We've done crazier things."
" He exclaimed in triumph. "Come on then, dance partner. Let's go find the others, this crowd is a nightmare."
Well, maybe if he threw a bunch of upgrades at him, he’d be more receptive to Tony’s…antics. Maybe this Tony was faring better than him, for all he knew.
mirrored universe. Everything from the big bang until now should be exactly the same as the dimension
"You're being dramatic. He probably didn't even notice."
"Yeah." Tony started fiddling with the hem of his own shirt. "I mean. After some reflection, I think Romanoff had some good fashion sense after all. If anyone can pull it off, it's you."
He had an idea. Something had been bugging him since their last sting operation. He wondered if Steve was always as stiff as everyone made him out to be. They'd only danced half a song before SHIELD had barged in but...Tony hadn't been able to get it off his mind. Even through the haze of a high stakes mission, he remembered the way Steve led, how easily they swayed together in time to the music, even with Tony shaking like a nervous rattlesnake. He wanted to give it another go.
"Yes. How did you-" Steve was shaken. How could he know all that? Steve remembered it all like it was yesterday. Thanks to his eidetic memory, but also because it was one of the best nights of his life, sharing all those things with Tony. From then on, the observatory roof became
"That's right." Steve decided to try to put Tony's worries to rest, as unfounded as they were. "I know how to dodge reporters, Tony. And handsy fans as well."
"Oh, Tony you've already done so much for me, you shouldn't have gone to the trouble-"
“No! I mean-”
"He sure is." Natasha crossed her arms and leaned onto the counter, feigning sleepiness. "Stark, would you be a pal and grab my Black tea from the pantry? Since you're so
Steve shook his head, trying to bring himself out of this funk. After hours of walking, the day just seemed to go on too long, so he decided to walk back to his bike, and find a nearby town to stay at, somewhere he could maybe have dinner surrounded by other people, even if they were strangers.
Thankfully, only Sam and Bucky were aware of the situation, and they were kind enough to keep it to themselves. It’s not like it was out of character for Tony to disappear for days at a time, so no one else really questioned his absence all that much. But when Natasha knocked on his front door with a new fitted suit that Sunday morning, Steve was terrified that news would spread soon enough.
guy.” He cheerfully confirmed.
"God, I could watch you like this all day, seeing you lose control of yourself." Tony said in a deep, comforting voice as he let his slick fingers trace around Steve's warm opening, letting him adjust to the sensations near his virgin hole as he peppered tiny kisses under his ear. Steve knew he must look so obscene, so vulgar right now, spreading his legs for his lover, probably squirming under his touch, but he didn't care. He wanted Tony all around him, inside him, could lose his mind at the very thought of it.
"Oh, hey Bruce. Good morning." Steve was a little disappointed that he wouldn't get alone time with Tony this morning, but he knew Tony wasn't a morning person, and he certainly wouldn't take that out on friendly Bruce. "Sure, I'm making some pancakes today. Could you maybe clean up the berries for me if you don't mind?"
"You wouldn't mind learning to cook with me?"
"Ahem." Steve coughed, getting Tony's attention before he got lost in his thoughts again. "So you'll let me try to reason with them?"
His phone buzzed.
“Oh.”
“Can you believe they’re not together? It’s horrible!” Tony rubbed his beard, exaggerating a thinking pose. “But I hope they figure it out soon. You think we made things worse?”
, as he peed just a few yards away from a still sleepy Tony washing his face in the sink.
Not me crying because it's almost over?? 😭
“Nothing.” Tony took out a notebook - any of his tablets, and even his phone would be more than useless here - and began taking notes from the blueprints scattered on the floor. They seemed to be some kind of solar sail for long-distance space travel. He couldn’t imagine why the Other-Stark would need this, but who knows what kind of contracts he might have taken on in another life. He took notes on a couple more blueprints he found around the lab: A size-altering gauntlet, maybe for the Hulk? If the Hulk was still around in this dimension. Some kind of ray - he could tell from the specs that it was meant to slow matter down to near-zero movement. He didn’t know what good that would do, but he took the notes anyways. And upgrades - so, so many upgrades to Captain America’s shield, his uniform, his weapons, everything.
"I'll bet." She remarked, and he snorted and turned back around. Thankfully, she didn't press any further, letting the boys finish making breakfast as she made herself comfortable at the bar.
"He knows how to use his phone, Tony. Calm down." Natasha -what a relief - was finally stepping in. "He's been practicing GPS with Jarvis, and besides, he's a big boy  - in case you haven't noticed." She winked at Tony, who flinched at that, "And I know you've noticed."
“What’s going on? You look out of it.” Sam asked, concerned.
"I'll miss you too."
were throwing a party for him! Because they'd missed him! "Thank you all so much. I missed you all." He beamed as everyone came up to greet him with hugs and cheer and laughter. Apparently Bruce got the memo about Steve's newfound love of Indian food, and had prepared a spread big enough to feed an army - which was, surprisingly, enough for Steve and Thor's appetites. As they ate, everyone asked Steve all about his adventures. Thor was excited to hear about his days through New Mexico, exclaiming that he would like to take Jane Foster back someday. Clint teased and pondered how many 'little Captains' would spring up in 9 months, Steve just rolled his eyes at him. Natasha filled him in on all the SHIELD gossip he'd missed.
“Uh...you’re still in your PJ’s?” It was Sam. Oh right, he was supposed to meet Sam and Bucky for their run and breakfast today.
"Nu-uh" Tony pushed the box and Steve's hands into his chest. "No take backs. C'mon, open it!"
Steve looked up and they locked eyes. He didn't move from his spot on the couch, while everyone else got up, getting ready to head out.
Steve thought back, a week seemed like the blink of an eye now. After the battle, while they were eating shawarma, silently watching the shop owners casually sweep up broken glass, Steve had felt utterly hopeless. He thought, at the time, that it would take months, if not years to put Manhattan back together again. But helping the cleaning crews these past few days opened his eyes to just how much had changed in a good way.
The game ended with the Dodgers winning by one point. Steve hoped it was a good omen.
"Yeah, I don't think I've ever had Cuban food before. These banana things are so good." Steve took a big chunk of plantain and smothered it in sauce.
"You...you ever wanted one?"
So Tony fought. burdened with the knowledge that he and Steve would need to work together to keep their world safe - he fought to bring them back together, no matter how much it hurt. But
The force of the machine was suddenly dispersed, and shards of metal were knocked loose, swinging wildly as the velocity of the particles around the failed portal struggled to slow from light speed. Steve grabbed Tony and threw them both to the ground, right as a steel beam shot over their heads, crashing into a junk pile behind them. Steve covered Tony with his body, shielding him from the debris of the explosion, and after a few more tense seconds, the horrible scraping of metal against metal stopped, and the glowing hot pile of what was once Tony's machine began to cool down.
"Surprise!!" He looked around, the whole team was in the doorway, behind them were presents, balloons, streamers and a variety of cakes and food.
He groaned.
"Hee." Tony smiled, his laugh lines only making his eyes even more adorable. "Then you're a Winghead. 'Cuz you have wings on all your helmets, so you think you can fly too. Dummy." He squinted at Steve. "'Tasha told me how you jumped out of that plane after me, didn't know you were so obsessed with me. You could've just asked for a lift, you know."
"Ah! Mister Rogers, I received the call from your secretary. We've been able to make accommodations for you two per her instructions. Please, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Stark, right this way." The host ushered them through the building, all the way to the back, where they had a small booth to themselves facing the rest of the room. The room was dark, only small lights from each table illuminating the area. It was snug, the seat against the wall, just big enough to fit the two of them. Red rose petals were vibrant against the white tablecloth.
"Very good." Pepper calmly clasped her hands in front of her. "I believe I have the last item then. Let's go over security protocol and the tax implications associated with this project."
“Still a few more minutes to go.” He explained. “Since there’s no dimensional travel machine here, I’ll have to wait for the one in my lab to time out and open the portal back up right here.” He pointed at an empty space next to him.
"I'm getting you started." Steve settled in, knowing it would be a long night, but completely worth it.
"Yes." Was all he could manage. Tony pulled back and noticed Steve holding his still hard, red cock. "Honey, but didn't you...?" Tony turned to look at the obvious dripping mess behind them. "Wow. You can go again?" He turned once more to look at Steve, knees spread apart, mouth open and still panting.
Or...wait. There actually
"Sorry." Tony pulled back and shoved something big into Steve's extended hands. "I guess I nodded off there at the end, Jarvis was finally able to wake me up but I got it done this morning."
"Mmm. Yeah, that's good." Well, if he was going to crash and burn, he might as well enjoy it while it lasted. Steve abandoned his inhibitions and took a piece of fried yucca, feeding it to a cheerful Tony.
“Why? You don’t even know me.”
“YES!” Tony wailed, and that pulled Steve back in right away. He slapped Tony again, and got another happy scream. Wow. Tony really liked this. He switched it up, giving Tony a good hard smack on his other cheek too, and that must’ve been what did it, because Tony was spilling all over the bed in the next second. Steve could feel his tight entrance fluttering around him.
“Come on, then.” Tony stood up. “Since you
I can guilt trip anybody into doing anything."
"Oh no!" Tony's eyes went wide with interest, just how Steve hoped they would. He enjoyed making Tony go on one of his rants, especially if it would help lift his spirits. "What did I tell you about listening to strangers, Steve?! They were obviously messing with you. You need to send me that list so I can curate it. I'm not letting you waste your time on, say, Star Trek Enterprise, when you should just be watching the originals."
Sitting on a bench overlooking the sea, he took out his notebook and flipped to a blank page, starting a list.
Right outside Dallas, but exhausted from his long drive today, Steve decided it was time to pack it in for the night. He pulled off into a small inn that thankfully had no wait. With eyes half lidded, he opened the door to his room and all but collapsed face-first into the bed. Right before floating away in slumber, he heard his phone go off.
"No. I think...I didn't make it clear enough. I don't think he knows I asked him on a date. I'm pretty sure he thinks it's just dinner, he was really nonchalant about it."
He stopped by a small grocery store, thankful that he had some cash on him so he didn’t need to remove his Ironman suit to pay, and picked up a pint of vanilla ice cream for himself too. He arrived at Pepper’s just moments later. She was waiting in her pajamas outside. He handed over the bag with her ice cream.
“Stop, honey. You’re making me blush!” A shy smile graced his face, the corners of his eyes crinkling with amusement at Steve's shock.
“But...it checks out?” Steve tried to ease the tension.
"Yeah." Tony sighed. "If they don't vote in favor of this...I don't know. I'll just have to find some other way. Pep and I worked too hard on this to just watch it fail."
Steve opened his eyes again. Wasn't sure exactly why he kept closing them shut. His jaw felt sore, and he realized his whole body had gone tense. He consciously relaxed his jaw, then his eyes, his shoulders, and hands.
"If little old me will do, then fine." Tony sat at the kitchen bar and started to unpack their dinner, Steve sitting down next to him. Tony got him to try at least a small bite of everything, offering sushi to Steve's lips with his own chopsticks, and seafood had never been so delicious, even if it was out of styrofoam containers. Afterwards, they retired to the living room to watch some TV. Neither of them acknowledged the hot tub on the way there, though unbeknownst to the other, they both really wanted to. Though the living room had several large chairs and recliners, they both gravitated towards the couch right across from the TV. Steve sat first, and Tony stretched out on the other side, placing his feet in Steve's lap. Steve cherished the comfort, though he didn't quite know what to do with his hands, so he opted to just drape them over the back of the couch. If he left them too close, he might end up massaging those cute feet right through the socks, he could tickle the smaller man's toes, maybe caress his calves just a little..
It's so bittersweet to be finishing this up. I'll definitely be writing a new fic soon. If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!
"But his had
weigh about a hundred pounds. “I’ve got it. Let’s go.” He smiled at him. The gorgeous Steve-Rogers smile that was usually only reserved for nice people who deserved it. Maybe this universe was one where Tony won the good-luck lotto.
Tony looked down, and put his hands in his pockets. Steve knew Tony didn't like praise, and for a touchy-feely guy, he really didn't like talking about feelings when it came to his own relationships. He hoped he'd be able to break down that wall someday. Steve looked up and saw a large picture of a black man holding a baseball bat labeled "1947".
"Good. Great. I mean, I'm so glad. You mean so much to me. I don't know where I'd be without you, seriously." He rubbed the back of Tony's hands with his thumbs. "I promise I'll always be good to you. You deserve that, you deserve the whole world. I want you to be able to rely on me, to trust in me completely, sweetheart, and I know that will take some time-"
"Shit Steve it's already 10! Why did you let me fall asleep? I knew this was a bad idea, let's just call the whole thing off-" Tony burst through Steve's apartment door, and was rendered speechless at finding the supersoldier sitting at his dining room table in a full suit, next to Pepper Potts of all people. "Uh..."
"Hm. Have you talked to-" Tony furrowed his brows and looked around, obviously not satisfied with their location. "Wait. I'll text you." He whispered before twisting again, this time leaning his head against Steve's arm and throwing his legs over the other couch arm, essentially using Steve as a pillow. Steve almost missed his phone buzzing in his pocket over the blood rushing in his ears.
"Traitor." Tony called out. Jarvis remained silent.
“What? What time is it?”
When he got to the communal area, though, he was bombarded by all the Avengers at once.
"That wasn't so bad, right?" She smiled.
“Couldn’t hurt to try.” Steve gently prodded. “These stones could give you the juice you need. You trust yourself, don’t you?” He wrapped his arms around Tony from behind, and the tired genius couldn’t help a giggle that slipped out when Steve started to pepper him with kisses.
But he would be lying to himself if he didn't admit that the one touch he needed was Tony's. He could have everyone on Earth's hands on him, but if it wasn't Tony, it would never be enough. When Tony was in a room, NOT touching him, it's like every nerve ending in his body was on fire, desperate to reach out to him. He would be hyper aware of the man's every move, savoring every small gift of a hand on his shoulder, or an accidental bump when walking by.
"Be right there, baby." Steve beamed as he took some bleach out of the cabinet, so thrilled to be able to call Tony that now. Maybe they hadn't really talked things through yet, but the way Tony looked at him, called him sweet names, the way he felt against his body, he knew in his heart how the other felt too, and it was enough for now. After cleaning, he made his way back to the couch and found Tony fast asleep. Well, he was pretty tired too, not having gotten much rest last night, so he laid down next to him and cuddled up, pulling the smaller man against him. He gripped Tony close, as close as he could, and fell asleep to the soft sounds of his quiet snoring.
"Smooth." Natasha innocently commented.
“I’m fine.” Tony said, sniffling away his forgotten tears. Steve visibly relaxed, his eyes meeting Tony’s again. Tony saw Steve quickly lick his lips- probably a reflex - but it suddenly brought him back to what they had just almost done. “Uh...” He brilliantly muttered, his gaze flicking back up to Steve's, where he saw a glimmer of something. Something not quite yet spoken between them. Before he could get another word out, a roaring whoosh cut him off, a cold, white spray engulfing the both of them.
