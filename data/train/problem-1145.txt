“Well, I don’t know!” the brunette suddenly bleated, head rattling in frustration as his eyes flared. “Some film and television depictions suggest it’s appropriate to ask first! I
John’s mouth flapped soundlessly, opening and closing as he struggled to string a sentence together in his mind. “I- That- That was amazing,” he breathed, and Sherlock, so smug but a moment ago, startled, years falling off his face as it was overcome with naked shock.
“If you insist,” John said, the grin evident in his voice, and Sherlock hoped it wasn’t due to the blush he could feel creeping up his neck. “Give me another I-spy.”
Molly slammed a hand to her mouth to avoid spewing soda all over the table, Irene nearly knocked her chair to the ground as she flung backwards in laughter, but Sherlock remained entirely calm, smirking blithely back at what John was sure was an expression of both outrage and disbelief.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock muttered, face wrinkling across the table in disgust as John approached. “He’s not a
John was back in a moment, sitting on the edge of the bed beside Sherlock. He took the ice again, wrapping it quickly in a towel before gently pressing the bundle to the back of Sherlock’s head. “Hold it there for a while, yeah?” he advised, the ice clicking together as it shifted against Sherlock’s skull beneath his fingers.
“How do you know?” Sherlock muttered, watching as John placed the girl’s drink on the ledge, taking care to ensure he retracted his hand before her fingers could brush against it. “You’ve known him three days.”
People were milling around –mostly leaving, as classes started at 9—and John scanned through the crowd for a familiar face. Mike was nowhere to be seen, but a familiar head of dark curls stuck out at a table in the corner. His fingers tightened on the edges of his tray, his eyes narrowing as he stomped toward it.
The blond looked at him curiously, scanning over his face in that eerily perceptive way he sometimes had, eyes narrowing in suspicion. After a moment though, he sighed, shrugging in resignation. “Okay,” he murmured, nodding. “Okay.”
Sherlock chuckled, shifting in his seat, adjusting his long blue scarf as it got caught under his thigh. “We haven’t failed yet. Though, we do normally have more time,” he admitted, shrugging a shoulder.
Sherlock watched out of the corner of his eye as John blinked again and again, his eyes searching the faces of his teammates for the confirmation he could not read the signs of.
“I- Well, it’s kind of silly,” he muttered with a self-conscious grimace, but the man waved a hand, dismissing the anxiety. “It’s just- Well, she arrived before he did,” he began, nodding his head back at the table, “and, when he got there…he didn’t touch her.” He shrugged, rubbing a hand up the back of his neck, realizing how absurd it was now that he was saying it aloud. “Like, you know, when he walked by her to his chair. He didn’t…touch her shoulder, or-or kiss her cheek or anything.” He looked down at his black shoes, tipping his head as he lightly scuffed his heel into the carpet. “It’s just a pattern I’ve noticed, I guess. We get a lot of proposals in here,” he chuckled, trying to break the tension, but perhaps the situation was only awkward to him, the man doing nothing but blinking up at him, searching between his eyes with something like awe.
John softly closed the door behind him, looking somewhere aside toward the floor. “Mary kissed me,” he said, unplanned, and then snapped his head up at a strangled choke of breath.
A swallow bobbed down her throat as she lifted her chin, clearing her throat before rising to her feet and searching out over the classroom. “Alright, everyone!” she called to order, and the din quickly faded. “Time to pack up! And don’t forget to take your envelopes, or I’ll eat all your sweets!” she teased, and there was a ripple of giggling around the room. “I have bags up here if any of you need them,” she added, waving a hand down at a large tote full of Tesco bags, and it was something like mayhem after that, everyone rushing and fumbling around one another as they gathered their things, eager to get home and dig into their haul.
John inhaled, as if to speak, and then his mouth closed again as he swallowed. “Well, with you spending more time with the team…and now, with the away game and everything…and staying overnight…” He sucked in a breath, releasing it in a quick huff before sitting up straighter and meeting Sherlock’s slivered eyes. “See, everyone will be wearing their regular clothes on the coach, and at the hotel, and the next day too, and…well…”
Sherlock lowered his laden spoon from his mouth, slowly replacing it into the bowl as he blinked across at her. “Are you saying that you-”
“Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson fussed, frowning as she looked over at the glowing 9:47 on the clock in the range, “it’s getting late. Are you sure Sergeant Lestrade-”
“No?” He tilted his head, looking side to side, and caught Sherlock’s eyes again, wide and grey and transfixed. “Well then, I think we’re done here! I trust you remember the way out? You can forget the way in; you won’t need it again.”
Sherlock frowned, reaching out to place his coffee on the table before peering over the arm of his chair. “What do you mean, ‘my stuff’?” he asked, tugging at the top of the cardboard box, and the flaps came loose, revealing his scarf haphazardly spread atop a stack of familiar books. He blinked, making to slide the scarf aside, but something firm met his touch, and he swatted the folds of fabric away to find his skull wrapped tightly within. “This-” he stammered, eyes darting between John and his possessions, “This was at Victor’s.”
“They’re not gonna go flat and boot my off-brand ass out?” he muttered, waving a gesture back toward the door.
“Sorry,” the voice said again, and Sherlock slowly turned, lifting his chin to follow the sound, “didn’t mean to ruin the moment. It’s just, with the bruising pattern on the neck and the traces of petechial hemorrhaging-”
Irene grinned. “Why, thank you, gentlemen! Just up here, right?” She pointed back toward the stairs, and then immediately began ascending them, not even looking back at them for confirmation.
“Is that the story?” John asked, keeping his voice carefully level and bereft of anything but curiosity, because Irene was good, but she was no Sherlock, and John had an idea of where this was going.
John groaned, and the man laughed, turning around to lean the small of his back against the table’s edge. “Exhausting,” John replied, shaking his head down at the thirteenth bag he was opening. “I’ll fall asleep tonight and wake up on Monday,” he added, smiling as Sherlock chuckled. “What about you?” he asked, and Sherlock frowned, tilting his head. “You said you had to get up early for something too.”
John was bisexual, that much Sherlock had picked up on between the flirting and several irate phone calls and visits from the brunette hurricane known as Irene Adler, but Sherlock’s personal leanings had never come up. How he was supposed to slip that into conversation, however, he didn’t know, a simple ‘By the way, I’m gay, in case it matters’ not quite seeming appropriate, and, besides, that would require he be able to talk to John without stammering. Which he couldn’t.
cases we have right over there.” He waved a hand to the piles arranged in front of the bookshelves—one for solved, one for to-be-solved, and one for solved-but-so-obvious-that-Sherlock-had-to-remember-to-point-out-the-imcompetence. It wouldn’t have taken Sherlock Holmes to figure out which pile was the largest.
Sherlock blinked, lips parting, his eyes glued to the loathsome face. “Gimme,” he muttered, darting an arm out toward the bat, and John laughed.
Clara peered over Harry’s shoulder as they scanned the menu, Harry tipping it slightly toward John with an inquiring brow.
Sherlock hummed, shaking his head. He seemed to be waiting for John to say something, but John was still rattled from the butchering of his childhood—would Batman’s mask work? It was bigger, after all—so he cleared his throat and spoke. “Well, I suppose I can’t wear
“Did you-” John started, and then trailed away, but Sherlock shook his head, understanding the silence. John hesitated a moment longer, and then left, Sherlock continuing to stare at the floor as he heard him cross the corridor, the sounds of breaking glass and running water returning to him from the bathroom.
“Please Molly, I find that I actually do need to say something.” He surprised himself by taking both her upheld hands and clasping them both between his own.
“I know you’re going to apologize for hurting me. For breaking my heart. For having to say you…” she swallowed her words and had to clear her throat quickly before continuing.
John was so relieved that Molly and Sherlock had repaired and strengthened what was between them. Molly confided in John as they shared a cup of tea between the time she had been set to look after Rosie and he had returned from work, that she felt like she was past the hold that Sherlock had on her. She still loved him of course and always would but she felt freed from the way in which it consumed her and ruined her other relationships. She had even asked out the cute guy that worked her corner shop and assured John that he looked nothing at all like Sherlock. Molly said that she now knew definitively that there was no world in which Sherlock would ever be hers.
Sherlock stretched up his arms yawning as well. This move caused John, who’d been leaning on Sherlock, to thud slightly into his chest but made no move to adjust himself.
John hissed and gestured for the bottle. “You’re not tracking our ideal consumption amount again, are you?” Sherlock shook his head and handed the bottle off “No, I know how much we’ve had though if you’d like me to…” John held a finger up to Sherlocks lips, cutting him off.
Rosie was getting so big and he wished dearly that Mary could see it. He and Rosie were surrounded by love and support most days though and it made everything bearable, and often even okay. As the days and weeks and months wore on, things even started to be good.
Mary’s note to John and Sherlock stunned both of them in different ways. John was constantly impressed with how often that woman surprised him, even in death. She was no longer here with him, in his mind, but he still thought of her every day. A mixture of regret, guilt, loneliness, and grief swirled through him every time his mind touched on her. When he was with Rosie he thought of her often, which meant there was pride and love as well.
He glanced over and John and Lestrade who were both chatting amiably about some inane thing but who were also giving him pointed looks with their eyes and tilting their heads towards the kitchen.
From behind Sherlock he heard Molly head towards the kitchen, the rustling of bags of take out, and the unmistakable smell of curry wafting his way. “I’ve brought lunch! I’ll just put it in here, shall I?”
Mary had left John with Rosie and Sherlock, and Mary had left Sherlock with John and the task to look after him.
Realizing the flat was now empty John closed the door at the top of the landing and wandered into the kitchen after some more cake.
Sherlock could tell that she had been glancing his way but as soon as he knew her back was turned he gave a look over his shoulder. She was opening one of the bags and pulling out variously sized cardboard containers to place on the kitchen counters. She looked exactly the same and Sherlock wondered for a moment why he thought she might not.
After John had bullied Sherlock into texting The Woman back, they would sometimes have a covert visitor - arriving in one disguise, leaving in another. Irene would show up unexpectedly, but never at a bad time, and would talk for hours with Sherlock or with John as well; she would coo over Rosie, and would chat with Mrs. Hudson or any friend who came by.
John’s room gradually turned into Rosie’s and without much discussion John began to share Sherlock’s.
Sherlock had his birthday, which came with a party now that John had told everyone when it was; it was small and comfortable and it had cake,good food, and a few drinks. Rosie was staying at Janine’s that night so that the adults could have an evening off, and she wasn’t particularly feeling like attending Sherlock’s birthday party. The last round of Heads Up had been played an hour ago, and it was just Molly and Mrs. Hudson in 221B along with Sherlock and John. Mrs. Hudson was detailing her days as an exotic dancer with Molly’s rapt attention while Sherlock took turns with John in tossing quarters into a shot glass. They were only a couple of sheets to the wind so there was some mild difficulty with this.
John woke with a start behind him and took half a moment to take in their current situation. Instead of pulling away immediately he asked in a just-awoken husky voice “what time is it?”
John nodded smiling slightly and realizing the affirmation was probably missed in the dark he said “I’m good right here.”
“It’s late. We’ve got cases tomorrow” Sherlock said by way of a goodnight, and left for his bedroom.
“Oh, god no” Sherlock grabbed the half empty bottle of whisky from off the counter and took it with him to the sitting room. “Do you want a topper?” He shook the bottle in John’s direction while dumping quarters out of their shot glasses and set them back on the table.
John agonized internally over the very simple question he finally asked; “would you like me to stay again?”
“How? It was a huge cake!” John poked at the platter splattered with frosting and crumbs in disappointment.
That night John woke again out of his own dreamland hellscape to hear Sherlock yelling as he had the night before. Rosie was still fast asleep so John grabbed her baby monitor and followed Sherlock’s sounds of distress to find him in much the same position as the night before.
They both felt the tension rise at the same time and felt it in each. There was a stiffening of their bodies, a stilling of their hands, a holding of breaths. John felt heat flush his cheeks and something twist in the pit of his stomach. Sherlock’s heart felt like it was thundering in his ears; could John hear it?
Tears welled up in Molly’s eyes as he spoke but Sherlock continued determined to plow through this awkwardness.
Rebuilding 221B had been taking some time as they were in no rush. Sherlock would be gone for days at a time, and John had his daughter and the surgery where he was still trying to maintain his job, so things moved slow at their flat.
Sherlock pursed his lips as the greetings drew closer to the bottom of the stairs and the guest began to ascend them.
Sherlock was confused and he hated feeling confused. Closeness with John made him feel warm and wonderful in a way that nothing else did and for so long he thought that’s just what it felt like to have finally have a real friend. A best friend. As his emotional side had awakened over the last year though he began to see things differently and maybe more clearly.
As if inside John’s head, Sherlock placed and arm on his shoulder and gave it a squeeze. They shared a knowing look before Sherlock said “Chin up! I’m sure we can ask Mrs. Hudson to make us another cake tomorrow.” John broke into a grin. Yes, the cake, that’s what was making him melancholy. “Or we could ask for the recipe, use this kitchen as it was intended.”
“No, I’m fine not knowing”. His finger lingered there longer than necessary as his brain marveled at the softness of Sherlocks lips. John finally caught up with himself though and pulled away to return to pouring for them both. “One more?” he asked.
The silence between his final word and Sherlock’s answer felt like it went on forever for John. He knew what he wanted to hear and what he was also afraid to hear. Where he got the courage to ask, let alone be here at all was beyond him.
John nodded to himself and sighed as he stood up. “Happy Birthday, Sherlock” he said under his breath, and retreated upstairs to his own bed.
Mrs. Hudson became a go-to babysitter when John and Sherlock needed to run off on a case and she was more than pleased to do so. There were other members of their village who could also be called on and they all readily jumped at the chance. Greg would help out now and again, Molly and Janine would both often be by to spend time with their god daughter. Even Anderson was called upon in a pinch to watch her; when they returned his hair was filled with butterfly clips and he’d produced seven drawings with Rosie’s help. Even Mycroft in his concern had insisted on adding security measures and protection to the structure when 221B was being rebuilt. It had come in handy and made the men of Baker Street feel more secure about maintaining residence there. They became a family, John, Sherlock, and Rosie, and the village of people who loved them were more than enough support that all felt well looked after.
“I have plenty of reasons if you’d like me to list them. Heart and liver disease being among the top.”
Fortunately, if any one of their friends had noticed, none said so or made any deal of it; if they had they might have startled the tranquility of John and Sherlock’s newfound existence.
There were parts of John that was relieved that nothing seemed to be advancing there; he was terrified of things changing in a way that would take Sherlock away - and if he and Irene Adler became something real, Sherlock would probably need to leave with her. John and he had a good thing going here and he didn’t want it to change. Not like that.
“It’s not just any other Sunday, it’s the Sunday after my birthday. A significant day. It means I should get to have waffles in the morning.” John felt Sherlock’s hand absentmindedly (or maybe not so absentmindedly since it was Sherlock) reach down and scratch at John’s scalp lightly. It felt good and John tried not to examine too deeply the closeness they were sharing at the moment. They continued chatting about nothing with John leaned (or one might even venture to call it nestled) into Sherlock, and Sherlock drawing little figure eights with one finger in John’s hair.
Sherlock thought of John as a constant in his life. Someone he always expected, and wanted to be around. The thought of having John taken away from him terrified him to his core and the fact that it had nearly happened several times now was heart wrenching. Sherlock could say things like “heart wrenching” now; he understood what that must mean. He was able to recognize what it meant when other people said it. He could relate it to experiences in his past and recognize how he must have felt in those moments.
“You may not love me like that, but you do love me. You love me. You love Mrs. Hudson there. You love Greg… and don’t pretend you don’t know who that is Sherlock Holmes.” Molly chided and Lestrand scratched the side of his nose looking away while Mrs. Hudson grinned over her tray of pots and cups.
Sherlock pulled Molly into him, giving a calculated deep squeeze and released her stopping to give her a light kiss on her forehead.
After Mary, and the non-affair with Eurus, John hadn’t been pursuing much himself romantically. He’d experimented a bit with Tinder but was too nervous to actually meet up with anyone. It didn’t feel right. He’d chat a bit and when they wanted to make a date he’d just stop. And then a few weeks later try again with someone else. Part of the problem would be that they would recognize him and then ask about Sherlock and that would kind of kill the mood. It was either that or he would mention Rosie and they’d disappear themselves.
“You are so full of emotion Sherlock, and full of love - you wouldn’t do what you do if you weren’t.
John started to drift off, still speaking but starting to no longer make much sense as Sherlock’s fingers lulled him.Sherlock himself was speaking more slowly and  his hand in John’s hair stilled as they both began to fade into sleep.
John would press Sherlock as to the status of their relationship and he would just get brushed off. Sherlock would say something about “it’s not like that between us”, but wouldn’t elaborate.
There was no response, just the cries of anguish. John fully entered Sherlock’s cluttered room now and approached the bed saying his name once more without response.
Sherlock gave a sharp bark of laughter at that, dissolving the tension that had been building in the room.
Sherlock woke first as sunlight cracked through his blinds and the sound of bin collectors clattered on the streets below. He felt John’s breath on his neck and the small snores in his ear before he registered the arm slung over his side and the hand he held in his own clasped up against his bare chest. Sherlock could feel the warmth of John’s body curved into his own from behind and tried to weigh this all against his recollection of last night. He had assumed that John coming to him had been the sweet release at the end of his hellish dream, but in this moment Sherlock was most certain he was awake and that John was not a figment of his mind.
He reluctantly released his grip on John’s hand as John pulled away from Sherlock to stand up. “It’s late, that should be Janine and Rosie.”
Sherlock was also stunned by Mary’s ability to constantly surprise him. After he had so greatly misread her before learning of her hidden past, he’d paid extra attention to her habits, tells, and actions. From then on he was able to deduce and predict everything about her, but not that she would speak to them from beyond the grave, twice - or one other thing. Sherlock too was filled with guilt any time he thought of Mary; guilt about how he wasn’t able to predict her saving him, guilt about how she so arduously and with certainty put the weight of value on his life in a way that had never existed, despite the good he put out into the world.
Maybe this was it. Maybe he got to have the romance and marriage once, and now he gets to be a dad. That would be rewarding enough. He had Sherlock. He had his friends. John knew he’d be fine. A small part of him told him that it wasn’t enough though. He tried not to listen to it.
“Do I…know you?” Lestrade squinted his eyes as the man in the cap rushed past him and into the sitting room.
“Is there anything else? You know, you should really look into that Fedorov fellow. Something about him doesn’t sit well with me…” William concluded.
Sherlock grunted an incomprehensible reply as he took his time rising from the sofa before walking over to Gladstone’s food bowl.
John grumbled to himself as he followed but the word “file” suddenly stopped him in his tracks. “File?
Sherlock walked toward the door before turning to face Warden James. “In what type of an emergency?”
Wiggins pouted before slowly crossing his arms with a nod. He knew Sherlock was referring to the police throwing him into an orphan’s home if he was caught making trouble again.
Sherlock squinted his eyes before smiling back. “You seem to be in a good mood, Watson.” He added as he walked ahead of John into the room.
“Yeah, but a lot of it,” John replied, filling his arms with dark roast while Molly began refilling the medium.
“Thanks,” he murmured, and Mycroft bobbed his head in acknowledgement, giving Sherlock a last pointed look before descending from sight.
John almost felt guilty. And then it passed. “AHA!” he bellowed, ripping the brace out from beneath the sofa cushion and rolling onto his back, the blue bundle waving in his hand overhead.
John laughed, sharp and decidedly unamused. “Sherlock, you are the smartest person I have ever known,” he said, shaking his head as he firmly met Sherlock’s eyes, “so don’t try playing dumb with me.”
“He would, you know,” the man said with an audible smile, “but my associate here would take care of you first.”
“Huh,” Sherlock hummed, squinting toward the board. “I would have felt much less ridiculous ordering that.”
!” John contested again, and Sherlock toppled backwards, head collapsing back into the pillow as his sides ached.
“Magic 8 Ball-” John started again, and, though Sherlock rounded on him, mouth opening, it was not his voice that interrupted.
“Oh, you-you’re coming in tomorrow?” John asked, Sherlock nodding in reply, but it was Molly who answered.
“No. It’s…refreshing, I suppose.” He shrugged, not entirely sure what he meant himself, but Greg seemed contented, smiling into the falling silence as they continued their ascent through the trees.
Sherlock shook his head, looking at a button on John’s shirt rather than his face. “No, his last one was this morning, so he took the afternoon train,” he explained, and John smiled, blissfully unaware he had any reason to be concerned.
“He just has to run an analysis and compare it to the database. The Yard has a mass spectrometer, there’s no reason-”
“Remind me never to get on your bad side,” he remarked, smirking when Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Although, I wouldn’t exactly be shocked to find out you were a vampire,” he added with a shrug. “You’re certainly pale enough.”
“Alright,” Lestrade said, casting John a secret smile as he passed, “let’s get you two out of here. No sense losing an entire Saturday night.”
“Sherlock!” he called as he broke out onto the pavement, catching him halfway in a cab. John didn’t have Sherlock’s skills at deductive reasoning, but even he could read the stiffness in Sherlock’s muscles at the shout.
Sherlock nodded, looking down at the blades of grass jutting up between his fingers. “How, um-” he stammered, not quite sure how best to phrase the question, or if he should even be asking at all. “How’s your mum, er…handling it?”
“Do you think they suspect?” Mrs. Hudson asked urgently, her eyes flashing between Sherlock and Mycroft. “I tried not to make too much of a fuss, but my lines just flew
“Interesting,” Coach Powles mused, looking out over the room. “Jordan’s gonna be out for a while,” he said simply, still looking over John’s shoulder. “I’d like you to stay on as hooker, if that’s alright?”
to do anything,” Sherlock whined, stopping just short of stamping his foot to complete the display of petulance. “And it’s
“John,” Sherlock clipped, trying to force years of questions and longing and frustration into the four letters, because this time, this one time, he needed John to communicate in something more tangible than shrugs and muttered jokes. He didn’t want to deduce or presume or suppose, he wanted to
Sherlock’s brow furrowed for a moment more, and then he nodded back, his fingers sliding from John’s shoulders as he retreated back into the shadow of an aisle between the stands.
Sherlock gave him a withering look. “John,” he sighed, frustrated, and John laughed, a little wild with relief.
John blinked, wondering if perhaps he had missed part of the conversation, Sherlock talking to him while he was asleep not exactly an unfamiliar occurrence. “What?” He sat up, leaning against the headboard as he wiped the last of sleep from his eyes. “Sherlock, what are you doing in here?” he asked, their previous interaction coming back the forefront of his mind with a sweep of humiliated nausea, and his fingers tightened into the duvet at his sides.
I don't have the free time I used to, but I am determined and no longer writer's blocked, so trust that I am plugging away and will get you an update as soon as it's up to snuff, but it will definitely be shorter than the last gap! .............too soon??
He growled, a feral, snarling thing that usually only emerged when he hit a wall in a case, and stalled his pacing, bringing his hands up to tangle in the curls at the back of his head. Automatically, he looked over at John, who was still sound asleep, undisturbed by the outburst. He clutched a hand to his chest, inhaling sharply as that warm, almost painfully tight feeling bloomed in his lungs, a sensation he was growing ever-more-accustomed to the more time he spent around John. Last night had been by far the most absurd, and Sherlock cringed at the memory.
“Look, Irene, I don’t know what to tell you; they said they couldn’t get the posters done until Thursday.”
John shrugged, head tipping to the side. “Not really. I mean, holidays and stuff, but mostly I just asked a lot of questions.” He chuckled, and Alice smiled, and Sherlock clenched his fists, reminding himself John didn’t
“Well, I- You-” John stammered, but he was cut off as Sherlock let out a sharp huff of laughter, the sound steadily growing until he was shaking with it, head bowed and fist pressed against his mouth in a vain attempt to stifle the mirth. John narrowed his eyes, crossing his arms stubbornly even as he could feel his face going nuclear. “I don’t see what’s so funny about it,” he snapped, and Sherlock shook his head, lifting a hand to John apologetically.
“John,” he broke in, this time a warning, a hand lifting to his mouth as he tried to hold in a belch that tasted like chips.
“No,” she whispered, a swallow rolling down her throat as she reached her arm across the table, hand gripping gently over Sherlock’s forearm. “Don’t be sorry,” she urged, shaking her head, and Sherlock had to drop his eyes from hers, a knot forming in his throat. “Don’t you ever be sorry,” she added, and then, suddenly, she was beside him, pulling his head against her chest as she wrapped her arms around him, an embrace he awkwardly attempted to return from his seat.
John laughed, shuffling further back on his mattress as he crossed his legs. “Sounds like fun. The movie thing, I mean,” he clarified, and Sherlock hummed noncommittally.
The room fell silent, four sets of wide eyes turning to him as his chest heaved against the pressure of building terror.
“I know,” Sherlock interrupted, and John closed his eyes, sighing at the salvation. “Langley isn’t exactly…well…” He shrugged, and John nodded, the homophobia of the aristocracy not exactly news.
The impact of the late tackle rattled his teeth in his jaw, his skull slamming hard against the dirt, and the clamor of whistles, hisses of secondhand pain, and cries of injustice all blended together in his head, the sounds spinning just as much as the clouds he hazily blinked up at. He didn’t feel the pain until he made to roll onto his side, propping himself up on an elbow, and then winced, clutching at his ribs just as Mike skidded down onto the grass in front of him.
John sighed, the tension in his body relaxing as he burst out the door. He glanced side-to-side as he walked down the pavement, scanning the lawn, but there were no glowingly pale, exposed forearms to be found.
He turned after that, momentarily taken aback by the glowing smile on Mrs. Hudson’s face as he made his way to move around her.
Sherlock laughed, a single, mocking burst, and looked toward the front of the cab as John glared at him.
Mycroft sighed tiredly. “I just wanted to check in on you after what happened at the Yard, that business with that Carlisle fellow. Terrible, just terrible.”
“Good god!” Sally snorted. “And you haven’t demanded to be moved?” She chuckled, but it was devoid of humor; a cold, wicked thing that made John’s muscles twitch.
“And now no longer do.” Sherlock whipped out of his chair in a fluid turn John would have mocked him for rehearsing under different circumstances, but now the air was charged, and Sherlock’s eyes were sparking like lightning about to strike. “I think it’s time you left, Sebastian. And it would be advised for you to not return.”
Lestrade hummed affirmatively. “Up in Clapham. You have time to come in and take a look? It’s officially a serial now, and we’ve got an incident room set up.”
“My parents,” Sherlock replied, voice muffled as the heat of his breath was reflected back by the paper shield.
“Just for the weekend,” John mumbled, shifting the strap of the athletic bag on his shoulder for something to do. “Going to stay at my aunt’s.”
Sherlock tilted his head, looking up toward John’s eyes, though they were far away. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, and John turned down to him, smiling gently.
Wait, was he already planning on this being a regular thing? Did he want that? Those thoughts were pushed back for revisiting later, however, as Sherlock leapt up the few steps in front of a polished, black front door.
“Well, how do you know I won’t do that?” he teased, and Sherlock shot him a withering look. “Alright, I’m coming,” he said, and Sherlock nodded, giving Mycroft a parting glare before disappearing back out the door, but he left it open. John turned, smiling through a long-suffering shrug as he looked back to Mycroft, but something in the man’s gaze made him pause, face falling to curious.
“So,” the younger man began, “he’s coming to the match because he’s friends with Molly’s friend”—John nodded—“but he doesn’t really know you, or know that you and Molly know that he does ballet, or that you’ve been watching him for the past three months?”
“So, whadya wanna do for the next six hours?” John asked, twisting to press his back against the lift wall again.
“Mycroft’s coming back?” John asked, turning the question to Sherlock halfway through. “Already? I thought his exams weren’t until next week.”
“Sally,” Lestrade cautioned, intervening just as the woman was drawing in a breath to reply, and Sherlock turned toward the voice, a smirk landing on the inspector before his gaze dropped to John.
John hesitated, nibbling at the corner of his lip, and then the tension released from his shoulders as he shrugged, nimble fingers latching the watch around his wrist one-handed. “Well, alright,” he murmured, brow furrowing in concentration as he wavered between tightness settings, “but I’m not letting you do anything else. Except your dishes.” He twisted the watch facing forward on his wrist, giving Sherlock a stern look. “I’m not having another explosion in my sink.”
together, there will be a separate, group”—Sherlock made a nauseous sound behind him—“assignment due next term that will help ensure we all have a firm grasp of the material. I will split you into groups”—was Sherlock actually throwing up back there?—“and assign each group a key scene from the play. You will perform your scenes in front of the class”—it was too quiet, Sherlock must have died—“and receive a grade based on my assessment, as well as your group evaluations.”
“‘Fraid you’re out of luck though,” John sighed dramatically. “I’m just one of the forwards tonight. No hooker for me.”
“You’re…gay,” he echoed, testing the words, trying to fit them into the rapidly complicating puzzle of Irene Adler. “But you- You and Sherlock…”
“Proving you wrong,” John replied, Sherlock’s mouth opening to reply just as he freed the contents, a tan hand holding up a large plastic ball. “It’s a Magic 8 Ball,” John explained, shifting the enlarged black billiards ball between his hands. “Mum said it was the last one in stock. Apparently, it can tell the future.”
shot?” she asked, pausing with her fingers over the screen, and Sherlock tilted his head, considering a moment before tossing another 20p at her. Molly laughed, shaking her head as she tapped in the addition. “Honestly, Sherlock, you drink
A loud thump drew his attention to the employees only door behind him, and he rushed forward just in time to get his hands under the toppling side of a box, a small squeak issuing from behind the cardboard.
Harry broke into laughter, but Sherlock only shook his head, smiling out at the street as they neared the bookstore.
John’s eyes widened, a steadying breath trembling out of him as he blinked away, focused decidedly down past Sherlock’s ear. “Sherlock, you- What happened today-”
With a smirk only the creeping dawn light saw, he quietly shifted on the mattress, shuffling closer to Sherlock as he leaned up and over him, dropping his lips to the back of his neck.
John dipped his head, smiling gently. “Just trust me, it is,” he said, and Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him for a moment before relenting.
John laughed brightly. “Well, if you think so, it must be true,” he said, and Sherlock was surprised to find nothing mocking in the bright-blue gaze.
“Do you really think it went well?” he asked, peering up through his lashes, shoulders relaxing when Sherlock nodded.
John’s entire body was numb. Even the thumping of his own heart was somehow dimmed, faint ripples of vibrations running through the heavy extensions of his limbs. “You never…?” he pressed, the hanging sentence bothering him in some faint, niggling way he couldn’t quite get his brain to focus on right now, like the feeling when you know you’ve forgotten something important but can’t for all the world remember what.
John’s eyes snapped up, fixed on the stiff set of the man’s shoulders as he ripped through the files, his face turned into the shadows.
“Oh, of course, dear,” Mrs. Hudson said, patting a hand to John’s arm. “I think there’s a Body Shop down that way,” she added, waving a hand down Regent Street, and both Sherlock and John turned politely to follow the gesture. “They have candles. And there’s a
“So, what’s the case you’re working on?” John asked, following as Sherlock crossed to the dormitory.
It was well into the next morning, closer to dawn than dusk, and they’d forgone the takeaway, the hassle of getting dressed far too much of a burden to bear. Instead, they’d opted for two of the microwaveable meals John had had in his freezer—Sherlock perched on a chair wearing only boxers and a blanket while he watched John waver between pasta with shrimp or chicken—and then eaten in front of the TV, watching some crap reality show about races Sherlock had barely been paying attention to, simply curling up against John’s side and nodding whenever he said something. Of course, John had caught on, culminating in Sherlock agreeing to several things he had no intention of following through on, but the resultant bickering had somehow brought them back to the bedroom, where they’d wriggled under the blankets, arguing in-between languid slides of tongue and teeth.
John could only groan, swatting one hand back toward the man’s legs while the other pulled the duvet completely off the bed to cover his face. “S’ too early,” he whimpered. “Come back later.”
“Yes,” Sherlock murmured, uncomfortable under all that caring. “It’s not as if Mycroft’s going to hang it on the wall.”
“Now why would I wanna do that?” The trainers moved to stand in front of him. “What with my best, campus customer right here and all. How ya been, Sherls?”
“I’ll see ya around,” she said, smiling brightly as John nodded, and then withdrew, stepping back to Clara’s side.
“Why did you lie about this weekend?” he challenged, and Sherlock froze, his eyes blinking once in shock before filling with panic. “I heard you,” he explained, shifting his gaze to the table past Sherlock’s shoulder. “Mrs. Hudson. The spring arts celebration. The Nutcracker,” he spat, and Sherlock winced, his eyes dropping to the ground. “Can’t imagine how you’re gonna squeeze in that chemistry meeting around the ballet, but, hey, if worst comes to worst,“—he smiled, a wry twist of his mouth—“I’m sure you can make
“Great,” she chirped, smiling brightly. “Well…bye, John,” she added, flipping her hand up in a short wave as she took a step inside the classroom.
Sherlock looked between the jacket and John, confused and frustrated. “Why?” he snapped. “The entrance is
The answer took a moment this time, John just beginning to wonder if the man had perhaps fallen asleep when the screen brightened again.
“I said I wanted to crack a man’s skull open,” Sherlock continued flatly, pointing the bat up at the slowly spinning object of his ire. “That’s- That’s latent homicidal tendencies at best.”
“It’s amazing,” John breathed, shaking his head softly, and Sherlock agreed, but not about the robotics. Suddenly, he turned, and Sherlock was caught, blinking dumbly down at John’s warm expression. “Thank you, Sherlock,” he said with a smile that temporarily stalled Sherlock’s reply.
“Peters,” Mycroft interrupted, his tone quiet, but not to be challenged. “We’re fine up here. Go take care of Erickson, will you?”
“Well, this is pointless!” he blustered, flashing a frustrated look back over his shoulder. “You could be talking about anything! Look, there’s a pigeon; is that what’s so- Hey!”
“Yeah, it’ll just be a second,” he assured, dropping his face to finish adorning the beverage, but the girl spoke out yet again.
“En garde,” he said, and they lifted their foils in front of them, John sparing him a curious glance. “Êtes-vous prêts?” Two short nods. “Allez!” He stepped backward over the edge of the mat as the men circled one another, foils aloft and tipped slightly forward, ready to attack or parry.
John shouldn’t have reacted that way. He should be furious by now. He should be sick and tired of Sherlock and his theatrics. He should have been in Mr. Parish’s office
“I just wanted to call about what we were talking about earlier,” he replied, no idea why he was bothering to be cryptic when Sherlock wasn’t even in the room. Although, he wouldn’t put it past him to lurk outside the door.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” Sherlock muttered, looking over John’s face like it was a bomb that might explode.
Sherlock stared at the message, reading it three times, but the words never changed. His mouth hanging open, he blinked his eyes up to John, who, while watching him anxiously, managed a small smile as he met Sherlock’s gaze.
Lestrade’s eyes widened, and he looked back in on the display before twisting back to Sherlock. “Did you-”
“Of course she is,” Sherlock muttered, but it came out fonder than intended, John rocking back on his heels with a smile.
“I don’t mean like that,” Sherlock snapped, but some of the chill was out of it. “It has something to do with your father.”
A minute or so later, he moved to sit on the edge of his bed, hanging his arms limply off his knees as he stared at the floor. Another couple minutes of deep breathing and, counterintuitively, growing nausea, and he was up, crossing the corridor to hover uncertainly outside the laboratory door. He raised and dropped his hand a few times before making contact, a tentative knock on the wood.
“I-” he stammered, and then his face furrowed once more with thought. “Is that why everyone’s such a soppy mess?”
The waiter appeared with the food shortly thereafter, giving them a parting wink that made Sherlock exceptionally uncomfortable, but he did
John blinked up at him, mouth still agape, and then began tentatively approaching the glass case before something else caught his eye, and he froze, eyes springing wide. “Is that a Darth Vader!?” he blurted, looking over into the corner where a life-size sculpture of a black figure Sherlock didn’t recognize had been assembled.
It had been barely two days since he had seen John, Friday afternoon leading into Sunday’s waning daylight, but it felt like another lifetime entirely, shut away as he was in the isolated manor, so dark and dull compared to the dorms at Langley. Although whether that had more to do with the buildings or the company would require further study.
“Why did you do it!?” he exploded, spinning on the spot just shy of where the bleachers broke to open sky, and John froze where he stood about a meter away. “Why? Do you and your mates really have
He didn’t fall, miracle of miracles, but he did stagger back rather precariously, the side of his face throbbing as he lifted a hand to it, feeling something slick and warm he knew from experience was blood trickling down from his lip.
“We won,” John said, a touch dismissive, his mission of uncovering Sherlock’s hidden agenda clearly not forgotten. “Mike took a pretty bad hit. I’ve been running back and forth to the ice machine since we got back.”
“You can walk,” his father snapped, and Sherlock instinctively recoiled, his shoulder lifting in a fragile shield.
not wearing one,” Sherlock remarked, flicking a glance up over his book. He looked like he was in a costume already, with his forest green dress shirt tucked into dark grey trousers. He made an extremely convincing ‘smartest man alive playing stupid like a prick’.
“Good evening, everyone!” she announced, the room breaking into applause for some reason, but she raised her hands, smiling in gracious acceptance. “Thank you all so much for coming to our
“Before this devolves into the two of you blowing raspberries at each other,” John interjected, rising from his seat, hands on the table as he leaned into the center of the group, “I think some caffeine is in order. Usuals?”
FINALLY! Here we are! This chapter is just under 25k, can you believe it!? The fic isn't anywhere near over, but this is still a bit of a milestone. This chapter is the one that started it all! There is a scene in here that was the first thing that popped into my head, the reason I not only started this fic, but got into Teenlock in the first place (I'll tell you what it is at the bottom to avoid spoilers).
Sherlock frowned at the side of his face, but there was nothing for it now, the students far too loud and demanding all of their attention, so Sherlock merely shuffled as close to the wall as he could get.
“John?” she breathed, looking over the young boy’s frame. “John Watson, is that really you? You were barely up to my knees last I saw you!”
He turned it over in his hands, lovingly examining each white sleeve that framed the bright-blue body. Running his fingers over the elasticized cuffs—blue with horizontal, white stripes that matched the collar and hem—his mouth stretched into a dazed smile as his eyes roamed over the back. ‘Watson’ was embroidered in bold, white letters near the top, and a large, white number 2 patch was stuck beneath it, framed in navy to stand out even more against the blue background. John turned the jacket to the front, touching at the shiny, white snaps down the front before he stilled. On the left side, right over where his heart would be, his last name was embroidered again, smaller this time, and there was a large, ‘C’ patch beneath it, the same white and navy as the 2. He ran his fingers over the inner chenille, the fluffy fabric compressing under the pressure, before following the curves of the darker, felt border, his eyes wide with disbelief.
“Your medical vocabulary emerges at the oddest of times,” Sherlock answered, twisting at another dial. “How else was I supposed to measure the levels of toxins retained in fingernails after death?”
Sherlock glanced over out of the corner of his eyes, unable to entirely keep himself from smiling as John smirked up at him.
Sherlock smiled, though unsure he could see it, so he added a nod before replying. “Goodnight, Your Highness,” he murmured, passing through the door and pulling his mobile out again to guide him back to his room.
Thursday had only been survived through this technique, John carrying the heavy, leather book with him in his bag the entire day. When Sherlock had grown worryingly irritated by a squirrel sitting in the tree above them, John had pulled it out, picking up with Elizabeth reading Mr. Darcy’s letter. Gradually, the squirrel was forgotten, and Sherlock spread out over the grass on his back, his body speckled in the wavering light of the sun filtering through the branches above as he absentmindedly plucked green blades and tossed them into the breeze.
Sherlock tilted his head at him, frowning, and John sighed, frustrated at the failure of that damned deductive reasoning
“Really?” John said, keeping his tone even, but he pushed up against the sole of Sherlock’s shoe pointedly. “Did he not have one last year?”
“Huh,” John huffed, but it sounded slightly strangled, his throat tightening with the rising tension in the room. “I would’ve thought it’d be Thai Sweet Chilli.”
Mycroft held the blue brace out in front of him, eyeing it distastefully as he turned it side-to-side by his fingertips. “Am I
“He lied to me,” was all Sherlock said, however, and Mycroft sighed, stepping forward to overlap his body with Sherlock’s, giving him little choice but to meet his brother’s eyes.
?!” John exclaimed, pointing at an image on the opposite edge of the semi-circle, which showed a man who looked very much not-alive propped up against what appeared to be a brick, alley wall.
“Yes, it is,” John interjected, attempting to swat Sherlock aside, but he only moved closer, overlapping the door handle with his hip.
The man gave him a quick glance before turning back to the table behind him, plucking a small, white envelope off the blue tablecloth. “Room…117,” he said, his eyes widening slightly as he looked down at his clipboard. He looked back up at John, shock written all over his face for a moment before he collected himself, clearing his throat loudly. “Right. Here’s your key and your orientation forms,” he continued, handing John the folder hesitantly, his eyes flicking between the paper and John with trepidation.
“Right,” he croaked, and then cleared his throat, but the small creak in his voice was enough to keep John smiling like a crazy person all through his errand.
“Mrs. Hudson?” Sherlock echoed, bracing himself against the tree as he stood, the blond boy rising silently at his side. “What happened to dad?”
“What?” Sherlock whispered, a wary ridge beginning to form between his brows, and John quickly shook his head to assuage his fears.
“Alright, alright,” Sherlock muttered, rising to his feet, John hesitating a moment before quickly following. “Don’t go getting all polite. I’ll need to have you evaluated for some late-onset mental condition.”
“Do you know what a phoenix is, Seb?” Jim interjected, and Moran blinked, watching the immobile sliver of the man’s sharp face.
John’s eyes flew open, awakened by something that had since stopped, the spike of adrenaline leaving him woozy, and it was several seconds before the dark mass in front of him formed a decipherable shape.
“John,” Sherlock spluttered, shaking his head down at him as he laughed, “isn’t it obvious? You got in!”
The stretch between half-term and Christmas was always the worst as far as John was concerned. No one, not even the professors, felt like doing much of anything after coming back from break, and it didn’t help that Christmas started, as always, the day after Halloween. Or, rather, the day after Guy Fawke’s Day, which happened to fall on a Tuesday this year, something everyone was unreasonably upset about.
“You don’t remember?” Sherlock asked, casually enough, but his hands stopped moving inside his wardrobe, and that didn’t bode well as far as John was concerned.
John watched it go, blinking at the brake lights as the car slowed around a turn, shifting his gaze to Sherlock only when it was completely out of sight.
“Best not keep them waiting,” he said abruptly, turning back to nod at the nearly vanished group as he began leaving the opposite direction. “I’ll see you when you get back.”
“Auckland probably won’t be able to tie it up, will they?” he asked, turning with a frown when his question went unanswered. “Jo-” He stalled, the closing consonants dying on his tongue, all the breath in his lungs seeming to wither with them.
His coat fell limply off his shoulders, pooling in a grey half-moon around his ankles as he stared down at the bed, blood thumping in his ears, because there, nestled in the soft folds of the blanket John claimed he hogged, was a single glittering vial, liquid rolling hypnotically within the glass. A rubber tourniquet protruded from the base of the skull, where the items had apparently been hidden, and, still inside, Sherlock could see the outline of what appeared to be a syringe, still wrapped in its sanitary plastic.
Sherlock lifted a hand to the strap of his bag, nails scraping at the fabric as he gripped it, a tangible anchor for his panic-scattered mind. “They don’t know for certain,” he replied, voice only wobbling a little, and then his jaw snapped shut, a swallow forcing its way down his throat as he heard the footsteps drawing closer at his back.
“Her husband, and our victim”—John suppressed the urge to smile at the plural—“worked from home that weekend, and his office confirmed he took several conference calls with overseas clients. Up until Saturday evening, of course, when he was murdered,” Sherlock added with a casual shrug, as if to say ‘So it goes’.
“Shouldn’t we shower first? Or change or something?” he added, blushing furiously at the accidental implications of his initial question.
He stood at John’s shoulder, watching his face where it was reflected off the glass of the Hamley’s storefront, his smile wide and eyes darting everywhere, and Sherlock felt his heart pounding against the sides of his throat where it had caught, prohibiting speech. Not that he could have spoken anyway, his every thought devoted to memorizing the look on John’s face as the large animatronic teddy bears inside the display shifted their heads and arms along with the faint melody of “We Wish You A Merry Christmas” that drifted out of the speaker up above them.
“You look like you’re doing well.” he stated, noticing that indeed she was. Her skin had a healthy pallor, she appeared well rested, and there was something different about the look in her eyes - but then he always had problems reading the eyes.
“Sherlock, it’s me! It’s me!” Sherlock froze and focused his eyes through the dark until they settled on John’s face. He dropped his wrist and sat up leaning his head back against the headboard taking deep shuddering breaths.
She took a deep breath and let it out signaling that she was done speaking. Sherlock took a few moments taking a deep breath as well. He placed his hands on either side of Molly’s arms and looked her in the eye.
John and Sherlock were putting up the wallpaper, bickering slightly about lining up the pattern correctly, when they heard the bell at the street right and Mrs. Hudson head towards the door.
John turned to look and saw Sherlock curled up, forehead furrowed, and shaking slightly as he tried to muffle his sound into the pillow. John slipped out of his house shoes and turned to lay down next to Sherlock and place his arms around him.
Molly waved goodbye and with a “Ta!” followed Mrs. Hudson downstairs and the promise of viewing the photo albums from those days.
Sherlock stood as well and said “I’m sorry” though he wasn’t sure what about. Was it because it was late and they overslept? Or was it because of how they woke up. The apology hung in the air as John gave Sherlock an unidentifyable look while slipping on his house shoes; he headed into the hallway towards the kitchen. Sherlock threw on his robe and his own slippers before following closely behind John.
“Holmes!” John shouted through pain, but the force of the punch to his stomach kept him on the ground.
Irene rolled her eyes, flicking a dismissive wave as she started back toward her seat. “Don’t dawdle,” she crooned, winking lecherously.
Sherlock groaned, halting his pacing to flop down on his bed, back bouncing against the mattress as he slung an arm over his eyes. Turning his head, he caught sight of the box on his bedside table, where he’d placed it when he had arrived home, as if hoping it would suddenly reveal its secrets in the open air without him needing to peel back the lid. That looking less likely by the second, however, he reached out to snatch the sweets, holding them aloft in front of his face as he turned them over in examination.
There was an awkward pall as everyone avoided one another’s gaze, John fidgeting with the cuff of his jumper as Lestrade cleared his throat.
A door clicked open behind her, swinging in as the occupant stepped out to lean against the doorjamb. “I’ve created a monster,” Irene Adler said, a fond smile curling her scarlet lips, silver nails perched on the hip of her tailored black dress. “This must be what having children feels like.”
Sherlock had known this all along, of course, but disillusionment is one of those things that, no matter how much you tell yourself it’s coming, it still arrives like a punch to the stomach.
, John loved him, loved him all the way to terrified, but his mouth still wasn’t ready for the words, so he settled for flicking open the button of Sherlock’s trousers, peeling away the zipper and boxers, and sliding his hand firmly down the length of his cock. Sherlock was already practically sobbing, the pitch of his soft whimpers and groans telling John just how close he already was, and John didn’t draw it out, his head already swimming with exhaustion after his own undoing.
“Is this a virginity conversation?” he muttered, waving a hand between them, and John twisted away, physically recoiling from the words. “Because that ship has sailed. Sailed and sunk and been thoroughly torn apart by those underwater robots that find hundred-year-old forks and such.”
“He still might not like her,” Molly interjected. “You’re bi, and you don’t fancy everyone, do you?”
infuriating man in front of him, and that was just more than John could reasonably handle at the moment.
A few moments later, it beeped, Irene giving the room one last quick scan before turning back to him with a sigh and shake of her head.
She eyed him a moment longer, and then clipped a sharp nod, twisting on her heels and continuing off down the corridor. “Good,” she snapped, and Sherlock smiled down at his shoes, hands slipping into the pockets of his dark jeans.
John shrugged, apparently unaware himself of why he continued speaking. “We dated for a while, but… Yeah.” He coughed a couple times, looking back around at the Legos. “So! Ready to go?”
But John Watson was here regardless, defiant, his navy suit rumpled and creased from travel, his eyes heavy with aggrieved exhaustion, a pulse point thrumming in his neck as his fingertips twitched at his sides, and, though far from infallible, John could never be called cruel. Hot-headed, stubborn, and clueless, perhaps, but he would not have come all this way to tell Sherlock a lie, however impossible a truth it appeared.
Sherlock’s eyebrow lifted, and his arms untwisted to fall to his sides. “Yes,” he answered slowly. “Why?”
Sherlock blinked across at him, but John looked just as dumbstruck, his eyebrows furrowing down at the floor as if he couldn’t figure out why he’d said such a thing either.
“It’s alright to get close to people, Sherlock,” he said, smiling reassuringly as Sherlock peered up through his lashes. “You don’t have to be embarrassed about it.”
In his mind, of course, this interruption was met with John leaping up, possibly tossing an insult or two at Mary, and running after Sherlock into the neon-lit night, but he wasn’t quite prepared to risk it, so he ducked into the bookstore that sat almost directly opposite the café. Luckily—or maybe it wasn’t, given the roiling in his stomach—John and Mary were seated at a table near the window, clearly visible when passing cars weren’t obscuring his view.
“Well…no,” Sherlock murmured, shuffling across the mattress a little, moving up between John and the window. “I just- Well, what am
“I-I have class,” he murmured, nodding his head back toward the corner of the building, and he could see John slump in his peripheral vision, his posture defeated.
“Yesterday, when you asked what I was doing on Friday,” he replied, and Sherlock quirked a brow, still lost. “I told you I was doing an event, but I didn’t invite you.”
Sherlock lingered in his room as long as he could, even going so far as to reorganize his sock index—by fabric, this time—before giving in to the boredom and gnawing in his stomach.
He couldn’t look up, couldn’t do anything more than open his eyes at the carpet, even as he heard the floorboards creak with John’s tentative steps closer.
“If this is the part where you threaten to castrate me or something equally vile should I ever hurt him, you needn’t bother,” Sherlock interjected, finally understanding, and Harry faltered only a moment with surprise before she set her jaw once more.
Sherlock snapped his head up in alarm, frowning between the blond boy and the old family friend, his confusion growing as Mrs. Hudson’s face lit up with a bright smile.
“What, right now?” Sherlock replied, blinking with feigned innocence. “Phew, that’s convenient! I was thinking I’d have to suffer through this lecture first!”
“Oh, god, I didn’t puke in the cab, did I?” John asked, eyes wide with terror, cheeks already darkening with shame before Sherlock shook his head.
“No one deserves this more than you,” Mike finished, and then swallowed, dipping his head briefly to his lap, and John figured it was about time he said
“So,” Mike interrupted, a knowing smile on his face as John and Sherlock turned toward him, “how’s the roommate situation working out?”
“I wanted to get some associates of mine looking out for any information on the new dealer Carlisle was talking about,” he replied cryptically as he moved his pillow, propping it up behind him to sit at the head of his bed, laying the files out between them.
“Right there,” John said, delicately placing a hand in a gap amongst the photos and papers so he could lean forward and point at the proper paragraph. “‘Gravin was arrested after new evidence was uncovered by the Metropolitan Police, who were informed of the woman’s possible involvement by an anonymous tip,’” John read, planting his other hand on the ground by Sherlock’s knee for better support. “You’re the anonymous tip!”
John snorted, opening his mouth to reply when Sherlock’s mother materialized at John’s side, looping her arm through his, his forearm lifting instinctively.
Mary smiled regretfully, shaking her head. “No, I already told them I’d go. What all are you planning to do?”
,” she allowed, rolling her eyes as she settled the cup in her lap, “but we still need the practice. From the top?” she asked, and John nodded, balancing his tea on his knee as he hoisted up his paperback.
Things couldn’t go too far in a dirty backroom of Scotland Yard, however—and they probably had to talk about a thing or two before that anyway—and it wasn’t long before John wound him down, easing the fervor almost imperceptibly as he gradually slowed their mouths and softened the swirls of his fingers in Sherlock’s hair. They were just breathing now, foreheads pressed together as Sherlock seemed to hang off of John, his hands gripped into the blond’s striped jumper while John practically held him up by the waist. John’s fingers were stroking up and down the back of Sherlock’s neck, circling around the knots of his spine as they traced their path.
“I dunno,” he replied mockingly, heel kicking out across the asphalt as he stepped closer. “Because we never did. Because I want to.”
What color would the kitchen backsplash be? Could they pick it out, scan through tile samples and bicker over color combinations? Would they have to help put it in, getting grout on their hands and in their hair, the chalky white standing out bright against John’s skin and blending into the blond? Was there a fireplace? Sherlock had always wanted a fireplace, the only one in their house being in his father’s study, and he wasn’t ever allowed in there.
He shook his head, internally berating himself for the lapse in judgment. He mentally blockaded what he dubbed ‘The John Problem’, refusing to let something as petty as an undoubtedly temporary friendship interfere with his work. The work came first, always, and he could not allow John to take up undue space that he needed to devote to processing. Sherlock may have accidentally stumbled into a friendship, but that didn’t mean it had to be important. He snapped open the case file in front of him, fanning out the pictures and steepling his fingers beneath his chin as he scanned the four crime scenes.
Sherlock insisted on going to check on the boyfriend’s alibi on his own, sending John back to school with Mrs. Hudson and the bags, promising he would get a cab back before it got too late. Still, it was nearing 11, and Sherlock had not returned, leaving John sitting on his bed and staring at the two, red bags he’d sat neatly on the opposite mattress. He’d avoided it up until this point, but the worry had become too much.
Sherlock chuckled down at his shoes, John’s higher laugh joining him as they pressed up the incline. “True enough,” he said, nodding as he lifted his head, smiling back at John’s grin. “True enough.”
The office door creaked behind them, and John instinctively reached across to cover Sherlock’s mouth, the man freezing in apparent shock a moment before John felt a sharp pinch of teeth on the skin of his index finger and yanked his hand away, shaking it in the limited space between them.
The men blinked at him a moment, and then rushed forward, eager smiles on their faces as Sherlock moved into the room.
“It hasn’t been played since… Well, it could use a day out,” John continued, and then, with a glance at Sherlock’s blood-bereft face, retreated. “Or you could use one of the others.” He pointed to a section of shelves to their left. “You wouldn’t be disturbed in here, but I could always get you a room down at the concert hall, if you’d prefer. Hell, I could get you the concert hall,” he said, his chuckle quivering as his words tumbled faster. “The National Orchestra is performing at the theater with
He tightened his arm around her waist, releasing her legs to land on the ground, and she righted herself with a satisfied huff, flipping her hair back over her shoulders.
“I ate yesterday,” Sherlock answered, shoving the plate against John’s hand before he’d even completely withdrawn it.
“What?” he asked, mouth already quirking with anticipated laughter, and Sherlock ducked his head, plucking at John’s shirt as nervous energy pulsed through his fingers.
Sherlock shifted against the rough stone of the building, his coat scraping as it snagged, and he twitched his fingers anxiously around the cup in his hand, looking once again to the door John would pop out of any second.
“What was that?” he asked, looking between John’s face and where his fingers were frozen on the front of the drawer.
“Look,” John commanded, Sherlock snapping his head around with a glower, but John only lifted his brows, pushing lightly at Sherlock’s head in encouragement, and the detective complied, albeit with a grudging huff.
“He talks a lot,” she muttered, rolling her eyes. “Never shuts up, actually. Always going on about how he’s right under their noses and they don’t suspect a thing; guy’s a classic narcissist. Got a temper on him too; I’ve had to toss him out of here a time or two for going overboard with some of the girls.”
“Don’t you want to get a box?” his mother had asked him last week when they’d passed by the valentine display in Sainsbury’s. “You can give one out to everyone in your class. Might even make some new friends.”
It was an odd feeling, like finally being able to breathe and yet also suddenly not having any lungs, but Sherlock was smiling regardless, teeth pressing into a corner of his bottom lip as he flopped contentedly down atop the warm duvet.
1) This chapter has time jumps in it, indicated by the rows of ********* because I thought making you click through to a new chapter would've broken the thread a little too much
sitting next to Molly and Greg at the restaurant. They’re always holding hands.” He wrinkled his nose in disgust, Irene rolling her eyes as she swatted him playfully across the shoulder.
“I can imagine,” Sherlock mused, craning his neck back to take in the entirety of it, snatches of turrets and spires visible over the horizon of the front roofline, but his eyes were quickly drawn down as the front doors swept open, revealing a woman who was either very petite or the doors were even taller than they looked from where he stood.
John blinked dolefully, the melancholic music from the RSPCA adverts playing in Sherlock’s head. “But it’s
John stopped near the back, where pop culture seemed to infer the more well-liked people sat. “You want the window or the aisle?”
“You have to turn it over,” he said, curling his hand in gesture, and Sherlock wordlessly complied, turning the ball in his hands to reveal the answer.
It hit him all at once then, the reality of the situation, that he was completely naked—socks included—in John Watson’s flat, on John Watson’s bed, and with none other than John Watson. Who wasn’t naked, which was suddenly completely unacceptable.
He froze, gasp whistling over his lips as his eyes flew open, his mind falling silent to leave only the steady thrum of his heart in his ears. The clock on the mantel was thunderous as he listened, eyes scanning over as much of the moonlit flat as he could see without moving, because he’d thought- He could’ve sworn-
“Sherlock,” John cautioned firmly, but there was a hint of a smile tickling the corners of his lips.
“I know someone at the Yard,” she replied, stiff expression swiftly turning back into a smirk. “Or, rather, I know what he likes.” She waggled her eyebrows in obvious implication, and John huffed a laugh, shaking his head as he looked away a moment. Irene didn’t seem to like that. “I know what everyone likes, you know,” she continued, heels clicking against the floor as she began to glide over the room. “I can see it on them. The same way Sherlock can tell what you had for breakfast, I can tell if someone likes being tied or doing the tying.”
“Yeah, sounds good,” she said, her smile growing to match Greg’s grin. “Angelo’s?” she questioned, looking to John again, and he nodded, looking over her shoulder to Sherlock’s furrowed expression.
Sherlock snorted, eyes automatically drawn back to his parents, but found a different set looking back at him, Emily’s starched ringlets bouncing as she waved. His mouth curled in a grimace he hoped looked like a smile from a distance, hand flicking side-to-side in one sharp gesture.
He closed his eyes, blowing out a breath at the ceiling as he waited for the response. If it was a girl, he could play it out, become thoroughly unpleasant and tactfully drive her away, but, if it wasn’t… Well, it didn’t narrow the suspect pool down by as much—a disproportionate amount of the students in his science classes being male—but it certainly made things much less awkward. And a lot less pointless.
“Well, that depends,” Sherlock said, leaning forward as he planted his elbows on his knees, chin perching on his hands as they folded. “How much did you use on Jeanette Parker?”
“You were shot,” he whispered, every frayed fiber stretching out from the torn strip etching itself permanently into his mind.
“No,” the detective-turned-pyrotechnics-expert replied. “I just have to hit the switch. It will run by itself after that.”
In the few days that he’d been living at the Watson house, John and his relationship—as he liked to call it in his head—had not progressed beyond holding hands, John clearly frustratingly concerned for his emotional state. It was thoughtful, Sherlock had to admit, and probably necessary, but also extraordinarily annoying, spurring spirals of self-doubt in Sherlock’s head as he began to question whether he’d misread John’s intentions. There was no room for doubt now, however, holding the present John had saved for two years in his hands, and, for all he’d imagined and eagerly anticipated this moment, it was suddenly terrifying, pulling on that silver ribbon feeling less like opening a belated Christmas present, and more like opening a door to an entirely unknown planet and hoping you could breathe the air.
“No, I am not riding in a police car. The pictures are still circulating from last time! … Only if you confiscate all recording equipment before our arrival. … How is that ridiculous!?” Sherlock continued raving, his hair bouncing with furious shakes and rattles of his head, and John just watched him, time slipping away as he stared.
John’s smile only curled half his mouth, but it lit up his eyes, blue dancing with pride as his cheeks turned a faint pink. “Got the letter last weekend,” he continued, self-consciously tapping his thumbs against the table. “I-I haven’t told anyone yet.”
Sherlock opened his mouth, turning back to the experiment, and then let his lips close, thinking better of it.
Sherlock hadn’t known John in secondary school, but he imagined he was much the same, John Watson seeming a thing that had spawned fully formed rather than grown, a fixed point time had chosen to revolve around instead of attempting to budge. Time hadn’t brought him into John’s orbit until two years ago, however, Mike Stamford—a friend of Sherlock’s from secondary school—practically dragging him out of his dorm one night to join him and some of his friends from Barts for an event their rugby team had organized.
? He would ask John, but, of course, John couldn’t help him much when it came to understanding John. He decided it couldn’t do any harm to try it.
A clock chimed loudly somewhere in the house, John counting seven chimes, but he knew from the light pouring in his windows that it must be later than that. With a groan, he tugged at the duvet, intending to shield his eyes, but the blanket snapped taut, held down by some unseen weight. Slowly, eyes still blinking against the light, he craned his neck, trying to find the culprit. Which turned out to be six feet of consulting detective, elbows perched on his crossed knees, pale face resting atop his folded hands as he stared down.
Exactly one minute after their visitors had left, a veritable stampede of footsteps hit the stairs. Mycroft entered first, closely followed by Mrs. Hudson, but John was some distance behind, eyes following his socks as they moved across the living room rug.
John dropped his mouth, and she laughed, their hands disentangling as she went back to her coffee. “You said it was good!”
“Oh, the usual stuff,” John said, feet scuffing along the pavement. “Why Bart’s, what I think I could contribute to the academic environment or whatever, why medicine.”
Relief washed through wide, blue orbs as John sighed, dropping his head and momentarily closing his eyes. “Christ, are you alright?”
It looked like just an ordinary house, nothing distinguishing it from any of the other row houses on the block, but, to those who knew, it was known as ‘The House’, the matching piece to Irene’s ‘The Woman’. The interior was all dark wood and rich rugs, nothing obviously unseemly, but the rooms were almost too neat, too fragrant, the kind of clean that always covers up the ugliest of dirt.
“And this one too, no doubt,” Ben guffawed, elbowing Sherlock in the arm, and the detective barely managed to twist a smile out of a wince. “Swear I see him more than my own lads!”
There was a long moment of silence, John tracing patterns in the grass with the capped end of his pen.
“What are you looking at?” Sherlock snapped, much angrier than he felt, which was closer to flustered than anything resembling anger.
“Definitely,” John replied, nodding eagerly as he took the extra pair of goggles Sherlock magically produced from nowhere. Hovering at his roommate’s shoulder, he leaned down to watch as the boy plucked through the pile of red-speckled crisps. He was dimly aware of the sound of a door closing behind them, signaling Mrs. Hudson’s exit, but the progress of Sherlock’s tongs toward the flame quickly drowned out any other thoughts.
“What about water?” he asked, breathing uneven from exertion, his whole body turning as he glanced between them.
!” he sputtered, apparently having found his breaking point, and he stepped back, face turning away. “That’s-
“Sherlock!” John hissed at the man’s back before it vanished into the darkness, illuminated in silhouette a moment later when he clicked on a torch. “What the
She’d been marginally more help on Friday, only pretending to fall asleep twice while he was bemoaning his predicament during their smoke break, and had even offered to go with him to the game that night, but he had declined.
“Really?” he snapped, focusing on Irene, but the woman didn’t even bothering sneering, her eyes sad as she moved toward him, pressing a cigarette to his chest.
Hello all! So, same reminders as last update: I am going to LFCC this coming weekend (Sherlock panel on Saturday ahhh!) and would love to meet up with some of you there, if you're going (or somewhere else if you're not), and I have a new email address set up for you guys here to contact me about fanfic or beta-ing or reviewing or LFCC or whatever, and it's prettysherlocksoldier@gmail.com. ALSO, is anyone going to that big picnic in Regent's Park on the 19th? But now, on with the show!
John had been told he was good at this, but not even all the words of the handful of women before combined spoke half as loud as Sherlock’s silence.
“Well, I’ve never had any trouble with it,” Sherlock answered, smiling as John laughed, pulling open the back door and waving the taller man ahead of him.
“Congratulations,” Sherlock deadpanned, and Lestrade glared while John hid a smirk behind a segment of Kit-Kat. “Look,” he continued, slapping a finger down on a spot on the black-printed paper, “he ordered a medium coffee, a small, iced latte, and a cheese danish.”
The pile of papers got to John, and he plucked one of each before passing them over his shoulder to Sherlock, who snatched them so quickly, John had to bite back a curse at the paper cut singeing the draped skin between his thumb and palm. He glared over his shoulder, but Sherlock seemed not to notice, so he focused on reading along.
Mary sighed, leaning into him in an embarrassing display of dramatics, and Sherlock was very lucky looks couldn’t kill. “And in the wood, where often you and I upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie, emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,” she urged, twisting to Molly, leaving John free to glare hotly across at where his boyfriend was clutching onto a chair for support, “there my Lysander and myself shall meet; and thence from Athens turn away our eyes, to seek new friends and stranger companies.” She then turned abruptly, tugging John forward with a bitten-off yelp as she waved a hand dramatically toward Molly. “Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us; and good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!” She spun back to John, lifting his hands up within hers to clutch them between their chests as she dropped her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight from lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.”
Molly huffed through her nose with amusement, rolling her head to smile up at him. “Sherlock, I’ve known you since primary school,” she said tenderly, and that was all she said.
The crumbling resolve was practically visible in his eyes, the blue almost tonally shifting brighter, but there was a sudden flash of ferocity through his gaze, and he shifted his weight to one arm, the other hand lifting between them. “You tell me,” he ordered, finger pointing sternly down at the brunette. “If you- Even for a
Irene lifted a brow. “Because he pretended to be dead,” she said, voice slowing as if he’d been hit on the head. “I had to do
He rolled his suitcase into the room, everything he owned condensed into a bag and a cardboard box. Placing the box on the bed with a muffled thump, he surveyed his temporary surroundings. It was nothing remarkable: faded, blue walls, single bed cloaked in a grey duvet, wooden chest of drawers and wardrobe, and a desk shoved in the corner next to the window.
John practically growled in response, fingernails scraping across his scalp as he tightened his hold in Sherlock’s hair, and that was the last thing Sherlock remembered until they were pulling apart for air, both shaking as they panted over one another’s lips.
“You’ve already met Mary,” Harry said, and the two exchanged nods, “but I don’t know if you ever met Irene. She’s in the cafe a lot.”
“No, he’d want to know,” Mycroft answered the sergeant, and Sherlock’s interest genuinely piqued at that, his head lifting off the pillow to completely free his ears. “It might help.”
“Come on!” Sherlock urged, jerking his head before twisting on his heels and vanishing down the corridor again.
“I had Donovan pull a few cases,” he explained, beckoning to Anderson with a curl of his fingers, the slight man shuffling into the room to pause at Lestrade’s elbow. “Thought it might- Ya know,” he mumbled, tipping his head toward the box, and Sherlock nodded, a twinge of guilt nibbling at the pit he couldn’t shake from his stomach. The older man then cleared his throat, shuffling away toward where Mycroft still hovered in the doorway, his watchful eyes slightly narrowed as they swept over Anderson’s back. “Well, you, er, explain your…system, then,” he muttered gruffly, giving Anderson a brisk nod. “And then get back. I need you helping out downstairs,” he added, casting the man a pointed look, but the subtly was futile, Sherlock knowing from the second Anderson entered the room that he was helping the bomb squad sift through debris looking for pieces of the incendiary device—the soot under his nails had taken care of that.
, John, it’s just a joke,” she murmured, waving a dismissive hand over her shoulder, and, though still glowering, John moved to walk beside her again. “Obviously, it’d be this one with the stick up his ass,” she added, bobbing a thumb to Sherlock, who only shrugged, and then they both spun around, turning with alarm as John stopped, coughing violently down at the pavement.
“Testing the explosive properties of different flavors of Walkers,” Sherlock replied tonelessly, picking up what looked to be a piece of sour cream and onion.
Lestrade startled away from him, eyes wide, but Sherlock couldn’t stop, the words tearing painfully through his throat in a way that had nothing to do with his illness.
“Nice?” John scoffed, leaning forward to drop his tea onto the table. “He was eyeing you up like a piece of meat! Honestly, where is Irene even
“Perhaps we should table this for another time, gentlemen,” John said as he stood, sweeping his papers into a loose pile and gathering them up. “Give everyone time to look over the proposals.”
Irene shook her head. “No, he never let that slip. All I can tell you is he’s blond, well-built. Pretty average looking guy, really,” she finished with a shrug.
John chuckled. “Okay,” he whispered, closing the door until only a crack of light remained, “I’ll be right back.”
Sherlock had bought the desk at the start of that new year, the first of many changes to follow in the next few months. Molly and him had moved out of their apartment, finding their own small studios closer to the office and within two kilometers of one another.
“Practical?” John scoffed, rattling his head as he looked back from across the dim room. “You don’t just move in with someone you’re dating because it’s
It was nothing, really. Just an infatuation, and that was perfectly natural. John was the only friend he’d ever had, after all, and he frequently praised Sherlock’s deductions with a litany of exclamations. Of course he was going to grow fond of John when he was constantly throwing around compliments, boosting his ego. The fact that he could fire a gun so efficiently was just a bonus, an interesting piece of the puzzle, and that was the only reason it had captivated Sherlock so entirely. He was only attracted to the puzzle of it. It had nothing to do with John, nothing at all. Infatuation, that’s all it was. Temporary. Fleeting. It would fade soon enough. He just had to wait it out.
“As you wish, milady,” Sherlock teased, tipping his head in a faint bow, and Irene rolled her eyes, throwing a middle finger up over her shoulder as she turned away from him. He chuckled, shaking his head at her retreating figure, and then twisted on his heels, ambling toward chemistry as the crowds thinned in the corridors.
“IT’S THE SAME SCHOOL!” he railed, tempering his tone before he collected too many stares. “Who are we even cheering for, misplaced aggression?”
Sherlock barely reacted at all, a flicker of eyelids and tremble of lips, but John knew exactly what it meant.
A moment later, however, he let out a frustrated growl of a sigh, hoisting his bag higher onto his shoulder. “Fine,” he muttered, and Sherlock beamed, “fine. But you
“You went to see Lestrade,” John seemed content to fill in, rounding the edge of the table to stand at Sherlock’s right, “to talk about the mole.”
John’s hands were on him in less than a blink, fingers gripping around the back of his neck to keep his head from falling back again. “Careful, you might have a concussion. We gotta get you out of here. Can you stand?”
I know what a Nerf gun is,” he muttered, gripping tight to rattle John’s hand as the man laughed. “I have an
“I’d better get going. I told Molly I had to fill out some paperwork at the station this morning and then I was all hers.”
“And I couldn’t help you!?” John countered, waving his arms out in gesture. “I thought we were a team, Sherlock! I thought you trusted me enough for that!”
“Of course I do,” Sherlock chirped, grinning broadly as he scanned the street for a cab. “I know everything.”
“I think what Molly’s trying to say,” Mary interrupted, flashing Molly a small smile, which she returned by wilting back into the couch in relief, “is that…we’re your friends. And we…support you.” She lifted her eyebrows a bit, further pushing the subtext that had John’s throat closing up. “And it’s not- We’re not-” She rolled her eyes, growling in self-frustration as she shifted to the edge of the couch and leaned so close, he could smell her perfume. “We’re not going to tell anyone,” she nearly whispered, eyes soft but pointed, “and you don’t have to talk about it, but- Well, we’re not
,” Sherlock groaned, explaining this for the fourth time and still somehow feeling guilty about it, “this way, we can catch the thief red-handed. I suspect it’s one of the employees, someone with access to the computer system. We’re inputted as some famous someone or other”—he waved his hand in the air, dismissing the details—“who are quite publically going to be in attendance at a charity event tonight. It’s the perfect opportunity for the thief; he won’t be able to pass it up.”
He lifted a finger, simultaneously scolding and signaling to wait, and then made a deliberate turn to the door, tugging it open in a grand swoop before looking back to Sherlock. He popped his eyebrows, driving home the point, and Sherlock performed a gold-medal-worthy eye-roll before gesturing for John to go ahead. John grinned, stepping down to the path, Sherlock closing the door behind them. “Did you-”
“No, please,” Irene Adler said, tone bored and eyebrow raised as she squinted at them in the light, “don’t shoot.”
“I’m serious,” he argued, and Sherlock flicked his brows, shrugging lightly as he looked out across the carriage, the passing lights of the tunnel reflecting in rapid stripes across his eyes.
.” He held his glare as Sherlock opened his mouth, but seemed to think better of defending himself, and instead closed his lips, turning mutely away and quickly grabbing the glass syrup dispenser in front of him.
Sherlock hesitated a long moment, long enough that John thought he might fall asleep and miss the decision, but then Sherlock slowly shifted his legs off the bed, lifting up just enough to pull the blankets out from under his body before climbing back in, gingerly covering himself with the duvet. He lied rigidly on his back, John resting on his side as he watched the brunette stare at the ceiling.
“Of course it was!” he urged, and Sherlock’s eyes widened, though a crease of suspicion lingered between his brows. “It was extraordinary, it-it was…” John faded away, growing self-conscious under the man’s persistent stare. “What?” he murmured, and Sherlock seemed to startle himself out of a trance, blinking rapidly as he rattled his head.
Of course, the answer turned out to be rather anticlimactic, a piece of white paper taped to the plastic window proclaiming
,” Mike corrected, ignoring John’s razorblade stare. “He’s that ballet dancer John’s been lusting after for months.”
“Hey!” John barked, glowering down at the boy. “I helped you with your two hundred and forty types of tobacco ash-”
Sherlock gaped, blinking furiously, and then quickly settled into a glare. “Where are we going? And I am
. Very well. Far too well, actually, Sherlock should probably get him inside before somebody noticed.
“Don’t think you’re out of the woods yet,” his father said, wrapping an arm around his wife, her pinched expression softening as she leaned into his shoulder. “Eileen’s still a bit
Some of John’s confusion must have shown on his face, because she smiled sagely, leaning forward again toward him.
Sherlock peeled one eye open, blinking John’s face into focus, the man biting his lip as his hands fidgeted over his knees.
understands it,” he began, and Sherlock smiled up through his lashes, looking slightly reassured, “but, basically, it’s- Okay, here.” He pushed at the popcorn bag in Sherlock’s hand, tilting it up to halt the flow of kernels, and then placed the small bag he was holding beside the microwave, pulling out two pieces of popcorn and sitting them down on a clear section of table. “Say this player has the ball,” he began, pointing at one of the kernels, and Sherlock, though quirking a brow, nodded. “If they’re running up the pitch”—he slowly slid the popcorn back across the table—“none of their teammates are allowed to be in front of them. So, if this player,” he continued, pressing a finger to the second kernel and pushing it out ahead, “moves in front of him, he’s in an offside position.”
“Did you make any more progress on that homeless case after I went to bed?” John said, knowing that was the source of Sherlock’s distress.
“Probably,” Sherlock answered with a shrug, turning back to the window. John watched as his eyebrows lowered, his jaw tightening. “Why, would it bother you?” he muttered stiffly, glancing back toward John out of the corner of his eye.
“Who?” Sherlock muttered, slipping his phone back into his pocket as he returned to sit on his bed across from John.
“No,” Sherlock said, happy to have something else to focus on as he fetched the file, but a corner of his mind palace was still playing ‘best friend’ on repeat, analyzing and cataloging every single arch and twist of John’s mouth as it had formed the words. “I think he’s the one who
The castle was just as grand on the inside, but less austere, a warmth emanating from the stained wood details, plush rugs, roaring fires, and Christmas bursting from every flat surface or hook. The foyer was an alternating starburst of black and white marble, but the remainder of the castle was mostly hardwood with the exception of the bustling chef’s kitchen—which he doubted he would ever find again—bathrooms, and the grand ballroom, where ornate golden chandeliers reflected on pale swirls of marble, the curved back wall of the room entirely glass to overlook the twinkling town and towering mountains, the world seeming to stretch on forever from their gilded perch.
John simultaneously growled and sighed with frustration. “Until you’re sure? Sherlock, I could help you be sure, now why won’t you just-”
Sherlock scoffed instinctively, but his brain slowly crawled to the same conclusion as he huffed a haughty retort. “Shock? That’s absurd. Why would I be in shock?”
“You could still go,” he encouraged. “I’ll be fine tucking myself in,” he added, hoping the jest would lend credence to his spurring.
“I-I suppose,” he murmured, and John puffed a laugh, bowing his chin to press his lips to Sherlock’s knuckle, a tiny gesture that nevertheless stole Sherlock’s breath, John’s comfort with casual intimacies never ceasing to amaze.
“Wow,” John muttered, feeling woefully inadequate all of a sudden. “So, you can do that with anyone?” he asked, turning his face up to the man. “Figure them out like that?”
“I’ll have a glass of that,” he said, passing the menu up to him, and John took it, bowing his head as he stepped back.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Sherlock asked abruptly, and John turned, curious. Sherlock was looking at him rather more earnestly than John thought the subject matter warranted. “I would’ve done it better if I’d known. There was a sodium reaction I thought might be particularly impressive, but the oxidizers required were rather volatile and I didn’t bother with it, but I would have if I’d-”
John reentered the room behind him, a rustle of clothing and faint impact tremor signaling his kneeling. “Here,” he murmured, and a soft pressure fell against Sherlock’s shoulders. “You had books all over yours. Hope you don’t mind.” He folded his duvet around Sherlock’s body, his arms wrapping around Sherlock’s own for a moment before he withdrew, and Sherlock clutched tightly at the edges of the blanket, tugging it firmer around him.
John blinked. “You do remember what this is for, don’t you?” he asked, and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Cheers,” Sherlock deadpanned, but smiled when John chuckled, turning back to the coffee as Sherlock moved to the counter at his side. “The sweatshirt fits though,” he remarked, slipping his hands into the front pocket, and John nodded, clinking the spoon against the rim of the orange Dalek to dislodge the last few drops.
John shushed him and stroked his head as he might for Rosie. What else could he do when confronted with his Sherlock in this state. The cries eventually grew more quiet and his breathing name steady and even as he fell back asleep inside of John’s arms. John remained awake for only minutes more as he tried to examine what he was feeling but sleep shortly took him as well.
I once heard your brother call you emotional and I thought it was the funniest thing at the time. But he was right, wasn’t he? You are so full of emotion but you just keep it locked away. Maybe in that mind palace of yours?”
Sherlock stopped speaking, startled by her outburst. He noted that John and Lestrade had done away with all pretense of chatting and that Mrs. Hudson who had entered the main room carrying a tray of tea had also stopped to watch them.
John moved closer next, bringing his face up to Sherlock’s, close enough that their noses touched, his eyes asking a question only Sherlock could answer.
Mycroft and his parents called Sherlock emotional, and you could see why. His compassion grew and he let himself feel. It hid, more often than not, behind his normally cold exterior; but John, who knew Sherlock better than anyone, could see. The veil was lifted more at home than elsewhere and he and Rosie got to know a new Sherlock.
Cracking open Sherlock’s door John saw him bare chested, twisting in the sheets. Sherlock was shouting “no!” over and over at some unseen but not unknown phantom. They’d both been having these nightmares for a while, but Sherlock was usually not the one to cry out.
If you had asked him last week he would have said that John simply thought of him as a brother or best friend, but given the present situation of them holding each other in bed, Sherlock felt comfortable putting his previous assumption up for examination.
The first day they returned to 221B Baker Street to examine the damage was difficult. It was close on the heels of the trauma that Eurus had inflicted and seeing the devastation to their flat was disheartening. They were relieved to realize that the blast was not as severe as it could have been. Esurus hadn’t wanted to kill them and had of course predicted their ability to escape it alive, though not unscathed, and tailored the blast to that. The apartment was ruined, but it was there structurally and some of the heartier items survived. John and Sherlock shared a silence as they dug through the rubble pulling out what they could identify. The steer skull here, a stack of books that had been under a chair there; they piled it off to one side in boxes so that a cleaning crew could come through and remove the debris, giving them a clean canvas.
John grumbled. “I forgot that I need to visit James Carberry. He hasn’t been feeling well lately and asked if I could give him a second opinion to confirm his own.” The last part of John’s explanation irked him the most. James Carberry was a classmate of John’s back at the University of London, but lately they hadn’t been seeing eye-to-eye. Most of this tension was due to John objecting to Carberry’s marginally unethical medical practices.
John blinked a few times. “Holmes?” But before he could further berate Sherlock, something out of the corner of his eye caught his attention as the hansom sped away from the prison. In fact, it was a figure of man running in the opposite direction from Westgate. John’s eyes widened as he realized that the man running away was Hans Schuller.
“Of course, sir. Mr. Whitehall will arrive early tomorrow morning.” The maid nodded before disappearing.
John swore to himself as he tripped trying to catch up with Sherlock who was halfway down the street and about to round a corner. John had to prevent himself from shouting for Sherlock to wait for him; he felt ridiculous in his disguise, having been forced to wear Mycroft’s clothes.
The heiress gasped as Sherlock straightened up, holding a necklace full of precious pearls. The heiress gasped again as she accepted the necklace that was now soiled from the garden’s dirt.
Lestrade shook his head. He took a moment to look around the space before lowering his voice. “Holmes, you can’t see Dr. Watson. We’ve already taken him to Westgate.”
William grumbled something about not getting enough sleep before leaving. Sherlock turned around to face John.
“Thank you, Madame Loire.” John said with a smile as he accepted some cake before trying to pour himself some tea, but it was a little awkward because the cart was facing too far away from him.
Sherlock nodded as he sat back in his chair. “I already know that Lestrade. It’s bigger than you realize.”
“We’re moving you to Westgate before the trial, but as you can see there’s little recourse you have. You might as well confess to save everyone the time and energy.”
There was another pause and some low murmuring before the door to the chapel closed. Sherlock waited before opening the door.
The disrupter coughed again causing some audience members to grumble, but the speaker pressed on, never seemingly losing his resolve.
“Witnesses saw two men leaving the scene.” Lestrade looked past his superior to stare back at the house. His superior continued on.
Despite how typically cautious John was, the thought that whoever was framing him might be in the sawmill compelled him to march into the dilapidated building and demand justice.
Sherlock nodded with a grin. “Perhaps, but I think we would be doing a disservice to our kind hosts if we do not investigate.” The response earned a groan from John who could no longer retain his polite composure in front of others over his companion’s antics.
“Mr. McArthur?” Sherlock started, looking at the older Mr. McArthur, “could you please perform the ‘Lotus Encounter’?”
“What’s going on?” Sherlock finally appeared in the sitting room, “Detective Baynes, what’s going on?”
Mary began to sob as Sherlock stood rigid in her embrace. He looked at Mycroft who looked bemused by the situation before he finally patted Mary on the back.
“Well,” Mycroft began as it became clear that the atmosphere in the room had taken a dark turn, “perhaps we should retire to the sitting room for some coffee and cake?”
John smiled back at Sherlock who finally faced him directly. John then turned around to board the train, waving at Sherlock before disappearing into the corridor. As soon as Sherlock could no longer see John, he turned to walk briskly along the platform while the train employee was now calling for last minute boarders. Sherlock looked down the length of the train, spotting a shady individual he had noticed while saying goodbye to John standing near the edge of the platform.
Sherlock motioned for Mr. McArthur to remain calm. “Also, it appears that the carriage house inhabitant wears a size 10 shoe…”
John laughed again. “Let’s get you back to Baker Street so you can rest.” He kissed Sherlock on the top of his head before helping him into the hansom that had been waiting for them.
Sherlock shrugged as he pointed to a portmanteau for John to haul. “Really, Watson. Sometimes I feel like you forget who I am. I
“What?” John finally let out as the mounting casualties related to his colleague’s murder began to sink in.
Everyone turned toward the entrance of the parlor at the sound of a voice calling for Mary coming from the hall.
“Lestrade,” Sherlock walked over to the desk to pick up the piece of the HMS Victory, “here’s your thief. Also, nice to make your acquaintance, Dr. Wheeler.” He motioned toward the man who had entered the study with Lestrade.
. John groaned to himself as he held an increasingly excited Gladstone. John tried to shush Gladstone one more time, but the dog broke away, barking excitedly.
A boisterous bump followed by a crash from upstairs interrupted James, stopping everyone midsentence. Mary screamed causing her father to pat her on the shoulder to get her to remain calm.
“Really, Watson? Now I must add ‘thief’ to your file?” Sherlock huffed as he walked toward the direction of the nearest street to hail a hansom.
He could hear Mycroft’s voice on the other side of the door which made him cringe. His whole body shuttered as he turned over onto his other side to avoid listening to his brother-in-law complain about god knows what when his brother and companion were on the run from all of London’s police.
But before Sherlock could get a word in, Bridget waved him off, motioning for Clara to follow her. “We’re leaving this instance. Tell Mycroft that he needs better security!”
Sherlock turned around again to sit next to John. “Watson,” he started in a low voice, “I promise to make this up to you. But first, let us figure this out together.”
John patted Sherlock on the shoulder as they watched everyone speak to one another about what to do with the cemetery and the old house.
John nodded with his own smile as he placed a hand on Sherlock’s. They only waited a second longer before Bridget appeared. Sherlock motioned for her to take a seat.
“Do you think…” John started, choosing his words carefully, “do you think…someone…or someones…wanted…to get you involved, Holmes?”
Sherlock laughed as he motioned for John to pick up their luggage as he descended the hansom to greet Mr. McArthur.
Sherlock paid the driver before descending the hansom. He motioned for John to follow him around the block until they reached the back of their house. Sherlock looked around himself before looking through one of the windows: they could see Mrs. Hudson speaking with a police officer in the kitchen.
Sherlock nodded as he approached the window in question. The pane was ajar unlike the others that had been shut closed. Both men peered out the window to find a knife outside in the grass.
“It’s Mary,” Mary answered curtly, briefly frustrated that Mycroft couldn’t seem to care to get her name right still, “and of course. Whatever you need me to do, Sherlock, I’ll do it.”
“If you ask me, his master is one poor fellow.” The second guard snorts. That’s the younger one (has a rare motorcycle, which he devotes his every spare minute to).
“It's still better than how it is now! You could even behave worse if it makes you feel better. Actually, you'd been acting as a decent person for quite a while before the... before the arrest.”
At that moment Sherlock raises his eyes to her and takes a second look. An attempt to greet a slave invites a certain degree of interest. Everything becomes clear almost instantly. She doesn't seem to be a secret abolitionist, so it has to be the only other alternative. He's right: she has a simple business card in her fingers.
