I felt my face flush, and nodded. If I but altered our position, pulled his body a few inches up toward the headboard so we could lay in closer parallel – but no. We were not young men; neither of our bodies could easily rush down that heady path so soon, and I felt Morpheus’s beguiling presence calling me. With Watson by my side I thought I could rest easily.
,” I sometimes fall far short of the mark when it comes to the execution. When I saw those women in manacles, with one guard called down the pier and the other napping, I took my chance and liberated the key from their captor’s pocket. Never mind that there were perhaps two hundred yards of docks before those women could even hope to reach safety, or that the whole expanse was well-lit and with little enough cover where they could hide. You may applaud the impulse, but the probable efficacy of this little plan surely left much to be desired.
"It is most outlandish," I said, remembering the portion Holmes referenced. Mrs. Peace, the very same who had been laid out in Sneed’s morgue, according to the official accounts, had turned up at the theater. Opening the letter, I read its contents quickly. "Ms. Smythe confirms she received Mrs. Peace’s ticket -- it is well documented in her ledger -- and that the old lady sat quietly, not unlike the other guests in attendance, until Mr. Dickens at last reached the appearance of Marley’s ghost in Scrooge’s door-knocker. Then she let out ‘
"There. Are. No. Ghosts," Holmes said, punctuating each word with his fist against the wall. He rubbed peevishly at his temple; I would have to have Mrs. Hudson brew him some ginger-root tea, lest he reach for stronger medicines. "No spirits wandering the streets of Cardiff so they might see the great author. No, Watson: she was declared dead some six hours prior. No breath, no pulse, no movement in her eyes to suggest she was at all aware of those around her. I have her certificate of death from the police. If this case’s resolution lies beyond the established laws of nature, then how I’m to manage it, I’m quite unsure."
In the weeks that followed I thought back on that glimpse, recognizing the splotches indicative of a tanning process common in the Aberdeen of my youth but that hadn’t been fashionable for some decades, at least in London. An older wallet, then, but showing none of the normal signs of wear. Feasible: by Mrs. Hudson’s own account an innkeeper had sold it to a pawn-broker, and it could well have spent years in a box of abandoned property before at last it was sold. It told me little enough about the wallet’s contents, but I liked to believe Holmes would approve of the way I’d put his methods to work.
Mercy is most often called for, and a recognition of how little we understand our fellows’ circumstances.
I had hoped to share in the mystery of Holmes’s anticipated parcel. After tea, or after dinner perhaps. At a glance I could see it was a leather wallet of the sort couriers used to protect documents from the weather, thick enough for perhaps twenty sheets folded thrice; perhaps less. But that revealed nothing of their contents, and I could guess no more until Holmes chose to reveal it.
“My magpie,” he said fondly. Watson released my thigh, wrapping his now-free arm around my waist. Anchoring me. “Will you go on?” he said after a moment’s silence.
, but he was noticeably absent from his scheduled encore recitation the following evening. He’d left town on a midnight train, with no notice or explanation, and was next seen a week later in Gads Hill. Something unnerved him, certainly." Holmes shrugged at that. He never shrugged, rarely left his meaning to so imprecise an instrument. "I see no reason to disbelieve his account."
"Yes, yes," she answered, "though how you knew -- " Holmes fixed her with an accusatory gaze, or what would have passed as such between two people less well acquainted. After fourteen years with him as her lodger, she could hardly claim such surprise. A change in tack, then. "And how you can spot it so deep in my pocket, yet still not notice the sun’s passage across the sky and
"But Sneed’s! I extracted proteins from some samples of his hair they sent down, and they too were unremarkable, but his blood, Watson, his blood! It failed my blood-tests entirely, had none of the normal proteins that might differentiate, say, human from bovine blood,, and when I rehydrated it, introduced a reactive agent to break the compounds into their constitutive parts and ran it through my centrifuge, a strange precipitate fell out. It was of a similar weight to antimony, but with none of the usual properties. I have never seen anything of the kind, organic or otherwise, and his blood was rich with it. It was thoroughly bonded with his hemoglobin; a more poetic man might call it a part of him."
One day they brought me a metal gear, badly rusted and corroded but not so ruined I could not work out its original design. They asked for my help, and as van Dijk had given me frustratingly little to work with, I put off my planned errand in favor of helping them repair it. We traced out its shape and I taught them something of geometry, and together we fashioned a pair of makeshift compasses using twigs and twine so we could map out the proper dimensions of the gear before it had been most damaged. At the boys’ insistence I went with them to their blacksmith and we devised a gear of the right diameter, width, and shape that I thought stood a fair chance of functioning in place of the damaged component.
We did extend our holiday, spending Holmes’s birthday with his brother at Caradon Hill. For two men with such a history and who had not spoken in so long, they struck me as souls with a natural kinship -- as brothers might. Mycroft was unable to join us, but I live in hope of future reunions, and the chance that I might be included. And while Holmes remembers little enough of his brother before he went to war, Sherrinford of course had a full stock of stories about Holmes’s earliest days. Never have I known a man to blush so deeply!
"I do not like not knowing," Holmes said after a moment’s silence. His tone was quiet; apologetic, almost, but still determined. "And there are things in need of explanation beyond just the queer yet oddly consistent testimonies. I ran my tests on those tissue samples sent down by the Cardiff police, as you know. I did not want to mention my findings until their own forensic scientists verified them; now I know that they have. You remember the hematology test I had just devised, that first afternoon when Stanford introduced us in the labs at St. Bart’s all those years ago? I subjected the sample from Gwynneth Davies to my tests, with the expected results. There was blood enough, even after all so much time had passed.
"First you will forget the mystery for the next hour," I said. "We will go out and have our tea, and fortify ourselves against the cold weather. And then you will ask Master Haynes your questions. There are other people we might talk to as well. Our Mister Lewis’s uncle, and his friends, if they can still be found. And we should ask Liza Smythe if she remembers anyone else who served on the organizing committee with her mother -- they might tell us more about Mrs. Peace. We can run other tests on your tissues, too, see if we can learn more about this mysterious gas."
If Holmes’s body had spoken of resistance before, now he sat as a sentry on guard. But I have never wanted for courage in these situations, though perhaps more often with Holmes than with any other man, where the stakes are so high. "Holmes," I began. "Sherlock. You should know -- I have made my own investigations. What do you know about Sherrinford’s travel abroad?"
to serve. Eldest son of a country squire -- he could have had the best education, the best of opportunities, just for the asking. Yet he went away, and then he came back like
– I only meant you seemed intent on proving the priests wrong and making room for us in that old rite. Melting into me, and I into you, until there could be no more distinction but only
The adventure began one quiet enough evening in early October, 1899. I sat at my desk, engrossed in a half-finished letter to my nephew Peter; Holmes was sitting at the table where we ate our meals, surrounded by his scrapbook-pages, his pot of glue, and piles of newspaper-clippings which I’m sure made sense to him, if him alone, laid out on every available surface.
"Murder, yes. Perhaps. A near forty-year-old murder, three of them in fact, if it’s more than a simple accident. The parties involved are likely dead themselves or scattered to the wind; but for my own peace, I would know the truth. And for the sake of bringing peace to the sister of the natural suspect, who seemed most eager to clear her brother’s name."
You did not ask for it, but I will take my chance and offer one more judgment, as an author. Reading this account, it was evident you had struggled to pull the words up from within yourself and commit them to paper. I have seen dentists extract teeth with more ease! Do not take this as a critique of your writerly skill, but rather as praise of the courage you showed in the writing, and now in the sharing. I remember how exposed I felt, sick and in distant lands, yet in that moment you dug deep within yourself and chronicled what you found there. I once likened your mind to a delicate instrument, as you remember, but the man who returned to me is something more. The well-honed lens is still a part of you, but so is the man who gives full credit to our more emotional selves.
If I'd dreamed only of Death in the general sense, that would have hardly been surprising given my circumstances, but as I grew, my capricious mind instead insisted on devising dreams where I was the one struggling for my last breath. I dreamed of a harsh white sun above and desert sands beneath, glinting all around as I grasped at my shoulder and my blood dyed the sand nearest to me a deep red. I didn't think to say anything of it the next morning, for it was hardly the first time I'd dreamed of that particular demise. But the next night, I found myself ensconced in thread-bare velvets and surrounded by specimen bottles and artefacts that would tempt any archivist into envy, my trouser-leg gone wet with blood; and then the night after that, as if to complete the set, dreamed of standing among shattered glass with the cloying smell of rich flowers making my head spin as I gasped for breath against a throat grown tight, a cold east wind chilling me to the bone.
To his credit he did not give voice to those deductions. Instead, he turned to extinguish the candle before once more settling beside me. “Perhaps, Holmes; perhaps.”
well together. He sees to things at home. He kept me in tuition and tobacco when I was younger, enabling me to prolong my studies in a way I never would have had I needed to pay my own fees, until I was the curious man you found me on our first meeting." Another stab at word-play, a shiny distraction to pull me from the present course, but I let it pass.
"You scared him," I said, willfully putting off comment on Holmes’s other claims. I will admit it: I derive more pleasure than perhaps I should from pushing him to irritation (in small quantities, at least). But then I have never claimed to be a good man.
I threw up my hands in despair. "Then you had best get used to it! I will grant you, there are some puzzles worth unravelling, but not at the cost of our lives.
Those dreams came to me now and again from that point on, always in threes and never tied to any event in my waking life that I could point to. I was hardly such a fool to think they might predict some dark future, but still I wondered: was it truly normal, to dream oneself into the grave so often?
. Mycroft’s intelligence came together more quickly than either of us had dared hope, and I went to Budapest, confirmed our suspicions, and then did what needed doing in Odessa. At the time I found it exhilarating, though there was little to excite the intellect in that particular chapter, and the work required more blunt force than I often employ. Now, though, I find I have quite lost my taste for those events. Suffice it to say the web’s strands have been severed one from the other, I hope for good, and Ivanov’s associates now pose no further risk to us.
“There was an old fish-pond back behind the house. I liked to watch them, and the hawk-moths, you know, they favored the jasmine-bushes we had planted near it. Hawk-moths fascinated – fascinate – me, their social structure can be nearly as intricate as bees. And the anatomy of their wings: they simply should not be able to beat so quickly. And the sturgeons and the minnows, sometimes they would pause in their swimming and look up at me.” I knew I was obfuscating, unintentionally perhaps but even so. My childhood had been a lonely one, and I did not enjoy letting others see the child I’d been – even Watson. Especially him, perhaps. But best to get on with it. “I could lay there for hours on end, under the bushes’ shade, and lose myself in their company.”
“You will recall those two hours seventeen minutes we spent in near-total silence in the abandoned factory outside Brockham – “
Six months to the day after Harry began his apprenticeship I found myself on a train to London, all my worldly belongings packed into trunks, to live with an aunt I'd never met and begin my medical studies in earnest. I'd come to London to study, and study I did, entering the university that fall. I was quite lucky, I reminded myself; I was hardly a street Arab, and a house full of cousins wasn't quite as hateful as I would have imagined it. Even so, a part of me ached for Scotland, and in those days after I took my commission with her majesty's army my thoughts often turned to the hills around Aberdeen.
I looked upon a tool of destruction and marveled at it, and nearly helped small children bring down that destruction on themselves. Now I must lie abed while my leg heals and see those same children run about day after day. God grant me the strength.
odd! We use one of a similar style for our post. Sell them to the guests, too, when they ask for them. You should ask Master Haynes to be certain, but Mr. Dickens may have bought that off us. Odd, that he’d go to such trouble and still leave his writings behind and not send for them after."
Holmes looked up at that. "Ah. Her mother helped organize the Dickens reading, and she was on hand collecting tickets. She is the closest I have found to a witness for that part of Mr. Dickens’s account."
Holmes opened his mouth again, as if to say something more, but then he closed it without further comment. "We were in Cornwall two years ago," I prodded him. "The Cornish Horror." Still Holmes walked in silence, his attention singularly focused on a goldfinch perched in a cypress-branch some small distance off. "You never mentioned that you had a brother."
Those words were so similar to ones Holmes had spoken two years ago, in Cornwall. They were etched in my brain, as unalterable as ink on parchment. So much of that case had proved unforgettable to me, it was all so ghastly, ghoulish even. But Holmes seemed comparatively unaffected by it once we returned to London; or else he hid its effects from me quite expertly. I wondered: was he quoting himself intentionally, or had the episode simply weighed so heavily on his brain of late, those old words came back to him of their own volition.
The blond-haired boy was laughing, but he still seemed ill at ease, positioning himself between me and the other children. Salvator was laughing, too, and of a sudden there was a pistol in his hand, its bright steel gleaming in the lamplight. Then there was a loud pop, and Kofi lay still at my feet, and the cave’s floor had grown tacky with his blood and when I tried to lift my foot I felt myself grow ill at the way the boot clung to the ground and finally let go with a squelch that echoed through the cave. Then there was another pop, so quick after the first, and Ajua lay there beside Kofi, this time crowned less with blood than brain-matter. And then a third, not even a second later, and this time I could not bear to look, instead retching out my stomach’s contents into the awful mix.
, to be precise. They are preferentially nocturnal but not exclusively so – one of the most intriguing species I've yet to study."
It was not so surprising, then, when I felt the bullet shatter my clavicle, the harsh white sun above and the desert sands beneath, nor even when I fell ill again at Peshawar. I promised myself, then, that if I made it through and back to London I would get myself to Aberdeen as soon as I could. And I did just that, after I was settled in with Holmes and both my body and purse had recovered enough to make the trip. Once I had made it back to the house I'd grown up in, though, sitting across the table from my father and his new wife, I knew that while they may still be blood, I would never be more than a visitor there. That honor was reserved for a humble suite of rooms on Baker Street.
There was a sea-captain in Takoradi, a man of Dutch descent named van Dijk. His family’s fortune was made in the slave-trade. Though that business has grown less lucrative in recent years, this latest scion still peddles in human souls when he can find no more valuable cargo. The women unfortunate enough to fall under his control are now destined for a more carnal servitude, in the ports around the Mediterranean, and in recent years he has expanded his reach even to the Black Sea. Some elements of his business suggested a connection to our old friend the Professor, but after close observation I have determined he is but a garden-variety fiend. To my shame it was this possible connection and not the personal injustices he was well known for that drew my attention.
, and I always thought that enough. I did not know him well -- he went abroad for a while when I was quite young, and when he came back …. well, he was not fit for Bedlam, but he was in a sorry state, that much even I could see. He would sit for hours, in near total stillness, only to break it with these sudden bursts of energy. Mycroft was a year away from university, and he was locked away in his room with his studies, most days. There was a concern, too, that Sherrinford would be less …. restrained than he was around me. My parents thought it would do him good, to have reason to hold himself in check. I don’t doubt they thought I’d be safe, and that I’d give our poor harried mother some respite while I sat with him. But even so."
"We Watsons were not destitute," I said, smiling gently. "And Scotland is not utterly bereft of universities. I could have made my way as a medical man, not so easily perhaps, but at less risk to my person than my chosen route offered. But what can I say? Men join up for all sorts of reasons, and sometimes it is just not logical. And whatever brought them into the service, however they got there, some see things that work their way into the blood as thoroughly as your foreign infiltrate. It is not always predictable, or controllable, and certainly not an easy topic of conversation for men who did not pass through the same crucible."
“As for the algae,” I continued, “when I at last confessed the cause of my injury and told Mother about the new strain, she chided me, and told me as she redressed the wound with antiseptic how we were getting a new fish the next week. A koi-carp; it thrived on different vegetation. So there was no mystery after all: simply my overactive imagination and the boredom of an autumn's day.” I frowned. “They never did invite me to join them. Mycroft, or Father. Mycroft didn’t poke fun, which I suppose was nice in his way, but he didn’t invite me in either.”
By Jove, though! What I would give for a gulp of water, cool or hot; or a steadying hand at my shoulder.
I'd balanced my weight, then, and gritted my teeth against the pain in a way I hoped wasn't too noticeable (yes, in those days I still harbored fantasies of deceiving Holmes, on occasion) and bided my time until Holmes could help me back to a chair. He looked at me with his eyes shining brightly, swallowing hard against a lump in his throat. Was my old friend afraid? That was an impossibility, but even so, the words came tumbling past my lips before I could stop them: I was fine, it was but a scratch. And then he cut away the cloth and ran his fingers along my bare thigh in a touch that was both probing and intimate. I turned away, hoping against hope that my grimace hid the blush coloring my face. He stood up, turned to face my assailant, and left me to my thoughts. The worry on Holmes's face, the relief on seeing I wasn't so badly harmed as I might have been: those glimpses into the true depths of his affection were hard to forget, and by Jove I was not overly inclined to try.
You will remember the homeless children who sometimes offered their services to us at Baker Street. You must have thought it purely a utilitarian relationship: they needed coin to buy food and shelter, and I needed eyes, ears, and hands that could pass much more unnoticed in areas of London than I would have been. But I have always had something of an affinity for children at that age. Their minds are so malleable, and particularly primed to understand how the world works. They were necessary, and useful, but also a rare pleasure.
Holmes, doing his best impression of a fainting heroine from a penny novel, threw himself back into the couch cushions, letting the letter drop to the floor.
One spring day, as I sat writing a letter to my cousin Erin, the sound of breaking glass rang out against the morning's silence. I grumbled about the idleness of youth and took up my cane – more a tool for chasing our young vandals off than a support against the leg that had never quite recovered after the war, I told myself – and made my way out into the gardens. "Watson!" a voice gasped as soon as I came in sight of the greenhouse. Holmes stood hunched over against a table, massaging his throat and clearly struggling to breathe. My cane dropped to the garden path, clattered against the paving-stones, and I sprinted to the greenhouse like a man half my age.
To his credit, Watson did let me proceed at my own pace. He simply held me, his grasp and his breath and the warmth of his body a steadying presence. I turned myself in his arms so I faced him, could read his expression for any clues to a negative reaction, but I found only curiosity, and patience.
I nodded our agreement and thanks, and moved the tea-service to its more proper home on the now half-straightened table. Holmes, never one to leave a boundary untested or a last nerve untrodden, thought fit to issue her out in song:
Now that was a feature of interest, as one says, but it hardly explained his interest. If anything it raised more questions. "And you put your faith in the account of a novelist?"
Quite the contrary: whether the it was talk of marriage or of family generally, Holmes had grown distant, and when he came back to me he pressed his lips together tightly, as if guarding against some words that might slip past. Later, when we sat in our chairs after dinner, pipes in hand, he kept putting me off, dancing from one idle topic of conversation to another. The upcoming trial of the albino cobbler (how the barristers had mangled his pretty evidence!); or whether we could hope to obtain tickets when Balakirev played at the Royal Philharmonic (unlikely, barring a grateful client with sufficient connections). The papers remained untouched and uncommented-upon.
, the – my breath caught at the intimacy, no longer charged with erotic intent but still a possession of all that was vulnerable in me – the
"It could have been the gas," I said, though even as I said it I knew I was grasping at straws. "Headaches, nerve damage, brachial trauma -- who is to say it might not have other queer effects?"
"Good man," Holmes said. He offered me a wry grin. "Are you sure I cannot tempt you into starting our journey early? If our clerk with the vampire-milkman is any indication, I could be persuaded to leave London tonight."
The next ten days were crammed full of festivities both professional and social for Holmes and myself, and Christmas drinks (twice rescheduled) with Holmes’s brother Mycroft that somehow fit neatly into both categories. Holmes himself begged pardon on that occasion, claiming a winter’s cold that was much improved by the next morning. Finally we were free -- to be locked in a small train compartment with a three-hundred-pound accounts clerk with a truly appalling case of halitosis. That night, though, saw us ensconced in our rooms in Cardiff.
"I’ll leave you gentlemen to it," Mrs. Hudson said. Then, leaning in closer, as conspirators might: "Abigail’s minding the bread alone, and she’s as like to burn it as not, poor dear. Dinner at seven?"
Tonight, though, that boredom is the least of my problems. For tonight I dreamt again of Kandahar, and of Maiwand, and of the Archduke Salvator. I have never laid eyes on any of them, but I know it as surely as I know the sun will rise in the east tomorrow morning. How strange! I cannot explain my certainty but simply knew that I knew. Much as I knew the girl with the bright shining eyes was Ajua, and the boy with the scar across his cheek was her brother Kofi (he was the one who found me when I fell, did I say?). They were Pashtun in their dress and their coloring and their speech and bearing, but they were Ajua and Kofi all the same. There was a third boy, too, older but not old enough. He was fair-skinned and blond-haired, and with an easy laugh I could not help but recognize as your own. I did not know you at that age, of course, but there could be no mistaking him.
“You are a menace, Holmes, and a scoundrel,” he said, “and clearly think more of my virulence than I would speak to with any confidence. But
For you, though, I will chance judgment just this once. As a soldier, it seems to me you are not quite fair to yourself. You killed no one in Takoradi, certainly no children, and if that came down to luck, well, when does it not? I would remind you, too, as one who trained as a doctor and then went willingly to war, I have been called to use weapons against others in defense of my fellows. Some were little more than children; yet you have called me a war-hero. Consider how your standard would judge me, and if you cannot easily accept its conclusion, perhaps be more generous with yourself.
"All three saw a doctor, of course, and he said there must have been some sort of gas in the air. But you are both men of science. Have you ever heard of such a thing? That three men in such close proximity might be so differently affected, with no one showing any sign of the other men’s maladies? And their watches mis-set like that without the gears being damaged, or the cases or chains come to that?"
Salvator stood behind me, and above, turning the gun in his hand and marveling at it. “Isn’t it a clever thing,” he said. “Note the cunning mechanics – one must only fire a bullet and a new one is loaded, nearly instantaneous! Truly there is little limit to what the well-governed mind can achieve.”
(I fully admit I no longer have full right to that endearment. You have plighted your troth, and while I would not deny you your chance at that happy life, just now I find I am in desperate need. Let me be yours once more, if only in my mind. He must needs go that the devil drives.)
"Master Haynes said he found it some few months ago, wedged between the back of his old desk and the wall." He pointed to a sharp crease in the leather. "See how the case was shoved flat for so long. The old desk is a great oak monstrosity, and there was hardly any cause to move it, to clean the wall behind, until he bought him a new piece -- smaller, to accommodate the second file drawer, you see -- this last June. I don’t believe he held it back on purpose, if that’s your thought."
Beside me, slouched low in her chair beside my bed, I see Ajua is sleeping. Those images had seemed so true, but she is only asleep. Her chest rises and falls in shallow breaths, and almost imperceptibly over the breeze outside the window, I can just make out her snores. It was only a dream, I’m sure you would remind me. Ajua and doubtless Kofi are alive, as are you.
“Woman.” Ah! So I could still surprise him. “Or girl. Josie was our stable-master’s daughter, sixteen at the time, and a master of all things horticultural. Or a mistress, I suppose.”
With all that, perhaps it’s no great surprise that I often found myself subject to other children’s interrogations on any number of issues. No, not just subjected; I sought it out. I made my journeys into Takoradi, of course, as it was my
It has been a year and more since we last parted company in Switzerland. There; that is a polite enough way to put it, if I am to play again at refinement? Though of course I desire no such thing. My present hosts offer what comforts they can, but my head aches and my leg aches and my very pulse seems to throb under my skin; and as for conversation and reflection, just now the present reality both begs not to be examined too closely and yet somehow demands it.
"The account -- our best source of information here, aside from the official reports which make Scotland Yard’s seem positively helpful -- is from the famous Charles Dickens."
“Well, perhaps not in so many words,” I said. “But the sentiment, certainly. I didn’t want to cause trouble, of course, but the prospect of knowing, the thrill of the chase….”
." I did not say: I thought you would have learned this lesson in Cornwall, that my near death would have had a longer-lasting impact even if you cared not about your own.
The silence returned, this time much less intentional. We’d long since passed our goldfinch but still Holmes stared down the path, unseeing. "Mycroft is seven years your senior," I said at last, "and Sherrinford …."
“You were a budding chemist at the age of four?” Watson asked. I felt the curl of his lips against my skin and found I was smiling, too.
Holmes, his patience evidently worn thin, leaned forward and steepled his long, precise fingers under his chin. "Mr. Augustus Hudson, the pawn-broker, directed us to you and not to your master. Why might that be?"
I mustered as warm a smile as I could manage. "Mr. Lewis. You clearly know something of Mr. Holmes." He nodded, threatening to bite his lip plain through. "You have read my stories?"
“And the illicit allure of a shiny laboratory. You never have suffered from an overabundance of patience, love.”
"That implies a change in its basic state," I said. Holding out the envelope Mrs. Hudson had entrusted to me, I added, "Post for you. A Mrs. Smythe of Cardiff."
"And yet you let it rest until you guessed they were in true danger," I answered. "What have you found?"
The tale thus far must make me seem half hero and half madman. Never you fear; I am not so easily driven to nightmares of the sort I described by a simple misstep on a dark night. There is yet more to tell, and I am willing to tell it. But just now I am quite tired for all that it is just mid-morning. It seems, if I am yet spared Pluto’s tender mercies, at least Morpheus must lay claim to me for a few hours. More anon.
Those familiar with my adventures with Sherlock Holmes will already know the bare skeleton of my experiences in Afghanistan, how I came to be attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers and to play my part in the second Afghan war. What I did not record in those pages was the chill that settled upon me when I was rerouted from India to Afghanistan and the fear that gripped me when I remembered my dreams of a desert death. My grandmother had taken some comfort in my dreams because, if there was any truth in them at all, I was hardly likely to come across the strange places my dreams had been set, at least in my waking-life. When I'd signed on with the army it had been for service in India, and when I learned I was desert-bound I'd promised myself I'd discharge my duties as best I could, though I had no great faith I'd survive the full tour.
“That particular opportunity never arose on the streets of Aberdeen,” he answered drily, though from my improved position I could see the good humor in his eyes.
That said, the first time I'd set foot in Nathan Garrideb's rooms off Ryder Street, I was taken aback, so similar was it to the parlor from my dreams. I said nothing of my fears to Holmes, even once he'd found out the other Garrideb's true identity, and I followed him the next day back into that house with as much courage as I could manage. If this was to be my final end, I told myself, I'd had a good run of it; and in any event I still had one more death-dream to fulfil. So I wasn't wholly surprised to feel the burn of the bullet working its way through my thigh, nor the realization (instinctual by that point but also well-supported by professional knowledge) that his bullet had missed the bone and the major blood vessels, that the leg seemed too much under my control to be suffering from nerve damage, and that – though the pierced muscles burned with a fire I had not felt since Candahar – it was what I had described to many a soldier as a flesh wound. A graze. Not dangerous.
"You wish to speak with Augie. Mrs. Hudson’s Augie; or his innkeeper-customer, perhaps." I smiled, wolf-like. "You found something in those papers. And they thought it would distract you in the absence of contemporary puzzles. What puzzle could possibly intrigue Sherlock Holmes? There is something -- criminal, in those papers, is there not?"
I am reminded particularly of an hour I spent with Agnes in Mrs. Hudson’s kitchens, one rainy Thursday afternoon, when our landlady taught us both how to defeather a goose with the least violence to the meat below. It was a necessary skill if Agnes was to gain employment in a certain butcher’s work-room, and so overhear the gossip that passed between his workers. But what I most remember were her questions. Why did the feathers curve just so, was it perhaps some aid in flight; why did they maintain their stores of fat rather than burning it as they consumed it; would a pointed beak not be a more potent weapon when they hunted for their dinner; and on and on and on. I didn’t know half the answers, nor was I inclined to invest my own time to find out for her, but the questions! The way she saw details and wondered at their cause, and could their arrangement not be improved in some way. I may have to seek her out when I make it back to London and find answers for at least some of her questions. It was quite soothing, sitting around that table and hearing her ask them.
"When one trains a horse," he stated calmly, pressing the end of the crop lightly into my chest, "one uses a crop for the occasional rap or smack to get the animal's attention, or to stop bad habits from developing.  No half-decent handler would simply lash away at an animal in his care, or use a crop to inflict damage."
Holmes knelt beside me and deftly swirled one of the napkins around the base of my member, tucking the other into his collar.  I realised then what he had in mind: I was to be consumed for his pleasure as he might have done a cigar or cognac.  He reached out with the crop and tapped me under the chin with it.  "You do not climax.  Not until after I am finished."  With that he bent over me and eagerly swallowed down my entire length.
I left him to brood in silence during the carriage ride home.  Knowing he prefers silence and solitude for intense concentration, I excused myself as soon as we arrived back at our rooms and went out to my club for the rest of the day.
Sherlock sits on his haunches by the coffee table, takes some of Rosie’s dilapidated cake slice’s frosting and paints it across the bridge of his nose.
John gives Sherlock a chummy slap on the arm, squeezes his bicep. His smile is brilliant, and he lets out a little disbelieving laugh.
Sherlock nods, the sensation of John filling him rendering him incapable of speech. It’s rare for Sherlock to let go like this, to become an unspeaking, unthinking thing--but the quieting of his typically overworked mind is pure bliss.
It’s not just a physical attraction. It's the haunting regrets and earth-shattering grief he’d felt when Sherlock died, how his thoughts and dreams always manifest a Sherlock-shaped phantasm, the rare feeling of being
It hadn’t been asked with a tone of judgment; it’d been one of sincere curiosity. The question had surprised Sherlock, but perhaps that’s because no one had ever got close enough to ask it, and he’d been even more surprised by how naturally he’d come to an answer. Systematic study was absolutely crucial, he’d told John, but it wasn’t only what madeth the man; genetics came into play, particularly from his matrilineal line. There is no question that the art that runs through Sherlock’s veins has contributed to his creativity of reasoning and thought.
After catching their breaths, unsticking themselves from a messy tangle of limbs and effluvia, John gives them both a perfunctory wipe-down with a flannel, saying, in wonder, "That was somehow even better than last night, and last night was incredible. Wasn’t sure it could be topped.”
John jerks a nod to his left. Sherlock takes the seat, crosses one leg over the other, and casually drapes his arm along the back of the sofa. Much to Sherlock’s satisfaction, John leans back into his arm. They almost never exist in close proximity like this, they’ve never allowed themselves to, but being here now feels like home. It feels right--at least for Sherlock.
“Sorry, but what’s the bloody point of the mistletoe?” Lestrade complains. “Someone’s got to actually get bloody well snogged beneath it.”
John carefully removes Sherlock’s sunglasses, leans away to place it out of reach, then eases back into form at Sherlock’s side. He places a hand atop a damp splotch on Sherlock’s chest.
Sherlock eyes him warily. “He was a pioneer in the area of modern forensic analysis. The Exchange Principle.”
The referee blows the whistle on a foul and an argument ensues, DC Conzatti gesticulating at DC Faisal like the angry Italian he very much is.
Sherlock looks across the room and is met with three red-faced, glassy-eyed men staring back at him with undisguised contempt. It’s impossible for them to know what’s going on underneath the table, but perhaps he and John are not being too discreet, generally.
John furrows his brows, but he nods once in mute encouragement, so Sherlock wraps a hand around John’s and guides the rim of the glass to his lips, tips his head back, tasting light malt and notes of honey.
John leans into Sherlock's side, pressing them together hip to hip, and stretches out his leg-with-the-bad-foot. It's good to be sitting down.
John thrusts lazily into the ring of Sherlock’s fist, his cock growing fully plump in Sherlock’s hand, before he rolls onto his back, Sherlock wasting no time to follow, draping himself inartfully over John’s torso and burying his face into John’s neck, deciding he will stay there for as long as he is allowed.
John stops in his tracks and whirls around, more than a little offended. An unamused, hulking man is bounding in his direction. John wants to show the fucker that
Perhaps old habits die hard. And perhaps there is an uncertainty that keeps knocking him off his feet; Sherlock is a puzzle (but he wouldn’t be anything else, would he?) and John can’t say for certain what Sherlock wants from him. He’s
“Sure,” Wiggins says. “And get me a couple of those bacon-wrapped whatsits.” With spectacular restraint, John wordlessly snatches up Wiggins’s glass and heads back toward the kitchen, but he doesn’t make it there, stopped in his tracks by a hollered, “One more thing, Doc!”
"And I should be humbled to accept any and all of what you offer me," he said, somewhat strained with emotion.
been a remarkable prison escape and is suitably seasonal--so Sherlock tunes it out. Instead, he thinks fondly back to a biography he’d read on Joseph Lister around Christmastime in 2008, wonders at how it’d feel to plunge his bare hands into a corpse’s chest cavity (
“Sorry to ruin this heartwarming exchange. But.” Sherlock has the wild thought of shoving Wiggins away and pulling in John to stand in Wiggins’s stead. “I just wanted to....”
Holmes held the door open for me, smiling, beatific and welcoming, and I was compelled to return a smile of similar calibre. I walked inside into the space that was now partly mine, that I was to share with my greatest and dearest companion Holmes, with no plan to diverge from the arrangement any time in the near future or, perhaps, ever, and dropped the luggage to the ground with a loud bang.
I realised, then, why I had not asked for Mary’s hand in marriage. Or why I had not attempted to court the fairer sex since I met Holmes. More basically, I realised why, in all the years stretching back to my youth, my eyes occasionally strayed to appraise the male physique and craved a man’s carnal touch (a clinical fascination, I had reasoned with myself, nothing more; I dared not give voice to any other possibility).
“Sorry, did I ask for your opinion?” John says, all ice, and Molly looks scandalised by the lancing comment.
Before John can finish his question, Sherlock slips his mouth over John’s cock, wrapping a fist around John’s shaft and working hand and mouth in tandem.
On cue, Mummy knocks on the door and pushes it open without waiting for a whiff of assent, and Sherlock rockets upright, nearly falling off the bed. He’s saved only by John’s quick reflexes, a secure arm curled over his waist. Their faces end up dangerously close, John’s expression fraught with alarm, and the almost possessive nature of John’s firm hold compounded with the proximity of John’s lips cause Sherlock’s cock to (inopportunely, inappropriately) stir with interest.
The change of scenery brightens Sherlock’s mood as well, and he chatters at John about Renaissance motets, playing a personal favourite of his on his mobile to demonstrate the genre’s artistry. John is attentive and curious, but misses the subtle complexities of the piece entirely.
“No, it’s—that was—Jesus.” John scrubs a hand over his eyes, making them more pinkened and raw. “And you’re always on about
"A look?" Sherlock says, watching a waiter weave through tables with a trayful of fruit-flavoured soju bottles. "What look?"
Sherlock takes the few steps toward John, bringing with him a fragrant breeze of poncy, lavender bath product and sweat, and ducks his head by John’s ear. “Bach,” he says with the proper harsh fricative, letting out a puff of hot breath. “Partita in A minor.”
"I am trying to understand something," he said placidly. I pressed the palm of my hand to forehead and looked away, embarrassed to face Holmes dead on. He was going to tell me he could not fathom my actions, was going to ask me leave in the instant and return to London, I was certain of it, until he spoke again. "I am trying to understand why, precisely, you stopped."
Sherlock leans over, and John’s body tenses as Sherlock says in his ear, “Mummy thinks we’re rowing.”
“Oh!” Sherlock says, practically making a running dive onto the bed, sliding into position on his side beside John.
Sherlock looks down to find that his dressing gown belt has come loose in the collision, John having tugged it out of its knot, giving everyone an eyeful of the bulge in his pants (made even more obvious by an off-centre dampened spot). His face flaring with heat, he makes a quick work of re-tying the belt, pulling it so taut that the band digs into his stomach.
But these were lofty, childish romantic ideals that had been anything but ideal when expended on Victor Trevor.
Looking up at John from beneath his lashes, he finds John gawping at him, his saliva-sheened fingers still pinched and poised ridiculously in the air. He hadn’t expected it.
But he’s in case mode. Focused. On the hunt. Ready to strike, ready to filch Starr’s wallet from her back pocket. The entire case hinges on that wallet, the final evidence they need to ensure her arrest, and John is providing the distraction Sherlock needs to snatch it.
“No pointing, that’s rude,” John says, lowering her pointing finger and taking her hand. “Sorry. Hafiz, this is my daughter, Rosie. Say hello to Daddy’s friend, Ro.”
” John says as he snakes a hand between them to palm at Sherlock’s cock in his trousers, giving it a squeeze, much like Sherlock had just done to him in the pub. Tipping his head back against the wall, Sherlock presses himself into John’s hand, arching his back.
“You need to tell her because she certainly won’t tell you. You’ve been miserable since November and have been dreadfully tiresome to be around sometimes, always
Sherlock pulls at his hair and paces. “I’m not Lestrade. I can’t--” He breathes in sharply and spins around to face John. “John. I would be honoured if—damn, no. If you would allow me to—I’d be rather delighted to—
He finds Sherlock waiting by the exit, trying to look casual, but very clearly vibrating with impatience.
“Let us first be on even ground,” I said, turning around and reaching for his shirt. “I have not yet seen any of you.”
When his arms tire out, he lets her go, and she seems re-energised, ready to conquer the world, and pleads with John to join a few boys preparing to race each other down the hill. John allows it, and she runs off.
as what you're thinking, thank you. I had to convince a man I was a woman in order to ensure his arrest; had to send him suggestive photographs. All one needs are the right angles and lighting.” He drags his nails idly over the lip print on John's pectoral, admiring his work, perhaps. As he should. “I’ve not worn them often; I last tried them on three years ago. Perhaps they’ll still fit me.”
--and the car is sufficiently steamy and they are debauched and grotty and half-clothed sitting in their own bodily fluids. None of it should be comfortable (it’s not one bit), but Sherlock doesn’t give a toss, because John is smiling at him like
“Okay,” Lestrade says. He blows out a heavy breath. “It’s something--it’s something that happened with me and John that we never talked about again. A kind of...unspoken understanding of
John takes a pull of his beer (always dramatic), his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s, then places the bottle down on the coffee table. With deliberateness, he raises his eyes toward the ceiling and Sherlock follows his line of sight to the kitchen entryway, where the sprig of mistletoe is conspicuously absent.
“What is it, then?” John says, pressing his hand to the small of Sherlock’s back and peering over his shoulder. “My god,” he says once he has proper sight of the text, “a
Holmes obviously took my lack of objections as permission to continue, since when I failed to protest his action, he pushed my sleeve up with his free hand and his mouth slowly trailed its way to the inside of my elbow.
He rose from his chair and strolled over to me, examining me as if I was indeed a horse he was thinking of hiring.  His hands slid down the long muscles in my back, then came to rest on my hips while he slowly and thoroughly kissed the back of my neck.  I have no idea how he had deduced that it was one of my favourite spots to be touched, but I was not surprised that he had.
He groaned and turned to lean his forehead against the wall.  "Watson.  I hereby take back everything, everything!, I have ever said slighting your imagination and ingenuity.  I had thought you could not make things any worse, but you have."
It was a week later that we were invited to dinner at Mycroft's estate outside of London.  Mycroft Holmes rarely stirred from the city, but when he did, it was to one of the most private places in England.  Holmes assured me that his brother's staff were notably efficient and discreet.  Given the sensitive position Mycroft held within the British Government, I could only agree with him.
"Wait!"  And we were frozen in position once more, and I fought against the restraint placed upon me.  "He might accept your desires out of simple lust.  You are an attractive man; I shall take that advantage from you.  If he responds, it must be in spite of your looks, not because of them."
"Simple.  You are all in a hurry to send your telegram.  I think no hurry is necessary.  I want you to inquire at the office when it is likely to actually go out.  If they agree to send it straight away, you are right, and I lose.  But if it does not go before, say, twelve o'clock, I am right, and you lose."
"Indeed.  More than content, in fact.  The Government is extremely pleased, and I, well, I was extremely pleased."
It stung rather than hurt, less of a blow than I had received on numerous occasions at school.  Holmes placed one finger gently next to it.  "How did that feel?"
"I am well.  Indeed, even better than well."  Holmes passed me one of his own dressing gowns, since none of mine were handy.
My other realisation was exactly how much I cared about him.  I did not just want him as a convenient partner, I wanted
"Yes, I know.  Believe me, I know."  His voice was downright lascivious, and I realised his breathing was a little more rapid.  "But for many men, their nipples are just as sensitive as a woman's.  Try it, rub them with a fingertip, or pinch them, gently."
"Yes, that's good.  Now stretch your arms up, pull it loose a little around the waist.  Shift your hips forward a bit."  His hands reached over the back of the settee to place a cushion behind my back, and to tweak the shirt further open as well.  "Now touch yourself."
It should have made me feel better, but instead I felt insulted, that he would not take my threat seriously.  "So now I'm a liar as well!"  I hissed, and struck out with my right fist at his face.
Of course I have read Watson's account of his hallucinations under the influence of the Devil's Foot Root.  Either he has concealed the truth, or the effects he felt were very different to mine.  He reports vague impressions of darkness and danger; my images were sharp in image and sound, with a precision that shakes my confidence that I always know what is real and what is not.
He continued.  "The warmth of the air at this level melted the ice before she was found.  Since I was in my socks, I did notice a much wetter patch of ground near her body, but was unable to account for it at the time.    Both the jellyfish and reports of other lumps of ice have been confirmed by brother Mycroft's informants, and if he says the reports are trustworthy, then you can be certain they are. You can check with him yourself if you wish, but the answers will be no different.  The case is solved, and the wager is mine."
Holmes looked at me with a baffled expression, as if what I had said was totally unexpected.  "Is that honestly your opinion?"
"I have not had a worthwhile mount for some time," and he smiled very slightly, "but I have high hopes at the moment."  Then he turned away and led me into his bedroom.
, and his hands vanished.  "I did say that the crop is used to prevent bad habits," he said, casually, "and I will not have you jumping away at a simple touch.  Put your hands on your knees."
But in the split second between when I had gained my feet and Holmes had moved away, I had clearly felt his hard maleness press into me and I was glad to have the back of the settee to lean on, to conceal the trembling in my knees.
The muscular tip had all the dexterity one would have expected from Holmes's fingers.  In addition, with no bones or joints, it was able to perform manoeuvres impossible for a human hand, coiling and probing.  I attempted to resist, but the tentacles' grip pulled my legs wide apart and left me completely exposed.
"Are my attentions disturbing you?"  Holmes asked, stopping at about arm's length from me.  He waited for me to answer; Holmes never asks rhetorical questions.
"Do not worry about me."  He dismissed my concern with a flick of the wrist.  "You have given of yourself without receiving anything back on enough occasions before, I will not think you selfish if you take without returning this time.  Surely you would rather retire."
"I have no regrets," I replied.  "Although I would appreciate it if you did not rouse me tomorrow morning, at least until I have had sufficient sleep."  I looked sideways at him as I finished making myself presentable.  "Your requirements are rather strenuous."
"Not at all.  It is merely shock; he could hardly be expecting me to mutate wildly before his eyes."  I had no idea when this had become a contest between myself and the voice I heard, with Watson somehow both the game piece and the prize.  I kept my grasp on his arms, and pulled myself from my chair.
"Really!  Do you think I can just drop this case in its tracks and sit nattering over a cup of tea?"
I suddenly realised that this was one area where no man could claim to be a greater expert than I, and I was free of any chance of criticism or correction.  Holmes could make all the comments or suggestions he wanted, but he could not call me wrong.  The thought of him watching me, bound by his promises, caused a distinct stirring in my groin.
I took one hand and curled it around his sac, squeezing most gently to roll the testes in my palm.  Holmes made a deep sound of pleasure at my touch.  I thought more of what he had done to me, and opened my mouth to take the end of his member completely inside.  Even as the one giving gratification I groaned at the feel of it, warm and solid.  Holmes pressed into my touch, and I took him deeper, caressing him with my tongue.
The next time the conversation paused, I stifled a yawn, and then pretended embarrassment.  "Oh, forgive me.  It's getting late, and I was on the point of going to bed when you arrived.  I'm glad you came in to tell me of your evening, though.  But now I really must take myself off before I fall asleep in my chair."
A terrible scream - a prolonged yell of horror and anguish - burst out of the silence of the moor.  That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins. All that we had said and done was swept aside as we leapt to our feet, peering vainly into the darkness.
I had one final moment of insight that this was the drug's doing, and we could still get out.  But there was nowhere for my hands to find purchase on him, no shoulders or wrists for a solid grip in order to pull us towards the door.  And then the drug clouded my mind and I was no longer aware that the situation was not real.
And stopped.  I have seen - and participated in - more brawls than I can count, and there are only two reactions to such a threat.  A man will either throw up his hands and step back, or bring his own fists into play.  Holmes did neither.  He went completely still, and closed his eyes, for all the world as if he wanted me to strike him.
But I was not.  I felt restless and bad-tempered, with a sort of directionless anger and frustration.  My friends had been good company over dinner, the restaurant service to a gentleman's standards, but afterwards...  The women would have been more than acceptable to me as little as a month ago, but I had come away without leaving the reception room, unable to choose any of them for reasons I was unwilling to admit even to myself.
"A drink first!" cried Holmes, pouring brandy into three tumblers, and passing two of them over.  "A toast to the proper application of logic and truncheons."
"The door is closed, but not locked.  You may leave at any time you wish, and I will not follow you.  You may also say 'no' if I do something you dislike.  Otherwise I will assume you are consenting and I will do as I wish.  Do you understand?"
I opened my mouth eagerly, drawing his fingers in one at a time and sucking them clean, using my lips and tongue as he sighed with pleasure at my ministrations.  I could feel, smell, hear and taste him, and the thought of being denied that fifth sense was driving me mad.
That did it.  I do not think that anything pleases him as much as having someone admit they were wrong and he was right, and here I was offering him the chance to make me say it in any fashion he could dream up.  And if he refused the wager, he was effectively admitting I was right already.
But Victorian London was not India, and I had curtailed my activities to my hand and the occasional speculation.  Even without society watching, my wounding and subsequent illness had for a long time prevented me from feeling much inclination for anything more.
I had used my hand on myself in his presence before; I should have guessed he had taken the chance to study me.  Now he moved exactly as I would have done, without hesitation or awkwardness.  His thumb rubbed over the head at the top of each stroke and his fingers held me firmly in their grip.  Once or twice his grip loosened so that he could brush my sac, but he never released me completely.
I tried to pretend for a while that our encounter had made no difference.  After all, Holmes had only touched me briefly, if intimately, and I had given him only a single kiss.  But when I lay in bed on the following nights, my hands seemed lifeless without his whispered urgings, and even when I climaxed I missed the illicit thrill of knowing his intense stare was fixed on me.
I also saw that he truly needed me.  He could not practice this art without someone to practice it upon; someone to act as both subject and audience for his abilities.
I believe Holmes made it easy for me, stroking in and out, caressing the tight ring of muscle with his lubricated fingers.  I found I was rocking back against his hand, but he stopped me with a touch on my hip, and when I stilled he stroked my back, murmuring in approval.  He was close enough that I could feel the warmth of his body near my bare skin, and the edges of his robe touched me in random places as he moved.
I had little choice, really, kneeling there on the floor with my hands still bound behind me, but I assumed he meant not to move from that position.  He nodded approvingly when he returned, kicking the low brown ottoman into the room and carrying a couple of linen napkins from the dining table.  He placed the ottoman behind me and ordered me to sit upon it, then pulled me backwards by the shoulders until they, and my head, rested on the floor.  My legs stuck out the other way, leaving my hips lifted and my straining member thrusting towards the ceiling.
