Dean turned back into the room, laughing to himself… and stopped, stunned, at the sight of Cas, holding up a sock.
But Ellen, now the head of the AMoL in Bobby’s place, shakes her head. “We can’t, Dean. He’s too high-profile.” She sighs. “I’m going to have to bring the British Men of Letters in on this,” she says, dismissing them as she picks up the phone to place a call to her counterpart in London, Lady Antonia Bevell.
“Poker Tournament?” His eyes lift from the laptop screen to meet Sam’s. They both turn their gaze on Kevin.
“Yeah, Casti… fuck it. Cas. I’m callin’ you ‘Cas’ because ‘Castiel’ is just…” Dean pinches the bridge of his nose.
“Nope, I’m still totally hung up on this guy,” he says softly, lowering his hand and giving it a squeeze, then raising his free hand to stifle a yawn. “But I
Dean was the first to come to his senses, striding from the door to give his brother and Gabe a hug, Cas on his heels and stepping in to do the same when Dean stepped back.
He’s good with it. He really is.
"C'mon. I can wash it off in the surf."
The weight moves off him completely then, reappearing further down, thighs now pressing against Dean’s knees, and he gives a high raspy cry when the warmth of the honey trickles down the length of his cock, dribbling down over his balls to his perineum. Castiel wastes no time, his tongue briefly circling Dean’s rim before sliding up and sucking his balls into his mouth. Dean keens and writhes, his hands twisting in the restraints until Castiel’s hand returns to his hip, fingers squeezing into the flesh, and he stills again, panting and whining. Castiel flattens his tongue against the base of his cock and paints a wide swath up his length, licking up the honey until he reaches the head. Dean feels the precome dribbling down onto his stomach and Castiel’s tongue lapping it up, then keens again as Castiel takes in his cock all the way down to the root.
find out, at least not from him.
Dean laughs but as usual his dick has a mind of its own, twitching at Cas’ husky tone. But he knows his own limits, and
Murky sunlight streams in the bedroom window and Dean wakes up with a grunt, rolling away from the light and covering his eyes with his arm. Distantly, he can hear the dreamcatcher alarms jangling, and while grumbling, pulls the covers over his head.
“Baby, we need to talk.”
But Dean knew exactly who he was the second he saw the dark tousled hair, and those blue, blue eyes, even with the bruise-dark circles under them.
Sam is on his way, having taken the BMoL jet Cas had originally arrived in to Las Vegas to pick up their luggage and the Impala from the casino; he’s driving to meet them. In the meantime, Dean and Cas have decided to make good use of the resort’s nearby beach amenities, soaking up the sun and each other.
He has an idea. Reaching into his pocket, he pulls out his pocket knife and flips open the blade.
“Uh, hey Sammy… what should I feed this guy? He’s gotta be hungry by now…”
Castiel isn’t sure what he expects Dean to do, but it certainly isn’t to slide from the bed and fall to his knees in front of him, sitting back on his heels to look up into his eyes, to grasp both sides of Castiel’s face and force him to meet his gaze.
Dean’s so lost in his fantasy of pole-dancing flight attendants (hey, if it’s good enough for Iron Man and War Machine, it’s good enough for him), he startles at the sound of the ramp stairs rolling up to the parked jet and the hatch opening. But he is
Cas had finally had enough of Gabe’s teasing and had made himself busy in the kitchen, making lunch for himself and Gabe, making sure he was packed for the trip (although he had never unpacked from coming home from his dorm), and other busywork. His mom, along with Bobby and Ellen, had left for the cabin earlier this morning to get everything ready for the rest of the family, with the kids coming up later after Dean arrived.
Cas’ eyes narrowed, as if Sam had gone completely insane.
“Ahhhh... f-fuck… Cassss…” he babbles as Castiel slides up and then back down, starting up a steady rhythm.
“Hey… hey, it’s gonna be ok. What’s your name?”
Dean snorts. “Yeah, he’s got a bit of a stick up his ass, but what do you expect from the Brits?”
Dean swallows and takes a sip of coffee before answering. “Nothing much. I have videos of games some of the more professional players have played in, gonna study those.”
“C’mon, sunshine, time to get up. I’m starving and in desperate need of coffee.”
Castiel squints through the Impala’s windshield at the monolith looming in the distance.
… for Cas.
to build up his strength, just
The rain pounds on the roof of the cabin, and Dean’s heartbeat pounds in time.
“Holy shit,” Dean says, his eyes glancing upwards as he does the calculations in his head. “That’s like…”
— he thinks it is… well, then, he has plenty of ammo in the room.
“It fucking
“So this is part of what you bought - doll dishes?” Sam asked Cas. “What else?”
Eileen reads the message from Donna, her eyes growing wide. “That’s… quite the coincidence,” she says, looking back up at him and sliding his phone back across.
. “I have a poker game to win.” He cups Cas’ face between his palms to pull him in for a deep, hard kiss, as Cas pushes the button to end the call on Sam’s sputtering voice.
In a breath Cas is there, chest pressed against Dean’s and arms wrapped around his neck.
(See the end of the chapter for
Prompt fill for Suptober Day 15 - Third Eye.
Weeks passed with no progress in finding a way to bring Dean back to his human self.
"Cas, you gave me your trust back in high school when you came out to me. It's time for me to return the favor." Dean took a deep breath. "Cas, I'm bi… and I love you."
Oh well, they have another sixteen hours or so of solitary confinement in the car together. He’ll just have to double down on the charm.
Dean isn’t sure how long they stayed like that, but it wasn’t until Feathers pulled his head from Dean’s shoulder that Dean realized he was still holding the bird and released him, the feeling of peace and comfort he had been feeling only noticeable as it fell away.
Dean wonders what’s going through his head. He drums the steering wheel with his fingers to the beat of the music, whistling quietly along. Still no reaction from the passenger seat.
“Hey, Cas… mind if I use your shower? I’m not setting foot in that one again,” he says, nodding toward his own room with an exaggerated look of disgust.
Or, “normal” for an elemental force of nature, anyway.
getting naked, and he silently curses the unfairness of not getting to watch it happen.
Dean stamps down on the part of himself that would like nothing more than to pursue whatever this is… but no. The job.  Do the job. Plenty of time for fun later.
Castiel feels the heat of a blush flashing across the back of his neck and across his face, his embarrassment warring with a sense of outrage. “Sam, no!” he hisses. “Dean is not expressing affection of his own volition. He’s been compelled!” Castiel drops his gaze to his hands, surprised to find them clenching again. “It wouldn’t be right to take advantage of his condition, regardless of my feelings for him.”
Jo tugs at his hand. “Come
Dean glances once more at the flop cards — A, K, J, J — and down at his hole cards, the ace and king of hearts. Cas and Lee have since moved from the bar to a table closer to the rail separating the spectators from the players as the action intensified. Both of them are studying Roman almost as much as Dean is.
The patience and encouragement of my beta
Sam’s expression grows serious. “Has he been making you uncomfortable? How bad has he been? He hasn’t… propositioned you or anything, has he?” Sam pauses to swallow uncomfortably. “Or worse?”
He brushes the tiny leaves with gentle fingers. “Hey there, little one.”

Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Sam roll his eyes, but the accompanying smile on his face was fond and happy. His eyes meet Dean’s, and he gives him a barely perceptible nod of approval, and raises his bottle, angling the neck toward Dean.
“Shit,” Dean whispers. “Fucking hell.”
-create it. No matter what you do, it’ll always exist… if only in the mind of its creator.
“Dean.” Cas looks, if anything, frightened. He steps away again.
Dean pants. “What?”
“So? You go back, then,” she snaps at Sam. “I got words for Dean.”
Cas barely manages to shake his head.
“You’re the man of the house now, huh,” Dean says, looking up at him.
“Yes. Enough to do it again, though I might want to stick to locations with running water.”

“Ain’t hungry.”
“Done used up all my sweet getting fucked blind.”
Everything you wanted.
In this chapter, one male character fingers another male character while they each compare the other to The Biblical Moses. Which, like, is far from the number one reason I’d go to hell, but I do think it'd make for a decent ice breaker when meeting other damned souls.
To the damn Winchester house. Where John motherfucking Winchester lived.
“What I done?” Dean asks, but Balthazar just looks sourly away. “Hey, come on, pal; it’s gonna be a long drive. Tell me what I done.”
Shit.
Dean feels a brush of skin and jumps, but it’s just Cas grabbing his other hand, which he washes just as gently as he had the first one.
For him.
It’s like his whole body’s stuck, buzzing in place like a fly on flypaper.
The angel picks up a phone and hits a button. They turn away from Dean, and so Dean sneaks to the corner of the desk, from where he can see the elevator bay. As he watches, one of the elevators opens and a pair of angels steps out. Throwing a quick glance behind him to the bitchy reception angel, Dean darts into the elevator.
And besides that, I’ve been thinking—
“Don’t want a robe to yourself? That’s fine, tough guy like you. Wear all the britches you want.” Dean breezes into the room and past Cas, gathering up Cas’s shirt and draping it on his shoulders for him. He leaves his own clothes in a puddle on the floor. “Come on, leave that; I’ll show you around.”
Cas frowns, and stops with the buttons. “Are you uncomfortable?”
“We just gotta talk about it first, okay?”
“What's that?”
“‘Cas?’”
“We’re not doing this again.”
Do you, Chuck Shurley, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you… you?
“Out west. In this empty old saloon. People will pay good money to hear someone can play like that. You oughta be in a concert hall in New York—“
Cas leans over him and Dean has to struggle not to pant into Cas’s mouth as he kisses him. Cas’s hand was so big, so steady. “What does my good little whore want?” he asks.
Dean blinks, surprised. “Thought you liked it?”
“Good night.”
“Did you sleep well? Last night?”
. He remembers Cas leaving him that first night in Purgatory. Fighting to find him. He remembers praying. Praying every night. Praying every spare moment.
Maybe.
Dean smiles and sits on his bed. “I miss you too, baby.”
“Are you close, baby?”
Dean isn’t sure he can do this. Cas is staring, waiting, and meanwhile Dean has to pick up the remains of his melted brain and try to mush them into shape.
“Always,” Cas whispers.
Dean decides to wait for a proper apology before throwing that word around. He walks to the telegraph office and sends the ‘kmiss’ you version. He heads back to the house feeling antsy; he almost misses doing Bela’s laundry and clean-up. He far prefers being busy to being anxious, to spending six whole weeks needing to talk to Cas and being unable to. The letter is something. He might get a telegram later in the day, and that would be something, too. Then three more weeks, and probably another letter in there somewhere, one sent from Jackson. At least Cas still wanted him. It was so much more than was reasonable. So much more than Dean deserved.
“Adam’s good. Managing the ranch, actually.”
“Dean,” he moans, gripping Dean’s shoulders and thrusting into Dean’s hand and Dean leans closer, lips tickling against his ears and sending shivers down Cas’s neck.
Dean deserved every ghost he got. Even the good ones hurt.
But damn, had it felt good.
“—then, please. Please, just tell me now.”
“No. I won’t give it to you yet. You have to earn it first.”
Dean kisses the base of his cock, feels the heat of it against his lips. “Where do you want it?”
“You, too, sir.”
“Jewish person.”
Before what?
Sam turns to his client.
Dean sniffs. He’s not making eye contact.
It’s not one kiss, but a series: slow, chaste kisses, lips only, pressing against lips. Dean’s head bobs gently while Cas lies still, holding his hand to Dean’s cheek, feeling the very real scratch of Dean’s stubble to ground him alongside the nearly fantastical softness of Dean’s lips.
Yeah, I do.
Dean draws him closer, raises a hand to his neck, and pulls their mouths flush. Cas’s lips are cold, as if he hasn’t quite adjusted to the world of the living yet. Dean opens his mouth hungrily, capturing Cas’s lips one by one, warming them with his own, sucking them gently. It feels real. God, Cas, he wants to say. I don’t know how to live without you anymore.
“Okay.” Dean nods, staring away from Cas, straight out the windshield, just for a moment. Just to get himself together.
“Will you get him up?”
Cas waits.
“I wanted—Shit—I wanted you to just take me, like when you stole the Colt. I wanted you to just hold me down and make me feel good. Fuck. Make me feel so good.”
“It seems that way.” Cas makes eye contact again.
Dean rolls his shoulder out of Benny’s grip. What he doesn’t need is more people telling him what to do.
Dean flashes the concierge a wide smile and pays for his room in advance. He’s in a good mood, after spending most of his day with Sam and Jessica. He heads upstairs and dumps his pack. There is in fact a tub, and what seem to be down pillows on a (Dean tests it)
Cas almost gasps. This is what Dean had meant? This is what he’d offered?
Dean swallows thickly. “Get off, dude. Leave some for Cas.”
Scene 6: ext. heaven-clearing. Day.
“Ranch needs hands.”
“Not yet, darlin’,” says Dean, remembering himself and sitting back up. “Gotta earn it first.”
“You save all your drawings?” Dean asks.
“Do you want that now?” Cas asks.
“Hey, Cas?”
“Strange gun for a cowboy to have, wouldn’t you say? Couldn’t hit a coyote, or a rabbit, or an Indian. Nothing that far away.”
, he wants he wants—
“You want to be good for me?”
“Huh.” Cas doesn’t seem interested in elaborating. Rufus had given Dean plenty of shit over his ignorance, but not for the same transgressions that Cas is focusing on. “Anyway, he’s the one done told me about Passover and all that. You don’t gotta be jealous of him.”
“So… what’s up?” Sam asks.
“I like Lorna, too,” Cas adds conversationally. “She was very welcoming.”
“I’ve got you beat.”
Cas gasps and so Dean stops pumping him and gives him a squeeze.
CHUCK
“That’s good to know.”
“After.”
“Thanks, buddy,” Dean whispers.
“Mm-hm?”
“It was too heavy to bring with me.”
It had already been stressed enough trying to grapple with the concepts of openness, of love, of sex, of Dean saying the words
Cas whines. “I’m
Dean wanders to the table.
He leans forward and fumbles at Cas’s shirt buttons. The damn thing was already half undone, but it feels like an age before he can get them all and rip the fabric away. He sits back up, rolling his hips into Cas’s thrusts, letting Cas’s hands pull him into each hit, absolutely keening with how quick and deep Cas is going, then he grips his cock hard and starts pumping himself frantically, need overtaking pleasure, Cas’s strong fingers gripping into him, Cas’s hungry eyes watching him; he can feel the orgasm rising, everywhere, like it’s in his whole body, tensing him up til he’s nothing but a single, desperate need, riding the cusp of it until Cas thrusts into him again, and then it bursts, pleasure ripping through him, from his stomach out to his toes and fingers and mouth, the wide, heaving expanse of Cas’s chest a perfect canvas for it, white streaks on black hair, and then Cas is holding him tighter, closer, they’re rolling over and Dean is on his back, and Cas is still fucking him, face to face now, a hand on Dean’s cheek. There’s a low whining sound that Dean realizes is coming from his own mouth. He’s beginning to feel somewhat delirious, but at the feeling of Cas’s thumb on his lips he opens them, sucking at it mindlessly and obediently, the floor cool on his back and Cas hot above him, mumbling words: “Dean,” and “you’re,” and
“Someone taught me desire.”
, he realizes,
Cas kisses the top of his head. “It’s alright. Shh.” He holds Dean closer, shushing and cooing and petting him. Comforting him, after what he’d done. “I’m alright. You’re alright. Everyone’s alright.”
Cas speaks softly. “Dean, I—“
Chuck isn’t sure he can do that.
To the girls that worked there, however, it was known simply as the house, and that’s what it was. They lived downstairs, in one room all together like a dormitory, in two rows of twin beds. They had a kitchen, where they could all stuff together for meals, a giant laundry room open to the back yard, which always billowed with drying sheets, a private washroom with a large tub, and of course Jo’s office, where they could air their grievances. Jo herself had a bedroom, too, right across from the girls’ in the back of the house, but the girls didn’t go in there unless something unusual was going on. They were all lost, in their own ways, and found by Sister Jo, who kept a roof over their heads and the law off their backs.
Cas takes it well, making a muffled moan of surprise before grabbing Dean’s hips and holding him closer, mouth opening obediently and eagerly. Dean fucking devours him; it’s been too fucking long since their lips touched. He moves his mouth like he wants Cas inside him, like he wants to be inside Cas, like the taste of him is getting him high. He loses his breath, but doesn’t care. He’s got one hand between them holding Cas’s shirt tight, the other on his bicep, feeling how strong it is, how it flexes as Cas holds him, looping his fingers through Dean’s belt loops and pulling him in. Dean has to grip Cas tightly as he goes on tiptoes, seeking a new angle on Cas’s mouth and nearly falling over, forcing Cas to hold him up with a large hand on his back. Cas pushes his tongue into Dean’s mouth, making him moan around it. Dean moves his hand to Cas’ neck in order to press in harder, slide his tongue against Cas’s, hold Cas there against the wall; he’s so fucking done with waiting—
Cas falls quiet and they rock there in silence, Cas’s arms thick and warm. Eventually Dean turns around so he can kiss Cas, sucking on his lips and licking gently between them. Cas presses him against the stable door, jostling it and making Baby whinny. Dean breaks away to comfort her.
“Might could do more than that. Mouth’s up here, you know.”
Charlie squeezes his shoulder. “No, he don’t. It’s just—You got out, Dean.”
They roll into town and check in at the motel and Dean’s already made plans. This may be Jack’s case, but as far as Dean is concerned, it’s his vacation. It’s starting to get late, so he grabs Cas and sets out with him before the stores close, leaving Sam and Jack to finish setting up in the room.
“What?” Cas squints over at Dean.
said with no possible ulterior motive.
They were about to do more than that.
“Ain’t no coffee,” Cas grumbles, and Dean’s stomach does that flip it does whenever he talks Texan.
“Will you sit with me?”
“I don’t see how that’ll calm me down.”
Dean opens his eyes again crankily and does as he’s told. Cas moves his finger all around in front of Dean’s face, tracking Dean’s eyes as they follow it.
Dean thinks wistfully of a camera. That couldn’t be anywhere close to Charlie’s price range. “All the man ever wants is a bath and some— oh. Coffee.”
“I can’t bring Jack on the drives with me, so I need a new source of income. Anna lent me some money; the rest I’ll borrow from the bank.”
Cas hums Daisy Bell, or something like it. Baby finishes the feed in Dean’s hand and Dean rubs Cas’s hands softly; they’re clean, but dry and cracked from too much time in the desert. Dean leans back into him and Cas supports his weight. He does still smell of that cigarette.
“First things first,” says Balthazar as they have breakfast at one of the Sunrise Inn’s two tables. “I vote we go back and stay in the Casa Bonita tonight.”
“So what, baby?” Dean’s smiling up at him, still breathing heavily but weirdly calm.
“That’s from the final verse of the song. It makes me think of our first time, that night in Maine. The vows… the rules that we agreed to, that never felt right. Before we kissed for the second time, you said it. I thought maybe that’s what you meant, too. That you remembered. That you hated those rules as much as I did.”
Cas looks to Dean.
“Luck, I suppose.”
Dean stares at him steadily, but his mouth twitches. “Shit, Cas, are you gonna make me say it?”
“Not flexible,” Cas explains, lifting a hand and separating his fingers as wide as they go. Dean had never considered such a thing before, a physical requirement to play music.
Dean laughs, earning himself a jab in the side from Cas’s elbow. Cas is frowning at Balthazar darkly, so Dean leans in close to him to say, “You got big hands.”
Dean breathes out slowly. “Of course, baby. Any requests?”
“Mm-hm.”
“No. I just. I don’t know.”
“He is
“Tell Jo—and Adam—tell them I said I’m the dumbest sack of shit this side of the moon.”
Dean wets his hands and grabs the bar of soap from the shelf, lathering them up.
“Alright. You can tap?”
“What?” Dean pours himself more water and grabs a box of cold pizza. There’s only a couple of slices left; mister healthy-pants must have had a cheat day.
Close on Dean’s face as he awakens. He’s bleary, still sleepy. Lying down.
“Go ahead and ask, feathers. I’m an open book.”
“It’s conceivable that I might have, as you say. If I were to lose control I could release a pulse of grace strong enough to blind or even destroy you.”
Cas breathes in the scent of Dean’s pillow. How long?
Dean sits there and waits while Cas searches the room. He feels thirsty, and raw. A match flares, then a lantern is lit. Cas puts it on the counter. The spigot now in sight, Dean hops off the table to grab himself water, but Cas stops him before he can get to the tap. He eyes Dean’s chest with something like horror on his face.
“Want me to get you one?”
How long we been driving?
Dean sets about it, pulling out a bowl and ingredients. “So, what d’you want to do today?”
“—Oh. Oh, shit, sorry.” Dean gets up and kneels over Cas. He kisses Cas’s cock gently. It’s salty, ready. Dean looks back up to check on Cas, but as he does so realizes there’s no need to be so careful. Cas isn’t the same angel he hooked up with all those years ago. He no longer looks afraid of, or overwhelmed by, sex. He’s looking down seriously, more like an eagle-eyed foreman than some timid virgin, and Dean isn’t sure what that expression is exactly, but there’s something about it that sets his heart beating fast. Dean looks away and drops down, opening Cas’s legs so he can suck one of his balls gently. Above him, Cas moans quietly, almost a sigh. Dean swirls his tongue, tries to make it good, tries to make himself worth Cas’s time. By the time he takes Cas’s cock into his mouth, Cas is practically snapping at him to get to it, panting and impatient with want, a celestially powerful hand guiding him over to his work, and Dean goes to it gladly, mindlessly, and a little more in love with Cas than ever before.
“You’re sure difficult, you know that, darlin’?”
“Now, look here.” Dean holds the gate open with the heel of his boot and adjusts his hat. “What are you, anyway, a Texas ranger, or a thievin’ cowpoke?”
“You’re fucking gorgeous, Cas,” Dean whispers. “All of you.”
“Like Michael’s trying to break out of my head with a pickaxe.”
The bells start ringing. People would be coming soon. Dean isn’t sure what else there is to say. He looks for a flower, and finds a dandelion growing nearby. He picks it and lays it down onto her.
“You didn’t do anything wrong, Dean. I just don’t think it’s a good idea.”
“You really did that?”
It takes a while. There’s a thrill of excitement in him, keeping him up. His lips seem to burn.
“You said I could more than double your earnings. Fifty is reasonable.”
He watches them ride away, Bal’s lantern fading as they go.
Dean—
in my
“He does?” Dean asks, trying to keep up with Jack’s pace while bending over to hold his hand and stretching his back a bit too far.
“Your letters, stupid.”
“Dean?”
You know, you’re not doing too bad yourself. You’ve become downright domestic, living here.
“Then we can both of us have a good time.”
“I’m human, Dean. I could die. I
“Are you sure?” Eileen glances toward Cas meaningfully.
They find the spell in a book buried deep in the Men of Letters’ library.
“Say it. I know you want to.”
“Other side, kid,” Dean says as he sits up and rubs the sleep from his eyes, figuring if he didn’t panic, the kid wouldn’t, either.
“Up,” Cas orders when he gets back to bed.
“Yes, bastard, fuck.” Dean slaps his palm down against the bed, arching his back, trying to get contact.
Dean almost smiles at this, then he thinks again about Cas, about telling him to ‘get’ like he was a dog, about the sad look on his face as he’d walked out. “Shit.”
“Do?”
“Go easy on me?”
“It’s tradition.”
“Fine,” she’d said. “I’ll let you move in today. Talk to Benny, follow him once you’re feeling up to it, and no touching yet, hear? Just watch. It’s five dollars a week, plus half what you bring in. I’ll warn you again; that’s a girl’s wage, and not a lot of men come here expecting boys. I pay Benny more for security than whoring, but I can’t afford to pay you what I pay him.”
I can’t hold him much longer. GO!
They drive back to the bunker with stupid grins on their faces.
Cas looks down at him with red eyes.
CHUCK
“No, I’ll go. I’ll go, darlin’. Just.” Dean takes Cas’s hand. “Don’t go getting your hopes up, hear?”
“Deep breath, now,” Dean instructs, and Cas obeys. Dean presses on his head and after a second of resistance, Cas allows himself to be pushed under. Dean lets him back up and watches as he drips, smaller than he was before, a bit like bathing a dog.
“Fuck. Fuck, Dean.”
“Oh. Yeah, but I already knowed that,” she says flippantly.
“Oh.” Cas stares at the mess he’s already made of the sink.
All Dean can seem to do is laugh. He’s so happy. His arms wrap around Cas. He finds Cas’s mouth and shuts him up with his lips. Cas is thrusting against him, still hard, and Dean finds that he is, too, the oversensitivity gone. God, it’s good. He wants more. “Cas, how do I—how does it work?”
Dean lets himself stare openly at Cas’s mouth. He lowers his voice and lets that syrup into it that he hardly used anymore. “Nice, to be able to take a warm bath.” After a practiced fraction of a second more of staring, he flicks his eyes back up to Cas’s.
“Good. That’s good. You know, I should really head back. So he won’t get suspicious.”
“Seriously, dude? You’ve been following me around how long now?”
Dean puts his boots on, and then his hat.
“Cas,” he says, and Cas does him the favor of looking over. It
“What about the horse?”
Dean smiles a small smile. “Yeah, babe.”
After the change, though. After the point of no return had passed, he always knew what to do: He held his head high. Adapted. Did whatever needed to be done.
“…I see.” There’s a note of disappointment in Cas’s voice. Horny bastard.
what’s true.
He wishes he had a horse. He wishes he could ride and ride, faster than the wind, until everything was behind him.
“Don’t, Cas.” The guilt is too big, too near.
“Thank you, Sam.”
Benny gives him a look, somewhere between what-the-hell-just-happened and puppy eyes, and Dean claps him on the shoulder by way of thanks, by way of acting normal. They trudge back into the house behind Ruby and Donna, and when they head on to the parlor, Dean turns into the bedroom, only to find Cas there, back to the door, sitting on Dean’s bed and facing Meg, who’s sitting on hers, talking quietly together. Dean bangs the door against the wall as he comes in even though it was already open.
Cas makes it worthwhile, too, just with little looks, mostly, but he asks questions, as well, not from the list anymore but as they come to mind, about growing up on a ranch, about the kind of cattle they had, about how Dean’s daddy taught him to rope, back when Dean’s daddy had been interested in being a daddy. He touches Dean, too, just a few times, a hand on his back during a break, another hand on his shoulder at lunch. Those little things drive Dean crazy in a way they never had before— something about being stuck a few feet away on their horses all day. Something about people other than whores being around to see them. If Miguel and Tagg had been anyone less accepting than Miguel and Tagg, Dean and Cas might have an arrest to look forward to in Santa Fe. As it is, the more experienced cowpokes don’t seem to mind them any, though Miguel asks a few indelicate questions which make Cas’s brow furrow. Dean answers them cheerily and graphically.
“No.” Cas stares him straight on, a determined look in his eye. A lie that made itself true in the telling.
Dean nearly coughs into his dinner. Cas’s lips and eyes narrow.
“A turn?”
“You still good, Cas?”
“Alright.”
“I do, darlin’. Want to take good care of you.” Dean doesn’t bother clarifying that fantasy dick-sucking and reality dick-sucking are two completely different dick-suckings.
Cas releases him. “Sorry, Dean.”
“Well, hey, don’t leave me in suspense.”
“I don’t—” Cas protests. Dean cuts him off with a kiss.
“And neither is Miss Kline. And I’ve never slept with her. Biologically speaking, I’m Jack’s uncle.”
“Fuck.” He leans on his heels and lets his head fall back. His hat falls off, dangling from its string. “You got money?”
“You were glad,” says Cas slowly, “that he came to attack you, because otherwise he might have attacked little Jo?”
“Oh,” says Dean. A silence falls between them. “Did I— I didn’t mean to make you—”
“About what?”
Cas gives him a dollar, and Dean gets dressed, properly, in his clothes, hat, and boots, and heads down to the parlor, where he buys them a bottle of whiskey from Ruby, who’s covering the bar. Sister Jo watches him do it with a careful eye.
Cas huffs. Dean closes his eyes and listens as Cas puts his charcoal and paper on the dresser, then the whiskey glasses, too. The bed sinks as Cas kneels onto it, and—
An arm wraps around him, then a body presses up to his back.
Cas smiles and holds Dean’s head steady, and he’s so soft and sweet Dean could just wrap him up in paper and sell him for a penny.
Dean listens to Bal play the same short sequence of notes over and over, practicing it. “Seven months, though,” he says, trying to sound encouraging. “That’s real impressive.”
Just him and the kid.
“I hear.”
“Yeah.”
After a second, the sheriff pulls out a paper and looks at it. “Let me help you out. Starts with a ‘C.’”
“Dean. Just breathe.”
Charlie closes the door. They can still hear the others in the kitchen, moving around each other, figuring out what food they had and what they’d forgotten to buy when they were in town.
“—Damn good at riding,” Cas finishes wryly. His hands move to Dean’s thighs, working them firmly. Dean’s throat makes a little noise. “I have an extra pair you can use. They should fit better than these, anyway.”
“Darlin’. I’m sorry, darlin’. Never shoulda sent you away. Never gonna send you away again.”
Dean swallows. His eyes dart around the bar before settling down at his beer.
“Okay, bud. See you in the morning.”
being thrown between him and John. It makes his back feel scratchy, makes him want to drink, or fight, or both. “Ain’t no God,” he says. The words fall heavier than they ought to in the dark room, lantern light flickering off the bath water. “Your daddy a church ever’ Sunday type?” Dean’s finished washing Cas now; he lifts himself into Cas’s lap, eager to lighten the mood.
Cas just looks tired. “The decision’s been made, Dean. John is dead—“
After Purgatory, after he’d allowed himself to spend so much time with thoughts of Cas, talking to him, longing for him, his will had weakened and nearly broken, but he’d built it back up again after taking the Mark. He had felt a sort of relief when it had appeared on his arm. With it there, Dean had the blessing of certainty. He had known not to try anything, that they were doomed from the start.
“Thought you was fixing to tie me up anyhow.”
“Uh. That bad, huh?” Dean looks down at himself, but of course that doesn’t tell him anything. “Isn’t Heaven supposed to botox me or something?”
“I know, but why
Scene 8: ext. Heaven. Clearing. Day.
Dean bobs around Cas, sucks gently, feels him hit the back of his mouth. He can hear Cas breathing roughly above him, and he times his movements to that metronome, slowly sucking gasps and moans from his angel until Cas speaks again, frustrated now, wheedling. “Deaaan.” Dean hums around him, which shuts him up; humming always made Cas groan. It’s too loud, in the open, but Dean doesn’t mind. It’s been so long since he’s heard that sound, since he’s heard Cas lose control and just
Charlie leans onto the table heavily with her elbows, head in her hands. “Geeze. She came here. She was writing you. Did he—“
“Already knowed that.”
But now Dean is picturing blowing Cas, the feel of him hard in his mouth, knowing that Cas was watching as he got on his knees and serviced him. Dean’s hand gains momentum. He imagines the feeling of Cas’s hand on the back of his head, holding him in place. “Hell yes you would, Cas. You’re so sexy, Cas.”
“Feels good.”
“Dean.”
“Another good word to know,” says Cas, vitriolic, “is
“Meg, I swear to God—”
“You don’t like it when I talk nice.”
Dean takes a deep breath and puts a hand on Cas’s. He stretches out a bit, chasing the sleep from his muscles. He turns his head and kisses Cas’s palm. “Alright.”
“Well, it lost its appeal once they refused to sell me any chew or alcohol and I had to endure the two of you ogling each other.”
“I— I’ll certainly try.”
Dean raises his head again, resting his forehead against Cas’s, sharing breath. He rubs Cas’s groin gently. Cas’s eyes are closed now, his breath shallow.
Dean STARTS FORWARD and Sam HOLDS him back.
Balthazar blows smoke at him. “You, currently.”
“I’m gonna hit the hay,” he announces, and leaves the room.
“Good. My good boy.” Castiel kisses his wrist.
He can’t stand here like some fucking puritan all night. He’s Dean Fucking Winchester.
“Yeah?” Dean’s heart rate climbs in anticipation.
“Ain’t nothing, Cas. Christ.”
“Sure I am. Didn’t you want me to?”
“Well if it ain’t Calamity Joannity,” Dean quips.
“Tell me this isn’t what it’s gonna be like every time you want something, please.”
“Got himself some nasty bruises, but he’s alright. Nothing broken.”
They hide Cas’s horse on the opposite side of the house from the actual barn and get her some feed and water. Cas is doubtful about the arrangement, but Dean thinks it’ll work out neat. Anyway, it sure beat the neighbor coming in the morning and finding an extra horse in the barn. They climb in through the window Bela had told Dean about and before Dean can get the lay of the land, Cas grabs him hard by his pelvis and pushes him against a wall. Dean knocks his head, and they near knock down a shelf of plates, too, but it’s hard for Dean to care, with Cas finally kissing him, lips pressing, then sucking, then sliding. Their mouths lock together as their hats fall to the floor and their belt buckles clink, then scrape, together. Dean fumbles for Cas’s shirt and Cas picks up on Dean’s urgency, starting to unbutton Dean’s. They scramble out of their clothes, breathing panting breaths as they are forced to break away in order to remove their clothing. They mash their open mouths together desperately, painfully, just trying to reach each other. Cas pushes Dean back toward the wall again once they’re naked, and Dean goes like butter streaking across a too-hot pan, nearly tripping over the pile of clothing on the ground. Dean hisses as Cas’s hand finds his dick and pumps it relentlessly, far too much too soon. Cas bites at Dean’s neck.
“Alright.”
Dammit.
“Please, Cas. Everything is… I just wanna turn off for a minute. Just wanna do what you tell me. You’re so good at it. I need you, baby.”
Dean’s hands pull Cas forward hard by the neck. His lips mash hot and hungry against Cas’s. Cas gasps into Dean, too surprised by the sudden onslaught of physicality to be anything other than helpless in Dean’s hands. He accepts Dean’s tongue, his lips, his teeth. Dean starts ripping at Cas’s tie and the rest of his clothing and Cas stands there powerless to even want to stop him.
, and a competing one crying
“Uh-huh. Don’t usually let men do that.”
Dean’s dying to talk more, but he convinces himself to convince Jo to leave. He gets her on her horse and sends her off and by the time he gets back to bed, the sun is rising.
“Sure, Cas. Just an accountant.” He turns back to the trunk, setting the bone back in the trunk’s weapons compartment before lowering the compartment lid and fastening it shut. Dean closes the trunk, steadfastly ignoring the slight tremor of his hands. He steadies his breathing as he leans against the garage-cool car.
“And I, you, Dean.”
Davis approaches them. “Hey guys… we’re about to head out, but we’re only going over to Golden Gardens Park to watch the sunset and hang out around the fire pits. You’re welcome to join.” He nudges Dean with his elbow. “The group’s really taken a shine to you,” he says with a bright grin, “and your Baby, of course.”
“Her spark is nearly gone, almost as much as Dean’s,” Cas said quietly. “She will not only be a good test, but we’ll also save her life if it works.”
“Oh...oh God, yes, Cas,” his voice sounding absolutely wrecked in his own ears.
WIthout a word, Cas picks him up and carries him to the couch, laying him down and propping a pillow under his head. Dean closes his eyes, exhausted, and hears Cas’ quick footsteps head in the direction of the kitchen, then returning and kneeling beside him. Sliding a hand beneath Dean’s head, Cas gently tips him up and Dean feels the cool press of glass against his lips, and opens them to gratefully sip the water within. After a few more sips, Cas lays his head back down and places the glass on the coffee table behind him. Picking Dean up again, Cas lays on the couch himself and pulls Dean on top of him, cradling Dean’s head against his chest.
The Leviathan’s head is across the room in a pool of black goo, the wall splattered with it, the trail leading back to the decapitated body in its own black puddle.
“Yeah, I’m here. Couldn’t you have given me another hour to, I dunno,
Dean pulls his Baby into the casino’s drop-off area and cuts the ignition, eyes narrowing as a valet approaches. The kid opens the door for him and Dean emerges, draws himself up to his full height, and glowers down at him, eyes scanning the nametag pinned on his chest.
Cas frowns and looks down, working over the ingredients in the bowl. “I am disappointed as well - but for it to be a true test of whether the curse has been lifted, I - unfortunately - cannot be touching you.” Nodding with satisfaction at his preparations, he turns and crosses over to the door where Dean stands, wrapping his arms around his waist and pulling him close to whisper in his ear, “It is only for one night.”
Cas was standing at the foot of the bed, looking at Dean like a thirsty man looking at water - and he was
But he really hated that bitch, so screw her.
Dean turns to Cas, throwing an arm over his shoulder. “Whadda ya say, sweetheart? Our first sunset…” he shakes the bag of food in his other hand, “and dinner on the West Coast?”
During the drive back to the bunker, Sam spared a glance over to see how Cas was doing. He sat unmoving and unspeaking in the passenger seat, a hand placed over the breast pocket where Dean’s figurine rested, his eyes staring sightlessly ahead.
Dean turns back, knife held behind his back, and is stunned by the man before him. Wide, ice-blue eyes seem to glow from within, boring into his as if seeing directly into his soul. Hair wild, full lips pressed into a shy smile even though Dean and Bobby had just pumped him full of rock salt.
of birds settling down for the night fading into the distance.
“Got a flight booked already, we’ll be there tomorrow morning.”
“Oh, uh…I put those on you,” he says, face flushing. “I… I was worried you might catch a cold, or… or something.”
beat him, Cas. Look into my eyes and tell me I can’t.”
This was a
“You’re going to have to palpate the area. Gently press around the injury to see if you can feel the break.”
Sam was all but bouncing in the hallway, brandishing a book in his hand which he thrust into Castiel’s as soon as he straightened. Apparently unable to speak in his excitement, Sam jabbed a finger at a passage in the book listing ingredients for a cake and a potion, labeled in puzzlingly obvious fashion “Eat Me” and “Drink Me”, respectively.
The recent hours-long conversation between Sam and Cas a couple of days ago is still fresh in his mind, and Dean can’t help but chuckle at the memory. What Sam had hoped would be an interview and study of Angels for the Men Of Letters records, Cas turned right back on him, changing it into an '
“Well, Mr. Winchester… it
Staggering half-asleep into the library and seeing a row of incredibly life-like ten-inch dolls staring at him had been a shock to the system. Even the memory was enough to make him shiver.
Cas ignores him, but the frown is replaced by a smirk. “I am Dimitri Collins,” he says lightly, “and you are James T. Beyonce.”
Dean was still unsure as to whether he was going to say anything about it at all - he was still experimenting with the idea of his bisexuality, even going so far as to date a very sweet girl, Lisa, and while he liked her a lot, was still attracted to her - he just couldn’t get Cas out of his mind.
well during his training in London.
When he lost his Grace and became human like them, he was certain his own experiences would be as limited and pushed it from his mind. What he had gained — taste, touch, feeling, and most of all,
“Good boy.” Dean shudders involuntarily from the praise. Castiel slides his hand from Dean’s neck and through his hair, petting him while gently pushing his forehead to the edge of the bed. “Rest now, and don’t move. I’ll be right back.” Reaching down into Dean’s pocket, Castiel pulls out the keys to the Impala and steps away, followed by the sound of the motel room door opening and closing.
He sighed into the phone. “Listen, the more I think about it, the more I think it’s probably just a fluke. Or, maybe the curse is starting to wear off.”
Dean isn’t sure if she’s talking about the trip… or his inadvertent admission.
For the first time in four years, he

loves topping.
Dean’s heart rate spikes, his voice rumbling against Castiel’s ear as he quickly barks out, “Everything’s fine, Sam! Just knocked over my lamp, s’all good, go back to sleep!”
Dean breaks away, gasping. “God, Cas… that feels
Cas wasted no time in taking advantage of his position, fingers grasping the hem of Dean's shirt and whipping it over his head to toss in some random direction, and Dean audibly gasped as the burning blue of Cas’ eyes met his.
He’s got work to do. He turns and steps toward the row of dreamcatchers, lighting the flamethrower.
it — the near-ecstasy of the pulse of the earth coming back to life after the dormancy of winter; but then discovering that most humans still only noticed the visual effects — the greening and flowering of the earth around them — saddened him.
appear to be diminishing. If anything, it is burning
Sam nodded in agreement, and Cas passed Tracy’s figurine to him. “Go, take her to the infirmary and prepare the Blue Faery spell. The cupcakes should almost be ready, and I want to check in on Dean before we proceed,” he said quietly, turning swiftly to leave.
Lips...very distracting, Castiel notes to himself. Very distracting indeed.
He’s stirred from his reverie by Cas pulling away from his shoulder, shifting to his knees and crawling slowly to the edge of the blanket, where a smaller bush of Black-Eyed Susans cheerily waves in the breeze. Dean follows his gaze and sees, perched upon one of the blooms, a plump fuzzy bumblebee.
Dean almost comes right then and there.
It was cowardice, pure and simple. He admonishes himself for it — he should be there for Dean, come what may. But there are just some things he cannot bear, and having Dean reject him outright without a buffer is the greatest of them.
The next moment, Dean is pulled into Cas’ lap, Cas’ lips hot against his own, and Dean dives in, tongue tasting the edges of Cas’ lips before being sucked in, and whining at the feel of Cas growing hard against his thigh. His hips thrust involuntarily against Cas’ length, his own erection growing and sliding along Cas’, and Cas growls, sucking in Dean’s bottom lip and biting.
As Dean kneels before the net and examines the bent wing, he sees bits of white and dots of red among the ebony feathers - bones, and blood. The bird’s wing was broken, more than likely as it flew into the net.
Then everything goes still and dark save for the lights still dancing behind his eyelids. It could have been a minute or a millennia, but then nimble fingers release the knots binding him to the chair and pull him free, laying him on his back. A brush of wool presses against the outside of either thigh, light pressure on top. Warm, familiar hands caress his face, kisses pressed to his lips, his cheeks, his eyes. “Dean… Dean, open your eyes.”
"Cas, what are these?"
about his feelings. He’s only ever been good at
Several hands go by. Dean holds his own — wins a few, loses a few. Roman does as well, but other players don’t fare as well. Soon only four players remain — Dean, Roman,  Edgar, and, surprisingly, Charlie Bradbury, who rallied over the last couple of hands.
At sixteen years of age, Castiel was able to recognize and admire beauty when he saw it, and when he first laid eyes on Dean that day, he was struck dumb by the sight.
“Uh, right, okay,” Dean stammers, turning back around and slinging the duffle onto his shoulder. “You ready to go? Daylight’s burnin’”
Turning into the kitchen doorway, he is greeted by the enjoyable sight of Dean bent over in front of the refrigerator, jeans stretched tight over his superior posterior. He smirks at his own thought — “superior posterior”. Rhymes always please him greatly, especially when they’re his own.
It’s Lee’s turn to grin and pull Dean in for a crushing, back-pounding hug. “Great job, darlin’,” he drawls softly in Dean’s ear, his closeness leaving no doubt in Dean’s mind that Lee would gladly pick up where they left off — but no. Dean now knows where his heart lies.
“While you two have been… whatever you were doing… I DON’T WANT TO KNOW!” Sam interjected and threw up a hand as Cas ‘ mouth opened, certain that he was about to begin explaining
As Dean starts the engine and pulls out of the parking lot, Castiel pulls out one of the bottles they purchased to examine the label. 12.5 percent ABV. It doesn’t seem like a lot, but of course, he’s mostly human now, with no grace to buffer the effects of the alcohol. But he finds he doesn’t really mind; it’s a rather pleasant feeling — fizzy and floaty and glowing.
Sam bursts into the room seconds later, rushing to his side. “DEAN! Dean, what happened?”
“Let’s just say that they... questioned my… priorities,” Cas says, now looking down at his hands as they absently fiddle with the belt of his trench coat. “The British Men of Letters offered me a job, so I left.” And then like the slamming of a door, Cas throws his walls back up, arms folded across his chest and gaze firmly focused out the windshield. “And that is, as we say, that.”
“You need to warm up or you’ll catch a cold,” Castiel says, gently pushing him under the spray, and begins to close the shower door when Dean’s hand grasps his wrist.
“Oh my Go…” Sam cuts himself off, then turns to look at Eileen, who’s doubled over in laughter.
Dean grins. “So, looks like I’m going to be hunting wabbits!”
Soon, Dean hears the sounds of light snoring as the recovering angel falls asleep against him. Reaching over the side of the bed, he fumbles for his t-shirt and uses it to clean them up, then wraps himself around Cas, his nose buried in the soft hair and pressing a kiss there.
His eyes are closed but he definitely hears a sharp intake of breath from the other bed and grins to himself.
They had spent the night in a cozy little cabin at a motor lodge in Phillipsville, both so exhausted they fell asleep almost as soon as their heads hit the pillows.
!” Dean lurches unsteadily to his feet and hurls the glass against the fireplace, shattering it, the shards falling to the hearth like the pieces of his shattered heart.
as you are, I will be keeping my eye on our organization’s money…” The pause is barely a breath as he turns to look back out the windshield — but Dean still catches it. “... and off your perfectly formed ass.”
Glancing up at the bird, head tucked under his good wing and peacefully asleep, he found it hard to believe. But it all made sense.
The spell had worked, but it hadn’t
Dean jerked his head in Cas’ direction. “Doc still has me on lockdown,” and grinned at Cas’ eyeroll, “but feeling much better.” He released her and crossed his arms. “So, you outta here now?”
“Reality? If that were the case, it wouldn’t be called ‘Devils Tower’,” a high, lilting voice calls from the back seat. “Lucifer had nothing to do with this monstrosity.”
But he can practically hear her frown when she reads his proposal and the grin fades. “Dean, you're proposing to play in this game
Afterwards, he spends the rest of the day drinking until he passes out on the couch, and doesn’t move until the morning.
“W-when?” Dean stammers, his brain still struggling to catch up.
, would say about it. In the light of day, even
“Uh... Earth to Cas? You in there, Major Tom?” Dean waves at him, breaking Castiel’s stare and diverting his gaze from Dean’s distractingly full lips, back up to his equally distracting eyes.
He was across the room in an instant, Cas pressed against the wall, the sock snatched from Cas’ hand and flung across the room, Dean’s hands absolutely
Dean does, and notices something new - a warmth, and a small pull against his spirit, as though it were attached to something with a rubber band. He opens his eyes and smiles happily, then pulls Cas down for another deep kiss.
"Sweetheart, are you cold? I mean, the sun’s going down but I'm still pretty warm, are you…" He squeaks as Cas spins him around and presses him against the car.
“The game is no-limit Texas Hold-Em,” the dealer continues, “five communal cards, two in the hole. Minimum stake per play is $10,000.” Another man enters, a large metal case in hand, and the dealer turns to him.
Dean’s frozen. The door closes behind them and tires squeal on the pavement, the Cadillac badge and ‘XTS’ catching the light as it peels away.
“Can’t let the other guys see you like this. You’ll never live it down,” he said softly.
Cas peers at the map on the brochure, brows pinched in concentration.
- just last night, in fact, he was wrapped in this guy’s arms in his dreams, and now here he is.
It broke his heart, and pushed him harder.
“Obviously,” he says with a chuckle, but then Castiel feels him tense. “But why? Why would he lie about that?”
Cas did not linger there, however. Three more slides of that marvelous mouth, three more swirls of his tongue over the head, and he pulled off. Dean looked down and saw what was, in his not so humble opinion, a complete and utter travesty.
Cas pushes back from the table, having devoured two entire crumpets, and Dean is internally patting himself on the back. “I need to drop by Brioni at the Wynn to pick up our suits for the game tonight,” he says casually, as if he’s ordering lunch from McDonald's rather than
Dean nods and hopes his relief isn’t written all over his face, but just as quickly wonders about the frown on
“I should have known,” Dick Roman wheezes from somewhere behind him as Cas returns, holding Dean’s clothes out to him and helping him dress. “I should have known the British Men of Letters would have an angel on a leash.”
condition.”
Cas looks up from the laptop, and Dean blinks as the blue eyes meet his — there’s a flash of ire… jealousy, maybe? But it’s just as quickly gone as he smiles. “Of course, Dean. I hope it’s good news.” His gaze drops back down to the laptop in a clear dismissal, leaving Dean unbalanced and confused.
“Cas…”, Dean groans against Cas’ neck, his lips and tongue tracing down the angel’s neck, his fingers trailing down the scapulars and heading for the oil glands there.
Dean scoffs at that, but out of the corner of his eye, he sees Castiel’s face go blank and still, blue eyes wide as they focus on the bone in Dean’s hand… and just as quickly, gone, as Sam turns to face him with a question in his eyes.
Dean had gone to great measures to make this new human existence of his as pleasurable as possible — introducing him to new flavors in both food and drink, new activities... and many new and different carnal pleasures.
Cas continues to stare at him, puzzled.
“Is your studying going well?” Cas asks casually, curling his legs under him and turning to face him. Dean is once again caught off-guard by how absolutely gorgeous Cas is — and this gives him an idea.
Dean blindly reaches for the whiskey glass and downs the rest in a single gulp.
Castiel nods curtly, and Dean sighs again and returns his attention to the road.
To say Dean is not prepared for what greets him when he wakes up is an understatement.
“Yes, it’s here,”
Castiel buries his nose into Dean’s neck and breathes in, his scent sweet and salty, and presses a kiss against the underside of his jaw, Dean humming his pleasure. “I am feeling very well, Dean… very well, indeed.”
If Dean was awake, he would chip in and help Sam, or help Cas continue the work when Sam was asleep. And if Dean was asleep -- which he was more and more every day -- Cas continued on alone.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel turned to look at the kind stranger.
Sam finds a spell to restore Dean in a place he never would have imagined. Cas and Sam restore the rest of the hunters while Dean recovers, and Dean finally shows Cas
He had helped Sam gather the ingredients for the spell but could not bring himself to participate — asking Sam to question Dean after the spell was over and come to him personally to break the news to him gently rather than be there to witness it for himself.
“Then what’s the point of me getting the license to kill if—”
Roman shrugs, unimpressed. “Give me the password and I’ll let him live.” He strides over, leaning down until he’s face to face with Dean. “Do it soon enough and he might even be in one piece.”
but a private jet with a hot flight attendant or two waiting on him hand and foot would have made the trip marginally better, at least.
Dean nods, braces as Castiel places two gentle fingers on his forehead, and gasps as a memory floods his mind.
Dean sits up and waves him forward, Cas relocating a nearby drink table for the case. Mr. Whitshaw places the case upon it and opens the lid, exposing the screen and keyboard. “Mr. Novak, if you will please enter the account number.”
“We don’t know, yet.”  Sam sniffs and takes a deep, shuddering breath.
“Heya barkeep, what’s good around here?” A cheerful, brassy voice with a hint of a growl and midwest twang sailed above the din of foreign languages.
Blinking, Dean shakes his head and smiles, moving toward the tent. “Yeah… I’m great, Cas.” Kneeling down next to him, he takes Cas’ face in both hands and kisses him, soft and chaste… but the next thing Dean knows, he’s on his back with Cas over him, groaning against his lips as he deepens the kiss.
Then Jack’s hand closes with Cas’ as the last light of the sun fades, Dean feels more than hears a
Wow, speech — in his direction, even. Maybe the guy is finally warming up to him. He puts on his most charming smile. “Cup of coffee, black, and some beef jerky — chili lime, if they have it.” He reaches for his wallet but Cas waves him off as he heads for the attached mini-mart.
“Oh, right, sorry.” Dean matches the bet, shoving the chips into the pot, and using the motion to cover several deep breaths as he gets his heart rate back under control.
“Sam… wait.” Eileen jogs after him, grasping his arm to turn him around. “What are you going to do?”
“There hasn't been very much activity since Chuck left,” Cas explains. “There’s still the occasional hunt but Sam and Eileen took the last one, and Dean was bored.” He takes a sip of the mead and his eyebrows raise.
“Are you alright, Dean?”
An hour ago, Cas stopped by the table to drop a kiss to his cheek, saying he was going up to the room for the night. “Don’t sleep on the couch,” he whispered into Dean’s ear before leaving the room, the honeyed bourbon timbre of Cas’s voice and the warm breath on the shell of Dean’s ear sending pleasant shivers up his spine. Lee made his exit shortly thereafter, with a solid squeeze to his shoulder and a wink.
Dean clapped a hand on Sam’s shoulder. “Hey, no worries! I was in good hands over here,” he said, dropping a wink at Cas whose answering smile was like a beam of pure sunshine.
He pulls his phone from his inner jacket pocket and opens the camera app. The last picture taken displays on the screen — Chet, on the tiled floor of a bathroom at the sports club where Dean killed him. Dean studies the picture again, comparing the dark red blood currently pooled under Ketch with the almost-purple, inky black blood that was under Chet.
“Can’t let the other guys see you like this. You’ll never live it down,” he said softly, reaching up to gently wipe the tears from Castiel’s face with the soft flannel of his sleeve. Satisfied with his work, the beaming smile returned.
— was
As if on cue (or having direct access to his dreams and sleep cycle), Cas’ bright blue eyes blink open and the corners of his mouth turn up into a small smile.
Dean snatches up his neglected beer and takes a sip, smacking his lips in approval, then leads the way out of the kitchen, the cooler wheeling along behind him.
“TWO!” Dean exclaimed, standing and pulling Castiel to his feet, his hands reaching to bury his fingers in Castiel’s hair.
But once on the road, he’d known just where their first stop had to be.
“Ah, ah!” Dean says, waggling a finger at him. “First, you’re gonna have to get some exercise. Don’t want you to fall into a food coma before we work out those wings.” Dean sets the other rabbit inside the cabin door, and moves to kneel in front of Feathers, who glances at the cabin door, then back at Dean with what can only be described as a resigned look.
Once again, all the thanks and love and cookies to my long-suffering betas,
“Wait, are you saying that all the lore surrounding thunderbirds… that was YOU?”
Dean grins after her, chuckling. “You still got it, babe.”
Shaking their paint cans, Dean goes first, spraying "DW" with his green paint. Cas moves in next to him and sprays "CW" next to Dean’s initials in blue.
Dean swallows nervously. “Well, I kinda spilled the beans about me and Cas back there…”
“So very good for me,” Cas says softly, a hitch in his voice; and Dean floats higher on the praise.
… leg placed firmly between his.
Softly, afraid of hearing the answer, “Cas… did they… did they take your wings?”
Dean nods, eyes downcast. “I don’t wanna be a puppet. I want…” He pauses and takes a deep breath, the eyes meeting Castiel’s full of determination. “I will do this —
His sleep is deep and dreamless, and when he wakes, the sun is high in the sky and the birds are singing.
there that has been getting tighter and tighter
"C'mon, let's get to that cabin,” Dean said, his smile radiant. “I think we have some news those guys are going to want to hear."
"Cas, is everything okay?" Dean asks, concerned. Is it possible Cas doesn't know how to swim? Or he's afraid of the water?
Dean nods and, dropping another kiss to his forehead, heads to the table.
Sam worked day and night, reading through the vast amount of books in the library, through all of Rowena’s notes and journals, even the Book of the Damned, to no avail. Quite often, Cas came into the library and found him asleep, snoring into one book or another, and sent him off to bed. A couple of hours later and Sam was back at it again.
“Cas, what about warding - anything going on?” Sam asked as he surveyed the grounds.
Dean thinks,
up, and this can only mean one thing.
He grins when she whistles and says, “Hundred and fifty million dollar poker tournament?”
He places a hand on Cas’ fire-warmed cheek and turns him away from the dimming horizon.
"We're such idiots." he said, pressing his forehead to Cas'.
The wing expands to full length with ease. Dean works it back and forth manually at the ulna joint, the wing action feeling smooth. Nodding in satisfaction, he releases the wing and Feathers folds it up against his body as Dean returns to kneel in front of him.
Dean can’t help himself - he outright guffaws. “No, no cyanide, why would I… I mean, we’re making a detour, stopping somewhere here in Seattle before heading south.”
Then he, too, crouches and places his crown at the edge of the fire.
When he emerged from the dream, he had no idea how much time had passed, but the Bunker remained still and quiet - Sam was still asleep. Raising his head and blinking in the dim light of the table lamp, his gaze fell on Dean’s diminutive form and he felt the stabbing pain in his heart renew. He brushed his fingers against Dean, feeling for the spark, and was comforted by the tingle against his senses.
Dean gestured to the passenger door, watching as Sam pulled out of the driveway and drove away, the four waving as they passed. “Shall we?” Cas nodded and climbed into the passenger seat. Dean sat behind the wheel, turned the ignition over and followed Sam.
Sam followed his gaze around the room and nodded in agreement. “Good plan.” Picking up the partially consumed cupcake, he hurried toward the exit of the infirmary.
At least he should be able to get some rest tonight without worrying about something killing him in his sleep.
He’s lost. Over the buzzing in his ears, he hears Cas’ soft groan.
Prompt fill for Suptober Day 13 - Ladies.
Sam huffs out a breath - frustration, confirmed, and Dean gets it. “There’s just not a whole lot of lore on angels, y’know?” He pauses suddenly, hums as an idea comes to him.
He desperately needs to hear more of
“Verbal consent, Dean.”
Cas shakes his head. “No, Dean. I can’t authorize that.” He sighs, his chin drooping. “It’s over.”
And after his return, he didn't want another minute to go by without Dean knowing it.
“Whoa… WHOA there, Dean,” Sam’s massive paw suddenly encompassed his entire back as he started to fall, voice booming too loud next to his ear, and Dean reflexively threw his hands over his ears. Sam took the hint and lowered his voice. “Dean?”
Castiel is nothing if not competitive.
Sam nods in agreement and pats the box. “This will go in the glove box of the Impala.”
for making my drivel better <3
A fingertip brushed against his hand, knocking him out of his spiraling thoughts. He looked up into the blue ocean of Cas’ eyes.
A midnight blue suit, immaculately tailored and showcasing a trim waist and muscular runner’s thighs, is accented by a slightly loosened azure blue tie. The only thing even hinting at ‘accountant’ is the tan trench coat draped across his broad shoulders and billowing around his legs, and even
Cas places a hand over Dean’s on his cheek, smiling up at him. “Dean… I’m fine.” The smile fades as his gaze drops to Dean’s arms, splattered with black ooze. “But that shirt is not.”
Besides, SHRIMP? And Salad? No thanks.
"I would greatly enjoy that, yes."
Dean waves a hand, encompassing Cas’ outfit. “The trench coat, the suit - by the way, your tie is on backward, I can help you fix that later,” he stops to force down a chuckle. “Did you dress like ‘Columbo’ on purpose or is this how incognito angels dress these days?”
He doesn’t have long to contemplate as Castiel moves back and to his side, the hand on his neck guiding him to the bed. The bottle is set on the nightstand, then Castiel reaches for a pillow, tossing it on the ground by Dean’s feet at the edge of the bed.
Cas does look at him this time. “Of course. It wouldn’t fit into the trash can.”
Prying the knife tip into the metal to carve their initials into it.

Dean is alive... sort of. Sam continues his research to return Dean to his normal size, and Cas makes an alarming discovery.

“My behavior was disrespectful. I did not even ask for consent!”
“Sorry, Sammy… but you know how I am about bacon, and then Cas was here, and well, one thing led to another, and…”
“Rest now, Ol Limlal. The Bond takes a toll.”
Dean chokes. “You… you’ve LOJACKED my Baby?” Behind him, Castiel scoffs and Dean whirls on him. “Don’t tell me. ‘Standard BMoL equipment,’” he growls, and fights down the urge to punch Castiel when his (deliciously broad —
“Got it in one, hot stuff,” Dean says, tossing the lunchmeat and cheese into the cooler and closing the lid.
Cas must have interpreted the look on his face, and frowned. “Don’t worry, Dean. There

He manages to stand, and feels the bird trembling in his arms. Heading back inside the cabin, he sets it down on the floor by the fireplace, the embers still glowing and giving off a little heat, and absently strokes the bird’s head as he reaches for his phone on the coffee table, punching at the screen and placing it against his ear.
Cas nodded as well as he could, locked in Dean's embrace.
Several hunters have gone missing, and Sam thinks he's found a connection between them. The boys head off on the case.
Clear the traps.
<3<3<3
Dean startled at the noise, subconsciously pulling his hand away and making a big show of giving Sam his full attention.
Dean woke up again when six feet of cotton-shrouded angel slid under the covers and spooned up against him, breath warm on the back of his neck and arm draped over him to stroke his chest.
“Okay, okay,” Dean acquiesced. “I’ll make you a deal. I promise I’ll rest and not push it, but you gotta get outta those clothes and into something more comfortable.” He gestured to the chest of drawers at the foot of the bed. “Get one of my t-shirts and a pair of sweats and get out of that suit.” He leveled a pleading look at him. “I’ll rest better if I know you’re more comfortable…”
Cas continues to move, whimpering and moaning against Dean’s neck; then with a deep, rumbling groan he follows Dean over the edge, come spurting hot and wet between them. His arms give out and he collapses down onto Dean, his breaths hard and ragged.
She draws herself up then, her diminutive stature giving way to the full regality of the Queen of Hell; her brow pinched thoughtfully and a manicured finger tapping her lips as her eyes fall on the monument over their shoulders. They turn to follow her gaze.
Castiel leans back against the wall, closing his eyes and taking several deep breaths to collect himself. Finally, he pushes away from the wall and goes in search of Sam.
“Hey, Cas,” he calls from behind the kitchen island. Cas swivels in his seat to face him, his eyes bright and his smile fond and warm and just for him.
Dean grins and takes his free hand. "You bet I am. Let's get this show on the road!"
“Of all my Father’s deeds, for good or ill, isn’t the Earth the most magnificent of them?” Cas asks, his voice barely above a whisper. “The most beautiful?”
But it must have done
Cas is opening
“Doesn’t look like he thinks so.”
The last thing he remembered was seeing the witch level a purple ball of light at Cas, and…
The delightful aroma of coffee and a hint of bacon wafts into Dean’s nostrils and he stirs, eyes blinking in the early morning light streaming through the window. He glances over at the other bed, finding it neatly made, as if it hadn’t been slept in at all, and no sign of Cas.
The bouncy brunette blinks, then nods, the smile returning. “Uh, great! Awesome!” She extends her hand. “I’m Brittany, and this is my girl, Gertrude,” indicating the Impala parked next to them.
Sam at least has the decency to look startled before bursting into a gale of laughter, and Castiel bitterly wonders if Sam’s soul really
“Witch,” they said in unison.
The sun was decadently high in the sky when Dean woke up again, his first site being those blue eyes again, inches away but this time in a very worried face.
"Y'all are adorable," she gushes, taking one of their hands in each of hers and squeezing.
"I'm Tonya," she says, smiling warmly up at them. "My, but you boys are tall as well as handsome!"
They had stopped for lunch at a little diner in Myers Flats the day before, when Dean realized how close they were to the giant redwoods. They had finished their meal and then spent the rest of the day driving the Avenue of the Giants, stopping at several locations to explore or take pictures; even driving through the Shrine Drive-Thru Tree (which of course, Dean had to get a picture of Baby parked inside the Tree, immediately sending it to Sam).
Dean rises, pulling Castiel up with him and into a spine-popping hug. “I don’t want to lose this,” he whispers into Castiel’s ear. Then suddenly, and much to Castiel’s surprise, Dean pushes him back, hands clasping his shoulders. “Waitaminute.” His green eyes go wide, hope and disbelief at war in them. “D-do you… do you love me too?”
“No, I dispensed with one that was useless and replaced it with one that serves our purpose.” He glances over to Lee. “Is he watching?”
Careful to not smudge the writing, he places the case back into the container, and the container back into the glove box. He slides the tape into the cassette player, smiling as the opening guitar riff of “The Immigrant Song” bursts over the car’s speakers.
“So, what are you doing here?” Dean repeats his earlier question.
“I would do so much more than that,” he breathed, leaning over to taste that smile.
Taking the hint, Castiel and Dean each lifted a glass. James leaned over and clinked his glass against theirs.
It takes Dean the few moments for his heart rate to climb down from the stratosphere before his brain realizes what just happened. Cas must draw the same conclusion at the same time, both of them shouting “The safe!” simultaneously.
"Sidetracked?" he said to the empty bunker, stared at the phone and wondered what the hell that meant.
And then he rises to his knees to crush his lips against Castiel’s, one hand tilting his head
Freshly arrived from Sioux Falls, where the American branch of the Men of Letters is headquartered, Ellen Harvelle-Singer isn’t in any mood to be trifled with, either: she leans forward and rests her arms on Sam’s desk to give as good as she’s getting.
“Here, Dean. Let’s do it here.”
“Where can we find one of these angels?” Dean asks Bobby during one of his ‘check-ins’ (or ‘Has Dean Drank Himself To Death Yet’). “Maybe we can catch one and…” Speaking of drinking, Dean pours another splash of whiskey in his glass and throws it back. ‘Y’know. Question it.”
Castiel utters a string of Enochian curses that would make Lucifer himself flinch. Nothing for it, and he has more important concerns at the moment, his attention returning to the unconscious hunter.
Castiel hears a
, and they both turn to find Rowena has vanished just as abruptly as she appeared.
This is no ordinary bird.
Castiel nods, his voice flown away with his heart, and Dean slips the ring on his finger.
Cas’ whole body began to tremble, his breath shuddering against Dean’s neck.
Several hours later, with the Impala parked off the road and hidden from view of the farmhouse below, the three surveyed the site.
Neither knew what to say first.
“Not a problem. Remove your shirt, I’ll be back shortly.” Cas dashes from the room, quickly returning with a fresh blue shirt. He stops, staring as Dean shucks the dirty shirt.
“I think that’s enough for our first day, don’t you? How about that rabbit now?”
“I can still detect a small spark of life in him,” he said, his voice still shaking.
“I think I’ll save this part for last. I’ll save it as a reward for your friend…” He pauses, then stands, releasing Dean’s balls. Dean slumps forward in the chair, nearly passing out in relief, the ropes binding him tugging against his skin.
Dean liked steak well enough, but even the apparently bottomless pit of his stomach could only handle so much.
His triage and reorganization of the figurines complete, Castiel sighed and sank down into one of the reclining chairs. Fetching Dean from his pocket, he held him again in his two hands and stared down onto his still face.
It’s all Castiel could do to keep from weeping with joy, the emotion clogging his throat.
“What?” Dean groused and pushed Sam’s finger away as he made to touch him again. Both hands barely covered his fingertip and it was eerie and annoying, and he did not like it one bit.
, melting and swirling together within Dean, and returning to pour back into himself.
“Sam? Hey, you’re not going to believe this…”
Dean blinks against the sudden brightness, and as his eyes adjust he sees Lee, slumped over in another chair, bloody and lifeless.
Dean waves a hand dismissively. “Plenty of hunters in the sea.” He strides over to Castiel, placing refrigerator-cool hands around Castiel’s neck and pressing their foreheads together. “We defeated Chuck, Cas. Let someone else handle the bit players.”
Sam raised his hands in acknowledgment. “I know, I know… believe me.” His hands fell to his sides, head drooping. “But what if it doesn’t work? I… I don’t want to get his hopes up and find out it doesn’t work.”
Dean laughs. “Yeah, no shit.” He pauses, waiting for Cas to elaborate… which, of course, he doesn’t. Dean rolls his eyes. “Okay, so if you’re not British, where’re you from?”
“I’m sensing… residual power, but no active warding.”
Still keeping his eyes on the road, Dean releases Cas' hand and reaches to stroke his cheek.
He’s in the middle of cinching his belt when a knock comes at his door. “Dean?” It’s Sam’s voice, muffled by the door. “Ellen’s on the phone. She’s heard back from the BMoL.”
Cas closes his book — the Library’s very special edition of
“Yeah, apparently it’s a ‘grand gesture’ to open the new casino. Ten million dollar buy-in with a five million re-buy, limited to ten players. Winner takes all.”
Removing his finger from his mouth with a
It has everything to do with how it makes him feel - like he could leap and soar over that endless blue. Like he could fly again.
“Hello, boys.”
The soft down of Castiel’s covert feathers brush against Dean’s arm and he cannot suppress the shiver this time, as the angel reaches out with a wing to cover him as he lies next to him in the bed. The curve of the great wing covers his shoulder, the long primaries at the wingtip gently lying over his ankles, the alula feathers gently caressing his shoulder.
“What? NO!” Dean sputtered. “Body might have shrunk but my brain didn’t!” Cas kneeled down next to the table where Sam was working, and with a parting peck to Cas’ ear, Dean jumped off onto the table.
, killing and taking the form of people in positions of power or access, but neither branch of the MoL knew much else — where the Leviathans came from, or how wide-spread their infiltration has become.

“As a matter of fact, I am.” Dean spares a glance over and winks. “Which is how I can tell you’re being completely sarcastic right now.”
to have slept this long, what with the jangling of the alarms attached to the dreamcatcher spells.
Cas must feel him tense and releases his wrists, hands running up Dean’s arms to wrap around his shoulders and pull him in tight. “Do not fret, Ol Limlal,” he whispers, lips mouthing the shell of Dean’s ear, sending shivers ricocheting down his back. “I wish to speak to you of the Bond.”
you’re arrogant and reckless.”
“... but it isn’t hard to imagine you think of potential partners as disposable playthings rather than meaningful relationships.” His head snaps back around, shaded eyes boring into him and Dean involuntary twitches. “So, as
Dean huffs and pushes past him. “Shut up.” He hears, and subsequently ignores, Cas’ snickering as he follows Dean into the lobby, where the porter is waiting by the reception desk.
“No Round Two tonight, mister. You’ve had a long day and need some rest.” When Castiel opens his mouth to argue, Dean presses a finger against it. “Yeah, yeah, I know, you got a battery jump from my soul. Still…” Dean drops to press another languorous kiss on his lips before dropping to Castiel’s side and pulling him close. “We have all the time in the world now.”
"Oh my, so you're brand-spankin’ new! Congratulations!"
She shrugs. “Dean, he’s an ex-angel, they’re very literal creatures. He probably thinks it’s a done deal.” Then, a chuckle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he thinks you’re married already.”
Dean reaches across the table and presses a warm palm against his cheek. “Heya, sweetheart.” His thumb strokes a path down Castiel’s cheekbone and he leans into it, his eyes closing to relish the touch.
Cas reaches up to cover Dean’s hand with his own… then thrusts it away, turning to leave. “I’m sorry.”
He remembered back to the werewolf, the wendigo, and the ghosts - silver to the heart, fire, salt rounds and iron.
Oh shit.
Of course, Cas doesn’t have his wings anymore — not even the tattered, burned remnants of them — and Dean is very much aware of how much Cas misses them. But it has never been as obvious as it is right now and Dean’s heart aches for him.
It’s very hard to deny, the warmth of the water and Dean’s proximity chasing away his own shivering. He ducks to allow the water to run over his head, warming him fully, before spinning Dean carefully around and urging his head under the water as well.
“Married. Let’s get married here.”
“I can’t believe you hotwired MY BABY!”
Cas’ palm pulls away from his forehead. Dean’s eyes flutter open to see Cas hovering over him, hand still on his chest, tears streaming down his face but brightened by the most incredible, beatific smile. In another heartbeat, Cas’ lips are on his.
“Who are you?” Dean manages to croak.
Castiel returns Dean’s hug, relishing the ability to finally do so without reservation. “Not stupid, Dean. Just stubborn.”
Dean sighs. For a minute there, it seemed like maybe Cas would relax, maybe pull out the stick the Brits had wedged so firmly in his ass.
“Cas… could you… stay with me? For just a little bit?”
Dean leans over to give him a thorough kissing, then rests his forehead against Cas’.
Cas’ breath caught at the admission, and as Dean released his finger and rolled over again, Cas whispered to his sleeping back, “As do I, Dean. Always and forever.”
, Dean thinks, Sam’s eyes fall to Dean’s untouched bottle, then over to see Dean’s hands buried in the bowl. He winces.
Castiel is certain he’s not the first world-weary visitor to occupy a barstool at this establishment. Victoria Harbor was a popular tourist destination, and the bar was positioned in an area excellent for viewing the harbor’s vaunted New Year’s fireworks display.
A warm palm brushes sand from his shoulders, and is quickly followed by a loud squelching sound before ice-cold liquid squirts onto his back.
Dean hums along to the song playing on the radio -
Cas is keeping his voice carefully neutral, projecting calm - but Dean knows better.
And there it is again — the twitch, the finger press. “One hundred thousand.”
“What was that again, Dean? The pain must be addling your brain.” Dick grins wide and feral. “The only one dying here tonight is
for the sight in front of him.
One of the things he noticed during their stops on the way out here: one of the very few things Cas consistently consumed was toast with honey, and he always put honey in his tea. Living in London as he did, Dean thought maybe the crumpets would provide a taste of home.
So all through the night, he lay there, Dean’s warmth pressed against his body, his soft snores against his neck, and he argued with himself.
“I assume they didn’t supply you with any in federal lockup.”
With that, he starts playing another piece, one that in only a few notes makes Cas roll his eyes and walk away. For this one, Balthazar’s hands jump around nimbly, hitting only a few keys at a time, at a quicker tempo than before, but it’s not nearly as impressive-seeming to Dean as the dramatic chords of the previous piece had been—at least it isn’t, until Balthazar’s right hand is jumping a wide distance back and forth, then jumping even farther, passing over almost a third of the keys in between each quick note. Dean doesn’t know much about piano playing, but he’s seen pianos played before, and as he watches he begins to understand. This wasn’t the sort of piece, like the previous one, that one played for emotional impact. Nor was it the sort of thing like Cas had played, that made for an enjoyable ambiance. This wasn’t the sort of piece people liked to
Cas presses, though he must know; Cas isn’t stupid.
“Is that difficult to say?” Off script again. He’s curious.
“You wanted me inside of you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You want this?” he murmurs again, as if Dean hasn’t begged enough.
“What?”
“—No, darlin’. We got lucky, is what happened.”
“There’ll be something.”
“You remember me, Jack?” Dean asks. “I’m a friend of your daddy’s.”
The second week, travel slowly starts to get harder again, and Dean begins to realize that it’s due to a slight uphill climb. The land becomes pockmarked with little hills and mesas, and seemingly overnight there are little round bushes everywhere. They have a windy day, and Dean and Baby delight in running around and through the tumbleweeds together, watching a dust devil kick up and toss the dry plants high into the sky. Two days from Santa Fe, he can swear he sees mountains on the horizon, and one day out he for sure can, big and green and impossibly huge. Dean’s seen pictures, of course, but after spending his whole life in a place flatter than a train track, it doesn’t seem right, for the ground to rise up like that, cutting a shape into the horizon like it has a right to the sky.
