That final question was enough to turn himself away from his inner thoughts and into the reality of his situation once again. His hand had ceased its light strokes in favour of something more rapid, firm, that managed to pull groan after groan from the very depths of him. Every inch of him could have been on fire for all he cared and he would not have noticed. the only thing that seemed to matter in that moment was the delicious way his hand glided up and down his length, and how it incited a rather pleasing burn he gained from his shoulder at every stroke to where he felt urged to place his hand on his marks once again.
He had just tucked the book under his arm and swam out of his cave when he was greeted with possibly the most displeasing sight of the day, Mycroft.
“You’ve hurt yourself really badly, Sherlock. We’re going to take you to the hospital to see how serious the damage is, okay?” He hardly noticed that his hand moved to rest on top of Sherlock’s, the stark difference in warmth between their skin seemed to urge John to hold it.
Finally- No RPF or rape, those are some of my only rules.
So i know I said that last week's chapter a kind of short, so I've seemed to compensate by making this one almost 3,000 words. In reality, this took me weeks to write but we won't talk about that ;)
The reason I chose this is due to the idea in this universe that merfolk are not exactly the most "emotional" species, so to them they give one another the mark to mate and it will fade after a few days. Yet with these two, it is different as they are able to develop feelings over time, and so the marks develop with them.
They had just finished up at a crime scene, Sherlock went off as he usually did and five minutes before they were to leave, he began to shake frantically. John at first assumed he was cold and pushed him into the closest cab they could find to head back home.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
put something on? I didn’t want to have this argument with my eyes covered.”
John soon raised his head from his journal when he heard the already familiar sound of men finishing their shift and heading for dinner. John contemplated not going and avoiding the awkward introduction of him like last night, but ultimately decided he should ask how Sherlock’s hand was healing.
The temptation to slap his hand away was beginning to sound extremely pleasant before he felt fingers at the back of his neck tighten and pull him closer to his face.
“I… I felt like I could.. I thought I could without you and I just… I don’t know what happened… Ugh, I sound so stupid.”
He turned back to look towards the guard with the bloody finger. Mycroft’s men wouldn’t hold him much longer; despite his injuries, he maintained enough strength to fight them off. The question was, who would he aim for? It was the obvious answer that Sherlock would fall to face the barrel of his pistol, yet deranged men had a tendency to aim at the first thing they saw as a threat; John then was in his line of sight.
John began to raise his pistol,
They barely spoke a word, only a gentle motion of Sherlock’s head towards his cabin as his hand moved into John’s. He smiled as he received a nod in return, the two of them silently made their way to Sherlock’s cabin to avoid the lively men on the other side of the ship. Only letting out a breath they both did not know they were holding when they were inside the safety of the Captain’s quarters.
He did not stop walking.
“I would if you would explain why, you are angry at me!”
“I… I really didn’t know, John. You always said you weren’t interested in a relationship with men, so I just left it alone.”
The smile that he received in return was almost worth the pain that seemed to spread through every limb he had, and he did his best to return the gesture.
“Watson, I would suggest that you keep your voice down. I am willing to offer you a good sum of money and a residence in a prominent part of London, should you take my offer.”
“What?! You didn’t think to tell us that before we started?”
Either way, do let me know what you thought!
Sherlock slowly became aware of the painfully bright lights that hovered above him as he was moved throughout the corridor on a gurney. The attempts to move in his fingers proved to be little and weak, his entire body felt just the same.
His mind wandered so far that he only faintly heard the sound of the dinner bell; it gradually pulled him from his thoughts and caused him to sit up. He made the effort to quickly fix himself before he walked out of the room, blinking back the light in his eyes to see the men making their way to the kitchen. He hesitantly made his way in line, attempting to avoid the men’s stares.
The trek back to John’s room was a continuous and hesitant one that caused him to linger at the bottom of the stairs for some time. The bravery to continue only came when he heard John call for him upstairs.
“Would you like to have it?”
And I guess I did.” -s.b
“… It’s you, John.”
“I’m not a child Lestrade, I wake whenever I please.”
Lestrade made quick use of the telescope before he gave Sherlock a silent nod and made his way down the crew’s cabin.
“Damn it…”
“John?”
“Is everything alright?”
“My, whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?”
Much like most of his days on a naval voyage, John woke up long before anyone else. He, as usual, took this opportunity to dress and make his way up to his station without having to deal with the rush of men around him in the morning. He made his way up on deck with only a few hiccups, mainly tripping over a man who had decided to lie in the aisle, and began to walk towards the new “infirmary”, before his attention was caught by the flicker of light from underneath the door of the room that was too noticeable to miss with the lack of early morning light.
John watched as they tumbled down the side of the building while Sherlock pushed the man away from him, he had to look away as they neared the ground and nearly went to tears when he heard two separate thuds hit the ground.
The slight prickle was unnatural for him, possibly even worrying, yet he could not help the instinct that caused him to run his fingers over the soft skin. It made a slight smile grow on his face, even if he was not entirely sure why he had such a reaction.
While that would have been an unusually pleasant experience to see a familiar face in the wilderness of London, now was not the best of times to see the man.
“Sherlock! Sherlock can you hear me? Oh my God, please wake up…”
Sherlock straightened himself slightly and fiddled with the pages of his book. “I don’t have to explain myself to you.”
The metallic tang of blood in his mouth rushed to filled his senses as the guard cried out and attempted to pull his finger from his mouth. Sherlock quickly released his grip on them and kicked him away, unintentionally into the stone wall where he hit his head and fell to the floor.
Sherlock could hear the growl that grew in his brother’s throat at his complete lack of respect towards him, it wasn’t anything new, but one would think he would at least give him the dignity to explain his completely ‘rash’ decision.
“Yes Sherlock?”
Mycroft did not move, and instead only softened his expression in an attempt to appeal to his younger brother.
“Nothing at all, in fact I was just leaving.”
“Alright men, you heard the captain. Man your stations!”
“I did not know, Watson. I merely observed.”
“…John, I’m sorry… I know you were just trying to help and I acted out…”
“John! Come help me with the groceries.”
He didn’t know what he thought in that moment, but it was better than what was his fate would be if he did nothing; He looked him straight in the eyes, and saw nothing but emptiness returned in that gaze. He then got ahold of the man’s shirt and tipped them over the edge.
“Right, what are ya two havin?”
He glanced up from his phone for a moment as he heard an ambulance drive past his house, the noise was surely going to wake up Rosie soon.
Mycroft found himself ensconced within the small bubble they had managed to create for themselves to place a blanket over Sherlock’s twitching, jolting tail that did not enjoy the new layer that kept the sweltering heat closer to him.
His effort was only returned with a full laugh and another pat to his arm.
” Sherlock and John arguing and it escalates to smut. But with a cute, soft morning scene.
John tugged his arm away from Lestrade and swiftly undid the buttons of his waistcoat as he tossed it aside. “It’s difficult to explain, we’ll be back in a moment, just stay there.”
“It’s the afternoon, now wake yourself up and come help me put stuff away.”
He only received a hum as Sherlock quickly turned his attention to his phone. John didn’t mind, Sherlock never seemed up for much conversation after he’d just woken up. John simply followed his example and sat down in his chair, his eyes wandered off to today’s newspaper and they both sat silently in their sitting room. John did his best to focus on his own activities, and to mind his own business, but it was difficult to focus as he watched Sherlock’s tail complete so many activities on its own without Sherlock moving so much as a muscle.
The two received a smile in return of confirmation of the other and swiftly made their way to each other. Their arms enveloped one another in a joyous reunion after so many years, neither one could help the way they embraced and caused them to almost spiral out of position as bubbles were created and floated away around the two.
The unsettling quiet that lingered in the air between them was enough to drive anyone mad, and Mycroft was the only one that made it worse by holding their gaze, as if he was pondering a question that was difficult for even him to answer.
“Ah Watson, how was your first day as our new surgeon?”
“If I’m not mistaken, this is the part in the myth when the beautiful merman lures their victim to the water to drown them.”
“Oh… well you’re not like that.”
“Hungry. I thought I might order us something to pass the time.”
Hopefully I could do justice to your idea, it truly was an interesting concept and I hope I accomplished fleshing it out
John couldn’t help but admire the gentle curve of the man’s back as he leaned over the countertop, the pleasant elegance in the way his tail seemed to trail the eye down was a little too bold for John and he turned his attention back to setting down his stuff.
He swiftly averted his gaze from him and attempted to calm the wash of red that had overtaken his face. The man didn’t seem to be in immediate danger, so he took a moment to collect himself before he turned back to him, and he was gone.
John allowed a slight rotation of his shoulder as he attempted to calm his voice enough to speak. “I’ve just been invalided from Afghanistan.”
You will never be unloved by me
“Kid, that wasn’t in the deal.”
John ran his fingers over the salt-stained cover and turned to the first page that read
“How you knew I was a Captain before I began my work on naval voyages?”
Sherlock felt he understood too well what he meant, that the bruising of his fingerprints was a better replacement than the rough embrace of a rope chord. The sad attempt at seducing was noted, and not enjoyed.
“I won’t hear of it Sherlock. you want me to hit you, you also have to put up with me helping you.”
He let his mind wander again to those ice blue eyes that seemed to stare through him even when he gave his full attention to John. The gaze that seemed to pin him in place and study every inch of him fervently as though he was only thing in existence that mattered to this mysterious and elegant creature.
John let out a pained groan as he let his body fall from using the weight of his arms to hold himself up. The struggle to decide whether he wanted to hold Sherlock’s head down to keep him from moving away was almost overpowering before Sherlock finally gave him what he wanted and took him all the way down to the base.
“I um… I guess it’s just been due to us being so close for the last few years and… It just kind of grew into something more. I honestly thought you knew; I was horribly obvious about it…”
“PIRATES!”
John looked up from the note with tears nearly falling from his eyes to Lestrade, as he began to speak to the crew once again.
He felt the blood gush and run down his arm before the pain made its way through his nerves and to his head. The stab of metal shocked his system and threw him off balance, as a haze took over his vision.
“Oh, these are lovely… um, what are they?”
Shivers ran through John as he held Sherlock possibly closer than possible, his head naturally moved to Sherlock’s own neck and buried itself there while his hand wandered its way up to the rave curls that brushed against his cheek, and gently ran through to undo all the small knots.
The store was quiet for moment as the clerk simply stared at him. A small smile grew on his face before he picked up the bracelet and took it to the back.
“John, I need you to hit me right now, don’t argue with me.”
They made their trek upstairs and Sherlock could have easily grabbed the ice but instead he was pushed into a kitchen chair while John got it.
He laid still on the floor for a long while, only relieved by the thundering sound of his crew moving up the stairs and gather on deck in front of him, to which they promptly fell to the floor at the sight of their captain doing the same.
I actually had to trim the original summary down so what you originally said at the end is hilariously ringing true to life, so if any other readers would like to know the full context, they'll be able to find it in the comments in chapter 1.
They stopped swimming around 10 meters from their meeting spot, the clearer water allowed for a better view of the merman as he floated within his sight. The tender brush of his nose against his cheek drew a gentle smile from him as he returned the action, a silent comfort between the two to remind one another that they were there. No matter the darkness and isolation of the ocean that surrounded them from every angle, they knew they held each other at less than an arm’s length away.
“John, I may not participate in the belief that there’s some higher deity waiting for all of us once we die, but I know enough to know that you were not
“I don’t… I don’t know Greg.. He fell really far. I’m concerned that he may have done serious damage to his spinal cord, but they’d need to do scan for that when they get him to the hospital…”
His iron grip locked onto Mycroft’s wrist before he even had the chance to attempt the complex process of undoing his collar to lower his shirt.
John watched as Sherlock picked up the small tea sandwich and stared at it with intense curiosity. He could not help but let out a gentle chuckle as he picked up his own sandwich.
“I would be grateful for it.” He gave him another smile as they began their way down the pier.
“Gentlemen, I have to congratulate you on a bountiful plunder of another of the king’s ships! I think this calls for a clap of thunder to celebrate the bounty and the arrival of our new doctor, John Watson.” There was a loud cheer and the clinking of glasses, along with the expected glances over to the newest member of the crew, a fact John didn’t appreciate but gave them a friendly enough wave anyway.
Before either John or Mycroft knew what had happened, the table between them was kicked away from beneath their arms and the taller of the two was slammed against the mahogany walls with his arm twisted between his shoulder blades. the walls seemingly shook at such a rough blow against it and caused most of the pub to look to them.
“Well, never mind that now. I am happy you are here.” Sherlock was glad of that, at least he was a decent distraction from the pain in his leg long enough for him not to worry about it for too long.
Sherlock swiftly made his away through the exit he had so desperately tried to push Victor through and began to swim away, leaving Victor to make his way out of the cave and watch Sherlock possibly swim faster than he ever had in his life.
“Well, it just so happens that I lost the thing that encourages me to stay in bed due to private writings. Besides, I thought I might as well see what actually does bring my breakfast up every morning.”
“We both know that isn’t true, John. We cannot go on just meeting every day.”
“Sherlock there’s nothing stupid about this. I was only a phone call away, why didn’t you at least try to text me?”
The kind you could get lost in
A crawling feeling ran up the back of John’s neck caused him to turned back to the edge of the port to see if anyone was staring at him. He saw no one, and turned his attention to water, where he saw the reflection of pale arms settled in the water with dark curls that wavered against the deep.
“Sorry?”
All too quickly, and much to John’s tremor, he felt the pace of his hand on his cock hasten and drove him to his swift end that approached with full force. The last metaphor he thought of as being set on fire seemed to come to pass when just one particular touch against his member easily set him alight.
“Soul meets soul on lover’s lips” -Percy Shelley
John only received a smile for his concern, and the man pulled his head above the water reveal his wiry frame that still carried tone and definition in his limbs and- Oh good god he was not wearing a shirt.
Important- If anyone has contacted me for a request or just some comment that you left on this story around June 4th, do let me know. I must say this as my inbox told me that a had a message, but when I opened it, there was no new message there. I do not if it was just a glitch or if I truly did miss a message. If you did send me a message on June 4th or after that and I didn't answer please try to message me about this.  If I still don't answer then we have a more serious problem. I also say this due to the lack of submissions that i've received, due to the fact that I can't seem to tell whether or not if someone messages me.
“…John?...”
John was pulled away from his writing when gentle fingers ran through his hair, and the light brush of lips met his jaw.
“Have… Have you done this before?”
A genuine smile grew on the captain’s face at his words as he reached his hand out to shake John’s. He took it somewhat hesitantly, feeling the long yet warm fingers wrap around his hand and calm his nerves at the gentle touch he received. “Wonderful, I can arrange for this to be your infirmary as it is spacious enough for much of the medicine and tools we’ve accumulated. Dinner should be soon so you will meet more of my men then; afterwards I’ll have my first mate show you your bunk.”
“…Fine…”
“Yes, you want to retire and forget your military days. But that… I have to ask you to put that aside just this once and do this for Sherlock.” He held out the sword to him, his eyes attempting to meet John’s and implore him to hear him out.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>>>
His effort was only returned with a full laugh and another pat to his arm.
He was too distracted by the possibility of a large fish that circled underneath him, that he hardly noticed the man that suddenly appeared beneath the dock, and clung to the pole as he stared up to John.
Lestrade didn’t need anything else, as by the time John looked away from checking on Sherlock to make sure his vitals were still stable, he could already hear the sirens in the distance.
He didn’t linger on it for long though, as with a sweep of his coat he turned back to his men while his words slipped from his tongue with practiced ease. “You know what to do.”
“Sherlock!”
The only reason Sherlock had offered to get the groceries was due to the strange way John acted that morning; Over breakfast, there was hardly a word exchanged between them while John cooked. That was relatively normal, except when he placed the plates down and began eating, Sherlock looked up often to find John looking at him with a saddened expression that he never dropped until Sherlock grew uncomfortable enough to offer to get groceries, just to see John smile a little.
He then took a running start and jumped into the water.
“Hmm, I believe I have a better idea. I would still like to eat…”
He glanced over when Mycroft let out a sigh and stood up from the dock, a light touch to Sherlock’s shoulder signaled he was leaving, and he had hardly moved ten steps away from Sherlock when he turned back to him.
They turned to see the same guard from Sherlock’s cell, a complete stranger to the other two yet he still held the same dangerous air about him even with half his finger bleeding and a bump on the back of his head.
John quickly shut the door after that, and made his way back to his desk to catch his breath. The day had barely started, and he’d felt he’d had the wind knocked out of him. He let out a small groan as he pressed his palms into his eyes, trying to clear his head of this excruciating conversation.
Strangely, Sherlock never made mention to the fact that he would also drown if he remained underwater for more than two minutes, but at this point his reality was so muddled after the events of the last few days, he couldn’t bother to say something.
The light tingling he had felt for the last few days seemed to intensify to a distinctive level that spread throughout every inch of him, with its epicenter emblazoned within each toothmark on his neck.
John glanced over his shoulder as the man never even turned his gaze down to look him in the eyes, yet the only other one in the store was the young boy at the counter, so he must have been speaking to him, however rude he was while doing so.
Dr. John Watson could only a stand afar from the sickeningly sweet merriment as he hobbled along the boardwalk to avoid the unstable sand beneath his cane. He would have enjoyed the merciful spray of water against his face, yet he had to contend with the salty smell of the sea from where he stood.
He looked back up to Sherlock when his grip didn’t loosen and placed a gentle hand on his, then he finally felt him let go to instead hold his hand.
With a quick movement and another of those damned smiles, he was gone. It was now John’s turn to fall weak at the knees, and he certainly did. He wondered how he’d managed to make it back to his chair at all when he found himself sitting in it, contemplating how the hell the man knew of his previous military position. He must have been truly going mad after all.
It was nearing 10 pm when he drew his tail up to rest underneath his chin and wrapped his arms around himself, as his mind began to run rampant. Had he done something yesterday that caused John not to come? Had he gotten sick from swimming that night? What if giving him a mark was too much for him and he didn’t want to see him again? A sudden crippling feeling began to take over that he had never felt before, a sinking emotion that could only be described as the complete loss of hope.
A slight smile grew on Sherlock’s face as he took a step closer to John. The sudden warmth of a body next to him made him instinctively take a step backwards before he was stopped by the wall opposite of the bathroom.
That feeling in the pit of his stomach returned as Mycroft’s previous touch against his shoulder seemed to only intensify this worry that he had since this morning. This icy chill washed over him at the complete lack of emotion his brother gave when he spoke of John, the pain began to move up towards his chest as his tail curled up into himself again.
One day, when he comes home, John notices he's not using his tail as much as he usually does and he's just holding it still and he realizes he's broken it and then comes all the comforting him and doting on him like a mother hen and then Sherlock finally lets John do whatever he wants to bring his tail back to working order and then there's a mentions-of-smut part which wasn't explicit and then the post-sex cuddling.
“Hm? Oh, it’s John Watson. It’s a little plain compared to yours.”
A small smirk grew on his face as he made his way back to John and cleared his throat and watched John lower his hands. He watched as John stared a him for another moment before he covered his eyes again.
Sherlock quickly opened the door to his office and let Mycroft inside, he took one last glance back to his men, not able to find John through the crown before he closed the door behind him.
He was set down near the side of the ship as Greg joined his side once again. A telescope was quickly pressed into his palms as the crew awaited his instructions. “Oh... alright.”
“I know, John. I know."
“Sherlock, I get it. You don’t believe in this and that’s fine, I just pray sometimes when I’m worried about someone.”
He let out a relieved sigh once he had reached his room and shut the door behind him. The slosh of water that had found its way into his shoes drew a grimace on his features, and he began to make quick work of every item of clothing that clung to him with an unbearable contact.
Sherlock quickly shook his head and tucked his head against his chest as if he was a small child. The reaction only reminded him of how Sherlock reacted to walking outside in the cold without his Jacket.
If that wasn’t enough to contemplate, the fact that while many other’s tails are controlled subconsciously, while Sherlock learned how to control it for his own unnecessary use, simply because he could.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
He was greeted with a smiling face, a bandaged hand waving to him as he sat down next to the captain. the significant difference in their posture being much more obvious now that they sat nearly shoulder to shoulder.
The touch of his cold hand against his warm skin sent another nip of chill up through John’s spine, the feeling only intensified as Sherlock’s hand slipped beneath his collar to now brush his digits over the uneven area.
“…You’re um… You’re really sure about this?”
“What?” All the air was shoved from his chest as he turned to watch his brother leave. The pain in his throat moved into his eyes, a burning he had never experienced before welled throughout his vision until it felt as though the sea had erupted from his sockets.
John watched as Sherlock picked up the small tea sandwich and stared at it with an intense inquisitiveness. He could not help but let out a gentle chuckle as he picked up one for himself.
“I don’t have much that I’d like to keep, just my books…”
Now that he thought about it, John had been acting very strange around him. He never could place the exact time when it started, but all of a sudden John was… sweeter around him? He didn’t complain as much as he used to when Sherlock did his experiments in the kitchen, he hardly made a sarcastic comment towards overlooking a slightly insignificant detail during a case. Worst of all, whenever Sherlock went on his bouts of boredom, he hardly made a fuss about it and instead pulled out his phone to ask Lestrade if they had anything.
got around the corner when he was pulled away from where he had dug his nails into the brick.
“Sherlock, you know you always can go back to Baker Street.”
“Sherlock!”
John couldn’t help his smile as he scooted closer to the edge, his shoes were swiftly removed and set beside him. His socks were helplessly soaked through even with Sherlock attempting to cover him.
John was too tired for this right now. He could not put up with some petty silent treatment that Sherlock thought was necessary at this time of night.
His eyes shot up from the letter and he swiftly moved to unlock the door, to which he was greeted to the sight of two men stood on either side of the doorway, who gripped the doorknob when he opened it too quickly.
The supple touch of his lips against John’s was enough to leave John boneless, it led him to lean into their silk like texture that seemed to meld the two of them together and made John never want to leave.
“Are you absolutely certain about this?”
They both sat quietly for a while as Sherlock continued to switch between cotton pads, both ignored the stinging to the wound that was caused by disinfectant, And Sherlock soon pulled out a small bandage to cover it for now.
Sherlock’s pale blue eyes locked with the man’s cold, dark ones and he knew in that moment he was meant to be dropped. Whether he would let go of his fingers before he did, or it he would break them off by holding them down before the fall was a question he didn’t know the answer to.
Victor just had to snort at that, it was quite unusual for merfolk to have any type of facial hair and it often caused many snide jokes towards humans for their centuries of strange evolutions just of the growth of unnecessary hair on their face.
John gently put his arms around him, and relished the fantastic feeling of waking up in a world without any Moriartys on the loose.
Sherlock put down the paper coffee cup on the interview table so he wouldn’t squeeze it to a pulp out of sheer frustration at the memory, and forced another display of distress onto his face. “We both loved her very much, Sally. She was… like a sister-in-law to me.”
Not long after, they were making love again under the warm blankets, as rain poured down in large streams over the windows.
John had to look twice.
The third Ophelia had a similar build to Eurus, but was definitely not confident enough. Or was that actually part of the act?
With his other hand, Sherlock held John’s cock, stroking it gently and in the same slow rhythm he moved his finger. Every time he pushed in, he pushed a tiny bit further, until eventually, millimetre by millimetre, his finger was all the way inside.
And she didn’t even know who had killed her and why. Just that
Rinse brush. Rinse it all away.
“Oh, and Doctor Watson, of course,” Smith added, flatly.
out of reach, right under his nose the whole time, where Sherlock could theoretically walk up to him and touch him any moment he chose to. But an invisible veil had been draped between them, preventing either of them from doing so.
John looked at him in mock wonder, before exclaiming, “That’s it! I know just the right inscription for our rings.” He looked dangerously pleased with himself, Sherlock thought.
Then nothing.
“He’s publicly accused Mr Smith of being a serial killer.”
“John...”
He clumsily took the note from her and studied the paper, without looking at the words scribbled onto it just yet. (Those weren’t always the most interesting.)
Or perhaps, in fact, it had started long before that. As funny and as fascinatingly different as her brother had been, living with him had always been… difficult.
Only then did he realise,
John let out a moan, admitting defeat.
The lady, who was supposedly Sherlock’s mother (and a very different type of mother than she’d imagined, at that), embraced the younger woman in an affectionate hug and then put her arms around Molly as well. When Mr Holmes appeared behind her, a similar ritual followed.
“Oh, no, no. I-I-I met him before that.”
“Come here,” John coaxed. “Let me make you forget all that is wrong and ridiculous in this world.” And he pulled Sherlock close to him, touching his nose to Sherlock’s, while cupping his arse with one hand and one of his fake breasts with the other, determined to take advantage of their disguise one last time.
He looked again at Sherlock’s face: his perfect cheekbones, which were now slightly sharper than usual, his dark curls plastered greasily against his pillow. At his violinist hands lying limply at his sides.
When she stepped inside, he smiled at her in an attempt to hide his emotions, even though he knew it was futile.
What in the devil’s name was the woman talking about?
“Yes. This. Is. Amazing,” Sherlock stammered.
“Sherlock, I
And it helped, God, it really did. John hadn’t known he was so susceptible to these kinds of affectionate gestures himself.
Sherlock snorted. “And you still think the French teacher did it, in that case? You actually think he first left the building to enter one of the boys’ rooms on the first floor
John raised his hands again, definitely panicking now. Still, he stood nailed to the spot.
(She didn’t.)
From a distance, he heard John assure the earl that they would let him know as soon as they found any clue at all. A moment later, John nudged his elbow. “Sherlock, the DI appointed this sergeant to fill us in on the facts.” Probably so as to minimise the effect of other officers getting annoyed at our asking questions, Sherlock thought. Efficient enough, though.
Of course, Janine had tried her hand at fanfiction quite a lot when she’d been much younger, so she had some experience putting fictional characters through tough times. Thinking back to it now, she felt a pang of nostalgia at those good old days. She’d absolutely
“Jimmy! Don’t forget to avoid Kingsland Road,” the paramedic hovering around John called to the driver.
And disappeared properly, because the cordon of officers outside had not been able to catch him.
And then another text.
“And why would she be here?” Smith asked, undisturbed.
“Amy? Nah, she’s alright. Turns to ice when you try to flirt with her, though. I wouldn’t recommend it.”
(Usually, that would have meant fun; not so much this time, though.)
Strange, how this Faith woman reminded him of John a little. Well, maybe anyone might remind him of John, because he was all Sherlock thought about, really, when he wasn’t actively trying not to think about him (and even then).
“I’m here, John, and I’m never leaving.”
want to be with them forever,
He cleared his throat, resting his fingers lightly on the corner of the kitchen table.
Whitefoot looking at him from other side of room. Next moment upon his lap, purring.
“No, it’s fine,” Sherlock managed. Thankfully, he’d had himself tested only a couple of months ago to eliminate any kind of contagion through needles that might have taken place when he’d been too doped to care during the foolish exercise he had undertaken last summer.
John then very carefully pressed the softest of kisses to the corner of Sherlock’s lips. “God, I love you Sherlock,” he whispered, letting go. “But I never thought you could love me back.”
If he tried, really tried, from now on not to act annoyed at Mycroft, would Mycroft automatically stop being annoying, he wondered?
he had. But in the end it hadn’t mattered how or when he said it. Just that he had.
John was wondering whether she was still in love with Sherlock, and felt a little sorry for having stolen her love interest, even if there had never been and never would be any chance of Sherlock reciprocating her feelings. From her open posture, he seemed to observe that she was genuinely happy for him and Sherlock for having ended up together, but one never knew what went on inside other people’s heads and hearts. John liked Molly, and wished she could be as happy as he now was.
“I think I have, yes,” Sherlock said, pensively. “It’s rather impressive how children are programmed to copy their parents’ behaviour, in so many ways, and how they automatically approach the world in the same way
John smiled and nodded, secretly a little proud, even though they probably said the exact same thing about every other baby they encountered.
Sherlock shook his head.
For a few months, last autumn, her wish had been fulfilled. When John Watson had wanted nothing to do with Rose anymore, as she had been so stupid as to shoot his friend, Eurus and Rose had actually started seeing each other again.
“John?”
was the name of the conwoman they were looking for, then – assuming her first name was real. Not that knowing her name would really make it any easier to track her down, probably, but it was a nice extra.
They looked at each other.
It was a Monday morning when the idea suddenly occurred to him, in between patients at the surgery. He was eliminating a backlog filling out forms and absent-mindedly lifted his coffee to his mouth, when the thought presented itself.
And he wondered, time after time, why sign language wasn’t part of the standard primary school curriculum, with it having such a vast array of practical use. Maybe he should persuade Mycroft to pull a few strings some day.
He’d taken his last hit in the toilet half an hour ago. After all this, once he had secured a place in one of the hospital beds, it would be time to detox, of course. The mere thought sent a chill down his spine. He knew he was in deep. But a man had got to do what a man had got to do. For Faith. And for her father’s victims.
And to be fair, he had been under considerable influence of narcotics at the time.
“It’s not my place to say,” Sherlock said softly. “But... it was just texting.” He’d not often seen John this emotional.
But Sherlock had one more plan up his sleeve to even further increase the chance of successfully getting rid of Jack, which was, after all, Violet’s primary concern.
Get water.
When she saw his judgemental frown, she added, “Yes, I’ve already seen the prison doctor and yes, I’m getting all the medical attention I need, you numpty. Now tell me, what has little Rosie been up to, these past days?”
“Rose, dear, would you do something for me?” Jim had asked, shortly before his catastrophic death, with his worried puppy dog eyes that betrayed the importance of what he was about to say (and that it wasn’t a request at all but an urgent command).
Suddenly, the lump in John’s throat had taken on an entirely different nature. He managed a wet smile as he huffed out an awed, melodious, “Oh
She nodded at the package as if to congratulate it on its newly acquired territory.
* * * * *
He should have just stuck to heroin, which at least didn’t alter reality.
“Unequivocally, yeah.”
“No,” John said with resolve. “In that case, I want
“Alright,” Greg said, tearing a page out of his notebook, even though the witness recording was still running. “Tell me everything you know.”
“No you’re not. Come here,” John smiled tentatively, gently reaching with his hands for Sherlock’s face and guiding it closer to his own.
* * * * *
Sherlock looked intently at Mycroft to see if he was somehow joking.
all of a sudden. A very uncommon state for Mycroft to be in, or rather, for him to allow to show.
Something of a worried frown appeared on Sherlock’s face. John could see him mentally heading off in completely the wrong direction in his effort to deduce what Violet wanted to tell him, and smiled.
“There is no case. I can tell you exactly who this was. Her name is Eurus Moriarty. Jim Moriarty’s sister. Well, if that is actually their real surname. Probably not. Anyway, you know who I mean. See? Solved.”
“John, I’ve lied to you.” Sherlock’s gaze fluttered from John’s knees up to his face and back again. “That one time when you asked me if I’d ever bottomed with anyone before and I said no, I lied. And then I lied about it again two weeks ago when I claimed I’d never had any sort of sex with anyone else, ever. It’s just that… I was fourteen, and… my geography teacher… I used to really like him… looked up to him, in fact, and I used to help him out sometimes with experiments, you know, in the storeroom... never once realising...” He swallowed and looked down again, focusing on his own hands now.
A misty smile came over John’s face when he looked at Sherlock feeding his daughter.
John didn’t know what to say, so he just raked a hand through his hair and smiled a ridiculous amount. Greg handed him a knife and Mrs Hudson put a stack of plates in front of him that the man behind the counter had handed her. Rosie cooed happily at the festivities from her high chair.
They both kept smiling all the way back to Baker Street, where Sherrinford was staying another night.
He wondered if the girl would be alright.
“This is just incredible,” John wheezed, catching his breath again.
“Why not?”
“If we don’t get her to hospital
bloody got together!” And then, slightly exasperated, “To be honest, I’d almost given up hope of ever seeing the bloody day, I gotta tell you.”
“They presented ’em to me. There was a ceremony. You can watch that on YouTube.”
John Watson and Sherlock Holmes were walking down the Rue de Rivoli, towards one of the world’s most renowned art museums, The Louvre, in Paris.
guys been, lately? Fate has been so tough on you two this year! But you both look really well, after all that you’ve been through.”
Although John could understand Sherlock being upset, his reaction was definitely a bit not good, with Marcus having passed away not two months ago, and of course him having been married to someone else to begin with. “Sherlock,” he said, in a low voice.
Sherlock sat up.
The horrible realisation then dawned on John that all the people who had been ‘talking’ all this time would now righteously gloat about having been right from the beginning. But then again, it was a small price to pay for what they had now. On top of which, it was actually quite funny, in spite of the bitter edge of irony that everybody had seen what they had both failed to acknowledge all those years.
That did make John snigger.
“Indeed.” Sherlock looked at his watch. “You have – I estimate – twenty minutes left.” Smiling, he walked towards the door which Smith was about to push open.
With a subtly impatient eye-roll, Sherlock added, “If we manage to convince Jack that Violet’s uncle is already dead, he is bound to lose interest in Violet. Because once he and Bob think Violet knows she’s inherited a fortune, they will assume she will be a lot more cautious and never marry without a prenuptial agreement.”
After hanging up, he stared into space for a long time, trying to find alternative angles that would shed new light onto the whole situation.
“That... was amazing,” John said with a shy smile, after having caught his breath.
Once Sherlock was in his builders clothes and he’d reappeared from the bathroom with his tooth painted black and his false tattoo skilfully applied once again, he made for the door before John had had a chance to say so much as a simple good-bye to him. Just like both days previously.
Then, an NSY arrest unit of six men entered the room from two sides simultaneously, catching her just enough by surprise that they had her in handcuffs on the second try already.
Sherlock kept telling himself that the odds of Eurus Moriarty actually showing up for the Hamlet audition tonight were very small indeed.
“You have no idea of the state he’s in, John,” Mrs Hudson snivelled. “I was terrified! You need to see him, John. You need to help him!”
“Arrives and leaves at the exact same time every bloody day, like clockwork,” said the second man, before bursting out in another nasty coughing fit.
Smith stopped and looked indignantly at him. “What would I be confessing to?”
(He was always quite pleased when an apparently useless bit of information he’d memorised turned out to serve a purpose later on. But not usually
“Indeed,” Sherlock said, his voice thick, and leaned over to press a kiss to her cheek.
Sherlock Holmes was in hospital.
Sherlock pinched his lips together, waiting until the cursed cake was in the oven.
He could have texted, but then Sherlock might have decided to join him at Leverton’s on his way home and John apparently preferred he didn’t. He wanted to do this alone.
* * * * *
“It doesn’t matter. You shouldn’t worry about that.”
Sherlock walked back to the living area in large strides and grabbed his phone from where he’d left it. He punched the screen to type out a text, fast as lightning.
Thankfully, his friendly tone lulled her into quietness for a few minutes.
Good news: I’m now no longer as hellishly busy at work as I have been the past six months, so I really hope to be able to go back to my initial posting schedule of 2 updates a month. :D
In the videos with these two, there had been smiles and a tenderness that had actually surprised Sherlock. Even though they were actors, a lot of it had seemed genuine and spontaneous to a certain extent. There had been no trace of discomfort in the lanky boy’s body language, and Sherlock had enjoyed watching the pair more than he’d thought he would.
John looked up at the ceiling. He tried to steady his breath, but failed rather spectacularly. He couldn’t help it; his heart was racing, and not so much because of the pickle they were in. It was just that the current setting
“Yes.”
But now they found themselves in an unfamiliar city, soaking up the scents and sights of a different culture, feeling relaxed and romantic (it was, after all, their first holiday together) and both considered reaching for the other one’s hand. When the back of Sherlock’s fingers accidentally brushed against John’s, John quickly grabbed his hand and squeezed it, smiling up at his handsome new lover.
. Just stop it, whatever it is that you’re thinking,” John ordered. “It’s just… I simply need time to come to terms with this. That’s all, okay?”
“Yeah, ain’t gonna happen. It seems therapists have only made my trust issues worse.”
* * * * *
girls, we most definitely are!” The man’s – heavily made up – wide eyes quickly scanned them both, lingering rather critically, John felt, on John and his outfit. John tried to smile, and casually swung his hip to one side in imitation of Sherlock.
Sherlock decided there was no point offering tea and exchanging niceties on this occasion. Not that he often did, but today it would definitely only make things more painful. And Sherlock’s stomach was already agonisingly clenched tight as a clam, intermittently sending sickening waves of nerves and unease over the rest of his body. It was a feeling he had gradually gotten used to over the past weeks, although it did seem to have reached a new maximum just now.
She’d have known what to do with those two if they’d come knocking at her previous job. Deep down, such men were invariably insecure little babies. Quite laughable. No longer able to compensate once they were naked. If only the reasonable people in the world were able to make such parasites feel naked all the time.
John had looked around the strange space they were in, a corridor only just wide enough for Sherlock’s wheelchair, which Sherlock was now carefully parking at the far end. He’d had no idea what this was all about.
Sherlock has not yet opened his eyes, still hazy and worn out, his head lolling back slightly. He’s obviously less alert now, which makes John dare to remain standing this close to him: near enough to feel his body warmth and to study the tiny hairs on his jaw – which he does. John studies also Sherlock’s closed eyes and the little wrinkles between his eyebrows, until he wonders whether Sherlock is really not aware of his proximity. Concluding that he must be, in spite of his spent state, John deduces that Sherlock must be okay with it, then. Probably not for long, though. John decides to furtively enjoy the moment while it lasts.
“You said your life turned on one word.”
Once he had Rosie dried off and dressed again, he took her to the lounge, where he found Sherlock sitting on the sofa with his elbows on his knees, fingers steepled in front of his chin.
Walking close to Sherlock, Smith said, in a stage whisper, “I think you need to, er, tell your faithful little friend how you’re wasting his time because you’re too high to know what’s
“Or if he might be trying to find out who her friends are and which ones she trusts, so that he can somehow get to her or her money through them? But he could do that far more easily by just continuing to date her.”
Weren’t they in the twenty-first century, for crying out loud? “Oh, boys, get a grip, there’s no reason to be so ashamed about being caught snuggling with another man in this day and age, for heaven’s sake,” she smiled. “And you certainly don’t have to hide from
His heart seemed to skip a beat at the idea, shocked.
He grinned.
Sherlock lowered his gaze to Smith’s hands.
Sherlock and John looked at each other, and Janine was glad to see she’d planted a seed in fertile soil. A proper vacation in a different place would definitely do them good, to make up for the ghastly summer they’d had. They surely earned it.
John remembered only too well what it had been like for himself after returning from the war. That sense of alienation wherever he went had to be a hundred times worse for Sherrinford. But Sherlock was impressively good with him, anticipating every situation his brother might find stressful and inventing little ways to guide him through.
“I thought you’d like some coffee,” John said, as he offered him a cup.
Sherlock typed out a reply as fast as lightning.
When Angelo became aware of the sound of their heavy breathing – not obscured by any other noise in the quiet backstreet – he also distinctly detected the suppressed groans and inaudible, urgent whispers that conveyed the passion between them. He was suddenly afraid to move, afraid to startle them. For several long moments, he just stood there, his lips pressed together to keep his smile under control, while his heart slowly melted. He drank in the image of youthful vitality and love, telling himself to remember that, as grey and empty as life might sometimes seem, beauty and passion still existed in the world.
* * * * *
,” she spat out, her voice now decidedly tearful.
“Right,” Sherlock said.
At least that part seemed real enough. Although you could never really be sure, with this clever bastard, who also happened to be one of the finest make-up artists as well as one of the finest actors the London theatres had ever missed out on.
“Look at his clothes. He’s made an effort,” Mycroft said.
Sherlock went still and leaned in to press a soft kiss to the star-shaped scar tissue on John’s shoulder, trying hard not to think of what could have happened if John's unit hadn’t managed to get him back to the base in time and he had been left to bleed for longer.
He still didn’t feel ready to open up to her, though. So he fell back on lies.
When Sherlock slowly pushed his finger inside, John had to make an effort not to gasp.
thing about each other’s family, and that just feels… wrong. We can’t be close, and intimate, and not know any of that kind of stuff.”
Since Eurus had been spying on them quite frequently – what else was there to do, when she missed her like crazy - she had noticed, late September, that John had stopped coming home to their terraced house on Wordsworth Avenue. After another few days, she had decided to simply knock on Rose’s door.
, they could become--
He bonelessly collapsed on top of Sherlock, resting his forehead on Sherlock’s shoulder as he tried to wrap his mind around what they had just done and how utterly glorious it had been.
They were free.
After doing the same with the pair of black knickers, turning Sherlock back into his usual, naked self, John efficiently stripped off his own clothes, and soon after, they were on the bed, John on top of Sherlock, kissing as if their lives depended on it. (Precisely because their lives didn’t depend on anything at all for the first time in months.)
“My case.”
“I don’t want to go to Aunt Tuulikki.”
Sherlock, meanwhile, seemed to be happily ignoring the conversation, instead carefully making sure Rosie wouldn’t swallow air at the end of her bottle.
It was the most amazing feeling to suddenly be able to bury his face in Sherlock’s neck just like that and breathe him in. In some inexplicable way, it felt safe.
For dinner, they had a banana and a glass of orange juice.
About an hour later, having obtained no useful clues beside the gun, the note and some fibres of cloth they had found on the jagged window glass, Greg informed John that Daniel had also returned empty-handed.
“I told you, we have no idea where she went, exactly,” said Greg, exasperated. “Except that she was probably at one point in Morocco, around two weeks later, by early May. At least that’s where her pal AJ turned up when my Moroccan colleagues came across him.”
He initially hadn’t been sure whether it was a good idea to bring Rosie yesterday, but he hadn’t managed to get a babysitter, so he’d taken her with him out of necessity. And seeing as she had decidedly cheered Sherlock up and had also conveniently given them something to talk about other than all the gloomy stuff that had kept them occupied recently, he had brought her again today.
There was only one way. He needed to do research, and then practice. Since he’d managed to get to grips with a rather elaborate variety of skills in his life, he was confident he should be able to master this one.
.” His voice sounded uncharacteristically soft and vulnerable and he was looking at John with an otherworldly look, his eyes big and shiny. John was still waiting for his brain to start functioning again when Sherlock all of a sudden leaned in to kiss John once more.
He took a deep breath. “Mary used to be part of a group of four secret agents, who all carried memory sticks with their initials on it, A.G.R.A., containing the data about all of each other’s secret identities. They kept those as a kind of insurance for themselves. Then, six years ago, one of their missions went wrong. In Tbilisi, Georgia. They were meant to free a group of hostages at the British embassy, but someone had betrayed them and the rebels knew they were coming. Mary got away but thought that all of the others had died. Last month, when I ambushed the man smashing all the Thatcher busts, I found out that he was one of Mary’s team, and was looking for his A.G.R.A. stick, which he’d hidden in a drying clay bust of Margaret Thatcher while on the run.”
Sherlock looked taken aback, wary. He only barely seemed able to keep his emotions in check, while also clearly trying to read his brother’s intentions, looking from the painting in his hands to him and back.
He should probably shut up now, but his speech centre seems to have detached from the rest of his brain and developed a mind of its own. Also, he is angry and frustrated, which leads to him not caring very much. “Dear God above,” he grouses aloud. “Just a freaking blowjob, is that too much to ask? Apparently, yes.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “The
, then?” he blurted out daringly.
He obviously had a sick, weak mind, having fantasies about a random woman on the bus as well as his best friend. Pitiful.
Well, at least he had the courtesy of killing them first, unlike Savile.
Then someone knocked on the door of the interview room.
“I didn’t. I don’t.”
Was she teasing him? Purposely provoking him? Making him contradict her?
John’s head lolling slightly as he was being lifted onto it.
“No. No, of course I’m not okay. Malnourished, double kidney failure, and frankly I’ve been off my tits for weeks.” Sherlock squinted up at John, a smile clearly tugging at the corner of his mouth. “What kind of a doctor are you?” Groaning, he settled down on the pillows. “I got my confession, though, didn’t I?” He looked across to Smith, who amazingly managed to pull himself free of the police officer.
Although the trains were having some trouble sticking to their schedule because of the weather, Sherlock still went to visit Sherrinford the day after arriving back home.
Sherlock was the one walking by his side now, staying close to him wherever they went.
“Oh, lovely, thank you, Mrs Hudson. That sounds like a worthy cause indeed.” John took a biscuit from the plate, as he enquired, “How have your eyes been of late?”
“They always fill me with a certain horror,” Sherlock admitted. “It is my belief, John, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.”
He briefly closed his eyes.
The so-called Dominatrix, who had been stupid enough to have her phone confiscated by the authorities while she had been intensively working together with Jim. A lot of sensitive information that had been important to Jim and his clients had been on that phone and had come into the hands of the police thanks to her stupidity. Several of Jim’s major projects had flopped because of that. A number of Jim’s most trusted business partners had since disappeared; having fled or been arrested.
There had been guards in the building after all.
Beautiful dog. Dark eyes full of loyalty.
,” he smirked, wide-eyed.
“So what do you think?” she asked.
“I’m Eurus. Silly name, isn’t it? Greek. Means the East Wind.”
(See the end of the chapter for
And then it hit John. “Oh God,” he said.
He typed back with his wrong hand, careful not to wake Rosie up.
Anyway, it wasn’t as if this halfwit had any chance of making it past the primaries. He was obviously just in it for some more screen time, nothing more.
They remained standing there, in a tight embrace, for several minutes, as Mycroft softly sobbed into Sherlock’s shoulder.
. I don’t care you’ve been standing watch at his door the whole time.” He rolled his eyes as Hopkins skilfully weaved through the busy London traffic, their blue flashing lights reflecting off of the cars around them. “What do you mean ‘the door is jammed’?! Jesus Christ. Hopkins,
. Whatever he now was to him, exactly.
“No, no, it’s fine. Just give me a moment. Don’t move.” John let out a long, slow breath. After deliberately breathing in and out a few more times, he started to leisurely wriggle his hips in small movements. Then he took hold of his own cock and slowly pumped his fist a couple of times. “Carry on,” he grinned shyly.
Zero. Nil. Absolutely non-existent.
Positioning himself between James and his only way out, Sherlock deduced, “You got attached to this house very quickly, Mr Wilder. Although I’m sure you would like to be addressed as Beverly.” At James’ furious expression, Sherlock said, “Oh, had you already sent your ransom letter? Don’t worry, nobody told me. The situation was quite clear from the coat of arms on your old handkerchief, which you keep with you at all times. When, by coincidence, you came to work here, you recognised the same image above the entrance and realised you were working for your own father. You heard of the other son and couldn’t stand the idea that he would inherit all this and you would get nothing. So you abducted him, by sending him a letter that you pretended was from his mum, to lure him out of his dorm in the dead of night. Once you realised that the letter had been found and had put the police on Edith Beverly’s track, together with the fortunate coincidence of the shawl, which the boy kept in much the same fashion as you did your handkerchief, you probably decided this was an ideal distraction for you to be able to quietly send the ransom letter. You planted another clue, fishing a medicine box out of the garbage bins on the estate. I imagine you thought it would suit Edith well getting the blame, as she got what your own mother never had.”
Sherlock managed a small smile. “Yes.” He still couldn’t help feeling proud that John had, in fact, chosen him at one point. Then his stomach turned to concrete again, as it did each time after he came back to reality after allowing himself to forget, just for a few seconds, where they were likely heading.
John quickly ended the call.
She didn’t smile. She just blankly stared at the director, without looking away or batting an eye.
(Thank god he had not actually acted upon that overhurried invitation back then and had decided to take things slowly. But still, all those times he had in fact shagged Sherlock, he had done so in complete oblivion.)
Shortly after, Sherrinford came back with an enormous, bulky object, wrapped in metallic blue paper.
In the doorway, someone cleared their throat.
“I’m Harry. Nice to meet you,” she stammered, at his already retreating back.
And with Sherlock’s caresses grounding him in the present and with him slowly planting soft, unhurried kisses on his brow and temple, before John knew it, he suddenly felt overwhelmed with an unexpected want.
“I don’t know.”
“Yeah.” Sherlock thought he half-succeeded at faking a fond smile, helped somewhat by his mild amusement at Sally’s facial expression. “She had us all fooled for a long while, before we found out.”
It had been the last time she had seen Rose.
He let out a slow breath. He should really get some sleep, but he just seemed unable to.
Now he came to think of it, while he was being really honest with himself, maybe there was one more thing he wanted in his life. Maybe, once they were back home in London, he could try and find a place where he could take ballet lessons again. John had his book project in his free time now, after all. Perhaps, at the age of almost forty, it was time for him to finally pick up an old hobby as well.
Sherlock had already grabbed the fake gun from his tool belt and pointed it at James as he walked closer toward him, motioning for him to let go of Arthur and step away from the boy. “You. Over there.”
Then they kissed. Thoroughly.
love me.”
They briefly embraced, before John took some crochet yarn and hooks and a couple of ladies’ magazines from his bag and gave them to her.
They spoke little during the journey, instead watching the towns, meadows, forests and fields slide by.
John nodded, shrugging.
Without breaking eye contact, Sherlock let himself drop back onto the bed, so John could remove his underwear altogether from his legs. John then stepped out of his and crawled over Sherlock, one foot still on the floor. His cock was oddly hovering in mid-air somewhere above Sherlock’s crotch.
As you might have noticed, I like to put a lot of Easter eggs and subtle references to the show or to Mofftiss’s decisions in my fics. Usually, I don’t want to point them out and explain them explicitly, since that would kind of spoil the fun, but in the case of the “It is what it is” quote, there might be a lot of people wondering what the two references (poem and John Locke) were about, so here is a reference post:
But now that it was getting better, it did make him feel genuinely glad.
“Five minutes?” Saheed asked.
Her name was Eurus.
He loved John, of course he did, and that terrified him. The fear he’d been experiencing for the past twenty-four hours, fear of losing John, was in fact eerily familiar, just like she’d said. He felt it constantly,
“You look like you could use some calories,” Hannah said and winked, before disappearing into the kitchen. She came back with a large bucket of strawberry cheesecake ice cream and three spoons. “My secret emergency stock from the back of the freezer,” she said, with a broad smile, as she pulled the lid off the tub. “Ooh, and there’s chocolate raisins,” she said, turning around to go and fetch them.
Different sounds, different voices.
Why did he sound so relieved?
Sherlock had to sit through all of them, pretending to be interested.
John swallowed. “My love, to be honest, I want nothing more than to hold you and never let go. You know what? Let’s get out of here. There is this ridiculous table between us, and - -”
If that was even what they had now.
-- Thanks. We’re fine. Spending some quality time together. Going for a walk now. And you? J
Having John on top of him, the weight of his sturdy frame wonderfully pressing down on Sherlock, making him feel revered and safe, Sherlock needed… he wanted… he desperately wanted
They kissed.
“She has a small child of her own as well, didn’t you know?” Mycroft said.
Smith stood and walked closer to the bed, pointing towards the door. “Policeman outside, you mean? Come on. Can’t you guess?”
“No! It’s fine,” she breathed. “Keep your eyes closed. Give me your hand.”
Luckily, he knew a very posh restaurant whose owner owed him a favour.
(See the end of the chapter for
John briefly caught his lip between his teeth and looked down at Sherlock with an awed look. “Oh god, you are so goddamn beautiful, you know that?”
He straightened back up and they looked at each other for a moment, suddenly serious. Through a miracle they were both still alive. Alive and together, blood rushing through their veins, now filled with raging testosterone and adrenalin.
On the occasions when John and Rosie came with him to Wantage, John often told Sherlock he was actually not bad. Just not as brilliant as Sherrinford – who was an absolute wizard with paint, obviously. But still, Sherlock did seem to have a certain degree of talent, according to John. Gradually, Sherlock also noticed himself getting better, even though that was not really the point at all; but if you practise something often enough, you’re bound to automatically become more proficient.
“Yes. Sorry. I’m just…”
He thought about what it would be like if they were boyfriends (much as he loathed that term), and he would have to engage in small talk with John every day and often spend time together and regularly have sex with him.
A silent mantra repeated in his mind: ‘
It would be better than nothing.
Rosamund.
John followed quickly after.
,” he said. “Thankfully, Uncle Mycroft knows a lot of nice people at the secret service,” he added, faking a cheerful tone, “who will hopefully clean up the mess your daddy made, once more.”
Mycroft had had the footage altered and slapped a D-notice on it, because John hadn’t been sure he’d had any will to live left after seeing Sherlock be taken away in handcuffs from Appledore that Christmas night.
Sherlock felt a little shy thinking about everything John had done for him.
Sherlock lifted his head to look at John. “Yes.”
Stars exploded behind his eyes as he filled Sherlock, and he kept pressing deeper and deeper into him until his cum leaked out from around his cock.
, Sherlock. Jesus. Sally will never fall for that, at
He felt alone, but he knew he wasn’t really.
Sherlock shivered.
The world had gone fuzzy and quiet, and everything was heavy, in a wonderfully comforting way.

was a game at the moment.
But the clenched fist hadn’t gone away since then. It was still there every time John got up from the table to clear away the dishes, every time he waited for the kettle to boil or walked across the flat to fetch something.
He wriggled his bottom enticingly in front of John, which cost him more effort than it really should. Stupid flu.
John hadn’t had any such contemplations when Mary had died.
His last text to John (yesterday) had said, “How about I drop round to your house and you angrily send me away? S”
He closed his eyes, remembering one particular, sunny day.
to fuck you. Right. Now.”
“Chips,” he stated.
“John, stand still for a moment,” Sherlock ordered. He put his hand on John’s forehead. “You belong in bed. You’ve got a temperature, John.”
that he had, as he’d been completely shutting himself off. It probably should have been no surprise that initially he’d automatically done that with John as well. He never let anyone this close and it was all somewhat mind-blowing.
“My special hairband.”
There was a short silence.
John nodded. “Hmm. So you dreamed up a magic woman who told you things you didn’t know.”
He frowned, suddenly becoming aware of the sound of furniture being shoved around above them. Typically some kind of Holmes hands-on experiment, seeing as nothing was ever too crazy to try out for these two.
“Alright sir, I’ll go fetch the curl balm for the final touch then. Won’t be a moment.”
Sherlock’s smile widened by its own accord for a second, before Sherlock schooled his face back into a more neutral expression – not entirely successfully, thus sending butterflies scattering inside John’s stomach.
It wasn’t until they were on their way back to 221b the second time that Sherlock eventually spoke again. “People just don’t know how to keep bees and make honey anymore,” he grumbled. “When the day arrives that I get tired of my work in London, I think I may just become a beekeeper myself, in some place quiet. Like Sussex. And thus prevent the local old ladies from dying of bloody botulism!”
The thought only occurred to Smith halfway through his fifth story. He stopped talking and got up, walking over to where Sherlock’s clothes and coat were hanging. Indeed, as he rummaged through all of the garments, he found no less than three recording devices, hidden away in seams and pockets.
“Nothing whatsoever,” he bluffed. He’d become good enough at that particular lie. It had been alter ego defence, anyway, he reminded himself. John had never planned to kill her. You could almost say it had been an accident.
John opened his. It supposedly belonged to a woman called Susan Lee, with spikey, short black hair and dark eyeliner around her eyes. He frowned, swallowing hard.
* * * * *
As Sherlock was recovering, he’d gradually filled John in on what he thought he then knew about Mary. How he was quite sure that she was Moran, Moriarty’s former right hand.
John was peacefully sleeping next to him.
Then there was only his own heavy breathing and nothing else.
Still, Sherlock had had the distinct feeling for a while already that there was someone else operating under that same flag as well. The thought just wouldn’t leave him alone. He quite simply couldn’t think of any motive Mary might have had for broadcasting the ‘Miss me?’ message across the UK the day he was being exiled. It just didn’t make sense.
“Well, this explains why he had time to pack,” Sherlock said, as he held up the letter to John. “Most likely fake,” he added, studying the handwriting once more and taking a quick snapshot of the note with his phone, before putting it into an evidence bag and handing it to the unsuspecting officers on the corridor. “Might want to make a habit of checking the bedding more thoroughly in future,” he grimaced. The officer that had been the last to arrive raised his eyebrows in shock as he looked over the letter, then went white and turned to hurry back down the corridor with it.
Janine was immersed in a philosophical discussion with Uncle Rudy, as Mike Stamford listened to an explanation of Mummy and Daddy’s latest garden project involving a bird feeder with a camera attached to it.
“Well,” Sherlock said, speaking softly, “it seemed like something you might have done if any of this was real and you’d actually loved her. I guess… I thought it would make our story more realistic.”
John’s blissed-out smile made Sherlock thrust deeper, faster, harder, his enthusiasm at this endeavour rising. And John’s praising words casually murmured close to Sherlock’s ear made him want to devour this extraordinary creature who was letting him do this and who seemed to be enjoying it no less than he was.
“You know, can we still… kiss and cuddle when she is around?” John asked, feeling rather awkward. “Or would you rather…?”
Sherlock was astonished.
(“Jellyfish don’t have eyelashes, is why,” he imagined John dryly pointing out to him, had he actually said it aloud in his presence.)
Beside the calm contentedness that he felt on the one hand, there was, however, also a considerable amount of anxiousness seeping in at every corner, of course; at not only being outside of the house, but being 30,000 feet
Interesting.
All she needed to do was get rid of the actual therapist and take her place, and she would find out all about John Watson’s weaknesses and his relationship with Sherlock Holmes in the easiest way she ever could have imagined.
John was speechless at the other end of the line.
During the nights, they snuggled together in bed, politely ignoring each other's occasional erections, knowing that their time would come. Whenever things did tend to get a little more heated and their kisses would deepen, John would instantly get the most ghastly of headaches, so they quickly learned not to do that. Although John was rather frustrated about not being well enough to do much just yet, Sherlock’s lack of experience was another good reason to take it slow anyway, John thought.
Today, he and Rosie were visiting the nursery he and Mary had enrolled her at, in order to receive the final bits of practical information. Thankfully, it was no problem for her to start there earlier. John had decided to go back to work the following week. And Rosie was definitely ready for some more action in her life than just the same old toys and no one else to play with but her half-depressed dad.
Sherrinford exchanged several long looks with Sherlock, as if conveying gratitude for what his brother had done.
Sometimes, when he was lying in bed next to John, staring at the ceiling, he had no idea how to take the initiative. Then John, with his maddeningly smooth manner, would just turn to him, wrap an arm around him and smile, as if it was the easiest thing in the world.
“How did you know where to find me?” John asked, loudly.
Eurus looked in the mirror and ran a hand through their hair. They really needed another haircut, they decided, as it had grown several millimetres again at the back of their neck. Hairstyles came in phases and Eurus was in a decidedly short phase this summer.
He only realised when it was too late; when suddenly, John was rolling a condom onto Sherlock’s prick. As John grabbed its base with one firm but gentle hand, an intense jolt of pleasure and excitement coursed through Sherlock and all thoughts of making up excuses to leave went out the window. As did all his thoughts, period.
In the thirty metres it took to get to the main entrance of the community centre, Sherlock managed to get more appreciative looks than John did funny ones. One bloke even whistled, at which Sherlock casually smirked and John felt his cheeks heat.
“Well, I’m sure the doctors are doing whatever they can to bring him back to you,” she said innocently, “so you can continue to pine over him.” Her smile was pure evil.
John was close. So very close. Sherlock was holding him, kissing him, pressing him against the bathroom wall, while John thrust into his hand.
It wasn’t very likely that Sherlock would see him any time soon though, as he’d seen John only last week. He was busy with other things and probably needed space. Better not to bother him with this. Not now.
the way he looked now.  John closed his eyes for a second, trying to rid himself of these ridiculous thoughts. Sherlock flashed a small smile at him as he held open one of the swing doors into the theatre room.  “You look lovely too, John,” he whispered with a wink, and pursed his lips into an imaginary kiss. John smiled and pursed his lips back at him, before quickly focusing on the room they were entering.
– that made him feel quite pleased.
Instead, coming back to the present, he became aware of John trying to shift his legs so that they were alternately aligned, clearly uncomfortable with their earlier position.
And then, as soon as he’d pulled himself together, he made good on his silent promise, continuing to suck Sherlock from where he’d left off earlier. After letting Sherlock hover on the edge of orgasm for as long as he could, John finally let him come down his throat – the golden dress glittering as Sherlock trembled through his climax.
“That was amazing,” John said eventually, lifting his head from Sherlock’s sweaty shoulder, the happiest of smiles on his face.
“Not sure, change to what,” John signed, looking a little helpless. “We’re used to it now. Changing is strange.”
Lestrade’s reaction was slowly threatening to become even more embarrassing than Mrs Hudson’s, who had been harassing them with her smiles and winks and extra food ever since she had caught them kissing in the hallway.
“Hello there,” John said to the criminal, his voice a sea of calm. “Now where did you think you were going with that rucksack?”
“Yes,” Sherlock chimed in, “an unidentified, limbless body found decomposing inside a trunk in left luggage office in Waterloo station. Should be fun.”
“Now the tables are turned,” Janine couldn’t resist cheekily remarking, as she sipped her coffee in the dimly lit lounge of 221B.
Either way, he’d always suspected that there was some trauma in Sherlock’s past that had made him ‘like this’. He’d even dreamed up some far-fetched explanation while he’d been in the process of waking up from his coma, about a murderous sister. (Turned out it was a murderous brother. Not that far off the mark, in hindsight, although this one at least didn’t seem in the habit of committing arson and setting up elaborate murder mazes with fancy television screens, as far as he knew.)
“Even you?” John asked, against Sherlock’s chest.
Eventually, John strolled over into the kitchen to help set the table.
* * * * *
“Oh, I invited them. On behalf of each other. Neither of them can afford such a posh place, of course. Not yet, anyway.”
anymore,” said another, between coughs.
“Please phone me if he gets in contact. Thank you.”
Writing this fix-it has been really therapeutic for me, and I hope that reading it has had a similar effect on you as a reader.
Being with John had taught him more than he’d ever thought possible. Everything revolved around coordination, consent, communication – which had turned out not to be half as tedious as it sounded. Sherlock was starting to understand more and more why John said honesty was so important in relationships. Not only was it a prerequisite to feeling at ease and trusting someone completely, which in turn was a prerequisite for enjoyable physical intimacy. Also, the expressions of pleasure and discomfort were strangely similar, so there was nothing for it than to always ask, “Is this alright? Do you want me to continue to touch you like this?” That, combined with the strange desire not to let the other one down, the inclination to pretend something was fine when it wasn’t. Revelations only done when asked.
John nodded. “Yeah, fine,” he replied, with a little smile. “You?”
(When John did this, he would just read the words that were in the book – like you were meant to. Sherlock, however, focused on the illustrations and would tell Rosie all sorts of facts and figures about the animal species depicted and what these particular individuals had obviously had been up to, judging by the pictures – and ignoring the text altogether. Because of this, it was impossible for John to get any writing done while Sherlock read to her, seeing as he ended up listening and giggling just as much as Rosie – who didn’t even understand half of what Sherlock was saying, anyway.)
John hugged him a bit tighter, letting out a long breath. “Then we have more in common than we thought.”
“Well, the thrill is part of the fun, isn’t it?” Sherlock smirked, stopping to turn around toward John. “I wouldn’t want us to live boring domestic lives now that we’re...” He seemed lost for words for a second and then quickly averted his gaze.
The horrible realisation then dawned on John that all the people who had been ‘talking’ all this time would now righteously gloat about having been right from the beginning. But then again, it was a small price to pay for what they had now. On top of which, it was actually quite funny, in spite of the bitter edge of irony that everybody had seen what they had both failed to acknowledge all those years.
He looked up to see a sad smile on his brother’s face.
Only a few years ago, Sherlock had realised how strange it really was that they hadn’t been there to support and guide him with his emotions.
The awkwardness of the situation was tangible to everyone except to Mrs Holmes. It was clear from his face that even Sherrinford could tell that his mother was making Sherlock and John deeply uncomfortable. He wildly gestured at Sherlock.
“I’ll just leave you to it then.” He briefly shot them a cheeky glance, then disappeared through the door.
“I will take it easy from now on,” Sherlock promised.
“Thanks, bye.” John stared ahead for a full minute, baffled, then opened a new tab in his browser to search ‘golden beehive epping’. Pictures of a beautiful tea garden appeared on his screen, with hedges and wild flowers and a romantic looking cottage-like building in the background, a close-up of an actual straw beehive surrounded by bees flying to and fro, as well as some appealing images of plates with delicious looking scones, cream and jam. All in all, it looked very picturesque. What on earth had Sherlock made a reservation in this place for?
‘Fuck off’ was familiar enough, certainly, and would have the exact opposite effect, as always.
Slowly, very slowly, as he stared at the patches of shade from the tree outside dancing over the objects in the room, he started to dare to believe that maybe Sherlock did respect him, want him and need him in the same way John did the other way round.
Maybe he already knew.
“Just one word,” the woman repeated.
“No.” No need to tell him about that just yet.
“Yes.”
They didn’t often share a closed-mouth kiss, or at least not one that lasted this long. But this one seemed to seal the most important promise they would ever make. To stick together, as a family. And the duration seemed symbolic of the durability of their pact.
It was the first promise he’d made to himself when the reality of Mary’s death had sunken in. No alcohol. Not a single drop. Rosie needed him. And it wouldn’t make sense, anyway. He should be relieved, really. Things could finally go back to the way they had been, before he’d thought Sherlock dead. Eventually. If that was what Sherlock wanted. If that was what
Sherlock merely smirked lopsidedly in the background.
“Yoo-hoo! It’s ready!” Mrs Hudson’s muffled voice called from the landing. “Can someone open the door for me, please?”
Sherlock had been so incautious as to take off his cap and glasses in the restroom at the Hall, since he wanted to throw some water over his face to cool off, when she entered with her cleaning equipment. Or more precisely, with the cleaning lady’s cleaning equipment, as the cleaning lady herself had apparently fallen victim to the same summer flu that the man Sherlock was replacing suffered from.
“Oh, this baby will be the
“Southbank,” the man answered. “But no cross-dressing clubs there, so…”
When there was no response, he retracted his hand and clumsily pushed his pyjama bottoms down to reveal his buttocks.
“Are you still there?” She sounded panicked.
“Hi, John! How are you?” She smiled reflexively.
It was a bit like waiting for Rose when she had been away. Which had happened a lot. That’s what you got for being such a good shot and an efficient planner, when you worked for Jim Moriarty.
John sways on his feet a little as he walks through the pleasantly cool London night air. He hasn’t been this drunk in a while. Not that he’s completely blotto; nothing like that. But still definitely flushed enough to regret it in the morning.
It was 5 am and Sherlock couldn’t remember when he’d last slept. Whenever he
“Lovely.” He looked at John, as if expecting him to say something.
“Would you perhaps like some tea, mate?” John asked, putting both hands on his knees to get up.
I’m not gay. But it’s fairly evident that I’m not… entirely straight either.” John smiled a sheepish smile, feeling slightly embarrassed. He didn’t want to sound like a sex maniac who was happy to get off with
“Hi,” she said.
They drank tea and talked for over an hour: Mycroft telling Sherlock about how he was always worried sick about his little, frail brother, who had – as they’d thought at the time – survived a murderous attack by a sibling only to get picked on by his peers for being different all the time. How he’d wanted to help him, be there for him in ways his parents should have but weren’t; explain the world to him, so he would understand people better and be less vulnerable.
"I found it on the floor after I interrupted the brawl, they dropped it before they fled." Sherlock answered. John inhaled with a tight smile. "And why are you
And drops down to the bed, making Sherlock bounce and dip from the sudden weight and bump into him. Only as Sherlock recoils does John notice the weirdness of the statement.
with, a man cutting fingers on his kitchen table who claims it to be an experiment-"
Clutching the coat tighter around himself, to steel himself for what, he didn't know, and entered the lioness's den. For some reason, the thought arose an old tune, it ultimately bled into an entire song by the time he reached the door. He concentrated on the tune, wanting to chuckle as the words weaved themselves together from memory. Memory he hadn't even known he possessed.
The horde of people passing just behind them seemed to have dissipated into white noise, but Jesus, they must have been a sight. His bewildered eyes stared up at two half-shut, blank ones. John dug his fingers into his bare forearms, his short nails biting into his numbing flesh. And lowered his gaze to the woolen, navy scarf parallel to him. Clinical and to the point as always. The realization has always been hovering there. In their disregard, in their slacking, in their damn near constant ‘hey John I can’t make it tonight. Can you fill in?’s.
John now looked as though he were wondering what tortures he had endured as a child. “He’s dead…”
“John’s got the hots for a certain
Sherlock scoffed. "Of course not. Well, not
“I forgot my—uh—you guys come up with something good for Cockroach, yeah?” John calls back distractedly as he hauls his bookbag over his jumper-clad shoulder and heads for the metal swingin doors aged with rust and a truly poor paint job.
Still, he felt awful about the whole situation.
“Is her ghost, as it were, perhaps a positive presence in your life? Does she, I don’t know, comfort you, or give you advice, for instance?”
“Unless I was a traitor. A mole who worked from the inside.” She almost seemed cheerful at the idea. “And you came here to see me about how I sabotaged the mission in Tbilisi myself.”
When he was all the way inside, John started pulling out and pushing back in very carefully, closely monitoring every response from Sherlock, still afraid to hurt him or do something wrong. At the same time, the feeling of Sherlock’s tightness was so wonderful and overwhelming that he was afraid to lose control. But he ardently wanted this to be perfect for Sherlock. He wanted to do everything necessary to make Sherlock never want to leave him.
They never held hands in public, because usually they were either trying to keep a low profile while shadowing some criminals, or actually chasing them down in the streets of London. They didn’t often go out for purposes not case-related.
Wow, I think this is the fastest I’ve ever produced a new chapter! Also, this is the first chapter beyond series 4, so from here it’s all made up exclusively by yours truly. :)
John had been bound to find out Sherlock had another brother sooner or later. He really should have just told John. Just like he should have told John he loved him, ages ago. Surely John hadn’t started feeling like that just last week.
Inside, he stood on one leg to take off his pumps, then ran up the stairs two steps at a time.
Probably not her, then.
Sherlock folded his arms. “Anyone ever ‘opt’ to remember?”
“Nice boobs!” Sherlock laughed, stupidly. “I’ll tell you who else has nice boobs! That
Eurus had found the note among Jim’s things when she’d gone through them in a bout of nostalgia, a few weeks ago. She’d stuck it on her wall, not sure what to do with it, but sensing it might somehow come in handy.
He casually eyed John, while putting down the carrier bag to shrug off his coat. Sherlock had become aware that John’s patience and goodwill with Sherlock’s eccentricities had been wearing thin lately, and he’d realised that it wouldn’t hurt to demonstrate that he cared (which was actually a gross understatement) more frequently than once every two years, as had been his modus operandi so far. Caring was not an advantage, but seeing as his feelings for John ran deeper than the Atlantic by this time anyway, there was no longer really any point in obfuscating them. Mrs. Hudson had even been so bold as to outright
Well, I hope you’ve enjoyed this. If you have, don’t be shy to leave a comment. They are indeed very much appreciated. :)
But it didn’t feel
Officially changing Chloe’s name turned out to be a bit of a hassle, but by mid-December, they had it on record.
“You,” John said, hiding a wide grin by looking down as he shook his head. “I think this might warrant champagne, don’t you?”
Mrs Hudson stormed over to him. “Now you just listen to me for once in your stupid life. I know Mary’s dead and I know your heart is broken, but if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who will you have then?”
It was the next few excruciating moments that nearly killed him as Sherlock’s tongue was deadly in more ways than one. The absolutely sinful way his tongue moved around John’s head and flicked against the hole before he took another inch or two of him into his mouth.
“Okay, I found something that could help. Now, this will hurt, so hold onto something, okay?”
John imagined the sounds Sherlock might be able to make with him between his legs, the sounds John could
It seemed to be a perfectly delightful day beside the beach. Men and women promenaded along the seaside, and the mothers hid underneath their parasols while their children abandoned shoes and books to dip their toes into the foaming ocean spray.
John remained silent as he continued to stare up at him. What was the point of this? What was his goal here?
He motioned to zip his lips and smiled when it earned a laugh from his dear friend.
He endeavored to sit up and slid his hand beneath the blanket that protected his modesty, and allowed his fingers to brush against his now abundantly alive length that gave the impression that he had just touched a burning ember, and he swiftly withdrew his hand. Never in all his days had he held such a potent reaction without a significant cause to it.
The recent bout of rain slickened the roughly paved footpaths and caused many a calamity to ensue as the four men ran through twists and turns, up over walls and ducking beneath the multiple lines of clothes that attempted to block their paths.
“I think this is yours.”
With more effort than he usually cared to exert, he hauled the man out of the water as he had exhausted himself in a futile attempt to escape around halfway back. He was soon set in handcuffs and taken away as John laid down, his arm over his eyes, breathless.
Sherlock gently managed to pull the book from John’s grasp and moved closer to him, he closed the space that lingered between them and turned John head to face him. It was then that he noticed how nervous the man looked at was about to occur.
“…Thank you, Sherlock…”
is fine,
So, with all that in mind, I’d love a fic where Sherlock and John are on a case and Sherlock takes a bad fall. John witnesses it and realises the potential for serious injury. There is a fear Sherlock has broken his neck and when John reaches him Sherlock can’t move or properly feel his body (it is not uncommon for spinal injuries to produce swelling that temporarily cause paralysis and numbness). And I would like that to be the case here. No permanent injury on this one. But the important thing is that neither Sherlock nor John know, at the beginning, that the injury is not permanent. There is no way to tell. Sherlock has to undergo a scan and then just wait and see if feeling comes back. And it’s several hours (ambulance ride and then hospital) before Sherlock has had tests and starts to get some feeling and movement back. All this time he’s totally immobilised, on a stretcher, and John is with him reassuring him.
John couldn’t help the slight huff he let out at that, although he covered it up with a cough and held Sherlock closer while he played with his bracelet. After all, it was not Sherlock’s fault that he didn’t know about what transpired earlier that day between him and Mycroft, yet he could not help the small pang of sadness that seemed to stab through him.
He may have also grabbed the guard’s stash of cigarettes and stuffed them in his own coat, just in case he needed them later.
It was a relief that they had made it home before one of these questions managed to emerge, and the two fatigued young men were ushered out of the coach and allowed their feet to drag all the way inside the rather large estate; The belongings that filled every inch of space that they didn’t occupy in the cab would have to be brought in at a later time.
Both laid breathless beside one another within the rumpled bedding that they had managed to pull away from its corners. The only sound that occupied the small space was their slowing heartbeat as they moved towards one another’s arms, the sudden realization that they sat within a cold room completely exposed, was enough to drive them beneath the covers.
A slight smirk grew on Mycroft’s face that he quickly attempted to subdue as he rolled his shoulders and straightened himself. “I always have a good reason for everything I do.”
“Look, Sherlock… I’ve been giving it some thought and… I don’t know if you’d even consider this but-“
that would prevent the foreseeable future. He found nothing.
John looked him over under a scrutinizing gaze, only now able to notice the loose fabric of this man's shirt that fit him ever so right, now that it was no longer covered by his jacket. He let out a small sigh as he shook his head at what his mind was deciding to keep prevalent.
Sherlock only found the courage to look over from him when John pressed a hand to his chest. “Sherlock, I need you and Lestrade to go back to the ship.”
John had to take a deep breath to calm himself as the mindreading was not what he needed right now. At least he was still his same old, irritating self.
Sherlock starts to talk of the “what ifs” in the event he is permanently disabled. How he can’t face living in a care home, how he can’t live without the work etc. John can’t promise him he won’t be disabled. But he does promise him that whatever happens John will take him home eventually and that he won’t leave him; they are in it together and John will help him get his life back.
“I… I have no idea what you are talking about...”
“Go home then, you’ve been here all day and need some rest.”
“Oh, good god- will you both be quiet? You are making this so- so much worse!”
Sherlock help but let his eyes roll at the sight, his focus soon able to focus on his men when he looked to see the ship continue on its path towards them. “Alright, we’re dealing with a swag bellied prick, better known as my brother. If he’s here, it most likely means I’ll be arrested and possibly hung. That isn’t what concerns me. If that should happen, Lestrade will become your new captain.”
“Heh, yeah.. I’ll see you tomorrow?”
Sherlock eventually pushed it away when the side of his face felt irritatingly numb. John insisted that he kept it on, but he did not fight him much when he continually pushed it away like a small child.
He was awoken with a start as his head hit the bottom of a desk he’d found himself sleeping under. He hurriedly looked to see what had caused such a violent reaction and his eyes took a disconcerting amount of time to adjust to the sudden stream of light entering the room with the tall figure of Captain Holmes blocking it.
“Ugh, I know what I said John! I’ve been reminded of that for the last two days by the both of you,” He quickly pulled off the handkerchief in disgust before rubbing his face.
“So.. I hit you in my sleep? It’s hardly crazy, John. It’s just muscle spasms brought on by the fact that I hadn’t entered the REM stage.”
His head was whipped back to see what had stopped him, he only needed to follow Sherlock’s gaze to see that a group of men had gathered at the front of the prison, with Mycroft at its focal point.
Has it only been three days since I last posted? yes. Is it because I'm absolutely excited for these next two chapters? absolutely
He picked one of the many books placed into the stone and moved back to sit on his bed. The gentle glow of the lanterns gave him the sight to try and turn the pages, that seemed to want to fall apart at every opportunity and float away on the small currents that ran through his makeshift home, but he wouldn’t allow it.
“Sherlock, do not start that,” he moved to lightly push his tail back into the water and instead placed Sherlock’s abandoned book in his arms.
Another bout of mumbling ensued for so long that he was able to go under the blanket again to catch the tail end of the sentence.
Sherlock hardly flinched when he heard him approach, and turned to look to him with a small smile on his lips. “Hello again.”
“This is probably the worst mistake of my life, but I’ll help you get Sherlock back.”
They eventually settled to rest their heads against one another, their mingled breath was a great relief that allowed them to stay closer than necessary.
“We have to stop now...”
“I beg your pardon? How dare you assume such a thing about me when we are perfect strangers!”
Sherlock took a quick bite of food before going over to John once again, holding his head in his hands to press a kiss to his lips. The soft friction of their mouths connected willed John to move closer into his touch before Sherlock hesitantly pulled away.
The small cave went quiet for a moment, but Victor could have claimed it sounded as though something had just shattered behind him from the sudden painful ringing his ears had taken on. Victor’s hand dropped away from Sherlock’s in order to hold himself upright on the bed as he thought he would fall over.
Mycroft was about to make another quip in their already tiresome back and forth, when the sharp sound of a shoulder connecting to a wooden door drew their attention away and towards Sherlock’s cabin.
“John, what happened?” He moved to sit down beside him, and attempted to push away John’s hand that only remained firmly planted.
John needed to take in a breath at his explanation. They had only known one other one or two days, yet they had likely shown one another more intimacy than many married couples in London had. It hardly seemed to matter how intimate this new action was.
“Sherlock, we have to go. Now.”
“How… How did you know I was a doctor?”
Sherlock let out a small chuckle and shook his head as he took another bite of fruit. “I quite like it. Doctor John Watson, it sounds very important.”
The Captain took a pause as he allowed himself to take a drink as he pondered his words, and soon cleared his throat before he stood. The entirety of the room silenced to turn their gaze towards him.
The line appeared to go dead after that, the only sound that confirmed John could still hear him was the shaking breaths that came from John’s end before he made a sound that Mycroft could only understand as crying.
Before he knew it, he had pushed john from his spot and watched as the guard’s bullet came his way. He hoped he had calculated right, he had to have it right.
what I thought you were. That’s why I’m asking you to help me save Sherlock.”
Sherlock let out a small chuckle as he continued to play with his hair, and soon pressed a kiss to his lips where John could taste himself on his lips. “Your just tired. Take a nap.”
“J… John I’m, I’m not a d… dog…”
He wiped sweat from his brow, and moved to open one of the small portholes that produced the smallest sliver light for the room. Fresh air rushed in when the breeze grazed against the side of the ship, providing him some relief as he went to the task of organizing his tools. John eventually leaned back in the old wooden chair as he inhaled the fresh air, feeling the smell replenish his nose after hours in the musk of rotting wood.
It was quiet for a moment, a pleading stare for this young man to tell such an intimate detail of his life without the slightest hint in his eyes that he wouldn’t spread this news to the rest of London while John was carted away for indecency.
John quietly laid in bed later that night with Sherlock in his arms, the gentle sound of the man’s breathing did little to ease the anxiety that sat like a stone in his stomach.
“Ah, alright.” He happily took the sandwich John had offered him and took a bite. It took only a moment of his chewing for him to realise this was not something he wanted to swallow. He gave John a small smile as the man waited for his reaction to it, and soon had to spit it out into the water when John turned away from him.
Sherlock remained at the side of the boat, gazing through the scope as he watched Mycroft order the men about to sail towards their ship. He nearly dropped the scope into the ocean when he ducked down at the sight of Mycroft looking almost directly at him.
The two laid silently for a while, the touch of one another suddenly not providing as much comfort as it did earlier in the day. John had thought Sherlock had fallen asleep and was about to do the same, when Sherlock’s muffled voice rang through his ear.
Sherlock merely hummed at the vague enough answer, instead occupying himself with removing John’s shirt. He let his hands mimic the man’s previous movements over his chest, stopping to let his thumb massage over his wound with care now they had their privacy. He soon leaned forward, pressing gentle kisses to the scarred skin, enjoying the sigh that John let out at the touches.
Greg could not help but notice similarities John had taken to Sherlock as they lifted him up; neither of them mentioned that he felt so light that either one of them could have carried him on their own.
He was too distracted by the possibility of a large fish that circled underneath him, that he hardly noticed the man that suddenly appeared beneath the dock, and clung to the pole as he stared up to John.
A small shiver of repulsion ran through Sherlock at the reminder that he lived away from the rest of their pod. He knew Mycroft had a very similar situation to his, but he seemed to accentuate the fact that Sherlock was especially alone.
“John?”
His voice suddenly sounded so small, it sounded miniscule compared to the usual grandeur and command he usually held whenever he spoke; he sounded… almost scared.
“Sherlock?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Lestrade!”
“Would you like to enlighten me on what we’re talking about? I still have no reason to understand why you would be upset at me.”
“Sherlock, promise me.”
I am completely basing Sherlock's want of children on the depictions I've seen of him. In each one he seems to have more of a soft spot for children and how how much he gets along with them compared to others around him
“I’m not early Sherlock, you’ve been in the same place while getting high since I left this morning!”
The young merman inched just that bit closer to where their noses nearly touched. The gentle breath he left on John’s lips were enough to send a tremble through his spine. The small whisper that was the man’s voice was the only thing that could draw him in closer to listen.
“Enjoy your nap, Doctor?”
Reading had become common place for his sleepless nights, as it became a nice challenge to help him fall asleep and, in this case, it aided in the task to settle his mind of the events that occurred that morning.
“Oh, hello John. You’re home early…” He stood up with wobbly knees and made his way to the kitchen without another word to his friend.
“John, I’ve regressed. That’s fairly obvious. I don’t want to discuss why I did it, but I did… Can you, can you do me a favour John?”
“What?”
Sherlock still did not move from his position, it was only when John gently tapped him on the forearm that he quickly turned around, hit John in the face with the tie on his dressing gown, and climbed up on the table before he stepped over every piece of furniture they had.
“If you hadn’t spoken to him in the first place, there wouldn’t be any worry of that.”
“John, look at me.”
“If you don’t mind me asking, who are you? I don’t believe we’ve ever been introduced.”
“Hm? Oh, yes, yes I am just fine.” He gave her a small smile that only felt wrong when Mrs. Hudson watched as he instead used his right arm to pick up his cup and took a sip. Which he promptly spit back out with a disgusted look on his face.
“…Stoner. My name is Dr. John Watson.”
As John was soon left in the cabin to himself, he took a moment to lay back down. A small sigh escaped his mouth while looking towards the old wood of the ceiling at the absolute absurdity of the situation, he had barely known the man more than two days and yet they acted more or less like old lovers.
Mycroft finally let out defeated breath and stood up, the impending conversation with John Watson would not be a happy one, but if it would give Sherlock the happiness he had never witnessed within his little brother, then it was worth it. He paused for just a moment to listen as Sherlock made his way into the water and swam away, until the light splashes of water faded with his departure, and Mycroft continued with his own.
Sherlock let out a small sigh as he pressed another kiss to his lips, hoping to convince him otherwise if he held it long enough, but that didn’t seem to work. “I know… I’ll try.”
His hand moved to fiddle with the delicate bracelet wrapped around his wrist, his shaking fingers wandered over the slight details, until he reached the clasp. He could so easily unclip it, throw it as far as he could to allow it to sink into the sea, and move on with his life, as if none of these events ever took place.
He moved away to retreat into the comfort of his own chair, his chin likely purposely rested against his left hand as every so often, John watched as the slightest glimpse of gold along with a shimmering blue stone managed to catch his eye while Sherlock seemingly paid it no mind.
“Our jeweler is able to change out the stone if you would like a different one. That one is just for display.”
Sherlock let out a low groan as this conversation felt so beneath him. Why would John find this an issue? He could not think of one time of hearing John express his annoyance… Or was there a time and he just wasn’t listening?
The building he was soon shoved into was certainly pleasant. The dark polished wood of the fixtures and counters were offset by the heavy red damask curtains that blocked out most of the light that entered the room. Plumes of smoke billowed into John’s lungs as he was led to a standing table by the window, and he glanced out of it for a moment before he turned his attention back to the man who he sat opposite of, and looked to see a cigarette held out to him.
Sherlock’s hand easily slipped into John’s with practiced ease and pulled him along the distance he had likely already covered until it seemed as though they were right behind their fugitive within a moment.
He watched in astonishment as toes were slowly revealed that led to ankles, shins, knees, and thighs all in perfect condition. He dared not to look any further while Mycroft was still breathing down his neck.
Sherlock gave a slight nod as he moved his hand further up his arm, taking moments to glance over him as if it was a game to see where his injury was compared to the nerves in his body. His eyes soon lit up as he placed his palm over his hidden wound, raising an eyebrow to john in an expecting manner to see if he was indeed right.
“Personally, I think something else would look better there than a rope…”
“Are you not going to go with him?”
Mycroft stopped him again before he had the opportunity to become too loud. His hand slipped down from the table, into his coat pocket to pull out a small black leather book that he skimmed through.
“Oh, good lord, this book… I’ve never seen an actual copy of it besides in my professor’s classes. Hardly any copies of this are printed anymore.”
“Hold on.” He stood his ground with his grip still on John’s cuff, his eyes meeting his brother’s own icy gaze as he casually leaned against his umbrella. The object nearly acting as a too thin crutch for him.
“Are you hungry?”
He gained an answer to his questions when Mycroft pulled back to his original position and righted himself once he cleared his throat. “Doctor Watson, I must speak frankly. I would appreciate it if would discontinue your meetings with my brother.”
He took a deep breath and locked his eyes with him, a small smirk grew on his face as he slightly opened his mouth and took the man’s thumb inside. The man’s grip only grew when they were pressed chest to chest.
He refocused his attention to the man still swimming in front of him when some movement caught his eye, and it caught the man’s as well when he stopped his motions to look down at what exactly had brushed against his leg, but he saw nothing.
“Sherlock..” He let out a frustrated sigh and tucked his head underneath the blanket again and began to tug to free his arm. Little by little, Sherlock’s grip slowly loosened until eventually John just wanted to go to bed and forget about tonight, so he wrenched his arm free from his grasp.
Sherlock was on his feet in a moment’s notice, his steps were swift and steady to where he wondered how he hadn’t fallen yet. John was so close to him, just another turn around this corner and he would be in his arms again-
“Your smile. You look like you’re about to fall in love.” -S.Z. // Excerpt from a book I’ll never write
I likely am going to take a break from writing and updating on here for awhile now that I am starting school once again. It just became too stressful last year to keep up with scheduling while maintaining schoolwork, and I feel many things suffered due to it, including my writing. Now, as school approaches and that anxiety hardly lets me see the major issues my writing holds, it has caused the standard I have held for myself to severely drop, and I cannot stand to give you all something that is subpar to what I know I am capable of.
“Well, there are many people that would wish you harm if they found out about you.”
“Hello Mycroft. I’m going to skip the pleasantries since I have a limit and they shouldn’t be wasted on you. Why are you on my ship?”
Mycroft couldn’t help the exasperated sigh that escaped him as he set his glass down and leaned forward, he was already utterly done with this conversation.
John instinctively cleared his throat at the rather impolite choice of words he had chosen, although he hardly expected anything less from this man and this often led to the wondering if he and Sherlock were truly siblings, when he moved to scratch his temple out of nervous habit.
John could hardly contain the scream that wanted to leave his throat as he dragged Sherlock by the arm back to the living room to sit him down in his chair.
“Oh, thank you.”
“How… How did you know I was a doctor?”
“Shouldn’t we get him to a hospital?”
“You have no right,
“it’s a long swim… Unless you would like to sleep underwater, I wouldn’t suggest it.”
“As long as you’re feeling better, I’m happy. Just... try to take of it from now on, alright?...”
John slowly shook his head and wiped away what he tried to pass off as a raindrop on his cheek. “I don’t want to get in the way. I may be a doctor but this is a medical emergency and I’m going to risk Sherlock getting hurt because of me.”
“Sherlock?”
Barely noticeable in the distance due to the morning fog, around 200 meters away, was a ship. A perfectly ordinary site by any means, except for the British Royal Navy flag waving precariously off the bowsprit. It took Sherlock painfully longer than usual, due to his earlier fit, to realize the ship was slowly edging closer to them.
What he instead came home to was the sight of Sherlock sat on the floor, the same spot he had left him when he went to work that morning. Now, with a sleeve rolled up and a small box sat beside him with a syringe inside.
, John thought
“Sherlock, you need to wear these because… Well, it is what society expects of you. I know you may not feel comfortable with it, but it is what it is…”
John watched as Lestrade left his side and joined his crew in their work. He let out a small sigh as he opened the telescope once again to focus his gaze on the ship. He watched it continue to calmly move its way through the ocean, the men scrambling on board, and the one lone figure that seemed unmoving in the frenzied anarchy among the ship.
It was nothing exceptional, and would be considered rather plain to most people who would stay in this hotel, but it was perfectly alright to John as it held all the required amenities. He made his way over to the pedestal sink where he collected a wet flannel to clean himself with. It was there he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror, a perfectly ordinary thing to see on any other day, but when he looked over his sweat stained brow, his flushed face, and the slightly dozy eyed stare he gave to himself, he began to feel… ashamed.
I should quickly mention that these two have a somewhat established relationship in this chapter, but it has been muddled by the issue of John becoming more worried about him, and Sherlock wanting to be more independent in what he does.
“Sherlock- Sherlock, just take a breath for a moment, otherwise you’ll have the entire nursing staff in here.”
“Damn it!”
But he didn’t.
“You think your house is too large and would like to downsize?”
Mycroft began to extend his arm towards him, and took a rather violent grip on his collar. John knew what he would find there if he pulled away his shirt just far enough down to the side. He would see the light teeth marks Sherlock had left on his neck the previous day that still had not faded, and instead only darkened as the day went on. It was something intimate that was only meant for him and Sherlock to see, and that was not about to change due to some ludicrous offer of a house and money.
“What is what?”
John was taken out of his thoughts when he felt a light pat on his back, and he looked to see Sherlock walk away from his side and to his chair. He let out a sigh and went to finish up the groceries, to find them all gone and put away.
“John… Um, this might be difficult to understand but, and if you’ll agree with it, I want to be with you. Fully, not just as we are now.”
Sherlock let out a lack luster chuckle as his hand moved to hold John’s free one. The small jewel on his wrist still shone with all its brilliance, even in the moonlight. “You know I can’t… I would love to, but it’s not possible…”
John was left inside the quiet room to his own thoughts as he undressed and laid down underneath the covers. Why had Greg reacted when he commented on using Holmes’ Christian name? Nothing on this ship made sense to him as he attempted to fall asleep. Finding it easier than usual as there were no drunken men falling on his bed in the middle of the night, no sounds of them touching themselves to the thought of the last girl they’d met in port, just the sound of the gentle waves hitting the side of the ship as he drifted off to sleep.
“Are others aware of your attraction to the male sex?”
fair warning, angst galore along with sarcasm. you know how the Holmes brothers are
He reached into his pocket to retrieve a few quid and handed them to the barkeep. As he made his way to the door, he turned back to Mycroft, who already began to lick his wounds while a few others gathered around him. John hardly had time to get a word in when Mycroft piped up from that crowd that surrounded him.
There they fell asleep in one another’s embrace, the moments before filled with gentle grazes of lips as their hands found their resting place. The only sound in the empty room being the soft breeze of their mingled breath.
John hesitantly sat across from him on the cot, and momentarily questioned whether Greg chose this seating arrangement prior to John coming in based on how much taller Greg seemed compared to him now.
It had been a few hours since they made it to the hospital and it was certainly a productive two hours. Sherlock had been rushed through the ER and transferred into a room to receive a CT scan.
“I should have warned you that running would not be a good idea, but I was under the assumption you already knew that.”
“Sherlock.”
Sherlock turned his back to the table with John’s arms still around him, and he pushed the two of them back until John fell back onto the settee.
He felt a twinge of loss at having to witness his swift and hasty exit until he was greeted with a gentle tap to his shoulder. He grunted and made the effort to stand, his cane irritatingly gripped underneath his digits as he greeted the man behind him with what he hoped to appear as a happy smile.
Smoke continued to billow between them, creating a wall that resembled the smog that often clouded the London streets and gave the roads an ominous feeling. It seemed accurate enough for their current conversation.
“Sherlock, what is wrong? Do you need more sugar?”
“Hmm?”
He merely received a slight shake of the head as Sherlock removed his hands to move in closer to him.
Sherlock promptly fell asleep after that, again, to leave John spiraling in his own head at who Sherlock could possibly love. His parents? John never met them but he would probably never openly say it to them. Mycroft? Lord no, that would probably never be uttered out loud without a therapist present.
“Sherlock, please wake up! Please…”
Victor lifted his head just slightly for Sherlock to see the slightly dazed look that one usually received during a tremendously intimate act, and many tended to become violent if such a process was interrupted, but not Victor. It was another reason he felt so terrible.
>>>>>>>>>
“Yet, there is something that you have wanted for a very long time, it was the reason you came to this beach in the first place, isn’t it?”
>>>>>>>>>>>
“Here's one that's been bouncing around my head, but I have no idea which way to take it: Sherlock Almighty. Obvs would lend itself to crack, but could also take quite a serious turn. Had a thought that maybe Sherlock finds out John or Molly or whoever you ship prays for him... That could lead to something. So anyway, if you wanna take a crack at that, feel free.”  -LondonLioness
The room went quiet after that, with either of them wielding the courage to look back at one another for a good long while.
The delicately made sandwiches and fruits were almost artful and seemed not to be made to eat. It rather reminded them both of small sculptures.
“You have no idea what you are going into, Watson! You are hoping for something to happen that he never can, nor will give you!”
“I’m afraid so, Sherlock. You know how these things are.”
The freezing water enveloped and soaked into his remaining clothing as he took a moment to get his bearings. It was then he noticed a familiar figure swimming towards him; those shifting scales, wild curls, and ice blue eyes that still managed to make him feel warm even in the frosty depths they both had found one another in.
“It’s no problem… That’ll need some ice, otherwise it will swell horribly.”
Sherlock gripped onto the railing as he made his way up onto the roof. The concrete floor was slick underneath his feet, but it didn’t matter as he got his criminal right where he wanted him, he was cornered with nowhere to turn.
“Convince me, Sherlock. Why should I change my mind and let this honestly pathetic human crawl out from underneath my thumb? Why should I let him come back to you with the possibility he will hurt you?”
You are too well tangled in my soul.”
He moved to where he was sitting up more and looked up to him, it was only then that John realized Sherlock’s eyes were closed. “Sherlock, what are you… oh good lord, are you sleepwalking?”
“Just… Can you do that again? Any time I have another one of these episodes, just hit some sense into me alright?”
“Well, there are many people that would wish you harm if they found out about you.”
“My name is Sherlock. meet me here tomorrow, please…”
“Sherlock, no!”
“It’s just a few things I noticed about you… You carry the somewhat atypical dexterity of a doctor; it was fairly easy to see from the way you made the sandwiches and cut the fruit. You also have stitching on your coat that shows a common surgical stitch that you would likely know.”
He returned a soft smile to him until it was driven away by the sound of someone who began to call out to him. John turned towards the voice to see the jovial and familiar face of Mike Stamford that came close to barreling towards him.
“I will take a guess that this isn’t very common among your lovers?”
A young woman soon made her way into the flat and took a seat opposite to John on the settee. once her veil was drawn away from her face, she appeared in a rather pitiable state of agitation. Her face was drawn up and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like that of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were one of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.
His free hand wandered down to undo John’s leather breeches, slipping his hand inside to pull him out of his trousers.
“that is where you are wrong, Dr. Watson. I have been Holmes’ partner longer than you; I have seen more than I have cared to in the many days I’ve accompanied that man and I can tell you that you have no clue what you are getting into.”
This chapter ended up becoming too long to hit, and it made more sense cut it in half as the next section doesn't have much to do with this chapter, but do not worry, I will post the next chapter within a few days and then go back to my normal posting schedule
That vulnerability quickly turned to rage as he shoved at Mycroft to the point, he was nearing the edge of the wood beneath him. “Mycroft, how do you know about him? Did Victor tell you? Ugh, I’m going to kill him-“
“It is perfectly alright Sherlock; it is only fair after I made you wait so long yesterday just for you to give me that lovely gift.”
“Did you go to bed when we agreed you would?”
The door was shut swiftly and without care if his fingers were in the way or not. he backed away from the door, his breathing grew rapid as he scanned his eyes over the room until he focused on the large bay window that drew in most of the light. John threw away the curtains that hid the rest of the world from his room and pushed open the heavy window panes to look down into the rather empty street.
“About what? Sherlock just open the bloody door! You absolutely know why!”
>>>>>>>>>>>>
“For god’s sake Sherlock, I’m not as incompetent as you think to need one of your friends as a spy. I found out through my own means, and since I’m afraid I am too late to ask you to cease your relationship with him before it went too far, I again have taken the situation into my own hands.”
He stood up from his bed and took the two steps to reach the plate. He quietly ran his eyes over the plate without much interest before he picked up the glass of water and drank half of it.
“Oh? Oh, John you shouldn’t have…”
He heard a gentle sigh and the door slowly opened, John swiftly turned away from the doorway and looked into the wall. “I said, leave.”
“Sherlock, you truly don’t mean that, do you?”
All he received was an eyeroll at the mere possibility that Sherlock would be so careless.
They stayed like that for quite a while, the sound of their breathing was the only thing that filled the room.
“For god’s sake Sherlock, do not be so dramatic. He does not mean that much to you!”
“Oh, yeah that would be fine. They’ll likely try and make me sleep that long so that won’t be much time wasted.”
It went quiet for a moment, before Sherlock let out a small sigh and nodded. “Alright.”
“Say it Mycroft. Say it, or I may go much less willingly than you intended.”
Sherlock quickly nodded and continued to pull on his arm. John finally relented and let himself get dragged to Sherlock’s bedroom, as he now shamelessly watched Sherlock walk in front of him before he was pulled into the room, and the door was shut behind them.
“Yes Sherlock?”
“My lad, are you alright? Do you need help?”
Sherlock let out a small sigh as he felt John slip his hand into his own again. He wouldn’t admit that the warmth of his touch calmed him down, even when he could hardly move his fingers.
John walked out onto deck silently as he straightened his coat, and looked around at the large number of men now on board. His focus soon turned to Sherlock who was looking to John over Mycroft’s shoulder.
His first thought was that it was a shipwrecked sailor that had been stranded not far from shore. It was a likely possibility as there seemed to be a large quantity of men that have been found washed upon beaches much like this one. He had just stood from his place on the deck get a better view and potentially alert the authorities, when he looked to the rock again to see that there was no one there.
I absolutely loved this idea and may have overdone it just a bit. I truly hope I captured what you had in mind as it is such an interesting concept to delve into
Other than that, please do suggest anything. Trust me, If I do feel uncomfortable with your suggestion, I will calmly let you know. Though, that likely will not be much an issue.
John then picked up another rock from the small pile he had collected from elsewhere and tossed it with some force into the water. Something was certainly wrong; he had never seen the slightest hint of frustration grace John’s features and it seemed that’s all there was. Could it be because of him?
They soon begrudgingly separated once again for air, finally taking in that the world had not yet stopped but proceeded right along with them, as the muffled shouts and sounds of drunken men came not far away from them. Sherlock looked back to John with laboured breaths and flushed cheeks and looked to see him in a similar situation, the sight gave him a slight boost in his ego as he moved to place his hand on his face once again; somewhat seeking the touch.
“Oh I am incredibly angry, I am possibly more pissed off than I have ever been in my entire life, but that’s not going to get in the way of us dealing with this and talking through it. Not again.”
John was just about to give another retort, when the nurse popped her head in through the entryway with a light knock on the door. A quick warning that John needed to leave soon was enough to make them separate.
Sherlock only responded with a similar motion in kind, his feet soon allowed him to move from his place and begin to walk with John and Lestrade back to their ship. Their sanctuary.
“I wouldn’t step closer, Mycroft. I’m sure you can understand that I enjoy my personal space.” He gave him a slight smirk as he stood up, the movement made Mycroft need to take a step back to keep himself just on the edge of the sword.
“Are you alright dear? Did I add too much milk?”
“You and I have a secret, which neither of us want to get out. A mutual respect of sorts. besides, you intrigue me…”
He could not help but admire the way Sherlock looked him that moment; his curls slightly tousled and still damp from his shower, a few drips of water landed on the man’s angular cheekbones that led his eyes up to his expressive and intelligent eyes that looked so intent and fixed on the task in front of him.
Why? Why was he so different?
“eh… I don’t want to work on Mrs. Minsk’s case… it’s only a four…”
John would likely wait for the guard to make his way closer to him, as the range on his weapon was hardly useful in any other situation. Sherlock would say 20 paces would be where he would raise his weapon.
“John, I really am fine… Thank you.” He wiped away a dried tear from his face with the back of his hand before he rested his forehead on John’s shoulder.
“Yes, I’m sure he will be out in a moment. He just has a bad habit of sleeping in late, I’m afraid.”
He swiftly dove below the frigid water’s surface as John and Lestrade ran to the dock’s edge, only to see Sherlock not resurface and instead began to swim in the direction of the escapee at a rapid speed.
She slipped him a little card that he took a glance at before he slipped it into his pocket and ushered the door closed.
Sherlock slowly turned to look at him, that same smile still on his face as his eyes began to wander over him.
“Miss Helen Stoner, yes I know. I see you didn’t get much sleep on the overnight train; would you care for some coffee or tea? I’m sure Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t mind making you one.”
The pathway back to the dock was mapped with worry and anxiety as John carefully traveled back to it and was relieved to see Sherlock sat at the end of the dock, and calmly ran his fingers through his still soaked curls.
He looked up from setting his bag down and found that he met Sherlock’s eyes for longer than he had for the last week.
John gave him a small smile as he patted his shoulder and stood up. He calmly carried away the cotton pads to throw them out and picked up the phone to order for their favorite restaurant. He hardly noticed when Sherlock ran his fingers over the small cut that graced his face and seemed to let out a relieved sigh.
“What’s going on? Do not tell me you are as daft as you make yourself out to be with that question! The issue is so simple, even
Sherlock let out a small huff and crossed his arms once again, his body finally acclimating into its normal contorted position of really only his torso left in the chair. “Not really, but it was nice to have confirmation of my deductions… Must we do this now?”
“How do you know so much about doctors? Do you have your own?”
“Oh, I have to apologise, this is the first time I’ve been charged with treason so you’ll have to forgive me awhile adjust, you feckless bastard!” He attempted to take a running start towards Mycroft with the intent to hurt him, bruise him, beat him to a bloody pulp until his knuckles were raw and the man in front of him was nothing more than a mangled pile of crushed bone and exposed flesh.
“You’ve absolutely outdone yourself, young man. May I ask what gem this is?”
Sherlock turned to face him as the glimpse of what John could describe as an absolute flicker of passion shown in the man’s eyes as the moon reflected over his pale skin. The look sent the feeling of flutters along his chest, a look that he knew he wouldn’t soon forget.
Sherlock’s home had been ransacked.
John smiled to himself and looked to down to see Sherlock had quickly fallen asleep on his shoulder, which John couldn’t blame him for. He pressed another kiss to his forehead and laid down as well. The covers quickly surrounded them both as they kept the other warm that night.
“I hope this is alright, Sherlock usually likes to make sure everything is a certain way as you can probably tell.” He smiled once again, opening the trunk at the foot of the bed to pull extra blankets from it.
“Ah Sherlock, good morning. It’s quite early for you, isn’t it? Usually, I don’t wake you until nearly noon most days.”
“Sherlock, get out here. I need to talk to you about something.” The layer of rage beneath his voice had to be evident as it seemed too difficult to keep a level tone while he continued to stare at the door.
He made his way into the line to get his rations for the day before he found a place to sit, it was just his luck that Lestrade found him and pulled him over to the captain’s table, saying the man had to speak with him.
No, he was being ridiculous. John would either be there or not. If not, he would just come back tomorrow, yet there still remained a nervous pit in his stomach at the thought of losing the chance to see him again.
This last section is likely to be fairly long while I explain some things
“Sherlock, I just want you to get better is all…”
His eyes were caught when the light from inside of the hotel became visible as a fairly young woman all in black slipped outside and began to pace up and down the small section of road that was seated just beneath his window.
John was quick to rush over to the injured man; placing a cautionary hand on his shoulder should he faint, while leading him to the cot along with the chair in his free hand. He soon took Holmes’ shaking fingers into his own, looking over the injury with scrutiny as he managed to pick out a few of the larger pieces with his fingers. It only became more difficult when he reached for his spectacles and tweezers and began the strenuous process of picking out the leftovers and avoiding the sensitive skin.
A soft tint of red had graced Sherlock’s face since his meeting with John the previous day. Nothing had been accomplished after he returned home as all he seemed to manage was sit on ledge of his bed and watch as his tail lightly brushed against his cave’s floor to push up sand that managed to scatter itself over his belongings. Another thing that would not be cleaned.
“…No, I am not to be engaged, we have only made our acquaintances a few days ago.”
The attempt to play along was slowly waning as he felt his finger move in concentric circles over his throat, his hand slowly trailed up to his face and his thumb rested at the corner of his mouth.
John hardly believed he could take another of his deductions, yet he appealed his request. He soon turned to face the man once again and looked into those eyes of striking blue, which drew him in every chance they could. Holding his attention with care as Sherlock placed his hand on his shoulder once more.
Oh poor John! I'd really love something where John punches the fuck outta Sherlock. Something where maybe Sherlock drugs himself or feels he needs drugs but John punches him and only the pain of getting bruises from his John is what can divert his need for drugs. Like maybe it starts on accident but then he asks John to do it when he's going to inject himself. John gladly obliges because he is so angry at Sherlock hurting himself like that, as well as John liking to carry and help Sherlock with his cuts on his pretty pale cheeks afterward. :D -River_Tam
“Nonsense, Sherlock. Besides, I was thinking of having a clean. The papers on the floor are becoming hazardous to step over with my hip.” She gave him a small smile over her shoulder before she carried a tea tray over to the table beside Sherlock’s chair, while she sat down in John’s with her own cup.
Mycroft finally relented and let his pass. Sherlock could not swim fast enough as he glanced over his shoulder every so often to make sure he was not still there.
He cautioned a glance over to Greg, the utter shock on his face clear as day, especially after their earlier conversation. He let out a small sigh as he shook his head, and turned back to look at the rest of his crew.
“G-od, can we not make this an experiment?”
The absolute variety among the population in London was more than John ever truly expected. With a mixture of straight, low-hanging tails, coiled tails, to short and bushy tails and much more. It was likely a larger diversification among people than he’d probably seen in his life.
Sherlock was then hastily shoved into an empty cabin, the door shut and locked behind him without a second to spare. Tears rapidly made their tumble down his cheeks without giving him even a moment to breathe; his throat was on fire, his gaze hazy as he collapsed onto the floor in front of the door, and silently wept as the world continued just outside around him.
His breathing grew ragged and his head light as his body found its way back onto the floor, his hand moved to cradle his head in the fall as time began to escape him in a dimly lit haze.
Mycroft managed to get the two to move far enough back on the dock so that Sherlock’s tail was now fully exposed to the dry air around them. It was certainly an uncomfortable sensation after having at least some part of himself in water at every moment, which only became worse as he began to dry off and felt a burning sensation run underneath his scales not long afterwards.
John quickly sniffled and did his best to sound much more infuriated than devastated. He did not do a very convincing job. “G… Go away Lestrade! I am not in the mood for another one of your ‘conversations’.”
“Well, thankfully it wasn’t swollen so we don’t to worry about that… Sherlock, you can let go of me now.”
He decided to ignore this spying creature and looked back towards Sherlock, his free hand moved to run over the merman’s exposed back and kept his eyes on the rock. They never left to stone or the person that peeked over it as they laid together on the small, isolated dock in each other’s arms.
I LOVE how not two hours after I posted the last chapter, my computer basically imploded and I needed to transfer everything to a new one. This week has been a stressful one, so hopefully you all are having a better one.
Again, there was no response from him. The only movement that showed he was still cognitive and not off to his mind palace was that he got the kettle boiling and went to grab a cup and milk.
Sherlock gave him a hesitant nod and followed him inside. They both sat on the bed quietly until Victor managed to collect his thoughts.
“… I love you…”
century artist would give to their depiction of the devil, with a long and thin base that led to a spade shaped end. which seemed closely accurate to the man’s own personality.
“Fine! Just give me a moment…” John listened intently as he heard the sound of sloshing water and the light sound of Sherlock walking across the floor to dry off before he made his way to the door.
It was just when he had lifted his head from the water to catch his breath, that he felt a rigid grip clamp upon his ankle, and dragged him down beneath the waves.
Sherlock quickly made his way down the few steps to the lower level of the deck and back to his cabin. The thought of lying down with John for just a few more minutes gave him enough will to quicken his pace.
there.
“Oh, these are lovely… um, what are they?”
John let out a slight huff as he set down his notebook to move behind Sherlock and wrap his arms around his waist. It was hardly surprising to tell that Sherlock had forgone anything beneath his robe. He still hated the feeling of clothes after extended periods of time, and often didn’t wear anything at all when he was given the chance. The robe was really just there for decency should Mrs. Hudson walk in.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck- Sherlock I’m almost” He covered his mouth as he felt his release rushed through him. The overwhelming rush of relief sent shivers through his body that he hardly noticed that Sherlock swallowed his release down without any issue before he slowly pulled off him.
This one however, was the worst of them. A broad, tall man with a constant red face that would never take no for an answer; he’d tried that many, many times.
He took pity on him, as he knew this was something very different to his understanding of intimacy. He pressed a gentle kiss to his lips, and held it for a moment until he relaxed enough to continue. He moved his kisses down his face, pushed away the collar of John’s shirt and nuzzled his nose into the crook of John’s neck.
He gave John another smile as he made his way out of the room, leaving the door open ajar for John to exit when he liked. The decision to leave later was much more welcoming as John sat on the desk, feeling rather boneless after being practically examined under the heavy gaze of a man who could have easily killed him a good while ago. The thought made the blood drain from his face as the possibility was still very likely, he could do anything to anger the man and he’d be thrown over the ledge of the ship. He needed to be careful around him, not to take risks with his attitude again like he just had.
The smallest sound of a whimper from Sherlock had John gripping him tighter within his arms, watching as the man that leaned into his touch attempted to curl in on himself and get away from whatever he was feeling. “Sherlock?”
At least, that is what one would assume if you had chanced a glance through the many openings of his little cave. Books were scattered from alcoves to the sandy floor in a wild and frantic manner, algae candles were tipped over and the mirror that had been kept in the corner was gone, any one person would naturally assume that something sinister had taken place.
Mycroft moved as close as he possibly could to him, a little too close in John’s opinion as his venomous voice rang inside his ears.
“...Holmes, I meant Captain Holmes... I apologise, my mind just slipped a moment.” He looked John in the eyes for an uncomfortably long while before finishing up making the bed. The silence seeming to last for ages until Greg was finished.
John nodded and quickly packed up whatever tools he left out and followed the boy through the many levels until the sun shone bright through the blowing sails above him and straight into his eyes. He recovered quickly to see the crew of the ship scurrying around the deck; much like the rats he’d seen doing the same with the introduction of light upon their dens.
Sherlock calmly waited where he was with what he deemed was the patience of a saint as Mycroft took his sweet time boarding his boat. The man soon found his way in front of him with that same self-entitled expression that he seemed to always have.
underneath his breath once he saw that look of challenge and excitement enter Sherlock’s eyes beneath his mask of pleasantries. He had just reached for his notepad and a pencil, when Sherlock finished his explanation and cleared his throat to return to the main conversation.
“Hoo hoo, there’s a young woman to see you two. She says it’s urgent.”
“mm, most of us would rather have the alternative. We know if we don’t stay around, you won’t touch anything on that plate.”
“Sherlock, please just tell me. “
“…Sherl- Sherlock, who, who do you love?..”
“You were also a soldier as well! I know I said you weren’t prepared to deal with anything like this, but you are a lot more capable than you think, Sherlock knows that probably better than anyone else.”
Sherlock let out a small sigh and took care to hold onto the icepack that was on his head. He leaned back into his chair as John followed him and continued to dab away the blood that attempted to run down his face.
A cruel grin grew on the man’s lips when he watched as the wheels begin to spin out of control in John’s head.
Sherlock hardly seemed to be able to contain his excitement when he awoke the next day.
John kept his hold on the man few longer than usual, the unsettling feeling of Sherlock’s ribs pressing into him more than usual caused him to break their hold. “Sherlock… have they been feeding you here?”
“You were busy with Harry, that was stressful enough for you. I didn’t want to worry you over something meaningless…”
Sherlock couldn’t help but beam at the praise before he went back to his fruit. His head was tilted back to the sea in order to gain some semblance of composure once again as he did not believe he could become so giddy with such simple approval.
Finally, after an excruciating minute of silence between them, Mycroft made the smallest of gestures. One that if you blinked, you would miss it. A miniscule nod in the direction of their ship; an authorization that he could leave and he would not be followed.
He finished what he came in to do and soon left, the level of guilt that already began to build inside of him was too much to witness through a mirror. He made his way back to his bedroom to change into a fresh nightshirt, the full-length mirror that sat in the corner was there to judge him as well, to which he swiftly turned it to face the wall.
“I am sure. it doesn’t give me much interest, and I believe it deserves to be read by someone who will appreciate it.”
Sherlock couldn’t help but smile at the compliment as he went back to his fruit. His head was tilted to the ocean as he didn’t believe he could become so giddy with such praise.
In one languid motion, he raised his sword before he plunged the long thin blade into the peeling floorboards, the sharp sound of cracking wood caused Captain Holmes’ crew to transform from fairly civilised individuals, to blood-thirsty savages as they plundered their way through the ship. Throughout this, John's eyes never left the captain as the man pulled his sword from the wood, turning his back to the chaos to have his eyes lock with John’s once again.
“Watson, may I make another observation?”
John felt familiar shivers run through him at the conflicting heat of his cock in Sherlock’s hand against the cool temperature of the room, instinctively moving his hips closer to his lover’s warmth and letting a strangled groan escape his throat.
“Sherlock, listen to me. What are you on?”
He fervently moved to throw himself against the door again and again. Not stopping until he felt bruises forming on his arm that caused him to slide down the solid oak frame in defeat. He held his bruising arm as his back was solidly held straight by the door, horrible thoughts began to run through his head at the possible fate that was in store for him. What would it be? Keelhauling, lashed to death, burning his hands down to the bone?
He wished John was here. Uncaring of the fact John would either scream for help and bang at the cell door, maybe beat him bloody for his gruesome, immoral acts. It would be funny.
it?" He tried to clarify.
“I believe the correct term is ‘dry erase board’. And I mean:” Sherlock intones and forces himself to straighten up, curiosity blessedly piques past the buzzing hum of diluting anxiousness, oh his chest is still tight. Discreetly coughing past it with an impromptu inhale, he flicks his eyes over John with animated interest, genuine this time. He wants to. “Why are you attending homeroom when your attendance is prospectively taken when you attend your classes to grant you time for rugby practice? Much like the rest of your teammates.”
"Absolutely not. I require an extra opinion." Sherlock silenced the detective's protest with an eye-roll and "An opinion conjured from actual artillery experience. Let us through, Grain."
The breathy request sounded more like a demand. A dozy one at that, and John feels a sudden spark of pride at the lulling effect his massage had in a mere few minutes. John complies to the demand regardless, and relieved. It was… the least he could do.
“Wait—What? But you asked me to—“
“What? Uh, yeah. Absolutely. I mean—“ John stutters, seeming to have expected more resistance. But smoothens over a second later. “of course, of course, you can. Anytime you need to—want to. ”
Sherlock slips the blanket off his shoulders and ambles away, no longer dying. Leaving a blinking John in his wake.
“That doesn’t even—What are you?—“ A sigh. “You know what? I’ll just bring you something.”
Seemingly satisfied with the drop of subject, Sherlock leaned forward to pour John and himself some more tea. "When do you plan to leave? I would suggest you stay here until the blizzard lets up." He prompted with a brief look in Johns direction as he stirred in a sugar cube.
If she’d known he was using it to contact drug-dealers in London, downtown of all places, there’s not a doubt in John’s mind that she would disapprove, hypocritical as she may be. John shook it at Mike in a reprimanding manner, lip quirked teasingly, before opening it.
“No.” Sherlock says simply, promptly taking another puff. Despite the fact he’d just taken one not a moment circa sass.
“Better.” John grins and hands him a ratty, pink pencil with a fuzzy top he’d found on the floor. Sherlock takes it with a politely grateful nod, the most determined air of professionalism he can muster, and sets to work.
"Now." Lestrade affirmed, no dilly-dally. "I'll meet John, you and the team on the roof later, I've still got some panic to quell. The tabloids are going mad."
Upon reaching the living room he crouched down with his back to the wall and resisted the urge to grunt in pain. He half crawled half walked to the edge of the table and peered around it, the light outside reflecting off the wall and allowing John to remain in the shadows. The snow was creating small shadows across the furniture in the room. Then he caught sight of a pale hand dangling over the side of a chair, it had a gun. Suddenly the figure rose. "Bored!" Sherlock aimed the gun at the wall with a flourish and fired. John flinched back; shocked.
The first attempt at sanity had been overridden by Anderson’s inherent imbecility, the physical stifle had been Anderson’s only taken advantage saving him admittedly brutal psychological damage. This was new and unprecedented, thus leaving Sherlock witlessly unprepared. His transport was of no concern to him on the daily, until someone else with unknown intention stepped up to ‘meddle’ for lack of a willingly better term.
John laughed and rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. "Yeah, I suppose that one's my fault." He took a deep breath and turned to their right when Sherlock gave him an 'incontrovertibly,-you-fool' expression. John's hair and clothing rustled when an especially stronger gust blew past. John's face took on a tranquil expression; making him seem younger, at peace,...innocent as if he weren't straddling a mans lap on a rock.
After a moment, John relaxed at Sherlock’s silence, thankful he hadn’t been hit or mentally scarred yet. And went to move around him. It was a little strange. He’d managed to silence one of the most brilliant men he’d ever met with three sentences. John couldn’t help the way his chest swelled a little with pride. Making his half-nude frame stand just  a bit straighter. John brushed Sherlock’s shoulder as he passed, the step momentarily making John’s shoulders level with the apparent-statue’s, and added, “Tickets are expensive you see?”
. Sherlock knows he could, it’s guttural roars pound his core. But he’s weak here, and his chest still encases the rage in aggrieved ice. Leaving him cold and flinching. “Gonna cry?”
“Are you quite sure you’re all right—“
John decided he'd had enough and made to snatch the gun from him, briskly crossing the few feet between them. Much to his confusion, Sherlock allowed him to take the gun easily. "Alright, hands up, you bloody psychopath!" John spoke sternly and aimed the gun at him.
“Fine,” Sherlock growls and shifts to face him in his Indian position, hands going down to grip his own ankles in a steadying grip. An icy glare bores into his own perplexed one. “But you asked so don’t you dare deck me afterwards.”
Sherlock's keen gaze hadn't left them once.  John was cradling the corpse's head in his hands, already having determined the bullets starting point, and was peering into the mayor's wound. His face was uncomfortably close to the clammy, cool face of Abramson's, his lips nauseatingly parallel to his as he measured the distance between the entrance and exit wounds with measuring tape.
“No,” He announces patiently, exclusive training was going so well. Always unexpected, just what he did and didn’t need. “it’s called ‘teamwork’.” The miffed correction was made as John folded another sweater, his back still turned to Holmes. “Not that you’d know anything other than its definition.”
John decided he'd had enough and made to snatch the gun from him, briskly crossing the few feet between them. Much to his confusion, Sherlock allowed him to take the gun easily. "Alright, hands up, you bloody psychopath!" John spoke sternly and aimed the gun at him. In return he received an extremely condescending and somewhat pitying look, although Sherlock complied.
“You smelled of bread and tea upon your delayed arrival—“
Fair enough, not a lot of people wanted to pass their mayor's corpse on the way to their neighborhood Tesco's. At least the street had been blocked off. Sherlock sniffed, the cool November air already biting at his nose, and pointed an accusatory thumb at John. "Blame him."
Then it hit him, he looked up. "How do you know my name? I never told you a smidge of information about my person."
Sherlock didn't spare the man a glance. Nor a word. And stepped away, closer to the slouched corpse, his finger curled beneath his chin in thought.
“…work.”
Mike was a rather thick and stocky fellow. And he was strong, don't get him wrong, but his resolve was pretty weak. John gave him a small convincing smile. "Yeah, I'll be fine." He spoke quickly, there were drugs to be dealt and he didn't want them getting antsy. He'd seen addicts, he knew how far they'd go for a hit and what happened when they didn't get what they wanted when they wanted it. The last thing he needed was Mike holding him up, lest he face the wrath of their little habit. "See you in a few days, Mike."
“Except dying. Heart surgery and all.”
"No." Sherlock replied simply, as though he were vocally righting a crooked frame.
“Adler
So outside he stayed.
She brushed a few stray hairs from her eyes. "I got a pretty good look at you then, yes." Then she shook her head a little, looking a little upset as though remembering something troubling. "Poor thing looked scared to death when he dragged you in."
John’s tongue clicks on its own accord, though the appendage seemed tired too. And exhales down at nimble feline seemingly made of rubber. Seemingly uncaring of his very close roommate practically fondling him to the wall after tossing him onto his bed. Seemingly unaware of any and all implications this would pose to the greater public.
"What's wrong? Bachelor's lifestyle not treating you well?"
He knocked again for good measure.

rears. And gives his head a teensy, sharp shake and squeezes his eyes tight, then smoothens his face calmly, reassuring. All in the span of a second. Only to find it useless as he peers up to find the slouching, taller boy looking past his shoulder with a disconcertingly blank look on his face. The light filtering past in geometrical planes of bright color over his features not earing a mere flinch or flicker of iris.  So similar to his general demeanor one wouldn’t tell the difference, but to John’s astute eye he was different. Far different. From the diminutive drooping of pale lids veined with burst capillaries and shoulders riding low on pompous, silver-wit. He wasn’t thinking either, John doesn't know how, but he could tell. There was no scrunch to his carefully groomed eyebrows indicating deep concentration and ever-deepening stupor, no lids shut-tight to keep his prim calculation concealed from the painfully disproportionate world he found so dull yet worthy of everyday brooding.
“John!” Finally, a decent human being he hasn’t pissed off yet.
John ran.
So you can imagine his surprise when he’s tapped on the shoulder, after class hours no less, and the world having previously fallen on deaf ears from the earplugs he’d dug into his canals. The Hearse song’s intro was beginning to leak through.
He pants once more, seeing a white cloud waft to eye-level and beyond, and thinks it's actually fire.
"And to say thank you, I honestly don't know if I'd be here if it weren't for you. I'm forever in your debt." A little corny but he was feeling particularly self-loathing and maybe a little frustrated at the moment. This man had done nothing wrong. If asking for entitled privacy and being rude in retaliation for being tortured weekly was wrong, then John's casual abuse of assisting shopkeepers at Tesco's be damned. Well...double-damned.
John blew a frustrated breath out of his nose. "Why don't you sit this one out?" John suggested, watching Mike switch his weight from one foot to the other, his pocketed hands twitched with impatience.
Sherlock looked down at John and nodded to the shrub-clad male. "Bullet, Anderson? And I take it you've kept the mayors head in its exact position since its unfortunate leister?"
Sherlock slumps. “Waste of money.” It sounds like a question.
John felt his chest freeze up a bit. Alarmed that all he'd had to do was conduct some simple math to be welcomed in so easily. Apparent colleague or not. Greg must have trusted Sherlock more than he let on, or he was a shit inspector. It made him fear for the institution's security for a moment. Until his rationality kicked on and told him this was a terrible, horrible, very not good thing for a criminal to involve himself in. What had he gotten himself into?
Sherlock plucked the cigarette from his lips, holding the smoke in his lungs until they burned. Either from asphyxiation or the nicotine. And exhaled slowly, grinding the smoldering cigarette bud into his left forearm. He felt it. The pain instant, a shock. But Sherlock didn't hesitate in his ministrations. The skin burned and blistered, browning and blackening from the ash and the heat. Both probably. He wasn't sure which trounced which. He just felt it.
"AHHHH!"
John aimed a content grin up, but it slowly slacked at what he saw there. Sherlock's translucent gaze squinted at him almost adoringly. Eyes smiling more than his pursed mouth, as though he didn't want to show too much. It took his breath away for a moment.
"Well, yes. But you don't seem like the type to offer hospitality so casually."
Nor will a single tear fall, this would make for great practice. Would be a waste, such an opportunity didn't rear its head everyday. And Sherlock's always loved a good challenge.
Long since calloused from the
edition of Art Through The Ages, an electric pencil sharpener, and a snickers bar. Because he’s not at his brightest when he’s starving to death
fun. He thought impishly.
Sherlock squeezes his eyes closed as another gust wracks him with a bodily shiver, grip on the bars growing impossibly tighter until his hands really do seem to rip, and exhales deep and slow. He couldn’t feel his hands at all, it’s like his hands were merely keeping him grounded by muscle memory. And wasn’t that a thought.
The man moved so quickly he fell into a plastic tree.
Risin' up, back on the street~
Oh, it most certainly was.
Sherlock eyes the assuring hand. “Sure.”
Finally, Sherlock broke the silence. "Sentimentality is a disadvantage, a chemical defect found on the losing side, and it will kill you. You live a dangerous regimen, Watson. It's only a matter of time before it stabs you in the back...or shoots you in the shoulder."
Bombshell, more like.
You trade your passion for gloOory~
Sherlock's keen gaze hadn't left them once.  John was cradling the corpse's head in his hands, already having determined the bullets starting point, and was peering into the mayor's wound. His face was uncomfortably close to the clammy, cool face of Abramson's, his lips nauseatingly parallel to his as he measured the distance between the entrance and exit wounds with measuring tape.
Sherlock hadn’t counterintuitively influenced John with Bystander effect or stimulated some outreach-type complex that time. He had his back turned to John after a painfully abrupt turn to him after John’s fingers got just a bit too ticklish, a bit too close. Sherlock had barely held back a groan of unadulterated hurt at the movement, he was still tender from the Irish Green Shower incident—nothing more nothing less, not at all. Though John had soon soothed his pain away with benevolent hands that made Sherlock briefly reconsider his atheism.
"Carrie, you might wanna take a look at this." Daryll looked at the screen warily as the eerie figure passed through the hallways in a fast pace. Carrie came over not a second later and leaned over the desk on her hands, causing the fabric of her blue dress shirt to rustle and observed the computer with her mouth set in a grim line. She opened her mouth and closed it again. "Does...does his mask say 'criminal'?" Daryll blew out a frustrated breath. "Well duh." She fixed him with a glare with her dark brown eyes. "We need to call the police."
In the end, he resolved to stop making any effort to think, and stared blankly ahead – even though that only made him more aware of the pitiable state of his ‘transport’ and all its pains and cramps.
John.
“I offer ten thousand pounds to the man who can say where my son is. I hope that is a good enough incentive to try your very best, Mr Holmes.”
Now smiling and looking pleased, Sherlock made to don the coat hanging by the door. “Precisely. Clever one aren’t you? Only took you ten minutes.”
“Once in a lifetime.”
Sherlock regarded him lazily. "I heard you fall out of bed."
Sherlock, looking dazed, peered up at his assaulter. Appearing...resigned, Sherlock sighed and stood. Brushing nonexistent dust from his button-up haughtily.
Sherlock just glared right back, only accentuating it with a disbelieving scoff. A true drama queen if John ever met one. “I’m sure your forty-year old
Exhaling sharply, irate glare still in place, Greg tapped the glass of his wrist watch, making rapid little clicks. "
---------------------------------------------------------------------
“Well, of course not.” Sherlock defends, hands coming up to blow into his palms. “They have an excuse.”
Sherlock threw up his hands. "I can! I'm not surprised by your average intellect, I don't know why I suspected more." Sherlock threw a glare his way accompanied with a shake of his head. "After all, who in their right mind would meet up with a lot of druggies in alleyway
Did my time, took my chances~
“Sorry, little busy right now.” His rush of determined awkward is so disproportionate from Sherlock’s apparent tragedy John wants to bash his head into the locker in front of him. But just stays on his knees, arms sure and leaning over to  cuddle the reluctant pole.
"How much did you see?" John asked as he fixed his mildly blurry gaze on Sherlock's pale one.
Well, at first. Now it’s congealed into a rather formidable iceberg he’s taken impressive care to steer clear of.
Otherwise, he’d be a desperate, sniveling mess of aborted, weakened attempt after aborted, weakened attempt until he’d wrung himself dry. A gradual rise to achieve a certain level of calm and center was necessary between each try. This he’d learned by now, under rather extremely fleeting and developing circumstances. Panic is a lie. And Sherlock was out of practice, lesson flunked, and now all had failed. Leaving him flinching at the memory of a newfound Achilles heel as his stomach twists itself into tangible knots, making him wonder if he’d need surgery after the nauseating sensation abated.
, Sherlock wants to drone, but holds his tongue. “You never told me your age though.”
He enjoyed the way shock spread across Johns features, although he couldn't say the same for how he quickly repressed it. "An addict." John spoke in a clipped tone.
"Hello, Sir." Sherlock greeted. The man was shorter up close, he noted in amusement.
Sherlock lets out a breathy ‘oh’. The sound soft and shocked. It strikes a cord in John, and he grinds the cigarette to gritty bits at the implications of it.
Sherlock had also heard his screams long enough to be able to decipher whether anything was wrong. Should he need to intervene. He lightly shuddered at the memory that decided to rear its ugly little head. John's broken and battered form bleeding onto the concrete. His expression so resigned yet... For some reason, the memory pained him more now than it had before. How dull.
Slowly, raw unimpressment etched itself into John’s rapidly aging features. “You can’t be serious.”
Sure, in the short span he’d spent with Sherlock, he could tell how seriously he took his job- consultancy. “Then why do you need
Sherlock almost winced aloud at the irony. But it was better to have Gavin know now than have him find out later.
"Jay! ...what the hell, man?" He trailed off as he caught sight of John. "Showing this punk a lesson." Jay roughly shrugged out of his grip and glared at him. "Get back in the van and start the engine." The kid looked uncertainly at John and back at Jay and the other two guys. "Guys-guys come on we don't need to do this. Let's just go, we've got the-" One of the other men shouted without looking away from John. "Get back in the fucking van, Kyle!" His fists were clenched at his sides, eyes wide and manic. God, he seemed worse than the first one. "Or maybe you could take his place?" He suggested, sickly grin on his face daring him to.
After a few more deafening bangs echoed John realized he wasn't being shot at and cautiously rose to peek over the bed and around the room. He was alone, god his heart couldn't take this much stress. He approached the chipping door warily as memories started coming to. John gasped as a sharp pain shot through his torso when he reached down to use the bed frame as leverage. "Jesus Christ." He hissed through clenched teeth, reaching down to hold the bed frame with his other hand and wait for the pain to recede while he stared down.
It seemed strangely intimate for a brother and sister, Lestrade thought with the beginnings of a grimace. Making another right he knocked on her office door. Gavin just walked forward and grasped the doorknob with a half grin aimed at him. "I've got it from here, thanks." The grin and wide dark eyes made him uneasy but he knew Carol could handle herself, she couldn't have earned her rank without the possession of certain abilities. Gavin winked at him once more and let himself into the office. He waited until he heard talking on the other side and listened as the two traded courtesies. Convinced that no one was going to die, Lestrade made his way back to his office with a shake of his head, barking the occasional order to one agent or another. Today the mayor of London, Charles Abramson, was going to be transported to the glided state coach by car any moment now. The U.S Secret Service agents, the officer transporting him, and most of London was already prepping for the parade.
