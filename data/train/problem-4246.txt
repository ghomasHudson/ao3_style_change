Dean shook his head, a wry smile on his lips. “I’m sure you’ll find some other use for a spare room.”
“Stop right there,” Dean said, shaking his head, “because that’s not true. Whatever I did, I did because I wanted to. Because I’d do anything for that kid.”
Mary opened the door before Dean even lifted his hand to knock.  “Saw you from the front window,” she explained, then let them in.
So there they both sat on Cas’s bed - Dean with his legs under the covers and Cas sitting at his hip, with Sam the mediator on the phone between them. “I was going to eventually,” Dean said to the phone sullenly.
Dean grabs a beer from the fridge. He looks at it, looks into the fridge, then looks at Cas. Cas knows from years of experience that Dean’s going to crack a joke, and he does: “Is that your only requirement for a roommate? ‘Must not murder me’?”
life.  At the most, he’d expected he would have to smooth away some of the awkwardness that usually came with first dates, maybe fluff Charlie’s feathers a little bit and boost Aaron’s ego, make them look good for the other.
The call ended.  Dean stared at the display until it winked out and all it was was a hunk of metal sitting in his palm.  He pocketed it and turned to his door, keys in hand, trying to quell the frustration of unanswered questions.  Maybe he should call his mom back.  Or maybe he should call Cas and see if anything had changed between him and Daphne since Dean had last called.
Cas had called a few hours prior and canceled their movie night. “It’s our busiest season, and one of my accounts hasn’t met participation, so I have to work into the weekend. I apologize, Dean.”
“That turn you on, babe?” Dean breathed, delirious, laughing a little.  “That I’m yours?  That you’re gonna have this forever?”
Dean broke down their conversation, and Sam made sounds of irritation at the appropriate parts.  Dean supposed he deserved it.
“My position?  You mean Special Agent Novak’s personal stepstool?  Aiming for the director’s spot, are you?”
Cas, however, did not put his weapon away immediately.  He watched Dean for a moment or two longer, looking for any sign of ulterior motive.
“You brought something,” Cas accused.  He stepped aside from the door and frowned at Dean, even though it was Christmas Eve and Dean smelled divine.
“Take your time,” Cas said. Dean heard a cabinet opening. “Feel free to take a shower. I’ll leave some clothes by the door. There’s a fresh toothbrush here too.”
“I apologize,” Cas said to Sam. “Jack might have destroyed a few blooms.” He opened his palm and offered the crushed red blooms up for inspection. It could have been Dean’s bloody heart for how much he was hurting.
Cas stilled. He listened. He had a feeling that it wouldn’t just be the flickering street light outside his window keeping him up tonight.
Dean took his time sipping the first of the bottles while he watched Cas watch him from across the apartment. Cas hadn’t bothered to turn on the TV, so all they could hear was the soft patter of footsteps from the apartment above. The silence was not uncomfortable, but Dean was surveying him oddly between sips of his drink.
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Thanks for reminding me.  You know, you could have fucked it all up, following me up there like you did.”
“That’s not how mortgages work, Dean,” Cas said, though he did concede some of Dean’s points with a sip of his beer.
Being called a youngster at 33 was hilarious to Dean, but Sam, already situated on the blanket with Willow in his lap, gave him a reproachful look for not joining them on the blanket.
Cas wakes up first.  He makes the coffee.  Then he skims through the news on his phone while he waits for Dean to wake up and start breakfast.  They didn’t plan the arrangement: it came about only because Cas never ate breakfast and Dean figured out very quickly that if he wanted food in the morning he’d have to make it himself.
Not for the first time, Cas had to bite his tongue. Even with his greasy hair and tired eyes, Dean Winchester was beautiful. Cas turned away, always careful. “I’ll start up the shower. Don’t take too long feeling sorry for yourself.”
It was barely 15 minutes later that his eyes caught the elevator lights behind his monitor, indicating someone was headed to the floor above his office.  Cas was instantly on the alert; there was only one office on that floor, and it was the director’s.  He was on his feet and grabbing his gun from his drawer almost without realizing it.
)  So eventually, after downing his first glass of whiskey and seeing that Gilda had more or less finished her drink off as well, he caught her eye and nodded toward the bar.
Dean, smirking, offloaded the six-packs into the fridge.  Cas handed the last one to him.  It felt like a win, like a sign of good things to come, so when he straightened and closed the fridge door, he held his hands out, nodding to the mess of ingredients on the counters.  “C’mon,” he said, “Give her to me and Cas.  You finish up here.”
Dean was next to Cas, depositing fresh donuts in the display. He straightened when he heard the question. The smile on his face was pleasant but brittle. “He’s as good as one,” he said before Cas even had a chance to open his mouth. “Have a good day, ladies.”
Cas presses a kiss to the tender skin under Dean’s eye.  He feels Dean’s amused breath on his chin.  He lingers.  He delivers the next line next to Dean’s ear: “I don’t feel like going to the party.”
He doesn’t say anything, but once they get into the car and wipe down their hands with antibacterial wipes, Cas heaves a huge sigh.  Dean looks at him, and his eyes are gentle.  They don’t speak on the ride home and eventually Cas’s heart begins to calm.
The moment was gone, the only trace of it left as an imprint of warmth on Cas’s side. “I’ve just tasted half of your menu, Dean,” Cas reminded him. “I don’t think I’ll be eating anything for a long time.”
Cas smiled and hid his face in Dean’s neck. After a pause, he said, almost shyly, “By the way. Since we’re doing things all out of order.”
“Never better,” he whispers, leaning forward.  The hand he has on Cas’s cheek slips to the back of Cas’s neck.
So Cas showered. He put on a nice pair of jeans and comfortable shoes and a blue button-down shirt that he supposed would bring out his eyes. By the time he was ready, he felt almost… good. He’d decided halfway through his shower that he would enjoy this time with Dean, but also that he’d put an end to their potential relationship by the end of the night if Dean didn’t do it himself.
Dean tried to remember what was next on the script he’d rehearsed. Belatedly, he held up what was in his hand, though his nerves made his movements stiff. “Brought this, though.”
Dean rubbed a hand over his chin. His throat bobbed. “Well,” he said. “I—I’m not sure how much you think you’ll be making—”
Cas covered his face with his other hand.  “I’m so sorry, Dean,” he whispered in mortification.  “I can’t believe I let myself fall asleep.”  He looked around again.  “What time is it?”
this weekend but he hasn’t been answering my messages.  I think he blocked me on social media, too.  Do I - uh, need to know anything?”
It should have been humorous, but instead it felt like a stone fell into the pit of Cas’s stomach. When he spoke, he couldn’t will his voice any louder than a murmur. “I like your brother, but I just couldn’t see it going any further than just a few dates. Without going into details, I think I did him a favor.”
and one day when Aaron called while Dean was driving, Cas had let out a frustrated breath, snagged Dean’s phone from his hand, rolled down the window, and tossed it out without a word.
Dean faltered on the back step at the sight of Cas’s blue eyes watching him.  His heart felt like it stopped for a moment or two, but then it picked up its pace five times faster.
“I’m sure he’d be happy to hear that,” Sam said. He slung his messenger bag over his head and adjusted the strap. “Even before the party he’d always mention how interesting your last conversation with him was.”
VIII. 	 The week leading up to Dean’s birthday was tense, not least because Dean’s safehouse had been compromised and the director, in clipped tones over the phone, had informed Cas that she expected him to volunteer to house Dean until another safehouse could be secured.  Cas had accepted the proposal, though it had filled him with dread.  Dean, too, had accepted this pronouncement, a sullen shrug his only real reaction.  Cas knew that other things had been bothering Dean at the time, but those other things were things Cas could not help with.
Dean shook his head.  “I get it,” he murmured.  “It’s fine.”  His throat bobbed.  He licked his lips.  “Can I - “ He didn’t finish the question.  He leaned in instead and waited, his breath unsteady.
“Yes, Mom,” Dean mocked, but he already sounded a little less nauseous, so Cas didn’t bother getting upset with him.
By the time the water was hot, Dean - still shirtless - was walking slowly into the bathroom, his eyes squinting in the early morning sunlight streaming through the window. He had the clothes Cas picked out for him in one arm. With his free hand, he clapped Cas on the shoulder. “Thanks, dude.”
“You want me to hurl again?” Dean asked, raising his eyebrows. There were bags of fatigue under his eyes. Still, he looked wonderful in Cas’s clothes.
He shouldn’t have looked at Dean, but he did.  His eyes caught the twist of Dean’s lips.  “You haven’t been out of the house or office in weeks,” Dean said derisively.  “You expect me to believe you?”
Cas pointed to the dining table. He’d gone to the corner store for some Gatorade while Dean was in the shower. The fresh air had helped clear his head, but the sight of Dean tired and shower-warm made Cas’s throat a little tight. He swallowed down his nerves. “You’re dehydrated. Drink some of that, then go back to bed.”
“No, it isn’t,” Dean said, so vehemently Cas sloshed cream over the rim of his mug and looked at Dean, startled.  Dean put a hand up to steady Cas’s nerves and walked to him.  He took the creamer from Cas’s hand and put it to the side.  “Look, Cas.  What I said just now?  Dumb.  I’m your best friend, dude.  Maybe not the
Cas smiled, capped the ketchup, and turned to join Sam and his coworkers, conscious of Dean’s eyes on him as he left, and - oddly enough - relishing it.
Cas’s eyes were shining, his lips pressed tightly together. “When I said I wanted to date you, I didn’t think I’d end the day being engaged.”
In the silence of the kitchen, the words sound absurd.  Cas’s lack of response solidifies Dean’s embarrassment and it becomes alive, a wriggling thing under his skin that he’s desperate to get out.
that he had referred to earlier, as if Dean and Aaron were… a couple.  God, Dean was an idiot.  “I’m not friendly.  I was flirting with her.”  And God, Dean was a
The kiss was tentative - a test.  Cas understood that three years of friendship were being trod upon for this moment, so he trod carefully.  It didn’t stop elation from flooding his veins when, as he broke away, he saw Dean chase after the kiss for the barest second.
There’d been no hesitation in Dean’s words. Cas bit down on a pleased smile. “Don’t tell me you’ve only been coming in to your own business see me.”
Dean laughed as he searched for a knife.  “I drove here from Lawrence, Kansas - if anything, I’m bothering
Dean reached out to touch Cas’s shoulder but thought better of it. He put the stack of paper on the table in front of Cas instead. “Cas,” he said gently.
“Fuck,” Dean said helplessly.  His other hand came up to grip Cas’s hip.  “Are you sure, Cas?” he asked urgently.  “Really sure?”
Dean suddenly wanted to crawl into bed and pull the covers over his head.  He definitely didn’t want to talk to Cas.  “Hey.”
.  He had no idea what he’d done or said.  Sure, he’d been a dick, and sure, he’d been doing it on purpose, but it was no more than he usually was around Cas, and Cas was generally just as much as a dick to him as well.
Cas put a bracing hand on Dean’s shoulder. They were standing at the shopfront, looking at the glass door, freshly etched with Winchester Bakery’s logo. “You’ve looked at the numbers a dozen times, Dean,” Cas said. “Sam and I looked at them with you. Even the bank looked at them. You’ll be fine.”
Eventually Dean turned to him, putting his hands in his coat pocket and looking over Cas’s shoulder at the door to the house - anywhere but at Cas’s face. “Guess we didn’t get to do the whole New Year thing, did we?”
Dean pushed the pie away from the edge of the counter and stepped in a little closer, making Cas’s stomach flip.  “Am I just your delivery boy, then?” he teased.
Cas sighed over the line.  “Very well,” he said.  “I’ll think about what you said.  But I am still taking her with me when we go out next week.”
Cas had been wiping the display case of fingerprints. He met Dean’s eyes—wide, taken aback—then looked away, mortified. He felt a flush creeping up his neck.
Dean watched as the redhead bid a final goodbye to Sam - he had to bend, and she was stretched to her tiptoes - and then walk away.  She tripped on a stray chair leg, then looked around to see if anyone saw.  Her eyes caught Dean’s.  She smiled sheepishly, then turned away.  ...Then she bumped into Cas and immediately started frantically apologizing.
Cas doesn’t answer.  He continues to survey Dean.  There is no expression in the set of his mouth, and his eyes are unreadable.  “You wanted… to kiss me.”
Cas insisted on taking him to every appointment, even though Dean only ever rolled his eyes at every new house they saw.
From up close Cas could see the depth of Dean’s laugh lines, the shape of his freckles, the exact colors in his eyes.
Cas knew that the Roadhouse was a bar and grill just off the freeway, but that was about it. “Haven’t been,” he said.
Dean knew better than to argue when Cas was like this.  He got up.  Eileen grabbed his hand just for a moment and squeezed, and though Dean appreciated the gesture, it didn’t bode well for the conversation he was about to have with Cas.
The breath Dean released rose up as steam in the freezing air. “It’s kind of a plan that should have happened at midnight.”
“Just wondering why you don’t take it,” Dean said, maybe a little too gruffly, because Aaron looked at him with a frown.
Despite himself, Dean found himself drawn into the conversation. “I was thinking it’d be better if the line went ‘
Cas nodded, his hands locked together on the table like he was at a job interview. “I’ve got enough to sustain me through a pretty lengthy job search. My accounts are still paying dividends, too, so I’m not completely without income.”
His phone rang.  He answered it even though he knew he shouldn’t, but it was Dean’s name on the screen and Cas had never ignored Dean’s calls.
Dean scowled.  It wasn’t a nice emotion, irritation, but it was at least better than the sadness Dean had wallowed in immediately following his epiphany.  “Finally answering
Cas was swirling the whiskey in his glass around. His gaze and voice didn’t falter when he said, “And what do you think?”
The apartment building is nice but painfully far from Cas’s.  After almost three months of living with Dean, the concept of having him almost an hour away makes Cas feel sick.
I’m not perfect, and I know I lecture you more than I should and I’m always irritable, but - “ He sighed, and God, this time it was the most beautiful sound in the world.  “I need to know,” he continued, voice beseeching, eyes wide, “do I really not have a chance?”
They approached his car, and Dean opened the passenger door for Cas too. Cas didn’t enter right away. They stood with the car door open between them, Dean’s expression so openly hopeful it made Cas’s chest hurt. “This doesn’t change what I said before,” he said, because he had to.
It turned out that Dean had a pleasant singing voice. It was late, and as they traveled on the freeway and Cas admired the lights and shadows playing across the angles of Dean’s face, Dean sang along softly to the radio, and when he caught Cas smiling at him he sang even louder.
Cas turned to the table and wrapped his hands around his coffee. It was lukewarm by then.  “Dean, I care for you.” It was the understatement of their friendship, but Cas had learned over the course of their five years together how easily Dean spooked at affection.
“I recall saying something along those lines,” Cas confirmed, throat tight. His eyes were starting to sting, but he refused to look away.
A tense moment passes.  There’s still enough space for either one of them to laugh it off, but then Cas reaches out to touch Dean’s face.  He watches for a reaction, for some sign of disgust or hesitation, but all he sees is surprise, a touch of awe, and when he feels Dean’s hand fall lightly to his waist, Cas takes that as a sign to lean forward.
Mary smiled at him, oblivious to the tension.  “Hey,” she said.  “Sit down.  Cas was just saying he was gonna go off on a writing trip.”
The want is not new. What is new is the sour feeling in his gut knowing that everything he wants is only
Dean’s mouth twitched upward.  “Oh, so when you called me out about the flirting, it was because you were jealous?”
They went back to browsing. The lady at the register was buying a basket-load of books, and the line only grew behind her.
When Dean arrived, he saw Cas’s car already parked in front of Sam and Eileen’s home and steeled himself for an awkward night if none of Sam and Eileen’s other guests showed up for a while.
When the news breaks, Dean and Cas’s eyes connect over Cas’s tiny kitchen island.  Dean is standing over a pot of chili.  There’s an empty bowl in his hand.  Cas is perched on his secondhand stool with a chili stain on his collar.
Amara Shurley nodded at him.  “Special Agent Novak, this is the new assignment we spoke about.”  She looked at Dean, who bristled a little.
“Because you didn’t want to expose a felon to one more scandal?  What difference would it have made?  Hypothetically speaking, you’d have cleaned up the bureau of a corrupt director if you’d exposed them. Ain’t exactly a bad thing.”  Bobby let Cas mull it over for a few more moments, then he added, “Y’see, you don’t actually believe what you’re trying to sell me.”
It’s not as if Cas hadn’t had time to prepare for this.  It had only been a few days, yes, but 72 hours should have been more than enough to prepare an FBI Special Agent for this assignment.
Cas put his hand on the door handle. “Have a good night, Dean,” Cas said to his chest. It felt hollow and insensitive, and Dean’s name in his mouth felt too sharp. He opened the door and left Dean alone in the car.
His eyes adjust.  He looks more closely.  And he notices that the door is open.  Dean stares.  His door is never open.  He shoves down the hope threatening to spill over.
“We should have seen this coming,” Cas sighed.  “He was always attracted to you, but neither of us wanted to see it.”
“Not helping,” Dean said, then bit his tongue when he noticed Cas breaking away from Mary to approach him.
the sleep-deprived dick in this scenario?” Dean rasped, having lifted the pillow from off of his face to glare at Cas in the doorway.
“Is it?” Cas said.  “She’s admired you since the day you met.  She hangs on your every word.  Is it so hard to imagine that someone might feel that way for you?”
Dean paused. His grin grew slowly. He stepped even closer, though Cas hadn’t thought it possible. “You like me in an apron?” Dean asked, suppressing a laugh.
The uncovering of Cas’s skin took Dean’s breath away.  He was tan and lean and as beautiful as Dean had always known him to be.  The idea that all of this skin was Dean’s to touch was overwhelming.
The business trip was only supposed to last a week, but a hurricane knocked out the power for most of New England and stranded Cas in his Boston hotel.
Cas refilled their glasses once he got to the couch and sat down next to Dean.  One of Cas’s neighbors was blasting Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” and apparently Dean began humming along.
They stared for a long moment, then another, then another. Dread, mortification, shame - it all formed a horrible lump in Dean’s throat, and the longer Cas just stared at him, the harder it got to breathe.
XI.  	Cas could tell there was something on Dean’s mind just like he had always been able to tell, but nothing good could come out of anything that Dean wanted to say - at least not anymore.  If it was bad news, it was bad news.  If it was good news, it was still bad news.  Dean was a felon.  Dean was not his best friend.
Cas indulges in a pleased smile because he knows Dean can’t see it.  He returns to the cupboard.  By the time he’s gotten the ingredients gathered, Dean has gotten the bowls and cutlery, the pot and the stirring spoon. He arranges them on the kitchen island, then steps away.
“Feels like it’s been a while, boy,” Bobby said, looking at him through critical eyes.  “You lose weight?  You seem tense.”
made Eileen put a hand over her mouth.  “Oh,” she said, her eyes suddenly very round.  Her lips trembled a little when she smiled, but Dean had very little time to contemplate it before she was throwing herself at Dean.  “Big brother,” she said from somewhere around his chest, “You made a good choice.”
Dean’s smile was pleased, a little bashful. He was suddenly very interested in the act of peeling off a corner of the label on his beer bottle. “You’re gonna charm me out of my socks, Cas.”
Aaron Bass called that night just like he said he would through his email.  Dean wasn’t feeling up to socializing, not after more than a few beers and making up with Cas (welcome, but also emotionally trying) but he’d committed to this mission and he would see it through.  He was, however, sleeping in the guest room with Cas in the same bed, so stealth was necessary.
“Give him a chance,” Dean said, then walked away before the man had a chance to respond. With any luck, Dean knew, the guy would find the note scribbled hastily on the back of the front cover:
He’d hoped to have left his carefully-kept wishes locked safely in the bedroom, but he looked up upon shutting the door and found Dean at the stove, looking like every dream of domestic bliss he’d ever had, except also in a robe and fuzzy bunny slippers.
Cas’s surprise was obvious, but it lasted no more than a second before he was kissing back. The hand that made its way to Dean’s jaw was freezing but Dean just kissed harder in response. He wanted everything Cas could give him: the hot, the cold, and everything in between. He wished he had left his whiskey inside so he could pull Cas closer by the sweater. In the back of his mind he wondered if it was as soft as it looked.
When all of it was over, Cas showed up at Dean’s door looking exhausted. Still, he smiled at Dean and pressed a warm hand to Dean’s shoulder in greeting as he passed through the doorway.
had a lot of meanings, and Cas couldn’t believe that Dean was thinking of the same meaning that he was.  “Together in what sense of the word?” he asked.
When they parted, Cas looked overwhelmed: his blue eyes were dark, his lips were still parted, and the grip he had on Dean’s waist was tight enough to leave marks.
Sam glared at him.  “I know your shriveled little heart has never heard of puppies, Dean, so I’m going to let that one slide.”
Sam edged out past him and slunk away toward Eileen, who was sneaking pictures of Gilda and Charlie.
Dean’s ears burned in mortification.  He took Cas’s hand and held on.  “I was an asshole,” he said.  He kissed Cas’s knuckles.  “But it wasn’t your fault.  You’re the only one who keeps me in line.”
Dean couldn’t get himself to stand. He stared at the tile at the base of the toilet and breathed through the pounding in his head. His mouth was sour, his throat sore from the stomach acid.
Dean puts the bowl down.  He doesn’t break eye contact with Cas, though it’s obvious his mind is miles away.  “That’s… not good.”
“I’m sorry,” the man said, extending a polite smile at Dean. “Something caught my eye when you were looking through them.”
Cas put his thumbs to the screen. He typed out a message and contemplated it for half a minute before tapping send:
Cas had only spoken a few words to him.  He’d asked Dean to pass the relish, then after standing around awkwardly for a few moments with an uneaten hot dog in his hand, wandered back over to where Daphne was lounging on a blanket.  The blanket looked like one from Cas’s apartment, one that he occasionally draped over his bed when the weather got cold and his heat was acting up.  It made Dean a little uncomfortable to see someone else other than Cas on that blanket.
“I dunno,” Dean said, looking at the door and watching the passersby who peeked through the glass. “Maybe you wanted to talk to those women or something.”
“Also,” Dean said, as casually as he could manage, “I’m probably going to ask him to marry me within the year.”
One of the agents glared at Dean.  “Put your guns down,” he said needlessly to the rest, who had already holstered their weapons.  One of them immediately went to comfort Ernesto.
His party was tucked into a dark corner which, while he was thankful not to be in the middle of the room, did not make him feel like any less of a creep.  The semicircular booth they were squeezed into was at least cool.  Dean took the space next to Sam rather than Cas and ignored the stare that Cas sent him over the table between them.  Daphne was sitting next to him and Dean couldn’t - he just couldn’t look at them.
“What?  Fuck you, that’s none of your business.”  Dean’s face was pink again.  “You’ll find out when you get back, alright?  Jesus.  Oh, shut up, leave Mom out of this.”
a house, Cas - if you need an office space, just get a bigger apartment. You’d get your space, but without all the hassle.”
,’” Cas repeated.  His voice was shaking.  “It’s easy to walk away from someone who loved you, at least for Dean Winchester.”
Dean cleared his throat once he’d scooted in to let Aaron sit next to him.  “Charlie, this is Aaron.  Aaron, Charlie.”
The dream suddenly feels like it’s been captured in resin.  When Cas blinks, it’s slow, and when he licks his bottom lip, it’s even slower.
Ernesto was one of their custodians.  He was six months from retirement, spoke only a handful of English, and had taken in recent weeks to showing a photo of his first grandchild to anybody he came across.  He was also at this moment extremely terrified.  Cas could see his hands shaking in the air as he called out in his accent, “Yes, it’s me - Ernesto!  Please don’t shoot!”
sounded across the line, and Dean flinched. “The hell,” he said. “Celebrating the Fourth early or somethin’?”
The absurdity of that statement and the hurt in Cas’s voice spurred Dean on.  He leaned in and kissed his best friend, just once.  It was nothing more than a slight shift of lips against Cas’s, but it was more than enough to steal Dean’s breath away.  When he drew back, Cas kept his gaze trained on Dean’s, watching for a reaction.
All movement from beyond the door ceased.  He imagined Charlie freezing in the act of pouring herself a bowl of cereal or eating straight from the bag.  He waited.  No one came to the door.
With a sickening wrench of his stomach, Dean instantly understands.  He withdraws his hand from Cas’s hair, mortified and disgusted with himself.
Dean blew out a frustrated breath. “Whatever, man,” he said. He put a hand on the fireplace and glared at it. “If you’re still thinking of getting a house, this place is as good as it’ll get.”
Dean’s hand was suddenly on Cas’s face, directing his gaze back at Dean. “Never,” he said. Then he gave Cas a lopsided smile. His voice, when he continued, was thick. “But I still wanted to be better. You deserved me at my best, and this,” he looked around at Winchester Bakery’s kitchen with a sigh, “this is my best. Or as good as it’s ever going to get.”
Dean had been in the middle of getting into the car.  He stopped suddenly, though, to send a stern look at Cas.  “Seriously, Cas.  You get pneumonia again, I’m kicking your ass.”
Cas frowns a little bit, but his nostrils flare with how hard he’s breathing.  “How I got here, kissing an absolute idiot, I have no idea.”
As Cas spoke, a tremble took root in Dean’s fingers, in Dean’s bones.  He touched Cas’s face where two tears had overflowed and blessed his skin, and felt his own vision blur through moisture.
The pair mingled with the guests hand-in-hand for most of the night, only letting go to pick up Jack and swing him between them.
It succeeded in one way - Cas became a fan - and backfired in all the rest - Cas consequently became obsessed.
Dean didn’t dare meet Cas’s gaze as he climbed back under the covers. He tried to be quiet, but a small groan of relief escaped him as his spine met the mattress.
Cas suddenly shifts into motion as he stifles a yawn behind his hand and Dean releases the tension twisting his gut.
Wordlessly, Dean walked to the bed and climbed in, leaning his back against the pillow braced against the headboard and staring at the space between his knee and Cas’s.
“Fine,” Dean snapped. “But if I lose business because you broke the hearts of every teenager in town, I’m docking your pay.”
Cas was staring at him from across the kitchen with his hands crossed over his chest. “I can appreciate that you’re a busy man, Dean, but you’re not just busy - you’re avoi -”
His floor wasn’t completely empty because the FBI offices were never empty.  A few of his coworkers were working a case overnight a few desks away.  He greeted them with a wave and settled down at his computer.  The buzzing in his head lessened as he answered his emails, but his fingers still itched.
Stunned silence.  Dean stares them all down, daring any of them to say anything.  If he has to knock someone out for talking shit about Cas, he swears he’ll do it and damn the consequences.
“I think you do,” Dean said, but despite his words his voice was shaky.  A beat passed.  Dean stood up slowly, only to sit a little closer to Cas, close enough that Cas could see the nervous flush under Dean’s freckles.
But Charlie had finally lowered her fist.  She was grinning a little cheekily.  “Emma Watson is a babe, isn’t she?”
When Cas looked up again, Dean’s expression was unimpressed. “Is this just a repeat of the conversation we had two weeks ago? Because going on a date with me would be kind of counterintuitive.”
Cas is still sitting at the table where Dean left him, despite many minutes having passed.  He’s staring at the wood grain of their tiny dining table, but when he hears the padding of Dean’s feet, he looks up.  His eyes are wary but sharp.
The thought of being around Cas during Christmas season made Dean’s stomach flip. His throat was still dry. He resumed his search for a glass with newfound motivation.
The first time they go grocery-shopping during the stay-at-home order, they go together, and only because neither wanted the other one to go, but neither could no one go, and so their stubbornness resulted in this:
“I as good as told you to ditch me.  Please don’t blame yourself just because my tipsy self couldn’t keep his mouth shut.”
He watched the congratulatory messages pour in on his screen - from Sam, Eileen, Bobby, Mary, Jody, Donna, all of Dean’s good friends. Even Claire sent a heart emoji.
Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “I fucked up, alright? I did. And I’m sorry. But I didn’t keep this from you to hurt you. Dean Campbell is anonymous for a reason - so I can be Dean Winchester in peace.”
One day, Cas hoped, Dean would never have reason to doubt Cas’s devotion to him. “The only thing I’m interested in doing right now is selling donuts and beating Gabriel at Words with Friends,” Cas said.
“It’s not,” Dean says. There’s a trace of anger in his voice, but Cas knows it’s not directed toward him.
Only when Dean finished did Cas sit back. His sky-blue eyes were dark, his breathing unsteady. “When I told you to try your hand at poetry, I didn’t think - “
“You’re just one dude, Cas,” he said as they left the third house (it was a decent size but needed a fair amount of repairs). “What do you need with a whole house?”
Dean’s quiet. Cas hears him take another swig of his beer as he leans down to try to rinse out his eyes.  When he straightens, he feels Dean pushing a towel into his hand.
Dean wandered into the shopfront after a gaggle of them left. His expression was grumpy. He’d been vehemently against the concept of a hairnet, so he went around the kitchen in a baseball cap. On that day it was maroon. “You cannot go on a date with any of those kids,” he said to Claire.
was something that Cas had always dreamed of. For years now he’d wished for it: having a porch swing, a garage for his car, a backyard big enough for a dog.
But... it doesn’t have to be that way.  Dean turns over the idea in his head like he’s appraising an antique coin in his palm.  What if Dean changed it up?  What if instead of making breakfast, Dean teaches Cas how to make his pancakes?  What if instead of keeping Cas at the table, Dean reaches out and pulls him in and -
He packed an overnight bag and a few six-packs into the trunk of the Impala and began the drive, wondering if Cas would be there by the time he arrived, and what he might say to him.  It had been a little less than a week since they’d last spoken.  While it wasn’t unusual to go so long without speaking, it was unusual to go so long without speaking
Dean’s breathing was deep and controlled, his eyes still squeezed so tightly shut they were trembling.  Cas could see the amount of tension in his muscles and despite himself, imagined how it must have felt to keep from crying out when his shoulder was at the vey least dislocated.
Dean had been thinking about that too. Without the gifts, without the music, without the lights - it was just a dinner for two alone in Cas’s apartment. On top of that, Cas was wearing a new sweater, and he’d bought Dean’s favorite whiskey. There was also an apple pie baking in the oven, if Cas was to be believed. Dean looked at his whiskey. Cas had bought new glassware, too.
Cas stopped him with a hand to his shoulder. “I’m here, aren’t I?” he said. “I never left your side.”
Dream Cas, with his hip leaning against the counter and his hands clutching an empty mug, is barely awake.  Still, he’s able to mumble out, “Good morning, Dean.”  His voice is softer than usual, a little muffled, like it’s been wrapped in cotton.  “How are you feeling?”
The smile on Dean’s face turned into a wince.  “He - Mom, I brought him so I could set him up with Charlie.  I was never interested in him.”
“You wouldn’t know what to do without me,” Dean says confidently, kicking Cas’s foot underneath the table.
Cas ran a hand over his face. “I’m too drunk for this,” he said. He stretched his arms over his head in a excruciatingly slow stretch, then walked over to join Dean on the couch, oblivious to the way Dean was silently saying his first prayer to a deity in years. Cas sat down and sighed heavily when he looked at the tree. “It’s worse from over here.”
“An understatement,” Dean said, then exchanged a few bills for the two drinks the bartender slid toward them.
Dean’s eyebrows rose.  His mouth dropped open, just a little.  Then, taking her hand in his, he laughed.  He couldn’t help it.
Claire’s presence brought a previously-underrepresented demographic to the bakery: teenagers and college students. They came in droves to buy something touched by her hand, and on multiple occasions, Cas had had to pass her a note that some poor student had been too shy to give to Claire themself.
Dean leaned against the wall opposite the oven, trying to peer into it.  “Could teach you,” he said.  “Maybe for next Christmas.”  Then he laughed.  “But that lasagna does look damn good, bud, I’ll give you that.”
By the time the water has run clear, Dean’s hands have started to tremble.  What now?  Turn around?  Look Cas in the eye?  Both are impossible.
Dean looks up at him through his eyelashes with a slightly exasperated look. “Where I’m gonna live is not really the most important issue at hand right now.” His eyes dip down to Cas’s lips then back up to Cas’s eyes. It’s an invitation if Cas ever saw one.
Warmth has migrated from Dean’s coffee mug to the tips of his ears.  “Oh,” is all he can say.  His voice seems separate from his own body.
Dean’s cheeks were rosy with pleasure, even if he looked bone-tired. “Couldn’t have done it without you, Cas.” He locked eyes with Cas. “I mean that.”
Cas moved closer.  “Ah,” he said, smiling a little.  “When I say I was productive these past few weeks, I mean I neglected the novel my editor’s expecting and started on a new one.”
Dean’s fingers twitched in Cas’s hand. It was clammy and warm from the fire, but Cas held on all the same. Dean licked his lips. “Cas, you’re not serious.”
Dean’s eyes were searching. His hand had finally come to rest on Cas’s cheek, secure and warm. “Cas, you’re a goddamn angel, but you need to say what you mean because I’m a dumbass.”
Dean put his hand in Cas’s. His feelings for Cas threatened to overwhelm him, but he squeezed Cas’s hand and the feeling eased when Cas smiled. “Count me in, Cas.”
“Oh,” Aaron said.  “I thought you preferred we take your car.  We can start taking mine, if you want.  I don’t mind.”  He started humming along to the track playing through the stereo and looked out the window.
Dean hung his head. “Why do I have to be so good at cupcakes?” Sighing heavily, he started the car and pulled out into the road. He took Cas’s hand and lifted it to his mouth. He kissed Cas’s wedding band.
Cas’s eyebrows rose. “I see why you’re so well-read, then,” he said. “What kind of books do you work with?”
When they drew back, their breath came up between them as puffs of steam. Cas’s eyes were still closed. His lips shone. Dean touched the bottom one with his thumb, gratified when he felt Cas’s smile.
Dean grins suddenly and begins packing up the clippers, winding the wire around his fingers.  He won’t look at Cas.  “Not bad, eh?”
Cas found Dean in the living room, staring at the fireplace. “What do you think?” he asked, once he was standing shoulder to shoulder with Dean to examine the hearth. “Too big? Too small?”
“It was the last they had,” Cas said, lifting the lid of the box in his hands to reveal Dean’s favorite apple pie.  “I got lucky.”
At the end of day 3, Cas found Dean lounging on the rug in front of the fireplace, leaning back against the couch with his legs extended in front of him. The fireplace was roaring; it was actually far too warm for Cas’s liking, but Dean was enjoying himself and Cas hated to interrupt. He joined Dean on the rug and passed Dean a beer from the kitchen, where his newly-installed fridge had just come to temperature.
It had been a spur-of-the-moment decision after a slow morning at the bakery. They’d been staring at each other from across the kitchen, both half-lidded, both half-dozing, Cas at his table, Dean leaning against the fridge, when Dean had said, “Yknow, I dreamed of marryin’ you last night.”
Cas looked stunned at Dean’s reaction.  He swallowed hard, but his next words were more confident, buoyed by Dean’s touch.  “Dean, I know - I
Cas sighed again, another sigh that seemed to emerge from the deepest part of his soul.  Tiredly, he said, “For the last time, Dean Winchester, you did not get them together.  Tripping Sam
“Yeah, I guess,” Aaron finally said.  “I’ll have whatever he’s having,” he then said to the bartender.  “Dean, you want another one?”
Helpless, absolutely wrecked, Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Sammy had just gotten married to the best woman on Earth a few hours prior. A few yards away, the people Dean loved were dancing to “The Cha-Cha Slide.” And now Cas was asking Dean to take on the biggest honor of his life in the same sentence that Cas was talking about his inevitable death. Dean’s eyes welled up.
“That’s not what I mean, man. I mean like - you want a family, right? Someone to grow old with and a kid and a dog and all that?” Dean took a deep breath and smiled; it was wide but didn’t meet his eyes. “I’ll be right there with you, I promise, but if you’re gonna kick me out of that room in a few years I’d rather just crash on the couch.”
Cas rolled his eyes but took a bite too.  The pie was good.  It wasn’t amazing, but Dean was closing his eyes in appreciation, and the two hours standing outside of the bakery were suddenly more than worth it.
It was 45 minutes later, debating whether or not he could stomach the fallout if he returned to Cas still in his apartment, that he realized the only real penance would be to return and face the consequences regardless.
Then he turned to Dean.  Dean was so grateful for Cas’s friendship he could feel it choking him.  Cas squeezed his shoulder.  “Take care, Dean,” he said, so low Dean could feel it in his bones.  How had Dean never noticed how blue Cas’s eyes actually were?
“Just-  just put it away, dude,” Dean mumbles.  He’s embarrassed.  Usually his dreams don’t talk back.
The yard was clean and well-kept, separated from the neighbors’ yards by a tall wooden fence. Along the fence various herbs had been planted, and Cas could smell rosemary amidst the smell of smoke from the grill.
“Fantastic,” Sam said - something he only ever said to clients, which made Cas feel like some sort of transaction was taking place. Sam was pulling his phone out of his pocket before he even finished turning away, and Cas just
Dean looked at Cas over Eileen’s head.  She couldn’t hear him, but what he said next was for Cas anyway: “I did, didn’t I?”
Cas didn’t think.  He met Dean’s lips with his own.  Dean’s soft answering groan was raw, the sound of a man whose hurts were met with life-saving saltwater.  They kissed for a long time, their hands still linked between them.
Dean hadn’t asked on the phone with Cas; he’d been too eager to disconnect the call and lay in bed and
Cas didn’t reply to Dean’s comment.  He had begun wiping down his kitchen counters, transferring dirty glasses into the sink and clearing what looked to be twelve days’ worth of notes from a stack near the fridge.  His brows were furrowed, and the long lines of muscle under his tee contracted with every pass of the rag against the tile.
“I’m investing in my future,” Cas eventually said diplomatically, ignoring Dean’s intense gaze. He turned to Sam. “Will you please pass me the broccoli, Sam?”
Dream Cas is beautiful.  His eyes, curious, blink at Dean’s silence, and his lips - always pale - part as if to say something else.  Dean shakes himself out of his reverie.  “Never mind,” he says, voice so tired he barely recognizes it.  There’s no point talking to his own subconscious, so he offers it breakfast instead.  “How’s eggs sound?”
“Dean and I are together,” Cas said, smiling cheekily at Dean.  His expression turned startled when he heard the clatter of the dog food container on the floor.
He hadn’t bothered greeting anybody.  His first words were to a passing bartender.  Sam was staring at his profile.
“I get it, boy,” Bobby said.  “Still doesn’t mean he wasn’t your best friend.  Those feelings won’t go away no matter how you try.”
Dean put his hand over the one on his face. He had to swallow his emotion a few times before managing to ask, “Does that mean I’m forgiven?”
He had nothing yet to fill the house with - not even a car - but owning a house would at least get him a little closer to a dream that seemed so out of reach.
Cas closed his own eyes and decided.  Sam could never be a security threat.  Years earlier, he might have been, when it had only been he and Dean, but now Sam had a family, and his priority was no longer Dean.  Cas walked out of the kitchen.  In his bedroom, he gathered his things for a shower.  When he passed the kitchen, Dean’s eyes followed him through the doorway, framed by furrowed brows and lips parted in surprise.
“Since you met me,” Dean says, grinning in the way he knows irritates Cas to no end.  “Melted that cold heart of yours.”
For now, Dean watches.  He watches because it’s easy and there’s no consequence.  Dream time won’t catch up with him.  Maybe he could pass forever away staring at Cas’s profile, the shadow of his lashes against his cheek, the stubble darkening his chin.  He could never try this in the real world, not when Cas might actually catch him at it.
It took Cas only a split second to wake up and register what was happening. He was out of bed in the next second, circling to Dean’s side to take him by the arm.
Cas is back to eating now, casual as you please.  “To this day,” he continues, “You’ve never asked for anything I was not ready for.  You’re okay with ‘just’ me.”
Cas’s eyes were shifting between Dean’s, trying to find something that Dean wasn’t quite sure existed.
Dean stared at the point of contact between their knees.  Cas saw his throat bob, then he saw Dean’s hand move ever so slowly to rest, palm up, on Cas’s knee.  It was an invitation if Cas ever saw it.  It was Dean being brave.  He put his hand in Dean’s.
They hoisted it up in the corner of their living room with only a little trouble (the trouble being on Dean’s part, because Cas had pulled up the sleeves of his sweater and Dean had wanted to
Cas sighed one last time before getting up to watch Dean’s progress. “Smells nice,” he praised, peeking over Dean’s shoulder, making Dean shiver. Cas’s hand landed on Dean’s back. It skated down for a brief moment, just lightly, just enough to make Dean’s nerves sing, then it was gone. Cas walked away into the bathroom for a shower and Dean walked away from the stove to splash cold water on his face.
They sat down together. Dean’s knee knocked against Cas’s. They stared at the manuscript in front of them. Cas flipped a page, then another, taking a few seconds on each. Dean saw the words he’d written and had to close his eyes to keep himself from begging Cas to stop.
Cas was still displeased, though he still hadn’t moved from his nest.  “Why the fuck is he calling at 1am, Dean?  Creep.”
Cas chuckled.  “That’s a tempting image,” he murmured.  But he didn’t expand.  He cleared his throat.  “Anyway, how is Charlie?”
Cas had tried not to see the past few minutes through a romantic lens, but regardless, the shut doorway felt like a rejection. His heart ached, and the boulder in his stomach sank a few inches lower.
“Hey,” Cas said too.  He was so close to Dean that if he tilted his head up just a little, and Dean leaned in just a little in turn…
“You keep complaining about it but never actually doing anything about it,” Cas had said sullenly, when Dean had demanded
This was definitely not how Dean’s usual conversations at a bar went.  Compliments usually centered around his hair or his smile or his muscles, not his kindness.  His mom, Dean suddenly thought, would love Gilda.  He scratched the back of his neck.  “Not back then I wasn’t.  Angry at the world, stubborn, had a problem with authority.  Almost got kicked out about half a dozen times.  Cas didn’t care, though.  Helped me study, didn’t leave when I lost my temper.”
“I’m not surprised,” Cas said gently, regretting his lack of patience and stomach space. “You were up past midnight last night.”
When he looked up, Cas was still smiling at him. Even in the darkness, his eyes were affectionate. “It’s not your apartment that makes me feel better, Dean.”
They arrived at Dean’s apartment building, and Cas yawned into a hand when he closed his door. “You can head up without me,” he said to Dean over the roof of the car. He dug his car keys out of his pocket and gestured to his car, a block away. “I think I’ll head home.”
Afterward, they ate lunch, feet tangled together under their dining table. Cas smiled as he ate, alternating between smug - “I should have invited you for a nap sooner” - and affectionate - “I’d like to spend the day together tomorrow, if you’re up for it.”
Cas was a rumpled and tired mess in the passenger seat. “Why would you lie about that in the first place?” he asked, stifling a yawn.
“He probably does know,” Sam said reasonably.  “But he’s also trusted you for ten years with this big piece of him, and then you treat it like it’s no big deal.”
Dean lifted his head; his eyes were shining with emotion. “Thank you,” he said, nudging his nose against Cas’s.
He picked up the phone and dialed Sam.  Just to see how he was doing, of course.  Not also to see what was keeping Dean from him.
He was turning away when Dean suddenly reached out and grabbed his wrist. Cas looked back, surprised. Dean had one bleary eye open. “The hell you going?” he mumbled.
He took Dean’s mug along with his own - though they were both nearly full - and Dean watched helplessly as Cas carried them to the carafe.  Cas’s mouth was set as he refilled his mug, then Dean’s, but then Dean saw his best friend’s throat bob dangerously, and he knew he couldn’t take it.  He’d hurt Cas once, then once again, so much so that Cas had
When Cas came back to Dean’s bedroom, he was sans coat and holding a glass of water and a plate of toast. Dean had hauled himself up into a sitting position, his covers pulled across his lap and over his shoulders.
Dean dropped his keys.  “Uh, yeah,” he said, as he scooped them up from the floor.  It was barely 8, but
“Never letting you go,” Dean said, when Cas got to the point where all he could do was grip Dean’s shoulders and shake and cry out with every pass of Dean’s hand.  “Never.”
Cas gets under the covers and leans over Dean, smelling like shampoo and toothpaste.  “Good night,” he says cheerfully.
Cas heard Dean step a little closer.  He was by Cas’s feet now.  When Cas removed the hand from his eyes, he saw Dean looking at the table in the corner of the room.  On top of it was Cas’s bloody shirt in an evidence bag.  His face was pale.  “It’s a long story, Cas.”
“Don’t be sorry,” Cas said softly. “I’m glad you’re feeling better.” He rubbed Dean’s back once more before standing up. His knees clicked; Dean remembered with an ache that they were both on the wrong side of 30.
Cas hated it.  Cas hated every minute of it.  He’d spent the two years prior to Dean’s return furiously seeking him out, dedicating every spare minute he had to bringing Dean to justice - and now here Dean was, no more than two dozen feet in any direction for 40 hours a week… as if he’d never turned turncoat against the FBI.
Cas could feel Dean’s gaze on his profile, but he fixed his eyes in front of him, where a fire might burn in just a few short weeks if everything went according to plan. “I will always value your opinion, no matter how wrong it might be.”
“I take it you didn’t mean it?” It wasn’t quite disappointment that Cas was feeling, but it was a little pinch of hurt right under his ribcage.
Dean was fiddling with a corkscrew at the nearest countertop. He had flour across the front of his grey T-shirt and a hand towel hanging from the back pocket of his jeans. His apron and hat were hung up by the back door, and his hair looked mussed, like he’d run a hand through it after he’d hung up his hat.
Dean swallowed down his terror. He walked to the door, hands shaking. “If you’re not here when I get back... I get it,” he said.
“No evacuation orders up here. It’s not as bad as farther down south.” Cas’s voice was soothing, but Dean could hear the wind rattling Cas’s window.
They lapse into silence.  Cas finishes his eggs and mops up the ketchup with his last bite of toast.  He doesn’t take out his phone, and Dean’s more than willing to sit there and watch.
The kitchen was an actual room in the house, not just an extension of the living room, and Cas could already imagine in perfect, painful clarity the way Dean would move around the room as he prepared burger patties or whipped up some chicken noodle soup or baked an apple pie.
Terrified, Dean cast about for another reason.  “I mean,” he said quickly, “you said he’s been visiting Daphne, right?  They could be… giving it another shot?”  Even saying it was painful.
Cas put his hand over Dean’s. It took him a few seconds to find the right words past his indignation on Dean’s own behalf. When he did, his voice shook: “Dean, you deserve love even at your worst. Even if this
“I still don’t think it’s safe,” Cas ventures, a little hesitant because Dean’s staring out the window again at the empty streets.
“I didn’t realize,” Dean whispered, daring to lean in again, loving the way he could feel the rise of Cas’s chest against his own.  “But I hated seeing you with Daphne, and I couldn’t figure out why.”
When Cas came, it was with a long groan that he tried to muffle in Dean’s neck.  Dean let him control the pace as he rode through orgasm, enjoying the way Cas’s hand clenched around his, how Cas demanded his pleasure and trusted Dean to give it.
At that, there was such a long pause that Dean almost thought Cas left the room, but when Dean finally lifted his head from the couch arm to see what happened, he saw Cas, sitting on a kitchen stool, staring at the floor with red cheeks and a furrowed brow.  “I think it’s time you left, Dean.”
The walls in the apartment aren’t particularly thin, but still, last night Cas knocked loudly on Dean’s door and banged it open without even waiting for a response.
“Too many people pay attention to you, Dean,” Cas said, closing his laptop.  “That’s how you became an arrogant asshole who thinks he can improve other people’s lives when they don’t need it.”
“I wasn’t curious,” Cas said, though he had turned his attention back to Dean.  “But since you’re in such a sharing mood, I’ll indulge you.  Why is your life so great, Dean?”
An awkward silence fell. Cas put his hand on the door handle and opened his mouth to say thanks, but Dean put a hand on his arm to stop him.
, it read.  It was silly to get emotional over a welcome mat, especially one that they had probably purchased at the local Home Depot for ten bucks, but at that moment, Dean couldn’t help feeling overwhelmingly proud of his little brother.  They had come a long way since living with their dad.
Dean is suddenly aware of the shallowness of his breath.  He closes his eyes and tries to get it under control before the dream slips away.  When he feels calmer, when Cas’s skin beneath his palm is hot to the touch, he opens his eyes.
As he does, the memory of Cas’s gaze saturates his thoughts, and he dreams, but he dreams the kind of dreams he has when he’s awake:
“You too, Dean,” Aaron said, smiling wide.  He’d tamed the beard, too, which was a nice surprise.  “I’m really glad you contacted me.”
Cas thought about it for what was probably the 70th time in two days.  He knew Mary wouldn’t mind; on the contrary, she’d probably be doubly happy to see all three of “her boys” in her home.  But Cas couldn’t do it.  He couldn’t sit next to Dean at Christmas dinner and drink eggnog with Dean and exchange presents with Dean in Dean’s family home.  He couldn’t do all that and come away unscathed.  Lately even just
Dean stared at her.  Finally, he nodded.  He sat back down, and those remaining descended into an uncomfortable silence.
Dean couldn’t stop grinning, amazed at this creature who knew him better than he did himself at the moment.  “You’re something else,” he replied.
Defeated, Dean turns around, but he can’t find it in him to look at Cas.  He grips the edge of the counter behind him to steady himself and stares at the sight of his toes against the white tile of their apartment.  “Just forget it,” he says again.  “It didn’t happen.”  He’s desperate to abandon this morning as the nightmare it was.
Cas was still frustrated, still angry, still hurting - but none of that was because of Dean any longer.  “Hurry up,” he said softly.
In the end the ref has to separate them; no cards are shown, but neither of them talks to the other for two weeks.
“Cas!” Sam sounded happy.  “Dude, I haven’t heard from you in ages!  Dean’s been keeping you from me, huh?”
“Clear enough?” Dean asks softly, staring at his socks again.  He’s dropped his hands and linked them together in front of him. He’s still leaning against the counter. Cas would be angry with him for looking so goddamn cool but he’s too busy trying to process the fact that Dean has just kissed him.
Cas had just admitted to his feelings so easily, so casually. Dean had imagined Cas dodging the question, some nervous hedging - not this, not standing there holding Dean’s favorite whiskey and looking like a goddamn movie star with his blue eyes and scruff.
Dean was leaning on the door frame. He was the only one in the whole office dressed casually - flannel and jeans - but he looked comfortable. Cas was filled with warmth just looking at him.
It took Dean’s brain a second to catch up with what the man had said, distracted as he was by the man’s eyes. They were spring-clear blue and would have needed at least a paragraph to properly capture them. “Yeah,” Dean said eventually, still reeling. “No problem.”
Dean took hold of Cas’s elbows too, a reassurance that Cas was still there in front of him, still alive, still breathing. “Cas, you’re going to be kicking for a long time. Jack will have grandbabies before you check out.”
Charlie had been quiet, but she was suddenly animated once more.  “If all of us are going, I’m definitely in too.”
Dean settled at the counter, leaning against it as they stared each other down. It was obvious Cas was waiting for his judgment, but Dean had no idea why. “I’m not gonna disagree with you, Cas. You weren’t happy there. You sure you’re gonna be okay cash-wise, though?”
The response takes so long Cas thinks Dean must have forgotten about the party altogether.  “I like the sound of that, too,” Dean eventually says.  His hands are making their way under Cas’s sweater.
A silence stretched on.  Then Bobby asked what Cas could tell he’d been dying to ask since sitting down: “How is he?”
Twenty minutes later, Dean’s phone rang.  He answered it quickly, relieved; both Aaron and Charlie seemed to be intent on asking him questions rather than getting to know each other, and the sooner he was out of there the better.
“It hasn’t,” Dean said, looking up at Cas through his eyelashes as he placed some toast down. “This is for you.”
Later, after clearing Dean’s plate and loading the dishwasher, Cas gave into Dean’s groggy insistence to join him on the couch and to “bring the grape juice.”
“It’s harmless,” Dean replied, waving away Cas’s curious stare. “It’s good for ‘em. Teaches ‘em to question things, question motives. Gets ‘em ready for the adult world of backstabbing and lies.”
But such was his life, and it didn’t mean that the conclusions Dean was drawing were untrue. “I don’t get out very often,” Cas said diplomatically. “I’ve heard good things about it, though. I don’t mind trying new things.” If he said it a little defensively, Dean didn’t react.
He gets up and turns away instead.  “Omelette okay with you?  Mushrooms, some green onions?”  He waits for an answer even though he knows what it’s going to be.
“The guy who wouldn’t stop calling you for months?” Cas had asked incredulously, ignoring Willow, who’d been chewing on his shoelaces.  “Him?  He’s your great plan?”
It took Cas a few seconds to comprehend those five words through the initial shock, then another few to come up with an answer that felt right.
“She’s a good enough lady,” Mary said evenly, “But if she hurts that boy of mine again, I’ll chase her off with a shotgun myself.”
V. 	“You were ready to shoot me,” Dean accused, an hour later.  He was angry.  He had just come from the director’s office where he had (supposedly) been firmly reprimanded by the director for putting Ernesto in danger, and somehow the first thing on his to-do list afterward was to make a beeline for Cas and accuse Cas of actually doing his job.  It occurred to Cas that maybe he wasn’t the only one whose worst expectations had been realized.
“I’ll be there,” he said, because what else could he say when Sam was grinning at him like that? At the very least Cas could go to the barbeque and show Dean exactly the kind of boring life he led, and Dean would lose interest and Cas wouldn’t have to worry about his own feelings because he knew they wouldn’t be returned anyhow. “Do you want me to bring anything?”
“Why would I?” Cas asked. It was close enough to the truth, and the more people who believed Dean to be unavailable, the better it was for Cas. It was selfish, but Cas couldn’t bring himself to feel bad about it.
Cas looked down at him.  He’d seen Dean be thrown onto his back onto the stairs but Cas fought past the concern.  He didn’t offer a hand.  He didn’t offer gratitude.  He offered the truth instead, and maybe Dean would understand Cas’s cruelty despite Dean’s supposed efforts at redemption.   Cas said, “I loved you.”
“Charlie adores you,”  Cas said calmly, “despite my best efforts to warn her away from your idiocy.  It would take a lot to get her to hate you.”
Cas let his words sink in for a few moments, but he kept speaking when Dean didn’t begin, his eyes dancing between Dean’s, dislodging another tear.  “I don’t have the words, Dean.  It’s - it’s my
Dean had given Cas the manuscript in the hopes that it would be explanation enough. He never intended to admit to anything out loud. “I mean, it’s pretty obvious, isn’t it?”
“You’ll be spending much more time in my house than she will,” Cas said, “So her opinion doesn’t count. Also, be careful or I might mistake that tone for jealousy.”
Mary’s house had three bedrooms - two of them now long empty.  It was partly because her house was so empty that she insisted on a family dinner once every month.  Dean and Sam and Eileen and Cas and Bobby were usually the only ones to come by.  This month, however, there were four extra guests, because not only had Cas invited Daphne and her friend, Dean had also decided that Charlie and Aaron should be welcomed as well.  He told himself it was not out of spite, but he knew that just because he said so didn’t make it true.  At any rate, he reasoned, it was probably better for everyone if he had something to distract him from Daphne and Cas.
It occurred to Dean Winchester, as he watched his brother and new sister-in-law sway awkwardly on the dance floor of their wedding reception, that at that moment, he had everything he wanted.  Sure, he wasn’t wealthy or famous, but Dean Winchester didn’t need money or fame to be content.  No, all he needed was what he already had: a good job, his own place, a badass car, a wonderful mother, a loyal best friend, the biggest dork of a brother he could ask for, and now (finally) - a gorgeous, too-good-for-his-brother sister-in-law.
Dean stares at his husband, marveling at the audacity.  Finally, he says, “You’re such a jackass,” but diminishes the effect by pulling Cas in roughly by the front of the shirt and kissing him, much to Cas’s delight.
An awkward silence descended.  Charlie’s eyes slid to Dean as if expecting him to lead the conversation.  Geez.  Was 11am too early for a drink?
Claire smirked at Cas, who was failing to hide his flustered expression. “So you’re telling me you two
They kissed languidly in the kitchen for a few minutes before Dean had to beg for a reprieve. “My head’s killing me,” he said, resting his forehead on Cas’s shoulder. “I swear to god I’m never drinking again.”
The parking lot was close to empty.  He tried to call out, but whether or not he succeeded he had no idea because she wasn’t turning around.  If anything she was walking faster.  He sped up.  Stumbled.  Saw that she was reaching into her purse for her keys.  He walked faster.  He was within touching distance when the redhead suddenly whirled around and showed him the keys between her knuckles.
Cas’s cheeks were pink.  He looked down at his shoes.  “Oh,” he said, and somehow in that one syllable he carried a dozen different meanings.
Dean’s gut turned sour again, and he knew himself better than to blame it on the burger. “So you are thinkin’ about kids.”
He looked at Dean’s face just in time to see quiet awe bloom on Dean’s face, almost in stages: the intake of breath, the bob of his throat, the furrow of his brow, the rising pink in his cheeks, and the slight, astonished widening of his eyes.
Sam straightened.  His nose was red, but his eyes were dry.  His cuffs, however, were suspiciously damp, and none of the spilled dog food seemed to have moved.  He cleared his throat.  “I guess congratulations are in order, then,” he said.  His smile was wobbly.  He moved toward Cas first and engulfed him in a huge embrace.  “I had almost lost hope for you two,” he said, and by the time he turned to Dean, he was openly weeping.
Cas looked him oddly, but he said nothing. He led Dean away from the reception tent (where Gabriel and Garth were taking turns to dance with Jack in their arms) and stopped when they were far enough away to hear each other without yelling.
Dean had his palms pressed into his eyes. “Cas, I barely remember getting to the bar, much less a drinking game. Did Sammy even make it home? Jesus, I should call him.”
Cas shook his head, picked up his pen, and opened a folder.  “I know.  Why do you think I was avoiding you?”
Dean really didn’t want to be having this conversation, though he wasn’t quite sure why.  He could help Cas.  He could see Cas through this.  Cas could be happy if Dean helped him.  But if Cas being happy meant being with Daphne?  That was something entirely different.
Cas remained seated at Dean’s dining table. Dean walked away, toward his bedroom, his hand white-knuckled on the doorknob. Then he pulled the door shut, stopping just short of closing it completely. A sliver of light crept through the gap.
“I hope so,” Dean said. He caught Cas’s eye then looked away, caught in the act. He swallowed. “Listen, Cas, we gotta talk.”
“Trust me, Cas,” he said, knocking his beer bottle against Cas’s as they sat on Cas’s couch, “Home ownership? Big bag of dicks. You’d have to take care of a yard and clean gutters and do all the repairs yourself - and your neighbors might turn out to be assholes, but you wouldn’t be able to do anything about it because you sank your life savings into the house.”
That made Dean laugh.  He kissed his mom on the temple, more to keep himself from looking at Cas’s hand, hovering ever so lightly on Daphne’s back.  “I’ll join you.”
dream - and Cas in his dreams is always a little less stiff, a little more affectionate, a little more open.  “How would you put it then?” he asks, curious despite knowing that it’s just his subconscious supplying the conversation.
“You gotta make it worth it,” which was possibly even worse. As soon as it was out of his mouth, Cas wanted to sink into the earth, not least because of the slow, contemplative way Dean looked at him.
“Listen, Cas,” Dean said, clearing his throat, “now that we know Jack’s gonna be sticking around, you should know something.”
But Cas had stopped touching, so Dean pulled his fingers back into his palms and put them back onto his lap, trying to ignore the one part of him that was aching for more.  Cas’s eyes were wild and dark, but he moved slowly, carefully.  He leaned forward and let his forehead fall onto Dean’s shoulder again.  One arm came up over Dean’s other shoulder to pull Dean even closer by the hair.  It hurt a little, but Dean felt Cas’s breath on his neck again, unsteady, and the pain paled in comparison to the knowledge that Cas was his,
“You didn’t call my phone?”  He handled the pie carefully and set it on a trivet on Cas’s countertop.
Dean patted Cas on the cheek once, just once before pulling away, and was rewarded with a surprised grin.  Then Cas was doing the same to Dean, except it was less of a pat and more of a slap, and Dean was yelping in pain.
It was a little more than half an hour when Dean exited the bathroom, looking a little less green and dressed in fresh clothes and a robe. He saw Cas on the armchair and said, “Toast was just as good coming back up as it was going down.”
“Dinner,” Cas says, his vocabulary greatly reduced. He wants to wrap himself up in Dean but knows there has to be a long talk beforehand, and they can’t do that when Dean’s hands are trying to inch down Cas’s waistband.
Dean finally turned to Cas, but only to give him a skeptical look. “Cas, it’s not a vacation if you’re working somewhere else.”
Cas laughed.  The wine was making him feel light, and the sight of Dean happy and healthy in his home was making him feel even lighter.  “Thank you for coming, Dean,” he said, after the song ended and Dean’s head had lolled back onto the back of the couch.
“I know you’re naturally a friendly guy, so maybe what you and Gilda were doing was completely innocent.  But uh - I think you should know that it was a little upsetting to see you and her talking like that.  I know we haven’t established - “
Cas looked up to stare incredulously at Dean’s profile. “Not to say that I wish you were ill more often, but allow me to repeat: I like taking care of you.”
Dean caught Cas’s expression and paused, licking his lips. He cleared his throat and put the bottle down. “So, uh—things have been pretty good over here,” he said, business-like. “Claire’s been stepping up. Was thinking of taking Kaia on part-time, so long as they keep their hands to themselves on company time.”
Dean smiles to himself.  For a while, he watches Cas eat.  Then he asks, “Isn’t this much better than being on your phone?”
Dean ran a hand over his face, unsure about what to do about this new complication. Then he remembered the beer that he’d bought for movie night and proceeded to the fridge, intending to get well and truly drunk.
to have words, but I don’t have them this time, not to tell you how much I love you.”  He paused.  Licked his lips where the tear had touched the seam.  “Because I do.  I love you.  I love you more than I love anything else, Dean.  I would give up everything for you.  Everything - heaven, earth, everything in between.”
best friend, considering all the shit I’ve pulled, but I know enough about friendship to know that I should have your back.”  He tried to smile, took a breath, then powered through: “Whatever you wanna tell me, I’m all ears.”
Claire’s eye roll was one for the history books. “Dean, you know they think you and Cas are together, right?”
A pause.  “Are you calling me a blanket hog?” Dean asked incredulously, drawing back to look at Cas’s face.  “I’m not.”
Dean’s lips quirked upward in a show of amusement, but Cas sensed the doubt behind it. He sighed but could find no words to convince Dean.
The typing stopped for a moment, just long enough for Cas to say, “You and I always seem to have different opinions about what constitutes ‘good news.’”
Cas couldn’t keep from smiling either.  “Your apple pie smells wonderful, by the way,” he said softly.
The walk to the area they’d agreed to meet was barely a walk - within five minutes, dragging the cooler behind him, he spotted Sam with Willow on a leash.  Mary and Bobby were in chairs in the shade, and Cas was manning the grill, though it seemed he was having trouble starting it up.  Charlie had made her own way there and was, to Dean’s slight sense of betrayal, laughing at a joke that Daphne made.  Gilda was sitting on a tree root in a flowy sundress that showed off her tan shoulders.
Cas sighed.  He could still feel the burn of the whiskey in his throat.  “It doesn’t matter.  Have fun.  Say hello to everyone for me.”
Dean plucked another ornament from the box. He hung it up. Then he hung up another. And another. Cas did the same on the other side of the tree. In a lot of ways, the way they kept hanging ornaments was worse than the moments immediately following Dean’s unfortunate comment, because at least when they were staring in horrified silence at each other they were in some way acknowledging Dean’s words. This busy silence was different; it was, to Dean, an indication that they’d bury the moment in the back garden and never speak of it again, though the horrifying truth would always be in the back of their minds.
“Anyway, tell me more about this friend of yours,” Charlie said.  She’d already ordered a drink and was sipping on it like it was a milkshake, both of her fists pushed up to her face, making her look like a goldfish.
They stopped at a park on the way back to Dean’s apartment. Baby’s trunk was full of gifts, evidence of a successful Christmas shopping trip, and so it was with satisfaction that Dean leaned against the hood of the car and pulled out his burger from the takeout bag.
Which is how Dean acquired the little sister he never knew he wanted.  Charlie was Eileen’s old high school classmate.  The women had never been close, but when they had run into each other at a mall a few weeks back, Eileen had been so touched by Charlie’s heartfelt congratulations that she’d extended an invitation to the wedding.
“Don’t worry about it, dude,” Sam said easily.  Somewhere in the background, people cheered.  Sam’s voice was laced with a grin.  “Happy New Year, by the way.”
“That’s the thing, Cas,” Dean said, scratching the back of his neck. “I don’t got an explanation. I’ve been a dick to you for months and I always feel bad about it when I get home, but then I start up all over again the next time you bring up the whole house thing.”
Cas watches as Dean drags a box from underneath the coffee table and opens it.  The sound of the cardboard is comforting in the silence.
ness of the answer - that lifts the weight off Dean’s chest.  Now it’s just Cas’s hand on his chest, and it’s touching him, and it’s grounding him, and even in his wildest dreams Dean never thought he’d feel Cas’s hands on him quite like this.  He lifts his own hand and curves it around Cas’s jaw.  He can feel Cas’s smile underneath his palm.  To see it this up close is a privilege.
“Dean,” Daphne said, with so much emotion Dean was afraid she might dislocate something.  She reached across the circle to take one of his hands between both of her own.  “It’s so nice to see you.”
When he turns around to slide the plate in front of Cas, he almost loses balance.  He grips the table, feels the reassuring woodgrain under his fingers, and takes a seat across from Cas.  “Eat up,” he says.
Dean was chopping onions for chili. “You’ll feel better once you stop fighting it,” he said, blinking rapidly through the stinging of his eyes.
Dean stared for so long that Cas thought he might never find out the rest of what happened.  Finally, though, Dean moved a little closer on the bed and began again, speaking a little more quietly.  “I had to sell it hard for two years.  Bobby wanted me to stick with it longer, really build my rep as a guy willing to do anything for the right price, but two years away from my life, pretending to be a traitor, knowing you and Sammy hated me… I couldn’t do it any longer than that.  I convinced him to move forward with the plan.
but when,” Cas pointed out. “And you might as well buy your own house with all the eggs you’d be buying.”
Cas and the other agents ducked behind cars and approached Dean and his companion silently.   The pair was bent over the open hood of a car, murmuring to each other.  Within the next few seconds, they were surrounded by a small troop of armed agents.
“I want to be your friend.”  Even to his drunk ears, the proclamation made him cringe.  “I mean.  I - I like Hermione too.  Emma Watson.  Sexy.”
The house the realtor showed them was perfect; even Dean could find nothing to say. He just wandered around looking at the walls with a disconsolate air about him, his hands buried deep in his coat pockets.
being Dean’s supervisor.  She knew of their history, she knew it would be difficult despite Cas’s training - so
“Parking garage,” he replied numbly to one of the inquiring agents.  “I think he’s trying to get away.”
His eyes moved toward the closed bedroom door just a few feet past the bathroom. He threw Dean’s coat and scarf on the arm of the couch, then, after setting the boots next to Dean’s bedroom door, he delivered a few careful knocks.
They stare at each other while the broadcast continues from the TV behind Cas.  He can see the light shifting on Dean’s throat when he swallows.
This, at least Dean could answer, though heat climbed up his jaw in mortification: “You’re my best friend, Cas, but I - neither of us knew it’d be like this when we met. By the time I trusted you, we’d been friends for months and there was never a good time to…”
Dean didn’t bother asking who “we” was.  He didn’t answer her.  He walked into the living room and found Cas and Mary sitting on the couch facing each other.  Cas’s mouth was set in a firm line, but he met Dean’s eyes at least.  Dean was the first to look away.
On Saturday night, with Mary Ellen asleep in the guest room, Dean kissed Cas’s neck under their covers.  “You know,” he said conversationally, “There were times when I was gone that I really thought I would go insane.”
All three of the men at the table swung their gazes on her. “Wedding?” they all asked in varying degrees of confusion.
Cas didn’t respond to that, though he knew the red high on his cheeks was giving him away.  “It’s a conflict of interest,” he said as he opened a random folder and grabbed a highlighter from his desk drawer.  It was out of ink; he tossed it in the trash and grabbed for another one.  “And definitely highly illegal.”
When Cas kissed him back, Dean understood Cas’s tears because he was crying too. They kissed and kissed until their kisses no longer tasted like tears.
“Thanks, dude,” he murmurs, almost overwhelmed with affection when Cas starts eating again like he hasn’t just killed Dean’s remaining brain cells.
Eventually the check arrived, and Dean quashed the bead of disappointment that took up residence in his chest. Upon exiting the restaurant, however, Dean’s disappointment turned to surprise when Cas turned to him and said, “I’m usually free for lunch if you’d like to meet up again.”
“Uh, yeah,” Dean agreed.  “About that.”  He took his time joining her on the couch, mostly to gather his thoughts and to send a wish up into the universe that Charlie would forgive him after what he had to say.  “Cas - uh, well, he told me what he suspected.  And I just wanted to say I’m sorry - I’m sorry for flirting with Gilda… but also, I’m sorry because I… I’m not interested in you.”
“You’re welcome,” Cas says.  In the place of his earlier grin is something softer, the kind of smile Dean wants to wake up to.
Amara swung her gun to face Cas.  “Castiel,” she purred.  “I was hoping I might use you as blackmail material if Dean proved to be uncooperative in my future plans.  But now you know too much.”
Cas’s scowl vanished, replaced very quickly by a wide-eyed look.  The flush returned, but now it spread down to his chest.  “I’d - I’d say no.”
Dean craned his head to say smugly into the phone’s receiver, “Yeah, you hear that, Sammy? You’re causing me stress.”
And judging by Dean’s behavior over the last few weeks, he wasn’t going to go away either - not unless Cas asked him to.
Cas smiled and raised a hand in farewell before starting on his way back to his workplace. Dean bit down on a grin and dug his keys out of his pocket.
Cas hadn’t been lying when he said he liked taking care of Dean - it was always a privilege when Dean allowed himself to receive rather than give, and though the circumstances were unfortunate, Cas was enjoying being Dean’s caretaker -
Dean didn’t move from his step on the backstep of the house, not because he didn’t want to greet Cas, but because he was scared his knees might buckle if he tried.  He watched Cas approach instead, knowing his cheeks were heating at the way Cas’s mouth twitched downward when he looked at Dean.
In this moment it’s almost as if Dean is thinking the same thing about Cas. His eyes dance between Cas’s. His throat bobs. Cas is about to ask what’s wrong, but the words die on his tongue when Dean suddenly puts his bottle down and then lifts a hand to fit around Cas’s jaw. His hand is cold and slightly wet from the condensation. A shaky thumb grazes Cas’s mouth.
Cas wanted so badly to see Dean.  It had been barely four days, but already Cas was suffering withdrawals.  “That’s a nice thought.  Maybe next year.”  He sighed.  “Take care, Dean.  Call me if you need me.  Merry Christmas.”
It was a few minutes later - Cas was dozing, but Dean’s brain had latched onto an idea and wouldn’t let go - that Dean extricated himself from Cas’s hold and looked at him from an arm’s length away.
It’s been coming for years, but when Cas pulls Dean in for a kiss on Christmas, it’s still a surprise.  Dean takes a few moments to fully register what’s happening, that Cas is really
Dean imagined Daphne and Cas standing together in the cool air of Mary Winchester’s cheery backyard.  It wasn’t hard to do because it had been a common enough sight a few years ago.  Still, Dean wasn’t comfortable knowing that the woman who had caused his best friend the biggest heartbreak of his life would be coming to Dean’s mom’s house like she was a
Dean let out the sigh he’d been holding only when Aaron traipsed off to hand Charlie a beer.  Then Mary’s back door opened and Dean had to clench his fist to keep from scowling at the sight of Daphne in her usual sensible shoes stepping softly into the backyard.  An unfamiliar woman followed her, looking about the backyard with a soft, pleasant smile on her face.  Cas followed, then Mary, who had a dark look on her face.
“I would have done it if I needed to,” Cas said honestly.  He injected a little bit of venon into his tone and relished in the way Dean flinched.  “Regardless of what affection I may have held for you in the past.”
The concept was so foreign to Cas he had to shake his head a little to make the pieces fall into place. “Sorry?”
Cas puts it away slowly, but he does put it away.  When it’s back in his pocket, he looks back up at Dean, all wide blue eyes and concern.  “Are you feeling okay?  Or… did you… want to talk?”
scream into a pillow.  He pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Do you think that’s why he doesn’t date?”
There were bags under Bobby’s eyes.  Cas gave him a skeptical look.  “What, fishing at 2am?  You look like you haven’t slept in years.”
Sam nodded. It seemed like it should have been the end of the conversation, but Sam was still standing there, shifting from foot to foot.
Sam sighed, long and heavy. “Cas, I’m sorry my idiot brother lured you out of your office to talk to me, but I can’t take a break right now. I’m on leave next week, and I have to finish up these files before the end of the day.”
Cas thought of the smile on Dean’s face on that night and decided he wanted to see it again. “I think we both need to take a break,” he said, getting up from his little plastic table. “You from baking, me from eating.”
“Did you take that cough syrup I gave you?” Cas asks.  His gaze is sharp now as he surveys Dean’s face.
Cas’s mouth twitched upward.  “And yet throughout it all I could still barely keep my hands to myself.”
Cas stared at him, disbelieving.  “‘I’m your ride,’” he repeated.  His voice shook.  He felt manic.  “You made me believe you were a traitor to the country, Dean.  I treated you like
Cas laughed, his breath warm against Dean’s shoulder. His hand was a brand against Dean’s back. “I didn’t think it was possible for someone to hug so resentfully.”
Dean’s thoughts were being pulled in every direction.  He struggled to stay with the conversation, though his head was running through the number of possibilities of running into Daphne if he visited Sam any time soon.
He started getting up, but Cas grabbed his hand before he could walk away. If Dean was going to leave him anyway, Cas might as well say it all. “I’m never going to have that apple pie life, Dean.”
Dean didn’t know who else to call.  He couldn’t call Charlie - that was a conversation he needed to have in the daylight, with plenty of witnesses around in case she decided Dean’s life was forfeit for trying to set her up with a gay man who was interested only in Dean - and it was past midnight, so Sam was most likely asleep.  Cas was the last choice, and really, Dean’s
Cas swallowed.  Dean watched his eyes dance between his own.  Finally Cas said, “Yes.  You asshole, you know it’s a yes.”
Dean hadn’t told her all the details.  He’d fudged some of them on purpose, actually, but the gist had remained the same: Charlie had been upset for some reason, and Dean had gone to see her.  He tried to smile, but it probably came out more like a wince.  “Didn’t open the door, actually.”
Cas suddenly realizes how much he’s missed sitting in the passenger seat of Dean’s car.  The trips they’ve taken recently have only been fraught with worry and tension, and Cas desperately wants to correct that. “If you’ll have me,” he replies.
After a few long seconds, Cas’s hands lifted.  Dean braced himself, but Cas was only leaning in to touch Dean’s face.  “I knew you were beautiful,” Cas whispered, “but now that you’re mine, you’re stunning.”  Then his hands were skimming down Dean’s ribs, settling at Dean’s waist.  Dean gritted his teeth.  Cas kissed his forehead, and that was the only warning Dean had for what happened next: Cas hooked both hands on Dean’s shoulders and swung his body around to settle his weight on Dean’s thighs.
“She is very cute,” Cas agreed.  “I didn’t expect Sam to get a pit bull, in all honesty.  I was expecting something looked upon as more… wholesome.”  He picked up Willow and brought her to his face.  She began licking his nose, her back legs kicking in the air in excitement.  “I’m glad they picked her, though.  Pit bulls get such a bad reputation because their owners mistreat them.”
Cas groaned.  He removed the hand that had been gripping Dean’s arm with all the force of a vice grip and wrapped it around Dean’s, directing Dean to squeeze a little harder, stroke a little faster.
“But I can’t be sure,” Cas continued, staring at his hands, palms up on his lap.  “And I just wanted you to know.”  He sounded so lost, so desperately lost, but Dean was no better off.
Cas dug his palms into his eyes and snorted; he could never be impartial when it came to Dean. “They’re fine,” he mumbled, groggy from overindulgence. “They’re wonderful, so please, no more.” He was seated at a small plastic table Dean had set up in the kitchen, and the heat in the kitchen was making his shirt stick to his back with sweat.
It had to be Dean. No one else Cas knew would text him this early in the day. Cas’s stomach flipped at just the thought. He didn’t need to read the message to know that he’d spend the next few hours stifling a smile at the thought of Dean.
It took a while, but Cas’s phone vibrated just as he was falling asleep on the couch in the dim light of the Netflix menu screen.
The way Cas said it - quiet, hesitant, maybe even a little nervous - made Dean look a little closer. He saw it then: the tiniest bob of Cas’s throat. The subtle lift of his chest as he took a steadying breath. The way his eyes danced between Dean’s, searching for an answer.
Cas kissed him, helpless in Dean’s hands. When he drew back, he said, “Just because it bears repeating: my feelings for you are unconditional. Bakery or not.”
Dean rolled his eyes.  “Yeah, not happening.”  He opened his car door.  “Stay safe for me, alright, bud?”
This was the angry interrogation that Dean had expected when he’d walked back into his apartment, and strangely enough he took comfort in it. It was better than Cas with a shaking voice and tears in his eyes. “The sky’s falling because I believed I’d never have you.”
was terrified, Dean couldn’t comprehend. Maybe Cas was terrified of the crimes Dean was capable of, and maybe law enforcement was coming to serve justice.
if this changes things,” Cas said quickly, almost laced with desperation.  His eyes were almost overflowing.  “But I needed to tell you; I just couldn’t take it another second, Dean.  I’m sorry.”
And despite Cas only being a few dozen miles away, distance was not what Dean meant when he thought,
Cas didn’t bother arguing.  He was too busy smiling, too busy soaking in the anticipation of what was going to happen next, too busy trying to memorize the way Dean’s eyes shined in the reflection of the string lights outside, the warmth of Dean’s skin under his palm, the affection in the upturn of Dean’s mouth.
Dean ran a hand over his chin. “I mean, sure am eating well,” he said, laughing a little. “Could do with a little more sleep, though. Bakery’s actually closed tomorrow so I can sleep in a little.”
meant a past, and regardless of the stupid shit Dean pulled over the years, it was a past that no one could erase, not even Daphne.
The stay-at-home order continues. The four weeks that the governor’s data had projected at the beginning passes as cases have not shown a decline. Quarantine edges into months. Cas’s hair gets long and Dean laughs every time he catches sight of him. Then one day he runs his hands through it in passing, and neither of them laugh.  Dean just quirks a smile and takes his coffee and goes into his room to start work, and Cas collapses into an armchair because he’s in love with his best friend and can’t stand it.
Eventually Dean pulled into Cas’s neighborhood and idled outside the building. Cas rarely found himself in this position, in the passenger seat of a date’s car, about to end the night, so he found he didn’t know what to say.
All throughout this exchange, the rest of the group had been murmuring softly against the backdrop of barking dogs and children yelling in the distance.  Dean had assumed they’d been giving him and Gilda some space, but once he’d dropped Gilda’s hand and they both looked around, he noticed two of the group missing.
He shed his jacket once he got inside, then pulled his phone from his back pocket.  Cas was #1 on speed dial, so it was just a matter of tapping the 1 and pressing the call button.  But Dean’s finger paused before it made contact with the screen.
Cas sent him a dry look, though it was somewhat undercut by the pink of his nose.  “No, you haven’t.  You haven’t even had six weeks.”
“Already read it,” Dean said, biting down on a grin when he saw Cas’s surprise. “Dude, I introduced you to his stuff - you think I don’t know what he’s up to?”
Cas’s smile was amused and affectionate, one that he tried to hide in his mug.  Dean let himself bask in the warmth.
Dean swallowed his terror and joined Cas at the dining table. He touched the manuscript and did his real penance: he told the truth. “This... is
Dean scrubbed a hand over his face. “Okay, dude,” he said, “I get it.”  He grumbled, but still he reached forward to pull Cas in for a one-handed hug.
Cas’s cheeks bloomed red.  The hands he had on Dean’s waist clutched a little harder.  “Why didn’t you ever - ?”
Cas was distracted by Dean’s lips. He’d never allowed himself to dwell on the thought of them, but now he could barely concentrate on anything else. “What offer are talking about?”
Dean stamped down the seed of disappointment that had just begun to sprout.  “‘Course, man.  I’ll see you soon.  Take care of my sister, alright?”
“Anything,” he repeated.  “Anything besides betray the bureau.  Which is why it’s so ridiculous that of all the things, that’s exactly what
“You’re reading the wrong authors then,” Dean said, confident in a way he couldn’t be about anything else.
, like their future involved spending Christmas together and roasting turkey together and making traditions together.  He felt his hands start to shake a little.  He shoved them into oven mitts and shooed Dean away.
Bobby looked Cas in the eye solemnly.  “Trying to deal with your best friend coming back into your life.  It’s easier to believe the worst about him, so you do.”  He shrugged.  “But you don’t, not really.”
Cas was starting to get it. He chose his next words carefully. “If you’re uncomfortable with the concept of being engaged to me, however—”
So he moves in. Cas’s apartment is suddenly full of beat-up boxes, most shoved under tables and stashed in corners, ready to be moved again for when Dean finds a place of his own.  Dean takes a few of the boxes into Cas’s spare bedroom.
Cas didn’t know who called out, but he was glad it didn’t have to be him.  Guns drawn, he and the agents rose from where they had been waiting and approached the pair, who had immediately put their hands up when they heard the command.  Dean had pushed his companion behind him when he saw the guns.  Whoever it was could barely be seen behind Dean’s torso.
Dean had handed Cas a key six months prior and told him, “Figured someone should have a spare key for emergencies, and Sammy’s three hours away, so. Congrats.” Cas had slid it onto his keyring later on that night, and for six months afterward tried and failed to stop thinking about the intimacy implied in the gesture.
Dean’s disappointment was lessened by the fact that Jack quickly became just as attached to Dean as he was to his foster dad, so if Dean spent a few days a week at Cas’s place to “help out with the baby,” no one questioned his motives.
Bobby gave him a withering look.  “I was head of the goddamn FBI before you were even out of high school.  Of course I know he’s a felon.  That’s a stupid-ass question.  I was asking because I was concerned about
VI.  	It was Cas’s first time out of the house without having to walk into an office and see Dean.  It was a Saturday morning, and it was quiet, and it was nice not to have the presence of a felon at the back of his mind.  He was in a good mood.  Coffee in his favorite diner didn’t hurt, either.
Ten minutes later and Dean was struggling to counter all of Gilda’s smiles.  Everything she said was laced with sincerity, and while Dean could tell she was genuinely pleased to be spending time with him, he was equally convinced that she would be pleased to be spending time with literally anyone in the world.  He liked her.  But he didn’t
They seated themselves in the Impala a while later, and Dean drove them out onto the freeway. Cas didn’t ask where they were going, and even if he had asked, Dean would have had no answer. He’d just wanted to give Cas time to think in a space where nothing was expected of him, and that space was here, in Dean’s car, where all Cas needed to do was exist.
Cas was taking his time constructing his burger. He didn’t ask himself why. “He said something similar about you, actually. Said you like to feed people more than they can eat.”
Dean was examining the crumb of the lemon bar, holding it up to the light. “We’d never open if I tasted them. I need an impartial judge.”
“When would one begin telling a child about Santa? And how does one deal with the inevitable fallout when they realize he isn’t real?”
“I didn’t think I’d have to use it,” Cas admitted. He felt crumbs on his chin and attempted a half-hearted swipe to get rid of them.
Cas looked over his shoulder. Sure enough, he could see Sam craning his neck to watch them walk away. He froze as soon as he made eye contact with Cas. Cas laughed as he looked forward. “You’re right. I should have known.”
“Oh,” Charlie said.  “Not far, apparently.  Gilda said he’s been staying at Sam’s.  He actually dropped by Gilda’s place today to talk to Daphne.”
Dean was staring at Cas’s profile so much it was a miracle he made it to the front door without running into a table. Once there, he opened the door for Cas, and stared openly at Cas’s face like he was afraid Cas would vanish if he looked away.
Cas looked down at his outfit. He was still in his button-down from work, but he couldn’t be bothered to change. He left his apartment a few seconds after sending Dean a thumbs-up.
Sometimes Cas got caught up in his writing, and sometimes Dean got caught up with paperwork at the garage, but neither of them had ever knowingly just
Meanwhile, Cas plucked out another onion slice. “I don’t think I believed in Santa,” he said eventually. “But I knew about him. I wish I could remember who first told me the tale.”
Claire’s face was red. She lingered at the door, her throat moving. She looked apprehensively at Dean and Cas. “You did this?”
They’d met four years before through Eileen. She and Cas had gone to school together, and when Cas had first moved to the city, he’d ended up running into her and Sam at a cooking class. It had been the couple’s third date. Sam, probably wanting to make a good impression, had invited Cas to his birthday barbecue, and Cas, not wanting to appear rude, had accepted.
Cas turns around from where he’s standing in front of the stove.  He’s holding a spatula.  He’s wearing Dean’s shirt.  He has pancake batter on his left eyebrow.  “Hello,” he says mournfully.  “I burned the pancakes.”
“You’ve also got a hand up my shirt,” Dean supplies unhelpfully, “if you wanted to get around to removing that.”
“Who says I’m taking it seriously?” Dean asks.  “Kisses don’t have to be serious.” His grin is wide, and Cas is taken in by it like he always is when Dean’s happiness lights up his eyes.
Cas looked away, feeling exposed under Dean’s scrutiny. “You said a few things,” he said, not wanting to be untruthful, especially not to Dean, who could read Cas’s face from a mile away.  “Not sure if you meant any of it.”
Cas looked at his shoes. “Yes, well, when your best friend nearly faints in your kitchen, celebrations kind of take the back burner.”
There was a long pause.  When Cas did speak, the room seemed deathly still.  “And what, pray tell, do I need help with?”
It’s not easy, but Dean eventually closes his mouth.  He’s shocked and amazed and pleased and conflicted, but mostly he feels undeserving.  Nothing about Dean has the right to make such a difference in anybody else’s life, especially not in a life like Cas’s, not even in the life of Dream Cas.
Cas heaved a huge sigh eventually. He stood up. Dean closed his eyes; they stung all of a sudden. He steeled himself for the sound of the door opening, then closing. He steeled himself for silence.
Cas hauled himself up from the couch and gladly joined Dean in his kitchen as Dean slid a large portion of pie onto a saucer.  Cas handed his phone to Dean.  “Tell them hi,” he said, then took a fork from his drawer.
“Yeah,” Charlie said, a bit too readily for Dean’s taste, “Probably a good idea.  By the way, sorry for not responding to your messages.”  She paused.  “Gilda and I have been… getting to know each other.”
When he woke up the next morning, he had a pounding headache and a notepad full of drunken lovesick poetry in his hand.
“No, no,” Dean said, laughing to cover up his nerves. “It’s just - some of the authors I work with - y’know, they’re - secretive about - “
But Cas is looking over Dean’s shoulder now, at some dream within a dream, and he’s still talking.  “I used to think that to be ‘just’ anything would be a waste of my life.  But now I’m okay with being ‘just’ me.”  He shakes himself out of his reverie and meets Dean’s eyes with absolute sincerity.  “Much of that has to do with you, of course.”
It was obvious he’d taken some time and effort to look good, and Dean appreciated it.  When he shook Aaron’s hand, it was with genuine pleasure.  “Nice to see you, dude.”
“So you guys really haven’t eloped yet?” she asked, almost incredulously. “We took bets on it at home.”
, but Dean.  His Dean.  The Dean he thought he’d never see again.  Cas covered his eyes with the palm of his good hand and tried to breathe through the mess of confusion and sharp-tipped joy in his heart.  “I don’t understand any of this.”
Dean didn’t know how he had any tears left in him. “Jesus. Give a guy a break,” he said, his voice cracking.
Anxiety worms its way under Cas’s skin, but he’s determined to quash it. He moves toward the sink near Dean to start dinner. He had plans to make a pot of chili again, but for the life of him he can’t remember where to start. After washing his hands, he opens the cupboard and grabs a few spices that sound familiar. Dean is still leaning against the counter a few feet away.
“Yeah. Anyway, just think about it, alright?” Sam lifted a hand in an awkward goodbye before walking out into the hallway.
At some point Cas presses even closer.  The warmth in Dean’s gut builds to a dangerous simmer.  His hands cling desperately to Cas’s ribcage.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I just wanna get out of his hair, alright? It’s bad enough I’m sick; I shouldn’t have to make anyone my nurse, especially on a fucking holiday.”
Cas walked over to join him at the window. It was near freezing outside, and neither of them were dressed for the cold. Without asking, he shut the window. The sounds of passersby and traffic below were muffled instantly, replaced by the rustle of their clothes as they shifted to accommodate each other.
Cas leaned forward and stole Dean’s champagne flute from his hand.  He drained it.  He wiped at his mouth primly with a napkin then said, “Whatever you were thinking a few seconds ago was either inappropriate or ridiculous, and I suggest you stow it away for another occasion.”
Cas handed over his phone with a theatrical sigh. They put their heads together for the next 10 minutes coming up with Cas’s next move.
That, at least, Cas could relate to.  He lifted his coffee mug and took a long gulp, burned tongue be damned.
Dean called about a day later, sounding exhausted.  “It’s been so long since I’ve been home for the holidays.  Forgot how crazy things got.  I swear there’s 50 people downstairs.  Oh,
The occupants of the backyard turned to look.  Charlie was there, playing with Willow.  Gilda was in a shawl and smiling at Charlie.  Bobby was halfway through a burger, and Mary - Mary was turned toward Cas.
Dean wanted nothing to do with that particular train of thought.  Eileen had already rejoined the conversation at the commotion, but Gilda was looking at Dean with a frown.  It was the first frown Dean had ever seen on her face, and her sincerity touched Dean.
“First of all,” Cas said, very slowly, not wanting to speak but wanting to put the record straight, “You and I are not ‘partners’; I’m an FBI Special Agent, and you’re a convicted felon who had the good fortune to be useful to the bureau.”  He conceded an irritated huff.  “Also, please refer to ‘Amara’ as ‘director,’ or ‘ma’am.’”
There was a long pause.  “Thanks, I guess,” Dean replied quietly.  “A ‘Merry Christmas’ would have done, though.”
Dean knew that delaying the news of Cas and Daphne didn’t mean delaying it forever; one day, he’d be forced to acknowledge their relationship, and that might very well turn out be the day of their wedding.  He knew he was being irrational by making this request of Cas, knew it would make no difference in the end when Cas was with Daphne and Dean was alone.  But still, he found himself wishing, hoping -
he definitely wasn’t twenty-something anymore either.  Going in made him feel skeevy, and indeed, a few girls who looked barely legal to be drinking started whispering behind their manicured hands as they passed by.  Dean knew he should have stayed home.
That got Dean to eventually stagger to his feet. His clothes reeked, so he was glad to leave them in a pile on the floor as he stepped into the shower. He ran the water and slowly, painstakingly, scrubbed himself of the stench of the bar they’d been in, washing it out of his hair and from under his arms.
