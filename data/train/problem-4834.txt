The journey upstairs was slow and painful, but he made it, struggling to catch his breath on the top landing.
“Yeah, Dean, I really do. I can see myself growing old with him, you know? He makes me so fucking happy, happier than I’ve been in such a long time. And I just…” Sam shrugged and Dean nodded, understanding.
Jo trailed after her, a lot calmer than Charlie. “Finally, Charlie has been driving me crazy with plan D.E.S.T.I.E.L.”
I have no idea what happened, but Charlie can probably find proof that something happened. Better safe than sorry.

“You’re welcome. Now, I wished I had time to eat with you, but I have to go and get everything ready at the store. I’ll see you tonight, right?” Since Dean had his mouth stuffed full, all she got was a nod from him in answer. “Great! Love you, honey. Bye!”
“Dean’s-easy-sex-to-intimate-endless-love, D.E.S.T.I.E.L for short. Do you get it? Dean, Castiel, Destiel.”  From the smile on Charlie’s face, you could think she just came up with the solution to world's hunger.
They ate their dessert and talked a little about work before changing the subject to Ryan and their brothers. They bounced ideas back and forth about what they were going to do for home improvements over the summer. They argued over Castiel’s choice of car – “It’s a Prius, dude!” “Its got great gas mileage, Dean”.
Dean couldn’t argue with that; the man was ridiculously attractive. “Okay. Well, do you know how he takes his coffee?”
“Hi! You mind if I join you guys while I wait for Sam to show up?” asked Castiel.
Cas opened the top, squeezing a good amount from it, before leading a slicked-up finger to Dean’s entrance. They groaned in unison as Dean’s body gave way, sucking Cas greedily inside.
- Supernatural -
Once Dean turned around and saw Cas watching him, he tensed slightly before bowing his head to read the chart in his hands. Cas swallowed his disappointment at the intentional slight. He took a deep breath and stepped closer towards him, seeing Dean’s jaw muscles tightening each step Cas took.
“I hate you,” said Dean as he sat down and snatched the plate Castiel had just put in front of Charlie before she could take a bite.
“You expect us to believe a boy your age started an essay the same day he got it?” asked Crowley suspiciously.
“Ah. Wouldn't you like to know?” Dean winked conspiratorially, and smiled slyly.
“Fair enough,” Sam shrugged as he took the folder and put it back into his schoolbag. When he went to close it, Charlie saw a corner of a book between all of Sam’s schoolbooks. Charlie was pretty sure it was the same book she had in her bookshelf at home.
“I just wanted to enjoy this for a little while before everyone starts asking questions. You know Charlie and Jo are going to give us the third degree, about how it happened, if we’ve gone on any dates, when our first kiss was, all of that when they find out, right?”
When Charlie was about to tell Sam where he could stick his proposition, Sam quickly said, “Just let me finish before you say anything.”
Cas grinned up at him, all dimples and gums and crinkly eyes. Dean wanted to keep that smile on his face forever. He navigated them through the throng and outside. He pointed to his car. "Hop in."
Alistair hit Dean one more time, just for good measure, before Lucifer dropped him and the two followed after Sam. That punch had been so hard that Dean had a hard time catching his breath afterwards. He’s woken up with a bruise the size of Texas along his right side and pain every time he inhaled deeply.
Castiel didn’t think he’d ever had a better date before.
Dean quickly loaded the dishes into the dishwasher, before closing it and putting it on a short cleaning program.
The words slowly worked through Cas’ sleep-addled mind, his eyes opening suddenly. He blinked up at Dean, half surprised to see him still there and dressing quickly. Right. Intimate evening… twice. Cas sat up, swinging his legs off the side of the bed with a soft groan.
He chuckles and shakes his head. "Is Dean around?"
Ash had fallen asleep in the middle of the movie, like usual, Benny and Gabriel were talking about who knew what, and not wanting to be stuck with Sam, Dean quickly got and said, “I’m going to get more snacks!” before he headed to the kitchen area.
“Did you see the memo?” she asked as she threw herself into the chair across from Dean.
“Space isn’t an issue,” Castiel replied as he stopped beside Dean and met the man’s eyes. “Which one would you choose?”
“Fuck,” Dean swore, groaning as he pushed up onto his arms. He looked down at Castiel, shaking his head. “I left the chair in front of the counter, too. I had it out so Ry could help me make breakfast this morning.”
Of course we still on for The Walking Dead! Get ready to loose the “Who does Negan kill” bet.
Charlie huffed to herself and tried her best not to glare at the front of the classroom.
“Yeah, mhm, okay” Sam replied tightly but made no attempt to move.
hands dirty, but he was more than likely to be the mastermind behind all of this.
“I should stop you from talking,” Dean winced as Charlie gripped his hands this side of too tight.
Castiel took a deep breath and let it out slowly before he continued, “The first year after he passed, none of us did anything. It was too painful but afterwards it just felt… wrong, like we had let him down. So, after that we decided to swap years between us all, one of us would host Thanksgiving and Christmas, like Jimmy used to do.” Castiel sniffed as he gave Dean a small smile. “Thanksgiving was… interesting, to say the least. But no one left with food poisoning and it was nice to have everyone at my house. But, Christmas is… different. It feels more important and with this being my first year…” Castiel swallowed hard, “I hope I can make him proud.”
Realizing he just shoved his foot in his mouth, and half ass flirted with someone who is his boss’ boss, Dean hurried out the door before he could make even more of a fool out of himself.
“Morning sweetheart!” came his mother’s voice right below him. “How are you feeling?”
A sardonic voice drifts across to him and he glances up through his fingers to see Balthazar standing at the nurses station, leaning a hip against the desk and watching him with a twisted little smile on his lips. Dean groans inwardly. As nice as he can be, Doctor Roche is the last person he wants to see. He trained as a Resident under Balthazar and has seen his hard side.
“I should be the one apoligizing for keeping you out so late.” Castiel reached down and gave Dean’s hand a gentle squeeze. “Thank you again, Dean. I couldn’t have done this without you.”
- Supernatural -
Castiel smiled then, cocking his head to the side to meet Dean’s eyes. “I would love to get dinner with you, Dean.”
Charlie glared at his hand and ignoring it as she said, “I have less than a hour before I have to go meet Dean. What do you need help with?”
“You alright my boy?”
“Because it will be so much easier for me if you’re not constantly worrying about getting into colleges,” said Dean with a small smile.
John is going to be in charge.
When Dean walked into the changing room, he found it
Even though he’d been expecting something, the punch to his face caught him off guard and he fell completely on the ground. With his hands still tied behind his back, it was impossible for him to even try to defend himself or to get up on his feet. As kick after kick landed on him, Dean knew he’d be feeling this for weeks. Finally, after what felt like hours, they stopped.
With just raising an eyebrow, Charlie made it crystal clear that she was not going to say anything else until Sam explained himself.
It was easy for Dean to decide which one of the pictures was his favorite. In the middle of the magazine was ‘Misha the Pizza Guy’, who just happened to look a lot like Castiel. They both had blue eyes, dark short hair, and were very,
Castiel groaned around his first bite of pie, nodding as he chewed it up. “You were right,” he grinned at Dean as he licked a few flakes of oreo crust from his lips, “this tastes just like Christmas Day.”
be a few minutes!" Cas yanked a hand through his hair and stared down at her.
“Some things shouldn't be sweet,” Dean answered, raising an eyebrow as he glanced over at the honey. “Coffee is one of them.”
“Sam!” called Castiel, shocked at his friend’s outburst.
“But, he takes it to the extreme. I had been so against him going to medical school at first… there are just some people you can’t please, no matter what you do, just as there’s some people you can’t save. I knew that Dean would take each and every one of those situations as a personal failure, and it would eventually break him apart.”
“Touche.” Dean chuckled, his throat clicking as he swallowed. “It wasn’t something that I wanted to be when I was a kid. I wanted to be famous, actually. An actor or a rockstar. I didn’t care.”
on dating sites, maybe Dean should be giving that a go again…
“Hey, Claire,” Castiel laughed as he bent his knees and stood again, his niece in his arms. The smile on his face had Dean smiling just as wide. “Amelia,” Castiel continued, shifting Claire onto his hip and holding out an arm. A woman stepped forward and fell into the hug.
“Nothing I can’t handle,” replied Dean, just barely sticking his fork into the next bite before his mom pulled the plate away and stood up.
Jumping back onto the bed, Dean got comfortable resting against the headboard. He’d hardly gotten the chance to flip through the first pages and admire the view when both the girls demanded that he share. Why Charlie wanted to see some pictures of
Dean nodded. Shitty days he could handle. He was a pro at shitty days. "On a scale of
"Merry Christmas," Dean answered back.
“I’ve been better. I just need a little time to wrap my head around everything. Like the fact that John likes to take his kids and their friends on huge family vacations everywhere. Oh! Or that my friend is the son of the famous writer that wrote the Supernatural books. Why didn’t you mention that?” asked Dean and thankfully Castiel let him change the subject even though he knew what Dean was trying to do.
“Have you talked to Charlie yet?” asked Benny as he and Dean walked into the gym the next Monday.
“It’s fine, I’ll find out what is causing it and fix it for you. Why don’t do go and get it and I’ll go open the door, okay?”
“Ohh, don’t worry about it. I came here right after school and I managed to finish all my homework. Then I started reading my dad’s next book and I totally lost track of time. He usually makes me a copy and asks me for my opinion before he has them published,” Castiel answered as he picked up the book to show it to Dean.
It took Dean a while to wrap his head around what just happened. Sam had just invited him to a party! Of course, it wasn’t because
“Now here’s the real question,” Castiel said with a smile, “do they have those frozen, simply ‘okay’ onion rings or do they have the real, freshly battered onion rings?”
Sam rolled his eyes and nodded his head.
“Of course, you would.” Castiel laughed, reaching forward to scoop a bite for himself.
“It doesn’t matter. You’re still my patient. Now sit tight while I make you something to eat.”
“His parents are going through a rough spot and Sam is just worried they might get divorced. Apparently, his dad is supposedly still in love with his ex or something... To make matters worse, there is some kid at school who keeps rubbing it in… Why are you laughing? I know he was rude to you but that no reason to…”
“I was twelve, give me a break! Besides, you’ve seen what this town has to offer. You and Dean don’t exactly have many good guys to choose from.” Benny shrugged, looking away from Jo and then addressing the entire group. “I mean, there is no wonder Charlie is gay.”

Hope you guys enjoyed the chapter and like always all comments and kudos are loved!
“Good, now here’s who got on the final list.”
Castiel hummed, wrapping an arm around Dean and sinking them both back into the pillows. Dean shifted to he was laying against Castiel’s chest, the other man running his hand up and down his back.
“I wanted to see you,” Dean replied, hoping to placate Jo, while also drawing her away from the thorny subject of their brother.
“Lets see if you’re telling the truth, Mr. Novak.” Mr. Devereaux started typing away at the keyboard, turning the overhead screen off as he searched for what he was looking for. Castiel waited patiently for the paranoid man, slightly curious to see what he would be able to dig up. The rest of the students stayed silent, a thrum of nervous excitement at the ‘new kid’ already being in trouble running through them. Dean rolled his eyes and started working on his drawing again, talking to Castiel in a low voice. “Interesting” and “Huh” was muttered a few times from their teacher until finally, he looked up with a wide smile and flicked the screen back on.
“Hey, sweetie! How was your day?” asked Mary as she put the tray down and started making two cups of hot chocolate. She pulled out two plates and served up a slice of blueberry pie on one plate and a chocolate cake piece on the other.
“Because I know how to fix your computer?” Ash half asked only to get a “You mean, you know how to use it, unlike Benny,” from Dean.
They stayed intertwined until the timer went off on the oven, prompting Dean to groan and press his head against Cas’ shoulder. Cas chuckled at him and stepped back, moving to grab the oven mitts and take the pie from the oven.
Dean wheeled into a parking spot at
Dean thought to his own relationship with Sammy, how they’d had their fair share of disagreements over the years, including the year and a half they only spoke via text. He can’t even remember the fight now, but he remembered how heavy he’d felt until they both pulled their big boy pants on and got over it.
Dean was in such a great mood the rest of the week that not even John’s long, dreadful detentions could bring him down. Hell, even Sam and his friends seemed to have forgotten about him for the time being. Even so, as far as he was concerned, the weekend couldn’t come fast enough.
Dean paced the front of the shop, Sam clicking away on the computer behind him.
Cas turned off the stove as he pushed Dean against the counter, bending to nip at his jaw. Dean groaned in response to the manhandling, his dick twitching in his sweatpants, pretty much begging for some attention.
“Of course. It’s my job.” He glances back over his shoulder to see Bobby leaning over and kissing Ellen’s hand as she smiles through her pain. “And I’ve been pretty damn selfish. You’re right. I need to be around for this family more. I will be. I swear.”
Dean, who was now lying on the floor trying to get the magazine with the help of Jo and two pens, turned his head to look back at Benny. “So you gave me a condom and a banana instead?”
None of you are going to get it, I want it buried with me, so I can listen to ‘Highway to hell’ on my way to the afterlife.
“Uncle Cassie!”
“Who?” Charlie asked, shaking her head. “Jo didn’t say anything about Sam’s boy being in the hospital… they talk almost every day.”
Dean heard hurried footsteps coming towards him, then there were hands on his shoulder shaking him, gently but firmly.
Sam waited patiently while Dean used the bathroom and brushed his teeth, then both brothers went downstairs together. The tree was lit up, the plate of Santa's cookies mostly eaten and a huge hunk taken out of the carrot --
If the thirty messages that Dean got from her over the rest of the weekend were any indication, she probably was. It didn’t mean that Dean was ready to forgive her anytime soon though. “I don’t care. She can go crying to Sam for all I care.”
you and the others leave Dean alone.”
“I would never!” said Charlie offended. Adding, “I wouldn’t!” after getting an eye-roll from all of her friends. Suddenly Charlie’s eyes widened and she said, “I just remember, I have to be somewhere. Bye!” before she stood up and left the cafeteria.
Charlie pursed her lips, thinking. Dean simply nodded, eating a few more crackers. He wondered how Sam and Castiel had met… he didn’t picture Castiel as the online dating type, and last he’d heard, that’s what Sam had been trying. If people like Castiel
The girls got the whole story from Castiel with few details from Dean. For an example, they got to hear
“We were. That’s from the engagement party I threw for them,” said Dean with a small smile as he reached to take the photo from Cas. It had been a long time since he let himself look at photos of her; the last time had probably been at the funeral. Somehow, seeing her wasn’t as hard as he imagined… Maybe it was because he could hear Sam and Luc laughing at something in the kitchen behind him. “It was awesome, if I do say so myself. I took them to laser tag. Sammy hated the idea at first, but Eileen loved it.”
“Yeah, that’s gonna happen, right after we find the solution to world hunger,” said Dean, and he meant every word of it. It wasn’t that he didn’t
“I wish I could take the credit for that, but you’re going to have to thank my mom. I don’t know how she does it, but she seems to have a sixth sense about what people like or dislike.”
“It’s okay, I think she knew. Did you have to wait long?” asked Dean as he started on his pie. He didn’t think he had ever waited so long to start eating when he’d the pie right in front of him.
is super busy these days, I checked if someone else was willing to help too.
“Mmhmm, is that any way to talk to your mother?” said Mary with a chuckle. Dean gave her a sheepish smile in response. “Now, how do you feel? And no ‘I’m fine’ bullshit, Dean Winchester.”
It took Dean a moment to realize what it was that woke him. There was someone knocking on the bedroom’s door. Quite insistently, in fact. It was much too light to be Sam, so whoever it was had to be looking for Castiel.
“Boys, this nice officer would like to talk to you,” said Mary.
Digging out his phone, Cas saw he had unread messages from Dean’s friends, Jo, Ash, Benny, and Charlie. The messages contained Mary’s contact information, which he no longer needed, general concerns and asking what was going on. Cas sent out a group text to them all, thanking them for Mary’s information and updating them with what he knew and that he would see them all tomorrow at school. Then, he closed out and hovered over Sam’s name.
Castiel gave a small laugh at that and Dean found himself smiling wider.
He was still half awake when he heard Castiel come into the room. When he opened one eye, he saw Cas standing at the door with his arms full of Dean’s clothes and looking at Dean with a fond look on his face.
“Who are you and what have you done with my boyfriend?” joked Dean as he joined Castiel on the bed.
The person had his head buried in a book in front of him, which explained why Dean hadn’t seen him. Even though the trench coat was a dead give away, Dean would have recognized Castiel straight away without it. He was so deep into the book that he didn’t notice Dean until one of the mugs of hot cocoa was slid beside his book.
And like always, a huge round of applause to my two wonderful betas
Dean leaned forward and gestured to Bobby to come closer, almost like he wanted to whisper something to him. But his voice was loud and carried as he said, “He’s mean. You sure you’re not my daddy?”
“Oh yeah, I can see that,” Sam commented. “Though, you’re not supposed to date your patients.”
Clarie looked him in the eyes for a few seconds before she looked out the window and Dean turned his attention back to the road. Neither of them said anything more after that. The only sound around them was the purr of the engine and the Christmas song playing on the radio. It wasn’t until Dean turned the car unto his street that Claire said quietly, “There was no ornament with his name on it. It was like-- they forgot him.”
Lifting an eyebrow, Dean said, “You sleep like the dead. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve poked you just to see if you’re alive.”
“Dean! Why haven’t you gone home? Your shift ended half an hour ago. And why have you still not spoken to Sam?”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean greeted in a low voice.
“Fair is fair,” Castiel whispered as he toyed with the hem of Dean’s shirt, waiting for permission before removing it and tossing it in the general vicinity of where Dean had flung his.
Dean nodded and shuffled over to where Sam was sitting, showing him the gift. Together, each brother took a side and pulled the paper free, revealing a large framed photograph. It was a black and white photo, blown up from a the newspaper story, highlighting Winchester Auto when it was first opened. In front of the shop, John Winchester stood, leaning against the same black Chevy Impala that was parked out in Castiel's garage, his arm around Mary Winchester. Dean swallowed hard as he ran his fingers over the picture, lifting the frame up over Sam's lap so he could see it better.
Sighing, Dean forced himself up. With a few false starts, almost tumbling back to the ground on his face more than once, he was able to get to his feet. Happy for the small victory, he tried getting back to town on his own, but he’d only made it a few steps before his vision started to go black. He must have managed to sit down against the nearest tree before he blacked out.
“Cas, wake up, we gotta go man.” No response from his bed mate.
“But --”
, Gabriel playing pranks on Lucas and Castiel as if he were being paid to do so, Anna mother henning each of her brothers - and all four of them taking it, too. They were loud and boisterous and slightly obnoxious at times, but they made Dean and Sam feel like family, too, the moment they walked through the door.
“Yeah, you can take her and bring her back tomorrow. Something tells me I don’t have to tell you to take good care of her. That boy said he’d meet you at your mom's place so you don’t have to go pick him up. Now, go home and get ready!”
“Well,” Castiel shrugged, holding out one of the forks, “no one is around to see us eating like animals.”
“So, I went over to Benny’s house to try to kick some sense into him after he’d ignored Dean for almost two days. When I got there, his mom just told me that he was in his room and I could just go right in. When I opened the door, the first thing I see is wide-eyed Benny reading Texas Hunky-something…”
“Gavin, can you go wake up Daddy for me?” asked Anna, as he walked into the living room, holding Sasha who’d just woken up from a nap. After a quick debate with his mom, Gavin eventually got up to go do what his mother said. Claire’s eyes followed after him the whole way.
, nothing else, not even who it was from. Even before Dean picked it up he could see that it was full of old newspapers clips, pictures, and pages that were covered in text.
Today’s one had been nothing but one hard task after the another. And this time, John hadn’t left him alone for a single minute. He had just stood there, watching, counting, and criticizing everything Dean did. If Dean didn’t do something a hundred percent up to John’s standards he would get a, “You call that a push-up, you pussy? Again!” and he would have to start over from the beginning. Which was why Dean was late, John had used every trick in the book to delay Dean. It was like he knew Dean had somewhere important to be. He had even
As Dean stood in line waiting to be served, trying to choose something - anything - for the handsome blue-eyed doctor, he spotted Charlie coming towards him. Maybe she might know how he took his coffee. “Hey, Bradbury,” he waved her over. “Do you know Doctor Novak?”
Rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, Dean entered the kitchen in search of coffee when he stopped in his tracks- Cas was there (He hadn’t left!!) and he was cooking bacon- from the smell of it. Dean wondered how he missed the smell of bacon- but that wasn’t the most important thing right now. Cas was wearing one of Dean’s aprons that were hung on the hook near the fridge- and nothing else. Dean felt all his blood flow south as he took in the sight in front of him. In the light of the day, Dean could see how muscular Cas actually was- he looked bulked up enough to easily be able to lift Dean against a wall to fuck him, but not so much that he looked like he was hopped up on steroids. Cas’ bare ass was calling to him like a siren, perfectly round and with bruises that looked suspiciously like Dean’s fingertips, and if Cas wasn’t standing so close to the stove, he would have went down on his knees and buried his face in that ass.
thought Dean as he to turn in his seat to look at Castiel while he tried to take in all the information that Frank was giving him. “I thought you were related to Lucifer,” whispered Dean to Cas when Mr. Devereaux turned his back to the class.
“Well, I wasn’t going to go look for it on the internet. Looking at that magazine was traumatizing enough!”
After taking a big bite of his food, Dean, with his mouth full, said, “I have no idea what you are talking about.”
years ultimate cleaning set.”
He jogged across the parking lot towards Castiel. “Hey!” he greeted him, reaching for his arm. There was an awkward moment where Castiel reached forward for a handshake, changing to mimic Dean’s movement instead, and Dean ended up grabbing his forearm.
He focused instead on Castiel swapping out the mugs and k-cups, turning his head to the side to cough into his elbow. He gave Dean a sheepish, apologetic smile, to which Dean responded with a good natured eye roll.  Castiel finished up, tossing the two used k-cups in the trash, before turning back with two steaming mugs. Dean smiled when he was handed his cup.
Castiel took a tentative sip, expecting the coffee to not be to his taste at all, but being pleasantly surprised to find that it was exactly how he liked it. “H-how did you know…?” He stammered, then trailed off.
But Sam was sick of being the mechanic’s kid, of only being recognized by their grease-stained jeans and coveralls, and wanted to be a
“Wait! You have some on your face, here let me get it for you,” came Cas raspy voice a few seconds later. “You sure you want some more? Because I think I have some more for you.”
“I hate you.”
Dean didn’t even think he could move as much as a single finger, but he forced himself to nod anyway. Bad idea. Gabriel just barely managed to get out of the way before Dean emptied his stomach all over the ground next to him. Somewhere far away he could make out soothing voices and a hand rubbing circles over his back. It would have been... nice, if only every part of his body wasn’t in pain right now.
“Very well. But you are not ready to be discharged yet, do you understand?”
“If I promise to rest more, will you at least tell me about the major incident?”
“It’s complicated, I can tell you everything I know when you get here. The important thing is that he’s gonna be fine.”
Dean tried to cover it up by clearing his throat, but Castiel was certain of what he had heard. He made a mental note to see if he could elicit that sound from him again.
The cast on his arm made cutting the pancakes up one handed a lot harder than he anticipated, and the syrup certainly didn’t help. “Cas is coming here straight after school, so I won’t even be alone all that long.”
I had planned for this to be a fluffy chapter, but my extremely un-fluffy mood wasn't co-operating, so you get a weird mishmash of fluff and smut instead. I really hope it isn't too unsatisfying to read, considering that I didn't end up writing most of what I had planned to.
. Crap.
“Yeah, it did,” said Dean in between a yawn. And it had been. It had been a long time since he’d been able to relax and just had fun, especially with Sam. “We should do it again soon.”
Castiel was still sound asleep next to him, so he added a little bit of pressure to the hand resting on Castiel’s chest and gave him a little shake. “Babe, there’s someone at the door,” muttered Dean, pulling the covers over his head and burying his face in the crook of his boyfriend's neck as soon as he knew Castiel was awake.
Dean took a deep breath and turned his head to look at house they were parked in front before turning back toward Cas.
“Dean Winchester! Why would you do that? I raised you better than that!” scolded Mary disappointingly.
Castiel reached out, holding his palm up for Sam who took his hand, grateful for the comfort.
“I can help you rewrite it, if you want,” offered Charlie as she ran her fingers through his hair. “Besides, it’s always easier to write it the second time.”
Dean laid out their spoils and Cas’ eyes widened when he saw the sandwiches. Dean handed him a paper plate, then set about adding lettuce and tomato to the sandwiches and adding a heaping pile of chips beside them. “You’re trying to kill me,” Cas commented, accepting the sandwich, his mouth already watering.
Dean turned his head towards where the sound came from and saw Sam standing at the entrance of the kitchen, facing away from them and still covering his eyes. Dean would have laughed at the situation if he had some air in his lungs.
Cas holds up his left hand, showing off the ring.
Eventually, Castiel had to cough, and it seemed to release him from the spell he had fallen under. Dean’s expression changed, and he hurriedly put down the drinks he was holding.
“Dude, did you hit your head in the last two weeks, or have you just forgot everything you know about me? He’s really not my type,” said Charlie offended.
Turns out Sam was almost finished with it. The two of them spent what was left of the hour talking about everything that happened so far in the book. It kind of surprised Charlie how much thought Sam put into the events and she was actually enjoying their conversation and debates about different foreshadowing and symbolisms. Sam had never showed any signs that he liked to read in the classes they have had together, he’d never paid any attention. He had always spent most of the time either sleeping or joking around with his friends.
Saturday. He had been pondering wearing his most obnoxious t-shirt for the day, but it seems that Charlie has been looking out for him again; some of his best clothes lay out on the couch for him to wear instead. Yeah, these are probably better for his career’s longevity... There’s a note pinned to them about a change of address for the venue.
Extended Edition movie to Dean.
Dean tightened his arms around Cas for a moment, before getting out of bed and pulling on a pair of sweatpants- Cas', probably, by the way they fit him. Dropping a soft kiss on his boyfriend's forehead, he headed down to see what everyone else was doing.
Dean snorted, laughing at the lewd wink Castiel gave him. “Go see if the tree looks straight,” Dean said with a shake of his head. Castiel took a few steps back and gave a shrug.
“What are you talking about?” Castiel furrowed his brows, his brain short circuiting as Dean nipped at his inner thigh. “What question?”
He let his eyes fall closed again, pulling the cover higher up his chest, though he knew sleep wouldn’t come again. The sound of Dean ushering his nephew around in the living room and the sound of the TV coming on, full blast before Dean could turn it down, was what he focused on until there was a soft knock on the door.
For Pete’s sake, he was Dean fucking Win -- Maybe he should just change his last name already. His mom had suggested it when he was younger and his grandparents made sure to bring it up every time he saw them. It wasn’t like Sam or John were quiet about how they felt about Dean using the name...
you.”
"So um…" Dean wiggles the sign.
It was moments like this, dead on his feet and impossibly overtired, but so irrevocably happy that made everything he’d gone through to get here worth it. The sleepless nights, trying to balance finishing up medical school with a hopelessly failing social life, bouncing between relationship after relationship with partners who never
Dean really didn’t need to be told twice and got straight to work. He busted his tail the entire day, with only a few exceptions where his mind wandered off and he started thinking about Castiel. By the afternoon, Bobby had come to the garage to help him work on the cars now that he was done with his paperwork.
“Oh, thanks.” How damn thoughtful was this guy?
Castiel smiled brightly as he brought their joined hands up to his lips and kissed each of Dean’s knuckles.
A few of the dads suggested celebrating by going out for pizza, their treat and everything. All of the other boys had jumped at the chance, but Dean hadn’t felt like celebrating anymore. Even though his mom kept pressuring him to join his team, he opted out, wanting to go home with her instead.
“Cas,” Dean breathed out against his boyfriend’s lips as the other man claimed him again, their bodies completely flush, chest to chest, hips to hip. Cas’ cock was thick and hot, digging almost painfully against the jut of Dean’s hip. Dean was sure he’d never wanted anyone so badly before in his life. He opened his mouth to say so, just as Cas pressed his lips to the shell of Dean’s ear.
Castiel sighed and leaned back against his pillows once more. Dean bent down to grab them, the strange feeling of being watched making him flush. Realistically, he knew Doctor Novak was probably glaring at his back, but the tiny brain that was connected to his dick was whispering he was staring at his ass.
over -, a set of wooden nutcrackers, and sparkly snowmen. He’d even gotten angel ornaments with each of their names on them: Claire, Castiel, Amelia, Michael & Lilly, Gabriel & Kali & Leigha, Anna & Fergus & Gavin & Sasha, and Lucas & Meg & Ronald.
“Fuck,” Castiel called out as he felt his orgasm building.
“How much did you hear?” asked Dean. A part of Dean was nervous about what Castiel would say, even though Cas had said that Sam was wrong.
“It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas,” Dean whisper sang, earning himself a smack on the ass as he ran up the stairs, Castiel close behind him.
Before Dean knew what was happening, Cas leaned down and swallowed him down in one motion, taking him in down to the base. Dean lifted his legs to rest them on Cas’ shoulders and moaned loudly as he thrust his hips into the tight, wet suction of Cas’ mouth.
“I’ve tried, okay? I really didn’t mean to laugh. She just doesn't believe me,” said Sam with a guilty look, one that Charlie was pretty sure was genuine.
don’t want to move on or date cause you still miss Daddy, doesn’t mean -”
“It sucks.”
“It’s part of my charm.”
Dean didn’t remember much more about the ride to the emergency room. All he remembered was Castiel telling him to stay awake and hissing for Gabriel to drive faster. He must’ve looked as bad as he felt, because from how Castiel was acting, one would think he was dying or something.
“My pies don’t fall apart, Sam!”
Dean looked up to see Luc had managed to sneak a bite out of the pie and was now in the progress of devouring the rest of it. “Hey!” Dean said sharply, reaching for the pie plate, “Leave some for me!”
“Why? What happened to it?” asked Luc with a raised eyebrow.
Dean runs over the calculations in his head. "You're sure five minutes?"
“I would like to be your friend too. I know it might be difficult, with me being Sam’s friend but I don’t need Sam’s permission for who I can or can't be friends with. The same goes for you, Sam is my best friend, so I’m not going to stop talking to him if we become friends and I won’t like it if you or your friends are rude to him around me. I know you two won’t suddenly like each other because of me, so all I ask is for you to keep me out of it.”
That was a lie and both Dean and Mary knew it. Even if John wasn’t teaching at Dean’s school, he was always popping up in their lives, no matter how hard they tried to avoid him.
“Dean. Thanks for looking after Ellen.”
Suddenly, Castiel cracked a smile and chuckled loudly as the exasperated look on Dean’s face. “Dean, I’m just kidding! I live in the same house as Gabriel. He lives for some of this stuff, though he seems to favor the villain most of the time, so I know more about them then the “good” guy. I know what you’re talking about, don’t worry.”
Finally catching on that Dean was just joking, Castiel put on the saddest look he could muster and said “I like it, so I guess you’re just going to have to walk if we are ever going somewhere,” before handing over the keys.
The reaction Dean saw on the doctor’s face at this revelation was extremely interesting; Castiel’s eyes widened, and that was definitely a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. Dean could only think of one reason for the other man reacting that way, and didn't that just make him feel warm all over?
right there in the bathroom, naked and sharing a single towel, was the happiest Dean could remember feeling in a long time.
Dean sighed, waving his arm forward as the elevator dinged and opened to the bottom floor. He was going to regret this…
Dean hadn’t realized that he had been holding his breath until he let it out and started laughing lightly. “Cas, I’m out, I’ve been OUT for years. Everybody that
At least Dean still had the rest of the gang… but that too felt wrong since one-fifth was missing. Castiel had tried his best to fill the gap, but it wasn’t the same. Dean knew he was putting his friends in a difficult position. He didn’t, and never would, tell them that they had to choose between him and Charlie, but that’s what happened in the end. It didn’t help that Charlie went and told their friends to ‘choose’ Dean instead of her, which made it even harder for Dean to hate her.
One thing was for sure though, if he ever wanted to look Bobby in the eyes again, all thoughts of John Winchester’s weird behavior had to wait because Gabriel was having way to much fun taking advantage of Dean’s drugged state by asking Dean what he loved most about Castiel.
“Oh, no,” Castiel shook his head quickly, explaining, “I technically work for Homeland Security. I’ve always been an advocate for Veterans and Military Personnel, so that lead me to my current position.”
“Just like that, Dean,” Cas moaned, his grip tightening as his palm slid over the head of Dean’s dick, jacking back down with the roll of Dean’s hips. “I love you, Dean. I love you so fucking much.”
, at least that is what my mom keeps telling me.” At Castiel’s confused looked, Dean quickly explained, “It’s my mom’s shop, we live above it.”
"No. No, I suppose you don't."
“Mr. Winchester--”
“No! Chocolate cake is my favorite. How did you know?”
"He's seventy-six, which made him a long shot anyway. But he's been diagnosed with cancer. His four grandchildren didn't take the news well.
Castiel swallowed thickly and squeezed Dean’s hands, nodding his head.
Crowley. Dean’s boss.
He watched Castiel swallow hard, his eyes darting between the box and Dean’s eyes. Dean smiled, using his thumb to open the box. “Marry me, Castiel.”
Yay, an update! I can't believe is has been a year since the last one.
Dean’s eyes moved from Castiel’s face to the condom between his fingers, the rubber discolored. He reached for it, swearing under his breath when it felt paper dry.
“Hi, Dean. How are you? I’ve hardly seen you since Saturday,” said Castiel with what Dean would have described as a disappointed look on his face.
Fergus' cheeks turned slightly pink and he shrugged, but Anna nudged him and stood to give them both a hug. "I know you're important to Castiel," she whispered into Dean's ear, "and that means you're important to us. Merry Christmas."
When they finished the lap, John was finishing telling the rest of the class that they would be playing basketball for the remaining time. Dean wasn’t surprised when John picked Lucifer and Alastair as team captains and told them to pick six people each for their teams.
“Fine, I will help you but if this all goes to hell, you can’t blame me.”
Dean sat on the other end of the couch and watched as Castiel blew gently on a spoonful before putting it in his mouth. Thoughts of the man’s lips on him creeped into his mind and he had to mentally scold himself.
“Because you were the only one that caught me in the act and I thought we agreed to never speak of it again!” answered Benny, who to Dean’s amazement was actually blushing.
After unlocking his front door and picking up the mountain of mail on the floor, Dean showed Clarie towards the cabinet in the living room where he kept all the board games Charlie had brought over. There was a lot more of them then Dean had remembered and it took Clarie a moment to take them all in before she started pulling them out, one after the other. As Clarie looked through the different games and sorted them in piles after reading the backs, Dean went back into the hall, near enough that he could keep an eye on her but far enough that he could have little privacy.
how much I like them, I figured I’d
“Well then.” Jo raises an eyebrow archly at him and Dean stares back, foggy-minded. He was so prepared to see Castiel and speak to him so finding himself in this situation has thrown him totally. He can feel a flush creeping up his neck, similar to the one staining the elderly man’s cheeks. “Doctor Winchester? Close the door, please. I don’t care which side of it you’re on, but I’m sure Mr Graham would like some privacy right now.”
the good doctor wear under all those clothes?”
A half hour later and he’s in the driving seat of Baby, the most beautiful car in the damn world, looking up at the address Balthazar has given him with a mixture of awe and creeping nerves. The house is a four-floor townhouse, well-kept with an immaculate front garden and the shittiest car in the world parked in the driveway. Castiel might have good taste in real estate but he needs teaching a thing or two about motors.
The first thing Dean did when he and Charlie, got to his house was get out of the wet clothes and for the second time today, he was half naked in front of Charlie. Not that Charlie cared, they had grown up seeing each other in their underwear and after they both came out, it never became a problem. Well, at least not for them. There had been times when Ash and Benny had gotten jealous when Dean wasn’t kicked out of the room like they were when the girls were changing clothes.
“Yeah, just one moment,” said Dean before turning around to grab his jacket and calling out to tell his mom that he was leaving. “Okay, I’m ready.”
Stay tuned for dcjuris chapter next time!!!
“We should do this more often.”
. Maybe it had something to do with him and Cas… After all, Charlie started acting weird after Dean started hanging out with Castiel. But then, why had Charlie been trying to get them together? None of this made any sense.
“Hey, I get it, trust me. It was hard to celebrate Christmas for years after Mom died and then again when Dad passed. But she’s lucky to have all of you,” said Dean as he propped himself up on elbow in order to see Castiel. “But can you at least tell me why it has to happen before eight?”
“Mom! I’m fine, really.” Dean knew his mom wasn’t buying that, so he decided to tell her a little of the truth in the hope she would let it go. “I just haven’t been having a good day, that’s all.”
As he waited for the light to turn green, Dean looked in his pockets for his wallet. “Here,” said Dean as he opened up his wallet and handed it over to Claire just as the light turned green.
“As for who is in this club, aside from me, we have Charlie and Jo, both their fathers passed away when they were younger. We are still debating on if that counts as ‘Daddy Issues’ or just absent fathers. Then we have Benny. He has a strange relationship with his
But… what was this ‘deal’ about? Was there something else that had kept John away, other than him just being a shitty person?
Dean chuckled and nodded his head, edging the Impala just
,” Cas leaned in to whisper against Dean’s ear, his arm warm where it pressed against Dean’s. Dean suppressed a shiver and smiled wider.
Dean cocked his eyebrow in surprise. “Really? I wouldn’t have thought he was your type.”
boyfriend that way.
to say the least. The Campbells were old fashioned, hated how Mary had chosen to live her life, and used every opportunity to remind her of that. They would start with ‘how she had ruined her life by getting pregnant out of wedlock’ before transitioning to nagging about how she ‘still hadn’t found a good husband’. They’d nitpick the shop, pointing out how she should brighten things up by getting rid of all the ‘books and useless stuff’, demanding floral arrangements and plants and classical paintings that would never fit in with the aesthetic. Though, to be fair, it was Mary’s aesthetic that they hated… When Mary would be about to blow about their constant input about the cafe, they would switch it up, encouraging her to sell instead. Then she could settle down and get married! They even had the perfect bachelor picked out - rich, kidless, and living directly across from them.
“Yeah, I killed him when he came by earlier. I even took a picture to prove it.” said Charlie as she dug up her phone to find the picture. When she found what she was looking for, she handed Dean the phone. On the phone were three photos of Benny in different positions. All with what looked like tomato sauce all over his face. In one of them, he was sitting hunched over in a booth and they had made it look like his head was on the dinner plate. In the next one, he was hunched over the back of the seat. He was lying on top of the table with Charlie holding his head up by the hair in the last one. “Then your mom told me to get rid of the body, because it was getting too messy and some customers had just walked in. But don’t worry, I’m sure Benny will haunt us for the rest of our lives.”
“Nope.”
talk or something?”
Dean had to admit that her cutting them made eating a lot easier. “Thanks, Mom,” he said in between bites.
much faster. As he turned onto his street, the anticipation in his stomach swirled up, making his hands start to sweat. He had a brief moment to wonder if he’d even made his damn bed before he left to pick Cas up before he was parked and Castiel was hauling himself across the seat and pressing his lips to Dean’s throat.
“Can you really blame me?” Dean asked softly, picking at a small hole in his jeans. “You know me, Charlie. You know how I feel about Sam. I just-- I saw you with him and I just… I snapped. I didn’t know how to deal with it.”
Charlie had never liked going to big parties like this one. She didn’t really like being surrounded by so many people, at least not as herself. She hadn’t been able to spot Dean or Castiel since she showed up, and it was how she found herself alone standing in Sam’s bedroom. It was a lot quieter in there, even though she could still hear the music playing in the other room. It was strange how comfortable she felt... Lately she’d spent her fair share of time in there working on their essay with Sam.
“I think I might know what’s wrong with it. It’s probably just the--”
Dean was pretty sure it physically hurt Sam to say that.
, Dean thought, as he wearily pulled himself up off the floor.
“Oh, right! I totally forgot. I have no idea what’s wrong with it. It keeps making some weird noise when I turn the wheels.”
As soon as the big screen flickered to life, Dean looked up from his drawing. “Now, Mr. Novak here might not have a social media account for himself, but that doesn't mean that he’s not all over them. Be careful about who you surround yourself with because they might plaster you all over the internet. So far, I have figured out that he is the youngest son of Chuck Novak, who is best known as the writer Chuck Shurley.”
“Everyone take a seat and take out your books!”
Three straight days of snow meant that they had to close both the garage and the lot. Castiel hadn’t seemed inclined to kick him out, so they upacked his television and watched Christmas movies on his couch by the light of the tree. This morning it had stopped, the air bright and crisp with a few lazy flakes drifting down from time to time. Dean had made pancakes, which they hadn’t eaten, and after cleaning maple syrup out of their hair and off the kitchen floor, Castiel decided it was time to face the boxes.
All he wanted was to crawl into bed and hopefully when he woke up, this would all be a bad dream.
"Wanna get out of here and go for a drive?"
The smile Cas gave in return was blinding and Dean was sure he had never seen a more beautiful sight in his life.
“Need any help?” asked Cas only for Sam to politely decline as he made his way towards the kitchen.
“Doctor Winchester? I heard a commotion, is there a problem on the ward?” Castiel frowned.
“Claire, it’s only a few minutes past seven. Let them sleep,” called Amelia from somewhere else in the house and the door closed again with a, “But Mom!"
"What. The hell. Was that?" Sam asked, terrified as he turned from Cas to meet his brother's expression.
date! It wasn’t that Dean was ashamed about the date or anything, he was just nervous enough about it without his friends making a big deal out of it.
“Just wait until you taste it.”
“So you’re telling me that he spends every morning with sick kids?” Well, that’s really helping this whole crush thing…
“A month? Great,” said Dean, sarcastically. “I hear Spain is great this time of year! And I think we’ve earned a relaxing trip somewhere, don’t you?”
“Your teachers tell me you weren't in class this morning. Care to tell me why?” When Sam didn’t offer an excuse right away, Principal Crowley added, “Sam, you are one of the smartest students we have in this school. It would be a shame to screw up all that hard work now. I get that you want to impress those morons you hang out with,” he ignored the disapproving look thrown at him from the officer, “but you
“Ugh, I guess I can do it if you can’t find anyone else,” said Charlie with a fake annoyance. “Now, tell me everything you’ve been up to lately. Starting with you coming out to your dad!”
Whoever said that Charlie was sweet and innocent, did
“When’s the last time you ate?”
“He got them both out on the pavement before the ambulance arrived. He must have dragged her out through the drivers side, I don’t know. He wouldn’t stop CPR until they physically dragged him away, and he… he just…”

crushing on? Dean isn’t stupid. He nods once at Balthazar, shoulders the satchel, and heads towards the staff changing rooms to stash his coat and scrubs and change into something that doesn't invite people to question him about their IBS or skin complaint the second he steps out of the hospital. He’s had way too many run-ins like that while stopping for groceries or gas.
Whatever argument Castiel had was cut short by a coughing fit and in his haste to turn away from Dean, Castiel knocked his coffee over with his elbow.
Almost at the same time as he sent his messages, Ash and Benny sent one too.
He wrote Dean’s name down in the margin of the paper on his table and made a note to do a little research on the doctor and maybe, Castiel yawned, he’ll invite Dean for a cup of coffee. ‘
“You are incapable of being wounded,” Castiel said when Balthazar had finished. Then, adding as if it was an afterthought “so… what did happen to Doctor Winchester? I, er… thought he was on rounds this morning.”
Dean stopped dead in his tracks, having been caught. “Damnit.” Sighing to himself, he turned and forced a smile, dragging his feet back to the nurse's station. “What's up, Jo?”
Charlie closed her eyes and took a deep breath, before replying.
“When we’d heard you’d had an accident…” Sam trails off, moving to sit gingerly on the edge of Ellen’s bed and taking her hand. “I was so worried.”
“Yeah, a little bit. But not for two days! Dean was going out of his mind with worry that he had lost you forever. I’m pretty sure he was about to ram himself back into the closet, just for you,” answered Charlie with an intensity that made Dean raise his eyebrows. He opened his mouth to calm the situation before Charlie really went off on Benny, they’d gotten past it and were in a good place now, no need to bring up the past. But Jo spoke first.
A movement on the bed next to him had him turning around to see Castiel in the progress of busting himself up to sit against the headboard.
Bobby was already hard at work when Dean walked through the door. “Hi, Bobby.”
Castiel looked at the bag and then back to Dean’s eyes. “That was very thoughtful of Zar. But you didn’t have to go out of your way-”
was wanted there. But a few months ago, Dean never could’ve imagined Sam inviting him anywhere. No matter what!
When the bus pulled to a stop at the bus stop closest to Bobby’s Salvage yard, it was still fifteen minutes before he was supposed to show up. He made his way there anyway since he had had a key to the place for years, even before he started working there. When he was younger and his mom had to work late, he had gone to Bobby’s after school. It had become almost like a second home for him. Of course, that was before his mom opened up her own coffee shop and he could hang out there if he wanted. As per usual, he stopped to get the mail for Bobby since Bobby didn’t see the point of walking all the way to get it when Dean was walking past it anyway. Dean sighed when he opened the mailbox and saw the stack of envelopes with red letters on them. For the last few weeks they had been a regular sight for him. He knew Bobby had been struggling lately and it only seemed to be getting worse and of course, it was all thanks to John Winchester. John had opened up his own workshop a few months earlier in the middle of the town and he could offer people deals that Bobby couldn’t afford to offer. The only reason Bobby was still in business was because he had his loyal customers, and the people that didn’t want to do business with John.

“Here you go, Castiel. It was very nice meeting you,” said Mary as she gave Castiel the box.
we were going to spend Christmas morning digging a grave after Jimmy murdered him."
Bright, blue eyes met Dean’s through the branches, the man’s cheeks tinged pink from embarrassment or the cold. He wore a long tan trench coat over a button up shirt, his blue tie stuck on the branch pressing against his chest. Dean was momentarily struck dumb.
Dean looks at Sam. “...What?”
“I’m sure you were, Mr. Pizzaman,” answered Mr. Devereaux in a sarcastic way, which had the most of the class laughing.
“Good, because I’m
“Alright… yeah. Yeah, I’m seeing Cas.”
“I miss him too,” Claire whispered, hiding her face in Cas’ arm.
Dean glanced over at him again, suddenly hit with the thought of Castiel in his home; the attractive man lounging on the couch with him, a beer in hand and a movie playing, of Cas soapy and wet in his shower, then warm and crawling into his bed…
“Okay, and because of the wedding dress, I’m guessing that is his wife.”
still recovering. And there was the little thing about being his boss that continued to nag at the back of his mind that made Dean feel like he would be overstepping his bounds.
It was hard, but Dean finally got his eyelids to comply.
“It can wait!” said Dean.
Dean's alarm went off at 7 the next day and it took all of his will power not to throw that goddamn thing at the wall. To say that Dean was not a morning person would be an understatement. Twenty minutes later, Dean was no closer to getting out of bed, but he got up when he heard “Dean Winchester, your breakfast is ready, so get your ass out of bed or you’re going to be late to work!”
With each word John seemed to get more and more angry. “What are you doing here Robert? Aside from sticking your nose in things that have nothing to do with you.”
“Blackmail.” Castiel snorted, pushing the plate with the remainder of the pie in front of Dean. He grinned as Dean’s eyes lit up as he dug in with gusto. “Can’t believe you are using my curious nature against me.”
Dean could very well see how Frank came to that conclusion. In the picture Castiel was dressed in what was most likely supposed to be a pizza delivery outfit, and had some brunette in a sluty school uniform
"I said you could bring your brother, not..." said Charlie before quickly making sure Dean was still on the other side of the room. "...him!" she said in a low enough voice that Dean wouldn't hear her as she gestured towards Sam.
