He was about to step in, because he was the water on every fire, shut up Clint, he wasn’t the gas, when Thor grabbed Loki’s arm, tugging him away from Bucky and imminent danger. “Brother, you are most welcome here in our home on Midgard, but I caution you. My fellow warriors do not take kindly to the sort of pleasures we enjoy on Asgard.”
“Yggdrasil wanted her children to experience the universe,” Tony explained. “She sent Wind with me, and Strange took the crow twins.”
Wanda just watched him. “Your dreams for everyone else are enormous, Tony Stark. Why are they not even bigger for yourself?” She turned to leave, pausing once to look back. “Vision says that you are worthy of the greatest love. He says that only the greatest lovers would be worthy of you. Don’t disappoint him.”
Suddenly, the gate alarm went off. They both raced to the screen, where the camera facing the street lit up. A guy was waving madly at the screen.
“You just wait there, Cappucino,” Tony ordered Steve. “Be right back.” He lifted Bucky easily, flying over the chasm, over Crowley and landing on the other side.
Bucky stared at Steve. “What?” He looked a little sick. “Steve. What part of ‘I’m not ready for this’ didn’t you get back in Malibu?” he asked.
“I’ve told you to call me Tony.” He’d almost given up on getting Derek to use his first name. “Buttercup…”
Skurge stopped suddenly, and Tony barreled into him. It was only mildly humiliating to note that his weight barely made Skurge sway.
Thor nodded. “I do. And I am proud to stand at his side, to call him friend.” Thor touched Loki’s cheek. “Let us help you, brother,” he pleaded. “Perhaps we can still save your child.”
“I’m on my way.” Tony scrubbed at his hands, trying to get rid of the oil that seemed to cling to his skin.
Tony panted, his mouth watering when he saw Steve’s cock, full and thrusting hard against the fabric of his boxers. “Please,” he begged.
Steve appreciated the moment of levity. It gave him a chance to take a breath. To gather his thoughts. To wonder what Clint might possibly mean. To wonder why the hell it should even matter.
I apologize profusely. My muse has been hammering me to write a post CA:CW fic which has reached about 2k already. I'm not sure if I should start posting that one until I finish with this. Ugh. I hate adulting.
“The Soul Stone,” Thor said. “That one has yet to surface, but my fear is that the enemy already has possession of it and means to collect the others and wield the Infinity Gauntlet to destroy us all.”
Tony grinned. “I will take that in the spirit in which it's intended, most Glorious Widow.” He bowed. “I bring you your errant beau.”
Strange’s mouth quirked in small smile. “He bequeathed the Eye to me when I gained the ascendance to Sorcerer Supreme. It is in my care until the next comes along.” He held out a hand. “Come with me now. It is time.”
“Tony, you fuck, get your ass moving.” Rhodey was whispering so softly that Tony could barely hear him. “It’s a Code Crimson!”
“How come you get the ass-end of the adventure?” Bucky asked Dean, turning his neck a little to stare at Dean.
Thor’s flinch was minute enough that if Steve hadn’t been staring at him, he’d have missed it. “I’m not sure what you mean, Lady Pepper.” He appeared shifty enough, that even with Matilda in his arms, Steve automatically stepped towards the door. Not that it would do any good against Thor. The guy was
“The desire to protect you all was the reason Mr. Stark created Ultron,” Vision said, frowning a little. “Why else would he risk so much?”
Tony knew that because of the expression on Natasha’s face. She was impressed. Well, her nostrils had flared a little, and her thumb had twitched. As good as it gets.
Steve sighed. “We really aren’t.” He looked at Tony. “What are we going to do once we get into space?” Plans that worked weren’t usually Tony’s forte.
They were a quiet group as they trooped up the steps to the farmhouse. Tony wasn’t even surprised when the front door opened and Coulson waited for them.
“Too many to be allowed back into his life,” Pepper said. She pointed at the door. “You can leave now.”
Steve shook his head. “No, that’s not true.” But even as he protested, something about her words resonated inside him. “It isn’t.” It sounded weak, even to him.
“What the fuck?” It was so unusual to hear Bruce swear that there was instant silence in the infirmary.
Bruce nodded. “That’s a very valid question.” He looked over at Tony. “Perhaps Dr. Stark can answer that for you.” It was a very deliberate use of Tony’s title. One that the public seldom got to hear.
Tony and Bruce were arguing loudly about how many dimensions needed to be added to the equation, when Steve rushed into the lab.
“I wish I’d told Steve how much I loved him before I lost him.” Tony tossed onto his back, kicking out at invisible restraints. “I wish I could get that one chance.”
Thor glanced over at Loki, nodding once. The lightning came to his fingers in strands of power. “Can you pull the stone from our friend’s form with your power?”
He ignored Rhodey and Pepper’s increasingly hysterical demands to be let in. Only Bruce was granted access and that was only on pain of death.
Sam took a deep breath. “I hope you’ll forgive me, Cap, but the last time I saw this guy he was busy trying to destroy peace on earth. You’ll have to give me a little time to adjust.”
“Of course,” Natasha inclined her head in that slow, stately way that made a person feel as though they’d been blessed by a queen.
“You’re an asshole.” Tony’s mouth was thin with anger. “You think you’re so special, so powerful. Well, I’ve got friends who would die for me. What have you got?”
“Wait!” Tony held up a hand. “That wasn’t an offer.” The crestfallen expression didn’t fool him. “Don’t even try it, you little schemer.”
“I’m the luckiest son of a bitch in the entire universe, but if I don’t get my ass in gear, there will be no universe.” Neither of them replied. Assholes.
“You sure you want to do this, man?” Rhodey waved a hand in the air. “This place has been your sanctuary since all that shit went down.”
Bruce’s hand fell on his shoulder. “Steve. Stop.” Steve turned to look at Bruce. Bruce, whose eyes were red and mouth was trembling. “It’s too late.”
“My mom used to hold me at night sometimes,” Steve said, meeting Bucky’s gaze. “When I was ready to stop fighting, ready to give up.”
He hugged Rhodey with a laugh. Sam rolled his eyes, but shook his hand anyway. Wanda waved from her lounger and Vision nodded from his position behind her. Clint bounded up to him, throwing his arms out. “Let’s do this!”
Tony turned his head, met Steve’s eyes. “Oh, I’m serious.” He let Steve see just how much he meant it. “ You’re not leaving me behind on this one. I’ll figure out a way to follow you.”
“Oh really?” Sam leaned forward, keenly interested. “So not always the Boy Scout he pretends to be, huh?” He smirked at Steve’s frown.
“I have loved two people in my entire life,” Steve said, staring down at his hands. “Peggy Carter was the girl of my dreams and if things had been different then maybe we would have grown old together. But I landed in the ocean and woke up seventy years later in a world I struggled to keep up with.”
He almost hacked out a lung while Steve smacked him on his back. It was starting to be a pattern. “Are you okay?” Steve asked, his blue eyes far too close to Tony’s face.
“I can help,” Tony insisted, desperate to see the changes Extremis had made. “I’m the king of living souls!” He threw his arms out wide and twirled. “I need a crown!”
“Anyone feel like filling me in on what or how we plan to get this done?” He reckoned he was probably talking to the air. Strange hadn’t been forthcoming at all and he doubted that either Skurge or Jörmungandr were scintillating conversationalists.
Loki looked like he wanted to protest, but settled when Thor held up a hand. “Please, my friends, remember that Loki has been exposed to the Other, the leader of the Chitauri. His mind has been manipulated much as yours have been.”
Tony’s eyes were on Steve the whole time, bright and desperate. His mouth dropped open as Bucky’s thrusts lifted him into the air. He reached out to grab Steve’s hand. The other hand went up and back around Bucky’s nape, pulling Bucky’s face into his neck.
“You do that,” Tony said. “Good luck getting him to make sense.” He made a face. “I think he tries too hard to sound sage and mysterious.”
Probably Steve with his sad Captain face and his disappointed eyes, Tony thought spitefully. “No. One.”
Tony opened his mouth and then snapped it closed. Steve ducked his head to hide his smile. Bucky had always been a devious little shit.
Steve watched Clint’s face. He could hear that Laura was yelling at him, but tried not to focus on the exact words. It was very difficult with the combination of her voice and his exceptional hearing.
“That’s just what I was saying,” Steve said, hands on his hips. “What do you have to say for yourself, Tony?”
Steve hurried to catch up to him. “Is Ms. Potts not coming with us?” He was so very tired of everything now. He wanted a bed and a shower and, most of all, a conversation with Tony that he feared would never actually happen.
Tony flashed him a quick grin. “Yet another reason to keep you,” he said. Bucky’s responding smile was a thing of beauty. It made Tony blink.
“I believe it is my brother’s scepter,” Thor rumbled. “It too needs to be found and returned to Asgard.”
“Butterblossom, tell me what horrors I managed to conduct last night or I will tell Pep about the time with the grizzly bear and the honey.”
Steve groaned. “God, can’t he just be normal for a while?” Natasha’s little smirk was enough of a reply. “What’s he done now?” The Avengers Tower was home. Had been for a while now. Steve loved the discoveries he made almost every day.
Tony looked over at Steve who shrugged. “Not as if any of us have any idea which is the easiest option,” he said.
Bucky grinned, following him down. He knelt over Tony, bracketed him with his arms. “Genius at sleep had better happen in the next few minutes.” He leaned in, pressed a kiss against Tony’s mouth.
“Stop that, it’s creepy,” Laura ordered as she shoved a bunch of papers in front of him. “Sign. Stark Industries is still in business even though the world is ending.”
“We try because no matter what else, we haven't lost hope yet.” Natasha stared out at the blue skies, lost for a moment in memories she still refused to share.
Bucky took the seat next to Tony that Thor had left. “What does that mean for us?” he asked. “Earth?”
“Iron Man, if you please,” Tony corrected as he plonked down on the sofa nearest Steve. “Now, how is this stone exchange supposed to happen?”
Bruce was also looking at the SHIELD upload. “This is bad, Tony. Everything that SHIELD has done for the past fifty or more years has been compromised. Everything they’ve accomplished will have to go under scrutiny.”
“Tony?” Coulson had a little frown between his eyes that meant he’d been talking while Tony had spaced out. “Did you hear what I said?”
They both nodded. The kitchen emptied then, Bruce following them, leaving Tony alone with Pepper and Rhodey.
“Don’t do anything stupid, okay?” he told her. “Don’t mess with the water or the power. Don’t try to hijack their electronics.” He rubbed his eyes, they felt scratchy and sore. “No sabotage, am I clear?”
The owner of the spectacular ass turned around. “Hey Pepper.” He smiled at her and the sun rose. “Ready for the practical?”
Natasha followed Bruce and the gurney with the hissing, spitting creature firmly in hand. Clint and Thor were on her heels, looking once over at Steve who nodded at them to go.
“Thor’s pissed at us because we don’t all love his brother.” As usual, Bucky cut to the heart of a thing.
“Sometimes he goes too far,” Steve said, fists clenching in the pockets of his jacket. “He should have trusted me, trusted us.”
Happy rolled his eyes, but obeyed, setting course for the small brownstone in Queens that Nick Fury had ‘retired’ to.
“And just where does Steve fit into this entire scenario?” Ah, Bruce Banner, Mr. Cut-to-the-heart-of-it.
“When were you going to tell us that XZ134P was your home-world?” Bruce stared at Thor. “We would never have sent you back there if we’d known.”
The owl guy blinked. “Huh.” He turned away, heading back to some sort of odd machine. “I may have made a minor miscalculation,” he muttered.
Tony squared his shoulders. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. can you hack into the communication systems inside the Situation Room?”
“I swear, I’m okay, Cap,” Tony said, this time, less annoyed, more careful. “Come here.” He held out a hand and Steve immediately pushed away from the wall, grabbing hold.
Clint looked ready to argue but a sharp glance from Natasha had him heading over to Thor. “You hold the front legs and I’ll hold the back,” he suggested. Matilda was not impressed, yowling as they tried to wrestle her down to the table.
Clint cleared his throat. “So, she was busy with Steve, and he obviously wasn't getting what she was trying to tell him so she started with Morse code.”
“I haven’t been crying into my milk waiting for you lot to realize my value,” Coulson said, only mildly defensively. “I have a day job.”
Tony did a little jig. Bruce and Bucky looked unimpressed. “Please, you know these moves are smooth,” Tony said.
“Stop smiling like that, it’s creepy,” Rhodey told him. Tony narrowed his gaze, wondering if somehow the S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to infiltrate his armor. “I can hear your smarmy smile,” Rhodey clarified.
Natasha slipped into the room like a wraith. Her face was pale and she studiously avoided looking at anyone other than Tony. “Are you alright?” Her normally husky voice was raspier than normal.
“Tony!” The last time Steve had heard Bucky sound like that had been a snowy night on railway more than seventy years ago. They each knelt on either side of Tony, Steve the first to carefully turn him onto his back.
He ignored the rest of the people standing in the room watching them, and turned to Tony. “I think you should get some sleep,” Steve told him, nodding at Bucky. “It's been a hell of a day so far, and nothing about tomorrow says it’s going to be any easier.”
He saw Tony’s eyes widen as his AI passed on the message. A flailing hand had the doors sliding open a moment later.
“Very well, sir,” she said into his ear. She sounded like she meant entirely the opposite. He was definitely reprograming her.
Natasha shrugged. “I signed the first draft of the Accords. I expect that Tony has put extra protection in for us in the revision. I’ll sign that as well.”
Tony rubbed the sleep from his eyes. “Why didn’t you wake me earlier?” he asked Steve, noting that a pool of drool adorned Steve’ shoulder. He wiped it off with a grimace. “That must have been attractive.
“He was here a moment ago,” Clint said. “When you kissed your 'good friend' over there.” He looked over at Bucky who frowned.
“Thanks,” he slurred into his pillow, brain beginning to shut down. “I just wish I could see Steve one more time and make it all right, tell him how I feel.”
Things were just getting a little more interesting, with Bucky’s warm hand on his cock and Tony’s fingers in his hair when the sound of a throat clearing broke them apart.
“Then let us depart this realm and pray that the Collector is near to the Rainbow Bridge and Heimdall.” Thor swung Mjolnir in several quick circles.
Bucky leaned against Steve. “You do realize that we’re in the superhero business?” He tipped his head to the side, a small smile playing across his mouth. “Danger comes with the territory.”
“One of the nanites must have been in your brain,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. replied. “In an area that supports consciousness.”
It felt true for the first time as he saw Tony throw himself in front of Rhodey and catch a pancake missile lobbed by Natasha.
Tony pulled him closer, nipped at his lips until Bucky opened his mouth to his kiss. “If you hadn’t been saved to become the scary mother-fucker you became, then I wouldn’t have met you.” He met Bucky’s eyes calmly. “I don’t care about the faceless hundreds you’ve killed. I’m just grateful to have you in my life now.”
They all watched as the cops loaded Stane into a black and white and let out a breath as he was taken away.
“He would have thought I was choosing Bucky over hi…, the team.”  Steve stumbled a little but he doubted that Bruce missed it.
“I’m not five years old,” Tony protested when Steve slung an arm across his shoulders. It didn’t stop his own traitorous arm sneaking around Steve’s waist though.
None of it could be real. He opened his eyes and looked into a gorgeous redhead’s eyes. “Welcome back, Tony. You gave us quite a scare.”
“It’s your decision, Tony. I don’t know what it will mean for you, or us, or the rest of humanity, but Odin wouldn’t have sent it to you without having a pretty good idea of the kind of guy you really are.”
“She's fine,” Tony assured him. “She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.” He wasn’t going to let Steve get to him on this. He’d done the right thing, dammit.
“Oh god.” Clint’s breath was choppy. Tony could recognize the signs of a panic attack about two hundred miles away.
“You’re not involved with Barnes?” Tony asked, his brain still stuck on the thought because Steve had just walked away from everything for the guy.
“Any signs of life?” he asked. He didn't have to ask. He could see very clearly what was out there. He was just used to hearing voices. Two weeks with Bucky in the mansion had made him accustomed to people again. Even half-crazy super-soldiers were better than being alone.
“Follow me, please sir.” Lee spun on his heel and headed down a long corridor. They all followed him.
“When I was a kid, before you and I got to be friends,” Steve swallowed hard. “I didn’t have anyone who gave a damn about me except for my mom.” He remembered feeling weak and so very afraid. “So one day, after I’d been whaled on, Mom was fixing me up. Patching the worst of what the bigger kids had done.”
“What our large friend is saying is that nobody comes this way.” Strange strolled past Tony, taking a position at Skurge’s shoulder. Only then did Tony realize that they were on solid ground again. He looked back up. The light was a sliver far above them in the blackness of the abyss.
Loki sighed. “My brother, the perfect Captain, the green monster, all of you.” His lip lifted in a sneer. “Earth's mightiest heroes, I believe they call you.”
Bucky nudged him with his shoulder. “We’re all learning how this works, right?” He smiled a little. “It took me a long time to convince Steve that I wasn’t planning on running again.”
Then the pain hit. He looked down at the blood oozing from the bullet wound. “Fuck.” He staggered to his feet and started walking.
“Hurry!” Rhodey sounded panicked. “I think I may actually be at Alpha Tau Omega and if they find me I’m a dead man.”
“I feel like a horse’s ass.” Steve put a hand over his eyes, pulling his knees up to his chest. “I read this wrong from the start.”
“Fuck,” Clint breathed. “That is so far beyond fucked up it’s not even in the same universe of fucked up.”
Thor ran a hand through his hair. “I can only appeal to his sense of justice,” he said. “The one thing that Loki hates, is owing someone a debt. If we are able to restore him then he will owe us in return.”
“Then what was it?” Rhodey demanded. He was flying on his own steam, but the comms kept him in contact with the team.
“Odin has told me that I can examine it there and see if we can decipher its secrets,” Jane said. She looked excited.
Thor's hammer left a hole in the window of Pepper's office that she wouldn't quickly forgive him for.
Natasha took his hand carefully in hers. “Thank you.” Then she twisted his thumb back so hard that he screamed like a girl. “Dumbass.”
Jim’s mouth quirked. “You planning on letting me have that arm anytime soon? Or do you want to carry on using it as a baton?”
“Huh,” Rhodes said. “But I get the super strength and healing too, right?” he asked Loki with a hopeful expression.
“He was fucking unconscious!” Natasha spat, fists clenched. Steve wondered if she was trying to figure out how to kill someone who carried an Infinity Stone.
F.R.I.D.A.Y. seemed stumped at that one. She remained silent. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. please make a note to remind me to remember to upload current pop culture references to your database.”
“I don’t think that word means what you think it means.” Tony snuggled in. “Now, tell me just how humiliated I should be feeling right now.”
“My mother…” It hurt, Tony thought. It wasn’t supposed to hurt that his parents were dead. Not anymore.
“Not your call to make, Steve,” Clint said. “Besides, Laura and I are on the same page on this. We will deal with the big bad dude and then figure our shit out after.”
Suddenly it was imperative that Steve talk to Tony, tell him that he needed him. As Iron Man, as Tony, as a friend.
Tony looked at the crown. “Demon?” he squeaked. “We have absolutely zero knowledge of how to deal with a demon.”
He sagged to the floor, black spots dancing in front of his eyes as he gasped for air. He wondered idly if this had been Wanda’s plan all along. Infiltrate the Avengers and destroy him from the inside. Brilliant. Terrifying and brilliant.
“So Dad’s like a prisoner?” Cooper asked, still watching his father with that careful, distrustful gaze.
Tony scowled at him, tugging his shirt down. “Yeah, yeah,” he muttered. But he was sort of thrilled to see Thor. There was something special about the big guy. And sure, he was a god alien from Planet Bonkers, but he was also a really cool cat. God, when had he picked up Steve's stupid old-fashioned phrases?
Rhodey opened his mouth to say something, but Tony shook his head, mouthing, “Baby steps.” Rhodey settled back with his eyes fixed on Steve’s face. Yeah, there was still a lot of shit they needed to sort out.
Tony could feel it. The moment that his heart began to beat again. “Thank you,” he sighed, the pain easing with every breath.
“Huh.” Tony hadn’t really thought about it. He remembered a vague conversation in about a year or so that should have been a big old red flag to him.
Tony nodded. “I think that the Nine Realms might be part of the outer universe and whatever makes up our universe is actually the interior of a black hole.”
“What about their privacy?” Tony asked. “Some of them have families.” He met Ross’ gaze. “Some even have children.”
“Like the ones you gave us?” Tony asked, still feeling the bile at the back of his throat at seeing his friends, seeing Steve at his feet, dead.
be trauma to the brain tissue. Give your friend a chance to heal.” He stood. “His vitals appear good, so I’m pretty optimistic that he’ll make a quick and full recovery.”
Steve had started counting those smiles. He hadn't realized how precious they were until they didn't show up on a face that was meant to always be smiling.
Steve shuddered. “Stop that.” He needed to work on the command in his voice, he thought, body going tight and hot.
Tony gave him the middle finger and kissed him wetly on the cheek. “I will get my revenge,” he promised, smacking Rhodey on the butt. “The exoskeleton really shapes the globes of your ass beautifully.”
“You’re refreshingly different,” Crowley said, moving faster now. He stepped onto the platform just as Tony landed with Steve. “I’ve clearly missed several news items from up there.” He stared at them, one finger tapping against his mouth. “I think perhaps you might just be able to do this.”
“Oh fuck you very much.” Tony glared at him. The gleam in Vision’s eyes had him pause. “Oh lord. He’s discovered his funny bone.”
They fucked, slow, lazy and Tony wanted it never to end. It had to, though. There were things that needed to be done. A job to be completed.
Tony could practically see the thunderclouds rolling across Thor’s face as he asked, “Then who pray tell do you suggest be the one to venture forth?” Thor sounded ominous. An ominous Thor was never a good thing.
“Do you believe that weapons should be given out indiscriminately, with no controls in place?” T’Challa’s dark eyes were fixed on Steve’s face.
He squirmed. Just a little. “Well, I’m a guy who likes comfort, plus I like my friends to be comfortable.” He waved a magnanimous hand. “Mi casa es su casa.”
Steve wondered how the Norwegian nation was going to handle the sudden influx of god-like expatriates. “That’s great news,” he said instead. “Your father?”
Loki turned to meet her gaze. Whatever he saw there made him hunch away from her. “The Collector has requested that I hand myself over to him for a period of servitude once the universes have been restored.” The words came out of him as though forced.
“I didn't say we should leave.” Natasha said, her voice soft with something that made Tony’s throat close. “There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?”
It had been a lonely life for Bruce Banner since he'd been bombarded with gamma radiation and become a one-man green wrecking machine. The formation of the Avengers had offered him a touch of normalcy, and then it had been taken away from him again. Tony intended that this time, Bruce wouldn’t leave.
Steve made to get up. “Stay right there,” Tony told him. “There’s nothing you can do until I’m done with my shit. Get some sleep while you can.”
“I was born ready,” Pepper told him. “I’d like you to meet a friend of mine.” She bared her teeth at Tony, shark-like and evil. “Tony, this is Steve. I know how much you wanted to …mffff.” The rest of her statement was muffled behind Tony’s palm.
The sounds that Tony made were pornographic. He watched Tony close his eyes, humming around the length of Steve’s cock. The vibration almost made Steve come right there. Only Tony’s strong fingers wrapping around the base of his cock and squeezing stopped him.
Tony smiled a little. “Remember my demonstration with Dr. Banner and his session with B.A.R.F.?” There were nods in reply. “I’ve made some adjustments to the program and I believe that it will break the repression of the real James Barnes.”
Steve’s smile widened as Tony muttered under his breath about sassy super soldiers. He asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to place their order, including the promise of a bonus if they put a rush on it.
Tony frowned and pulled it out of his cupboard. It was kind of plain, nothing but a giant red star on it. “I don’t remember buying this,’ he muttered.
“Honestly, relieving the tedium with a little torture works for me too,” Crowley declared with an airy wave. He met Bucky’s furious gaze. “But you know all about torture, don’t you, James?”
Tony rubbed at his eyes. “I asked the World Security Council to go through my suggestions first. Before I came before you. I requested them to go through my suggestions, to schedule this meeting because you’d never listen if I was the one asking.”
“And he won’t be able to!” Steve exclaimed. He threw his arms around Natasha. “Have I told you lately how fabulous you are?”
Tony let the faceplate slide back and exchanged a glance with Steve. “I’ve got a bad feeling about this,” he said. The armor slipped back into place, locking into the bracelets with a quiet snick.
“You really shouldn’t give Dean an opening like that,” Sam advised Tony with a little smile. “He’s not one to let that sort of thing slide.”
He sent a 'please help me' glance to Sam, who shrugged, holding his hands up. “Don't even try to pretend that your world doesn't revolve around him.” He sobered. “And I'm
Steve spent many nights cursing Howard Stark. He would erase all doubts from Tony’s mind of his lack of worthiness if it took him millennia. “Of course, he means you, love. You are the most human, most fragile of us all, and yet you persist in standing up and fighting for what is right.  You are the truest hero of the Avengers.”
Thor nodded. “Perhaps Loki and I should return to the Rainbow Bridge and await the collector at Heimdall’s side.”
They all kept their eyes away from the windows, pretending that Clint wasn’t outside somewhere, falling apart.
“No.” Again, simple and sure. “It isn’t.” That beautiful metal arm came up and rested on Clint’s shoulder. “We all need a nest. This one is yours.”
Tony waved a hand. “Semantics. I can prove most of it. The chair is a big piece of the evidence.” He saw Barnes recoil at the mention of the chair. “Don’t worry. It’ll be melted down as soon as I’ve got you a pardon.”
Her lips curved. “Can’t a girl come see her guy in his natural environment?” Tony didn’t know whether the purr of her voice excited him or petrified him. Either way, he did not have an actual death wish. The Science Bro Code was sacrosanct.
“What if Thanos gets the Time Stone from the cocksucker and then changes the game again?” Tony demanded. “Isn’t it better to destroy
“Don’t ever say that again,” Tony begged, following him, glancing over at Vision several times. “This is so weird,” he said.
“We’d create a circle capable of holding Set and then summon him using the sigil.” Sam got animated, hands moving as he tried to describe the spell.
Bucky blinked, startled. “From what Steve and Tony have told me you don’t have control over what happens when the Other Guy takes over. Nobody can blame you.”
“Yes, you did.” Steve crossed his arms and Tony gave a mental groan. It was those goddam arms. Thick tree-trunks of muscles that made his mouth water. Tony wanted to climb him like a tree. He could totally be Steve’s monke…
Bruce hurried over to them, muttering under his breath about stupid, stubborn, wannabe superheroes who didn’t do as they were told. Steve wasn’t far behind him.
“I couldn’t, Buck.” Steve took a step towards Bucky, noticed Tony inching away. “Once I knew it was you.”
Tony flapped a hand, sucking at air desperately. “Fine,” he gasped. “I’m fine!” He straightened with a grimace. “I think you people are trying to kill me today.”
He saw the way Steve looked at Bucky. And the way Bucky looked at him. Bucky was still too fragile, too broken to know what he really wanted and Tony was going to have to tread very carefully if he wanted to keep things under control.
Tony nodded once. “See, Ross figured if you wouldn’t be under his thumb, then you shouldn’t be allowed to live.”
Before he could think a little more on it, the doors opened. A tall woman waved them forward. “Mr. Stark, Colonel Rhodes, Mr. Banner, we’re ready for you.”
Steve was moving before she’d finished. His heart abruptly seemed to stop working. Bucky and Thor were at his heels.
Crowley’s snort was derisive. “Why don’t you ask the Winchesters what they think about God?” he replied instead, sauntering through the mass of bodies with little care.
blamed you, Buck. If I did, I’d have left you to freeze to death in that god-forsaken jail in Siberia.”
Thor nodded. “Mjolnir allows me to harness the power of the storm,” he admitted. Matilda/Loki gave a yowl. “My brother had a staff, it was how he was able to take on the form of others.”
They stood outside of S.H.I.E.L.D. as Thor, Jane, Wanda and Vision disappeared into the golden light of the Bifröst. They were taking the shortest route to the tower to collect the Serpent Crown before heading to Asgard.
Bucky’s mouth was tight. “You need to think before you say shit, Steve.” He stepped close, tilting Steve’s chin up. “I didn’t break the skin.”
“Who?” Tony demanded. He deployed several of the Iron Legion to head for Washington. They would scan the river until Steve was found.
“Bound to happen eventually,” Wilson said. “I mean, he’s dealing with you and Barnes on a daily basis.”
Steve took his seat again. “We’ve made a start,” he hedged. “It’s going to take time and, more importantly, action to get us to trust one another again.”
The doors swished open on Tony’s floor and Steve stepped out, searching for Tony. He found him almost immediately, leaning against the huge windows overlooking the city.
Tony grinned. He was right. Bruce was totally his favorite. “Don’t you need me for….” He waved a hand at the screen. “Science-y stuff?”
“But I’ll feel better,” Bucky said with a grin. Tony gave a puff of laughter as he dismantled the suit, folding it down into its suitcase size.
“You believe that this is why Tony, Natasha, James, Bruce and the others care for you?” Vision asked. “Why Agent Barton, Airman Wilson and Ms. Maximoff followed your lead? Because of the way you look?”
“I’ve been a part of Vision since the beginning,” J.A.R.V.I.S. replied. “A symbiote if you will. Together with the Mind Stone, Vision learned from me about earth and many of you.”
“As do you,” Pepper said. She ignored the scowl Steve sent her way. “Now, report please, Captain Rogers.”
It was much later that Tony finally got a moment to himself. He left Steve, Bucky and the others in the living room, escaping to the shower.
Tony scowled. “Get out of my lab, you traitors.” The pointed finger and foot stomp weren’t exactly mature but he was being attacked dammit. “Just because I haven’t asked Steve out already, doesn’t mean I don’t have the fucking guts to do it!”
“That’s because it isn’t true,” Natasha insisted, following him up with her usual grace. She made the climb look like a cakewalk. Steve knew that it wasn’t.
Thor screamed, “No!” as Thanos snapped his fingers, Stormbreaker embedded deep within the Titan’s chest. “What did you do?
Tony was very on board with this plan. If they killed or captured Rumlow now, then he wouldn’t be around to pull the trigger and assassinate Steve. His breath quickened just thinking about it.
“It’s a constant trial,” Tony agreed, holding Bucky’s hand as they followed Steve into Tony’s suites.
When Tony opened his eyes again, it was morning. He yawned, feeling surprisingly refreshed. He turned his head to look at his phone. It was already ten in the morning. He’d slept for over twelve hours!
Sam leaned against the Quinjet with Wanda. “Earth’s Mightiest Heroes,” he said, presenting them to the world, as Tony and Bruce leaned against each other, gasping with laughter.
“He wouldn’t want you to make a senseless sacrifice.” Steve met her gaze. “We need to wait and see what happens with Tony’s amendments. If they are accepted, then it may mean that we have a chance to go back home to our families.”
Steve sighed, grateful that Bucky was talking to him, but not really wanting to discuss team dynamics. “It's different now.”
Tony felt something break a little as he looked into Bucky's eyes. The cocky attitude was there, but behind it, not quite masked, was fear.
He waited for the applause. It never came. “Tough crowd,” Sam commiserated. Tony offered him a fist-bump. He'd work on Falcon's wings next. Make them even better. War Machine was going to be so pissed off.
“Told him that Banner was going to keep Nat all to himself from now on if he didn’t,” Tony said. “I figured a little old-fashioned green-eyed monster taunting would do the trick.”
Bucky shook with a silent laugh. “He’s a pain in the ass when he’s awake.” But his arms were still tight around Tony.
Bucky pushed his hands away and started the classic knot Tony liked. “So, Barton wants Rumlow dead?” he asked, concentrating on Tony’s tie. He carefully kept his gaze lowered.
“You just call me when you’re done,” Happy assured him. “If I’m not out front when you come out, then wait, okay?”
“Then what is it you want?” T’Challa’s quiet question had Tony looking at him. “What do you want us to do?”
Tony stomped over to Loki and kicked him in the nuts. He was wearing the suit so he knew it hurt. He noted with satisfaction that Loki went white, and then red, and then doubled-over, crumpling to the floor with a choked-off moan.
“I did not need to,” Wanda replied, ever serene. Steve wondered how she managed to keep so calm amid the constant chaos. “His mind was open to mine from the moment I arrived.”
“Okay, everyone, time out.” It was Clint’s voice that broke into the charged atmosphere. He walked over to Loki with Natasha close at his heels. “You know I’m not your biggest fan,” he told Loki who shrugged carelessly. “But we need full intel. We can’t go blind into this.” His face was set in hard lines. “It’s not just
“You need to be more specific,” Tony said, swallowing hastily as his throat closed. “Are we talking tonight or in general?”
Coulson took it with a surprised thank you. “We’ll be working with them too,” he said. “This is bigger than us. Bigger than any one team.”
Bucky’s chuckle was a filthy sound. His hand moved unerringly to Steve’s dick, fingers wrapping around it surely. “What was that?” Bucky crooned as he licked Steve’s ear.
Steve turned slowly back to look at the hawk. “You’re in my mind,” he pointed out, pretty unnecessarily.
He stood opposite Tony and Bruce, his eyes narrow and promising swift retribution. “I suggest you never sleep again, Stark,” he mumbled.
“Bucky!” Steve fell to his knees, something breaking inside as he pushed his hands into ash. All around him, dust and ash flew into the air, a powdery rain of human cells torn apart as they stood.
They'd stopped at the new Avengers HQ, and picked Wanda up on the way to wherever the hell they were going. Vision had vanished and had been refusing all calls. It was suddenly much clearer to Steve as to why.
Strange tipped his head to one side. “But the connection that Asgard has to Earth has resulted in several near apocalyptic events,” he pointed out.
died at the Avengers’ hands in Sokovia.” Her eyes gleamed scarlet. “And you expected me to be your friend?”
Loki put a hand over his eyes. “If it continues at this pace then Asgard will be completely swallowed by the end of tomorrow.”
“So you said,” Steve kept his voice even. “And how do you plan on doing this?” He knew the answer even before Tony opened his mouth.
Tony propped his fists on his hips. “But I told you that I did!” He didn’t like the idea of his creation doubting him.
Steve pulled out carefully, turning Tony into his arms, back to front. The little spoon, Tony thought. Figured.
Matilda hissed at them from her cage as they all trooped in. They encircled the cage and then looked at Steve. “Now what?” Clint asked.
“Everyone agreed that you needed the rest, boss.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. sounded more subdued than her normally chipper self.
“You’re the only one who knows, Bruce.” Tony heard the urgency in his voice. “I need to know that you won’t let me fuck it up again.”
“There had better not be porn here, Cap. My virginal eyes couldn’t handle it.” Clint grinned at him.
“Yeah? Anything,” Steve offers, so easily it makes Tony’s body flush with tingles, from head to toe this time.
Tony nodded. "Valid. I need it to tape the batteries into the remote. The roomba ate the back cover and it won't click on anymore."
Every time the music went soft and slow, Steve tried to get his tongue to ask Tony to dance, but he couldn’t manage it. It would be good for the illusion - so far, they wouldn’t look to anyone else like more than touchy-feely friends - but Tony blushed and avoided his eye each time, and Steve didn’t have the strength to break through that.
Steve tried not to read to much into that, and he wasn’t given much opportunity to, because on the next breath, the repulsors burst to life and he shot out of the workshop. Tony politely didn’t mention Steve’s screech of surprise, or if he was laughing, his mic was turned off. The suit rocketed out of the hanger bay, and then Steve felt the moment that control was turned over to him. The joints relaxed, and gave, the repulsors firing just enough to keep him aloft, but without any real purpose.
The bad man immediately set off for the place he knew Tony would be: at the top of the tallest tower, in his penthouse apartment.
Tony chuckled. “Oh. That’s from when I was ten and I watched Mary Poppins and I tried to jump out of the third story window with an umbrella.”
“Yeah.” Tony’s muscles had started to relax and his teeth had stopped chattering. “You’re a fucking furnace, Rogers.”
"Almost?" Tony's voice was rough for some reason, but the man was suddenly so close that it didn't matter.
A tentacle hooked Tony's ankle, keeping him from slamming into the wall, and he took the chance to gape at his surroundings. He was in a large, circular room, completely smooth and seamless from the walls to the ceiling to the floor - all white with shiny, chrome-like accents - almost too shiny to be entirely believable. He kicked out again, feeling panic rise up in his chest, and the room spun again. It was almost as if… almost as if he wasn't on Earth anymore…
It was easier, with the whole group. He could convince himself that this was no different than if they’d gone as a group of friends. But when he stepped out of the bathroom in the extremely luxurious suit Tony had somehow acquired for him - perfectly fitted - Tony stood far too close and tucked a white flower in his buttonhole with a smile. It matched the one Tony was wearing.
He tugged the other earphone out too hard and winced, stuttering to a stop. His dog stopped too, gazing up at him adoringly. “Hi… Sir,” he said. And Steve gave up on there being any chance he hadn’t just been recognized. Teens these days only called him Sir if they’d played with his action figures as kids.
Tony rubbed the pad of his thumb over the back of Steve’s hand. He loved those hands. “You still want to be with me after I yelled and then spent three days breaking up with you?”
Tony wobbled a little against him, his shoulders twitching, and Steve peeled back and looked him in the face, frowning as he tried to see past the dark glasses. There was something more not-right about him than usual.
"I understand." He was being patronizing now. "There's a contact form on the website, where you can submit your comment and -"
Steve huffed self-deprecatingly. “No… that would have been better.” He dug a cardboard tube out of his pocket and handed it to Tony. “Sorry.”
“Just distracting you,” Tony replied, writhing a little in Steve’s lap and making Steve’s hands clench on Tony’s hips.
The rest of the team called back their acknowledgement but it was nothing more than a low buzz in the back of Steve’s mind. If Iron Man had been activated on its own that meant -
He tugged the case out and opened it again. What if Captain Rogers preferred yellow gold? Or didn’t like sapphires?
"I know." Tony smirked. He looked down at his phone and read, "Steve, twenty-eight, artist, loves dogs, hates bullies, works out, thinks he wears a size small and a half despite having pecs that could power a small nation."
He’d tried to make it work, hooking up with other people who had given up the search, or had lost their mates, but it wasn’t the same. He didn’t know what it would feel like when he found his mate, but he did know this wasn’t it.
“Right about what?” Steve couldn’t reign back the way the confusion twisted his expression. Jan always said it made him look like he was about to kill someone, but honestly, with Greg? It wasn’t that far off.
But Steve was built for fighting, created for fighting, he didn’t know any other way to be. He was a soldier though and through, and Tony had basically told him that his goal in life was to make him obsolete. No wonder Steve was angry.
Steve struggled as hard as he could, feeling a bone pop in his wrist as he twisted against the cuffs, but they shocked him with every movement, and, eventually, fighting against the endless jolts of electricity sent Steve limp in his attackers’ arms. “Don’t do this.”
Magic didn’t lie. If he and Tony weren’t meant to be together, well, there wasn’t anything he could do about that. He’d have to go home and find a way to get over him.
Now that he was properly awake, Steve realized the voice belonged to Tony. He blinked in the dark until he found Tony’s face, eyes still closed, concern furrowing his brow. “Tony?”
Tony watched, stomach flipping with affection, as Steve bent down to trade the drink for a kiss from Bucky. And at exactly the same moment, a helicopter whined through the sky, swooping low over the island. Tony swore and ducked back underwater until it had rounded the beach and disappeared.
Steve said goodnight to Thor on the way out, then hit the street. It was even colder now, the sun completely gone, and the nip with a wet, biting edge to it. Steve flipped up the collar of his coat and hunkered down against the wind, pushing his way the few blocks back to the apartment.
Tony wanted to end this in one fell swoop, to send everyone home from the frontlines. Steve didn’t know if that was possible for him anymore. But what Tony didn’t know, was how badly Steve wanted to try. It wasn’t as easy as programming a new computer. This freedom, this end, it was going to be hard fought. It was going to come at a cost. It always came at a cost.
"I swear Gail has a google alert for all things duck related. Either that or she's getting this stuff custom made."
Steve sat on the other, shooting a nervous look to the spies. Clint shot him a thumbs-up, his phone out and presumably recording. Steve was pretty good at holding back his super strength, but sometimes it was still hard to judge what a regular human could take. He worked his elbow into a good spot then took Tony’s hand, tamping down the inevitable thrill of touching the other man.
Steve slid his hands up the back of Tony’s shirt, tugging it out of his pants when he found his access limited. “You know… if we call a tow truck and hire a car to take us the rest of the way… we can ditch the conference and spend the next sixteen hours together in the extremely fancy hotel room you have booked for us.”
Lillian, 26, had a pink stripe in her hair and a lip ring that made a throb of interested blood head south, but Steve couldn't bring himself to swipe right. He felt he'd mastered the one night stand in the few months since he'd started using Tinder, but there was something very "a lot" looking about Lillian. "Not ready for that…" Steve muttered to himself as he swiped on.
Steve frowned, reaching out to poke the wobbly bit at the centre. His finger dipped right into it. “I guess we need to keep cooking it.”
Steve laughed and pressed a kiss to the end of his nose. “It’s okay, sweetheart. Old men like you need their sleep.”
Steve opened his eyes and smiled at Tony. He was folded over the car door, smirking at Steve in a way that never failed to make his blood heat. There were grease marks on his arms and Steve couldn’t pull his gaze away from them. “That’s Captain to you, Mr. Stark.”
"I - I think so. Yeah…" Surprisingly, he meant it. If he'd been alone for that, discarded back at the tower like leftovers, he'd be struggling right now, he knew that. But instead, it was something he and Steve had shared, like any one of their battles, and that made it all okay, somehow. Besides, he'd had like twelve orgasms, at least, and it was hard to stay unhappy with that many endorphins rushing through his veins. "Yeah, I'm okay. You?"
Greg smiled at him, condescendingly, indulgently. “Well, though I am one, it doesn’t actually take a genius to decipher the way you look at my brother.”
He took the elevator down to the lab, preparing himself for the potential disappointment that Tony would be deep in work calls and he'd have to leave the food outside the door so as not to disturb him. But when the elevator doors slid open, Steve could see immediately that the lab was dark and empty. His heart dropped into his shoes and he hovered stupidly in the elevator doorway, trying to process the entire lack of a working Tony. That meant he'd either forgotten his plans with Steve or chose to ignore them.
Tony moaned again in reply, bobbing his head like a nod until Steve’s cock hit the back of his throat.
Tony’s forearms were lean but muscular, and when he pushed his hand through his hair, sending the curls wild, Steve’s cock throbbed fuller and pressed against the seam of his pants. He shifted again, visions of Tony sucking his way across America surging up in Steve’s mind without warning.
“Just moved here. I’m a surfer, same with my friends -” Steve gestured to the gang still playing volleyball “- we came here for the winter to train.”
Tony’s eyes sprung open and he sat up with a gasp, lurching into Steve’s arms. Steve cried out and held him close, sobbing with relief.
Steve turned, surprised, when he heard his name, and jumped to his feet. Tony’s smile was infectious, and it wasn’t long until he was smiling too.
"You scared the everloving crap out of me today, you know that? What the hell are you doing going after Frost? She'll kick your ass. And she won't be able to help you any more than Shuri can. For fucks sake, Steve. If you don't manage to kill yourself, I'll kill you when you come home for giving me a fucking heart attack………… If you ever come home.
He had the whole walk home to think about Tony, a common theme for his walks home Friday nights. Tony was funny - hilarious - and kind, and silly, and generous, and he had this way of assuming that once someone was in his life they were all the way in. He’d always made Steve feel like there was nothing he wouldn’t tell him, nothing he wouldn’t give him if he asked.
He startled up again, lashing out as soon as he realized his arms were free for the first time in hours, but his flailing met nothing but hard tile. He looked around and realized that he was back in the tower, sprawled on the shower room floor. The tentacles were gone, but the crack in the tile next to his hand assured him that all of it had really happened. That, and the way his entire body was still thrumming.
Bucky was so hot. And so kind. And so good at his job. If only… Tony took a stabilizing breath, then went for it. "Hey, Buck? Want to come over for dinner tonight?"
Tony had been warned, that was the thing. He'd been warned several times. Warned by almost everyone who found out where he'd decided to go to school.
“Steve -” Tony started, but Steve shifted forward, rising up on his knees until they were chest-to-chest. He held a finger to Tony’s lips to silence him then replaced it with his lips, pressing a soft, almost chaste kiss there, belied by the fact that Tony was completely naked and chained up, and Steve had his shirt off and his pants unbuttoned, shamelessly tenting his underwear through the gap in his open fly.
Tony spread his legs wide, and once Steve had slicked his cock, he hooked his arm under Tony’s knee and hauled his leg up with him as he leaned forward to cover him.
“Yeah. Then he got a scholarship for science school and went off to get smart and then he joined the army. Excellent life choices.”
The very bad man was angry for a long time, but once all the plates were in pieces on the floor and he grew tired, he sat down, drank his tea, and vowed that his next plan wouldn’t go so awry…
Any cried harder and tried to squirm away, and Steve looked over his head at Tony. Tony wished he had some words of comfort or encouragement, but all he could do was mirror back his fear. When Ant wouldn't hold his hand still, Tony was forced to grip his elbow to keep his arm in place while Steve peeled his fingers open and got a good look at his hand. He dabbed the damp paper towel to his skin and it came back sickeningly red.
“Stop whining, Mr. Stark.” The nurse patted his head as though he was a puppy. “The sooner you let us get this over with, the sooner you can go back to being an idiot.”
“Reed, I think we should give Tony the benefit of the doubt,” Xavier said after a moment. “I trust him.”
“You were unconscious!” Steve yelled, forgetting to stay calm. Tony was being a stubborn ass. Steve was still shaking with fear. “That is
“Okay, so I’m going to ask you to see if you know anything about this animal,” he said, picturing Matilda in his mind.
Tony was abruptly confused. And concerned. “Er….I’m not sure I follow.” He was going to stick with polite questioning for now. The screaming accusations were sure to come at some later stage. He got the feeling that Strange had this effect on a lot of people.
Steve realized that Natasha’s real regret was that she couldn’t be with Tony right now. That she was stuck here with him and the others because of the choices she’d made. “I….”
“Perhaps Colonel Rhodes might appreciate the upgrade?” Coulson suggested. “After all, he’s out there facing Set’s minions.”
He narrowed his gaze. “Have you been taking lessons from Pepper?” He sent a suspicious glance to Pepper who was focused on her phone. “Are you turning
“But look at him now.” The tears were audible in Tony’s voice now. “He’s so goddamn beautiful. He’s a hero despite everything those assholes did to him.” He was smiling though. “I can’t think of a better person to love.”
“Thor and Loki have returned, yes,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. said. “They have requested that the entire team meet in the communal living area.”
“We need to have a plan in place before haring off half-cocked.” Coulson stepped up behind Clint, put a hand on his shoulder. “Perhaps I can sit here?”
want to know how Thor knew that. “Not that I'm not completely flattered by your interest in my love-life, big guy, but some things should remain private, you know?”
“Shouldn’t we take that outside then?” Bruce sounded as bad as Tony felt, the low tone in his voice telling him of his struggle to keep the Hulk in check.
Steve gulped. That was a shovel talk if he’d ever heard one. “I can’t promise that it won’t happen again, but I do promise that I will try my very best not to. It’s taken me a while, but I’ve realized that he’s pretty much the most important person in my life.”
Tony felt his own anger bubble up. “Well, ex-fucking-cuse me for not trusting the asshole who almost killed me the last time I saw him!"
Tony worshipped them from the top of their heads to the tips of their stiletto-clad toes. He grinned. “Well…”
He turned slowly to the huge glass doors leading out to the landing bay and barely contained a wince when Thor swept him into an embrace. “Tony Stark! Hale and well met, my friend!” Mjolnir lay at the doorway where he’d dropped it.
“The instructions are on the laptop provided,” Vision said; something thoughtful in that dispassionate tone. “Mr. Stark said that he hopes you get what you need when you use it.”
“I’d just like to officially announce that I hate everything about this place.” Tony felt the imperative to give voice to his annoyance.
know!” Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist. “You wanted to make the beast with two… no... three backs!”
Bruce thumbed behind him. Steve turned on the sofa and saw Bucky curled up around the Iron Man suit. “What the hell?”
Steve fell to the floor of the Quinjet, sucking desperately at air. “What…?” He lifted his head slowly and struggled to focus his burning eyes.
Tony grabbed Bucky’s hand when he saw it clench. “Done.” He said the only word that Bucky needed to hear. The slump of Bucky’s body against his made Tony relax too.
“I didn’t know who he was,” Tony reminded him. “I guess we’re going to find out who Cap’s loyal to.”
Tony tried to set Skurge's bald head on fire with his mind. Why did everyone pick on him? He didn't talk
Tony wondered whether the joys of working with super-smart people outweighed the pain-in-the-ass knowledge that he couldn’t keep much secret from them. He opened his mouth to fill the suspicious silence.
“Still don’t want to talk about it,” Rhodey added. “I mean, he’s my brother from another mother, but I’ve heard more about Anthony Stark’s sex life than anyone deserves.”
“Mathematics is magic in its own way,” Strange said. He leaned back, supremely relaxed. “All science is magical.”
“On it, boss,” Natasha said with the shadow of her usual smirk. Tony would take it. “I expect plan updates when we get back.” Technically, he, Tony Stark, was in charge of the Avengers Initiative. God help them all.
Tony felt Bucky and Steve behind him. They were waiting for him to finish, he knew. “I’m really happy to be seen,” he said to Bruce.
“Okay” Bucky danced from foot too foot. “I’m ready, let’s go again.” Steve had been very impressed with Bucky’s arm. It had held up against all the punishment Thor had put it through.
Steve shrugged, gave a small shake of his head. “I don't know, family, stability? The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out.”
Steve turned his gaze back to Bucky. The screams had stopped. Now he was rocking on the counter, staring out at nothing. Steve could see that
Tony’s gaze turned to Bucky. “Okay, that totally warranted kissing,” he acknowledged, pressing a kiss of his own to Bucky’s now smiling mouth.
Tony moved to the bench, reluctant to leave the comfort of Steve’s embrace and signed without bothering to look at what he was signing. It could have been a contract for his soul and he wouldn’t have given a crap.
“Well, that was an unexpectedly useful proposition.” It was Bruce’s dry as dust comment that had them all staring at him.
“That’s…” Steve stopped. “Pretty horrible actually.” What a way to grow up. At least he’d just had to worry about bullies and even then, he’d always had Bucky to take up for him.
“Sometimes you aren’t completely stupid,” Natasha told him with a smirk. She got up and kissed his cheek. “You need to get your head together, Steve. If Thor is scared for what is coming, then I’m afraid too.”
Thor squirmed a little. “He assisted my Jane and I in defeating the evil dark elf Malekith in his desire to rule this world. I thought that he had died in the battle, protecting me. I was prepared to offer a hymn to his courage, but discovered that he had fooled me once more and taken the throne while our father was mourning the loss of our mother.”
“Do you want to take the chance that it isn’t?” Coulson responded. “If he isn’t marked, then he needs the protection. If he is, then he might need to be taken down.”
take the time to comment it is beyond special. I am working through so many issues for so many people all at once that I sometimes feel like a pretty bad juggler.
Bruce shook his head. “Gay,” he affirmed. “He kissed Nat,” he reminded Tony. “And they’re like best buddies now.”
. He looked helplessly at Steve again and was astonished to see a half-smile ghosting across his face.
Bruce jumped, glaring at Tony over his shoulder. “One day I’m gonna get angry and punch you,” he warned. “You won’t like it when I’m angry.”
“I don’t mind sharing,” Tony refuted. “It’s just that I can’t trust you spy types to not try to reverse engineer everything I lend to you.” He’d had enough of making weapons that ended up in the hands of monsters.
“As the brothers Grimm over here told us, getting in was way easier than getting out.” Tony nodded towards the Winchesters. “I didn’t want to show all my cards at once.”
“Thank you for your help so far.” Steve held out a hand. The clear surprise in Loki’s face as he shook Steve’s hand was a revelation. The sheer happiness on Thor’s was reward enough.
Natasha spat a curse in Russian. “Don’t you fucking talk to me about war and death, Steve Rogers! You know
Natasha’s eyes were knowing. “You made a choice between your two best friends.” Her words were blunt. “Bucky, the boy you’d idolized all your life and Tony, the man who just wouldn’t be ordinary. You were always going to lose one of them.”
Steve started plotting how to wring Tony’s neck at the same time as he tried to control the red flush across his face.
“I hate you,” Clint groaned, letting Steve pull him back to his feet. “I hurt in muscles where I know for a medical fact there are no muscles.”
feel about him?” Tony asked, curious suddenly. He knew they were BFFs forever, but the future that Wanda had shown him had suggested more. There was something between Bucky and Steve, visible even now. Tony was a problem solver by nature. He needed all of the variables before he committed to a course of action.
“Okay, to recap, the sea is Asgard, the sky is Earth and the serpent is the wall between the worlds?” Tony wanted to make sure he had this all square in his head.
“When was he supposed to tell you his plans?” Natasha rolled her shoulders. “When you ran after Bucky the moment he escaped? Or when you deserted Rhodes in a heap on an airport runway? Or when you caved in the Iron Man suit and left Tony to find a way out of Siberia alone and incapacitated?” She was merciless in her questions.
The South African representative tapped a finger on the desk in front of her. “Are you saying that this ‘B.A.R.F.’ technology has given you control of the monster?”
“What is the thing you most wish for in the world, Tony Stark?” This time the voice was insistent, demanding an answer.
Tony gave an airy wave. “Bonne nuit, mes amis.” He turned to go, Rhodey at his heels. Bruce rested a hand on Tony’s back as they left with Bucky in tow.
“No!” T’Challa held up an imperious hand. “I suggest you spend the time of your flight home to think about what your choices have cost those who followed you. As well as what they cost those you left behind.”
Steve leaned over, still holding on to Tony. He scrabbled around a little until he crowed in triumph. “Seriously, you need to do some cleaning in there, Tony,” Steve told him as he straightened.
“You know I'm always going to be there with you,” Steve said. He wanted to add “to the end of the line” but reckoned that would have to wait.
Tony felt as sick as Steve looked. Bucky’s face was expressionless. “This where I’ll end up eventually?” Bucky asked.
Tony knew he was taking a chance coming here on his own. Everything had gone to shit, and he had probably already been declared a criminal. He landed in Siberia, grateful for the insulation of the armor.
Tony shrugged. “None taken, I don’t have the best track record.” And wasn’t this a shit-storm of his own making?
Dammit. He wasn’t supposed to have a sense of humor. “Maybe,” Tony hedged. “Depends what you’re offering.”
Bucky took pity on him. “I came to Tony for help. He gave me a new arm.” He waved the new arm around. “Then Steve showed up. The end.”
!” Tony said, still trying to recover from the fact that he’d just been kissed by the guy he had been lusting after for four years.
“I’m trying to tell you that when we’re together, we do better,” Steve said, being careful with his words.
Steve frowned. He'd missed that, he thought. Tony was often so manic, flitting from idea to idea, that Steve had missed that he wasn't currently firing on all cylinders.
“I would probably still have fucked up with Ultron,” Tony said. “And the Accords would have happened no matter what we did.”
Steve stifled a laugh. It wouldn’t be appreciated just then. Bucky nudged his knee with his own, smiling a little. Steve still got a thrill each time he looked over and saw
Tony felt Bucky’s finger at his hole, making him hiss. “I know that,” he said on a shaky breath. “It means everything to me too.”
“Thor, do you have any idea who is behind the plan to destroy the universe?” Steve brought the subject at hand back to their attention.
“You slept for nine point four hours, Mr. Stark.” Tony was really going to have to work on her comebacks.
Tony held up a finger. “Am I to understand that Captain America and the Winter Soldier have been schtupping in secret?”
Bucky’s laugh wasn’t pretty. “I know how that sounds,” he gritted. “But he’s been my anchor for the past two months.” He scrubbed his hand over his face. “As long as I could see him then I was okay.”
Bruce spent a few minutes checking Bucky’s pulse, and flicking the penlight in his eyes. He squared his shoulders. “I’d like us to run one last CAT scan, but I reckon you just need to give your brain a chance to heal.”
“Natasha I can understand,” Steve said, ignoring the biting words. “She came to us at your request.”
“The loss of three of the Infinity Gems was enough of a concern that the Masters of the Mystic Arts from across the world decided to meet.” Strange looked over at Thor. “The Tesseract was taken first, too easily distracted, your Heimdall.”
He hesitated, battling with the desire to crack the door and see if he could see Tony’s form in the dark, but he resisted. All of this was hard enough on the kids without Captain America barging in on them at night.
Taking initiative, as he had been programmed to do, JARVIS began his own investigation. First, he reviewed all the logs, footage, and recordings leading up to the missing section. The timeline was thus:
Subject TS-616 appears to be a sound candidate for the study. Body modifications are present (see chart YI-3975). It's unknown if these are standard. Note: compare to second subject.
They started to move more earnestly now, and it took a moment for Steve to realize they were getting him lined up, hips close to Tony. They lifted Tony's legs and tied them around Steve's waist, the slick brush of the tentacles a sharp contrast to the searing burn of Tony's overheated skin. It was pretty obvious what they were positioning him for. "Tony, I'm sorry. I wish it didn't have to be this way."
. Steve kissed Bucky then travelled back down Tony’s neck to the curve of his collarbone. Tony sighed and sunk back into Bucky’s hold, eyes fluttering open and tipping up. “Uh guys?”
Tony twisted his fork between his fingers then set it down. He stood. “Someone else should help you with this. You need someone, but I don’t think it should be me."
Tony found a pulse, guiding the man into the hall where he could lay the child down on a stretcher. “What happened?” He tipped the boys chin back and opened his mouth. A nurse joined him and started wheeling them towards an exam room, handing Tony an oxygen mask to fit over the kid’s face.
"Hey." Tony cut him off. "You're always top priority to me, okay? The rest of the Avengers have monitoring Earth under control, okay? Your job right now is to get better. Got it, soldier?"
Tony huffed and pulled up a seat. He stuck a spoon in the ice cream and frowned when it wouldn’t break through the frozen-solid surface. “Ugh.”
Tony finally pulled his emergency code from the mess of panic and adrenaline that was his brain. "JARVIS, code 89900! Emergency Shutdown Activate!"
But Steve shuddered and sighed, eyes fixed on the mess covering his stomach. "It's okay, Tony. It's okay. I - I don't - it's -
Thor held up the bottle. “This soda had - uh - an unusual fruit in it, from another world. Just wanted to make sure it wasn’t distressing your digestion. You feel the same as always?”
Tony’s chest heaved, trying to draw in enough oxygen to stay conscious. The Iron Man armour was destroyed beyond repair, helmet gone entirely. If only he’d managed another swig out of that bottle. Going down fighting was a necessity; going down drunk was a luxury. And Tony Stark was all about luxuries.
Tony bounced on his toes, his stiff leather shoes creaking from disuse. He tugged his cuffs down to his wrists for the seven hundredth time. He could hear the murmur of voices from the other room; his entire family was gathered in the hall - aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents - and Tony felt the pressure of several generations resting heavily on his shoulders.
Steve tossed Tony over his shoulder and marched across the room, shoving their suitcase out of the way, then tackled him backwards onto the bed, making him yelp. Tony clutched at Steve’s sides as Steve urged him into a kiss, rapidly turning from heated to full-on filthy. When Tony arched his hips up and Steve felt how eager he was to take this further, he straightened up and tugged his t-shirt over his head.
Steve had him almost folded in half, cock pounding deep in Tony’s ass with every snap of his hips, when he finally pressed forward and moaned out his release. His cock throbbed where it stretched Tony’s rim, pumping come deep inside him.
Steve smiled into the dark. He wondered how many people knew that Tony talked in his sleep, if he always had or if it developed later. He was glad Tony was close enough with him to let his guard down like this. It felt like owning one of Tony’s little secrets, something precious to hold and keep.
he managed around the gag, and Steve’s other hand landed on his cheek, cupping his jaw. His thumb traced Tony’s stretched out bottom lip. He never slowed his steady, unrelenting pace, jacking Tony off expertly.
"What?" Steve sat up and shoved his suitcase away to give himself some breathing room, since he certainly wasn't getting any air on the side Tony was occupying. "Oh! No. No, I didn't mean
. So much. I know I shouldn’t, but I do. I never should have told you, though. I should never have taken you out, kept calling you. It’s too dangerous. My life is too dangerous.”
“You’re shivering.” Steve pulled Tony even deeper into his hold, and the warmth flooded his veins like a shot of brandy.
Bucky looked up to see Steve handing Tony a glass of scotch, watching on with barely contained amusement. "I'm going to have to say something at the beginning of next lecture, aren't I?" Bucky whined.
“That was almost a word! Good job, buddy.” Tony put four slices of toast in the toaster and dug out butter, jam, marmalade, and peanut butter.  He covered one slice in each once they’d popped, put them on a plate and sat at Steve’s side. He set the plate down next to Steve’s head which jerked up - much like the toast out of the toaster - and wobbled slightly.
“Oh, fuck, no. Tell me you didn’t tell everyone else,” Bucky begged. “Clint will never let me live this down. Steve will take my oven away.”
So he thought nothing of opening the basket and taking a bite of a luscious chocolate bar. It was so good, he couldn’t bear to keep it all for himself. Tony picked up the basket and carried it upstairs to where his teammates were gathered in the living room.
The first thing Steve registered was the beeping of monitors and how hideously dry his throat was. He tried to clear it, but it wasn’t working. He tried again.
Steve lights up, beaming, glowing, and Tony likes to think that he’s happier now, that even though that kid in the alley had no idea what horrible things he was about to face, go through, that Steve’s come out the other end happier. “Oh, good,” he says softly, Brooklyn accent leaking back in at the edges, and now Tony’s smiling too.
There was movement between Steve’s legs and the last remaining scraps of his uniform were ripped away. The heat of Tony’s bare skin was pressed up against him, shoulders stretching his knees wide. “Tony -” Steve gasped, and then a tentacle curved around his cock, shocking away the rest of his words. More movement, and wet heat was guided down around him.
Something stirred deep in Steve's gut. He couldn't say he wasn't interested. "You sure you want to see this naked?"
“Okay, okay. God, this is so selfish of me, but I can’t say no. We’re going to figure out a way to keep you safe though, okay? I have a lot I need to tell you, and there’s going to be a lot of very not-fun parts of this, but if you think I’m worth it, I know you are.”
With Tony and the dog getting along swimmingly, Steve pushed up to his feet and offered the kid his hand. “Steve Rogers.”
Tony pulled open the car door and pressed forward, predatory, until Steve tipped back in his seat and let Tony climb up into his lap. “Come on, this is better than our honeymoon. Just you, me, and the open road.”
“Um, yeah. A binary star, actually, a pair of them. I just… I want you to know that’s - that I - I think of us like that? Two stars, bound together, relying on each other. It’s stupid, I know, but I couldn’t think of anything else that felt… right.”
Steve reached out and took Tony’s hand back, keeping it this time, and led him down the street and away from the shop. “Nah. I called out early tonight.” He grinned up at Tony through long eyelashes, eyes sparkling in the light from the streetlamp. “I was hoping you might stop by.”
“He’s alive.” That was Steve. Tony knew his voice. He purred into the firm heat of Steve’s chest as he settled in his arms.
Steve stepped aside and revealed the cake as Bucky stepped forward and threw his arm around Tony’s shoulder. “Welcome home, babe.” He kissed Tony’s cheek, and Tony leaned into it, but his eyes didn’t waver from the cake.
** After the woman thanks them, Steve says, essentially, "The pleasure was all mine" and then to Tony he says, "Well, if you're good, maybe it'll be your turn to please me."
Tony blinked his eyes open. He was cushioned by soft sheets, a warm strong arm curled under his neck and a firm chest under his cheek instead of a pillow. He tilted his head back to find Steve’s eyes. “Good morning.”
Steve popped the snap on his helmet strap and tugged it off. He ran dirty fingers through his hair, combing it back from his face. Sirens echoed down the street, but it was a comfort instead of a stressor. Sirens meant two things to the Avengers: either they were about to be called, or they'd just finished the battle and emergency crews could finally move in and start putting things back together. Even among the dust and debris, the damage and chaos, it was a profound relief to hear the city whirr back to life around them.
One of the bad guys called out something Tony barely heard. His ears were only going to catch his cues at this point, and whatever Bucky's excuses were.
Tony held up a sleek, state-of-art StarkPhone, and Steve could see his own face smiling back from his tinder profile. "Nope. Really me."

Tony sighed and crossed his arms, eyeing up the two men. Steve smiled nervously. “I would have eaten it,” Tony said.
Steve sighed. “Honestly? I usually try and do my homework in my head so it’s faster for me to do when I get home.”
A flash of lighting was followed by a low rumble of thunder, and Steve watched Anthony's tiny hands flex against the glass of the window. Rain pummeled the building, the loud rush of water blocking out every sound except the ceaseless rolling and rumbling in the distance. Steve leaned against the wall and took a sip of his tea. "What do you think, bud?" he asked.
There was something pained and defiant in Steve’s eyes, almost begging Tony to tell him to fuck off, needing that punishment or closure or something. And Tony knew the feeling, as surely as he knew that it would never be that easy.
"So… uh." Tony checked his phone overdramatically. "I have a call I'm going to be late for, but do you - um - want to catch dinner later? There's this new Greek place I've been meaning to try, supposed to have amazing calamari. I think you'd like it." And where the fuck had that come from? He made a mental note to have JARVIS compile a list of new Greek places. "We can talk about that suit upgrade you mentioned the other day," he tacked on hastily.
"Yeah, same knee is acting up. From the thing with the car." People swarmed the set around them, resetting and adjusting things. Claudia appeared at Tony's side wielding a makeup brush and Jeffery was already re-swooping Bucky's hair. "That was good, though."
"Yup." Tony threw his phone onto his bed and followed it with his body, collapsing face first. He screeched into his pillow.
"Honey?" He stuck his head in the bedroom to find Steve's glorious backside sticking out of the closet. Tony grinned and leaned against the doorframe.
"You're wet and freezing, and you clearly need someone to talk to. Come to the student centre with me. Let me buy you Starbucks, please?"
JARVIS redirected all his available resources to his logic processes, cross-referenced previous activity by both Mr. Stark and Captain Rogers with body language and tonal reference materials, comparing already recorded data with -
“Of course, sweetheart.” Steve stepped forward and pulled Tony into a kiss of his own. His lips were warm and soft and they parted easily to let Steve push the kiss deeper. When he pulled back, he touched his forehead to Tony’s. “Happy birthday.”
Steve’s mouth dropped open, and he slapped his hand over it. “Oh my god. I’m so sorry. I didn’t even think about how that would look. I just - I was so excited to hear that you feel that way too. I couldn’t help myself. I… I’ve wanted to kiss you for so long.”
Steve froze, throat seizing up. Tony without the arc reactor and the reactor without its glow haunted his dreams more often than not. There was a light sheen of sweat across Tony’s brow, but otherwise he looked fine as he poked at the pieces laid out in front of him, but that didn’t stop Steve from stumbling across the room, dropping the food containers on the couch and landing both hands on the desk.
Laura told Steve he’d be sharing the guest room with Nat, and Steve nodded, tight-lipped wondering how much her witnessing his fight with Tony had influenced that decision.
Tony doesn’t know what to say to all of that, though it’s making tingles run up through his chest and down his left arm. “How come you didn’t recognize me when we finally met in the future?”
Tony looked up from rearranging the honey jars to figure out where the curse had come from, but movement by his legs caught his attention and he looked down towards his feet. "Oh. Captain America is under my booth."
Steve blinked up at Tony’s face as Tony’s fingers slipped lower and Steve felt a dangerous rush of blood. “Tony,” he shook his head with a smile. “What are you doing?”
funny," Bucky said between peals. "It's fucking hilarious. Oh my god, Tony. I got weird because I realized I was developing feelings for you two, and I didn't know you were open to a third. I thought if I was around you both, it'd be obvious - no offence but Steve is a little more perceptive than you - and if you knew, it'd make things awkward. Also thought Steve might be upset with me since I'm here all day groping you and macking on you and he's stuck back in L.A. getting only pieces of you through Facetime. Thought that if I came over when he was there, he might give me a stern talking to about feeling up his man."
But he couldn't speak, and he couldn't move. When his hand tried to come up on its own, however, the creature responded, twining tightly around his wrists and raising them over his head. It backed him up against the smooth cool wall and pressed him to it, hands pinned over his head. Tentacles petted down his sides, their slick, soft skin like a hundred thousand feather-light tongues licking him all over. He groaned and rocked his hips forward, his impossibly hard cock weeping and throbbing as he spun towards yet another inevitable release.
At the tower, Tony Stark arrived home from a long day in board meetings and conference calls and went down to his workshop to find a box sitting on his desk. The box was wrapped in shiny paper with a huge bow on top. “JARVIS, where did this come from?” Tony asked.
Tony refilled his glass, spilling four hundred dollar scotch on his desk and nearly soaking the photo. No one had known the Batman was Wayne back then, but Cap had clearly known because in the corner of the photo, Wayne had written
Though, if you didn’t look too closely, in the dark shadows you might think it was him. “Dr. Stark,” Steve said, settled into his own chair.
Natasha’s sweater was tossed over the back of a chair, Bruce’s magazines covered the end table, Clint’s shoes had been kicked off in the hall, and Thor had left Mjolnir hanging on a coat hook by the elevator.
There was a rumble and a grunt and then a moment later, Tony appeared wearing the most ridiculous outfit Steve had ever seen. Baggy jeans hid all of his curves and edges, smothered over by a huge multi-coloured, multi-patterned, button-up shirt and a puffy, blue windbreaker with neon patches on the shoulders. Tony pushed aviator sunglasses up onto his forehead then threw his arms wide and winked. “Ta da!”
Steve turned a corner and the wall exploded in front of him slamming him back against the bricks and momentarily stealing his breath. He staggered back to his feet, sucking dust in with his next shaky breath. His arm came up automatically in front of him, but he didn’t have the shield.
"Okay, fine, it's Dad's law. And yes, blanket fort. To the linen closet!" Tony rummaged around on the coffee table until he found his phone. He turned on the flashlight and set off down the hall. Steve followed him closely, having no clue where his own phone was.
Forehead is stock still for a heartbeat and then he collapses in on himself like a dying star, crying out and slamming his hands down over his balls in a satisfyingly amusing reflection of the position they’d caught Tony in.
An hour later, thoroughly kissed and with a few decorations thrown around the apartment and a small pile of presents laid out on the coffee table, they stood side by side in the kitchen, staring down at Bucky’s phone while it played a youtube video about icing a cake. Steve’s brow twisted tighter and tighter as the chipper young woman on screen talked about “crumb coats” and “tier separators.”
“Uh…” Steve frowned down at the cash register. It didn’t seem like Tony was going to let this go. If he refused to explain it, they’d probably lose a customer, but if he did, Tony would be so freaked out by Steve’s weird obsession that Steve would probably lose his job. “It’s nothing, really…” Steve said quietly, praying that Tony would brush it off.
Steve reeled. This afternoon had taken a wild turn somewhere. Tony’s question was too confusing so Steve said, “Gingerale?” to the waiter and he nodded and walked away.
"Steve, right. Sorry. I - uh?" Tony tilted his head to the side, and it took everything in Steve's power not to immolate on the spot from sheer humiliation. "Everything okay?"
Tony lurched up and wiped a hand over his cheek. "Hey, Steve. I - uh -" His voice hitched. "I wanted to get the freshest hug of the day so I got here before you opened." He stood there, looking small and a little broken, his endless bags a mess around his feet.
Thor sighed. “I understand the idiom, Lady Natasha, but it is indeed as though someone has died.” He dropped his chin onto his fist. “My brother refuses to even discuss the possibility of not handing himself over to the Collector.”
Things were a little more subdued inside than at the usual Avengers gathering. Bruce had given up on the piano, thank god, and was talking with Vision in a corner.
“No, you’re not.” Steve couldn’t afford to be gentle about this. “I’m going to ask Bruce whether he can work on your problem while Tony and Vision carry on with the bigger issue.”
The doors to the control room opened as soon as he stepped in front of them. Matilda leaped out of his arms, heading straight for the chair. She clambered up, turning to look at him with a prr-meow.
“Yes sir,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. replied. “I should warn you that Captain Rogers is making his way downstairs.”
Wilson slouched against the elevator wall, staring at them. “You know Steve isn’t petty,” he growled, hands stuffed into the pockets of his jacket.
“Be nice,” Steve chided her. “He’s the one who keeps you in Widow’s Bites and vodka.” He winked at Tony.
“Got something!” Rhodey yelled, and they all winced as the feedback squealed through the comms. “Sorry!”
“Except I could never believe it, never accept it.” Clint wiped a hand across his face. “Jeez, that poor guy.”
Thor shrugged. “It is how life is in Asgard. My father ensured I would be ready. Even if I didn’t have Mjolnir I was able to fight almost any foe.”
Steve started salivating when he saw the stacks of pancakes, bacon and syrup. “”He?” He was too focused on the food to pay much attention.
Before Tony could reply, the elevator dinged again. “That the rest of the team?” Dean asked, looking alarmingly eager.
Tony appreciated the tone. He turned back to Ross who got to his feet. “Now, why would you feel the need to arm your bodyguards with weapons clearly intended to hurt us?” he mused.
Steve wasn’t the only one whose mouth dropped open in surprise. “Bruce?” He looked over to Natasha, but she appeared just as shocked. Well, as shocked as Natasha
Thor nodded. “Indeed, Captain. However, it is possible to for a container to hold the stones without being in contact with the wielder, but allowing that one to access their power.”
“Tony.” It was Bruce who made Tony halt his tirade. Bruce who tried so very hard to stay calm, to not let his monster out unless he was needed. “Vision is right. It’s the smart thing to do.”
Loki sighed. “I am not the person I was before this all began,” he said, ignoring Thor’s angry bristling at Natasha. “I’ve grown up spoiled and selfish.”
Steve bent to kiss him again, sucking Tony’s brain out through his mouth. He was probably drooling by the time Steve pulled back. “Because I wanted to know more about you, Doc.”
Tony wasn’t one for introspection. He usually accepted things as they were and either changed them or moved on. This situation with Steve and co wasn’t something he had either option to do. He was going to have to deal with them.
“The Frost Giants are large and terrible,” Thor said. “You must have suffered greatly.” His huge arms went around Loki in an embrace that was both loving and comforting.
Steve came to stand beside Tony. It was very hard not to be distracted by the miles of skin in front of, and next to him. Tony deserved a fucking award, he thought, eyes running covetously over Steve’s body.
Steve laughed then. “It used to make me crazy,” he said. “Until one day I realized that it was all part of the Tony Stark Smokescreen.” Sam raised an eyebrow. “The public Tony is very different to the real deal. He wears his suits and sunglasses like Iron Man wears the armor.”
“Don’t you ‘hey’ me!” Tony poked Bucky’s chest. He sort of wanted to rub his hands over it then too, but…focus! “How did you find out about the kid and the snake being a thing?”
“He had you too,” Tony said, bringing his arms up eventually and gripping Steve’s forearms as he leaned back against him. “Even though you weren’t there, he always had you.”
The Avengers assemble....and things devolve rapidly. Thor returns and a sort of half-assed plan emerges. Nothing about this pleases Fury.
“Uh, we’ll go…” Steve edged towards the door, Bucky sidling along with him. “…somewhere that isn’t here.” They fled. Fucking cowards. Tony glared at them.
He trotted down the stairs, turning away from his workshop and heading for the gym. The smack of flesh and grunting had him grinning. Steve and Bucky were hyper-competitive. They enjoyed fighting each other almost as much as they loved ganging up on the rest of the team.
“Man up, Tony.” Coulson clapped a hand hard on his back. “You have apologies to make to several folk, including our guests.”
Yay! The finale is coming. I'm going to be very sad to say goodbye to these guys. Thanks for sticking with me. Lordy. Y'all deserve medals or something.
Tony was going to complete this mission if only to come back and kick Strange’s ass. He stared up as the dome of the tree root grew closer.
“It’s the hair,” Tony said, gazing down at his hand and watching the gauntlet ooze in and out of his skin in a disturbingly creepy way. “She looks so sweet but she’s the devil.”
It seemed like a signal for everyone else. They moved too, leaving Tony. “Where are you all going?” he blurted.
“First of all, ew.” Tony held up on finger. “And second of all, none of your fucking business.” He held up his middle finger.
Natasha and Bruce had mobilized the crew, called them and told them that the Avengers Tower was inhabited once more.
“Yeah, whatever. This was fun but it’s time for you to go.” She huffed stomping out with all of her stuff in her hands. She slammed the door behind her causing the apartment to shake but that didn’t really faze Steve. He stared up at the ceiling rethinking his whole life.
“What are you doing here?” Tony asked as he stepped out to the porch. He placed both hands on his hips waiting for an answer. Steve paused at the steps knowing this might have been a bad idea.
“Now!” Peter huffed and went as asked. Tony felt bad for doing so but he needs to talk to Steve first. He needed to know why Steve was here because they had a lot to talk about. Tony rubbed his stomach. He felt a kick and smiled. “Ready to go meet your dad?" This was fun the first time Tony surprised Steve with a baby but this time around it just felt sad. Tony took a deep breath to try to calm his nerves.
Several months went by with not much change in his relationship with Steve. At home, life was changing and the boys were helping so much. Peter and Harley were excited, but they also had a lot of questions. Like was their pops was ever coming back home. Tony couldn’t answer that only Steve could.
Tony laid awake like he did every night. Staring at the ceiling counting every single tile. 126. The number never changed but it always surprised Tony. The last person he wanted to think about always came up with that number. 126 was their anniversary. Tony decided to walk into a bar and fall in love with a pair of eyes that would make him drown. They did. Tony moved out of his bed making his way to the kitchen. If he wasn’t going to sleep; he mines awhile get some work done. Then he heard a knock at his door.
“Steve.” Steve didn’t turn around but instead focused on the hem of his shirt. It was easier this way.
·       Ivan is the sweetest and sensitive man you will ever meet. He will cry at a Hallmark commercial.
Steve ran next door to quickly grab the stuff, but he found himself pausing in the doorway. The nursery was beautiful. Everywhere he looked he saw blue, red, and gold. They were their colors. On the back wall, it was still blank with a single sticky note, for Steve. Steve sniffled loving how Tony knew he would want to paint something for their son. His mind was brought back to reality when he heard Tony scream his name. Steve grabbed the items and ran back into the room.
“Let’s be honest with each other. You and I clearly still like each other and maybe could see a future where we could be together. Correct me if I’m wrong.” Steve just nodded allowing Tony to continue. “But there’s a lot of brokenness here. Do you realize Steve that you broke me so much that I couldn’t have a stable relationship? I stopped trying and went to therapy to work on my abandonment issues. Every session you were the reason why I went. Not because of my crappy childhood, or the scars on my chest but because you cheated on me and broke my heart. I cry almost every night feeling inadequate. Unlovable.” Tony closed his eyes allowing the tears that built up spill down his cheeks. Steve couldn’t bear to watch Tony feel this way. He wrapped the man he stilled loved tight in his arms.
·       She loved to build all kinds of things. She would bug her uncle Tony to let her join him in the lab, but Nat and Bucky said no. Didn’t want her seeing the Iron Man suit so instead Tony would come to them. He didn’t mind since most of the time his own daughter was over there too.
Tony, you are adorable for trying to be so formal. Just write. I want to know how your day was and what you have been up to. Also, I’m so sorry this letter came a month late but in my defense, your letter didn’t get to me till two days ago. I miss you a lot too and the whole team but mostly you. Don’t tell the others. I can’t wait till I can come back home. I miss you close in my arms. The mission is going really well but I still have some ways to go to the finish. Oh, also tell Buck to suck it up. I bet he much rather be on a mission with Nat than me. They’ve been fondueing for months. Don’t tell him that I told you that. Hey, I got to go but I love you.
“I missed you so much,” Steve said around tears. He blinked not realizing how much he was crying. He was just glad to be home for now.
·       Fluent in English, Italian, French, and know a little bit of Russian thanks to his aunt and uncle.
·       They have a tight relationship with both of their parents. You should see their game nights.
“Tony, I’m fine. Plus, this is my job. This is the only thing I know.” Steve said. Tony shook his head and took a deep breath so as not to yell. No point in getting into a screaming match.
“Shhh. Shhh. It's going to be okay daring. I’m sorry for not telling you. I was afraid that you would try to talk me out of this. After watching the news, I knew I had to do something to help. Everyone else is why couldn't I.” Steve held Tony tight refusing to let go. Tony turned around looking at him in the eye searching for something, but all Tony saw was that he was serious. This was what Steve wanted. This was what Steve had to do. Tony took a deep breath and placed both hands on either side of Steve’s face and nodded his head.
“Hi.” Steve wrapped his arms around his body trying to keep as much heat in as he could even though he knew the cold he was feeling wasn’t from the rain. Steve gave Tony a weak smile. God, how much he missed that smiled. He missed everything about Steve. The stolen kisses in between meetings, and his strong arms around him late night placing soft kissing along his shoulders. He would often whisper between each one, baby one day it will just be me and you. Tony played with his ring on his finger trying to forget those days knowing that never came and still won’t. Tony was very happy with his new life.
“Surprise!” Tony whispered. Steve nodded without saying a word. Tony gestured for him to come closer. Steve did as asked. He slowly walked afraid that his legs would give out from under him. Steve took a deep breath and smiled.
“I was watching the news in a bar getting drunk when I realized this might be my last chance to be with the love of my life. So, I called a taxi and drove here not knowing what you were going to say. Knowing if you were going to tell me to go fuck myself or that Rhodey would kick my ass. I knew I had to try. So, what I’m about to say will make me sound like the worst person on the planet but.” Steve pulled Tony close and smashed a hard kiss to his lips. Tony wrapped his hands in his hair feeling the soft light strands run through his fingers, missing the feeling. Steve ran his hands down his back and gripped them around his ass sending shock waves of pleasure through his body. Only with Steve did he feel like this. The euphoric of feeling like a teenager again.
·       Theo has a crush on his best friend Alex, but he keeps denying those feelings since he has a girlfriend.
“Yes,” Tony mumbled into Steve’s shoulder. Steve pulled him away and looked Tony in the eye. Steve could tell this was real.
“Want to meet your sister.” Peter and Harley just stared at her in awe. She was so tiny with her blond hair and bright blue eyes.
“Yeah, I am. Besides we got to get ready for your baby sister’s arrival.” Steve smiled. Peter pulled back and grabbed Steve’s hand to drag him into the house.
“I think I might have been in labor for longer than I thought. Been having these weird pains for a couple of days but I just thought it was just Braxton hicks. Clearly, I was wrong.” Tony croaked out. Tony leaned against the bed that they have finally made to. Steve helped Tony stripped his pants away and discarded them to the side. He continued messaging the areas that Tony asked for like his hips and lower back.
·       He’s supposed to be king one day, but he doesn’t want it. In reality, none of his siblings do. That might be because they were raised between Asgard and Midgard.
“You know I do, babe. It will be okay though. It’s just nine months. Remember that one mission I had to go on that was two years long when we first started dating.” Tony nodded but still didn’t feel any better.
'Steven, don’t. Please just explain. Why didn’t you tell me you wanted to join? You know I would have supported you, but this is hard to process. You’re telling me I won’t be able to see you, touch you, talk to you for two years.” Tony tried to take a deep breath, but air wouldn’t come. His hands shook with fear for the man he loved. Tony fell to his knees unable to take the feeling of soul-crushing news anymore. Tears fell down his face as he sobbed. The feeling of strong arms wrapping around him helped him catch his breath, but the sobbing continued. He couldn’t imagine his world without Steve.
·       Natasha and Bucky loved the idea that all of their children's names to be of Russian origin. One because that is where Nat is from and because that was where they met. No matter what horrible stuff they went through in that country it still brought them together.
·       He has no desire to go out into the field as his siblings did. He’s just here to be moral support.
“Tony.” Tony sucked in a breath knowing what he was about to ask would either bring on another fight or tears.
“This kind of reminds me of when I was pregnant with Peter.” Tony chuckled. Steve had slight panic in his eyes.
·       Kat would do makeovers on her all the time. They were each other’s best friend. She was the only one that brought Kat’s loving side out.
“I can’t be second choice to Bucky. I shouldn’t have to be Steve. Go home, Steve. Go home to your husband and deal with whatever that is broken in your relationship.” Tony spoke evenly not giving Steve the satisfaction of a fight. He placed all of Steve’s belonging into his arms. He opened the door to show him out.
·       Freya is super sweet but also very quiet. She lives in her mind a lot and often forgets to interact with others. She never would do anything out of line.
“What if tonight, you call Bucky and tell him you won’t be coming home. You could stay here with me.” Steve rubbed his hands down his face. He could feel the pressure mount in his temples. It wasn’t like he didn’t want to stay here with Tony tonight or forever, but things were complicated. It was like Tony didn’t understand that.
Tony looked at the picture of him with the ghost. It was right after the first tour. Tony shook his head knowing that he couldn’t have done anything to stop him from chasing whatever he lost in the desert so many years ago.
·       He adores his Uncle Steve but the day he found out Ivan was dating his little girl he almost killed him, figuratively. Now Steve supports their relationship and loves him like a son.
Tony knew it wasn’t towards him or about him. Steve was struggling with being himself again. Then there were the nightmares. Those scared Tony the most. Tony did his best with confronting Steve and bringing him back from the darkness, but Tony was no therapist. Tony would try to get Steve to open up and talk but Steve often would say he was fine. He promised that when he was ready, he would. Tony respected his boundaries, but it hurt so much to watch the person you love suffer so much. With everything Tony tried to be supportive until he got the slap in the face of a lifetime.
“No, Steve, it’s okay.” Tony’s shoulder’s slumped feeling the defeat in his voice. It was nice while it lasted right, he thought. He turned around and faced Steve. They were going to have the discussion they didn’t have several years go right here, right now. They weren’t dumb kids anymore. They were adults and Tony hoped Steve had grown up a little.
Steve was gone with very little contact. He talked to boys on facetime once in a while. Tony would often find himself reading the letters from years ago. Steve was so thoughtful in those letters. He missed that Steve. Then one faithful night Steve stopped by Tony’s office not knowing why. He knew he missed Tony a lot. He missed being at home. Steve would never not going to be madly in love with Tony. He guessed he came to just talk to the man he would always love.  Well, what happened that night sure wasn’t talking. Then Steve was gone once again.  This really didn’t surprise Tony, but he was surprised by what happened a month later.
·       He talks to James a lot and Kat. They were the terrible three growing up. James was the voice of reason since he didn’t want to get in trouble with his pops, but Arne and Kat didn’t care.
“Water’s already broke and contractions are five minutes apart.” Tony sucked in another breath pushing through another one. Steve gave Tony a thumbs up. You would think he would be afraid, but he’s already done it twice and his boys came out fine so, will his daughter.
“You just couldn’t wait another week which was supposed to be your actual birthday. You wanted to meet your daddy so badly. You missed him, didn’t you? Yeah, I missed him too.” Tony smiled not breaking eye contact with Steve.
Tony sat on the edge of the bed watching Steve pull on his clothes. Every muscle in his back pointing out and calling him back in. He wanted to crawl back over to him and wrap him up in arms. Tony wished that Steve could be all his. That he didn’t have to share him with anyone else. At last, wishes never come true. Steve would have to leave once again, and they would return back to their separate lives. Tony pulled his knees to his chest trying not to cry. He knew what this was but that didn’t mean it didn’t hurt any less.
·       Her and her brother are super close even though they are six years apart. Brooklyn knows how to push all of his buttons, but they always have each other’s backs.
“Sex. We should have sex. Like right now.” Steve placed the plate in his hand on the counter and gave Tony a perplexed look.
“It’s time?” Tony gave a thumbs-up as he continued working through the contraction. “Okay, let's get you in the car. As much I would love to help deliver this one, let’s not make it three for three alright.” Tony smiled up at him and shook his head no.
·       Theo has a fascination with gamma radiation and even found four new ways that society can use it.
“I know, honey but it burns because the baby is crowning you are so close.” Tony pushed again feeling the burn but also feeling the baby’s head move farther. “Keep going. She’s almost here. One more push.” Tony pushed with a scream and he felt all the pressure gone. Steve placed the baby on his chest. She was so beautiful.
“Captain Steve Rogers please report to the landing pad.” Steve and Tony just looked at one another not wanting to move but knowing they had to.  Tony placed both of his hands on either side of Steve’s face and kissed him hard. The last kiss for a long time. Tony pulled back giving Steve a solemn smile.
The rain pattered against the windows making Tony feel tried. He curled closer to Rhodey who was to invest in the movie to notice Tony was bored. Then the doorbell rang, and Tony shot up to go grab it. Who would be here so late at night? Maybe it was Peter wanting to spend the night after staying out too late with Ned doing some project. Again. Tony swung the door open to reveal a very wet Steve. Tony rubbed his eyes to make sure that who he was looking at was Steve. Which it was. He only had a tee shirt and a pair of jeans on. His hair was dripping wet, the droplets running down his cheeks making him look like he was crying. If Tony looked closer Steve’s eyes did look red like he had been crying.
“Watch,” Bucky repeated, pressing his face against the front of Steve’s boxers, taking a deep breath. Steve and Tony both groaned in unison.
“This is a goddamned conspiracy,” Tony grumbled, secretly thrilled at the attention. But appearances must.
Thor frowned. “The stones are powerful objects tied to different aspects of the universe. Each possesses unique capabilities that have been enhanced and altered by various alien civilizations over millennia.”
Bucky stepped up to him, put his hand on the back of Tony’s neck and pulled him forward so that their foreheads rested together. “Deal with it.”
Tony lifted his hand to Steve’s cheek. “You’re such a romantic,” he said, tugging Steve closer. The kiss was as soft and tender as Steve’s smile. It made something inside Tony curl up and want to cuddle.
Sam came in with a cup of coffee and a bowl of something that smelled a lot like his mom’s chicken soup. “Thought you might be hungry,” he said, handing the items to Steve.
Several arguments later, they’d agreed that only a small team was going on the mission. Steve and Bucky had both insisted, a manic light in their eyes. Tony thought that the idea of taking on Hell itself was disturbingly a turn-on for them.
“I don’t want to be a babysitter!” Steve refused to use the curse word simply because Tony had. “I want to be your friend.”
“Behave,” she told him before leaving. They all watched her leave with varying degrees of appreciation.
Tony snugged in, wriggling until his ass found the perfect indentation in his mattress. “It wasn’t that bad.”
“I think he has a concussion,” Steve announced, giving Bucky his coffee before pouring a mug for himself. “He’s acting weird.” Everyone stared at him, including Tony. “Weird-
Tony took his glasses off and stared directly into the camera. “Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided that you just died, pal. I'm gonna come get the body. There's no politics here; it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon; it's just you and me. And on the off-chance you're a man, here's my home address: 10880, Malibu Port, 90265. I'll leave the door unlocked.” He looked at the reporter. “Bill me.”
“I’ll stop you before you hurt anyone,” Steve promised. He dropped a hand onto the nape of Tony’s neck. It made Tony want to purr.
Words calculated to hurt in the worst possible way. They had cut into him with surprising force and Tony had a feeling that he hadn’t stopped bleeding.
“Plus, I think the President might actually have the mark of Set, so Cap needs you to keep an eye on him.” Bruce’s words had them all staring at him. “Right?” C raised an eyebrow at Steve.
When it seemed as though she wanted to launch herself at him, Coulson put a hand on her arm. “As the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D I was unable to give that information out. And Tony is now the Director of Superhuman Affairs, so he has a certain amount of responsibility to keep his mouth shut too.”
“Like beehive only hoove,” Tony whispered loudly. Bucky put a hand over his face and tried to smother his laughter.
“Not without me, you’re not,” Tony said. Steve’s eyes narrowed and Tony narrowed his own back. “Don’t even fucking try it, Capuchin.”
“Well, this has been a whole barrel of laughs, but I have to get over there and save my boos,” Tony said, thumbing towards the melee on the other side. “Smell you later, Set.” He let the name fall from his lips like an after-thought and was gratified to see Lucifer’s eyes go wide with shock. “Your jewelry is with the Asgardians. It’s not going to be of any use to you now.”
Steve blanched, stomach roiling. “I feel like someone shot me in the face,” he confessed. He flopped down beside Bruce on the sofa, looking around the living room at the devastation Thor had wrought.
“The stone, brother.” Thor’s voice reverberated in Tony’s head. “Hold. You must keep it out of our reach or the power of its destruction will kill us all.”
“Yeah, Rogers, what are you going to do about it?” They both turned to look at Rhodes. “I’m kinda invested in the happiness and well-being of my best friend. What you did to him. To the team. I’m not okay with it.”
Bruce looked pained at the nickname. “It looks similar to the signature of the Tesseract, but there are subtle differences.”
Steve hitched a laugh as Tony dug his heels into Steve’s butt. “Stop teasing him, you asshole.” He jerked against Tony when Bucky bit his earlobe.
“This is getting us nowhere,” Steve said, banging a hand on the table. “We have a legitimate threat from someone we have no control over. Can you all please fucking focus?” He ended on a shout.
He stared at Steve. “I knew that Barnes was a victim. Hell, I forgave him pretty much the moment he rescued me from the hospital room.” He grinned up at Bucky and Steve wanted that smile to turn to him. “Barnes is my new pet project. That arm needs to be rebuilt.”
“Sir, your vitals are spiking,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. probably thought she was helping. He wanted to put a bullet through her artificial brain.
“Pfft,” Tony scoffed. “If you were even a little bit gay, you’d be all over this.” He patted his ass.
Sam zipped one of the duffels open, pulling out a bowel and something that looked suspiciously like a pestle and mortar.
She shook her head. “I should call him, tell him how I feel.” She sounded far-away. Steve was legitimately terrified for her.
Sam looked deep in thought. “Too easy though. Usually it’s more obscure,” he said, almost to himself. “The black hand is the mark he’s using to control humans. We need the mark that controls him.”
Tony glared. “None of your business, buster.” He didn’t dare slide his gaze over to where Bucky stood. He was as transparent as glass to him. Because they were actually the same person born fifty-ish years apart.
Her eyes were narrowed in suspicion and Tony saw Natasha’s shoulders shake just a wee bit out of the corner of his eye. “Right.” She drawled the word out as though she had a tough time believing him. Which, because she knew Tony, was not unexpected.
“It will have to do,” Tony said. “But if you go back on your word, I promise that the bitch-slap Hulk rained down on your ass in New York will seem like a love-tap once I'm done with you.”
“Are you boys planning on jabbering all day or are we going to do this thing?” Natasha’s eyebrow had risen to murder proportions.
“The Mind Stone, which is within the head of your Vision, should do the work that you need the Tesseract to do,” Loki suggested.
“Asgard is no more,” Thor said, setting Matilda down. In a flash she hopped up onto Tony’s bed, curling in several circles until she found the spot she wanted. “It was of no matter what you named that world.”
Steve nodded. “I showed her a mental picture of Matilda, and she went a little nuts. Got several flashes of something that she is not happy about and then this started.” He waved at the chair. “Translation?”
“I am aware that it is taboo in this world for close family members to engage in sexual relations,” Vision said. “But perhaps it is acceptable on….”
“Oh, you knew your name,” Bucky told him. “You shouted it at people when they wouldn’t bring you more booze.”
“You’re shouting at your non-existent lady computer person,” Steve pointed out, deliberately talking like the brainless idiot Tony
“I don’t want you to hate me. It’s not just Steve who’s crazy about you,” Bucky confessed, none of the familiar cock-sure attitude in his face. This was the real Bucky, the guy that Steve had been willing to give up his life to save.
Bruce came into the room. “That was an interesting list of expletives,” he noted, dropping down beside Tony. “Anything I should know about?”
“No,” she held up a hand. “I made my choices.” Her mouth twisted. “I live with the consequences. And so should you.”
“What the fuck?” Rhodey stared at them. Then he finally noticed Bucky, and his weapons came up. “What the actual fuck?”
“I thought you were dead.” Steve tried a new tack. He knew Bucky better than anyone, he could get through to him, dammit.
“Most of us,” Natasha said. Steve tried to ignore that twinge of guilt whenever he thought of how stupid he’d been to trust Wanda so quickly.
“A cock star,” Dean replied. Steve choked on the gulp of coffee he’d just taken. Tony bumped the fist Dean held out.
Vision’s head tilted to the side. “Ah!” he declared. “It means that Tony has a high opinion of himself.” He nodded. “A most appropriate expression, Captain.”
the guy that had become the person Steve had called his friend. “So, are we gonna fight, Rogers?” Tony asked.
Tony felt something soft and gooey flutter through him as he looked into Steve’s eyes. Love shone out of them, as clearly as if he’d said it out loud.
“Is she hot?” Sam asked, shoveling pancakes in as fast as he could. They’d all learned to eat quickly with Bruce in the vicinity.
Crowley turned in the air, standing on nothing. “You’ll have to use the bridge,” he told them. “We didn’t cater much for actual humans visiting us.” He spun around once more, striding across the tear in the earth, heading for the other side of the gorge.
Bucky just picked him up. “I’m not going to have Captain America bitch me out because I let Iron Man get drunk,” Bucky told him as he walked into Tony’s industrial sized bathroom.
Tony’s cheeks puffed out as he took a breath. “What the hell, here goes nothing,” he said, reaching down and pressing the hidden releases that allowed him to remove and replace the arc reactor.
“Do. Not. Touch.” Steve repeated. Tony watched as Bucky unbuttoned Steve’s jeans, taking his time now as he slowly slid the zipper down.
“F.R.I.D.A.Y., can you please ask that Barton and Bruce meet us here? And remind my sometimes green buddy that Romanoff is here.”
They were all dressed in their white and red quantum suits. Rhodey put up his hand, “Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, you know, and...” He makes a wringing motion with his hands. They all flinch.
“He’s right,” Dean said, suddenly more serious than Tony could remember seeing him. “Purgatory is a shithole.”
“I know you wouldn’t,” Tony assured him. “But sometimes you forget just how awesome your hammer is.” A little flattery usually went a long way with Thor.
“Can we please get back to the problem at hand?” Bruce asked, clearly desperate to move the conversation to something he felt more comfortable with, like the end of the universe.
Tony felt duly chastised. And then he whined, “He kissed me J, and then left.” Ran, more like it, Tony's mutinous mind supplied helpfully.
Banner.” Tony could feel his jaw clench. He’d been ready for this line of questioning. “And it’s relevant because one of the reasons for the Accords ever existing was because Thaddeus Ross had a rage boner for Bruce and wanted a way to control him!” He took a deep breath. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to shout. The Accords are necessary. I’m not disputing that.” He indicated the men with him. “
Tony slipped a hand around Bucky’s fist. “It’s not quite the same, babe.” Bucky’s fingers relaxed, allowing Tony to link their hands. “But I understand why you feel that way.”
“No.” Tony met Bruce’s calm gaze. “The Science Bros have tapped out of the superhero business for good this time.”
Steve sighed. Tony wondered just what the hell was going on there. “Loki has taken the President hostage. We’re on our way to negotiate.”
Tony looked at him. “You’re looking remarkably satisfied with life,” he noted. Hopeful, Tony thought, Bucky looked hopeful.
“So, he hid.” Steve stared at Matilda. She stared back at him, emerald eyes unblinking as she watched him. “He took a form that would seem harmless to all, unappetizing to the Wraith.”
He reached out to cover Bucky’s fingers with his own. They stared at each other over Steve’s shoulder as they moved their hands over Steve’s skin.
Tony wriggled a little, finally getting Bucky to let him go. He scooted towards the edge of the bed, looking at the picture they made.
“What is it, Wanda?” Steve felt a peculiar urge to protect this girl. Her decision to fight on their side had cost her her brother and nothing Steve could ever say or do would change that.
“Huh.” Tony considered this. “So, when you think about it, about half of the team is going to live for a very long time.” He counted them off, “Thor, Steve, Bucky, Vision, you and me.”
“Perhaps,” Loki shrugged. “I cannot say as I have never encountered an Infinity Gem that has been split in two vessels.”
okay with it?” Bucky asked, trying for a blank face, but failing spectacularly. Tony was onto him. Bucky was the least capable person he'd ever met of hiding his emotions. They were lit up on his face like a beacon.
“Which dickhead are we talking about?” Natasha enquired. “I’m not sure I want to meet any more dickheads.”
“My secret weapon,” Tony declared proudly, watching them wrestling. He didn’t say anything when he saw Rhodey’s toes curl while he laughed. But he wanted to punch the air at the visible proof that Extremis was working.
“He didn’t do it for you, Captain. He did it to keep a promise to Margaret Carter.” He looked around the room. “I need to return to New York. I hope that the technology helps you.”
Clint handed the phone to Steve. “She says that currently Tony, Rhodes and Bruce are in a closed-door meeting with the UN General Assembly.”
“You can't tell me that you're the same fella who woke up from the ice,” Bucky said. “You'd be a liar if you did.”
Currently, they were both shirtless, chests pressed against each other as they kissed, hands wandering and cocks hard and desperate. It had been a long, cold winter, summer, spring and fall for Tony. Since falling for Steve, nobody else had even been close to appealing.
Tony wanted to be sick. He grabbed Bucky’s face in his hands, forcing his eyes up. “Never.” He met Bucky’s anguished gaze. “
He saluted her and then kissed her cheek. “How could I have been so dumb as to let you slip through my fingers, Ms. Potts?”
Tony couldn’t lie to himself. He was goddamn terrified. What happened today would change the world. Well,
Steve swallowed hard. “I wanted to.” His admission was a whisper, and he looked down at his hands as he confessed.
She cut him open then, pulled out the ruined pieces of his heart and held them in her hand. Tony wept as she dug into him, slicing flesh away with blades like razors.
“Do you have stuff?” Steve asked, eyes very blue and cheeks slightly flushed. He was the most gorgeous thing Tony had ever seen.
Tony tapped his chin. “Hm, I remember something about that from my research into Norse legends when our big, blond alien friend arrived.”
Tony crossed his arms – a feat in the suit – and stared at Loki. “So what was this all about then?” he asked.
“Tasha.” Clint held out his hand. “Please, I just want to talk to my wife.” He spoke softly, carefully.
Tony crooked his finger at Bucky. “I’m feeling left out,” he pouted. He felt joy bubbling inside him like some sort of feelings volcano.
Bruce does his thing. Steve panics. Tony makes a new friend. Just FYI Jotunheim isn't Earth. Sam is a good bro. Journey to the center of the....realm?
Coulson’s pale eyes met Bucky’s. “It’s because Hydra decided to expand its interests to the supernatural world that S.H.I.E.L.D. had to change strategy.”
Rhodey wrapped an arm around his shoulders. “You okay there, Churchill?” Bruce, Laura and Pepper followed them towards the car where Happy stood waiting.
Bucky laughed. It wasn’t loud and it didn’t last long, but it was a genuine laugh. “Sam’s mind goes straight to sex.”
“Indeed.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. paused. “It would appear, however, that he missed several of them and they are triggered by a particular code.”
“Something happened,” Bruce mused. “Something so bad that you needed to come back and fix it.” He tapped a finger against his mouth while he thought. “Something involving Steve because that is pretty much all you’ve been talking about since I got here.”
Tony pulled off with a lewd pop. “I don’t?” His throat sounded raw and fucked out. His eyes were slumberous and his mouth cherry-red. He was ridiculously beautiful. Steve couldn’t believe that he was here, with him.
Tony shook his head sharply. “You’ve had years to tell me, Cap.” He looked over at Barnes. “If you want some help getting rid of the crazy in your brain, I have something that could help,” he said.
For a moment, the world whited out and Steve couldn’t even remember his name. Bucky’s lips were soft and wet around his dick. It felt as though Steve’s brains were dribbling out of his cock.
There were a few minutes of silence as Bruce read through the amendments of the amendments. He looked up at Tony. “Agreed to no jail-time for the rogue Avengers,” he said.
“We wouldn't do that,” Steve assured her. “It came up already and we dismissed it.” He kept his voice steady and his eyes on her. She was still so volatile, so young, so powerful.
Sam’s mouth curled in a smile. “You mean you’re all psychopathic murderers?” he asked, dimples cutting a devastating line in his cheeks.
Steve held back as the doors closed. He leaned against the railing and watched. Bucky held out a hand. He pulled away from Tony’s mouth just long enough to order, “Come here.”
His words were barely out of his mouth before Steve was on him. Steve kissed him like he did everything in his life. Carefully, considering all angles and conquering.
“We all have red in our ledger, Barnes.” Natasha's voice made them both turn to her. “There are some things that we can never be forgiven for, some acts that can't be atoned for.”
“Well, that was lovely,” Clint said. “Nothing says I miss you like a pissed-off, infinitely powerful being.”
“I sensed a disturbance as we made our way back to Midgard. Who are you, trespasser and how do you dare to have my friend ensorcelled so thoroughly?” Thor’s voice was a dangerous rumble of thunder across the sky.
Bruce had opted to sit this one out, mostly because he had no idea how the Other Guy would react when he hit Hell, but also because someone needed to stay behind. Clint and Natasha had both seemed far too eager to face Old Nick.
Tony decided that hiding out in his workshop slash Bruce’s laboratory for the rest of his life was the better part of valor.
“You have a group of devastated friends who have also lost someone they love,” she said, voice like ice. “They need you to get your ass out of bed and help them grieve.”
He threw his wrists out, calling the armor, or at least a glove with a repulsor to him, but nothing happened. “What have you done to my armor?” He tried not to show how freaked out he was. Apparently, looking at the concern on all of their faces, he wasn’t all that successful.
“I don’t understand.” Peter’s voice was small and afraid, and Steve understood why Tony had taken him under his wing in almost all ways but the legal one.
Steve stared at Tony. “I don’t understand you. You’re so fucking angry at me but you’ll do whatever you can to fix Bucky?”
“More, I cannot tell you.” T’Challa smiled to remove the sting. “But if I can, I will tell you on my return.”
“What does that mean?” he asked. He frowned, a thought striking suddenly. “Are you Atlantis?” He stared at her. “Are you Steve’s Peggy?”
“Trust me, we’ve spent enough time in other dimensions to know what we’re doing,” Dean said. Tony wanted to hear
Her smile widened. “And if I were to tell you of his talks with me as he roams my halls, confessing deep secrets to the only one he trusts to keep them?”
“He’s lost almost everyone he loves.” Bucky’s voice was harder now. “He’s made new friends in this time, but you and me, we’re his family. And in Steve’s mind, family is
Tony put his hand in the small of Steve’s back. “Deep breaths, babe,” he urged. “Think of it like it’s a movie. Not real.” He found it hard to watch, the desperate desolation in all of the faces.
Ross went pale, one hand clenching into a fist. “I’m the US Secretary of State,” he declared. “You cannot hold me hostage!”
“Not…!” Tony yelled as Thor and Vision crashed through his ceiling. “Fuck.” They all stepped into the center of the room and looked up at the gaping hole in the roof. “Goddamn, fucking asshole.”
Sam Wilson had toed off his shoes and was lounging quite comfortably on the sofa. “This is good shit, Tasha,” he told her, waving a shot glass around.
“Making moves on my girl, Cap?” The voice behind him made them spin around. Barton’ grin was huge. “Miss me?”
Sam was beside him in an instant, murmuring reassurances that meant nothing with that circle of metal in his view.
“Don’t start that crap again,” Tony told him, waving that away. “I’ll do what I have to so that you feel safe and loved.
Tony told Vision to put the Serpent Crown in his vault until the exalted Winchesters arrived. Clint had called them already and they were about two hours out according to him. On a job.
Jörmungandr stretched out a hand and a hole appeared in the ground. Liquid bubbled out, dark gold and sweet-smelling. “
“I will give up the Mind Stone,” Vision stepped up beside Tony, touching his shoulder. “That would solve the issue, correct?”
“Nope, not psychic,” he whispered back out of the side of his mouth, never taking his eyes off her. “Psychotic, possibly. Psychopathic, there's evidence...” He trailed off when Natasha met his eyes. “Hey Nat, you look gorgeous in your murderous rage.”
Then Tony. Burning bright, staccato sentences pouring from him as he paced or worked. Tony was the sun around which they all revolved. Steve hadn’t known that until the moment that Pepper had told Tony they would be okay. They would never be okay without him. He just had to find a way to tell him, to show him, to make sure that nothing bad ever happened to Tony again.
“Not by design,” Thor explained. “However, much power is needed for him to escape which is why he is building up his army.”
Steve felt a moment of concern. Wanda was a teammate now. They needed to speak about each other with respect.  Then he looked where Tony was sitting, arms wrapped around his torso like they were the only things holding him together, and wanted to shake the answers out of her.
“You know what?” Tony asked, pulling out a bottle of Bruichladdich and pouring two tumblers full. This was a goddam
“You don’t,” she whispered. “You make me crazy but you don’t make me miserable.” Her fingers twisted in his.
“We have a solution,” Tony corrected. He looked over at Thor and Loki. “Chin up, godlets, we’re about to save your universe.”
Thor nodded and began swinging Mjolnir. “No!” Tony yelled. “Get onto the balcony and catch the Bifröst without breaking my home!”
“That’s not Tony!” Bruce said, almost hysterically. “That’s Steve.” He gave a little wave. “Hey Cap.”
“Should we go and check on him?” Steve’s worried eyes went to the window out back. Tony could just see Clint chopping firewood, Coulson standing close-by, a suited sentinel.
Steve realized that perhaps he hadn’t been too smart as Tony let him go, sitting up on his haunches. He was still fully clothed as he looked down at Steve.
But, dollars to donuts, they were having some sort of silent eyebrow conversation that would just piss Tony off.
“Ross created the Accords under a false premise.” Tony felt the rage welling inside him. “He didn’t want to manage us. He wanted to control us.”
Tony was nervous. It seemed like he was back in the avenging business whether he liked it or not. He frowned. Perhaps it would better to call it the avenging babysitting business, he thought sourly.
“I’m not looking for you to pardon them.” Tony ignored the twinge of agony his words caused. This wasn’t the time for sentimentality. “I’m looking for you to make it better for those of us who believe in the idea behind the Accords.”
“Perhaps,” Tony agreed. He looked at the new schematics of the Mark 25. “Hit me with some Nine Inch Nails, J. I always think better when there's a whole lot of noise around.”
Tony couldn’t even see straight he was so pissed off. Bucky’s hand on his chest made him realize he was almost ready to launch himself at Steve.
“He's a good man.” Steve said. And it was true. Tony was a good man. Beneath the razzle-dazzle of Iron Man, and the Stark genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist mask, Tony was a
"F.R.I.D.A.Y. I swear to god I am rewriting your program in my head right now!” Tony had been betrayed.
“Yeah, not feeling real excited about that,” Bucky drawled. “I prefer to have my feet on the ground.” His heat was a comforting line behind Tony. For a moment, he forgot.
“Well, let’s be real,” Tony said, strolling alongside an ice-blue giant in a tunnel to the center of an alien world, “Loki’s a special kind of crazy.”
“J, tell Captain Nanny, that I am a goddamn genius, and am fully capable of winning this fucking fight!” Tony glowered at Steve; the effect somewhat weakened by the dark bruise flaring up on his cheekbone.
Of course Tony beat them home. He strolled across the landing, letting F.R.I.D.A.Y. remove the suit from him.
“You’re not the monster you believe you are, Tony.” And there was the Phil that Clint finally fell in love with, Tony thought. Later though. Much later.
“Stop pretending you didn’t spot the use of past tense,” Tony said. “Safe to say that isn’t the case anymore.”
“You okay there, sir?” Tony looked over at the President, faceplate slipping up. The nod he got in reply wasn’t exactly a ringing affirmation.
Tony waggled his hand when it seemed as though that was it. “Eh, I give it two out of ten for actually motivating anyone.”
“Wait!” he said. “I need help to understand.” He tapped the communicator in his ear. “Clint, you got a moment?”
Tony patted Nate’s back, appreciating the heavy warmth of a child as he thought how to answer her. “He’s your husband.”
“That would be great.” Steve’s eyes shone. “I didn’t think I’d get a chance to be happy in this world.”
“Not much,” Coulson shrugged. “Director Fury spoke about them as benevolent and unwilling to intervene. Apparently we fuck things up in the future.”
Rhodey nudged him with a pointy elbow. “Of course you will,” he grinned. “You’re Tony fucking Stark.”
Clint leaned forward, reaching out to touch his feet as he extended his arms. “That she is, my friend,” he agreed. “That she is.” He yelped when Natasha yanked on his hair. “And I worship the ground you walk on, my goddess.”
“Because they can?” Rhodey suggested. He shifted on his seat, the braces making a hissing noise. “I mean, this
Tony pulled out his tablet. Here, in this place where creation and devastation met, he wasn’t entirely sure what he was doing, so science would have to be his lodestone.
Bruce sighed. “I’m going to be perfectly honest with you, Steve. I just don’t know.” The machine suddenly switched off and Bucky slumped over. Steve lurched forward to catch him before he fell.
Fury rubbed the spot where the skin wrinkled between his eyes that Tony privately thought of as his ‘Why the Fuck do I have to Deal with this Shit?’ spot. “The Winchesters have their battle and the Avengers have theirs, Stark.” He sounded like he was clenching his jaw.
“I don’t think I’m needed here right now,” Laura said, pushing away from the table. “I’m going to check up on the kids and answer some mails.” She put a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “You good?”
Tony’s smile was a little bittersweet. “While I know that those memories have saved us many times over, is it selfish of me to admit that I’m happy that the other Tony isn’t around as much?”
“Can you please focus?” Steve begged, using his shield to hack at the tentacle that had wrapped itself around his wrist.
“But you look so pretty in your red velvet suit, baby.” Tony made a kissy-face at him. “The green tie just brings out the color of your eyes.”
“Crowley’s the King of Hell and he’s a douchebag,” Dean said. “He’s not going to stop us from keeping Lucifer in the Cage.”
“I wasn’t just sulking in my rooms when I came back to New York, you know,” Tony told them. “I was actually making some major adjustments to my suit.”
“Ah! You are awake!” Thor’s booming voice had Steve wincing. Loki looked disheveled, but there was color in his face, and Steve really wasn’t going to think about the cause.
“Fuckers,” Tony muttered as he headed to the bathroom. He’d already traumatized Bruce enough for a lifetime; the least he could do was clean the jizz off his body.
The lack of judgment in his tone had Dean smiling a little at him. “Thanks,” Dean whispered. “A good night’s rest might be just what we need. Clear heads and all that shit.”
Pepper stood up suddenly. “I’ve got to leave. There are so very many things I still need to say to some of you, but I have a company to run and, no matter what Tony believes, it doesn’t happen by itself.”
Thor looked put out. “My rooms are no more opulent than yours,” he protested. “In fact, I am quite sure that yours are the most garish in the palace!”
Tony sank back down onto the bed. “Two years,” he breathed. “It’s two years in the past.” He dug his fingers into the corners of his eyes. “What the hell is going on?”
this. So Tony figured this was all a lesson for the dude staring a hole into his skull opposite him.
He blew out a breath. “I perfected it all before the shit hit the fan. Got my goodbye. It didn’t change anything. What happened, happened and I never saw them again.” This confession session was getting maudlin and Tony shook himself. “So, I decided that the technology could be adjusted and used to help people like me.” He glanced at Bruce. “Like Bruce.”
“What?” Tony was appalled. “Don’t you dare give me any power of you, asshole. I’m not your keeper!” The thought terrified him.
He slumped back then, letting them do what they wanted to him. He closed his eyes and allowed the dual stimulation of his dick and his mouth to overwhelm him.
“You fucking dickhead!” Clint spun to glare at Tony. “How many fucking times have we told you not to fucking touch any fucking thing you don’t have a fucking clue about?”
“Because one of the best friends I have, one of the best people I know is standing in front of the world, practically alone, and making a declaration that you’re too fucking stubborn to hear!” Natasha was practically shouting at him at the end. This time it was Clint who put a cautioning hand on her arm.
“Remember, we can’t kill it,” Natasha said, appearing a little putout. “I really don’t want to deal with Tony being even more pissed off at me than he is already going to be.”
She arched an eyebrow. “I am the only woman living currently who knows how bad you are at kissing, Cap. I’d keep the insults to zero if I were you.”
Steve shook Dean’s hand. “Thank you.” He did sincerity like breathing. “Clint is right. We owe you.’
This story is eating my life. The only good thing is that work is quiet so I'm getting a lot of writing in. Thanks for your encouragement, comments & kudos. I don't get a chance to reply (because writing) but I read them & re-read them when my muse goes on strike.
When Bruce came to discussing Johannesburg, he swallowed hard but continued, talking in shorter, sharper sentences that spoke volumes as to his grip on the Hulk.
“Peeeeppppp…” Tony reverted to whining when Pepper got that intractable look in her eyes. “But Bruce…”
Bucky got to his feet. “It’s not the kid’s fault.” He clenched his fists. “He’s not had any other choice.”
“Thank you,” he murmured. It was so soft that nobody else heard him. Peggy pulsed against him, her energy calming him as he watched Bruce examine Tony.
each other. Bucky and Steve moved like Sam and Dean, constantly aware of each other. It was beautiful and terrifying and they were his.
Thor, as big and brawny as he was, was looking mildly terrified as he struggled to hold on to Matilda. “Your assistance would be most appreciated, friend Clinton,” he said as the animal swiped at him with vicious claws.
Vision nodded, heading for the elevator with Bruce. “I’ve learned over time that usually, when Tony is this confident, that he’s right.”
Bucky leaned into the touch, a tiny thing that made Steve almost giddy with joy. “I’m not going to give it up without a fight,” he said. “Even if I don’t deserve it, I’d kill to keep this.”
Peggy crooned to him as she lit up the corridor once more, the sound of a single note following them to the laboratory next to the infirmary.
“Because if he gets out, the next step is world domination and making everyone into demons and then you’re shit out of a job,” Dean said, getting to his feet too. “Capisce?”
“Apart from several animal life-forms, there is nothing of consequence, sir.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. didn't call him on it. It wasn't like he'd been expecting Bruce to come wandering out of the woods with his arms open, singing Koombaya.
Steve glanced over, stared at Bucky’s profile. “Since they woke me up from the ice, he’s pretty much been my best friend.” He gave a low laugh. “Once we got past all the asshole posturing of course.” And it hadn’t only been Tony who’d been an asshole, Steve thought. He’d been a dick too.
Or maybe it was because he could see the reflection of whoever walked in to his fiefdom in his semi-artificially intelligent toaster.
Bruce tells his story (with a little help from his friends). The rebels in Wakanda have a 'difference' of opinion. Several of them. Natasha airs a few grievances.
The sound of something huge crashing outside the Sanctum had them all rushing towards the door. There were people screaming and running and debris flying in the air.
lost,” Steve said, his arms tight around Tony. Whatever else had happened, this fight, this war, had brought them some sort of connection once more. They had fought, given it their all. Together.
