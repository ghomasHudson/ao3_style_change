Sherlock looked almost guilty for a moment, suddenly realizing how uncomfortable his Omega looked standing up. He'd been so focused protecting John from possible threats that he hadn't realized his mate was becoming worn out from their excursion. "Of course," he answered, blushing as he led John to the cafe. His instincts wanted to carry his Omega there, to relieve the ache in John's back and feet, but the act would mean dropping the rather large load of shopping bags he held. Rationality won out, and soon he was helping his very pregnant mate into a chair at a table for two. "Shall I order for you?" he asked; the register wasn't too far away. He could keep an eye on his Omega and go to retrieve something for both of them without too much worry.
, he warned softly, clinging to his mate more strongly to make it clear he had no intention of stopping the kiss despite his legs turning to jelly.
Sherlock bit his lip as he glanced over at the scene on the swing, before responding to Eastlake. "Only a few months," he managed before another luxurious moan, louder now, escaped his lips. "He's an exceptionally quick... nnnnnnh... learner." Hips snapping forward, the young Alpha began panting as he spoke, pleasure pooling steadily between his legs. "The second time I collared him, I... knotted his mouth... He took it perfectly..."
Sherlock's eyes darkened, his pulse quickening. He moved to grasp the Omega's hips, aiding the John's endeavor to press closer. Moaning lowly, the Alpha returned his mate's affection, accepting all that John offered. The feelings of dominance and pride that swelled and grew inside his heart this time were far more tempered, more loving. One hand slid down into the inviting heat between his Omega's legs. Sherlock growled. John was dripping, and the sensation of his fingers pressing against the Omega's soaked, ready entrance was the last indication he needed to move forward. Fierce love and desire flooded the bond as the Alpha sank his teeth deep into the bondmark, breaking the skin in one swift motion. He pressed his fingers up into John, panting, as their scents blossomed and deepened, moving them in slow circles to his mate's low moaning.
Mycroft blinked and backed away, dropping his gaze and his head a little in deference to Sherlock. He offered a rather strained smile to the Omega in return, his cold eyes betraying his inward scowl. "Indeed, though I think you can hardly expect children from my brother. He's really not the family type, I'm afraid." He shook his head as if to give his condolences.
"Surprise me," John yawned contentedly, "you've got a much better eye for that sort of thing than I do. Besides... it'll be good for winter, you know, when my bondbite is covered by a scarf or a high coat collar... a leather collar would still be visible at the front, let everyone know I've been claimed... Purely from a practical point of view, you know... Mmm" he hummed agreeably as he began to drift off, the scent from Sherlock's chest soothing and relaxing him. He felt utterly secure, wrapped so tightly in his mate's arms, and had no qualms about allowing his Alpha to collar him; he knew that Sherlock would always respect the boundaries he set, and wanted to give this to his mate, the reassurance of surrendering to him wholly, completely soothing and satisfying his inner Alpha. The man had suppressed his instincts for so long around John, never once attempting to bond with him or asking to share his heat, giving him space despite the instinct that must have been screaming at him to bite, to claim, to own; now, it was time for his patience to be rewarded, to be allowed to possess his Omega utterly, to show off his breeder in front of other Alphas and be acknowledged as one of the finest among them.
Suddenly, the chatter stopped, as if a blast of ice had passed over the room. A beat later, the surreptitious whispers started. "
"God- look... John-," he'd bit back the word 'mate'; it was too much, "I'm really sorry about what happened. I should have known better- I
Sherlock inhaled sharply, looking to the pup that could have been John's double in miniature. He set down a gleeful Enora, who was more engrossed in the squashiness of her blue foam block than in her father's attentions. "Mama," Blake whined as Sherlock lifted him. He kicked his legs unhappily at his Alpha parent, beginning to fuss more loudly.
John felt an odd sense of pride as his Alpha marked the challenger, feeling Sherlock's dominance. He sank eagerly into his Alpha's arms, crooning and humming, turning his face up for Sherlock to claim, pressing his bump into Sherlock's flat stomach. He was only vaguely aware that his Alpha was talking and whined in agreement to whatever it was he was saying.
," he punctuated each word, "are allowed to come." His hands held John's hips tightly as he thrust in with exact control. "Look at what I've done to you," he murmured as his mate whined and tried to push back needily, "So gorgeous like this, such an animal." He'd give John what he wanted if the Omega begged, but the Alpha desperately wanted to see how far they could push things.
Remington sat stiff as John pet him, his eyes narrowed in thought. His uncertainty had been replaced by sadness, then by anger as John had continued to speak. "Y-you make it s-sound so e-e-
"Houses?" John reminded Sherlock gently, storing the scanner neatly away in the corner. They'd need as much time as possible, he thought grimly, faced with the task of finding a suitable house in the right location and adapting it to hold their massive brood.
John knew exactly what Sherlock was doing to himself and the image made his mouth water. He crawled off the bed and towards the door, shaking, reaching for his handcuffs. If he could handcuff himself to something in his room, he'd be safe. "If you don't order me to stay I might not be able to stop myself coming out... and then you'll fuck me, and then you'll hate me," he called, trying not to rut against the carpet, knowing his increasing arousal would only spur Sherlock on.
"It seems as if you have it all figured out, then," Sherlock purred, petting her dark hair. "What about you, Felix?" he asked, looking at the little boy on his chest. Comfortable in the knowledge that his father would live, Felix had released his death grip on Sherlock's shirt, though one hand still held the fabric loosely.
The registrar looked sympathetically at the pale Alpha, fidgeting and shifting from foot to foot as he waited. Lestrade leaned in and whispered something intended to be comforting in his ear and was met with a withering glare, so gave up and clasped his hands with a sigh, flicking his eyes to the door before scanning the assembled guests. Molly was seated next to Mrs Hudson, chattering excitedly; Mycroft was next to his and Sherlock's mother, the woman still pale and meek but managing to keep her eyes off the floor, a beautiful necklace of diamonds and sapphires in place of the collar she was used to.
"Mine," Sherlock rumbled affectionately, placing a soft kiss just under the line of his mate's jaw. The shower spray pattered down lightly against his back, his thick curls already growing damp and loose once more. The Alpha had opened the lowest overflow drains of the tub; no matter how long they ran the shower, the shallow bath would not grow any deeper than what was safe for the babies. Holding his mate in his lap, he looked on with an enormous grin as John played with their babies, listening to the sounds of his family's laughter echoing lightly off the tiled walls.
. He sauntered over, waddling very slightly thanks to his massive belly, and slid into the booth beside Sherlock since the other Alpha was blocking his side. He purred as Sherlock gave a low growl and splayed his hand possessively over the mound of his stomach, scenting and marking him. He could tell that Sherlock was agitated so he waited to be introduced, rather than making the first approach to the stranger, who looked beyond shocked. "This must be your mate, then?" the other Alpha was saying, eyes trailing over John's obvious pregnancy with an incredulous expression, mouth hanging slightly open.
" He wouldn't kill the man in his nest, no - the room where they shared their love, where their pups would be born and cared for, would not be soiled by such an act. He would, however, give himself one more satisfaction - give his mate one more act of reassurance - before dragging Moriarty out for the final act.
It took every ounce of Sherlock's self-control not to tear off John's shirt right there. Instead, the Alpha growled quietly again, beginning to subtly rub increasingly firm circles over the nub that now strained against the fabric of the Omega's shirt. He licked his lips when he noted John's flushed cheeks and erected nipples, the twin beads obvious underneath the plum garment. "Two options," Sherlock murmured, "I pay the bill now, and walk you out in front of everybody - just like this. Ripe, full, so obviously
Tears began to well in John's eyes at the exquisite pleasure, Sherlock's thick cock rubbing over his prostate again and again, leaving him quivering on the edge, but not wanting to come just yet.
Sherlock awoke naturally early the next morning. John was still tucked safely against him - or rather, half-underneath him, as he'd instinctively shifted in his slumber to protectively sprawl over his gravid mate. Carefully, quietly, the Alpha disentangled himself from limbs and sheets, pressing light kisses to John's cheek and belly before pulling the covers over his Omega and padding to the kitchen to begin their breakfast. There was still time yet before they were scheduled to see their first house of the day, and John and the pups needed as much rest as they could get.
"This is manipulative," Sherlock grumbled, subdued. He looked at his steadfast mate, and knew that he was fighting a losing battle. "No, I don't need anything from home," he said with a resigned sigh. "I don't suppose someone has a story handy for Charlotte, though? I've been told I'm not allowed to look at books for too long, and you know how horrible I am at making them up."
Sherlock's brow had furrowed in concern as his mate labored; John was obviously suffering with this child. He could feel his mate's distress through their bond, and his hands trailed away from John's belly and down between the Omega's legs. The Alpha sat back on his heels as he gently felt around John's hole, helping to ease the tender flesh open. The problem became apparent immediately: the baby was breech. Sherlock eased his fingers more inside John's entrance, feeling. Mercifully, the pup seemed to be a frank breech, with its feet near to its head.
owned in the most intimate way, claimed and dominated. As instinct fogged his mind, the wholly primal part of his brain took over, and suddenly being on his hands and knees didn't seem right. Slowly, he bent his elbows, sinking to rest on his forearms, his face pressed into the blankets, the most utterly submissive position possible; it allowed his Alpha deeper access, tilting his hips to ensure the Alpha's seed would reach his womb if he was being bred, and anchored him better, letting him brace against the rough pounding and push back a little harder. He could do nothing but groan, long and low, as he was used, eyes rolling up in his skull at the feeling of Sherlock's enormous cock penetrating him deeply.
he whispered, the hand on John's belly lightly increasing the pressure as he rubbed the swollen mound.
Molly piped up from across the table, grinning and holding out her cracker. "You haven't got a crown, John!" He smiled back and reached for the other end, his smile broadening as he came away victorious and earned a golden yellow crown. He pulled it onto his head, sharing a fond smile with his mate before starting to eat, his appetite returning. He couldn't help but glance around the table; Lestrade was happily discussing bizarre murders with Molly and Mrs Hudson was chattering obliviously to Mycroft, asking when he was going to bond and have pups of his own, completely missing the odd look on the Alpha's face.
"Goodness! What kind of aeroplane would you like to be?" Sherlock asked earnestly. "A great big one!" Enora replied, her eyes bright with enthusiasm. John's feelings sang through their bond and enveloped him as well, and he gathered his mate closer.
John nearly screamed with pleasure as his Alpha came in him, his eyes fluttering shut as he felt the huge cock inside him pulse and jerk. "I love being so full of your pups, it feels wonderful... knowing how much you love me, knowing you gave me the honour of carrying your children... allowing me to have so many... makes me feel special... I love how they make my belly curve out, huge and round... ohhhhh god, please Sir, please can I come?" he begged desperately, still riding Sherlock as if his life depended on it, achingly close, but so lost to his Omega that he needed permission now. He wasn't even sure he knew his Alpha's name any more, never mind his own; all he knew for certain was that the Alpha he was riding was his mate, had stuffed his belly full of pups, loved him, loved their babies, and had left a pure and deep bondbite on his neck. He was operating at the most basic instinctual level, much as he would when the birth got closer - later, when John thought about it, he'd realise he probably wouldn't say
you, always want you with me, love being full of your babies, carrying the weight of them around in my womb... God, I could get addicted to having your babies..." He breathed deeply, calming himself. "We've never really... talked about it. What you got up to while you were away. Will you tell me now?" he asked gently, rubbing his monstrous belly as he nuzzled his Alpha's hair.
to eat more just by being around his Omega. Sherlock had let his belt out two notches since they moved into the house; he wouldn't keep gaining, certainly, but it was something of significance. His cheekbones no longer stood so sharply prominent on his face, and a soft glow of health had replaced his previous pallor. He watched with a fond smile as John served and cut his food, rewarding his heavy mate with a sweet kiss to the cheek.
John mewed softly, tilting his head as best he could to reach his Alpha's jaw, lapping submissively, as if to ask
"He is, don't worry," John smirked. "We'll do it however you want, love. But please can I at least have a dark suit? Then if I leak milk it won't show up as badly... We'll have to set aside a time after the ceremony for us to go into a private room so you can milk me, or I will
talking about feelings - we're not talking about guilt or betrayal or anger or hurt or sorrow or affection. This is a sit rep. A de-brief. This is so we all know where we stand, we're talking about our pack and status and security. I know I'm more secure in my Omega, more secure around the three of you. The bonds are stronger, warmer." John was clearly in his element; his military training left him entirely in his comfort zone, as if they were talking over the results of a difficult mission. "Greg, you next," John prompted, earning a surprised eyebrow raise from the DCI; as the pack Alpha's younger brother Sherlock was technically next in the pack hierarchy, despite the fact that he was younger than Lestrade, but John knew that Sherlock would be more comfortable speaking last and wanted to spare his mate as much discomfort as he could.
As soon as John began coming, Sherlock began working the Omega's small cock more firmly, one hand firmly pressing their bodies together to draw out John's orgasm at his own pace as the other quickly pumped the Omega's member, keeping John torn between the two pleasures as he released. He growled with satisfaction as the Omega screamed and arched his back, thrusting faster as John came down from the high, spurring himself on to his own climax. His hands moved to splay over John's full belly, rubbing greedily and possessively over the heavy, gravid mound as John began to cry out breathily again, already at the cusp of a second orgasm. With a soft cry and a low groan of his own, he began spilling inside his mate, trying to keep some semblance of pace as he rode out his own release.
The tag on John's new collar clinked as he staggered behind Sherlock to the exquisitely decorated bathroom, almost cooing in pleasure when he saw the large oval corner bath and the enormous shower enclosure with its delicately frosted glass. Every surface shone, the marble gleaming and the glass sparkling; there was a large mahogany shelf stocked with high-end soaps and shampoos for the occupants to use within easy reach of the shower and a rack of warmed, plush towels by the door as well as luxurious white dressing gowns and slippers embroidered with the club logo hanging neatly side by side. John thought to himself that it was the most expensive room he'd ever been in - it was easily grander than a five-star hotel, but with the addition of a large range of sex toys placed artfully throughout the room.
Tears streamed down Sherlock's face as he scooped Iris, plush toy and all, into his free arm. "We can go later today..," he promised, answering the pup as easily as if he were reading her mind, "I promise.. I'll let you see the bees for Christmas..." They'd be hard-pressed to find a bee outdoors this time of year, but Sherlock had been cultivating a few active hives in his lab. He showered his daughters' faces with kisses, neglecting his own meal in favour of the two babies, keeping Imogen cozily close as he whispered about bees to Iris and her toy.
and no other Alpha was good enough," he whispered into his skin, rapidly falling asleep, impatient for tomorrow.
Sherlock rumbled deeply, massaging his seed into the Omega's taut skin. He kissed the next long moan gently from John's mouth, his touches to his middle growing more firm as he tested his mate's response. The Alpha purred lowly, observing his mate with hungry eyes as he stowed each reaction in his memory for future reference.
Sherlock's brow knitted in confusion at the statement, "Why would that be a bad thing?" he questioned, "With thirteen children, it's only natural and healthy that you'll need to put on quite a lot of weight for your body to cope and keep them healthy." He could sense his Omega's discomfort, but didn't quite understand the reason behind it - why shouldn't John want to get fat? He tilted the man's head up to look at him, "Tell me, why does the idea upset you so?"
full..," he affirmed lowly. "You're going to whelp so well for me." His hands moved around John's middle, gently palpitating the lowest curve of his ripe belly. "My, they might even be larger than yesterday," he grinned, his satisfaction growing as John's breathing continued to deepen and grow more strained. He whispered sweet nothings and reassurances to his partner, placing kisses on John's bare skin to distract him as he dilated.
He was vibrating with pride a little, the Omega's fawning making him feel more confident in his decision. Carefully, he pushed aside the twine keeping the upper and lower parts of the parcel secured together, and lifted the lid of the box.
," he purred, stroking a hand through John's hair. "My perfect Omega... You have been amazing this Christmas." He tilted John's head up to look at him, and regretted the light scolding about showing affection.
As soon as he felt his Omega clenching around him, Mycroft felt his whole body go taut with pleasure as his orgasm overwhelmed him. He groaned and flexed his hips helplessly, pulling Persephone closer to him while he spent inside her in strong pulses. "Oh, my love, my sweet darling, my treasure... Oh, I adore you," the Alpha moaned, nuzzling his Omega's bondbite in the afterglow. "So plump and pretty, filled with my children..." He groped her full belly reverently, humming in approval and satisfaction, then slid his hand up to her chest to stroke her nipples. "I think I'll have to milk you soon, won't I my dear? Should I have you on the pumps, perhaps? Should I suckle from you? Or should I milk you by hand?" He smiled, dropping soft kisses across his wife's bondbite.
, his mind repeated, this Omega who smelled of him, who carried his litter and bore his mark. He growled in deep pride and approval. "You're mine," he whispered softly, losing the battle as his hand returned to John's belly, slowly pushing up the rich black silk to reveal his mate's enormous womb.
Mycroft blinked, his gaze snapping back to Felix. The little Omega had spoken quietly but decisively; it was as if he knew that the grown-ups were asking for what they wanted and he had decided to join in. "
Emily smiled and granted him mercy, sliding the rest of her cock into him in one fluid motion. "There, that's what you wanted, isn't it? Mmm, yes, that's better, now your greedy little pussy is full of cock." She spanked him lightly as she began to move, thrusting smoothly and quickly. "Christ, you're so wet. Come on baby, you want to give us a nice big mixed litter, don't you? Drop an egg for me, sweetheart," she growled, the other Alphas of the pack stroking themselves more firmly.
John bit back a gasp and flushed scarlet, pulling his jacket closed in front of his gaping shirt. "That settles it. No more wearing pre-pups clothes," he breathed quietly, seeing the odd look on his Alpha's face. "But you love this, don't you? You love how big you've made me, swollen with milk and your pups, too big for my old clothes..." He retrieved the button, deliberately skimming his fingers across his mate's crotch. "You'd have me swell again, even though the tailor will already be tearing his hair out trying to work out how big I'll be in February... You'd love to see me on my hands and knees, using electric breast pumps to drain all of my milk, on them constantly, being milked like an animal..." He licked his lips and smiled as the taxi pulled up outside Baker Street. He sauntered inside, stripping once he was in the living room. "I need a shower... That gel always makes my belly sticky. Want to join me? Maybe fuck me from behind as you milk me, watch it spray out of me and run down the shower wall?" he purred, rubbing his breasts, his nipples rising ready to be suckled, rosy and plump, his breasts swollen to the size of grapefruits rather than his usual apple-sized mounds.
it when you get all Alpha, and pin me down, and growl about how you're going to make me take your cock, how you'll keep me constantly fat with your pups. So I'm doing it for both of us. For all of us. Because I want to, because of all the years we wasted." He ran his fingertips lightly through Sherlock's dusting of chest hair. "They won't replace the ones we missed," he added quietly.
, love," he murmured. "I am sickeningly proud of you." The lights dimmed and the play began, but John kept gazing at his new husband and couldn't resist leaning in for a kiss. The pups started kicking, demanding their father's attention, and John chuckled as he broke the kiss. "You were right, they are demanding," he breathed softly, humming lightly as they calmed under Sherlock's hands. He turned his attention back to the play, where a man dressed as a chef was wringing his hands nervously and explaining to the audience how a famous actress staying at the hotel had been brutally stabbed with one of his knives while he was in the walk-in freezer. More characters joined him on stage; the victim's PA, the manager of the hotel, the woman's understudy for her role as Ophelia, a chambermaid and the sous-chef who found the body. John watched happily for a few minutes while they argued and accused, before shifting uncomfortably in his seat and leaning over to whisper to his mate. "I need it, Sherlock," he whispered darkly, licking his lips. "I need to be milked."
Sherlock kept a firm hold on their child - a son, he noticed, as he lifted him from between John's legs. He tended to him with tender efficiency, the pup protesting with forceful, petulant squalls as Sherlock rubbed him down. "Hush now, my love. You'll be clean and warm again in no-" The Alpha paused, the cloth held still on the baby's bum. His enormous, proud grin grew wider in amusement and wonder. "John," he giggled joyfully, suddenly hurrying to finish. Sherlock pulled a cap neatly over his son's shock of straight black hair, and shuffled closer to his Omega. "Look," he whispered, their new baby cradled in one arm, Sherlock's other hand pointing proudly at the pup's backside, where a small, brown birthmark graced his left cheek.
. You have made me calm... I'm John again, I was just Omega when we left Scotland Yard," he murmured. "I definitely feel marked, too. Thank you, love. You always know what I need." He kissed his mate sweetly. "Nobody could
His sobbing lessened as his mate's scent covered him once more, all traces of the other Omega on his skin obliterated. John fidgeted, still able to smell him in their nest. The fabric smelled all wrong, it wasn't
. Captain John Watson would have stood his ground and fought - and he'd have won easily - but now he was just Sherlock's pregnant Omega and the decision to stand behind Sherlock and rely on him for protection had been instinctual and absolute. Everything had changed, and he wouldn't change it back for the world, but he was more than a little overwhelmed by what he was feeling, able to let himself feel because his Alpha had knotted and claimed him. Now that the sex frenzy had passed his lips were beginning to sting where they bled, which added a little extra pain to his weeping, kissing his Alpha's neck sweetly and tenderly. "Sher.... Sherlock... I was so scared... for the pups," he sobbed, "I didn't even know what to do except move behind you. I was a Captain in the army, if that had been a battle I'd have been killed, why couldn't I think of what to do, how to fight? Why did I run?" he choked out brokenly, feeling like a coward, he'd moved out of the way to let someone else defend him and their pups.
John emerged from his burrow of Sherlock's shoulder as he recognised the scent of his pack Alpha and clung to Sherlock, mewling loudly for attention.
"Mmm, yes, I think you might... My body will have to adjust to breastfeeding so maybe you should nurse from me until they get here... After all, it is your right as my Alpha," he purred. "You can claim the right to nurse me as often as you want... For once the traditions of an Alpha/Omega relationship seem pretty enticing. They'll be big enough to squeeze in your hands in two or three weeks," he said huskily, leaning in to Sherlock's touches. "We'll need a double electric breast pump so both can be milked at the same time..."
Thr Baker Street Dozen is complete, but we’re continuing the series with The Baker Street Pack. The Baker Street Pack is a compilation of events in the lives of the Holmes pack. You can find it here:  https://archiveofourown.org/works/14129502/chapters/32560521
Sherlock looked up at John and gave a small nod, his eyes wide and trusting. He latched off just enough to turn his head, peeking at the doctor from the pillow of John's breasts. "Yes," he replied, "Hit my head several times... During cases. Had other concussions. Most recent was seven years ago."
protective and possessive, but he knew from experience that some doctors ignored patients' requests to give their own advice if they felt it necessary. He placed a soothing hand on his Alpha's arm, squeezing lightly, before moving his mate's hands to rest on the swell of his belly, pushing his shirt up and out of the way so Sherlock could cup the bump with skin-to-skin contact.
The Beta pressed a series of buttons and a printer in the back of the room jumped to life. Thirteen little black and white scans rolled off the press, each marked with the date, the name of the hospital and Watson/Holmes. Dr Anderson scooped them up and presented them to the Alpha deferentially. "I'm supposed to charge you for these, but... I am ashamed of my half-cousin. I wish to make whatever atonement I can to remove the stain on my family's name, so consider these a gift, and if there is anything at all I can do for you, call me." He offered his card.
He inhaled the scent of John's assuredness, of his Omega's utter faith in him, and growled, rewarding his mate with more nips and kisses, with harder thrusts that increased the already constant pressure on his prostate. He wanted John to have eyes only for him, needed his Omega to know that he was superior to every other Alpha they'd seen that day. He would give John the largest, fattest litters, would keep the Omega constantly heavy with children and with the food he provided for him, would lavish him with attention and rewards for his confidence and admiration. He was the best protector, the best provider, the only one who could bring his mate this much pleasure; with each powerful thrust, he willed the thoughts and feelings through the bond.
Beatrice sighed as she entered the room with several bottles; calming down a hoard of upset grandchildren who wanted nothing but their parents was a task the elderly Omega excelled in, but she rather enjoyed them happy and healthy from the beginning of her watch. Setting aside the tray, she picked up a loudly sobbing Iris. "Now, my sweet," she cooed, rocking the child. "It's not so bad. You get to have a lovely time with Nana and your aunties and uncles instead. Mummy and Daddy will be back, but we'll have fun with your toys and a bath and some treats in the meantime, hmm?"
as well. It makes you begging for my mouth and my cock like this all the sweeter," Sherlock hummed, trailing kisses down John's chest before latching onto a swollen nipple. "Christ, you're so full," he murmured deeply after taking a few long pulls, "I've just milked you, and you're already so heavy with more for me. You're going to grow so fast if you keep producing it like this, my Omega." He rocked gently inside John as he nursed, rubbing his knot across his mate's prostate and taking his small cock in his hand to stroke in time with his drinking, encouraging him to come.
Lestrade swore loudly, leaning on his horn as yet another motorist decided to ignore the blaring sirens, swerving to avoid them without ever taking his foot off the accelerator. "Nearly there, mate, just hold on," he growled, eyes fixed on the road as he tried to reassure the other Alpha.
Sherlock's eyes grew dark with arousal as the Omega's belly heaved lightly under his hand. He moved to tease John's half-inverted navel with his thumb; the nub had never quite popped back in after the birth, standing as a small, prominent monument to John's previous pregnancy. Encouraging his mate to spread his legs more, the Alpha moved to kneel between them, bringing a knee gently to John's groin. He slid his leg slowly against John's small, erect cock, giving the eager Omega more friction, his pulse quickening at the sight before him. His huge member was obscenely hard, and as he rocked forward he rubbed it against the Omega's inner thigh, smearing precome along the soft skin.
"If only," Sherlock groaned, "but I never considered the possibility until this moment...." He hummed thoughtfully, beginning to purr as he thought of it in earnest. "I'm huge, John - I was already larger than the size of an average male Alpha before we began, and I'm far, far bigger now... But in subspace ... In subspace you could certainly take me, though it won't be easy... You could take anything I asked for, almost..." He massaged more of the come and breast milk into John's belly, making sure to get every inch of skin. He wished he could take his Omega out in public like this, he thought with a smirk, half-naked and covered in his seed... His eyes widened a little as he remembered the Pendleton's, his mind suddenly lighting with all he could make John do there, in full view of the clientele...
Sherlock groaned loudly at a sudden realization. "Well," the Alpha admitted, his cheeks blushing a dark, embarrassed red, "If... if Mrs Hudson has been home through any of this, then perhaps we should inform her a bit more formally. If she has not already guessed, we'll need to tell her that we'll be looking for more space soon enough..."
Sherlock smirked back at his mate, sitting up on the bed again as he tried to decide what to do with the Omega. John's desires were more obvious; it didn't take a genius to observe John practically salivating for his Alpha's cock as he'd removed Sherlock's trousers and pants. Sherlock stroked John's hair in reward as he decided, earning him purrs and mewls of gratitude in return. After a moment of thought, he had it. He leaned back against the headboard, tugging at the leash for John to come, manoeuvring his mate until John had straddled his muscular thighs, the Alpha's enormous erection bobbing proudly against his belly.
"Soon they'll know it by the size of your belly, as well" Sherlock growled, "It will be so obvious - they'll see how big you are and scent me on you at the same time. They'll all know how much you are mine." The Alpha's hands wandered down across his Omega's breasts, pinching and rolling his swollen nipples between his fingers. "I was more worried that you would fall ill, or that some harm would come to you," he murmured, "I know you do not take Alpha patients, but there was always the possibility you would pass one in the waiting room, or one would brush against you on the street." His enormous cock was leaking heavily, but he slid his fingers down into the Omega's entrance first, feeling its tight heat around him and running his thumb around the ring of sensitive skin.
whether this or that plate is one centimeter up or down or sideways-," Sherlock quirked an eyebrow in faint amusement at the phrasing, "But it does to you, because it's for him."
The Omega's jaw dropped as his mate staggered into the nest with the cake; the sheer size of the box meant a
Tears fell freely down the Alpha's face. He knew John could have had his pick of anyone he chose, had he wanted them - it was no secret that he was a very desirable Omega: healthy, nurturing, fertile. Sherlock was sure that he could've found someone to breed him well in his younger years, and now that he was older, he would be seen as a fitting partner for an Alpha who wanted a stable mate still capable of providing several litters. Even if he had not wanted to bond, he would have had a wide pool of Alphas to choose from during his heats, those who were just looking for a brief fling with an eager Omega. But yet he had waited, had ignored the urges of his biological clock - and, up until their first mating, suffered through the pain of full-blown heats without fulfilment - just because of Sherlock. The Alpha had no doubt that his mate would have kept on waiting, too - even if they never coupled, even if Sherlock would never have given him children - John would never have been able to stay with anyone else for long. Sherlock had never, in the course of his life, known anyone who loved him so ardently, so completely; it was almost overwhelming. He breathed deeply into the Omega's jumper, trying to steady himself, nearly sobbing as he watched all their pups moving at once inside John's round belly. Fierce love bloomed within him and he rubbed his hands over the sides of the swell, beginning to kiss along John's neck. His breath caught at the Omega's admission. "We can find a way," he muttered sincerely, "If you mean it, we can find some way-"
John snorted into his hot chocolate at the sight of the tiny ear hats, sharing a cheeky grin with Lestrade. "Oh come on, they're adorable," he murmured, reaching out to stroke one. "Cheers Greg, really." He looked at his mate, his soft smile reassuring; he could feel the uncertainty through the bond and pushed back a mixture of pride and love, remembering that they planned to honour the inspector by using his name for the middle name of their first born son. Mycroft had wisely chosen that moment to offer Molly another drink and smile at her, a genuine smile that reached his eyes, so the pathologist was happily blushing and staring at her brandy, not distraught at having Sherlock's domesticity thrust into her face.
Sherlock sighed. If he hadn't been there, hadn't heard John's words to the other Alphas, he would be eagerly taking his reward, indulging them in John's every suggestion. It might have taken him time to warm to it at first, as confirming the bonds and its reminder of the way he wronged John was difficult, but he could have come round with a little coaxing. Now, he felt mired in his depression.
Mycroft chuckled as Alistair purred happily, satisfied that he was allowed to stay by his father. "Your children are always unwilling to go too far from you," he murmured carefully, "your scent is all over them. They want to know they can get back to you. Watch." The pack leader carefully shifted the chubby baby in his arms as he removed his suit jacket, using it to swaddle Benedict like a blanket. The second Mycroft's scent surrounded him, the pup began to fuss; he couldn't scent Sherlock at all and couldn't see him from his position high on Mycroft's chest. Soon he was whimpering and kicking, dangerously close to full-blown tears. "There, there, hush, it's alright," the ginger Alpha murmured, setting his tiny nephew back on the floor; the pup wasted no time in crawling straight to his father, clinging to him strongly and mewing for attention.
after this!" His voice was high and needy, stuttering little cries of pleasure dropping from his lips as he caressed his belly, the touches heightening his pleasure, his small cock rock hard and slapping against the underside of his mammoth belly with each thrust. "Ohhhhh, my Alpha... so strong, so protective...
, Sir," John breathed, clutching desperately at his Alpha's shoulders as his pleasure spiked. "I'll be a good Omega for you, so obedient, please you in every way you demand, offer you every fantasy you want... I'll love being round and ripe with your babies again, showing everyone what a potent Alpha you are, keeping your Omega constantly pregnant... Oh, Sir, your knot feels so good," he moaned deliriously, jerking his hips into his mate's hand as he came again, panting hard. "You'd like to take me to Pendleton's, wouldn't you Sir?" he smirked playfully, lapping submissively at his Alpha's jaw. The club was well known for its Alpha clientele, who would bring their collared Omegas along to kneel at their feet while they smoked cigars, drank brandy and discussed business; it was plush and traditional, all velvet armchairs and log fires and wood-panelled walls, full of powerful Alphas and their submissive mates. It was commonplace to see an Alpha petting their pregnant, naked, kneeling Omega's hair as they read a book or closed an important deal, full of the kind of men and women Mycroft worked with; making a show of your Omega at Pendleton's was a sure-fire way to gain respect amongst those more traditional circles.
John squeezed back reassuringly, and looked over his shoulder for the two security guards. He whistled and jerked his head in the direction of the prams, and in seconds the two huge men were standing by them.
Both the others' eyes widened in shock. Donovan looked as if she had some extra words for John, but the doctor's look stopped her in her tracks, and she closed her mouth. Anderson looked disbelieving, and a little jealous. Sherlock purred, relaxing and holding John closer against him. He nuzzled his mark on John's neck in respect, before letting his lips come to hover over the shell of John's ear. He kept his gaze locked with the two detectives as he growled "Mine," nipping the cartilage between his teeth, the action both possessive and dominating.
now, he thought happily to himself, keeping his hands obediently by his sides as he allowed the Alpha to do as he wished. "Mmm... and I'll give you anything you want, you know that... Have you ever thought about it, hmm? Having a collared Omega
Sherlock kissed John more gently and tenderly, mindful that his partner's lips looked rather sore; he ran a thumb over them gently. "We'll have to take care of these when we get home. I'm sure I have a gentle lip balm lying around somewhere - though I have to admit, I rather like this look on you," he smirked before brushing their mouths together once more. He pulled back, retrieving some paper towel to clean them both gently before doing up his trousers, then helping John with his own clothes. "Mycroft, indeed. He'll be seething with envy, seeing you like this."
John whined but opened his mouth for the pastry, eager to please his Alpha. He pushed his quivering belly further into his mate's hands, feeling his navel beginning to strain and push outwards. He took a deep breath and felt it move in small increments. "Oh god, Sherlock... it's going to go, I can feel it, it's going to pop out right here," he whimpered quietly, panting a little, his cock twitching with interest as his instincts writhed in glee at pleasing Sherlock, his nipples stiffening with arousal and lightly tenting the fabric of his shirt. He moaned as Sherlock growled low and held more water to his lips, opening his mouth for it and taking long swallows, fidgeting and wriggling, until finally he felt his belly button force its way out to press against his taut shirt. "Sherlock," he whined quietly, clutching his Alpha.
He closed his eyes as he rocked faster, meeting his mate's little thrusts and moaning breathily as Sherlock's hands continued to roam over his swollen belly with the perfect amount of pressure. The triplets kicked against his hand and the Omega's breath hitched at the sensation.
John gasped and stared slack-jawed at the exquisite lingerie, running it between his fingers as he raised his eyes to his mate.
did he say?" "It can't be!" "Do you think that's Siger's boy?" "It must be, the younger one, oh, what's his name..." "Look at the breeder he's got with him! Ripe as anything..."
The Alpha was not one for tears, but the memory of John's white anger, and feeling he'd experienced when he'd completely closed off from their bond, caused an awful, painful ache to bloom in his chest. John was the one person he completely clung to, his entire world. The pups as well, but they did not understand him as John did.
The pack ferried them to the nest and laid them gently in a pile on the bed, making them nice and warm and comfy, and John purred as he watched them shift and flex against each other. "Perhaps we should retire," Mycroft said tactfully; he knew John and Sherlock would want to guard the babies while they slept, and they had agreed in advance not to spend all day as a pack on Christmas Day to avoid making the pups overexcited. "I'll see you tomorrow. Merry Christmas,
Mycroft had located an unoccupied on-call room, locking the door behind them as Persephone waddled laboriously to an open bed, her jumper already pushed up over her swollen middle. Spreading her legs and holding the pole of one of the bunks, she lowered herself down with a heavy groan, stifling a grin as she saw Mycroft frozen in the doorway. "You like this, big boy?" she cooed, her eyes dark as she pushed the straining band of her trousers lower. Her gigantic belly sat low and ripe, the furthest curve of it pushing past her knees. "You like how big and swollen I've become because of you? Look at what you've made me, Myc," she moaned, caressing her full womb. Persephone's scent had changed, her usual floral notes becoming honeyed and inviting. "I'm so wet for you, my Alpha," she purred. "Please, I need you to take me now."
." Lunging forward, he captured his mate's lips in a searing kiss while his hand yanked back the blankets and began stroking Sherlock's throbbing erection, slicking it with precum. "Now are you going to be a good boy for me and wank yourself off until you come all over this big, pregnant belly you gave me?" John whispered teasingly, knowing Sherlock would be more pliant afterwards if the Alpha was in control of his own orgasm. "Because good boys get rewards..." He licked his Alpha's neck suggestively before leaning back to unbutton his shirt and expose his breasts. "If you're a good boy for me and get my belly all nice and wet with your cum, you can have a little feed before the doctor gets back," he moaned breathily, his own little cock hard in his trousers from the thought.
Hearing his mate's groans of pleasure made John purr with want, squirming as Sherlock's attentions left him breathless and slick, just on the cusp of orgasm but not quite enough to tip him over. He pushed back against his Alpha, relishing the thick member rubbing against his back - it felt delicious and he
Oblivious to the admiring throng John continued to suckle Sherlock's cock, making low needy whining noises in the back of his throat; his hole was soft and open, slick dripping down his thighs, and the other Alphas growled appreciatively at the sight. Eastlake began to thrust into his own Omega's mouth with more force as he watched John effortlessly take every inch of Sherlock's enormous erection, the sight making his cock twitch.
"Ohhhhh..." John gasped decadently, throwing his head back into the pillows as his mate's enormous cock forced his walls out of the way. He spread his legs wide, hooking them over the back of Sherlock's calves as they rocked together. His hands found their way to Sherlock's back and it was the Omega's turn to cling to his Alpha, fingers digging in to his pale back.
A while later he awoke, still in his mate's arms, and purred loudly, shifting to clean the sweat off Sherlock's brow with his tongue. "Mmm... how long was I asleep?" he mumbled, then registered the slick mess between his thighs and chuckled. "I must have been
Panting, his arm stinging fiercely from the wounds, Mycroft pressed on. Despite his wearying physical state, he remained as mentally sharp and cool as ever, fierce yet placid in the face of his father's wrath. Siger lost none of his form as his frustration rose, but he was becoming predictable in his monomaniacal rage to rid himself of his son. His attacks became brutishly forceful and direct, his defences coming almost as a second thought; parries were but momentary interferences between harsh thrusts and vicious slashes. The ginger Alpha moved to sidestep another such assault - but not quickly enough. Mycroft gasped as he felt the swift slide of metal against his neck.
can doubt our bond... Married, bonded, a litter of thirteen children... I'll always be there when you need me," he beamed up at his Alpha. "Speaking of which, we should really talk wedding arrangements. At this rate we won't have more than five or six months before I'm too big to walk. Shall we start with location?" he purred, nuzzling Sherlock again, inhaling his scent.
Sherlock sighed at John's embarrassment, nuzzling him back gently and kissing his temple, "Be calm, my Omega," he said softly, reverting to the old language to reassure his mate, "I understand we have a lot to learn yet. Rest assured that I will never hold you to anything I say in the heat of sex that seems unrealistic, impractical, or uncomfortable to you. You're right, I do say a mix of truth and fantasy - perhaps it is best that we clarify afterwards, if you or I are serious about the things we've said while we were coupling."
"You see, the way I see it, you have two options," he whispered in John's ear, squeezing the other Omega's breast until the wasted milk soaked through his nursing bra and began to leak through his clothing. "You can fight it, if you like - go ahead and show me a bit of that feisty Omega I met when I came in, a little bit of the great Captain John Hamish Watson" he mocked, "I won't be so boring as to kill you outright, no - but it's going to take a lot more effort to get my babies when their incubator's bleeding out. And some of them might come to harm. It would break my heart to have dead pups in our nest," he shook his head sadly, "But if you sit nice and still for me, Johnny..."
"She might," Sherlock mused, "However, I noticed she hasn't worn her plum-coloured dress lately - I believe it was already wearing before she accidentally tore the loose seam, and she hasn't bothered to repair it. I think I can guess her size, and we might be able to find her a replacement, as well." He could feel John's warmth radiating under his palm and hummed happily, stroking his Omega's oblong belly a little while longer. "You're getting so heavy with my pups," he murmured fondly in praise, "And still so early in your gestation."
Within a few minutes, the doorbell rang again, the Sherlock cursing softly at the requirement to leave his mate's side. "Just a moment," he said, pressing his lips to John's in promise when his Omega whined. Mycroft could get the door for himself, as far as he was concerned, but the Alpha would not disappoint his mate by being a bad host.
Sherlock felt himself calming another few degrees as the scenting process continued, though his cock remained hard and erect in his trousers, his need to claim John increasing by the minute. Sweating, trembling, the Alpha looked as if he were sick with fever by the time he sought his pack Alpha's approval to mark his Omega. Mycroft nodded. As Sherlock undressed, the elder Alpha gently divested John of his shirt and bra so that the Omega might be better claimed by his mate; the action was one of entire deference to Sherlock, showing that the pack Alpha was willingly offering this Omega as his brother's to be claimed.
insisted on boarding school. I'm so sorry, my darling. I love you so much, I won't ever leave you. Hush, now, it's alright. You've got me, I'm here, he will never separate us again, not ever."
"It's just that- well, I've been seeing Molly for quite a bit now-" Lestrade paused, completely unsure if there were formal words he should be using. "I - I want to ask her to marry me, and I wondered if - since you're, well, you're my pack Alpha, if you could - give us your blessing?" He looked at Mycroft with a helpless gesture. "I've got no idea what I'm supposed to be saying, to be honest. Help me out?"
The Alpha's eyes gleamed at the prospect, a pleased flush spreading across his cheeks and chest. "Mmm... Several things come to mind, yes," Sherlock purred, pressing a kiss to his mate's damp hair. He shifted to reach a hand beneath John's legs. "You know, I just love to watch you in pleasure," he whispered, grinning against John's ear as his long fingers closed around the Omega's small cock. He began to stroke delicately, moving over his mate's member in soft, lazy pulls; John was already so sensitive and desperate that it didn't take much. "You're right..," he murmured, watching hungrily as John's face contorted in bliss, "I've made you so gorgeous and plump, so heavy with my children... I've never seen an Omega more beautiful. And of course I'll feed you more, my love... Keep you properly large and sated even before you show with our next litter..."
John purred loudly as Sherlock smoothed his hands over his gravid swell, soothed by the fact his Alpha was no longer afraid to touch him. He panted and moaned breathily as Sherlock rocked inside him again, convulsing a little as his mate brought him to his pleasure again and again. He lay on the floor, chest heaving lightly, as his Alpha gathered his clothes and he allowed himself to be dressed, almost in a daze, feeling comforted and soothed and loved. He kissed Sherlock's lips sweetly when he was dressed, humming a little and winding his arms around his neck, rubbing his bump into his Alpha's stomach. "Ready to see that last house, love?" he purred softly, wondering which one they were seeing next. So far, there had been things he liked about all the houses, and was looking forward to discussing their merits and drawbacks with his mate. "And then we'll go home and nest. You can rub lotion on my belly and we'll talk about the houses we've seen today, see if we can narrow down our choices before tomorrow," he added, leading Sherlock out of the house and locking it up.
He stands, pulling Sherlock up with him until they stand facing each other. His hands come up to caress the familiar cheekbones, sweep aside the curls that will soon require a haircut; his thumbs come to rest lightly on closed eyelids.
“Shut up, Sherlock,” John laughs-cries, and Sherlock can’t help but give a teary smile in return and before he’s fully aware of it, John’s lips are on his, and Sherlock can’t do much but kiss the man back, and their first kiss tastes of wine and tears and hope and love, but he can’t ask for anything more, and he finally belongs to John, John belongs to him, and isn’t being in love the most wonderful thing Sherlock Holmes has ever felt?
“Listen to me!” John nearly shouts, desperate with fear. “I love you, alright?! Stop saying those things, Christ, just
The both of them returned to 221B just before midnight to a sight so precious, John couldn’t help but grin at the memory ingrained deep in the recesses of his brain: Sherlock spread out on the sofa, fast asleep, with his body slightly tilted and curled around a snoozing Rosie on his chest, made warm and comfy with her favourite blanket on top.
And so, John and Mary had left Rosie to Sherlock’s care as they left for some alone time and a lovely dinner, just the two of them, with Sherlock’s heartfelt vow - albeit a bit
Sherlock watches the minute movement with wide eyes, finding it increasingly difficult to breathe at the close proximity. This is nothing considering as they’ve embraced a couple times before this, but the circumstances have changed, they’ve exchanged declarations of love for the other and all acts of intimacy between the two of them are from now on have taken a whole other meaning.
you to the floor the night you came back!” John continues, his chest heaving, his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. “Fuck, why- why didn’t you tell me, Sherlock? Why didn’t you say something?!”
He had been away for a whole week in Belgium for a medical conference he was lucky to have been given the chance to attend. Not only is he mentally exhausted; he misses his bed, his comfy jumpers (one doesn’t get to wear anything less than a suit at a medical conference), a good cup of tea, and mostly, - admittedly -,
Sherlock lunged, grabbing John and flipping him around so that he was practically kissing the wall, dragging his teeth and placing light teasing kisses on the smaller man’s well-muscled back as he ground up against him, the bulge in his pants rubbing against the cleft of John’s arse. “Oh god, John,” Sherlock moaned, thrusting in minute motions, locking his arms tight around John’s waist, meeting him halfway as John turned his head to gasp and whimper into his mouth.
Sherlock has never laid bare his heart for the world to see like this, and he doubts it will be the last time, now that John is once more back in his life. If he is to be honest with himself, Sherlock finds the concept of being human all too-frightening, as if he is made all the weaker for it, and all the more vulnerable. Sometimes it is simply easier to not
Sherlock fidgeted endlessly in his seat, eyes burning fierce into the back of Mrs Roberts’ head, his glass of wine all but threatening to smash into pieces in his tightening grasp.
,’ John realises. His pulse is picking up, and sweat starts to prickle at the back of his neck. His breathing starts getting shallower; John knows he shouldn't be watching, but frankly he has always been curious about this side of Sherlock, and damn if this is not the sexiest thing he's ever seen.
He latches onto a pale collarbone with his mouth, sucking hard, bringing blood to the surface and soothing it with his tongue. He does the same higher up at Sherlock's neck. God knows how long John has wanted to do that, to leave his mark on Sherlock and announce to the world that the detective is taken.
, and emit a hopeful “Sh’lah?”, and John would respond with a little shake of his head and a firm kiss to her temple. He would do this every time she asked, without fail.
“J-John? What are you..? Is that?” Sherlock stutters, the envelope forgotten on the floor and the documents - adoption papers, for Rosie, of course - clutched tightly to his chest.
“He is my flesh and blood, Doctor Watson. I have more right over his wellbeing than you ever will. You’re just his
He spots a particularly intense halo floating to his right: the night John killed a man for him - without hesitation, his hand steady and true where it is wrapped around the handle of his Sig. John feigning innocence whilst surrounded by the police, Sherlock staring at him as the pieces fell into place.
Now here he lies, dying from blood loss and a broken heart. Again. Sherlock is a fool for trusting John Watson, letting him in, unlocking his true self underneath; the Sherlock that craved affection, and companionship, and someone to love and be loved in return.
In the days that followed, casual touches escalated to the not-so-casual and John found that he couldn't go a single day without laying an innocent kiss anywhere on Sherlock's face.
John stares at Mycroft, the twinge in his shoulder flaring up out of nowhere. He clenches his left fist, trying to dispel the ache.
“I’ve no choice, do I?” John fake-laughs, pulling away and patting his former landlady’s hand in reassurance. He turns back to the car to fetch Rosie, gifting his daughter with a tearful press of lips to her head, indulging in her lovely baby-smell and committing every detail of Rosie’s face to memory, from the tiniest flutter of her long lashes, to the perfect dimples dotting her chubby cheeks. “I’m going to miss you so much, little Miss,” John sighs, smiling as Rosie prods her stubby fingers into his hair. “Behave for Sherlock, and Nana Hudson, won’t you?”
“No, but I understand that Sherlock was already in cardiac arrhythmia when the paramedics were alerted to his unfortunate state by a member of his hateful homeless network.”
Sherlock winces at the alarming tone in John’s voice. Breaking eye contact through the mirror, he attempts to escape through the bathroom door that opens to his bedroom, only to have his plan thwarted as John plants himself in his way, his eyes burning with intensity and his lips pinched tight in barely restrained rage.
John stares at Sherlock. Sherlock stares back, unblinking. He feels the tension rising fast and hot in the room, eliciting an interested twitch from his still-exposed cock. He knows Sherlock feels it too.
“God, you're magnificent, you beautiful, gorgeous, incredible thing, you,” John praised, resting his head back onto the pillow, pressing back into Sherlock's every thrust. His left hand worked hard at bringing himself off, wrist flicking at each alternate pull. Sherlock huffed, kissing the top of his husband’s head.
Sherlock refused to speak to anyone after what happened at the hospital. He keeps to himself, brushing Mycroft’s hushed words aside, giving him the silent treatment until the elder Holmes gives up and marches his way out of the flat.
“Wait...stop!” Sherlock says, sitting up. John releases him, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “Come here, you.”
“Oh, you’re a bad man, John Watson,” Sherlock sneered, connecting their lips in another passionate kiss, his hands grabbing and kneading two handfuls of John’s arse, pulling the other man onto his lap in the process. His own erection was leaking precome, and he adjusted himself, willing his arousal to reduce to a steady simmer.
John can't help but wonder if Sherlock was even aware he'd sent that message. The two of them had finally got their act together after a chase through the streets of London, a couple of weeks ago that almost ended up with one of them in hospital. They'd only had to exchange a look before they were pressed up against one another, kissing for all it's worth.
“Mm?” the detective breathed, pressed against John from head to toe, his arms curled around John’s front, effectively enveloping the two of them in expensive, heavy woollen coat.
Now here they are, John and Sherlock, though it feels as if it will never be the same again. The shadows of Mary’s existence will continue to haunt them, and for all Sherlock knows, they could be walking on eggshells for the rest of their life.
, for when the occasion calls for it, Sherlock is able to distance himself enough from everything else and focus on what was important, especially when it came to solving cases for the Yard.
“Let’s go out for dinner tonight. Angelo’s at eight. I- I’ve called him up beforehand. What- enough of that, sweetheart,” John chokes through the flour permeating the air around them, gently grabbing Rosie’s arm to stop the powdery assault and heading towards the kitchen sink. He turns the tap, collecting a handful of water and cleaning his face before turning back to face Sherlock once more. “Is that alright with you, Sherlock?”
,” Sherlock whines, pushing up to hide his face in the juncture where John's shoulder and neck meet. “Oh god, I'm-!”
“I bet it was.” John winks. “That night, I decided then and there I wanted to marry you. It was only ever you, Sherlock. You made me into the man I’ve ever wanted to be. Who I want to be, Sherlock, is your life partner, your
Sherlock raises his gaze to settle on John's. The world stops spinning. He nods, almost imperceptibly.
Sherlock huffed a small laugh, kissing him hard, licking his way into John’s mouth to taste him. “I can’t wait to have you, John,” he purred. “I can’t wait to show everyone else that you’re taken.”
That had only been the first of many memorable candid moments of Sherlock and Rosie stored lovingly in John’s thoughts. He looks down at the toddler now, at her fragile, tiny fist curled beside her head, and John’s hand beside hers, gigantic in comparison. Something about that image made John’s skin crawl.
"John Watson, noble to the end," Sherlock says, finding it hard to tear his eyes away from the sight of the man before him. "I'm not your damsel in distress, waiting for my knight in shining armor to come rescue me."
Perhaps it’s time Sherlock take the leap. After all, he has nothing left to lose. He and John may never be the same.
John pushes up from the floor in as dignified a manner as he could attempt, launching himself onto the bed and attaching himself to Sherlock's plush lips. “God, you were magnificent, you madman. My bed, though?” John voices in between heated kisses.
A declaration couldn’t do much to hurt the already crumbling foundations of their strained relationship, can it?
Despite having crossed beyond the realm of a platonic relationship, neither John nor Sherlock have dared voice out their affections; instead they made it known through actions alone - an adoring nudge here, a playful hair tousle there, to the extent that Sherlock would linger at John's periphery until John opened his arms for a cuddle.
of Sherlock’s come leaking out drove the detective to gently roll them over so he was hovering above John.
“Thanks Molls. Let me know how Sherlock is doing in a couple of hours yeah? I was planning to get everyone together tomorrow for a small celebration - did you know it’s his birthday?”
Despite having heard the words uttered out of John's mouth the other night in the hospital, Sherlock is not entirely convinced that John is being sincere. After all, he would rather not have a repeat of what happened when he first declared his love as John was falling apart in his arms the morning after the Culverton incident.
Sherlock sighed. “It’s done, it’s over and yes, I left him handcuffed to the toilet. I simply gave you the chance to let loose during the case.”
He may be back to square one right now, but he still owed John for all that the man has given him, for John’s constant presence and guidance had been all Sherlock needed to regain his footing, and for his cold, hard exterior to warm and gradually fade to nothingness.
Sherlock gathers the sheer amount of data on John Watson he has in his mind and lets them saturate his very being.
“My, my, someone has a secret kink,” Sherlock heard from above him, the voice a mere rumble sated with pleasure and endorphins.
His lover nods repeatedly and pulls John's head down to press his mouth close to the shell of John's left ear and whisper, “
John is a very good kisser, as testified by his previous lovers. He knows how much to put into a kiss -- never too much tongue or biting. However at the first touch of Sherlock's tongue to his own, John has to restrain himself from plundering the wet, inviting heat of Sherlock's mouth. Instead he whimpers -- a sound he very rarely makes, admittedly -- and moves his hands to the hem of Sherlock's pyjama shirt.
"I love you," says the man who's pulled him into a tight embrace from which Sherlock has no intention on leaving. John's face is buried in the base of his neck, where Sherlock can feel moisture dripping onto his exposed chest. "I love you, you madman."
“Red carnations,” Sherlock breathes, staring at the vibrant folds of the blooms - one a lighter red and the other as deep and dark as the colour of blood - as John settles in the cushioned seat to his left. He notes that the doctor is seated exactly 4.5 inches closer to him than normal, so their clasped hands on the table are almost touching, and he is also keenly aware of the warmth emanating from John’s leg where it is brushing his own under the table.
As the shockwaves reverberate through him, the searing pain in his chest is enough to startle Sherlock into tears. He groans, crying out for something, someone, to
“Old man, eh?” John huffs, eyebrow raised in a challenge. He grabs both of Sherlock’s hands in his and pins it above the mop of curls, smirking back down at him before he plunders Sherlock’s mouth once more. Pulling his knees up, John straddles Sherlock’s stomach, rubbing his crotch over the sweaty skin, revelling in the delicious friction against his balls. “If I heard right, you said I’m the only one you’d ever want to do this with?”
“Fuck, fuck!” John sobbed, biting down into the palm of his hand. He keened some more as Sherlock sucked him down to the root, bobbing upwards and down, not missing a beat. “Alright, alright, yeah, please, just please, I'm yours, there's no one else, I
,’ John thinks, shoulders slumped in slight disappointment. As if on cue, he hears a muffled moan coming from his bedroom. John stills, posture alert, straining to pick up more sounds. It never occurs to him to wonder who could be in his bedroom in the first place.
John receives a glare in response. He cowers under the intensity of that piercing blue-green gaze, another apology quickly forming on his lips as he realises that he is doing a piss-poor job at proving himself worthy of the second chance Sherlock had readily given him the moment the younger man accepted his request to come home barely twelve hours earlier.
Helpless, John catches one last glimpse of Sherlock’s limp form before he is pulled away, thrashing to break free. He feels a prick to the back of his neck, and the world fades out.
,” the old lady exclaims, enveloping the doctor in a tight hug, which John returns with enthusiasm and stinging eyes. “Take good care of yourself out there, will you?”
“God, fuck, Sh-” John whimpered, sweat gathering at his brow as he increased the pressure of their hands on his cloth-covered erection. “She- she tried to come on to me, but- but I turned her down, obviously, oh God.”
“John, John, I need, I need-” Sherlock whispered, struggling to voice what he wanted most at that very moment. He was worried that John would laugh it off, or worse, push him away, treat this as another one of his so-called childish tantrums.
Sherlock rewarded him with a loud bruising kiss, bracing one arm around John’s shoulders, the other against the wall next to his head, before pulling out and thrusting back into John’s body with brutal force. The two men cried out in ecstasy as the slapping of skin on skin quickly filled the quiet air, John gritting out cry after cry of “
“Beautiful,” John sighed against Sherlock’s lips. “Breathtakingly so. Out. Of. This. World,” he reiterated, giggling as Sherlock attempted to hide his face in John’s neck, bashful and tomato red.
“Shut up and fuck me already,” John whimpered, lowering himself to lay fully on Sherlock’s body in submission, ripe for the taking. The new position made it easier for Sherlock to take over control, sealing their mouths together in a sloppy, possessive kiss. His hand reached down to feel where John’s body was eagerly accepting Sherlock’s cock. His bollocks have pulled back close to his body. His clothes beneath him were drenched in sweat, in their combined scents. Sherlock’s eyes widened at the thought of John’s come in between them, fusing with his very cells.
Mycroft took the invitation, moving closer to inspect the mark even as Sherlock positively snarled at the other Alpha's approach. The crescent shape of the bite was coloured in rich shades of red, the areas where Sherlock's teeth had broken the surface a dark wine colour. The hues spread out from the immediate area of the bite, and obviously ran deep underneath the flesh, as well - it was the kind of mark only made by the most compatible pair, strong and unfading. Mycroft's eyes snapped up to meet Sherlock's glare, and the look he gave him was almost one of acknowledgement. "I have never seen one like it," he admitted, his face twisted as if he'd just ate something bitter.
, the actions ordered. Despite the fact that the condom was especially made for Alphas, Sherlock could feel it straining to hold the incredible volume of his seed as he continued to spurt hard over and over again, his body attempting to impregnate the Omega in heat impaled on his cock.
he asked curiously when John had relaxed fully against him, the Omega's heavy body still fitting comfortably against his own. He knew his mate was falling asleep, but the detective needed to know the answer. John's scent continued to change in subtle ways, causing tendrils of excitement and anticipation to curl in the Alpha's stomach.
, begging for your knot... felt so good when you filled me with your come, so full it gushed out of me and soaked the sheets when your knot went down. I can't wait until you can knot me again... I'll scream your name as many times as you want," he whispered, kissing and licking along Sherlock's collarbone. "We should really start looking at houses and different areas of the suburbs... shall we each find, say, five houses and arrange viewings for next week?"
"Mmm, yes, you're so round, my Omega, so gorgeously big. You've been so good for me, now you deserve all the attention I'm going to give you," Sherlock's Alpha was not far beneath the thinning veil of his rational mind, and he could feel it coming to the fore as he saw nothing but Omega in front of him, wanting his approval and his cock, swollen gorgeously full with his pups at his command. It was immensely difficult not to lay his mate on the ground right there and mount him while he pushed his belly into the Alpha's hands. "You'll need water first," he said huskily, his eyes dark as he greedily cupped and stroked the swollen flesh, "And you should finish my portion of food. You and our pups need the sustenance." He smeared the new milk around John's breasts and over the curve of his stomach, making the taut skin glisten and shine, the scent of pregnant Omega heavy in the air and growing stronger by the minute. Dipping down to press a kiss to the farthest curve of John's round belly, the Alpha scooped his Omega up in one smooth motion, easily carrying him across the kitchen and through the door of their bedroom. He laid the gravid man on the bed gently, pressing a kiss to his forehead and leaving him whining as he went to retrieve the leftover takeaway, a glass of water, and the bottle of special lotion. "Eat. Drink," he commanded when he returned, handing the meal to his Omega and cracking open the bottle of lotion, warming it between his palms and beginning to rub the heavy swell reverently, growling and moaning approvingly and placing gentle kisses along the skin as he worked.
Sherlock stirred slowly, giving a pleased hum as he opened his eyes to John's body, resting well against the soft skin of his mate's chest. He could feel the slight firmness in the globes of John's breasts, a sign that the Omega was reaching his current limit. The Alpha inhaled deeply, scenting the milky note of an Omega needing to be nursed. He obliged with a deep purr, turning his head to latch onto one of John's large nipples, whimpering softly and making pup-like sounds to get his mate to let down more milk as he nursed. His hand roamed over John's belly and down towards the Omega's small cock, beginning to tug gently on it in sync with the pulls of his mouth.
The Alpha hummed softly, purring, nuzzling his mate and in reassurance. Sherlock had been falling more and more easily into his Alpha state as John drew closer to the birth, slipping oftentimes without warning, his instinct taking over with as little of a trigger as a mewl from his Omega. He felt John's nervousness as acutely as John himself. He curled against his mate; despite John's need to have him near, he'd managed to give them both a wash that morning - a sponge, soap, rinse water and a towel all that were necessary to clean John's massive form. The Alpha enjoyed rubbing the soapy loofa over the vast swell of his mate's belly, and so did their pups; John's womb was never still anymore, but as Sherlock cared for his mate, it shifted and warped violently - a massive, alien thing, bulging irregularly as the pups shifted, rolled, and kicked happily in response to their father's nurturing. Now Sherlock crooned to it as he kissed his mate, crawling over to the other side of John's body to remove the fucking machine, inserting his own throbbing member in its place. It irked him to have something other than his own cock inside John when he was in his Alpha; he'd tolerate nothing but himself, his instinct giving him the stamina to pleasure his mate for as long as the Omega wanted. He grunted lowly as he began to thrust, lapping and nuzzling John's neck.
me - show me how - ah, yes - just your breeder... want it, cock, now, make me take it," he begged breathily, his desperation to please his mate and hurt at having disappointed him obvious in his voice.
"See? Not so bad after all," smiled Sherlock, bouncing a clingy Felix on his knee. Felix didn't seem to be buying it at all; out of all his siblings, the pup was the most difficult to leave. Given time, though, Sherlock knew the little boy would settle with the other pack members - but not before many unhappy tears were shed.  "If you're very good," the Alpha tried to bargain, "I'll make sure you get a special treat when we get home." He looked to his Omega.
A satisfied grin grew on Sherlock's face as his mate spoke, though it faded at the last questions. He furrowed his brow, remembering; John's scent had been so heady that the minor details were hazy. "It's possible that I did, but it's not what I was thinking about at the time - not at first," he answered honestly, "I smelled you in heat, and the rest of my concentration was bent on keeping myself from giving in to instinct. Even when my guard broke down, I wasn't truly focused on discerning the notes in your scent - not until you purposefully changed it, that is. That was when I knew - I could scent your desire, your honest need, how much you wanted me, that you'd dropped eggs for me." He inhaled, giving a small shiver of pleasure at the memory. "I knew I could breed you, I knew you wanted me to breed you..." The Alpha purred deeply, watching more lumps form in John's amorphous belly as the pups settled into place. "Christ, I bred you..," he murmured proudly, nipping at John's earlobe and dipping a hand down to press around John's slick entrance.
John sat patiently as Sherlock took his card back and prepared to leave, allowing him to button up his coat and fuss over him to make sure he was protected against London's December weather. He didn't dare to look at Sherlock during the cab ride home; he knew that if he did he'd want to simply open his shirt right there and demand relief. When they finally got home he all but threw himself at his mate, rubbing up against him hopefully. "I know you're full, love, but please... please, I need you to suck my tits, just a little, I need your mouth on me... If you want you can finish milking me with your hands, oh god, please, I'm so full..."
"Just a bit longer," Sherlock crooned soothingly, wanting to build their releases even more, "I'll make it good for you, I promise." He sped up another fraction, adjusting the pumps another few settings faster, panting and grunting as he began to fuck his Omega harder. His hands moved to John's hips, holding him steadily to keep the pumps from swinging too much, controlling the pace of their lovemaking. When he felt he could hardly hold on any longer, he placed his hands on the Omega's belly again, growling, "Now."
"I want to support our family," he said bluntly. "If there's an outbreak of something, I'll come home, I promise. I want to be an obedient Omega for you," he added, kissing his mate's lips sweetly. "I'll see you later, alright? Want me to bring a takeaway home?" His instincts demanded that he obey his Alpha's wishes, but since they were not yet commands he fought the impulse. He did want to help look after their babies, even if his financial contributions where nowhere near as large as Sherlock's.
I'll never get near enough to breed you again if you let these live." The Alpha couldn't help himself as his eyes welled with tears. "Don't kill our pups, John. If you want an after-heat pill, I won't stop you, but I also will not be the one to get it for you."
He pressed another sweet kiss to the Omega's lips and hurried off to their room. This would be the only year they'd be carrying all thirteen of their first litter into the living room - the next, with the exception of the triplets and a few sleepy one-year-olds,  the pups would be toddling in on their own on Christmas morning.
“Yeah. Right, sorry.” John scratched his chin and breathed deeply, catching his breath. “Anyway, this fan had said she knew you were for real. Not because she met you or because of the blog, but because she knew the Moriarty twins. That's what she said. So obviously I took the bate and we'd been emailing back and forth. She told me they were inseparable, sometimes even traded places just to fool the teachers. Richard was bullied a lot because of his autism, which caused him to develop anxiety. Vicky had said that the only escape for Richard was acting classes. He was a sweet kid she said, but tried to commit suicide a couple of times.” Sherlock stared at the photo of Richard Brooke, now knowing to be Richard Moriarty.
“Get him home! I'll follow.” Greg had yelled as John was yet again dragged away, Sherlock holding him back but keeping him steady as they went.
“Yeah,” John whispered, “You said, 'There's always something'. The first day we met.” And John grinned. He sly, only-for-Sherlock grin.
When the door opened, the wind and cold hit John dead on, but there was no one there. John sighed and frowned, he was just about to shut the door before he had heard the noise. It was a cry, a new born baby cry and John looked down to the step. There, in front of 221B Baker Street was a Moses basket. Inside was a baby, barely even a month old by the looks of her, and an envelope sat on top of a mass of pink blankets. John was startled and he reached down to get a better look. The envelope had his name on. His. It can't be.
"Twins," Sherlock whispered and shook his head slowly. "Well. That's one way to fake your death I suppose."
Warning for some violence, not to Rosie, but I must note that she's not well. I don't know how else to warn you all about this chapter. It's a little dark.
Those months leading up to Sherlock's return, even the months following, while he was with Mary, there was something. Just something. Something he could never quite put his finger on. She had gained a little weight, but had always worn baggy clothing, refused to be naked around him and refused to change around him. But still, how could he have not realised!? Was he really that blind!? If he had known, he would have fought harder for their relationship, he would have tried to make it work. maybe that was why she had hid it so perfectly.
“Oh I see, and you're in a position to point a gun at a two week old baby?” John hissed. “Has anyone been in touch with my lawyer? I'm assuming I have that right at least?”
John's head snapped back with such force behind Jim's fist. “That's enough!” He all but screeched. “I have something set aside for Sherlock in regards to that, and you're going to help me.” Jim's hand rested softly against John's cheek, bringing his face back towards Jim's very own.
John was wheeled to the front of the hospital, his body shivering and it wasn't from the cold. His face was killing him, his stomach felt heavy and empty all at the same time and he felt sick. He knew what was coming and he knew he couldn't prevent it. He was unconscious for the effects of the serum but his body remembered. His body wanting more, refusing the logic of John's mind and his will power. His body was betraying as it always does.
The case was a dead end, just as Sherlock knew it would be, but that didn't stop him from being agitated with everyone and everything. The dead female was a Jane Doe. The wedding ring was planted, the way she was dressed was just for show. Having to explain all this to the idiots that made Scotland Yard was very tedious. And Sherlock had ensured everyone knew of this.
“Sally!? What the hell!?” John had to yell over a screaming child, only now did he lower the gun. He was about to turn to take his child, just to hold her when Sally's voice stopped him.
Once upstairs in the bedroom, he watched Sherlock with Rosie, his leg touching the other man's. He watched as Rosie fell asleep in his arms and watched as Sherlock put her back in her cot gently. No one could ever tell John this man didn't care.
“Don't you fucking dare!” John yelled, stepping in front of the gun, on hand pointing in Sally's face. He didn't care that her hand shook, he didn't care that she paled a little, and he didn't care for the officers behind her. All he cared about was that she had just pointed a gun to Sherlock who was holding his premature baby. “You ever raise a gun towards my daughter again, I will have you!”
“She's alive, an ambulance will be ..” The noise upstairs had Sherlock stopping mid sentence. Then John had heard it, a cry. A baby's cry. His daughter.
It felt like an age before someone finally entered the room. He appeared to be on the shorter side with greying hair and the kindest eyes. He was on the chubbier side but he held himself well, and the smile he held as he saw John was enough to relax him, but only very slightly.
John nodded once and looked around the room. It was spacious, a child's cot by the window, a rocking chair close by and monitors if needed. Very clean, very respectable and way above John's pay grade. “Does Mycroft have an abundance of private rooms for any and all occasions?” He asked as a joke and turned to Anthea. She winked, but said nothing as she left the room. John shook his head and sighed, placing Rosie in the cot bed gently. He placed a hand to her head and frowned at the temperature. He placed his other hand against her chest lightly, making sure her breathing was clear. It was. But still, something wasn't right.
Sherlock jumped and moved around John, “I'll get her, you make her midnight bottle,” and with that Sherlock vanished up the stairs, heading for the crying child. When he entered the room, he quickly scooped her into his arms and held her close against his chest, supporting her head against his shoulder as he bounced her gently. “You have the worst timing, little one..” Sherlock whispered and settled to sit on the bed, just as John entered with the night time feed. He passed the bottle to Sherlock without a word and sat beside him on the bed, so close their legs were touching.
“It's addressed to you brother dear. I've had it scanned and it's not an explosive but a DVD. I have requested a television to be brought in, so that we can view it together. You won't be alone in this.” Mycroft said, his tone softening due to the look of pure fear on Sherlock's face.
“Such as Jim's eyes are slightly closer together, Richard has thinning hair, smaller lips, Jim is a little taller, more muscular. Richard's skinny..”
“Not here. He's off this case now. He's too close.” Sally moved towards John and put a hand on his arm, “You'll have to come to the station to answer a few questions.”
Sherlock blinked and swallowed. No one moved. It felt like an age, and yet only ten seconds had passed. Then Rosie cried.
Donovan made her way to the chair in front of John, a desk separating them, and her college took to the one in the corner. No one said anything while Donovan set the tape to record and pulled out a couple of folders and papers that were secured in a case at her side.
“Yes. It was Colonel Sebastian Moran. He was running a drug, weapon and child trade within the country, and the tip off with one of the nests was one of his own. He couldn't allow us to get so close because that would mean the end of him, or something like that anyway. I'm not so sure any more, but I remember him being there. He was the one who initiated the torture on my team, he was the one to have burnt the bodies before the surviving three, and he was the one to shoot us on the desert. His sniper skill unprecedented. No one could match him and he knew it. Probably still knows it the smug bastard.”
Loud banging and a flurry of foot steps against the stairs had John straight out of bed and Sherlock reaching for a now screaming Rosie, the noise having woken her up with a jolt. John was standing in front of the two, his Sig in his hands after grabbing it from beneath his pillow and aimed it at the door, his heart hammering, adrenaline pumping and anger surging through his veins. It was just after midnight, his daughter terrified, whoever had the nerve to break into their home and bang about better have a damned good reason before a bullet went through their eyes.
“Ah yes, the mysterious little girl. Mary her mother? It must have made you so angry that she would just abandon your child like that?” Donovan looked up at John and he flinched. But still he kept quiet. The Sherlock in his head telling him to say nothing more, there was something not right about this whole thing. He had no legal representative, he was uncomfortable and in pain. He had always thought Donovan was a bitch, but he had always admired her passion for the job she did. Although, his ideas about her were quickly changing.
“John!” Sherlock snapped this time, gaining his best friends attention. “You are not Moriarty, you are nothing like them. Mycroft has promised, and ..” Sherlock blinked for a second, turned John's words over in his head and frowned in confusion. “Our daughter?”
Alright? Of course he was not alright? Wait. John was holding Rosie a second ago, where is she? His eyes flickered around the living room, it was a mess of boxes and rubbish and Mycroft and ... Wait, Mycroft!?
The trip back to Baker Street took too long in John's opinion. Sherlock was click clacking away on his phone, his posture and face remained calm, but John could see a slight tremble in his hands as he texted. There was no report from Mycroft as of yet, which annoyed John to no end, but he breathed deeply, trying to calm himself down. John focused on Sherlock, his trembling hands and his bouncing knee. It was a reflex really, he reached out and rested a gentle hand onto Sherlock's knee and gave it a gentle squeeze, but said nothing.
“Hello?” John asked as he took the phone, Sherlock sitting up and watching intently, ignoring his brother as he watched John stiffen, the grip on phone tightening. If only he could hear the other end of the conversation.
“Well, just John's army records really. They were pretty much blank but from what John has told me before, I was able to fill in the blanks and we may have some leads to follow. I wanted to run it by you first. I feel like I'm grasping at straws here.” Lestrade sighed and took a seat by Sherlock. “John has told me once or twice that he and a unit under his command would run special ops, top secrete and all that jazz. Finding and securing criminals of war, drug and weapons trade, child trafficking, you name it, him and his team would take it down. One mission went wrong. Him and his team were captured and killed, leaving him the only survivor. The mission report is blank, just that it went wrong, the team was assumed killed in action and then a few days later John radioed in for evacuation and he was found shot in the desert with two others, the rest of team was found burned in an abandoned village.”
Sherlock stared at the two photos a little more and grinned. “Oh. Of course. How could I have ever missed that!?”
"And what is so wrong with that?" John intercepted, cradling his child in his arms. He must have retrieved her from up stairs, and made a bottle as he was holding towards her lips gently, coaxing her into drinking before looking back to Mycroft. "I honestly appreciate the help and the gifts Mycroft, but as Sherlock had said, we will manage. I'm ... I mean we," He looked down to Rosie, then to Sherlock for a second longer before staring back at Mycroft, "are here to stay. If we are wanted that is?" Again, back to Sherlock, and Sherlock couldn't help it. He grinned.
Just then the door down stairs went and feet thundered against the stairs. “Sherlock's been shot!” John said in greeting as Mycroft burst through the door.
John couldn't stop herself. “Major Charlotte Green, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Second in command of my unit. Died in action.” John muttered, his eyes owed.
John jumped when he heard the door squeak quietly, a nurse had just been in to check Rosie's stats, she shouldn't be due another check so soon. John turned and stiffened, he hadn't seen this guy before and he looked a little too threatening to be in a children's ward. John swallowed hard, and before he could react, the guy had pulled out a gun and fired. John expected to feel the heat and the burn of a bullet, but instead he felt a sting in his neck, as if he had been stung by a bee. His hand shot up to his neck and pulled out a dart. He was furious. He could feel the drug taking effect but he will not let his daughter go!
"We. John, we." Sherlock placed an arm around his best friend and pulled him into an embrace. "We will think of something I asure you. But first, she'll need a name."
“Lets get this over with.” Sherlock whispered, swallowing a lump that had formed in his throat and he steeled himself, cutting off all emotions and becoming a shell on the outside, if only to be able t gather as much details in the DVD without sentiment getting in the way.
“Mike?” John asked, not caring who else was in the room. But there was no answer as he was once again hoisted up on the chain, and maneuvered so his body could rest against the bed, his back towards the one he had called friend. “I know that shuffle anywhere, and that voice.”
Jim must have seen something in John's eyes, because his steps had faulted for half a second before continuing on. “Dear Jim,” John replied with a forced smile, death hidden behind it's meaning, “please fix it for me to enact my revenge on the one who caused my sister's death.”
“Not yet, but we will. And whoever is responsible for this will not live to see the next sunrise.” Mycroft stated as he came to stand by Sherlock's bed. Sherlock nodded, he has only seen his brother in such a rage once. Only once and he had vowed to Sherlock that he would always protect him and never allow him to see such anger again, unless it was absolutely necessary.
"You had escaped into you head for well over five hours Sherlock, just after sending out a million text. I don't know what you did but there were deliveries and handy men and even some homeless kids all rushing about, setting up a cot, playpen, I think there's a pram down stairs. Mrs Hudson was beside herself. I showed her the note and explained the situation. I think she's happy. Then your brother turned up, clothes toys and nappies, bottles and formula. Even had a home visit from a doctor. She's doing well for being early." John was rambling. why was he rambling? He only did that when he was overly nervous, or scared.
"Jesus" He heard John whisper beside him as he lowered himself towards the body, taking in every bit of detail. yes, she was wearing pink, but she was too old to represent their first case together. She was brutally stabbed several times, loss of blood being the course of death. What stuck out most was the pink phone held loosely in the victims hand. Sherlock reached for it and frowned. It was set on John's blog post, 'A Study in Pink'. That was when he finally looked up, his eyes locking onto the message on the wall.
“but there's more. My sister spoke of you a lot in her letters. She looked up to you. She even liked you, but something to do with formalities and crap were she would not be able to court with a commanding officer, but that didn't stop you, did it Watson? Still had your way with her didn't you! Making her feel special only to let her die!” The voice hissed, the hand was in his hair again, “well, now I shall have my vengeance, but not before I have my fun!”
John and Sherlock had been wheeled into the same, private hospital room. This was against hospital regulations, but with the hefty donation the hospital had just received, they were in no position to argue. Sherlock was not fully recovered, but he forced himself to lay awake until John had come around. The blonde man was still out cold on the bed beside him, and Sherlock couldn't help but take a note of the injuries John had sustained. A broken nose, fractured cheek bone and concussion, Sherlock noted with a grimace. His face was black, blue, purple and yellow in places. It appears to be swollen considerably, with few stitches around the left eye. 'Must have been drained of gathering fluid', Sherlock thought and grimaced once again.
He pokes and prods until Sherlock huffs a heavy defeated sigh and twists to face John. His eyes are red and his nose sniffles. He drops his gaze. “I've done you so much wrong, and yet you choose to be with me. Why?”
. “C- can’t wait till we get home this time huh?” he grinned weakly, letting loose a small moan as Sherlock’s small thrusts coincided with a particularly firm press of their hands against his groin. John’s other hand was shaking, the umbrella sheltering them starting to sway unsteadily.
The hand sweeps from his left to his right to settle on his right arm, unhesitant and purposeful in its journey. Its owner pulls ever so gently, and Sherlock lets himself be turned, and his gaze lands on his doctor, who stands so close that there is barely any empty space between them.
Sherlock receives the flower with wide eyes, his mind already helpfully supplying him with the meaning of said flower -
Sherlock howls, body tensing, back muscles flexing under John's hands. He scrambles for a firmer grip on the pillows as he parts his knees further, opening himself up. John licks his lips and moans at the sight, sweat trickling down his forehead with the exertion.
Sherlock picks at his pasta with a fork, his face flushed with slight embarrassment. “I said something about the Work and myself.”
. He rubbed John's nipples, swallowing his moans as he kept his arm hooked under John's left leg, thrusting steadily into the welcome heat of his lover's body.
Neither man as much as move a muscle. Sherlock breathes shallowly, his heart rate picking up out of their own accord as his brain screams at him to either do something to rectify the situation, or god forbid Sherlock does this -
Mycroft’s scathing words haunt John for days afterwards, the threat unspoken but clear as day. He shudders just thinking of it, alone in his flat as he stares at Rosie’s sleeping form, tucked soundly into her cot. The little girl has been cheerful, mostly, but once in awhile she would give John a
He sees Sherlock’s face from yesterday afternoon, the normally unsmiling face riddled with crinkles old and new, a small upturn at the corner of his mouth betraying a small, fond smile. His eyes were alight with fear, uncertainty, but his arms where they were wrapped around John’s shaking form were steady and protective.
John braces one arm against the doorframe while his left hand fumbles with the button to his jeans, unzipping as quietly as he can. His jaw is clenched and he's breathing harshly through his nose, barely managing to suppress a loud moan as he thrusts his hand inside his pants, wrapping it around his cock, slick already from the precome he's steadily leaking.
Sherlock turns around, grabbing the dressing gown hanging at the back of the door and slipping it on, hiding the sad state of his back from John's gaze. "Broke a finger or two, tried to drown me to make me talk, strung me up like a ragdoll. That's all I can remember from my time in isolation," he murmurs, staring at anything but his friend. He feels John's hand cupping his elbow with his thumb rubbing the skin back and forth, back and forth, the gesture obviously meant to be soothing.
. I wouldn't live in a world where you ceased to exist, John. I couldn't. Thus I died, so you could live."
Sherlock gulps, his throat gone tight. He looks down at their entwined hands and the ring, and the enormity of the moment hits him then, that he is of that very moment, a word, a single syllable away from the one thing he’d never thought he’d find. The love of his life, which in this case is a culmination of ugly jumpers, comfy jumpers, endless cups of tea, kisses in his hair, kisses on his forehead followed by his lips, eyes drowning in love and fascination each and every time they’re trained on him. John Watson is truly a miracle.
John feels another stab at his heart at the revelation that apparently Molly knows more about Sherlock than he would care to admit, and yet, who here is supposed to be Sherlock’s best friend?
We're finally getting somewhere people! I hope you enjoy this chapter very much. My everlasting thanks and love to all of you <3
I feel like I've let you guys down with the huge delay, but a promise was a promise, and I promised I would finish this story.
“That’s good, I’ll turn around and let you settle down alright? Get comfortable,” John murmured, laying a soft kiss on the taller man’s reddened cheek. He pulled away, taking the opportunity to pull his armchair closer and at an angle to Sherlock’s positioning that would facilitate his drawing, and only turned back when he registered the telltale squeak of bare skin pressing down on the soft leather of the sofa.
“Yes. She's three weeks old now, but she shouldn't have been born for another five weeks at the most.” John reached over and stroked the little blonde hair, hardly visible but definitely blonde.
"Well actually, this could be twins. I wasn't completely bone idle while you were gone you know. Mary said I was obsessed. Maybe I was but I rufused to believe you would just jump because you were a fake. Bollocks to that." John sighed and pointed to the laptop. "I made Mycroft give me everything he had on Moriarty and I mean everything. I even took Kitty Riley's article and picked it apart. I hadn't lived with you for years without picking up on a few things. Plus I'm a doctor. And looking back when we met Richard, it's so blaringly obvious they're identical twins. You'll see the school photo posted on the social media page. There's a school reunion. Maybe we should hit it up."
He ignored Sherlock and went running up the stairs and slammed into 221B Baker street, only to be welcomed by two mad men and the cowering agents.
Sherlock didn't speak. His eyes flickered across the screen in front of him. His hands shifting over the mouse, pulling up different bits of information at a time. "Did you show this to Mycroft?" He finally answered.
“No...” John whispered shaking his head. He slumped and his body began shaking and he shook his head, “no...”
“Every identical twin has slight differences, not easy to spot. But then again, I'm a doctor. Plus I've been staring at these two for months! I know the differences.”
“Do it.” Was all Sherlock said as Mycroft entered the room, holding a brown envelope in his hand and a look of utter murder on his face. “Molly, would you mind taking Rosie out of the room for just a moment please.” He said, his calm demeanor never waving but his eyes not giving her a chance to argue. She did as was asked, giving Sherlock's hand a quick squeeze, and Lestrade a quick kiss on her way out.
Thank you for sticking with this, let me know if you like it so far, will try and update as much and as quickly as I can going forwards x
John went silent, realising tears were falling as he was forced to remember those nights, those horrendous nights that haunt his dreams. He lost his only friends that week, and he lost someone he cared about greatly and he cried for them. The kick to his chest was not what he was expecting and again he curled in on himself, coughing up a lung.
"Rosie. It suits her perfectly." Sherlock gave John a little squeeze and then moved away, swooping down to grab his phone, his fingers flying across the keys. "We will need clothing, bottles, formula. We'll need baby proofing and the like. I'm sure I have a few favors to call in."
Thinking back on that short conversation made John want to cry but he couldn't. Their daughter needed him now, and true to the caller's word, a car had pulled up at the pick up point of the hospital. John was wheeled to the car and Mycroft stepped back as two men came to help John into the back seat. No words were spoken as John was driven away. He turned to look out of the back window in time to see Rosie passed to Mycroft, and then there was nothing as he felt a jab in his neck. Darkness surrounded him and he slipped into blissful unconsciousness once more.
“You attacked a fellow recovering soldier during your stay in a rehabilitation unit. Such rage in you Doctor Watson, is it possible that that rage was directed towards Miss Morstan for abandoning your daughter?” Donovan smirked. “You killed her didn't you! You left the flat and hunted her down in the dead of night and killed her!” Donovan slammed a fist against the desk, John didn't flinch. He just clung to the words, Mary was murdered and they're pinning it on him. Mary was dead. Mary .. Mary was dead.
“Mycroft?” Sherlock was suddenly pale, his hands shaking as his eyes dropped to the envelope in his brother's hand.
"Rosie." John answered without skipping a beat. "I was always hoping to have a child, always wanted a little girl by the name of Rosie, after my mother. God rest her soul. John whispered, not wanting to wake the now resting baby.
"You promise?" John replied, his voice soft but shaking. His hands were shaking. His whole body trembling as he looked desperately at Sherlock.
Over the next hour or so, John watched as people came and went, attaching wires to his daughter and watching the machines, John knew each wire did something to help his daughter but was still rather unnerving to see. He wondered how Mary had felt when she was born, she should have been attached to some machinery to help in the first few days of her life. Maybe Mary knew what her fate had been so that was why she had abandoned Rosie. It made more sense that the daft excuse she had left in the note.
“You killed my brother!” Moriarty screeched, his anger escaping him, making him lose his composure. John would never admit it out loud, but Jim's changeable attitude terrified him.
Sherlock felt tired, drained and weak, he was about to tell his brother to leave, but he saw the fire in those eyes and swallowed hard. He used his other hand to grab the remote for the bed and lift it up a little more, wincing as he moved with the bed.
Sherlock was silent at John's sudden outburst. John noticed Sherlock's shock and he sagged a little against his head board, one hand coming to rub at his face. “Sorry. I just .. I just. It makes sense now as to how he walked if I'm honest.” John whispered.
With that they both giggled softly, trying not to wake the little girl from her slumber, and Sherlock breathed easily once again. He will adapt. He meant every word, he would be lost without John, but not for reasons John suspects. Sherlock is not as unfeeling as people around him tend to think. It's not that he doesn't care about sentiment, or that he just doesn't care. It's just that he cares too much.
Sherlock stormed into the interview room, “This stops right now! Can't you see that man is having a panic attack! He suffers from PTSD and you shove pictures of his ex partner in his face, a woman who had loved is dead and this is how you tell him!” Sherlock was more than angry, he was furious. “I will have your badge for this Donovan, you mark my words! I'll have the chief's job as well, interviewing a man without so much as a lawyer in attendance and for what!?”
The nails to his right hand were throbbing, and he was expecting the left next. But no. No that's not what happened at all. With a laugh of pure delight, his torturer took the hammer to each of John's fingers on his left hand, breaking every bone in each finger and the hand. John wept and at the end, passed out from the pain. Hoping against hope that Sherlock find him soon, if they do not splint up his left hand soon, his medical license would be invalid. His career as an army surgeon ended the moment he was shot, but he was able to still practice medicine. But if the damage to his hand was not fixed up soon, he wouldn't be able to so much as write a prescription, never mind stitching up a wound.
