“Just a thought. Tend to function better with food in my stomach. You’re a freak of nature, but I’m just a pretty normal bloke who doesn’t do well on an empty stomach.”
“You are neither welcome nor wanted here, Mr Moriarty. And it is quite presumptuous of you to assume either of yourself.” Mycroft’s voice was dangerous, and Sherlock could see Lestrade and Alexandra holding back John from doing…something properly violent.
“Oh, and just in case you’ve missed Sergeant Donovan’s very clear “not interested” signals, this should serve as fair warning to leave her be.” Sherlock grinned at Anderson with a smile that usually meant trouble before he turned to Sally, who stood by watching with barely-concealed glee, and grabbed her by the front of her jacket before doing something that, if they hadn’t been friends, would have gotten him laid out. But Sally had asked for help, and he was providing assistance to a friend in need. He didn’t do it often, and
“Yes, sir.” She smiled, rolling her eyes as her mug refilled itself. “Got a promotion a couple weeks back, actually. You can imagine how happy that made my boss.”
Crawling out from under the trailer, Judith wondered what anyone who might have seen her would have thought. She knew there were cameras all over the site, and wondered if Mycroft was watching tonight. He’d been keeping closer tabs on her and John and Sherlock after the third suicide, concerned for their safety. It was a kind gesture, but unnecessary, as Judith and John were far more than capable of handling themselves in nearly every violent situation they might get into. She carried the box back to her car and set it on the front seat, holding the door for the mother cat, who had followed along at heel like a dog. She watched as the mother hopped into the box and started grooming her kittens.
Desperate to set things right with recent history, Judith found herself standing on the street in front of Saint Bart’s at the exact moment everything had started going wrong. The only people aware of the moment time froze were Judith and John, and Stephen Strange. Up on the roof, she could see Sherlock and Moriarty facing each other. A moment’s patience paid off as Stephen Strange stepped onto the ledge. Time to make sure history didn’t repeat itself. She opened a sling-portal onto the rooftop and joined Stephen. John stayed behind on street-level. Once she had reached the roof, they turned time a bit more to watch just what went wrong. It was one thing to see the aftermath, their broken bodies on the street below, but it was something
“I have seen you in far less savoury condition than after a morning run, my dear.” He just smiled and let her scroll through the information he’d collected.
Dispatch was quick to get back to her and Judith moved her car down to start the scene. As soon as the car from Brixton arrived, she made entry into the empty house, going in first. It was like clearing houses in Afghanistan, the same principles applied. There was nothing on the ground floor, or on the first floor, but on the second floor, they found Jeff Hope’s last victim.
“What did…he say?” Sherlock caught himself. He’d almost said “What did I say?”, and that would have been A Bit Not Good.
to Baker Street, could he? There was nothing there for him to go back to. Not this time, not anymore.
are!” Thumbing over his shoulder at the sound of sirens behind them. “Oh, nice response time, lads.”
“Come upstairs with the papers, and tea if you don’t mind, Mrs Hudson? I’ll introduce you to him upstairs.”
Moving quickly but with stealth adapted from clearing houses in Afghanistan, she got the front door open and left it unlocked behind her. Greg called in on his radio that they had made entry to the house and the front door was unlocked for the back-up teams to make entry when they arrived. Incoming units were to arrive without lights or sirens, only the last unit on-scene would flash their lights and siren, and only once.
As soon as she showed them the body, Sherlock was circling the victim, on his knees beside the body.
coat. He hated Jim Moriarty, so very much, for so many different things. But deliberate vandalism of personal property was low, even for the criminal mastermind who had owned Sherlock’s livelihood for two years.  And he couldn’t do anything about it. He hated that. His plight was not unknown to people, but there wasn’t anything they could really do. The most his brother was capable of was keeping Moriarty from hurting Sherlock or exploiting him. But really, all Moriarty ever did was demand twenty-four hours of Sherlock’s time once every three months. Otherwise, he never bothered Sherlock or interfered with his business. Sherlock knew what he had to do and took the opportunity to procure a few necessary things before he went to get his coat back. He did research on the number and address listed and it came back to a man named John Watson. The pictures he got showed him the man he had met the other night at Quo Vadis, the man who had been their server. John Watson. He was handsome, Fey, and his history promised Sherlock a chance to free himself if he did this right. As he browsed a jewellery store that catered exclusively to Fey, Sherlock tried to convince himself that this wasn’t an act of suicidal desperation.
“I just don’t get it.” He let out a slow breath, “Suicide doesn’t seem like something Sherlock would do, you know?”
“Very sorry for all the trouble, Mrs H. Any chance we can come in out of the rain? It’s a bit wetter than we’d like out here.”
“Thanks, lads.” John smiled at the pair, who watched him pass them by. They were Fey, and Sherlock suspected they had marked his mate as one of their own kind, and not one to be underestimated. Sherlock kind of wanted to see someone do that, just to see what John did when people took him at face value and ignored what he was truly capable of. He got an idea of it when they ran into Sally Donovan at the line separating the rest of the scene from the house in question.
“You were there through it all and you’ll be there for the rest. You know, those vows have a completely different meaning for the likes of you and Lestrade, don’t they?”
panic attacks, he was too…organized, too strict for that kind of thing. He sighed and headed to the bar, god knew he needed a drink. Let Judith take care of Sherlock, and God bless her if she got him to talk. Bloody git was so wound up he wouldn't make much sense to someone who had no idea what they’d been up to. But Judith was a soldier, and she had probably seen things just as weird if not weirder than whatever was running around the moors after dark. He knew for sure they’d seen stranger things as sorcerers, and he wondered briefly how things were in New York. It had been a while since he’d heard from Stephen Strange, but he knew the brash American was doing well.
“Why should I care about some no-name who probably didn’t deserve being rescued in the first place? One less idiot to worry about.”
“I said that was amazing! That was...astonishing, even! How did you do that?” John was staring at him like he held the answer to every mystery in the universe and then some, like he was some deity among mortals.
When Mycroft Holmes arrived at Maroush Edgeware Road, he was only coming for one reason. At the moment, he was alone, but he knew better than to think it would remain that way for the evening and had reserved a table for himself and any one of a small circle of friends and acquaintances who would trickle in over the course of the next several hours as their work-schedules allowed. He shook the rain from his coat and umbrella, passing both off to a waiting server, who disappeared after handing him a ticket, which he put in his pocket as he looked around. The current number came to its end as he took his seat. As another song began, he paid attention to the dancers. They were all very pretty and of all body-types and racial heritage. They got along, he knew by the way they moved together among the tables.
Using a sling-portal, Judith travelled from London to New York. It was early morning in New York, roughly seven am, and she was desperately hoping that she wouldn’t be giving Stephen Strange a rude awakening. She hadn’t raised any alarms coming in and went to see if the Master of New York was awake yet or if she was about to give him a rude wake-up call. She
They must have wasted nearly three hours out on that balcony, drinking and smoking like the old friends they were. When they were down to dog-ends, they scraped out the fags, dumped the stubs in Sherlock’s glass, which had a half-sip of alcohol he had no interest in finishing anyway, and went inside to close their tabs. Then it was downstairs through a mass of humanity, Sherlock leading the way, John’s hand tight in his, out to the bustling street where he materialized a taxi, and John gave an address somewhere in…Baker Street?
John flexed and twisted his wrists, getting his left hand free, and reached up to touch. The noise Sherlock made when he ran his fingers through soft curls was adorable, and he smiled into the kiss. Not as easy as literature made it sound, but not impossible. That, of course, led to a break in the action and John took a deep breath.
“Are you going to take her in?” Greg asked from the street, where he was talking to Moran and the boys.
“I said. Put. The fucking. Gun. Down!” He huffed, his voice steady despite everything they’d just been through. Predictably, Lachey went absolutely still.
it was, when he was pulled from a restless sleep by a hand on his shoulder. He groaned and pressed one hand to his eyes.
“Well, that took long enough!” She snapped. “You were out on an ice-run, not a manhunt.” Then she happened to look over his shoulder. She missed the police at first, but not Sherlock. Her eyes widened and she turned white as a sheet.
“What happened? Claudia?” He nodded shakily, his whole body shaking with a quiet sob. The divorce had been scheduled to finalize today, which explained everything she and the boys had noticed.
“Are you real?” It was a stupid thing to ask, but he really wasn’t sure if this was actually happening in real time or if he was hallucinating.
“After you, Mr Holmes.” He rolled his eyes and got into the black car. As they got underway once Mycroft had given the driver instructions, John relaxed a bit. the leather seats were vented and it was very nice to be in one of Mycroft’s cars after his evening. He felt bad for his current state of being, but there was nothing for it.
“Cruella DeVil. Find her, fast.” He returned to his conversation with Greg, giving him the name of their suspect.
“Why don’t you boys go back to Baker Street tonight?” Timothy folded his arms after putting an arm around John’s shoulders, “Wanda and I would be more than happy to keep Rosie for you as long as we need to, we haven’t seen her in absolute ages.”
is the move.” He slid the right-hand pill across the table towards Sherlock with his right hand, then pulled his hand back and left the pill where it was.
“I’m going to keep my key, Mrs Hudson wouldn’t take it back when I offered. I will not return to Baker Street for a very long time, if I ever do. There is nothing for me there. My life was there, and to move on, I have to leave everything behind. Maybe someday, by some astronomical chance, I’ll go home.” John took a deep breath, this was not easy for him, “But without Sherlock, without your brother, I have nothing and I am no one. I’ve already shut down my blog and quit at the clinic. That was actually very easy, seeing as I hadn’t worked a decent day in six months. It was a mutual parting of ways, but I don’t think I will ever work as a doctor again.”
“That’s fair.” She sighed, “Well, good night to you, Inspector.” As she pushed away from the car, prepared to walk all night if she had to, some part of her desperately wished he would ask her to stay the night at his. It was a stupid thing to wish, really, but…she kind of liked him.
“So what d’you think? Shall we?” Still holding his gaze, Sherlock slowly sank back down onto his chair.
For a minute he thought Lachey would do as told, but John wasn’t terribly surprised when he instead swung around on him. There was a struggle and John fought to get the gun away from Lachey. He lost his gun in the tussle, but John managed to get the upper hand and recovered his Glock when Sherlock skidded it across the concrete to him while he was on his knees. Fingers tight around the grip of his gun, he lunged to his feet and swept the Colt out of the suspect’s hand. It clattered against the concrete behind them and he put Lachey into a headlock as he pressed the muzzle of his gun to the man's temple.
“So sorry about that, love, looks like you’ve already got your hands full today.” Meaning the rows of gurneys along the walls. “By the way, where’s Sherlock?”
“And your face is tanned, so you’ve been abroad, but not sunbathing. At least not recently. But why would you leave the Army? Not because you did anything wrong, so … honourable discharge?”  Sherlock was more or less talking to himself, and John let him talk. “How would a soldier get that kind of discharge? Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action, suntan – Afghanistan or Iraq.”
here full-time, of course, but … well, having a safe-house is always nice.” He looked around the small place he had lived in for so long but had never quite felt like home.
“Oh, god, thank you.” He heaved a sigh of relief and made sure he had his wallet and the card. He had both, so off they went. The water was calm, so the trip down didn’t take too long. When they tied up at the ferry docks, he was relieved to find a taxi waiting. He handed the driver the card and told him where to go, “I need to go there.”
.” Judith walked through the sling-portal from The Crossed Keys to Mount Everest. As the portal closed behind her, he looked at Greg, who eyed the closed portal warily.
“John!” He choked, reaching for his mate. He caught John’s hand and held on, “Don’t…don’t let him take me!”
“I don’t need luck, Mike.” He said as he followed Lestrade out of the Morgue. “Everyone else in London, though? Yeah, they might need some.” Lestrade snorted as he held the door for John. What did he think he knew about John, they’d only met once before this.
Things came to a head, finally, when the camp commanders dragged the suits to the hospital tents. She was out making rounds when they came in. Otherwise, Judith would have been cornered in her office, hiding out and waiting for the inevitable. She gave herself a once-over, and without thinking twice, she tore off the disposable scrub-gown and bundled it, and the gloves, into a nearby bin, taking a minute to wash her hands. Her last patient hadn’t been a wounded soldier, but a local woman. She was grateful for that break in the gruesome parade of casualties.
“You make the slightest move towards that phone, I’ll kill yer.” The cabbie snapped, trying to sound menacing. It didn’t work very well. Sherlock was a clever man, a detective, a government agent. Very little legitimately frightened him anymore.
“You didn’t just kill five people because you’re bitter. Bitterness is a paralytic. Love is a much more vicious motivator. Somehow this is about your family.” Sherlock held the pill to the light, squinting, “But
So, what was he doing here? At Hoot Club at eight o’clock on a Wednesday night? It was a strange venue, catering to the LGBTQ community of London, and he could see patrons clustering on the patio and balconies, everything from businessmen and politicos dressed in his brother’s pretentious three-piece affairs to uni students and forty-somethings in crisis wearing torn denims and faded band-shirts and leather or denim jackets. He didn’t see anyone he recognized right away, but as he walked away from the venue, passing under one of the balconies, he heard a familiar laugh and froze. He knew that laugh, he knew what it took to make that man laugh just like that, what he looked like when he did.
! Thank you!” He lifted his right hand as if to embrace Sherlock, but then lowered it and offered it to him to shake instead. “Sherlock Holmes.” They both looked down at the offered hand, then Sherlock slowly raised his own right hand and took it.
“Greg.” He shot his future brother-in-law a sly grin, “So, I don’t need to ask what kind of trouble brought you out to Dartmoor.”
surprised to find him passed out on the stairs. Then again, it took an awful lot to surprise his landlady, god bless her.
“Can’t have you starving on the job now, can I? Wouldn’t do for that.” Angelo scolded as he handed over the bag of food, “How’s your brother?”
“That's good enough. I thought I should ask before assuming, despite the ready offer.” Sherlock said with a shrug. “Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.”
It made him miss Sherlock so much more seeing Robby and Hutchison together and he located his phone, opening his photo albums to find a picture of him with Sherlock. It was actually the last picture he had of the two of them together, taken by Greg at a Pub Night with The Met after successfully closing a difficult case. It was the last time he had seen Sherlock alive, that three-am phone-call had come two days later. He’d spent the night at Baker Street, telling Mary he’d been too drunk to drive home from London that night, and Sherlock had asked him for sex. It hadn’t been their first time, but it had been wonderful. At least he had fond memories to remember Sherlock by, if not rather explicit ones.
Sherlock was already out the door. “You can call it. ‘It’s elementary, My dear Watson.’ Because it always is. That way it could be true for once” he called out, skipping steps down the stairs. He stopped at the landing and turned and looked up at John, who was just at the door, stuffing the keys in his trouser pocket. “And, I have a website
he thought. The library was unsurprisingly empty, with the few book-readers who still used the library, renting out books to read in the sun.  John turned back to Sherlock and asked, “Could have used a stepladder or chair?”
Sherlock was startled for a second but narrowed his eyes. He didn’t say anything. John stammered in surprise “Who…? You?.. You are the man in the papers… The one capable of vanishing apparently?”
The man replied, “No, I saw you on TV. I’m fascinated by your relationship, you know. I wish Wong was more like you John. He doesn’t seem to have your sense of humor”.
Sherlock looked up, considered it for half a second. He quickly then removed his goggles. “You know what? I am. Come on John.”
They were out of the library and Sherlock decided to walk home. The cab ride with the stop-start traffic on their way to the library had been just unbearable. Not exactly a conducive environment for thinking. John followed him; a few steps behind.
The mysterious man casually replied, his hands at his back “Uhm, yes. Vanishing is one of the many things I do, apart from being quirky and saving the universe. And I must say, I am really a great fan of your adventures. Well, most of them. The one with the banker and the Chinese smuggling group wasn’t as interesting as I hoped it would be.” He had an american accent but one could hint a tad of british behind it.
“No, wait, Not a fight.” Sherlock continued “There are surgical marks. You have had rods implanted in your fingers. In both hands. No amount of fighting would sustain such damage unless you punched something heavy with both hands. That seems quite foolish, even you wouldn’t be that daft. Accident of some sort then. And of course, you seem to have mastered the art of fooling everyone with your so-called magic skills.”
floor. The aisles were bounded by tall shelves right in the middle of the enormous hall, each about 12 feet high. Large windows, with sliding glass windows over a protective iron grill, illuminated the whole hall. At the far end of the hall, after all the shelves were a series of desks, each with a small lamp and privacy dividers. There was only one person at the desks. He was pouring over a huge text, his head resting on his shoulder. Around him were many other equally fat books, some open, some stacked up. ‘
“Did you steal that story out of a comic book” Sherlock asked, with a sly smile of his own. The story had felt a bit over the top, but the man seemed to be telling the truth. Moreover, stranger things existed in the world as he had recently discovered.
In the rather cramped apartment at 221-B Baker street however, the mood was rather fractured. The single window facing the street was open, being the sole source of light in the entire apartment. The residual smell of gunpowder in the air was slowly being overpowered by something distressing, as a bored Sherlock had suddenly decided to microwave human eyes to find an answer to a question absolutely no one had ever asked for. John was in the couch, his back towards the window, reading the paper, completely impervious to the nauseating smell of boiling flesh and the disturbing hissing from the microwave in the kitchen.
wrong why don’t you?” The dark-haired man chuckled, not at all upset by Judith’s uncharacteristic and unexpected outburst.
“No.” She smiled and picked up her phone as it buzzed. “Oh, it’s John. Wonder what he wants this early.” She swiped into the incoming call.
“Happily, dear.” Sherlock got the cat, apparently named Queenie now, situated and grabbed hold of her duty-belt to pull her out of the squad-car. Once she had her feet under her, she took her notebook back and flipped to the page she’s written the cab’s information on.
“Oh, lucky you.” An eyebrow went up at that. Not many people in John’s particular line of work got to retire like this, quiet-like and still living.
When he had hauled Sherlock out of a flop-house in Brixton three days before he was due to ship out with the Army, backed up by Mycroft, it had broken his heart to see Sherlock so low and so desperate for relief he had turned to drugs. But he had gotten a promise out of Sherlock to get clean and
“I’ll get Moran. He’ll be easier to find.” John growled, opening a portal to a different part of the building, “You get Moriarty. If he’s gone, just come back, Sherlock.”
“Give you something to think about.” She smiled and wiggled her fingers as she stood back to let Sally pull away. As soon as the squad-car was out of sight, she got into the house and ran upstairs.
far back, Seb.” The dark-haired one murmured, “Put her to ease before she hurts something, will you? Or someone.”
“Did it for us, Mrs Hudson. Every awful thing was for us.” John sighed and got to his feet, a slow process, reaching out one hand to Sherlock. “Come on, you, we are not sleeping out here.”
this fucker, I’ll pay you twice the Agency’s rate!” John and Sherlock looked at each other. There was no way that would ever happen, but they understood the sentiment.
“No you won’t!” Jim’s voice was high-pitched and sing-song as he opened the door Judith had come out of earlier. The red glow of the sniper-sights disappeared then, letting them breathe a bit easier.
Desperate to set things right with recent history, Judith seeks out help from one of the only people she knows of who could possibly be able to alter time. It's not exactly like rewinding the clock on the destruction of Hong Kong, but it's close. It's closer to home, closer to the heart.
“Well, I don’t think theirs are anything spectacular, but it’ll do the trick alright.” He smiled, “Let’s get home and eat.”
“We’ve both had two pints and the last thing I need is either of us getting pulled by one of your lot for driving drunk.”
It was about another half an hour before anything happened, and she had dozed off when Greg suddenly shook her awake.
“I’ve endured far worse than snapping from you, Judith Watson, and I’ve the scars to prove it.” It wasn’t often he genuinely smiled, but he did now as he got her up and pushed her towards the stairs. Greg was right behind her, naturally, and steered her into the bedroom at the left of the stairs when they got to the third floor.
his fault, for once, as hard as he was on his equipment and as much as Q complained about his uncanny ability to destroy just about anything they put in his hands. No one was dumb enough to steal Bond’s car, but apparently, John’s was fair game and it had ended up in several pieces of twisted wreckage after another one of the 00s had “borrowed” the car for a bit of a joyride last year. He had
Here we meet Mary, for the VERY brief time she's part of the story. I honestly don't have a clue what happens to her, I just know she's "taken care of" before she causes trouble for the boys. Obviously, they haven't gone public with Sherlock's return from the dead, but that's coming. There's two cases here, the first one's pretty quickly solved, it's the second one I spend time with. This is where the crossover with 101 Dalmatians begins, so pay attention here.
the police.” Sherlock looked across to the phone. That was either Lestrade calling, or it was Judith. Possibly John,
“So what?” she seemed to say. He chuckled and looked around the sitting-room. The wall behind the couch was apparently a staging-area for paperwork pertaining to certain cases. It was a mess of photographs, print-outs, handwritten notes, newspaper articles, maps, and a web of string connecting everything, but it didn’t quite make sense to him on first glance.
“Me, too.” He sighed and took John’s hand. The bed was as large and soft as he remembered, the mattress felt too squishy to be the one he’d slept on before 2011, but it was familiar. It didn’t take long to get situated, and he found himself in a very familiar, very comfortable position. Whatever John did with MI6 kept him in excellent physical condition, he was missing much of the softness he had acquired living with Sherlock after leaving the Army. Sherlock made note of old curves and new ones, found new scars in new places, badges of honourable service in the name of The Crown. Touching led to kissing, kissing led to other more interesting, more intimate activities, and Sherlock revelled in the sound of his name uttered in soft gasps and curses.
“And do feel free to pop by mine whenever you’re in the neighbourhood, the cats would love some company.”
Judith had fallen asleep on the drive down from Bayswater, and he quietly shook her awake as he got out of the taxi and paid the fare. She slid out of the taxi and he reached out one hand to steady her.
completely to see the moment it had happened. Sherlock had tried to take the gun from Moriarty and only succeeded in getting himself shot.
As soon as the cab had pulled away, Judith looked up somewhere to take the animals. But none of the shelters were open and she didn’t want to drive out to Holloway to drop them off at Harmsworth Memorial Animal Hospital. She groaned and put her head down on the steering-wheel. The kittens mewled pitifully, she guessed they were hungry. The queen, a gorgeous silver tabby Maine Coon, climbed into her lap and rubbed against her, purring.
“And you have too much time on your hands.” He said drolly, “Go start a war or something if you’re really that bored.”
“Hm. I have better things to do with my time than search the warrens of the hospital’s underbelly looking for someone.” He really didn’t, but Mike didn’t have to know that. This was the most exciting thing he’d done since that brawl two nights ago.
“No, it’s not.” She closed her eyes, “You’re spectacular and gifted, Sherlock, never mind what anyone else says about you.”
“Well, someone’s got to look after you boys, and you won’t be arsed to do it yourselves! Might as well be me!” She just smiled and patted John on the cheek, “You’re a good boy, John Watson. You look after this one, he’s stubborn.”
“Mm, yeah.” John made a face and shuffled his feet. They’d lost track of John during his recovery, he had dropped off the radar for a while before resurfacing in London in far better condition than he’d been in when he left, and they still didn’t know where he’d gone or what he’d done. Judith knew, but no one else knew. But he was able to run after Sherlock, so they weren’t going to question a bit of physical soundness. Judith smiled and they watched John go back inside.
“I can handle stubborn, Mrs Hudson. Twenty years in the army, five of that with Intelligence, I think I can handle Sherlock Holmes just fine.” John shrugged, letting her dote on him a bit. She fussed with his coat, paying attention to the pelt lining his hood.
“He knows there’s something not quite on, but he keeps his nose out of my business unless I ask him.”
leaving tonight! Come on! The sooner we get there, the sooner we can celebrate this little milestone of yours! A
someone at her bedside, even outside of regular visiting-hours. He was the most consistent visitor, John and Sherlock were also very regular, and he had seen Sebastian Moran twice.
“Ugh. You Holmes boys are impossible! That’s not regulation and you know it!” Judith shook her head, “You know today was supposed to be my day off!”
“That’s going to require dessert.” He grinned, “I would say a bottle of wine, but I think I’ve done enough drinking for a while.”
“A moment, sir.” She turned to another page, “Interesting. I didn’t think I’d gotten anyone’s attention quite that high on the chain of command, but that’s that.”
“Hello, Lucifer.” Sebastian Moran grinned at Judith, “Still busy making trouble for the baddies, are we?”
an outside opinion, sir?” The man, outfitted in blue, asked, having overheard that bit of conversation.
While the boys finished shutting down the flat, Judith got ready for bed. She sat cross-legged on the bed while the boys went through their nightly routine, wondering if Greg had made any headway with Hope. His only text had been a quick one, which meant he was probably going to be up all night.
It was not unusual to find her Rover sitting outside of Baker Street on the days she ran street-patrols. She had taken to spending her time there waiting for calls to come in, and no one upstairs really minded or said anything if they did. Roben
“Must be! We’ll find out soon!” He radioed down to the units patrolling the streets of Risby and got word back that they had also spotted the dogs. Swinging around, he landed the chopper just outside of Risby after doing a low pass over the dogs to make sure it
“What can I say? Magic fingers.” He just grinned at her and wiggled his fingers, “Imagine what I could do with an hour.”
“You’re not sleeping out here, or up in my old room.” John heaved to his feet, heading for the back bedroom, “Come on, girls. Sherlock, you too.”
Greg wouldn’t stop staring at her like it was the first time he was really seeing her, and honestly, it might have been. He had spent all this time living with her and gotten comfortable with a routine that had been shaken when she disappeared for a week. When she had returned, resurfacing right in the middle of Central London, everyone in her small circle except John had been shocked to see her healthy and unharmed. Mycroft had even admitted that there had been a fear of kidnapping, which had turned out to be unfounded.
It took her fifteen minutes to get up to Marylebone, and she had lights and sirens going by the time she reached Baker Street. She saw another car ahead of her and knew Greg had beaten her. Thank god it was his team tonight, she hadn’t even put in a request for it. They just needed Homicide and their consulting duo. Badly. She was in such a hurry she almost forgot to close her doors. Judith didn’t bother to lock the car as she slammed through the front door and ran up the stairs to 221B, completely ignoring Mrs. Hudson, who stood at the bottom with a startled expression on her face. Halfway up, she stopped and look over the railing.
“I’m all ears if you think you have something worth my time.” He took a bite of his starter, which was delicious.
“Probably before you want to see me, Inspector. Have a good night.” John smiled and climbed the ladder, clearing the line at the top with a nod to the Constable now manning it as he made his way back towards the road. Getting a taxi would be a bit of a trick, but he wasn’t up to bothering Mycroft again. But of course Mycroft wasn’t going to let him get away with that, so when he saw the waiting car, the driver standing by the open door, he just got in. He didn’t even have to tell them where to go, which was nice.
“Come along, Gregory.” Mycroft smiled and held the door for the DI who kept his brother out of trouble most of the time.
“Suppose we’d better show ourselves, yeah?” He looked over his shoulder at Sherlock, who stood in the kitchen doorway, messing with his shirt-cuffs. John chuckled and went to help him. “Stop worrying, you knew this was going to happen.”
“Do you recognize this woman?” He typed a name into the Google browser and waited for results. When he got a hit, he turned the screen, “Her. Do you know who that is?”
After a while, she started humming a slow, slightly sad certain tune. She knew the song in two languages, in English and in Gaelic, but didn’t sing it often.
By the time he got back to the resort, it was nearly five. He saw the boats coming in and ran back to the room after thanking Bix, who had driven him down to Spanish Town, and paying him for the trouble even though he said he didn’t need anything.
“How do you…wait, no. I don’t want to know.” She got up hesitantly. Anyone who knew her first name without her saying it, who knew she had served in the Army and retired out at Lieutenant-Colonel, was someone to be handled carefully. “Who are you?”
“Well, in the interest of full disclosure, Judith, you might want to read this.” Mycroft slid an envelope under her hand.
“Absolutely! She’d never forgive us if we left her out!” He smiled, “She’s been wanting a dog for years.”
“That’s Sherlock Holmes for you.” She chuckled, “You know, that kind of thing throws people off when you do it in front of them, right?”
Six people within earshot of them gasped and recoiled. Judith remained calm by virtue of fifteen years in the Army and the knowledge that as gratifying as it would be to chin Anderson and lay him out, it would only result in disciplinary action on her behalf and she had a clean record so far. She wanted to keep it that way. She narrowed her eyes at him and clenched her teeth so hard they scraped against each other.
“I’m a Detective Constable with The Metropolitan Police Service. My brother’s a doctor, currently out of work by his own choice.”
“There’s a name no-one says, an’ I’m not gonna say it either.” Sheer defiance, not that Sherlock had expected anything else, “Now, enough chatter.”
“He was more than that, son.” He sighed and rubbed his eyes, “Jesus Christ, he was so much more than that.”
“No such thing.” Sherlock smiled and leaned in until they were practically touching. Before John could say another word, draw breath, he kissed him, right on the tip of the nose, and was gone out the door to the bedroom. John blinked in alarm and turned.
“Hold you to that, Mick.” He squeezed the server’s elbow and smiled at her before slipping around her and making his way upstairs. He took the opportunity to calm himself and brace for what was going to be a very trying, unpleasant evening. Once he was upstairs in the Blue Room, it didn’t take him very long to find the right table, and he groaned under his breath as he recognized Jim Moriarty right away. Slick and neatly-dressed as always, dressed to kill if John really wanted to get technical. He suppressed a shudder and cleared his throat as he approached the isolated corner table, putting on a passably friendly smile.
think this is the only choice you have, Sherlock.” He said softly, bending to kiss the scar. “Never.”
“Christ.” Judith rested on her haunches after discerning the victim’s state, “We need Homicide. Call Dispatch.”
A week later, they were summoned back to London. The dognappers had struck again, and this time, the owners had called Scotland Yard. That was how they found themselves in Gabriel Gate Mews in Lambeth knocking on the door of a nondescript, quaint house that apparently belonged to the heartbroken owners of the last fifteen puppies that had been stolen. As they waited outside, John looked at Sherlock.
“Not at all.” Said with a sly smile and in a smooth motion, Sherlock rose to his feet, water cascading from his skin like rain. John stared. He couldn’t help it. It was the first proper look he got of Sherlock. Skinny, yes, but not skeletal, not unhealthy. Tall, with dark, curly hair, pale smooth skin, nearly fucking hairless for that matter! Lucky bastard.
“It’s home enough.” Sherlock closed the door behind him with a bit more force than John thought was necessary, nearly slamming it. “Mrs Hudson!”
“Boring! I could have got them anywhere.” He nonchalantly tossed the stick into the pool, leaving Sherlock and the other two in shock.
one knows who contracted that hit.” Sherlock frowned at him as he ran for his laptop, “What are you doing?”
“Alright, now no deducing these people right out of the gate, they’re not going to appreciate you being yourself.”
person would notice. Sherlock, trained to pick up wavers, tone-changes, and inflections, heard a slight change of pitch. A slight hitch in the breath-pattern.
“Yes, ma’am!” The pair saluted shakily. It was very clear that tonight was a bad night to question their superiors, more than a few jobs were at stake tonight. Judith and Sally were on the short-list, with Greg one step ahead of them. Satisfied that things were under control at Riley’s house, Judith returned to the Rover and made a call to Mycroft.
wore “normal” clothes, never the unusual outfits favoured by her peers in Kamar-Taj. He recognized the tall frame of Stephen Strange and heaved a sigh of relief.  It was interesting to see the Watsons with Strange, but it was very clear that they were comfortable not only with the arrogant yet charming ex-surgeon but with their budding skills.
“I am not. Stop squirming or so help me I will break your arm.” He grunted. It wasn’t long before they were surrounded, and John was happy to let the locals have the bastard. They looked at the handcuffs and at each other before turning to John, eyes wide.
The cabbie reached out and slid the left-hand pill across the table while pulling the right-hand one back towards himself. Releasing the left-hand one, he picked up the other pill and looked at Sherlock.
“Told you. Octopus.” John murmured sleepily, “Give him an elbow if he gets too clingy, he’ll back off a bit.”
“It’s a bloody two-way street, son,” John said carefully, his voice dangerously calm. “But I suppose you do as you bloody well please, don’t you? Always have, always will. Get yourself killed in some filthy back-alley in Islington and who’s going to miss you?”
“Major Moran! Oh my god!” She shot across the bench and nearly knocked her former commanding officer out of his seat, “What are
“What breed should we get, do you think?” He turned so he and Sherlock faced each other. He wanted to see Sherlock’s face, see what he was thinking.
“Oh, I see.” Sherlock slurred his words, keeping his head down, it seemed to hurt less that way, as he pointed a finger towards the cabbie, “So you’re a proper genius too.”
Just before noon, things started happening. Judith was walking a short patrol when she suddenly saw John come tearing out of the hospital in a fit. She had picked up a call over the radio for shots fired on Baker Street, so she had a pretty good idea where he was going.
“Not usually.” She pulled out into traffic after clearing the gates on Dacre Street. “Don’t worry about me, worry about the rest of them.” She merged and kept her eyes open for trouble.
When they got to Saint Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, he parked outside the A&E Department and they went inside. At the desk, he showed his badge and asked for Watson. They were directed to the proper department and in a waiting-room, they found a surprising number of people gathered.
“Getting away from your British doppelganger. He’s being a prat right now and I don’t need to put up with it.” She leaned her head back and smiled at Stephen Strange, who didn’t look much different from that last time she’d actually seen him, “Been a while, yeah?”
After walking the grounds of the hospital together for a while, they returned to Judith’s room to find that John had arrived. He stood outside with Sherlock, chatting in low tones. It didn’t seem anything had changed while he and Strange had been out, but that was alright. Strange didn’t stay much longer, of course, but Greg had the feeling it wasn’t the last he’d see of the unusual man. After a few words with John and Sherlock, Greg took the bedside-watch and waited for Judith to wake up. Or at least until he got another call and had a reason to go back to work. Even if he didn’t want to.
.” He muttered and looped the loose chain between their hand-cuffs around his wrist. “Take my hand.”
“God damn it, Sherlock!” he muttered, looking around. He’d lost the man on Suffolk Place and had to double-back. Retracing his steps, he managed to pick up the trail on Haymarket and broke into a run. Taking a sharp right onto Orange Street, he cut left again at Oxendon Street and skidded. The street was packed with people and he cursed under his breath. Of course, this was the after-theatre crowd. Then, over by the entrance to the parking garage directly across from the theatre, John spotted a familiar tall figure going inside.
It was a quiet drive from the restaurant to Lestrade’s Pembroke Mews flat, and by the time they arrived, John and Judith had fallen asleep. It didn’t take much to rouse the twins and he waited by the car until Anthea returned with Lestrade’s unmarked squad-car and the ground-floor lights went out. Time to go home. In all, it had been a successful night and a very busy day. Nothing too terrible. He would sleep well that night, Mycroft thought even as he brushed glitter from his collar. Judith and Riyah had been very careful, very sparing, but the look on Sherlock’s face when the glitter hit his hair would stay in Mycroft’s mind for days. It was a mild annoyance and resignation that it wouldn't be anytime soon the glitter washed out. They all had come home with glitter in their hair and on their clothes, but for Mycroft, it was one of Judith’s signs of affection towards friends and loved ones.
you. And since you no longer have your precious coat, you’ll never be free!” Moriarty snarled, eyes blazing with malice that Sherlock felt in his gut.
Unfortunately, John didn’t take being without any sort of direction very well, he never had, and “wherever I end up” found him sitting in a smoky, crowded pub four days later, bleary-eyed and staring down the remains of his current libation. He didn’t look much like a government agent licensed to kill, but that was okay with him. He
John's gotten himself into a bit of trouble, but there's always one person who will be willing to get him out again and offer him an alternative, something to give him direction and keep him busy.
Despite her posting to CID as a Detective Constable, Judith was still running street-patrols. It was part of her job description, she realized, and made sure to thank Mycroft and M for working her old responsibilities into her new contract. She was assigned the Range Rover she had driven the night she had taken down Jefferson Hope for patrol and transport duties, which she appreciated. She liked the Rover more than the estate car she’d driven as a Special Constable, it was more her style and comfort level.
“Well, I saw him last at Baker Street, before he ran with Watson, and I think I’m one of the only people who knows how he got this scar.” Molly quietly turned Sherlock’s head and Greg pointed out a faint scar under his left jaw. Roben nodded, satisfied, and Greg signalled Molly to close the bag again. The second bag contained the corpse of James Moriarty, for whom Greg felt a special breed of hate.
“Best way to quiet a spinning mind.” Moriarty smiled and one hand touched the soft underside of her jaw, “Hold still, lovely.” Judith had enough time to look at Moran for help, but it was clear he thought this was alright. She trusted Moran, more than she knew she should. Judith was completely distracted when Moriarty kissed her.
“Why on earth would we be arresting Sherlock Holmes?” Lestrade hissed, looking at Moriarty like he'd lost his mind. “I'm not about to put my best resource in handcuffs without a good fucking reason, Mr Moriarty.”
“Of course.” Magnus slid a note-pad across the counter to him and he scribbled down three words, careful to make sure they were legible: Mo Anam Cara. Gaelic for My Soul Mate. Handing the note-pad to Magnus, he let out the breath he hadn’t been aware of holding.
“That’s what I thought you said.” John was careful to keep his tone neutral, any blatant interest well-concealed. “How could I meet him?”
After a few months, he popped up on CCTV in Trafalgar Square, and again on Vauxhall Bridge. It was obvious he’d been out of the country, but with no credit-card to track, there was no telling where he’d been. It was a very different John Watson who returned to London from Gods alone knew where, and after following him by camera and spook for two weeks, which he was surprisingly allowed to do without any fuss, Mycroft lost track of him again. This kept up for a long while, John resurfacing for a few days before disappearing again. Never a word was spoken, just a quick nod to a camera before he ducked into a crowd or dark alleyway and vanished like a ghost.
It was getting dark when she turned onto Lauriston Gardens. It was quiet on the street, and she circled the block for another run. The hairs on the back of her neck were starting to stand up, so she drove down Brixton Road to Brixton Police Station, where she checked in for any calls she might have missed. They didn’t have anything for her, so she set out again, focusing her efforts on Lauriston Gardens. Parking on one side of the street, she sat quiet and kept her eyes open for any sign of suspicious activity.
“He’s going home.” Mycroft groaned. Did John know somehow? Had he worked out the lies for himself and learned that Sherlock was alive? Not a man of religion, Mycroft Holmes found himself praying for forgiveness. And for peace. Not just for himself, but for Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.
“I thought you were in New York.” She sounded dazed, sad, “Stephen, I need your help. I need you to…Christ.”
“Talked to the owners, tagged it to the poaching case at London Zoo a couple months back. Same collector.”
Judith and Sally patrolled the hospital inside and outside alike, keeping eyes on the boys and looking out for any sign of Moriarty’s people. Judith touched base with Moran, who clarified that he had been with Moriarty all night the previous night. That just made her angry regarding poor Richard Brook.
“I don’t need to know their name, all I need to know is that they were wronged by someone they trusted and because of that they were dead.” He shrugged, rubbing his left shoulder. “I saw more sexual and gender-biased crime in the Middle East than I want to remember, so I knew what I was looking at when I saw Ranger’s body.”
“Gotcha!” Jim chuckled as Judith released her grip on him and stepped back, holding her hands up to signal the snipers that she wouldn't try anything else. Jim glanced round at her, then turned back towards Sherlock while brushing his hands down his suit to straighten it. He lowered his hands and stood calmly in front of Sherlock.
Going back to the pair of trailers, she went into the one on the right after finding the door unlocked. She didn’t bother announcing herself, something told her it was an unnecessary precaution, moving slowly with her pistol in one hand and her torch in the other. She came into the room at the far end of the trailer and paused.
“I certainly plan on it, Inspector.” She shook hands with him, “I’ll be working with Mr Holmes now, so I suspect we’ll see more of each other.”
“As always, Gregory.” Mycroft was his usual polite, pleasant self, but it was an easier attitude than he had with most outsiders. Definitely not strangers. Judith tried to keep her mouth from hanging open as she looked around the house.
“You and me both, I guess. I thought I recognised you.” She shook her head, “But what were the astronomical chances of you and I ever meeting again all these years later? I was thirteen, you were ten.”
“Aneurysm.” The cabbie lifted his right hand and tapped the side of his head. “Right in ’ere. Any breath could be my last. It’s your only ’ope, Mr ’olmes. Bet on the aneurysm.”
in putting stuffy senior officers in their proper places, but this once, she didn’t mind giving Barrymore something to worry about.
“A pen. This is a Class 4 grenade.” Q said, taking the pen from where John had left it after his own initial inspection. “Three clicks arms the four-second fuse, another three disarms it.”
“How long will it take to get to Spanish Town and back?” He heard voices and realized that the practical half of the test was about to get under-way. Judith caught sight of him by the water-sports shack and peeled off.
pocket?” Oh, she was smart alright. Not that Greg was surprised. He chuckled and let go of her long enough to fish the box out of his pocket.
, specifically, to another island!” She grinned at him, “Oh, god, I never thought I’d get to come back here!”
“By no means. As long as you’re smart about it.” John shook his head. “No leaving things about where they don’t belong.”
Five minutes later, they were parked along the kerb and heading through the doors of Maroush. Judith pulled off and pocketed her beret as she stepped into the restaurant and leant her head back, taking a deep breath.
for, Judith?” Sherlock stood by the door, “You remembered something you saw earlier tonight. What was it?”
One of the lead dancers, an absolutely gorgeous Amazon with caramel skin, wavy black hair, and eyes like quicksilver, approached their table. There was some elbowing and chuckling and teasing as their company took bets on which among them would be the unfortunate sacrifice to the mild humiliations of the stage. Judith was quick to deduce her purpose and raised an eyebrow as she took another sip of her beer, maintaining a passably straight face. Someone had passed word to the people that mattered here and she had a damn good idea who. As the tall dancer, a girl named Riyah, approached Judith’s side of the table, there was a murmur among their group. Lestrade watched with an unusual intensity, prepared to step in on her behalf if necessary. Judith signalled him to stay put, using hand-signs they had learned in the Army. He nodded, leant back, relaxed, and picked up his beer again. She was in no danger, and any trouble that might arise was nothing she couldn’t handle by herself. He would know if she required intervention. Taking Riyah’s hand, she got to her feet and turned to her highly-interested table-mates.
that? Was she just that petty and jealous and vindictive? Apparently. But this time, they had managed to duck and now Mary would no longer trouble them.
unusual, and what got her attention when she walked the length of the fences, was that a side-gate was unlocked when, by safety-regulations, all entrances to build-sites had be clearly-marked and locked against trespassing after dark or off-hours. So finding a door ajar was bad. Flicking open the holster for her Taser, forgoing reaching for her Browning just momentarily, she shouldered the door open and called in to Dispatch that she was investigating a suspicious incident in Soho. She got the usual warning to be alert and call in again if she needed back-up.
It was gone seven the next evening before they heard from anyone, and it was Greg who showed up with his car and a squad-car in tow. They had warrants and a potential lead.
“No, he won’t. He can’t now. If he asks, simply explain that you met me. He will not question further. And if he does, you know what to tell him?”
“Called me an idiot, though.” Not an ounce of heat or hate behind those words. Sherlock chuckled, a broken sound that got stuck in his throat as John shook two cigarettes loose and put one between his teeth before handing the other one to Sherlock.
“What are the names of your children, Mr. Hope?” Judith looked over her shoulder at Greg. She could see the wheels turning in his head. Hope pulled a picture from his wallet and slid it across the table.
“Sorry, sir. I was, er, pushed off my feet.” John was drunk and frustrated, but not stupid, and blinked. The man he’d been shoved into narrowed beady eyes at him and closed one hand around John’s collar. Well, shit.
“That’s a bit unfair, don’t you think?” Judith was aware that Sherlock wasn’t really popular in The Met, but this kind of hostility was a little uncalled for. “I mean, maybe Holmes is a bit of a pain in the arse more than he’s helpful, but Hughes knows what he’s doing, yeah?”
“Well, then, you’ll want to give her one of these.” Magnus stopped him and held up a small display-tray. There were only a few rings on it, and he recognized them right away.
“No, not at all.” Judith smiled and finally got the contact she’d been wanting since she’d followed him home to New York from Mount Everest. “Christ you’re good at that!” She murmured as they broke apart to catch their breath. He chuckled and played with the collar of her smock.
There was a muffled conversation and Judith folded her arms across her chest, watching his body language. He was being offered work, if she had to guess, but not with MI6. After a short conversation, he hung up and pocketed his phone, turning to Judith with a goofy smile.
“Autopsy hasn’t been done yet. The case came in right before we found ourselves up against Mr Lachey last night.”
“Absolutely. And I think we’d better make sure we close Mrs Hudson’s door or she might have some cross words for us.”
“Oh my god.” He looked from Sherlock to Ford, “So, I know he’s William Sherlock Scott, what did you get stuck with, then?”
“Then come along!” He just smiled at John and headed downstairs. There was a muttering and some expletives as John struggled into his parka, but it was no time at all before the Sith was was at his side.
“Well, well, well. If it isn’t the dishonourable Baker Street Boys.” One eyebrow went up and a muscle in his jaw twitched, “Thought the both of you would be dead and buried by now. Never thought you’d turn up on a scene.”
Greg Lestrade has known Judith Watson for nine years, has been in a relationship of some breed with her for almost a year, and yet, he has never had a chance to see her outside of anything remotely related to work. Maybe a holiday is in order?
He still remembered getting that awful phone-call, at three in the morning, Mycroft Holmes’s voice informing him in soft, broken tones that his brother had been found dead in the Baker Street sitting-room. There had been some sort of struggle, someone had broken into the house. Mrs Hudson was just fine, but terribly shaken up by the whole thing. Sherlock…was not. John had rushed over from the house he shared with Mary in Hounslow and arrived at Baker Street to find the place swarming with police cars and ambulances. The last time he’d seen that many uniforms at the house had been in 2011, right before Sherlock had faked his own death as part of an elaborate and surprisingly successful scheme to take apart Jim Moriarty’s post-mortem network. He would never forget Mycroft and Greg Lestrade trying to keep him out of the house, away from the body, but he’d gotten past them and stormed upstairs to the flat he’d once shared with Sherlock Holmes, and found Sherlock on the floor, dead.
Getting airborne was easy, the co-pilot did most of the work, but once they were up at altitude, he took over. The nighttime cityscape of London spread out beneath them in a network of lights, which dropped away to darkness speckled with occasional glimpses of lights below as they flew over villages, towns, and hamlets in the countryside. As they cleared the borders of Suffolk, he dropped altitude and switched on the search-lights, recalibrating the FLIR cameras. As they cleared the borders of Suffolk, he dropped altitude and switched on the search-lights, recalibrating the FLIR cameras.
“This is a new place to her and you’re a complete stranger. I can’t imagine what you did to startle her.” John sat down in the red chair, Kitty on his lap. “Did you accidentally step on her tail or sit on her?”
“Oh, no you’re not! Here, follow me!” The clerk came around the desk after a whispered word to her coworker, who’s eyes lit up, and he tagged along tamely until they reached the tiny gift-shop. It wasn’t perfect, but he crossed his fingers he would find something there that would do the trick. It was Friday, which meant that Judith would be getting her certification in a ceremony at five, and if he knew Judith, which he did, she would complete the course-work and spend the rest of the day honing her skills. So that gave him tonight, tomorrow on their morning run, or tomorrow night on the Stargazing Cruise.
, Jude.” Donovan said quietly, blowing steam off the rim of her cup, “You shouldn’t be expected to remember that far back.” A few of the family left after a bit, going to the hospital to make sure Timothy didn’t try to skip town before the police got him into custody, and to The Met to talk to the police and offer whatever help they could.
Judith bids farewell to her Army career and returns to London. With no real plan for her future, she assists Sherlock on a case and meets Greg Lestrade. Who may not be a complete stranger after all. And she is presented with the opportunity to take part in a rather unusual hobby.
“Don’t ask how she did it, Jude.” The sound of John’s voice behind her startled her so badly she almost screamed. She certainly jumped.
“Down that way. Off Paul’s Walk on the beach-head. Tide’s low right now, which is why they found the poor sod.” John gauged traffic and grabbed Sherlock by the hand, “Come on.” And just the like old days, before Moriarty threw their world into disarray and pushed John out of the only stable home he’d known since joining the Army, they were on the hunt, moving in sync at a brisk clip as they wove between early-morning crowds.
“Used to say “You see but you do not observe.” Funny words for a genius like that.” The man chuckled, a soft, warm sound that shot through Sherlock’s heart and settled in his core, “Wise words, those. Learned more from that smug bastard than anyone else in my whole life.”
“I don’t always appear in my true Other Form. I’m still quite large enough to get attention for my size, but I don’t frighten anyone. I try not to.” Sherlock stifled a giggle at the way John’s eyes widened. Yes, his Other Form was rather...large. But he wasn’t supposed to
“If you insist, but that wasn’t what I had in mind.” The clever detective picked up her gear and hung her coat and fleece, setting her boots and vest against the wall by the door.
Valerie was entirely too cheerful, but she was always helpful when Greg called for details. In less than three minutes, Valerie was back on the line.
“Captain, that is as much my fault as your own. Mine for not making myself more clear, yours for not reading the proper signals.” Sherlock’s voice was soft, reflective, and so. Fucking. Smooth. “Of course, last night was a bit ... exciting, and I can hardly blame you for mistaking attraction for adrenaline. I know you noticed. You saw, but you did not observe.”
with the man, it was to find him in a bit of trouble. Typical. He wasn’t sure why that didn’t surprise him, but finding Sherlock at gunpoint was not that unexpected. He wasn’t sure what the occasion was, what Sherlock had said or done to earn that, but John wasn’t about to let anyone harm the young man. It didn’t look like a drug-buy, but John honestly didn’t know what he was walking into. Not the first time, and it wouldn’t be the last.
, two days later she was standing guard at a tape-line on Baker Street while working the scene of a bombing across the street from John and Sherlock’s flat. The only reason the flat had taken minimal damage was thanks to the wards John and Judith had placed on the house, otherwise the windows would have been blown out and Sherlock would have been injured far worse. As it was, only one window had been blown out and another had lost an outer pane, and several things had been knocked off of shelves. John arrived in a fit, worried about Sherlock, who had been home at the time of the blast.
Polishing off the current bottle of beer in his hand, John made sure he had his keys and phone and went to kiss Rosie before he went off to get the ice.
“Mm, yes, I imagine you might have. I apologize for not checking on you sooner, John, I know you don’t take this sort of business very well.”
They took turns through the bathroom and returned to the bed when they were ready. John took the time to thoroughly prepare Sherlock, knowing that as long as it had been for him it had been longer still for the young man. Watching Sherlock’s body react and respond to him was ... fascinating. He responded beautifully to careful handling, and when John knew he was ready, he pulled back and took the time to prepare himself. He was so hard already, but he would do everything he could to make this last, to make this good for Sherlock. As he fumbled the foil packet a bit, Sherlock smiled and took it from him.
at and showed promise to climb the rank-ladders to a high position, if she could only make better choices in her private life. He knew Sherlock was good about pushing and prodding Donovan to better herself. As the group sat down, he flagged down a server, who took orders for food and another round of drinks.
He shook his head as he finished getting dressed. His phone rang again with a call incoming and he answered it as he found his shoes and pocketed the ring-box.
“Mr Holmes. Do be careful getting home tonight, there are plenty of people in London who won’t be quite as understanding as a retired Double-Oh if you give them that kind of attitude.” He gave a brisk nod and looked at Greg, who just nodded. He really didn’t need Greg’s permission to leave anyway, but it was nice to let the man know that his bit here was done with.
“You were always the kindest child, John.” Alexandra smiled as she stroked her son’s hair and tilted his face so she could look at him properly, “Let me see you. Oh, you grew up so handsome.” Sherlock didn’t miss the way John blushed, even through his tears, and found it in himself to smile. Alexandra pulled her son against her, and as John settled into her embrace, she looked over his head at Sherlock and her smile grew a bit.
“Thank me when I get your puppies back.” He shook hands with Mr Radcliffe and headed for Greg’s car after handing them a card with his information on it, “I’ll be in touch, and so will The Met. Keep your phones handy, we’ll call when we know something.”
John focused on making Sherlock feel good, figuring out what could get him to make those adorable little noises. John traced the line of Sherlock’s spine, the familiar bumps and dips of each vertebra, and came to rest on the swell of his rather perfect, shapely arse.
“Well, last I saw of him, he wasn’t such a skinny little twig anymore.” She finished what was left of her potato and crumpled the wrapper, “Army life was very good to him, he filled out nicely. Still a sweetheart and a perfect gentleman, of course. Insisted on calling me Doctor J for some reason.”
“And as you reached puberty, you wore a binder. Forced into it by your…father. He wanted sons so badly he was about to sacrifice your personal comfort.” Will frowned, his unusual eyes so dark they were almost brown. “And your mother wasn’t going to stop him.”
useful on cases with The Met as a buffer between the people there who didn’t get along that well with Sherlock and the moody detective.
“I know them.” He looked down at the body now covered by a sheet, watching as a couple of techs took a gurney down to collect the body.
Judith sighed and hung up with Moran. This could end well or poorly, and she wasn’t really sure who had control anymore.
He stifled a sob with one hand and hoped to God Sherlock wouldn’t hear him. But he knew that was a silly hope. Sherlock was very observant, and his hearing was quite good. He would know John was upset. And John was not ashamed. He got himself under control enough he wasn’t just in absolute pieces, but it was obvious he wasn’t doing well. Taking a deep breath, he went back to the bedroom and switched off the light. He paused and studied the sight before him.
“This man. Who is he?” He held out the license. The constable, a young fellow named Hutchinson, took it and looked at it as they sat at a stop.
“Ooh, this is going to hit hard! Word gets out a Summer Prince saved Sherlock Holmes, I hope you boys don’t mind a big wedding.”
“Let’s see, the victim was reported missing at eleven pm from a fundraiser in Islington, do we have those cameras?” She took a headset from M and switched it on, “Q, can you get me the cameras in Islington, please?”
“My mother was driving.” Judith sat down, “Richard swears it was all an accident, but I’m not stupid.”
Judith’s eyes fluttered closed, the strain of the stand-off getting to her. It hurt to see someone with so much training, so much discipline, caught between the ultimate rock and a hard place.
“Get him downstairs now.” Greg waved them out once she had Sherlock securely cuffed. She had done him a favour and put him in protective cuffs before applying the handcuffs to prevent him from getting the bracelet-abrasions common in wearing hand-cuffs for any amount of time. Judith spun Sherlock and marched him out the door, handing him off to one of the constables on the landing. As he went down the stairs quietly, he winked at her. She returned the wink with a subtle tip of her head and stayed where she was. At the top of the stairs, John, Greg, and Sally stood in the hallway and just inside the flat. She saw Anderson there, too, and clenched her teeth in annoyance.
“I’ve been doing it this long, haven’t I?” She just gave him a look, “Just you take care of yourself, Doctor Watson. Have a good morning.”
“Of course we will.” Judith smiled and kissed him on the cheek, “You just keep Sherlock out of trouble, alright? We’re out for two weeks.”
“Oh. Handsome family.” Greg picked up the picture, “And that, I assume, is your ex-wife?” The picture had been torn off and the adult woman was barely in the frame.
“Oh, she’s a dear little thing, kept me company all afternoon, spent most of it sleeping on my couch!”
“What makes you think Sherlock’s going to show up here?” John asked as they caught up with one of the Specialists, he reminded John a bit of a ferret.
“Because I’m not going to let you hurt anyone else.” He folded his arms across his chest, “It’s over, Mary. It never should have started, but I was desperate. And angry. And heartbroken.”
“We must. Come along!” he headed for the bathroom, knowing Sherlock would follow. They had both bathed prior, so it wasn’t a very long shower, just enough to clean up after their fun, and John headed into the kitchen to do something about breakfast after getting dressed.
