“Here I am again, unloading all my problems on you again. You don’t need to hear this stuff…” He murmured, the guilt and shame dripping from his mouth like blood from an open wound, one that Dean wouldn’t let me tend to, though I wasn’t just about let him lay there in a pain that I couldn’t bear to even witness take place, let alone hear.
Yet, before my heart could collapse entirely and before I could ruin the moment for the second time over, Dean’s brain made one last coherent, intelligent decision and moved in the best way he possibly could: closer.
Parts of me had been hoping he’d show up before the following Thursday, which was still a torturous five nights away, but if he did, that would break what little sense I’d found in him: his pattern. Other than my flimsy theory of him enjoying cars, his Thursday night presence was the only thing I had to hold onto, and it wasn’t enough.
Those words were all I heard as Sunday turned into dreaded Monday and I was stuck attempting to listen to the cubicle stories, of the hurtful gossip shared at the water cooler, and how “Leanne had no right to say that about me, especially not when I know her husband’s been sleeping with our bosses sister and-get this-she may be pregnant!”.
“I...I don’t think your theories on the matter are totally false, either,” I mumbled, stumbling and gawking over the words that were coming out of my own mouth once the sound hit my ears. “At least, fifty percent of the way.”
“So, K.C., what’s this I hear about you becoming a priest…?” Charlie teased, plainly illuding to the names that the drunken phony had called me, and with a glance in his direction I saw that he was now singing some sort of psalm I could recall from my distant childhood.
The door’s bell rang obnoxiously loud when I entered and the scrubbing co-worker ceased his intense cleaning to look up at who’d arrived, eyes alive with minor a startling fading from his large pupils. I would’ve felt a twinge of guilt for frightening him, but it was nearly a daily occurrence and my sympathies simply for his personality had long since run out.
I realized, in the seconds that followed, that that specific ding carried with it a lot of significance.
“Dean didn’t plant anything in my head. I wanted to come down and visit, since I didn’t exactly leave on the best of terms.”
Yet, even from my spot behind the bar that good twenty-five feet away, I caught the spark of recognition alight his dazed eyes, and a slight escape of relieved breath blew past my lips. Dean cocked his head to one side, squinted his deep brow, and made an expression emulating strained thought. I suppose the strain was too much on his intoxicated brain, however, and he soon let the loss of his so well-kept secret slide with a shake of his head. Soon after he turned around clumsily on his heels and exited the pub, letting in a gust of cold air as he did so that blew straight into my direction and ruffled the few strands of hair that had come loose atop my head.
“This isn’t what I wanted. I didn’t haul ass all the way down here to watch you guys scream and yell at each other about things we all know are never gonna improve,” I exclaimed, clasping and unclasping my hands together rapidly in a pitiful attempt to busy them, to distract myself from the lump of emotion that had lodged itself into my throat. Once I realized what my impromptu speech would require me to say next though, all efforts to remain strong and respectable flew into the wind.
My words were hushed and quickly deemed utterly useless, and judging by the way Dean’s eyes grew in sight at the way my face had reddened and the way my voice had dropped considerably in volume let me know, for sure, I’d been exposed, but I didn’t bother looking in his direction until many tension-filled moments later because I wasn’t in the mood to risk a peek. It would surely prohibit me from speaking anymore.
Dean Winchester is written across Castiel, as Castiel is written across Dean. They mutually inform each other. They make the other equally as neurotic, charmed, enraged, injured, shocked, and soft. They treat one another justly, tit-for-tat, eye for another weeping, lonely eye. They melt the same, depart the same, and meet in the middle the same. They are inseparable. They are equitable. They are fair. They deserve one another.
As predicted, Charlie was now standing behind the bar, rubbing her hands clean on a rag as she motioned to ghost story boy with not anger, disappointment, or annoyance in her eyes, but a the look of all-knowing, of victory, and snide. My teeth ground against each other in anger and just the general misfortune of the moment. It was very conflicting to have Dean there, off schedule, and be so unrequitedly happy about it, but also be cursing the inconvenient time.
Those were the last of the words that were spoken for a little while. Dean placed the money in the space between my elbows and his tantalizing hands, never taking his eyes off of mine, and for the first time I didn’t even bother counting it in my head to see how much he would deny when I tried to pay him the difference. I was too lost in the strange, indecipherable moment he’d just created by ceasing to look away and break the stare.
One o’clock came too fast after those last few sentences died down, once the buzz had faded, and the night could been seen painting its way across both of our sleep-deprived faces, the bags under Dean’s eyes more accentuated due to the chemicals pumping their way through his strained veins. It was with a sad heart and a feeling of longing, if that was the correct term, that I informed Dean that we had to close up shop, but just like he’d been laid back with everything else that had occurred or been said that night, he left without a drop of annoyance. He’d even left a significantly less amount of spare change, this time the amount of money placed in front of me only exceeding the necessary amount by one dollar, and I watched him leave through blurring eyes and with a thumping heart.
“Well doesn’t he look a bit unhappy…” one of the apocalypse nuns murmured, nudging her partner and pointing to whoever’d just entered. While I looked at the two women clad in black and white, I could feel the newcomers footsteps rattle the floorboards and wondered what priest could possibly have had such a bad day doing the Lord’s work.
Axe. Silver knife. Witch killing bullets. Random animal blood. Two pairs of fake glasses. Gu- Wait. Fake glasses?
“Well, not to make you feel guilty, but I did those things for you. So as long as you never have to go through what I did, it will have been worth it.” Dean smiled sadly at Sam. “And besides, we can’t change the past, so let’s just forget about it. Please?”
Castiel stands up and goes over to the table to look at what Dean was researching for the case. Dean gets up to follow him, mentally cursing himself for almost saying the wrong thing.
“But- But if I told you, he might... still be alive.” Jack was now sobbing, so Sam, who had tears falling down his face as well, stood up and pulled Jack into a hug. The lack of something to lean against caused Dean to lay down, crying into his arms.
“As corny as being saved by True Love’s Kiss is, I have to admit, I feel pretty good. Great, in fact. How about you?”
Dean was quiet for a few minutes, processing everything. Part of his emotional constipation, Sam assumed.
“The one and only. He’s dead, though. Lucifer killed him.. So, Sam and I were investigating this place called the “Broward County Mystery Spot”, where a guy had gone missing. Apparently, it was the work of Gabriel, and he ‘couldn’t resist messing with us when he heard we were in town’.” A few of the people looked disbelieving, but Dean didn’t care. He knew what happened, and that wasn’t going to change because a few random hunters thought he was lying.
“Ready?” Castiel nodded. Jack closed his eyes and transported them right back to where he was, in front of Sam and Dean.
“Sam said that when they were in the jail cell the day he was born, Jack asked him where his father was. Sam started telling Jack that he wouldn’t want to know Lucifer, but Jack interrupted him and said that he was talking about me. And not to give myself too much credit, but I like to think that I’m preferable to the Devil.”
It would still be about three hours until Jack was done with his online school, so Aaron started packing his clothes and other necessities. After about an hour and a half, Garcia called back.
“What is this between us?” Castiel looked confused, as he closed the laptop and scooted the chair so it was facing Dean, who was still sitting  on the bed.
“I have killed many of my brothers. Most of which I fought side-by-side with many years ago. It is a burden that you can never get rid of, no matter how much you try to atone for it.”
“Castiel, you have prepared for this. You know what you have to do.” Naomi was seated at her desk, talking to Castiel as though it were a simple business deal she was having him do, but it wasn’t. She was having him murder Dean. The one human who made him feel human. Feel loved. Who taught him  to love. Taught him to love Sam, taught him to love the Earth, and most importantly, taught Castiel to love Dean.
“Rowena is now the Queen of Hell, yes that Rowena,” Castiel added when he saw Gabriel snap his head up from whatever he was doing with his napkin. “She keeps demons on a pretty tight leash. Jack also gave her a lot more lower, so she can rule better, and demons won’t try to overthrow her. He only did it because he knows her, and she is a good person. He also tweaked her soul so it can’t be demonized.”
“If, at some point, you feel comfortable doing so, you can invite some of your former teammates over.”
“Okay, I saw an ice cream place a few miles back, how about we go get some ice cream, then come back.” Sam nodded, sniffling. Dean was reminded of a memory he had, of when they were kids, and almost the exact same thing happened.
Hello! I just wanted to reiterate: TRIGGER WARNING for sexual abuse. They talk about it, that is kind of  the main focus of this chapter. If you don't feel comfortable reading this, skip to the next chapter. (They're all oneshots anyway, so it won't affect anything.) Stay safe!
They were staying in a small town, so Dean went out looking for a good place to get food. After about ten minutes of walking down the only street that had anything worthwhile to look at (seriously, this town was TINY, as in only three restaurants, and the closest McDonalds was two towns over), he found a diner. Before he could go inside, Castiel appeared by his side.
And the song ended. After a while, ACDC was blasting through the barn, and Dean was stuffing his face with pie, and talking with his friends and the love of his life. He couldn’t be happier.
“Because I want us to talk.” Castiel put his hand on Dean’s shoulder, and looked into his eyes before instantly flying them to a different room.
“Yeah, well that’s where the problem is. Because it was you. I saw you break my brother’s mind. But of course you couldn’t do it in front of Bobby and me.” They exited the stairwell and started walking down the hall to Sam’s room. “You had to lock him in a freaking supply closet, while he was having flashbacks and hallucinations of the Pit.” Dean stopped walking and backed Castiel up against the wall.
“Yup.” Claire sighed, hoping the rest of their time alone wouldn’t be as awkward as it currently was.
“They’re so pretty. Cas, your wings are gorgeous! Can I have the glasses back so I can see them again?”
“Clearly. I mean, I’ve never met her, I haven’t really ever heard her mentioned except for right now, but she seems like an important person in your life, and a good influence.” Claire chose her words very carefully.
When they arrived on the other side, thay saw Sam and Gabriel standing outside a barn. Since Sam told him it would be a barn, Dean had been trying to think of what barn it could possibly be. But now, he could see. It was the barn where they met. The place where it all started. It was fitting. Dean looked to Castiel to see that he had been looking at him, smiling at his reaction.
The barn doors opened to reveal five round tables and a long buffet table at the far end of the barn that had wings, cheeseburgers, mac n cheese, and salad. And in the corner, three large barrels labeled “Beer”. Dean laughed when he saw the buffet table, because it was exactly what he thought Jack would do.
“Now it’s time for the rings.” Sam and Gabriel got up to hand the rings to Dean and Castiel. “Castiel, you go first. And repeat after me. I give you this ring as a symbol of my love.”
“In the metaphorical sense. It basically means you will be able to let go of the burden that comes with it.”
I hope you liked it! I know it was short, but I wrote it all today, with the exception of the first half of the first chapter, which I wrote a few days ago, because I intended to make this longer, but I got caught up in another one that I'm excited about! If you liked it, please leave kudos or a comment! If you didn't like it, leave a comment (respectfully) telling me why! :)
Sam stood up. “You’re not sick. You’re two things. One, a fucking drama queen. Two, bisexual. Do you know what that is?” Dean shook his head. “It’s whan you can love two or more genders. Not that gender isn’t just a societal construct,” he added to himself. “You know?” Dean still looked confused. “It’s like being gay and straight.
“Um, so if you don’t know me, my name is Benny Lafitte. I’m a vampire who helped get Dean out of Purgatory. In return, he brought me back with him. I met Dean on his second day in Purgatory, I think.” He looked to Dean, who nodded. “And when I met him, I told him of the portal that would bring him topside. But he insisted on looking for Castiel. We spent a year together, killing monsters and looking for him. And Dean would talk about him all the damn time. I didn’t have the heart to tell him how damn annoying he was because he seemed so in love. For most of the time, I thought Dean was talking about a lady. I didn’t know why, I guess it’s because of my ‘heteronormativity’ as the young folks are saying these days. Then we got to the stream and we saw Castiel. Of course I knew Dean loved him before, but seeing y’all two meet back up I was just thinking ‘damn, they’re in love’. Anyway, Castiel, you better appreciate Dean. He’s the best anyone could get.” Benny sat down, and looked over to Castiel who said “Trust me, I do.” before he kissed Dean. Dean then gave him a thumbs up.
“Yeah, I can show you. We actually have the biggest collection of supernatural and occult lore in the world.”
“Hey, Sammy.” Dean didn’t turn around. In fact, if Sam didn’t know his voice, he may not have known it was Dean that said it.
Aaron sighed in relief. “Thank you. I was wondering if you had a place, somewhere off the grid, where Jack and I could stay. Not forever, just until George Foyet completely loses track of us.”
“Because he was sure enough. Nothing in life has a hundred percent certainty, man. You take the percentage you’re given and run with it.”
“I don’t quite know what that feels like, and I probably couldn’t imagine, but I’m sorry, if that helps at all.”
“Yeah, yeah, I just have to... Go to the bathroom. Be back in a few minutes.” Dean quickly walked out. Castiel rolled his eyes and started on his own, albeit slower. There was a reason this was a two man job.
“Hmph. Well, as long as he doesn’t try to fuck anything up. At least he got rid of the main troublemakers, and made Heaven a far safer place to call home.”
“By the power vested in me by the state of Kansas, South Dakota, and the fact that I’m God, I now pronounce you married.” Dean and Castiel kissed and everyone cheered.
“Why? I told him it wasn’t me, it was the angels. What’d you talk to him about?” Dean went into the diner and sat at one of the barstools at the counter. Castiel followed suit.
She opened the door, and went out, followed closely by Jack. They crossed the street, went into the diner, and managed to snag the last booth available.
For a moment, Castiel was frozen in shock, tears threatening to spill from his eyes. Then he slowly started moving toward Dean, who, as it was becoming increasingly obvious, couldn’t hear him. If Castiel had to guess, and he was an exceptional guesser, he would say that Dean was dissociating. He sat down on the opposite side of the bed and put his hand on Dean’s forehead, healing him, while taking the knife away from Dean with the other.
It was about an hour before the wedding, so Dean decided to put his suit on. He pulled it out of the closet, smiling. He and Cas debated for about a week on what they should wear, and how they should coordinate. They decided on simple black suits, and ties matching the other’s general eye color. Since they still wanted an element of surprise, they decided that they would each pick out their own tie.
“No, Dean. I’m not. I failed at being an angel. Everything I ever attempted came out wrong. But here, at least I have a shot at getting things right.” Castiel started unpacking the peanuts onto the shelf.
“Can- Can you bring Cas back? Please?” Dean had been pretty constantly crying since Castiel died, so of course that was the first thing he thought of when Jack became God.
Sam laughed. “Nothing’s wrong. You’re getting married. I’m happy to see you so happy. Now put down the gun and come on out. Everyone’s already at the barn, so now’s the perfect time for you and Castiel’s ‘first look’ or whatever.”
“When I was flying you out of Hell, at one point, I almost dropped you. If I had, then all our efforts would have been for nothing, and you would have been beyond saving. In order to not let that happen, I branded myself to you. In human terms, it is like I,” Casatiel tried to find an adequate comparison. “It’s like I handcuffed myself to you. Except instead of handcuffs, it was my grace, and I bound my grace to your soul. We are generally warned against doing this, as it can leave a lasting impression, but it’s what had to be done. So that handprint on your arm contains minute traces of my grace, intermingling with your soul. An unbreakable bond.”
“When they broke apart, that feeling subsided but, unlike last time, he felt fine. Actually, he felt great. He felt as if every little ache, pain, and tiny paper cut he had was gone. He looked up at Castiel in surprise, then joy.
“Who is Naomi, Cas?” As Dean was reaching out to Castiel, he ducked under Dean’s arm to grab the angel tablet. As he was going for it, he appeared in Naomi’s office.
He was there. Sitting on the ledge. Sam made sure to move loud enough to be heard, without being quiet enough to scare Dean as he was approaching him. The last thing Sam wanted was to scare Dean, to make him jump, and fall off the ledge. Falling from that height would most definitely kill him, especially with the rough terrain below.
Dean was laying on his bed, tears silently streaming down his face, with his right arm hanging off the side of the bed. But what immediately caught Castiel’s attention was the steady dripping of blood falling from his right wrist, collecting on the floor below. And the hunting knife in his left hand.
“I Love you too, Dean.” Castiel looked at Dean with tears in his eyes. He couldn’t believe that this was how Dean was going to die. He couldn’t believe that vampires were able to do what the Angels and the Demons couldn’t. So he did the only thing he could think of. He kissed Dean, extremely gently, and Dean kissed him back.
“Dean, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.” They stayed like that, hugging each other while Dean cried for a while. Eventually, Dean looked at Castiel.
“I woke up, and I couldn’t find you or Cas, so I came looking for y’all, and I obviously found you. I’m really sorry.” Dean saw that Sam had tear tracks running down his face, and he sounded a little out of breath. He had been crying. Dean sighed reluctantly, about to start crying again.
“In the eyes of Chuck? No thanks, I’m good.” Dean crossed his arms over his chest. Castiel knew that his chance to get Dean to open up was slipping away.
“Because if you do, the angels will kill you,” Dean asks, trying to understand why Castiel refuses to go back to Heaven.
“Trust me, Dean, I’ll never leave you. I’m an angel, I have been alive for many millenia, I don’t plan on going anywhere for at least one more.”
“For eleven years, Sam has thought that you were going to kill him. He thought you told him that there was no going back. Dean, Sam honestly thought that you hated him and would never be able to forgive him.”
“Oh. Okay. So, what did you want to talk about?” Dean sat on the bed with his back against the headboard.  He motioned for Castiel to move to sit next to him, which he did.
“I told you it would be funny if you said it! I was joking! I didn’t think you’d actually write it down and say it,” Sam defended.
“No, not at all. As a matter of fact, with your skills, I’d love to ask you about how it might relate to monsters.”
“Awesome. Sam and I already talked to Bobby, and he loved the idea. Dean and Castiel Singer. Hey, check the address on the paper. I want to make sure I know where we’re going.”
“Because if I see what Heaven’s become- What I...” Cas falters for a moment, then quickly regains his composure. “What I made of it, I’m afraid I might kill myself.”
“Whose child is he?” Balthazar raised an eyebrow at Castiel, knowing he probably wouldn’t like the answer.
“Well, what’s mine say?” Dean reached his hand over to take the other card from Castiel. “Dean Singer. Those sons of bitches.” He laughed.
“Jack- Jack, it’s okay. I- We understand. Castiel told you not to.” Sam put his hand on Jack’s shoulder with a reassuring look.
Right after the scene in season 7 where Castiel gets his memory back, after being Emanuel for a time. They are going up to Sam’s hospital room.
“Right, sorry. Meg is right. If I am to save your brother, we need to hurry. Please, lead the way. I’ll follow you.”
After Castiel killed the vampire, he looked around and saw Dean on the floor, one hand on his neck, which was not doing very much against the blood that was rushing past his fingers, onto the dusty, cement floor. Castiel rushed over to Dean, and knelt beside him.
“Why did you brand me?” Dean unbuttoned his shirt enough to slip it off of his shoulder so he could look at the handprint.
The waitress came to take their order, so they shortly stopped talking to tell her their orders, and to not scare her, what with talking about how one of the people at the table is the Biblical Antichrist. After the waitress left, they resumed their conversation, Jack H taking the lead.
“Yes, I do have wings. They are considered ‘sexy’ in Heaven. I have no idea why. You may have heard other angels call me ‘pretty boy’ or whatever. Crowley once told me I had ‘sex appeal’.” Castiel shuddered. “It was very odd.”
Eventually, they decided to get going. They got in the Impala, and started driving. Dean didn’t know what to expect when he turned to get onto the highway, but barely noticing a thing wasn’t it. As a matter of fact, he probably would’ve thought it didn’t work if a car hadn’t suddenly appeared a ways off in front of them.
“Yeah. A woman who’s practically our mom and her girlfriend. Jody Mills, the sheriff of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Donna Hanscum, who was the sheriff of Cottage Grove, Minnesota last we heard. She’s also been the sheriff of Hibbing, Minnesota. Why?”
“That depends. I like Castiel, I’ve been wanting him for a while. Now I have him. Whatever you offer me better be good.”
“When Sam first approached me about having the wedding here, I was a little apprehensive at first, but when he  explained why he wanted to, I agreed. And I’m glad I did, this is beautiful. And my answers for when I fell in love with you and when I realized you loved me back are very different than yours. I first fell in love with you when I saved you from Hell. I realized I was in love when we went and got the Impala when we were going to kill Dick Roman.” Dean laughed at that.
“I’m not a hundred percent sure these count, but they count to Sam, so I count them. Gabriel dropped Sam in a wormhole, where he was basically living Groundhog Day, except instead of falling asleep to restart the day, the day restarted when I died. According to Sam, this happened one hundred and one times.”
“Okay. Um. I’m not sure how to start.” Dean closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. Castiel could tell he was starting to zone out. He laid a hand on Dean’s shoulder, grounding him.
“Well tough, because Cas here left Sam thinking he was back in the Pit. With Lucifer.” Dean punches Castiel in the nose. It heals immediately. He then holds his hand up to Castiel’s throat, effectively choking him against the wall. He looked into Castiel’s eyes and only saw sadness and regret.
“Because Castiel made me promise not to. I wanted to, but he said no. I’m sorry. It’s my ault if I had just told you, he would still be alive.” Jack was crying as he punched himself in the arm.
“I would never leave you. I just wanted to adjust you so you are more comfortable. I’ll be gentle, I promise.” Castiel sat down, and carefully picked Dean up so he was laying in Castiel’s lap, Dean’s back supported by his arm. “Better?”
“Know that I will always love you, no matter what.” Castiel slipped the ring on Dean’s finger. It was wide, the metal silver, and in the center, a small amount of his Grace, shining blue in between the silver.
“Fine.” Dean took a breath. “But you have to promise not to tell anyone. Not even Sam. He doesn’t know, and he can’t know.”
“Thanks, it was really unexpected and I need C- Steve’s help right now.” Dean played the part perfectly, complete with the look of memories in his eyes.
At some point, Sam stood up and tapped his glass with his knife. “Can I have your attention, please?” Everyone stopped talking and looked at Sam. “Thank you. Now, first of all, I want to say congratulations to my brother and my best field for finally getting hitched! I had to put up with so much bullshit from you two, I don’t even know where to start. How about when you were arguing and Dean almost ran the Impala off the road? Which is the only time that’s ever happened. Or how about when you got back from Purgatory and saw Castiel everywhere, the same way I saw Jess everywhere after she died? Or the classic eye-fucking every damn chance you got? Y’all should’ve gotten together a decade ago. Jesus fucking Christ. Gabe, do you want to say something?” Sam sat down in a huff, Dean and Castiel in hysterics.
Castiel looked at Dean’s tear-stained face, a face that had lost all hope, lost all faith. He put his hand on Dean’s shoulder, in the exact same place where Dean’s scar was from when he pulled him out of Hell.
“You mean killing me?” Death looked up from his book. “All’s forgiven. I don’t tend to keep grudges against the ones who save the universe.” Death went back to his book. Dean could tell he was being dismissed. As he was walking away, he heard “Your home is beautiful, by the way.”
“That’s where I was going to tell you the last time we were there. I now know why you wouldn’t let me say it. And I realized you felt the same way when you couldn’t kill me back when we found the Angel Tablet.” Castiel let out a quiet laugh. Dean continued. “And if you ever try to pull that confess-and-die shit again, I’ll kill you. I love you so much, Cas.” He smiled.
“He was a nephilim.” Castiel sighed, knowing what the next question was, yet he waited for it to be asked.
“Right. Have  any of you heard of the Trickster?” Everyone shook their heads no. “Well, allow me to enlighten you. Tricksters are just pranksters with a messed up sense of humor. They kill assholes with a sense of humor. Well, they don’t always kill. They made one guy get abducted by aliens and they slow danced with him. He told me about it.” Dean shivered at the idea. So did a few other people in the kitchen. A couple others chuckled. ” Anyway, this was the second time we ran into this particular Trickster, who we later found out was the Archangel Gabriel.”
“Great. How about we meet you there and we can eat together before we bring you to the Bunker. Just so we can get to know each other a little. Can you get a table for six? There’ll be four of us coming.”
“Woah, Dean!” Sam pulled Dean out of the Impala and wrapped him up in a big hug. They stayed like that until Dean started calming down. Still sniffling, but not crying so much.
He was back in the crypt. He turned away from Dean, and put his hands over his ears, knowing it wouldn’t do anything.
“I love it. It’s really fitting to be our song. Especially for it to be here. Eventually, the last line of the song played.
“Good. Do you want to go now?” Dean pulled away from Sam, and put his hands on his shoulders to ground him.
When he got there, Sam immediatelyrealized that something was wrong. First of all, because Dean was driving erratically. Well, more erratically than usual. Then he saw Dean’s face. It was red and puffy and tear-stained. Something was really wrong.
“It’s okay, I guess. I asked Jack to make the memory go away which he did. I just remember the fact that you killed me now, not it actually happening.”
“The night before Sammy went off to Stanford. I didn’t know he would be leaving, I was saving up to get him a computer. I would’ve had enough within two to three days.”
“I love you so much. As long as you are here with me, I’ll always be okay. Please don’t go back to Heaven. I don’t want you to die.” Dean buried his face in Castiel’s shoulder, inhaling the farmiliar scent of his trench coat.
“I’ll try to.” Aaron hung up the phone and continued packing. When Jack was done with school, he helped Jack pack his things. When Jack asked where they were going, Aaron would only respond with “an adventure”.
“I really am sorry for doing this to you. Naomi brainwashed me after she got me out of Purgatory.” Castiel helped Dean sit up, heaping his hand on Dean’s back for him to lean against.
There was a soft knock on the door. Dean knew who it was, only one person would knock like that. “Come in, Sammy.” He finished tying his tie, and put on his suit jacket. “What do you think?” He turned around to see tears running down Sam’s face. “Woah woah woah, is everything okay? What’s going on?” He picked up his gun.
An hour? Sam could’ve sworn he’d talked to Dean fifteen minutes ago. Time must’ve really gotten away from him when he was studying.
It took about ten minutes before Dean felt confident enough in his legs to stand. Before he left the dungeon, he went to the wall where the Empty took Cas, and put his hand on it, secretly hoping the Empty would take him too. Needless to say, nothing happened. Except for a fresh wave of tears.
“My relationship with you is far different than my relationship with Sam, in a way that I have never experienced befre. Granted, I have never spent nearly as much time with any other humans as I have with you two, but this feels...” Castiel paused for a moment, searching for the right word. “Deeper than anything I ever thought I would experience. It may have something to do with the brand.”
“When Jack rebuilt Heaven, he killed almost all of the angels. Well, not killed, more along the lines of ceasing their existence. Which I am now realizing doesn’t sound much better. Anyway, we are the only ones left. Jack will make more at some point, but Heaven doesn’t rely on angels for it’s power anymore, and he automatized a lot of the processes, so an army of angels is no longer required.”
The waitress brought them their food then, and they spent the rest of the meal bringing the other party up to date as to where they had been in the past few years.
“Oh, okay. Well, I’m bringing Cas home because I want to , and you’re going to let me because it benefits you, got it?”
“Oh, you mean the kid and his mom whose minds I had you erase? Yeah, great example of how good of a father I am.”
“Well, I don’t think there’s much left to say, but I figured I should say something, so I’ll say this.” Bobby walked to the barn doors, surveyed the barn, then walked to a spot about halfway through and a little to the left. “This is where Castiel was standing when you stabbed him with the demon knife.” Everyone burst out laughing. Bobby pointed to a spot about five feet away. “And that’s where you knocked me out.” Everyone started laughing again. A quick “Sorry!” from Castiel. Bobby walked back to his seat. “Alright, that’s all I have to say. Just thought everyone should know what actually happened here. Idjits.” He picked up his beer- “To the happy couple” -and sat down.
“Okay, lets see what we have in store for the night.” Dean drove around back, and parked outside room 15, at Castiel’s command. They got out of the car and Castiel unlocked the door to the room, finding out that the last room in the place had a single king-sized bed.
They both exited the room, Sam turning right to go out the back, and Dean turning left to go through the house.
“Marriage is nothing more than the union of two souls in the eyes of the government. Very few are unions in the eyes of God. As a matter of fact, I’m pretty sure you two are the third couple ever who are united in the eyes of God. That’s me, by the way. But don’t call me that. I’m also sure you are the second marriage between an angel and a human. And I am one hundred percent sure that it is the first gay one.” Most people laughed at that, though Jack wasn’t trying to be funny.
He had only met them once on a case, which was when he found out that supernatural creatures were real. He happened to run into them when he was on a walk to clear his mind and he happened to pass the graveyard where the Winchesters were digging up a body. The ghost showed up and he helped Sam fend it off while Dean salted and burned the body. After that, they talked for a while, then Dean gave him his phone number in case he'd ever need them.
Dean’s grip is loosening on Cas as his mouth grows stiffer and stiffer. He can’t remember the last time he’s heard the words he’s trying to say and pauses to wonder if Cas has ever heard them, himself.
I acted, finally, after waiting until the very last second. I moved my arms forward and swung both of my hands inward and around what I hoped would be the keys, but when I felt their metal surface scratch against my fingertips and slide past, I knew I'd failed in my painfully basic mission. My senses faded in their intensity, my arms began falling back to my sides, and I watched with a now disheartened gaze as the keys clattered to the wooden floor with a harsh clang.
“Sorry,” he murmured after a few moments of cringing silence, though I hardly saw the need for an apology if it was something he truly cared about and loved. It was pleasing to see the light of happiness, no matter how distant, come alive in his eyes for a change.
“Well then you still have your work cut out for you, then! Don’t let this one get away, Cas!” My companion giggled at the annoyance her humorous determination inspired within me, evident in my sigh and the sink of both my shoulders, before making her own way over to my side of the bar. Her choice method of transportation was flinging herself over the wooden structure and landing, with surprising grace, on both her feet just in front of me.
it now.” Dean finds purchase on Cas’s wrists and ignores the implication. “I…I’ve always got it, when I think about it. I didn’t think you did. That’s why I couldn’t say it. I’ve always wanted you to know that
“Yeah, I did. But Kevin doesn’t know that, and even though they’re not in the car, Kevin won’t give up because God forbid he do something wrong. It’ll keep him busy for a little while.”
As I said though, I’d missed something important. It came in the form of the door bell clanging over the Friday night commotion, like a beacon throughout the decipherable chaos, in the form of a tall, more than six-foot figure walking with heavy, stomping footsteps to escape the cold, and in the form of familiar green eyes, freckles, and a sad slump that I’d hoped had vacated his system. Something had brought it back…
Cas beamed, and it was moments like then where I realized that while he might’ve corrupted me with his innocence, I’d infested him with my rudeness and my sarcasm, and sometimes it really did catch me off guard.
“I don’t believe it’s really the evening anymore…” I answered, but it wasn’t a serious reply, and I made sure to let Dean know this by giving him a brief, fleeting grin. He seemed to appreciate it and stopped rubbing the length of his fingers together so furiously.
"Not a problem," I replied with a small smile, the one my boss taught me on my first day that had become muscle memory to my face, and went about my business of serving the angry and leathery customer. And while I went to work, I swear I could hear his very breath move in and out of his slightly parted lips. Something had seriously gotten under his skin.
What had Dean’s sudden willingness to confide in me meant? The amount of information he’d relayed to me about not only his brother, but his relationship with him and his hidden fear of being left alone with his father, no matter how passive Dean had tried to bring it up, was striking. I’d even nabbed the chance to confirm my theory about his passion for cars, more so than I ever thought possible. And even his out of the blue comments, no matter how discrete or casual they were in nature, had left me a little bewildered, to say the least.
“Yes?” Cas asks. Dean feels that, if he answers, he’ll land on the nail again, so he doesn’t reply. He stares, and he nods, and he watches as relief washes Cas’s face in pink before Sam rises from the floor and wraps his gangly monkey arms around the angel of Thursday, freely weeping into his trench coat, eyes flicking between savior and save-e.
Her distressed face dropped into one of grateful relief, but her thank you was drowned out by her chugging the drink’s contents in moments, excited by the lack of money she would have to depart with that night. I felt like an enabler, to a point, but also soothed. Hopefully a night of breaking and letting loose would be what she needed to start back up again, to give her that necessary kick of motivation in her step to help her through her troubles. But, in the end, all I probably did was sprout an alcohol problem.
He chewed on his lip upon completing his sentence and let out a sigh through only flared nostrils. It was like watching a machine struggle to power down, struggle to let off steam, and fall into necessary dormancy. I had a strange need to help him, a strange desire to remove at least some of whatever was tormenting him from the equation, because just observing him was exhausting, draining even.
And upon voicing my following question, I was met with a sound that I surely did not expect in the least: laughter. Dean Winchester was laughing. It was a laugh full of self-doubt, of a sense of failure, and the sense that he just couldn’t care less at that point in time, but it was a laugh nonetheless, and it was three times as loud as the doorbell had been each time I’d wanted to rip it from its position on the door. Fortunately, his laughter was not a noise that I wanted to be rid myself of.
I prepared the drink all while feeling mercilessly watched, though there were no green and brown-flecked eyes anywhere on me, and I struggled to understand how he was able to carry such an air of intimidation. If I ever wanted to win, if I ever wanted to redeem my status of “excellent people-watcher,” then I would have to get over the trembling of my fingers and his many, many walls of defense. There had to be a way to get inside, a backdoor. There always was...it was simply a matter of finding it.
I think I cleared my throat. I can remember the scratching somewhere deep within my vocal chords and how the sound reverberated off of my chest, but not much of what came after it. I can recall the look in my brother’s eyes, their hazel hue full of desperation and the anger I’d made him swear to suppress, and if he thought for a second that I would be able to help him, he had another thing coming. I’d had every intention of keeping my mouth nearly sewn shut, cut off from every chance of confrontation, and upon arriving at my dad’s I’d thought Sam had the same intentions as well. The pleading gaze that was spilling forth from his irises, however, told me differently.
I watched his head crane upwards in a way that was almost mechanical, like gears were arching his neck and deepening the arch in his brow and clenching his sleek jawline. Even his lips, which were contorting themselves into a grin that I knew for a fact was without any trace of sincerity and burned like hot metal on skin, moved like they were powered by some internal motor. I began to wonder if the motor’s fuel was the anger radiating from him.
“Very much so...to be quite honest,” I answered, unable to fight the pull my current emotions had on the corners of my mouth, drawing them up into my cheeks to form the smallest, most discreet of smirks. I could see from the outskirts of my peripheral vision that the same expression was written across the face of my companion but, yet again, it didn’t mix well with whatever anxiety was flooding his system, and I remembered my original mission: I had to discover what was so plainly wrong.
“Doesn’t mean I don’t feel bad about it. But, still, thanks for stickin’ it out and listenin’. It does feel kinda nice to get rid of all this shit.”
I swallowed hard, hoping to remove some of the pain sputtering outward from somewhere in my throat, probably the dryness caused from my poor night, and shook my head slowly to avoid activating my headache from that morning and, unfortunately yet predictably, I wasn’t very successful.
“If by go as planned, you mean did we go?” he retorted, looking to me briefly for either a nod or a shake of my head, and I supplied neither. (In retrospect, I realize that I should have, but Dean continued anyways.)
Dean took the drink gratefully, pouring back a hearty swig, grimacing only for half a second at the smoky heartiness of the liquid, and slammed the half-emptied glass down on the counter. That was also habitual, and it usually preceded his announcement of something, or told me he wanted me to initiate the conversation. Unfortunately, in that “rather unusual” situation, the action depicted the latter, so I delivered.
“You’ve…you’ve got a shirt in the trunk,” Sam declares, an archaeologist discovering the apex of his quest. “Wait here,” he instructs. “I’ll grab it. You’re full of…
“So,” Bobby announced, clearing his throat as if on some God-send of a cue. “I think we all can agree on the fact that we’re mighty glad to see Sam again.”
The ghost didn’t matter anymore, or mattered even less than it had moments ago, and became nothing but invisible background noise. I probably should’ve eyed the frat boy’s drink, just to make sure he wasn’t running low and so I could add to my countdown of when to cut him off for the night, but my bartender-duties flew into the air and evaporated on contact, like dust being blown off an old surface. The only thing I was focused on at that very second was how he dragged his feet lazily to the other end of the bar, the corner closest to the kitchen door, and the only one that was majorly unpopulated, and sat down clumsily. He didn’t raise his eyes, didn’t scan his surroundings, and didn’t even bother to apologize to a woman he, rather rudely, bumped into on his journey to his seat.
She rolled her eyes, flung her arms into the air in exasperation, and looked as though she was seconds from grabbing me by the shoulders and shaking me vigorously back and forth. I hoped, if she did end up doing so, it would somehow insert the solution into my brain so I could fix the disaster I’d created before it was too late, and that didn’t alot me much time.
Anyways, there had been far more distractions than just my almost-dangerous street crossings. The past three days had been full of fruitless analyzation and vivid recollections of the last Thursday night. I still could recite the “online fraud man’s” story, and I could picture right in front of me the way in which the newlyweds snuck cheeky glances at one another, thrilled at the scandalous escape they’d made from their own marriage ceremony, but neither of those were as striking and clear as the cohesively broken mystery man’s voice and eyes.
It was a relief when Bobby arrived though, because at least he had the balls to admit to himself, me, and even Sam if he’d ever been willing to listen, that things weren’t better. The entire house smelled of old habits never shaken, only amplified, and my dad was jumpy. He would perk up at the mention of certain words, certain phrases, certain subjects, and nearly shut down in intervals of slurs and offers of drinks to which we all did our best to deny. Sam was the first to give in, followed by Bobby, and then me, which I found almost humorously ironic. The one who was most like their father in their drinking habits had avoided taking alcohol from that very same father figure the most.
“I can’t please everyone and I’m so sick of lettin’ people down, but I’m so tired of givin’ up what Sammy wants for Dad. It’s not fair to Sam.”
I couldn’t gage the level of boredom in his voice, because he seemed like the kind of person who, if made uninterested, would simply cease speaking. I counted a total of three sentences that he’d omitted from his mouth in one singular evening, and if that didn’t scream only a tolerable level of boredom, than I’m not entirely sure what does. But, since his latest reply was not one that I could do much with, I simply smiled and attempted to busy myself with other tasks while the amber liquid made its own slow way down Dean’s throat.
That bewilderment carried far into the night, kept my bloodshot eyes open and staring plainly at the ceiling as I lay in bed, covers pulled up to my chin, and no matter how badly the other parts of me begged for sleep, cried out for the chance to recharge, I couldn’t shut it down. I couldn’t convince the pieces and fragments of my mind, mostly my imagination, to let the details slip away into my memory, to chalk them up as an effect of the very substance I was employed to sell, and I sure as hell couldn’t stop myself from analyzing every syllable, every inhale and exhale, and every small little undertone and hidden meaning I’d thought I’d detected throughout the night. There just had to be more.
Dean had lied to Castiel’s face when the Empty had taken him. It wasn’t an out-loud lie, nor was it intentional, but Dean was such a good deceiver at the tender age of forty-something that sometimes the absence of a response can would morph into a lie all its own.
A gleam of blue headlights dashing down the dimly lit street gave me the answer, the solution being found in the shade of aquamarine being projected by the vehicle’s front light-bulbs.
My eyes flicked to Sam and he fell silent, immediately, though it looked as if someone had clamped a hand over his mouth and prevented him, by force, from speaking. There wasn’t a single word that he could say that would make me think any differently.
“Ya know,” she began, dropping her voice lower in the sentimentally serious range, and I knew a load of hefty subject matter was coming my way. That annoying piece of my mind that wouldn’t stop running at a mile a minute just wouldn’t let me prepare for it.
I shook my head, shedding off all of the useless words in search for the perfectly compiled follow up statement, but once the first syllables had passed my tongue I’d known I failed.
From the outskirts of my vision I saw Sam let out a long sigh and run his hands through his hair, the hair that he still hadn’t cut even when I’d insisted he keep it at a reasonable length all throughout his time in high school, and had a sudden, bittersweet flashback to all the times I’d given my younger brother haircuts. I assumed that my late mother had given him his very first haircut, since he’d been born with with a head of hair that quickly accumulated into the smaller version of what it was today, but I’d snipped away at his messy mane countless times over the years. One occasion stuck out the most to me, an occasion upon which three whole inches of dirty blonde was removed, was the first time Sam had asked me where Dad was.
“Now for the I Do’s. Dean, do you take Castiel to be your husband, to love him, to comfort him, to honor and keep him, in sickness and in health and to be faithful to him for as long as you both shall live?”
“Why didn’t you beg for your life? Why did you tell me that that wasn't me?” Castiel stood up and faced Dean, the angel tablet in his hand.
“Dean, you know I can tell when you’re hiding something from me. Please, tell me. I promise I won’t judge you.”
He got there in three hours. He was so caught up in his grief thaat he didn’t notice that there were no moving cars, no people. He almost ran off the road no less than four times because he could barely see through his tears.
“Ah.” Dean sat down against the ledge, but on the ground this time, leaning against the ledge. “Are you sure it’s a real thing?”
When he got back to the Bunker, he found that most people were all ready and were milling around. He placed a few bowls of strawberries, 3 Musketeers bars, and M&Ms on the table for people to eat if they felt like it. He wasn’t sure what they would all like, and he made it a policy of his to never look at anyone’s thoughts without their express permission, so he put what he’d like to eat. It seemed to do the job. People took what they wanted almost immediately. He stayed and chatted with people for a while, until it was time to take them to the venue.
“Woah, woah, woah. What happened, Cas? Are you okay? What’s wrong?” Dean hated seeing the man he loved cry. No, not man. Angel. The angel he loved. Because even without his Grace, Castiel was still an angel. He was a broken human in love with an Angel of the Lord. He started to feel like crying too, but he held it in. He had to. Because Castiel needed his attention right now, and confessing his feelings to him while he was in such a vulnerable state would be selfish.
“I’m sorry, what?” Csatiel eyed Dean nervously, still staring at what Castiel could now tell to be his wings.
“Hey, Sam. What’s up?” Dean was trying to sound nonchalant about finding both Castiel and an answer to the Elamite problem.
“But- But it’s more than that. I...” Dean took a deep breath. “I love you.” Castiel noticed Dean’s lgs were a little wobbly, and as soon as he did Dean fell onto the floor, his tears mixing with the blood on his face and falling into his cuts, making him hiss in pain.
“Because I don’t know if he will react like my dad. And I can’t lose him not again.” Tears were threatening to spill from Dean’s eyes. “Anyway, what did you not want to tell me? What do you think the bond might be?”
Castiel pulled Dean’s tie out from his jacket. “Where did you get this?” It was Castiel’s original solid blue tie. He thought he lost it.
When all the festivities were over and everyone was exhausted, Jack opened a portal to the Bunker. Before they went through, Gabriel pulled Dean and Castiel over to the side and handed them a key card wrapped in a piece of paper.
“No. That has always been my dad’s last name, and I don’t want to carry his abusive legacy anymore. Sam and I talked, and we were thinking about Singer. Because Bobby’s always been more of a father to us than John ever was. Would you like to take that name, too?”
“Because... Just because I haven’t ever... Done anything. With a dude. Doesn’t mean I never thought about it.” Dean’s eyes flashed with fear for a moment, his voice wobbling as he said it. “Or wanted to.”
Castiel’s bedroom door swung open. “Cassie! Everyone’s there, it’s time for you and Dean’s pre-wedding sex!” Gabriel walked over to Castiel and put his hands on his shoulders. “Are you ready?”
The music started playing, and Dean didn’t recognize it at first. He could tell it was a romantic song, which is why he let Sam pick it. They started moving to the song, and the more he listened to it, the more he liked it. It was different than most he listened to, but it seemed so familiar.
“Maybe something along the lines of ‘I’m sorry you had to hear that’, or, yes, ‘I’m sorry the angels screwed up my message’. Because at this point, it’s more about him hearing it than you saying it.” Castiel put his hand on Dean’s arm. “Please. I’m not sure you are aware of how much this affected him.”
Dean’s eyes opened, clouded with confusion, then realization as he saw Castiel. He stared at Castiel blankly for a moment, then asked one question that broke Castiel’s heart.
“Cas, don’t do this.” Castiel knew Dean was begging him, but Naomi had messed with him so much that he couldn’t bring himself to stop.
Castiel quickly made himself look decent and opened the door. On the other side was Gabriel, Balthazar, and Samandriel. Gabriel and Balthazar kept talking about their favorite pranks, while Samandriel leaned on the wall near the door, listening to them.
“I can offer you silence. I will take Castiel, and I can promise you nothing will ever bother you again.”
“You made me ask the front desk clerk if he had any lube. Trust me, I could be giving you a way worse dare right now.” Sam walked over to Dean and took his shoe off before Dean could react. “I’ll put one of these ice bucket bags in so your shoe doesn’t get wet. Not to be nice, but because we are driving all day tomorrow and I don’t want you complaining about having a wet shoe all day.” Sam put an ice cube in an extra ice bucket bag and shoved it in Dean’s shoe before tossing the shoe back to him.
“Awesome! Dean led Castiel into the barn, and everyone else followed behind. “Wait, Sam, why is it your phone there?”
Sam quickly went over to Dean and knelt down beside him. “Dean, listen to my voice. You’re safe, I’m here. We’ll get Cas back. I promise.” This was clearly doing nothing to help Dean. Sam stayed by Dean, trying to get him to calm down, but nothing was working. Eventually, Dean passed out, his arms going limp in his lap and his head falling forward.
“You know, the term ‘Antichrist’ isn’t actually in the original biblical lore. It was created in a version in the mid-1400s to fear monger people into being Christians.”
“Okay, first, I’ll explain the easy ones. The first time I died was because I sold my soul in a demon deal to get Sam back from the dead. And because the demons knew who I was, even then, they only gave me one year before I would be dragged to Hell. Which I was, in ‘08. An angel brought me back after four months-”
The next morning, Aaron woke up to his alarm yelling in his face at 7AM, got Jack up, made them breakfast, checked that their witness protection agent got his email (she did, she was concerned, but respected his decision), packed their old little green VW Bug, and headed off for Lebanon, Kansas.
“I started listening when you told Castiel that he couldn’t tell me, and knowing our track record with secrets, I stayed and listened. I really wasn’t expecting that, though. I’m really sorry.”
Sam and Gabriel looked up from their conversation when Dean and Castiel walked up to them. Sam walked over to Dean first.
“Okay, thanks. So, when Sammy and I were little- not little, little, but like 12 and 16- I got busted for stealing peanut butter and bread. I got sent to a boys home for a few months, and when my dad finally came to get me, he was really mad. Not that I was stealing, but that I had gotten caught. I made a promise to myself that I would never steal again, but in order to keep that promise, I had to find a way to earn money. I had no car, I was a minor, and I was only in town for a few weeks at a time. I knew what my options were.  Really didn’t want to have to resort to it, but one time, I think I had just turned 17, my dad was on a hunt, and he had left us with enough money to last us a week. He told us he would be gone for a week, so naturally I budgeted to make the money last for two  weeks But then three weeks went by and we hadn’t heard from our Dad. We had run out of money two days prior, and I was letting Sammy eat all the food. I actually hadn’t eaten in three or four days, but Sam was getting the food he needed, which was the important part. Anyway, I realized that I had to get money one way or another, so I went out looking for jobs. There weren’t any available. At least not any without ‘prior experience’ or needing a drivers license. So I made a decision. I did the unthinkable. I put Sammy to bed and told him that I was going out with a few other people my age for a while. He didn’t suspect a thing. But I wasn’t going out with friends. I wish to God I was, but instead I went to the alley behind the busiest bar in town. I waited around for a little while, until a guy came out. He asked me what I was doing back there, and I- I told him- I told him ‘anything you want’. I’ve regretted saying those words ever since.” Dean hung his head in shame, and so that Castiel couldn’t see the tears in his eyes. “People always say that the first time is the worst. It’s true. The first time is when you’re the most scared, and everything is a surprise, you don’t know what to expect, and you aren’t desensitized to it yet. Anyway, when he was- When he was done with- with me, he tossed me on the ground... And basically threw a- a $100 bill at me. I went home that night, c- crawled into bed, and cried until... until the sun came up.” By this point, Dean was sobbing into Castiel’s shoulder, struggling to get the words out, and Castiel was holding Dean as though he believed he could shelter him from the memories.
“Good boy.” Castiel let go of Dean and walked outside. Dean took a moment to get his breathing (among other things) under control before he followed Castiel out the door.
“Okay, whatever. Let’s just get going, okay?” Dean grabbed the angel tablet, and they started walking out, but before they got to the door that led them outside, Cadtiel grabbed Dean’s shoulder and gently pushed him into the wall., with a hand flatly against his chest.
“And what I told you when I confessed. I meant it, and I always will, Dean. You do everything you do for love. Ask anyone here.” Castiel swept his hand over the seated guests. They were all nodding. “And you care so much. About everything. It can be exhausting at times, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything. You cared enough to make me care. It’s very hard to do that. You may be the first human to ever do that to an angel. I love you, too, Dean.” They both were crying quietly by this point.
“No, you called me a ‘bloodsucking freak’.” Sam’s eyes were starting to water. He had never forgotten that voicemail. He tried to, but he couldn’t.
“I was also wondering what you meant when you said that I was the most important one you let down.” At this, Castiel appeared uncomfortable. If he still had his grace, he could fly away. But he didn’t. He was an angel without his grace in love with a man who saved the world. He could feel a tear running down his cheek, and before he knew it, he was sobbing.
“Ooh, sounds spooky! I like! I will call back with any information I have! I love you!” And with that, she hung up.
“A serial killer who’s trying to hunt down my son, Jack, and I. He killed my wife, Jack’s mother, years ago.”
Jack smiled as he placed the final touches on the arch. He had already replaced the fluorescent lights with soft, yellow-orange ones, covered the walls invines, and put a layer of moss (that would never not be soft) on the ground. He switched to the eating decor (he was God, he could make things appear and disappear at will) to check that it, too, looked good. Then to the party decor. That looked good after a few tweaks. Namely, switching out the kegs for a classy barrel with a spigot look. He felt ready. He switched back to the ceremony look, then went back to the bunker.
“Who’s Naomi?” Dean had stood up when Castiel turned away, and was trying to help Castiel, knowing there wasn’t anything he could do.
Castiel paused for a moment, thinking. “Well, it’s because you are one of the few truly good angels. Most angels would follow orders without even thinking about if they were just or not. You never had to make that decision, but I think Jack is able to tell which decision you’d make. And I’m sure there were  more like you, but...” Castiel became very quiet, voice racked with guilt. “But you were the one I killed. You were one of the only kills I truly regret. Because you didn’t have to die.”
Nothing. Nothing different, that is. To be fair, he was only looking at the trunk. He decided to look at the rest of the garage to try to figure out what was special about them. Then he panned around to Castiel.
“You have Jack to thank for that. Gotta say, man, you somehow managed to not completely fuck him up. Now get up. There’s a few other guys who want to say hi.” Gabriel left the room.
“Put your hand down, Fergus.” Everyone looked to Rowena, who was sitting directly in front of Crowley, who was slowly lowering his hand.
“Okay, but the bunker’s warded against angels. As long as you two aren’t outside it at the same time, they can’t get to you.”
They got to the diner at 5:30. Aaron decided to call the Winchesters before they went in. Sam answered again.
“Ninety seconds. I’ll start the timer when you put it on.” Sam got his phone out and opened the timer, putting in 90 seconds. “Okay, I’m ready.”
“I wanted to watch the sunset.” Dean's voice sounded monotone, as if he didn’t really feel what he was saying.
We have a place you can stay at. It’s a Bunker in Lebanon, Kansas. It’s called quote ‘the safest place on Earth, warded against any evil ever created’. It was started by this secret society called the Men of Letters. It’s pretty sweet. Any signal coming from here can’t be traced any closer than 20 miles away.”
“Cas, if it’s not too much to ask, I don’t really want to be alone tonight. Do you mind staying with me?” Dean’s cheeks were red, and he was staring at their hands, gripping each other for dear life.
“Yes. And you’re Claire?” Jack sat in the center of his bed facing Claire. Sam had decided to get two rooms for the five of them. Both were double queens. He, Dean, and Castiel were in one room, though Castiel didn’t sleep, and Jack and Claire were in the other.
“Yes I am. Dad always taught us that being gay was bad, and I know that he was wrong, that it’s totally fine, hell, some of our best friends are gay. Well, Charlie, she’s lesbian.”
Dean looked taken aback. “The one where I apologized to you. I didn’t call you a monster. I said you were my brother. I also said I wasn’t Dad.”
“Mm. Yeah. Thanks... Cas... You’re the... Best. I... I l- Love you,” Dean said, with a slight smile, nudging his head into Castiel’s shoulder.
“They eventually pulled into a Route 6 Motel, and Dean stayed in the car while Castiel went in to get a room.
Once everyone was outside, Jack closed the barn doors and put his hand in the center of them. His hands glowed white, and white light seeped out of the cracks in the barn, then disappeared. Jack let his hands fall.
“Well, apart from the obvious being Hell, Purgatory, angels, demons, run-of-the-mill monsters, and things I already know about very well and could easily guess, what are some of the things that keep you up at night?” Castiel tilted his head at Dean and gave him a look that Dean couldn’t quite place, waiting for his response.
Dean took a few notecards out of his pocket, then put them back in. Castiel gave him a confused look. “Those were blank,” he whispered. Castiel nodded, smiling. Dean cleared his throat to speak louder.
Sam rolled his eyes, chuckling before he turned to go back to wherever he was before. Or, more likely, to the library to look up angel wings.
Looking up from texting Cas, he stopped cold in his tracks. There was a somewhat large group of people in the Library and War Room doing various things. Bobby and Rufus were going through different lore books, with Sam excitedly telling them stories about how he and Dean had killed monsters in the books. Ellen, Jo and Ash were chatting with Garth. Crowley and Death were having a heated argument, with Benny and Meg eavesdropping on them, looking fascinated. Charlie, Claire, Kaia, Alex, and Patience were looking at something on Charlie’s phone.  Jack was moving from group to group, giving greetings, until he noticed Dean. Everyone else was caught up with whatever they were doing, so Jack made his way over to Dean.
Castiel did a 360, then when he was facing Dean again, he spread his wings high above his head. “So, what do you think?”
“What do you want to do now?” Jack got up to look out the window. “There’s a diner across the street, and Sam gave me a card to use.”
“Yes! Gabriel said you guys would like a week at a nice hotel, so I Google’d the best hotels in America, since I assumed you’d want to stay in the country, and booked you the ‘Deluxe Parlor’, the best room in the joint. The address is written on the paper.There’s actually a second card in there, too. Jack hooked you up with a debit card in your name. Well, your first name. He wasn’t sure what you were going to do about your last name, but he can add that on whenever you make the decision. There’s one for you too, Cassie. Oh! And Sam already packed you guys clothes in the trunk. The matching luggage set is from him.”
Castiel looked down at Dean with so much love in his eyes, Dean thought it might kill him. “I feel great, Dean. You’re okay, you’re alive, and we just kissed. How could I be anything less than amazing.” Castiel hugged Dean tight to his chest. Dean managed to get his arms out from between his body and Castiel’s, and wrapped them around Castiel in return.
“Well, when I was born, my power opened a rift, and he was fighting with Mary, Sam and Dean’s mother, and they both fell through. I haven’t figured out yet how to open it back up.”
Castiel was back on Earth. He had touched the angel tablet. It must have broken the connection he had to Naomi. But at the moment, something else was on his mind. Something he could only ask right then.
The first thing that Dean noticed was that the lights were on. He blinked rapidly and rubbed his eyes, trying to get used to the sudden change in lighting.
Sam muttered the repetition out. They did it a few more times, Dean saying it, Saam repeating it back to him, until Dean could clearly hear every word Sam was saying. He then stood up and pulled Sam up into a hug. He could hear Sam cry quietly into his shoulder.
“I found it at a thrift store. I loved the color, but it was starting to fall apart, so I asked Jack if he could make it new again, and he did.”
Wings. Holy fucking wings. Black wings. Wings that went down to the bottom of Castiel’s trench coat. Wings. Wingswingswingswingswings. ANGEL WINGS.
“Okay, breathe with me. In, and out. In, and out. In, and out. Nice and easy.” Dean could tell Sam’s breath was getting steadier.
“Look, I hate to break up this romantic moment, but we have to get going. Now. Unless you want to be overrun with demons in the next few minutes, I suggest we keep this short and sweet. What do you say, Clarence?”
“Because I know you, Cas. I have known you since you pulled me out of Hell. You- You know...” Dean took another step toward Castiel. One more step and their noses would practically be touching.
“But why me” Why do I ‘deserve to be saved’? I mean look at me, man.” He looked over at Castiel with sad eyes. “I’m a mess. I couldn’t save that girl, much less myself. And, unlike other people, I know what comes next. I know I’m going to Hell, might as well arrive ahead of schedule.”
“I’ll get to those last, they’re harder to explain. The- let’s just call it the third time, because that’s what it feels like to me- The third time was when I killed Dick Roman, the king of the Leviathans, and went to Purgatory for a year. For those of you who don’t know,”he added after seeing a few looks of confusion, “Purgatory is where monsters go when they die. They fight and kill each other forever. It was by no means fun, but it was pure. A vampire named Benny showed me how to get out. HE also saved my life about fifty times.”
“Actually no, I’m sorry, My boyfriend’s mom just died, so do you mind if I take the rest of the day off to stay with him? He has no one else.” Castiel felt guilty at how easily the lie rolled off his tongue. Dean looked at him in surprise.
Realization slowly dawned in Castiel’s eyes, and he turned around, aligning his hips with Dean’s face.
“Cas!” he called out. There wasn’t even an echo of his voice, no vibration in whatever passed as air under the circumstances and no reaction whatsoever. “CASTIEL!” he yelled again, taking a few hesitant steps away from the safe proximity of the portal.
“She had a little congenital defect on her heart and she didn't know, even though it was already affecting her. It would have ruined her life in a few years,” the angel said, and picked up the second fork to fiddle with it.
“Dean, I don’t mean to be too forward here, but… Charlie has my number, just in case,” Cas remarked pointedly as he pulled on his trenchcoat, a subtle blush coloring his cheeks.
After some thinking Castiel nodded, and in the next moment he found himself with his back pressed tightly against Dean’s chest.
“He has something in his back, I’m not sure how far in or exactly where, I never even saw whatever it is. He thinks he’s dying and he’s unconscious. We have to hold him in place, can you help?”
All of a sudden, Devil’s Advocate made a loud, yelp-like sound, and Dean saw Emmaline’s head sticking out from her box, bared teeth still dangerously close to the Friesian’s rear end. It was obvious what had happened, and suddenly Dean saw red. “What the hell did you do, you stupid bitch? Biting is not allowed in this godforsaken stable, damn it!” He yelled at the mare, pushing her head back inside, and without thinking he slammed the upper half of the door closed too. That was something he had never done before, and Becky, who had witnessed the whole scene, was almost shaking in fear. She could feel the anger coming off of Dean in waves, and it was crippling her. For a moment she was afraid Dean would notice her rooted to the spot on the threshold, and maybe take a swing at her, but it didn’t happen. Dean sank to the ground, back against the wall of Emmaline’s stall. Devil’s Advocate nudged him gently, taking a step closer to Dean, and when the man reached out to stroke the horse’s neck, he took another step, and let Dean bury his face into his thick, pitch-black mane. Becky could see from the shaking of his shoulders that he was crying, and she turned around to leave him alone. Silently closing the entrance gate behind her, she leaned against it. The current situation wasn’t easy on her either, but she couldn’t even imagine how bad it must be for Dean. She was so absorbed in her thoughts that she didn’t notice Chuck sneaking up on her, and she cried out when he circled his arms around her from behind.
The Impala rumbled along the empty highway, headlights cutting through the dark. Dean at the wheel did his best to keep the ride as smooth as possible, occasionally sneaking glances into the rear-view mirror which was angled at the back seat, where Sam slept as sprawled as possible in the cramped space. Interspersed with these glances, he turned towards the passenger seat where Castiel sat, quiet and unmoving.
“Oh.” Samandriel focused on his milkshake, sinking down into the surprisingly soft booth. The angels finished their meal in silence.
Castiel opened the paper, and three cards fell out. “I thought Gabriel said there were only two cards?”
“I’m sick.” Dean turned his head so Sam could see half of his face. It was clear he’d been crying the whole time. His face was read, his nose was runny, and his voice just sounded sad now.
“Nope, I think the first time, I was shot in the chest, and then, in no particular order, slipped in the shower, poisoned by tacos, shot in the chest again, crushed under a falling piano, mauled by a dog, hit by a-” Dean noticed everyone staring behind him. Weird. He turned around to see Sam, his eyes glazing over.
“Dean. Here, let me try.” Castiel placed his hand over Dean’s, on his neck, and Dean could feel the familiar warmth of Grace, but when the feeling faded, he could still feel the wound on his neck.
“Jack!” Sam sounds surprised, almost as if he hasn't even noticed his presence before. There's a rustle, the leather of the backseat creaks and the Impala wobbles slightly. Dean assumes it's because Sam slid over and Jack sat down.
Somewhere else in the Bunker, a door creaks open then closes with a loud click, and as much as Dean’s enjoying getting handsy with Cas, he is not about to go down on him like he was planning to when there’s a risk that Sam or Jack could walk in on them. He pulls away with a disappointed sigh and fixes Cas’ robe.
“Okay, lovebirds, that’s more than enough now. Move!” One of the men ordered, and Castiel obeyed, as he promised he would. He knew it was risky, he couldn’t be sure they wouldn’t drag Dean along even though they promised not to, but he couldn’t stand the thought of Dean being held captive for a second longer, not if he could do something to prevent it. To his biggest relief, the men really did let Dean go after he climbed into the backseat of the car, and he turned around to look at him, as they drove off. One of the men still held him at gunpoint, but he wasn’t going to do anything. At least not now. Not until they left the estate.
“Meet Judas, the horse-in-a-poke. Chuck didn’t even see him before he saved his life, and bought him. He was abused before, and he was in a terrible shape when he first arrived here. By the way, he’s the one I was out with, when you drove past us.” Dean added, no edge in his voice. Still, Castiel felt the need to apologize once again, and he even patted Judas’s neck.
“I know. That’s why I know. Neither Sam nor Jack knew exactly where it was. So they asked me. I showed them this one. But I have no idea what they did with it.”
{[I’m skipping the rest of the events from 15x19, because I really don’t want to rewatch it, so we’re picking up at the beginning of the scene where Jack is God, and he has just brought everyone back.]}
“Dean... Has some problems with expressing his emotions. He bottles them up for a long time, then they all come out at once. This time, there was so much he tried to keep in that when I pried, he broke down and couldn’t handle it. He should be fine tomorrow. Well, not fine, but awake. I hope.”
“Yes. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. My head can’t seem to choose. I... I don’t know what to do.” Dean scooted closer to the edge. “I just know that there has to be one. I can’t have both.” Dean scooted even closer to the edge, supported almost all the way by his hands.
When it was over, Dean was mad enough to beat someone up. He got up from the chair, pushing it so hard that it fell back.
“Yes. I know this is a somewhat awkward situation, but I think you and your brother are the only ones who could help me.”
“Fuck you, man.” Dean put the shoe on, bag and ice cube included. “Hey, what do you know, it’s not so- Shit! Shit! God! What the Hell? Screw you, dick.” Dean started hopping around their room on one foot, cursing at Sam, who was laying on his bed in hysterics. After about a minute and fifteen seconds later, the timer started beeping, and Dean ripped off his shoe and sock with disgust. He took the bag with the, now melted, ice cube out of his shoe, tied it, and put it in the trash can.
“They pulled off the highway into Nashville, Tennessee fully prepared for the rest of their lives that they got to spend together.
“When I was dying, Castiel saved me by making a deal that it would take him when he was finally happy.”
Everyone seemed pretty content with the seating chart. People began to gather at the buffet table to get their food, then they sat at their tables and chatted with each other.
Everyone dispersed, except Death, who sat in a chair in the corner of the Library, reading a book. Upon closer inspection, Dean could tell it was ‘Death & Reapers’. Death glanced up at him. pulled a red pen out of his jacket, and started marking in it, no doubt correcting whatever was written. Dean made a mental note to look at the book after everything was over. He sighed and went over to Death.
“Does it have to do with the deal he made with the Empty?” Jack remembered when Castiel saved his life in Heaven.
Samandriel noticed Castiel first, and went over to him. “Hi. I’m not sure why Fath- Jack, he asked us to call him Jack-  brought me back. I mean, I know it was for your wedding, he explained that, but why me?” Samandriel looked at the floor sadly. Castiel lowered his head and caught his eye, remembering the last thing Sammie saw was Castiel killing him.
Dean was already crying, which he could tell he would be doing a lot of today. “Thank you. Seriously, thank you.” He hugged Jack, who happily hugged him back.
When they got back, Dean was in a deep sleep, so Jack transported him onto his bed. Sam went to the Library to research. What he should research, he had no idea but he had to do something.
Takes place the night they spent in Dodge City, in 13x6 “Tombstone” (One of my top 3 favorite episodes) TW for talk about sexual abuse.
“I should probably explain that.” Dean glanced around the room, seeing people mutter their agreement.
“Because you were here.” Castiel tilted his head at Dean, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
“Who’s your father? And why was he fighting with their mom?” Claire sat up on the edge of her bed to face Jack.
“What?” The guy standing in front of him stared at him as though he could read how Dean died on his face.
Castiel walked into the bedroom, through the odd, useless saloon doors. He already knew that Sam was asleep, and so was Jack, for about 2 hours, that is.
Castiel had just gotten back to the bunker from a hunt. He was walking to his room when he heard a quiet sniffle as he passed Dean’s room. After a moment of deliberating whether to go in or just ignore it, he decided to go in and check on Dean.
“When my mother, Kelly Kline, was still pregnant with me, I was somewhat aware and have little memories from there. I learned from her how to speak and understand English and the basics of everything.”
“Don’t rush this. We don’t have to hurry… we have time,” Castiel whispered into his ear, breath tickling his skin. After Dean’s answering nod, Castiel left a trail of wet, open-mouthed kisses on Dean’s jaw line and neck, before returning to his lips. Despite Dean’s proximity he shivered, and that snapped both of them out of their lust-induced haze.
“We haven't heard a peep from him in weeks, the radio silence could go on for only Chuck knows how long!” Dean jumped to his feet and started pacing up and down the length of the library.
“Okay.” Castiel nodded, and finished eating his eggs, casting a longing look at the coffee pot. Dean noticed it immediately, and only then did he realize that he forgot to pour coffee for Castiel.
“Call me a bitch again, and you can ask someone else to get food for you, jerk!” Sam answered, but without any real threat in his voice. He expected Dean to once again deliver his answer to the nickname, but the elder Winchester was too occupied with his food. Sam watched his brother wolf down the sandwiches, and empty the bottle of juice, which happened in a few short moments.
“They become clichés because they work, and I happen to think morning-after cuddling works perfectly,” the angel shrugged, his hand wantonly inching lower, “but I can stop if you're bothered...”
While he was away, Chuck bought a new horse. Dean referred to the action as “buying a horse in a poke”, as Chuck hadn’t even seen the horse before he bought him, saving the poor beast from the slaughterhouse. The horse-in-a-poke went by the name Judas. He was a huge, gold champagne colored gelding, with a white star on his face, and a fully-fledged fear of everything and anything. Though he was getting better and better in Dean’s loving care, it was still obvious that he’d been abused before, so Dean did everything he could to win Judas’ trust. Every day, he took him out for a short ride, and he noticed that somewhere deep Judas was an amazing horse, with great stamina and good pace, a real treat to ride on, and that only made him even more intent on fixing him. Their ride-outs always took place on a sandy, barely used back track on the estate, because that was the only way Dean could make sure that nothing could scare Judas even more.
“No,” Cas admonishes, leaning forward and turning slightly so he can look at him. “Taking care of people. Of me.”
A few minutes before eight o’clock he heard a car’s engine rumbling loudly. He looked out of the window, and saw a sleek black car nearing. He cast a last glance at himself in the mirror, and hurried downstairs to meet Dean. The other man was wearing black slacks with a red button-down shirt, and even though he looked a little uncomfortable in it, the smile on his face was bright.
“Well, if he’s okay with it, then I am too. It’s not like it would matter if I said no anyway…” Dean rolled his eyes.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel finally lifted his head about 10 minutes later, looking up at the man, blinking sleepily.
“No,” Castiel conceded with a sigh. “But your eagerness to put yourself into harm’s way is not helping,” he added a minute later.
“You don’t have to stop yourself.” The thought of Castiel taking control, and taking him made Dean’s blood boil.
“She does, doesn’t she?” Dean felt his smile grow wider and wider. “Now try sliding your hand up on her muzzle. If she lets you touch her between her eyes, you’re good to go. Horses have a blind spot in front of their foreheads, which means, they can’t see if something is there or not. They don’t see your hand under their noses either, but they can smell you, so they know you’re there,” he explained, but he wasn’t sure Castiel actually heard any of that, he was too busy caressing Gigette’s forehead and nose. She whickered, and pushed her head into the touch, making Castiel smile.
It should NOT be our job to give these characters a worthy ending. It should not be our job to give them the respect, the care, the love they deserved, but, alas… it is our job.
“So beautiful,” Cas mumbles, taking in the sight, and he leans down to nibble his way north to Dean’s lips, meeting them in a demanding, open-mouthed kiss. He shifts until he slots in perfectly on top of Dean’s glistening, slippery body, and he starts rocking into him without breaking the kiss.
Sam is slightly quicker to get back on his feet. Dean can still see him wobble, of course he can, and he wants to help him stay upright, but considering himself the stronger brother, the protector, the grown-up, has never before been a lie this big.
“What? You’re saying that if I told you that it was next to the pen and the practice track, halfway between my house and the main house, in front of the smaller garage, it would have helped?”
“Cas, you’re like a friggin’ child sometimes,” Dean smiled. He pulled off Castiel’s shoes and lifted his blanket to cover the other man with it before taking a shower. Under the spray of hot water Dean kept fantasizing about Castiel joining him, about them making love, but Castiel didn’t show, and when Dean emerged from the en-suite bathroom, he saw that Castiel was still asleep, but he shifted, and was currently taking up almost the whole double bed alone. That made Dean grin, and he lay down next to him, pulling him into his arms, until his back was flush against his chest and Dean could spoon against him. Even though this wasn’t really what Dean imagined when he thought about Castiel’s first night in his bed, deep down he had to admit, it was kinda nice to just hold him, listen to his quiet breathing, his scent filling his nose. Dean sighed, and then buried his face in Castiel’s hair, pressing a gentle kiss onto the top of his head, before closing his eyes, trying to fall asleep.
“Sometimes, I do. But sometimes, it’s the truth that hurts. The awakening. The awareness,” the Shadow raises its brows in menacing glee. “I think Dean will be quiet for a few hours, so you may want to get some sleep,” it suggests and waves its hand. The darkness around Cas becomes heavy, oppressive, and he once again struggles for breaths he doesn’t need, then blacks out.
Dean rested his back against the wall. Spending more time hunched over papers on his bed wasn’t going to be enjoyable, but Cas was clearly still on edge, almost vibrating with nervous energy. So, he kept the angel just at the edge of his peripheral vision, not looking at him directly, expecting something to happen. What happened not five minutes later was Castiel making a hasty escape, the door slamming shut behind him before Dean could have even turned his head to look.
Dean seems to contemplate that for some time, worrying at his bottom lip with his teeth. “But yours does?”
“Sorry, Dean,” Castiel smiled, settling down next to him, close enough to kiss, so he did, initiating for the first time. “I've wanted to do this for so long now,” he admitted in a whisper, caressing Dean's face with feather-light touches.
After he was let go, Dean stood rooted to the ground for almost a minute, before he could move again.
“I know what your point is. You need to keep moving, keep fighting, dodge punches... Anything to keep you from having to think.”
“And I started laughing loudly. Poor Chuck, he looked so terrified; he thought I was laughing at how bad his novel was, but I was laughing at something one of his characters said. I meant to tell him, but I couldn’t stop laughing for minutes, and by the time I did, he was already gone.”
“We could, but we won't, unless you promise me that you will not rush into anything headfirst tonight,” Castiel replied sternly.
Dean ducks his head as Jody’s “mom voice” tries to work its magic on him. “I’m not hijacking anything! Can someone explain why my kitchen and my… Cas are head-to-toe covered in flour?”
“You heard what he said: Shut the fuck up!” The other man interjected, and he let go of Castiel, positioning himself so that he could catch him if he started running. “Okay, offer accepted. Get into the fucking car, and I’ll let your boyfriend go.”
When he was done with the dishes, he went up to Dean’s room to get his clothes. After some thinking, he took one of Dean’s shirts and put it on. With his clothes in his hand, he walked out of the house.
The first of April had always been a special day for Dean Winchester. As a kid, it had been the time of plotting pranks, most of them at first against his younger brother, Sam, later against the girl (or boy) he’d been pining after at that moment. Later, after he’d stood up to his parents for the first time in his life, the first of April had became the anniversary of him leaving his childhood home, and starting a new life in a different environment, at the young age of barely eighteen. Now, fourteen years later, it was usually when he first let the horses in his care spend the whole day on the fields.
“Cas, you sure you weren’t a mermaid in your previous life? Or… I don’t know, a frog maybe?” Dean joked, and Castiel glared at him disapprovingly before flicking a fistful of water towards Dean. Only a couple of drops did actually reach him, but they were cold, and that made Dean shiver. “Oh, two can play this game.” He grinned, and splashed Castiel, covering him in huge wet spots from the waist down.
“For an angel, a decade feels a lot less in the grand scheme of things, plus the majority of the time, I had bigger fish to fry than to dwell on this, no matter how badly I wanted to be by your side, any way I could.” Castiel bit his bottom lip and seemed to make a decision to unload some weight. “I've known this was something else for longer than that. Ever since that alley, after you nearly said yes to Michael.”
“It's my fault you didn't know… I kept hurting the people I care about. Sam, Jack, Mom… you,” Dean hiccups.
“I’ve always expected too much from any given situation in my life, and when I didn’t get what I expected, I was disappointed. But since I’m here, I found that I’m still able to feel happy about little things, like a mug of sweet, milky coffee, a good night’s sleep, or a nice afternoon walk…” Castiel said softly a few minutes later, smiling brightly at his lover.
“Let me know if you need anything.” she nodded, and walked away. “Come on people, don’t just stand around there, for fuck’s sake!” she yelled at her team, “We can’t do much until the unit arrives, but someone should seal off the perimeter. Oh, and call the bay guards already, we need to know what’s going on down there.”
“Um...” Dean took a deep breath, unable to form coherent sentences. He just kept staring at Castiel. Or rather, at a vague space near Castiel.
“I don’t want your apology. I want my brother back.” Dean dropped his hand, releasing Castiel. He turned away, trying to keep what little composure he had left. “I can’t lose him, not- Not again. Not this soon, Cas, I- I don’t think I’ll be able to handle it.”
Rewritten version of the crypt scene when they find the angel tablet. To be clear, this was rewritten completely from my memory, so if it is very wrong, I apologize.
“You’re going to be glad I have grace, else you wouldn’t be able to sit right for a week. Got that?” Dean gulped and nodded excitedly in anticipation for when they got back to the bunker.
“Okay.” Dean stood up and helped Sam up. “I want burgers. I’m going to get burgers. You want some? From that diner in town? Ask Mini Satan if he wants anything and text me.” He went over to the door to go down.
“Hey, Dean. You’re not a killer. Trust me. Look- Look at me. You’re not a killer. You are the best person I know, and I’ve met a lot of people. More than you can comprehend. And out of all of them, the only one who I cared about enough to die for is you.” Castiel had tears flowing down his face now, matching Dean’s.
It had been an innocent question, so innocent in fact that it stung to even think about lying to Sammy, let alone doing it. But I’d been sworn onto every oath my Dad could think of to keep his whereabouts quiet, to keep Sam in the dark, warning me in great detail of the toll it could have on my “impressionable little brother” if he knew that he went out every night. To work is what he told me. I didn’t see what was so wrong with Sam knowing our father worked a ton, that maybe he’d even be proud someday to have such a hardworking dad, but he wouldn’t have it. I had to lie, and eventually my intuition had reached a point where I understood why.
As the other two entities walked out the door, causing that same bell to give a jingle that now rang harshly in my ears, since the usual hop and bustle of the pub had died down at that late hour, my eyes flicked upward to the clock above my head and I read the time: 1:58 AM. We closed in two minutes, and I knew I was now obligated to cut the mystery man off and ask for his method of payment for the last couple drinks.
I gave Charlie Bradbury one final nod, conveying all the appreciation, gratitude, and love for her and her wise ways that I possibly could, before spinning around on my heels, wrapping my coat further around my middle, and following the exact path that Dean had upon exiting. Just as I entered the freezing cold outdoors, however, I heard her call one last thing, her statement of absolute victory over me and my denial,
“You guys were really busy tonight, hm?” He asked, arching his neck upwards so we could speak face-to-face.
“If I hadn’t have had Dean, I wouldn’t even be here right now. He put up with all your bullshit, all these years, stuck it out for me, and you have the nerve to say that at least one of us doesn’t know what it’s like?”
I knew what the usual was, and the satisfaction in having that knowledge far exceeded that of beating Charlie to the punch during our earlier conversation. As I poured the scotch and made sure to add no ice to the sleek glass, I longed for the day when the action became muscle memory and needed no instruction, for when it was instinct, and for when the impending nerves of speaking to this Dean Winchester were but a distant memory of an awkward past-
“Yes, of course,” I replied. “It...it seems like this was rather out of the blue though, if you don’t mind me saying so.”
“I am too. Didn’t see it coming, really,” he answered, honestly, and while it did little to ease my nerves, I was grateful for Sam. I’d never met him, but if my judgment proved mostly correct, it must’ve been Dean’s younger brother that had alleviated whatever tension was between them. I knew that there was no way Dean would’ve been able to swallow down the hurt and the guilt to make amends on his own.
Anyways, the car-lover persona did suit the look he had made for himself, all the way to the part of his hair down to the scent of his very much broken-in leather overcoat.  Soon after handing the newly replenished drink over to Dean, I settled on my theory and uttered a satisfied sigh, one that I hoped was not as loud as I had made it seem. The new drink earned no response from Dean, and he even waited until I had walked a ways away before reaching forward to grab it and begin his self-destructive process all over again, but still I watched him.
Instead of my hurried pace improving the amount of time it took me to properly adjust my belt, my fingers only continued to fumble along its surface, and it wasn’t finally secure until the leathery source of my mental torment had sat down on a barstool, this one closer to his fellow bar dwellers than before, let out several puffs of anger, and taken his time to run his eyes up and down my figure, examining just what the hell I was doing.
“Dad, are you KIDDING ME right now?!” Sam shouted, with desperation flooding into his voice, but Dad ignored him without so much as a pause in his relentless output of denial and defense.
With one final look at the now dark and vacant pub, for I had turned off the lights and made yet another check for any possible intruders, unable to turn off my impenetrable paranoia,  I closed the door and let it lock behind me. Within a few moments of walking towards my car, seated in the rear employee parking lot, I noticed the new spring in my step and the still, ever-present voice in my head, speaking to me like a song stuck in my head, but the meaning of the tune just kept eluding me. The drive home was full of the noise, it echoed off of my shower’s walls, and it played behind my eyes and seeped into my dreams, and I knew I was in far too deep. Redemption was definite. Victory was an absolute.
“He’s always been the kind to look on the bright side of things,” Dean whispered once a few moments had passed, with a wonderfully fond tone to his words. “But I don’t know, he could be in over his head with this one.”
“I do appreciate the rescue,” I chuckled, a little dryly, because my eyes and general attention didn’t want to focus on anything.
A priest had given me his take on the Catholic marriage process and how he found it painful and much too extensive, and how he really didn’t get the anti-same-sex priests he came in contact with daily. His response to the issue made me smile wide, for real this time and without the inklings of existential terror.
He looked sad, distressed, and very much broken and exposed. The angry had transformed into a raw kind of helplessness, the side effect most borderline, or full-blown, alcoholics, tended to forget about in my experience. His face hung loosely, unable to contain any true emotion in his face other than that lost and bored kind of depression, and I could only imagine what the waves and waves of intoxication looked like as they swirled inside of him. Certainly what was on the outside was nothing compared to within.
I certainly didn’t have the mental capacity to think about Dean’s voice, his mannerisms, the very way he held glasses, how he’d told me to keep the dubious amounts of change he accumulated, the way he was so defiant and insistent on not speaking to me, in some ridiculous fear of being seen as weak, and the way I’d finally convinced him otherwise.
I would be lying if I said that the rest of the night was any more eventful, at least until the end. I was served with a few pressingly amused smirks from Charlie from behind the kitchen’s doors that I did my best to ignore, of course. I learned all about a man who’d caught himself in a huge lie about his online alias: a woman of merely twenty one. (Supposedly the profile, made on some website I did not partake in nor have an account on, was only for a temporary joke but multiple people had caught wind of its existence. He assured me he was no creep, just a sadly misunderstood jokester. I didn’t know what to believe.) In between the ups and downs of this middle-aged, round around the middle man of around of, I estimated, fifty-three’s story, I snuck glances at Dean sitting just five bar-stools away with his elbows heavy on the wooden surface and eyes trained on what looked like a divot in it’s face from where someone must’ve dropped a beer keg. There was no thought in his eyes, just alcohol in his throat and minimal intent in his brain.
