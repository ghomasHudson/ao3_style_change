Steve looked a little formal, and Tony wouldn't laugh at him for finding him with the same hands and feet, because he was also busy controlling his heartbeat.
The air freezes for a few seconds from the silence, and Tony looks up just in time to see Steve's slyly glinting eyes, which makes him smile in return.
Tony sighed in annoyance at his name calling, half jealous, half proud of the way the military uniform didn't look a bit out of place on him, still making the man in front of him look as handsome and straight as he did when he was younger.
"Steve," Tony murmured sleepily, sensing his movement, groping to lean closer, turning Steve around, then subconsciously hugging him, leaving a kiss on his neck and murmuring, "You're safe, baby. "
"How did you know." Tony barely swallowed the contents of his mouth and took a tissue to help his daughter wipe the chocolate off the side of her mouth.
Tony walked over to pick Morgan up gently, she was awakened by this small gesture, and after realizing it was Tony holding her, yawned and tried to fall back asleep in her father's arms.
Not that he intended to explore where Steve had put things, he found it by accident, but he had known for a long time that Steve liked to hide everything in the closet, and it was good that Steve did not realize that Tony had found his habit long ago.
Steve stole a glance at Tony with the rest of his eyes, he was kicking a piece of gravel with the toe of his shoe, his gaze focused as if he could build an armor out of it, but he was Tony Stark，Steve wouldn't be surprised at all, if Steve actually found out one day that he had built an armor out of stone.
"Just doing what we all do." Steve responded gently, using the momentum to pull Tony closer and claim a kiss from the other man, "You'd do the same thing in your place, honey."
"You know, Peggy's relatives, which would be awkward, to use your words." Steve's eyes wandered and he whispered.
"You better be able to," Steve nimbly dodged the incoming lasers and used the strength of the wall to jump on one of the destruction robots "because there are just - too many of them."
Steve Rogers choked and poked Tony with his elbow, in return for a smug smile, Steve sighed in annoyance and gave Tony's ass a squeeze where the crowd couldn't see it.
"Do you always speak so directly?" Tony rubbed his neck and asked back somewhat helplessly, while Natasha just shrugged her shoulders without guilt, as if to tell him that there was no need to beat around the bush between them.
"Yeah," the engineer shrugged, tugging Steve into another kiss, "you're just too bad at selling, old man, remind me never to throw you into SI's sales department. You should have said, Mr. Steve Rogers, that there was another reason enough for me to want to marry him."
"Probably because the man loves me, I mean, anyone loves me, I'm a Stark after all," Tony shrugged slightly, "only this one is going to love a little longer."
"That's good, there's strength in numbers, though not on our side." Tony said playfully, Steve was exhausted but still gave a smile because of it.
Morgan came around from across the table, hugged her father head-on, and whispered in his ear, "Mom told me to tell you that you'd be stupid not to agree, and she must have come over from home to knock you up."
Tony unscrewed the faucet and splashed some water on his face, and when he looked up he could see in the bathroom mirror that Steve was leaning against the door with his arms wrapped around him, watching him.
"I wouldn't call this 'manageable'," it took a little while before Steve heard a familiar voice in his ears, "Hold on Cap, I think I've been able to fix the root code problem with these robots. "
"You felt that the age issue was a barrier, weren't sure you were the right person to marry, and didn't think Steve would necessarily be able to go all the way with you." The female spy cut to the chase, "Most importantly, because of Morgan."
Probably loving each other is the hardest thing in the world, Steve thought, and despite the different paths to the conclusion, they eventually came to the same conclusion. *
Love does not save the world, nor can it solve all problems, but the wounds left by conflict, the pain etched by separation, can be healed by love.
"Stubbornness can be a plus." Tony cooed against his lips, his warm breath wrapping around Steve, soaking his body with warmth for it.
Steve's eyes widened in shock as Tony didn't move away, just half propped himself up and gazed earnestly into his eyes.
Even after all these years, Tony still gets dizzy over that smile. At the moment he had to admit that Pepper was right, because no words were needed, he could see Steve's love through just one look.
"No kidding, I'm 83 years old and still unmarried. A month ago Pepper brought her grandson to see me and asked me why Captain America hadn't proposed to me yet. I said how the hell should I know, maybe it's because his brain is frozen. That's not quite right, don't you think, Rogers?"
Tony did a quick mental calculation, then realized, "That's even a little earlier than he asked me."
"On the bright side, I don't even know if I can wait for the seven-year itch." Tony regretted the words almost as soon as they were spoken, he looked up at his husband, and as expected Steve instantly turned quite pale.
"To prove how important I am?" Tony asked rhetorically, "Look, I'm trying to look somewhat useful, and you won't let me go to the lab anymore, so I feel the need to do something about it."
"Well, it seems I can't control the kids," Tony said in mock distress, rubbing his forehead as he looked at Steve through a gap in his fingers, "You've got to do something about it, Mom."
"I think you've made your choice," Natasha sat back "And, Tony, you yourself understand that Steve only asked you to marry him because he loves you, and there's no way he'd choose anyone else to marry."
Still, for a long time afterwards he kept coming back to that smile and that sudden blush that overtook Cap's face, and try as he might, he couldn't stop thinking about him.
"Sorry. Too late. It's been named now. Nothing you can do about it." Reed had paused. "You got it for him so bad," he had said. "Don't you?"
that eyes are a mirror of the soul, he thought, they are just an organ dammit, they don't tell you anything). He wanted Steve to not look away. He wanted Steve to show something, give him something, just a glimmer of hope. Just a hint that he felt anything, wanted anything from Tony that he didn't want from, say, Rhodey. Yes, they'd worked together marvelously during the war, and working beside Steve had felt like finding and old pair of jeans, and slipping them on, all soft from wear and years, and finding out they still fit so perfectly. And then... One night, after the fighting had been particularly bad, they'd gotten drunk – the two of them and Thor. And the later part of the evening was a bit of a blur for him, sliding uncontrollably into the blackout. He couldn't be sure now, but he thought they might have talked about the bad blood that was still there. No, they did talk about it, although Tony remembered the conversation in patches only – but those were important patches. They had patched up some of his heart quite nicely. There were even a few tears and some hugging, he thought, but that part he was mostly too embarrassed to think about.
" Tony shifted. Steve felt good and solid against his back, and too cozy by far, but that wasn't all; Tony had a ridiculous feeling he could understand him better due to the physical touch. "Yeah, I get that, actually. You probably shouldn't be telling me this, though. By the way – I kind of dig the new outfit, but you should do something about that plunging neckline. It comes off as immodest."
Steve gave him a worried look. “Not good?” It seemed they were unable to string more than two words together, between them.
Steve was of course standing right there, as if he'd never even moved away, his right hand raised as if to knock again. (The skis still lay on the ground behind him, though.)
When Steve was sick as a child, his mom would sometimes read to him, when she had time. This wasn't like that at all and it was a silly idea. Firmly, he stomped on it. Stared at the page. Sneaked a look at Tony, who had now turned around and seemed to be blinking at him. In the firelight, his eyes looked huge.
Tony: Fuck, now it's all weird, talking about this, isn't it? Why'd you have to go and make it weird.
Steve, as soon as humanly possible. He also had a jet waiting to take him and Pepper to Beijing for a business meeting; his schedule was more packed than ever these days. As per usual, the world wouldn't leave them be even for a moment.
"Cap, I..." He swallowed. "Thanks." For a moment there was something so vulnerable in his eyes that Steve badly wanted to do something stupid. Instead he managed to shrug noncommittally, fumbling for the doorknob behind his back as if it were a life belt. He just wanted to get out and
Faint rustling made Tony look back over his shoulder. Still cocooned in blankets, Steve was scrambling into a sitting position on the couch. His hair, longer than he used to wear when he was younger, now drying, stuck out at weird angles, and there were two feverishly red spots on his cheeks. He looked unfairly pretty like that, too, on Tony's couch, blankets and everything. Soft and a little sleepy and very, very human. He blinked at Tony and tried on a little smile.
Still, it appeared Steve wasn't exactly listening. It seemed to Tony he was intently staring down the corridor, but that was impossible, wasn't it? Did he hear someone coming?
His phone beeped, but despite a wild surge of hope – unfounded, since Steve wasn't much of a texter – he saw a years old, redheaded, longhaired picture appear on screen.
But since it's me now... I don't know anything about PR. And I don't work for any state, all the states want to lock me up, so I don't give a damn about their secrets any longer. And if you think you might panic, then don't watch this. But you'll have to determine for yourselves, I'm afraid. When Nat... When Black Widow and Steve Rogers took SHIELD down a few years back, they leaked all the info, put it on the internet. It was freely available until, well, until fairly recently, I'd say. Now it's nowhere to be found. But I'm doing this in the same spirit. I'm also going to assume you know what happened there, you had enough time to sift through the data, there were a few pretty good analytical pieces too. They should still be available on wayback machine, I think, if nowhere else. Oh, shit, maybe I shouldn't have... Nat, do we edit this out? No? Okay, so if you find them, repost them, then, all right?
Tony huffed. "Peter! I can’t believe you’d talk to your super-science father like that!" He clutched at his heart dramatically. The bubbling joy had to go somewhere, after all. He wasn't sure if it was his or Steve's but did it really matter?  "Is this the thanks I get, after feeding you and housing you for the last," he glanced at the kitchen clock, "fifteen hours and sixteen minutes?"
being an Avenger, a hero. But this is all I can do. I can't let shit happen, I can let people die, and stay idle. I
Or was it? Steve stood there, shifting from foot to foot, looking now at Tony, now at the table. He seemed pensive and... he
"I can pretend to explain the science I don't totally understand yet, if you want me to, but..." Steve didn't, it seemed. Not right at that moment, at least. Tony felt him shift, and a firm hand sneaked around Tony's waist; Steve  glanced at him from a corner of his eye. Still, all he said (quite nonchalantly, Tony had to give him that) was: "The alien mist, then?"
Steve smiled a little, hands moving to his own buttons.  “Any time I get to spend with you is a reward.”
Tony blinked, his mouth half open – and then he started to laugh.  “You – what?  Steve, that’s the cardinal rule in the Tower, don’t drink my coffee.”
“I didn’t say that either.”  Steve dropped his head to rest his forehead against Tony’s.  “These people… mostly the women… they look at me like I’m…”  He searched for a way to convey his feeling without sounding crass.  “Edible.  Eligible.”
He'd never laughed as much during sex as he did with Tony, Steve reflected as he chuckled again -- but he did start to move.  He pulled almost completely out, then leaned close enough to whisper, "Ten" as he pushed all the way in, reveling in the slap of leather against skin.
“I’ll fix it when I’m done,” Tony promised.  He finally managed to slide Steve’s tie off his neck, rapidly unbuttoning the collar so that he could bury his neck in the warmth there.  “So beautiful all dressed up – ”
That changed when Tony returned to the Tower after a mission in the Middle East – one that he never should have been sent on, because it meant he had to fly over the desert he’d been held captive in those years ago.
Tony drank it all down, humming contentedly.  When Steve was limp with satiation, Tony carefully tucked him back into that splendid suit and put him back to rights.  Steve was still a little dazed when Tony finished retying his tie, patting it into place with a proprietary air.  “Thank you,” Tony murmured, leaning in to kiss Steve.
Steve raised an eyebrow.  “About two male lovers running the most powerful team in the world?”  He squeezed Tony’s hand.  “I can get on the horn to the Howlies that are left – they can attest to the fact that it doesn’t hurt a team.”
"Oh, fuck, yes -- right there," Tony groaned.  His legs threatened to give out on him, but he knew he wouldn't fall -- Steve had him.  God, did Steve have him.  "Now, please, Steve, I need you."  Steve's fingers thrust again, twice more.  "Please, Steve.  God, I need you."
Tony laughed, bouncing Steve on his chest.  "Yeah, J got them as soon as we landed."  He tugged at Steve, brought their lips together for one more long kiss.  "Sex that good is not an incentive to keep from breaking protocol."
Steve tugged Tony to a standing position, then cupped his face with both hands and kissed him.  “Deal.”  He pressed their foreheads together again, just for a breath.  “I love you, Anthony Stark.”
“You got no idea, doll.”  Steve added a third love bite before switching tactics.  He lifted Tony a little higher and slid a finger to his hole.  Cursing, he realized he’d once again forgotten the lube – only to be handed a small packet of it by his smirking lover.  “Thought I was the boy scout here,” Steve said wryly.
“God, yes.”  Tony tugged at Steve’s hair, trying to bring him up close enough to kiss.  Yeah.  Kissing Steve was as paramount as breathing right now.
“I don’t know,” Natasha drawled, and Tony’s eyes snapped to hers.  “The anxiety sucked, but watching our good captain go all gooey taking care of you was pretty adorable.”
Tony’s hands weren’t entirely steady – but they appeared to have mutually decided to ignore that.  “Like that we take turns,” Tony said quietly as he carefully worked a finger into Steve.  “That you like both.”
Steve bit back a remark about how lovely that ass was, considering all of them were in the gym.  “Humor me.  I’d like you to spar with Clint.  I’ll pair with Bruce – Thor can work with Natasha.”
Tony gasped.  “God, don’t fucking call me that or this is going to be over too fast, and I really want to feel you come on my cock.”
“I know that.”  Tony was already dressed, standing in front of a mirror trying not to obsess.  Was his pocket square symmetrical?  Shoes buffed perfectly?  Any hair out of place on his goatee?
Finally dragging himself out of medical, Steve was almost surprised that Tony was still dogging his steps.  “You don’t have to stay.”
Steve’s eyes met and held his.  “Does partners mean we aren’t hiding anymore?  Because as hot as it is to sneak around – I think I’d like to take my best guy out on a date.”
Tony rocked his hips against Steve’s hand, wanton and desperate.  It took so little for him to be out of his mind with lust for Steve – had since the very beginning.  Speaking openly of their emotions had only added to that.
Steve’s eyes danced merrily.  “I’m pretty sure that while your cock is up my ass, you’re not thinking anything ‘straight.’”
Laughing, Tony sat up more fully and shucked his shirt off, squirming off Steve to peel his sweatpants off as well.  “You need to lose your shirt too, then.”
“You got somethin’ against the gym?”  Steve tightened his hand around the nape of Tony’s neck.  “Want you right here on the mats.”
“Yup.”  Tony made a show of getting comfortable, grinning up at his partner.  “If you’re really tempting, I might have to jack off.  Just a little, you know, to get warmed up.”
Blinking, Tony realized he might maybe have pushed the good captain just a little too far.  “I knew I needed to take out the control mechanism to stop the robots,” Tony explained in a more level tone.
Tony’s hips bucked against Steve.  “All for you,” Tony promised.  “Everything I have and everything I am.”  He repeated Steve’s words from earlier back to him, watching his love’s eyes light up in recognition.
“There is nothing I will not do to keep him safe and happy.  Do you understand me?”  Rhodey leaned forward, his eyes intent.  “I do not care about your rank or your enhancements.  If you leave him broken, there will be nowhere safe for you to run.  Is that clear?”
“Yes and yes – God, yes.”  Tony arched up against Steve, his own cock trapped between them.  “I’m so close, Steve.”
“Pure dumb luck?” he guessed, dropping another kiss to Tony’s lips.  “You and me, babydoll, it’s always gonna be good.”
Tony didn’t argue – just started to clean up.  They were both sweaty and gross – it hadn’t been a quick fight.  He might have ordinarily objected to getting clean just so they could get dirty again… but he didn’t particularly want to get the bed this filthy either.
“It’s a good thing the team approves,” Tony said ruefully.  He started to shimmy back into his undersuit.  “Can you imagine the hell if Natasha decided she wanted to keep us from slipping away?”
“God, you’re adorable.”  Tony chuckled.  “Suppose it’s only fair, I call you sugar in my head.”  He rolled his hips.  “I know you’re being all tender, sweetheart – but I’d really like to feel you inside me, and be able to kiss you.”
"I love it when you beg."  Steve pulled his fingers out of Tony, making the engineer whimper again.  "I ain't takin' you dry."  He twisted, reaching for a pocket on his uniform pants and extracting a small bottle of lube.
The dust had settled on the latest fight -- in this case, quite literally, as there was concrete dust in the air -- and Steve could feel the two warring desires.  On one hand, he should take his team back to the Tower or SHIELD to debrief.  Analyze the fight, coordinate recovery and repair operations, see that his men and Natasha got checked out by medical, got food and sleep.
The young woman flushed – most did, when faced with a smiling Steve Rogers.  “The cast would like to invite you to meet them backstage, if you’re… interested?”
Tony pulled his fingers free and quickly replaced them with his cock.  He’d been hard as hell for what felt like an hour – but moreover, he didn’t want Steve to feel empty right now.  He pushed in slowly, groaning at the tight heat.  “Better, baby?”  Tony asked.  He propped himself up on one hand, using the other to stroke Steve’s face.
"There was a branch," the guy said. "From a tree?" he added as if it needed further explanation. "It was about to crash down on your car."
With ridiculously little success, he tugs at Steve's arm, trying to get him to a safer position, trying to interpose himself between Steve and the bullets. "Get behind me," Tony hisses in frustration.
Cap was suddenly much closer. Tony wasn't sure when that happened. The man seemed about to say something, but Tony beat him to it. "What's a pretty guy like you doing at a place like this?" The question fell out of his mouth of its own volition and hung in the air like poison gas. He had this tendency to spurt whatever words crossed his mind at any given time; especially when he felt the metal walls pressing down on him this intensely.
," Steve said. He was trying to hold the laughter in, but it kept slipping through the cracks and bubbling to the surface. "I know what it looks like, but it's a leg, I
"Let's see how this goes," Steve said in a neutral voice. "If it works out, I may ask you to do it a few more times."
"I know what you mean," Tony says quickly. He hasn't looked at it that way, and also, he's desperate not to let the conversation die. "If one person is in love with another, but says nothing. And that other person is in love with the first person, and also says nothing..." He wants to hit himself on the head, because his words are falling out of his mouth without his consent and, especially, without thinking.
"Because you wouldn't have believed me anyway, at that moment. You just... assume the worst." A reluctant pause. "And because sometimes you drive me crazy. But it's good to see you, even like this." He sighed. "I really missed you. "
Steve's arm sneaked around Tony's waist, but gently. He didn't pull him closer, just let it rest there. It somehow felt bursting with kinetic energy, though, as if it took an enormous effort of will to keep it still.
"I was kicked out," he said lightly. "A discipline violation, first class. Inconceivable, for someone like me, I know" he added wryly.
Tony opened his eyes to glance at him, and Steve propped himself up, leaning on an elbow, looking down into his face.
"First of all, take the jacket back, you'll freeze your ass off. I'm warm now," Tony said and despite Steve's protestations pulled the jacket off over his head, clumsily, because of the damn zipper. "Second of all, don't worry. I'm absolutely awesome at renting a separate room and figuring things from there. You're too sweet to be a rebound for an old fucker like myself. But we could hang out if you want."
"Who says I'd jump into bed with you?" I retorted, this time managing to grin back. Partly, it was a lie, and partly not. There were other muscles besides the ones needed for smiling that stirred back to life in his presence. But I was used to wanting Tony. The desire always smoldered somewhere inside me when he was present; it was an automatic reaction by now, as was keeping it in check, always. But the only thing my heart wanted right now was to bask in his presence; to look, maybe to touch a bit, and to become accustomed to the idea of being around him. And my mind was crystal clear on what
And what he really wanted was to put the rest of his life on hold, and stay here, in this crappy little town, and take Steve out for movie dates and ice-cream every night.
Still, that was trivial, I told myself sternly. How could I worry about nicknames when Tony was in obvious distress. Gently, I took both his hands in mine. He let me, or, more precisely, he didn't resist. "Tony," I said in my best steady voice and squeezed his hands softly. "Tony are you
Natasha leaned against the wall and studied him for a moment. "You're really worried," she said in mild wonder. "Steve, do you think it matters, really? Everyone's living on borrowed time here. Who here is going to survive this? Why are you making me say the things you already know?" Suddenly she sounded exasperated. Her words finally rang true, and Steve realized all her other remarks had seemed somehow hollow. Maybe it was because he actually knew her too well. Either that or because he was attributing his own thoughts and feelings to her. Or was she just voicing the general undercurrent of quiet despair and apathy, running rampant among the crew, which was one of the reasons everyone was so fucking cheerful when they weren't having secret nervous breakdowns or getting drunk?
Tony knew he should say something. He knew that. This took too long. But when he finally opened his mouth, the only thing that came out was a weak cough (into his hankie, carefully).
when you mean Fury," he said reproachfully. "And you know it's not about that. It's... I don't know how to put it. I feel like, if we let one thing like that slip..."
"Perhaps I'm here because I decided to go sit in my own room for a while," he replies, feigning indignation. "I still have my room here, right?"
He'd seen Stark on TV before. He'd watched a few press conferences with curiosity; it sometimes seemed all the man was doing was attend press conferences. Steve always thought he was so much like Howard: a showman, a lover of spotlight. A happy egocentric that couldn't do wrong, at least in his own eyes. But while Howard had a certain enthusiastic innocence about him, back when Steve knew him, his son seemed to possess a large dose of sardonicism. Howard could be a happy mess. This Tony had a different sort of charisma, a one that appealed to Steve far less. He was always perfectly groomed. Always in possession of himself. Always knew very well what he was doing and where he was aiming his poisonous darts.
to go check the engine. Evidently no one else was dealing with it or not dealing with it fast enough. Things could deteriorate rapidly.
Suddenly, he's scared. What he's about to do is turn past tense into present tense, and it's impulsive, and it's fucking scary.
Steve looks at him in utter disbelief. Still, before he has time to retort, something in his face changes. Roughly, he pushes Tony to the ground, throwing himself on top of him. Which,
"All right there, Cap?" Tony asked lightly. It was as if he was stuck in a loop. This seemed the one and only sentence he was able to say to Steve.
Steve came over, sat on a stool opposite Tony. Made an attempt at a smile. (Which... didn't look half so bad, Tony mused.) "Can I make you some tea or something?"
"In that case, I don't want to come." They seemed to be interrupting each other a whole lot more then they usually did. Still, now there was a silence. It stretched.
Still, what drew Steve most, perhaps, was a third Tony – the laughing, whooping one that emerged when Tony strapped himself into the simulator, and the lights went off, and the guarded expression fell away from his face within seconds, and genuine, contagious excitement took over. He was truly talented, and a little crazy, and bold as brass. If he acted like that out there in the Black, he'd either get killed off first thing (another idea that absolutely didn't bear thinking about) or grow to be a real pilot pretty quickly.
And now, Stark sounded exactly like the footage Steve saw on TV and found on youtube in the library (well, he'd been curious). And, again, it sounded nothing like it. Tony could obviously run circles around everyone and anyone and turn a conversation into whatever he wanted it to be – but right here, right now, Steve didn't sense any malice. It was just teasing.
movements! I breathe in, breathe out. The prospect of seeing his face again is suddenly scary. I'm not afraid of his reaction; I'm afraid of my own. I'm supposed to go look at his features and treat him as an almost-stranger? How do I explain to my heart this isn't the man I spent 40 years married to? Well – is and isn't. My whole body longs for him, every cell craves his nearness.
to run into someone, because there would be people on shift. Only, what condition would they be in? Well. There's your million dollar question. Tony almost didn't want to find out. At this point, hope was beginning to seem somehow frivolous.
It's Tony's turn to swallow. The words are hard to get out. "I do want you," he says, and it's only half of the truth, but all of it would be too overwhelming. "Pretty badly, actually," he admits.
Tony: Gee, Steve, I don't know. Did he have the authority to as good as put a shoot to kill order on you back in Germany?
"Hey, Winghead." (That was his old nickname from their academy days. Steve had been sure it would end up as his callsign, but it never did.)
There are some things you can do if you try hard enough, if you are brave and stubborn and unwilling to give up, and he's done a lion's share over the years; and then there are some things that are undoable. He can't leave Tony's side. There's nothing more to it. He can't.
With care, Steve put the photo back on the shelf. "No?" This wasn't what Tony said the last time they tried talking about it. Given, he'd been exhausted and emaciated and not at his most rational, surely; still, every word he'd said had hit Steve like a perfectly aimed arrow. It had lodged in his heart and stayed there.
"Hey, Cap. Nothing’s wrong," Tony hurried to assure him. "It’s just..." He was hearing his own voice, he really was. It sounded positively vibrant with excitement. There was absolutely nothing he could do about it either. Actually hearing Steve's voice after all this time, actually being on the phone with him – it gave him such a rush that all he could do was let go and be carried with it. It didn't feel as wrong as a part of him thought it should. "I wanted to tell you that Peter's okay. I just saw him. He's fine."
"I suppose the Ancient One knows what she's talking about," I said dutifully. "She sure knew how to get me here."
"We never hung out, just the two of us. You know. Movies. Games. Meeting for lunch. Whatever." And now that Tony can't have those things, because it's
In the diner, the air was warm and smelled of cinnamon and apples and perpetually recycled frying oil. It was a most holiday-like mixture. There were no eyeballs and hooves in sight. The diner was otherwise empty. They sat down.
Tony starts fucking him for real, then, hard, robustly, hitting his prostate on each go. Steve feels it build, like a wave that swallows another inch of the strand on each lap, reaching, reaching. And sometimes Tony twists his fingers together, and sometimes they are side by side; he moves and shifts them inside of Steve, all the while fucking him, and Steve is very aware of every additional stretch, of every spot of his inner wall that was previously left untouched, perhaps, but now is thoroughly rubbed and stretched and stimulated. His sweet spot sings with short bursts of white pleasure and pain whenever Tony slams into it. This is when Steve lets go. He's not aware of his arms, stretched painfully above his head. He has no idea where his legs are – it's like they are floating somewhere away, in the distance. All he knows are the sweet, agonizing explosions inside of him, and his cock, that seems thicker than ever, full to bursting, crying for a relief that isn't coming. He lets out a short, explosive breath from the bottom of his stomach every time Tony slams in, and all he can do is lie there, taking it, wanting it, chasing the sensation, but he can't, he can't come; it's almost there, but that makes this torture even worse because try as he might, Steve can't reach it.
Could you let me know if the Peter child you'd brought to Germany is ok? This will sound strange, but Steve has been having very peculiar dreams for weeks now. He's inhaled some of that portal fog I'm sure you've seen. There may be some reason for worry. But... In any case, he dreams, and he is growing more convinced that something about the dreams is true. He keeps dreaming he's killed little Peter. Some reassurance to the contrary would be welcome, if you could be bothered to reply this time. Come on, Tony, it's really important. And also... all right, to hell with this. Fury tells me you've been in contact with the fog too, at one point.
, even if the others are around me. Maybe it was a mistake to come here. Maybe I should have stayed with Clint and Sam and Buck, back where we're all bone-weary and gray, but I didn't have it in me to stay in that world without Tony, and this world is no different in that regard. I don't know what I expected. I just wanted out, I suppose. I keep finding good endings for myself, but the problem is, things never
“Then maybe I surf a little,” Steve concluded with a glint in his eye. Tony suppressed the impulse to swat him on the arm. It was as if another peculiar moment had passed and suddenly everything seemed back to normal somehow, but a
“God, Tony”, he croaked before another desperate set of motions, in and out, in and out; they were getting jerkier, more arrhythmic by the second. Tony tried to think of an inappropriate religious joke, but halfway there his thoughts got obliterated, and all he could do was hold on, and take it, balancing on the verge of the flood again, but this time he wanted to be
The blanket was riling Tony up, and Steve couldn't resist. And Tony couldn't exactly tear his eyes away. Steve adjusted it, neatly stepping around Tony and lifting the lid off the pot. "Hmmm, something smells nice."
Abruptly, Tony ceased his rapid limping. He went very still. "What exactly do you mean?" His voice had gone sharp. Steve could now make out his features a bit, way better than before. His vision seemed to be improving progressively, almost minute to minute now. With just a little rest and a snack (okay, half the vending machine stock), the serum seemed to be doing its work better and better.
Tony takes the ribbon from his pocket, then, and ties his hands. Steve glances at the piece of silk in amusement. "You don't have to be
Steve leafed through the file politely, then let it fall to his lap. He gave his commander a long, steady look and raised his eyebrows. "He's tech department. We need the tech people too." Out of all the objections he might have come up with, this one seemed most practical.
He was glaring at me, but he wasn't extremely serious about it. "Why are you evading my question? Why are you
Tony nodded. "I thought you might like to see him." And then he half-turned his head to look at Steve and smiled. Somehow, their faces seemed closer to each other than ever.
Tony snorted. "Hey, as long as you kids are happy together." He grabbed a bag of blueberries, stuffed some into his mouth, then tossed the beg to a surprised Steve. "Here, have some vitamins."
Tony was surprised at the hurt that stirred in his guts. He thought he was done with that. He thought he had immunized himself against hurt, as far as Steve was concerned. Still, it left an ugly burning in its wake.
Steve can't see, but he can imagine. Hands tied above his head, legs spread wide, sucking on the implement. Cock straining and leaking. His cheeks heat up even more.
, but Tony seemed to be largely avoiding him ever since they got out of danger. Steve knew loss like the back of his own hand. He could take it. But this time it took him by surprise, twisted his gut and wouldn't let go.
must have seen the deep, destructive heat roiling in the air between them. His own fury interlaced with passion. Steve's bewildered anger and hurt (
But he hasn't considered this, really, because Steve grabs him right back, and pulls him even closer, so that they are pressed tightly against each other, chest to chest, glaring into each other's eyes, and Tony's stomach is flipping and turning with wild excitement.
A certain lightheadedness had taken over. "Oh, I don't," I retorted. "And I didn't have Vegas in mind."
"You know," Tony said, "they'll have to bring us food eventually. Unless they want us to eat each other alive" As far as he knew, that could as well happen. The motivation of their captors, for now, was completely obscure.
They came together, as near enough to simultaneously as could possibly matter.  Steve held himself on top of Tony as their hearts raced, pressing kisses to his pulse point.  Tony waited for him to speak – to bring it up, to talk about the things they didn’t talk about.
“You’re not the only one who can plan ahead, baby,” Tony purred.  He rocked his hips against Steve’s hand, encouraging him to touch.
Tony was so inclined.  He waited all of two minutes – he couldn’t wait more – before bolting towards the bathroom and hoping the staff was either oblivious or tolerant.  Steve opened the bathroom door as he approached and closed it behind them, flicking the lock.
“And, you know… I want to see you in that suit.”  Lust colored Tony’s voice even as he checked his own reflection in the mirror.  His tailor had drooled, looking at Steve – well, who wouldn’t?  Creating formal wear for that body had to be the aspiration of any tailor.  “Pep wouldn’t let me peek, just told me I’d like it.”
Tony feathered his fingers through Steve’s hair and leaned forward to kiss him.  It was indeed tender – almost achingly so.  The soft press of lips unlocked something in Steve that he knew he could never share aloud.  “Everyone’s home safe,” Tony murmured between kisses.  “You’re a good captain, to care about your men.  We’re safer for it.”  His kisses extended to Steve’s cheeks and then over his closed eyes.  “When one of us gets hurt, it isn’t your fault.”
His orgasm wasn’t the fiery burst he was used to, but a slow and almost agonizing roll.  It went on longer than he expected, until Steve was limp and satiated.  Tony chuckled, leaning in to kiss him again.  “Good?” he asked, easing his finger out of Steve.
“Sir, yes, sir.”  Steve kissed him again, picking up the pace.  Tony shivered beneath him, his hands tightening on Steve’s trim hips.  “Would you prefer a different tune?”  He pressed closer to Tony’s ear and hummed again, this time a Black Sabbath song.
“Fuck, yes.”  Steve crowded against him, rubbing his cock along the inside of Tony’s thighs, teasing him.  He curled over Tony’s back and bit down on the back of his neck.  “Mine,” he growled, before nudging his cock into Tony’s hole.
“Fuck,” Steve groaned.  Tony would have grinned, if he hadn’t had his mouth full.  He hummed instead, which only made Steve tremble more.  Tony doubled down, swallowing around Steve’s length – and then braced himself and took the whole of him, down to the root.
Tony sucked in a breath.  “Jesus.”  He fumbled at his tie, loosening it a little.  “You’re killing me, Steve.”
Tony shook his head frantically.  “I can’t believe I – I promised myself I’d never – baby, I’m so sorry.”  Then his eyes widened.  “God, I can’t even say that, because isn’t that what they always say?”
Lube acquired, Steve crawled back onto the bed.  “Well, yeah.”  He slicked up his fingers and knelt between Tony’s knees.  “I mean, now that it’s not illegal at any rate.”  He pressed a nibbling kiss to the inside of Tony’s thigh.  “The whole getting arrested for it thing was kind of inconvenient.”
Steve smiled a little.  In a way, it was nice to see that declaring his love for Tony hadn’t changed everything between them.  “Yes, sir.”  He enjoyed the flush on Tony’s cheeks from the honorific as he shucked out of his clothes.
“Look, I appreciate everyone being supportive – or silent, if you aren’t supportive – but I’ve got one hell of a headache brewing, thanks to that anxiety attack… I’m going up to bed.”  Tony rose and held out his hand to Steve.  “Coming?”
Steve huffed out a breath when Tony’s hand grasped his cock.  His punches began to slow – reluctantly, to be sure, but it was difficult to focus on them with Tony’s hands on him like that.  “You should listen when a fella says no.”
“It needed to be done, and I’m the one that needed to do it,” Tony barreled on.  “I’m sorry I couldn’t explain, but—”
The communal living room was just outside the shared kitchen – but Steve always referred to it as a den.  It had several couches, a plethora of blankets and pillows, and was their usual gathering place.  Moving the conversation there took the pressure off… and it gave Tony a few more minutes to pull himself together.
“Other than ‘yes please’, I’ve got nothing.”  Steve shifted to the side so that he wasn’t caging Tony on the bed.  “What about you?”
“Traitor.”  Tony shot an amused look at one of the sensors in the elevator – just as he would have at a human eye.  Steve reflected again how very human Tony’s creations were and wondered how much of that was because their creator treated them as though they were human.  “I’ll settle for a kiss.”
Tony laughed, which turned into another tiny cough. Steve knew coughs as the back of his hand. This one was the mildest of the mild. But still.
Hammer opened his mouth to reply, then seemingly spotted something behind Tony and smiled in triumph. Curiosity got better of Tony; he had to glance back. At the door, captain Rogers was giving him a disapproving eye. Well, that was nothing new. The man was gorgeous, but, judging by his usual expression, probably permanently constipated.
"Got a lungful?" he heard himself say, and the dry throat and the absence of brains evidently made him sound pissed – again – because Steve gave him a  mildly taken aback look.
Steve got to his feet and in two strides he was at Tony's side, by the mantelpiece. "It's not," he confirmed. Now it was Tony's turn to start to speak and be cut off. "Want to hear something strange, though?" Steve went on. "I have
"Yeah... mine too," Tony said softly, toying with his silk handkerchief. Steve fixated on it, because it was an easy target. He hadn't seen a proper handkerchief like that one since he woke up from the ice; he'd thought they were an extinct species in this century.
, the surviving civilian cruiser. It seemed like the luckiest luck of all the lucks imaginable in this universe and any other. Then there was Fury, and Tony'd been overjoyed to see him. He'd been happy to see even Hammer at first, although he was quickly cured of that. Nevertheless, he couldn't believe his transgressions from twenty years ago were still going to haunt him.
"Well, there you go," I said. "It's a pretty big difference. The whole sequence of events. That's your divergence."
"Oh, please," Tony says. "You love me. Also, I spent a day hanging out with a three year old, what do you expect?" And then he realizes what he's said and freezes.
That, at least, matched Steve's impression to a 't'. Competent at what he did – competent and utterly impossible as a person. Steve found himself starting to chuckle at Darryl's remark; stopped. Chief wasn't joking. "Thank you, Darryl," he said politely instead.
"This is a party in our honor, Tony," he said, and he knew he sounded like a jerk, stuck-up and patronizing and aloof.
It was a little funny, almost, Tony thought, the way they could glare daggers at each other. There was probably no better glarers than the two of them to be found in Switzerland. Or was that glarists?
"In order to be aero-dynamical," the boy – the guy, Steve corrected himself – said. Quint was 19, and he didn't look much younger than that. It was probably just Steve, suddenly feeling too old.
it," she said without batting an eyelash. "You can feel it in the way he stumbles around in the morning, cursing at himself, saying
him. And to think he'd almost looked forward to this event. All ridiculous, now. Unimportant. What was important was the darkness in his belly, and normally he'd grin and tell a story and be a center of attention in order to drown the noise in his head with more noise. And he will, soon, he will. He just needed...
Tony made as if to crouch in front of him, but it became clear at once that wasn't going to work very well. In the end he sat down on the gurney next to Steve, pulling his arm gently onto his own lap.
with Steve, but he knew, he knew he couldn't have that. Still, if this was the only thing he was going to get, this one quick, furtive fuck in a coat room, fine. He could live with that. (He couldn't.) He was going to make the best of this. (He was going to fuck everything up.) If this was all he was going to get, he managed to think, half-coherently, he wasn't going to miss this chance, because he would regret it till the end of his life.
Tony: Yeah, but it feels unfair. If I'm being a dick to you, just tell me to go to hell. You gotta learn to do that. Don't just sit there, taking it,
"Tony Stark's dealing with the side engines," Steve said quickly. "Thor's off to check what's going on in the dorms, he'll come over here soon enough too."
"Bad day?" Steve asked sympathetically, and then it suddenly hit him: All the little clues pointed towards a fact that 'bad day' was a huge understatement. "Did you lose someone?" he amended very gently and wondered if he was overstepping.
Just that Tony had called him had been enough, no matter how awkward and strange the conversation. Tony actually asked him for a favor. Steve would have gone anywhere, any time, just to see him.
"Oh, I can do even worse than that," Cap went on, still amused, still smiley, and Tony found he liked the visage, and that was worrisome. "Go for a run in the mornings," Rogers continued. "Proper discipline and all that. Also – fresh air. Always good for you."
"Me too," I said, touching his elbow for a moment. I allowed myself that small liberty, and he didn't really seem to mind. "Why are you sorry, though?"
In those later years the drawings of him became more frequent again. The first few were done in a few sharp lines, fierce strokes of pencil almost damaging the paper here and there.
cold. Here he would have started losing life functions slowly until he went under, and even the serum couldn't help with drowning. If Tony hadn't got paranoid and went to check the alarm... But he did, he told himself firmly. He did find him, he did save him, and here was Steve, perfectly warm, fantastically alive, and if Tony didn't flirt he'd get choked with joy and then Steve would notice something. Flirting was a venting mechanism. Flirting was safe because flirting, after all, didn't have to mean anything. If anyone asked, it was all a joke.
Tony drifted awake, slowly. It was so warm and dark that for a moment he thought he was back home, but the surface under him was hard, and the shoulder-blades his face was pressed into were also hard and angular and he had his right arm thrown over someone big and muscular and hot like a small furnace. He froze. "Oh,
I wanted to say, because the last thing I wanted was to think about his death, now that this other Tony was sitting here with me. Still, I could see the urgency in his face – not eagerness, exactly, but something that told me he wouldn't be at peace until he found out. And for better or worse, there was no way I was saying
"You don't have to do it," Tony said quickly. "I mean, Morgan begged, and so I promised I'd ask you, because I can't say no to her, which is – I realize – not the best parenting choice, but right now I'm going with it. So, I had to ask, but listen, Cap, if you could just show up – for twenty minutes in the afternoon, I mean, you don't have to stay long, I don't want to keep you from your plans – and if you could have a chat with her... You don't have to dress up. She would be over the moon either way. And I'll..." He'd gotten so carried away that he was about to try and bribe Steve which was... ridiculous and offensive. Well. Not really bribe. To, say, Rhodey he would have said
To get his mind off things it shouldn't touch with a ten foot pole, Tony tried – yet again – to figure out why they were being kept here. The captors had apparently wanted nothing from him. They did strip the leftover parts of his suit, but no one had come in to even talk to him. They did take Steve's blood, so this whole shindig had to have something to do with the supersoldier serum. And they'd experimented on Steve, maybe. To see how he'd react to the drugs and whatever chemicals they pumped him full of. Tony shuddered.
"This," he says levelly, "is metallic and thick and uncomfortable. I'm going to put it up your ass. And I'm not going to be gentle. It's probably not going to feel nice.
Tony: Maybe I can sneak out next weekend? Hop over the fence, fly over, meet you at another rental house on the coast?
"I'm off to find the crapper," Bucky announced, deliberately crude, and disappeared into the crowd, not fooling anyone as to the purpose of his escape. Natasha rolled her eyes, but her gaze lingered on his retreating back for a moment.
"Let me introduce you to everyone," he said loudly when he and Bruce walked in. The room was rather packed, and the booze was what you could covertly ferment behind the engines, so bringing a doctor here wasn't such an insane idea, actually. They should have had one on retainer. "Bruce, these are... mainly Dales and Gales. On second thought, don't even bother memorizing the names. Everyone, this is Bruce Banner, whom you already know from your physicals." Tony put a proprietary hand on Bruce's shoulder.
"Say my name again," Tony said; inconsequentially. Was he desperately changing the subject  or was this something else entirely?
Steve aimed for earnestness and wished he could be fearless. "I need to talk to you about what happened in..." He stopped, forced himself to say the words, because there was no point in avoiding them now. "About the kiss."
handsome," the woman behind them in line agrees, to make the matters even worse. "Especially the tall one."
Tony inspected Steve's collar. It was similar to the one on the suit he's designed, albeit a little lower. Well, it may have made the world of difference. He resisted the urge to huff. Instead, he asked, "They
After this brief introduction, he settled into a chair in the back and let himself be absorbed by the already familiar material. But what drew his attention more and more was the animation on Stark's face, the glint in his eyes as he flirted with the principles of physics, the easy grins as he courted the engines he described. It was obvious he loved the subject.
Tony: I can hardly send an android to do it, eh? And Rhodey is still perceived more as a member of the military than anything else. And those are the options we got at the moment.
"That would be a pretty good idea, yes," Steve said and tried not to let himself be amused. "At least for a sec."
Tony slung his small bag over his shoulder. He was wondering if he was supposed to do the rounds, say good bye to everyone or if a general wave to the dormitory at large would be enough. Lang was, of course, diligently shaking hands with all the Daves and Gales and Dales. Tony wondered if he himself might sneak out while the attention was on the other man. Oh, he could be hyper-social with the best of them. Still, he'd give a lot only to skip talking to Justin Fucking Hammer. The man was insufferable.
When the door to the hotel room finally opens, Steve can hear his own sharp intake of breath. On reflex, he tries to sit up, feels the tug of the handcuffs on his wrists, and it's delicious. He hates to admit it to himself, but that's how it is, and he's blushing, he knows he's blushing and it makes him blush even more.
Steve nodded gratefully as he tucked himself in, and Tony proceeded to drag him towards the kitchen and the fridge. Tony had also had an ice-bucket with champagne ready, back in his bedroom, but the sparkly, and lounging around in silk sheets, and slow languid fucking he had had in mind will apparently have to wait. Well, it's not as if either of them was going anywhere for the time being, so it was just as well. Now that they both knew they wanted this, they had all the time in the world.
"Carol, Natasha," Tony yelled. "How do you feel about going with them, seeing about their civil liberties being protected and stuff?"
"Attraction's fine," he muttered, a bit gruffly. And then: "You don't like him much, do you, Nat?" He had not idea why this realization hurt a little. No, really, he had to get a grip. His lips twisted into a wry smile. "I'm not sure I like him much either, as such. You know."
, Tony had spit out then, vicious, bitter, and all of 13 at the time. He got a slap across the mouth for his troubles – not hard, but it was the act that counted, not the muscle behind it. He could see Howard believed him, because he stopped asking. He just ranted. And what Tony had told him hadn't even been the truth. He wasn't sure what the truth had been.)
"So, you live in a motel, eh?" Tony said, with an empty grin. "Lurid." It fell flat, and he hated himself intensely for saying anything.
Rhodey's voice was dry when he asked them if they wanted to move along or if they were dead set on waiting for the paparazzi to show up. They got moving. It was a thing to do.
And then Steve seemed to find the words that fit his expression. “So, what’s an orange square mean, in Europe?”
, in her opinion. But she suspected that protecting Tony was still the main motive for the strict observance of the battle names rule.
Steve was breathing unevenly now. Tony ran his fingertips up Steve's arm, to his shoulder, snagging them for a second in the hem of Steve's short sleeve. Then continued upwards, to graze the skin of his neck with his short clipped nails, and higher still. He touched his fingertip to the corner of Steve's mouth and run it lightly along his lower lip. Steve shivered.
Before they can turn around and run, she's already waving at them excitedly. There is a definite recognition in her eyes. And, instead of running away like a normal person, Steve manages to blush and walks over to say hi. Because that's the polite thing to do. Of
"Okay," Steve whispers again, as if it's the only word he remembers, and then, finding some more: "Yeah. Do it. Okay."
create a separate timeline, I suppose, but it wouldn't be significantly different from ours. It would change nothing, technically. So why not?
Tony swallowed. Steve was wearing down his arguments, but he didn't have to bother. Just looking into his eyes would have been enough. And Tony couldn't look away.
"I'm not exactly emotionally available," Tony muttered unhappily, hating every word of the stupid phrase.
Tony: Yeah, I was hoping to see you without six other people present, but whatever floats your boat.
Steve furrowed his brow. "I imagined you'd either figure it out for yourself or... or you wouldn't believe me. The way things are now."
Hope's arrival and the channel dying took place roughly at the same time. Tony suppressed the tentacles of panic reaching up from his stomach. The last words he heard from Steve were
"...Smuggle shit in order to stay afloat, as long as shit is not too morally questionable, yes," Tony replied without a slightest pause, a smirk turning into a grin.
"Tony... don't," Steve said very softly. His own voice seemed to be caressing Tony and belying Steve's own words. "Please." It was
The slope was mild and the going slow, but the speed wasn’t the point. The smile spreading over Steve’s face took its sweet time too, but that didn’t make it any less worth the effort. Tony let himself revel in it, bask in it.
"You used to be some kind of psychologist, right?" Bucky asked Sam somewhat later, when they found him by the huge ornate windows that made Steve's head hurt a little.
Hangover hit Tony like a crowbar in the head before he even opened his eyes in the morning. It took him a second to remember he wasn't at home, the feeling was so familiar. He clawed his way to consciousness – and out of bed; splashing his face with icy water helped somewhat. Still, a gimlet – tool, not cocktail – kept boring holes in his stomach as the last night slowly came back to him.
Steve saw Chief Petty Officer close his eyes for a second, as if bracing himself; he heard a soft t exhalation. "Hey, Thor." With even less enthusiasm, that.
Which set off Tony’s alarms again, all at the same time, and he knew it was stupid, but he didn’t know what to do about it. Because a whole day here, in this tiny space, cooped up with Steve – well, it would make talking unavoidable, and Tony couldn’t, his gut hurt at the thought and he
Tony new what he meant, of course. But sometimes it was easier just to gloss over things, hope they go away on their own. “Meh,” he said. “Too boy-next-door. Ish. You need something with more character.”
, look it up.” But he was too weak to do anything about any of that, even if he’d thought it was a good idea at the moment, and it probably wasn’t. ”On second thought, no;  don’t ever watch it. I don’t want to hear how much you hate it.” He took a deep breath. Listened to Steve’s heartbeat for a moment or two. “Cap?”
"I hate seeing this place reduced to ashes," I said, looking away. Toyed with the mug, watching a spear of late afternoon sunlight touch the purple target symbol on it. "How's Clint, by the way?"
In  the matter of half a second, he ran through a score of possible answers. Half of them he thought Captain Rogers would approve of; something in him barred him from voicing any one of those, because if he did, he felt, he'd be stepping into something he didn't know how to handle. He had to take a step back, regroup, get his shields back up. All he wanted to say sounded kind of corny, anyway. "I have to fly," he managed in the end. "Or else I'll go crazy in here." Well, it was
He wasn't sure for how long they lay like that, intertwined on the narrow sofa. Steve's body was cold, but his breath on Tony's face was warm, and the fire was slowly turning the room into a sauna, and it had to be okay, Steve had to be okay, because Tony flat out refused to live in a world in which that wouldn't be the case.
It was his turn to get up on an elbow, look down into Steve’s closed-up face. Until recently, he never knew how much he’d missed that face, how painful the gush of sweetness could be when he just glanced at it. That’s why he’d never dared look too much, never too long. He’d  been stupid, stupid, stupid...
This little stretch of desert was what he was determined to protect, and he was going to die doing it; Tony could see it in his mind's eye very clearly. It sent a stab of hot terror through him on a regular basis. He had tried, on occasion, to explain to people that he could see what was going to happen – not through any kind of clairvoyance, obviously, but due to the laws of probability. And okay, all right, it possibly did sound like drunk ramblings of a madman. (
Tony: I was being sarcastic. And this was probably the nicest trolling of my sarcasm that was ever done to me.
Slowly, thoughtfully, Tony nodded his head; once, twice. It seemed he had reached some kind of conclusion.
Steve is sitting on the bridge that leads to the town. He's climbed over the wooden railing, and now he's sitting on the stone blocks at the very edge of the bridge, staring into the waters below.
Tony just rests the side of his head against Steve's and sighs. "I know," he says. "But shut up for now. Watch the game. It's over. We're going home."
Coordinates? Oh yes, Happy would actually try and follow him over here – which was his job and all, given, but Tony wasn't a teenager trying to sneak away from his bodyguard. He was a grown ass adult, who responsibly, after a lot of thought, decided to sneak away from his bodyguard.
Tony presses the cold, metal pommel onto his hot nipple. The contrast itself is too sharp for it to be soothing at first; it's as if the sensation jolts straight to Steve's cock. Still, he doesn't come, he can't, he needs more. He bites his lip in frustration.
She stopped at the door, raised her eyebrow quizzically. "Yes, Steve?" she said sweetly, and he suspected again she was making fun of him. Which was... okay in his book, he didn't mind, really.
"Jesus Tony," I whispered, only partly aware words were slipping out at all, "if I could have just one kiss, just one, just to see what it's like..."
"I got some soup for you too," Tony called to Steve over his shoulder as he went back into the kitchen. The dog seemed to be doing okay, for now. It was time to get some food into Steve as well. He seemed to be recovering wonderfully, now that he had something to focus on, or perhaps it was just that enough time had passed. The serum was truly a marvel, but it needed some fuel for all the hard work it was doing. To see Steve now, it would be almost impossible to tell there was something wrong with him. Still, Tony wasn't about to forget the gray hue of his skin and the lost look in his eyes. His heart clenched into a tiny, throbbing ball in his chest.
Without a second of hesitation, Tony threw off his clothes, leaving just the boxers on, and crawled under the blankets with Steve. He fit snugly into the space between him and the sofa cushions. Steve's skin was unnaturally cold, like no human skin should ever be; but then Steve turned around to the side and wrapped himself around Tony. Was it just instinct, going for a warm body? Or was he actually aware of what was going on? There was no way to know that. Tony threw an arm over him, trying to pull him closer, willing his warmth to enfold Steve like a cocoon.
The airport around them is bustling with activity, and the two of them are just two dudes in generic clothing. Steve is wearing a beanie and a pair of ridiculously hipstery glasses that – Tony has to admit – are a good match for his new beard. He looks like no one in particular, but better built.
"We have a safe house relatively near here," Rhodey answered. "We get there, we have something to eat, we regroup, we all talk about what's to be done next." Steve couldn't discern his expression, but his voice sounded straightforward and a little dry. Steve thought he nodded at him. "All right with that, Cap?"
ceiling, which, consequently, must mean there was something very wrong with the gravitation strips. They must have tampered with them, the idiots, trying to organize the next prank.
The time stone was the last one, and I'd just returned it. It was supposed to be an easy mission, in and out. But now I lingered, reluctant to leave. I had no idea why. Maybe I wanted someone to guess what I was about to do and say something like oh-no-you-can't-do-that-it's-insane. Just, stop me before I make another mess. Then again, that would have probably just made me more determined to do what I meant to. I took all the stupid with me when I started on this journey, after all.
The only thing was, Tony still was who he was. You couldn't have your neighboring king's outlawed son lead your armies, at least not openly. The facade was flimsy enough, but for all the official purposes, Tony still had to be Iron Man in the field. Otherwise, Stark of Northumbria would, as honor demanded, have to claim insult. These things tended to start wars. And it simply wasn't worth going to war for. They had enough bloodshed as it was. Hence the battle names. Hence the whole Black Widow and Hawkeye business too. In Steve's service, you didn't have to have origins, you didn't have to have a family name or blood of that certain shade of aristocratic red. You could let your visor down, and pick a code name, and be who you are. Which was... it was
Tony: I’ll forgive you. Maybe I already have. In a way I have. In part. When you’re being so earnest, how could I not? And probably fully, in time. I don't know how to explain it.
At first it seems to him that time has stopped. Then it becomes clear it's just Tony that's frozen in place, his fingers halfway inside Steve. He's not moving. Steve blinks at him. And then the faceplate slides up, the helmet disappears into the armor with a soft
Steve just nodded curtly, an acknowledgment a conversation was definitely in order; that was enough for Tony. With a goal in mind, it was suddenly easier. He forced a grin, forced a surprised laugh, forced a light, silly voice. "Hey!" Friendly affront, that was the trick. He should have been an actor, really. "No tickling, Steve! Come on, buddy, I need to show you something."
and Tony thought his knees would just give way there and then. Was buckling of knees audible? Steve could probably hear that too.
"Oh, yeah," Tony said quickly. "Everything's great. Fab. Stellar – pardon the pun." He was babbling, he knew he was, just like he knew he was gripping the control stick too tightly. Suddenly, he was painfully aware the lights from the control panel illuminated his face pretty well, casting a pale blue glow over his twisted lips and arched eyebrows and the overall spasm that his features had turned into. He couldn't be sure if Rogers could see him from his angle, but Tony's first impulse was to turn around, turn away from the lights. As he did so, the sight of Steve – right there, so close – hit him like a hammer. The breadth of his shoulders startled him. For a second all he was able to see were those shoulders, stretching away, and he wondered how come he'd never really noticed how broad they were – he'd
Tony also experimented with a smile, but then he seemed to register Steve's actual words. "What?" he said in mild outrage. "You don't have to lie down if you don't want to, but I'm not letting you
Tony: Do you have any idea how big this corporation is? How many important projects there are? How many fucking employees? How many workplace accidents? How many health benefit plans? Do you have any idea what you are talking about like at all?
"You're kidding." The words burst out before Tony could think them through. "That's not a punishment. That's a... a... reward."
he thought. So, he was friends with his pilots, was he? That wasn't something Tony had expected, judging from appearances.
Steve was immediately sorry he'd bothered him. He should have sent Natasha. Or Thor. He shouldn't have left Thor waiting in the corridor. Maybe some congenial intimidation would work here. "This is off the record, between you and me," Steve added. "Just your professional opinion."
be possible. Even if you... Well, I don't know if you still fight or not, I don't know anything, really. But... for your art, if nothing else..."
When they finally get there, it's past midnight, and, impossibly, the woman behind the reception desk is the
he had admit to himself. Despite his claims of tardiness, Stark always showed up early for the classes he taught. Steve had spotted him before. He never brought any notes with him, and Steve wondered if he were preparing for the lecture in some way or what. Maybe it was curiosity. Or maybe he just wanted to see Tony alone for a second. Which was... unacceptable.
He figured out at once what I meant. He arched an eyebrow, gave me a contemplative look. "We didn't, in your timeline?"
It's stupid to have your heart beat like that in your chest, isn't it? He drummed his fingers against his suited thigh and tried for casualness. He failed even before he began, because Steve was so blue eyed, and somehow the mouse-gray top flattered his complexion even though it would have made anyone else look drab, and because, when he reached Tony, Steve stood for a moment, obviously at a loss for what to say. That was just too much. His obvious chagrin was too precious. Tony had a ridiculous urge to touch his fingertips to Steve's cheek. Just that.
Tony: Oh, I have a little of the temperament. Sans the dog-murdering part, obviously. Shit, I forgot about that completely. Thanks for reminding me though, now I can't stop thinking about it. I was 8 when I read it. All those years of unhealthy suppression, gone to waste.
Those words, coming from Steve, warmed him like sunlight. And they shouldn't; if they came from someone else, they wouldn't have. They'd have rang empty and Tony wouldn't have given a fuck about them, but from
you," he said dryly, but his eyes were full of laughter. "That early, huh? It must have been one hell of a precognition."
Tony: Christ, Cap. Look, I know it's important that we talk about this too, I know we should have this discussion sooner rather than later.
So, that had been the big plan. Capture Tony to get their hands on Steve, now that there were no Avengers to call for help, now that they were all scattered to the four winds. Somehow, their captors had figured Steve would come for Tony, even though Tony wouldn't have counted on it, himself. But, of course Steve would. Because, of all the stupid, noble things he could do, this one was the stupidest.
That the rescue had arrived in time was amazing. Still, Steve and Tony were used to fighting, they'd been through bad scraps before, and even hurt and incapacitated, the two of them knew what they were doing and knew how to do it together. They'd fought well, and now it was over. That they were both still in a more or less-decent condition was a miracle.
Again, the shrugging. Tony was getting mildly irritated, although Steve couldn't have known all these things, of course. It was highly doubtful his captors would have graciously shared the info with him.
"There's a ton of raw and semi-cooked ingredients. I'd planned, ah... Actually, I couldn't really decide what to cook for Morgan, so I decided to cook
Steve interrupted. “Yeah, the stim still worries me, though. The way I understand it, it can sometimes leave you suddenly sapped of energy, and...
"That was... not awesome," Tony said a bit later and reached for the drink Reed had poured him. His hand was shaking as badly as his voice. "I mean, it's absolutely
Steve made a noncommittal noise through his nose. "Why wouldn't I be okay?" To his own ears he sounded like he was only now learning human speech, and he also sounded very much not-okay. The early post-coital bliss had faded away, and now he was acutely aware that he'd experienced something wonderful, and also that he was going to lose it forever, come morning.
Tony knew a thing or two about art. As it went, Steve's wasn't exactly amazing. He had a decent eye and a nimble hand; and, overall, an underdeveloped talent. It felt unseasoned. He wasn't really
"Steve," Tony says, his voice so week already. Is it trembling with pain or... – yes, with urgency, too. Steve looks into his eyes, trying not to think that this might be the last time, because – it's inconceivable. Steve refuses that possibility completely. At the very least, Steve will stay here forever, holding Tony in his arms, and time will run no longer.
"Steve?" she asks again, but this time it's not Steve-is-that-really-you, it's rather Steve-what's-wrong, so I force myself to let go of her and I try to smile. Her face is a shock, not because she looks older, although she does, but because I didn't think I'd ever get to see it again. Her high cheekbones are even more prominent, but the eyes look softer around the edges. She is lovely. Years sit well with her. Late fifties or early sixties, I'd say. She's still Natasha, and my eyes are bleary with tears.
Tony definitely didn't feel like sleeping. He desperately needed to do something with his nervous energy. Had he had a horizontal bar, he might have tried to do some honest-to-god chin-ups, pulled a regular Sarah-Connor-in-the-asylum. Wasn't that a prison tradition of sorts? "Wish I knew how to do push-ups with this leg," he grumbled softly.
Steve didn't have much in the vein of patience either. He hadn't slept in almost 20 hours, which was against the regulations. He was normally glad to skirt this particular rule when necessary, but now it was taking its toll. That's why his thoughts were so muddled.
They all needed rest, for sure; but as they had found out long ago, it was always better to unwind an hour or two after the battle, calm the nerves first, let the muscles slowly slip into languidness. They were safely back in their camp now, dry and fed and warm in the bosom of their army. And, in Steve's case, forced into some bandages for good measure. They were going about their usual duties – in order to confirm to themselves everything was back to normal, if nothing else; everyone was alive, Steve was back, they could breathe now.
Light-bulbs were erratically strewn along the ceiling. Mostly they were burned out. Still, enough of them gave out weak, yellowish light. Tony was suddenly overtaken by the feeling that he'd never appreciated anything in his life as much as he appreciated those light-bulbs right at that moment.
, but the words clog in his throat. Steve saves the day, because otherwise it would seem as if Tony Stark didn't know what to say. "So, I'm the breakable one and
Tony: You should at least try them. You don't even know how they work. Give my imaginary meds a chance, come on.
It came out of nowhere while Tony was rattling around the compound. A text. After almost three months of no contact whatsoever.
The enveloping warmth under the blankets was bliss. Another human body beside him was a marvel made of snugness and breathing and minuscule stirring. Tony realized he had low-key given up hope he'd ever feel that again. And now the hope for escape, for life, for everything, was back, and it hurt like blood returning to a limb that had fallen asleep. Ugly thing, hope.
all of it, but it was as if he could barely access his own feelings). "You were sitting there, drawing pictures of you and Tony Stark, thinking about how much you missed him?"
"No, really, where's Darryl? He's not in his office, I looked," the big guy commented, leaning against the makeshift bar. Everyone knew Thor around here, and absolutely no one was surprised to see him. "Gimme a drink," the blond pilot demanded and the requested abomination was dutifully poured as a few voices of the Gale-Dale think-tank explained that Chief was most probably in the storage area, working doubles in his free time.
, but it sounded like such a lie he couldn't get it past his lips. For the first time in forever he fervently wished he still had the arc reactor, just to
. Steve? How long ago was it for you, exactly?" He hadn't asked me that and I hadn't thought to mention it, or maybe I failed to mention it on purpose, trying to avoid just this.
, he'd asked the first time this night time conversation took place, and every time after that he enquired:
The metal under my fingers is familiar and comforting, but I'd say the thing itself is a tad heavier than it used to be.
Because, on the inside he was empty, and the emptiness echoed with longing, echoed with a frustrated, unbearable
he thought. It wasn't that bad. It was actually... very much not bad. It was the very opposite of bad. If all Tony wanted from Steve was a good fuck, he'd be calling bullshit right about now, at least in the privacy of his own head. He wasn't. If he needed any further proof of his own feelings, this was it.
arrogant and self-absorbed. So were other people. He was not the only one. The fact that those particular qualities set Steve's teeth on edge was his own problem.
It wasn't even that Steve was naked. Tony had been with naked people plenty in his life, in non-sexual or only semi-sexual situations, in assorted hot tubs at parties etc. It was more about the fact that this was
Steve is standing still, like a figure chiseled in stone. Water is coursing down his face. Tony could believe he could go on standing like that for generations, enduring weather. Maybe he's really turned to stone? "So... where does that leave us?" Steve asks. He's not moving one inch closer to Tony.
And then there was that one time, and there were the two of them, and there was Thor; alcohol and certain Norse deities weren't bad, as social glue goes... The problem was, after that, in absence of either component, it was too easy to just backslide. And – as he was seriously beginning to think now – maybe it wasn't backsliding at all. Maybe it all didn't mean what Tony hoped it meant in the first place.
, thinking back – he had made jokes, initiated touches. Even when Tony had decided to not pursue it any longer, it was
"A compensation," Steve says flatly, and it's not even a question. The question is, however,  implied.
"So, what do you do now?" Tony asked Fury, never moving his knee away from Steve's under the table, and for a millionth time Steve wondered if this was all a joke to Tony, a way to push Steve's buttons. He... hoped not.
Tony: And I'm perfectly aware you wouldn't be talking to me of all people. After everything. If you thought you had any other options.
The man across the table studied him. Tony found himself wondering how old he was. In his thirties, judging by the appearance, maybe even late twenties. At least 5 or 6 years Tony's junior, probably more. Look at him, believing all this crap.
"Yeah," I say. I want to turn and look at her, but then she's flinging herself into my arms. She feels bonier, but I'd know that hug anywhere.
Steve just inclined his head and regarded him curiously for a moment. "We'll see about that, won't we," he said in the end. Tony could have kissed him at that moment, for the lack of empty platitudes and stupid words of encouragement. Or, he reflected, he could just kiss him for no reason at all. "But today was fine," Steve went on. "You kept a cool head. Did what needed doing. That was enough."
"Somewhere not here," he said. "I need you tell me how you managed to slip from one timeline to another. Also, do you have more particles on you or do I need to call Scott Lang?"
And now it was apparent everything Steve thought – believed, hoped – Tony maybe wanted – well, it had all gone to shit. He'd been wrong. He let his hopes get the better of him. He let himself expect the unobtainable, somehow, for some reason, and he screwed up. Now all he needed to do was rewind, go back, go back to that place where he didn't expect anything, didn't hope for anything at all, and he could go on living like before, right, if only...
"Steve, that wasn't..." Tony began, for all the world as if he was defending himself. Then he got a grip, stopped. Frowned for a moment, as if he was considering something nebulous. And then, abruptly, a new understanding flooded his face. "You complete
. He felt he could chat to Peter about nothing in particular for ages and never tire of it. Also it was nice, having another chatterbox there, so that he didn't have to fill all the silences himself. It was
And then the finger inside him twists slightly, pressing inwards, as if Tony is screwing it into him. It's an all new sensation then, all new places being touched, stretched. Steve can't help it, he gasp sharply. And he is sure the whole finger must be inside now, but when he looks, he sees it's only in to the second knuckle, which seems impossible, at this moment, seems impossible that something that feels so unwieldy and unyielding inside him could go any further in. Tony gives him a short look, maybe checking on him, so Steve nods, just in case. And then it's pressure again, one quick slide, one burst of discomfort, and it's in.
? That used to be my favorite when I was a kid." The cover looked like it had survived the invasion of Normandy in someone's backpack. That was exactly why Steve had picked this one – the tattiest, most worn one – off the shelf in Tony's old room. A weird sounding, very thick novel about adventures of a clairvoyant rabbit of all things. It didn't even read like a children's book. Steve cast a furtive glance at Tony over it and hummed noncommittally.
," she said dryly. "I've never seen anything like it in my life. Strip, mister. Stop wasting my time. If you're all right, don't keep me from the people who aren't" Then, to herself, she muttered something that sounded suspiciously like: "Fucking pilots."
She is distracted enough or drunk enough to be reckless, and she gets a snowball straight into he mouth for it. Tony thinks it serves her right, having everything in mind, but decides to have his vengeance on Rocket several times over for it. Because, familial loyalty.
" Too sharp, and probably rude. "I have Morgan for Christmas Eve," he elaborated in order to soften his words. "She's spending it with me, I mean. I'm spending it with her." If he didn't stop talking right now, he'd probably say
Steve had no idea how to address it, though, except to try again what he'd been trying so far. Distance himself. Be rational. Not let the... sensual part of him, so to speak, take control. Because Stark was
was no joke. It was stupid and reckless – and really brave too – but no joke. And now he wanted Steve to stay. Maybe he wanted to spend more time with him while he still could? Maybe this was his way of saying goodbye?
While Nebula and Rocket are getting the power stone, Steve and Tony go to New York with Scott and Bruce. It's a big mess, really, but in the end it all works out.
Tony hadn't come here again since the day they died – not until now. In this place, it hadn't been 25 years.
As in many other things, we were far too similar for our own good. I put my arms around him and pulled him onto my chest. He tucked his head under my chin. That was all I could offer: a silent comfort.
Steve had been sluggish, and then unfocused, but right now there was some kind of liveliness in him that made him want to laugh aloud. He suspected it had something to do with the absence of resentment or bitterness in Tony's eyes, the lack of standoffishness in his manner. It was like... well, like before, during that short honeymoon period of their friendship, after which everything had started souring, first with Ultron and then downhill from there. They had never really come back from that. Steve had been sure they weren't going to, but this?
were safe. Human mind was a piece of damnation. It tricked itself into believing in an illusion of safety in order not to go completely insane at the inconceivable expanse of the universe all around.
