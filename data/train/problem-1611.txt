His answer is an embarrassed cough.
He has to keep calm, not to give too much away, try not to argue. Bid his time. If there's a slightest chance... Maybe Sherlock is somewhere here too?
“John.” There are warm hands are on John’s shoulders, Sherlock’s lips touching his ear. When did he rise from the armchair? John hadn't heard. “Don’t forget: I’m a genius and you are rather good at everything else. If anyone can do it, it's us.”
“A dream where I...” Sherlock breaks off, waves his hand as if to wave the matter off, then sighs and rubs his neck. “I'm a child there. Maybe ten or twelve years old. In real life I was actually bigger and taller than my peers, but there I'm small and weak. That's especially annoying, because I remember that it's wrong and remember myself as adult. Anyway, in the dream I'm kidnapped and taken somewhere in India. I'm sitting at the feet of some rajah and...” Sherlock smirks, but it's not a happy smirk; John imagines he can see something childish and even hysterical in that smirk.
“Free us both.” Sherlock nods. “And I hope not only us. But to achieve all that we'll have to do a lot. Are you with me on this?”
Pointless endeavour. Highly irrational, fruitless and potentially harmful. A lapse in judgement of simply colossal proportions considering his experience and intellect. Genius needs an audience, but he already has one that's a lot more appreciative. Pound is not a parterre, not even a silly gallery with its open cavity. He's no one. He's less than no one. A nasty insect. An insect can sting, true – but what's the point in squelching under your boot each and every poisonous pest in a tropical forest?
If the cabbie wasn't too outraged, John got to witness a fascinating spectacle: totally focussed, Sherlock sits up straight, his head turned primly ahead, his thick brows furrowed. Sooner or later he starts smiling triumphantly (God, how John misses that smile right now!) and John already knows what's going to happen next – “Come on, John! Battersea South? I was hoping it would be something challenging this time!”
And they are back to giggling. This time until truly breathless.
Sherlock squeezes her hands, feeling as if something hard and cold is melting inside him. Irrational relief. Psychological reaction to realisation of being trusted.
“Get up,” he says, having quickly assessed the situation.
“No.” John shakes his head.
A simple recipe: pasta, fresh tomatoes, white beans... Strangely enough there are (relatively) fresh  tomatoes in the fridge. Two tomatoes, to be exact. But they're out of beans, so John decides to pop in to Mrs Hudson's for something canned – and finds the old lady in quite an odd mood.
Sherlock's tone perfectly conveys what he thinks of the relevance of one's reputation, the lack of it and all the rest of the tedious mundane rigmarole. The situation was so familiar that John wants to weep of joy. Even so he has the presence of mind to intone, “First, you'll have shower. And I'll have a shower and then you'll tell me everything.”
Then suddenly everything stops. That continuous noise of thousands of hateful thoughts, of thousands of condescending voices whispering to him how to humiliate, to betray, to destroy even more effectively – all of it stops.
“Don't talk like that, Mr Holmes!” Greg shakes his head. “He's your brother, family. I'm sure even he understands that.”
“Sherlock,” John’s tongue continues without his consent, “told me about her. Told me she's my type... Very lonely. And the second time... I thought – should I buy her flowers or not?.. I didn't. Ridiculous – me, giving her flowers.”
“You remember that puzzle you asked me to work on?” Sherlock asks in an even tone. “About a month ago?”
“What are you...” John's voice above him sounds aghast and a bit frightened.
Sherlock inhales through his nose and grits his teeth. Frowns: the loose tooth pierces his jaw with blinding pain. The timing's bloody inconvenient. Fine. Let's deal with that tooth. Body is transport, but even transport needs to be seen to occasionally. He won't go to a municipal dentist, though. Not even for John.
“Sh-Sherlock,” John gasps, clasping Sherlock's hair.
“Important,” is all Sherlock says.
“In a manner of speaking,” Sherlock replies in an absolutely normal voice and starts getting out of the bed.
“Don't even think about it,” Sherlock mutters quietly, so as not to be heard, but the cold, assertive tone makes John instantly feel better. “It has to be Golden Ram. Try to stay for forty minutes at least. Understand?”
“But you were followed! You even had those dreams, you said...“
'Stop it!' John tries to tell himself. 'It's Sherlock. You know Sherlock – he's doing this on purpose, right? Just look at him – is he helpless? His shoulders are wider than yours, his muscles are all there even if he has lost some weight, and he fights better than you, even. When by the rules – definitely better – or with a sword or something. He was right, Watson – you are a hypocrite. You're thinking of him as a slave, you are making him helpless in your thoughts, destroying his willpower. Just put the collar on  - that's what he wants.'
“So it worked?” John asks without raising his head. “Mycroft is safe and we are above suspicion?”
“What?” At first John doesn’t even get what Sherlock is talking about. “Don’t be an idiot. You haven’t slept in fuck knows how long and I had a shut-eye on the train. I’ll keep watch - in this same bloody chair.”
“I'm talking about the cot!”
Mycroft, naturally, is lying still, and, naturally, doesn't look anything like himself. He hasn't woken up in the six months that have passedsince the attack; it had been stupid to think otherwise. He's much thinner: intravenous nutrition works wonders, no diet can compete with that.
“I was brought out of coma this morning. They started to last night already, while rescuing me from the clinic. I was transported to Switzerland in a roundabout way which right now is of no importance. I am here first to recuperate, second to gather information, and third to strategize. As you can see, I am dealing with it all simultaneously and as efficiently and quickly as the circumstances allow. You, Detective Inspector, are a part of the second and the third stage of my agenda.”
John shakes his head. He took all they had at home, but didn't count what was left after paying the fine. He doesn't even know how much he paid.
“Payment will not be necessary.” Sherlock gestures the concern away. “But don’t expect quick results. In a week maybe. When I don’t have any other pressing matters.”
“And you doubted me,” Rohan notes, walking in from the hallway.
“John, you're back.” Sherlock turns to him. “That's good. I need your help.”
The last evening at Baker Street feels stifled and tense. Most of the stuff (most of them Sherlock's) is already packed and at the storage. Mrs Hudson offered to hold on to their things for them, but Sherlock insisted – everything must look as if John's severed all ties with her.
“You'll be useless in this state anyway. Better call in sick. Or I can. You've got a good reputation there; they won't think any worse of you, if that's what you are worried about.”
She's rather tall, nice-looking, but with a double chin – in short: not a pleasure slave. The tattooed cheek doesn't add to her attractiveness either. It is obvious that she's been waiting for a while and that the shapeless coat, warm gloves and even the scarf tied on top of the collar (against The Dress Code Regulation) don’t seem to be helping any more.
“Call me Dr Watson,” John finds the strength to utter in an ordinary tone, squinting and wetting his lips. “Or Captain.”
The woman shakes her head.
On the one hand, it is not difficult to remember those few happy moments in his childhood that he associates with Christmas (Mycroft being back from school, sometimes with friends, the new books he brought along, stories, and the opportunities for playing tricks that only needed an accomplice). On the other hand, everything that happened afterwards in no way invites sentimental reminiscence.
“Holmes.” He jerks his head - 'no'. “Irrelevant. So who got lucky with their master and why don't you want to talk about it? Come on, I hope it's at least mildly entertaining.”
Holmes nods with a notable indifference.
“Well, a week ago I would have asked for your phone number and dinner, but now that the circumstances have changed, I'm forced to say nothing.” John smiles, hoping it's coming out charming. He hasn't had much practice lately.
They spar right there in the living room for about ten minutes - until they have to stop the lunacy and it’s all John's fault – he should have warned Sherlock that tickling him in the ribs sends him into fits of uncontrollable laughter, but there's nothing to be done about that now.
“See? Isn't that nice?” the woman asks Sherlock and then turns to John in a confidential tone, “He was so restless during the night, couldn't sit still, banged on the walls. Was afraid you'd punish him, I think. The doctor said he's been knocked around a bit, he might not be completely himself yet. Don't be too harsh with him, all right?”
“'Oh my God, poor Sherlock, he so fragile, I'm not going to nag at him to put his papers away until his ears bleed, nor tell him to do the dishes, lest he be reminded of being a slave one more time! I'd better mollycoddle him like a sick child; let him get used to following my orders gently and then he'll be so much easier to control. Thank God, I have a chance at managing him now!'”
In the end John has to deal with the shirt himself, but there are no broken ribs, and nothing more serious than some bruises, a couple of bumps and a skinned knee. No concussion either, thankfully.
“Through and through!” Sherlock pulls at the collar on his neck, experiencing the pain with an inexplicable satisfaction.
“Stop,” Sherlock repeats his growl. “I'm sick and tired of your damn hypocrisy and your condescension!”
“Let me see your face,” John suggests.
“You can't act and the emotional authenticity-”
“John, I'm always glad to have you accompany me, but in this case it really isn't necessary.”
“Please come in, Detective Inspector.”
“You thought what?”
Sherlock doesn't hear John's answer.
Sherlock regards him closely. Fear. Tension. Uncertainty. Awkwardness. But the most important – fear. Almost terror, though well concealed. The only other time Sherlock had seen John like this was at the pool, in those short seconds they both thought that Sherlock would have to shoot the vest full of explosives.
“Are you a visitor, sir?” she asks.
“But you do own me,” Sherlock corrects him calmly, even though his heart is beating violently. At this angle, in the twilight, John's face is strange, unfamiliar. “And you do want to. But it is normal, John, because I, too, own you.”
“I think that we understand family differently, Detective Inspector.” Holmes's tone is dry. “On the other hand, you're right. Holmeses are not in the habit of leaving their family in trouble. As for the rest of it, I haven't put the whole picture together yet.
Take John for instance. Sherlock didn't need much - just a couple of bruises and ugly enough ribs to have an excuse for an X-ray, but instead of acquiring all the injuries in a controlled environment with an experienced medic present (a medic who's used to dealing with a lot worse physical damage than that), John prefers to capitulate before the useless social stereotypes and his repressed guilt, and flatly refuses.
“My gun’s in my clothes somewhere. Get it, please.”
“You are paranoid,” Sherlock jerks his head. “We can't be bugged – we chose this place completely randomly.”
“Sleep,” he utters quietly. “You need it more. It’s my turn to keep watch.”
“It’s not necessary, John. No one’s coming.”
“I'm brooding? Yes, of course, because you prefer not to think at all, don't you? Let Sherlock do all the thinking, why not? You'll just whistle a tune and all will settle by itself!”
John doesn't notice when, but somehow Sherlock has already reached the bathroom, taken the pills out of the cupboard and is now handing them to John along with a glass of water. Mechanically, John swallows them, walks to the bedroom (Sherlock's), and only when dragging the unusually cool blanket over his head does he realise that although The Golden Ram is not an upper-class pub, it's still far from ordinary: slave owners bring their slaves there, but they're not allowed in. Is Sherlock planning on wearing a disguise?
Morstan listens to him intently without saying a word.
The anticipated letter, indeed, comes the next day, and straight after work, with barely a bite to eat, John is on his way to the address Sherlock has given him. He's almost not surprised to discover a seemingly decent and not at all expensive private dental clinic there. It's obviously a busy day; the young girl at the reception desk asks him to leave his number for them to get back to him. John has received strict instructions to hand the letter over to the recipient in person, though.
Sherlock grins.
“The back of the palm,” Sherlock suggests then. “A glove will cover it easily.”
He touches the dark mark on his neck. It can add a damn lot. It's either going to free them or introduce awkwardness they've never even dreamed of. On the other hand, no one has ever had a reason to accuse Sherlock Holmes of being a coward.
Then without any noise or commotion the door under his hand opens and the room is quickly and quietly overtaken by persons in urban camouflage. Before Greg even has a chance to recover or realize what's happening, his arms are twisted behind him, one sleeve roughly pulled up almost to his elbow and he feels a painful sting of an injection on the inner side of his forearm. Greg's not sure if the cold shiver under his skin is real or imagined.
John frowns. “It's not about me, it's about you.”
John checks his watch and by some miracle, it's not quite six yet. He'd thought it was close to midnight. “Give me the number,” he replies in a tense voice.
“A secret admirer?” Sherlock allows his voice to express interest and a hint of surprise.
A strained chuckle comes from the other side of the bedroom. Then the door creaks and John is alone.
Despite wanting very much to throw the yellow slave garb into the rubbish, Sherlock makes himself fold it carefully and put it in the bag instead of his own clothes. First, he doesn't have this kind of disguise in his collection yet, and second, there is no reason to leave evidence.
“In one piece.” Bruised ribs don't matter.
“Yes, of course,” the detective agrees indifferently. “I didn’t explain it to you, did I.”
“Yes,” he replies drily. “Did my slave do something?”
“All right.” Morstan leans back on the sofa. “Find out who my secret admirer is and I'll arrange the transportation for you.”
Sherlock walks through into the kitchen, managing not to disturb John. The doctor is almost comically focused conjuring coffee out of his new, rather simple coffee pot, which he's obviously bought some time during the last week and hasn't used once.
There's a short pause and Sherlock is opening his mouth to deliver 'you see?' when John interrupts.
In truth, one of his lower teeth is a bit loose and aches unpleasantly. Sherlock had just been in the process of feeling it with his tongue, tasting blood.
Unravelling of Moriarty's web has proved very difficult despite the fact that by the end of the first week at home Sherlock was spending all his time either up and about all around London or sitting in their living room surrounded by the daily newspaper editions.
“Before you moved out of Baker Street in December Sherlock Holmes was treated at the A&E twice. He paid in cash; who was responsible for the injuries?”
“What are you getting at then?”
“So what now?”
The flat is small but apparently cosy - if one liked that sort of thing, but it’s too conventionally neat for Sherlock’s taste. John looks around with exaggerated enthusiasm. It's obvious he's checking for ceramic elephants, statues of Buddha and Shiva, and incense sticks.
John gets a packet of powdered caffeine out of his medicine kit, pours it into a glass, fills two-thirds of the glass with sugar and finishes the concoction with mineral water. He drinks the disgusting mixture almost choking and he has to keep his hand on his mouth after every gulp. Then John takes in plenty of water and contemplates adding a diuretic into the mix, but decides to skip it – what if he needs to suddenly run off somewhere. The fuzz in his head clears up a little.
But on the brighter side - I bet most of you didn't think there even would be an update, right? Surprise!! :)
“Watson has no such talent. No, I believe that this primitive little soul is, in fact, all there is to see – a possessive maniac with a fixation on Sherlock Holmes.”
Cool water does clear John's head a bit, so when they come out of the shower he demands an explanation from Sherlock, who seems to become so disgustingly domestic that he expropriates the only dressing gown they can find in the room. John doesn't let himself be irritated for long, however, and wraps himself into a blanket (it's not Sherlock's prerogative to walk around pantless in a sheet, is it?). Unless the room is bugged...
“Well,” John offers with feigned indifference, “it depends on what kind of bruises you need. Or scratches.”
“Why did you decide to buy Holmes when it clearly exceeded your financial means?”
“My name is Christina May. You can ask about me at the municipal clinic, everybody knows me there. We help people like you. You can come to our classes in your free time – we have night and morning groups. Can you read?”
His wound-up demeanour does not in any way resemble his usual composure, namely that of a professional who knows his own worth, and much less even the reverence he used to treat Sherlock with before. Sherlock knows what earned him the previous servility as well as he knows the molar mass of hydrogen: during his investigation he'd uncovered some discrepancies in tax reports, but hadn't bothered to communicate them to the Yard – very dull.
Actually, the bailiff has already been to check on them once – a standard procedure when it comes to newly converted slaves. Sherlock was silent, stared at the floor and and behaved; John spoke to the official civilly and even poured her tea. All things considered they passed the check-up well.
“Do what?” John bites his lip. “What are you trying to achieve by acting like a slave? Drawing them out with live bait?”
Sherlock nods. “I have money.” He notes that she didn't ask if his master would pay.
“Moving. How about running it past me first? Or, I don't know, at least giving me a heads up?”
Sherlock is chocking with anger and bewilderment. It's absurd... why would he... After all, it's not John, who's a slave! It's not his freedom being restricted!
Nothing, that's what. Because even Sherlock himself has succumbed to stress apparently; namely his instant capitulation before John's refusal to hit him. Astonishingly Sherlock didn't even try to persuade John. Instead he promptly offered a compromise, and it's only because he remembered the expression John had on his face when The Golden Ram owner was opening the slave cage. Like a coward, Sherlock preferred to avoid the repeat experience. The archaeological holidays in Devon will indeed benefit them both.
Sherlock rises. Feels his neck. The temporary collar and the heavy one from last night have already left their traces. Soon they will become permanent unless he figures out how to get rid of the humiliating slave status. Immaterial. It's just appearances, because John intends it to be so. Because he could- no. John couldn't.
Fleetingly, Sherlock wonders why John isn't sitting yet; thankfully his confusion lasts only a moment, otherwise he would have started doubting his mental abilities. Of course he's not sitting, when Sherlock himself is still standing and gawking at the interior, although he can already list all the most important events in Dr Desai's life for the last five years and name (with a fifty pound accuracy) the monthly sum she gives out of her pocket to 'charity', but which actually goes for 'the cause'.
“Sorry,” John utters. “If doing the dishes matters that much to you then go ahead.”
“Too much talk. And too much distance,” John says, panting. “I can live without a blowjob this first time. Come here.”
“My master,” Sherlock stresses the words. “Can't come. Please, Lestrade, we need to talk... privately. Not here. In the park, perhaps?”
At this point John finally loses the last thread of his coherent thoughts. Everything is a blur, muddled and sliding sideways. John springs up from the chair and straight at the lamp. He's vaguely surprised at his success, because the room careens to its side, behind John's left shoulder, the lamp slams him in the face, and in the streaked light John sees somebody's wide opened eyes behind a pair of spectacles with scratched lenses – oh, those bloody bastards!
“Of course,” Morstan replies instantly. “It’s still relevant. We still have no usable plan. Are you going to help us? In terms of payment, I can-”
At six he actually does it. Moreover, he leaves the door unlocked (in case Sherlock comes back bleeding and having lost the keys); just leaves a note 'Gone to the Yard' between the door jamb.
Staring at the carpeting on the floor, Sherlock remembers why Mycroft was crying: he'd dropped father's globe, an antique, the wood had cracked and as a punishment he'd been forbidden to go outside for a week. It had seemed unbearable to him to sit in the house in such sunny summer weather, just at the beginning of the holidays.
Life on Baker Street is back on its usual track. Indeed, very little has changed; John continues doing the shopping, making tea, and grumbling about Sherlock refusing to eat. There are some particulars, but Sherlock decides not to draw John's attention to them just yet; it could be a case of simple statistic anomaly. Besides, he's really not interested in John getting back to nagging at him about whose turn it is to do the dishes again.
“You were looking at my collar with almost painful interest, which I must confess you hid very well. Not well-enough for an experienced observer, though. You probably don't have much contact with personal slaves, as you don't get them as clients very often, but your interest is clearly a bit more than idle curiosity. You obviously realised that my slave status is a recent development and it's made you deeply sympathetic. One of your closest has undergone a similar experience. A fiancé, or more probably a sibling. It happened a while ago and you've lost all contact with them and know nothing about their fate. But the feeling of guilt hasn't abandoned you and you continue seeing them in every slave you meet.
“Sherlock.” Mycroft nods. “I can't be sure how he managed to get into my room - Winston must have left orders to forbid it. Perhaps with time his role as a slave made him seem harmless to the medical personnel. They might have relaxed around him at some point and Sherlock noticed a discrepancy with the treatment procedures or the list of drugs which, no doubt, was carefully concealed from Dr Watson. By that point my brother might not have yet realised the whole scope of the situation he'd got into with Moriarty – Sherlock tends to delude himself on occasion and every so often it can last for a considerable time. However, the discovery must have been a shattering experience to sober him up. He must have realised that he won't be able to defeat his opponents nor return to his previous life without my help. It's highly doubtful that there were any other considerations at play when he organised my rescue from the clinic.”
“He can't breathe on his own. Couldn't before either, not a breath of fresh air around the man... and the ties he used to wear... If Sherlock weren't a slave he'd pull the plug. But it's his family, you know... I'm glad that Sherlock's a slave now... I'm glad.” John laughs hysterically and almost misses the slap they try to bring him back to his senses with. “I go forth and Sherlock follows...”
And then they have “The Case of the Mad Blackmailer”, as John aptly names it in his notebooks, and the chase where they dash after the aforementioned blackmailer (an absolute halfwit, though the nature of his wit being a half only makes it more difficult to catch him) straight through the halls of Harrods.
“What?” John stiffens.
From that point on, the conversation flows smoothly and doggedly around neutral topics: weather, football, politics, all in a painfully law-abiding tone. Mainly it is John and Morstan who talk, the host and Sherlock remaining silent and nodding in a supportive manner where necessary. Finally, Rohan stands up to head to the kitchen for biscuits and Sherlock glances at John. Luckily he gets it (they discussed this manoeuvre previously) and offers his enthusiastic help.
At this point Sherlock has to shut up because John turns to him, pushes him down on the bed and rolls himself over Sherlock, supporting himself on straight arms on the pillow on either side of his head.
Then he asks, “I take it you're one of the key figures dealing with The Kameraden abroad, Mr Morstan? Note that I'm not asking if your partners at Smith, Ferguson and Co. are also part of the movement.”
“Winston would have suspected me in any case, that was a given from the start, so it was essential that he would not find anything that would confirm his suspicions. Which means that I had to look like the most ordinary of slaves: beaten and broken. But with you as my master? No one who knows us both - and thanks to The Strand, it’s the whole population of London - would believe it.”
This is where John breaks down. He moans and almost cries, “Me! It was all me...” He wants to say that he hadn't wanted to, that Sherlock had asked him to, that he's not some kind of a sadist, for God's sake, but somehow, almost against his will, it gets out a bit differently, “He asked... I did it for him! He was bloody... gagging for it!” Then John remembers how Sherlock fell down the stairs, but manages to hold his tongue: a vague sense of Sherlock preferring them not to know is somewhere at the back of his head. John doesn't remember why, but that's somehow less important.
“Sparring without protective gear. You know, like we did before visiting Ms Adler.”
Sherlock speaks too quickly, his eyes, red from apparent wakefulness, move restlessly back and forth. John simply stares at him in stunned amazement. He just wants to listen to Sherlock's voice. And listen and listen and listen...
Suddenly John's lips twitch and he giggles. Sherlock exhales through his teeth and he too realises the absurdity of the situation. A second later they are howling with laughter. Sherlock's diaphragm is compressing rather painfully and his jaw is aching again. Apparently John doesn't feel much better, because they have both slid down to the floor, holding onto each other; somehow they've managed to settle with their backs to the fridge. Sherlock doesn't notice how his head ends up on John's shoulder, but he's quite comfortable with it - his back of the head still hurts from laughing, although he can't even laugh properly any more; the most he's able to do is gasp silently.
How dare he...
John wants to wake up, but can't, because Sherlock starts speaking, and he speaks in a way that he's never spoken awake – with a deep, pleading intonation.
“It went seamlessly. They didn’t publicly rescind the charges, though, and that was what we actually appealed for,” John says. “They hushed Winston’s whole case up and Mycroft either couldn’t or wouldn’t argue it. So they just returned Sherlock his citizenship… damn, what was the term they used…”
“Ah…” Mycroft taps his fingers on the arms of his chair. As always he seems to have caught on without Greg having to elaborate. “Yes, of course. Tell me, Detective Inspector, can you really see my brother in a role of an abused housewife?”
Suddenly Sherlock feels an icy stab in his solar plexus. For a second he can't even recall how to breathe.
‘What? A body!?’ If John would have any strength left he wouldn't waste it on screaming. He'd leap up from the floor and go straight for the jugular of that... the one with the cane. But there's not even strength for a whisper.
Having answered the question, his physical discomfort lessens to an almost manageable level.
The logistics of lips, teeth and tongue, as it turns out, call for some working out, but on the whole...
“And that's why you left your wife home?”
“And you were quite sure of it?” The interrogator's voice is on the verge of being soft, calm almost, but the sharp pain in Lestrade's twisted arm isn't letting up. “You didn't get an impression that Holmes's current owner treats him well?“
“Yes, exactly. I do read your mind.” Sherlock nods. “That's how truly brilliant I am. On this occasion however, your meaning has escaped me.”
“You said you were fine!”
Curious reaction. It probably means nothing more than a friendly support in this context, right? Either way it's obvious to Sherlock that John's sexual exploits are not limited to the female population even if he does generally prefer their company. Perhaps what he's set out to do will be even easier than he thought.
“Yes, yes, of course,” John mutters, crossing the threshold.
“Come again?”
“Perhaps you’re right. But I can’t just… I can’t… Sherlock - you disappeared. Again. They could have… again… I simply won’t be able to… To get rid of you…? You were brilliant, Sherlock! Once more you were absolutely brilliant - this plan - a cruel one, yes, but… It’s like bloodletting, how can you not get it? Fuck, Sherlock… ”
It seems that Sherlock has cause for self-admonishment the second time today. He had pegged the salesperson to be Rohan's abolitionist contact. He should have seen that the cosmetics seller, displaying all the signs of leading a lonely life but with a wedding band on her left hand, was  not trying to mislead her clients, but a widow who followed East Slavic traditions; and therefore she's of the same ethnic origin as the nurse, which is the reason for their close relationship (neither the nurse nor the doctor were interested in the goods she was selling).
Sherlock is sitting on the sofa, his fingers steepled under his chin, his head thrown back and his legs stretched out in front of him. The pose contains so much hidden strength, nervous energy and, at the same time, adolescent vulnerability that John feels his heart constrict. It tends to keep happening lately, this involuntary movement of his heart muscles, when he looks at Sherlock. John tries to fight the tendency since this is one of the reasons why Sherlock accused him of hypocrisy. Besides, heart problems in his situation are rather superfluous. What would happen to Sherlock if he...
The beer isn't helping. Blearily he stares at the TV screen, making a conscious effort not to look outside. He doesn't always succeed – and glances in the direction of the large windows: Sherlock is standing stock-still, arms crossed over his chest, his expression stoic. The stoicism seems to be dictated by Stacy's behaviour: she's pacing back and forth inside the cage, clapping her hands to get warm, and judging by the clouds of air puffs visible around her mouth, constantly chattering. It obviously irritates Sherlock a great deal. Surprising really that it still hasn't incited a rude remark out of him to cut her off.
Sherlock obeys. He holds the ice as told until it melts, and by then the feel of nausea along with the simmering rage have still not abated.
John thinks someone might have touched him with his foot, but by this point his body hardly feels anything and he wouldn't try crawl away even if he weren't tied.
“Fine.” Sherlock smiles sardonically. “The trainee nurse gave me some vitamins.”
“I didn't agree to anything!” Greg stubbornly contradicts. “I know that Sherlock Holmes used to solve crimes and that he still does. I had... fuck, good reasons to assume... that it had something to do with one of his cases! And I haven't been on a vacation for the past three years, wife's been whining that I need to rest, so...”
“Oh yes, Winston, no doubt, would have preferred to place me in one of his infamous basements.” Mycroft smirks. “Fortunately I'm still a too well known a figure in certain circles to have just vanished – or even killed – without questions. That's why an ordinary private clinic, respectable doctors, visiting hours. Personnel was, of course, replaced, bought off or simply intimidated into compliance. I guess Dr Watson – a GP – was regarded harmless and respectable enough to offer a public alibi, so to speak.”
Getting to the Underground also turns out to be a challenge – several times John has to stop,  recite the multiplication table and hold his hand to his chest. Thankfully, Londoners are a patient folk and simply go round. Only one young man who, John thinks, looks like a med student (Sherlock's methods starting working for him?) asks him if he's all right.
Sherlock knows. Sherlock makes mistakes, but not once has he done so with fatal consequences. And John promised.
“No, of course not. But that the set-off date of their trip as well as their return were contingent with my approval has always been a part of my deal with them. I disliked the idea that they could be apprehended because of the Movement; they could very well give us away. It would be a shame to work so hard and then fail because of stupidity of others.”
“Everything went all right?” John asks.
“Whatever you need.” John carefully closes the door behind him.
He returns to the Yard, where a young lad, who seems vaguely familiar (and going by the way he's overcompensating on friendliness, the lad has the same feeling about John), tells him that Lestrade is on vacation, has been for two days, and it’s absolutely impossible to get in touch with him. This is a dead-end: John has no interest in talking to any of Lestrade's team since they were the ones that so unanimously sent Sherlock to the block.
and similar journals for the past... year, I think. They should have an 'exchange' sections in their adds.”
Greg opens the window, wonders if he should perhaps take a walk to buy cigarettes, but remembers that in this God's forsaken place all the shops close at six; then he remembers that the bus station he arrived at has a convenience store and it's literally just at a stone's throw distance. Then he thinks about the withdrawal period and decides not to go anywhere at all, especially taking into account the note that asked him to remain in his room and not to leave it under any circumstances, but his hands are already pulling on his jacket and the warm coat.
“Here... a  couple of things,” he says in a strange voice. “I thought you'd want to change.”
“Certainly.” Morstan nods, stunned. “Of course.”
“The second manoeuvre was necessary for you and Lestrade to be released as soon as possible. I made sure that suspicion in kidnapping Mycroft from the hospital would fall on alternative parties who are also interested in gaining access to the database: military intelligence. There was this man, Lawrence Tucker. He worked for the military and the abolitionists both. The first he provided with intelligence and from the second got their discarded weapons. On the side, he also ran some errands for Winston.”
It's an awkward topic for Greg. Immediately after the trial he only phoned Baker Street once and upon hearing from John that everything was 'all right', he latched onto that excuse to throw their problems out of his head. Since everything was all right and all. After Sherlock's conviction he had plenty of his own problems; a lengthy IA inspection where heads rolled with very little forewarning. Greg is still surprised that he managed to retain his seat. He suspects it was because the homicide chief yelled at the head of the Department of Internal Affairs that if he demoted Lestrade into constables, then who in their right mind would catch all the murderers on such a salary. Patrol officers?! And besides...
“I'm a dwarf now, am I? And the girly locks – is that a family trait too? You spend more time on spraying your hair in the morning than I brushing my teeth!”
Is it important? John once told told him that children can cry for thousands of reasons.
I'm sorry it took me so long.
“Yes. I'll even take them.”
'I'm afraid I'll get used to it,' John thinks with growing feeling of despondence in his chest. 'I'll get used to talking about you as if you're a thing. I'll get used to you as my property. Not you as a person, not as Sherlock Holmes – I'll never think of you as less than what you are. But to accept that your body is a commodity... decide that it is quite normal... to live it – no, I can't do it´.
“What was the falling out with your sister about?”
Sherlock's not too worried when John is silent; in some ways it is even more comfortable. He'd just prefer not to deal with the aftermath of a heart attack if it's avoidable.
“Please, let me see him,” John moans, lying on the floor. “Or let him go. You don't have to let me go. Let him. No, don't! He's a slave, he can't be out there...”
John allows their fingers to touch while he accepts the handle, and sits up.
I know there is no excuse, but I'm going to apologise anyway.
“You're a treasure, Lucy,” he unwittingly tells her. “One of these day's I'll steal you from Mr Riddle, just so you know. Who was it? The police?”
The Russian (or a Pole?) makes a face, a judgement either on his confidence or on his slave status, but says nothing. The saleswoman pointedly stares past him.
A sharp, almost childish resentment rises up in him, and bitterly he wonders why everybody – yes, everybody, even Sherlock to some extent, – seems to suspect him of having less than noble intentions. As if he asked for any of it. As if he'd somehow arranged for Sherlock to become his slave. As if he's...
Among other things he visits the library, makes a couple of inquiries via phone, sends two international letters and one telegram. At least at the post office no one pays him any attention: it's quite common for slaves to send letters for their masters. They even have a separate 'slave window' so that they don't have to queue with their betters. Sherlock remembers that the slave queue sometimes moves even faster during the rush hour, because personal slaves mostly belong to influential people and therefore it might be potentially dangerous to keep them waiting. At this moment, though, it is of no consequence since the post office is empty.
“Good morning to you too. Coffee?”
John thinks of keeping silent just on principle. Surely, the man has a dossier in front of him anyway. A typical thin beige carton folder most likely. A small ugly file on a funny little man with a propensity for failing: either he gets in the way of bullets like an idiot or manages to get a sack pulled over his eyes like a civilian dope. While Sherlock...
“I want to hear it from you. What school did you go to?”
“Not exactly. Anyway, there are no bugs and even if there were, we already gave away the whole plan the moment we stepped into this room.”
Yes, he was right about the man. John, on the other hand, obviously has to brace himself at hearing the words. Apparently, other people can't read John's face as well as Sherlock can. His former friend and current owner looks as if he is being tortured.
“And the rest of it? How...? I…” John thinks it through and then spits it out, “I don’t remember much of what happened, but what I bloody well do remember is that apparently I did behave as a ‘maniac with a fixation on Holmes’ as that - what’s-his-name - Winston put it. I thought about it on the train - if it wasn’t hypnosis, then what was it?”
“Just don't tell me it's good.” It is possible that John is on the verge of explosion, and he needs to explain. “It is not good. It can't be. Should be entirely unnecessary. I know that you've never cared about the institution of slavery, but...”
“I never actually was, as you so eloquently put it, in a vegetative state,” Mycroft explains. “I was, however, under the influence of strong sedatives which simulated the said state. It was orchestrated by my old-time foe and rival whose name at this point is...  Or why not... Winston from the Home Office. At one point he even employed our mutual friend, Jim Moriarty, now as I've been told, deceased.”
“I'm working tomorrow,” John reminds him. “And we are going to A&E.”
That night John doesn't get a wink of sleep. He's taken apart and reassembled his revolver several times, checked the extra bullets in it's hiding place behind the fridge, has done push-ups - one hundred and fifty plus (has to force himself to stop when he loses count, because the last thing he needs the next day are trembling limbs), then paces several miles worth of carpet circles.
His delight evaporates the same instant his jaw is met with a hardy fist. The blow is nasty, hurtful; one might very well say goodbye to his teeth after a couple of blows like this. Out of pure reflex he turns round to get his assailant back twice as hard when an excruciating burning pain in his neck incapacitates him. All of it - the face and the neck - is so crushingly abhorrent that he drops straight to the ground, knees hitting the cool tiles, his forehead the stone floor.
The 'municipal hole' is just down the street and Sherlock doesn't even need to walk past to remember it: he's been there for a case. A shabby medical centre with equipment worthy of torture chambers, and a separate wing for 'townies': slaves in cleaning services, garbage collecting, and such – the majority of whom have been picked from homeless crowd. Generally they tend to escape the slavery quickly (municipal collars are cheap, it's not difficult to find a handyman to pick it), soon appear back on the streets only to be nabbed for vagrancy once more. For many this cycle goes on for years, until due to repeat offences they're are taken to the mines, hard labour camps or sent to the mines on the continent.
Sherlock is watching John's hands closely so he sees very clearly how the package with the humiliating device is taken out of the sports bag on the doctor's hip. Leather and plastic. The lightest model, relatively expensive, but not a luxury item. Sensible and level-headed choice. Very much like John. A metal tag. “Property of John H. Watson” and a Baker Street phone number. Which means he ordered it yesterday at the latest and paid for an urgent commission. Where did he get the funds? If Mycroft had been... able, Sherlock would have suspected his involvement. Sherlock's own accounts are arrested. John has always worked miracles with his pension, but everything has a limit.
“Makes sense.” Morstan nods. “By the way, I'm an old admirer of Doctor Watson's stories. Tell me, can you really just delete unnecessary data? Like the solar system, for instance?”
“I'll write a monograph on the impact of social stereotypes on professional skills,” Sherlock continues in the same calm voice, “and you're going to publish it.”
“Couldn't stand him. Never in his corner, that one. I've... a sister too, I know how it is. Doesn't matter... Who can live like that? And now he’s in a coma, the son of a bitch.”
“I don't speak English,” his guest says in a strong German accent. “Follow me. The password is Sally Donovan's knees.”
“Alright, let's not risk concussion,” Sherlock agrees as lightly. “It would even be in character, considering.”
He wants to insist, go in with Sherlock and make sure that he gets his X-ray – the doctor on duty might forgo it with a slave – but then gives in. To hell with Sherlock – he’s not a child, he's perfectly capable of pressuring the medical staff into doing his will even from his position. Sherlock cherishes his hands, he needs them for the violin; so John just nods and goes to work.
“What do you know about the whereabouts of Mycroft Holmes?”
“I've got a loose tooth.”
No, idiotic thoughts: John is trustworthy, Desai's taken and her overall character also suggests loyalty as a strong trait. Besides, a mere fifteen minutes alone is unlikely to evoke any strong feelings. And still the fact remains: who in their right mind would choose some City lawyer if they could have John Watson!
“Fine. Will you now tell me why the acrobatics?”
John tries to blink away the terrible ache in his eyes, along with the pain in his previously twisted arms. No. There's no way out, not a chance, only an unbearable voice behind the light.
“Yes, but in the case of the implanted tracker the law allows you to forgo the stun feature, which makes the collar a lot lighter. It's handy with females, especially the young. And you can embed it where the scar will be unnoticeable.”  The brown suit winks.
“Where did the idea of writing detective stories come from?”
“I thought that maybe you hypnotised me or something like that.” John looks away. “I remember you were interested in the technique at one time.”
“Sold your younger brother to pay for your education?” he finishes for her. “Incredible! I knew that Kerala was one of the most progressive states, but I had no idea that their emancipation was so far progressed that a daughter's well-being might be considered more important than son's... Oh! Right.” He snaps his fingers. “Product of adultery, wasn't he? You weren't aware.”
“Irrelevant.” Sherlock waves his hand. A thousand thoughts are rushing through his head, thousands of scenarios, thousands of women with a million dazzling smiles, tens thousands of hands, billions of words – said and unsaid – in tens of alternative universes. “I find our circumstances just as distasteful as you do, although I still find myself indifferent to the lives of strangers. However (and I don't want you to take this the wrong way), the idea of you being unable to do anything else but accept me in your life sounds rather appealing.”
Stop.
“This farce will have to go on, of course. We stay at this bloody modern monstrosity of the apartment and keep a low profile. Probably for some time.” Sherlock tone is fast, but measured, and John is not fooled for a second about his deliberate show of tranquility. “I don’t think Mycroft’s return to the political scene can be fast, especially considering that most likely he will soon be declared dead. But there’s no chance in hell he will leave it like this. It might come to the two of us having to cooperate.”
“You don't look that young,” John snorts, momentarily realising Sherlock means the sweet colourful pills that nurses generally kept in their cabinets for the youngest patients.
Sherlock has no intention of venting his anger on John. It would be absolutely irrational, futile, and not to mention ineffective. Besides, he knows very well that John shouted for help in the heat of the moment without any subconscious (or conscious) wish to humiliate Sherlock. He also understands that the 'ice incident' was a perfectly normal response of care for John, and that four months ago he would have acted in exactly the same way.
But money is a necessity. In this case John's miserly point of view holds true: they do need to fulfil their monetary commitments, although the bank didn't even try to present the conditions Harry got her loan on as fair (Urgent loan? But of course!).
“Did something happen, Mrs Hudson?” he asks. “What did you want to talk about? I assure you,  it’s perfectly safe here even if John and I are away...”
“Of course, Mrs Hudson,” he replies almost merrily in a fit of coughing.
John can't hold back his snort. It's true, so far it has indeed seemed to be 'the other way around' and it's nice of Sherlock to admit it.
“Why not?” The investigator's voice still holds the same cold interest that somehow makes Greg feel better and he just wants to keep talking and talking.
“Yes.” Sherlock nods. “I guess you could say that.”
“Fine. I'll make an appointment with a licensed salon.” John clenches his jaw. “Shoulder?”
An hour later, when John returns from his walk with nicotine patches, a bottle of paracetamol and an anti-inflammatory ointment (a minimal set necessary in case Sherlock's thinking becomes so intense that any cohabitation in the flat automatically becomes an irritant), the living room is utterly silent.
“Later!” Sherlock growls and practically pushes John out of the door, throwing his jacket after him. “Take a walk, I need to think – our lives depend on it. And get some nicotine patches!”
“Ah! You were listening to me after all.” John smiles slightly. “The momentum, yes. Well, it's been two months already, you know.”
Sherlock almost hears John's irritated and weary voice in his head, and then as if for a purposeful contrast, John starts whistling “Somewhere over the rainbow”. Ineptly.
Twice? Really? No, don't think about the second time! They went very late and Sherlock insisted that they stay until past midnight, and then they took a taxi home.
“No, of course not. I don't even know if he's still alive. In India there are... some enlightened businessmen who actually kill their slaves when they cease bringing them pleasure. When the slave starts shaving for instance. So I've been told. In Britain manners are milder though.” When she raises her eyes, the look in them is bitter. “Slavery is much more civilised here. You can even get fined for killing a slave!”
Sherlock had anticipated shouting and protests. Not this. Even forceful removal or arrest for aggressive behaviour hadn't seemed out of the question. It's what the good doctor had been afraid of, most likely. He left so as not to lose his self-control. Strange. John is well known for always keeping his composure, but Sherlock has always presumed that it doesn't extend to him, the only one in the world, and so on. Sherlock has been mistaken, obviously. There's always something... Pity. He was going to pass John a code for his instructions. He'll have to find another way.
“Files. Cases. I called them bombs, because they always... exploded and Sherlock... I could lose him at any time, you know... They all wanted to take him from me... Mycroft wanted to take him from me, too, but in the end he didn't protect him, oh no, and now it's only me...”
“God damn you... Go visit the dentist before the jaw swells up!”
Lestrade has a feeling that he can hear a slight parental envy underneath the calm tone, but he ignores it.
The X-ray is done by the blonde nurse, not Russian after all he decides, but still from somewhere in the USSR. Perhaps Yugoslavia. Married, two children, husband works in construction. Clothing and make-up are very cheap - from sales in the supermarket; all for the sake of her children. Definitely not an abolitionist – she avoids looking at his collar (and Sherlock himself) as much as she can.
John goes to the kitchen and busies himself at the sink. Perfectly natural. The doctor's pedantic nature demands him to start with the dishes, which he naturally does himself. Even though yesterday John was away until late, wasting his precious time on runny noses of some strangers while Sherlock had been relatively idle, because the case only came today with the morning post.
A helpful, although very obviously hurrying to finish up her shift, woman explained to him that his slave was caught while trying to board a passenger ship to France without a ticket. Since the slave refused to identify himself, the standard protocol was engaged – they checked the tattoo and found the owner in the record system. The missing slave form had already arrived in the morning, that's why everything happened so quickly, Mr Watson… Medical check-up showed the slave to be in a satisfactory condition, so he could be retrieved within the week in working hours, but Mr Watson should be forewarned that they start counting the cost of the slave's up-keeping from the moment they identify the owner and at the moment it amounts to... Yes, they are open on Saturdays, but only from eight to five and unfortunately they are closed on Sunday... He can either bring them the ownership certificate himself, along with his passport and the fine for his slave having been caught without a collar, or mail them the request for having his slave sent up to their London division. After receiving the request with the prepaid check for the fine and the slave's up-keep we will send the delivery within three weekdays. Though you should also let us know over the phone, I can make a note right now if... You'll come yourself? Very well, Mr Watson, we will be expecting you...
“They won't let you into the library,” John cuts him off. “I'll need to fill your sign-up form.”
Of course. John hadn't slept, because he was busy filling application forms. It's possible he even had to bribe someone: everything had been done very quickly.
Alas, despite trying to distance himself from the mix of barely controllable emotions, called forth by the adrenalin and thyroxine boiling in his blood, Sherlock can't escape into his mind palace.
Since the door lacks the sign of the crossed out collar, Sherlock enters – and instead of finding himself in the lobby with a reception table, he appears to have stepped into a rather cosy room with a small table holding a Russian samovar. Sitting at the table are three women: one obviously from India (the owner) in a blue medical gown, one from Eastern Europe somewhere (probably the owner of the samovar), wearing a white gown over a blouse and a skirt, and one in ordinary clothing (salesperson, selling cosmetics). The tea is drunk from Arabic bowls.
“God, that was awful,” John gets out between his giggles, wiping tears from his eyes.
“Where are you going?” John asks, grabbing his very solid shoulder, still hot from sleep.
Having applied the same methods as with the Chinese restaurants, Sherlock finds a suitable place in central London. Although it's a small clinic and not in the busiest street (residential area, ethnic district - rent must be cheaper), it's also a respectable place and the clientèle is quite diverse, including not entirely legal immigrants and seasonal workers. The place is owned by a woman of Indian descent who studied in England. Lives and works legally, but has a soft spot for charity cases and especially immigrants from her homeland, which is the reason she's not better off, although on the whole she's not doing too bad. In short, she's one of those people you'd call 'a good person' and 'a pillar of the crown'.
But that will definitely not do.
Suddenly the window frame squeaks and moves upwards. Into the opening gap, where the darkness has been quite for some time now firmly established, appears one more dark-clothed figure, and slips quietly in. And once more Greg doesn't manage to react in time, but this time around it's not important, because when the visitor removes their back hat, it reveals light closely-cut hair and a girly, quite youthful, face. The girl smiles and puts her finger to her lips.
“Devon? Why Devon?”
He’s alluding to the scheme of stealing identities for escaped slaves that the Movement has tried to develop, but so far they hadn't come up with anything worth the risk.
“He's... the British government...”
“I'm not back-pedalling, but-”
“Removed, huh?” the dentist sighs.
While Sherlock is gathering his strength and getting up (there's nothing to hold on to and naturally no one helps him), John manages to quickly list the distinctive features of the fugitive and even describe the evidence (“a stack of audio cassettes in a plastic bag, he might be trying to destroy them”).
“What the hell am I supposed to think? You've always, from the moment we met, acted as if I'm not good for anything, as if I'd perish at the hands of the first idiot robber I come across! And now, here you go, as you please - I'm really no good for anything any more! I can't even fill out a form at the library! Happy, John Watson? Such a balm on the wounded vanity of a little man! No one could hold Sherlock Holmes back, and now, you give a shout and look – the whole of Scotland Yard is at your service! A sound investment it turned out to be, didn't it? Oh, no! What am I saying – it wasn't even your money. Not a dime to your name, is there? And never has been.”
“What I meant-” John has to swallow. “How are we going to...?”
“My God,” John groans and buries his face in his hands.
At length the dentist studies his teeth, frowns, then gives her opinion, “Number six is chipped; easy to fix. Seven is salvageable, I think; oral cavity is fine, but you need an X-ray. Can you pay?”
Sherlock, however, doesn't hear it. His perception is floating, crystallising into the familiar, unbearably lucid mode where he sees and observes everything: from the crack in the lamp shade to the calluses on the guard's hands; from a new wrinkle at the corner of John's mouth to a small speck of sauce near the official's thumb fingernail. He notices the room they are in, a cardboard box in a labyrinth of similar cardboard boxes as seen from above, sees tiny people-ants inside, and how one of those ants, a figurine representing so-called Sherlock Holmes, thirty-three of age, steps forward, lowers himself to his knees before another figurine, which represents a John Watson, thirty-nine years of age. It's only a matter of topology, just a change in position and coordinates, insignificant on the grand scale of things, the planet or even London. It has no meaning whatsoever.
“It doesn't matter,” he says quietly. “We'll manage.”
“Answer the questions, Mr Watson, and you have nothing to fear.”
And now for the one particular erogenous zone on a male body stimulation of which will get the same results each and every time...
Sherlock kisses him. It's only a peck, but it still goes through John like a powerful blast after which there can only be silence.
“Restoration,” Sherlock murmurs without turning around. “It’s called restoration, John.”
From their first steps over the threshold they both loathe the new place with vengeance.
“Sorry. It's just that we are such a married couple that...”
“Two sleepless nights,” Sherlock hotly mutters into John's ear. “Interrogation while intoxicated. Fucking Winston! One of these days I'll make sure he'll get the double dose of the same... No, triple! Unlikely that you'll make it into London in this shape. Not without me carrying you and we can't draw attention to ourselves; they could still be watching.
“John!” Sherlock grabs his shoulders and shakes him. Then, remembering that he doesn't have to hold back any more, he succumbs to the urge and fiercely kisses John on the lips. “We've caught hell, John,” he continues, turning away and feeling that despite of everything (or even because of it) his lips are spreading into a wide grin. “I've been unbelievably stupid. It's because of me that we are in it up to our ears.”
Sherlock is not shouting. Instead, he's smiling slightly, coldly; speaks in a controlled, snide tone. He aims at John's innermost centre of insecurities, at his anxieties, complexes; everything Sherlock knows his friend carries with him, the things they never speak of – of John feeling of uselessness and his almost debilitating sensitivity towards money matters.
“We have a very interesting discussion ahead of us, I see.” Morstan sits down, smiling only with his mouth.
John could do without visiting The Golden Ram. He has been there before and he wouldn't say that he especially liked it there. An ordinary pub, but the beer is more expensive and appetisers generally better. And there’s even a TV set suspended above the bar.
At times, it is difficult to reconcile himself to his reflection in the mirror. Sans bruises it seems as if something is missing. And on the street he has to make himself walk in front of John, because what he really wants (wants with inexplicable fierceness) is to walk a step behind him. John’s also obstinately helpful in this matter - he tends to determinately walk behind Sherlock’s left shoulder and if Sherlock sometimes forgets to monitor his behaviour and falls behind, John stubbornly slows his step or even stops all together. Sherlock is keenly aware that they probably look quite foolish when that happens, perhaps it even looks funny, though he never feels the desire to laugh himself.
Once a Sherlock… Well, a spade’s a spade, right?
“I'm here!” John exclaims and wakes up.
“And look what a fine job you've done,” she snickers. “They found him, uncollared, in a somewhat  shady situation, I was told. I have a number for you to call back from eight-thirty to six.”
In the end Greg gets angry with himself. Or, one might even say that he's disgusted with himself: he's over forty years old and never has he given in to cowardly voices in his head, and now he gets a wobbly? Yes, Sherlock is a slave now, but before he became one, he did a hell of a lot for Greg and his department, so the least Greg can do is to hear him out. But what if...
The security gets the blackmailer at one of the exits. The visit to Scotland Yard follows and then giving the statements, which mostly, John takes onto himself. Although before they reach the Yard, John stops at the grocer's and comes back with a packet of ice.
This time, though, no sooner have the glass doors opened than the girl from behind the counter starts waving her hands and yelling:
Raising his weary, bloodshot eyes, John manages to glimpse a silhouette of a short, overweight man in a good suit. With a walking stick. What's up with that? Them, with their umbrellas and stuff...
Yes. This is the only way. You have no other refuge besides my lips and my hands. I have nothing but your body in my arms.
John looks round. He has just realised that people in stalls might be privy to their conversation. Theoretically, nothing would happen to him for going soft on his slave. Some sidelong glances, a fine or two for inappropriate behaviour in public. Practically though... Sherlock knows of cases where judges 'concerned with civil order' (terrified of abolitionists) reassigned slaves to other (better paying) owners because of a too democratic treatment. Or simply confiscated into municipal ownership.
The official clucks his tongue approvingly. “A very good model. We have the same brand; ten years and no problems.”
The more time passes, the less Greg likes this whole blasted situation, but what a choice does he have? And if he's honest with himself, no one's forcing him.
“It's slavery for us both!”
“Not actually that rare for an ex-military. Especially if you take into account the repressed homosexual tendencies...” a third voice adds. Or should he call it the first voice? The four-eyed interrogator.
Almost against his will Sherlock bursts out laughing again. After a second John joins him.
It was about here that John noticed how all the traces of guilt gradually vanished from Sherlock’s tone and he continued in his usual excitement of explaining a puzzle.
“What do you mean, immaterial? My ownership could be annulled!”
“Detective Inspector, I need a word.”
Usually he removes the loathsome contraption as soon as he comes home (John has given him the key), but this time he didn't – no idea why.
“Have you heard the abbreviation ECM?”
“Oh?” Morstan raises his eyebrow. “And the matter we just finished discussing?”
Sherlock pauses. Then, visibly composed, adds, “Just as always, you're being dramatic.” He ignores John's incredulous 'I am?'. “My current situation has its advantages. At least I don't have to look imbeciles in the eye while telling them that they are imbeciles. I can just delegate all the communication to you.”
Half an hour later John's sitting on the pavement somewhere in East End, crying and repeating stupidly, “Sherlock... let him go, you bastards...”
An unfamiliar male voice answers him, “Are you all right, sir? What did this slave steal? Do you know where his master is?”
“Why did we even come here?” John inquires, his fists clenching of their own volition, his patience almost run out. What he really wants is to punch the closest frozen wall and the hell with his fingers.
“John!” the cheerful voice of Lucy Riddle, the head nurse, peals out. “There was a phone call for you.”
Greg is standing, not knowing what to do when a voice comes from inside of the room.
Anyway, the main plot is here. The last chapter is epilogue, so don't be afraid to read this now, even if it takes me another year to updae, there will be no huge cliff to hang off from, so no worries. You might want to reread the first two chapters hough. :)
Next, John is led through a narrow hall and ushered through an unpainted wooden door with a small square window. Sherlock is inside. For some reason John expects him to be sitting on a cot, but there is no cot to speak of – only some mattresses on the floor. Sherlock is the only one inside though. He's lying in a foetal position on a mattress in the corner. When the door opens, Sherlock jerks and lifts his head in the same motion.
“Well. Nothing serious,” the dentist decides, examining his X-ray. “Take your coat off, we need to apply the splint. It'll cost you...” She hesitates before naming the sum.
Sherlock, being the horrible person that he is, has the audacity to nod approvingly. “Later than I anticipated, but you are interpreting the evidence correctly.”
Procrastinating, Sherlock stands in front to the mirror in the bathroom, checking his own determination. How much does he want this? A long time ago he promised himself not to get involved in sexual experimentation unless he was... attracted. He's attracted to John, that much is certain. But to what extent? How fair is his plan to John?
John would have been spitting and seething had anyone used that condescending tone with him. She could be talking to a very slow child. How come Sherlock hasn't chewed her up yet? Or is he still playing at whatever he was playing at before... Or... What's wrong with him?
“You're right, Dr Desai,” Sherlock replies, tracing the edge of his collar with his fingers, almost subconsciously. “Slavery can never be morally justified.”
“We're playing chess,” Sherlock utters in such a tone that John decides not to ask for further details. “Irrelevant. It's just a dream. Apparently even I get tired sometimes. Let's go to Devon when this is over.”
“You're trying to bag Moriarty's network,” John states listlessly. “You're trying to fool people who know you. Know about you. And about me. You are showing them that I've started treating you like a real slave... My God, Sherlock. No one will believe it! No one who knows us even the slightest bit... Or... do I really come across as such a bastard? That I could actually betray my only... No, Sherlock! This is too much.”
Then Sherlock takes a step back, eyes the staircase one more time...
It's impossible not to listen though; the words are an insistent low hum of heavy machinery, a screech of a false note of a violin high above the ear. The spectators are leaving, the room is filled with their compassionate drone. People had sympathised with him during the hearings – John had managed a fully-fledged campaign in The Strand Daily. Sherlock was brought newspapers. But when has anyone ever been saved by a media campaign?
“What was the name of the curator of the university you went to?”
“Why in Clapton?” Sherlock asks with surprise. “Or… if they got him in… Yes, Clapton is quite possible, Probable even. How did you know?”
They are watching a game, the woman is rooting for the South American team, the man is listlessly sipping his beer. Momentarily John feels an intense dislike towards the couple despite the fact that overall they seemed quite an amicable people. The woman is actually a notable beauty, not surprising she braved purchasing a young slave.
Sherlock has always been interested in cognitive bias and attribute substitution, particularly in how good people (generally speaking good people) - despite being obviously hypocritical - so readily justify their actions or inaction with moral considerations that only lead to more problems.
“Please, take a seat,” Morstan invites them.
“Sherlock. Would you stop taking me for a bloody fool? What the hell are you trying to do? Why the falling down the stairs? The demonstrative sitting in a cage? And the A&E visit...” Suddenly it dawns on him. “You did that in A&E too! Made a spectacle of yourself, acted all slave-like? And you sent me away, so I wouldn't see! Did you humiliate yourself in front of them? The vitamins... Something even worse must have happened there or you wouldn't have told me about them, would you?” At this point John finally pieces it all together. “God, you're acting up on purpose, aren't you! For some damn reason you want to be seen as a real slave, and not just a slave, but a slave who's being abused by his master! Beats you, humiliates... That's why you've removed all your stuff from the living room. Am I right?”
One would need a very attuned ear to hear the faint condensation in her tone. Also, she's sincere in her compassion. A volunteer. A seamstress who helps people in her free time. As well as she knows how.
“And...?” John asks, mentally preparing himself for something graphic.
One more dim corridor (Sherlock remembers the layout of the building perfectly well, but what's the use – he won't be escaping), one more anteroom, this time somewhat more civilised. It reveals an unfamiliar official in a brown woollen suit, plump and seemingly good-natured,  – and John. He'd grown rather haggard in three days as if he were the one forced to eat prison gruel and stay up at nights to keep all his bits intact.
In the end, John goes, grumbling that in such a weather a dog shouldn't be sent outside, least of all retired army doctors with more than real shoulder wounds which (surprise-surprise) actually ache (wounds not doctors).
“All right.” John nods.
Sherlock doesn’t doubt John’s faithfulness, but it never quite quells his jealousy. Morstan is, after all a free m…
God knows what Sherlock thinks  of the order, but he obediently gets up and John can hear the rustle of clothes and the sound of his armchair being moved. Sherlock seems to find the revolver quickly, returns to the bed and hands the gun over.
“I'm aware,” Greg moans. His mood has changed yet again and now he wants to break out of his own skin, which is now prickling something awful, and howl like a dog, while a tiny, sober part of his consciousness is wondering in what other ways will the drug untie his tongue.
“I won't let this vociferous, brainless rabble drive me out of my city!” he growls leaping up from the sofa. “All my life I've lived as I wish, and I'm not going to allow anyone to force us into laying low, going underground, hiding from a society that isn't even worth it that you rack your brains over it, much less me! Especially when I haven't even paid back the people who've driven us into this trap!”
At the station his guard signs a journal on a cracked desk, where a same sex fornication has taken place at least three times. Then Sherlock is passed on to another guard, who (married, two children, a lover) jabs his fat finger into the base of Sherlock's neck, just under the collar. Yes, he should have lowered his head. Forgot. The detective has had a chance to imitate a slave before and knows very well how to conduct himself in that kind of situations. Shouldn't have got distracted. His thoughts seem to have scattered all over his traitorous mind just to hide from the reality of his situation.
'Look straight at him,' Greg tells himself, 'Maintain eye contact,' he adds and then does. To his surprise, Sherlock meets his eyes almost mockingly, with his own brand of sardonic smile you can barely guess at the corners of his lips.
“I was planning on faking my death and going into hiding.” Sherlock perches himself on the edge of the sofa, near John. “It might have been a more sensible way. Less painful.”
“Yes.” John nods. “He's my... friend.”
“Hm...” John pauses, apparently digesting what he's just heard and trying to calm down. Then he continues, “But this person, whoever he is, is probably somewhere high up in the government?” His voice is soft. “Sherlock, I... I hate to say this, but is there anything we can actually do in this situation? And it's not as if Mycroft actually needs it. Grown-ups don't wake up from a coma after several months – it's all TV show fairy tales. He can't even breathe by himself.”
“I don't know!” Greg almost bleats. The blood in his veins, hot and heavy, burns inside of him; it's as if a bit more and it will all burst out of him. He feels as if he needs to tell them everything, right now, and then run. Run anywhere, find cold - anything cold -, dig himself into the ice or fall into a freezing river - anything to calm the scorching lead they've replaced his blood with. “I don't know that... fucking... John Watson that well. I've shared a pint with him. Twice! Perhaps three times? Got the eyes of a killer, that one. Especially when he speaks of Sherlock. Seen plenty of those, the killer eyes, damn-it! How the hell should I know what's going on between those two?”
“Are you all right?”
Later that evening Sherlock sends his tactful correspondent a reply, informing her that her neighbour is keeping parrots, including specimens illegally imported from countries of South American Protectorate, thus hiding his passion. Now apparently, the geography of his illegal refugee saving exploits has spread, and Mr N has received a talking mynah from the Soviet Far East, which he'd been desperately trying to exchange for the birds in his collection for quite a long while.
John sighs. “All right. Hit me.” Right now, the only thing John feels is exhaustion.
Greg frowns. “What are you talking about?”
John, who's been calculating their profits after the yesterday's drop of slave prices on the Suriname black market, currently sporting spectacles on his nose, raises his head.
“You thought what?” John turns to her, surprised. “I mean, I'm sorry for being rude.”
Sherlock has such a permit for Greater London, so John isn't too worried, until... until, while sipping a beer and watching the closing credits for another rerun episode of Doctor Who (The Ninth and Rosa have successfully exposed a man who invented tiny short-wave telephones and used it as an excuse to place a net of satellite transmitters around the planet to control the population) he realises that it's almost midnight. And still no Sherlock.
He, of course, would need more if he had a family, but Sherlock is correct: with this new twist of fate the idea of a family is forgotten and buried. At times John vaguely regrets it, but it’s more out of habit. After he woke with Sherlock's weight on his good shoulder the day before yesterday, he stopped regretting it entirely. Hell, what's there even to think about? Even before they became lovers John was ready deny himself a lot for Sherlock. It's not actually about cuddles in bed for him – it's about feeling alive, the askance looks, the crooked grins over a laptop that make John's heart stop and feel wonder as if on the first day of creation.
“What do you mean - was this planned?” John looks at the ceiling and frowns.  “I thought… it was just an unfortunate circumstance…”
His reward is an almost inaudible relieved sigh and a barely there smile. John even seems to stagger a bit.
“I…” Sherlock apparently had some decency to look slightly guilty. “I’m afraid that I have been, so to say, putting certain ideas into your head, John. All this time… It was one of the two distracting manoeuvres.
“Lie down.” His voice sounds hoarse - it’s difficult to make his vocal cords work.
His expression seems calm, but with a dark, boiling pleasure Sherlock sees that John is starting to get worked up. John doesn't even feel guilty, does he? And snapping too!
Finally they stand. The man helps his companion into a coat and they walk through the door discussing the game. The attendant opens the cage and the girl rushes after them, waving Sherlock her goodbye. They get into an Audi – like the one Mycroft used to have, no more nor less, but blue – and speed off. Couldn't they have let her sit in a car while entertaining themselves?
“I killed a guy once during an arrest. No one found out and nobody would ever. It was... five years ago now and Mycroft never once asked anything of me. Even helped me with the hospital for my daughter.”
On his way out, Greg habitually grabbed a coffee from the stall, Sherlock, of course, didn't, and now Greg has no idea what to do with the cup. It warms his fingers quite comfortably though, so Greg's not really motivated to abandon it.
If you are one of those readers that subscribed aeons ago, I'm sorry it took so long!
John was supposed to explode, run out of the flat (the most probable), punch him (much less probable), lose his composure and get hysterical (probability of almost zero). Instead, John does the most improbable. He acts as if Sherlock has hit close, but not the weakest spot, as if it were a usual altercation between two idiots with two lumps of ordinary, boring brain matter in their skulls, and Sherlock has been flailing around blind.
“Too bad,” Morstan says simply. “But you do understand that I'm going to squeeze every last drop out of you?”
“About the dryness. There's a water pitcher on that table over there. Drink. I don't think it was the truth serum.
“Yes?” Morstan seems almost surprised, as both men turn to Sherlock.
