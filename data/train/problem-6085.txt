Tony looked out his peripheral vision and squinted, refusing to fully look at the man lying beside him, who was currently without a shirt and probably just as uncomfortable as he was. Tony was even more annoyed at the fact that his preferred sleeping position had his back towards the door; staring at Steve’s perfectly sculpted back muscles until he fell asleep wasn’t at the top of his to do list, especially when the inevitable boner situation was  sure a follow up. It didn’t help that it was chillier than expected, so he wanted to scoot back a bit for warmth but he didn’t want their butts to touch.
Tony pulls away first, pushing their foreheads together and smiling. He’s not sure if the smile is genuine, but Steve smiles back. Time is drawing nearer, and Tony doesn’t want to face what will be his mistake, blowing him to pieces, his miscalculation ripping him to shreds. His final regret is clutching his hand and is warm in his lap. In another life, he’d be okay with himself enough to enjoy this. In another life, he won’t be counting down each second in his head down to the last one. In another life, he’ll have a daughter named Maria, maybe a son too, a family in a suburban area; he’ll look over his past work and smile without an ounce of regret. In another life, he’ll make sure to calculate each formula over and over until his fingers bleed, the result will make sense this time. In another life, he won’t wait almost a decade.
“I take it you know what this is?”
“You did such a good job,” Steve said, always letting Tony know how wonderful he did following Steve’s lead after they messed around because Tony seemed to like it. Tony shook and nodded, thanking Steve in the most gentle way, that made Steve shiver.
Steve had found himself trying to get a rise out of Tony, pushing him and even worse, ignoring his emotional needs to see how far he could go. And hell, Tony wasn’t without fault. Matter of fact, he'd seemed to thrive on it, never hesitating to do the same, but he'd used his sharp tongue to his advantage to cut deeper.
Tony shrugged, “My thoughts and my mouth run in the same circles, which isn’t a good most of the time.”
Steve falters a bit, and shifts himself so he’s looking at Tony a bit more. “It’s nothing.”
Tony looked up for a moment, and to his surprise Steve was also just as excited below as Tony was. He still had the look of a hardened soldier, but it seemed angrier. The sides of Tony's mouth curled a bit into a smirk. “Isn't it obvious?”
“Hold on, pet.”
Steve would probably try and talk him out of it, asking Tony if he’s sure he could take his thick cock down his throat, and Tony wouldn’t
Steve crouched near him, grabbing him by his jaw and staring directly into his eyes. His gaze was normally cold, emotionless, blank, awaiting command. This look was different, it held the same coldness but his face was twisted into a sneer.
Steve had to resist the urge to shake but failed, his legs nearly buckled at the tight, slick heat around his cock which felt like relief compared to how his arousal had made him feel a lot hotter. His thrusts became fast and hard, shaking the flimsily placed picture frames the drawers leaning against the wall with each push of their bodies colliding. Steve grunted, edging on moaning from how incredibly overwhelming everything is.
Steve let out a whimper that acted as an agreement, pulling himself up off of Tony’s lap so he could be led in the right direction. Tony’s room was less extravagant than Steve would have thought, matter of fact, it was quite simple. Sharp lines, dark shades with hints of warm colors to tie everything in. The place looked untouched, as if Tony didn’t spend much time in, it if any at all. In retrospect, it made sense to Steve. Stark was a busy man.
“What do you think the Steves are saying about us?” Asked Anthony.
“Bucky.” Stated the other brunet with longer hair.
“Are you done?”
He’s not sure why Tony's complied to his demand. He hadn't argued, and he looks downright eager, awaiting further commands. Steve sits back in his chair, but swivels it towards the man currently in his black boxers and nothing else.
A dark chuckle left Steve as he pulled up. Tony could hear the cap of a bottle of lube being popped open, followed by a teasing a finger at his entrance. Steve ran his finger around in a circle, and Tony squirmed and tried to get more stimulation, begging shamelessly until he was breached.
He’d later contemplate the desperation of this plan but for now he had to get ready for a early afternoon meeting.
One thing was for sure- he was turned on.
“I like art, and I like your art,” Tony said simply, as if that were a perfect justification. Steve was right- he did look obviously uncomfortable.
“I’m pretty sure he’s a bit taller than six feet, blond, blue eyes, muscular, because he just got out the army not too long ago. If I were you, I’d be jealous.” God he sounded so catty, which was typical when they got together.
Tony thought for a second, then remembered that Steve had asked how does sex felt for him. If Tony were being honest, he did think about it a few times. Sex for him had always been for instant gratification. It was a form of release or a coping mechanism, a pleasurable distraction that was sweaty and quick and only mattered if an orgasm was involved. That was sex to him, and considering that Tony was an impatient man, that would probably always be sex to him.
“You don’t have to do that.”
Steve pauses for a moment. “Now, suck my cock,” he says, and Tony complies eagerly, getting his pants unbuttoned and letting out a small sound when Steve’s cock pops out of his boxers. Steve feels Tony’s mouth hit the head of his cock, so warm and wet and everything he needs to satisfy the red hot lust running through his veins.
“You like this.”
Tony did so without hesitation, nearly gasping when Steve pulled him into a kiss. It was more than anticipation. Every chance to taste Steve’s lips was like a breath of fresh air. His hands reached up to either side of Steve’s face, their rhythm in sync. Tony wanted to be frantic about it, but Steve refused him. Forcing them into something slow, tasting just enough to set Tony’s nerve endings on fire.
“What’s taking you so damn long? I don’t have all day.” Not true at all, Steve's willing to wait for as long as Tony needs to primp himself, not that he thinks Tony needs it. Really, he prefers it if Tony just came out naked.
Steve has found the perfect pet.
The briefing is just that, brief. Schematics on their next upcoming mission. Another perfect distraction for Steve. He keeps avoiding eye contact with Tony, feeling guilt ebb at him a bit, but also not feeling guilty at all. Still, being conflicted alone makes him want to avoid all contact. Tony looks crisp as usual, although the bags underneath his eyes tell a different story. After the meeting Steve makes his way towards the door, the mission doesn’t start for another few days so he, again, has time to kill.
Steve turned on his side, eyebrow raised and a look of amusement plastered on his features. “Alright.”
“It’s a bit complicated. I guess sorta?” Tony replied, scratching the back of his head nervously.
Deft fingers were shaking as he pulled down Steve’s zipper, as if this was his first tango with a dick in his mouth. The thing is, it was his first time blowing
Tony didn’t usually enjoy anyone else’s place but his own, but Steve’s living quarters were different. He lived in a small loft. A room separator split the place in half for what he assumed was an art related side, (he could spot canvases covering the other side of the wall), and a living quarters, where he found a kitchen, a bed, and so on.
Steve had the hands of a worker, rough and worn, and strong. His touches, however, were gentle when meant to be. He took his time in some areas, near his hipbones and thighs, the hunger in his eyes evident with every swipe of his fingers.
Tony’s eyes were blown wide, and his lips were parted in a dumbfounded way. He felt humiliated and overwhelmed all at once, but he also felt a great sense of wanting. He cleared his throat. “Oh, well I’m not sure if that’s something I’d be able to do.”
He kept his eyes tightly closed; he’d sustained worse injuries, right? Just as he was beginning to brace himself for severe injury, strong arms enveloped him. Opening his eyes he saw Steve’s far too blue eyes staring down at him, a half grin sported on his stupidly handsome face.
“Sure do.” Tony said, feeling a surge of thrill instantly at the thought of how raw he’d feel afterwards.
“May I?”
“You’re in a relationship.”
Tony barely listens. Why the fuck would he see this wretched man willingly?
“They’re rules. Ten rules that we both must comply to while in this relationship. I’m a man of structure. Not everyone likes that about me, but I figured you could handle it.” Steve flipped over the sheet.
“Good morning,” said Steve against Tony’s lips.
“Next debrief, I want you to wear the whitest panties you can find, right after sticking a vibrator inside. Captain America shaking and trying to hold it together while everyone is watching, while I’m watching. Or during the next interview, camera’s on you, and you can barely say a word.”
Tony’s eyebrows rose as if on command, it was officer handsome.
“Do you want me to hurt you?”
“See you then, darling.”
Tony moans when Steve’s cock slowly pulls out of his throat-
“I’m not going to fuck you,” Steve says, because he knows.
“It’s alright, Tony.” He doesn’t want to hear how it was a mistake. He doesn’t want to hear any of that backtracking right now. It wasn’t an accident, and they both know it. Tony doesn’t say anything else, and Steve doesn’t bother to, either. Both lost in their own thoughts. Once the elevator dings Steve’s about to step off until Tony grabs his wrist, Steve raises a brow and looks back quizzically.
Steve snorts. “I don’t give a damn. Come over here and get on your knees.”
“This game is awful.”
“You’re not subtle, Tony,” Steve said, breathy and low.
“Yeah?” Steve answered in a sleep ridden voice.
drooling, even though he wiped the side of his mouth and drool so happened to be on the back of his hand. Just as the logical,
Tony grinned, teeth showing. And really, Steve was pleasantly surprised when he looked down to see Tony didn’t have on any under garments, and his work shirt was unbuttoned. His cock was half hard, which didn’t help Steve’s current growing situation below. Tony walked up to him, slow and with a slight pout on his lips.
Steve shrugged. “Luckily, I love a good challenge.” He looked around, then grabbed Tony’s hand and pulled him along. Tony nearly fell over, but followed behind, not knowing where they were headed but trusting him for some reason. Steve took him to the back of the building outside; all that could be heard was the typical New York traffic.
“Well I’m not sure how comfortable you'd feel doing that around me—“
Tony climbed out of Steve’s arms and coughed. He didn’t get a chance to see Steve’s face before he was off throwing his shield and what not.
Tony nods hastily, eyes blown wide and tears falling down his face. Why isn’t Steve here to save him yet?
“You should give me your number for trying.”
“Birds of feather, darling,” Tony responds.
“What’s so funny?”
“Rarely still means I do it.”
- and his cock twitches. His thinking is becoming hazier, and if the prospect the danger had given him any more of a high, he’d be asking to be fucked—held down and told to take it all while crying and begging for mercy. The thought is disturbing, and he’s sure lust has overtaken his features.
“On the flip side of that, you still didn’t complete the task the way I wanted you to, so you’ll still receive punishment. Know that punishment doesn’t exactly mean something bad, it’s more of a reinforcement.”
Tony didn’t know whether to quirk his lips upwards into a childish grin or spit them out sarcastically to ease the awkwardness. He chose the latter.
It doesn’t change the fact that he looks damn good in that suit.
Tony rolled his eyes, matching his exuberance. “Okay, so tell me.”
It’s only a few feet Tony would have to crawl. The chains are long enough so it’s possible, but he’s afraid of what’s next. His fingers itch to move forward. He wants to leave. And sure, he’s hanging onto to the comfort of his Steve in hopes that this is one big joke, but it’s wishful thinking.
Steve watches intently. “Full hm?”
“Just fuck me, darling. You know I hate to be teased.”
Steve pulls out his cock and closes his eyes. He can see Tony locked in this device, and mouthy. So damn talkative all the time, until Steve stuffs his fat dick into his hole. The slow stretch would be too much. “H-Hurts--” he can see Tony whining and Steve gives a satisfied grin because good. He wants it to hurt. He wouldn’t listen, just press all the way to the hilt and groan when the tight heat envelopes his cock.
After Steve deemed his hand decently tongue bathed, he pulled away and zipped up his pants. He left without another word, leaving Tony there on his knees in his come-staind slacks, and starting to feel how bruised he really was. He was still in a good headspace, and didn’t even need alcohol to ride it out. Tony sprawled himself near the wet patch that contained Tony’s saliva and Steve’s come. He closed his eyes gently and replayed the events. He didn’t know if there’ll be a next time but he could hold onto these memories for the time being, and the bruises that’ll eventually fade.
“You’re good kisser,” Steve interjected after biting Tony’s lower lip. For some reason, that felt good to hear, and it motivated him to pull at the back of Steve’s head and kiss him harder. Steve had no problem keeping up, moving his lips from Tony's own to the back of his ear, then slowly down his neck and, oh god, he was going to die. Tony was never one for neck kisses because up until now they never felt like anything, but Steve’s lips on his neck felt carefully orchestrated, as if he knew every single nerve ending that would drive him wild and used that knowledge to a fault. Steve then switched to the other side of his neck and never moved his hands below the belt, so patient and thorough and probably planning his demise.
Tony didn't exactly know when this started, or rather he did but things began to blend together as the minutes went on. It was systematic really, a build up of Tony's lack of patience and Steve's unrepentant cruelty towards him that caused it. Specifying was difficult, even though Tony was usually good with these things. Despite being an alcoholic, he could remember people, times, and events down to the most minuscule detail. He knew they had gotten into a bigger fight than usual, Tony with his scathing sarcastic remarks. He considered himself calm in situations of stress, being Iron Man and all, but Steve Rogers wasn't a typical stressor. It was almost as if he got off on making Tony uncomfortable and hurt, he had an uncanny way of knowing when Tony was offended, and what buttons to push to get him there. Which wasn’t an easy task, considering what he allowed to get to him. He didn’t make it this far in the world by being easily offended. Steve had a ruthless way with words, comments that manifested like the tiniest slivers of fiberglass under his skin. Itching and irritating, bothering him to the point of doing anything to make it stop, so he tended to lash out.
“But I am serious, Stev-- Master. I’m trying--”
“Your teammates will be here in a few minutes,” Steve says casually while buttoning up his pants.
Steve rolls his eyes, and then thinks about being alone with Tony briefly. “Fine, what time?” He doesn’t even know why he's saying yes. He knows nothing is going to happen, but for some reason he wanted to see if there’s a possibility it could.
Once Steve walked away, Tony did a little jig while staring at his palm and grinning, as if this night couldn’t get any more teenager esque. After putting Steve’s number into his phone, he sighed deeply and left the gallery.
Steve's already gone through the motions of jerking off before the briefing, but contemplates if he should try again before seeing Tony. He should probably have a clear head, but figures he’ll be alright. He's at Tony’s on time, greeted with a still business-causal brunet holding a tumbler of some booze. “Punctual as usual,” Tony says before walking off to the living room area. Steve strips his jacket, hangs it up, and sits on the couch, leading Tony to sit on the opposite end.
When Steve pulled away from his neck, he landed a kiss onto his lips again, this time no tongue and almost too innocent for the numerous sex driven thoughts Tony’s brain had been formulating. When they finally pulled apart, Tony was sure he looked a mess, his lips felt bruised in the best of ways, his suit jacket was half off of him and he knew his hair was ruined. His legs were shaking from trying not to buckle underneath him as he tried to catch his breath.
“Yeah, I know I’m right,” Anthony gently nudged his elbow into Tony’s arm; he could already see the man drawing into himself. For a moment, he was scared. Was this the road he was headed down? Anthony sees so much of himself in Tony; so much to the point where it scared him. Antonio, on the other hand, reminded him of himself if he’d given into his demons. He felt for the man, but he was too far gone.
Tony’s breathing became short, the kiss getting sloppier with each passing stroke. Heavy panting against each other’s cheeks and mouths, their tongues reached out to lick against one another's. His body shook, groaning when he felt Steve’s thumb rub over the head of his cock. The pleasure was making him so hot, and the feeling of Steve’s erection in his hand was incredible, his hand reached down to rub over his balls. Steve grunted and kissed him harder, stroking his cock faster, and after a few more strokes, he came into the blond’s hand.
Tony furrowed his brows in pretend confusion. “I think we can work something out.”
“That would imply you had the capability to do so,” Tony gasps out, letting out a sly grin when Steve grips harder.
Tony rolled his eyes playfully. No matter how long it’s been, she could always find a way to chastise him. “I’m just cutting back a bit. I missed you.”
“And yet you still won't call me by my first name. I have a few things possibly planned for us if we get dressed and ready in time.” Tony burned out his cigarette, heading inside to leave a slightly confused and still groggy Steve to follow behind.
Steve’s brows furrowed for a moment, as if he was analyzing his statement. “Did you think I was going to play a part in that distraction? Fuck you for a solid ten? Then hopefully you can stop thinking about what that question was about? That’s not what I meant when I asked you,” Steve’s hands ran across his hips, then settled there. “If we were going to have sex, it would be something to remember. We’d lick every crevice of each other’s bodies and every inch of skin, because we would want to actually feel each other. I'm not taking part in a grunting session for you to feel better about yourself afterwards. And I’m not fucking you—yet.”
“I don’t care, Tony.”
“Why do you put up with me?” Tony said after taking a healthy sip.
It was rhetorical, he assumed, considering talking was near impossible and the only thing he could let out were choked gasps. Also, the obvious point being that he probably started this-- at least the way he usually did. As he was thinking of formulating a response that would be choked and raspy and snarky, of course, that same boot struck him across the face. It was as if Steve could see the twinkle in his eye. Tony simultaneously sucked in a breathe while choking on blood that left his mouth. He could feel his teeth launch into his jaw as it connected, the hard leather splits his lip. Tony's cock was leaking at his point. He was heaving on the floor, grinning wildly as he looked up at Steve.
“I’ll fuck you when I see fit, Stark. What did I say about talking?” Steve removes his finger and slaps Tony’s ass firmly, letting go of his hair and bending him over his knee. “All you need to do is follow directions. I know you can, but you’re so damn stubborn, aren’t you?” He adds another slap to his ass, harder than the one before, making Tony cry out.
It didn’t take long before Tony was coming, some splattered onto his cheek, some against his brow, his lips, which he hastily licked up. Tony slumped and sat back, huffing and trying to catch his breath. Steve let out a happy sigh, not minding the come on his face one bit, though Tony was gracious enough to wipe it off with a wash cloth.
Tony grabs a few tissues to get the come off his face and hands as well as he can. “What are you doing tonight?” Tony asks, not so subtly asking him to come over.
As Steve removed his hand from his beautifully crafted gift from the gods Tony remembered, right, shoes, tie them. Quickly he pretended as if his mouth wasn’t just hanging open two seconds ago and tied his shoes before standing up and letting out a small
“I hope this isn’t the last time we’ll be helping each other sleep,” Steve said next to his ear, which in Tony’s half asleep state was chuckle worthy.
Tony’s grunting petered off into soft whimpers and little whines when he angled his cock just right, the dry heat settling on Steve’s already moist and clammy skin, the tinkering of his belt becoming a constant chime that occasionally sped up with Steve’s thrust. And fuck, the way Tony clenched was bringing Steve to the edge. Mentally, he had to calm himself down so he won’t come too fast.
“We should start discussing limitations before we jump into anything else. I need you to be as clear with me as possible or we can’t move forward. No matter how silly you might think they sound, you have to be honest.”
He wishes Tony wouldn’t call him that. He pulls himself up and gets dressed. Head still foggy from his session that still has something whispering in the back of his head, not enough.
He nodded, “I had a line prepared and everything,” Tony cleared his throat. "I don’t mean to be disrespectful, officer handsome, but goddamn I want, like, three of you.”
Nonetheless, he called the man,  deciding on asking when they'd meet up and forgetting that not everyone would just be up at almost 3 a.m. Still after a few rings, Steve picked up.
“So, good night then?” Asked Steve, climbing into the sheets next to Tony. He then leaned in to kiss Tony’s forehead, Tony blushed for the 50th time in the past hour, damn him.
“Yeah, I like sex, but it’s never been about how I feel. It’s just a good thing, like any other distraction. It’s good for when I need it.”
he reminded himself. Even knowing he was being watched did nothing to settle the tremors throughout his body. Matter of fact it made the intensity that much more palpable. Slowly, he managed to pry his tear soaked eyes open.
“Steve,
Tony rushed out a hand to shake. “Tony Stark—“
“Alright… I hope this doesn’t sound creepy but," Tony paused to take a short, steadying breath. "I wanted to see you again. There’s something about you and… I don’t know. The way you talked to me last time made me want to see you--not that your art isn’t something to marvel at it truly is. But I wanted to see you.” Long winded for something that could be answered with a sentence, but Tony tended to ramble under pressure.
Steve lets a satisfied grin pass his features, pushing all the way to the hilt in one smooth go, not letting Tony adjust before starting up a rough pace. He anchors one hand on Tony’s shoulder and another digging into his hip, making sure to leave purplish bruises on his immaculately well-kept skin. Tony’s mouth is moving to indicate he’s trying to form words, but he’s only moaning, both of his hands on either side of his face, his pinky finger pressed against his open mouth. He looks ruined and Steve has barely gotten started. Steve stops for a moment, pushing both of Tony’s legs up near his head to get in deeper, which makes Tony shudder and let out a sharp cry. Steve knows he’s hit the man’s prostate directly, and he keeps thrusting at that angle, enjoying the sight of Tony debauched  and utterly wrecked. He feels nails rake down his bicep, probably leaving welts, which is turns Steve on even more. Tony is drooling and grinning like a mad man, his toes curl and he’s clenching around Steve’s cock. Right then, Steve decides he wants to milk Tony dry. “Come you fucking cock hungry whore,” Steve demands, digging his fingers into Tony’s skin harder.
Tony was close to probably the most wonderful orgasm he'd ever had in his life, and then Steve removed himself entirely, leaving Tony to whimper pathetically on the floor. Steve stood up, walking off enough to get a full view of Tony. Lips parted and bloody, pupils blown, legs shaking, sucking in huge gasps as if he was trying to collect himself, so enticing. So pathetic.
“No, I am not a clone. Yes, I’m from an alternate universe. And no, I am not Captain America. It’s a pleasure to meet you too, Mr. Stark, and don’t worry, I know plenty about you.”
“What are you wearing?” He asks, which is his way of trying to get over the shock of Tony looking so damn good. It’s partially because he’s never seen a man look so sexy before. Men don’t wear lingerie, they're not supposed to look feminine and yet--
only be funny the first few seconds after seeing Steve’s erection ever so proudly tenting his sweatpants, its outline clearly visible.
Really, Tony was half hard from the notion of talking to Steve about masturbating in the same room, so it wasn’t hard to proceed with getting himself erect. Even strokes that had the bed sheets make a scratching noise. He was trying not to come off as too obvious, even though they’d agreed this was okay. Still, he felt awkward, and how could he not? They’d just got done finishing each other’s sentences about jerking off, and Steve was fucking gung ho about it. Tony hadn’t even been fully serious.
Either one would have been embarrassing enough.
The grip on his hair gets harsher, and that sends Tony off the edge. He’s coming in spurts of gasps leaving his mouth, a hand around his cock to gather the come, and his body stills for a few moments as his head begins to feel so clear. Steve’s grips falters, and Tony drops to the floor, only to have his hair pulled and head pushed back again. Come splatters on his face, and he hears Steve groaning in satisfaction. Steve almost always comes in his ass, unless he’s feeling the urge to degrade Tony more than usual.
“Oh my god, finally, are they cute?”
“No touching yourself. You’ll get touched plenty, in our next meeting.” The words were whispered next to his ear.
He could come from just this, continuous and still feeling waves of pain from the clamps on his nipples. Just when he thought he was done in, Steve brushed his fingers against Tony's prostate once, twice, then over and over and fuck if Tony thought he was a mess before, he was ridiculous now.
Quite possibly the need for someone else to take control of an aspect of his life, though he couldn’t really place his finger on it. He didn’t realize how long he’d been quiet until Steve spoke again. “You alright?”
“Look at how pretty your cock looks straining against those panties.” He said.
“Nice to meet you both. See, they told me their names, yet you still haven’t, officer handsome.”
“You—how long have you been watching?”
“I know who you are,” Steve took his hand gently, but his hands felt firm and strong. The type of hands he wanted to feel touching every part of him. Tony shook himself from those thoughts and nodded.
“How dare you treat me like one of your lackeys. I am everything this pathetic excuse for a terrorist group wants to be. I am superior, and I’m making you an offer to better yourselves, to become bigger and to spread like the disease the lesser thrive on. And you sit here and eat as if you've got a fraction of what I have to offer.” Tony doesn’t yell, but his voice raises a few levels and his face plate is removed, the look on his face reads pure disgust. Those eyes of his glowing a brilliant blue, hair a true black, and chiseled features that have Steve seeing why he’s able to woo the public.
“You must have played the pretend game a lot as a child, because you’re doing a good job of it right now.”
There are a million ways he’s wanted Steve and not one seems right—regardless, he can see himself giving in if Steve would be the one to make the first move.
“We still didn’t solve the whole being unable to sleep thing; I say we tire each other out,” Tony said, which came off a lot more of an innuendo than he’d intended.
“What time are you going home again?” Tony’s way of asking if he could stay over, and Steve wouldn’t give him a direct answer. He just shrugged in response and turned his attention to the television, hiding a smile when Tony rested his head onto his shoulder.
“Did you ever figure out the answer to my question?” Steve asked.
Many things about Tony drove him crazy, and kissing Tony was one of those things. The little moans he let out when Steve swiped his tongue against his bottom lip, the fact that he never knew where to place his hands so they ended up being everywhere: face, arms, hair, neck anywhere he could reach, really. And for Steve, it’s one of the few things in his life that’s not manual. The small tingles down his spine and floaty feeling he got in his head near overwhelming, sure he wanted some form of control by placing one hand on the back of Tony’s neck and gripping, but it was for grounding's sake. His free hand was at Tony’s face, thumb rubbing over his cheek ritualistically because Tony melted that way.
“Sex with no attachments, an exploration of some things…kinks.” The last part is said with a mischievous grin, which makes Steve scoff a bit.
“Well it is.”
Tony smiled. “Yes m’am.”
“I doubt it, told you it would work.”
“Okay fine, but my Steve became president and fucked me in the Oval Office. That's something neither of you can say.”
“Thank you, Master.”
Tony falls on his knees, catching his breath and looking up with those same glowing eyes. This time it’s malicious, and he doesn’t expect Tony to heed his demands. He’s probably repeating ‘be superior’ like a mantra in his head. Unsure. He’s unsure and curious and so beautifully confused. The excitement only heightens and his eyes are glued to the seemingly unbreakable man.
Tony’s eyes skimmed the paper. Beneath each rule in bold was a separate explanation for both the dominant and submissive. The first rule, be patient, already giving him a sense of relief and uneasiness
“Ya couldn't have just texted me? What the hell are ya doing up at 3 a.m anyways? Aren’t ya going to work in 4 hours?” Steve’s Brooklyn accent seeped into his voice, and Tony had to suppress the slew of inappropriate thoughts.
“Oh please. Your Steve is an angel compared to mine; I can’t remember when my Steve called me Tony. He alternates between an insult, and 'Stark'.”  Antonio confessed, laughing towards the end of his sentence before downing the last of his wine. Both of his counterparts eyed him skeptically; not only because he was on his fifth glass, but because his description of Steve sounded fictional. Antonio only felt a tad bit cheated. His counterparts have had chances that he never did.
Tony looks horrified by the threat; he clears his throat and, despite the obvious fear, nods his head, undressing himself and murmuring something underneath his breath about this being ridiculous. Steve doesn’t care, he’ll learn. Tony’s already half hard, and he strokes the base of his dick slowly. It doesn’t take but a few to get him fully erect. Steve watches, scrutinizing, his hand rested on his chin and watching over each crease of skin and twitch of emotion. Tony seems to be aware of himself; aware of the show he’s giving and aware of his own pleasure.
“Shut. Up.” Steve’s words are punctuated by a slap, steady yet hard, he keeps going after that, taking a pause in between each slap and wishing he could actually take a picture of the lovely marks on Tony's ass. The redness turns darker, a slight purplish color and Tony doesn’t let up with his noises, which Steve finds rather cute. He stutters and squirms to the point where Steve holds one of Tony’s hands behind his back and grips tightly.
“Calm down, Shakespeare. Not everyone has waited a decade to hold hands,” Anthony said facetiously, followed by a bark of laughter from Antonio. Tony sucked his teeth. The fact that he was the hopeless romantic out of the three of them was only slightly embarrassing.
“Relax your throat. If you work with me I’ll work with you.”
Steve went quiet, and Tony really wanted to hit himself in the head for that one. Like he’d previously stated, they weren’t on that level of comfort, and their silence was proof of that.
“If you weren’t, I’m sure you would have walked off a long time ago... or given me another ticket.” Tony said jokingly, then cringing when his phone began ringing obnoxiously.
Minutes pass, but then Tony’s suits melts off of him, liquid silver and blue lights hanging off of his skin, the garish thing is soon gone. Steve stares intently, watching tan skin flex and a body that’s surprisingly smaller than the suit, yet is still lean enough to give off the illusion of strength. Steve knows better.
Steve smiled almost sadistically, then reached a hand out to rub the side of Tony’s cheek, leaning in closely he whispered. “Since you're so eager to go by titles, I suggest you refer to me as Master. Is that clear, pet?”
“Exactly, and to be fair, it puts me to sleep too, so I might just join you. I mean hell—out at war these things were the norm. It’s not like we have to make eye contact.”
“I never asked if you believed in the afterlife,” Steve asks.
“And I thought I was a bad liar,” Tony said.
Tony has a routine, and distractions that help him cope. Some work better than others.
The imagery of him breaching Tony has him pumping faster, dropping his phone to fondle his balls while the brunet carries on moaning in the video. It’s not Tony’s voice, but he imagines he’d be just as whiny. He’d pull Tony’s cheeks apart just to watch his dick go in and cause more discomfort and then he’d pound relentlessly. Tony’s vocal, in his head, he can imagine the brunet moaning as if each sound was being pushed out of him. He’d try to wiggle his ass back, but Steve would have his hips still. Nails biting into his hip bones, bruising, he hopes. Jack hammering at an angle so the head of his cock mashed against smaller ones prostate. He’d grab his hair to force himself deeper, because Tony is an object, an object to milk Steve’s cock and do what he says when he says it.
Tony ran his thumb over the Steve's lower lip, and Steve flicked his tongue out to lick eagerly. That finger was gone in a split second, making Steve whimper at the loss. A few seconds after, Tony was pouring lube onto his fingers, coating his cock with the liquid. Tony swiftly pulled the panties off, fumbling to get them out of the heels before getting in between Steve’s legs.
“You’re incorrigible,” Steve says.
They didn't explicitly determine their respective titles, and Steve gave the impression he was in no rush. Even after dinner, the seemingly old fashioned man kissed the back of his hand and sent him on his way; it left Tony dumbfounded. Sure, he wasn’t exactly expecting chains, whips and spankings on the first day, but in the past he’s dealt with pushy doms who just turned out to be tyrants. Steve was different, as if he’d already foreseen the end result, which kept Tony interested.
A few drags later, Steve joined him on the balcony, shirtless while sporting the gray slacks he’d worn to dinner last night, that hugged him delightfully. He reached out for the pack of cigarettes, and then brushed fingers through Tony’s hair before pulling. Tony hummed lowly, letting himself be handled into a mid-morning kiss.
The officer let out a noise that could qualify for a chuckle in Tony’s book, followed up by telling him to pull out his license and registration.
“Times up. You did good,” Steve’s said, his eyes casting down to Tony’s erection then back up to his face.
“You gotta admit, Steve, that was damn smooth, I’m Sam by the way.”
“Uh huh,” Jan deadpanned.
“Car.”
Tony poured himself another fresh pot of coffee, taking a break from the stack of papers on his night stand. He read and re-read and didn’t notice how many times he did so until the digital clock next to him flashed 2:45 a.m. He had few questions, and really, he was sure they were things that he needed to ask himself.
Tony placed his glass down and stood up to greet him. “Steve, oh thank god you’re not some kinda weirdo.”
“—And oh! There’s a new art gallery opening. I wanted to buy a few paintings for you; something to brighten up that bland apartment of yours. Hmm... after that should be late lunch or even dinner, depending on if we take our time. One of my co-workers did want to sit with us, and why not charm them; we could even catch a late night film. Last Summer seems pretty raunchy but I’m curious.” Tony didn’t notice he’d said all of that on one breath until he heaved. He glanced from his feet to Steve’s unimpressed face.
in bold, red lettering. It flashed, taunting him and letting him know he had at least six more hours until dawn would save him from this form of torture.
Besides, doughnuts and coffee went well with gazing upon a great ass.
Steve cleared his throat. “I want to fuck you until you’re boneless from how hard your orgasm is, I want everyone to wonder why you’ve suddenly become less talkative and you won’t say a word, because I’m the only one who needs to know why you’re so quiet. Why you can’t stop passing me looks, and why we keep disappearing post mission—so I can teach you another lesson.”
Tony kept his eyes locked, tracing over each line with his eyes before he was interrupted by the gorgeous man himself.
Steve’s impatient, and Tony doesn’t mind. He bends over the desk like he’s physically directed to. Digging into his pockets, Tony pulls out a small bottle of lubrication, and hands it back to Steve. He can nearly hear Steve shaking his head.
Tony started with softly running a finger along his perineum, and his thigh instantly twitches as tingles licked up his spine. He could see the head of his cock peeking from the foreskin already, so he rubbed some more until he was nearly rolling his hips, letting his eyes flutter closed. Low groans left his mouth and played in his throat; they were loud enough to know he was getting into it, as if it’s a motivation factor in his own pleasure. He pressed another finger where the tip of his cock and the foreskin meet, gently in circles and the pleasure was so subtle but his toes curled.
“Jan what the hell-- no I’m-- how did you--?”
Steve huffed loud enough to ring his own ears, “Stark, you always want attention and I sure as hell won’t be the one to give it to you.”
“Yes a date thing. I go on dates sometimes.” He didn’t know why he was getting so defensive, probably because he just convinced himself he was going on a date with a man who probably didn't even remember his name.
Of course he did… didn’t he?
Tony gasped again, feeling his vision white out at the edges and a tingling sensation at his temples. He’d have an angry bruise around his neck that would last for days, turning from red to a purplish blue, then to an ugly yellow, little reminders of his insolence and need to be put in his place. Just thinking about touching over these trophies elicited a moan that came out more as a wheeze than anything.
He smells like expensive cologne mixed with whiskey, just the way Steve hates it. Nevertheless, he always looks polished. Despite the dark circles around his eyes and his exhausted state of being, he’s well put together, not that he's planning to look that way for long. He steps into the oval office like he does any other day, when his schedule isn’t flooded (or rather, when he decides some people are worth ignoring).
“P-Please.” Tony tried to get it out. It was amazing that he could even find his voice with the thick soles pressing into his adam's apple.
Christ Tony.
His heart is thumping, but that’s a given. Steve’s looking down at him, as if putting him in his place.
” The word feelings held a mocking inflection.
Steve’s cowl is tossed on the floor allowing Tony to finally feel the blond strands on his fingertips; it’s nice.
He kept the finger going at a shallow pace, not too fast or too slow, just enough so Tony'd get acclimated to the penetration.  The next finger was what always drove Tony to the brink of insanity, and really all he needed was two finger to make Tony come, but Steve was all for driving Tony over the edge. The second finger was pressed in, a scissoring motion, slow and deep. He could feel Tony’s inner walls clenching around his fingers, and although the feeling wasn’t around his cock, it still felt good.
“It’s open,” he heard Tony state.
Jan crossed her arms. “Nope, not until I meet him I’m not, which begs the question, when am I meeting Mr. army brat god.”
Steve hangs up with a grunt.
Steve picks Tony up into his arms effortlessly and places him in his lap. “I’m still hard.”
“God, I love those noises you make for me.” Steve growled directly into his ear, then moved his fingers against Tony’s entrance. “I’m going to finger you until you come.”
“I’m ready, Master.” Tony confirmed.
“Ya sound wide awake ta me, let's meet around 5, remember ta have rule number one down. Night Tony.”
Tony gasped at the touch on his sensitive skin. “Yes Master.”
“Oh really?” Asked the blond while writing something which he was sure was the ticket.
“So,” both started a bit drawn out, followed up by a laugh.
He’d arrived at the agreed place a bit earlier than the man he was supposed to meet up with,  whose name was Steve Rogers. Blond hair, blue eyes, ex-military and now a freelance artist. It was surprising to find such a gem. They talked long enough to figure both weren’t creepy fucks, and decided on a date to meet.
“I didn’t ask what you did pet, I want you to say it again.”
Tony couldn’t help but feel a little dejected; almost shrinking into himself. All he wanted was to make Steve happy. He knew Steve hated when Tony felt the need to spend in order to please him, but what other way could he express himself?
Tony looks up from whatever project he’s working on and lets out a slight smile. “So you did.”
“Bye Steve.”
A few moments of silence passed, Tony trying to close his eyes and not think about going to sleep so he could sleep. As usual, it didn’t work, so he decided to take in the décor he hadn't bothered noticing after finding out he’d be sharing his room. Everything had an old country vibe to it; wooden chairs, a small closet that housed just enough of the few items they brought along, and the modest lamp that sat atop an oak nightstand. Really, the lamp wasn’t necessary considering the amount of light that shone through the window, be it sun or moon. It almost made him want to turn and see what Steve looked like with the moonlight shining on him.
To put it lightly, he’s been curious about the dominant and submissive lifestyle for a while now. He’s never been in a properly functioning relationship, since it was so difficult to find a dom who wasn't just out to be controlling for control's sake. Needless to say, he was a curious sub, not exactly the most experienced, but has done enough research to keep himself properly informed.
“I think so,” Tony mimicked.
Steve opened the door slowly, walking in and removing the robe before shutting the door behind him. Tony had a tumbler of scotch in one hand as he sat back on the couch, sleeves rolled up, tie loosened, and eyeing Steve hungrily.
Tony’s not sure who let out a sigh first or who decided to give off bedroom eyes first, but it was an equal exchange of both. Tony didn’t touch himself. He watched as Steve grasped his erection and palmed himself. Tony dug his nails into the flesh of his hands, teeth biting into his bottom lip to keep any ridiculous sounds from leaving his mouth.
Coming back to the table that carried his box of doughnuts, he found a note. Tony’s brows furrowed as he sat, his eyes scanned over the note.
Again, completely unfair how sexy that accent made his name sound, Tony let out a cracked “G’night.” And hung up.
Both of them paused for a moment, looking at each other and then shaking their heads. “Let’s pretend like we don’t know,” said Tony.
“Hey, how was your day?” Steve answered, followed by saying he’d be right back, Tony assumed he was talking to other people.
“Five minutes isn’t enough time to fuck you like I want to. Meet me after this publicity fiasco and I’ll take care of you.”
“That’s just it Tony…I didn’t feel uncomfortable. Awkward but not uncomfortable. Actually I kind of wanted to ask more about what you meant.”
Ten minutes into the speech, Tony slams his hand onto his desk like a petulant child begging for attention. “Are you listening to me? I’m not one for repeating myself.”
“It’s no big deal; I’ve slept in worse conditions for 70 years,” Steve joked, and Tony cracked a smile.
“Anything,”
He bought more, full sets, stockings and garters, the frillier the better. Until Steve had two drawers filled to the brim of them, and a few heels in the back of his closet as well (a bit more difficult to find for his size, but nonetheless, he had about ten pairs).
“I don't exactly know--"  yeah why
“Since when?” Tony questioned, he knew damn well Steve knew what he meant.
He figured they were past the point of pretending they didn’t notice each other, so he made eye contact this time. Officer handsome let a small smile grace his lips,
“Not sure… I can’t really sleep.”
It didn’t help that he had zero self control and pressed a hand against Steve’s abs.
This wasn’t fair, Tony was smooth and suave and always had a damn come back when -- especially when -- openly flirted with. But hell, right now, he was at a loss for words again. Steve cupped his chin, moving so their lips were barely touching.
“I’ll meet you in your living quarters, wait for me there.” Steve said.
“I don’t make getting involved with the law a habit. You know, my first instinct was to flirt.”
He grew hot when Steve’s mouth ran along his inner thigh, groaning softly and lifting up his hips, Steve licked at his skin, and then bit him once. A sharp yelp left the brunet, and he was about to grasp Steve’s hair, before quickly remembering that he was told not to touch his dominant. Instead, he reached for the sheets, tugging them tightly, then tighter as his nipples were tugged on.
Steve hasn’t said anything at this point, he didn’t know if this damned him more but he didn’t know what to say. He’d wanted to see how far he could go to break Tony for so long, that he didn’t know what to do with this. Why now? What had he noticed? More importantly, why couldn’t he bring himself to say yes?
Steve moves from his current hunched over position, chin in hands to hold up his head in a way that tells of his boredom, to sitting up completely and staring at the sight of Tony. He realizes his reaction when Tony smirks and speaks
Steve gives him a look of annoyance, running a thumb over Tony’s bottom lip gently. “Open your mouth and do what I say or I’ll force it open and rip out your teeth with pliers. Do I make myself clear?”
Steve visibly relaxed, followed by him clearing his throat. “Good.”
Being face up like this, all of himself exposed was humiliating and exciting all at once. He knew the obvious tent in his pants was visible. He also knew there was a huge chance the super soldier would be disgusted, considering how conservative his views were. Steve's been in war. he could pretend as if he hadn’t had quick grunting sessions with his fellow soldiers to relieve some tension, but Tony knew better. Then again, this was far from war. It was right out of Tony's fantasies.
No answer.
“Company,” Steve repeats. His eyes are fixed on the television, not exactly paying attention.
Tony nods, trying not to think about how it feels like he's a plaything for milking come. His stomach churns from the thought, but his cock stiffens. He relaxes his throat and feels Steve’s dick slowly sliding further down. Tony sighs and breathes through his nose as Steve begins pumping down his throat in steady motions. The pace gradually grows  harder, and Steve  is gripping either side of Tony’s head to keep him in place. Tony can barely breathe, but it’s thrilling as all hell. One hand is on the guy's thigh, and he’s still shaking, but the tears don’t stream down his face anymore.
Tony grumbled and adjusted his head on the pillow, glancing at the digital alarm clock that read
After marking the event in his phone he called up Pepper. “I need you to do me a huge favor and cancel any plans I have after 5 p.m next Thursday…and possibly the next morning.”
Steve simply smirked and groped his ass while he carried him, which didn’t help with the hard on problem (he also assumed it was an accident, it had to be) then plopped him onto the bed once they were in his room.
“I like officer handsome better, but Steve works too. Still no number huh?”
Steve squinted his eyes and paused for a moment. “Gonna ignore that and kiss you so you can’t speak.”
Tony howled this time now that his breathing was somewhat back. Then another hit, and
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Tony raise a brow inquisitively. Shit.
Tony has a routine. Some parts of it are more essential than others. Jarvis would kick out whoever was a part of last night’s fling, Tony drinks out of the bottle of whatever his liquor of choice might have been for that night. Forcibly, he stumbles out of bed and throws up--chemo always leaves him nauseous--then he washes away the previous day in a long hot shower.
Steve sucks his teeth, removes his feet from the desk and scoots up a bit.
They’ve been sitting in silence for a few minutes now; Tony always pictured their last moments together differently. He’s not able to specify what he means by differently but he knows he didn’t want dead silence and blank stares. He didn’t want to look around the room he barely stays in and now have the ability to break the structure down piece by piece, come up with reasons not to like the harsh lines and linear shapes.  He didn’t want to be seduced by clear bottles with diluted liquid inscribed with lettering he could give a damn about, as long as the alcohol content is high enough to obstruct thinking. Even though the bottles are staring back he's not going to give in. His last moments of giving into his downfall would be something that’d leave his soul restless.
After grabbing some tissues and cleaning up, Tony sighed and landed his head on Steve’s chest, wondering if this was pushing things too far. Steve, however, didn’t seem to mind, matter of fact he pulled Tony in gently.
“Get on the desk, lie on your back,” Steve tsk’s lightly, the lack of lubrication being a huge problem until a coy Tony Stark clears his throat rather loudly, showcasing a small packet.
Tony could feel his face heating up, followed by pangs of insecurity tugging in the pit of his stomach. “Yeah, right.” He liked Anthony. The man was optimistic and bright eyed. He didn’t share the dullness that he’d adapted over the years or the permanently vacant look  Antonio tried to cover up with jests and alcohol.
3. Tony really had to learn how not to get his suit pulled apart from his own body, especially while flying. This wasn’t the first time nor would it probably be the last if he were being honest with himself. He could feel his stomach dropping as he fell from the sky, wind whipping against his skin and face, he was screaming now that the pavement grew all too real.
Strong hands pulling his hair, gagging around Steve’s cock, and when it’s all said and done Steve would come down his throat so that Tony'd have no choice but to swallow. The thought alone made Tony let out a choked cry, stilling his hips in the air as he came into his palm. Just in that moment, Tony pressed his fingers deeper into his mouth, nearly choking himself as drool spilled down the side of his mouth.
Tony frowned at the early morning ribbing, “It’s our second date and you bring that up?”
“Strip, get on the bed. You deserve a reward.”
Pepper shook her head. “Forget I asked, I’ll order from that burger place you like.”
It’s always a game, a game both of them are willing to play. Steve can’t deny both of them end up winning sometimes.
Before Steve can finish, he pulls Tony’s head up and off of his cock, and comes on parts of his uniform. With easy strokes, he gets out the last bit of come, then wipes his fingers onto Tony’s lips. “I want every drop of my precious come licked up.”
“Patience; To the submissive, I say this: A potential Dominant will let you know if She or He is interested in you or not. Keep in mind that your purpose as a submissive is to serve and to satisfy someone who will take into consideration the realisation of your fantasies. Don’t expect your Dominant to be able to turn on like a light switch. The timing must be right for both of you.”
He may look like Steve, he sounds like Steve but it
Steve got up and walked to the bathroom, washing his hands and then dampening a washcloth so Tony could wipe himself down. He handed Tony the washcloth and sat on the opposite end of the couch.
“Fuck—Steve!” Tony nearly shouts, trying not lose it at this point. This position has every thrust hitting so much deeper, he can nearly feel each drag in and out of his entrance. The hand at his hip quickly darts around to clamp over his mouth, and Tony takes the opportunity to moan louder.
Tony moans into the kiss, little gasps leaving him when Steve pulls his bottom lip with his teeth. Their tongues lapping against each other's and finding an easy rhythm, which gets more aggressive when Steve’s hands wander to Tony’s (way too) perky backside and gropes there. Fuck, that feels nice. It’s incentive for the brunet to kiss rougher, but Steve’s in control here. He kisses back just as hard, making Tony buck a bit and pull away, briefly whispering a soft “fuck,” and then delving in again. They kiss for another minute, mapping out each others mouths before Tony says “I have a bed, several actually.”
Steve pressed himself against the wall behind him, “Stark.” He said, licking over lips after.
Tony knew Steve wanted to act on the fact that he was achingly hard to the point of pouting like a five year old. Nonetheless, Steve smirked and looked towards the door.
Slowly, he crept his hands in his pants. He felt Steve shift beside him a few times, probably trying to get comfortable as well.
“You listen to every word I say, you can go home. And if I see you again it’ll be because you want me to.”
Laughter and chatter flowed, their order was taken and Tony went with an unusually healthy option. Jan waved her hand in protest afterwards.
, he doesn’t vocalize, but his voice is pleading in a way that implies it.
to discover. Shocked as in top five times he’s been the most turned on in his life (granted, a majority of said list consisted of things Captain America related).
“Guess you are right about
Tony stayed silent but his eyes pleaded otherwise. After getting dressed, he was making his way towards the door, but tried one more time.
Take care he thought to himself. Tony pulled away and casually opened one of his drawers, then another, a smirk playing at his lips at the sight of various organized lingerie items. Steve watched Tony take it all in, then look back at him. Their gaze was even and lust filled, broken by Tony, who walked out and shut Steve’s door.
“Tony.”
“I’d love to gaze upon how adorable this is, but yeah, shit’s still on on fire.”
Tony repeats, the grin on his face still prominent and his eyes glowing beautifully bright. It takes another few thrust to get Tony coming without touching his cock, he gasps and claws at the desk, and Steve wonders if he knows how badly he’ll be ruined. Steve pulls out his cock slowly. “Your slut hole is gaping,” Tony doesn’t respond. He looks as if he’s been fucked senseless. Too bad.
That same day, he rushed into the tower, avoiding everyone and locking himself in his room. After getting undressed, he slowly pulled on the tiny piece of fabric that constituted as undergarments, and stared at himself in the full length mirror in awe. Aesthetically, he was pleased by the look of firm muscle surrounded by something so delicate, another part of him that wasn’t thinking as artistically was turned on by his cock being strained against the material.
“No. What’s up?”
“Oh bullshit, darling. If that were the case you wouldn’t be sitting here watching Real Housewives of Atlanta with me while I go on about how trashy everyone looked on the red carpet last night.”
Egocentric, pretentious, curt, yet unsure—very unsure; this is all Steve gathers from the first five minutes with the man talking. If he’s being honest, he’s only half paying attention. The other half preoccupied with his lunch.
“Yea—Yes.”
Once he’d decided he’d tortured Tony enough, he murmured “come for me Tony.” Steve took the hand from his thigh and gripped the base of his cock, stroking and watching as Tony came a few seconds later. Groans left Tony in increments between panting and harsh breaths, his hips lifting up off the couch and toes curling, a grin so wide he wondered about the headspace Tony was currently in.
“Nothing I can think of.”
“So…what exactly did you have planned?” Steve asks, feeling himself a bit fidgety with the only important subject on his mind.
. Tony still had to get used to that, not because he didn’t like it, but coming from Steve’s lips nearly left him hazy.
“S-Steve,” Tony forces out, his heart is feels heavier; what did the other him do to make him so sought after? He wants to ask but he’s afraid of the answer.
At the tower, Steve suppressed a whine once Tony pulled away, quickly getting an idea once they were inside.
Tony swore he was
He instantly recognized it; the art style was classically American in a sense, but still much of his own—he had a feeling that if he knew Steve more he would be able to describe it better.  The first painting was of a woman, her body hunched over tightly, and ripples of muscles were apparent in her arms, her breasts were full yet relaxed against her chest in this position. Her hair was a mess of curls toppling over her face, her stomach creased and folded, and her thick thighs tapered off to strong calves and slender feet; beautiful to say the least.
“Good. You always did do a fine job following directions, Mr. Stark.” Steve pulls out one of the folding chairs against the wall and sits a few feet away from him.
“I’m not upset.” Tony said.
“Yes, Master,” Tony said.
Steve reaches over to his desk and squirts a bit more lube onto his fingers, shifting Tony's weight back a bit, so he can lubricate his cock. He then picks Tony up and pushes him down onto his cock, this time not as slow as before. Tony chokes out a sound and clutches his stomach. “S-So deep,” he manages. Steve thrusts up and Tony nearly doubles over, tearing up and trying to talk, but it comes out broken and cracked. Steve moves Tony’s hand, tracing a finger from his pelvis to his tummy then keeping eye contact with the pathetic man on his cock.
“Pat yourself on the back, darling. You found a way to shut me up.”  Tony didn’t miss a beat with his response, and it’s insulting to Steve because apparently that kiss wasn’t enough to shut him up a tiny bit.
Both of them spoke to each other in a way that was cutting and infuriating, sometimes just to hurt each other. Tony just so happened to wear his emotions as showcased trophies in display glasses while Steve had a more closed off nature. It didn’t change the fact that the only hand he wanted caressing his back carefully yet lovingly was Steve’s. And the only lips Tony wanted on his were Steve’s, languidly moving at a comfortable pace that allowed Tony to breathe albeit with some difficulty.
Saying he was annoyed was a vast understatement, not because of the bullshit speeding ticket, it was the fact that he was edging on twenty minutes late that worked his nerves. Rolling down his window he spotted the officer from rear view mirror.
“Another day?”
“You didn’t tell me you were cold.”
Tony hears the squirt of the lubrication coming out of the tube; he pushes his ass out further so Steve can get a good grip on his hips. Slowly Steve presses himself in, and Tony stiffens and moans all at once. It’s fantastic, edges of pain that mingles with pleasure, and leaves him wanting more. Before he can press his ass back to match Steve’s thrusts, Steve pulls his hair again. Tony’s back arches and his knees buckle, he grips the desk firmer, and that same grin from earlier reappears on his face.
Tony tsk’d. “That doesn’t start with the letter d, looks like you lose.”
Tony shrugged. “The only other ‘game’ that puts me to sleep is jerking off, and that’s obviously not going to happen.”
Tony jerked out of his stream of ongoing thoughts. Clearing his throat, he answered. “Yeah, sorry about that, I guess I’m just curious.”
“We’re about to step out in five minutes,” Tony took a few steps forward, they were slow and steady. Every step put emphasis on how well Tony’s suit of choice fit him.
“Positive, sir.” He could almost hear an inflection that closely resembled sarcasm from the A.I.
Really, it was more whining and whimpering, breathing harder and the most beautiful smile breaking out of his face. This was what Steve wanted to see. Drool dribble down Tony’s chin, repeating Steve’s name as his entire body shook, it took tremendous effort for Steve not to come right then and there. Steve was probably gaping at this point, fingers still working as earnestly as ever but his brain short circuiting because he knew no one ever saw Tony like this. A sense of pride washed over him and motivated him to go faster.
It’s late again, the feeling of not enough ebbing through him. Sometimes he needs a jump start, and unfortunately, porn falls into that category. Things…things that are more extreme than he’d like to admit. Bondage and submission really do it for him these days when thinks of Tony. He manages to come across a thumbnail of a brunet in a stockade. Head and arms trapped in a device that makes it so the man has no choice but to bend over and take it. An object, a dumpster for Steve to let out his frustrations. Steve trails his hands down to his sweats, feeling himself get excited already from the thumbnail alone.
I swear updates will be quicker, I have a laptop now so I can write whenever I want yay!! As always this isn't for the faint of heart. Although this chapter isn't too heavy it's still dealing with harmful themes such as not explicitly getting consent for dangerous activities. More tags are coming as I think of more crap lol. Beta'd by Morphia-writes!
He's proactive, obviously used to being in the limelight and it comes off as fake, no matter how enticing. Steve wants real emotion, but he has to bide his time. Tony throws his head back and groaned, brash and showy just like the suit he’d sported.
Tony resisted the urge to suck his teeth and repeated the assignment. He wasn’t sure what Steve meant by believing it. Was it really about that? To Tony, execution was everything, show off what he can do to impress, because he’s good at it. And now Steve wanted more than what he’s used to giving. Like he believes it; what the hell did that even mean?
Steve presses a firm hand to Tony’s shoulder, “I’m not,” Tony says, only holding the bottle of scotch but knowing he doesn’t want to spend his last few moments wallowing in even more regret. He sets the bottle down, knowing in the deep recess of his mind he wouldn’t be able to stomach it anyway, just looking at it makes him queasy.
“You sick bastard!”
“Which is?”
Ugh, he’s actually worn out. “Great,” he sarcastically replies
“Uh…no. I mean yeah…I mean no.” Way to go Steve.
It’s not enough.
“… Even if I believed in an afterlife, we both know we're not going to the same place.” Tony says in a near whisper. He looks down at Steve’s face, tense again.
“H-How long have you been standing there?”
He looked directly at Steve, unlike how he'd previously done it. His voice was steady and unyielding, and he amazed himself with just how well he’d managed to fit in this role. He’s never wanted to please anyone so badly before, and yet there he was, wanting Steve to know he could be patient with him and that he would be. That, at the end of the day, it only mattered to him if Steve was satisfied, and with the grin that slowly made its way onto Steve’s features, Tony knew he’d done well this time.
“’—Right or you could just do it here and I’ll turn on my side and pretend I don’t see it—“
He sure as hell hoped this worked, one of the last thoughts that passed his mind before drifting off to sleep on the kitchen counter. Lo and behold he was carried, but this time Tony was fully aware, eyes almost popping open as he was lifted into Steve’s arms. He resisted the urge to nuzzle into Steve’s chest, god he was so warm, being in the blond's arms felt as if he belonged there.
“You don’t say,” Anthony taunted.
“Offering my services? For a limited time only. But look, don’t make a big deal about it. You just seemed tense and antsy. You always are, but you know what I mean.”
Tony’s life was based on a structured yet cumbersome schedule, he always had to be doing something, and the moments he had to breathe he found himself never letting himself do so. There was always work that had to be done, and really, he liked it that way. Steve, however, said he was overworked and in need of rest, asking asinine questions like, did he get eight hours of sleep or did he eat regularly.
“You wanna suck my cock, Stark?” Steve’s Brooklyn accent slipped enough for Tony to hear the 'a' in his last name sound longer.
He folded up the rules and placed them back on the nightstand. Soon, he was asleep, that is after rubbing one out to the memory of Steve’s voice.
Steve waited a second, and then leaned over to get a firm hold of the back of Tony’s neck. “I’ll take any opportunity to knock you down a peg.” Which didn’t exactly answer Tony’s question; not that Steve gave a damn. He didn’t deserve an answer.
Tony listens carefully, not surprised at all by this statement, but finding certain things a lot more clear. “I’ve always wanted to marry and have kids, but after a while, I realized it would be impossible. A part of me still hoped to one day have something… good.”
When he was done teasing himself, he started in slow but firm strokes along his shaft, twisting his wrist up slightly just to give the right amount of friction. His eyes closed, and he was imaging the Steve that shocked him, telling him to get on his knees and stroke the outside of whatever fabric of choice it was that day. His strokes sped up, and sweat broke out on his brow.
“I know your conservative head can’t compute what’s going on but like I said the first time I sucked your cock, don’t think.”
“That’s disgusting,” Tony argued.
“No, Master.”
“I can’t believe you push me away when I’m trying to make you feel good, or do we have to pretend like this isn’t a part of our routine, my dear.”
“Bedroom, c’mon.” Said Tony, huffing between messy kisses.
Well, at least he was self-aware, then again that served to do nothing more than to annoy Steve more. If Tony knew this situation was absurd, why not cut the crap on TV off and stop talking about how boring Jennifer Aniston is, whoever the hell she was.
“It’s you again,” Steve said smoothly, his lips upturned into a grin. This time he was in a crisp white button down and some slacks that had Tony’s eyes lingering for more than a second.
The sound of Steve shutting and locking the door made him jump, bringing him out of his thoughts for the moment.
“Take a picture darling, I encourage you to take several.”
Tony restated the snippet, a bit more annoyed this time, what with the obvious disappointment on Steve’s face. He couldn’t understand why Steve wasn’t happy with the first iteration. This time should do it, he figured.
Steve presses the down button for the elevator. “Eight it is.” They both step on the elevator and Tony presses the button to close it. A beat of silence goes by, and Tony speaks “Look, the other day when I--”
“Talk to me,” Tony says, needing to hear something else other than the thumping of his own heart.
Suddenly, Tony needed some alone time in his bedroom. Once there, he laid back on his bed, sweatpants hiked around his ankles and hands wrapped firmly around the base of his cock. He had a set routine for jerking off, and it got him to feel exactly how he wanted to feel, but in times like these he yearned to work himself steadily to the point of an orgasm.
“The Avengers will be here soon and—“
Steve’s sex life isn’t fulfilling. Mainly because it doesn’t exist. Steve doesn’t do one night stands because he doesn’t like night clubs, or bars, or anywhere generally too loud. The few times Tony had managed to get him out, there’s been the occasional times where he got ‘lucky’. A woman pressing up against him, and Steve going with his instincts. Even after the woman sleeps or tries to sneak her way out, he’s still thinking it's not enough. He resorts to masturbation more often than not. He likes delving into those dark parts when it's late-- for some reason, the night makes him feel less filthy about his thoughts. Especially the people who pop up in them. Because while Tony introduces him to different women, countless beautiful women that he would’ve jumped at the chance to sleep with before the ice, Steve’s only watching Tony.
“I was serious about buying you more.”
“We should head over to one of the boats but, first, there’s a new French bistro that opened up, and I hear the food there is quite lovely.” Tony continued to talk as he paced the living room floor. “After the boats, we could hit a few of the shops downtown—“
in response, hips stuttering upwards, making Steve grin. They continued like this, sweat soaked skin and heat slowly weighing on them, making it harder to breathe with the already rigorous activity. It was so good, Steve could feel the pressure in his balls build because he needed to come deep into Tony’s body, and after a few more thrust, he did so. His eyelids fluttered, gripping Tony’s hips harsher and groaning.
He opted for another approach, because at the moment he just wanted Tony bent over, pretty face contorted into a mix of pleasurable emotions, and pull the soft black strands atop of his head.
Seconds turned into minutes of him staring, almost
Tony’s shaking harder again. The minutes pass, and when he hears familiar voices, his stomach finally gives up. He vomits.
Tony gasped at the touch on his sensitive skin. “Yes Master.”
Moving his hands from his mouth, he spoke. “Lookin’ good darlin’,” Steve said, drawl apparent and almost breathy. Steve’s arms were folded over his chest, but itched to wrap around a startled Tony who turned around quickly.
“Is this about what happened that night?”
“Haven’t gotten anymore tickets,  right?”
“I planned on getting some dinner with a friend of mine this evening, do you mind if we meet afterwards?”
Steve smirked, “Not today.”
It takes a few minutes but Steve is coming. He pulls out and it lands perfectly on Tony's face. Thick ropes, some lands on his lips and he tastes it eagerly.
With each passing pressure onto his hands and knees, it became harder and harder not to want to rush into sex. The buildup was wearing away the resolve he thought the rules would have placed on hold, and he wondered if Steve was suffering just as much.
“Call me.”
“Whatever, you still didn’t answer my question.”
For a few moments, Steve was lost in Tony, and he allowed himself to be. Until the kiss was over, he found his bearings and in an assertive voice he told Tony to “Lay back.” Tony did so without hesitation, leaning his head back on the armrest as Steve removed Tony’s slacks. With lube in hand he waited, watching as little tremors ran through Tony.
It’s a game to see who will give in first, and to no one's surprise, they’re about even. It’s all provocation and prodding, Steve is quick to anger and Tony is just as quick to react. Right now, however, Steve finds himself slipping at Tony’s will, and for a man who puts emphasis on the suppression of urges it’s a huge disappointment to watch where his self control ends and where Tony’s victory begins.
Soon enough, Tony got sick of his own teasing and shoved his mouth down inch by inch, his mouth becoming fuller — his fingers couldn’t even compare. Then there was the gagging, but Steve didn’t give him time to adjust. He gripped Tony’s hair and thrusted his hips, and although Tony relaxed his throat he was still a drooling mess. Still, he found himself moaning around the thick flesh, eager, so damn eager to please Steve.
“What made them end?”
“Aren’t you well versed,” Tony stated with a raise of his brow. The man’s home spoke more 'artist' than 'used to be soldier', though he could definitely sense the soldier part within his mannerisms. Steve was well spoken, and very respectful, especially when addressing someone older than him, and had a firm look seemingly engraved within his features.
Steve thrums his pen against a stack of papers, and Tony’s not sure if he’s still trying to ignore him, but it won’t work. Tony walks around the desk, one finger sliding across Steve’s shoulder blades. He leans in and pretends to scan over paper work.
“Fine, yeah its about that.” Steve’s fumbling with his fingers a lot more now, and Tony’s leg seems to be jumping in place a mile a minute. They’re both nervous.
Although Tony’s seen this specifically cut manicured grass and awe inspiring architecture that framed the property before, it felt good to be here with Steve. Surprisingly enough, the man was still in bed, on his stomach with a pillow smashed against his face. Tony slipped on a silk robe and looked around his room for the carton of cigarettes he’d carelessly tossed aside the night before. After grabbing it, he stepped out onto the balcony, reveling in the scent the water carried over in the early morning.
“It better be soon. I need to judge him for myself.” She said firmly, interrupting his worrying thoughts.
It’s hard to adjust to the rhythm, but he does it eventually. Steve’s size doesn’t make it any easier, but fuck, he’s torn between slowly getting turned on and wanting this all to be over. He hates himself for this, knowing he won’t be able to look his Steve in the eye afterwards.
Tony grins that charismatic toothy grin. “I’ll try and remember that darling. See you at eight.”
When Tony managed to pull himself out of his mashing, inappropriate thoughts, he grabbed a newspaper on his way to his car and got on his phone. In between waiting for pages to load, he rummaged through the art section, squinting at the freakishly small print and tapping his foot impatiently. He was supposed to own the most advanced tech, yet it’s taken more than twenty seconds for this page to load!  Finally, after what seemed a century, the page popped up, listing the artists that would be attending the show next Thursday at 19:00. Tony smiled to himself. In the back of his mind he knew it would come off as weird bumping into the man again, but he had to.  Something about the way their encounter had ended made him feel incomplete, yearning for Steve’s touch—or was it the way he talked so evenly and clear headed.
“Something on your mind?”
, what the hell is wrong with him.
—?” He tries but nothing comes out right.
Angling his fingers upwards and curving them slightly he brushed against Tony’s prostate, which earned him an undignified yelp.
A harsh back hand before letting him go, and it stung in the best of ways. Tony groaned into it, feeling a tight coil in his stomach that indicated
Tony grunted. “Thanks.”
“Why do you--?”
“You asked for it.”
They'd stretched for a few minutes, It felt pretty good,  his muscles flexed and then relaxed. He also definitely got to see a peek of skin between Steve’s sweatpants and apparently size extra, extra small t shirt (Tony wasn't complaining—no one's complaining). Besides Tony feeling like his lungs were being lit with a match, hacking as if he had bronchitis, and his legs nearly shaking after a pathetic two miles, everything went better than expected (and then Steve said they were doing four next week).
Speaking of which, where did it go?
Tony moaned lowly, thrusting his hips into deft fingers that gripped him with the right amount of tightness. As usual, he was trying to catch up with Steve, testing his theory about if his head was sensitive and being pleasantly surprised when Steve squirmed.
“Why don’t you fucking make me,” Tony replies, venom lacing his voice.
He swore it didn’t.
But of course, Steve was selfish and inconsiderate,  ignoring Tony’s bodily functions that included popping boners when sexy super soldiers even so much as licked their lips a certain way. So he just had to not wear underwear again around Tony. This time they were both in the kitchen, alone. Tony was getting (more) coffee and Steve was getting something that was probably adequate nourishment. Small talk was held, Tony so happened to look down, and there it was in all its glory. Those gym shorts did nothing to hide how perfect Steve’s dick curved, and made his dick look so deliciously traceable (obviously he’d trace it with his tongue).
“Hello?” Said Tony.
She paused for a moment, and then said “alright Tony. I hope it goes well.”
“Rarely.”
“Move or I’ll make you,” Steve says.
And why would Steve need a picture when he's planning on Tony wearing lingerie more often than not? Tony walks up to him slowly, his hips rocking from side to side hypnotising with each passing step and leaving Steve breathless. Tony settles on his lap, a knee on either side of him and biting his lower lip. Steve instinctively grabs a handful of his ass and massages it gently, then accenting the touch with a firm slap.
Steve had to gall to casually nod and head towards home. He had to have noticed. It wasn’t as if Tony was going to point it out, mainly because he wanted to keep staring without the awkward
Steve moved over, leisurely enough to make the small gap between them feel like yards across. Tony suddenly felt a lump in his throat that he aggressively tried to swallow, and then Steve’s lips were at his ear.
“God, you’re clumsy.”
Steve unfolded his arms, “What was the get up for, anyways?”
His mind ran rampant with confusing and conflicting thoughts. He and Steve were okay on some level, but not okay enough to share a bed and be cool with it, and hell he was still thinking about the fact that Steve had ripped that log in half with his bare hands. Shit, shit repeated like a mantra in his head as he adjusted his cock subtly.
A muffled mantra of “Fuck, fuck, fuck,” leaves him, and he’s trying to keep his head clear enough to keep his orgasm at bay. He doesn’t want to come yet;  wants Steve to keep pounding into him forever. He wants to hear Steve pant heavily and murmur curse words as the clanking of his belt gets louder with the speed of his thrust.
“Very slowly.”
“I find it quite disrespectful that you aren’t paying attention to me.”
An annoying ring from his phone interrupts the moaning and slapping of skin from the video. It also makes the haze of his orgasm quickly dissipate. Who the hell-- “Hello?” His voice is a bit gravely from his previous activity.
Steve came shortly after, saying Tony’s name as he did so, which made Tony’s cock twitch in response. Tony grabbed tissues from his nightstand and cleaned them off a bit as Steve watched him with a pleased look.
Steve rolled his eyes and rubbed the outside of Tony's entrance, he hadn’t applied lube to his fingers yet but was enjoying the soft pants that left Tony. Steve opened the lube and squirted a bit on his fingers, three to be exact. Tony was looking down, a spectator really, but not for long. Steve pushed one single finger in, and Tony reacted perfectly, head thrown back and thighs shaking soft enough to let Steve know there’s enough room to make him lose it more.
Tony nodded in agreement, though he couldn’t exactly relate to that statement, because honesty wasn’t something he’d fully considered important in intimate relationships. The majority of them were built on lies, and the idea of being together, so at the mention of being honest he wondered if he was ready to be as open as Steve probably wanted him to be.
Steve’s arms wrapped around Tony’s waist firmly, gripping the breathy fabric that was his button down, which constricted his hold enough to feel the curve of Tony’s waist.  Tony smiled, tipping his hat back to get eye level with him and then they were kissing. It started out gentle, but turned into a mess of mouths and tongues searching for one another. The harder they kissed, the thicker the air felt, and Steve could feel his clothes beginning to stick onto him. He gripped Tony’s jaw with one hand, pushing his tongue in his mouth and mapping it out before licking over the tip of Tony’s tongue.
Tony was definitely satisfied with how red the blond’s ears got during the teasing commentary. He sputtered before gathering his words.
“Tony?”
The brunet with longer hair spoke, “Is there something you’re not telling us?”
Steve grimaced. “Again.”
God his reaction was the best. Tony had the slightest tremor that went through him and Steve was fully hard by that point. Something about him showing some level of vulnerability was enough to shake Steve at his core. There was no time for the bed or for finding some accommodating place for Tony to be bent over; Steve occupied the wall just fine.
Not that Steve cares; he just wants to finish his lunch.
Steve’s gaze crossed between the anger that never left him and very obvious lust. He was palming himself now, and Tony wanted nothing more than to reach out and touch. His body was screaming with the aches, but that didn’t stop him from trying to lift up and just reach-- just touch or taste or anything Steve might allow him to do. Steve, however, was not one without cruelty, and gave him a gruff “No.” He did, however, pull his cock out, and Tony was just far gone enough to express his gratitude “Jesus..” he groaned, seeing that monster for the first time. Uncut, thick and long enough to rival his favorite dildos, the tip an angry red, almost purple at this point, and leaking the tiniest bit of pre come. Steve gathered some of it onto his thumb. He pressed a leather clad hand to Tony's face, his thumb grazing his lower lip. Tony sucked eagerly at the digit, shameless.
“I’ll be sure to keep you updated on my misfortunate dating adventures.” He’d probably have to keep his self-deprecation in check when meeting Steve again. The man seemed as if he had a sort of comforting confidence, as if he knew himself enough to express himself through lines and canvas. Tony hung up, suddenly feeling a sense of dread about their next meeting.
He’s obsessed with reconstructing the world in his image, and really, isn’t everyone trying to do that. He knows the guy is a genius, and as with all geniuses and inventors, he'll find his downfall by the hands of his own creations. Tony is doomed to fail in his motivations.
“Don’t get all defensive,” Tony said while raising his hands in mock surrender, a grin now plastered on his face. “Just looking out for a pal. Women get boring for me at times, hell people in general, sometimes you just need to feel something different. Something more.”
“Don’t play dumb with me, Steve. It’s not a cute look on you.”
Steve chuckled. “Very good, bye Tony.”
“Because my dick chaffs without it. Be logical here, Stark.” Steve pours just enough onto his cock to make himself slick. After stroking his cock a few times--it doesn’t take him long to get hard again--he’s gripping Tony’s thigh with one hand and guiding his cock in with the other. He enters slowly, teasingly, to give off a false sense of security, but it’s also to see Tony’s face contort into an array of emotions. He looks beautifully overwhelmed, breathing heavily and digging his nails into the wooden desk.
They were on the couch, Tony was going on about something that Steve didn’t even pretend to care about. Sure, Steve was in denial about a lot, one of those things being that just because they so happened to be in each other’s faces nearly every day outside of work didn’t mean they were dating, and just because he so happened to put up with the things he hated most about Tony didn’t mean anything either.
“Well pick one, because it's the only decision you’ll get to make tonight.” The words are whispered next to Tony’s ear, low and dark. Tony visibly shivers, then looks up in awe, as if he didn’t know Steve had it in him. Frankly speaking, they know nothing of each other besides the small moments they share. Who knows, Tony might surprise him tonight, too.
“What?” Tony dragged out, “you don’t miss me? I’m hurt.” He clutched his heart, accompanied by sniffling, which led her to roll her eyes.
“Well I’m sorry, for someone who I thought lived on photosynthesis and coffee, this is just new. Are you dating?”
“Aye, aye Cap’n.”
Between four to five pots of coffee a day, and large stacks of paper, sometimes those basic necessities got away from him. Steve made him a schedule of when he should be eating, three times a day (do people seriously do that?) and cutting everything off at 11:30 p.m, or at the latest, midnight (unless something else demands his attention i.e a function or, well, Steve).The schedule covered breaks in between grueling papers (five to ten minutes), beside the times where he should be eating ‘try to eat a vegetable’ was highlighted, which made Tony frown; lettuce on a burger totally counted as a vegetable.
The brunet sipped on his glass of red wine, eyeing his watch when a smooth voice spoke his name. “Tony?”
Steve’s life is fulfilling in his own sensible way of keeping things on the back burner until he can organize it mentally. He saves the day, and hopes the rest of it spent alone goes by quickly so he can distract himself by saving it again. He says it's enough, and it should be. But there's something else. Something on that back burner that boils over every once in a while. Something that glaringly falls under not enough that reaches the darkest recesses of his mind late at night. Something he feels dirty about it, even mid way through choked gasps and rustling underneath the covers-- all that reminds him of what it truly means to feel something is not enough.
They stopped kissing. Steve’s head is in Tony’s lap and they’re silent again. Tony gapes his mouth open to say words, but the only thing he can think of is relaying how much time they have.  It’s funny, he’s been faced with death so many times, but never has he felt so useless. He always has a way out, and this time… this time, destruction is inevitable.
Again, the word honest was spoken, and Tony nearly tensed at that question. What exactly were his limitations? It took him a minute to think it over a bit before coming up with something that did make him slightly nervous.
Steve says nothing, his hand travels up the back of Tony’s neck and to his hair, then he pulls, gradually making his hold tighter and pulling until he hears Tony gasp. They still hold some form of eye contact, Steve looking down at Tony as if he’s his superior, and Tony looking through a sheet of long eye lashes.
Subsequently, the following morning Steve shot him a text about lunch, and Tony agreed. That afternoon, they met at a small family owned place. Steve had a piece of paper lying face down beside him the entire time. Tony found his eyes wandering to the sheet during their light chatter, until finally he asked. “You’re going to make me keep staring, aren’t you?”
“Good night Tony.”
“Fuck!” Tony called out, his head flying back and hitting the floor with a thud. Steve was nearly crushing his dick with his super soldier fucking knee, and Tony was enjoying every second of it. Tears began to form in the corners of his eyes, he couldn't stop them from streaking down his cheeks.
“Don’t look so proud of yourself honey. You know how worked up I get,” Tony says defensively. Steve doesn’t reply, instead he grabs at Tony’s chin and kisses him, ignoring the fact that Tony had just swallowed a load of his come. He can taste himself and it’s filthy, but so damn good. Their tongues lap against one another's, playful but intent. He feels his cock growing hard again, just from thinking about how he’s stooped so low for a man willing to stoop lower than low. When he pulls away Tony looks as if he’s not done yet, his eyes blown with lust, hair disheveled (because of Steve’s rough-handling) and biting his lower lip deliberately to get a rise out of him.
Tony chuckled, almost cunningly, “I knew you’d like that idea, but you wouldn’t be allowed to come, not until I'd get my hands on you and fuck you. Those panties would be soaked through by then, huh?”
Steve nodded stiffly, curiosity outweighing the nervousness, and the hand to his crotch gave him all the answers he needed. The blond gasped, arching into Tony’s palm and hoping to god he wouldn’t stop.
Tony peeled off his now soaked work shirt, and walked over to the bathroom. “Then you best get over here,” he said over his shoulder, echoing his words from earlier.
It wasn’t as if they could sneak in kisses or hold hands in public, and it was easier to do things like vacations and label it as “business”. People bought it like they buy everything the media spouts out on television sets and glossy magazine pictures that advertise the latest fashion trend on the very next page.
Steve rolled his eyes exuberantly. “Any other games?”
Their lips touched again, sloppier this time, all while Tony made sure to stroke his cock. Light strokes, but firm enough to send Steve near the edge and pull him back as soon as he tensed up.
Steve swivels in his chair to face him. He swiftly reaches out to grab a handful of Tony’s hair and tugs—hard. Tony groans, a wide toothy grin on his face and his eyes closed. “Such a romantic,” he jokes while getting on his knees. Steve grabs both sides of Tony’s face with one hand and keeps his fingers locked into his hair. Their lips meet briefly before teeth and tongue take over, it’s barely a kiss and more of a mash of mouths fighting for anything but intimacy.
“You’ve got to be good for me and take it. Don’t you want to be good for me?” It comes out smoother than Steve expects. He'd felt himself wanting to stutter the obscene words, it’s slightly embarrassing how often he’s said things similar to that and how filthy he still feels. Tony’s reaction is even filthier
It works out that way. Tony’s not sure what he’d do if Steve felt anything but disdain towards him, and Steve wouldn’t be caught dead like this. It only works out as long as Tony’s in denial. He can rationalize anything, from drinking to dying; he finds an excuse. The thing about love is, it isn’t an excuse, it’s a human condition, something that can only be warded off but not for  long. It’s inevitable like death, but he finds love to be a more severe condition.
“Want me to—“ Steve started but Tony interrupted.
The bed gently creaked as Steve sat up. “Could you please stop mumbling.”
“Officer handsome?” Bucky asked, passing a look to Sam.
“You’re disgusting.”
“JARVIS, who carried me up here last night?” Tony asked while getting undressed.
It was short, however, being placed down into his sheets. He was on the verge of whimpering, but didn’t want to blow his cover. Steve proceeded to tuck him in, then walked out. Tony waited a moment before getting up and throwing his clothes off, slightly annoyed at himself for being  too afraid to share any acts of intimacy outside of, well, sleeping.
“No!--I mean no, Steve that's-- it's fine. So you want this?”
Besides, time for dinner meant more time catching up with those same friends he’d been neglecting due to working himself into oblivion. Not that they hadn’t already noticed something different. First, it was Pepper, who’d come in and asked routinely ‘Should I get someone to bring up lunch for you, Mr Stark?’
Tony immediately got on his knees. The thick canvas fabric of Steve’s pants didn’t allow as much detail to come across as gym shorts or sweatpants did, but it was still obvious Steve wasn't wearing underwear once again. He darted out his tongue, licking the outline of Steve’s cock, then sucking along the fabric just to feel the thickness tease his mouth, to confirm it’ll be so much bigger than he can handle.
Tony didn’t bother to sit up, figuring that since Steve didn’t do so, he should wait on some invitation.
Steve jumped at the sound, and saw Tony, a smug smile set on his face, leaning up against the door frame.
They were stroking in unison, both of them sharing the same look of lust and disbelief. “You’ve gotten my cock nice and wet from choking on it. I lift you and hold you against the wall, pushing myself in and watching your reaction get more and more incredible.”
“You all haven’t even kissed yet?” Tony asked, cocking a brow in slight amazement.
Steve thinks for a minute while holding the elevator door open. “No, just make sure you’re there.”
The blond huffed, “Steve. Please call me Steve.”
he just text "-- you see I was having trouble sleeping--”
“Lie back, look at the ceiling.”
“Yeah…but like you said, nothing serious, alright?” He means it too, he has no interest in Tony in that way and he doubts he ever would. He just could use a helping hand besides his own in the bedroom. And for some reason, he wants Tony on the receiving end. Steve’s not in the business of propositioning any man for sex, but Tony’s not just any man.
“Alright he’s hot as hell, which, obviously you’d expect nothing less from me.”
They headed out at around 8:30. Tony shot a text to Steve, stating that he was on his way. Not too long later, he arrived at Steve’s living quarters. Unconsciously, he rushed to the door and knocked with haste.
Anthony snorted. “Kiss? We barely even utter a word to each other, which is completely fine with me. He’s so damn difficult, set in his ways. I don’t know how you all do it,” he let out an exasperated sigh. Tony’s surprise said a lot about how new he was to just about everything. Hell, even Antonio gave him a quizzical look.
“You think so...” his voice dragged a bit as he traced over the armrest of a leather chair with the tips of his fingers. He then sat in the chair, and Tony didn’t notice since he was still taking in everything.
Steve smirked. “Please what?” he asked, pressing against his prostate once more, watching as pre come oozed out the tip of his cock.
He’d been able to remember the first rule the first time he drilled himself on it that evening. To put it bluntly, he was a bit smug about it. Sure, Steve has had his fair share of submissives, but were they all as intelligent as him? Probably not. He smiled to himself, but quickly remembered he had to review the other nine rules.
They make full on eye contact this time, Steve’s jaw tenses a bit more.
“Lying might work when you’re doing it to yourself, but it won’t work on me. Why are you really here?”
Antonio whined. “That’s no fun. I came all this way to not get a blow job from another me?”
A server came to take their order, and then conversation resumed.
“Tell me more,” Tony whispered, taking short breaths and trying to hold back the moans caught in his throat as Steve took a hold of his cock.
Tony furrowed his eyebrows, he could feel his cheeks heat up--  that had to be bullshit.
“I… think so.” Tony let out another long sigh and put his hands to his hips. “Darling, what is it?”
“I’m close.” Tony groans.
“For as long as you keep this up, I’ll keep pushing, darling.” It didn't come out as smooth as Tony would have liked it. His throat held a dull ache that turned sharp with every deep breath he took.
Tony nods slowly, and then whines when Steve lifts him and pulls him off of his cock. “If your legs aren’t going to stay open, you can leave.” Tony is still trembling; come drips down his thigh and his eyes rimmed red, yet his eyelids hang low. He gets on top of the desk and spreads his legs, pushing two fingers into his come filled hole. Slowly he pulls them out then licks over them seductively; his eyes flutter up to Steve’s. It’s filthy, a display of someone wanting to be treated like they’re worthless.
“Were you asleep?” Of course it’s Tony.
“Right now just do what I say,” he finishes by grabbing a patch of hair in the back of Tony's head and pulling him up. Tony gasps but leans into it, his lips finding Steve’s. The bigger man snakes a hand around Tony's waist, thrusting his tongue into his mouth. Already he can feel the need to take Tony bubbling up on the surface, the shroud closing in on his lust addled brain.
Steve’s boots scuffed the wood flooring, then tapped a few times before he called out again “Tony, have ya seen my hat?” Still no answer, Steve’s brows furrowed in confusion. Pulling himself up, he walked at an even pace towards the bathroom, his voice carrying along the way “Th’ hell didja do? Fall in?”
Tony talked more than he probably thought he did, and hell, even the subtle smugness he seemingly carried along with him everywhere like he did an expensive watch drove him mad.  However, it usually didn’t take much to get Tony trembling, no matter how stubborn, he always fell pliant with so much as a touch to his lower back. He’d fall quiet, waiting for Steve’s next move, and most times, Steve wouldn’t have a next move, it was just satisfying to see him so wanting.
—and in uniform, no less. After this he could die happy, guaranteed. Once Steve’s pants were unzipped, Tony was finally met with his very hard cock. Uncut like he suspected, the foreskin pulled all the way back, and the tip dribbled a bit of precome.
“How many pots of coffee?”
Tony took a drag from his cigarette. “I could help with that you know…the different thing. Doesn’t have to be anything serious.”
Steve fits his fingers to the already blooming bruises on his hips and fucks him harder, making sure every thrust has him in a frenzy. He can feel himself getting close, but he knows he can hold out long enough to get Tony to come on his cock again.  Steve moves his grip down towards Tony’s thighs with one hand, the other smacks Tony’s ass harshly a few times just to tip him over the edge. Tony reaches down and strokes his cock, coming into his clenched fist and holding himself up as Steve keeps fucking into him. Steve’s muscles tense, his brain feels as if it’s melting from how hot and how hard he’s coming, filling Tony up. Tony stills himself and grips the arm of the chair, then slouches and rubs over his tummy once again.
It’s the little things that make Steve lash out and give Tony what he wants. The way he’s kept so manicured and pretty, like the most elegant piece of blown glass but resilient like the heroic title he so desperately clings to.
