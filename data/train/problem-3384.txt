“Dean and I can direct you to where the wards are painted.  A line of paint through each of the wards should suffice,” Cas explained.  With that, Sam and Garth dug out cans of spray paint from their bags.  Trying to tell Sam and Garth were to paint from a distance wasn’t as easy as Dean had expected, and took at least a half hour.  After the last ward on the outside of the building was finally broken, everyone looked to Cas expectantly.
"So you think that this might be related to whatever is trying to kill me?" Dean asked.
“Hey Garth,” Dean replied with a weak smile after Garth let go.
Dean could really get used to waking up to Cas grooming his feathers.  Dean hummed and leaned his wings into the touch.
The feeling of compression surrounded Dean, but he was inching forward so he pushed on, fueled by the first whimper Sam made as the demon cut into him.  Agonizing pain started flaring up in every inch of Dean’s body, but he didn’t stop.  Every step forward got harder and harder to make the closer he got to the ward.  His muscles screamed at him from the strain.  Every step felt heavy, so heavy.  Still Dean pushed forward.
“Right – ‘cause a guy in his 30s running around town in a backpack is not weird at all,” Sam deadpanned.  Leave it to Sam to not appreciate the sheer awesomeness of his idea.
"Free Pie!*  Today only while supplies last!
"This tie into whatever Heaven wants him for?" Bobby asked warily.
"Cas? As in the angel who saved you from Hell?" Sam asked, lowering his shotgun and staring at Cas in awe. "I thought you said he was a giant made of light?" Dean picked up on the unspoken question of how had he recognized Cas in this new form, but didn't think the answer of 'he feels like Cas' would win him any points.
“...Dean…  Dean…  DEAN!” apparently Sam had been trying to get their attention, but his words barely registered to Cas while he was under the onslaught of Dean kisses.  Dean had pulled away from Cas’ lips and was now placing tender kisses all over Cas’ neck, making Cas melt even more.
Shit.  Even without her saying a word, Dean had a horrible feeling that he knew what the problem was.  Just as he could sense angel Grace in her, she could probably sense the little bit of angel Grace that he’d gotten from Cas.  Cas had said that their Profound Bond was forbidden.  Other angels might even kill him for it.
"Just a salad for me, thanks," Sam added with an exaggerated eye roll towards Dean.
Dean really hoped that he wasn't about to crash into a magical protective barrier surrounding the beanstalk, or the beanstalk itself.  He held his breath, and tried to trust his wings to guide him in the landing.  Fortunately they didn't crash.  Dean felt a tingle when he passed through the barrier this time, but it didn’t prevent him from passing through.  Dean's wings guided them into a brief hover close enough that Cas could reach out and pull them back to the beanstalk.  They were safe.  A few tears of relief slipped down Dean's cheeks.  It was probably going to be a few moments before Sam was ready to let go of Dean and grab onto the beanstalk again instead.  Sam was still shaking in Dean’s arms, and clung to Dean with a white knuckled grip.  But it was the look in Cas' eyes that nearly broke Dean.
"I'll take your free pie!" Dean replied eagerly.
Dean may have passed all the tests Bobby threw at him yesterday, but he probably couldn't do so again now. Humans didn't have wings. Was this some kind of residue from his time in Hell? (Not that they even remotely resembled anything in Hell – rather the opposite – but they were very clearly supernatural and not human.) They reminded him of Cas' wings, but Dean quickly dismissed that thought. There was no way that someone as tainted as Dean could ever have anything in common with an angel.
“There are no demons nearby, but wait until I finish healing Dean’s wings.  You have limited batteries,” Cas replied, oblivious to the new realization that Dean was experiencing.  As his wings slowly healed, Dean felt like the cave came more into focus.  Maybe that was part of why Cas insisted on wing-care before battle – he was partially blind with injured wings.
“Cas, stop,” Dean said, gently pulling the dusty old books Cas was reading away from him.  Cas looked like he was going to protest until he saw the look in Dean’s eyes (and probably whatever his wings were expressing, too).  Dean took a deep breath and did one of the things that he always struggled with – opening up about his feelings.  But Cas was worth it.
“How…?” Dean stuttered.
"So you are able to see everything like that all the time?" Dean asked.
"Congratulations – 24 minutes and 16 seconds is our new record!" the waiter told him.  Oh yeah, delicious free pie was totally worth the enormous stomachache that Dean now had.  It was hard to stand up afterwards, and Dean kind of wanted to pass out in the backseat and let Sam drive now, but it was totally worth it.
"Help!" Dean tried calling weakly, hoping that if Sam was on the surface he could hear him. Dean was going to tear his idiot brother a new one for whatever he did to bring Dean back, since there was no way he could have done it without some horrible strings attached.
“Cas…,” Dean began, not sure how to put his reaction into words.  Here Cas was ready to fight – and maybe even die – just to protect him from going back to Hell.  Dean was no good at chick flick moments.  Luckily words didn’t seem necessary here.  Cas met his gaze, and everything Cas was feeling showed in his eyes – protective, loving, adoring.  Even though they had only known each other a short time, Dean clearly already meant the world to Cas, and Cas was willing to do anything for him.  It was mutual.  Dean realized that he felt the same way about Cas.  He would fight, and even die again if it came to that, in order to protect Cas too.  Dean felt like he was only just beginning to understand just how much Cas meant to him, but he wanted them both to survive long enough for him to find out.
“Stop!  It’s…,” Cas tried to warn them, but it was too late.  A solid wall suddenly dropped from the ceiling behind them.  It was covered in angel sigils too.  They were trapped.  Then before they could regroup and get Sam to break the other sigils, a gas was sprayed right at them.  Dean choked and felt himself starting to lose consciousness.  Even worse – the last thing Dean saw was not only Sam being affected by the gas, but also Cas.  What the hell could knock out an angel?
<I will be back.>
"I'm fine Sammy," Dean lied, hopefully convincingly. He was having a hard time keeping his voice normal when he was majorly freaking out here.
“Wouldn’t that be a good way to mask demon sulfur with natural sulfur?  Let’s try that way first,” Dean suggested.  He sighed as he crumbled up the his last empty food wrapper and shoved it into the bottom of his pack with the others.  Cas, always one for noticing every little thing that Dean did, immediately started digging in his own pack for something.
“Cas!” Dean called, which made Cas slow down slightly so that Dean had a chance of keeping pace.  After a minute or two they rounded a corner and came across a man-made structure built into the side of a cliff face.  It was covered in neon blue symbols that almost seemed to glow in the sunlight.
“Cas?” Sam questioned.
"It's me, Sammy. It's really me," Dean assured him. The next moment, Dean had his arms full of sasquatch. Dean hugged his brother back tightly as hot wet tears started landing on Dean's back. Dean was probably tearing up a bit too. He thought that he'd never be able to see Sam again. Dean wished he would never have to let go of Sam ever again.
“The blade of the Righteous Man is foretold to be able to do the trick,” Gabriel assured him.  Dean mouthed back the words ‘Righteous Man’ in complete bewilderment at how such a term could possibly refer to him, but Gabriel merely waved him off and refused to elaborate.
“What the hell was that?” Dean asked, but Cas didn’t even seem to hear him.  Instead, Cas was wide eyed with shock.  “Cas – hey!  You okay?  What the hell happened?  Cas!”
“No, and whatever he’s doing is making my wings itch,” Dean grumbled, trying to use the back of his chair to relieve his itch.
Dean tried to protest, fearing for Cas' safety, but his body was not cooperating.  It was taking all the willpower he had just to keep his eyes open.  A fierce battle was waging right in front of him, and Dean kept missing parts of it because sleep kept threatening to overtake him.  Dean didn't even jump when there was suddenly a loud crack right behind him.
Without even thinking about it, Dean’s squirrel face leaned in the final two inches to reach Cas, and started licking Cas’ face.  When he realized what he was doing, Dean startled and tried to pull away, but Cas just pulled him closer.  Cas let emotions of love and adoration flow into Dean.  It only took Dean a moment to get with the program and turn so that his human mouth could meet Cas’ eager lips.  The angel was clearly very inexperienced with kissing, but he made up for it with enthusiasm.  Dean moaned in pleasure once Cas figured out how much Dean liked it when Cas licked his way into Dean’s mouth.  He could have sworn that Cas actually started purring once Dean’s fingers found their way to Cas’ hair.
☆ ★ ☆
"R-reconstructed? Humans don't have wings!" Dean exclaimed, hardly believing what he was hearing. Dean had ended up with wings because an angel had flunked human biology 101. Fan freakin' tastic. To top it off, Cas was still acting more confused than surprised or apologetic.
“Look – we’re not going anywhere until everyone keeps their hands and wings to themselves,” Sam proclaimed.  Cas pulled his wings away, lifting them out of Dean’s reach.  Dean sighed.
"Now, maybe, but earlier I had super hearing for a while, and well, uh, wings," Dean admitted, still having trouble believing that all of that had really happened.
Dean definitely understood that.  Somehow Dean’s eyes got even bigger as he realized what Cas was saying.  Cas had never seen those emerald eyes sparkle with that much hope and love and everything else that Dean had been keeping inside himself, just like Cas had been.  In a blur of movement, Dean was suddenly right up in Cas’ “personal space” and clashing their lips together.
“You idiot,” Cas said far too fondly for the words to have any venom.  “Don’t try to talk.  You nearly killed yourself.  You shouldn’t have even known how to do that.”
Dean was now very sure that the clouds signified the top of the beanstalk, because he could see the clouds shake from what sounded like a giant walking on top of them.  Everyone froze in place, not daring to make a sound.  But after a few more thuds, everything grew quiet.  Was the giant gone?  Sam must have thought so, because Sam started to carefully climb again...
"Then how do I keep them from manifesting?" Dean asked.
“You can see the angel warding?” Cas asked, not sounding particularly surprised anymore.
"I have been told that your time in Hell was no accident. Events were manipulated by the forces of Hell for some nefarious purposes. My garrison was sent to retrieve you in order to disrupt Lilith's scheme. Now that you have been successfully returned to the mortal plane, my orders are to assist you in capturing Lilith," Cas explained. Dean's head spun. Why would both Heaven and Hell be fighting over someone as insignificant as him?
“I… can’t get near it either,” Dean reluctantly admitted.  It sucked to have to say it out loud, almost like that made it more real than it already was.
"So you're saying that you're special among angels," Dean commented.
"This? This is a vessel," Cas replied, looking down at his vessel like it was a strange and alien thing.
“Spoil sport,” Dean mumbled, frustrated at getting wing-blocked by his little brother.  Sam started the Impala again and pulled back onto the road.
“And yet, you didn’t ward Sam,” Cas commented.
☆ ★ ☆ SUPERNATURAL ☆ ★ ☆
“Actually, you can help Dean out by removing any of the feathers that are loose,” Cas suggested, and Sam cautiously approached Dean again.  “If we remove Dean’s loose feathers a few times a day, the molting process should be more comfortable for him.”
“Dean – don’t!” Cas protested, but Dean wasn’t listening.  Protecting Sam was all he could think about.  He ran head first into the invisible wall.  Only, this time it didn’t feel like a completely solid wall.  It felt more like running into a wall made of jello – things still bounced off of it, but with enough effort maybe, just maybe, you could cut through it…
Meanwhile, Dean kind of liked the water droplets because they, like the occasional gust of wind in the cave, caused movements and vibrations so Dean’s still-developing angel senses could pick them up more easily.  Even after hours of being down here, Dean still couldn’t sense the rocky part of the cave unless they all turned their headlamps off, or otherwise completely blocked the light from reaching his eyes.  But Dean tried anyway to keep his senses on alert – demons would make vibrations that he should be able to feel.
“No worries Dean – I’m sure your new boyfriend would be happy to teach you,” Garth replied.  Dean jolted at the word boyfriend, but swallowed his protest at the word.  He was still getting used to dating a guy, but he supposed that it wasn’t wrong to call Cas his boyfriend.  Somehow though the word felt too simplistic and incomplete to really represent what Cas meant to him.  For now though, Dean didn’t have a better word to suggest so he left it alone.
"So how do I do this? And how do I keep them from flapping uncontrollably all over the place when they are out?" Dean grumbled reluctantly. But wing lessons now was better than random wing appearances in public later.
“Awesome,” Dean breathed as he admired his shiny new blade.  Cas hummed in approval next to him, still wrapped around Dean.  Cas’ breath was still on Dean’s neck, a fact that Dean was now even more acutely aware of since he had now accomplished the task at hand.
"You seem awfully quick to trust beings that you didn't even believe existed before," Bobby mentioned pointedly, still giving Cas suspicious glances. Normally Dean would be the first to agree with Bobby against trusting a supernatural being. But there was something different about Cas. Dean's gut told him that Cas' intentions were genuine.
"Only some parts of the human eye can detect color, and your brain fills in the gaps in color.  Your brain is probably is doing the same when it is integrating your new eyes with your human ones.  Full angels naturally see a wider spectrum of light than humans can, so it isn't an issue with angels who don't have a human face.  For instance, most angels of a higher rank have more faces than my three, but it is rare that any of them have a human face, and that doesn't hinder them any," Cas explained.
Sam greeted Eileen with a hug, then surprised Eileen by using ASL.
"Jerk," Sam replied with an eye roll and a small smile.  Together they started their accent once again.
“You are sensing my touches, at least on a subconscious level.  Now we need that to become part of your conscious awareness,” Cas explained.  “Let’s practice again.”
The next thing Dean knew, there was a flutter of feathers and Dean was laying in his own bed.  Cas was curled up next to him, and Cas draped his wings over Dean as the world’s best blanket.  Dean breathed in the sweet smell of Cas’ feathers and then surrendered to sleep.
☆ ★ ☆ SUPERNATURAL ☆ ★ ☆
“Awesome!” Dean exclaimed with a fist pump into the air.
A slight breeze started as they hiked through the rolling hills just beginning to turn green.  The sensation of the wind ruffling his feathers for the first time made Dean gasp.  He had expected it to be similar to how the wind felt in his hair, but the increased sensitivity of his wings intensified the experience.  It felt completely amazing.  While the individual sensations in different parts of his wings weren’t as intense as when Cas groomed his wings, these sensations were everywhere at once.  It was practically overwhelming.  Dean was suddenly inundated with this strong sense of connectedness unlike anything he’d ever felt before.
"Bobby...," Dean started to protest, but Bobby was giving him that it'd-be-for-your-own-damn-good look.  Fortunately Cas, possibly sensing Dean's distress, decided to speak up.
“What does Lilith want?  Aside from the apocalypse of course.  Is there a way to get her to come to you?” Juanita asked.
“You can’t carry the food in your backpack without crushing your wings, so I got Cas a backpack too,” Sam said in his overly patient voice, while trying to hide a smirk and failing spectacularly.  This definitely was payback for the fake “blue screen of doom” on Sam’s laptop a few days ago.
“Show me the feather,” Cas commanded.  Sam quickly scurried to comply.  The feather was mostly a light bronze, although it was hard to tell because it was partially covered with some sort of dried on goop.  There was a partial boot print on it, like it had been dropped and stepped on during the demon flight.  Even the parts of the feather that were relatively clean were rather frayed and worn looking.
Cas shifted Dean back to the physical world so that Dean arrived laying down on his bed.  The shift sucked even more than last time.  Dean had a moment of panic when the shift triggered memories of fighting his way through the ward, but Dean had a lot of experience with flashbacks and shoved the memories back down quickly.  His remaining pain was worse in the physical world than it had been just a moment ago, and on Dean’s first breath he coughed up some blood.
“Demon-on-demon violence – that’s not ominous at all,” Dean deadpanned and sighed.  “So we’re done here?”
"I explained the importance of our mission, and he consented," Cas explained simply. Dean put his hand in front of Bobby to keep him from continuing to argue.
Shayna was apparently in amazing shape because she was leading the pack, despite how sore she should have already been from just having done this insane climb just two days ago.  Sam was a few body lengths behind Shayna, and Dean was a few feet behind Sam.  Dean knew that he was climbing slower than usual because of his nerves, but he couldn't help double checking every grip before putting his weight on it.  Cas was apparently concerned about how nervous Dean was, because the angel didn't leave Dean's side, even though the nerdy dude probably could have beaten them all to the top if he'd wanted.  Henriksen had fallen behind, his life of too much pencil pushing and not enough fighting monsters catching up to him.  But Henriksen was nothing if not tenacious, and he kept going no matter how heavy his breathing got.  The air was probably a bit thinner up here, but Dean didn't really notice.  Thanks to the gloves everyone had had the foresight to wear, he didn't have blisters yet, but it was probably just a matter of time.
“Then I’ll just have to learn quickly.  Good thing I have a great teacher,” Dean replied with a sly smile, meeting Cas’ eyes for a moment.  He tried not to let the look of skepticism on Cas’ face faze him any.  They’d figure it out.  Dean couldn’t help but envy how easily Cas slipped his intangible wings through the Impala’s exterior, coasting on the wind as they drove.  Dean wondered what it’d feel like to have the wind in his feathers like that.  His own wings were now only about a foot long each – not quite long enough to fill the large backpack that Sam had bought for him, but too large to be comfortable inside it.  Dean could feel them constantly twitching inside the backpack, longing to be free and ride the wind like Cas’ wings were doing.  This was the first time he’d tried restricting them and it was bothering him a lot more than he’d expected it to.  He was glad now that he’d chosen a destination only about two hours from the Bunker rather than some of the trails further away that he’d considered.
Nothing quite makes you feel small like being able to fit through a crack in the door.  To everyone's relief, there were no more giants inside (that they could see anyways).  Shayna reported only seeing two giants on her previous trip, but that didn't mean there weren't more somewhere.  Dean felt like a tiny little mouse, or maybe even a cockroach, scurrying around someone's house and hoping to not be stepped on.
☆ ★ ☆
"Dean!  You nearly got yourself killed back there!" Sam scolded him.
“Seriously guys?  I’m right here!” Sam shrieked, his voice two whole octaves higher than normal, making him sound even more like the big girl he really was.
<Eileen just texted - she's only a few minutes away> Sam signed excitedly.  The bunker was tidy, Dean was almost done making the burgers, and there were two pies in the fridge for later.
"Wing buds? Transfer?" Dean asked.
“Perhaps,” Cas said coyly, as if he hadn’t just caught Dean unintentionally cheating, “the absence of your normal sensory stimuli will prompt your new senses to overcompensate?”  Cas leaned in close and whispered these words right up against Dean’s neck, causing Dean to shiver and fluff up his feathers.  Cas hummed his approval at Dean’s reaction.  Sneaky bastard.  Dean so needed to get him back for this later.
“So we suspect that this is a demon hunt, since most monsters aren’t this familiar with angel warding, but be ready for anything.  Start by breaking the wards on the outside and we’ll see if Cas and I can go in with you,” Dean told them as Cas led them off the main trail and back towards the warded building.  The warding paint seemed to glow in the dark, but Dean knew that Sam and Garth still wouldn’t be able to see it.
“No, for that we have these magnificent chains of our own design.  Angels can’t break them, can’t use their powers in them, are weak to demon powers – and this is the best part – they can only make themselves more physical while wearing them.  So once I force Sam to manifest his wings, he won’t be able to hide them again,” the demon bragged.
Dean was mentally exhausted that night, but he was having a hard time actually falling asleep. After drinking more whiskey then he remembered having to drink before (some of his topside memories were a bit hazy after all), Dean eventually fell into a state of semi consciousness. It wasn't the bliss of unconsciousness that he'd been hoping for, but at least the alcohol was enough to keep the Hell memories away. He'd told Sam and Bobby that he couldn't even remember Hell, and maybe if he said it enough times he'd convince himself of that lie too.
Dean ran through the trees, trying not to freak out about the huge crashes and roars behind him.  He really, really wanted to deep fry himself an archangel right about now.  Sure, it was part of the plan for some sort of trickster-fabricated monsters to force Sam, Dean, and Cas to separate, but it was supposed to be some kind of monster they could actually fight!
Dean was trying to be good and not scratch at his itching wings, but they were driving him nuts.  Despite his high tolerance for pain, the itching got under his skin in a different way.  Dean was getting more flexible, so he could reach and pull out most loose feathers by himself, but he (obviously) preferred to coerce Cas into doing it for him.
"I suspect so. It is beyond my power to modify souls or Grace. Your ability to manifest wings comes from your soul's wing buds. I merely helped align your energies so your wings would manifest in the traditionally preferred location," Cas explained. That explanation was a bit TMI though because now Dean was getting mental images of wings popping out of random body parts. Well at least if he was stuck with wings they were on his back.
“Real feathers?” Dean prompted eagerly.
"Yeah, well – it was a bit bright and overwhelming at the time," Dean told him, which was a bit of an understatement.
Poking fun at Balthazar was a tried and true way to keep Dean from freaking out over just how screwed they really were.  There was no backup coming to help them out of this one.  He suspected that demons had been plucking the feathers off of Balthazar, which Dean imagined would hurt like hell.  Were he and Cas next in line to get plucked?  They had to get out of here!
"Shayna!" came a joyous voice from inside the jewelry box.  A woman's face appeared in the keyhole, and Shayna reached through the keyhole so they could hold hands.  Tears of joy filled both women's faces.
“You want a cute little picnic basket to go with your backpack?” Sam asked.
"Fine. What do we know about angels?" Dean reluctantly grumbled.
Cas really should know better by now – Dean was never going to stop to worry about his own safety if it meant saving Sam or Cas.  Dean vaguely recalled hearing the demon get smited, and hoped that either Cas or Balthazar got to Sam before Sam was hurt very badly.  Dean could still see some of Balthazar’s energy on this plane, slow swirls of orange that were distracting him from what otherwise would be a private moment with Cas.  Cas saw his repeated glances towards Sam and Balthazar and sighed.
"Shut up, bitch," Dean replied.
Dean was vaguely aware of someone smiting the demon, and a frantic conversation happening around him.
“Your down feathers are real feathers, Dean,” Cas told him again with exasperation.  “But yes – these might be your first set of flight feathers.”
Since apparently the fiancé's credit cards had been stolen when their car had been broken into at the beanstalk site, Dean reluctantly agreed to leave his Baby safely locked away in Shayna's garage and let Henriksen drive them to the beanstalk.  Shayna was already waiting for them there, mixing up a few bowls of powdered spell ingredients.
Just as the bedroom door was opening, Dean suddenly felt his new wings suck themselves back into his back like they'd never even been there in the first place. The sudden loss of the wings threw Dean off balance and he face planted on the floor, with one of his legs still hanging halfway out the window. And no, Dean was never going to ever admit to the unmanly yelp he made from the surprise and pain of the awkward position he found himself in.
“And now with the return of visual stimuli, you have reverted to your natural predisposition to rely on your eyes,” Cas said with a sigh of disappointment.  “But you were doing great, Dean.  We’ll keep practicing.”
Dean couldn’t believe how awesome it felt to finally get out of the Bunker.  He grinned as he and Cas sped down the highway.
<Yes, make out.  I’m very horny.> Cas signed back.
"Are you saying that you'd sooner let Dean go back to Hell that risk exposing yourself?" Cas demanded.  Cas looked surprisingly intimidating, despite rocking the holy tax accountant look, but to Gabriel's credit he didn't even flinch.
"Then is this really the best time for you to be going out on a hunt?  Why not let Sam meet up with Henriksen while you help me research," Bobby suggested.  Dean tried not to wince with just how much he didn't want to be cooped up doing research.
"Dean!" Sam yelped in a voice so high pitched that it would have been comical in any other circumstances.  Dean decided to stop trying to think about how to move his wings, and just tell his soul where he wanted the wings to take him.  If his soul wanted these wings so badly, maybe it had some instincts about how to move them.
<Perhaps a show of good faith will help prove to you that angels are righteous beings completely different from what you hunt.> the being told him after a moment's consideration. That was not what he was expecting. Dean was about to tell it that he didn't want anything from it, but didn't get the chance. The white light suddenly surged all around him.
"Well even if this is a trap, there is an innocent woman up there who needs our help.  Do you have any idea what kinds of weapons might work against a giant?" Dean asked.
“Is it safe to turn the headlamps on?” Sam asked.  Dean froze.  Wait – how had he just assessed the layout of the cave if there was no light?  Dean was fully aware of where the walls, ceiling, floor, stalactites, and stalagmites were – but he realized that he wasn’t actually seeing them with his eyes.  His brain was creating a mental map of the area for him.  This must be what Cas had been trying to teach him – his wings were picking up on all the tiny vibrations around him, and his brain had finally figured out how to decode it.  It probably helped that his new flight feathers were much better at channeling vibrations to his nerves than his down feathers were.
"Shayna said the person who gave them the magic beans also gave them a spell that would enable the caster to see the beanstalks.  And no, the spell isn't ingested and contains no hallucinogens.  I was skeptical at first too, but once I saw it for myself I knew I needed to call in the experts.  So will you help me or not?" Henriksen explained.
“Son of a bitch!  I’m human!  HUMAN!” Dean yelled as he started chucking nearby rocks at the angel warding.  To add to his fury, all of the rocks that he threw bounced off the same force field.
“Quiet Sam – Dean is exploring the cave,” Cas interrupted whatever Sam was saying, with a clear note of pride in his voice.  Dean must have somehow given himself away.
☆ ★ ☆
“Why would it?” Garth asked in confusion.  “Love is beautiful in whatever form it takes, and yours has been a long time coming.  I’ve heard it in your voice whenever you’ve talked about Cas, and Kevin says that your staring contest can get so heated that he wants to tell you guys to get a room, but he doesn’t think you’d even hear him when you’re like that.”
"Right, and I'm the Easter Bunny," Henriksen retorted.
"Eggs and coffee will be ready in five," Sam replied. Dean breathed a small sigh of relief when the sasquatch thundered back down the stairs. However, now he had something else to worry about.
Dean might just have to look up Ratatoskr later – maybe his squirrel side was more badass than he was giving it credit for.  Even though he didn’t have either of his other faces manifested at the moment, he felt the squirrel part of his soul light up excitedly at the prospect of his acceptance.  But Dean still wasn’t completely on board with such an intimate part of him being symbolic of his connection to three realms.  Heaven sounded like it was mostly full of douchebags who couldn’t think for themselves, and Dean didn’t want to have much to do with any of them except Cas.  Worse, Dean hated his connection to Hell even though he knew that it had left a permanent mark on him as well.  The only bright side he could see is that he might never have met Cas if he hadn’t gone to Hell.  Son of a bitch, all of his trains of thought just kept leading him right back to Cas.  He had it bad for his angel.  Now if only they could figure out how to both survive this mission, maybe he could convince Cas to stay with him afterwards.
Sam looks up from his laptop, tilts the lid down so it’s almost closed, full attention on Dean. And, fuck, he’s definitely psychoanalyzing him right now. ”I guess not really different,” Sam allows. ”I think I was just expecting worse. But you weren’t drinking more excessively than usual, you were going on walks with Miracle, you were talking about how we’ve got to move on, you weren’t taking unnecessary risks-- or, well. You know.”
”Dean,” the Entity sighs, and it’s kind of funny that that for once actually does sound
really know, technically. Everything he’s ever fantasized about has been for someone else in some other life. Someone he could have been if things were different. But things aren’t different. He’s still a hunter and there are still monsters, still people to save. That’s all he’s got, and there is only one possible way that can go.
Cas helps Dean stand, which is not the rescue Dean had been planning, while Jack explains that the Entity is gone for now but it will be back, so they have to hurry. Dean staggers in place once he makes it back up on his feet, and he has to put a hand on Cas’ shoulder to keep from keeling over again. He still smiles though, big and real and bloody, when he says, ”Hey, Cas. I’m here to grip you tight and raise you from perdition.”
about driving?”
with you. The Empty is mine, the angel is mine, and now you are too.” It punctuates that with another kick that Dean is pretty sure might have broken a couple of ribs.
. And I don’t regret it in the slightest.”
in a ridiculous gift shop cowboy hat—and still nothing’s really fixed.
“It’s
“Okay, well,” Dean says. “I got you out of the Empty. And I’m here. What else do you want me to do?”
Now, though, Cas is right here, taking deep exaggerated breaths for Dean to raggedly copy. A warm hand on Dean’s back and another on his shoulder guide him into a chair. Cas talks low, not actually saying anything, so Dean just focuses on the cadence without having to listen or having to reply. It helps, somehow. Dean’s heart rate starts slowly returning to normal, and once it has, they both go quiet.
”’Operate an automobile’,” Dean mocks under his breath, complete with an eye roll. ”Okay, get out, we’re switching places.”
”Dean?” Cas asks, definitely aware of how Dean had suddenly tensed.
Dean sinks back down on the chair just as Cas says, “Please talk to me.” He looks-- sincere, is the only word Dean can think of for it. Not frustrated, only a little bit sad.
“So I went through Rowena’s stuff,” Sam keeps going, doesn’t seem to care or notice that Dean has gone mostly monosyllabic. “Tried to find a spell like the one Nick used to bring back Lucifer, when… yeah. But I couldn’t figure out if it would wake Cas up first, if he’d even need to be awake, and then he’d need a body, and I didn’t--. I couldn’t figure it out. So then I finally talked to Jack about it.”
Jack seems to realize that’s a concern Dean would have. “I’m going to bring him out,” he explains unprompted, and his eyes start glowing.
him again; he got a mostly fun case; a break from Sam looking at him like he was expecting Dean to fall apart any second; Cas quoting
Then, when Jack’s gone back to his room, Dean’s got one more thing left to do.
“I’m thankful she didn’t,” Cas says quietly, watching Dean. Probably seeing way too much in what Dean’s face is doing.
Dean instructs Cas in tentatively guiding the Impala out of the parking lot and out on the main road, a whole lot slower than what Baby is used to, and Cas clearly hangs onto every word out of Dean’s mouth. It’s just shit like “little close to the curb there, dude” and “this BMW behind us is right up our ass, you gotta speed up”, but Cas nods and quietly adjusts to whatever Dean is saying, listening like this is as important as any heavenly mission, or something. It feels strange, in a good way. Dean throws a look at Cas, at how focused he is, and makes sure to add in a “good job”, too, for good measure.
. “I never doubted that you ‘know your shit’,” Cas says, “I just wanted to say thank you.”
Sam looks distinctly more tired of Dean’s shit now. “Dean.”
“I know,” Sam says immediately. “I just. I need to say this.”
Dean thinks of a childhood spent in lonely motel rooms and months on the road without a word from John, but that doesn’t matter either. That’s not the kind of parent Cas is.
“It’s the Entity,” Jack says.
Dean holds up his hands. “I thought we already were.”
”Oh.” That’s definitely something Dean does
Dean’s hands are shaking again.
Sam chews on that one for a moment, then says, “...Twin Peaks?”
“No,” Dean replies quickly. “No, Jack, it’s good that you brought him back.”
Sam’s gaze softens again, turns sad. “You weren’t even trying to fight,” he says. “You just accepted it right away. And you were telling
They go silent again. So, Dean
Dean is heading out of the showers, on his way to Cas’ room, when Sam catches him. Looking determined and distinctly like he’s going to say something Dean doesn’t want to hear—Dean tries to shut it down before it’s even started. “Sam, I swear, I’ve had enough heart-to-hearts lately to last me the rest of my fucking life.”
have.
Cas has a hand on the back of Dean’s head, then he starts moving it down, past Dean’s shoulder blades, following his spine. It’s probably too gentle for what they’re doing, but it leaves a trail of goosebumps all over Dean’s skin, and he loves it anyway.
”Ha, ha.” Dean rolls his eyes but relaxes a little, finally sits down carefully in the chair opposite Sam.
“Yeah, well,” Dean says, and it turns out he’s about to cry, too. “You were dead. Hard to know, then.”
Dean is resolutely not looking at whatever Sam’s face is doing, but he can’t miss his careful tone. “Yeah?” he asks, softly, like he’s trying not to startle Dean into retreating.
Empty?” Cas had told him enough about what a shitty afterlife that was.
It might be some sort of guilt. Or maybe just Sam’s voice in his head saying
“I never knew,” Cas says, and when he blinks the tears spill over.
Being healed by an angel is still, after all these years, the strangest sensation—Dean’s not sure he’s ever getting used to it. Warmth and coldness both flood through him from where Cas is touching his forehead, and through his eyelids he can tell Cas’ palm is glowing. Then just like that the pain is gone, leaving behind only the exhausting memory of it, and Cas removes his hand.
He looks up carefully, terrified of what he’s going to see. But what he sees is Jack running towards him—Jack and
It was 15 years ago, and obviously not at all how it panned out in the end, but the thought still hurts. It always hurts, realizing he’s going to lose Sam.
Cas joins him in the kitchen too, steals sips from Dean’s coffee even though he doesn’t actually like it, while Dean makes himself some food. Sam hears the racket and comes in with a laptop and what is probably another case, and they’re discussing it when Jack suddenly shows up. With
Dean scoffs. “You could say that.”
“You didn’t have to. I heard you.” Cas is offering him an out. Dean’s not sure he wants it.
Cas follows along with greater focus than anyone should afford Dean’s attempts at education, and at the end quietly repeats, ”Turn signal,” to himself, like Dean’s comment meant that that was the most important part and he doesn’t want to forget it.
As if the fact they had spotted their prey wasn’t enough, Castiel proceeded to pull the most ridiculous face looking at the cover of a book. It was like a cross between Gollum and the Joker laughing, the most joyful look he had ever seen anyone pull. It had made Dean smile, but not in the way he normally did looking at the Novak kid. He hated it, the way he was feeling different things all of a sudden, like someone had flipped a switch in his brain.
He gripped the guard rail with his fingertips, barely holding on. He looked at the rope falling to the water. He really didn’t want to jump. He stared at it another 5 minutes, before taking a deep breath, and pushing himself off the ledge.
Alistair chuckled. “Man, just hearing the sweet honey of your voice is enough for a good for nothing runt like me.” Very sarcastic.
“So, Novak,” Dean cut over whatever conversation would’ve ensued. “We thought we’d change up the scenery a little today. Thought you might be getting a little tired of the parking lot.”
Castiel stood only a moment before he started to pick up the broom. His mother had neglected to realize that currently one of his arms was immobile and inflexible, so it would be practically impossible to sweep well. Cas sighed and resigned himself to the fact that he would get scolded when she got home for doing a bad job sweeping.
When he reached the door, instead of dropping Castiel to open it he kicked it hard four times with a crash loud enough for the neighbors on the next block to hear it. The ghostly shape of a pissed off twelve year old appeared on the other side of the door.
“But Cassy!” Alistair sang in a sickeningly sweet voice, “If I don’t do this, who will? Who’ll show you what a worthless, friendless, dickless, spineless little piece of pig shit you are? I can’t count on Dean anymore. He’s going kinda-” -Alistair rolled his eyes despairingly- “-Soft.” Castiel would have snorted at that if he had control of his airway. It didn’t feel much like Winchester was going soft. “And Azazel- well, he’s a little preoccupied right now. Got his own selfish family drama to deal with, his whore of a sister getting pregnant and all that. Uriel- well, if the retard could do anything without orders first, he still wouldn’t have enough balls to actually throw a punch himself.” Castiel felt like his neck was swelling and deflating and burning all at the same time, and it was not pleasant.
P.S. Also, as I'm sure you noticed, Zacharia's name is totally screwed up, I'm not sure what was happening with it but autocorrect kept messing around and I didn't have enough time or patience to fix them all.
“I’ve been up since 5:30. I had to do stuff online. Come on, you gotta eat breakfast.” Sam nagged. Dean didn’t eat Breakfast very much, he wasn’t hungry in the mornings. He only did when Sam made him.
“And do something about your face. It’s going to get blood on the carpet.” She finished, opening a cabinet and pulling a large pot down from it.
“You got any lunch money for us?” Azazel asked, and Alistair chuckled.
He turns his head from where it was twisted over his shoulder, and looked at the water. All fear was gone from his head, and what was left was pure rage and hatred. He glared at the river, his brow contorted in an effort not to scream insults and obscenities at the Bullies, the petty children who had to hurt others to solve their own problems. But he would not give them the satisfaction of his attention.
“Ah- motherfucker!” Alistair groaned, “You’re gonna pay for that-” He was silenced (in a matter of speaking, as he made such an animalistic noise Castiel wondered if he was turning into a dog) by the same foot, in the same place.
____________
Then Castiel was gone. Dean looked back into the pudgy face of the ginger haired kid he was threatening, and felt disgust well in him. Whether it was because of his actions, or Alistair’s, or the spinach leaf wedged in between the trapped kid’s teeth, he did not know. He raised his hand and whacked the kid in the cheek with his fist, because he had lost his train of thought in regards to this loser, but he didn’t want to let him off too easy. The kid’s face crumpled and Dean left with the ginger’s cry of pain trailing in his wake. It felt good.
And at the feel of Alistair’s wet tongue flicking at his inner ear lobe, Castiel jerked away, propelling himself away from the other boy. “No!” He said loudly, gasping painfully. “Never.” He ground out.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Had to stay home, take care of a half-brother. You know his family, always some little brat needing to be taken care of.” Azazel cut of Alistair as he opened his mouth to answer. He looked at Azazel with an annoyed expression.
Slowly softly.
He waited a moment but then remembered Alistair probably didn’t have his phone on him since he hadn’t answered his last text. He asked the same thing of Azazel, and got a response. “Nah, can’t figure out if they’re waiting for the right moment or if Novak didn’t squeal after all.”
He glanced at the digital clock on the stove and saw it was 8, which meant he had two hours to kill until his mother woke up from her seemingly eternal slumber. But luckily, he had a source of entertainment to fill  that time gap quite adequately.
Sam spit blood from his mouth into one of the popcorn bins, rubbing his arms where Dean had hit him. “Jerk.” He groaned. Dean could tell he had bitten his tongue in the struggle. Good. He was definitely gonna have a shiner later.
He woke up Sunday morning and showered right away to get ready for church.
Pausing outside his house, he took a deep breath of the cold spring air, feeling the slight burn in his chest and the concrete pull of his legs. Castiel was pretty sure that if he sat down, he wouldn’t be able to get back up again.
Castiel’s heart sped up to 1001 miles an hour, and he tried to break out of Dean’s hold by punching him in the side. “Stop-ah!” Dean grunted but still held his iron grip, and pushed Cas back against the wall. He barely got any warning before Dean’s fist rammed into his face again. He grunted as it his his nose and he felt blood drip out of it and into his open mouth.
“Frozen pizza,” Dean continued, and he heard Sam’s glare as he said, “And it’s for tomorrow. We’re running low on food cash again.”
He sat Indian style on the ground, right where Castiel’s feet should be, and bowed his head in prayer. He folded his hands, and placed his chin atop them, face furrowed in concentration.
“You know what, that sounds great! Go write in your diary about this or something.” Dean turned and placed a half moldy jar of pickles on the counter, “Oh! Sorry, I mean, journal.” He raised his hands in the air, making a swishing motion with his index fingers, “Headline; ‘disappointing brother screws up again.’”
He walked calmly up the stairs, and when he closed the door to his room flopped onto the bed. His feeling of euphoria from earlier was gone completely, and he was left in a soggy mood. Closing his eyes, he searched for anything in the less-than-cheerful archives of his mind to make him feel better. All he could come up with were songs from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but that wasn’t the kind of cheerful he needed right now.
“Hm.” Was all Castiel said. Time was ticking by, soon it would be art and then soon after the final bell would ring and he would undoubtedly be cornered. Maybe I could run again? He thought hopefully. But he knew they would probably be expecting it this time. Yesterday he had gotten so lucky, catching them off guard and getting away relatively without a scratch. He had taken a big risk. It could’ve ended very badly for him if they had caught him in the middle of an escape attempt. Though he wasn’t sure it would be better the day after either, when they’d had time to simmer in their hatred for him.
When was Alistar going to let him breath? When he was unconscious? Would Alistar listen to his heart and wait until it was barely thumping? And now, it seemed there would be two choices. Wait, see if Alistar would let him up, whenever that might be, or breathe. His heart was thumping out a tune; scared scared scared scared.

He awkwardly maneuvered the broom so that the handle was resting on his cast, and his other hand was moving it to round the dirt up off the floor. He brushed it across the boards in short slow sweeps. It wasn’t so unusual, being forced to clean, but normally not the before-clean when his father was  coming home. His mother didn’t trust him enough normally to clean the house well enough. And if she ended up alienating the cleaning lady, (which she normally did) then she would just hire another. Castiel started wondering why she wouldn't just hire another one this time. Maybe we’re running out of money? Pfft, we have so much we couldn’t run out if we tried. He though, a little bit bitterly. He knew that most kids at school hated his for his money, and while it was what was paying the bills and feeding him, he resented it.
shoulders alone, Dean.”
He’s still not looking at Cas, but he can still tell that he’s completely frozen. ”
. He gets out from under the covers, straightens them out so that his bed is passably made and only a little bit to stall, sits down with his feet firmly planted on the floor, and pats the spot next to him. “What do you mean?” he asks while Jack moves to sit.
“Not going to have a lot of need for a Queen of Hell, but yes,” Billie says. “We had to have her approval as well, and that was her condition.”
Dean’s been back home for a week when he finally confronts Sam in the bunker library. He’s been spending most of his time sleeping off almost-dying, slower to recover in his old age and all, but finally in the past few days started sending Sam out to get groceries so that he could start cooking again—back to something that resembles normality at least a little bit. Mostly he’s not been thinking about what Sam said at the hospital. Then his whole death speech started to come back to him, and now he
They’re parked outside a gas station, where Dean had just bought coffee and topped up the tank, and where, when he got back in the car, Cas had blasphemously admitted to not knowing how to
“Of course,” Dean echoes, a little stunned.
, and Dean just can’t stay here, actually.
Cas looks back up, frowning. “My foot is on the brake,” he says, almost petulantly.
They set off, the Entity hot on their heels, only for it to abruptly appear in front of Dean, blocking his path. Without even thinking, he throws a punch, and is surprised to find it connecting with something solid. Even if the only damage done is his own knuckles splitting.
The next day he finds a news article that hints strongly at a rawhead in Blue Ridge, so he texts Garth to ask if he knows any hunters who might be in the area.
“No,” he says simply, and then he storms out.
The hug says,
“Okay,” Sam says. He takes a breath. “Dean, you do know that there’s more for you, right? More than guns blazing and dying bloody?”
The next sentence comes out like a dam bursting: “I’m a fucking mess when you’re gone, Cas.” It floods the whole room.
He doesn’t keep up the fight with Sam, but they also don’t really talk much at all. After two days Sam announces he’s meeting up with Eileen for a salt-and-burn—definitely just an excuse to hang out with her, because it’s not like she can’t handle some ghosts by herself—and asks if Dean will be okay alone for a bit, like he’s not a middle-aged adult.
“You know the job, Sam,” Dean pushes on. “We’ve both always known. And now that we’re no longer the main characters of Chuck’s shitty pulp fiction, that really is what we’ve got to look forward to. Normal-for-us, permanent deaths. You know that’s all there is.”
“Okay.” Dean stands up instead, starts pacing. “So.” His right hand is itching to reach out for his left bicep, even over his shirt sleeve. The scar tissue underneath is smooth, and a little bit numb. It flattened out and turned white years and years ago. The jacket with Cas’ bloody handprint in the same spot is folded up and tucked into the bottom of Dean’s closet. He’s pretty sure he’s never ever going to look at it again, but he couldn’t make himself wash it or throw it away. He keeps his hands at his sides.
. I’ve never felt the need to know how to operate an automobile.”
Well, that’s a somewhat safer subject for Dean to pick up. “You talked to Jack?” he asks.
”Yes. Okay!” Dean claps his hands, which visibly startles Cas, which happens to make Dean aware of how close together they’re sitting. Right. He moves back a little bit to his side of the seat but lets himself keep his knee pressed against Cas’ thigh. Reassurance, or whatever. ”Well, I think you’re set. The rest of it we’ll deal with when it comes up.”
Dean doesn’t care for fucking careful. ”Should be?” he asks. “So Mom should be dead, and we should never get to see her again? Or Charlie? Bobby?
Dean stands up with a groan. His back is still sore, Cas only took care of the newest damage. And then three pairs of eyes greet him when he opens his own. Like he’s supposed to be the one to conclude all of this.
Unfortunately, despite previous intentions, he’s realizing that he might
Cas squints at it but says nothing for several seconds. Dean suppresses the urge to groan, then supplies, ”
”No,” Cas admits, a little sheepishly. “I know now that this is the brake,” he says, gesturing down at the footwell, where the angle Dean is sitting at means he can’t see if Cas even indicated the correct pedal. It takes him another second to realize that that was a
“You had given up, Dean,” Sam says, and Dean can tell from his voice that he’s about to cry. “And I don’t know if it was just… everything, or if it was Cas--”
now. And it’s not like entering portals to find someone and bring them home is anything new for them. He can deal with that. And whatever comes after, he can probably deal with too.
“Stop,” Dean interrupts. At some point he’s gotten up from his chair without even realizing. He stands there for a second, undecided, and then he makes up his mind and leaves. Sam doesn’t follow.
And Sam just nods. “I was already working on it, you know, before--,” he pauses. “I mean, it’s Cas. Of course I wasn’t just going to leave him in the Empty if I could do something about it.”
Cas, and that’s a big deal. In addition to the fact that Dean’s just essentially come out to the most important person in his life—by all means, he should be freaking out. He’s surprised to find that he isn’t, that when he really thinks about it, he can say, “Yeah, Sam. I’m good.”
He looks up, and Sam is just
Dean fixes him with a glare he hopes conveys how unimpressed and not-up-for-this he is, but he doesn’t protest.
“Dean, will you let me heal you?” Cas asks, some urgency in his tone. Dean’s got a
, but that’s what he wasn’t going to admit. “Since when does it bother you?” he asks instead.
“If that’s what you want.”
He hesitates for another second, but then he admits defeat. Says, “Okay. What’s the plan?”
“Yeah, whatever,” Dean says. “Did you change your mind, or something? Realize your mistake?”
Dean tries to go for casual and misses by about a mile. “What the fuck, Cas?”
He’s still looking a little nervous, even more so now that they’re going faster, both hands white-knuckled on the steering wheel and posture all rigid—though it’s not like his usual posture is very relaxed—but he’s enjoying himself, Dean can tell. Dean leans back in his seat, reluctantly losing the contact between his knee and Cas’ thigh, and cranks the music up a little louder. He’s enjoying himself too, he realizes, looking at Cas, and then he realizes exactly what situation he’s gotten himself into.
Then Jack sits them down at the war room table and explains what they’re going to do, in not very many words. Dean is pretty sure it’s been condensed for his sake. Sam will open a portal, because that’s apparently the easiest way in. Jack will wake up Cas, and rebuild him, and bring him here. The plan cuts off there, so Dean figures his own role in all of it is up to him—prepare a welcome back party, or hide out in his room, or straight up just not even be here at all.
Dean glances at Sam, glances back at the road. “Yeah,” he says after a moment, low, with intent. “Me too.”
Dean leads the way. He glances over at his brother and smiles. “You remember your shoe?”
Charlie on her back up under a console, pulling apart old wiring. The map room begins to change, as new technology replaces the old. Switchboards are replaced with computer screens, large modems, sleek interfacing. The map with its plastic circles is replaced with a conference table. Slim data banks replace the obsolete dials and gauges, the ham radio and the analog tape recorder and all the, outdated, inoperable machinery. The walls are now lined with high-resolution flat screens displaying news story alerts and mapping active cases.  Charlie stands looking around at it all, brushing hair back from her face, clearly proud of herself.
“Okay, coyote I get – he’s one of the most famous tricksters I’ve heard of, but a squirrel?” Dean questioned.
"I don't, but I know who does.  I created this pocket dimension so that we could talk privately.  In fact, the human lovers and their cousin are free to go," Gabriel explained, and with a snap of his fingers Juanita was out of the jewelry box, where she was quickly embraced by Shayna.  "I dematerialized the giants, so it should be clear sailing for you kids all the way home."
They spent the next few hours slowly making their way through the cave.  It was very slow going because most of the passageways weren’t built for people Cas’ size, let alone sasquatches.  They occasionally had to use some of the tools they had brought to carefully widen the passageways so they could all fit through.  Sam was updating his map as they went along, and keeping track of where they were and where they had already explored.  Dean couldn’t get his angel senses to kick in again so long as the light was on, so he felt practically useless at navigation.
And just sit for a moment, together, considering.
“We just want to have a little fun!” Crowded Azazel, eyeing Cas. Cas pulled on his cardigan sleeves, giving his nervous fingers something to do. His brain was flooding with every possible outcome, trying to figure out what he should do, but not helping his situation. Then Alistar hauled a fist into his stomach, and he tried not to double over, but lost the fight and wrapped his arms around his aching stomach. Winchester pulled him back up, the shirts collar digging painfully into his neck. He looked at them, and saw Alistair and Azazel were both smiling, and he would bet a hundred dollars Winchester had a grin on his face too.
“Well, you better clean all that up. You made that mess, you can wipe it up.” She started walking away, and turned back. “While, you’re at it, do the dishes too.”
It turned out he did actually have an appetite after all.
Dean’s mouth dropped open in horror. He felt the blood rush from his head and he heard vaguely as Sam gasped, flashlight dropping from his hand. A drop of ruby liquid hit Dean on the forehead, and the snake of fear coiled in his stomach reared, turning into terror and anguish. It choked his throat, and Dean stared up for 3 seconds before he was able to return the movement to his body.
As he drove, he staved off the feeling of unease in his gut by wondering he could maybe use this little endeavor to stop Sam from being such a little bitch. Maybe saving the guy he had previously left to the dogs from several day’s misery in a filthy alley was enough to redeem Dean Sam’s eyes. He figured he had a pretty good chance, especially if it turned out no one in the gang had done it. He should talk to Al later, text him or something. Then Azazel.
The show needed to “wrap up” the world for the finale. But by that, I mean they needed to answer some of the larger questions about that world, and what was going to happen in it, and therefore to it. They needed to provide the audience with a sense of closure without an ending. That that world would go on, even after the final credits. It didn’t feel that way in the canonical series finale. I hope it does feel that way here.
"Some part of you must have wanted them there," Cas countered. Dean shook his head to try to banish the memories of how comforting it had been to be cocooned in his wings like that.
A giant blue ox had suddenly crashed through the trees.  The creature was nearly the size of a two-story building, and it turned its angry glowing red eyes right towards them.
Dean had barely had time to wash the dust out of his mouth before the electronics started flickering. Shit. Placing salt around the doors and windows had been so deeply drilled into him that it was still automatic even after thirty years away. But somehow, Dean suspected that the salt was completely worthless against this supernatural entity. Dean could suddenly feel its presence all around him, and an otherworldly voice filled his head. To make the situation even more surreal, this presence felt familiar and almost comfortable.
The rest of the drive wasn't as much fun since there was now a strict "no more detours" policy.  They didn't stop at any more diners, and Cas insisted on thoroughly inspecting any convenience store food that they bought before he would let them eat it.  The trio did try to stop at a motel for the night a few hours later, but as luck would have it, it was swarming with demons.  On the plus side, Dean’s hunting skills were still on par with how they’d been before his death – maybe even better than they’d been before.  He managed to gank two demons while Cas smited three and Sam got one.  It was the kind of confidence booster Dean needed after how completely useless he’d been at the last battle.
☆ ★ ☆ SUPERNATURAL ☆ ★ ☆
Eileen was impressed with Dean’s burger making skills, and the four of them had a good time laughing and chatting over dinner.
"Proof that there's a God out there that actually gives a crap about me personally? I'm sorry, but I'm not buying it. I don't understand why God or any of his angels would give a crap about me," Dean replied.
Cas took the feather from Sam and examined it closely.  Then Cas spoke a few words of Enochian that sounded like some sort of spell.  Dean felt a very brief pulse of energy vibrate through his wings.  Then Dean jumped because for a split second, he could have sworn that he saw a ghostly image of Balthazar with wings right in front of him.  But in less time than it took to blink it was gone.
Out of the corner of his eye, Cas spotted Dean wiggling his eyebrows at Sam.  This was something Dean sometimes did when he thought that Sam was going to “get lucky” today.  Sam pointedly ignored Dean’s eyebrow wiggle, and Eileen didn’t see it since she was facing the other direction.
