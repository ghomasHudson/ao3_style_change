Cas watches him grab an oversized yellow bag of peanut m&ms. He can tell they’re high in sugar, and they’re colored pieces of chocolate. He doesn’t know the taste. Dean holds the bag closer to himself and says he’s not sharing.
"People are good. Or at least, they don't deserve to die. Not by something they don't know exists, or don't know how to fight against. I couldn't just... stop in good conscience."
“I can multitask,” Cas says, snide.
Dean could let him go, could leave the ruins of the building and make sure the Impala is okay, get the hell out of here and hole up somewhere safe.
No fucking way. I can’t - can’t tell him I couldn’t -” He shuts his eyes, heart thumping in his chest like something is
Cas can be hurt, Dean knows. He’s seen it before. But it doesn’t seem to stick for longer than a minute or two. “Tell me and we can stop,” Cas says, even though he’s the one underneath Dean, the one who should feel vulnerable.
They take the Impala south. “Car's fine, body's set, we're both alive and kicking. We deserve a vacation. Maybe the beach, some clubs, you and me. We could do Miami,” Dean says, “what do you think?” Cas is silent. Dean sits with it for a while, lets the car roar around him as he tears along the highway. “Or are you still set on turning me into a squishy human with all sorts of soft feelings?”
Cas shifts. "Whatever we'll face, it won't be a united front like before. Most of the major players are off the board, so to speak. And the ones that are still around will be more concerned with gaining control back than finding us."
"Imagine that," Dean echoes, and he gets off the next exit and heads west, following the setting sun.

Which is why it’s so terrible that he can’t absorb a thing of what Dean’s saying when it comes to cars.
has stopped finding Dean’s form repulsive since before they had left hell.
“Don’t call me that.”
“You think it’s weird that we’re the only ones not studying anything?” Dean asks, startling Cas from his thoughts. There’s a bench in one corner that they've commandeered. It gives them a vantage point of students laying out on the grass or walking to class. Dean says he likes the people watching. Cas likes the birds that periodically perch on the edge of a nearby fountain.
Content warning in end notes
Righteous Man at all is because when he speaks his name, 'Dean Winchester', the creature turns towards him, and the moment of recognition pierces Castiel through. He staggers with the weight of it, of what his charge has become, and all the demon does is consider the being of alien light before him and says, "haven’t heard that name in a long time."
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s possible. Whatever is affecting people, it’s not instantaneous.” He looks at the ground, but it’s all clover and slightly overgrown grass. Dean kicks up some loose gravel by the road’s shoulder.
“I want the angel.”
Content warning in the end notes
Sam had tried to exorcise him, so he took that as his cue to nab the Impala’s keys and get out of there.
"I just don't understand. I mean - why wouldn't dad leave us a message, a sign - something?"
Cas’s eyes harden. “I am far from the first to be able to save your brother. And unlike your…
They tried, they really did try to get to Lilith before the other seals broke.
** Dean's comment about getting shipped off to 'some delinquent place' is a reference to the s9 episode Bad Boys where that did happen and Dean and John never told Sam the story of how he landed in a boys home?? Hm, gives me brain damage. Some of the late season canon stuff can get wonky, but I think Dean getting picked up for juvie or something similar would've fit well enough.
"Cas," He slowly twists so his back is against the car. Cas is pressed up against his side.
Heather goes flying - not against the wall or the freezer, but across the room, landing hard right on the stone steps that lead into the basement. The gun falls from Heather’s hand. She doesn’t get back up. The four of them watch as blood pools under Heather’s head.
If you would like any added pain in this story, just do a ctrl+f search for 'love' and see how/when characters use that word in this fic. Especially this chapter :)
“What about,” Cas says, “with me instead?” Dean doesn’t get it, sweaty, panting, half-hard, until he does. He  waits for the pressure to run down his spine, waits to freeze, waits to disappoint Cas.
“The witches there mentioned a tablet with divine origin,” Castiel admits. “They killed an angel before we found them, and it was a rather talkative one.”
Dean buys Cas a new disposable camera. "Fucking price gouging," he says, ripping through the packaging and handing it over.
Of course Sam wouldn’t know what Castiel has done to other angels he’s crossed paths with. He and Dean had been in the middle of researching, spell casting - something to protect them from the angels that want to take Castiel away. “What would you have me do with her?”
“What band, what band,” Dean says, flicking through the cassette tapes. The stereo Dean put in has room for cassettes
He holds up another finger. “To the winner goes the spoils.” Lucifer laughs, a sharp bark that makes Dean freeze as the fallen angel waltzes back into his line of sight.
When he was a human, money had been an issue. Never having enough to stretch between him, Sam, and John, then just him and Sam. There were credit card scams, hustling, gambling, tricking when he needed a lot and needed it quick. There were weapons and ammo, gas, food, clothes, rooms to be put up at, repairs, maintenance, one bullshit bill after another.
"I've never been to Chicago." He licks chocolate frosting off his fingers. Dean watches him suck at his thumb, wipe the residue away on a napkin. “Are you sure it’s alright if I come with you?”
Also I will be out of town this weekend (and I do mean like a town over, no crazy travelling, and I'm just seeing another fully vaccinated friend, promise!) but I won't have my laptop so next chapter may be updating on Monday. We'll see! :)
"I'm not fucking Cas."
* Jess mentioning the fourth wave refers to different waves of feminism/gender theory, with the current being the third wave.
The Righteous Man was deep in the Pit. Deeper than what his superiors had assumed, deeper than even the Seraphs in the garrison could get to.
“Maybe the land’s cursed?” Cas says. They’re at an internet café the two of them camped out next to each other to see if they can find anything useful. “Walking in it is like a trip mine.”
Cas doesn't answer, but Dean looks and can just barely see the outline of something large and molting and more damaged than before. In the darkness, the body the angel is using looks very worn, and very tired.
He sits against the hood of the car and stares. Cas joins him. “We should probably call the fire department, “ he says.
Cas hums, and grabs at Dean's drink. It must be a testament to how grateful he is that Cas didn't bring up the
“How do you know you like it?”
getting you a phone.”
Castiel holds his gaze, never backing down, like always. Dean had always cut himself off at the pass when he was a human, never let himself linger on any guys passing by. It wasn’t what a real man did, it wasn’t something John would approve of. Well, now he’s not exactly a real man, and John’s long gone, and Cas’s human vessel is just his type.
ANYway - this was a very fun rewrite for me, personally, as someone who was a Dean girl until I saw Cas onscreen and shifted gears immediately afterwards. Hope you all enjoy as well!
“What are you thinking about?” Cas says, next to him, “and don’t say nothing.”
“Only child? Yeah, that explains it.”
"I don't know. Not yet. Not quite yet."
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s what people expect, right? I mean. It’s -” He licks his lips. They’d be easy, he thinks. They approached Cas, they were interested. If the two of them were just friends, just hunting partners, it would’ve been - “easier,” he lands on. It’s not an answer either.
Shoutout to @posyfoot on tumblr for suggesting a crocotta as a monster as it sounded like Dean may have hunted one before the series!
“Nah. Said he didn’t know. Looked like he was driving a Lincoln Continental, though. 1970s. Tan.”
“We need to work on the next seal,” Castiel says instead. He puts his hands on Dean’s shoulders and pushes him back. Dean thinks about putting his strength into it, making Castiel squirm when he realizes he can't actually move him - but Castiel jerks him back harsher than either of them are expecting. Dean straightens up and frowns.
“Going off the deep end you’ll have to kill us, blah blah blah. Doesn’t stopping the end of the world with my favorite little brother get me a free pass?” Sam's glare is answer enough.
Dean hadn’t spent much time considering Sam the first time around. He stuck around long enough to insist he was Sam’s brother - true - he wanted to stop the apocalypse - also true - and Sam needed to stop hanging around with demons - hypocritical, maybe, but still true.
“Perhaps.”
Cas turns, touches Dean's temples before he can loll back against the car. He opens one eye to watch Cas. He looks like he's concentrating all his energy on his brow bone. His fingers are warmer than the cool metal of the car. His ring and pinkie fingers are embedded in his hair.
busy making engraved armor or some shit and broke me out too late. I was supposed to stay human, come back right away.” Sam stares at him. “You learn a lot of fun stuff in hell, Sam. And heaven, too, if you can get someone's ear. And do you know what the big picture is? Really? It's that heaven
“Castiel,” his brother spits, “Dean was just telling me some interesting information. Like how apparently the angels were supposed to save him before he
"The power to get lost?"
Dean hums, fishes out a yellow one this time. “Well. Keep trying.”
“Bastard,” he mutters, rolling his shoulder and forcing it back into his socket. He tilts his head, considers the empty husk of the demon he’d been duking it out with. “That one looked familiar.”
It’s different like this, more of what Dean’s used to. He falls against Cas and clings tight, ignores what they saw that night, what else is outside the walls of their room. Cas holds him, panting into his ear. His leg hitches up around Dean’s hip when he comes like he can’t bear to untwine himself from Dean and Dean - lets him. Wants to stay right here, forever. Always.
There’s a road thick with wild cacti and succulents and orange flowers, their glossy leaves overgrowing onto the sidewalk. “Wait,” Dean says. He squints and reaches a hand out, snaps off a stalk.
“You’re not an idiot, Dean.”
Dean meanders closer, and drops Castiel’s Grace. It melds back into him, and he can think clearly, without being in so much pain.
“You don’t have a lot of scars, you know,” Dean says. Cas looks at him. He forgets where he was going with that. “Um. You know. For a hunter.”
“Can’t you?” Sam glowers at him. “Dean would ask if you were too busy gallivanting with that demon.”
“You flew?”
He holds up a finger, resisting the urge to turn as Lucifer walks behind him. “Two conditions: One, I get another body - preferably one that looks this good.”
“Did you know she’s back?”
“Yeah,” he squeezes Cas tight, feels his leg and arm anchor them together, sighs. “I am.”
"Pfft. Nerd." He passes out almost immediately.
The pain, slow and purposeful, lessens.
"Yeah, ruining their fun. Way to stick it to 'em."
"Family business? Dean, Jess is back there with -"
But he doesn’t move away.
For a moment, that seems to break through. Cheryl's hands drop, and John falls to the floor. Dean tries to crawl towards him. Cheryl eyes the movement and pins him against the leaking freezer. Out of the corner of his eye he sees Cas by his dad's side.
"Guess so," he says, leaning over just enough that Cas moves in to meet him; simple, sweet, heat under his hand and Cas's fingers playing with the hem of his shirt.
“You can’t dream about something if you’re awake, can you?” Cas doesn’t look as hot as Dean feels. His body doesn’t need to sweat in order to cool off. His body doesn’t need to do a lot of the things it should.
“Does it always work like that?”
He looks up, almost expecting the owner of the voice to be in the same room, but he's still alone.
“My name’s Cas,” Cas tells him, still wheezing. Dean hauls him up, holds him tight, kisses him brutal and sloppy and more relieved than he’d ever admit.
“An old friend, perhaps,” Castiel says. He speaks humorlessly, but the words themselves make Dean smirk.
evil. I think your father just wanted you out of the picture because he doesn’t want you to come into contact with those forces.” He tips his head. “Has he ever kicked you off a case before and not tell you what happened?”
Dean keeps thinking about it. He sits and looks at Cas, whose face is cut by the neon lights flashing in the window they’re sitting by, features playing out in interesting and new ways in the red and blue and shadow, and he wonders.
Dean doesn't get what she's implying for a second. Then her meaning crashes down with an intense clarity. "What? That's not - no. No way."
The sun sets, and they pick their way across the beach. Even in the dim light of the condos and hotels and restaurants, the string lights and solar powered white bulbs, Dean can see the pink flush of Cas’s shoulders from where the sun had beat against them all afternoon. Dean presses his finger right at Cas’s spine, between two vertebrae. The pressure makes it pasty white for a moment before the burn seeps back in.
“So, you found me. Didn’t realize I was down there long enough to have my name written in a grimoire.”
There's no longer a gaping maw in the earth, and Sam slumps to the ground. Above him, Dean's untethered, swirling and cutting through the air. Bobby shakes Sam by the shoulder, and his brother looks up at the sky, darkened as Dean streaks across it in undulating waves of black smoke.
He knows Dean is thinking about those vampires. The ones that supposedly only fed on animals so that they could avoid taking a human life. The ones he killed anyway.
“I don’t think this went exactly how anyone expected it to,” Dean answers. He spreads his arms and grins, “but hey, you win some, you lose some. At least you get a full blooded Winchester, ready and willing.”
"So." Dean looks back at Sam. "It's really over."
“Huh?”
“We’ll be in touch, Sammy,” Dean tells him.
“No,” Cas says. “Dean what are you -”
Dean has a half empty pack of cigarettes buried in the glove box. He lights one up as they drive. He tries not to think, can't help it. Decides that it’s easier to think about Cas than the dead family they’re leaving behind. He didn’t even pull a trigger and he feels worse about this hunt than he has in a long time.
“It’s weird being here so long,” Dean adds. “Haven’t stuck around in one place since I was in high school, and never a city this big.”
'The Trouble with Nature: Sex in Science and Popular Culture' is a gender/queer lit book that was published in 2003 that potentially could've been taught in college classes. I haven't read it personally but it seemed like a book that wasn't bogged down by too much social theory that a more Average Joe type could get through it. It was surprisingly hard to find a book like that published prior to, say, 2010!
Dean’s soul, this deep in hell, has been here for decades upon decades. Centuries, perhaps. He is a demon, no doubt, but he hasn’t existed for quite long enough to be stripped of his identity - perhaps he will never be. Surely turning someone of his importance into a foul, evil thing is seen as a triumph, and his human name is still spoken if only to brag and tout hell’s true power.
"Crossroads can be places of power," Cas says. He's looking at the trees, the dirt.
Dean can feel the way the air is heating up, smoke spilling out of the windows, the wooden supports crumbling under the flames. “Come on. Let’s get out of here.”
“We did it and survived,” Cas adds, in awe.
“You too, Sammy. And you better bring the car back.” He hands up, tosses the phone in the passenger seat for Sam to track. It’s not like he’ll be needing it for a while.
Cas doesn’t

Vampiric cattle have got to be one of
“Now, do it!” His brother sets to work, and Dean has just enough wherewithal to stumble back towards Michael. He falls to his knees, Michael’s steely gaze looking at him from behind his half-brother’s eyes.
Perhaps there would be some nobility if he died fighting, here, even against the Righteous Man himself. Or what remained of him. But instead Castiel gathers himself through the growing pain and asks, “do you truly wish to stay here? In hell? Forever?”
"I'm serious, Sam. By the time they get their shit together, you'll be dead - no offense - and hopefully by that point we can figure out a way to make sure you
He pauses.

At first, they were in a fleet, massive and glowing and coordinated. But hell was not meant for angels, and as they plunged deeper they were wrenched apart, Grace dwindling as they burned through it to form an offensive attack, then, eventually, to defend themselves from the onslaught.
They can’t dig up the bones and burn them in broad daylight, even if the road’s practically a formality for all the traffic it gets. Dean spends a few minutes trying to find a stone to use as a marker, can’t, so he digs out an axe from the trunk and swings it into the dirt a foot in front of the body.
“I mean, a home, you know,” Dean mumbles, Bobby’s house in the rearview, “you ever think about - you know.”
So! This is a pivotal moment. To be honest I think Dean and Cas could've done this pining dance until the end of my story - but the tag 'maybe if Dean got a boyfriend he would've calmed down' is actually a vital plot point and wasn't an exaggeration at all ;)
is so easy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The bar has bad lighting and worse drinks. Dean nurses a domestic while he plays pool, acts drunk and inexperienced so he can funnel in some easy cash. When he pulls his head out of the game he realizes Cas isn’t where he left him at one of the nearby tables.
"That doesn't make me feel better. Actually, the fact that you know that makes me feel worse." He slams the box shut. "Let's bring this to John, unless you got another episode of Miss Cleo rattling around up there."
ANYWAY - Meg!! Whom we have actually met before without realizing. According to The Lore, Meg Masters was possessed around the time of the pilot, so in s0, she wouldn't have had that current vessel. I love her v much and she was SO fun to write. Especially when antagonizing Cas. They're worsties <3
"...that's the reason we're here," Dean admits, shuffling his feet.
He doesn't remember anything before that motel room in Pontiac, so maybe he's wrong, but he feels like he didn't have friends. Or at least, not like how he's friends with Dean. The man is prickly and exaggerated and flashy and he's dragging Cas out to things more than Cas might want to go, but Dean’s with him so it’s fine, he thinks, if he goes out and talks to strangers and sees things that he wouldn’t otherwise. Cas talks and Dean listens; he always listens, even when he's pretending that he has better things to do than hear Cas's numerous opinions on honeybees (the Ohio State Agricultural branch has some hives that Cas has snuck in to look at more than once.)
"When?"
***The Isabella Gardner museum is a fine arts museum in Boston that lost multiple famous and expensive works in an art heist in 1990. Dean is not into art, but I think art heists are cool enough and that was a big enough deal at the time that he'd remember it.
Dean’s face is inscrutable - or maybe that’s because the sun is behind Cas’s head and it hurts to look that way. “I, uh. I mean. Hey man, as long as you’re cool with it, I’m cool with it.”
Cas is in his underwear, resting an open Terry Pratchett novel on his crossed legs. He’s watching Dean. “You’re tired.”
“That was Bartholomew,” Cas tells him.
*Jerry Maguire is a movie wherein Tom Cruise and Renee Zellweger fall in love amongst some sports journalist drama and part of the romance subplot occurs when Cruise's character bonds with Renee's character's son. This was in the OG episode but I have not seen Jerry Maguire so!
He pauses by the bar. He can hear some other people tittering around him, the music blaring from the old sound system on the other side of the building, the sound of billiards clacking. He doesn’t hear what she’s telling Cas, but then his smile gets wider. Turns into a grin that makes his eyes crinkle. Dean takes a breath.
“Someone new to this world shouldn’t know so much about dark magic.” He points at the box that was buried at the crossroads. “You didn’t know about that until today, did you?”
idk what the reader opinion on this chapter is going to be tbh so lmk! I know drug/alcohol use and sex together can produce different interpretations? I kind of based this on my own experiences which were luckily positive and with friends but I know that not everyone has had the same stuff happen to them!
She puts her hands up defensively. "I'm just saying, Dean! I know you probably didn't grow up in places were people were out and proud, but it's better here, you know? College towns are like that."
"I don't… remember anything."
“That could work, then maybe we can see what you’re doing after class?” She looks up at him again, mouth opening like she’s going to shoot off a retort before she gives him another once over. Her dubious expression is morphing more into a smirk. It’s a reaction he gets a lot.
Dean and Castiel don’t have an official signal, exactly, no words or gestures. But Dean’s expression shifts just so, and Castiel knows what the demon wants from him.
replace it,” he spares Cas a smile, “because I’m awesome -"
He finishes washing up, puts on some underwear, and opens the door to the motel room. The plastic bag is on the bed Cas is on, M&M bag open, the other box by his thigh where his book is resting.
“And?”
“Sleeping, breathing, sure.” Cas licks his lips, tastes the bitter twist of hops, the yeast, the relief of having a drink on a hot day.
*** Eleanor Lance steals from the character and actress from The Haunting, since Bela seems to like to use horror films for her aliases :)
"Come on, Cas, really?" he says it like they're talking about a girl Cas adamantly refuses to pick up, like he should be elbowing him in the side and leering.
“Do you ever think about -” He starts. Stops. Cas is already eating his fries.
Castiel knows how phones work. Theoretically. “Why?”
Cas is stoic, always has been. Dean’s been needling him for months - years, with how time works downstairs, actually - and he’s only just started to pick up on a flash of sarcasm if he’s paying attention. But as the TV screen flits over Cas’s face, the angel looks terrified.
Dean shrugs. Remembers Cas can't see him. "I dunno. More'n mos' people… if there's no money or no motel. Boston's, um. 'Spensive. You know?"
“Our specialists can work with this one. Do you really think angels haven’t defected before you two?”
that way. And I'll be... I don't know. Anywhere but here." He glances at Cas again, because he can't help it, these days. Not after watching him almost die for good.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Raise me…” Dean’s ever shifting form turns considering. Any other demon that had gotten this close had rendered Castiel’s Grace apart - or tried to. Dean pinches and pulls, considering the options, playing with his prey. “Like this?” he goads, “how?”
"He'll be good," Cas tells Sam. "Or however a demon passes for good." He takes his hand from his pocket and holds it out. "Thank you," Cas tells his brother, "for everything."
“And yet here you are, trying to do the same to me.” Castiel sniffs.
They go on a few more hunts before John hears about an apparent lead that’s too important for Dean to come with. He takes his things and heads off in the truck he bought a few years ago, and Dean entertains the thought that he might come back for about a week, kicking around in a motel room with sticky walls and loud neighbors before he decides, fuck it, John knows his number.
“Nah,” he says, tossing over a fake credit card. He wonders, idly, if the people he scams ever get into arguments from his random purchases. If next week ol’ Harry Sunderland is going to get into a fight with his wife when she opens the statement and realizes he spent money on cigarettes, candy, and condoms somewhere two hundred miles from them. “Have a good night,” he says.
Uriel was strong, sure, but the angel came alone. Between him and Dean, his once brother-in-arms doesn’t make it out of the motel room.
me do anything.” The signs lead him to a place in Kansas called Lebanon - center of the country, apparently. Not much to look at, but Dean supposes it must mean something, to get started right in the middle of it all. “Alright. I’m going in.”
Dean stands up, and he can hear that piercing scream, a call of angels that breaks the window into a million shards, threatens to send the foundation of the motel collapsing around them. “Get out of here!” Dean yells at him.
“Have fun,” Dean tells him and Beth when they get into the apartment. They go to Cassie’s room and lock the door behind them.
Dean wonders if he should be worried, too. Whatever is affecting Cas is probably big. Bigger than anything he’s ever dealt with. He glances at Cas, who’s just fiddling with his cell phone, looking out the window. He looks like a man to him. Sometimes hunting partner. His friend.
“Are you?” Cas hums, noses along Dean’s cheek. Dean closes his eyes, smiles.
Or maybe he could, if someone,

"Sap," he says, voice almost breaking. Cas comes after him, putting an arm over his middle, cheek on his shoulder. He doesn't ask if that's alright - thank someone. Dean doesn't think he could survive the embarrassment if he did.
“We found a clue to the case. He shouldn’t have gotten upset with you because he found out about a detail two hours later than he wanted.”
“Aw, don’t pretend to be the angel perching on my shoulder
“Going to shower?” Cas asks, when they pull away. Dean nods, mind already going somewhere else.
Dean sucks his teeth, tired mind struggling to think of options. He’s slumped against Cas, cool air on his feverish skin. The air conditioning unit is rattling on one side, Cas breathing on his other. For a moment, he can trick himself into thinking he’s okay.
"So I won't need them, my wings. Not right now." Dean nods. Sticks his hand in his pocket and shows Cas the keys to the car.
“So you fell,” Castiel says, after an hour into the trip. The roads are flat, and Anna is not the conversation partner that Dean is.
"I'm fine," Sam says. He's not exactly gritting his teeth while he speaks, but.
Cas pauses. "The mechanics?"
"But then what about your scrapbook?" Dean mocks, leaning against the fence and watching however many tons of water spill down into the rocks below. Apparently it's better on the Canadian side, but Dean takes what he can get.
"I don’t think it had to end this way. Maybe if none of us meddled…”
"I told you to be careful,” Cas says, frowning, tucking the medallion into his pocket.
*Sonics do exist in California. I was surprised, too.
They don’t make any other big stops on the way. It’s mostly business. A ghost in Wyoming, some banshee in Oklahoma. They ride through Austin on their way to a haunting in Corpus Christi and Dean pulls up to some strange sculpture made up of junk, sprawling and glittering in the summer sun. Cas gets a new disposable camera at a gas station across the road and takes a picture. Maybe he can put it in his journal.
"Dunno. You'd think if someone just appears from the ether it would give off some weird mojo or something, right?" They circle back to the little farmhouse and try out other sprawling routes. Dean isn't sure what he's expecting to see, if anything at all.
“Yeah, well. If being a human is so fucking great, why don’t you just do it?”
Cas gets out, walking to the four way intersection like something’s leading him there. The foliage is pretty dense, but there's no rustling in the bushes like Dean expects. Not even the buzz of cicadas.
“And it’s definitely not some pagan sacrifice bullshit?”
“I think so. One of them, Ellen, said she knew some hunters who specialized in them that would want to be made aware.”
“Do you even need to do that?” Cas isn’t sure what he means, which is what he tells him. Dean’s jaw clenches. It’s a look he gives to witnesses that are being pointedly obtuse, monsters that think they’re being clever. People he doesn’t like. “You don’t get anything from keeping up the act." Still, all Cas can do is blink at him. He has never been a good actor, he wants to say, this is all there is to him.
all cheap charm without the magic attached.
“No, I need to follow up on the books here.” There it is. Dean grabs his duffel, scans the room for anything else before walking to the door.
“I try,” Dean returns, happily.
Sam has a theory as to where her Grace may have gone to; they can retrieve it, and with her power restored, Anna will be protected. Castiel thinks of the angels that wanted to drag him back to Heaven, that would have succeeded, had Dean not been there, and doesn’t say anything.
They stop in Chicago. Dean had been before, a few times. Cas takes them to the Art Institute because it's free the first Saturday of every month. They stop in front of that bigass painting made up of dots that the kids from Ferris Bueller stared at. Dean buys the postcard, scrawls out a message. Debates sending it. He makes them eat deep dish pizza and laughs at the journey Cas’s face goes through when he realizes the sauce is cold.
Wordlessly, they go to the Impala. Dean pops the trunk and they grab salt, gasoline, a box of matches. Dean opens the freezers and salts the parents, the sisters. The gas makes his eye water. He feels a headache pounding behind his eyes by the time they’re done. They hike back up the stairs. Dean lights the entire row of matches, staring down at the basement. He tosses it in and the fire starts immediately.
"Your father seems difficult to please," Cas says at length.
Outside camp, they hear a scream.
Dean stuffs the rest of his clothes in the machine. Sniffs the collar of his t-shirt, frowns, and peels that off and throws it in, too. He fumbles in some quarters and it rumbles to life. He tries to suppress a yawn, eyes tearing up.
Dean doesn’t say anything either. But he does squeeze back.
Cas can’t swim so well - enough to propel himself gracelessly through the water, and of course breathing is an optional activity for him. Dean tries to show him how to do something more advanced than a doggy paddle, and Cas splashes him on accident, and Dean splashes him on purpose, and any attempt at lessons devolve into wrestling and tugging at each other amidst the waves.
"And lucky for you, you already got a ride."
me: you said plot?? emotional manipulation and plot???
Cas looks at him, then swallows. "I'm beginning to have some concerns," he admits.
"Do you sleep in your car often?"
” Dean says, impatient. “And did you hear them? Rude bastards.”
Then - Lucifer.
Castiel tucks his wings back, somewhere Dean can’t see them. “Maybe,” he says.
“Taught me how to pick locks,” Cas counters.
“All of that power, you gave it up to be human?”

He was never a good man, not really - he’d dress up his selfish wants in a brand of selfless sacrifice, but he only ever really held back due to guilt, expectations. Now there’s nothing that can stop him, and as Cas breathes into his mouth, scrabbling at his arms, his shoulders, trying to get them all-encompassingly closer, he knows that he’s going to finally, finally get what he wants.

“This car was made in the nineties.”
"Oh, you mean daddy's friend! I like her. She brings me candy, and she's always super nice." That was cute, but not very helpful.
"I did." she replied, sounding disappointed.
"Dean's been here about 4 years now. Since he was 25. First, he was in addiction and drug recovery, now we're working through his trauma from ages 5 through,," he flipped through his notebook, making sure he got it right, "Well, right before he arrived, just to make sure he doesn't relapse when he's released. Dean's making remarkable progress. He might actually earn supervised release soon."
"That's right."
"Everything." he answered solemnly.
Similar to Rowena and Anna, he led the unnamed cultist through the maze like a temple. For each section he collected skulls. Dean had a little more difficult than the other two, though. The cultist slid around at the slightest tap of the controller, but soon enough, he'd collected the skulls hidden around the temple. After he'd gotten them, it took him to a cutscene.
"What is the great hole?" he asked.
Ben shuffled in place, and rolled his eyes towards the ceiling, thinking, "Ummmm", he said, "Just that she was nice and brought candy... Oh! " he remembered, "And my mommy didn't like her so much, but I don't know why."

brightside? I got myself ahead 3 chapters and I'm workshopping the ending.
"Hands in the air!" he yelled.
"Hey guys. So I need a crowbar from Chuck, but he's using it to hold up his shelves and won't hand it over until I tell him you guys will be low-key tonight. Think you can?" he asked.
"Thanks, Castiel. The bathroom is just over there. You let me know if you need anything," Dean nodded and walked to where she'd pointed.
She immediately stopped all movement, "Me? Oh, yeah, no. I'm good. It's just one think to read about ghosts and a whole other thing to experience it!"
Dean walks closer to the devil. “Okay, then I’m your man.” And, because he simply can’t resist - “So. Do we seal the deal the usual way?”
"Do you really believe that?"
“Sure, you get the meatsuit and the tasty filling inside. Scout’s honor.” At Lucifer’s unamused expression Dean quickly lifts up the hem of his shirt, showing the repaired brand Cas had given him. “See? No way out. We kill Michael and I get the consolation prize of getting a new body after.”
“If that’s what we’re calling it these days. Spit it out.”
Cas smiles back, but this doesn’t feel like the clean break he gets at the end of most hunts.
“What’d the guy look like?” Dean asks. John’s eyes slide over to him, but he doesn’t return it.
The angel bends down, and with a gesture the devil’s trap is broken, and the iron circle has rusted away enough for Dean to step through.
**The talking mongoose was an alleged Tulpa from the 1930s named Gef that did have a 2002 article written about him in the Skeptical Inquirer :)
"I'm! Cassie, this is
“Dad gave me this hunt because he thought it was easy. Can’t come crawling back and tell him I couldn’t do it.” He rubs his face again. “Doesn’t even know you’re out here with me. No, we can do this.”
“Cassie,” she says, throwing her arm over the back of the chair to really show that she's settling in. “I have a name, you know, and it’s not ‘look’.” She logs on and pulls up an internet browser.
do something about it."
“You and Sam Winchester were always of great importance to the apocalypse,” Castiel gasps out, “it was always part of God’s plan.”
Cheryl lunges over Heather’s body, picks up Dean's pistol that was dropped. Cas moves forward.
Dean pauses. He has an idea where this is going. “Yeah?”
He paces the summoning circle, notes the advanced spell work he hadn’t seen in ages, the salt ring around that, the iron circle built into the concrete floor below. Even if he could call up an earthquake, the iron might manage to hold.
This summer is weird. Uniquely weird, for someone like Dean. He and Cas are attached at the hip for most of it, and they’ve been doing a lazy, looping tour of the continental US as May bleeds into June, July, August. They started at the Canadian border and steadily worked their way down. Maybe next month they’ll hit Mexico.
“We’ll call on the way back.” Neither of them move.
"I thought you had some shiny new business associates from downstairs that were helping you with that. It's still easier than what I’m about to do.” Dean can just about hear Sam’s scowl from the other end of the line.
“Nah.” Dean fiddles with the ring on his finger, spins it around his knuckle. “Dropped him off at a bus station and uh. That was it. He and dad argued, you know. Real bad. About him leaving us and everything. Kind of ruined the whole thing. So, uh. Yeah.” He coughs. “Dad apparently swings up there once in a while, to check in on him. Not that Sammy knows that.”
"They weren't good for you! They were gonna leave you anyway!"
He sits up. He's in a motel room. He's alone. And he doesn't know anything.
“Why didn’t you tell me about that?”
Hell was maze-like, an ever-morphing cacophony of blood and malice that functioned on entropic laws that angels were not made to comprehend, and one by one his brothers and sisters were slain, or lost.
Cas looks at him, blue eyes stormy. “He’s not my father, Dean.”
Dean swallows again. The AC clicks on to the left of him. He tells himself that’s why his skin is prickled with goosebumps now. “Yeah,” he breathes out, “yeah, Cas.”
Maybe one day he'll get a call and fly off to wherever and that'll be that. In the months between them working together, Dean liked the fact that Cas was a hunter, like him. Getting dumped by Cassie still stung when he thought about her, and leaving towns or friends or girls he liked sucked. But they were all rooted to that town, that state, that month he passed by. Cas isn't locked in like that. He can follow him anywhere, untethered, apparently unburdened by his past.
"Stay." he demanded, pulling the gun from the back of his waistband.
"It's nice to meet to meet you Anna, I'm Greg. You must be an angel, you couldn't have come at a better time."
"Boy, you better not be getting into trouble now." He greeted Dean. Dean knew better than to sass him, so he stayed quiet. The older man sighed deeply, "What is it now?"
As always warnings for this chapter are in the end notes.
"Hey, find anything?" he asked.
"There's no bones." Cas stated like he was commenting on the weather.
"Granda's rosary?" he asked.
He selected that one, and Anna's dialogue popped up "Sounds like someone is crying. I better go make sure they're okay." and she entered the door.
Dean could almost hear her thick accent through the game, "We've got a good chance, but it guarantees nothing, child. I think we might have some done it. Ach, I'm just ashamed I let things get this far. Your poor family, I’m sorry that Lisa had to get your wee one involved. If we stop this, their plans won’t come to fruition- they won't be able to perform the ritual for another thousand years."
Huh, neat, thought Dean. "Hey, Ben, do you know anyone named Anna?"
That got Cas's attention. He looked up from the microscope for the first time since Dean had entered the room, frowning deeply, "Dean, V is too old for you," he said entirely too serious.
"Behold!" Charlie exclaimed as she finished," The Super Gameboy Advance!" She handed it over to him.
Bobby reluctantly agreed, seeing no other option. They said their goodbyes and hung up. Dean sat back from the checks, planning to mail them off later, thinking about how he could dely the invigation. He could check on every resident? Yeah, he decided, that worked. He stood and stretched, making his way out.
"Crowbar, Chuck. Cas lent that thing to you a while ago, you know it should have returned by now"
"But won't that"
"I-" Dean didn't do the whole reassurance thing well, "I just want you to know that I understand. To be afraid, that is. And want to hide away from the world..." Dean carried on, he didn't know why, "And if you ever, I don't know, want to talk, I'm here for you."
"It'll protect you from evil in this world. You don't have to be afraid, as long as you have it." He put it around Ben's neck and the screen cut to the level select menu again.
"Who?" Dean asks.
He took a breath, said a silent apology to Mrs. Mills- stopping to close her eyes with his fingers, and walked the same path as the footsteps. Opening the door revealed more- getting lighter as they went down the narrow hall. He followed them until they disappeared, but darkness began.
“There are rumors,” Castiel tries, “within that tablet, within other magic rituals, of restoring a demon’s humanity.”
He also thinks, perhaps, he hears something.
how many times are you going to look me in the eyes and lie to me? (takes place around chapter 24-25)
“You said he was new to hunting.”
“Me neither,” Cas says, since he can only remember about a year back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What are you looking at?” he mutters, turning around. “Let’s keep going before this whole town goes to shit.”
“Demon - dude, what the fuck? I bring you up here because you went Girl, Interrupted on me and then you just take us on some weird side quest that pissed my dad off.”
“Something’s on your mind,” Cas says, when the only light left is just what’s being reflected off the lapping waves.
“He was in the same place at the same time. He said he was new to the business.”
"I'm sure there will be splinter cells from heaven and hell that will want to kill us," Cas offers, "so part of our time will be spent focusing on self-defense."
He was right - the blood on Cas’s shirt didn’t manage to come out.
Lust's taunt echoes in the air between them. "About?"
Dean feels like he’s too big, there’s too much, but Castiel remade his body well, with everything he had. It takes him in and he slowly fits himself back into his body. His senses return to him, more expanded than a human, but not as much as when he was just a roiling cloud of black.
“But what if…” He bites his lip. Dean is already focusing on the mechanics behind the radio. “What if it breaks again?”
“Yeah. He’s getting the other two. When he’s set he’ll find you.”
“Take me to any roadside attraction," he adds, after a moment of silence.
"Of course."
Cas sticks with Dean for a few weeks. The thing in Minneapolis is a Rawhead, stealing children, hiding in the dark corners of abandoned buildings. He got to use a taser for the (presumably) first time.
“We talked about trying to expand our tastes in media to listen to voices beyond the patriarchal system that favors White male mediocrity.” He thinks. “We did say Weezer is still pretty good, though.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The exposure to different things is helpful in learning what he likes, what he feels. He has words and models for things he didn’t before. He can think things like: spending time with Dean is like perfect weather and taking the first bite of your meal when you remember you're actually very hungry and peeling back your clothes to realize there's no cuts, no pain, just improbably perfect skin.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel stares at him, eyes so blue they’re electric, like neon lights, like a flash of lightning, like the impassive, unstoppable force of elements, joining and separating and colliding until the heat death of the universe. “Don’t you think it could be worth investigating?”
Cas hates Guinness more than he hates gin and tonics, but he chokes down the pint and Dean drinks enough to block out the burning Gillespie house and the look in John’s eyes and the thought of his brother until it’s just him and Cas stumbling down Market street and arguing over whose car to sleep in.
“I have to admit,” Lucifer tells him, “you weren’t the one I was expecting.”
Content warnings at  the end of  this chapter
Dean Winchester is his own beacon, of sorts. A being not meant to be kept in hell like the rest of humanity that have been doomed there. But the signals are confused, and bounce off the features of this realm, turning Castiel in circles.
“Okay, so she’s Catwoman in her spare time, big deal.”
Cas looks at him. He doesn't know what that expression is. Cas just nods. "Alright." He hesitates, then leans down to kiss Dean's mouth again. Fingers run down his cheek. "Thanks for telling me."
I don't actually have an outline for this story written anywhere and I think this chapter was conceptualized early enough that I was like hm, spn but make it hbo, until I remembered that my standards for gripping media is more on the level with like. Avatar the last Airbender and films directed by Greta Gerwig or Merchant Ivory Productions. So I don't think this fic is going to get in your face dark/twisted enough to actually be an hbo spn au. I mean anyone who wants to beta read for Tone and Mood *do* let me know.
“It’s part of the job,” Dean says, heart not really in it. Cas kisses him, then again, and again, and as much as Dean doesn’t want to think about it, the image of the shapeshifter wearing Cas’s face, that small, secret smile turned into a malicious smirk, is still burned into his mind. He presses close enough to Cas like if he just edges closer it’ll be erased, but that doesn’t work. Instead it makes him think of that crocotta they fought that took Cas's voice, the random civilian that had the same dark-hair-blue-eyes that got killed by a spirit. Hunts that didn't end with Cas dead but remind him it's always possible, for as indestructible as Cas appears.
There's a text burning a hole in Cas's pocket - only in the proverbial sense - but he does his research at the campus library and doesn't actually leave just yet. He doesn't know why.
Cassie calls him one night asking if he’s free and he tells her he’s on his way to meet Cas for some drinks, says she can always come along if she wants.
* "And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack" is the opening lyric to Talking Heads' hit song Once in a Lifetime, which takes a lot of its lyrics from Evangelical sermons (I guess Cas's lectures on new wave finally permeated into Dean's brain).
“I had ample time to… study your form,” Cas explains, serene. Dean flows into it, simple and easy, and Cas seals him inside. Dean hopes, distantly, third time’s the charm.
After a moment of concerted staring, Sam takes Cas's hand in his own, shakes it. "Sure, Casti - Cas. See you around." He holds up a hand. "Bye Dean."
presses down around  him. He shakes his head, forcing an amused scoff. He'd always been good at pressing Sam's buttons; he tries to remind himself that now isn't the best time to get back into practice. “There

annoyed with him.
"Something new," Cas says, "for the both of us. Imagine that."
"I'm dying either way. Know where I'm going, too." Her eyes squeeze shut for a second and another tear leaks out. "Fuck." She scans the room. Dean’s unarmed, and Cas must've stashed his weapon. Cas is watching her with an inscrutable expression.
“Some Marlboros and a pack of Trojans,” he says, grinning.
“Well, that’s more for me than anything,” he protests. He feels Cas smile against the skin of his shoulder. Dean turns his head to glare at him, and his smile goes even wider until it’s a full on grin. “Shut
In hell, breaking him had been a victory. They had gloated and cheered, and some in the know had waited for heaven to come for him. But he was too deep in the Pit. It took decades upon decades of him torturing souls, marring himself in the depravity of that realm, and when Castiel, the one surviving member of that suicide mission, had laid his hand upon him, there was nothing human for him to save.
Yes welcome to another chapter of self indulgence. If I had my way I would be writing silly little aus where all the action were characters talking in kitchens, but for some reasons I've trapped myself in a plot heavy fic that's way too long, and I wanted a break lmao.
there, trying to squeeze it.
Dean gestures to his chest, where there’s a few thin lines here and there. More on his back, other gashes on his thighs. Some of them are so old that you don’t notice them unless you’re actively looking. “Can’t damage the goods.”
expecting to get sacrificed to a shark monster in Oregon? Because I wasn’t.”
“Then what? Sounds like she just brought her sister back ‘cause she couldn’t deal. Made some sort of, what, demonic ritual thingy to get some witchy powers and quick riches? She killed her parents.”
“That’s fine,” Castiel returns, shooting her a look that makes her mouth snap shut. “As you said, angels can’t do that, either.”
"Dean?"
"We waited to have the reunion sex until I was in my own body. I don't know what you're bitching about." Five birds start squawking and pecking at each other over the food. Dean smiles.
“Every angel is on a mission from god,” Cas murmurs, “but how we act it out…” The skin around Cas's eyes tighten, pink lips pulling into a frown. He looks around the parking lot, the dead husks that had been demon puppets a few minutes ago. “Let’s get moving.”
The words aren't exactly words, aren't quite spoken, but Castiel hears them anyway, even over the screams of the demon its cornered. A full fledged demon, one that has existed for at least one thousand years, if Castiel can still ascertain things right, and it cowers against the Righteous Man, its form splayed open and oozing, dying, if it were able to really die like this.
Then: “It’s also not a desert.”
The Home rewrite is Done. Next to the Pilot I think this was one of the first eps I started writing scenes for - specifically when Dean tries to call John, can't get through, and calls Cas. Like your absent god-father figure isn't here! But your boyfriend definitely is. Next chapter? Cas's B plot begins in earnest >:)
He ends up searching through the stacks for an open computer for a good ten minutes. Just when he’s about to drop himself in front of one, a woman tugs out the seat and moves to sit down. “Whoa, I was gonna use that.”
Cassie stares at him, like she's reading his face. “You’re serious.”
no cushy position, Sam. It’s hell. And those bastards wanted me to turn into - this.” He gestures. “Or, start to. Righteous Man shedding blood in hell is what kick-started the whole thing." His brother looks up at that.
"Sometimes?" Dean tries to think about it, but really, he gives Cas some of his food, or they swap meals halfway through. He knows some of his shirts and sunglasses are now in Cas's possession, and he'll change the tires or oil in that stupid Honda because Cas doesn't know how, but that's just practical, isn't it? He says as much to Cas, who shakes his head all fond.
*So! This is my Route 666 rewrite, aka the first of many crimes bucklemming must answer to when they finally shuck this mortal coil. Warnings for talk of racism/hate crimes and I don't know how many readers may just not want to revisit this episode in any way? I think it offers something in terms of character work but plot-wise you can skip this chapter and not lose anything of the overarching story, promise.
Again Dean led her through the maze, hitting the button before moving on to the next section. This time the voice read, "Walk with me into the undying flame and our power shall be endless."
"Did you ever think maybe your old man wanted you to follow your own dreams?" Dean asked.
"There's no trace of the officers that were here when you moved in either," Charlie explained, "not even in classified police records. It's like they don't even exist."
Dean moved her through the electrified maze, tapping the controller as she was harder to control than anyone else he'd played as. Her level had a button to press. Then the doorway opened up.
"Goodbye, Dean." and then she disappeared. He felt weird in this room by himself, so he left and headed up to 504.
The ghost of the woman kept sobbing, "It's kind of you to say, but I know better than that now."
"Well, boy, I ain't seen anything like that before. I'll look into it and you stay out of trouble, you understand?"
"I'd actually like to help instead. C'mon man, I won't tell anyone- You gotta talk to someone, eventually." Dean was uncomfortable, but it felt like the right thing to say.
@thatonetransguy
"Mrs. Mills?"
"I have retrieved the remaining assets." Said the cultist. In front of them stood Cas's mother, and a woman with long, straight hair that had to be Lisa, and Mr. Mills. The skulls Dean had retrieved and more cultists surrounded them.

"Please, call me Anna."
"Oh, I didn’t for you to see that yet. It's a portable amplifier with custom effects that will be on your guitar. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait. I'm still expecting parts in the mail. Besides, we have more important things to focus on right now. Are you ready?" she asked.
Dean wasn't sure how to answer that, but he'd come this far. There was no reason to turn back now.
"Do you need a moment?" He asked, "It can be a lot to take in."
"Please," its voice was weak and raspy, "end my suffering. Please. Please, pull the plug."
"Uh, yeah... I guess, Cas." He was pretty confused himself, but he decided it was time to check out the hole in the bedroom of 504, so he headed up.
"Alright then. Charlie, you go with Cas. Two brainiacs are better than one. Gabe, you're with me. We're gonna find out as much as we can and report back to the nerds. Sound good?"
Author's note and disclaimer:
Once he got down to the basement, however, there was no one in sight. Dean made him cut the power line, but he couldn't use the elevator again. He tried the door one door, but someone had locked it, the other opened to reveal Rowena alone in an empty room.
"D-dean," he answered timidly through his cracked door, "W-what can I d-do for you?"
"I'd say I'm sorry to hear that, but I doubt you'd accept it." Dean said, leaning his head back against the stall.
Castiel sighed, saddened. "You're right, he's in some vegetative state. Maybe the Gameboy will work?"
The council all wore hoods. They spoke together.
"Clearly not us." Cas replied in a deadpan voice. Both Dean and Gabe looked at him like he'd grown two heads. "Am I not allowed to be humorous?" At the silence from the other two he huffed and stood- helping Dean up off the ground, "Crowley punched Dean and I was going to report it before you came crashing into us."
"No," he stood up and looked over Charlie's shoulder at the screen, "he wasn't even able to get it open."
"Bobby!" Dean exclaimed, "You scared the **** out of me!"
"The... water...it...stopped...I'm...so...thirsty."
"Sorry I must have doze off, I finished my test early."
Maybe he could get the fucking crowbar back now without issue.
On his way out of his dad's room, he grabbed his dad's gun, just in case. He reached under the bed, grabbing it and something else. It surprised Dean when he pulled out a picture of his mom. She wore a white sundress and a large sunhat. She looked happy. He thought his dad had gotten rid of all of her pictures. He stroked the picture.
Mary hugged Dean tightly and let him go back to playing while they waited for his dad and Sammy to show up. She called out to him when he got too close to the forest, but he didn’t hear her and kept on running, butterflies battering in his tummy.
"What is so interesting about a rubix cube you had to send a picture?" one read
"The other side?"
The screen faded to black for a moment. When it resumed, the cultist that had stood in the center was now a black mass of misshapen limbs that seemed to flicker in and out of existence- their face gone. The other cult members slowly backed away, but the council stayed, resolute. And the game cut to the level select menu again.
@that_one_transguy_o
Avoiding them, Dean led him to the power line on the other side and made him cut it. He did this for every floor, even though as he moved down there were more and more cultists on each floor.
"Hello?" He called out- he'd nearly forgotten about the person crying, but they were still crying fairly hard, Dean couldn’t just ignore it.
"I know," Castiel replied pinching his nose, "We better make this quick, I don't think I can stand this very long."
“That’s right. He waited so long that even God thought he’d forgotten. But Cassius he stared God in the eye and exclaimed so all of heaven and all the earth heard ‘I am the Angel of tears, angel of temperance, I will preside over the death of kings and I will be parton to those overlooked, or those in weakened. Orphan children and the enslaved, the poor and downtrodden, the oppressed and the unjustly persecuted!’ Now, Dean- remember God is all-knowing, so he smiled. Proud of his son and allowed it.”
As she spoke, her mouth opened, not to reveal a tongue and teeth as Dean had been expecting, but an undying and never ending darkness that he felt strangely comforted by.
"-e w--- ---h- a--el-, ---y a-- n-t wh--t ---y s---." it said.
Dean decided it was time to go talk to Charlie again. He tried knocking on her bedroom door, but he didn't receive an answer. He could hear her typing though, so he walked in, announcing himself so he didn't startle her.
"It worked!" Dean cheered. He went to fist bump Charlie, but her mouth fell open and her eyes widened. She was motionless- in shock.
"Wait a sec, I've seen that before, he wears it when I talk to him, but I'm pretty sure I've seen it somewhere else." Dean thought aloud.
"Those sandwiches are fishier than the Kraken's crack," Gabriel stated, "we need to figure out what's in them. Hopefully, though, it's just a bad batch of beef- or goats. I'm just hoping it doesn't haunt us. "
(See the end of the chapter for
"Do you remember anything else about her?" Dean asked.
He bowed his head, "That's awful kind of you, Ms. Milton. I'm terribly sorry about your parents."
They said their 'love you's and the screen cut to black and resumed with Jody now alone in the empty room. "I have to gather some evidence first if anyone is going to belive this."
If Dean were being honest, he really didn't know how to feel when the toilet suddenly grew 10 feet and sharp teeth and swallowed him whole. Really, it gave quite a shock. He now stood in the sewer, on an elevated, thankfully dry, platform. The liquid flowing next to him was a sickly, glowing green. He looked into it and saw something floating inside. Was... was that an eyeball ? He asked himself, horrified. He decided ignoring the things floating in the toxic waste was going to be for the best for now. He swore he heard a baby crying somewhere.
"Greg and his son. Oh god!" She cried, "I was an idiot for falling for a married man!"
"Hey, I got the crowbar," he announced as he stepped into the other boy's room. "and about the puzzle box.." he trailed off.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dean, have you met me? Of course I can." She replied, fingers flying across the keyboard again.
"Is he-"
The bathroom in question was just like the one in Dean's own apartment- but longer, like it went on forever. Maybe it did, but Dean didn't care. He was here to fix the toilet. Someone broke the lid, and it was overflowing- spilling dirty, brown-ish green water on the floor. It honestly reminded Dean of Addison tea, except more of a liquid. Gross. There was a plunger in the middle of the floor. He didn't trust it- but he picked it up, anyway. He needed it to get the toilet unclogged.
mentions of food.
"You nerds find anything interesting?" he asked.
Dean wasn't sure how to respond to that, but he had to say something. "Me, too, kid. Me too."
Dean went to the third floor to 302 Chuck's place and knocked firmly on the door. He was always a little harsh, but he didn't quite know why.
"Ditto," Charlie said, "meet up in my room later?"
"Huh, yeah actually. He enjoys knowing the names. I'm not gonna ask how you got this, though. You don't seem like the type to own a cat."
"Who are you?" She asked, talking through the slit in her throat. Dean ignored the wet sound of skin flapping.
Dean sighed heavily. He was almost glad Sam brought it up, so he wouldn't have to. "It's still fuzzy for me, dude, but I'm pretty sure it was after..." Dean let himself trail off and he looked away so he wouldn't have to see Sam's face fall. "Bobby said you reminded him of mom. But, uh, don't blame Bobby, he didn't know where Dad had taken you. And as soon as he did..."
Dean glanced over to Garth for help, but the young therapist only shrugged and made ushering hands for Dean to say something. Dean shook his head, not knowing what to say. While he and Garth went through this, Sam had apparently thought of what he wanted to say and spoke up.
"Dean, we have all the same classes. You have homework." Cas supplied, knowing Dean had already finished it- having watched him do it.
Instead of answering, she posed her own question, "What is the truth worth to you?"
“That can be arranged. And the second?”
Castiel glares at him. His status within heaven is questionable now, but he

no longer having to be pinned in place. In this form, he can see the blankets of Grace, the beings above who want Castiel. They’re all chanting for him, and Dean catches snippets of their conversation, their thoughts, their disgust at the sight of Dean, the Righteous Man twisted and broken until he’s no longer even considered a man.
The demon, this close, squeezes at Castiel’s insides, peers into his innermost self, and sees these thoughts as if they were his own. “Not so fast,” he says. “You came here to do something for me.”
Castiel thinks he might even be alright with it. He thinks of Dean's face, the way his mouth trembled when he said,
***My Own Private Idaho, while not an explicitly queer film, definitely became a cult classic due to a lot of its queer themes in having River Phoenix be a sex worker with primarily male clientele while also having some level of unrequited feelings for Keanu Reeves' character. This, combined with being in a lot of ways a roadtrip movie through various parts of the US seemed to be something Dean could've gotten talked into seeing and then would have just Thought About For Six Months Straight.
“I can tear you apart,” he says. “You angels have been causing a big clusterfuck up there. But you’re the only one left. You’re so weak that I could put you right on a rack. Make you scream until you come apart. Until you're nothing. I could swallow you and your Grace whole. I bet it’d make me stronger.” Like this, Dean doesn’t have a mouth, not really.
