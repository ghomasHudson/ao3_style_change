Sherlock dodged to the side, spinning away and putting John once again at Townsend's back. This time, Townsend’s body and blade moved as one, whipping around, and the wicked barb of the sword sliced clean across Sherlock's torso, leaving parted fabric and a long, bloody line in its wake.
‘Your phone, though, is new. Top-of-the-line and the latest model. You thought I didn’t see it when you came in. You tucked it away, but not quickly enough, I’m afraid. Your perfume, too, tells a different story than your appearance. It’s the same one as when we first met. A deliberate choice. All of it. An effort to appeal to my sentiment.’
Sweat and blood, cement dust and the raucous press of the crowd. The bloom of bruises and the pain of punches thrown and landed. Mycroft would be appalled, which only made a grin tug Sherlock’s bloody lips.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. Sadly, John was right. He sounded like someone imitating a cough, rather than anything more serious. Still, it was yet another expected symptom, and one that had turned up on schedule. 'How about your breathing?'
John growled, shaking his head as he lowered the gun and took a step forward, waving it vaguely as he gesticulated. ‘Yeah, no. All right, yeah, but Fae’s one thing. I can see how a few might linger on, causing trouble. There’s enough humans around with a little bit too much power to not have a bit of Fae blood in them, but this? You?’
Yes, they had survived Mary's deceit, but it had not been an easy task. Her belittlement of it – the subtle, snide implication in her voice – honed the edge of his temper, and he narrowed his eyes as he looked not just at the image she presented, but beneath, stripping away the well-constructed facade without mercy.
Sherlock's dense silence lasted for several long moments before he finally replied. 'Yes, and you saved me in the process.' He tightened his grip on John's hand, offering mute support as he continued to speak. 'Mary had painted herself into a corner. There was only one possible way out of it. Mycroft would never have given her the file, and she would not have backed down. Without your intervention, she would have pulled the trigger and seen it through to completion. Not a victory for her, but not one for you and Mycroft, either. A no-win scenario. We could all see that, and you took the only course of action that could alter the outcome.'
Mary was pregnant. Obvious. The truth wrote itself within the outlines of her body and the quirks of her behaviour. Easy to write off as wedding jitters to most, but there was more to it if you cared to observe.
No CCTV monitored the site, nor were there any other watchful eyes that he could see. After a moment's hesitation, he reached for his Sig, settling it comfortably in his hand as he continued to creep forward. There was no sign of Mary, but he had not expected to find her standing outside in broad daylight. The address she'd given pointed him to the warehouse on the north side, and he picked his way towards it, every sense flung open for even a hint of danger.
'A bad lady. Sherlock thinks she might know something about why people have been watching us. The sooner we find out more, the sooner we can go...' He paused, his throat pulsing around the word "home". Of course, the building Rosie had known as home all her short life was gone. 'Well, we'll see.' He clenched his hands into fists atop his knees. He couldn't face all that now, the sheer mess of insurance claims and God knew what else.
Something settled around his shoulders, smelling of cheap detergent, and he blinked at the hideous orange blanket someone had draped over him. It was coarse, but warm, and he murmured his thanks as Sherlock eased himself down to perch next to John on the tailgate of the van, sheltered by the twin doors flung wide on either side.
‘Yep.’ Greg had his arms folded, practically hugging himself. All of them, even Sherlock, were wearing all the body coverings for forensics. None of them could afford a fuck up, not on a case like this: a media wet-dream.
Yet would John consider it now, after all that they had been through? Would he still be open to the risk, or would he have the sense to retreat and chase his vision of a normal life? That had been what Mary represented, after all. A steady, sensible prospect: an opportunity for everything John thought he needed. Yet John did not seem to resent the disintegration of the relationship. At the time, the only thing that Sherlock had managed to deduce was a sort of wistful relief.
Sherlock watched her, trying to deduce what had caught her attention even as he considered the possibility of escape. The chair he was bound to was sturdy oak, unlikely to break no matter the force he used. Nor had he managed to locate any sharp edges in his surroundings that might help him cut the zip ties free. His feet remained untethered, but Mary had taken extreme care to remain out of range of any kicks, and he doubted his bleeding leg could support his own weight, let alone anything else.
Sherlock hurdled some chimneypots; his mind working to plot routes and analyse the surface beneath his feet. It was as much a mental exercise as a physical one: a rare union where his mind and his transport could work as one. Even after years of practise, he still found a simple thrill in running the roofs.
Relying on both John and Sherlock to be adequately distraught had been the biggest risk in this plan. They'd made the whole thing as believable as possible, her and Vivian, but there was still a chance one of them would figure out the deception.
Besides, he could admit the grey hairs gave him a touch of civility. Made him look a bit less like a school-boy scurrying after the police on every case. The passing years had their benefits, he supposed.
'Your lunch will get cold,' Sherlock murmured after they’d been sitting there for about fifteen minutes.
Spent, at least for the time-being, he was happy to relax, his busy mind wiped blank by John’s attentions. To say he was skilled at the art of pleasure would be a gross understatement. At some point in his youth, within the long, awkward cusp of adolescence, John had discovered his talent for sex. Yet that alone could only take him so far. It was clear, to Sherlock at least, that he had spent the intervening years honing his skills and mastering the craft.
He couldn’t say what made him do it. Some instinct, perhaps. A desperate need to hold on to Sherlock, who always seemed to be on the brink of leaving. With a quick twist, he pulled his jacket free and grabbed Sherlock’s hand, matching his stride as their fingers entwined.
'I cannot tell you much. I only know what Mary deigned to tell me, and it becomes clearer with every day that she kept her own confidence. However, I do have the name of the group who were watching Doctor Watson. Their proper name.'
Had they been watching Mary? Had there been pictures of her on the wall, removed once she was no longer living, or did this group, whoever they were, focus solely on John and Rosie: Mary's family? Her weakness?
John's protest sounded thin to his own ears, and his throbbing body screamed a different story. Perhaps he was not seriously wounded, but he had taken a harsh beating: bruised and battered. His heart was not much better. A constant ache lived beneath his ribs, and even the warm press of Sherlock's frame in a seam down his side, shoulder-to-hip, could not ease it.
'Too much information, or perhaps too little.' Sherlock frowned. 'It's like trying to read through frosted glass, all obscure. I can't see what's right in front of me.'
Quickly, John pulled his phone from his pocket, snapping as clear an image as he could manage of both the sword and the picture before ferreting the device away once more. He did not think Winters had seen him. She was too busy answering Sherlock's questions, her eyes dry now and the tissue John had given her crumpled in her fist. A weak smile still lay pinned upon her lips, but it was clear her patience with Sherlock's interrogation wore thin.
‘You’re high.’ John eased him back onto the uncomfortable hospital bed, little more than a bench with notions of grandeur. ‘Get your head down. It’ll be a while before they can wrangle someone to decide what to do with you.’
'I – I –' She pushed her spectacles up her nose before folding her hands back onto the tabletop. Her thin lips vanished entirely as she pursed them, her body held rigid as if she were resisting the desire to slump where she sat. 'She should not be here.'
Who had he been punishing? Sherlock, for going away? Himself for still caring one way or the other? In the end it was just resentment, and it took this – a bloody stupid virus and Sherlock's quiet ministrations – to finally kill it once and for all.
Glassy light greeted him: a vivid illumination that stripped away every veil. There were other beds in the small ward, but John paid their occupants no mind. He couldn’t. Not when Sherlock lay so still and quiet.
True to his word, it was clear that Mycroft's people had been here. The nest of quilts they had left on the living room floor were gone; no doubt replaced on their respective beds. The heating had been turned on and take-away boxes disposed of. Wood lay in the grate ready to be lit, and though John could see no sign of their searching, he suspected that any remaining surveillance devices had been removed.
'Yeah, no.' John shook his head, his next inhale a too-short gasp. Panic simmered just below the surface: Sherlock could see it as clear as day, despite John's best efforts to keep a lid on it. 'We need to bind this for a start. Clean it. Stitch it. All that.' His fingers trembled, knotting in the denim over Sherlock's knee, and Sherlock leaned forward, enfolding him in a clumsy embrace.
He'd cuff them away, lips twisted, feeling he didn't deserve the relief they could bring. He hadn't been good to Mary when he'd had her. He didn't deserve to mourn her like that. A decent husband would not feel the way he did: sad and aching but – at the same time – somehow free.
Mary's jaw shifted as if she were chewing over her words. Her eyes flickered up and to the left, but no more excuses were forthcoming. Inch-by-inch, her body relaxed, her shoulders rounding as she let out a weary breath. For the first time since they had walked into Baker Street, she succumbed to an air of defeat.
Sherlock's pocket magnifier glinted in his gloved grip as he wielded it. 'Since she was killed in her fencing gear, there's far less likely to be relevant particulate matter under her fingernails etcetera.'
A shudder ran through John’s body, and he snatched in a choked breath. It felt sparse and insignificant. Cold on his lips and dead in his lungs. God he just, he felt so useless! He’d only just got Sherlock back, for fuck’s sake. Now the aggravating git was lying at death’s door.
They were the ones the old fairy tales were written about. The ones full of blood and warnings about sharp indifference and empty promises. They sure as bloody hell weren’t meant to be flatmates or friends or whatever the hell else John had believed.
A sob scraped up John's throat, and Sherlock flinched as Rosie joined her father in his tears. John's were silent: great, shuddering things as he pressed his hands over his face, trying to hide. Sherlock dithered before scooping Rosie from her high chair and cradling her against his chest. She clung to him with banana-smeared fingers, but gradually his warmth and gentle shushing eased her fear: more likely brought on by John's shouts than anything else. She, at least, was easy to comfort.
Part of him wanted to snatch Rosie from the high chair and flee, to escape the confrontation he knew loomed on the horizon. Despite his earlier convictions, he didn't feel ready to face Sherlock. Not now and maybe not ever, but here he was, left with no choice in the matter. All he could do was stand there and stare, scowling as he took in all the little ways in which Sherlock had changed over the past few weeks.
Someone was breaking in. It seemed too early in the evening for burglary. A thief after valuables would wait until they were certain everyone was asleep. No, whoever this was, they knew the building was occupied. They weren't after things, but people.
Sherlock's annoyance made itself plain in the prim manner of his speaking: long words and haughty arrogance, but it did not look like the irritation that came about when he thought someone was being tiresome. His eyes were too soft for that; his expression too open. Instead, he seemed angry on John's behalf: a stalwart defender – as always.
It was what normal people did, wasn’t it? Looked for someone to share the rent? In London it was that or sell your kidney for the privilege of a measly little bedsit. Mike’s friend was not normal though, not by a long shot. He was…
'Mary?' He spoke softly, knowing the echoes would carry his voice. It bounced up to the roof, startling a pair of roosting pigeons, but otherwise there was no response to his call. John cleared his throat, not allowing his circling doubts to encroach. He knew he was in the right place, and he had got here in time, though admittedly only just. Yet all that awaited him was this empty, hollow space and a growing dread that filled his chest and tried to climb up into his mouth.
He considered it. The silence stretched out, moments becoming minutes as John chewed on his lip. Sherlock did not pressure him; he did not utter a word. He simply stood awaiting John's banishment.
His pinched, cunning smile held an edge of desperation, and John wondered what it cost him to put his brother's safety in John's hands. He did not ask questions, merely stood there, poised on parade rest as Mycroft explained.
If Sherlock was right, and he always was, this destruction was both precise and personal. ‘My money’s on family. A brother or sister. Maybe a kid. This is…’ John wrinkled his nose, wishing he could put a finger on what his gut was telling him. ‘Petty?’
With a deep, shuddering breath, Mary tied her hair back and slipped off her wedding ring. Personal effects would be returned to John later, and she tried not to think about the shock and pain that had carved his face asunder. She tried not to recall the way his hands shook, nor the half-hidden flatness of disbelief in his gaze. Rosie at least, was too young to remember her, too young to mourn her. She left no real scars there, but John?
'They've had enough, Mary. Their tolerance began to wane days ago. I wish I could say with some confidence that they intended to remain true to their word, but I doubt it. They'll discard you as soon as they have what they want and destroy you if you stand in their way. What do you think you are to them? An asset, or an impediment?'
For a few, tense seconds, he wondered if this was where it all went wrong. If this was where these people turned around and told him that someone else had already picked Rosie up and driven off with her. A moment later they returned, carrying Rosie and her bag before surrendering them both to him with a smile and a cheerful "See you tomorrow!"
'I mean, obviously, if it's what you prefer... but wouldn't it be best to remain as we are until we're sure the fever has gone? Your health could still take a turn for the worse.'
So he managed by himself. Normally, he seemed fine. He coped. Sometimes he even thrived, but these slumps always came back, abyssal and miserable. At least last time he’d had the energy to shoot the walls, and John never thought he’d be grateful for that. Now he just lay there, snarling abuse at anyone who acknowledged his existence.
She sighed, a world-weary noise like a mother who was tired of her toddler throwing an unnecessary tantrum. 'Well, at least I tried. Perhaps this will change your mind.'
Sherlock pressed a cup of tea into his hands, and John guzzled it gratefully. Caffeine: an acceptable addiction. God, it was all so fucking arbitrary sometimes. From coffee to alcohol, nicotine to sugar – they could all have strange effects on the body and mind. Though, he had to admit, mostly they were locked firmly in the realms of sedatives or stimulants. The kid who had staggered into his surgery today…
'What's the plan?' he demanded, his fingers curling over the edge of the seat as he rounded his shoulders, meeting Mycroft's gaze with steady determination. 'And don't tell me you haven't got one. You and Sherlock are just the same. You prepare for any eventuality.'
'But she will.' John glanced at his watch. 'Mycroft should be getting that evidence soon. I doubt it will take long for Mary to figure out her list has been compromised.'
Yet as sentimental and flawed as his response had been, Sherlock could not bring himself to regret it. Perhaps his caution had not been what the case required, but his compassion had been the answer to the rift in his and John's friendship. Now, though their relationship was still raw, possibly forever changed by all that had passed between them, it was whole once more.
A fire glowed in the grate, chasing off the damp edge to the air that lingered in Baker Street. Nothing disturbed the peace but the gentle crackle of the flames. No chattering radio or grim reporter on the BBC waxing lyrical about sacrifice: like any of it ever made any difference.
Very little came back to him: shadow and fear, mostly, but he did remember pleading with Sherlock – no, with Sherlock's ghost. He recalled that now: the absolute conviction that Sherlock was dead – that he had never returned from his fall at Bart's and John remained alone. His breath hissed between his lips as an echo of grief, and his body shuddered anew under the roil of emotion.
Mary's knowledge of codes had been the first indication that she was more than she seemed, but her preferences lay in complex ciphers. John was a military man: a doctor and a front-line combatant. Clear communication was key, and in those rare times encryption became necessary...
'I could have just... wounded her.' John swallowed, prodding at his uncertainty like a sore tooth. 'Distracted her with a flesh wound, bought us some time...'
He neither confirmed nor denied her accusation. He didn't dare, because the words that would split his lips would not be calm statements. For the first time in his life, he could taste his anger like blood upon his tongue. Every breath wanted to become a snarl in his throat, and he could barely see for the rage clouding his vision.
It was a second room for fencing, from the look of it. Equipment ranged along the walls, leaving the floorspace clear. Lines marked in paint delineated the arena, almost lost under the splatter of blood. A young woman lay on her back, her face pale and her short hair ruffled. A mask in the corner of the room was probably hers, maybe thrown on the bench only to fall on the floor.
'Very well, Mister Holmes. If you give me ten minutes, I'll get everything set up. Dial in with your authorisation at nineteen-hundred hours.'
This time, it seemed the balance tipped in her favour. 'From a Greek unit who has been conducting a surveillance operation in London. They appear to be looking for someone or something connected to Mary Watson. The obvious conclusion is that you might know something about these... individuals.'
It turned under his grip, the lock disengaged, and Sherlock sucked in a deep breath, meeting John's gaze and giving one, quick nod. They both knew what to do.
'Which means they are confident they can bring about such a turn of events.' Sherlock scowled, dissatisfied with the idea of their forward-thinking. 'A notion which is not very comforting.'
'Let him go.' He sounded like a captain again, barking orders. It wasn't a plea but a command, and Mary's smile curdled. 'It's over.'
He glanced at John, a flicker of relief racing through him to see a familiar, proud smile curving those thin lips. Even Mycroft cast him a quick look of grudging respect, nodding his head in understanding.
With a grimace, John paced towards the kitchen, glad of the distance. It was easier to talk to Sherlock, sometimes, when he didn't have to meet that unapologetic scrutiny head-on. He set about putting together some dinner for them both. The soup from the hospital had been a paltry offering to a healing body, and Sherlock hadn't even had that much.
If that idea had occurred to Mary, she had clearly not given it any credence. Blinded by her own ambition, she had locked herself into a course of action that, in Sherlock's view, would end in disaster. His task was to get himself, John and Rosie untangled from Mary's plot.
Brown eyes flickered over to him, assessing behind the gentle fog of a few good beers, and John hid a grin in the froth of his own drink. He knew that look. Knew what it meant. Greg was considering something else, something to do with his love-life, probably, but he wasn't ready to share it, not yet.
Shamming wouldn't work, not bold tears or bright grins. They were only for the gullible: people too wrapped up in their own lives to see what went on around them. Mary had never fit into that category. Her cynical view of the world allowed her to act the part without ever being taken in by the emotions of others. She was right; in some unsavoury ways, they were very similar.
'God, you've got it bad,' he murmured to himself, slipping into the flat and smiling when he saw Sherlock stretched out on the sofa like some kind of effigy. Long fingers pressed together in prayer, resting against his lips as he lost himself in the vast sprawl of his mind palace.
John huffed a mirthless laugh at that blatant understatement. Mycroft was right. He doubted Mary would have shared her ideas with Harmattan. Even as a member of AGRA, she had always been playing her own game. It was safe to say that cooperation did not come easily to her. She had made that obvious when she tried to solve the Magnusson problem without assistance. 'So, what's the plan? We follow the splinter group to Mary and then... what?'
Stones bit into Sherlock’s knees as he fell to the ground at John’s side, his numb fingers searching for a pulse. Water dripped from his slicked curls, and his clothes clung to him. There would be time for discomfort later. Right now, he had more important matters to attend to.
A few more voices rose in greeting, hazy with sleep, and Sherlock held his breath, listening to the chatter: the overtones of camaraderie. This was no hastily assembled team, but a group used to the presence of one another – aware of the strengths and weaknesess of each individual and accustomed to the jagged edges of different personalities.
Selecting a line of approach, he pinned his body to the wall beside the door. He could make out Mary's voice: her volume steady and her tone traced with mockery. Yet beyond that, there was no other noise: no pacing or shifting. Grimly, John wished he could get one quick look into the room to know what he was up against, but he did not have that luxury.
Silence met his response. He could picture Mary with ease, her head tilted to the side and her eyes narrowed, turning his answer over in her mind and judging whether or not it was true. She had done the same thing more than once throughout their marriage, an almost-smile tugging at the corners of her lips even as her gaze remained mirthless.
Investigating the floor around it, he realised there was nothing to mar the concrete: no pressure plates or other gadgetry. Lifting his gaze upwards, he squinted at the holes in the roof in case someone waited up there, gun trained on him. No, he decided, the old corrugated metal could not take a person's weight. They would fall to their deaths before they could pull the trigger, and there was nowhere else from where someone could shoot him without being seen.
Perhaps some would see her absence as a curse, but he knew better. Irene’s absence was a blessing for him and John both.
'It's not your fault.' John jerked his head to the side: a quick denial. 'Not one, fucking bit of it is your fault.' He turned to face Sherlock, nudging him with his elbow. 'This, all of it? It's all Mary and me. She's the one who faked her own death and fucked off to God knows where, and I'm the one who was so angry that I shoved you away.' He ran his tongue over his teeth, hating himself. 'What do you think I would have done if I found out you were poking into the details of Mary's murder?'
John's weathered face was a greyish white, the colour of his oatmeal jumper, and those hands shook as he pressed them to his temples, no doubt attempting to come to terms with this latest crisis. He looked like a man about to crack open, spilling viscera across the floor.
That was Sherlock’s reaction to almost anything that didn’t involve blood and mystery and a heavy dose of danger. Normally, John tried to look on the bright side, but he had to admit, even he struggled to find any silver lining to this.
‘A couple of hours now.’ John shrugged, and Greg couldn’t look at him, not when John’s eyes were so full of helpless love. ‘He’ll have a horrible crick in his neck when he wakes up.’
'We didn't know whether to chase you off or put you in protective custody. Next thing we knew, the two of you were thick as thieves. We couldn't have pulled you apart with a crowbar, though I think Mycroft gave it some serious consideration.'
Downstairs, Sherlock shuffled around, making himself another cup of tea, perhaps, or merely pacing the kitchen as he organised his thoughts. The sight of him that morning, lost within the vaults of his Mind Palace when John came down for breakfast, was so familiar that John ached with it. He had not realised how much he missed Sherlock's presence; how much he relied on him, even now.
'Really, Mister Holmes, while I appreciate being kept informed, Mary's return has little to do with me. It changes nothing.'
Her behaviour seemed so at odds with Mycroft and Sherlock’s, or so he had once believed. He’d been too wrapped up in himself, he could see that now. First the war and his wound, then the finality of the fall. When Sherlock got back, John had busied himself with Mary…
'No, Sherlock. Just... no. Solve this so Rosie and I can get back to our lives. Make it the last thing you do for us. Then we can all be happy.'
'What if it's someone's body?' John asked 'Seems likely, doesn't it, considering where the coordinates point to?'
‘God, no.’ John grinned. ‘It’s Mummy’s birthday tomorrow, and Mycroft didn’t remind us of that fact until today, because he’s a smug git like that. We spent the whole afternoon tearing up and down Regent’s Street.’
Memory caught up to her, and a bitter smile wrenched her lips. The aquarium. Sherlock, cocky as always. The so-called villain, Vivian Norbury, and the pistol coughing, just once, in her grasp.
' Sherlock's fingers covered his knuckles, and he looked up into that clear gaze, unshadowed by dimming consciousness. 'It's just a scratch. I expected it, but his reach exceeded my estimate.'
Something told John that Mycroft did not intend to place anyone into custody. Nothing so prolonged would be involved when it came to justice, but he did not ask the question and remove all doubt: that wasn't his concern. Mary had made her bed and she could damn well lie in it, even if it did become her grave.
There had been such a slow inevitability to it all, their friendship evolving into something that refused the neat labels that others tried to pin upon them. They were not lovers, despite the suspicions of almost everyone they met. Friendship felt like too pale a word for it, insipid at best. No, even Sherlock himself, who spent his life categorising everything that passed his field of view, would struggle to name what he and John had. A bond that had survived more than most marriages could weather.
‘You think we’re looking for a doctor?’ Greg’s eyes pinched in disgust. ‘Wouldn’t someone notice a surgeon losing patients left, right and centre?’
'What would happen if the group became aware of your identity and your current situation? So far, an intermediary has protected you from their knowledge, and they've been distracted by their search. What would they do if they realised that you – the purveyor of the information they had purchased in the past – was being held in custody? Units such as theirs do, after all, rely on secrecy. What would they do to avoid becoming the target of scrutiny, I wonder?’ Sherlock paused. ‘You may think yourself safe in a maximum-security facility, Ms Norbury, but you would be surprised.'
John blew out a breath, taking another sip of his dwindling tea as his heart fluttered fretfully in his chest. It reminded him of things, right back at the beginning, when Sherlock had whirled into his life and shaken up everything John thought he knew.
He moved with a soldier's grace, his gun lowered, at ease for now but ready to bring to bear at a moment's notice. He did not expose his back to Mary: a blatant show of distrust. Instead, he traversed the short distance, not returning to Mary's side as she had no doubt hoped, but standing sentry just behind Sherlock's armchair. With that one decision, John made it clear who he believed.
She looked around at the students who were still making their way to lectures, and for the first time John picked up on the unease that permeated the atmosphere. It hung around like a storm cloud, whispers passing through lips like the distant hiss of falling rain. ‘Follow me.’
John would not understand. He would see the romantic – the sexual and nothing more. He would assume infatuation and fall into a funk of jealousy, as if he had some prior, unspoken claim to Sherlock’s affections that neither of them acknowledged.
Mycroft's men had managed to get control of the CCTV network, or at least some parts of it. Now, he could approach unseen, and if he wasn't mistaken, they were pointing the way, giving him clues to where the operatives thought Mary was hiding. Had they seen something to give away her location? Were they sure, or was it just their best guess? He'd take that over his own uncertainty any day of the week, and his boots scraped on the chipped concrete as he ghosted through the shadows, moving ever-closer to the heart of the airfield.
Misery was a crap word for what he felt. Grief’s sharp edges had worn smooth as days turned into months, and Sherlock stayed resolutely dead. It didn’t hurt any more. It was just this great weight he had to carry around with him. Or maybe he’d become immune to it, stuck as he was in this strange, border-place where the living met the dead, jealous of each other.
He watched for the nervous and twitchy, the ones who glanced a few times too often in their direction. He noted the faces of those who looked too stoic, their features pinched with concentration as if a friend had not died a few feet away and mere hours ago.
John watched the last of the blood drain from Norbury's face, leaving her as pale as the wall behind her. 'She could not do so without condemning herself.'
The members of the Yard looked at him, uncomprehending. Only John reacted, turning to Sherlock in surprise before staring at the vase. ‘Really?’
Darkness and light swirled across his vision, daubed with smears of colour. Snatches of sound rang in his ears as time stretched away from him, pulled thin only to clot anew. He skimmed the interface between sleep and wakefulness, locked in dreamlike confusion, but through it all he sensed Sherlock right there, within arm's reach. Just like he'd promised.
John wasn’t sure if that was Sherlock’s way of agreeing with him or not. Most four-year olds were, generally speaking, very nice. Except when they were squealing or putting socks down the toilet.
The idea of her stepping into the path of a bullet to save Sherlock? In hindsight, it was ridiculous. The woman had shot him herself, not so long ago. Oh, maybe John could make up some rubbish about her changing her tune once she realised what Sherlock meant to him, but there wouldn't be a grain of truth to it. That would require a level of empathy he doubted Mary could manage.
'Sleep, I think. You need it, too.' A weak smile toyed at John's lips, spreading to a grin as Sherlock glared. 'You look like you've been punched in both eyes.'
'You could be right,' he admitted, clearing his throat as he reached for his phone, his fingers flying over the keys as he sent out a few pertinent text messages. He knew who had been watching John's house: trusted individuals in his network, well-compensated for the earnings they may have lost dossing down elsewhere. Three in total, with strict instructions, for their own safety, not to intervene.
'Not unfamiliar, though,' John pointed out. Whatever else his wife may be, she was bloody clever. Not in the same way as Sherlock, all logic and deduction, but she was an expert in the art of secrecy. He shook his head to himself, still lingering on the strange, sharp edge between outright denial and raging accusation. He felt like he was swinging wildly from one to the other with every moment, with no stability in sight.
'You're being tracked, and not by anything so banal as "eyes on the target". You already found some of their listening devices when you snuck into Baker Street: state-of-the-art, expensive and well-maintained. That was only a small part of their true arsenal. It wouldn't surprise me if they know your precise GPS location in any given moment.'
Tiles clattered beneath his feet, their brittle protests loud in his ears, but Sherlock did not falter in his stride. Perhaps this was a mere practice run, a way to familiarise himself with a new stretch of rooftop, but slowing down was unthinkable.
'No.' John looked down at his daughter, rocking back and forth in the soothing way that seemed to have written itself into his bones the day she was born. 'Not in front of the screen, anyway. I'll try and get her settled out of sight. It's the best compromise I can manage.'
'I intend to split the force into teams. The smaller unit will monitor the perimeter. There are only two roads going in and out: one on the north, the other on the south. We will curtail any obvious routes of escape for either Mary or the splinter group.
Sometimes it was the war that daubed his dreams, all sandy tones and startling green, towering mountains and loud gunshots. Sometimes it was Sherlock's body, broken and bloody at the bottom of Bart's. Sometimes it was Mary's sad smile as she'd ended their engagement, her single accusation –
‘Bloody hell, no.’ John grinned. ‘Mycroft got him in with some Harley Street cosmetic surgeon at almost midnight. I dread to think what it cost, but with work like that, it probably won’t leave a mark. At least, it won’t as long as you leave it alone.’
'Sand, everywhere.' John hiccupped, not drunk but pleasantly buzzed. 'You'd come home for leave and still be finding it weeks later. Like the worst kind of beach.'
Its contents had not changed. Brief and to the point, they were designed to cut like a knife, carving away any uncertainty. There was nothing kind in John's note. Nothing to save Sherlock's feelings; why should there be?
'The Dean's office. I suspect she'll have plenty to tell us that the crime scene could not.' Sherlock pushed his way through the stately double doors at the end of the corridor, never pausing in his stride.
'Yes. There was plenty of documentation: photographs of you and Rosie. You've been under surveillance for a while. Their outfit was organised and well-equipped, suggesting they're not some small, vigilante group. Rather they are the spearhead unit of something bigger.'
.' Norbury's voice trembled as she jabbed her finger at the ground, indicating her current state of imprisonment.
'No, but she does have Sherlock. To an outsider, her taking him is a strong indication that he has what she wants. It's unlikely that the splinter group realise that Sherlock is in Mary's custody more as leverage than anything else. She does not seem like the type to share information freely.'
The "Greek Team" was a misnomer. In fact, to attribute them to any nationality was to make a faulty assumption. They acted above and beyond geographical and political borders, selling their services to the highest bidder. Extraction and capture. Espionage and sabotage.
He had no idea what kind of strings Mycroft was pulling, but the older Holmes seemed to be in his element, blurring details and offering excuses to ensure that the truth of what had happened never found its way into the light. Perhaps if John were in a better frame of mind, he would pay more attention. As it was, he let Sherlock's baritone voice wash over him as he stared unseeingly at the scene, too lost in his own thoughts to engage with reality.
'Yeah, well, a bobby's pay's not much better than an army pension, and in this city, you take what you can get.' Greg stretched his arms, groaning as he glanced at his watch. 'I s'pose we'd better get you home to your other half.'
The noises of him moving around were comfortable and familiar, taking Sherlock back to a time, long ago now, when their lives had been a binary system, the two of them locked cooperatively in one another's orbit. It could never be the same again. Too much had changed since then, but a sense of security still permeated Sherlock's bones.
He could barely breathe. The air was too hot. Their movements were cramped and desperate, but John could not bring himself to care. This was too raw and desperate for any kind of grace. The cool stone wall was the only thing holding them up, Sherlock’s back to it and John pinning him in place.
John grunted, falling silent as the peace of Baker Street folded around them. The pad of John's thumb traced back and forth over the bump of Sherlock's knuckle: a steady, mesmerising beat. It called his pulse into the same, lazy rhythm, and Sherlock felt his body unwind in response.
'Sir...' The commander’s voice carried a note of urgency. Clearly, the day was far from at an end, and Sherlock grimaced as he hobbled to his feet.
Giving himself a little shake, Sherlock flung aside the cloud of his deductions and got to work. Stripping the bed linen, he piled it in the corner. Current government guidelines had relaxed about fabrics, being more intent as they were on controlling the virus. They would need to be washed at sixty degrees, if not hotter. However, since the washing machine was downstairs, for now they would have to be folded and bagged until it was safe to venture out once more.
'The bat and the skull stay,’ he muttered, giving an indifferent shrug. ‘Do what you will with the rest. Now, are there any more purchases we need to make?'
Mary pulled one of the zip ties tight before stepping back to consider her handiwork. 'That's what I like about you, Sherlock.' She smiled as she leaned against a nearby desk, the light filtering in from the slatted blinds over the windows painting stripes across her face. 'Most men would bluster and swear, but you seem to know when you are beaten.'
Despite himself, a smile tugged at the corner of his lips. He breathed out a sigh of relief as he leant back against the wall of the van, letting the soft purr of the idling engine rumble through his shoulders. 'Molly, are you all right?'
It seemed the van door he had kicked outwards had made abrupt contact with his nose. Blood painted his face, and his chest shifted in the steady breaths of the unconscious. He had passed out either from the blow or when the back of his skull struck the ground.
Rusty brown stained the white outfit she wore, the cloth parted in great, yawning slashes. John counted five, all criss-crossing each other. It looked violent. Furious. Blood had pooled around the body, smeared by what looked like swiping fingertips. She’d been alive, he realised, struggling to move away from her attacker as the blows fell.
From John's personal experience, the actual expression of symptoms varied hugely. That was assuming it was even Covid-19, of course. It could just be 'flu. There'd be no way to know for sure unless he got a test, and John wasn't holding his breath for access to one of those any time soon.
Anger surged, coating his throat in bitter bile. Every vein felt swollen with rage, every muscle tense with the need to wrap his fingers around the fragile stem of her neck and
Sherlock paused in his typing, smoothing his fingers down the laptop screen, oddly reverent. John thought he saw those hands tremble, and Sherlock's throat convulsed as he swallowed, tilting his head to one side in acknowledgement.
He couldn't give up. That much was certain. Whether John wanted to see him or not, he had to make the effort. Not by text, nor by the dubious intervention of his brother's CCTV surveillance. Being there for a friend, that's what mattered to people, wasn't it? He could wait for John to seek him out, or he could bite the bullet and lay himself open to John's wrath. Like purging a wound, it had to hurt more before it could start to heal.
‘I gave him a referral. Therapy, mostly, but to someone I know. Someone I trust. They’ll follow up in a couple of days, and if they can’t help him they’ll get him to someone who can.’
John realised that a grimace had twisted his lips, and he eased it away, nodding his head as he sank into the waiting embrace of his armchair. 'Yeah, yeah. Just thinking is all. I... what's all this?' He blinked, realising that not only did a still-steaming cup of tea await him on his little side-table, but an array of cereal and fresh milk, fruit, cheese and bread lay before him on the coffee table.
‘Two days? On the NHS?’ Sherlock lifted an eyebrow, but there was an ounce of pride dancing along the edges of his sarcasm.
'Mottram Saint Andrew, Sir,' the driver informed him. 'A short distance to the south of Manchester.'
'Good grief, Sherlock. What do you look like?' Mycroft's thin lips twitched in a smirk as the wing of one eyebrow quirked upwards. He had a glass of brandy in his hand, though Sherlock knew that was more likely to be an affectation at this time of day. Mycroft liked to keep his wits about him. While the civil service and its various branches may embrace a culture of day-drinking, he rarely partook in such behaviour. 'Drink?'
Perhaps that was why suspicion strafed its fingers over the back of his mind. Mary had been his friend. Against all his own expectations he had liked her, admiring her sharpness of wit and intelligence, but trust? No, they'd never managed that.
John paced in front of the dark fireplace, each anxious step wearing a groove in the plush carpet beneath his feet. Sherlock's plan made perfect sense. Vivian Norbury was the last living connection to this whole mess with Mary, but there was a big difference between the idea of speaking with her and the reality.
'I can explain.' She lifted her hands away from the laptop keys and spread them in surrender. It would not take much, Sherlock thought, for her to reach for the pistol on her hip. John would beat her to the shot, but the last thing they needed was to send bullets flying: not if they wanted answers.
Perhaps what surprised Sherlock most was his complete lack of an emotional response. A week ago, he would have been exuberant, a man touched with a live wire at the thought of Moriarty's convoluted plans. Now, he could only stare, his heart leaden and sluggish in its beat. What was the point of playing the Game when he had already lost the only thing that mattered?
John smiled, his breath leaving him in a shuddering rush as he swayed closer, pressing up even as Sherlock bent his head, claiming John's tempting lips in a cautious, curious kiss.
'Yes.' He hesitated, a clutch more words getting caught and tangled on his tongue. Social niceties had never been his strong suit. Now, in the midst of all this, it seemed even more challenging to get things right. Not that Mrs Hudson minded.
John shuddered, an all over tremor that he couldn't hide. This was not the first time Sherlock had ended up bleeding after a case, and it wouldn't be the last. Still, he kept remembering the look in Townsend's eyes. The sharp, utter hatred. He would have run Sherlock through without a hint of remorse if John hadn't stopped him. He would have left the most remarkable man John ever knew bleeding to death on the floor and walked away, and all for what?
Sherlock nodded, leaving John to peruse the offerings in peace. In truth, his appetite remained sullenly absent, but he fed himself anyway, bolstering himself with sips of milky tea before attempting some cereal. The first few mouthfuls sat heavy in his belly, but after a while the uncomfortable aches turned to hunger, and he set about assuaging it with morsels of fruit before finishing with a slice of bread and butter.
Shaking his head, Sherlock cast his musings away. He was not in Croatia for a holiday, and his thoughts were nothing but a fantasy. John would never see the Dalmatian coast. At least, not in Sherlock’s company. He would be lucky if John so much as gave him the time of day upon his eventual return to London. He may not be the most socially aware of people, but even Sherlock knew that faking his own death was more than a bit not good.
'One in which Mary believed she held all the cards. I wonder if, in the end, that was her downfall. I've decoded entries from her logs to give us some indication of the time-frame of her activities. She started when she was still part of AGRA.'
'Maybe, but it's not the kind of thing you forget in a hurry.' John grinned, shaking his head. 'If you are looking for a new place, though, I can get Sherlock and Mrs Hudson on the case. Between them, I bet they can find you somewhere nice. Some bloke will owe Sherlock a favour, and Mrs Hudson's knitting group all seem to own London property.'
This time, though, there was too much at stake. Now, he had to fall in line – to dance to Moriarty’s little tune – at least for a while. So he vanished, dead to the world, and he waited for his moment.
'Not for the first time,' Sherlock grumbled. 'A through-and-through flesh wound, nothing more significant.'
'With any luck, we'll have the opportunity to make the first move,' he decided. 'If we can break this stalemate on our terms, we will have the advantage.'
It started with the scent of coffee, rich upon the air. The shadows lessened, their veils drawing back as the occasional lamp pocked the darkness. A rickety desk, lashed with rope to offer it support, stood in the centre of an empty room, and various screens glowed from where they perched on its surface.
Sherlock relieved him of his Sig with deliberate tact, giving John plenty of time to reclaim the weapon if he chose. It was tempting. It offered him the illusion of control, but that was not the purpose of a gun. It was a last resort, not a comfort object.
'You were right; they've been at it a while.' John shrugged, his mouth wrenching to the side. 'Longer than Mary's been gone. Maybe it's nothing to do with her after all?'
Yet it was not just Sherlock's obvious skill that John admired. He was a gorgeous man; anyone with eyes could see that. Now, the focus on his face was almost serene. He had never seen Sherlock so utterly at peace. Even lost in his mind palace he was not so focussed.
'And I'm grateful.' John's mirth vanished, replaced by an earnest expression that brought light to his eyes for the first time in days. 'I mean it, Sherlock. You didn't have to do this. Any of it.'
The camera's flash threw aside the veils of the aquarium’s milky blue light. Sherlock examined every detail, capturing them in the net of his mind as he began to build a picture. Of course, with eyewitnesses and a confession from Norbury herself, there had not been a need to do much in the way of constructinging a case. As such, it seemed the Yard had kept their investigations to the preliminary, devoting themselves to other cases that required their efforts.
With a quick nod, she sat up, waiting for her equilibrium to settle before reaching for the bag she’d instructed her accomplices to bring.
John squinted. It was a bit early in the morning for this kind of deep, philosophical thinking into modern society. He hadn’t even had a cuppa yet. ‘So, the first Banksy’s an all right bloke. Kind of a robin hood situation, except the rich don’t realise they’re being robbed, because they bought something with their money: which he then gives away. And the others are…’
Once Mycroft said it, well, it made the most perfect kind of sense. Of course, once, a long time ago, Sherlock had wanted to be a pirate. What kid didn’t? Between the ships and the freedom, the heroics and the treasure, it sounded like a brilliant career choice. At least when you were seven and hadn’t heard of scurvy.
A moment. A frozen heartbeat crystallised in the weave of eternity. One choice or the other, forward or back, and he and Sherlock balanced on the precipice of both. John had brought them here, but it was not his decision alone to make.
John watched Sherlock, noting the furrow of his brow and the wrinkle of his nose. 'Only if you swear to me not to use it for political advantage. You cannot deny the conflict of interest.'
Mycroft nodded, his austere face grim. 'We were nearby, as Sherlock requested, when the blast went off. Sherlock had apprised me of your location. I am gratified to find you survived.'
Straightening from his feigned slouch, he flicked his fingers through his hair, wrinkling his nose at the faint tang of smoke that lingered in his curls. It would dissipate before long in the open air, and he had the time to spare. By now, John and little Rosie should already be on their way, whisked off to parts unknown.
With a deep breath, he bowed his head, tightening his folded arms across his chest as if he could somehow hold himself together even as he longed to fall apart. As much as he wished he could pull away and enforce the distance between them, John knew he did not have the strength.
If John hadn't fired his Sig in that moment, then Mary would have put a bullet through that brilliant brain. He had seen it in her eyes and the angle of her body. Many doubts swirled through him, but of that fact he was certain. She would have killed Sherlock to prove that her threats were not bluffs and that the power ultimately lay in her hands.
'She was convenient. Still is, at least for now. Meet me at Dewhurst industrial estate in one hour. I’ll text you precise coordinates. Come alone and bring the file.'
‘You know I’m right.’ The haughty edge to Mycroft’s expression melted, revealing something softer beneath. Another manipulation, Sherlock surmised, though there was a very slim chance that it was genuine sentiment on display. ‘He is good for you. And you for him.’
John was always eager to use dashes in his work to bring a sense of immediacy, but in a handwritten message such as this they were both proliferous and out of place. Now they hoarded Sherlock's attention, clamouring for his focus even as he struggled to understand their relevance.
A suitable replacement live round, hidden in her hand and treated with a sample of her blood, would be found on the aquarium floor. The evidence would tell the story of Mary’s death, even if it was nothing but a fiction.
John shrugged, not following. His molasses-slow thoughts felt like lead pressing against his skull. He didn't understand this – not any of it. 'Like what?'
Now here he was, lost in a mire of emotion. He could not begin to fathom how he could recapture his usual indifference. There was no option for him to remove his feelings from the equation, and the resulting uncertainty was unpleasant to say the least.
Then there were days like today, when the wind blew just so, and Sherlock lifted his face to the horizon with a peaceful sort of longing. The Belstaff billowed behind him, all swagger and style. The cry of seagulls as they cruised up the Thames only added to the image, and John could almost hear the creak of rigging above his head.
John, who deserved to find some peace at last. To find his footing anew and settle into a life with his daughter and whoever else he chose to keep at his side. The shadow Mary's actions cast was a long one. It would linger even after all this was over, but unless they brought it to an end once and for all, then the darkness would never fade. That alone was enough to tighten Sherlock's finger over the trigger and press his shoulder closer to the filing cabinet, waiting for the moment when the balance tipped over into the inevitable.
'Oh, leaving me to deal with whatever horrors are in the fridge, are you?' John joked weakly. It was a pathetic effort at humour, but Sherlock smiled all the same before departing.
‘We’ll be along presently,’ Sherlock added, his brusque tone softened at its edges as he inclined his head to the Dean.
John paused, considering Sherlock's question in the glassy, strange clarity that the fever had left in its wake. Back when Sherlock returned, the "why" hadn't made a blind bit of difference. He'd been so angry: furious at how he had suffered for nothing – grieved for nothing. That eclipsed any joy he might have felt in seeing Sherlock alive and well after all.
Sherlock looked so perfect. So whole. There was no trace of the injuries that had stolen his life away. No hint of the wounds that had taken him from John's side. He longed to reach out and clutch him close, to hold him tight and never, ever let him go again, but a leaden weight dragged at his arms. Instead, he could only drink in the sight of him, trying to remember every detail so that his memory, at least, could never fade.
'I have several, but first I want to take another look at the photographs you examined earlier. So far, other than Norbury's confirmation, they are the only connection we have to Mary's continuing existence. If they have anything more to tell us, then I need to see it for myself.'
'I don't need to,' Sherlock replied, scanning the room before speaking again. 'These are his trusted, most competent fighters. I can see four in bouts currently who reflect that level of aptitude, which suggests one is either awaiting their turn or has chosen not to attend practice tonight. Possible, but unlikely. To get this good at fencing you have to be ambitious and competitive. Few who achieve a high level would voluntarily miss a practice.'
The days bled together, passing in a kaleidoscope of daylight and darkness. Once, back in his youth, Sherlock would have resented another relying on him so thoroughly. He would have loathed being needed, but when it came to John, everything changed.
Clearly, Mary had no trouble gaining access. He wondered if she'd taken a copy of Sherlock's key or perhaps tricked Mrs Hudson into giving her a spare in case of emergencies. There was definitely no sign that she had forced her way in. Others wouldn't have that advantage. They would have to resort to lock picks or smashing the windows, and he had no intention of allowing anyone to take him or Sherlock by surprise.
'Wait. Can you sit for a bit?' Sherlock guided him towards the living room, easing him down into the familiar nest of his armchair. A blanket surrounded his shoulders, and he clutched it gratefully. 'I'll get you some water and some paracetamol.'
John laughed at that, shaking his head. There was no argument he could offer. Him and Sherlock had faffed about for far too long, dancing around each other and never communicating how they felt. It had all seemed too much - the risk of ruining their friendship an insurmountable threat, back then. Now, John could look back and see they didn't really have a choice in the matter. Him and Sherlock had been falling together since day one.
Sherlock noticed. John refused to believe that he could tell what John had for dinner three days ago but failed to observe him turning into a grump at this time of year. He never said anything though. Never wore a poppy either, but then maybe that’s because such things were beneath him. Who could tell with Sherlock?
Mellow afternoon sunlight coated everything in hazy gold, making him look like some nubile god in repose: perfectly tempting. All the little chores John had intended to do before he went and picked up Rosie from nursery at the end of the day flew from his mind, scattered to the four winds. This was far more important.
Reaching behind him, he pulled the hood of his jumper over his head, arranging his body in the familiar slouch of a man a decade his junior. He ambled across the road towards the perimeter, vaulting the fence with easy confidence before striding down the narrow strip of weed-riddled lawn that fringed the crumbling red-brick premises.
It did not matter what logical reassurances his mind could conjure, they did nothing to appease the constant, edgy fear that coalesced into a tense knot in his stomach. He caught himself fidgeting, unable to settle to anything.
Sherlock glared at Mycroft, who had the good sense to look abashed at what he had just let slip. His nose wrinkled, and he swung his umbrella as he offered a thin smile.
Sherlock looked John up and down, reading every tell-tale sign of anxiety that gilded his frame. His hands clenched into nervous fists, and he kept shifting his weight, battle-ready even now. That expressive face sagged beneath the burden of the past few days, and John's body practically hummed with tension.
alive?' Sherlock raised an eyebrow. 'If she did fake her own demise, would you forgive her as you did me?'
Rubbing his hands together, he debated whether to put on another pair of socks. Except that would involve moving from the nest he’d made in his armchair. Here, in a cocoon of blankets and close to the crackling fire, he at least managed to control his shivers.
‘They’re not talking about me.’ Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned back towards the door. He could sense Mycroft dithering behind him, his curiosity fighting the need to set a good example.
'There are some cases I've never been able to solve,' he pointed out, desperate to manage John's expectations.
John followed him down the stairs from the neat little flat, leaving the Yard behind to build their case. They knew where to find them if they needed more help. Besides, there was not much more either Sherlock or John could do.
The change of topic felt like a blessing: a retreat from a chasm he still had not discovered how to bridge, and Sherlock restrained a sigh of relief. 'Probably. I might visit the morgue when I'm allowed out and see what I can discover.'
John grimaced, scratching at his nose. Sherlock wasn’t wrong about that bit. Trev down the road could paint a gorgeous piece on a crap old warehouse and all he’d get for his efforts was an ASBO. Banksy, on the other hand…
Before he knew it, a cup of tea steamed at his side and a piece of toast awaited him, gleaming gold with a suitable layer of butter upon its surface. John picked at the snack and sipped his drink, raising an eyebrow as Sherlock sat down in his armchair with a pen and notebook in his hands. 'What are you doing?'
Biting his lip, John shifted in his armchair. He drew his knees up to his chest, wrinkling his nose as a waft of fragrance from his unwashed body assailed him. The bitter perfume made his skin crawl, and he clenched his jaw.
He reached out, accepting the toast that John still held out like a grudging peace offering and taking a bite. It was a silent promise and, in years to come, Sherlock would see it for the turning point it truly was.
Slipping the ring on his finger, he swallowed, his heart racing. He had never considered himself romantic, but he could not deny the truth:
'Right, so she's some sort of "family friend", then. Good to know. What now? Are we going to talk to the fencing kids?'
Tempting as it was to remind John of all the skeletons in Mary’s closet, Sherlock shook his head. As Mycroft had pointed out all those years ago, what mattered was not that John was getting married, but that he was not getting married to Sherlock himself.
‘A puppy is a huge amount of work, Rosie, love. They need to be trained and fe. They need walking all the time. They need space…’ John gestured to 221B meaningfully. God, he’d love to get a nice semi with a bit of garden, but this was London. He’d have to be a millionaire, and besides, he liked the flat. It was home. Leaving it felt…. Wrong.
He could not resist the temptation to stretch up and claim that mouth anew, to worship Sherlock with tender kisses that spoke of far more than lust and release. John had never been great with talking about his feelings, but here, in the bower of their bed, he could show Sherlock how much he was adored; how much he meant to John, unconditionally and without restraint.
And who could blame him after the way John had behaved since his return? He had spent every waking moment building a wall between them, establishing the line of friendship so firmly that Sherlock did not dare cross it.
John tightened his grasp around his empty mug, groping for the TV remote as he tried to stop the whirl of his thoughts. He didn't feel strong enough for this, not yet, but now it seemed there was no stopping the flourish of his hopes.
John considered it, wincing as a delicate shiver trickled down his spine. 'Yeah, all right.' If nothing else it might help the cold that seemed to press itself against the inside of his skin. In contrast, his eyes felt like hot coals in their sockets, burning every time he blinked, and an odd headache grumbled around inside his skull. 'Thanks.'
He passed John his mug, curling John's fingers around the handle and making sure it was secure in his grip before turning to his own drink. 'So why are they here? What are they hoping to achieve? It's the one aspect I have yet to grasp, and one that I suspect is essential to bringing this to an end.'
He obeyed, offering Greg a quick smile of farewell as he followed Sherlock, ignoring the Belstaff flapping around his ankles. He trotted to catch up, and a moment later caught Sherlock’s hand in his good one, weaving their fingers together.
He felt... odd. Invigorated yet enervated. The closest parallel he could bring to mind was that of jet lag, where everything took on an odd, crystal clarity. His brain was exhausted, yet awake, his body weary yet energised: a distasteful contradiction, but one he could not deny. Yet it was not merely that which left him light-headed. No, that was more emotional – a giddy, swooping uncertainty-cum-hope that had its root in more than mere relief.
One never took so much as a single drag from the cigarette in his grasp. Now and then it would burn down to the filter, and he would light another, only to cling to it and do nothing.
