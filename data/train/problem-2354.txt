“Mm,” Mycroft hummed...he still wasn’t quite sold. “Go shower, dear.”
“Then he’s not naked!” Molly bent down with her hands on her knees; “Harry, darling?” she asked sweetly.
There was no answer. No answer, no laughing, no noise. Nothing but fuzzy darkness and the faintest outline of the counter.
Jawn didn’t believe him. Well, halfway…he believed that Daddy wasn’t hurt, or G’eg would be a lot more worried. “I’m si’d wi’f you,” Jawn decided, and went to unbuckle himself.
Greg was shaking the whole chair now, in a fit of uncontrollable laughter...it was just so goddamn
“So do I,” Mycroft tutted. “Especially the scary ones.”
“We won’d!” Sherlock insisted, his gaze already glued to the opening scene of the movie while his hands were busy unwrapping his own popcorn ball...his cellophane, however, had spiderwebs. Without tearing his eyes away from the screen, he carefully folded the small, plastic bag, and set it aside for safekeeping.
There was a teary, muffled “Y’ub’oo,” from the direction of his shoulder.
“Because you’ve had enough,” he said, then turned her back towards Greg; “Go get your sparkler,” he said, and sent her off with a pop to her bottom.
,’ Greg thought. At least the heat had been turned off of him...the majority of it, at least. “...Wonder what ‘e meant by that,” he wondered out loud, mostly to break the tension rather than expecting an actual answer, especially from Sherlock.
” she cried, covering her ears with her hands when the next firework started it’s shrill whistle before taking off.
Severus didn’t know exactly what ‘water guns’ were, but if the word ‘water’ and the larges nozzles were anything to go by…
Loki angled himself until he faced Steve, resting his chin on his shoulder as it was propped on the back of the couch, exuding calm. “Oh,
“I, I, I c-can’t…” John stammered through his blubbering; “I c-can’t h-elp them a-all!”
When he chose to have them, anyway.
“I’m no’d g'unna po'ge yoouuuuu!” Sherlock wiggled unhappily.
“I y’oss my tas’de a’ffer you pun’ss me in the fa’se.”
"Hi its the anon again that submitted for day 4 and just now with Steve and Bucky
“The whole ‘victim-blame-you-out-of-your-pants’ thing he said.” Greg ran his hand back through his hair and scratched the back of his neck. He was getting a bit scraggly himself. “I mean, in context I get it, yeah, but it doesn’t make much sense, you kno-” He stopped short when he caught Sherlock’s eye and saw the look of dead-eyed disdain furrowing his little brow.
“It iiiiiisssss.” Greg wriggled down under the covers, getting comfy. “Love you, Myc.”

with playing videogames all night,” Thor muttered. Of course, he’d known what they were doing, trying to give the Little One a sense of pride and purpose to ease the sense of being left behind…but still, they didn’t have to aim so far below the belt.
“Da’ da’ da’ da’,” Tony jabbered tearfully, no matter how the Cloak tried to soothe him.
@paddedpartners said: "Hi hi!! I saw you answered my ask and it’s totally okay! Day 30 is a cute prompt!! If 31 is still open I do have something in mind for lil Molly. Could she be over at Mycroft’s for a NYE party with Sherlock and John, all big and enjoying the night when Greg sets off fireworks that startle Molly into headspace? Then the comfort and coddling and cuteness ensues. If it’s been taken though no worries! Thanks for your time 😊 "
“Ah-HA!” Ron leapt forward and reached under the table, grabbing a single, wriggling ankle while Harry shrieked in delight, even through a mouthful or cookie crumbs and icing. “C’mere, you little shi–!”
“Yeah, i’ds Ha’yyoween!!!” Jawn crowed again.
Another rocket went off, and Molly finally looked up and reached for Sherlock to pick her up, her eyes brimming with tears.
It was obvious that Mycroft was waiting for him to be the first to speak, though. And Greg...well, he just didn’t want to. Because nothing that he could think of sounded smart enough. But, finally, he sighed and settled on a simple, “I’m sorry, Myc.”
So, when he finally came out of the old bedroom and Sherlock looked up from his laptop and asked him “Are you alright,” his answer should have been “Sure, what’s for dinner?”
“Great.” Bruce moved closer and plopped down on the couch next to the towering god. “I’ll take him while you go make a bottle,” he said, and held out his arms expectantly.
Thorin sat up and looked around to see if Bilbo had stopped the stream for a moment’s reflection, or was getting something to eat out of his pack, or if he was just begin his usual grumpy little self and  legging behind.
“Well, he certainly shouldn’t go unpunished, accident or no. What else would be fitting of such a crime, hm?” Mycroft continued, and rubbed his hand up and down his baby brothers’ bare back.
“Ooo, me!” Molly bounced on her toes. “Can I have a sparkler…wait, where’s my drink??”
Bucky finally stirred at the sound of Steve’s voice, and cracked his eyes open. “N'nn,” he mumbled as he stretched.
little brother who insisted.” Greg finally found the conveniently hard-to-find milk and turned around to face Mycroft, using his foot to close the refrigerator door behind him. “They wanted somethin’ scary, so I put on somethin’ scary!”
“G'eg?”
“No’d Belle,” Sherlock said, gazing at his reflection wistfully, his eyes sparkling more than the crystals.
“A right good spanking, that’s what.”
“C’mon,” Greg chided. “One time for Daddy? Pleeeeeease?”
Tony squealed and grabbed a handful of Stephen’s hair. “N’ah ea’d me!” he giggled.
“--Because if it wasn’t something directly your fault, you would have told us what happened the first time we asked,” Mycroft interrupted, blinking at him with the most condescending blinks Greg had ever seen. Nevermind that he was bloody-fucking-right.

Bruce popped the disposable, protective cover off the thermometer into the trash can. “None of the others live on Red Bull and three hours of sleep when their Daddy isn’t looking,” he added, pulling out his phone and tapping on it rapidly.
“Nine,” Alfred continued, and Bruce moved closer to the bed, the side opposite of Alfred.
“Why?”
There was a beat’s pause. “…Get what over with, Gregory.”
“YE’SH!!!” Sherlock threw himself around John squeezed. “I’sh sh’o
‘...Daddy!’ The tears dribbling down his cheeks turned to ones of relief as Jawn sat up on his knees and reached for him. “Da’!” he babbled excitedly, fingers grasping in the air.
“He’s fine, he’s fine,” Greg said quickly. “Nobody’s hurt, monkey; it’s just a silly little mix-up because he forgot what ‘tier four’ means…apparently,” Greg grumbled.
...Which was convincing enough for John to remember his sense of self preservation. “Fine, FINE, I’m goin’!” He practically (but not quite) threw the nappy bag at them before making a mad dash for the stairs, just in case Mycroft was serious. “Just bring my child to me when you’re done...IN ONE PIECE!” he called over his shoulder, and then disappeared into the spare office with a slam of the door.
“Agreed.” Thorin fell into step behind Dwalin to open his pack, and retrieved the small, twined bundle of clean cloths. He had another bundle in his own pack, as well as a small bottle of lightly fragrant oil that the elves had also given them.
Mycroft tilted his head, listening expectantly, but remained quiet while he let Greg work it out for himself.
But he guess that he could go potty now, now that Blue was over. He didn’t tell Steve that he’d had to go for awhile now, because Steve would make him go and he would miss seeing what Blue was telling Josh with her clues! And if he missed
Sherlock chuckled; “You should have thought of that when you bought it,” he said warmly. Between that, and the expression on his face as he watched Molly with her newest (and best, apparently) present, John figured that he wasn’t all that worried about the logistics.
Greg took a deep, *deep* breath that made his lungs ache, and did as he was told. When he felt Mycroft’s arm wrap around his waist to hold him flush at his side, he squeezed his eyes shut.
…He was on
It took Steve three more tries and a commercial break to Bucky’s attention, having to
Double lifetime, when your skin’s pricklin’ from being stared at.
“It will if you fancy being able to sit comfortably all day.” John got up and headed for the kitchen, patting Sherlock’s shoulder as he passed. “Go ahead and get her up, love. She needs more than her clothes changed.”
“–Before you start, I’m sorry,” Greg blurted. “I know I snapped, and I shouldn’t have, not when he’s Little like that, but I lost my head and I did, and I’m sorry, so can we just get this over with so I can go tell him I’m sorry?”
Sherlock ignored him and went on as if he hadn’t been interrupted; “C’n we ha’b our can’ny now?” he asked hopefully, twirling one of his pigtails around his finger.
Sherlock wrapped an arm around him and swiped at the tears trailing down his cheeks and chin, doing little but smearing them further, and laid his head on Mycroft’s shoulders while his big brother rubbed his back. “No’m no’d,” he sniffled. “I, I jus’ ha’de--” a hiccup bubbled out of his throat, followed by a cough; “Jus’ h-ha’de stu'bid m-mas’gs.”
Christ, Stephen thought as he quickly snapped on a clean pair of gloves, and prepped a new syringe. He wanted to get this over with and snuggle up his baby boy just as much as Tony did.
“MY’COFF!” Sherlock shouted, and dug in the heels of his black-polished Mary-Janes.
Bilbo felt Dwalin move his arm and tensed up, ready to be forcibly shoved off his lap because of course, he hated Bilbo and his constant nattering and arguing and uselessness and gods,
cute to see them get so excited, after all. “Fair point...Big scary, or baby scary?”
,’ Severus thought.
“Love you too, you fit, coin-bouncingest man alive.”
Dick snuggled down and wedged himself right up against Bruce’s chest before he finally relaxed.
much, doodlebug-”
He was robe-clad and settled in his big, overstuffed, squishy armchair, with its faded seat and threadbare edges (one of the few things he’d brought along when he’d moved in, much to Mycroft’s dismay...although Greg had caught the lanky bastard napping in it almost as much as he did, the disingenuous tit), with Sherlock tucked all nice and cozy at his side in nothing but his nappy and one of their many, many,
, to all four corners of the room! “Oh, c’mon!” he whinged. “You got me back already!”
Because he shouldn’t be laughing! It was a terribly sad thing, and poor little Jawn was so distraught and emotionally wrung out, and so ashamed and embarrassed by the whole thing and
speechless. “You jolly green jackass.”
“If we walked as much as you all drank…” Bilbo muttered under his breath–he could be impulsive, but he wasn’t stupid. And his bum still ached enough to not want to chance a repeat performance.
Mahal, help him. While he had his back to Bilbo, Thorin rolled his eyes and began to untie the bundle of cloths. “Convincing, truly,” he grumbled. “Lie down.”
was a hard bargain. Molly plopped down on her bum and pressed her forehead against the bars like a little convict; “Sha’-sha’,” she pleaded one more time, sounding sadder than ever and close to tears.
Greg balked; okay, he did deserve
Jawn’s brow furrowed, and he cast a worried glance at Mycroft.
“Y’ah,’ Harry hugged Severus around the neck as he was carried out of the nursery and down the hall, towards the kitchen and living room. “I’ds ear’yee for a’morrow!”
Dick sighed and sagged against his Da’da’s chest, finally content. “Y’ah, bu’d I ha’bn’t see’d you.”
Harry gave Severus a cheeky grin, and nodded.
“Aw, oh no,” Sherlock cooed, rocking her. “I know it is, poor thing…do you want to go back inside? Ye-es, we can go back inside,” he said, petting her hair as she nodded her head ‘yes’.
Bucky nodded without taking the spout of his cup out of his mouth.
“No squabbling over candy? Because if you start fighting over it,
Even Thorin was enjoying himself as he sat by the fire and listened with earnest to everyone’s stories and throwing in some of his own that he knew he’d told at least a dozen times, but everyone still listened and reacted as if it were the first time hearing them, and Thorin appreciated it.
“Now, I know you’re not blaming me for that.”
"Can I ask for more Bagginshield for day 13? 🥺 Snuggling after a spanking, or after Bilbo has a nightmare? Your choice ❤️ "
Happy with the outcome of the evening, Sherlock tugged the bag of his own candy haul over and plopped down next to Jawn, sitting crosslegged. “Wha’d you get??” he asked, looking over his boyfriend’s stash.
Harry hopped from one corner of the bed to the other; "Harry!” he grumbled, lowering his voice to imitate the older wizard; “I’b you bra’ge my bed I bra’ge you bum!”
…Such as a particularly repressed, stick-in-the-mud American soldier, who was so bottled-up that Loki could swear he could hear the cork creaking whenever Steve took a bloody step.
“You know you’re going to pick up every single bit of that,” Greg warned.
Steve kept his tightfisted grip on the pocket of her jeans as he toddled around after her, dragging his blanket close behind and hoping that he could be cute enough to maybe change her and Papa’s minds about not taking him with them.
Greg switched his gaze back and forth between the brothers, giving them each the stink-eye in turn until he decided that Sherlock was telling the truth. “…Bugger you both.
“Yep. In leather trousers.”
” Greg waggled his eyebrows in an exaggerated fashion; “Take your time, muffin.”
Today was one of the ‘both’ days.

"P-pa’ba say’ed, um, n-no v-vid–” Steve stammered through the last of his tears.
lap, of all the other dwarves and–?!
Bilbo ‘hmphed’ into his shoulder, blushing furiously…Thorin couldn’t necessarily see it, but he could feel the little Hobbit’s body heating up. “It’s less likely to happen again if you’d stop your fussing and let us take care of you.”
“And that I love you very, very much? Did you know that, too?”
“Oh, leave him be, Ron….and quit dragging his new jumper along the
“Y’ah!” Steve giggled, clinging to Thor’s neck.
He turned forward again, nudged Dwalin to get his attention, then grunted and ticked his head back in Bilbo’s direction.
Mycroft crossed his arms over his chest in a huff, and positively
First off, he knew damn well that when he’d fallen asleep, he’d done so while curled up on Daddy’s lap. Specifically, he remembered the smell of Da’s conditioner tickling his nose as he’d lain on his shoulder, while long fingers had tapped out an oddly-soothing rhythm along his spine.
Steve’s mouth gaped open and his eyes grew comically wide as he sputtered several half-words that were meant to be coherent sentences. “Uh, wha-…I mean, what?! The fuck–?!”
So it
“What happened??!?”
Nothing, he thought as Daddy sat him up. There was nothing to worry about. Daddy was here.
“No pepperonis? My word, you really must be ill after all.”
Mycroft took the opportunity to catch Gregs’ attention over the mass of dark curls in his face, and winked.
“I said NO,” Greg snapped…it was harsher than he meant it to be, but he was ready to move on to something else. “Pick another game, muffin, or Greg’s not playing anymore.”
Not to mention, there’s only so long a phone battery can last while running a very graphics-heavy game.
Mycroft joined them a second later, coming up behind John and leaning down into Sherlock’s line of sight and giving his little brother a soft smile.
Most days, though, were right in the middle of those two extremes. Most were better. Some were a little worse. Most had patches of both.
Finally, a tiny voice drifted from the room; “…No coun’d,” it said, in quite possibly the saddest way that Sherlock had ever heard.
Ah, he’d been waiting for that. Thor pushed off of the counter he’d been leaning against and bundled Steve up into his arms with no resistance from the little one. “Poor little warrior,” he cooed, and stooped to fetch the pacifier from the floor with two fingers. “This battle was just out of your scope this time, brave one. Maybe next time.”
Ah, the drop into headspace was such a sweet thing to witness.
“He really didn’t,” Sherlock cut in…as much as he loved getting Greg’s goat, the last thing he wanted to do was start a fight, especially tonight, of all nights.And
Harry grinned a sneaky grin at him over his shoulder as he stood next to Molly, and waggled his bum.
Sherlock had been taken completely by surprise at the abrupt change in the room, and worried his bottom lip between his teeth as he blinked up at Greg. He knew that G’eg only got snappy when he was mad, but he’d only been playing, and G’eg had said it was okay, and…
“Y-y’ah, ba’g on,” Jawn said, barely above a whisper. His grip on Mycroft’s arm hadn’t loosened in the slightest.
…And that’s where the day went a little sideways.
“I, I, I s-still w-wanna watch,” Molly wheezed, out of breath and wiping tears from the end of her nose with the heel of her hand.
Nappy changes did not bother him. Never flinched at the bouts of crying from leaving bottled up rage to stew for days (if not weeks) at a time. Tantrums, clinginess, neediness, late nights and bottle feedings and soothing scraped knees or bumped heads and chasing overgrown toddlers at the park after a little too much ice cream or being firm when getting them to tidy up their own toys--things that would make many sane (and he used that definition loosely) people throw up their hands and shout ‘
“S'alright, baby,” he said as he picked a sticky, clammy Bucky up out of bed and carried him to the changing table. “We’ll clean you up and you can play games while Daddy changes the–” Steve stopped, mid-sentence, as he placed Bucky down on his back.
Thor’s face fell, along with any desire to argue. “…Fine,” he grumbled, and ever-so-carefully eased the poor, ill-feeling little man from his lap to Bruce’s eagerly waiting arms.
“Be careful on the steps,” Mycroft reminded them...and then turned his attention to Greg. He waited, finger to his lips, eyes narrowed. Just like his brother.
Alfred also knew. That’s why Bruce trusted him with Dick on those nights, but from the sound of it, tonight was one of those nights that needed Da-da.
“Lu’b chi’bs,” Jawn said, and reached out to be picked up, which Sherlock did.
“Oh, that’s
Dick sat up and peered at him; “…Bubb’as?” he asked timidly, his words muffled by his thumb in his mouth.
"Loki/Tony for Day 5? 🥺"
He twisted his upper body to keep Tony from seeing him prep the shot. Even though he knew it was coming, Stephen still wanted to make this as least traumatic as possible. “Oh, oh no! What’s wrong with the baby??? Who’s mistreated this poor, pitiful child??” he teased, keeping the tone of his voice light as he drew back the plunger on the syringe.
, that had to be the one of the cutest thing’s he’d ever seen! “Good boy!” he cheered as he leaned over and kissed the top of Sherlock’s curls, while his little boy (happily!) suckled away; “Good job! You want more?!” he asked, and held out the little bag of magic mix.
John looked up from his phone and frowned. “I’m sorry, what?”
Plus…his pants were still wet from his tipsy sloshing through the stream. “Come on,” he said, nudging the tiny hobbit in his lap; “Let’s get back to the fire before you catch a cold and have something new to fuss about.”
smell like cold sweat,” Mycroft said, and then quickly brushed his lips against Greg’s cheek as an apology.
“Ba’-ba’-ba’-ba’!” Tony babbled, distressed.
Mycroft sighed; he’d hoped both of the boys would be exhausted by now, after trooping through neighborhood after neighborhood and lugging admittedly successful (i.e, unexpectedly
God, it made Stephen hate himself. “I know, I know…Daddy’s being a big old meanie,” he cooed. “I’m so-so-so sorry, Bambi, but this is going to keep you safe and healthy, and you are going to get so-so-so many kisses after! And stickers! And as much candy as your little belly can hold!”
“Mm, finish cleaning up down there first, and then we’ll talk.” Mycroft stood up and ushered both boys to the top of the stairs. “Maybe you can join us for storytime.”
“Oh my God,” Steve whispered, knowing that the phone would pick it up, and then spoke up for Bucky; “Yea, Blue told you ‘good job’! That’s what she says when you use the potty like a big boy!”
“E'bryf'ings g'woss.”
And it drove Sherlock
“I did!” Bucky replied, ever so proud of himself!
The smug look that had taken hold on Sherlocks’ face faltered; he had known that the chance of Jawn being upset upon waking up to find him gone were great, but (and he was loathe to admit this, too) he and Mycroft did have a sweet fondness for each other. If there was anyone other than Sherlock himself that could console the former soldier while (very) deep in his headspace, it would be Mycroft and Greg.
“Thank God you’re food motivated. Fine, we’ll have pizza tonight, and ice cream at the park tomorrow. That is, if you’re letting your dear ole’ Uncle Greg go?”
“I’m not going anywhere, darling.” Mycroft bent down and placed a soft kiss on Jawns’ forehead, after brushing his hair aside. “But we can’t very well change it if your bum’s still sitting on me, can we?” he asked. He hoped to get a giggle out of the wee one...or at the very least, a smile.
“ ‘ey, it was
” Mrs. Weasley had taken painstaking measures to get the lovely baby blue and cream-striped jumper made, with it’s little bunny face on the front that would twitch it’s nose and whiskers when the wearer was extremely happy…and she was
“Pretty sure My’coff is the reason Daddy’s busy.” Greg made sure he had both hands secured on Sherlocks’ hips before giving the little one a small bounce and a weak smile. “What, you don’t want Old G’eg?”
He sat and rocked his little guy in his lap for a short while, waiting for the hiccups and snuffles to subside. When they did, Bruce managed to turn both of them around and scoot backwards until his back met the wall. “Here we are, sweet boy,” he said as he got comfortable, and leaned Dick back until he was lying in the crook of his arm.
Thorin leaned towards his friend; “Where’s the halfling?” he asked.
John softened…okay, that might have been a bit harsh, considering. “Hey, look,” he said, and sat down on the edge of the bed. He still held Sherlock’s hands, and now he drew his pretty little one closer, until he had the baby straddling his lap. “Look,” he said again as he wrapped him in a hug and started to gently rock him; “that was mean, and Daddy’s sorry.”
Bruce laughed as he pulled Dick int his lap and returned the favor. “You missed me?” he asked, and gave Dick a kiss on the forehead. “I’ve been home all day, big boy.”
Mycroft rubbed a soothing hand up and down Greg’s back. "You took that very well, darling,” he said. “I’m proud of you."
He couldn’t get any happier!
horse, and twirled her fingers in its glittery white mane while lazily sucking on her dummy. She didn’t even acknowledge when John spoke.
“Turn’a ligh’ds ba’g on, My’coff?” Sherlock asked with a trembling voice, grasping the cuff of Mycroft’s pajama bottoms in his clenched fist.
Sherlock switched his gaze from the ceiling back to Greg. “Hm?”
“Mm-hmm,” Mycroft hummed, and quirked an eyebrow at him. “You’re lucky it’s not my choice...ask the baby,” he replied, and gave Sherlock a bounce on his knee. “He’s the one you assaulted, after all.”
” Bilbo drew in a sharp breath as Thorin started to rub the oil into the sore places along the creases of his thighs, and the thighs themselves.
“Bu’d i'sh pre'ddier!” Sherlock insisted, stomping a stockinged foot.
Bucky sniffled again, but this time was followed with a quiet “Y-y'ah.”
“Huh?”
“Open the door, Gregory…preferably before we all freeze.”
...At least, he
“G-good boy,” Mycroft chortled, then coughed. “Everyone’s had their ‘good scare’ for the night then, yes?!”
“Nah,” Thorin said as he let go of the nappy and pressed it back into place, snug against Bilbo’s skin. “He likes you just fine; he just doesn’t take any guff from the pebbles.” He stopped and chuckled; “Just ask Kili and Fili.”
Greg, who’d let that same small smile play back across his lips while the baby wasn’t looking, quickly flipped it into a massive pout. He turned his bottom lip down in an impressive display of remorse and batted his eyelashes, while Mycroft pinched his lips together in a way that Greg knew meant he was swallowing back a belly laugh.
Steve snorted–maybe he should just ask Loki to turn into a blue dog so Stubborn Britches over there would listen to him for once. “Just make sure you go when you need to go, Buck-Buck. Your big boy pants don’t hold as much as your Pampers do.”
!!!” he babbled, and placed kiss after kiss after kiss on John’s cheek. “
Sherlock smirked; “...So this is that ‘afternoon of activities’ you were spouting off about,” he said, shrugging out of his coat.
“You go'dda be s'dill, G'eg!” Sherlock scolded. “You ma'ge me me'sh u'b!”
soft baby blankets draped over the both of them. Greg had been successful in getting his little muffin to finally take a bottle earlier, in spite of the poor little thing being so snuffly, and now they were being dreadfully, blissfully lazy.
“Don’t forget their cups. Oh, and Gregory???”
Harry nodded, smiling from ear to ear even as he rubbed his eyes. “Try sh’ome!” he said, stifling a yawn.
Each dwarf had their own bundle of them–they each took turns changing the Hobbit in spite of his numerous, very vocal protests–and by the time everyone was done, every rock, branch, fallen log, and any other flat surface was completely covered with wet laundry left to dry in the sun.
Mycroft continued on. “Tonight, you’re going to-”
“So, it was the shot that caused him to fall ill?” Thor asked, his brow etched with concern as he watched the tiny little man bundled up on his chest, fast asleep. Thor gently laid a broad hand on his back, feeling the steady rise and fall of each raspy breath, as well as the feverish heat radiating off of him. “I thought it was supposed to prevent the sickness…?”
Steve felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe she was going to say–!
Sherlock snapped around and sat up on his elbows, glaring. “No.”
“Aye, looks like.” Thorin swung his bag from his shoulder; “You got any extra?”
“Can Daddy clean you up now, big boy?” Steve tilted his chin down and murmured in Bucky’s ear; “Hm? And then we can play a game before supper…would you like that? Cause I’d like that,” he added, and kissed the only part of Buck he could easily reach at this angle..the tip of his ear.
He meant it, of course. He always did. But Sherlock…
Oh. Oh, now
“No.”
“Steve,” she purred again. “Dumpling…let Mama fix it.”
Bruce remembered the attitude he’d gotten just as few short minutes ago. “No.”
Greg must not have been selling the new movie in quite the right way, because Sherlock’s face fell into the usual thousand-yard stare that he often saw during a slow period at the Yard. “Oh!” he said, suddenly remembering the whole reason he’d been able to talk Mycroft into watching the new version of his old fave in the first place; “--and David Tennant!”
On cue, as if he knew he were the topic of discussion, Tony suddenly began to stretch and snuffle on Thor’s chest. He cracked his eyes open, and searched around until his foggy gaze landed on Thor.
Bucky blinked, and then tentatively reached out to push the handle down. There was a loud, exaggerated flushing sound that startled him and he jerked his hand back, dropping his playdough in the process, and reached for Steve–
But that was impossible, as Thorin was setting him down. On someone’s lap.
Bucky, his little man, was in tears.
Just then, there was a collective squeal of delight from the boys in the sitting room.
“That’s what started this whole mess,” Mycroft said as he tapped his little brothers’ nose. “Now, what do you-”
Hermione tried again. “The unicorn?”
“M-Ma-ma,” stammered as Loki lifted her into his lap, her face a mess of tears and snot. He brushed back the hair that was plastered to her cheek, and reached for the top buttons of his shirt; “Shhhh, calm down…yes, you’re getting what you were after, you little lamprey.”
"Care to elaborate?" he asked, but the words sounded pained and broken.
John had only ever seen one man working out here – the man who sat so quietly at meals - a man of his own age named Greg Lestrade.
“It’s not Lestrade’s garden- not properly,” Sherlock voiced, distracted by the move he was considering. “It’s grandmother’s - or was hers. Lestrade is just borrowing it for a time.”
“No extra buttons?” she asked.
But in the end, he didn’t write the letter, nor did he examine Irene Adler.
“What about you and Professor Snape?”
“Are your legs cold, Sherlock?” John asked.
John turned in time to see Sherlock, sputtering, pluck a goldfish out of his hair and drop it into the hands of one of the students standing beside him.
“So should Rosie and Al get married outside the door of 221A?” John asked.
Lestrade swallowed and, eyes still on Sherlock, carefully got to his feet.
“Take good care of him, Dr. Watson,” she said, fingertips resting casually on Sherlock’s shoulder. “He speaks very highly of you.”
John grinned. “Sherlock. He’s only oblivious and confused when it comes to magic. When it comes to cheating spouses and love triangles, he can always see right through you.”
John frowned. “There’s no reason to remind him – ”
“Well, is he or isn’t he?” Sherlock asked in a loud whisper as he sat with little Hamish in his lap and unwrapped the blanket to count his toes.
“There are, currently, four persons convalescing here at the manor. Three were injured in action and the fourth is a civilian. Their medical files are waiting for you in your rooms. You will be responsible for their daily medical needs and for overseeing their treatment. We have a resident aide –  Miss Molly Hooper – charged with their physical exercise regimes and spa therapy. You are free to direct her to alter the prescribed treatments as you see fit, based on the progress of each patient.”
John didn’t reply. He agreed with Sherlock about Anderson, though he thought Sholto more acceptable as he was than Sherlock did. As Sherlock had turned his attention away, back to the folio, John began to walk the perimeter of the below-ground room, examining the work space more closely before he condemned the room and demanded consideration of Sherlock’s infirmities.
“John, are you really happy with our pots and pans?”
Sherlock was now busy turning out the sleeves to check the wand pocket and it was only when he laid the garment almost reverently back on the table that John noticed the embroidered shapes, done in a fine silver thread.
Sinful, but he was damned to hell already. Sinfully good, sinfully perfect, and he strained not to thrust into the exquisite feel of heat and suction.
John retreated to a safe distance, studying his hand, which was already an angry red and slightly swollen. He tried to shake the pain away to no avail, and when he examined his hand more closely, found that he had at least four stingers in the back of his right hand, and not enough strength and dexterity in his left to remove them.
Sherlock forgets an anniversary but the world does not.
“You survived the assault, I see,” he said, scrutinising John’s face even as John schooled his features, gearing up for the lecture he was about to deliver. Sherlock frowned, apparently not approving of something he read in John’s expression. He dropped his gaze, returning his attention to the folio without commenting on what he’d found troubling. “Anderson is a blithering idiot. Sholto would be acceptable if he stopped trying to be diplomatic and simply spoke his mind.” He did not offer any comment on his own brother.
“He’s a novelty,” John continued. “You’ve taught Rosie everything she knows – she’ll get over her obsession with Sev soon enough.”
With pounding heart, he took two steps across the corridor and leaned against the wall, hands on his knees. It had taken all his will and reserve to hold it together under Mycroft’s scrutiny and he was paying for it now with weak knees and a racing heart. He steeled himself. He was a soldier. He’d been trained – conditioned – for every circumstance, every enemy.
Sherlock grinned into the kiss, then allowed John a final drink before he took both glasses in hand and set them safely beside the skull. .
He handed the key back to John then, but John pressed his hand back.
“If you’re
“Are you mad?” Sherlock closed his eyes. “London to Yorkshire?” He sounded very tired, not surprisingly, but wistful too, and John, who’d spent only an hour with the man, found the tone discordant with what little else he knew of him.
“Just because you hate jumpers doesn’t mean that all men hate them, Sherlock.”
And somehow - John couldn’t say exactly how - it put them all on a level playing field, so to speak.
“A whole man?” John gave a disbelieving scoff. “I’ve seen plenty of soldiers with arms and legs blown off. You look pretty whole from where I’m standing.”
Yet onward he’d gone. And when he’d reached the edge of the cliff, the insurmountable precipice, he’d closed his eyes and jumped.
“It was going to be a treehouse – a pirate ship, like one Sherlock wanted when he was a child.”
of coding. And he’d very likely been keeping his work in mental storage.
Eventually, with Sherlock’s breathing still even, and his limbs relaxed – though he did not think him asleep – John reached into his dressing gown pocket and extracted the letter. He’d wanted to read it while alone, and he was effectively so now, with Sherlock slowly recovering, still curled on his side on the floor.
His left hand fell heavily onto his lap as he picked idly at the keys with his right. He was startled when a voice at the door addressed him.
“Hello John, Sherlock,” Potter said, his demeanor midway between professional and friendly. “I’m afraid we have a bit of a situation and we need your help.”
In the time it took to get from ground level to jump altitude, Sherlock managed to take sixty-four photographs inside the plane, more than half of them of the button configurations on his robes. Rosie allowed Lily to freeze her hair in place, every curl and wisp and tiny braid. Lee cast warming charms over the girls, who looked very much like they needed them, and Severus unexpectedly told a joke.
He turned to where Sherlock could see him, but didn’t look up to meet his gaze. no, John stood there, and in full view of the baby, opened the box and took out the small, white paper pouch inside.
stop, nor did he ‘get back here’. He took off like a shot down the hallway, giggling like a fiend, and was halfway down the stairs when Ron came out of the bedroom, waving Harry’s trousers bunched in his fist. “I said COME BACK!”
-”C’n!”-
Greg stood by and awkwardly shuffled from foot to foot. Well,
“Yep, when Bucky sits and goes potty like a big boy,” Steve said again, completely tickled…God, this was cute. “What do you say to Stephen for giving you such a nice present?”
“Delete that.”
“Afraid we have no idea who you’re talking about, son,” Arthur said, casually taking a cookie from the plate, and passing it under the table without looking up.
Stephen held the syringe low, thumb on the plunger. “Mmm-
“There we are, darling…wait, no-no! Sit still for Mama!” Loki grasped Tony’s wrist mere moments before he could he could rub his face and ruin all of her hard, yet carefully-detailed work.
Bucky wiggled and hopped off the table. “Thi’sh c’n hol’ sh’o many!” he said, holding his shirt up out of the way and patting his belly as Steve put his pants back to rights.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow at him; “Well, actually I was just going to tell you off and put you down for a nap, considering the amount of ‘peer pressure’ you’ve endured. From an infant,” he added, with a sly smile.
And yet another win! when he opened the refrigerator to find several pre-made bottles awaiting him. Six seemed a bit excessive for someone leaving their ‘infant’ for an hour and a half (two hours TOPS, he’d said), but oh well...who was he to complain?
"Miss Sadie I saw this giant unicorn and thought Molly would love a unicorn like this from Sherlock and Uncle John! "
“It’s alright, sweetheart,” Mycroft said, trying to console his little brother. “It’s just the lights. I need to go--Jawn, darling, you’re cutting off the circulation in that arm--I need to go check the fusebo-OX!” He bit back a cry as he felt fingers clutching at his ankle.
“I, I, I
One bloke had called him because he had a broken, possibly (probably) infected tooth and was in so much pain he could hardly speak, but his dentist (or any dentist) said it was a non-emergency and the man was fucking desperate to find anyone, dentist or not, to just cut the fucking thing out and be done with it.
Especially at times like now, as she was getting him settled for bed. Cuddled up in her lap, nursing, while zipped up in his favorite pair of footed jammies and wrapped nice and snug in his blanky as she slowly rocked him.
Sherlock sniffle and nodded, rubbing his cheek along John’s shirt. “Y-y’ah.”
“I imagine you are…” Sherlock worked Jawn’s jumper up over his head and tossed it aside; “since you skipped lunch. Tell Daddy what you want, and he’ll make it happen–lie back for me, little biscuit.”
“E’ssa’ckly! I’sh ear’yee!” he said…or, at least that’s how Harry would’ve replied, if he wasn’t interrupted by his own body betraying him with a jaw-cracking yawn.
“And you’re supposed to be the adult who suggests ‘Winnie the Pooh’s Heffalump Halloween’, or, or...or even ‘Hocus Pocus’, for Gods ’sake!” Mycroft folded his arms and looked towards the sitting room, frowning. “They’re both going to be up all night now, in
“Some’fin sca’wy!” Sherlock grasped the hem of his black dress and twirled in excitement; they weren’t just getting to dig into their candy tonight, no, they were getting to stay up extra late! And watch a movie on top of that! In their costumes! It was everything his Little heart could have hoped for!
there was a chance he could clean up before Steve came and found him, but the moment he went to move his foot, the carpet squished and all he felt was pee squirting up between his toes.
Wait.
“Delilah, is it? A very fancy name for a fancy girl…I like it.” he stopped to kick the door open with his foot, and then proceeded to carry and playfully toss his armloads onto the bed with a happy squeal. “Would Delilah like to wear a dress, too?”
The corners of Dicks’ mouth turned down into a pout, and he laid his head back down with a quiet whimper.
Greg swallowed thickly.
Of course, the moments like that were
“I asked you first,” she said, watching as Steve finally pried himself free of her pocket and patter over to Bucky, squeaking to be picked up. “Deal with that first, then we gotta go,” she said, half-smiling as she gestured to their stage-5 clinger.
“Just as I know that you’re not denying the fact that we should have been home nearly two hours ago if you had kept your enormous mouth shut, Gavin.”
“Two. You know that if I get to three, it means a spanking,” Bruce warned.
“They can come with us. I’m sure we have something that’ll fit a four foot tall stuffed animal.”
Greg snorted; “Good luck with that--darling you’re going to pull the sleeve completely off,” he told Sherlock, who was still tugging at Greg’s sleeve with increased efforts to get his attention. “G’eg! G’eg! G’eg! I know wha’d we c’n wa’sh--!”
with Molly there for the weekend. “And it’s not even that big of a deal, but when I noticed the pile of our training pants disappearing at a rate faster than John or I were wearing, well…” he gestured with his hand; “-
“As ready as we’re gonna get!”
Both pairs of hands squeezed at his sides even tighter...so much so, that Mycroft was sure he was going to be literally covered in finger-shaped bruises by morning.
“S-Stop
Sherlocks’ smile broadened, making his nose wrinkle, and nodded quickly.
, he was good at this. “…Not even one itsy-bitsy, teensie weensie bite?”
His face crumbled as the first tears rolled down his cheeks and a thin, watery cry squeezed past that awful lump in his throat; “Daaaaa’...!”
Harry gave him a sweet smile before becoming overwhelmed by the warm, fluttery tummy butterflies he got whenever Severus called him ‘fawn’, and bashfully buried his face in the crook of his Daddy’s neck.
Jawn sniffled and rubbed his cheek along Mycrofts’ shoulder (effectively soaking it, though Mycroft seemed to pay no mind) and took a deep, shaky breath; “Wh-where g-go?” he asked, his fingers plucking at the buttons on Mycrofts’ vest.
Mycroft’s eyes went wide; “I didn’t tell him!” he said, holding up empty hand up to protest his innocence.
Today, it was nearly an hour and a half past Bucky’s normal naptime when Steve realized his Switch (last year’s Christmas present from Nat. Priciest ‘gag-gift’ ever but the joke’s on her; he loved it) was at 20% battery life, and that Bucky wasn’t crawling into his lap and begging for a turn.
Thorin blinked at the ‘stream’, which was little more than a half-foot wide trickle of mountain run-off at best, but still…it was clear, it was fresh, and it was running, and they needed it.
He’d get him next time.
“Oh, don’t worry about those,” Bruce said, smiling at Tony as he patted his bottom. “And you don’t need to make a bottle, actually.”
like there was something that wanted to, and that it was just biding its time.
It was always a lovely bonding experience, to have a babe in arms snuggled to you, close and warm, while gazing up at you as if you were their entire world…because, if only for those few precious moments, you were. And it made Mama happy to provide that for them.
God, another long night of no sleep.
.” he snapped, and Jawn had the fleeting thought that Mycroft was either the bravest man in the world, or stark-raving mad.
Sherlock’s bottom lip poked out, but he obediently stood and let his brother up. “Bu’d, our can’ny,” he said in quite possibly the saddest voice that Greg or Mycroft had heard so far during the entire course of their babysitting career.
Thorin laughed; “Trust me, burglar, you’ve made us all well aware,” he said, pouring a small amount into his hands and then rubbing the together to warm them.
“Aw…aw, Bucky, baby, what’s wrong?!” Steve scooped him right back up and held him to his chest, nevermind the state of his clothes. “What happened, big boy??“
“Wow.” John sounded impressed. He took a sip of his morning coffee before passing the cup to Sherlock; “I don’t think we’re going to get that to fit in the back of a cab.”
Giggling that soon turned to belly laughing...from the wolf.
Sure, there was a very real possibility of getting his arse smacked any minute now, but...fuck it. He really did love their off-the-rails dynamic. His little family.
Jawn nodded, and scrubbed at one very raw eye with his fist.
…It would always be worth it. For smiles and giggles and sweet kisses on the cheek and forehead and tummy, Even for the tears on long, hard nights when memories would sneak back in uninvited, for the cuddles after the tears, those warm bottles on those late nights spent in the rocking chair…
“Jawn, don’t make Daddy count,” he said as he made his way to the ‘playroom’, formally John’s bedroom. “One…”
, of all things.
The figure crossed the room and lifted Jawn into their arms, where he settled quite nicely on their hip and nuzzled into the crook of their neck, making small “I’m-happy-and-content-now” noises.
think that I’m gonna be mad over accidents. You tried to go; that’s all that matters.”
Well, ‘asked’, technically, but he wasn’t making it a question.
Greg stopped. What. the. f u c k.
he didn’t want to. He didn’t have to go. He’d show Da’da he wasn’t right all the time! And he wasn’t fighting the urge to squeeze his legs together! Or wiggle! Or…!
“Let’s see…do you want bubbles?”
Nope. No mistaking that. It was, after all, his favorite way to fall asleep.
“We have to go pick your Daddy up.” Greg gave the buckle a tug to make sure it was secured.
“Alright.” Mycroft stood and rolled up his right sleeve, which set Greg’s tummy to doing all sorts of nervous flips and tricks at just the sight. “Stand up, trousers down.”
“Oh, I like that one, too!” She patted his bottom through his towel; “Alright, stand up so we can take that nappy off, then Ron can put you in the bath!”
Maybe little Bucky is potty training and he's wearing his pull ups and he gets desperate trying to be a "big boy" for Steve and hold it"
But there was only so long that energy could last on little to no sleep and, by mid afternoon, there was usually a crash that left Sherlock in a fussy, clingy, bleary-eyed state that nobody could appease…except for one thing.
“He didn’t do anything wrong,” Sherlock said. He’d been staring at Mycroft the entire time, sorting out the puzzle. “Your proportions are all wrong. Look at yourself. You’re … fit.” He sounded incredulous and very, very disappointed.
ooOOOooo
“I would never hurt him,” Sherlock said softly, eyes still on the infant in his lap.
“Right! It was very windy. Who else was blown off course?”
He didn’t panic. He didn’t want to stir up the bees. He himself had no particular fondness for them, always having seen them as a menace more than a curiosity. He waited as patiently as he was able while Sherlock studied the comings and goings of the creatures, propped on his elbows on his belly on the ground, until the light grew too dim and he finally backed away and stood up, dusting the dirt off of his knees.
“Aha! A question, at least. Yes – a preface statement. Such as “Since we’ve already done the preliminaries, and have been in each other’s company on two very different occasions, and since I obviously knew quite a bit about you already before you came here to Rosethorne, and have deduced that the piano had a meaningful place in your past, and could help lead you to a more amenable future, yes, let’s
John unplugged the kettle and took a deep breath. Why the hell was
“Sorry, Sherlock,” he said pleasantly. “SoS and all that.”
are at war. We have everything to lose.”
They both giggled again, and John was beginning to think that perhaps the girls were on to Scorpius Malfoy.
Sherlock.
The bathroom was connected to the living quarters, and John filled a glass with water and brought it back in. He stepped over Sherlock to position himself, then maneuvered his right arm behind the man’s back and pulled him more upright, just long enough for him to swallow a few mouthfuls of water.
“You were.”
“As you’ve undoubtedly deduced from the dirt on the blade, it’s for digging. In the soil.” John used his own shoe in the garden patch beside him to illustrate, kicking up a tangle of dead leaves and a clod of earth.
After all, thought John, it was really none of Mycroft Holmes’ business.
John frowned, huffed, then frowned again.
“How did this even happen, Sherlock?” John had elbowed himself back in until he stood directly below Sherlock.
John dropped his hand from Sherlock’s face and glanced back at Mycroft’s door. He straightened his collar and smoothed out his trousers, and Sherlock snorted softly beside him.
from?”
He grinned and took her hand. “Al Potter. Two dads?” He motioned into the flat behind him and lowered his voice. “My dad’s trying out the boyfriend thing. With my former headmaster.” He gave a pretend shudder and Rosie laughed, but it was all she could talk about when they were finally upstairs in 221B.
“Ha ha! Nice one, Al,” John said with a false laugh as he made a cutting motion across his throat that Sherlock couldn’t see.
When the first human form entered the circle of ground below him, he was a bit distressed to see that it was John. John couldn’t get him down with a wiz-stick. And the wiz-fits couldn’t get him down if Muppets were around. Well – John
Sherlock didn’t waste a moment in collecting his thoughts. He likely didn’t need to.
John thought this rather obvious. “I suppose she figured out she would be sent away – and she wanted to leave on her own terms.”
. These visits don’t occur in hotels, or at his parents’ home on his infrequent visits there. He’s never been popped in on while using the loo at Bart’s. They happen only at 221B. If Mrs. Hudson downstairs has unexplained visitors, she’s never said, though he’s never said either, aside from the first time it happened and he naturally assumed Mrs. Hudson had sent a client up, but she denied it emphatically and looked at him oddly.
“Mycroft sees what is in front of him and interprets it well with a classically trained mind. He read your file after I selected you, and agreed you were an excellent choice. I, however, see what is missing as well as what is there in front of me. I read between the lines, and underneath them, beyond them. For every story, every situation, there is a who, a what, a where, a why and a how. But beyond those, there is the
He waits outside patiently, tapping his cane on the floor beside his foot, watching a CCTV camera in the corner make lazy and seemingly random passes.
Dr. John Watson was not altogether happy.
And suddenly, with Sherlock’s weight against him, with his intentions clear, it wasn’t just a game of chess any longer.
“I am not an unfeeling monster, Dr. Watson. But this is quite an inconvenient time for sentimentality of any sort. The world is at war -
- he’d been about to claim for himself.
He was looking for a solution to a problem - the war effort needed Sherlock.
“I don’t want one to supplant the other,” Sherlock said quietly. “They both have a certain appeal.”
He wondered if he’d be here at Rosethorne long enough to find out.
And he’d let her walk out that door. Had rebuffed her gentle advance.
“Sherlock Holmes! Look at this place!”
“Really, Sherlock? Spying on the neighbor’s party?”
“We have a wedding to get through before we even think about children – magical or Muppets,” Rosie said, giving Sherlock a fond smile.
John read the implication.
“Can’t you…?” Sherlock twirled his finger and tried to look desperate. It wasn’t terribly difficult to look desperate when you were dangling upside down by a parachute and a shoelace in a tree.
“Um – Today, tomorrow and al-?” said Rosie. She looked very confused.
“Rosie, do you have some gallywackers I could borrow?”
“I thought it was an emergency,” he explained. He lifted his right hand to indicate his medical bag. “Annie told me to come at once and to bring my kit.”
“No - at least, not at first. As we don’t yet know how well Sherlock will progress with the work, our main team will keep moving forward with the project.”
He seemed to be talking to the night, to someone hovering about in the air before him, and not to John at all.
John loved Al.  He found him polite, thoughtful, intelligent, responsible, respectful and family-oriented.
But now, Molly’s attention was on Sherlock. Sherlock, who was younger than John, taller, wealthier, smarter, and certainly more attractive. Sherlock, whose family owned all of Rosethorne. Who was so intelligent, so accomplished, that England was waiting for him to recover to end the bloody war. Sherlock, who had hand-picked Molly to come to Rosethorne to work alongside him. It seemed incongruous to think of Sherlock that way, but Sherlock was a man, a man who’d been kept isolated for quite some time. Just because John hadn’t shown an interest in Molly didn’t mean no one else would.
Harry Potter, dressed to move invisibly about London in casual Muggle clothing, slipped inside, tugging a small child by the hand. The child was nattily dressed in pressed trousers and cashmere jumper and pulled against his hand aggressively.
him. He had the oddest sensation that his skin was transparent, that his thoughts were words spinning around his head. But when he looked at her, it was like trying to see through muddy waters into a cloud-filled sky.
But Rosie grinned. “Oh, come on Dad. You know he’s right. He’s a newborn – they all look a bit wrinkled, don’t they?”
“I’ll be fine, Billy. I’ll be with the doctor should anything happen.” He uncrossed his legs. “Where are we going, John? Away from Rosethorne, I’m sure. London? There’s a train at six forty-five, though I hardly think we can sneak aboard without Mycroft’s spies discovering us. We’d have far more luck if you were in disguise as well. Or if we took a later train, though I’m dressed and ready now, and it seems a shame to waste such a lovely disguise on you and Billy.”
“Fine – the Sumo wrestling gear, then?” John shuddered. “I’m glad that was a short-lived phase.”
“I’m sure I’ll get along just fine here, Mrs. Hudson,” he said. He lowered his voice, and leaned in conspiratorially. “I don’t scare easily,” he whispered, giving her the kind of reassuring smile he might have given his mother.
“Well, he’s going to have to document the hell out of it, like it or not,” John said after they watched Sherlock’s meticulous work on the guardian lion a bit longer. “Mycroft isn’t going to give him a pass on this one.”
“Yes. He seems to be have no problems with his hearing.” John watched Sherlock a moment more. “Look – we’re out here, the sun’s about to go down, the moon is already out, there’s even a nice breeze. Why don’t you walk around the garden a few times? Humor me, Sherlock. I’ll walk with you if you’d like.”
“Why would I even
“Sherlock – stop.” John held up his hands, feeling oddly guilty. Sherlock looked so – well, so alive. He did desperately want out of Rosethorne, though John doubted that a stroll in the gardens was at all what he had in mind. “You’re getting miles ahead of yourself, and you know it. We’re just going outside today. For exercise.”
“I suppose Mycroft would tell you that it’s a ridiculous fantasy. That there are more pressing matters at hand.”
Severus narrowed his gaze but Sherlock only stared at the women – or at something on her shoulder – glanced to the side where the young people were all chatting, then shrugged.
He looked, John noted, somewhat delighted.
John’s fingers fumble.
“Wear what?” asked John innocently.
Love consumed him. Love fueled him. Love sustained him.
Sherlock kept his gaze fixed on her.
“One hundred and seventeen,” Sherlock announced loudly. He was fiddling with his buttons and didn’t seem to realise he’d spoken aloud.
“A treehouse - they seem quite popular here at Rosethorne.” He indicated one of the old steps. “Did you and Mycroft wander over here, by any chance?”
“So are you go’in to tell me whose they are?” John asked some time later. His shirt was open and pushed to the side, his trousers and pants bundled at the foot of the bed, and his cock, spent and flaccid, lying against his belly. Sherlock had unlocked the cuffs, and was massaging his injured arm, positioning it back at John’s side.
“In other words,” Mycroft said, “continue to be unassuming Dr. Watson, pleasant but reserved - a man who is serious about his job and does it well, but who would rather be left alone to his own musings and wanderings than engage overly much with the patients and staff. A man dealing with loss, a man healing just as slowly as the patients under your care.”
“You’re quiet,” Sherlock said. “Unusually so.” He didn’t wait for an answer, just tapped the key in his palm. “A crow could hardly carry this,” he murmured. “Perhaps – a large crow, for a short distance. So you didn’t find this key in a crow’s nest, but a crow was guarding it nonetheless. A tree then. The key was in a tree – though how you came to find it there is the real mystery, isn’t it?”
“That was fast,” said John, grinning at Charlie. “Your dad will keep him occupied all day.”
Sherlock was quite still beside him for a moment.
Neither of them acknowledged this, though, and John waited a few more minutes before the physician in him insisted on speaking up.
John, wanting to protest again, closed his mouth instead and stared at Sherlock.
Rosie surprises them with an unannounced visit the following Friday evening, and after hugs and kisses they catch up over dinner. Sherlock brings out the folio as they settle in with coffee after.  He’s already thrown out the multi-level property with the public footpath crossing the property, but left in the cottage that needs extensive repairs. John looks suspicious, but consents to looking up each property on his mobile and scrolls through the photos, and Rosie leans over his shoulder and offers an occasional “Oh Dad – that’s just lovely.”
“Sherlock? Sherlock!”
Logistically, it was a nightmare.
. I do realise it’s wartime but surely Mycroft has hired someone to take care of the grounds.”
“You should make yourself a chair,” Molly suggested. “You obviously don’t find this bench very comfortable. You need to design something with the right proportions for you.”
“I believe it was one of your conditions, John. When you agreed with Mycroft that I was fit enough to work again. Six o’clock, then?”
On Sunday, Mycroft Holmes announced that Miss Adler had been located, and had been moved to a care facility in London. Mrs. Hudson made the announcement at breakfast, reading from a typewritten sheet.
It was a bee hive, in a split low in the trunk. He could see the bees now, crowding the edges of the split, a few buzzing about in the air a foot or two above the earth.
Somehow, Severus and Sherlock had managed to get to the nuptial circle. Severus grabbed Sherlock’s hand with his right hand and Arthur’s with his left while John found his place beside Sherlock. He had no idea how he actually got there but was thinking that now would be a very good time to deploy those parachutes.
“And we’ll eat at his place – so I can deduce him properly.”
“Top ten cases,” Sherlock said from the sofa where he was stretched out with a book on his chest. “No particular order.”
“Ah. Well, then.” John cleared his throat as Sherlock continued his examination. “A treehouse - twelve or fourteen feet up - looks like there are  - were – eight – nine - ten stepping boards. Quite old - the tree has nearly swallowed most of the boards. They’re sturdy.” He tugged on one of the steps, and it didn’t so much as wiggle. “Don’t you think it odd to find a treehouse at a guest cottage?” he asked.
"A bit." Mycroft approached him slowly, and John saw that his gait was somewhat uneven. He narrowed his eyes as his heart sank. He felt almost violently ill.
John smiled. “Lestrade has the key. We’ve only got to ask him – but I haven’t figured out how to go about doing that.”
Across the room, Sherlock let the curtain drop back into place and bent to pick up his violin and bow which had been resting against the wall beside the window. He sank back into his chair, violin balanced on his knees, and began adjusting the strings, looking up at John after several quiet minutes passed.
John scoffed. “You’re confusing your verb tenses.
The second jump was even more exciting, terrifying and adrenaline-stimulating than the first. There was no time for hesitation or error. Every step had to be executed with perfect timing and precision.
romantic encounter.” Sherlock tipped his own head back, staring at the chandelier along with John, and John acknowledged the correction with a squeeze of his hand.
Unless it was more than a romp. Unless – unless it was a puzzle, of sorts. A locked gate. A mysterious menagerie where once had stood a maze.
“While you tell me about James Sholto,” countered John, curiously pleased at evoking this reaction in Sherlock.
John, feeling oddly protective of the strange key he’d taken from the tree, and somewhat picked on by the crow, patted his pocket, feeling the key’s weight.
“Care to come?” John asks, poking his head in the door. “Might be interesting.”
John whistled. “I thought Lily – ”
link.
ooOOOoo
“I trust you, Dr. Watson, really, I do,” she said.
He stopped at last, leaned his head against the cool wood and closed his eyes – waited – until the thudding in his brain retreated.
He did not.
“He’s not bigger than me
“You have nothing to be embarrassed about, Sherlock,” said George, who’d been passing behind Sherlock. “Your brain makes up for you other…shortcomings.”
“No belt loops – and I don’t have suspenders, John. I can’t go dashing about the Manor at night with my trousers about my ankles.”
Sherlock had been fiddling with a button on his cuff.
“She’s gone and given you moons and stars,” John said, running his fingers over the just-there shapes. “Subtle. I like it.”
Lestrade lowered his head at the praise, and John was reminded that until just a few moments ago, this place had been Lestrade’s secret retreat, a work in progress that no one - at least as far as he knew - had seen, that no one had judged.
important to mention that he has
She disappeared sometime in the night, after he went to bed at ten o’clock and before he was awakened by a hand clapped over his mouth at three in the morning.
“Of course not. She’ll find out soon enough when the whole thing implodes.”
“Crows have long memories,” Sherlock called to him as he continued forward to complete his circuit. “This one recognises you.”
He hadn’t missed that statement. It, and the details of his past experience with epileptic seizures – he would educate Billy later on about his use of the term
Eleven fifteen and Sherlock’s door opens. He blinks in the muted sunlight, then stumbles into the loo while Rosie squeals and starts a hyper-speed crawl toward the closed bathroom door. Gifts are forgotten, save the new plushie with its sodden antenna, while John makes tea and Rosie watches Sherlock fly the bee around the sitting room.
“Do you have family?” he asked. “Besides your mum, I mean.”
Someone, someone dressed entirely in white, moved into the circle of grass directly below him and was staring up at him. The person looked entirely too amused given his precarious situation.
“Haven’t you Apparated before?” he asked. “With you mum? To Diagon Alley?”
“And I didn’t have a family then!”
What the hell? Was this some kind of test?
“Do you have an objection, then?” asked Holmes, eyes narrowing just enough for John to take notice. “Or perhaps an attachment of your own to Miss Adler?” He said the last with voice dangerously low, raising an eyebrow suggestively.
“Well, it must be family, don’t you think?” she’d answered. “If it were someone in the service, they’d be in the infirmary with the other patients.” She shrugged. “This is the Holmes estate - I just assumed it was one of his parents. You know how this set is about privacy.”
He spoke more to Mycroft then to John.
“Ridiculous,” said Sherlock, eyes following his sister-in-law with her perfectly coiffed do as she wandered over to the other Harry and Severus to introduce herself. Harry grinned at something she said, then said something to Severus and then Severus was laughing and chatting with her. They glanced over at Sherlock and Felicity waved. Sherlock lifted his hand reluctantly.
“Your
“Good reflexes. You played, didn’t you?” called out a voice above him.
The first thing John saw as he blinked against the muted light from the doorway was the reflection of his face in the mirrors that circled the room. He looked a different man - disheveled and relaxed. Where had the rigidity with which he’d carried himself for so long gone?
“I learned from the master,” John quipped.
Mycroft Holmes sounded deadly serious.
“I wasn’t alone. Irene was already there, and our plan was airtight. She’d have them thoroughly incapacitated and all I had to do was break into the room where they were holding Mycroft, take him out a dormer window onto the roof and escape down the ladder. I had no idea he’d injured his leg when he was captured – or what being locked up for so long had done to his mind.” He dropped his voice, and John squeezed his hand.
your keeper. The orders I’ve just had drilled into my skull by my commanding officer are very specific on the matter. My job is - to put it simply -
“Gone again,” lamented Mrs. Hudson. “Just a few hours ago.” She sighed. “He’d gone two weeks without an attack, hadn’t he? I was beginning to think we wouldn’t need you after all, Dr. Watson.”
And he did understand – at least he thought he did. He knew how memory worked, could not sit down at the piano without thinking of his mother, his grandmother, even of Mary. Could not smell the roses in the garden without seeing his mother’s face in profile as she knelt to tend the soil. He’d stopped attending church services long ago, when the hymns had recalled her pain, and even the alleluias had heralded her death. That this discovery would be new to Sherlock seemed remarkable indeed, but Sherlock, John had discovered, was not put together like most other people.
“Thirty minutes, John!”
Sherlock Holmes gripped by a seizure, Billy Wiggins forcibly holding him down.
As John sat at the piano, slowly working through the simple scale, forcefully, while the sunlight through the coloured glass danced a kaleidoscope across the back of his hand, he knew what he
Sherlock Holmes needed time to heal. He needed exercise, and sleep to follow. Deep, undisturbed sleep. He needed fresh air, and something to divert his mind from the exertion he subjected it to in trying to recover the mental organisation and stability he’d lost. He needed distance from the books and papers and formulas and research, reminders of what he was before, what he wanted to be again.
The song was still in his head, in his
Which was odd, John thought, as Mycroft Holmes stood at the gate with him, looking in at the neglected childhood tableau, careful not to touch the gate with his hands or his suit. He’d never before, during the entirely of this war and of his service, questioned the necessity of serving his country, or the moral
John stared at the piano, trying to ignore that Molly somehow was aware that he knew how to play. Or had – once. If she knew, then she’d been told by Mycroft Holmes, as he’d not mentioned this lost talent to anyone at Rosethorne. He couldn’t imagine that his childhood skills – musical or otherwise – would have made it into his official military file, and, not for the first time, wondered how Mycroft Holmes knew what he knew, and more importantly, why he'd bothered to dig into his past so deeply.
“Aw, that’s lovely,” he said, watching Sherlock gingerly touch the jeweled pendant as he looked at it in the mirror above the fireplace. “You’ll be the bell of the ball.”
perfect) and, just as Molly knew he would, then grabbed the unicorn by her horn and lay her on his other shoulder. “Have you named them yet?” he asked, kissing her on the cheek as he carried them both towards the bedroom.
“Brat,” Steve muttered, and ducked back into the kitchen.
Gregory was always fantastic with the boys. There had never been a question that he
“I’d s’dill hurted!”
“Wha’d ‘new’?” Sherlock repeated, staring at him blankly.
...Shit.
“I see,” he said, dryly.
Sherlocks’ bottom lip wobbled as he shook his head with the enthusiasm of a wet dog, his curls swishing fast enough that Greg actually felt a breeze coming off of them. He tightened his grip on the little detectives’ slender waist to keep him from toppling onto the floor and starting a whole new fuss all over again.
“As if that’s not something that happens every time they stay over,” Greg snorted, and filled each cup. “Look,” he sighed, setting the milk aside to screw the lids on both cups good and tight; “They sounded fine a second ago. A movie’s not gonna bother them all that much.”
Which, usually, was okay...he did love his My’coff very much.
“…I'ds g'woss in here.”
’ me!” the halfling snapped. “You’re not going to…THORIN!” he squawked as he was suddenly grasped by the wrist and pulled off the trail.”NO!”
Alone.
"It'd be a shame is Gregs shiny new paddle in Not so silent night only got used once ;) ;) can we see it be put to good use again for day 15?"
Sherlock stood back, and crossed his arms. “Show me how you do it,” he said.
admit this out loud!…relieved that he would soon have the sagging mound of wet fabric ‘round his waist replaced with dry, fresher ones. Part of the reason he’d been lagging behind was that his thighs were starting to chafe terribly.
“Um…chi’bs?” Jawn followed every instruction as Sherlock stripped him of his clothes and went about changing him into a nappy, feeling every worry, every fear, every stress slip away until there was…
Which was adorable. Very much so. And it made Mycroft smile in turn. He softly kissed the back of Jawns’ hair.
The intercom sounded off again;“…Master Bruce.”
“We cooould–” Steve took his time dowsing Bucky’s bits in a cloud of powder; “–stop by the very next McDonalds we see.”
Jawn, naturally, paid Mycroft’s utterings no mind, leaving him to ramble on and hold his bottle as the little one delightedly tapped the brightly-coloured icon for ‘Candy Crush’.
Sherlock wouldn’t (couldn’t? That was terribly sad to think) look him in the eye. Greg watched as he chewed on his thumb and fiddled with one of the tapes on his nappy, which would normally earn him a pop on the back of his hand but, y’know, under the circumstances…
“Game on then, little warrior!”
Sherlock peered at the dummy, going a bit cross-eyes, as it was inches from his face. He looked up at John, watching for a reaction.
Jawns’ throat clenched, and he swallowed painfully against the lump he felt forming in it. That word kept resonating through his head: alone.
Both John and Greg began to whoop and cheer as the next two rockets whizzed off with another set of loud bangs and sparks in quick succession, and Sherlock shaded his eyes with his hand as he watched. As much as he hated the noise, he still enjoyed the lights…as long as they stayed far way from–
“G'EG!!! ST'AHP!!!” Sherlock squealed.
“D’yi’yah,” she slurred, reaching across Sherlock’s back to hold her new friend’s ear.
The package of wipes was sitting in front of Jawn, opened. Several wipes had been pulled out and crumpled, littering the floor like tents at an outdoor concert.

he was going to cry, because that had really,
With dinner both in the oven and on top of the stove (and with nothing in danger of burning anytime soon), Steve peeked his head into the living room to check on Bucky.
him, as well.
“Lo’ds of good stuff,” Jawn said, and then pushed over three small, clear bags of candies in the shape of bones and skulls. “Those is yours. I don’ like ‘em.”
, he was so fucking cute. “...You know who loves you, muffin?”
’ Sherlock noticed--and peeled away it’s face.
Dicks room was up the stairs and at the other end of the manor, but Bruce still came to a stop right outside the door just as he heard Alfred count to “…Seven…”, followed by a softer, tearful “…S-se'ben…”
“I know.” Thorin settled Bilbo on his lap, facing him, and made him lay against his chest as he held him and took over rubbing his bum.
“Alright, alright...everyone get their three chuckles in, go on,” he grumbled as he sat up.
Jawn went in first with no problem, but Sherlock stopped just inside the doorway, blocking both his brother and Greg. “My’coff!” he whinged, with his small, curly baby-bunches bouncing on either side of his head. “Le’d me as’g a que’th’tion!”
Harry pulled his arm free from the plush, hooded dragon towel he was wrapped in, and tapped his lips. “Hmmm…only one?” he asked in a tiny voice, peeking at Hermione over his shoulder.
“Not for another few hours, yet. You don’t want one?”
Mycroft nudged the back of Sherlock’s nappy with his foot. “Brat. But I accept your offer.”
Bucky gave the lump of playdough he’d been carrying a squeeze; "Wha’d is i’d?”
at Greg.
Thor stopped.
time?
Greg watched as Sherlock’s face crumbled, and felt every ounce of irritation melt away as the little detective started to cry.
Thor held up his hands to proclaim his innocence, but his eyes still held a spark of mischief in them. “No trouble meant, brother. But I also remember a certain tiny, raven-haired infant who also worried our Mother about the breast day and night until she was frazzled and worn.”
“Yes, but–!”
With what, exactly, was unimportant to Loki…it always hurt Mama’s heart to see any of her dumplings in pain, no matter what the reason, and seeing the tight, pinched look on Steves’ face made her want to scoop him up and cuddle him to her bosom and promise to fix anything and everything wrong with her little one.
Nat tapped her lips with her finger. “Mmmm…d’ish one,” she said, pointing to a shimmery pale lilac.
Well...he
“Indeed,” sighed Alfred, and the fact that Bruce could hear the relief in his voice was a testament to how rough of a time his big boy must be having tonight.
! “Greg is so-so-so-so sorry, you’re okay though! Yes, you’re okay! It was an accident!” He repeated over and over, making a mantra out of it, because as long as he said ‘You’re okay!”  enough times then it really would be okay, out of principle.
But…there were so goddamn
He felt a broad hand come to rest on his lower back and begin making slow, comforting circles with its thumb; “Poor monkey,” they cooed. “Waking up wet and alone...what a terrible tragedy.”
There were days when Steve would literally go down on one knee and thank God…or whoever else was listening or cared up there, because after everything he’d seen over the years, he wouldn’t put it past chance that Earth was just sitting in some sort of massive alien petri dish for some extraterrestrial kids’ science fair project.
“Ooo, exotic…that’s going to make those pretty brown eyes glow, isn’t it?” Loki set the palette aside and reached for Tony’s hips, sliding him closer. “Are you going to be a good little dumpling for Mama and sit still while she pretties you up, hm?”
“One after each other in quick succession,” Lee said. “We’re taking up bigger planes this time, and our timing has to be perfect. Since we won’t have enough time to become experienced aerial acrobats, we’ll be helping you all out with a nudge here and there to get you in formation.”
Sherlock cut him off with a scoff of dismissal.
“Oh, Merlin, Professor, that’s so old,” answered Lily as Harry mouthed the answer along with her. “Ex- Smelly-Armus.”
Sherlock had exaggerated the word
He did understand why they’d chosen this location, at least from a security standpoint. It was difficult to locate, had a series of locked doors to navigate to gain entrance, and was certainly safer than the upstairs rooms from bombardment. Yet John immediately saw the liabilities, too. They needed an escape route - stairs that led directly up and outside would be best, though that would in turn open up a vulnerability from the outside. A window - but even a casement window would be unlikely in a building this old. A second set of stairs leading to the main floor, then. Reserve stores. Candles or oil lamps. A source of water. A bath - a loo, at the minimum.
“So you
She turned her whole face towards him, her mouth dropping open in surprise. “You c’n do tha’d?”
to imagine. He took another drink and went back to listening to Gloin boasting about his little pebble back home.
” Sherlock screeched again, setting off a fresh wave of tears and hiccups.
“Hi’yariou’sh,” the baby parroted as he settled himself in front of Greg, legs splayed.
.’ “It’s fine!” Greg called again, then lowered his voice to whisper in Sherlocks’ ear. “Muffin, please,
“Why do you think Uncle John’s nickname is ‘monkey’?”
“Ohhhhhh,” Jawn looked back down at his candy as he nodded, sagefully. “Tha’ds why.”
“Shut up,” Loki cooed, still smiling at Nat as he tipped her in his lap, the way she preferred to lay when she was nursing, and then freed his breast.
In his defense, it was an accident.
Mycroft groaned. “Fright Night? Really???”
“Yeah, you! It’s all you tonight, big man!” Bucky poked Steve’s tummy, making him scrunch over giggling, and then gave him a big, smacking wet kiss on the cheek. “Love you, baby,” he said, placing Steve on his feet. “Keep Thor safe and make him eat something other than poptarts.”
…He couldn’t hold it.
Mycroft sighed; if Gregory could put on show, so could he. “You’re
He was nearly asleep. She bent forward and ghosted a soft kiss on his forehead, and smiled when his face crinkled up at the touch.
Good. That was loads better than screaming.
He didn’t mind. “Fussy little moo-cow,” he said, kissing Mycroft on the cheek before letting him hold his bottle. “How much do you love me, huh? How much?…This much?” He reached up and squeezed one of the horns, making it go “MooOooOOoo!” in a warbly way. Greg gasped; “THAT much?!? You flatterer!”
,’ Stephen thought. Okay. New tactic.
“Eat up, little one…it’s been a long day!” Ori ruffled his hair playfully, and went back to sit with his brothers. Dori looked downright proud of him.
...And maybe so was he, just a little.
“What makes you think I--?!” Greg began to half-heartedly protest...in vain, he might add, since he was sure he was already caught out.
God, how Mycroft wished he had his fucking
Bucky blinked at him, waiting for an answer.
Shit. Shit, shit, shit...
“That is an ‘I’m hurt’-cry,” Mycroft said, appearing next to John. He leaned over as well and frowned down into the sitting room; “What. Happened.”
“...Maaaay’bee.”
“I thumped his nose.” There. That was over with. The hardest part. “...A bit harder than I meant to.”
Sherlock sighed as John disappeared into the kitchen. He was right, of course (though Sherlock would never admit it), and he actually was looking forward to another holiday spent with his brother (he’d never admit
”…You know I can get the paddle right back out, Gregory.“
“I think we should start shoving those liquids,” Thor told Bruce without taking his eyes off of Tony for a moment.
Mycroft’s head snapped back to glare at him; “Oh,
“You sneaky little biscuit. C’mere…” Greg stood up with a grunt before taking Sherlock under his arms and heaving him up onto his hip. “Love you, muff’n’stuff,” he said, and gave the babe in arms a kiss on the cheek as he carried him towards the kitchen.
Unaware of his own actions, Sherlock reached for the drawstring of his pajamas at his waist, and began fiddling with it. "Some time'th,” he said, with a hint of a lisp…a lisp that usually showed up when he was tired or Little.
Jawn mirrored Mycroft and tilted his head, pouting. “...U’b?”
“Very, very much.” Severus bent down and kissed Harry’s forehead before bundling him up in his arms. “It was much too quiet in these drafty old rooms without my little fawn prancing through the halls.”
,’ he immediately thought to himself, mid-rant. ‘
“That’s alright, baby girl,” he said as he pulled his hand back out and rubbed his fingers together, testing their slickness before putting them to Nat’s lips and letting her suck them clean…and then going back for more.
Stephen gasped exaggeratedly, his mouth dropping open and his eyes going comically wide. “Wait…what, what’s this?!” he asked voice full of awe, and reached out to poke one of Tony’s bare legs.
Mycroft put his finger to his lips as he considered this; “Five with the paddle.”
The steaming cup was passed back to John, who carefully forged a path through the minefield of discarded wrapping paper, bows, boxes, and gifts until he made his way to the coffee table, and sat there. “Molly? Cupcake?…You still with us?” he asked, tilting his head to look at her.
we finish Princess Tony.”
“C’n ha’b a sh’tory, Da’yee?” he asked, gently playing with a lock of Severus’s hair by twirling it around his finger. “Jus’ one? P’yea’sh?”
Mycroft smiled at Greg’s back as he left the room, until he heard his footsteps treading up the stairs. He turned back to the movie that, admittedly, both boys seemed to be enjoying. “...What are you munching on down there, hm?” he asked Jawn, since he was getting a front row seat to the sounds of his vigorous chewing.
Considerate, know-it-all bastards.
“Oh, Christ.”
"W-we’d,” Bucky snuffled.
At the sound of his voice, Greg and the baby both turned to find John standing in front of them, his hands parked on his hips and glaring daggers, mostly at Greg (okay, all at Greg).
“G’eg! Why come I can’d?!?” Jawn fussed.
Greg looked up, then; Mycroft was leaning against the door, arms crossed, and regarding Greg coolly.
“I’d is?” Jawn automatically held his arms up, before Sherlock could even ask him to.
He waited until he could no longer hear Mycroft’s voice travel down the hall before slumping down to sit on the end of the bed, his chin in his hands. Dammit. Why did he have to go and get pissy…pissier than he had to be, anyway. He could’ve accomplished the same thing without hurting the baby’s feelings.
Loki had been expecting a fight with this one; he had seen firsthand that Steve Rogers was a tough nut to crack, even with people that were considered to be the mans’ friends. Always with the brave, stoic face that let nothing show, never letting the facade slip, never a hair out of place, never a twitch of the lips that betrayed anything felt beneath the surface.
But, while it was very much Not Daddy, Jawn knew exactly who it was.
) bags of candy and other ghastly goodies along with them...for the past four
The life suddenly sprang back into Sherlock’s eyes. “Oh, y’ah?”
And, he may as well text his brother while he was at it, and see when the twat would be dragging his gallivanting boyfriend home with him. He tapped in the passcode with his thumb.
“Frigh’d Nigh’d!” Sherlock said, his eyes lighting up at the prospect.
She gazed up at Sherlock again, and he wiggled his fingers at her, waiting.
"I can't add the meme anonymously but I figured why have I been asking anonymously anyway when this isn't even my main account and nobody has to know who I am?"
. God, he was such an asshole. “Oh, muffin,” Greg sighed as he hugged Sherlock to his chest; “Greg’s sorry...that was an accident, love,” he added with a gentle kiss to the little detectives’ temple and started to rock him, little as it did to soothe him.
Bilbo, had not.
“You…aren’t gonna smack me?”
Oh, wait. Picnic tables. That was actually kinda perfect?
“BIG SCA’WY!” both boys cheered, just as Jawn upended his entire bag of candy onto the floor in a shower of bright, shiny wrappers. A popcorn ball wrapped in cellophane dotted with grinning Jack o’ Lanterns bounced out of the pile and rolled across the floor.
shit. “Yeah, sorry,” he said, now mirthless and somber, and went to the fuse box to flip all the breakers back on.
Bruce looked up at him, still smiling, and held his hand out…as the empty space next to him started to sputter and flicker to life in a shower of orange sparks.
“You are.” Sherlock reached down and did the snaps, and used a sneaky finger to make sure Jawn’s nappy was nice and snug. “And the first thing Daddy is going to do for his tiny baby, is make him a bottle while we wait for our chips to arrive.”
A sound that could possibly-maybe-perhaps be mistaken for a giggle came from his shoulder. Mycroft smiled...another win.
“Je-jesus f-fucking Christ,” John covered his mouth and snuffled into his hand, then coughed to clear his throat.
“My hands are just as frozen as yours,
Sherlock flinched as the first rocket went whistling into the air and went off with a loud bang, sending showers of colorful sparks flying above their heads.
“Push on…?”
“What did they pick?”
“Sure...
Sherlock looked up from his phone; “…Jawn?”
Ah, fine. Sherlock needed a break from staring at his screen, anyway…at least, if he wanted the fuzzy black ring around his vision to fuck off, at least.
“Good to hear, y’ah little sadist.”  Greg wrapped his arms around the baby and squished him up close, making him squeal, and gave him a big, smacking kiss on the cheek. “Let’s change your bum then, before you start to stink even more than y’ah already do.”
