"Abomination," he repeats obediently, like it's nothing, like it's not obscene.  "I'm not an angel, but what this mortal body holds within it isn't and will never be human.  I shouldn't even exist, much less have survived so long in this form."
Dean takes a drink of water, fighting down the temptation to verbalize her relationship with sheep in Yiddish, via Joe being awesome.  "You scared Cas last night."
"She was right," Joe says.  "On a guess, some repurposed fireworks and a working knowledge of homemade explosives for the initial destruction, which wouldn't be as rare as you think for anyone who grew up on the family farm or took a shop class or two in high school."
Coming up beside him, Castiel stares at Amanda for a long moment.  "At least a mile with any reliability, but to be safe, behind Chitaqua's wards would be the my preference to assure there's no possibility that Alison--"
Reluctantly, Dean turns his head to squint up at her; it may be his imagination, but he thinks she just might be glowing.  "You have any suggestions?"
"Zack," Cas says, inexplicably pouring three cups of coffee and fixing each one, "did not."  Picking up the first one, he gives it to Teresa and then glances at Alison, who shifts a chair close enough to nudge Teresa in the back of the knees.  "Sit down.  You'll accomplish nothing with hysterics."
"Dean."
"He's fine," Vera says abruptly, which Dean doesn't acknowledge because he already knows that.  That thread's a rope right now, and he can feel the low, nearly subliminal hum of Cas's unconscious mind, no fear or distress or horror or revulsion or endless agony, just--rest.
Cas hesitates, blue eyes suddenly unreadable.  "It's been a very long time since I did that."
"Your last master flogged you," Sempronia says suddenly and looks appalled at herself.  "You need not speak of it, of course."
"Headache or nausea?"
? Seriously?--while the moon weeps crystalline tears in lonely solitude?"
"Shut.  Up," he grits out through a smile that will never stop and gets absolutely no reaction from anyone around him; so maybe that wasn't out loud?  "Get up," he tells a mother, two mobile kids, and a baby in a carseat (he takes the carseat, she's barely able to stay upright) walking them to the door and outside before going back for the next, unable to remember what number he's on (fifty, five thousand, forever); it doesn't look like anyone is coming by Third or if they are, they sure as fuck aren't paying attention to what's going on around Volunteer Services.
--because Dean wants her to like him and he's unhappy that she doesn't.  Because being in a militia camp is more like being in high school than high school, or so he assumes if the most recent drama that's Kyle and Jane's mid-dinner fight in the mess last night is any indication; it's not like he stayed at any one long enough to get past the introductions.
"Yeah," she says, and Castiel follows her and Dean down the hall, out of earshot of those waiting. "Seriously, Dean--"
Scraping wet hair from his face, he almost stumbles at the reminder of what Dean told him yesterday night.
"Perfect," he says softly. Dean ducks his head, cheeks faintly pink, and he's almost overcome with the impulse to taste growing heat beneath his skin.
"Soon," Dean murmurs soothingly, tangling his fingers in Castiel's hair as he surveys his domain in satisfaction.  An army unlike anything ever seen in Hell forms under Castiel's supervision, broken souls already remade on the rack remade anew here to the singular purpose of serving Dean's pleasure, and his pleasure now is to take the submission of every territory in Hell and sit unopposed on its Throne for all of Time.  "In fact--" At the sound of heavy thump, he looks at something over Castiel's head, grin widening.  "Check it out."
.  "C-Cas?"
They went through a lot of treatments, that much he was told, but it wasn't until she left the clipboard on his bed that he understood what that really meant.  He pulled out the bottom ten pages before she came back to get it--considering the number, barely noticeable--and read through them during his designated nap times (read: whenever either Cas or Vera decided he looked tired and they were only mostly right) trying to figure out what the hell happened to him.  It's not that Cas wouldn't tell him if he asked; it's that whatever happened, he's not sure Cas is ready to talk about all of it.  The two times his heart stopped are worrying, but not nearly as much as why the last one has a lot of cross-outs, entire areas of potential prognosis scratched out entirely.
"But--just hear me out--why not now, try it out, just to see what happens?" Dean asks in a rush, leaning forward.  "I'll be in Ichabod for a few days, you'll be here, and hey, you have some free time, so maybe listen to some reports, make sure James isn't the new Sid and kills his team on a bridge, anything comes up, you handle it. You know, exactly what you've been doing before and what you were going to do anyway while I was gone, same old same old, no surprises here."
"That's fine," he answers easily.  "Anytime you're ready."
And Nate did.
Shaking himself--Christ, get the fuck over yourself already--he flips the light off and veers straight for the bedroom door.  "Be right back."
"Got it, be better company to the recovering junkie before I drive you to drink again," Dean says, with an edge that suggests unless he wishes for a fight, this subject is closed.  "Anything else?"
"And you like me anyway," he says. "So how long until you're ready to leave?"
"Actually, I can."  Teresa's eyes narrow.  "The formalities required of an angel when interacting with Creation--which includes the earth and all that concerns it--no longer apply.  It's a matter of courtesy, and I'm willing to discard that at need or simply for spite.  This would be need, but spite isn't off the table."
Matt shakes his head, taking another drink.  "She slows down to let us catch up.  Sometimes."
He's not sure if that's scary or kind of sad.  "No idea. I was--"
"I do not understand--"
"Trust me," Alicia says with a grin, "she'll like it in about five seconds."
"He doesn't trust me and believes I'm taking advantage of your illness for my personal benefit."  What Sidney could possibly think he's getting out of this other than a constant source of low-grade stress is something he has yet to discover.  "And that I'm denying him his right to have his own team from spite, which isn't entirely inaccurate, though his incompetence is my primary motivation."
"My mom," Joelle answers, "is training to qualify for Amanda's next class.  She and a few other are working on better ways to hide weapons in our headscarves."  She points to her own, a patterned blue-green to match her thermal, as intricately folded as origami. "Mom asked me to test this one today; ask me what Iâ€™m carrying."
Panting, Dean withdraws only enough for gasped air but no farther, forehead pressed against his own. "Cas," he whispers, twisting his hips and sending a shock through Castiel's body he can feel vibrating in his teeth. "Yeah, gotta--
"I like it--one change, though."  Leaning his head on his hand.  "If I go down, my first choice is you."
"Joe's 'totally everyone's buddy' shtick, Zack's 'woe as me, hot guys are fighting over me', Sean actually falling for it, and Mira...." It takes him a moment to realize that sound is Alicia grinding her teeth as she glares at the floor.
"A formal supplication is a contract," Castiel recites, and to her shock, Alistair closes his eyes, looking pained. "A Master doesn't ever have to accept a request for supplication, but if they do, they are required to listen until the time limit negotiated before the formal supplication begins is reached; in the absence of a negotiated time limit, of course, the limit is subject to the supplication's discretion.  I didn't realize you were unaware of that before we began or I would have explained." He pauses, smiling faintly.  "I did apologize with sufficient prostration, I think."
"What's the difference?" he asks.  "As I was then, so am I now.  The body I wear is human enough--as least in a general sense, the specifics less so--but what is within it is not."
"Setting the bones?  No sweat, I could do it in my sleep.  Didn't even have to worry about infection, just made sure he stayed down until they were healed." She hesitates, chewing her lip uncomfortably before adding, "Cas didn't want you to know.  Darryl was the only doctor we had, and he didn't think--"
"Risa's team," Cas answers, then sighs.  "I liked her very much.  Or I would have if I liked anybody.  She wasn't afraid."
"Cas?  Why didn't you--"
"There was a time when the number of hunters were still far too few and villages were spread far apart and had few protections against the supernatural.  Angels couldn't be everywhere at once, and there are limits to what they--we could do to help.  Within the purview of my garrison, one village was subject to a series of vicious attacks, and they wouldn't survive another."
"Erica wants my wife."
The break in his voice would be reminder enough if he hadn't.  "I know."
Following Cas's gaze to the wall, Dean realizes there's something missing. "So where're the sigils?"
"Twenty-one south, moving west," Gretchen says.  "I saw a few stragglers grouped just east of the South gate, but from the way they were moving, they're the most wounded.  Pretty sure they're hiding from the others."
"Yes, dear, of course," Alison answers with syrupy sweetness.  "Fran finally banging Stuart was better than morphine, I noticed that."
Dodging sideways as it leaps, Castiel slices a thin line along its side when it passes, close enough to smell the acrid-sulfur of its breath.  Rolling onto his feet, he darts back as it howls, the snow hissing with every drop of dark blood as it twists to face him.  Dividing his attention between his current opponent and listening for the rest of the pack, he follows the wide arc of its stalk around him.
?" she demands, almost half-out of her chair.  "Or that I don't want to?"
Alicia cocks her head.  "Cas?"
The memory of screaming is soaked into everything, thickening the air until he can barely breathe.  Getting to his feet, he stares in horror at the people nailed to walls splashed with drying blood, some still groaning, heads dipping limply toward the floor, others painfully silent.  None of them are dead, not yet; this is so much worse.
"Gotta keep that soul safe," he agrees contentedly, which makes Cas snort a laugh, ruffling his hair.  "So new way to die: hypothermia.  Like living in an Ice Age, but sadder, since we're gonna die because you didn't think to inspect our cabin."
"Celebrations and my limited experience with them," he says in relief.  "Surely there's more to them, and I'd like to find out what."
"Not like there aren't a lot of tools," Alicia says unexpectedly.  "All you have to do is know how to use it, you know?"
Dean contemplates how you pick up a skillset that includes conversationally relevant sex jokes. "Everything I do," he hears himself say, "I'm saying that it's okay to do this or it's not.  Dude, this didn't go well when it was just
Adjustment: Dean can now fully appreciate the view--what did Cas call it?--right, on the

Dean snorts.  "Not so sure about that."
"For the latter, that was the general assumption from what I understand.  The former, however, is the other thing that I can't remember," he says, finishing the tortilla and taking a second, spreading it out on the tray before loading it with potato-onion-pepper thing, chorizo, and cheese (that Dean grated himself, thank you).
"Then trust me now." Tightening his grip on the butt, he calculates the least damaging angle.  "I apologize for the headache in advance.  The kit in the car has a sedative; I'll use that on the way."
"Chafing does discourage going without," Cas muses, like he tested this extensively at some point, which is even less of a surprise than Cas being a shitty poker player.
Gaius's smile fades into uncertainty.  "My mother: after this, will sheâ€¦."
Dean steps closer to trace a thin brown line going south, bare of ornamentation, wondering about the wide areas that don't have any color at all; places that didn't get the memo, maybe?  "The colored roads are the exact routes on those Xeroxes, making sure everyone took these specific roads and joined at these specific points."
"What?"
Checking the street (no sign of Wendy, might be good or bad; a few people too far away to even risk a shout but he tries a failed wave: thanks, fuckers), he lets the door shut and starts toward the volunteers near the midpoint.  Halfway there, his boot lands in something that makes a sucking, sticky sound when he lifts his foot; looking down, he blinks at the small pool of half-dried blood and follows it to the dead body, freezing in place, seeing short, dark hair and a slit of lifeless blue.
"Shh," Haruhi says, glaring up at him before taking the lamp back and handing the bag to Vera.  Flipping it open, Vera smiles at the contents before closing the flap almost reverently and hefting it over one shoulder.  "Six bottles," she confirms, crossing her arms.  "Per my deal with Amanda.  You want more, I'm willing to negotiate."
Dean opens his mouth to answer--there are a lot of reasons, and all of them sane--but the laughter that comes out instead cuts him off at the knees.  Punching Gabriel in his smug face knowing he couldn't even
From here, he can see Alison begin to tremble, then her fingers close around the edge of her chair, knuckles going white.  Castiel's aware of a sense of growing pressure, filling the room to bursting as she surrounds Sudha's fragile mind with herself, protection and defense and utter determination coloring it in shades of red-green and hot gold.  To get through it, Alison will need to be torn apart.  He remembers the sweep of Alison's mind through the town the day the Croats attacked Ichabod for the children; then, panic and still uncertain skill left her groping for what to do, but raw power she doesn't lack, and she's never lacked will.

"Technically speaking, while prophecy didn't require a Dean Winchester specific to this world being present, you are still a
It's--very much a room.
Jesus, this is going to be a shitty night.  "So I'm gonna go--"
A question he forgot to ask Cas that day: exactly how many Snuggies constitute all the sizes and all the colors including those not found in stores?  "How many boxes is all of them?"
"--and stopped," he says tonelessly, vaguely aware he's been talking but unable to remember when he started or why.  "They entertained themselves with raping them while waiting for it to dry--they had to wait, because the nuns were protected against possession.  That's why they used paint; they couldn't risk a single smear, and the nuns would find a way to break it no matter how badly they were injured if they used chalk."
"You think this is about
"Next up: everything that goes wrong with a lot of people, not enough space, and challenges in sanitary conditions.  Just know now, we're going to try and bribe Vera to leave Chitaqua and come here," Dolores says wryly.  "Karl and I are making up a benefit package, may include worship and offerings of anything she wants, and I do mean anything."
in idiotically typewriter quality print because Sam was--is--was like that.  It's not just five years of absence, not here; this is his entire life at four, at fourteen, at twenty-four ruthlessly stripped bare and clean, Sam at one, at eleven, at twenty one scrubbed clean as if he never existed at all.
vicious fuckers.
, Alison told him; so that's what she meant.  "She can tell something, but yeah, throwing our baby psychic at Micah's like asking a guy who jogs a couple of times a week to do the Boston Marathon the next day.  Cas?"
"Like you never fucked off," Kyle mutters, and he has to give him points for courage, or at least obtuseness in the face of disaster.  "What's the difference?"
"I know that was the last time anyone tried to put a bullet in my head in this camp," he answers flatly.  "Do you have any other questions?"
In retrospect, it shouldn't have surprised him that Cas was shitty at it, not if he learned it while still an angel.  While craps is you against the odds, poker is you against
She sucks in a breath, looking away.  "That last part I didn't see coming."
.  "Like--uh--in a coffin?" What the hell did he just
"It wasn't personal," he answers shortly.  "I was just a soldier in the Host, Dean, not an archangel; to us, there was no concept of personal.  My contact with her through my vessels made her of interest, but that was true for any contact the Host had with the gods."
He doesn't need to examine the structure to work out what this is doing.  "How does he think of this shit?"
Three years ago, Dean watched in disbelief as his very own ghost of Christmas future sent his team to die, sent Castiel to die, before going off to die himself.  They knew what Dean sent them to do; even then, he guessed that much.  He understands being willing to die for a person, a cause, an idea down to his bones; he also understands the difference between choosing to step in front of a bullet for someone and someone stepping behind you because they know you'll take it for them.  It's not that he thinks that the Dean Winchester who watched Castiel walk away to die for no better reason than a distraction didn't know the difference; it's that he didn't care.
"Yeah, that'd do it."
"You liked her not?" Sappho asks.
"Meeting wrapped up about ten minutes ago," Vera answers, seating herself gracefully and crossing her legs before looking between them.  "There wasn't much to report, but Naresh said they were getting more problems, nothing serious, and pretty much what you'd expect in a group this size.  Anyi and Hans have patrol until dawn, and she and I ordered a couple of the teams to help him out, keep the peace, whatever."
"Take my sister to her cubicle," she says, watching as he goes to the couch, bowing to Claudia before lifting her from her servant's arms with infinite gentleness.  "Please tell Messina to see to Claudia's comfort.  Bithy, a moment, please."
"It's worked," he answers deliberately, "because the rulers of Hell are angels who kept their Grace when they followed Lucifer to Hell; unlike demons, for whom it takes time to gather power in Hell and it can be easily lost, theirs is effectively unlimited.  However, angels haven't broken a human soul on the rack since they first acquired enough followers to do it for them."
After an endlessly long pause, Dean's mouth twitches.  "Thanks for the evaluation."
Tony passes him a pencil and points at the one side of the draft paper.  "There's fine."
," Joseph says in alarm.  "You didn't--fuck my life, you
"I can't promise that."
thinks I'm responsible for Croatoan?"
"Had to," she admits sourly.  "I get why you were pissed all night, okay, but that was my fault, not theirs.  You could have been less of a dick, though; that thousand yard stare of yours is deadly, and you deployed that thing like a weapon of mass destruction."
"What were the right questions?" he asks.  "Like how Erica knew your name was Stephanie. Sends her love, by the way."  It wasn't rocket science to work out who Erica was referring to--Joe and Amanda both picked it up--but neither recognized the name, either.  Which means Erica may be the only person Alicia told; that's not just work-buddy friends shit, not at Chitaqua.
"I think it's truly an amazing coincidence that we hear this one--accusing us of killing people with supposedly questionable Croatoan infection status--at the same time as the one accusing Alicia of murdering small children who were already Croatoans.  If they aren't related directly, they will be soon."
"Okay, think I got everything," Dean is saying.  "So we should--" he pauses, looking at them for a minute. "Uh, so you need more time?"
"I ripped out their tongues first," he answers distractedly.  "Wouldn't have believed 'em anyway.  You...."
"The new recruits..." Micah licks his lips.  "They knew somehow.  You ever have someone look at you like--"  He cuts himself off with a faint grimace.  "Even Erica-- she knew she might have to kill all of them to keep them from talking, but she and Terry...they said they had work to do, but I think they couldn't stand how the recruits looked at them. You wouldn't think so, would you?  But it bothered her.  Castiel though....he didn't look at them at all.  It was like--like they weren't even there."
"If reality wasn't trying to end now," Dean says finally, breaking the comfortable silence, "that'd almost be enough."  Flickering a glance at the walls, his face darkens.  "Almost.  So tell me more about what they were doing before they got fucked by a goddess."
"--seen it and survived to tell the tale, okay, this is weird.  Sam talked him down, got it out of him.  How about here?"
Joseph jerks around in surprise, hissing as hot coffee sloshes across one hand from one of the cups.  Sitting them both hastily on the counter by the sink, he spends an inordinate amount of time rinsing the coffee away and inexplicably lingers there after turning off the tap.  When he turns around, Castiel observes a dull red blossoming across his cheeks before he grimaces.
It's an order, quietly spoken but unmistakable, and beside him, Dean feels his usual companion's presence.  "Where's she going?  What temple?"
"Qafsiel Kaziel, Cassiel, Castiel, Messenger," a light, clear voice says in amusement, and he jerks his gaze to a dark-haired woman in a hunter's loose jacket and jeans, dusty boots crossed at the ankle as she leans back against a table and smiles at him with the same brilliant eyes of a man over two millennia dead.  "Son of God, angel of the Lord, Castiel of the Host, courier of the Pantheons, victor of the Siege of Hell--"
," Sappho says seriously, deliberately adopting the Greek accent she'd had when she entered Cornelia's household, which makes Cornelia's mouth twitch despite the stern expression.  "And you will not tell me."
"Cas, they aren't that stupid," Dean says grimly, starting toward him.  "You okay?"
"As Teresa explained, age is an advantage when making the offering," Cas continues.  "That power keeps their bodies surprisingly healthy and active no matter how they may superficially appear to the untrained or particularly stupid eye.  Witches generally die in battle or when their bodies simply can no longer handle the amount of power being channeled through them.  Time is variable, but as of Constanza's generation, they generally reach a century and a decade or two. With the advances in modern medicine and an excellent diet, Teresa could easily reach a hundred and thirty or even a century and a half with little if any physical impairment, though I wouldn't recommend running a marathon. Then again, I wouldn't recommend those now; how can anyone run for miles and not expire of boredom?" he wonders out of nowhere, and from the corner of his eye, he sees Teresa's mouth twitch, color coming back to her cheeks.  "No terrain is that interesting to observe."
"Graphene: let's start there."  He builds the first possibility for the first test, then the next and the next, chaining and dissolving the bonds over and over, thousands of combinations tested in the blink of an eye until a stable form finally manifests, perfectly compliant with physics and human progress both.  The properties are correct, verified in solid, liquid, plasmic, and gaseous forms, melting and boiling point: excellent.
"I fixed them," Cas adds casually.  "After he apologized, of course."
"You think we're on our second Apocalypse?"  Okay, this is new information. "So how'd the first one end?"
"Dean--"
," Lia explains, waving a hand left to right in eerie imitation of Amieyl.  "He failed the first time he tried to kill us all, because we could hide anywhere in Time.  He couldn't risk what we might do in the past or the future, so he changed the rules.  He hunted each of us out of Time until he caught us in a single place and time of his choice, and then and there he killed them, one by one, until all that remained alive were dead."
"Warned him to let her do it?" Anyi asks softly, and Manuel stiffens.  "Don't tell me you're not thinking it.  If we'd let her do what she wanted to when Del died the first time--"
"You're not."  Dean raises an eyebrow.  "I wouldn't have told you otherwise."
"Have you told anyone else?"
He licks his lips.  "Yes."
"That's a lot of empty space, though," he adds.  "We're starting from scratch, and sometimes, it's easier just to miss what you lost than get to work filling it up.  Sure, I could have let Cas keep you, but that?  That's all you'd ever be: a pet, less than nothing at all.  So yeah, that's how it works; no other way to make us start filling that fucking space, and even then, half never even fucking try."  He laughs suddenly.  "This is Hell and it's not like its easy, but you--given a choice, you picked the hardest way every time and that's before you even rose."
"I don't mind," he says quickly. He suspected as much his disinclination to use his counterpart's weapons.  "Chuck may have some in storage somewhere, but the supply situation has become precarious. Your supply run to the city was needed badly, and I do appreciate the surplus of toilet paper more than I expected now that I contemplate the alternative."
"Okay, so--wait, you want coffee before you start?  Give me the cups."  He frowns as Castiel stares at him.  "What?"
Honest to God, that actually
"Yeah," she says absently, easing her rifle back over her shoulder and pulling her nine millimeter.  "Ask Kamal where they are now?"
Dean looks back at the page, tilting his head in confusion. "But not in Greek."
"Your guess would be as good as counting the bodies," Dean interrupts.  "I'm saying, if it was under a hundred, I'd be really surprised."
"I didn't come back--right."  Dean's jaw tightens, every muscle clenched tight.  "I don't remember what happened with the Host or the two weeks after I--returned here.  Both Dean and Bobby refused to talk about it, and Dean especiallyâ€¦." He stops, remembering how Dean would look at him after.  "That time is a blank, and you may appreciate how unsettling that is."
"Is that what you want to talk about?" Dean asks casually.  Erica's lips curl in a sneer before she makes a visible effort, expression smoothing over.  "If not, get to the point."
toâ€¦." Dean nods.  "The kids, though--babies need milk, kids need food, and they couldn't survive on their own; if we were gonna save them, we had to save ourselves to do it.  So that's what we did."  She shakes her head.  "Word spread.  We never turned anyone away without damn good reason.  Side effect: regular contact with the towns close to us made us familiar--kids help with that kind of thing, I noticed--and half the battle was won right there.  From there, it was easy to build up trust."
"It doesn't bother me," he says slowly, almost relieved to realize it's true.  "Knowing that."
Vera's revelation about what the camp thought they were doing explained something that Dean wondered about, the rare days that Cas suddenly vanishes after Dean goes to bed and he doesn't hear the surreptitious sound of climbing to the roof.  In retrospect, he's glad he assumed all this time that Cas was getting very laid somewhere else, or he might have been dick enough to follow him and on a guess, Cas wouldn't have liked having his private grief interrupted, wherever it is that he buried this Dean's ashes.
"Ask what?" Dean says into the ensuing silence.  "Catch me up here: what does she want?"
"Shit." Dean closes his eyes.  "It's a repeater.  You can keep repeating the same goddamn symbols over and over again to get it bigger as long as each set is complete." He spears Castiel with a look that begs for contradiction.  "Including the closing ones?"
"She wouldn't have done all of that if she still wanted them," he answers.  "I don't know why she disavowed her true name, but it probably proved very useful when Lucifer began his purge.  It's very hard to find a god in time and space without a name and no active worshippers, especially when the only point of reference is a very short period of time--by divine standards, in any case--millennia ago.  As Lucifer probably discovered, hopefully much to his frustration, as he deals very badly with that."
He doesn't ask what the hell she expected reading an entire room of civilians for an entire morning, no matter how new she is at this, but he may have a theory. "So what, you want me to inspire them? Stirring speech, all the extras?"
"As many as you need."  He gestures to the chair across from him. "Sit down."
"Luke and the team leaders, that was fucked up, but it's not like the Host wasn't after you for years," Dean continues, bracing both elbows on the coffee table.  "The fear thing sucked, but you were an angel and 'be not afraid' was your catchphrase for a reason.  Mortality--yeah, that blew, but eventually, you got used to it.  But all of it together--"
"Ha, I learned my lesson," she retorts, tilting her chin up.
Shutting the closet doors, Dean wanders back to the couch, dropping on it with a squeal of ancient springs and cloud of dust as he thinks over what should have occurred to him before.  This is Dean fucking Winchester of the dystopian future, and in Apocalyptic times sentimental attachment to old friends need not apply.  Cas may do junkie as a lifestyle choice, but the Dean Winchester here wouldn't have let him get away with that when it came to what mattered, and all that ever mattered was killing Lucifer.  He was way too pissed at Dean sacrificing his team, sacrificing
Linear time progresses at a (mostly) uniform pace (give or take singularities, spatial anomalies, and dimensional tears in spacetime), a fact he accepted as absolutely true only when an angel and learned as a mortal was one of the biggest lies ever perpetuated on reality.  It can speed to the point of losing entire days or slow to an endless, merciless crawl.
"No," he answers and her face falls.  "What are your orders?"
"The demon is Erica."  Mel's jaw tightens, and Sean curses, but the reaction is mostly stunned silence, and searching the other faces, he sees shock, horror, disbelief, but surprise, none at all.  Most of them witnessed the pursuit outside the wall and known they weren't dealing with an average demon.  "Her ability to control Croatoans in large numbers cannot be underestimated, and she knows us and how we work. If she appears, you are to do the following: break off, return to the west gate, assist in getting Callisto's group inside the alcove with the recruits to protect them, and set up a perimeter to defend them."  Getting the gate to open will be another story entirely, but with less than a hundred Croats and a small area to defend, even Erica's options will be limited.
"You so did."  Fueled by justifiable (and possibly homicidal) rage, Dean jerks them forward, viciously satisfied at the sound of Cas's shoulder slamming into the bedroom door, and jerks away to hobble two steps before making a lunge for the safety of the bed.  Panting triumphantly into the shittiest mattress ever invented, he breathes the heady scent of bleach and doesn't even give a shit that tonight, he's sleeping in his boots because now that he's prone, he's not actually sure he can move again.  It's been a long fucking day.
."  Dean stretches elaborately, shirt riding up to reveal a half-inch of smooth golden skin, stop looking,
Getting up, Cornelia circles the desk and Decumius raises the head enough to be level with her own.  "They say Opimius displayed my son's head before his murderers.  It is fitting he should experience that as well."
"Clear all three nights I was there," Dean tells him airily and is rewarded with Chuck's most horrified stare.  "It was fine. Keep going."
From the abrupt jerk of Dean's hips beneath him, he does.  "Yes or no, Dean?"
"I'm glad, in retrospect, I heeded his advice before I left last night and hid it," Castiel tells the window casually.  "He made me also swear to tell no one about it."
"Infinite knowledge," Castiel intones before he grins maliciously.  "No, of course not.  Lucifer would never so lower himself as to inquire on the details of his own master plan; that's what minions are for.  In this case, it was Pestilence's knowledge, who spent quality time after being thwarted to make a study of it."
Ignoring the roar in the background, he returns to the kneeling man who cowers sobbing at his feet, breathing inarticulate pleas for mercy.  Thumbing the safety, Castiel looks down at him for a moment before setting the barrel against his forehead.
"She'd lie," Micah answers, amused. "As she always does.  Which I think--correct me if I'm wrong--you know as well as I do.  At least now."
"Before we all conveniently forget--I know I want to--but who're we getting to interrogate the asshole?" Vera asks brightly, eyes turning to Dean.  "Gonna do it yourself?"
"It's an excellent start," Cas says, glancing over his shoulder. "I feel ambitious."
the terms."
"How could he have his--never mind, I don't want to know."  And he thought hippofucker was unclear on anatomy and how it worked.  "Everyone knows about this?"
"Relax," Cas tells him irritably, tugging Dean's right foot into his lap and with it two-thirds of Dean's ability to deal with this rationally.  "I'll take care of it."
"Dean told her everything," Cas answers calmly, and Dean hears 'right back to the Hell thing' crystal clear.  "He said--he said we weren't the Host, and for her to make a decision--"
"People are asking if--outside the walls," she says slowly, and right there, he knows what she's going to say.  "They're saying you...that we--we should have checked them ourselves, that there was no proof they were infected.  And that's why Alison got Callisto to clear burning them so fast, so no one would know."  She makes a disgusted sound.  "Like I said, it's stupid."
"That doesn't mean I was good at it on this plane," he answers ruefully, and Dean makes a face, inclining his head in silent agreement.  "In a corporeal form, without Grace, it takes practice to use those skill with a vessel, especially those that don't already possess the skills or training themselves.  My body had to be taught as well, and Jimmy wasn't--inclined toward excessive physical activity."
Dean submits to Castiel's insistence in treating his blisters with suspicious amenability after they've eaten, sitting cross-legged on the couch after a quick shower and extending both hands with barely a protest.
"Got an idea with that," Tony says from the other side of Claudia.  "We've been working on Fourth and Fifth the last couple of months, which is working out really well since it looks like we're gonna need at least one of 'em tonight.  I ordered my group to double check the markers on the safe buildings on my way here.  Everything checks out, we'll go ahead and open Fourth, send half our impromptu bartenders and the vendors over there, and sit back to watch the migration."
She wets her lips.
"Come on," Dean says, apparently tired of waiting.  "Let me check your arm."
"I never get tired of hearing you say that," Alistair says, sitting up.  "Gets better every time, actually."
"If I was wrong--"
"Perfect," he says softly. "Well done."
Dean accepts the terrible lie with a nod.  "Who's with him?"
Luckily, he recognizes Dean's decision-making capabilities aren't up to anything right now, crossing the two feet between them to put the cup in his hands before leaning back against the wall beside the sink, like he wants to consider the entire package from a new angle.  Not sure what else to do, Dean takes a drink, and it does help, or at least, gives him something to do.
To Dean, that might not have mattered; to this Dean, however, that distinction matters very much, and to his own surprise, it does to him as well.
"They're trade partners," he argues, more because Amanda's enjoying the roundabout approach and he's got some time.  "She could be protecting whoever's visiting or representing Ichabod for Alison.  Hiatus or not, you don't break that kind of habit."
"Easy as anything," he murmurs, and suddenly, long fingers are trailing down the side of his face, thumb stroking at the corner of his mouth.  "Terms are you let me do this so I can.  Human bodies have their advantages; from what I've heard, this is your favorite thing about them."
"Within the next three days," Cas answers, hooking a knee over his hip and drawing him down. "Why? She knows to come here.  Oh, I almost forgot: Spado, sit.  Your Master will be with you shortly."
"Everyone get together, pick one area for all of us to live, and he'd work out how to cut power to everywhere but there.  We go though, flip everything off that needed electricity, and a week, two at most, we'd have lights."  She looks up at Dean.  "But to do it, it would take everyone, and we'd have to be outside, right in the middle of the street every day, going between buildings and checking and double checking, because we only had one chance to get it right.
"She looks like a high school teacher," Dean tells Cas, tipping his head back and noting Cas looks hilarious upside down, "but she's a shark, dude."
"That is the word I have heard used in reference," Cas answers discouragingly.  "Preference seemed to depend on the quality of their mattresses."
"I was hoping you could think of an acceptable euphemism," he admits.
Crowley's smile doesn't change, but his gaze sharpens.  "Lovely walls you have here."
, Cas.  Come on, it doesn't have to be this hard."
Sempronia takes a faltering step toward the bed, eyes wide with shock. "What are you--"
"I trained them," he says. "It had to be me.  I thought--I couldn't be sure.  Not then."
"That's--"
that he's right when you not only
"Shut up."  Dropping into the chair across the desk, he rubs his face tiredly.  "They all hate me, don't they?"
Okay when he says it like that....  "Yes."
Rolling his eyes, he takes it and raises his eyebrows; despite the soft, uncallused skin and manicured nails, her grip is firm.  "Dean Winchester, and let me guess--I don't get a name from you?"
"How long?"
"David took the kids to the Volunteer Center for the afternoon," Melanie continues, relaxing. "Lyz has been wanting to get back to play with the kids at the YMCA--er, assist in organizing their daily structure something.  David and Danny pretend they're not into it, but whatever. So how about we--"
Joe sighs noisily.  "Sounds fun."
, what he forgot to--would decide whether he lived or died the first time he fought while mortal.  Because Cas wasn't human, had never been vulnerable the way they were, and that was the one thing Dean couldn't teach him how to understand before he actually
Yeah, that's what he was afraid of, now confirmed by witch.  "I'm gonna need your help.  You think you're up for it?"
"You're not gonna do that, Dean, right?" Manuel asks worriedly, like maybe exposure to an angel has made Dean insane.
A party of four, he notes in the part of his mind not inexplicably frozen, and everyone's still dressed and looking more high than post-orgasmic.  Like that, he's back, blinking around the room and wondering what the hell just happened.
"You dare--" She starts toward him, the church floor cracking under each dainty step as she starts to grow; by the time she reaches him, her head's almost brushing the bare beams of the ceiling.  Her voice echoes through the church.  "Kneel."
"I like it," Dean says firmly.  "Supplies: give 'em those MREs.  How long are you willing to let them be out of the camp?"  He really wishes right now that the cell towers weren't a casualty of isolation; they could really use some phones.  Tentatively, he starts at Chitaqua, mentally dividing up the state into something vaguely possible, then starts to sketch potential routes.  "Five days work for you?"
"Other hunters, yeah."  Dean realizes he's having a once in a lifetime experience here: Cas actually making an effort to ease into a subject.  He gets why he prefers the direct approach; he's shitty at anything else.  "Keep going."
"Standards must be slipping in Hell.  Is recruitment going so badly for my Brother that those who fail him as dramatically as you did are permitted to try again?"  Jeffrey glares at him, finger trembling on the trigger.  "If you shoot this time, Jeffrey, you'd better kill me.  You aren't fast enough to get off a second shot before I snap your spine and rip it from your still-writhing body."
"Dean." Chuck blinks at him and going right for the chair by the window to pull it into position, sweet spot hit on the first try.  Sitting down warily, he tries a smile.  "So, you ready to--"
Dean lets his arms drop, closing his eyes. "She's okay?"
Mouth dry, he looks at the wall above the altar.  "--once closed, it was done.  That only brought it into existence; once it existed, it didn't matter if the lines were erased.  I was too late."
Dean nods, keeping his expression neutral.  "And if they tell us no?"
Dean raises an eyebrow. "Unexpected benefits of your leader being obsessed; you imagine any of 'em willingly dealing with a demon?"
"You can't seriously think this would go better if he was here," Castiel tells him blankly.  Kyle's expression tells him that somewhere in the sane part of his mind, he actually knows that.  "What did you think was going to happen?  Dean's rules for those attending the celebration were extremely specific and almost mind-numbingly thorough.  We need this agreement with the communities, and any deviation that could damage our relationship with them--I don't actually know what he'll do, and it's better for all of us that we don't find out.  Especially you.  Though I have to live with him, so my concern here is also personal."
Dean looks at him thoughtfully as Cas takes his empty plate and sets it on top of his own, which frees Dean to burrow back under his (admittedly smaller) blanket pile.  "Got something in mind?"
"They took yours," Dean answers.  "Only fair."
"Good morning."  Dean's having his first breakfast in Ichabod and this is the first full day of his trial period as--he shies away from the word warily--what Dean said.  "How are you?"
"A little background from Mike and Leah: for obvious reasons, they weren't too eager to break down their social and political structure just to satisfy our curiosity," Joe says, looking startled when Cas sets a full coffee cup on the coffee table in front of him before coiling himself neatly in his corner of the couch with the most innocent expression in the world.  Dean hides his smile behind his own cup: using preternatural speed for evil, check.  "Thanks, Cas."
After, he takes the tray to the Situation Room and for a wonder, Cas actually closes the laptop. "Iâ€™m finished for now," he says, looking at the plates curiously: carne guisada, rice, and a pile of greens, type unknown (as it turns out, there's more than one kind despite the fact they all look alike, which seriously,
"My second mistress saw to that," Sappho answers, smiling faintly, as she always does when speaking of Maria.  "She was a good physician and taught me a great deal.  She also recommended I avoid letting my skin darken in the sun so they're less visible."  Her smile fades. "I was fortunate; Grania scarred the face of the one he took before me.  My master forbade her to do that again; he had to sell the girl at a loss and that displeased him greatly."
.  Now 'speared by the heavens': start there."
Dean's mouth tightens grimly.  "He surveyed the entire goddamn state and he missed them?  How--never mind." Shaking his head, he tips his head toward the other wall and the seventeen blood-marked spots awaiting them.  "Let's get the other side and the gallery upstairs before we check out the main event."
Vera cocks her head and considers him thoughtfully.  "Not bad."
Sappho licks her lips.  "When you finally met?  Was he to your taste despite his advanced age?"
Shaken, he sits back down just as Alison opens her eyes, relaxing all at once; if anything, she just looks surprised.  "Huh."  He glances at Cas, and while he can't be sure, he thinks he's amused.
"Jesus, that must have sucked," he says without thinking, but the surprised expression on Alison's face tells him that for the first time since he met her, he might have actually said the right thing.  Pam and Missouri were born doing what they could do, but Sam's powers came a lot later, and he never made the mistake of assuming just because Sam was willing to use them meant he liked them or what they did to him.  Looking at Alison now, he can see the same resigned strain on her face he sometimes saw on Sam's before he learned to hide it better; like a lot of things in life, sometimes it looks a lot better on paper. "I'm sorry."
Alison gives him a patient look not unmixed with disappointment, followed by resignation that he's what she's got, so she's making the best of him.  He gets from her a lot.
"Good detail work," he answers, crossing his arms.  "The rumor mill's a game of telephone, but this one--at least, the versions I've heard, the ones people actually believe--are too consistent on what actually happened and are reasonable extrapolations--hell, if I were among them, this one I'd listen to.  They're not saying you did it for fun; they're saying you did it on spec.  Not actual dismembered exposure--"
When he gets back to their room, Cas is sitting on the neatly made bed staring down at the open notebook, which from his expression means he a.) actually could read Joe's handwriting and b.) read it all.
Yes, that would be the part Dean focuses on. "Do tell me when you're done," he says caustically, waiting for Dean to recover.  "I'll wait."
"A team is being assigned to Kamal, per the terms of the agreement Dean made with Ichabod on behalf of Chitaqua," Cas tells Alison.  "However, that assignment is pending the disclosure of your abilities to Joseph as Chitaqua's chief negotiator, Amanda as commander of those of Chitaqua's militia stationed in Ichabod, and Kamal as team leader, the latter two agreeing to remain here, and assurances from you that you don't intend to continue to violate the privacy of their minds without an acceptable reason."
"Better?" she asks with a tentative smile that widens into relief when he nods.  "She left me her notes on the right doses to give you, but if you want to check--"
Two more days in this accursed town; technically, that's not forever, but from this side of forty-eight hours, it certainly feels like it.
"His team leader was among those who died in Kansas City," Cas answers too casually. "It's stressful for everyone right now--"
He's still trying to work out how words work when Cas reaches across to flip off the lamp, because some things can't be said anywhere but in the dark.
"It's nothing--"
â€¦." He trails off at Dean's there and gone grin.  "What?"
"At this time, the problem is relatively contained and completely harmless, and it will remain so in the near future."
Joe opens his mouth and then closes it with a sigh. "She's here."
Of course she would do something, and becoming mayor has only increased the scope of her activities, and he doubts her leadership will ever be other than by example, the more dangerous the better.  He makes a mental note to speak to Amanda about arranging with Teresa regular time for Alison on the training field as well and verify exactly what she knows and what she's capable of doing now.  Teresa and Manuel would have seen she knew the basics, but it was probably difficult for both of them to be objective with family, and Alison would take advantage of that uncertainty, since from what Amanda's said, Alison is not overly fond of exercise and the outdoors.
"Fascinating as that question is, it doesn't matter.  When my Brothers discover I'm in Hell, they'll take the necessary steps to claim me, which would be, in case you've forgotten, killing you and possibly purge Crossroads altogether."
"What?" Cas says in surprise, but Dean almost hears something click over that's been in the back of his mind since he first saw it.  Getting to his feet, he crosses the room to the table map leaning against the wall and crouches to follow all those colored roads.
and is only deferring because eventually, they're gonna break down and ask anyway and it's more fun to watch them torture themselves first.
Dean goes still, eyebrows knitting before he nods, almost to himself, then looks at Castiel seriously.  "I'll give you this one.  If I'm ever interested, you're first on my list.  Happy?"
," the older woman says, and Dean sees her faint, nearly indiscernible limp; so, for that matter, does Cornelia, eyes narrowing. "I--"
"I assume that wasn't a compliment, but I'll pretend it was."  Dean nods earnestly.  "I had dinner with you and then gave you drugs and forgave myself for my transgressions, though I'll be honest, Dean--using illicit drugs isn't a sin and it never has been.  For my Father's love is all encompassing and He created marijuana from that love and in that love, we should use it for the purposes for which it was created.  Having sampled it, I assure you, this is fact.  I have no idea how it escaped becoming a sacrament."
"James," he says politely as their small circle opens, and Nate looks at him and his smile falls away.  He regrets it very much; Nate so rarely smiles.
Which is why, he assumes, Cas wants him to tell her she was commanding Ichabod; if she thought she was only Cas's choice, then she'd assume Dean would replace her with his own when he decided who he wanted.  Not bad for a former angel, Dean thinks fondly: manipulative as fuck, but using it for good.
"Yes.  I didn't realize--" Cas abruptly stiffens.  "Do you hear that?"
"Asked what the chances were that she would turn him into a frog when oatmeal was for breakfast," Cas says with an answering grin, sliding into his sweatpants and then taking off the flannel and thermal before frowning into the bag; yeah, they're running out of clothes
"I'm fine."  He'd probably be more convincing if each word wasn't being ground out between clenched teeth, but what he'd need to take to deal with the pain would knock him out so fast he wouldn't know he was asleep until the next time he woke up, disoriented and exhausted and panicking as he struggled to remember not just what happened or where he is, but his own goddamn name.
scenarios coming out of this.
"At the bottom of the hill, about a mile from Ichabod," Cas interrupts smoothly.  "There's a farm road that crosses IH-Ichabod; I think we called it Point Zero, where the buses would let off their passengers for the walk to Ichabod.  A shelter was erected there."
Dean has just gotten off one drink from the new bottle when he notices Cas isn't on the couch and there's a weird pulling thing going on around his feet.  Blinking, he focuses his eyes with an effort and sees Cas crouching on the floor, staring at the laces of his boots intently before there's a knife in his hand.
"Odds don't matter," Mel says easily.  "We don't know how to lose."
"So far, everyone else who was catalyzed is reacting pretty much exactly like I'd expect; shock followed by panic, guilt, depression, suicidal thoughts, and a few actual attempts; it's so predictable I named it Post-Geas Stress Disorder.  Those four...it was almost six hours before they woke up, and shock, panic, yeah, but they just got quiet after that. Wouldn't talk much--hell, it was an effort to even get their attention--and every so often, they'd ask--"
"I wouldn't have to keep reading them," she answers flatly, "if I hadn't gotten five towns to agree to the deal with Chitaqua, offered my town up as the testing ground, and only then met Chitaqua's leader, the most wanted man in the world, and found out he was the one person I couldnâ€™t read and as it turns out, the one I most needed to.  I know what they believe you're doing, but your state patrol schedule isn't the only thing that's new."
Leaning back against the wall, he closes his eyes, aware of the silence emanating from Cas and wondering how long he's got before Cas makes an effort--he's pretty sure Cas didn't get this good at manipulation and not pick up the positive forms--and he's convinced.  It's not like it'd be a hard sell either way, because Cas nailed it about this goddamn cabin.  It's go crazy alone here or go crazy while Cas is a dick to him somewhere else, and at least one of those options involves a bed and company while he does it.
"Hellhounds don't run away, not unless they have somewhere else there're supposed to be," he answers flatly.  "This one did.  It didn't attack you, not until you didn't give it a choice, because killing you wasn't in its orders.  That's what woke you up; that close, it should have killed you, but it didn't.  Why?"
He stares at the still surface of his coffee, aware of Dean's attention despite the fact he's gazing into the distance--the wall, from direction--and wonders what he's waiting for.  After several long moments, Dean turns in place, bracing an arm on the back of the couch.
"You're holding
Dean's expression goes through several bewildering permutations, each equally baffling, before settling--almost gratefully, he thinks--on anger. "Just covering all the bases, okay?"
Castiel ignores him, sitting on the chair that Dean used earlier and concentrating on the inexplicably tangled laces.
"Why only a few rooms and not the whole house?"
"It's the first time you've been back since we got his ashes."  He can feel Dean looking at him and doesn't want to imagine what he must be thinking of him now.  "Yeah, you wouldn't know. This is kind of a learn by getting through this shit kind of thing.  It's different for everyone."
"Names have power," he says causally and notes her surprise in satisfaction. "Answer to the wrong one--" Crap, Cas didn't actually tell him what happened then. "Bad shit happens."
"It might be less morally questionable to simply ask me to make them," he says, and Dean's head snaps up. "When the ingredients are available, of course.  I understand cocoa is a rare and valuable commodity, and not easily obtained.  Ichabod's acquisition of it was apparently both expensive and difficult."
"No one can leave a state once it's been zoned infected," Cas says, confirming Dean's growing suspicions.  "The two checkpoints that allow crossing the border are for commercial use to carry products between uninfected zones when going around them would requireâ€¦." He frowns, irritated.  "I think crossing the Canadian border in some instances, which from what I understand Canada frowns upon and does so very heavily armed."
"Pretty sure?" Ana echoes uncertainly; yes, he'd like to know the answer to that one, too.
Christ. "I'm looking forward to it."
"But--I just couldn't do it."  Vera's gaze grows distant.  "I sat down with the scissors, and then thought of how Merry did it when I watched her in the mirror and started there."  She sighs.  "My sister was a pro; she'd just bought her own place a few months before all this started.  When someone asks, I teach them to do it like she did it, and it feels like something of her is still here.  I remember how she'd part my hair and how she'd work on each lock and remind me about proper hair care while she trimmed the ends, and for a second, I'm still sitting in her salon after hours and just talking about anything and everything."  She cocks her head, studying him for a moment. "I could teach you. Your hair's just long enough to pull it off."
"This afternoon I observed Sarah's team at their first practice session on the range, then I remembered that we were out of clean clothing and started the first of three loads of laundry, which I checked on every thirty minutes and completed before I came home to make dinner, which I then awakened you to eat.  I want it noted that my cooking apparently is much less objectionable and I'd like to be told so.  It's important to validate your subordinates regularly to provide encouragement and express pleasure in their efforts, and as you seem to be unaware of that, we can start with that."
Gaius laughs.  "Really?"
He reviews the last few times they held off the Croats; two more killboxes, then the bait and switch, Alicia shoving Matt to run, holding position until the Croats are too close and her team sets up behind her, then breaking while they hold the Croats off for the few moment she needs to get to them, repeat ad infinitum.
"You said you had no family living."  That
"Certain I don't have random time-traveling amnesia you never mentioned as a side-effect because it's not a side effect and you're making shit up."  Possibly, Dean thinks incredulously, to make him feel better.  "You think it was deliberate?  Like Gabriel did--"
He nods tightly, wondering how much she judges him for what the other Dean's team leaders were doing, if she thinks Cas finally told him or he knew all along.  He's honestly not sure which would be better, or if there even is a better here.
Behind him there's only silence, the room closing tight around him; he can barely breathe, but they're not home in Chitaqua: there's nowhere else to
"--fuck you, lots of jogging for the three, maybe limping," she says, taking a drink from her bottle.  "Loners can pull that shit and regret it later; lucky us, we got an entire camp to enforce the beauty of the healing process.  Deal with it."
"How do you not overthink something?" Cas asks after politely waving at Jeremy on desk duty (with Joelle, what a surprise) and following Dean outside.  "I'll tell her we feel no ill-will toward her and should put the matter out of her mind."
"You'll need someone to help with the patients once the thorazine wears off," he says casually.  "I'm not a linebacker, of course, but I think I can be of assistance and spare one of your orderlies potential injuries.  Perhaps even two."
Of course she did.  Castiel gazes at the featureless landscape, then at her.  "Even if you could claim the Shores, you would have no more authority over the Rivers than the Morningstar does now.  You still could not cross into Elysium or any other land of the dead."
"Check on Christina's team while you're at it," he says--might as well get that part out of the way--before reluctantly getting up.  Extending a hand to Cas, he ignores Joe rolling his eyes in favor of Cas's smile as he tugs him to his feet and walks him to the door.  Leaning against the doorframe, he grins at them both.  "Have fun.  Be back in time for Micah's perp walk; you're not gonna want to miss it."
To his surprise, Dean returns from the jeep unarmed and carrying two of the bottles of water Castiel acquired from the mess tucked under his left arm.  Joining Castiel by the tree, he sits down to survey the impromptu target range with unhidden satisfaction, then eye the pile of targets at Castiel's left with smug pleasure.
"And as long as it's on there, they're stuck in a body that won't die, am I getting this?  No matter what you do to it, it can't die."
"Yes." He wonders if there's something specific Joseph wants to know. "At least, all that was, is, and will be as of the moment I Fell."  Very little that has been of any use, he could add; the gulf between knowledge and experience is vast, and that was the first thing he learned here that infinite knowledge didn't bother to cover.  "Why?"
"If she can't, tell her I don't blame her, and no one else does, either.  She didn't deserve this."  Making an effort, Dolores smiles at him.  "I thought you'd be more pissed, honestly."
"When the actual building phase begins, the entire camp will be pressed into regular duty to complete it," Castiel says.  "As much for the actual building as to gain experience for when we no longer have enough residences, though there are still cabins that, while unlivable now, would be acceptable with sufficient repairs."
"The relationship between a girl and her dealer is sacred," she argues, crossing her arms mulishly.  "But no, I'm not.  That's work-only at need, and I'm not an idiot."  She hesitates, arms dropping.  "I justâ€¦Alison said no one bothered Ichabod, but it's not easy to get here unless you know what you're looking for, or you're mapping roads for Cas and know he'll question you if you miss anything."
"Baby," Dean says, like it should be obvious.  "Think she'd be okay with me saying hi real fast?"
you are."
"Of course,
Bracing a bare foot against the rough surface of the tile, he studies the world beyond the protection of the camp walls.  He can remember exploring it in those early days when Dean's absences were more frequent and of greater length, surprised to realize how much different Creation was when in a form that was part of it, with an immediacy and intimacy that within his vessel he never felt, having no context to understand it.
lieutenants?" Dean echoes incredulously.
"As I said, it can wait until your return."
"In case she wishes to remain for a few hours or--" He thinks of Dean's misery in their cabin after the fever: illness and boredom were issues, yes, but so was loneliness, even if Dean didn't want to admit it.  "She could spend the day at Headquarters and visit with those she doesn't hate.  Which are few, yes, but they exist, or so I assume. If the room could be made comfortable for her, with anything she might need....is there any reason she has to stay
"Erica's the least of your problems," he interrupts.  "The one thing she can't do is kill you herself, not without voiding the contract."
The Situation Room--as its apparently known to everyone (even people he's pretty sure haven't been here)--is now redolent with the scent of fresh lemon from the three fat yellow pillar candles settled on a battered former bedside table with hastily taped leg near the door.
"We'll fix it as soon as the snowing stops," Cas says sincerely, tugging the grey wool blanket into some breathtakingly genius configuration of warmth.  "James should return from his route in the next two days--depending on the weather--and Nate surely knows how to repair buildings if he knows how to build them.  I'd also like to point out that you were the one complaining about the lack of snow."
"The Catones Licinianii may be dogs," Sempronia says abruptly, looking faintly annoyed with herself, "but that is an asset in this case; like a dog, when they sink their teeth into something, they will not let it go.  My mother knows that as well as I do; it's time she set aside her dislike and finished this."
Cas doesn't respond for several moments before he finally seems to come to some kind of decision, stiff shoulders relaxing.  "I had assumed you understood the reason why.  I forgot that your experiences here are from years in your past.  You were only here for a very brief time and wouldn't have thought to extrapolate Dean's reaction to the camp at large."
"What else would I be?" he asks curiously, rolling the dice and watching as they settle on a matched set of three.  "As you know, I'm terrible at poker."
Cas sighs, shoulders slumping unhappily.  "I talked to Jeremy this afternoon."
"Gracchi," shudders through the massive crowd as more and more pour into the Forum, filling it to bursting, and Dean's pretty sure the guy's about to pass out, nearly losing his grip on the scroll before looking around anxiously, a nod sending a man running into the
Amanda returns to the table while Alicia pauses to lock the door before turning to face them.  "I finished my report of yesterday's events, but I feel text will not fully convey--well, anything, and fine, I didn't finish writing it up, okay?  I have my notes on my alpha drive, though."
Joseph doesn't move, but the long fingers tighten around his cup.  "Didn't think you paid that much attention to what was happening."
Dean's amused anecdotes regarding Grant and Connie now have a different context.  "Oh."
, he can fix it.  When he works out what the fuck the problem is, of course.
"You still have a knife at your back.  Saw it when you were picking up the towels," Dean points out.  "You got your answer.  Now tell me what you're doing."
He feels like an asshole; he had no idea Joe was going through--well, anything.  His
"We'll work on that," he says.  "Get dressed and we can talk on the way to our new headquarters.  Your team has a room on the second floor."
"Yenta," Joe confirms smugly. Then, "Josephine, what's wrong with that?"
that couldn't get to the north lot?"
"No, his Dad resurrected him." Joe's eyebrows leap upward.  "It's--" Maybe this isn't the right time for this conversation.  Which, he realizes, means there's gonna be a right time, because they're going to have it.  Maybe all of it.  "Complicated. We'll talk about it sometimes, share freakish life stories."
--so you never run out of ammunition.  People forget shit--most of the time they
He nods encouragingly as her frown deepens.
"Alicia," he says urgently, jumping back when Alicia almost runs into him.  "I need to talk to--"
"Gun person?  Turn around," he adds. "I want to look at your back.  You did have Vera check it recently?"
--can get through our wards.  Not demons, not Lucifer, not the end of reality itself, whatever. It'll be fine."
She nods grimly.  "There's some definite similarities, yeah."
Huge thanks to
"No, you already pulled it out twice.  You should be asleep within the next few minutes."  Dean nods as best he can with Castiel's hand on his jaw, blue eyes meeting his. "You said I should find other options.  I'm taking your advice."
"Oh God," Alicia breathes, and despite the strain, he sees a faint smile curing her mouth.  "You sent a team of

Dean blinks at him.  "How
Dean remembers the Merlin and Snuggie conversations and considers whether he actually wants to know (answer: hell yes).  "How am I looking at it?"
"Before I Fell, my experience with human gatherings tended to be in bars and truck stops, which by nature were very specific in activity and reason for attendance."
"But it was necessary," he says, and Teresa looks startled. "Dean, you're aware of course why hunters rarely hunt on the border, but it has two sides.  Between the imperialism that led to the Spanish conquest of the Americas and motivated the acquisition of the southern and western states from Mexico by the United States, and racism against both those of indigenous ancestry and those who lived or still live in Mexico, as well as general xenophobia, even on the rare occasions that American hunters hunted the border, they were often as destructive to those living there as the things they hunted."
The entire length of what had been Third Street has been appropriated for the celebration, the western end designated as the official entrance area, where new arrivals drop off their passengers before making their way around Ichabod to the adhoc parking just southeast of the northern fields.
"I'm guessing talking about the church set this one off."  The hazel eyes grow distant.  "Lucifer wiping out humanity: doesn't seem like a bad idea, nights like this." She lifts her cup, smiling sardonically.  "So I come downstairs and have tea and think about tomorrow's schedule.  I'll tell you this; for not being a people person, mayor really works for me.  I don't have a lot of free time to contemplate the pros and cons of the genocide of humanity by an archangel with daddy issues."
"How does it--"
"How did you--" Dean's mouth twitches reluctantly.  "Never mind.  I'll wait."
This time, it's different; there's nothing to unmake, just erase, but the memory sequence has to be left intact in its entirety.  Isolating the design alone from the sequence and then each redundant copy, Cas blurs the details of the design itself past recall, making it impossible for them to remember it--or anyone else to see it--as more than a vaguely circular
Even if Cas comes back to Chitaqua, he won't be coming back for him.  He's not the right one.
Putting the jeep into park once they're inside the garage, he glances over at his passengers to take in their (shitty) attempts to not look like they wonder where he got his driver's license and why on earth he got it.  Because it's the Apocalypse, it stopped raining yesterday, he's in a military-grade SUV with a million roads, and traffic is kind of absolutely non-existent: hell fucking yes he's gonna fulfill a dream and test the performance envelope of an SUV on every surface he can drive on.  There was almost no skidding, after all.
He knows it's irrational to feel betrayed, but Cas
Dropping down on the blanket against one of the apple trees, Dean retrieves a bottle of water as Cas finishes with his notes regarding Dean's latest triumph over adversity or whatever.  Like Alicia, Cas isn't allowed to write in Vera's actual records--there's added paper with
