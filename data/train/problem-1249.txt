Then the fourth stair from the bottom creaked under his foot.
Sherlock smirked, just barely. “Wow. Sounds
Sherlock returned to the flat late that afternoon, arms full of case files he’d managed to get from Lestrade (who was too busy filing paperwork for the serial suicides to want to deal with him).
Detective Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard was, after all, the sole keeper of the Detective's secret.
And thus the plot thickens...
John’s breath left him all in a rush. He stuck out a hand to hold himself up, touching the wall, weak at the knees. “Holy hell. Holy
Sherlock could remember the decision he had made (at eight years, three months, four days, nineteen hours, and fifty-one minutes of age, precisely) to stop caring about others. Being able to bring back the dead, if only for a moment, robbed the normal human heart of objective perspective. Of the ability to be impartial or fair or logical when emotionally invested.
Sherlock raised a skeptical eyebrow. “You’re being unusually blasé about things. Are you ill?”
Sherlock lowered John’s gun.
“Treating a patient you can’t touch is stupid,” retorted Sherlock.
Sherlock typed each punctuating dot with a certain amount of unnecessary aggression, and hit ‘Send’, before he shoved his mobile back in his pocket.
No one would believe him.
“In the Middle East.”
~o~O~o~
Something was coming. John just didn’t know what. Or when.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. “No?”
“Well, in case I died,” elaborated Sherlock, feeling uncomfortable and unsettled by the look on John’s face. “To convey what I had learned to you and Lestrade.”
Mycroft looked indignant. “What’s wrong with that?”
But the woman was already tapping out a message on her phone, and as she typed, an expensive-looking black car with tinted windows rumbled smoothly down the street and rolled to a halt right in front of 221B.
To answer questions raised by the last chapter -- Mycroft, indeed, knows absolutely nothing about Sherlock's Gift. I wonder if that'll ever be a problem for them? .... Nah. >_>;
“Reality usually does,” said Sherlock.
Lestrade focused on Sherlock, then the room at large, and then his eyes found the doctor perched on the far stairs, his face just barely visible over Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock leaned against the doorframe. “Seemed foolish to leave you without one. Otherwise, our only means of long-distance communication is with Mrs. Hudson’s landline, and it’s unwise to risk missing an important call because Mrs. Hudson and Mrs. Turner next door can talk about literally nothing for terrifying lengths of time.”
what mess have you gotten yourself into
case, Lestrade, something actually
Also, random question: are my chapters too long? I think I have a fierce internal debate about chapter length every time I update. I like 'em long, but you guys are the ones who have to suffer if long chapters is a bad thing.
“I’m just making sure.”
“We have a plan of action,” objected Sherlock. “You and I need to look for Moriarty’s next message.”
Sherlock touched Shan’s hand again, even though he knew it was pointless. He couldn’t bring people back a second time. That was the Rule: one touch, life; second touch, dead, forever. Sure enough, there was no second flash of light, and Shan didn’t move. She was dead—well and truly dead this time—and she hadn’t told them anything.
“I’ll figure something out,” said Sherlock. “Move John, or… I’ll figure it out. Until then, consider my services suspended. I’ll contact you when I’ve taken care of it.”
Before Sherlock or John could move, there was a soft
Moriarty laughed. “Oh, I definitely can. But I want to hear it from you.”
This would take careful handling. And absolute focus. The latter was harder to achieve, what with the source of all of this chaos currently bumbling about his flat, but Sherlock would make do.
Sherlock crouched down, inspecting the box. It was heavy, the exterior black plastic encasing what appeared to some kind of high-quality stainless steel and insulation, not unlike the protective materials safeguarding airplane flight encoders.
John rubbed the back of his neck wearily. “Sorry, on his behalf. Thank you all for helping with this.”
“I think so,” said Soo Lin. She smiled and looked out the window. “I have time to think, and plan, and anticipate a life I thought I would never actually get to experience.” She turned her gaze back to them, and inclined her head in a gesture of gratitude. “Thank you, for everything you did for me. And for the Black Lotus. I may not be a part of them now, but for much of my life, they were the closest thing to family that my brother and I had. Whatever happens now, you gave them a chance to start over—and whether they choose to do so or not, it is a choice they would never have had without your help. I am grateful on their behalf for the second chance, just as I am grateful that you have made sure that I have mine.”
“Touché.”
the man in the photograph, meaning this is a case of pseudocide. That is, your death was faked. In which case we have an entirely different problem on our hands. Namely, there’s the issue of motive.”
There was a beat, and then John said, blankly, “How. Like—how. How the
Sherlock paused. He knew what was going on. This wasn’t simply about checking in and being concerned. This was about gathering information, especially information Sherlock wouldn’t share. And on that score, the last thing he needed was to linger and draw attention to the fact that John Watson, assumed deceased Captain of the Fifth Northumberland, was standing feet away at the scene of a police shootout, kidnapping, and attempted murder.
The woman’s face was impassive, but Sherlock could see the faintest flicker of fear in her eyes. He had her. He had her and she knew it, even if she would never admit it.
Lestrade inhaled angrily. “I’m willing to guess you know.”
Sherlock mutely dropped into a chair near John—leaving one empty between them—and folded in on himself, pressing his fingertips hard against his eyes and sighing heavily.
At last Sherlock stopped his pacing and turned to face John again. “I wouldn’t think less of you,” he said.
Sherlock had long since grown to loath those moments. The clamoring of thoughts and ideas and uncertainties and inconsequential nothings would crowd his mind in a deafening roar. Or, perhaps even worse, he would have nothing to think about at all.
… Well. This was boring.
~o~O~o~
He checked the reports again, and still found nothing. Either they were in the clear, or it was still being investigated. Either way, all was quiet for now, and it wouldn’t be until morning that word of a body stolen from the morgue of St. Bartholomew’s would circulate.
Sherlock pursed his lips uncertainly. Maybe he could pat him on the arm, far away from any exposed skin? He lifted a hand uncertainly, hesitating before he’d moved much at all. But before he could make up his mind, Mycroft reentered the room, a folder full of papers under one arm, and Sherlock quickly dropped his hand.
“I’m hoping you can tell me,” said John. “It wasn’t us, obviously, and we didn’t have any warning.”
matters. He was in a cell then, but it’s been less than thirty-six hours since you said that, and now he’s gone.”
I bet he laughs himself sick
Sherlock languished.
"But when are you going to admit you can't figure it out and let me in on the suicides—"
“John, Lestrade of Scotland Yard,” he said, even as the police officer was beginning to turn red with barely suppressed fury. “Lestrade… John Watson.”
“I don’t think I’m exaggerating in the slightest,” said John. And he didn’t. Cynical as it was, he wouldn’t be surprised if he found Sherlock gone again by morning—a realization that left him feeling even more frustrated and inflexible. If he was going to be perpetually left behind and stuck in the flat until disaster struck, he wasn’t going to sit around and let Sherlock get away with sitting around when it mattered most to be doing something.
“I think everyone does.”
The footsteps had reached the top of the stairs and were on the landing outside the door. But where Sherlock had anticipated a knock, there was instead the faint jingling sound of a set of keys (presumably borrowed from Mrs. Hudson upon entrance, so determined was their visitor) being raised and maneuvered into a lock. With a feeling of dread settling into the pit of his stomach like a pool of cold water, Sherlock knew it was already over.
I’m back! A couple weeks late, but I am back. I apologize for the delay; I was juggling first being out of the country without a laptop, and some later personal stuff.
As they reached the doors, John asked, “Are we meeting Mycroft now? We’re not the only ones who’ve more or less been up all night.”
"Look, Sherlock, I appreciate the thoroughness, but I'm sure," said John Watson. "Since I have to, this is good. I would like to thank you, after all, whether there's a point or not."
“Completely by accident,” replied Lestrade bitterly, snatching the bottle out of Sherlock’s hands.
“No. In fact, I think it’ll be worse when we’re focused and awake enough to appreciate all the dangers and nuances. But let’s be positive.”
“… Why? Exactly?”
John let out a slow breath and sank in his seat.
“We’re sorry for your loss,” said John quietly, speaking for the first time since they had all sat down. “For what happened to your brother.”
Because during those thirteen remaining minutes, Young Sherlock began touching dead blades of grass and watching them burst into life while their neighbors browned. He reanimated his mother's abused petunias and watched her beloved tea garden roses shrivel. And while all of this should, by rights, be completely impossible, it did comply with Newton's Third Law. Newton’s Third Law stated quite clearly that every action had an equal and opposite reaction, and while that was written about motion, Young Sherlock reasoned that it could apply to just about anything. Why not life itself? And when you've eliminated the impossible (because it seemed impossible that the house sparrow had not fatally collided with his window, or that the dove had simply dropped out of the sky for no good reason, or that he was just witnessing some sort of bizarre universal phenomena and the glow he was witnessing had nothing to do with him), whatever remains, however improbable, must be true...
Wasn’t.
"Thanks, Molly, I really appreciate it," said Lestrade. He gave Sherlock a pointed look.
“Do you think it’s…?” started John, without finishing the sentence. He didn’t think he needed to. They both knew the answer. Of course it wasn’t safe. One false move and the bomb would go off. One thoughtless move by either of them and John would drop dead.
“Just you,” said Sherlock, breaking his own rule about avoiding repetitious conversation at all costs in his determination to establish this was
Sherlock made it to the outer doors and pushed them open with just a little more force than was strictly necessary, stepping out into the parking lot. He’d get a cab and return home. Lestrade could meet him there instead, since there was no
She hurried inside, and Sherlock shut the door after her.
She trailed off, and John risked a glance in her direction. Sherlock had dropped his gaze to his hand, where John could see his phone with the screen illuminated.
“But why kill people at all?” Sherlock examined the pill bottles for a moment longer, lingering on them, before he set them down. “I’ll guess the children in the photograph are his. And his motivation for making a little money on the side in the business of homicide. He did seem to suggest there is an unexpected profit to be made in serial killing.” He grinned. “A sponsor.”
“Of course you don’t,” said John. “It’s barely been an hour. Of course you don’t have a plan. None of us have a plan. Not yet, anyway. I don’t expect you to have one right away. I’d be a little disturbed if you did. And even
“But—“ said John, frowning, picking up the second shoe. “There’s still
…” Soo Lin’s hand, still on his arm, tugged at his sleeve feebly. “Promise.”
“It wasn’t real,” said Mycroft again. “That. All of that from the other day.”
. John might not be suited for the task, strictly speaking, but even if Moran does nothing but taunt him, we might get some insight from it. More than we’re getting now from silence and personal records about him that end fifteen months ago.”
“As in, we shouldn’t do it?”
“We wait.”
“Well, that was – well, literally a lifetime ago,” added John. “And I didn’t really spend time, you know, down here in the morgue.”
After a few moments, he held up the screen for John to read, careful to keep out of reach lest John forget the Rule forbidding physical contact.
Sherlock unlocked the door and stepped into the dark hallway inside, where he leaned against the wall, breathing heavily. He would tackle the stairs in a moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
Kudos and comments especially are hugely appreciated! :D Thanks, all~!
oh John
BUT, the semester is nearly done, and I'm hoping summertime will be a lot more productive. Things tend to be a little frantic with classes, especially when it's term-paper and final-exam season, as I'm sure a lot of you know.
“Or what?” he demanded, temper flaring in an instant. Instead of leaving, he closed the door, and stepped forward towards Mycroft.
Getting into St. Bart’s had been easy.
“I’ll know more before long,” said Sherlock firmly. “It’s much easier to look for something that has a name. I’m willing to bet that Hope’s lead is a solid one. He had no reason to lie. This Moriarty might have been sponsoring him, but I doubt Hope would have felt any particularly strong sense of loyalty. It was a matter of personal motivation. Likely no direct contact. Strictly business.”
“Because I told him not to ring until today at the earliest,” said John, without looking up from his writing.
“Thanks for explaining it,” said John, sincerely. “It makes sense why you keep us out, knowing your reasons.”
“The group responsible for my abduction is the Black Lotus,” said Sherlock. “Identifiable by a tattoo of a lotus in black ink somewhere on their body. Wrists, ankles, feet…”
John looked between them, afraid to breathe.
Sherlock blinked. “You’ll forgive me if I fail to see how.”
He did not especially need to.
Mycroft paused. “Potentially.”
John made a face. “And I’m guessing I have to keep hiding until we know the coast is clear and everything’s died down?”
The next day came and went with no developments. Sherlock and John found themselves passing the time by speculating about the next message (a pastime which really only made John anxious and Sherlock impatient, but they did it anyway). Sherlock updated Lestrade with pertinent shoe-related details and agreed to give him a full report on his work, and he even sent Mycroft a few texts about the events of the last two days. He and John talked all evening—and then late into the night—about everything they knew about Carl Powers and rare poisons and speculative guesses about Moriarty, until finally a half-asleep John had to admit defeat and make his way up to bed. It only took John a couple of minutes to fall asleep, but Sherlock sat awake, rereading old articles about Carl Powers and thinking about the next message.
It was John who finally broke the silence. “… Sherlock.”
John nodded. “Definitely.”
It was Kitty Winters.
John swallowed hard.
,” snapped Sherlock, pointing down in the direction of the front door.
“Let’s discuss this outsi—“ Sherlock began.
“I was incapacitated with not being able to think,” said Sherlock.
After all, he had
This was impossible, but Young Sherlock's mind had never before been limited by the bounds of what was and what wasn't possible, and it wasn't about to be now. There was no box, there were no instructions, there was no manufacturer's warranty explaining how any of this worked. There was no obvious cause.
Sherlock could see his own fear abruptly reflected in John’s face, like he was looking into a mirror.
John lay on the bed, looking up at the ceiling, as seconds, and minutes, and hours trickled by. He thought about Mycroft. He thought about Sherlock. But most of all, he thought about his sister, Harry. He thought about where she was, and how she might be doing, and if she was all right. He wondered if she’d ever seen photos like the one he had seen on Mycroft’s desk. If she even knew John had died. If she would want to see him now, if it was possible.
The memories of the previous day suddenly came flooding back.
"I know, you just said," answered John.
“Uh. Good to know,” said John’s voice, with a bemused edge to it.
The fight seemed to go out of Lestrade’s stance. He let out a long, heavy sigh. “I—Jesus, all right. Can we at least discuss this? I mean, I think you and I – and John too, I guess – we need to figure out a course of action.”
After a long and somewhat repetitive conversation with Lestrade, Sherlock managed to convince him of the authenticity of Hope’s confession.
"Mm," said Sherlock, disinterested. While he was fond of experimenting and understanding the fine mechanics of anatomy, as it was undeniably invaluable to his work as a consulting detective, he didn't much care for examining the living. An odd but true contradiction. And Watson was certainly alive at this moment; therefore, not an experiment. "Bit ironic. You likely needn't have died at all, had you been even thirty seconds later to arrive. Or if the man hadn't tried to talk to you."
John rubbed his eyes. “I guess we learned something of significance about Moriarty from this. He made it a point to show you how long he’s been doing this with no one noticing. He’s got an empire that’s decades in the making. I get that. It’s an intimidating point.”
John sat down in a chair opposite Sherlock and drained half of his tea in one gulp. “That was amazing.”
Maybe he had.
No one made a sound.
The door connecting the troves of information in Sherlock’s mind unlocked, and opened, and the lights flickered triumphantly on.
“I know,” said John. “But that’s the kind of argument you’d typically use.”
“Fuck off,” said John, ducking his head to hide a smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
John shot Moriarty a dark look, and it was only in that second that Sherlock noticed that, beneath the fear and confusion, John was
“I’m good,” she said, very red in the face. “I was just heading out. Can – can I – did you need something?”
“It really means that much to you? To stay – here... with me, for this case,” said Sherlock uncertainly.
John smiled a little. “You know,” he said, “for someone who hates having feelings as much as you do, you have a weird habit of saying really nice things when it’s least expected.”
And he became obsessed with solving murders.
I hope all of you have been well in the hiatus <3
The Detective was not one to exaggerate when it came to time and dead people.
Sherlock—who had opened his mouth to retort—closed it for a moment, looking uncertain. He turned back to John slowly. “… Elaborate.”
This also seemed like the perfect opportunity to bring Molly back into the story, if only for a moment. To my mind, there’s no way Molly could have not noticed Sherlock talking to the dead in her morgue. Sooner or later, she’d have unwittingly poked her head into the room in time to see some Very Weird Magic taking place. But Molly is also amazing and I feel like she’d somehow be okay with it.
John climbed the stairs to his bedroom and opened the top drawer of his bedside cabinet. His gun was normally there, along with his papers and his few belongings.
John glanced out the window to see that the backyard, hidden from the front of the house, was unkempt and overgrown. A couple doghouses stuck up out of the long grass.
Lestrade hurried out to talk to his people, leaving Sherlock and John behind with Shan’s body. Sherlock’s anxiety at Shan touching him of her own volition had faded somewhat, but he was still preoccupied with this new set of circumstances. The Black Lotus would be at risk now, if Moriarty chose not to take them under his wing… And, if he did, they’d be utterly dependent on him. He would be less their benefactor and more their leader.
For either of them.
When John arrived at Amberley’s home in Lewisham, Amberley greeted him at the door. The front of the house, surrounded by a freshly painted fence, was in good care. The door to the house was ajar, and Amberley emerged as John approached the front porch, carrying a bucket of paint in each hand. Amberley set the buckets down. Amberley himself was still in his coat from before, but had new dashes of paint on his hands. He nodded to them as they approached. “Mr. Watson,” he said.

life now. I’m going to fight for it. I won’t give this up. I won’t lose this.”
But I emerge triumphant and with a snazzy cast on my foot!
Moriarty gave a little pout, huffing out a bored sigh, and he turned his attention back to Sherlock. “Seems like a lot of trouble. Keeping a live-in client.”
be okay.”
He read the note again.
“By all means,” Amberley shrugged. “I’ll be here painting if you need me.”
Mycroft nodded stiffly. “Perhaps you should. But not now. We need to clear the building, and I would prefer it if it was done thoroughly. Moriarty is a proficient bomber, as you and I both know now.”
John grit his teeth, throwing his hands up in the air. “How about you just tell me what it is I’ve been doing, then? If nothing I have to say is good enough for you or if you’re going to argue with every sodding thing I say, there’s no point in pursuing this line of conversation. Why even bother asking me if you’re going to shoot down every other word coming out of my mouth?”
“Wonderful,” said Sherlock, just as there was the sound of a door flying open behind them.
“Sherlock?” John called, diverting to the kitchen just long enough to grab a pair of rubber gloves left on the counter. He stashed his gun in the back of his trousers and pulled the gloves on over the cuffs of his shirt, to shield any exposed skin. He coughed, the thick air weighing on his lungs, and called again, even louder, as he turned back to the living room. “
He turned in time to see a piece of paper fluttering to the ground from the cab window. He glanced at the cab, focusing on the driver for the first time.
“Not particularly,” said Sherlock.
“I can’t drive,” said John, holding up the new drivers license.
it's a shame that's not going to happen but uhhhhh it's a nice thought
Guess it's not all happy this chapter. D:
?” he demanded. He shifted one side of the coat to look at the bomb strapped to John’s chest, before he suddenly jerked his hand back, as if the fabric had burned him.
“Josiah Amberley,” continued Lestrade, turning to the man on the ground and hauling him to his feet. Lestrade started to lock the handcuffs on the man’s wrists. “You are hereby—“
Thank you all so much for reading! Any feedback, as always, means the world to me <3 See you (very soon) with the next chapter…
So much for that blood coagulation experiment waiting at home.
“You were better than most. She was even more so. Shan did seem to be genuinely aware that she was actually dead,” said Sherlock. “More than most. Which suggests she knew she was going to die.”
Anyway, this chapter was EMOTIONAL SHERLOCK EVERYWHERE
John found himself rather sympathizing with the pansies, as he would be willing to bet that, if the plant had the means, he and it both would like nothing better than to smash the window and flee down the street.
“A concerned party,” said Mycroft, eyes narrowed.
John raised an eyebrow. “What is it?”
Somehow, a monosyllabic profanity seemed like the only reasonable thing to say in response to a story like that.
Moriarty already had it. Moriarty and his puzzles and his empire had been more or less the sole focus of Sherlock’s concentration for days—for
Moriarty’s eyes flickered from the gun to Sherlock’s face, still smiling without faltering. “I can make you tell me,” he said, and his tone was suddenly much sharper.
“Sherlock…” said John slowly, a quiet warning.
real nice
“Our goal is to appear as though we belong here,” said Sherlock quietly. “Perhaps I was working late and you came to take a bag for me. Perhaps we both work late and you’re going home for the night. It doesn’t matter what the reason is. We remain calm and act as though we belong here unless circumstances dictate we must do otherwise. We’re unlikely to encounter other people, but that doesn’t mean we won’t look suspicious on a security camera if we act stupidly. Understood?”
and Incredibly Snarky John
“Right, because it’d be the end of your career,” said Sherlock snidely.
“Maybe it was foolish of me—well, clearly, it
He didn’t know why, but he knew in less than a second that he needed to not be there with no means of self-defense, and he didn’t question it.
“Few,” admitted Sherlock. “Research will be needed.”
Sherlock barely understood what Moriarty was saying. His thoughts had never moved so slowly. He might as well have been watching the scene from elsewhere, hearing this conversation from a great distance. He had forgotten how to move. He’d forgotten how to think. He’d forgotten how to breathe. If he could remember how to form sounds, he might have screamed.
Sherlock glowered at him. To buy himself a moment of time, he put out his cigarette, and then he sighed. “I haven’t thought about it much. I suppose there was a finite length to his stay when I originally brought him back. There was good reason for him to stay, if only for a time. Right now, that still stands. But what happens if we’re all still alive in a week’s time is an entirely different question. One I don’t need answered right now.”
“Window’s look good,” said Lestrade, admiring them from the door. “You almost can’t tell a bomb went off yesterday.”
“Specifically at odd hours of the night and possibly early morning. I like to play when I’m thinking.”
“Have you found an older woman anywhere?” said Sherlock swiftly. “Chinese. Short. Appears to be in charge.”
“What’s got you so scared about letting them help?” asked John, finally sitting down in the chair on the other side of the table.
Mycroft frowned slightly. “I admit, I would have thought you’d ask Sherlock about this, if you haven’t already.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. It was not the first time that week that the policeman had asked that question. “I’ve told you about a hundred times. A missive from Moriarty.”
“I think the Wei dynasty caparisoned horse sculpture on my left is particularly impressive,” said Sherlock, looking at it briefly. In his pocket, his finger hovered over the ‘send’ button. “The harness is in wonderful condition. I was admiring it the moment we walked in.”
The voice spoke again, as someone stepped out through the open door. “Or are you just happy to see me?”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “Are you seriously telling me to postpone figuring out what our criminal mastermind, and now also psychopathic bomber, wants?”
Sherlock frowned a little, but it didn’t totally mask the flicker of excitement in his eyes. “Your timing is appalling. But obviously I want to discuss it.” He glanced at John, and John nodded quickly as well.
"Fine," said Sherlock crisply. He looked at Watson, a foreign unease resting in his stomach like a misplaced bowling ball, but his resolve was even more forceful. His eyes narrowed.
Sherlock smirked, taking a few steps back towards the street as John made his way inside. “That’s your problem.”
“Still think serial killing as a business is insane,” said John.
“Not sure that’s a compliment…” mumbled John, tossing the last of the cotton balls into the bin and grabbing more gauze for the covering. “Wrists feel any better now that they’re cleaned? And is there any point in my asking if you’re up to date with your vaccinations?”
are—“
“Like?”
Young Sherlock’s antisocial tendencies, the byproduct of needing to maintain distance in order to be safe, made him a natural target for his more vindictive classmates. The other boys saw his behavior as the proof of a life of comfort and cosseting, and they sought to rectify the problem, whether Young Sherlock liked it or not.
He looked down at John, and he sighed.
AND HE LOOKS AT ME
“Nooo,” said Moriarty slowly. He paused, and amended, “At least, not yet, I hope. Not today. This isn’t your day.”
One voice.
"Just shut up"
John looked almost apologetic, something Sherlock genuinely couldn’t understand. John was sorry for finding him? Not finding him fast enough to avoid stress?
“Heard back from Gruner,” said Sherlock, gesturing to his computer screen. “He’s taken the bait.”
Lestrade hurried away.
The man he’d first knocked down had already leapt to his feet. He dove at Sherlock, and they tumbled, Sherlock slamming his thumb back into the man’s eye. His attacker howled, but clung on.
I apologize for the delay in getting this chapter up. I have my reasons (mostly boring ones like health and life/work getting in the way), but it was also partly motivated by getting the next few chapters together all at once.
He had stopped missing it all, after a while.
All of this became apparent to Young Sherlock in a span of fourteen minutes.
But he somehow didn’t mind anymore.
Think.
The moment he read that sentence, Young Sherlock wasn’t uninterested in Carl Powers anymore.
Sherlock gave John a sweeping glance.
. If he’s finally going to pay for it, I want to be a part of it.”
“You think they might be able to find something?” asked John, who’d completely forgotten that Sherlock had contacts among London’s underground.
“I shouldn’t worry too much,” said Sherlock shortly. “You did nothing wrong.”
John understood that Sherlock was trying to get him to leave for sentimental reasons. It wasn’t malicious. John just had no intention of cooperating. He lowered the pillow slightly. “But didn’t I
“I—“ Sherlock stammered, looking from Yao to Moriarty. “I don’t—“
the mature one, Sexy,” said Lestrade. “But with these cases, I’m going to take whatever laughs I can get.”
On the arm of Sherlock’s chair, his phone buzzed. Sherlock ignored it.
He still needed to fully wrap his head around that. But John was more than willing to try.
The room was empty, save one person.
’  making him feel more worried rather than reassured—but Sherlock got to his feet and stepped into the kitchen without comment, turning on the kettle for tea and getting mugs out of the cupboard.
“You do now.” Mycroft leaned forward over the desk. “Now is the perfect opportunity to just
But still.
Still, the brother (Mycroft? Apparently no Holmes could have a normal name) lingered in John’s thoughts the entire way to Baker Street.
“Okay, okay, give me a second,” said John. He looked more closely, all the while applying antibacterial medication to the cuts. “’M’. ‘M’ as in ‘Moriarty’?”
Soo Lin nodded.
John interrupted him. “I need you to turn the lights on,” he said, his voice sharp and urgent.
John feigned confusion. “Clearly I exist.”
Sherlock, his face buried in the back of the sofa, resisted the urge to turn around and look to see what John was doing, both because he knew it would involve medical things that Sherlock had no intent of enduring and because he knew it would hurt to roll over.
Finally, John broke the silence.
“How’s Sexy
“Also…” said John.
care so much, if it just means having more to lose?”
“Are you sure?” he said, instantly much more alert.
“Oh.”
OH MY GOD I'M FINALLY BACK
“But what if
BLACK LOTUS
John nodded, and after a few more moments of bustling, Mrs. Hudson patted John fondly on the arm, and departed. The landlady had grown on John in the time he’d been living at 221B, and there was something inexplicably comforting in even just a pat on the shoulder. It felt like years since he’d last had any actual physical contact with anyone, though in truth it was only a couple short weeks.
“Hopefully,” said Lestrade, and Sherlock could hear him flipping through several papers. “The bullets are both consistent with a standard UK military sniper rifle firing .388 Magnums. There isn’t much in the way of distinguishing striations on the bullets themselves—looks like the shooter probably used steel wool or something to modify the gun—but what’s there is a perfect match. I’m willing to bet it’s the same gun.”
“Stop!” John called urgently behind him.
Sherlock vacillated, unsure of how much to say. “I think we’re very near the end of this now,” he said at last. “The end of all of it.”
He pushed the door open and disappeared into the room beyond.
“Soon, with any luck,” said Sherlock.
“Hm?” said John, blinking and looking over at Sherlock, coming back to earth. “Just clocked out for a minute.”
“Until he tells me too much and we catch him,” offered Sherlock. “It’s the only lead we have. You know as well as I do that this is all we have to go on.”
“At least it’s not just me,” said John, heaving a sigh.
Mycroft shook his head. “Shaken, I think, but not hurt. The smoke is not helping.”
Sherlock nodded grudgingly. “True. But maybe he’ll tell us more in future. And even if he doesn’t, I think I prefer knowing Moriarty is without his sniper now. Moran has almost certainly been instrumental in all of the bombings too. Moran’s the one who blew up the convoy evacuating the informant that got you involved in all of this in the first place. So if Moriarty is currently being deprived of the services of the lieutenant serving as his expert in assassinations, explosives, abduction, and intimidation, I’m not complaining.”
It was enough of a reason to stay.
“Why aren’t you more annoyed?” demanded Sherlock. “This should be just as much of an inconvenience for you as it is for me.”
Silence.
“So there was no point in us joining him. We couldn’t help with something like that.”
“You two must be a blast at parties.”
The next room was brighter, as was the one after that, and Sherlock registered in the back of his mind that the main atrium was ahead. But the vast majority of his attention was focused on the people half a room ahead of him running as fast as they could. He could count four of them. Was Soo Lin with them? No. Then where—
Sherlock took a deep breath, and closed the door. “Maybe. But not if I can help it.”
“I somehow got that impression,” said John.
It wasn’t at all difficult for John to recall the giddy look on Moriarty’s face when the sixty-second rule had come into play with Yao. “I think you’re right.”
“Ah,” said Mycroft simply.
It was a little over an hour before Sherlock and Mycroft returned to the surveillance room where they had left John. John was still seated along one wall, but he got to his feet the moment the door opened, and they were barely in the room before he was saying, “Is everything all right? You were gone a long time.”
“Oh.”
When John finally gave up and dozed off, the sun was already beginning to rise, the sky over London tinged a faint red over the grey of the rooftops. The flat was silent, and still. His eyelids drooped over and over again until he surrendered to sleep, wrapped up in a blanket on the sofa—just as he’d been doing all week—so he’d known when Sherlock returned.
The interior of the building was as stately as the exterior, with everything made out of marble or mahogany. John followed Mycroft inside, looking around as he went. He had absolutely no idea where he was, though he could guess this was probably where Mycroft worked. Some sort of private office, then. A few other people were milling around the lobby as well, but none of them said a word, or even noticed John and Mycroft entering. John looked at them, waiting for something to happen, or even just for someone to say hello to Mycroft just to break the oppressive silence, but no one did. Neither, for that matter, did Mycroft.
John gaped at him, paling a little. “I… You want me to—?”
John was bothered by it. John was bothered by the whole thing. Sherlock found it exciting—how many criminals were there like Moriarty, after all?—but John was entirely the opposite.
John snorted, amused in spite of himself. “No, you’re not, it’s…” But he trailed off. He was an idiot. He was a complete idiot. If she knew his name, and knew that he had been dead the last time they were in the same room, then—
Sherlock stopped. “Say that again.”
“Trust me, Sherlock—if my nose was broken, I’d know.”
The details didn’t matter much to John. What he was doing was keeping Sherlock’s secret. After all, John thought, Sherlock was all he had. If it wasn’t for Sherlock, he would still be dead, and no one would have thought twice about it.
"Sherlock Holmes," said Sherlock.
to undermine what you and I have built – what we’ve
“Sherlock!”
John and Mrs. Hudson exchanged looks.
“It means the people we’re dealing with are professionals. Which makes them that much more interesting, but also that much more annoying to find.”
hell.”
Very limited.
John whipped his head around to look at Sherlock and took a few fast steps away from him, clearly unsettled at the unexpected touch. In the weeks John had been living with Sherlock, they had risked any kind of contact only a handful of times, and all had been when one of them was injured or when they were in grave danger. “What’s—“
Was this the something worse?
“Mud is from London and Sussex,” he said.
“Good,” said Sherlock flatly.
Sherlock kept his eyes riveted on the ceiling and didn’t reply.
“Nothing useful. Someone definitely broke into the place across the street the night before, but as we might have guessed, it was dark, any CCTV footage was of limited quality, and the bomber was strategically dressed to minimize distinguishing features. They looked male. Tall. Strongly built. Very stealthy. And if that’s all that Mycroft could figure out from the footage, that’s all anyone is going to figure out.”
“That doesn’t matter. I’ve got your back,” John promised. “Through anything.”
“Right, sorry,” said John, looking around. “Do you know if there’s any way I can get my things?”
On a more fun note, let's just let this be the timeline where Soo Lin gets to live and have a peaceful life somewhere far away from all of Moriarty's nonsense... please... she deserves it...
,” shouted Sherlock, clenching his fists to stop himself from touching the cabbie—whether to make him dead again or to shake the answer out of him, Sherlock wasn’t entirely sure.
“Sounds like a good idea, yeah. So how do we do that?” asked John.
“You can go say hi,” said Moriarty’s voice in John’s ear. “Step out.”
"Oh God yes."
Sherlock came and went with the permanency of a moth searching for the moon.
“My brother,” said Mycroft curtly, “is known in certain circles for his deductive insight. While Sherlock and I are quite different in some respects, you’ll find that I am no less observant.”
Lestrade whistled. “Christ.”
“Is everything all right?”
John – cared.
Perhaps that had something to do with the mild uneasiness he felt at being back here quite this soon. It was inevitable, of course, but that did not mean he would not have preferred to delay this particular interrogation for a while longer.
Young Sherlock looked up at the sound of the bird colliding with his window and, in seconds—because he was exceedingly bright, curious, and talented at observing while everyone else was merely looking—he had determined that it was a common house sparrow, that his window was slightly cracked, and that the poor thing had broken its neck on impact.
Mycroft’s tone, if anything, got colder. “It could be.”
Mrs. Hudson came and went. John pretended all was well, and that there wasn’t a deep and gnawing unease growing in the pit of his stomach.
“I’m not a doctor,” said Sherlock. “Perhaps you can tell me. My understanding is limited on this side of things, but my belief is that at the moment of contact, your body instantly restored or regenerated the parts of your body that are essential for sustaining life. In this case, the veins, arteries, and bone that had been damaged when you were shot. The skin and some of the muscle is only superfluous, so you keep the gaping hole. But the damage has been repaired, for all intents and purposes. And to my knowledge, those changes are permanent, unless we came into contact again. At which point they would become undone, and you would die.”
“Right,” said Sherlock. He rubbed his forehead. “Hard to believe Shan died two weeks ago and there’s been no detectable fallout.”
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders. “If you already know the answer, why ask? How much of being a doctor involves asking stupid questions?”
was that?” demanded Sherlock.
John blinked. Then he smiled, so widely he doubted he would stop for a very long time.
Sherlock offered her a withering glare. “My work rather depends on it. Getting knocked down and knocked out isn’t enough to change that. I don’t think you’d have bothered to drag me here for a chat if you didn’t know I had a problematically good memory. Don’t patronize me. It’s insulting. You know who I am. I know who you are. We can forego the formalities. Why am I here?”
John grabbed Amberley from behind, one hand seizing Amberley’s gun hand and wrenching it towards the ceiling while he pinned Amberley’s remaining arm at the shoulder. Amberley fired into the ceiling as he twisted in John’s hold, but John tightened his grip on the gun and Amberley’s hand. John managed to work his hands to the trigger over Amberley’s and he discharged the gun completely into the ceiling.
“This case just became a thousand times more interesting, and it hasn’t even been twenty-four hours,” said Sherlock. “It’s
Was that a text? A call? Was it a good thing or a bad thing?
going to be so stupid,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock ground his teeth. “
An on-time update! For once, I keep my promises. ^_^;
“John…?” prompted Mycroft, raising one delicate eyebrow.
“Distracting,” he said.
“Is that a British Army Browning L9A1 in your pocket?” called a male voice.
One of the petals from the dead flowers on the windowsill fell to the ground, and even the soft noise of it hitting the floor seemed loud.
Sherlock tore his eyes from where blood was welling from Soo Lin’s wound and looked at her face. “Soo Lin,” he said, in a forcedly steady voice.
Sherlock wasn’t sure. He took a sip of tea. “Nothing changes this way. Mycroft knows now, but he won’t be bothering us, and he obviously won’t say anything about it. No one would believe it. So really, nothing’s changed.”
“I thought it was a possibility. Though certainly not in such an… explosive fashion. I thought Moriarty might make a concerted effort to get Moran back, if Moran is an important part of his plans for me.”
Shan found a quiet building, deserted and on a deserted street, and she made contact.
John pursed his lips. “You want me to make sure Lestrade leaves you alone,” he repeated. “That’s my job.”
“Is there anything in particular causing you the most pain?” asked John, and Sherlock grimaced.
Mycroft looked at the plant as though he was waiting for it to move of its own accord and start attacking them. “How,” he said after a long moment, and his voice
~o~O~o~
Before Sherlock could even begin to speak, John pivoted on his heel and half-turned, gun arm raised.
“What a disgustingly ordinary thing to say,” snapped Moriarty, tone sharp. He paced away, stopping with the body at his feet. He looked down at it. After a moment, he spoke again, without lifting his gaze, “Why do you think I brought you here, Sherlock?”
Nothing happened.
“Christ, I need a drink.”
“Hey!”
“’For now’? Do you think that’s going to change?”
“Yes,” said Sherlock, gathering his things. “And I’ve texted Kitty, but I didn’t hear back,” he added, with a small frown. “She may or may not turn up for the hopeful arrest, but I’ve told her where to wait for Lestrade.”
Before Sherlock or John could move, or speak, or think, Moriarty reached out a hand and touched one finger to Zhi Zhu’s face.
Mrs. Hudson came upstairs a short while later to find Sherlock and John chucking biscuits and socks across the room at each other, both nearly in tears from laughing.
Sherlock stared hard at his phone screen. It took him a minute to realize someone was talking to him. He looked up to find Lestrade’s and John’s faces peering at him with concern. “What?” he said, a little sharply.
, if he’s already gone?”
“The mud on the soles of the trainers,” said Sherlock, holding one up and rotating it so that the somewhat muddy heel was facing John.
actually saying something’s impossible?” said John, eyebrows raised. “You, the champion of impossible things?”
He did not notice as one minute expired, and a new minute began.
“A minor fixture—“
“But you trained here.”
John nodded, and heaved a sigh that wasn’t quite as steady as Sherlock might normally have expected. “Right. See you in a bit, I suppose.” With that, he left, shutting the door quietly behind him.
“Piss off,” Sherlock grumbled, folding his long limbs in his armchair like he was shielding himself. He and John sat in silence for a long time, John finally reopening his paper so that all Sherlock could see were John’s legs and his hands holding the newspaper up in front of the rest of him. Sherlock remained folded in the chair, glaring fixatedly at a point somewhere around John’s neck.
he was going to get out?”
“You might be able to fill in some of the gaps in my information,” Mycroft said. “But I might also be able to fill in some of yours. For one…” He paused as he reached into his briefcase, pulling out a print of a photograph. “… we may have a picture of Moriarty’s sniper.”
Sherlock catalogued this piece of information in his mind (he was confident he'd deduced everything else of potential importance just in looking at Watson, and of course later research could fill in any other gaps, but this was so much faster than asking Lestrade and watching as the policeman crawled through the explanation at an appallingly slow speed) and bulldozed on. "Because I was curious. Listen. In the next—" Consult the timer. "—thirty-six seconds, I need to know exactly what transpired in the moment before your death. Any and all details. And quite quickly."
Sherlock set his violin aside carefully in its case before he took up his mug.
His parents had sent him off to boarding school where he was out of the way and theoretically content, and Sherlock had never again permitted himself any sort of emotional attachment to anyone. He lost any sort of semblance of patience with people of average- to less-than-average intelligence; he was single-minded to a fault. Extraneous detail was hardly worth his time.
“Mm. All right. First question,” said Sherlock, and he sat back in his chair expectantly.
"Hello, Molly," said Sherlock dutifully, completely disinterested.
“Yes,” answered Sherlock predictably. “I think so. We did what Moriarty wanted. We figured out the truth about Gruner
“Really, really weird,” said John, who wasn’t sure if he wanted to laugh or shudder.
“No, no, it’s not…”
John squared his shoulders. “Look, Sherlock, it’s me or it’s a hospital. Your choice.”
John frowned. “When?”
“And frankly, considering the evidence, a bloody awful cabbie,” added John.
“This morning I was rudely woken by the sound of gunfire in John’s and my flat. In a panic I rushed downstairs with my standard-issue whaling harpoon in case something had happened to John to find him languishing in a chair complaining about being bored while he shot the wall. What a complete disregard for the wallpaper and the wall. Poor Mrs. Hudson. She’ll probably have a fit. It’s amazing how clueless John can be about other people’s feelings. What is life without feelings? I wonder if he has feelings. I know John has feelings but I wonder how they work in his fantastic mind. It’s amazing how he can be so stupid sometimes even though his intellect far outpaces the rest of us—“ John read through an alternatingly despairing and appraising monologue about his ignorance, followed by a recount of the conditions of the challenge from last night and finally a short narrative about the cases they were working on in the next few days.
murder, he might be sick—
“Um.”
“What do you mean?” asked John.
Sherlock loved a challenge. He lived for them. He lived for not being bored.
Mycroft looked to Lestrade. “You have everything under control here?”
“Look, just try, for the time being, to remain inconspicuous,” said Sherlock. “I work better alone anyway.”
There was a flash of light.
“Excellent, hate to hold you up, off you go…” said Sherlock, with an insistent sort of wave towards the door. Mrs. Hudson got to her feet, as did John, and John turned off the television with a faint expression of relief.
“Sentiment,” offered John.
“Oh my
occurred to him, until now, that just living his life, that just
“John!”
“But—I don’t understand,” said John. “There’s no reason to want to collect my body, at least for anyone other than you. I didn’t know anything. I wasn’t part of anything. Right?”
Gift, is different from mine. It excites him. Death excites him. Intrigues him. And his…
A man stepped out of the locker room, a few paces bringing him to stand at John’s side, where he stopped and gazed impassively from Sherlock—standing apart, gun raised—to John, kept in place by the sniper lights still on his chest. The newcomer was Chinese. Muscled, wiry, and inscrutable.
The police officer that Lestrade had left to keep an eye on Soo Lin’s room was several feet away at the nearest nurses’ station, along with a cluster of worried-looking people, all watching early news coverage of the explosion at the Secret Intelligence building. At the sound of Sherlock and John’s approach, they looked around—somewhat guiltily—and hurried to meet them. “Everything’s been quiet,” they started to say, but Sherlock and John ignored them and entered Soo Lin’s room.
John nodded, looking down at his current clothing. He was still wearing his day uniform, though any body armor and gear he had been wearing when he died had long since been removed. But the uniform was definitely his. There was even sandy dust still on his knees. He looked in the bag. “Fair enough. I’ve got clothes in here.”
“I’ve planned on how to get you out of here,” said John. “Just tell me when you’re ready, okay?”
Sherlock considered how much better his life would be if he could sink into the sofa cushions and vanish through the floor below and beyond, while John adjusted his gloves as if he was adjusting armor in preparation of a long and dismal battle.
Dead.
The crack on Young Sherlock's window—spanning three inches across—was evidence that the collision should have killed it.
~o~O~o~
The next few hours passed in unexpected contentedness. John perused files for anything that rang true with his recollections of his experiences both before his death and in listening to Hope’s testimony the previous day. He also amended his notes wherever Sherlock saw fit—“Honestly, sometimes you write like this is a melodramatic novella and not a factual account;
EDIT: Updates (most) Mondays!
When I was planning this part of the story, I had a specific goal in mind regarding these cases, and this chapter goes into a little more detail as to what I intended and why I would use Carl Powers to start us off. The whole point of the puzzles from Moriarty is for him to subtly intimate important personal details to Sherlock -- in this case, it's all about how long Moriarty has been doing this criminal mastermind thing, perfecting his skills, building his empire... It just so happens Sherlock's been doing it for the same amount of time. How perfect.
sorted out,” Sherlock snapped impatiently. “And if I need anything else, I’ll be sure to let you know.”
But—could
“No hospitals?” asked Lestrade.
“Well obviously you’re not going to report that I solved the case by breaking into a man’s house,” said Sherlock patiently.
Sherlock slouched irately to bed.
“… but I know where he is going.”
. Not quite, but almost.
All the sound in the world was quickly reduced from an earth-shattering bang to a high and endless ring—an internal, distant, broken alarm bell, and an absence of all other thought.
Literally, one minute.
Sherlock blinked, unexpectedly pleased by the comment in spite of the sarcastic tone it was delivered in. “You still want to see this through, then?”
“You misunderstand. I can’t because I won’t. Because I cannot and will not be used,” said Sherlock. He raised the gun again, pointing it at Moriarty, barely an inch from his forehead. Through sheer force of will, his aim was steady. “Not by anyone. Not even by you.”
“I’m guessing that’s supposed to mean something to me, but it doesn’t,” said John, plodding over to the kitchen and leaning against the counter. “What mud?”
Something told him to look at his timer.
Sherlock’s arguments were from all sorts of angles. ‘You can’t help’, ‘you shouldn’t help’, ‘I don’t need your help’, ‘I don’t want your help’.
Northumberland Fusilier battalion. You said you studied at Bart’s, so while you were trained in London, as you yourself stated, you are not a London native. I’m thinking you’re from south and west of London. Maybe Rushmoor. Your accent, and the way you drink tea, supports this and confirms that you are English. The sun-bleached highlights in your hair and the strength of your tan around your wrists and neck contrasted with the skin further up your arms would suggest you have been deployed for a number of months, and have been actively working most, if not all, of that time. You work in the field. Your mannerisms suggest a serious and businesslike attitude towards your work.”
“I guess,” said Sherlock. “I have to figure out what to do next. I’ve been distracted as of late, and I’m not sure what leads we have now. Your records are sealed, courtesy of MI5. Shan is dead, and her organization is dead or in hiding. The sniper and Moriarty himself are nowhere to be found, and there are no new related cases.”
that this is something you are willing and able to do, then we’re going to do it properly. We only take the most essential risks. Meeting time, meeting place, methods of communication… we consider everything.” He looked at John, who offered an approving (though still nervous) nod. “I will follow whatever leads I can between now and when we next speak,” Sherlock continued. “Now, about our next meeting… We can’t meet here, for obvious reasons. And I am reluctant to trust the security of texts or emails, or even phone calls. We could meet you at the museum. You’d be expected to be there during work hours, and it’s a public place. It’s not wholly unreasonable for me to go there.”
“Greg?”
Sherlock gave a smug nod, and settled back against the sofa cushions. “Sounds like you’re done, then. Thanks for your input.”
There was nothing even remotely simple about his current situation, and there wasn’t even anything simple about 221B, what with the myriad of experiments, odds and ends, and even the skull on the mantel cluttering every bit of space.
Maybe it was just time. Time to tell the truth. Time to risk everything. Maybe Mycroft was right and this case was bigger than he was. Perhaps he knew deep in his subconscious that right now it was him and John against the rest of the world, and that it didn’t always have to be.
you’re hiding in the fridge behind the mayonnaise.”
gift was insight. It was something like instinct, a little like some kind of sixth sense, like the universe would stop time for him only long enough to tell him what to do at speeds faster than the speed of thought.
Shattered glass was blasted around the room with a concussive burst of air that sent glass shards and loose papers flying in all directions, and hurled Sherlock to the ground. He hit the floor hard, along with half the contents of the room blasted off tables or falling from shelves, in an instant.
“No, my available Homeless informants,” Sherlock replied. “We need to be keeping an eye on more locations than the two of us can handle.”
She nodded. “I think so. One of us will know the usual places. I will not tell the others that I am searching for him on your behalf, but at least some will be worried enough to help me locate him if they think it is for their own benefit. And I can pass that information on to you.”
Sherlock fell into his chair by the window and grinned excitedly. “Moriarty.”
“Of course,” said John, nodding, and he opened a cabinet. He’d only just realized he was starving. “Do you know if we’ve got any biscuits?”
out of him.”
“So, we get a cab?”
“Speculating again,” Sherlock points out. “No point in guessing. And it’s hard to say, anyway. After all, blowing up a building is dramatic, but the shoes were direct evidence of a murder. The building led us to a blackmailer who is most likely
(I have no idea why I turn into a pirate when I put these warnings here, but let's just roll with it)
“My pain tolerance
The first was that he could not tell Lestrade about this. For obvious reasons.
Clever you, guessing about Carl Powers.
One thing was certain.
Six minutes, forty-nine seconds.
“I should think so, given that that is the entire point of British mass surveillance,” said Mycroft blandly.
“This is turning into a proper party,” said Moriarty. He gestured lazily to the man on John’s other side. “I believe you may have met before, as a matter of fact.”
John swore again, before the chemical now racing through his bloodstream dragged him under.
“So,” said John, licking his lips anxiously but sitting up very straight, shoulders back. “Let’s take care of this quickly. I have places to b—“
“Fine,” said Sherlock, with equal enthusiasm. “We need to go back to Baker Street.”
“I don’t like it either,” sighed Mycroft, though there was an unfamiliar care in his voice as he said it. “But as your older brother, it is my unfortunate duty to constantly worry about your welfare. And since I’m already worrying about your physical wellbeing, given the current situation, I might as well worry about everything else. And somehow, talking about this is easier than pretending to be matter-of-fact about how little time we probably all have left to live.”
The red sniper lights hovering on the doors around the room and over Sherlock’s chest abruptly raced across walls and tiles to cluster on John, quivering just above his heart. Almost exactly where the bullet that had killed him had struck.
All three hypotheses seemed perfectly reasonable when John finally opened his mouth and managed to utter a stunned, “Hello.”
“If all that is true,” said John, “then at least we know one good thing. Moriarty didn’t think Shan’s body would give you anything useful with which to find him. So clearly he doesn’t know all of your tricks.”
track. You can't always work on your own...! John might be stuck lying low in the flat 99% of the time until this mess with Moriarty blows over, but his function as Sherlock's pseudo-emotions-coach is nonetheless critical. XD I always liked John's role in canon as Sherlock's support team in times of trouble.
“His age is easy enough to figure out. His hands have the calluses of a man who has long worked with paintbrushes—the calluses are all over the fingers of his dominant hand, in this case the left, but most thick by far on the middle and ring fingers where the brush has rested against the finger while being held—but since the calluses cover a larger area of the palm as well it must be a house-painting style of brush. So, house painter it is. You can also see he’s slightly hunched, suggesting back damage, not uncommon in a man who has spent the last forty years of his life bending to paint high places. His heavily muscled arms support that conclusion. His handshake is firm, though, so he must be in control of his faculties.
John straightened, feeling stiff. But definitely alive.
There was a pause, and then Moriarty let out an excited laugh, and clapped his hands together. “Oh.
harshly—of Mrs. Hudson, as he stalked over to them, taking in the scene. Clearly they’d been talking for several hours. Sherlock could have physically winced. He didn’t trust John enough to keep secrets of this magnitude with no effort, and Sherlock trusted Mrs. Hudson not to gossip about as much as one might trust known criminals with the PIN to a checking account.
“He’ll be fine,” said Mycroft, evidently reading Sherlock’s thoughts. “Calm down.”
was the craziest? You invaded Afghanistan,” said Sherlock.
“You want to talk about it?” said John, already expecting Sherlock to pick up his head to glare some more at the very idea of talking about things.
The list of things to consider was only getting longer with every bit of information he’d gotten from Sherlock, and he knew a good deal of it, he would have to figure out on his own.
“I guess.”
“Shoes?” finished Sherlock, crouching down to look at the pair of trainers that had been placed in the middle of the faint little patch of blood that marked the spot where Shan had died. “Yes, yes they are.”
Shadows traced their way along the walls, and time stretched on with incredible slowness. The only sign of life was their quiet breathing, and the tap of Sherlock’s fingers drumming out rhythms on the arm of his chair.
Molly looked at the floor. “You’re just saying that.”
Sherlock’s response was thoroughly condescending. “I solved a twenty-year-old murder with a pair of shoes. You
He was not as talented a liar when lying to himself.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows. “No? But then again, I don’t think Moriarty wants me dead
“That seems unlikely,” said Lestrade.
It was almost painful watching Watson trying to think, when Sherlock's mind was moving so much faster, and with such urgency.
John didn’t look convinced. “You don’t think it might have something to do with the fact that Moriarty caught us off guard? And attacked our home?”
He yelped and sat up, rubbing his head and turning to face the door so he could glare at Sherlock, albeit blearily. “
“Probably. But, like we’ve been saying over and over for weeks now, finding the sniper is going to be like trying to track a tiger,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock hated waiting.
He ignored the text.
Sherlock quickly dug into his coat pocket and pulled out his phone, dialing 999. After a few minutes of hurried explanation and direction with the operator, he disconnected. He fired off a series of rapid texts to Lestrade too, as he crossed the room to John and Soo Lin.
John regarded Moran coldly. “I’m an army doctor, which means I could break every bone in your body, while naming them.”
“And yet.” Shan paced a few steps closer. She was a small woman, but Sherlock could see hard lines in her face and a strength to her hands that said she had seen hard times. Long, hard, painful times. Maybe Moriarty had bought her allegiance, and thus the allegiance of her people, with escape from that hard life.
? And how, pray tell, do you know
“Were you?”
Molly bit her lip and frowned anxiously. “Am I wrong? It
Moriarty smiled. “I like to keep things tidy. Even dead men have secrets to tell, and nothing upsets the government more than stealing the bodies of murdered soldiers. And like I said, maybe Johnny-boy would be working for me now, if you hadn’t beaten me to him. Or there’d be nothing left of him at all for us to talk to. Whichever would have amused me more.” He laughed again. “Imagine my surprise that night when I get a call from my people that there’s no one in the body bag! Like he just got up and walked right out of the morgue.” He let out a blissful sigh. “I had a feeling about you, Sherlock. You were important, even if I didn’t see how at the time. So I had you watched. After a while you got a little too close for comfort. You asked too many questions about the Black Lotus and gave them a scare. They got ahead of themselves and decided it would be safer for them, and me, if you were dead. But then—well, you can guess the look on my face when
Amberley started opening windows around the living room. John and Lestrade helped, throwing the windows wide to let some blissfully fresh-smelling air enter the house. Finally all three men sat in the living room, trying to ignore the heady smell of paint that was strong enough to taste. Amberley rearranged the pieces on the chessboard in front of him. Amberley was much calmer today than he’d been the day before, as if he was coming to terms with a grim prospect. “Can I get you anythi—“
“It’s not unreasonable for me to question the company you keep,” said Mycroft, hand withdrawn and umbrella again striking the pavement to punctuate his point. He leaned on it, leaning forward with an expression of acute frustration. “Especially when, as far as I can tell, they don’t exist.”
“You’re late, that’s what happened,” snapped Sherlock. “You’re late. He’s already gone. He was here and now he’s gone.”
worried?” he said, in lieu of an actual greeting.
John didn’t reply right away. Instead he held up a sheet of cling-film, looking at Sherlock critically through the plastic. “Hm.”
“And regardless, my opinion doesn’t matter. Sherlock might have told me—for your benefit, mind you—but he clearly does not need anything from me. What I think about it doesn’t change what he’s capable of. Personal feelings aside—“
“Suit yourself.” John stood and went to the kitchen, leaving Sherlock with his phone.
And so this is how it was that Young Sherlock was sitting in his room, avoiding tedium, when his destiny crashed into his bedroom window and died.
Sherlock hurried after him, hissing urgently, “What are you doing?”
“… We were
had done this, from a few simple deductions in the course of the next fourteen minutes as he watched the sparrow flit about the elm by his window.
“Incredibly so.” Mycroft tapped the photo on the desk idly. “I acquired this image from the morgue at St Bart’s here in London. The John in this photograph is, quite clearly, dead. Which makes you being here in front of me, not dead, rather intriguing. Indeed, the John in this photograph was killed in the line of duty, overseas—an army doctor in Afghanistan, as a matter of fact. But I’m sure you know that already.”
“How about you try for some semblance of professionalism?” said John. “At least pretend, if that’s the best you can do. Come on.”
Sherlock shifted. He never needed help. He never had to call on doctors. He never needed someone to fix him up.
John frowned, circling the table to sit down across from Sherlock. “But
“No one plays him and wins,” said Sherlock icily. “He’s made that clear to everyone who’s crossed his path. But it looks like you’ve forgotten. And now he’s done with you.”
“That’s all very cavalier now,” said Sherlock. “But I don’t think you understand how much danger this really is.”
“Leading you to believe he wouldn’t be replaced.”
Across from him, John was breathing hard, as though he’d just run a mile, and he looked up from the once-again-deceased cabbie at Sherlock.
Sherlock slammed his hands down on the kitchen table. “
“I’ll—
“That seems perfectly reasonable to me,” said Sherlock quietly. “Death may not be a straightforward thing in my world, but that does not mean it is without an effect. As you are so fond of telling me, you are allowed to
Still talking with Mrs. Hudson (“you look thin, dear…”—“I’m fine, thank you”—“really?”—“yes”—“
“Don’t move,” he ordered, speaking loudly, knowing Sherlock’s ears would be ringing. “Don’t move just yet. Can you hear me?”
Sighing, thoroughly relieved that this was done, John quickly cleaned his shoulder with a few antiseptic wipes, and tossed them in the waste bin by the sink.
He wasn’t willing to say it out loud, but Soo Lin was probably right. If the line of communication between Moriarty and the Black Lotus had gone silent, then it was almost certainly because their business together was at an end. And if that was the case, Moriarty would liquidate these assets, rather than simply cut them loose.
“I had Mycroft drop it off this morning,” said Sherlock. “I’ll let you set it up and add whatever contacts you deem necessary. Admittedly, since you’re supposed to be dead right now, it likely won’t be too many. But, then again, you’re a slower typist than a six-year-old, so—“
case—was only getting bigger, and the body count was growing. The dead informant, John, the cabbie Jeff Hope’s victims, and now Shan.
Sherlock waved this away. “The Lucky Cat incident was different. I’m aware, now. And more cautious. And, I’ll add, not dead, thanks to John and Lestrade.”
John had a habit of keeping his personal space and possessions in order. He wasn’t obsessive about tidiness—sharing a flat with Sherlock made that unequivocally unrealistic—but every time Sherlock had ventured up to John’s room to talk to him or chuck something at his head, John’s room was neatly organized. Sherlock had assumed this habit had carried over from John’s time in the army. Minimalist, meaningful belongings and décor. Bed made. Important items properly stored but easily available. All very pragmatic and understated. Rather like John.
Sherlock spent the duration of his cab ride to St. Bart’s in absolute silence.
“This is a lot to take in. Everything with Moriarty. Yesterday the only person who could bring the dead back to life was you. Today there are two of you, and the other one really,
The Detective made a mental note concerning Watson's reflex reaction times.
“Does anyone know CPR?” said Sherlock to the small crowd at large, mind racing. When no one came forward within five seconds, Sherlock seized his opportunity and got to his feet.
“Or possibly both,” said Sherlock. “I might argue that the biggest problem we have right now is that we have no insight as to the state of the network. The only ones who might know where to look for Moriarty are people who are dead or want us dead. A lot.” He paused and looked at John over the top of the laptop. “Are you
“Yes.”
Lestrade gave Sherlock a withering look as they walked to his office. “You know what I mean.”
It was morning two days after their conversation with Mycroft before Sherlock finally emerged from his room. John’s journal was open on his lap to a blank page (as it had been for an hour) when he heard Sherlock trudge to the bathroom, and a few minutes later he appeared in the kitchen, hair disheveled and dark bags under his eyes. John didn’t think he’d slept much.
“How else would he make his point?”
were to hear of this in the news, without being told personally beforehand, the consequences could be unthinkable. But, perhaps, with explanation, he would be – merciful.
“It’s only me,” said Mrs. Hudson, pushing her way in carrying a tray set with two mugs.
Another slightly challenging chapter (it's hard to figure out how to divvy up space between Sherlock and John - I always worry I'm making them boring), but I think I like how it's turned out! Lots of Lestrade, lots of John, lots of Sherlock, and lots of mystery
“True.”
Sherlock spent the next few hours with his eyes practically glued to his laptop screen, clicking from page to page, from image to image, from article to article, eyes flickering across the screen so fast that just looking at them move made John a little dizzy.
Sherlock brought his hands around to his front, massaging his wrists. They were raw from the hours he’d spent slumped, unconscious, but it could have been worse. He tentatively tried to stand, and the floor pitched under his feet. He stayed down.
John wasn’t with him.
Watson had spoken, commented, praised, and Sherlock's brain had simply… switched off.
The man waved a hand carelessly, turned on the spot, and ran.
“It’ll do,” said John, starting forward again.
“If I were me, you mean?”
“Until now, yeah, that’s been the case,” said John. “But this time it’s different. I don’t know how much you know about—“
John sat back. “So, what exactly are you implying here?”
“Of course I can,” replied Sherlock derisively, and he pushed himself forward to take a step.
“It’d be creepy if you had,” said John, donning his stethoscope again and warming the chestpiece against his palm for a few seconds before setting it on Sherlock’s chest and listening. He instructed Sherlock to take deep breaths a few times, and Sherlock did so without comment, and John finally took off the stethoscope. “You sound normal,” announced John.
“Pass me my phone, will you.” John made it as a statement.
Puzzle #2 in the bag!
me, then,” snapped Sherlock. “Maybe that’s more important. I can shout over you if I have to, but I can’t force you to stop assuming everything I say is a ploy. I know that this will be difficult for you to believe. It isn’t logical. It sounds ridiculous, and childish, and possibly insane. I know all of that. It took me a long time to accept that this was real, and this wasn’t just in my head. And it took me even longer to understand it. How I could use it. So for once, just try—just
John frowned. “What do you mean?”
Anywho ~
“I know you’re keen to sleep…” said John, anticipating the objection that followed within fractions of a second.
“Where?”
“… Am I supposed to know what that means?” asked John, but he got to his feet when Sherlock gestured furiously again, and followed the other man out of the flat.
~o~O~o~
Standing in front of Mycroft, the truth hanging in the air between them, Sherlock felt like he’d only now just realized that Hope was still residing in the jar.
“I need to take this,” Sherlock said to Molly, before answering the phone. “Mycroft?”
“Why cut him loose?” asked John finally, ever full of more questions. “Why does Moriarty want to get rid of him?”
“I’m sure Moriarty could blow up another building on our street, if it’d be any more interesting for
Mycroft and Lestrade made their way to the door, with John following suit. Lestrade hurried down the stairs, but Mycroft paused, glancing back at Sherlock. “Keep an eye on him,” he said quietly to John, still watching his brother.
John already had one foot on the stairs when Sherlock said, “John?”
Lestrade swallowed his mouthful and tried again. “Do you think that there’s a chance Mycroft was wrong? That Moriarty isn’t going to get in contact?”
"Ah," said Sherlock, his hands in his pockets. The reason he was here became rapidly apparent. "So, will I speaking with him? The dead informant."
“Sherlock,” repeated Mycroft.
Happy 2015~!
"That's very nice," said Sherlock, taking his cue to leave, and he marched to the door leading back outside. Lestrade hurried to catch up.
Sherlock set fire to the kitchen curtains.
John was used to difficult patients. He’d been a doctor in all sorts of environments with all sorts of people. He would be hard-pressed to find a set of circumstances that were at all alien to him. Or, at least, that had been the case before he’d been killed. Now—well, there was something to be said for the difficulty involved with treating a patient like Sherlock. For any other patient resisting treatment, John would have just started anyway and made the best of the situation. But that was different with Sherlock, as proceeding without his cooperation had the potential to be catastrophic (at best, exasperating and at worst, fatal) for both them. “The sooner we get you patched up, the sooner you can relax,” said John. “And the better you’ll feel. Because I doubt you feel all that great right now.”
Lestrade gestured for the two of them to follow, ducking under the police tape that created a boundary between the rest of the street and the side alley now crawling with officers. Sherlock fell in step, and John did the same after a beat.
Sherlock looked at John critically, while the paramedic snuck away. “… You
Sherlock and John exchanged looks—Sherlock’s eager, John’s skeptical—before Sherlock turned back to Soo Lin. “You think you can find him?”
He was sitting with his back against the tiled wall of a locker room. The room was completely unfamiliar, but even so it only took a few seconds to take stock of his surroundings. To his left were a few rows of small metal lockers, empty and padlocked, with benches set into the floor. To his right stood a number of cubicle showers. Beyond the showers, visible through translucent panes set into a set of double doors, was pale blue light playing on the glass. Water. That and the chlorine meant they had to be at some kind of swimming pool.
It was funny, really, John thought, as he watched Sherlock sit there, lost in thought.
“You shot people today,” said Sherlock, ignoring John’s question.
“No, I just…” said Lestrade, faltering briefly under the intensity of Sherlock’s gaze, but to everyone’s surprise, he stood his ground. “I let you handle the shoes on your own because I thought it was safe. Just a line of inquiry to follow, like most of the other cases you and I deal with. But I can’t do that anymore, not if there’s a chance people could get seriously hurt while he plays games with you.”
“Regardless—“ started Sherlock, but Lestrade interrupted.
“Carl Powers was eleven years old when he was killed, and his death was over twenty years ago. So anyone younger than, say, about thirty is too young to be Moriarty. But anyone Carl’s age or older who could have gotten close to him at any time could have killed him. So we can infer that Moriarty is probably at least thirty years old.”
Mycroft did everything shrouded in code and mystery. Part of it was vanity, a love of showing off through the ready way in which he communicated with ciphers. Another part of it was just a Holmes family penchant for the dramatic. But a great deal of it was grounded in practicality, so that in moments of danger or dire consequence, entire conversations could be contained in a handful of words and numbers. And, though he was ever a man of logic, Mycroft’s sole forays into the theological were when it made for a useful code.
The policeman actually looked as if he felt
Sherlock thought.
“I try to,” said John. “He just doesn’t always make it easy.”
Sherlock knew John had not forgiven him from keeping the full circumstances of his return to life a secret. But he doubted any such forgiveness would be given until they spoke with the cab driver who had died when John’s minute was up, and even then, Sherlock wasn’t inclined to think that would be a particularly healing experience. He preferred the cynical attitude that now John and Lestrade—the only people who knew about Sherlock’s ability to bring the dead back to life with a single touch—were now conspiratorially against his use of his Gift.
“That’s what I’ve been told,” Lestrade said again. “And I’m as dubious as you are, Sherlock, but keep in mind that no one else at the Yard
Night was swallowing him whole.
Then the sniper wasn’t likely to be among them. If the sniper was here, it would not be to exchange any kind of pleasantries, and murder with a long-range precision firearm would be ill-conceived if carried out at a range that facilitated whispering.
puzzle #1: gruesome murder
“Come on, John,” he managed finally, giving Mycroft one more hard look before turning and walking from the room.
“Well,
"Whatever you say," said Sherlock in a tone of utter disinterest that thoroughly did not make sense in connection with the fact that he was conversing with a dead person, and with that he lightly poked the woman's cheek.
Sherlock ignored John’s protests and focused on the numbers. Exactly twenty-two seconds passed, and then Sherlock coolly punched four buttons. The alarm beeped, and reset.
“You had no way to know how he’d take it,” said John sympathetically, wishing it wouldn’t be potentially fatal to pat Sherlock on the shoulder or hug him or try to do something reassuring. “You couldn’t have known.”
A thousand apologies for the very late update.
“But I assume he isn’t talking, in spite of being caught ‘red-handed’.”
“He’ll be nearby.”
“Good. And using that…” Sherlock urged.
He had no idea how long he stood mutely in the dark, trying not to think too much about the bomb on his chest, or about how he had no way to tell
At the tender age of eight years, three months, four days, nineteen hours, and thirty-seven minutes, Young Sherlock was sitting in his bedroom, ignoring his chores.
Sherlock nodded. “Introduce the poison into his medications—into the skin creams, particularly—and it would enter directly into the blood stream as he applied the medication to his feet. Paralysis a couple hours later as the toxin is carried all throughout the body, and death follows almost immediately by nerve shutdown and associated asphyxiation. And drowning didn’t help.”
He tugged on the sleeve of his left arm, which covered his recently stitched shoulder.
“Yeah,” said John, tone dripping with sarcasm. “Then, there was the added challenge of people trying to kill us.”
After a final pause, Soo Lin let go of his sleeve, and dropped her hand to the floor.
The rest of the day passed in a blur.
"I merely reconstruct the obvious from the available data," said Sherlock, but he was smiling just the slightest bit now. An unfamiliar tug at the corner of his lips and the dull thrum of endorphins. Flattery is not entirely lost on him. It's too rarely given to be wholly ineffective. "People don't normally say it's 'amazing'."
Kitty shook John’s hand brusquely. She was about John’s height, with long wavy red hair that fell below her shoulders. She had a sharp, fierce look about her, and was staggeringly beautiful, though John thought that she looked strained on closer inspection, like she’d been on edge for a long time.
John opened his mouth to reply, but the car slowed, and finally rolled to a halt along the curb outside a stately looking building. John looked around the street. He didn’t recognize the place, but it was certainly upscale. It had the air of a banker’s office or some expensive club.
Seemed like a modest enough request.
But, of course, the gun wasn’t there now.
John didn’t move.
at him. He blinked. “Uh.”
Lestrade.”
No rest for anyone ever
They stepped inside. “How are you feeling?” John inquired. “The doctor said you were doing well, but you’re likely to be here for a few more days as a precaution. After all, you really shouldn’t be up and moving about too quickly. Not after an abdominal wound.”
Sherlock scowled for a moment as they walked away from the building, getting back to the main road. They both spent a few minutes flagging down a cab, and they clambered inside—Sherlock couldn’t help but notice that he felt significantly less discomfort taking a cab now—before starting off towards Baker Street. Neither man spoke much, Sherlock still wrapped up in the evening’s developments and John still processing his unexpected change in circumstances.
“He agreed to meet?” asked John, sitting up and yawning.
Sherlock had taken Mrs. Hudson up on her long-standing offer.
Suddenly, there were footsteps in the hallway. Sherlock put his arms back as if he was still trapped, and drooped his head in a semblance of unconsciousness.
"You think, or you know?" said Sherlock, and he took a calculated step in Watson's direction.
“Lestrade,
He touched one finger to a dying flower.
“So,” continued Sherlock, “we know the child in question came from Sussex to London twenty years ago and left his shoes behind.”
“I don’t exactly have any plan behind that statement, so to me that’s pretty much as detailed as it gets.”
It was impossible to deny.
So why was it?
Lestrade looked at him.
Sherlock’s mouth was rather dry.
John slid his bag through the window and passed it to Sherlock. “How do you lock a window from the outside when it latches on the inside?”
“Because if Moriarty is as smart as I think he is, he’ll know by now that I’m not going to let this go. If I have to raise hell, I will.”
Both Sherlock and Mycroft shook their heads. “Something thoughtlessly deposited or abandoned or moved is innocuous,” said Sherlock. “But something specific
“What do you want me to do?” said Sherlock, his heart in his throat.
,” he said with a grin. “You shameless tease. Such a smooth-talker. You’re right, of course. You’d be lumped together with the rest of the world’s population of idiots if you hadn’t stolen him from me.”
“I might not have caught him without your assistance,” Sherlock pointed out.
“Back up,” snapped Gruner. “Hands over your head.”
“What, that?” said John, gesturing back at the still-stunned Donovan and Anderson.
For the first time since entering the room, Sherlock looked at John.
Sherlock fell silent, pursing his lips. He turned his gaze out of the newly-repaired windows, which enabled him to avoid looking at John.
“John Watson?” said Sherlock, and it felt very, very odd to pretend to have only a casual, passing interest in the name. “This was three or four weeks ago now.”
stop it's weird when you're nice
The Detective sat alone in the backseat of the car, with John riding passenger in the front next to Lestrade. Bloody and pale, Sherlock’s contributions to any conversation went from brief sentences to grunts to pointed silence, and John and Lestrade let him be. John thought Sherlock might fall asleep in the car, but every time he looked in the rearview mirror, Sherlock’s eyes were open and fixed on the view out the window, streetlights glittering in his eyes.
“Well, John,” said Sherlock with an approving little grin. “Really well.”
sort of why I’m here.”
“I could go with you,” suggested John, for the twenty-second time in two days, four hours, and nineteen minutes (Sherlock had been counting). “I could maybe talk to someone for you, or I could go along, or I could help jog some memories, or—“
“How do you
Sherlock glanced sideways at Lestrade out of the corner of his eye, as Lestrade gestured with a half-eaten donut in one hand, the other hand on the steering wheel of his car. “Very sure. You know I don’t eat when I’m working.”
John raised an eyebrow. “Is that a good thing or a bad thing?”
John Watson’s life as an army doctor had been one of consistent routine and not wholly inconsiderable danger. John and his fellow doctors had served in a mobile capacity rotating to both army and civilian groups in the Helmand district for several months. John himself found himself both serving in makeshift surgeries and in the field without warning, but nevertheless the days formed a sort of routine out of necessity, at least in terms of food, rest, and scarce time spent away from injured, sick, and dying. John had enjoyed his work. The barracks were attacked on a couple separate occasions. In the months he had been deployed, John’s colleagues (his
“But you’re going to have to keep Gruner fooled long enough to find the camera without him getting suspicious of you.”
“Are you all right?” asked John.
Hope laughed. “You’re not going to find him, Mr. Holmes. He’ll find you long before you can find him. He knows all about you and it’s just a matter of time.”
“It’s brilliant,” said Sherlock. John gave him a reprimanding look, and Sherlock continued, “It is. It’s not much different from hiring a mercenary, but there’s something remarkable about thinking to do it with someone who has nothing to lose, no history, and the mental capacity to cause some proper chaos.”
Readers, I owe you all a thousand apologies for the lateness of this chapter. I thought there would be a delay because of finals, but I never anticipated such a massive delay. D: Rest assured I'm doing my best to make up for it!
However, John Watson, at thirty-six years, three months, fifteen days, and ten minutes, had had no idea he would only live for another sixty seconds when he first arrived on the scene.
Sherlock opened and closed his mouth a few times. “Better late than never,” he said finally.
“For what?”
John gave Sherlock a pointed look. “You think I’m going to let you sideline me because things got bad? Look, I hate to be an ass about it, but I’m a soldier. I don’t back down when it gets bad.”
“So, Mycroft, in short: Moriarty identified one of the individuals employed in your Secret Intelligence building, and used them to acquire the details of Moran’s location and security provisions. It took him a
“Here’s the thing. You know what I’ve been wondering all night?” said Moriarty, interrupting Sherlock’s thoughts, his grin fading into a kind of serene curiosity.
“It just happened,” he said again. “It does that.”
Sherlock sat back. “Lestrade probably didn’t want to mention it was my brother because he understood that you and he shouldn’t interact. My brother is something of a… I don’t know, a criminal mastermind?”
“But what are you supposed to learn from a bowl?” said Lestrade.
And at that second, there were no more seconds left.
Sherlock ground his teeth and snapped, “But this
Sherlock sighed. “Admittedly very little. No physical evidence from the scene, no idea where Moriarty went, and no contacts within his organization who are not permanently dead.”
Shan had warned him. She had
[lame reasons for why i suck at the end of the chapter]
“I thought we’d made progress,” John continued, his tone icy. “We’d agreed that you would stop trying to go it alone. We’ve been doing things together for weeks. And you know that the rest of us have been trying to implement as many unobtrusive safety precautions as humanly possible,
“I need a case,” he rasped, in a tone of deep loathing, before he collapsed onto the sofa and curled up there, dragging a blanket over himself so only his head stuck out.
Lestrade was waiting for them when they reached the scene. As the cab rolled to a stop—Sherlock practically throwing money at the cab driver and hopping out, with John following after—the Inspector walked forward from the line of police cars and yellow tape surrounding the area.
But that wasn’t entirely true. Sherlock had never felt as distracted as he did right now. It rather felt like a piece of his chest had been removed, and he found its absence incredibly distracting. He didn’t understand it; he just knew that it hurt. But while working should fix it, like it fixed everything else, he just couldn’t bring himself to try when he felt like this.
No one knew about Sherlock’s gift. That was impossible.
Four little words, and John stopped trying to be calm.
“Well, scold him for me,” tittered Mrs. Hudson. “I’m just popping next door to see Mr. Chatterjee, and then I’ll be in this afternoon.”
When not out roaming the city at all hours of the day and night, Sherlock was combing through case files and, intermittently, John’s notes. He stopped to interrogate John twice concerning details of first his life as an army doctor and then his recollections of his time in the coffin before Sherlock had come to retrieve him.
Realization dawned on John. “Under the doghouse,” he said in a shocked voice, and Sherlock gave him an appraising look. “In the backyard, under the doghouses. He kept looking out there into the yard, and it’s the only place where you wouldn’t notice someone had been digging; the rest of the yard’s too overgrown. He buried them under there.”
Sherlock waved a hand. “An unfortunate detail. My point is, now we have a timeline, and we have some idea as to what to look for. And a gun is practically a name. We can trace it. I’m certain. It may take time, but I’m sure it’s possible. If we can find something a little more concrete—a serial number, a mark on one of the bullets so we can determine manufacturing information… then we might have just have the sniper within our grasp.” Sherlock paused his pacing long enough to grab his long, black coat off the hook by the door and tug it on one sleeve at a time.
I hope this chapter was somewhat worth the wait!
Fingers crossed for a timely, extra-exciting update next week (I swear, this semester is killing me - four classes and a research thesis are proving to be the death of me), to make up for the delay in getting this chapter finished and up.
“Why not?” said Hope, painfully ignorant of the timer. “Kill a few strangers. Live a little before I die. And make some money for my kids. You see—“ The cabbie tapped the side of his nose knowingly, smiling at Sherlock with a self-satisfied air to his grin. “I had a sponsor.”
Lestrade was puffing up with indignant rage so quickly that if someone were to poke him with a needle, he might have deflated and flown about the room like a punctured balloon. “Because you
Their conversation was interrupted when the cab finally pulled up to the hospital’s visitor entrance. They got out, paid the fare, and passed through the sliding glass doors into the lobby. Sherlock hung back and let John take the lead talking to one of the nurses managing the front desk to get information and directions to Soo Lin’s room. He’d decided that it was (probably) relatively safe for John to be seen around the hospital again, as long as details of identity were kept to a relative minimum. And he had long since recognized that John’s mood was always best when he felt he was doing something—even something as small as asking someone for a hospital room number.
Sherlock paced a few steps, fingers again steepled in front of his lips as he spoke, his default pose when thinking heavily. Watson watched him. "But then you turn up in time to treat the dying informant. You don't know anything about this man, but your presence while he is alive is an unacceptable complication to those trying to have him killed. You become a risk to them."
That would be the real problem.
Sherlock shrugged. “Why don’t you give it a go?”
“There is no way on Earth I would do what you did. I’m not
John opened the door fully.
” squeaked John.
“Do we know what we need to be ready
“Shan’ll speak with you,” said the man flatly. London native. Maybe a banker, judging by his nose and fingertips.
“A little close for comfort, perhaps,” conceded Sherlock. “But you’ll note I’m not dead, so you must have managed.”
“Sherlock!” said John, hurrying to join him at the door. John hovered uncertainly, aware he would be unwise to get too close to Sherlock for fear of accidental contact but also wanting to lean in and speak urgently. Sherlock was kind enough to stop walking, but not enough to stop from scowling. “Where are you gonna go now?” asked John, and Sherlock could see a determined edge to John’s facial expression that meant Sherlock knew exactly why John was asking.
The realization dawned on him as he instantly recognized the tread, the weight, and the decided air of a man on a mission.
“Wake up.”
Soo Lin shifted, eyes dropping to her lap once more. “It was bad enough when we were being led by Shan. But it was much worse when she was killed, and
“I accept your terms,” said Sherlock solemnly, with two fingers mentally crossed.
John snorted, and said, “No, thanks.”
“Can you roll your ankles?” asked John. When Sherlock met this question with silence, John demonstrated, lifting one foot off the ground and rotating it clockwise. “You know, move it around without much pain?”
Readers, I owe you several thousand apologies for the very unexpected hiatus. I'm inarguably the scum of the earth and the best I can do is beg your forgiveness and hope the promise of no more hiatuses and a lot of impending drama is enough to make it up to you.
“You underestimate me,” said Sherlock coldly.
Where is this story going? How are they going to deal with Moriarty? How the hell am I going to wrap this story up in 6 chapters? We shall soon see…
“Yes, General Shan.”
John resisted the (potentially fatal) urge to smack Sherlock upside the head, but just barely.
time, anyway.
, the woman Pandora opened a jar which contained all of the evils of the world. In doing so, she unleashed burden and sickness and death on humanity, but she closed the jar before the final denizen could escape. Hope was kept inside.
“… Were you asleep?” came Lestrade’s voice on the other end of the line.
“It has a parking citation,” said Mycroft pointedly, glaring daggers at Sherlock.
“But if something goes wrong…” John added firmly, “… then we change the plan. If you feel you’re in danger or if you discover that it’s impossible to find the sniper safely, then don’t. Don’t compromise your safety.”
He hadn’t been sure how he was going to feel or what he was going to want to say when he saw Mycroft, but now all he felt was a bubbling outrage deep in the pit of his stomach.
“Precisely,” said Sherlock. “I really don’t need someone who’s seen you when you were dead to recognize you right now. But she might be able to get us
Back in the kitchen, Sherlock finished editing his notes on the Carl Powers case and emailed them to Lestrade, before he packed up the shoes and samples. Sherlock was confident he’d solved the case in its entirety, and now the paperwork could be given to less intelligent people. Sherlock had better things to do. Namely, get ready for the next puzzle from Moriarty.
So it was at this moment, at eight years, three months, four days, nineteen hours, and fifty-one minutes of age, that Young Sherlock vowed he would never again care about another human being.
“You said you wanted to help me.”
John sighed. “Both, then,” he said. He was evidently frustrated. “How long are you going to keep glaring at your phone?”
Sherlock stepped outside and made a beeline for the car. Again John and Lestrade followed, though John now made a point of staying half a dozen steps back, as Mycroft came into view. “I thought I told you that you didn’t need to come,” said Sherlock, the second Mycroft was within earshot.
“No, you don’t understand,” interrupted Sherlock. “
All at once, Sherlock was eight years, three months, four days, nineteen hours, and fifty-one minutes old again. Because from that exact moment, and the twenty-five years, eight months, eleven days, two hours, and forty-three minutes since then that he had lived knowing that he could bring the dead back to life, Sherlock had been alone. In all that time, he had found himself faced with questions about life, death, and all that lay between. And he had done it all believing that his Gift was his curse alone, and that no one—no one—would ever understand what that meant.
“Yeah, but you’re kind of a dick,” said John.
“Medical doctorate.”
Sherlock scowled, but after a pause, he set the box down on the hood of Mycroft’s car and opened the box. He held out the letter to Mycroft, who glanced briefly at the little piece of pottery inside before taking the paper.
Sherlock laced his fingers delicately and nodded. “Exceedingly intelligent.”
Sherlock shook his head. “Normally I would. But I don’t want anyone involved. If I’m working at home and directing someone else to run any necessary chemical tests there—Molly, perhaps, or even Lestrade in a pinch—then I can keep my work isolated. I don’t have to involve the police or Bart’s or my brother or anyone. I can do this myself.”
Sherlock glared at him. “
“Photoshop,” repeated Mycroft.
“Look, I don’t
Sherlock fought hard to keep a hold on at least some measure of calm and self-control. “Do what, exactly?”
John please
John’s expression softened a little, though it remained intently focused. “So how long do people usually get to stick around for?”
Sherlock did not reply right away, not really sure what to say.
“Go, Sherlock,” interrupted John.
“So what have you got?” he asked Sherlock.
“But we could just bypass this whole affair, and you could shoot me now.” Sherlock gestured to the gun visibly clutched in Moran’s right hand. “You would save us all a lot of trouble.”
Sherlock raked his hands through his hair frustratedly, watching the view out the window in a detached kind of way. At last, the cab turned onto Baker Street, and Sherlock craned his neck, peering at 221B.
“I can do that,” said John. “Besides, probably not good if a known dead guy is spotted at Tesco’s or at the bank or something stupid like that.”
John rubbed his shoulder absently—the stitches would need to be removed soon—and sighed. “I guess we’ve got a lead now.”
Thank you all so much for sticking with me, and thanks for all of your support and love last update. It made my day/week/month and it has me even more excited than I already was to get back to updating this for all of you. :D Thank you very much!
“Longer than most would guess, given my youthful good looks,” said Moriarty coyly, batting his eyes. “But you don’t guess. You know.”
“Except it does,” said Sherlock, trying so hard to be patient.
“He’s a soldier. He’s capable. He can handle himself until help arrives. He might be happy to give Moran a black eye.”
For what it was worth, Mycroft didn’t question how Sherlock had gotten the information about the sniper’s plan to assassinate Gruner. He didn’t even pause to question its legitimacy. The two Holmes brothers exchanged information with as many details packed to the fewest possible words, and in less than three minutes Mycroft was snapping orders to his legion of anonymous secretaries, and Sherlock hung up.
There was a long pause.
John waited for the axe to fall.
The facts were these:
But John wasn’t especially listening anymore. He sat back, hands pressed over his eyes. “I didn’t think this could get any more mental and then you tell me I’m sort of immortal.”
“I’m giving you an opportunity to explain yourself. It’s your choice to play dumb.”
come to a stop outside a grand, towering building by the water, John gaped first at the building, and then at Sherlock.
Soo Lin inclined her head. “Out of necessity. I do not know for how long, but… yes.”
Anyway, see you soon (I promise!!!!) with the next chapter!!
go out doesn’t mean I
Sherlock sniffed. “Mm.”
“All set?” said Lestrade meaningfully, and Sherlock saw he’d already slid the cabbie’s body out.
“Greg?” said Sherlock blankly, as Lestrade hurried down the last couple steps and looked around at them both.
The older Holmes brother looked small behind his desk. “I would know how to protect him if you were.”
Sherlock was content, in a way, that he had just had to rationalize his thought process to John regarding keeping him alive past the critical sixty second time limit. He was anticipating having to do the same for Lestrade. It had been a healthy experience. An essential one. In a scientific setting, he would label it as establishing his biases and methodology. After all, rationalizing rational thoughts was rational.
Go back, or move forward.
Sherlock sat on every piece of furniture in the living room and sighed loudly.
Sherlock stalked to the front of the ambulance, and stopped.
Sherlock slouched in his seat. Honestly, as if this all wasn’t difficult enough… But there was no getting out of this now.
And what was going to happen to John, if everything fell apart in the coming days?
The second Shan’s fingertips brushed Sherlock’s hand, there was a flash of darkness, and Shan crumpled back to the floor, limp and lifeless once more.
“Oh, but it’s not just Moriarty,” said Moran. “Holmes too. You’ve been the center of everyone’s attention for the better part of three months.”
“Sir?” called a woman’s voice from outside the shop, and Sherlock recognized Donovan’s voice.
The second was that John was not asking him. Sherlock had offered to give John his life back, and he could see from the firm line in John's mouth, and the sharp look on his brow, and the way his lips were quirked at the corners in a frown, that John was resigned to being dead again. And he wasn't going to demand Sherlock carry through with keeping him alive. Wasn't even considering demanding he do so, Sherlock thought. John wasn't allowing himself to be hopeful. He was merely a little sad.
John snorted.
“… Like?”
John pulled the zipper down further, but now slowly, by millimeters, eyes fixed on the odd little packages that had were visibly strapped to his chest and to the inside of the jacket.
building over the last couple months.”
John bit his lip. His limited interactions with Moriarty—both through the earpiece and in person at the pool—had given John the lasting impression that Moriarty didn’t invest in people he didn’t think he could own, with enough persuasion. In another life, John might even have been one of them.
“But why did he call you?” said Lestrade. “If he was guilty…”
.” He aimed a finger (mimicking a gun) at Zhi Zhu and pantomimed firing it, with a matching sound for effect. “It seemed like a good idea a minute ago. I’m
“Good.” John nodded. He slid off the bed and gathered his notes in his arms. “We can move down to the kitchen. More room to spread out.”
He needed to get up.
Jim Moriarty gave him a wide grin from the driver’s seat.
Sherlock pocketed Moriarty’s note. “I’ll think about it.”
“Well?” prompted Sherlock impatiently.
His brother blinked in surprise. “Surely that would be ill-advised now, given how Moriarty had John abducted from there. And considering how well he anticipated our moves tonight.”
“Are you still annoyed about the whole me-being-missing thing?” said Sherlock.
“You’ll know in due course,” said Moran. “My part isn’t finished either, Holmes. Unlike dear little Doc Watson, I know my place in all of this. I’d still be in that little room if Moriarty didn’t still have a use for me. The fact that you and I are both free to stand here and have this little chat is proof that we still have parts to play. Everyone else…” Moran unlocked the safety on the gun, cocking it for emphasis. “No promises. So I’d keep them out of my way, if you want any of them to outlive you.”
Sherlock got out his phone and walked absently to the living room, sitting in his preferred chair by the window while John bustled about. John glanced at him with a curious expression—the speed with which Sherlock went from prying and scrutinizing to utterly disinterested was bizarre—as he went.
“Sherlock?” said John in confusion, starting after him. He could hear Sherlock moving around on the floor above, opening and closing doors with muffled thuds. “Sherlock?” he called again, but there still wasn’t an answer or even a pause in the noise.
“Mycroft doesn’t know about my Gift,” said Sherlock flatly. “He has no idea.”
—already. There was a purpose to everything Moriarty did. Everything was intended to send a message, or to make sure he got what he wanted. So every line in the message was calculated.
Lestrade pointed uncomfortably behind the ambulance, and Sherlock dropped to the ground and unsteadily walked around the side of the vehicle, one hand on the side for support. John followed behind, but somehow sensed that any objections he voiced now would be completely lost on Sherlock. He cast a bewildered look over his shoulder at Lestrade, but Lestrade was deliberately looking anywhere but at them.
Sherlock gave John a withering look. “Standing up to Moriarty. Trying to get me to leave right before Yao died. Being on my side after everything we’ve been through tonight? Would you like me to write up a list of your commendable actions?”
Sherlock shrugged. “The direction he went might be useful,” he said, pointing first to the bridge and then gesturing in from the river. “Though I didn’t see where he went after our brief conversation ended.”
“I know the risks,” said Soo Lin. Her expression was hard. “And I accept them. I am alone now, Mr. Holmes. Whatever happens now, it does not frighten me. And if I do nothing, I am dead anyway. No one leaves the Tong alive. That’s the last thing my brother said to me—and I think now I know he was right.”
John gaped at Sherlock.
The repair work on the upstairs flat had been completed in record time, with new panes of glass in the windows and the floors swept free of dust and debris. John went upstairs to check over everything with the last of the cleaners—who had apparently come in at the crack of dawn to finish their work—and thanked them profusely for their efforts. It was good that he did, as Sherlock’s interactions with them consistently solely of storming past them to the kitchen, where he started setting up a workspace on the counter.
“I know enough to get on with,” interrupted Mycroft. “More than you think I do. It is my job to know.”
noticed,” said Mycroft coldly. “You’ll be paying for it.”
John giggled feebly. “I was going to say something more along the lines of that was the craziest thing I’ve ever done.”
John smiled. “Good. I’m glad.”
Soo Lin’s bright, fierce, anxious eyes were suddenly overflowing. She sniffed, and nodded a third time.
“Okay,” said John, both surprised and not surprised Sherlock was willing to take the risk in asking Molly for help. “Right.”
The first puzzle was to show how long he had gone unnoticed.
“I know,” said Soo Lin. “That was not an accident. I was instructed to give you genuine information about the dish, regardless of what consequences that might have for Gruner. Though I did not hold him in very high regard, I admit. We were only ever distant business partners.”
“No,” Sherlock sighed. “Though I envy the rest of you for your ability to.”
“And we know the Black Lotus are amongst his spies now, even without Shan,” added Sherlock. “We know that at least some of them are out there, and at least some of them have assured him of their loyalties. If they don’t know Shan is dead, he might be posing as her in his communications with them. If they do know Shan is dead, then he was willing to pay high for their loyalties. Or it came cheap.”
“Completely wrong,” snarled Sherlock, temper rising past the point of control. “But thanks for reminding me that you don’t actually know me at all.”
At the mention of their landlady’s name, John’s already racing adrenaline picked up a little more. With luck, the lower level near her own apartment wouldn’t be too badly damaged, but she was older, would have no idea what had happened, and might be badly shaken.
“The cleaners scuffed my violin case,” said Sherlock soullessly.
Sherlock’s body had not fought him this much in a long time. He climbed the stairs as best he could, and as quietly as he could, but the effort felt nearly impossible.
“Admittedly, it can be a little stressful to be around at times,” said John. “You’re reckless, and sometimes you forget that the rest of us don’t know everything you know. But, I mean… I’m scared of Moriarty. I’m not scared of you.”
There was a gun on the floor by his feet, and a few dots of blood. But no body.
Mycroft let out a long sigh. “I know you don’t like this. But John agreed—“
But the voice interrupted, speaking at full volume once again. “Oh yes, it’s me. The one and only. Speaking to you live from an undisclosed location.”
Sherlock didn’t answer.
So, he’d kept his secret. Accidents and anomalies had brought people into his world, in the form of a bumbling police officer and a dead army doctor, but he had never chosen to bring people into his world. Before John, he had been alone. Now, the walls were crumbling.
Footsteps on the stairs behind Mrs. Hudson announced the arrival of Lestrade. Sherlock, remembering that he and John still had some sixty hours to go on their bet, resumed acting as John. He straightened and brushed biscuit crumbs off of his shirt. “Come on, John,” he said. “Straighten up—we can’t act like children if Lestrade is coming to beg for my—I mean, your—help. People will talk.”
Sherlock cut him off. “To what? Chucking a pillow at me is hardly a persuasive argument. I’ll kick you out if I have to. Technically, you have no legal rights here. You’re not an official tenant, you never signed a lease, you don’t pay rent—“
Sherlock was an instant goldmine.
“No. You don’t.”
I can do about that.” He took a deep breath, and continued, “I’m not… prepared. I have no way to handle this kind of threat. I don’t have the means to shield you from someone with the same abilities as mine. I don’t have a plan.”
He couldn’t think of a situation during a case when he’d been
John glanced at Hope. “Moriarty. The word he said was Moriarty.”
Three. Two—
~o~O~o~
John whipped around to see Sherlock Holmes seated at the kitchen table with his eyes fixed on a Bunsen burner apparatus producing a bright purple flame.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, but he stepped to the door and unlocked it. When he opened it, he found Mrs. Hudson passing through the entryway with a feather duster in one hand.
Mrs. Hudson intrepidly poked her head out of her own apartment, looking down the hall at the three of them. “Everything all right?”
“The window,” said Sherlock, sitting up a little straighter as he focused more closely on his memory of Soo Lin’s deserted hospital room. “It was open. She was injured, of course, but her window faced the back of the building, by the alley. She could have climbed out the window onto the fire escape and gone that way. She must have decided it was her best chance.”
. As in partially or incompletely. You can still die, I believe, by violent means, and perhaps even by sickness, but you won’t age, or at least certainly not in accordance with a typical timeframe. Now, I would like to discuss the matter of…”
“I’m perfectly fine, Mrs. Hudson,” said Sherlock, endeavoring to sound offhand, and he even stood up straight for effect. John had to applaud his bravado, even if it was somewhat pointless given his current condition.
In the kitchen, Sherlock watched his experiment—an ongoing, idle pastime aimed at producing flammable ink in various colors—until the last of the chemical was burned away. He wrote down a few notes in his scrawling handwriting in a small book, turned off the burner, and turned to look at John.
Sherlock held it up mutely, and John stepped closer to read the message. Written with black ink in a small, nondescript scrawl were a handful of words in the center of the page.
garage door than a nondescript open window in a distant hallway. Sherlock had decided on the window in the end because it was subtle and without an alarm.
Sherlock looked at Mycroft.
It took John another three seconds to process the order, and then he leapt out of his chair, dropping his notebook and sprinting upstairs. In precisely thirty-seven seconds, he was hurrying back into the living room, tugging on his jacket and shoving his new, barely-charged mobile phone into his trouser pocket.
Mycroft gave him a withering look. “You and I both know that this is a genuine photo of you. An original, and rather incriminating, photo of you.”
A thousand apologies for the unexpected delay between chapters! D: Starting grad school required a fair bit of schedule adjustment (also, geology as a whole is very fond of weekend-long trips into the wilderness to get covered in mud). I turned 22 and my birthday gift to myself was a thermodynamics midterm. I'm a professional at this time-management business...
BACK INTO THE FRAY
(The conversation had consisted largely of Sherlock objecting loudly every time John demanded that Sherlock have some kind of backup, and it had ended when Lestrade arrived at the flat bright and early the day after Mycroft’s visit and John admitted that he’d called the policeman to keep an eye on Sherlock long before the debate had even begun.)
Thank you all so much for reading! I apologize for being a day late (blame a weekend of truly miserable camping, catching a cold, and my birthday being tomorrow. Uh… so, chapter update = happy birthday to me, I don't suck too much at updates), but I hope I've made amends with the promise of an impending shouting match.
“I don’t think you should do it,” said Sherlock flatly, ignoring the resulting annoyed sigh from Mycroft.
‘Do not take second chances for granted'.
“It looks like there’s been an incident across the street,” replied John gently, absentmindedly checking her pulse. Fast, but that wasn’t surprising. “Sherlock’s in the hall. We’re going to step out to the front entryway for when the police get here, all right?”
“Should be,” said Sherlock. “I’m willing to bet Moriarty will be monitoring for any sort of response from me. This is the most obvious line of communication from me to him. Unless he wants to give me his number.”
“It’s more than that.”
Moriarty reached out and touched Yao’s bloodied face. There was a flash of darkness, and then Zhi Zhu collapsed once more, a heap on the ground.
Sherlock had the grace to look uncomfortable, but John could tell it was only because Lestrade had hit the nail on the head. “I find empty compliments yield results. Is that so wrong?”

The only reason his death won’t have been for nothing is because of Sherlock. Defending him now, regardless of the cost, seems right. It

John sighed. “Do you have a problem with me having a gun?” he asked, just as the man he’d just disarmed groaned loudly behind them.
. I think I would know.”
Dead John.
driver, so you could have
When Sherlock didn’t move, John said, “Trust me. I wouldn’t be here unless I knew the risks and didn’t think much of them. I told you I can help. So let me help.”
“Good try, Mr. Holmes,” she said, voice clipped. “But you have nothing.”
“What?” said a dazed Lestrade, looking up at the house.
“So…” said Sherlock slowly, not sure how to start. “Considering who you work for, I hope you understand why I’m a little – surprised, that you’re here right now. Unless you’re here to deliver a message, in which case I’m not sure why all the secrecy.”
“I – thank you,” said Sherlock.
Moriarty slapped himself lightly on one wrist. “You’ve got me. I’ve been a very naughty boy.” He shrugged, exaggerating the movement of his shoulders until it was bordering on comical. “Really, I’m just a specialist, you see… like you!”
Moriarty rolled his eyes, and said, “Darling, don’t play dumb. How did you acquire an army doctor who by all accounts is supposed to be dead,
“Precisely,” said Sherlock. “So that’s what we do. We take Gruner down, and we’ll have solved the puzzle. And maybe he’ll have some poignant information to share with us down the road.”
Mrs. Hudson had already stepped back, and Mycroft had come forward to stand in the threshold.
John got to his feet slowly, unexpectedly unsteady. His arms and legs were stiff and felt abnormally heavy and unresponsive. He was wearing a thick, hooded coat, zipped all the way to his neck.
John was standing on Shan’s other side. He crouched down, actively avoiding looking directly at Shan. “Don’t overthink it. At least not yet.”
Lestrade joined John in the doorway, and together they listened for the telltale sound of the front door opening and closing.
No one did, of course.
“I was thinking more about the emotional implications than the mathematical ones,” said John.
“For me,” said Moriarty. “
It had been like this at the Lucky Cat as well. The Soldier had been called to the front.
“Maybe. Maybe not,” said Moriarty carelessly. “I could have done what you’ve done. I could have fed him any story or any promise to buy his cooperation. He might be attached to you like a good little dog, as the great savior who brought him back to life after his untimely death, but it’s all a matter of perception. All a matter of perspective. Don’t act so noble when you brought him back to life purely so you could get whatever information you wanted. I’m sure that’s why you brought him back, isn’t it? For sixty seconds of questions. I’d be shocked if it was for his personal benefit. I’m sure he shared his story with you once you brought him back, no questions asked. People do that when they’re dead. He could just as easily have been sharing his story with me, had our timing been a little different.”
They sat in silence for a moment, taking it all in.
Sherlock gave Mycroft a cold look. “I assume there’s a point to that statement. I suggest you get to it quickly.”
He was sure of this, but he was far from sure why this was so. John didn’t owe him anything, and he was confident John knew that. The cabbie’s death as a result of John remaining alive longer than a minute—and the responsibility John had felt for it—seemed, in Sherlock’s mind, to negate any sense of debt between them for Sherlock’s bringing John back to life. Beyond that, John had been the one who’d rescued Sherlock from the Lucky Cat, so Sherlock, in all likelihood, owed him. So it wasn’t caring out of necessity or obligation. And he was confident it was genuine. Like everything else with John had been so far.
“I’ll keep an eye out,” Mrs. Hudson offered kindly. She returned to her cleaning, and John started up the stairs to the flat, shoulders slumped.
and stop with the ‘hours and days of unexplained silence’ thing, and I’ll make sure not to overreact. Calm and collected. Deal?”
“Something out of place,” finished Mycroft.
John rolled his eyes. “Sherlock, I know this might be hard for you to believe, but some of us don’t like being involved with psychopaths. I’ve already died once.”
~Becca
With one last nod, Molly turned and hurried away down the hall in the opposite direction from Sherlock.
“I’m so sorry,” he said quietly.
Mycroft rolled his eyes, and picked up the photo of John from the morgue, tossing it at Sherlock. “Then do me a favour and start with this one.”
to be sidetracked for some pointless little simple problem your team of lackwits can’t be bothered to figure out.”
Hello sexy.
“No?” said John. “You’re not licensed to carry. And isn’t Lestrade going to be there? So you
John nodded. “Can you breathe deeply?”
Sherlock glanced at John out of the corner of his eyes. “You look significantly less upset, compared to this morning.”
. My biggest problem is keeping you in one piece.”
The third was that Sherlock could not make his hand move any closer to John than it already was. He couldn't bring himself to do it. The minute had passed, and there was nothing Sherlock could do to take that back. But it was with a swoop of terror and disbelief that he realized he did not want to. He did not want to take it back, as if this meant nothing. As if this was no more significant than any of the other cases in which the time had not run out.
“I take back those condolences.”
Sherlock glanced down at John’s hand on his arm, careful not to move. “Alone, I think,” he said after a pause, with a very small and incredibly sad smile. “But I appreciate the offer.”
John blinked. “…
Lestrade turned around (he didn’t get paid enough for this magic shit, he really didn’t) as Sherlock slowly stepped forward, and crouched down at Shan’s side. His legs, still weak and stiff from his recent kidnapping ordeal, protested, and he shut those complaints down. This was what mattered.
“Because, like an idiot, you ate an entire package of ginger nuts about two minutes after I called to order takeaway. You can run through things again while I’m eating.”
Sherlock couldn’t.
“You’re forgetting I can’t use that,” Sherlock reminded him. “That requires being able to prove Moriarty’s existence, and the Black Lotus’ as well. But…” Sherlock picked up the pen again, scribbled ‘BLACKMAIL’ on the page, and circled it a few times, with a line connecting the word to Gruner. “We
And she was—unless he was very mistaken—a member of the Black Lotus.
Sherlock sniffed. “So. A genius desperate enough to become a serial killer and smart enough to disguise the deaths.”
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
John dreamed about cabs driving bodies across the Dashti Margo.
“Don’t think too much of it; I do that for everyone,” said Sherlock absently.
“You know I’m not,” said Sherlock.
“Sherlock called a few hours ago and told me to get over here,” Lestrade explained. “He just said you’d gone and he wanted someone here in case the Black Lotus tried to enter the house.”
job,” he said slowly.
“Guess you’re right,” conceded John. He felt somewhat guilty about it, but—if this really was happening—it seemed like the reasonable course to take until he (and Sherlock) could come up with a comprehensive plan. No point in placing anyone in a difficult position until they had to. Especially if it could cost someone their safety. “Better wait to do anything until the news dies down anyway. I did only just die.”
~o~O~o~
chose to be useful to a psychopath.
“I really do think it was a window.”
Mycroft nodded sagely. “Just saving you the trouble, which can serve as my apology.”
“Give what a go?”
John was—he had been horrified and immediately yelled at Sherlock. Mycroft, John thought, had been mildly disgusted. And unnerved. Moriarty had nearly blown him up.
“It’s an experiment,” said John, fighting to keep his face straight.
"This will only take a minute," said Sherlock.
John grimaced. “Ah.”
Sherlock paused, and looked the woman up and down. She was slight, fairly young, and of Chinese descent. Born in China, Sherlock thought, judging by her accent. Her face was devoid of any blatant emotion, but her body language was immediately interesting. The concave bend in her shoulders and the slightly lowered chin suggested anxiety, while her hands clasped tightly in front of her and her constant eye contact hinted at determination. Soft lines in her face, barely noticeable to anyone who wasn’t actively looking for them, indicated that she’d had more than her fair share of strain in her lifetime—a life full of difficulties, even though she was young. No ring meant most likely not married. Something about her made Sherlock think that, more specifically, she was single with no children. She was dressed in a long silk dress, with a dark overcoat wrapped around her shoulders. Delicate fingers with immaculate fingernails, and yet old callouses all over her hands. So, she’d done hard work and lived rough, but much less so in the last… two years? Artist? No—but someone who works with art? Thoughtful and artistic appearance, but not as eclectic as he might expect an artist to be, and none of the telltale finger calluses that artists and writers had holding the tools of their trade. Art historian, maybe. Bit of a deductive leap, but Sherlock was inclined to think he wasn’t wrong in making it.
“Honestly? No. But we’ll know soon enough,” Sherlock replied. “His initial hearing starts this week. Maybe he’ll be willing to make a deal. In any case, there’s plenty to do between watching the museum, watching the flat, organizing our support teams, learning the code that the Black Lotus use, talking to Gruner, and trying not to get killed in the meantime. Soo Lin isn’t doing this alone.”
“Um, no,” John scoffed. “No, I wouldn’t. You’re the one who breaks into houses and marauds around to solve murders. I stand outside and tell you what a prat you are.”
“Civil?” repeated Sherlock, voice taking on a tone of bitter amusement. “You’re going to give me lessons in etiquette? This from the man who has no qualms about casually spying on everyone else just for the sake of being a di—“
“You don’t think it prudent to move somewhere more secure?” asked Mycroft pointedly.
“You know what,” said John, sitting back in his chair. “Let’s just make this difficult.”
He’d known this was a possibility.
Even as a child, Sherlock could see how dangerous it would be, to be close to people, to love them too much to let them go, and to have the power to bring them back.
Sherlock had been without a case for several days at this point and by now had reached a neurotic level of twitchiness.
“John seems to have recovered from the shock of meeting Moran,” said Mycroft, a little too casually.
Sherlock just couldn’t fathom why.
Still, Lestrade wasn't an idiot. He wasn't sold right away.
(I think this is going to become a trend…)
~o~O~o~
“His name is Lestrade.”
He was supposed to hide his identity, especially from people who would see through his name. When Lestrade had realized who John was—had realized
“That’s so… pointlessly optimistic,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock waited, stunned. “… He contacted MI5, didn’t he.”
“Not that it does much to balance out how much trouble it’s caused, but yes, if you want to pointlessly try for some optimism on the subject of Moriarty,” Mycroft replied, with just a hint of sarcasm. They finally stopped outside a room, and Mycroft opened it to reveal an office with an array of video feeds. He ushered Sherlock and John inside. “As I said earlier, the current plan is to keep him here until we’ve established his identity, and then he’ll be charged and subsequently transferred somewhere more secure,” he continued. “We have a few rooms here used for… let’s call it ‘pointed questioning’—“
“I understand perfectly well that this… ability is beyond his control,” said Mycroft.
, he’d said.
Sherlock kicked a pebble on the sidewalk with particular vehemence and forced himself to move on to other thoughts.
Sherlock swallowed. “I didn’t kill—I didn’t actively kill. I’m not a killer.”
At last, he gave up, and went to bed, leaving Sherlock exactly as he’d been all night, watching the phone expectantly, as it sat there, silent, answerless.
Sherlock snatched the envelope out of Lestrade’s hand. “Is that going to be a thing now? I thought you were supposed to be the mature one.”
“… No, no, you know, I really don’t,” said Sherlock. “You’ll have to excuse me if the prospect of dealing with more of you doesn’t thrill me.”
“No, of course not,” said John, still smiling. “I think I fancy a cup of tea anyway. You?”
