Instead of answering Sherlock asks a question of his own. "Why did you come back?" John's eyes widen in disbelief at Sherlock's words.
John draws in a shaky breath and breathes out, "You're right. Of course you're right. You've always been able to see through me."
As he begins searching for his ex-wife, he rounds a corner and a bullet instantly rushes past his ear, barely missing. He quickly ducks back behind the wall, waits a moment, twists his body just enough for a clean shot, and then fires before ducking back behind the wall once more. There is a groan of pain and then a thud before silence falls. He peeks around the wall to find the other man lying on the floor. He checks the body and discovers that the assassin is dead. He continues onward, collecting the other man’s rifle in the process.
John stares at Sherlock’s curled up body sitting rigidly clutching tightly to John’s signature Union Jack pillow. For once, the blogger stares at the obviously miserable detective and actually
Sherlock thinks with a smirk), and the overly dramatic actors, the show didn't have much going for it. The only thing Sherlock found the least bit entertaining would be the horrid acting. The way the leading actress threw herself at any man with male genitalia was quite hilarious. Sherlock gets the opportunity he was hoping for when the ditzy blonde woman, who was pregnant with the leading man's child and was cheating on her current boyfriend, gets proposed to her by said idiotic boyfriend.
Greg soon finds the pair and drags them back to the booth in order to enjoy a round of pints. The soon to be wedded couple sit closely together, breathing the other’s air, and basking in the ability to be close. Whispered sentiments from the connected pair reach the D.I.’s ears and when Lestrade realizes that he won’t be heard in his attempts to initiate small talk, he smiles fondly and says something along the lines of retrieving more pints.
I have some paralles going on here that I meant to make more obvious than I had originally wrote them out to be. My lovely beta caught that and fixed it for me. So, as always, thank you, QueenLadyAnne.
She has lied to me from the moment we met. More importantly, she shot you!” The blogger sees red as the Consulting Detective snorts and waves his hand in dismissal at John’s words, but the former blogger soldiers on, “Plus, did you forget ‘has trust issues?’ And how can you act nonchalantly about the fact that she shot and murdered you? How on Earth could you possibly forgive her?”
However, in 1991, Dr. Goode received unofficial funding by means of anonymous donations to begin working on a new device that would help with this problem. Dr. Goode released the Pathos Eradicator on November 28th, 1994, which came at a seemingly opportune time. The demand for artificial emotions became so high that supply could not keep up with it. When word of the Pathos Eradicator was released, company officials played off the machine as a gift from the gods. This machine would solve the emotion shortage for the people who needed them, donators would be servicing the needs of mankind, and Dr. Goode promised that there would be no lasting side effects. It seemed to be a win-win for everyone involved.
"John Watson had always known he was intended to have a soul mate. He was one of the few very fortunate children that had their red threads at an early age. Everyone in his family knew that he was a special child. Unlike most children, John’s thread was a crimson, fiery red that burned intently and endlessly."
Mary and John don’t talk about it. She leaves him to his thoughts and doesn’t say a word when he rises early the next morning to go to Baker Street to yell at the infuriating man some more. However, when he arrives at his old flat, he is met with the sight of Sherlock and Janine kissing
The distressed amateur detective begins pacing and his words are rushed as he frantically lists out his worries to his older brother, “Myc, what if he changes his mind? What if he decides he doesn’t want to get married anymore?” Here he turns pained eyes, wide with fear, on the British government.
With a irritated huff, the consulting detective turns, sits up, and glares up at John. "Why does what we have need a label? Why can't we just be and forget about the rest? I...care about you, and I believe you care about me. Why not just let it be?"
After a moment of thought John declares, “You’re absolutely right. There is no contest.” Although when the blogger had spoken these words, his soulmate flinches, visibly places an uncaring mask upon his angular face, and forcibly refuses to meet John’s gaze before quietly saying, “I understand.”
He takes several silent steps forward until he is directly in front of the detective before speaking in undisguised affection, “You know, to be a genius, you really are an idiot.”
“How are you feeling?” came the sleep-filled voice of the stirring blogger. An irritated huff comes from Sherlock’s direction before he eventually answers with a reluctant “I’m fine.” The blogger then proceeds to stand and stretch his cramped muscles which are due to sleeping in such an uncomfortable position for so long. When John has settled down once again, all sleep seems to be devoid from his eyes and Sherlock knows now that the discussion will be had.
chose you! It’s always been he and I against the rest of the world, and it’s going to stay that way, and if you touch one hair on his head, I will spend the rest of my days making sure you will pay.”
Thousands of thoughts raced through the blond man’s head as he drew closer to the hospital. ‘God, I hope he’s alright,’ seemed to be playing on a constant loop in the blogger’s mind. John sat rigidly on the edge of his seat watching as the hospital grew closer and closer as he anxiously waited to leave the confining vehicle. When the cab finally pulled up to St. Mary’s hospital, John threw the money at the cabdriver and raced inside the building. From there, he asked the nurses were Sherlock was located and he was then directed to a waiting room. It was there that he came face to face with Mycroft Holmes.
“Oh dear God. Look at the poor man. You didn't actually think I was interested in you, did you? Why, because you're Sherlock Holmes, the clever detective in the funny hat?”  Irene says with a self-satisfied smirk that is painted upon her red lips.
.” She takes the syringe with the clear liquid and brandishes it for Sherlock to see as she continues, “Now, let’s take a nice nap as I call your precious John.”
When John was five, like many young little boys, curiously questioned the threads existence. “Why is it there? What is if for? Can I get tangled up in it if I trip?” His parents answered each question with a laugh and loving smile. His mother looked into his father’s eyes and placed her hand on top of his. John noticed that the red thread connected them together. “The threads may tangle, they can knot, and they can twist, but they never break. With time.” His mother continued “When your mate dies, the thread disappears but the love never leaves. You will always be connected to that person.”
At the age of twenty-three, he was still without a soul mate, he was introduced to cocaine. He, at first, told himself that he was using it to ‘quieten his racing mind’. If he would look within himself he would discover that he was only lying to himself. There were the nights when being so alone left him feeling so hollow inside. There were nights when he truly hated himself more than anything or anyone. Those nights he would tighten the tourniquet, inject the needle into his arm, and push the plunger until he could finally get rid of the emptiness he felt. This routine would continue for three months until Mycroft stepped in, after Sherlock overdosed, one September night.
"I need an ambulance at 221B Baker Street at once! My friend is hurt and needs medical attention at once!" He waits, listens to the reply from the reassuring dispatcher that promises a quick arrival, and responds with a choked out, "Hurry!"

“I’ll never get tired of hearing that.” John smiles briefly before diverting his eyes to ask, “Oh, by the way, do you have anything on today?” The detective tilts his head in consideration before saying, “No. I don’t think so. There are no cases on, the wedding details have been finalized, and I have no experiments in a critical state at this time.” Sherlock’s eyes narrow slightly, “Why?”
John jumps, having not realized that the amateur detective had awoken, and spins to stare at the younger man through the room’s window. There Sherlock sat, every bit as disgruntled as John can remember, and pouts at his older brother, “Mycroft, why the hell am I still here?” The British Government genuinely smiles at his younger brother and says, “Surely you remember what you did to get here, brother mine.” Sherlock’s pout deepens, “I was perfectly fine! Shouldn’t you be out overthrowing a country, or something?” He pauses for a moment before his face turns into a fierce scowl. Knowing that he will not like the answer, Sherlock sarcastically questions, “So, how long will I have to stay?” Mycroft allows one more soft smile before he goes back to his cool demeanor, “Three days, but I will pull some strings and I will get you out sooner; however, I still want to keep you under surveillance.” Sherlock snorts, “As if you’ve ever stopped.” Mycroft gives him a pointed look and continues, “Now, you have two options. Either you come and stay with me for awhile,” at Sherlock’s immediate rejection, the elder Holmes pauses until Sherlock stops grousing and then continues, “Or, you can agree to allow a trained medical practitioner to watch over you.” Sherlock snorts, “As if there is any guess which I will pick. I’ll take the nurse, please.”

Sherlock, during Lestrade's retelling of facts, analyzes each photo before walking over to the four mourning family members, 'father, two sisters, and a brother,' inspecting each in turn, before turning to Greg, " The latest victim, Brianna ,was an artist. Her right sleeve is lightly coated with graphite. The graphite was picked up when she swiped her hand across the paper to remove the eraser shavings. Her mother Christina was a surgeon, the photos show her degrees. Little Samantha was a musical prodigy. She played the violin, which I know based upon the rosin on her right sleeve. What do each of these unique individuals have in common, besides being related?"

They stand before each other in the dimly lit room almost completely nude when John draws Sherlock into a sweet kiss. Hands began to roam and John pushes Sherlock down onto the bed and crawls on top of him and resumes the previous kiss with more passion. John slowly traces the seem of Sherlock's lips and is granted access into the warm, wet cavern. They are pressed together from head to toe with ever point in contact. Sherlock could feel John's interest hard against his inner thigh but John realizes that he wasn't the only one with a growing problem.
Sherlock's room was at the end of the long corridor, room number 354. John was about to enter when Mycroft grabbed his arm. "John. There are some things I feel you need to be made aware of." When Mycroft had John's undivided attention, he continued, "When Sherlock was younger he had more than one addiction than you know of." John's brow furrowed in confusion and worry as he asks, "What do you mean?" Mycroft's grim expression told John enough and he entered the room.
why they’re here.  “No,” Sherlock plainly states as he goes back to sit beside his confused threadmate.
feel the same way, then they don’t need to waste any more time. He’s not getting any younger and Sherlock is just beginning to grey around his temples. They can’t keep living this way, balanced on the edge of something
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the chapter! Hopefully we'll have the next one out for you saturday! My beta and I have different timezones, so it get's a little complicated. :p Anyway! Happy reading!
Sherlock sat for a moment but shook his head furiously, "No, that won't do, John and I visit Angelo's regularly. I want this to be special." Mycroft looks at his younger brother before saying, "This actually means something to you. Why do you care so much? You've never gotten involved with this sort of thing before."
Special Thanks: QueenLadyAnne, my lovely Beta, who keeps reassuring me and giving me wonderful advice!
. Admittedly, he could not hear anything beyond John’s retreating footsteps and the closing door before his mind unhelpfully started screaming at him, ‘
Off to other things. Happy belated, belated Valentine's Day! I hope you enjoy this chapter! As always happy reading!!
John can hear his approaching fellow troops, but he couldn’t possibly care at this point. John no longer has his life preserver. His thread was like a promise, no matter what hell he had to go through, no matter what pain or suffering or injury he obtained while deployed, he had been promised happiness. Now, he no longer has anything. His hope has been crushed and he couldn’t care at this moment if he were to live or die.
Honestly, I'm not entirely sure about this chapter. I always wanted Mary to be shot by John. That was so important to me. I wanted that to be the ultimate "I pick you," moments. I hope that was conveyed. I had a certain amount of enjoyment while writing this chapter. I hope you do too. As always, happy reading!
When the door finally opens, Lestrade come barreling in with a seemingly, newfound energy as he boisterously proclaims, “So, chaps, I hope you’re ready for a night out because I plan to give you a night to remember!” Lestrade’s energetic smile quickly becomes contagious as it spreads to John’s face. The loyal blogger looks up at his threadmate and joyfully declares, “Allons-y!”
With two perfectly made teas in each hand, he takes both mugs out of the kitchen and into the living room in which he sets Sherlock's on the coffee table in front of him and gently helps the consulting detective up. When that has been accomplished, John sits in his own chair and sips his tea. Two sets of eyes gaze into the other, in a silent inquiry of 'Now what?'

I know I’ve screwed up, but I love him. I just want to make it right.” The elder man sneers at the word. “
"The Victim's name is Brianna Andrews, age 22. Her sister Alicia found her." Greg points her out then says, "The previous victims are members of her family. Mother Christina Andrews, age 43." Lestrade pauses briefly in his update to hand over pictures of each deceased member to Sherlock before continuing, "And sister Samantha Andrews, age 15. All Victims have had the same treatment. Neck sliced, right hand decapitated, then eyes gouged. We think these traits are part of the serial killer's M.O."
Greg audibly swallows and continues a little choked up, “I want to thank you, John. I’ve worried for years about this wanker because he deserved love just like everyone else and now, I can finally stop because he has you and I know you will take care of each other.” the D.I. raises his glass, “To Sherlock and John. I hope you have many long years of playful bickering, late night crime scenes, and years of protecting each other like you always do. Congratulations you two.”
He nods gratefully, takes the medicine, and picks up the squirming toddler demanding his attention by punctuating each waving fist with an insistent, “ Up! Up! Up!” He smiles down at this beautiful little girl as he takes her from a smiling Mrs. Hudson. He gently shushes her as she squeals out peals of laughter as she smacks his face with her chubby, little fingers. He gently reprimands her by explaining that daddy is asleep right now and that they would need to be very quiet in order for John to get some much needed rest. She only giggles softly and nods as if she understands completely as she puts a small finger against his lips and says, “Shhh.”
"The place does not matter. It's the sentiment behind it. Is there anywhere you can think of that has some significant value?" With the eldest Holmes words, Sherlock's eyes widen and he jumps up racing around the room gathering his coat and scarf. He then turns to the British government and says, "I've got the place! I'll need your help getting everything in order...will you….I mean…. would you want to-"
When Sherlock falls silent, John takes a moment to compose himself. He slowly lifts his head from his shaking hands and stares pointedly at Sherlock. John lets out a shaky breath and whispers,"I would like to know what the hell you were thinking.""
Sherlock snorts again and mumbles, "No, just...marriage." John blinks up Sherlock when continues, "A wedding is, in my considered opinion, nothing short of a celebration of all that is false and specious and irrational and sentimental in this ailing and morally compromised world."
be. It was like a warm hello after years of being apart. It’s like the start of a grand adventure, and this is a fond beginning.
, unable to do anything as he watched the love of his life, crumble to the ground. He watched as Sherlock, with a sickening thud, lay bloody and broken at the steps of St. Barts. It took only a moment before John was running to Sherlock's side. When he was only a fourth of the way from his broken detective, a cyclist crashed into him sending him tumbling to the cold pavement.
Sherlock then gets down on one knee and produces a small black box out of his suit pocket. “So, would you give me the honor of becoming my husband?
On to the actual notes (I promise not to make them terrible long ^_^;), First of all, you may be thinking, "HOW CAN YOU KILL OFF HARRY?! SHE'S STILL IN THE STORIES!" Well, she furthers the plot later on, she's not very, terribly important to this story other than the fact she furthers plot. Secondly, goodness, I've hurt John a lot this chapter. It's not going to get better for awhile. Last but not least, fun fact, I got the dates (I just googled when their birthdays are. Sherlock's birthday is actually celebrated by fans on the 6th of January--happy belated birthday to my favorite cinnamon roll--John's birthday I got from google) and the character's parents name come from their actual parents.
Mary finally brings her body in contact with the detective and begins caressing his pale neck and chest while kissing his ebony curls. John steps forward, Sig poised as he clearly senses the threat now, but stops as one hand tilts the syringe against Sherlock’s inner elbow and states, “First of all, no baby.” She looks up at John then, smiles darkly, rolls her eyes, and states, “And secondly, I’ve already explained all this to him. I’m not going to go through it all again.
For the second time that evening, Sherlock begins to hide behind an uncaring mask until John gently reaches out and grabs the detective’s wrist and quietly pleads, “No, please, Sherlock. Don’t do that. Don’t hide from me. I know that’s what you are doing. I understand now.” To John’s relief the mask slips away and John receives a brief look into what Sherlock is truly feeling. For a moment, John can see all the fear and sadness behind the cold exterior, the heart behind the machine. For once, Sherlock drops the act and looks utterly miserable.
The day was filled with all of Sherlock’s favorite things. John had called Molly ahead of time to procure an entire corpse for Sherlock’s experiments; he only had to pick it up later. When John told Sherlock this, his entire face lit up with excitement. He had so many experiments in mind for the decaying body. Next, they stopped by New Scotland Yard to pick up all the interesting cold case files. Due to Lestrade’s absence, Ms. Donavan spat freak whenever she was in earshot of the connected pair.  Just as John decided to say something to the hateful woman, Sherlock smiles at his threadmate, gives him a look that says, ‘
"Our patient, Mr. Holmes, has attained a minor, closed head injury to the left side of his head. We have ran a CT and everything appears to be normal. We want to keep him overnight though, for observation." When the Doctor has finished speaking, John lets out an obvious sigh of relief and Mycroft seems to have lost the stiffness in his shoulders. "We will see him now." It wasn't a question, but the doctor still nodded at Mycroft's demand. "Right this way."
Sherlock smiles broadens and again captures his threadmate’s lips with his own. Sherlock’s voice get’s impossibly deeper as he says,“ You know, John, tomorrow we’ll be married.” John, who was half hard already, quickly hardens completely when these words are spoken. The amateur detective then quickly trails searing kisses to his cheek, down to his neck, across his chest (taking the time to kiss, lick, and suck at John’s nipples resulting in an answering gasp and moan from the aroused blogger). “I keep thinking about being yours forever and the fact that you’ll be mine.” The kisses continue down his abdomen and then the detective places sucking kisses on John’s hipbones. “Will you take me, John?” Sherlock places lingering kisses against John’s straining erection through the cotton, red pants, “Will you make love to me?”

If Mycroft hadn't seen Sherlock's depreciated demeanor he would have accused Sherlock of trying to deceive him, but here before him was the once proud consulting detective finally learning to bare his heart and let others in. Mycroft might have been known as the iceman but his heart was not cold and unused. He would never tease his younger brother when he knew it was something truly important to him.
When Sherlock turned 16 he knew something was wrong with him. The other children would taunt him endlessly. "
that I was right. I had read so much meta and watched so many videos on the topic, taht it was only solidifed for me. I thought that's where the story was heading for season 4 and that's why I posted what I did in chapter 1 (2?). I wanted to have bragging rights (in a sense) for calling it. Haha... That's not where season 4 went. I am still very salty about it. I hate Mary. I despise her. If you meet me in person, I will tell you how much I hate her for all the shit she did. I can talk about it for hours and I become infuriated. It's bad. I still despise the fact that they tried to redeem her. You don't know how much it PAINED me to write Mary as a nice, sweet lady. She is not. She is awful.
Sherlock’s face contorts into brief embarrassment from revealing so much to the other man. As he stutters out a reply he blushes under Mycroft’s uncharacteristic caring expression: “Um…Thank you… That thing you did was… um… good.” The care finally leaves from Mycroft’s face as a natural air settles along his facial expression. However, the British government can’t help but fondly squeeze his brother’s arm as he says, “Anytime, brother.”
When John was sent back home from the army, threadless and hopeless, he thought that life was over. He was depressed and if he hadn’t ran into Mike Stamford, he would have ended it all. Life with his eccentric detective is exciting and worthwhile. ‘No, my life is not over,’ he thinks with a smile and another kiss against the sleuth’s forehead, ‘my life has only just begun.’
, a machine. Sebastian’s right. You have to put up with a grown man who frequently acts like a child. It’s more than anyone should have to bear. I’m not good enough. You are good, decent, and kind. I will never be enough, John.”
“Honey! You’ll find...him someday! You’re young now, give it time!” John blinks up at his mother’s words and whispers, “You promise?”
When both men are naked, Sherlock climbs back onto the bed and lays, on his side facing his soulmate. John turns to his side and places a warm hand on Sherlock's hip in which he uses to draw the irresistible detective in for another passionate kiss. Both men gasp when warm skin touches warm skin. The clever army doctor hand slowly reaches down to the sleuth's aching member and slowly pumps up and down, using his precome to slicken the way. The detective's eyes flutter closed and, with a sinful moan, he thrusts his hips in time with John's smooth stokes.
'He says instead though, "I doubt I'd ever get married. The promise of forever is just a delusional attempt to strengthen a promise that many individuals do not intend to keep."

Notes: I am doing better at making them longer! :D I'm trying guys! The next Chapter will be very brutal and gory. The Johnlock warning is unlikely now to go up, but, it's still a possibility and I don't want to take it down until I'm finished. I'm thinking three to four chapters left (maybe less). This story is coming to a close! I hope you all like this chapter! Again, this next chapter will be VERY angsty. Just a warning. But not to worry loves! I enjoy happy endings and I am a sentimental fool sometimes :).
That mirrored hope gives him the courage to finally fucking talk to the other man, “What I mean, Sherlock, is that I want to grow old with you.” He pauses briefly to stifle the last of his reservations before continuing, “What I’m trying to say is that I am in love with you. Have been for years now.”
The older man finds peace in his decision and his smile only grows as he carefully tucks a curl behind Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock’s eyes widen, but before he can ask what exactly is going on, John states, “I don’t want to place any child in position to become accustomed to constant anger and spewed hatred. As for Mary, I can’t continue to live there. I can barely stand to look at her and I can’t stand what she’s done to you. She and I will be talking quite a bit tomorrow about our relationship or the lack there of.”
This, I tried to do research on on cocaine usage and blood loss, but it was pretty uninformative. I don't do drugs and I have never bled enough to pass out. I don't know how to be high. Sorry, everyone if it is inaccurate. I'm always open to suggestions, so if you have it, let me know! 'Cause I clearly don't know. I do know that when using Cocaine, from my research, that a high doesn't last long. It said it last from about 30 minutes to an hour.
As always, thank you to QueenLadyAnne, CCwritessometimes, and Hateya W. These lovely betas all work with me to make this story into something I believe is special. Also, special thank you Ariane DeVere (I'm just going to make a tag for this wonderful person, because I use their blog so often).
Instead of answering John sits up slightly and reaches for Sherlock's marred arm and tenderly begins kissing each disfigured mark. Sherlock's eyes widen as he realizes that, 'This is his way of forgiving me.' When John had finished with that arm he goes on to the next, repeating the process until his lips travel upward, across his chest, up the side of his neck and finally makes a stop on full cupid-bowed lips. After several loving kisses are shared John draws back until he can look into bright eyes and he can whisper, "I know, love." With a final kiss, they lay facing each other with only an inch separating the two. Before sleep can claim either party, Sherlock quietly whispers, "Thank you John. I love you."
Sherlock draws the repentant blogger into a warm embrace and then rests his head on golden-grey hair, “You will never lose me. I understand what you were trying to do, and all is forgiven, but you must realize that
"Sherlock! Can you hear me?! You are going to be alright! The ambulance is coming and will be here shortly love! You're going to be just fine!" John wasn't too sure if he was trying to reassure the unconscious detective or himself. When the ambulance had arrived and he was again waiting in the waiting room, he anxiously sat awaiting the doctor's diagnosis. '
Sherlock had always been a quick study and soon he was copying the slow pace John had set. When Sherlock's movements became more confident, John slowly sucked and nibbled on his full lower lip. Sherlock gasps in surprise and John is granted access.
Another wave of guilt envelops John as he blinks back tears, “I understand, love. I want you to understand something too…you will never, and I mean NEVER, lose me. I will always love you. That will never change. You’re stuck with me, I’m afraid.” Sherlock nods, smiles, and places a loving kiss on his threadmate’s head.
Mycroft now understands. His heart, that he was often told was inexistent, twinges painfully for his little brother as he remembers a younger Sherlock, barely the age of 8, tearfully question what was wrong with him, and why he didn’t have a red thread of his own. Perhaps that is why Mycroft stands and gently grabs Sherlock’s arm to comfort his little brother. The British government speaks softly as he says, “Brother mine, John loves you. He has loved you for a long time. I have seen it before you fell and every day after. Tomorrow, you will get married and he
"I need an ambulance at 221B Baker Street at once! My friend is hurt and needs medical attention at once!" He waits, listens to the reply from the reassuring dispatcher that promises a quick arrival, and responds with a choked out, "Hurry!"
Sherlock stared at the other man for what seemed like an eternity, searching for any deceit or falsehood, before he slowly reached out with elegant digits to grasp John’s smaller, sturdier hand, “You mean that?” The army blogger hesitantly smiles and says, “Of course I do. Every word.” Verdigris eyes gaze into deep blue as a delicate, pale thumb gently traces worn and battered knuckles.
John's face has taken on that blank, emotionless mask he has perfected these last two years. "Why didn't you come back when the snipers had been taken care of?"
The next morning, the sun shown lazily through the windows in Sherlock’s bedroom. After a long and emotionally taxing day, the two lovers fell into bed in an exhausted heap, but not before a loving kiss and whispered endearments. Now as the sun shines on John’s face, he blinks awake slowly. A besotted, happy grin spreads across his face as he takes in Sherlock’s relaxed and peaceful features.
synthetic happiness. She would burst into tears at the thought of going without it, but eventually, Harriet got better. She was more of herself than she had been in years, albeit a bit more depressed than before, but that was nothing Clara couldn’t handle. Clara was ecstatic about gaining her wife back. The alcohol and synthetic drugs put such a heavy strain on their marriage, but now things were finally looking up. When John’s two weeks leave finally ended, both Clara and the younger Watson felt confident in Harriet’s recovery. They knew the road ahead would be a hard one, for everyone involved, but with love and support, they could succeed.

Having lost any remaining fight in her, Clara collapses against John’s hospital bed. The injured man quickly sits up and envelops her the best way he can with his uninjured arm. Both stay silent as they grieve the loss of their cherished loved one.
. Look how pathetic he is! The only man he has ever "loved" believes him to be an indifferent, uncaring, bastard!" When Sherlock finishes his ranting, he goes over to his violin rips it from its case before drawing the bow across the strings in a sawing motion.
If John didn't know Sherlock, he would have smiled and basked in the sentimental words Sherlock had just spoken, but, John knows Sherlock. He knows the detective is only trying to divert the conversation.
When Sherlock only continues to remain oblivious John sighs and begrudgingly states, “Mary Morstan and…you.” The only reply John gets is a rapid fire blinking from the other man. After several long minutes and this has not ceased, John begins to worry. After repeating the detective’s name several times, Sherlock finally snaps out of it and haltingly inquires, “So, in fact… Y-you mean that I’m your best…”
John stares fixedly at Sherlock's face. To Sherlock, it looks as if John is trying to gauge his wounds or memorize his face. Sherlock doesn't think he has ever felt more vulnerable. When their eyes meet John closes his eyes and visibly starts to shake. He sinks into the chair that is placed conveniently next to the bed and places his head in his hands.
Other than an absence of her pregnant belly, she looks perfectly fine. Her face and eyes, however, are dark and malicious as she looks wickedly at the doctor as she states, “This is quite a turn up, isn’t it?” She walks forward—her body nearly flush against the detective’s back—her footsteps echoing off the walls, “We’re here again, aren’t we? I just knew you would come if I called, John. You’re just so
you’re my best friend.” Sherlock’s expression never truly loses the shocked disbelief after the other man’s confession, and after drinking eyeball infested tea, John has a clue in to Sherlock’s frame of mind.
Soon the screeching sounds morph into a slow heart breaking piece John had heard previously. Sherlock's demeanor had completely changed. Before the music had began, His entire form had been set rigidly and withdrawn, but now…now it's as if he is defeated. As if his entire world has collapsed. His proud frame is now drooping slightly, his head is moderately bowed, and his shoulders are slumped downwards. The proud detective stands before John, appearing crumbled and defeated.
’ the army doctor thought. He turned to the young detective and gave him a soft smile before glaring at Sergeant Donovan and Anderson, “Excuse me, Sally, but judging by the state of your clothes and knees, it appears to me that you’ve been doing more than just scrubbing New Scotland Yard’s floors. What would Lestrade say if he knew that two of the
John can feel the anger steadily rising as Sherlock’s smile never falters from his face. The doctor in him knows that Sherlock is steadily coasting down from his high, but his anger does not abate or falter for a single moment. He refuses to believe the detective’s story about being undercover. Because of this, his eyes narrow and he harshly grabs the detective’s arm and jerks him upward to stand. John is surprised he didn’t break Sherlock’s arm as he forcefully pushes the other man down the long hallway and out the door. The ride to Kate’s house (to drop off Isaac) and then to Barts was bitterly quiet. Because of John’s burning fury, it’s up to Mary to tell Molly that Sherlock would be needing a drug test. With a resounding
Lestrade quickly steps forward and arrests her. Three family members are now sobbing for a different reason along with the first. As she is being led away by the good DI, Anderson then walks into the room but stops short when he sees Sherlock's red thread.
Many people would assume that Sherlock is an emotionless machine, but if they could see him like this, they would quickly take back their words. When Sherlock plays his violin, it’s as if his heart is in what he plays and the tune always seems to depict his feelings, which he can convey better this way, than any words he could ever say. When the detective finally finishes the song, his devoted blogger has tears in his eyes and a grin upon his face. As the consulting detective replaces the violin in its case, John proceeds to stand and wrap his arms around Sherlock’s slim waist. “That was beautiful, love. Thank you for this evening.” They share a sweet kiss until Sherlock parts from his soulmate long enough to say, “The evening’s far from over.”
Notes: First off the 1: Mímir is the Norse god of Wisdom. If you want to know more about him, look him up. I'm too lazy to put more of a description about him on here lol. :) Okay, Future plans for Anderson and Donovan...I personally don't like either character. Not because they are pointless. Both characters add something to the story, but the problem I have with them is that before the fall. They were horrible! I know Anderson's gotten better but, I have difficulties with both. I plan though to make both character's nicer due to the fact that after the fall, they are kinder (I'm not really making this season 3 compatible, but I will have some references about it. I might somehow incorperate Sherlock's best man speech, because let's be honest, that was adorable. I currently don't have time to write the reviews but tomorrow, when I have time, I will post my answers to your reviews :D Stay tuned!
"Shh...I know. Slowly, alright?" Instead of answering, Sherlock's ivory complexion turns a lovely shade of red as the blush deepens and travels further down his neck. He nods his head obediently at John's request and awkwardly places his hands on John's shoulders. John laughs softly and lifts his head slightly, hands moving to grip the back of Sherlock's neck, before whispering against the bashful sleuth's timid lips, "Just...follow my lead."This kiss starts out slow. Sherlock has yet to figure out what to do with his hands, or lips for that matter, but John, ever reliant John, seems to know what is going through his head and gently moves his lips against Sherlock's shy ones.
"I can't believe he even has a mate!" Anderson chortles, "Why anyone would want him is beyond me. His mate must be a desperate, poor sod to be in a relationship with him. Anyone can see that Sherlock's just a sociopath and a
John's anger had steadily climbed as each word was articulated by the cruel pair against the consulting detective, but when he looks over to Sherlock his heart stops and then breaks for his beautiful genius.
That’s how they end up here. John procures their finer whisky, grabs two glasses, deposits one into the detective’s hand, and the drinking begins. The dancing is just a nice perk of the drinking, really. John would never admit it out loud, but it was moments like these that made him realize with an alarming clarity that he loves the other man so fiercely.
"Thousands of thoughts raced through the blond man’s head as he drew closer to the hospital. ‘God, I hope he’s alright,’ seemed to be playing on a constant loop in the blogger’s mind."

Notes: I'd like to draw attention to chapter one for a moment. At the beginning of this fic, Sherlock isn't the young Sherlock at age 16-19. He is a lot older and has met John. Just wanted to point that out. That will be important later on. I want to say THANK YOU! To all the people who Favorited and started fallowing this story! You have made this pitiful writer's day :). I hope to upload a chapter a day. Some days I will forget and then I will upload two. I have a lot of the stories written in advance. Please comment! I need to know what you guys are thinking!
The besotted ebony haired man blushes and brushes a kiss against John’s forehead, “Thank you, John. I think you look very handsome, too.” Mycroft, who has been looking at his watch throughout the soon to be wedded pair’s display of affection, decides, at this moment, to break up this adorable scene: “We have an appointment to keep, everyone. We must leave now if we are going to get there in time.”
John, having grown accustomed to a Holmes’ wrath, squares his shoulders, ever the captain, and replies, “You told me to make it right. That’s why I’m

inform the pair that he would be taking them out for a "stag night" later that evening. Sherlock wasn't particularly sure what that was, but he already knew he wouldn't like it but John, however, was very excited about the prospect of a boys night out. When Gregory left, the consulting detective begins researching what a "stag night" entails. He doesn’t like what he saw. Thus, Sherlock decides to voice his concerns to his blogger.
John's anger flares once again and he bites out, “Stop playing these fucking games with me! Do you really want to know?” When he doesn’t receive a response, he barrels on, “I want you to leave me the hell alone! Stop interfering with my life! Stop telling me what I should and shouldn’t do!” Ebony curls somehow sink even lower and pale digits tighten in silky ringlets in an effort to appear smaller than he already does. The only sound that could be heard escapes passed John's lips in angry exhales. Due to this, John almost misses the whispered, “I’m trying.”
" Each day he could feel the taunts seeping deeper and deeper into his skin. Sure, he could pretend that everything was alright at school, but when he got home...that was a different matter.
One grief-filled month later, John was finally discharged out of the hospital with orders to visit a psychiatrist, but, what is he to do now? He has no purpose, no family, no life here in London. He has nothing anymore.
John stumbles forward and erases the remaining distance between them, wedges himself into the crowd forming around his love, and manages to wrap his trembling hand around Sherlock's lifeless wrist in order to check for a pulse. '
, to be solved. Although she had been connected, like many others, with the sacred red thread, she seemed to genuinely like Sherlock. The best part about Ms. Adler’s appearance was that she made John jealous.
He would never actually tell Sherlock any of this. He knows this isn’t Sherlock’s area, but John’s feelings feel near to bursting while the detective giggles softly into John’s ear as they stumble over each other. The dance slows into something soft as Sherlock’s hand trails up John’s arm to mirror the other one on John’s shoulder. Between one breath and the next, Sherlock steps impossibly closer and drapes his arms around John’s neck. The former soldier’s arms automatically wrap around the detective’s too thin waist as he tries to calm his racing heart. He has to forcefully remind himself that Sherlock is much more drunk than he is, and the Consulting Detective can’t really be held accountable for his actions.

If he didn't wake up screaming from the smell of smoke or the sight of shrapnel imbedding into skin, he was miserable from his shaking hands that forbade him from ever working with his hands professionally. He had a job at the local A&E but, due to his hands, he could no longer work as a surgeon so he now took on the role of setting broken bones and writing prescriptions for flu medication.
At that moment Mycroft opens the door to see his little brother slumped against the tub with blood seeping into his shirt and pooling on the white tiled flooring. He immediately dials the emergency contact number and tries to stop the blood flow until an ambulance arrives. Three things unnerved Mycroft the most. One: Why had Sherlock been feeling this way, Two: Sherlock's satisfied smile (as if he were happy his life would be over) and, Three: Why hadn't
"Don't be absurd, John." Came the monotonous response. " In my profession, I know when people are lying and you are a terrible liar. Either you are lying to me, or you are withholding some of the facts." Sherlock then turns to look at John. His carefully sculpted face, in John's opinion, had never been this withdrawn or dispassionate.
Special Thanks: QueenLadyAnne, my lovely Beta, who keeps reassuring me and giving me wonderful advice, and all my reviewers and commenters. You guys seriously make my day! :D
Despite countless days of reassurance and months of whispered apologies after each and every nightmare, Sherlock could not stop his reactions, no matter how illogical he found them. John noticed. Of course he did, but he would not comment on them. He would get this sad, guilty look in his eyes that proclaimed a deep regret that had been uttered too many times to count. It was four months later that everything changed.
Sherlock had. He saw it in the way John made him eat or sleep. He saw it when John looked at him and he felt it when they kissed. The ebony haired man blinks several times from the new information Mycroft gave him. When he finishes, he realizes he has let fear of losing John cloud his logic.
His army pension wouldn't be enough for him to rent a nice flat so, he made do. He lived in a broken down, plain flat in one of the worst parts of London. He would go on dates but he would never call them back. He would date the person, fellow people who didn't have a soul partner, until she or he began talking about love and would quickly cut all ties from them. He no longer believed in love, so what was the point?
John’s rage was all consuming but it left just as quickly as it came when he took one look at Sherlock’s face. His expression was closed-off and guarded, but it was the way that verdigris eyes looked to John as if he would join in the mockery.
"Hmm. You're lying, but I'll figure it out later. Now, I want to tell you what I found out about the case!"
John's not naïve enough to believe that if Sherlock hadn't been so heavily medicated, that he would have gotten this much out of the introverted man. Sherlock has obviously been more affected by John's absence than he lets on. He had never thought about it from Sherlock's perspective. He had only ever thought about his hurt or his pain, but now, he realizes it has not been all one-sided. When Sherlock next awoke, they would have to have a serious discussion about everything.
When the doctor awoke the next morning, he was contentedly warm and felt as if he was swathed in a squid's constricting grasp. The soldier in him wanted to fight against the binding restraints but upon further inspection, John felt a warm breath against the nape of his neck and solid, lean arms wrapped around his middle. 'Sherlock,' the blogger thought with a soft smile.
Several of the people who sold their emotions could no longer take the emptiness they felt without them and stopped selling their feelings, and over ¾ of the donating population stopped providing the rest of the community with their usual dosage of emotions. Despite propaganda encouraging people to sell their emotions, people began questioning whether or not giving away their feelings was actually a good idea. Soon, the rumors began. It began as quiet whispers and hushed tones but this quickly escalated to panic when the dreaded word ‘
Before either party could do anything, a knock sounded from downstairs and then there was a brief conversation before feet pounded their ascension into the stairs. Moments late Lestrade poked his head out behind the door and steps into the room. "I thought I'd stopped by and give these to Sherlock." He then steps forward and hands the cold case files to the gleeful looking detective. "I figured he'd be bored soon without something to- how do you put it?- 'stimulate your brain'? Anyway, that's all I really wanted. I'll be off." Lestrade turns as if to leave but John pipes up and asks the greying DI if he would like a cup of tea.
This chapter was incredibly hard for me to write (when I first began writing this story). It's the sole reason it took so long to actually put this story out there. However, I knew where I wanted to go with this story, I just didn't know exactly how to write it all down. From the very beginning, I knew that I wanted Mary to be the villian of this story. If you follow me on tumblr, I was very VERY adament that Mary is Moriarty and I thought for
As she withdraws from the elated doctor, she grabs the recently wedded pair’s hands and with tear filled eyes, she joyfully exclaims, “I’m no proud of you two. You’ve found your way together despite all the obstacles in your way. I wish you a life full of happiness and many years of love and laughter.”
The detective looks around the room and notices that they are almost out of John's favorite tea, so he walks over to the refrigerator and takes in account of how much milk they have. The carton is at least half full.
"You are my heart, John. I don’t want to go back to the way my life was before you and now I know for certain that  I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”
John's eye, of course, widen when he hears the small stuttered request (some other part of his anatomy, which had already been affected by the heated snogging, also shows an interest in the conversation), but Sherlock continues before John can say anything, "Nothing sexual. I don't think..I'm not sure I'm ready for any of that, but…I would enjoy your company tonight." Sherlock's hands twitch while he waits for a response. When John has failed to reply, after several moments of shocked staring, Sherlock had taken his silence as a denial.
When John happened to look down, he saw a thin white line running across Sherlock's wrist. Now, don't believe everything Sherlock tells you. John is not an idiot. He was a spectacular soldier and a brilliant doctor. He has seen many scars like this and knows how they are produced. John grabs Sherlock's wrist and turns his arm over.
He has no intention of surviving this fall. This would be his final bow. With this thought in mind, he plunged the needle into his arm.
When the duo arrives at St. Barts, John slowly makes his way to the entrance. He has had bad experiences with this hospital and being here now brings them to his foremind. John shakes his head to dispel the dark thoughts circling in his mind and opens the door for Sherlock. As they make their way down to the morgue, Sherlock begins fidgeting and biting his lower lip due to his nerves. When questioned about his odd behavior, Sherlock would only reply vaguely.
The older man jumps, not realizing that Sherlock had even left his bedroom, let alone entered the living room. When he finally registers what the other man said, understandable confusion mars John’s facial features. The Consulting Detective rolls his eyes and continues, “No, we will not be having a Christmas party this year.” Sherlock knows that that is not what John was just thinking of, but he is hoping it will be an adequate distraction against the darkness pervading John’s thoughts. John knows what he’s doing, and he’s grateful for it.
Notes: Sherlock may seem a bit OOC but I figured that if someone had been verbally tortured consistently throughout their life, you have a right to be a little bit hurt by someone you love. Yes, I'll let that escape now, Sherlock does love John but he is a little bit confused at the moment. Give him time, he'll make it :). I have this thing for crying Sherlock (I'm a bit of a masochist). It causes my chest to go all tight and heart to hurt... That makes me sound like a weirdo O.o Anyway, I'm rambling. I hope you enjoy the story!
. Whomever had said that was definitely correct. The hot Afghan sun blisters his skin. The cold reality that you could die any minute hangs like a dark, threatening shroud over the troop’s heads.  The bullets whirling past his head, the smoke from detonated explosives, and the adrenaline rush that comes from saving another person all add up together to make him feel alive. He has never felt so alive. He thrives under stressful situations, and he finally feels like he is making a difference. That is, at age 28, until he gets shot.
This fanfiction is nearly over! It's about two more chapters (I think?). I am so very proud of this story. It was so fun to write and I had a great time :).
John, an aspiring, promising army surgeon advancing in rank in the military, is content with life. His constant need for adrenaline is being sated and he finally feels useful! After years of being belittled and beaten, he has found his place in the world as a healer and a protector for hundreds of lives daily. He had just successfully performed an amputation surgery on a soldier who was shot critically in the leg when a fellow soldier walks up and hands him a letter. Harry had been sending John letters weekly throughout his deployment for one consistent month, but gradually the letters slowed until they abruptly stopped all together. He knew Harry was getting his letters, though. Clara, Harriet’s long-term girlfriend would send correspondences in Harry’s place, but the younger Watson could tell that something was wrong. When he would question Clara, she would brush it off as nothing. For one year this persisted until John receives this current letter from Clara detailing what exactly had been going on for the past year of John’s deployment. Her letter is smudged in several places as if something wet had fallen onto the page as the ink were drying. John absently mindedly realizes she had been crying. With a sense of dread, he reads the shaky scrawl.
Sherlock begins struggling in her grasp, but he is still weak from the narcotics raging through his system. When that doesn’t work, he manages to jab a sharp elbow backwards to create enough room between the two struggling figures in order for John to take a shot. In seconds, a shot echos off the walls and blood begins to stain the front of Mary’s shirt. She scrambles to her knees and stares at her ex-husband with labored breath. Mary’s weight shifts forward as she coughs blood, but before John can react she smiles menacingly, lips stained dark red, and she begins to
When the dynamic duo arrives at the crime scene, they are met with flashing blue and red lights. Sergeant Donovan snarls at Sherlock but begrudgingly lifts the tape for the two men. As soon as Sherlock steps foot into the small room, he effortlessly locates the scene of the crime, which just so happens to be a dimly lit, homely bathroom with beige walls, an earth toned bathmat on the floor, a large tub, a toilet beside the door, and two sinks that take up one side of the room. Lestrade meets the pair and begins debriefing them on the victim, Brian Barkley, but Sherlock tunes him out. Unlike he would normally do, Sherlock forgoes the body in order to walk over to the bathroom counter. There on the counter sits a broken razor with the blade separated from the rest of the debris. On the blade, in a small hole that would connect the screw to the razor, unseen by the rest of the populace there, Sherlock noticed specks of dried blood, which were hastily wiped away to avoid detection.
Eventually, he reaches a dead end. The hallway ends in two separate supply closets and an employee bathroom, and with a quick check, he discovers that all three are empty. Confused, John makes his way back toward his detective to make sure he is alright and then to check other rooms. Mycroft would eventually be called because Moriarty is still at large. However, when he reaches his lover, he notices a figure standing behind Sherlock brandishing a gun and what looks to be a syringe filled with a black liquid. John draws his gun and aims it at the mysterious person’s head and he says in his best Captain’s voice, “Drop the gun and back away slowly!”
The thought comes to John after the fifth flash of dark curls that quickly turn around and go in the opposite direction than originally intended. At first John had thought Sherlock had been on a case. It was common for Sherlock to disappear throughout the course of the day and then return at ungodly hours only to torture his violin, but John began to notice the lack of a sprawled out detective on the sofa, or case notes cluttering the coffee table.
Just as John was about to say something he would probably regret, Sherlock’s phone pinged with an incoming message. One long lanky arm unwound itself from the tangled sheet to bring the phone up to the detective’s face. The infuriating man lunged from the couch, dropping the sheet, and ran up the stairs starkers all the while yelling down to John about a new case. Normally, Sherlock’s antics would have stopped this infuriated mood, but with all the stress from work, the recent divorce from Mary, finding out that the baby wasn’t his, and now being thrown back into Sherlock’s insane lifestyle, John was at his breaking point. The blogger gripped the edge of the counter tightly as Sherlock breezed into the kitchen, now fully dressed, and looked into the fridge for the missing milk. He then unhelpfully informed John that they were out and that he would need to go and get some more. He then wanted to know why John wasn’t dressed yet.
He left nothing to the imagination. At particularly hard points in his life he would pause and John would snuggle back into his embrace and places his hands more firmly against Sherlock's that lay across his stomach. When the tale had finished and several cups of tea had been consumed, the sun had fled and the moon shone brilliantly through the darkened night.
“I tried to do what's right by you. You wanted space, I gave you that. You wanted me to be your best man, and I gave you that, too. I know that my return was a bit...sudden and unexpected. I did not intend to cause you any more pain or unnecessary grief. Despite what you may believe, John, I am only a human. I can only do so much. I’m not a hero. I’m selfish, rude, and generally an obnoxious arsehole. That’s why I need you to go back to her. Go back to Mary. I can't do it all on my own. So, please, go and be happy. I’ve caused you enough grief.”
Sherlock pulls away with a huff, rolls his eyes, and then replies with, "I don't see why it's any of their business. If these
John chuckles as well and draws Sherlock in for another bruising kiss. He retrieves the lube from Sherlock and spreads it along Sherlock's long length and then wraps a hand around both of their hard members. Sherlock breaks away from the kiss to utter a deep moan, "John!" John speeds up his pace until the only sounds coming out of both mouths are uttered profanities and unintelligible groans. "I'm close.." Sherlock was panting by this point and John had to utter his agreement, "Me too.."
There is no way that Mary should know any of that. He doesn’t want to believe that the woman he once married could be Moriarty, but suddenly it all makes sense. The fact alone that she has a past of being an assassin is proof enough that he never really knew her. John’s face turns dark and angry as he realizes that the woman he thought he knew is completely gone. Out of the corner of John’s eye, he sees Sherlock’s breathing changes and his hand twitches as if to say, ‘
Also....If you know me, you know that I like angst, and you're going to get a lot of it. Here's a hint for next chapter, Fall...
John is tired of living as if he is balanced upon a scale. Sometimes it's as if Sherlock absolutely loathes his existence. At those moments the scale topples over and John hangs precariously on the edge. Then Sherlock would say something sentimental like, "I don't have friends. I've just got one." Of course the scale would then tip in John's favor. He, then, would feel as his portion of the scale surpasses the other in soaring heights. He could touch the stars.
John's eyes widen and fill with tears as he scrambles backward and away from Sherlock. A half-choked off sob escapes involuntarily from trembling thin lips and arms come up to hide his face from the shocked, slightly bruised face in front of him. When the sobs subside momentarily, John looks up with red-rimmed eyes and whispers, "Why? I don't care how. I just want to know why."
There is something you should know about hospital gowns. The design is terrible, the fabric itches when worn, and the sleeves are very short.
An answering smile breaks across the bloggers face as he nods. John quickly finds himself swept away in his lover’s sure footwork. The night didn’t go according to plan, but John now realizes he didn’t need to go out to a club tonight. He was proud of the man he was with and he loved his beautiful threadmate with all his heart.
Sherlock’s face briefly morphs into an expression of sheer relief when he sees his loving threadmate, but he tampers that down to say, “Sebastian, this is my

Greg finally steps forward with a sigh, “John, you apparently have to come with me. There’s this Holmes family tradition that states that a soulbonded couple getting married has to be separated the night before their wedding day. John looks shocked only before he grumbles out, “What the bloody hell for?”
This is the song I imagine Sherlock playing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n49-W3cX8g (A Time for Us)
keeps him from calling off the entire thing. If John needed any more proof that Sherlock did not care about him
That is until Mr. Watson receives a note home from Harry’s year six teacher when she was caught kissing another girl behind the bleachers at school. He flew into a fit of rage. He viciously grabs Harry’s hair, pulling out several strands in the process, and begins slurring homophobia mercilessly. John arrives home and finds them likes this only minutes after Harry’s own arrival moments before. Being terrified of his father, but wanting to protect his sister, John cautiously goes up to his father as requests politely for Harriet’s freedom. He lets her go, throwing her to the ground in the process, walks over to John and crowds him against the wall, as he replies, “Why, because you’re a fucking faggot, too? Are you going to grow up to be a cocksucker now? You’re just a gay faggot, aren’t you?” With tears in his eyes, John replies, “N-no, I’m not!” Mr. Watson sees red. As he raises his voice, with a, “Don’t you dare back talk me,” he raises his hand and aggressively cuffs John across the face. The sound echoes around the room and the door slams with Mr. Watson’s departure. John collapses against the floor in tears as Harry crawls over to him.
Sherlock can read the terror of the evening and an overwhelming fear on John's expressive face. Sherlock slowly grabs John's hand and places it over his beating heart. John leans forward and lightly presses his lips to cupid-bowed ones.
?' The consulting detective then remembers the hurt look on John's face as he storms up the stairs into his own room. Sherlock pauses for a moment before meekly walking over to the foot of the stairs and quietly calling up, "John?" He waits a moment before asking, "Are you still mad?" He takes a step up when there is no reply. "Can I come up there with you?" He takes another step, "If I can't come up, say so...

When Mycroft had finally came to collect Sherlock, he had been beaten, bloody, and a little worse for wear, but as they boarded a plane back to their beloved city, Sherlock knew it was all worth it. He knew John was safe and protected from the wicked spiders he had been fighting this whole time.
Pinterest for the writing prompt that lead to this story ("In a world where emotions are considered drugs, your family has sat you down to talk about your addiction to joy," and "You live in a wrold in which you can buy bottled emotions.") I took this prompt in a very odd place.
Sherlock turns to John and incredulously questions, “What the hell am I supposed to do with that?!” The blogger smiles and kisses the younger man on the cheek, “Nothing, love. Now, come on. Let’s get out of here.
Just before the silence becomes awkward and unbearable, Sherlock blurts out, “If this is about last night, John, I promise you that I can move into 221C or I could move out.”
Where just a few that were running rampant throughout his mind. When the kiss had ended Sherlock, despite feeling overwhelmed, had enjoyed the connection he could feel with John. It was as if an electric spark shot throughout his nervous system drawing them together. Yet...John wanted him to delete it. John doesn’t care about Sherlock the way Sherlock cares about John. John is Sherlock’s weak point, his college, his partner, his friend… His best friend.
As Sherlock lay, gasping for breath, recovering from his orgasm, John turns all his attention to his own erection. The sight of Sherlock's flushed face, gasping chest, and relaxed frame, bring John over the edge and he soon comes with a gasp of the detective's name.
"'This is it.' He thinks to himself. He picks up the knife and looks at his reflection in its glistening surface. He looks down at himself with self loathing and begins to think back to all the times they had had together. He bitterly laughs when he realizes that he was the one to ruin it all. His grip tightens further on the knife and his eyes harden and his body runs cold."
“I want to wake up everyday and see your face. I want to hold your hand and kiss you goodnight. I want to be able to go on cases with you all the time, and I want to share the success with you. I want to be able to tell everyone that you are mine and that I am yours. I just want to be with you.”
The man before him, who has always appeared so sure and confident now stands unsure, fiddling with his hands, waiting for the blogger to say something. When the silence weighs too heavily on the consulting detective's shoulders, he begins to ramble useless nonsense. When John steps forward, on slight uneven steps, Sherlock's maundering speech comes to an abrupt end.
The other man in his arms hugs him back just as tightly for a few minutes until suddenly, his arms go slack and he becomes a dead weight in John’s arms. He withdraws in alarm as the other man begins convulsing violently. He lays Sherlock on the floor in the recovery position as Sherlock begins screaming, tears streaming down his agonized face.
John heard the front door slam so he knew he was finally alone. He slowly exhales and let's wave of disappointment settle over him. He knows he shouldn't be upset but he can still recall that eight year old little boy who had dreamt of a country home, a gorgeous husband, and possibly two adopted children. The husband fantasy now seems to be out and no adoption agency would ever take two unmarried blokes seriously if they had even tried to broach the subject of adoption.
“No, John. That’s exactly what it is.” Sherlock gets up to storm into his room, but John grabs his hand to stop him. “No, Sherlock. Listen to me! I love you dearly. I didn’t say anything to that bloody twit because….well, I didn’t want to embarrass you, love. I heard what he was saying to you. In all honesty, I’m terrified that you’ll wake up one day and realize how boring I am. I’m an old man. I have scars and I’m just a beast. I’m not as young as I used to be. One day, I won’t be able to chase after criminals or jump across roof tops. You shine like the stars. You’re brilliant and bright and beautiful. In comparison to you, love, I’m so dull. I often times wonder what you see in me.”
When Sherlock finally frees John from the constricting embrace, he settles down against the pillows and closes his eyes and breathes a sigh of contentment. John goes to pull a chair beside the bed until Sherlock lunges forward, and grabs hold of John's wrist. "No! You can't leave! I've just got you back! I fought so hard to get you back! Don't leave me now. Please…" To John's utter horror, Sherlock's eyes well up with tears.
When Sherlock catches sight of John though he says, far too loudly, "JOHN!" The previously drowsy detective begins to struggle against the constricting sheets wrapped around his legs until a chuckling army doctor walks forward and lays a steadying hand on Sherlock's smooth pale chest before saying, "Easy! Easy now. It's alright. I'm here now."
The consulting detective tries once more to persuade John to reconsider, but he is having none of it. He’s thought this through. He’s been thinking about this since the moment Sherlock woke up at the hospital and these feelings are just reaffirmed when he found out it was Mary that shot him. There are no warring emotions. When he was going to marry Mary, there had been this niggling doubt at the back of his mind. But, for once, he is sure. With a decided course of action, John soldiers on straight ahead without hesitation. With a determined nod, he finishes hanging the decorations and determines they have a little over half an hour to get ready before they must go to be on time. He gently pushes Sherlock into his room to get dressed before he travels up the stairs to change into a festive jumper. When he finally descends, the stairs leading from his room, Sherlock is ready to go and is waiting for John near the door. John grabs his coat and then they’re off.
John Watson had always known he was intended to have a soul mate. He was one of the few very fortunate children that had their red threads at an early age. Everyone in his family knew that he was a special child. Unlike most children, John’s thread was a crimson, fiery red that burned intently and endlessly.
Sherlock was interrupted during a crucial moment during his experiment by the opening of a door. He glanced up momentarily, eyed the two men standing at the entrance, and deduced the stranger's past. '
Time elapses and several cups of tea have been consumed. During the two hours, Sherlock has pretty much solved the case and was working on finalizing all the details in his mind, that is until Lestrade stands to collect his coat, which had been discarded after the first hour, and walks over to Sherlock and takes his hand saying, "I'm glad you are alright, mate." Sherlock nods, gives a small smile, before shaking the hand clutching at his own. Lestrade then goes over to the door and inclines his head, silently asking if John would follow him down. Without waiting for confirmation, Lestrade heads down the stairs to await at the bottom for the loyal blogger. A minute later both DI and Doctor stand at the bottom of the staircase, in front of the door.
-And last, but certainnly not least, all of YOU. You who were so kind and supportive. You guys who followed me on tumblr and FF.net. Those who gave kudos and left comments, you are my heros. Thank you so much for being so kind to me and my child of a story. Thank you from the very bottom of my heart. I love each and every one of you.
When they had finally headed to bed, they both decide that separation would not be advisable or wanted by either party. John took Sherlock's hand and led him up the stairs and through the door. Once inside, John places his hands gently on Sherlock's chest and looks up into his gray, stormy eyes that reflect a wary hesitation that borders on fear. '
Sherlock has no idea what to expect from the evening, so he puts on his tight purple shirt and tailored, black trousers. John, on the other hand, wears a black, well-fitted shirt that shows off his still defined muscles and a pair of nice jeans. When the doctor and detective present what they are wearing to the other, two pairs of eyes dilate while mentally undressing the other and a shared gasp is uttered. John is the first to speak as he breathlessly says, “God, love. You look gorgeous.” When Sherlock hears the way his blogger speaks these words, he blushes and says, “Thank you, John. You look very handsome.”
When Sherlock was at the delicate age of six, his parents sat him down and told him about soul bounding, and the vital red threads. When the talk was over Sherlock asked a single condemning question, “Why can’t I see mine?” At the time the question was just laughed off, but he would later struggle with the same question years later during a time when all of his other classmates had threads and he did not.
Forty-five minutes later, the half-awake army doctor stumbles into the living room and blearily plants a sloppy kiss against the executive's lips. A half mumbled "G'morning" is spoken until John makes his way slowly into kitchen. Once there, the blogger begins the process of making tea, thus discovering the missing milk. "Sherlock, did you use
The ex-army physician stares at his sister-in-law uncomprehendingly for a total of 30 seconds before he notices his vision is swimming and the odd noises he hears is coming from him in the form of sobs. He manages to choke out, “Wha—how? She was fine just a week ago!” Clara’s tears don’t stop, but her face crumbles as she replies, “John, you’ve been gone for a year! We…
The blogger cautiously reaches for the detective’s angular face until he can gently lay his palm on Sherlock’s cheek and he tenderly turns the genius’ head. Bright verdigris eyes stare deeply into dark blue as John tries to show the young man the he is genuinely penitent for his sins as he bares his heart, “Sherlock, love, you are not a freak. I did not mean it when I said that you were. I was mad. I wasn’t even mad at you. I let my anger accumulate from the divorce and finding out that the child I thought was mine, wasn’t. I had been letting it build and build and build until it burst out from me. Still, that’s no excuse. I shouldn’t have said what I did. You are the last person who deserved what I did to you. Especially after all that you have done for me. You have saved me more times then I will ever know. You fixed me when I came back from Afghanistan a broken army doctor with a busted shoulder and a psychosomatic limp. Yes, your fall hurt me. I was alive, but I wasn’t living during those two years that you were gone, but when you came back, I could finally
That’s how Sherlock finds John. He’s sitting on the hardwood floors of Baker Street muttering to himself as he attacks each tangled knot with more venom than is specifically required. Out of John’s line of vision, he allows worry and sadness to overtake his angular features at his friend’s obvious anger and distress. He quickly wipes his face clean of any emotion, places an indifferent mask on his face, and only then he states, “The answer is no.”
John breathes out calmly and slowly before extending his hand to give her back the memory stick containing her classified information. She turns wide, fearful eyes on John.
Notes: I'm sorry this is so short. This next one and the 8th one will be longer. To make up for that I have decided to upload two. I thought this chapter, were I had stopped it, was the perfect spot, so that's why it's so short. I hope you enjoyed it even though it's angsty!
John was always a courageous little boy and at the age of eight he decided to “Go on an adventure!” He packed a small bag with some clothes, crisps, biscuits, and juice to follow his red thread. He told his mother and father of his plans and they bit back smiles and told him that they would come with him to ‘help him search’. They followed the thread for a few blocks until John got tired, and a bit discouraged, and reluctantly agreed to head home with a heavy heart.
.’ The amateur detective then picks up the deceased man’s hand, checks under the man’s fingernails, and unbuttons the man’s shirt and notices what appears to be almost 200 scars littering the man’s ribs and stomach, some old and others fresh. Lastly, he opens the victim’s mouth and smells inside.
. He picked up a hairbrush and threw it at the mirror. The glass shattered and the broken pieces landed on the counter and the floor. With tears running down his face, he picked up a shard, looked at it briefly, before putting it against his skin and made a small cut along the inside of his wrist. He Didn't regret it. In fact, he thought that it had felt
John stares at his counterpart in disbelief before stating in exasperation, “Move out? Why would you move out? This is your home, you git.” He pauses just long enough to say a silent prayer that this isn’t all a mistake before continuing, “However, this is about what you said last night. In fact, I was hoping to get your opinion on something.” John begins dragging his thumb across the knuckles in his grasp as he says, “How would you feel if I told you that I want to spend the rest of my life with you here at Baker Street?”
“I love you too.” Sherlock says as he smiles. They lovingly embrace. John sighs and looks up at his love with a soft smile, “It’s just one day, right? We can do this. I’ll see you tomorrow, love.”
Sherlock and John were running down darkened alleyways trying to catch a murder who had already killed twice before. In the end, the perpetrator’s capture was anticlimactic. The dynamic duo cornered the killer at a dead end, and with one swift tackle delivered by Dr. Watson the murderer was neutralized. As Lestrade and the rest of New Scotland Yard arrived to arrest the killer, the amateur detective and his loyal blogger were giving their statements to another officer. When they had finished, as per usual, Sherlock basked in the knowledge of another case solved by indulging in several pleased smiles. His face fell, however, when he heard what Sergeant Donovan had to say to Anderson: “He really does get off on it. Look at the Freak’s smug smile.”
I LIVE! I'm so, so, so, so, so, sososososososososo Sorry! I've been gone for nearly a year! Are any of you still out there? I am terribly sorry, guys. :( If I may offer an excuse, I do have one... So, this past year was my senior year in high school. It was extremely hectic and crazy. I had to prepare myself for college. That was also time consuming and extremely tedious. For those who don't know, I was extremely depressed and suicidal for a long time. A friend of mine (who I happened to be in love with at the time) told me to go commit suicide (he knows that I have trouble with that, by the way), and it really, really set me back a lot. Between getting ready for college and being in emotional turmoil, my life has (to repeat the word) really, really hectic. I hope you all can forgive me! I love you all! I wrote a whole bunch for you all! I double my word count! I hope this helps in the forgiveness process? Anyway, on to the actual notes...
Sherlock had been fighting so hard these last two years to come home. He hadn't meant to be gone for so long, but Moriarty's web had stretched all across the globe. He would have given up so long ago if he hadn't had someone to come home to. '
"Sherlock?" John becomes slightly worried when he doesn't see the infuriating detective and begins to look around. Before John can discern Sherlock's location a broken whisper
John’s confusion only grows with these words and, growing steadily annoyed form being kept in the dark, he turns his mate around to look at the doctor. Sherlock’s demeanor has changed. His shoulders are slumped in defeat, and a small pout splays itself across cupid bowed lips: “I don’t want to be away, but Mycroft is right. I don’t want this any more than you do, but it’s only for one night.” Something behind the detective’s eyes shifts as he says, “I’ll see you in the morning…won’t I? You’ll be there, right?” The blogger would have laughed at the thought of being anywhere the detective wasn’t, but that all dies when John sees the vulnerable look hiding just below the surface. “Sherlock, I’ll be there. I’ll always be there when you need me. I love you,” John lovingly proclaims.
All other thoughts recede from his mind as he begins to imagine the world without this infuriating man. He doesn't notice the other man's presence, he doesn't hear the kettle whistle signaling it has finished boiling, and he doesn't hear the other man cutting off the stove and remove said offending kettle. What John does notice is the warm heat of a body sitting next to him on the kitchen floor. When John lifts his head he is met with cool, calculating, verdigris eyes that seem to know what he is always thinking.
Mycroft finally lets the all-knowing facade fall away and lets the confusion consume his facial expression. "And you think I do?!"
Sherlock, without relinquishing his hold on John, all but growls out, “I can and I will! I am not some blushing maiden. I don’t want to do it.” After this, the Holmes brothers wage a silent war that no one else seems to be privy to. John, having grown tired of the vague situation, states, “Now, hang on. What are you talking about, Mycroft? What the hell is going on?”
Since the two were pressed so closely together, head to toe, John felt a...firm persistent, pressure... against the cleft of his buttocks. His eyebrows raise to his hairline, until they are no longer seen, and he shifts minutely to speak to the sleeping sleuth but his movements provide stimulus against Sherlock's straining erection. The answering near-silent moan arouses and surprises the blogger and that feeling amplifies when a whispered "John," escapes from the detective's lips.
If you are curious, I had a song in mind during the wedding It's called "Jealous" by Labyrinth (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXD52y9jsOU) or "Dancing on my own" Calum Scott's version (found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtGlvnbVun4).
Once that was completed, Sherlock carefully flops down onto the couch, places his hands under his chin in a prayer-like fashion and closes his eyes. When he is in position, the door then opens to reveal a tired looking John behind it.
"I am perfectly fine! If the idiotic medical staff here would do their jobs correctly and learn to observe their surroundings, they would see that I am quite sound! Yet, they are all idiots and refuse to
The elevator makes its slow ascension up toward the desired room and when the small ding noise sounds, forty seconds later, John has already exited the small chamber, before the doors have even finished opening all the way.
Sherlock Holmes!?" Sherlock's breathing hitched at that last part and he quickly turns away from the confused army doctor. John rises to his feet as well and reaches forward, "No! That isn't it at all! Sherlock, I-." Before John can even touch him, Sherlock has moved and is quickly walking to his room. A hand comes up and wipes across an angular face and John realizes that Sherlock is crying. A door is slammed and John is left alone.
Sherlock never had friends outside of his blades. Each insult hurled his way caused him to become reacquainted with his poisonous friends. He hates himself and now he has decided to end it. At age 19 Sherlock takes out his razor blade and cuts as deep as he can. He can feel the blood oozing out of the deep incision and he laughs. He finally feels relief. He finally believes that it will all be over, but right before he passes out he hears his name being called. Sherlock couldn't really care at this point and closes his eyes with a deep satisfied smile.
When Sherlock finally opens his eyes, the first thing he sees is a sleeping John Watson laying across the hospital bed at an awkward angle with one hand clutching tightly to his own. At a first glance, Sherlock could tell that John hadn't been sleeping well or left his side much at all. A small smile spreads across the detective’s face as he looks at his caring doctor. The next thing Sherlock notices is the striking red thread connecting himself to the man in front of him. His smile broadens and brightens due to the proof burning brightly between the two hands.
"There was always someone else! Moriarty's web had spread all across the globe. I have fought to make my way back home. I've just finished. If I could have gotten home sooner I would have taken it, but, while there was another member still alive, you and everyone else remained at risk. I couldn't come back until it was all taken care of."
How is it that five little words could make him feel as if his entire world were crashing to the ground and then proceed to freeze over, coating everything in sheets of ice? That shouldn't be possible, but Sherlock feels as the room had suddenly dropped twenty degrees and he involuntarily shivers. '
When both men shake their heads Grace informs the two men that she will be making her rounds to her other patients, but not to hesitate to find another nurse or the nursing station if they have any questions. With an assurance to do so, Grace leaves the two men alone.
John thinks with a sneer. Unbeknownst to John, inside of 221B, Jim Moriarty sits talking with the armature detective.
Of course nothing can be hidden from Mycroft Holmes. He noticed instantly that something was amiss and whilst Sherlock was distracted, he had a member from the staff to go through Sherlock's things. They found the blades and brought them to Mycroft. When Mycroft had discovered what Sherlock had done, the resulting row was legendary. Mycroft threatened to have him servalenced for every hour on end, he berated Sherlock most of the time, and finally asked him, "What in the hell are you thinking?!" For the first time during the argument, Sherlock looks up at him. "I was thinking that I hate my life, I hate myself, and no one else likes me either. I'm tired of living this way." Mycroft looks at Sherlock with stunned silence and Sherlock walks away.
Sherlock can’t help the smile that spreads across his face as he rolls his eyes, and after a moment, nods his head. John retrieves his mobile out of his pocket, and with a brilliant smiled aimed at his detective, he dials Greg’s number. As the conversation ends, the blogger and detective go to get ready for the evening ahead.
Unfortunately the trial goes about the way Sherlock had believed it would. Moriarty has bribed the jury and thus escapes Scot free. '
Trigger Warnings for this chapters: I don't think there are any? If you see any, please, please let me know!
He follows the red thread until he stops suddenly outside the closed, solid door separating the two soul mates together. He takes in a deep breath before opening the barrier.
What’s worse is that John promised Sherlock that nothing would change, but obviously, everything has. There have been no cases, no late-night chases, no cancelled plans at the last minute because, “A suspect is getting away,
UGH. I need to stop now, or I'll just rant about this until the character limit. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this chapter. Happy reading!
The tears seemed to be endless as they kept falling from John's eyes. Sherlock's brow furrows as he contemplates John's obvious distress. '
Notes: I know I promised Angst, but I couldn't resist this! I had to do this! I'm not going to reveal my plans for the next chapter. I'm going to leave you wondering.
John could feel the butterflies threatening to wage war on his insides at what Sherlock’s words could imply. However, the detective’s reaction is…off. ‘
He squints into the dim light of the sitting room to the clock on the microwave as he realizes Mrs. Hudson will be bringing Rosie up in only a few hours. He may as well get some sleep while he can. He sighs as he slowly begins the trek up to his own room. With Rosie downstairs and Sherlock’s drunken mumblings so fresh in his mind, his room feels lonelier than it has in a long time.
Millions of  people lined up to participate in the machine’s debut. Initially, the campaign stated that every emotion would be extracted individually, sorted, and then bottled for the donor and consumer’s convenience. When the Donors finished the extraction process, they would be given a little black, unmarked pill, which would then restore the missing emotions over the span of one week. The process was executed flawlessly. Little black pills were administered, bottled emotions could be purchased, the economy was once again booming, and Pathogens Incorporated was reaping in the benefits. Everyone, except the temporarily emotionless individuals, seemed to be, overall, happier.
He holds her close and hugs her tightly as a small smile spreads across his face. He shuts his eyes to savor the moment just a little bit longer as she continues to softly giggle against his ear. He re-opens his eyes and as he goes to look at his young daughter, he catches a glimpse of Sherlock just over her shoulder, smiling softly at the scene playing out in front of him. His verdigris eyes look on with so much adoration and love, but it still feels bittersweet. The same sadness from before is evidently there.
' doctors that he was fit to go home but they only ignored him. Him! The bestest-est consulting detective in the
The two pairs of threadmates each climb into one of Mycroft’s cars and then they are whisked away to the Register’s office. When they finally arrive, the four men walk into the building. The ceremony was performed by a civil Marriage Officer, a professional looking man with a kind smile, and after all the correct paper work was filed, the proceedings were finished off with a loving kiss shared by the enamored pair.
Out of all the things he expected to come out of cupid bowed lips, that was not one of them. John stares in bewilderment as he stutters out, “I...uh…w-what?” The sleuth lets out a quivering breath and turns red-rimmed eyes on his blogger, “I said I’m sorry. You do know how I hate repeating myself.” The younger man was clearly trying to lighten the situation with humor, but it became obvious that he failed miserably as his tears began to fall.
"I took Gregory out to our favorite restaurant, treated him to anything he could want, and proposed. He said yes." All of this was said with an abnormally fond smile from Mycroft Holmes.
As Sherlock goes to move away, John gently takes Sherlock’s larger hand into his own and tilts his head to the sofa. Sherlock’s blush grows two shades darker and the mop of raven curls bob up and down before leading the way. Sherlock takes one end of the sofa, trying to put as much space between himself and John, but John is having none of it. He sits close enough that the other man can feel the heat coming off of him, but far enough away to remain a semblance of friendly distance.
Most people would have assumed, when hearing the wonderful news, that John was the one that had proposed but they would, of course, have been wrong. Sherlock had been thinking about this for a few months, and when he was injured he had had plenty of time to formalize the thoughts into some semblance of order.
"Sherlock, you do realize when I said what I had said, that I was rambling, and didn't really mean what I was saying, don't you?" Sherlock doesn't answer, doesn't turn around, yet, he has stopped playing his violin momentarily. "I was embarrassed and felt as if you didn't care about me at all. I had started spouting random things from the top of my head."
He stops at the door. He remembers the last time he was here and what followed afterwards. He hesitatingly pushes the door open and walks quietly to the bed.
Two weeks passed and none of the emotions had yet to return to the donors. Riots broke out outside of the sleek company’s headquarters during the third week, and by the end of the month, Pathogens Incorporated requested time to solve the issue and patience from the general public. On January 1st, 1995, Pathogens Inc. released a statement to the general public that stated:
Much later, after many of the guests have gone, Sherlock and John return back to Backer Street to pack their belongings. Once everything was packed, the honeymooners boarded a plane to set off for Italy.
Ok, in the first few paragraphs, I've written it kind like Sherlock is telling the story (sorta). I've meant to write bestest-est because I wanted Sherlock to appear child-like in his medicated state. As promised Fluff. :D (even though it's tainted with a bit of angst. Not much, but some :/) If you can't tell, out of every character in the series, Sherlock is my favorite. So, I have a thing for crying Sherlock. When I read fics like that, it rips my heart out so, I had to share it with you all :D I hope you like the chapter! :D
When the consulting detective steps into the room, he is met with Ms. Donovan's "lovely" voice declaring, "The
Notes: And this concludes this story! Thank you to the ones who stuck with me to the end! You've been wonderful! I've got another story in the works. I wanna write a Disney/Sherlock crossover. I'm getting excited about it. I think I'm only going to post that one when I finish it, though. I'm a freshman in college now. It's going to be hard to find time to write, but I hope you will like it! Again, I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
The cold, morgue equipment and tools have been removed and replaced by a medium sized table adorned with a scarlet table cloth, a lit candle, two chairs, Sherlock’s violin, and a music stand. John then turns to the tense consulting detective and beams happily as he throws his arms around his soul mate. “Sherlock, this is wonderful! Not that I’m not grateful, but what’s all this for?”
Here were some of my thoughts while writing this chapter : "John, hunny, why do I write you this way (this is rhetorical, mind you, but I still question my sanity)?" and "I hate myself." That last one was very prominent. I thought that a lot during the wedding. I don't like Mary. It was so freeing to write John in this way. Where he finally just stops. It was freeing. It was like a catharisis. I felt my soul rising above the depths of hell from which I came. Sherlock is so sad and smol. He is just not doing well.
Speaking of his loyal blogger, where was he? He was sure he had specifically told him he was dying and needed nourishment! He looked around the room and saw his phone lying only inches away. Sherlock giggled again. Of course! The solution is so clear! If John wasn't here it was because he didn't receive any of the messages Sherlock sent. He picks up his phone, scrolls down to John's name, types out a text, and hits send.
He can try to convince himself that everything is alright, or that he hasn’t completely broken some unspoken trust Sherlock has placed in him, but the lies he tells himself all come to a screeching halt one night, when John's eyes flash open and he rises quickly out of bed screaming due to nightmares of gangly, pale limbs that are crumbled, crushed that mingle with the odd sensation of falling.
John’s tramps down has anger as he calmly states, “Right… Well, we must be going. Come on, Sherlock.” Wilkes laughs and his reply is lost as the blogger and sleuth make their way through the crowded club. When they retrieve the intoxicated D.I. they exit the establishment and a familiar black car is waiting on the curb. As soon as they all get inside, the car takes off. Throughout the entire ride, John tries to talk to his love, but Sherlock only stares off into the distance in a trance. Greg, on the other hand would not shut up. When the ride finally ends for Sherlock and John, the sleuth exists quickly while the blogger talks to the chauffer.
Suddenly, John hears a snort of laughter as Sherlock howls his amusement at John’s apparent despair, twin tear tracks stream down the Consulting Detective’s cheeks in his mirth. John steps forward and it is only then that he notices that the clock has stopped counting down and is, in fact, stuck between 1:28 and 1:29. Sherlock continues to cackle in shamefully present glee as John rants and raves about the detective’s awful prank.
-QueenLadyAnne, my extraordinary Beta that was sick this week and a bit of last that still powered through to help with this final chapter.
ignoring John, he would have to admit, if only to himself, that John could possibly get that idea due to Sherlock’s lack of appearances. Sherlock knew John’s nightmares are back. The walls were terribly thin and John’s room was directly above his. It wasn’t a hard thing to deduce, but Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to care at the moment.
The case ends with a bullet piercing through glass then embedding into a decaying body, a whispered name, a dead cabbie, and giggles behind yellow police tape. They had a moment where both men looked at the other and all laughter had ceased. Sherlock cleared his throat and looked away. John felt his face heat up with the realization that he had began leaning forward. His entire body went rigid and the cold truth seeped into him when he realized that he was thoroughly enamored by this captivating man. '
The shocked blogger sits staring blankly at his devoted detective, but after several long moments of silence pass, and Sherlock still hasn’t received an answer, he slowly gets to his feet and begins withdrawing in on himself. The discouraged detective slowly mumbles out, “It’s alright John. We don’t have to get married. We can forget all about it and---.” The loyal army doctor cuts his soulmate off by grabbing him by his hand and tugging him down onto his lap. Their foreheads touch and John, softly smiling, whispers against his threadmate’s lips, “Yes. You mad berk. Yes.” Sherlock doesn’t know who’s crying, but when the pair kiss, it’s watery and interrupted periodically with beaming smiles and small laughs of pure euphoria. After taking a cab back to Baker Street, the pair fall into bed together kissing languidly (which are broken just long enough to whisper terms of endearment between the infatuated pair before they come together again for another loving embrace).  Soon eyes grow heavy and the couple is snuggled closely together, sharing air and contented smiles.
On a different note... I have finally seen the first episode of Sherlock season 3. I already hate Mary and I believe something is fishy about her -.- (that could just be because she is interrupting my Johnlock but I think there is something else). I'm not spoiling the first ep. for anyone who hasn't seen it so, don't post spoilers (if you can refrain from doing so. It is very hard I know ;) )!
Mr. Watson somehow always retained the mental capacity to hide the evidence of his abuse. Even under the influence of alcohol, he knew to aim harsh hands under clothing. Teachers never called home. Problem solved.
Anyway, Next couple of chapters: More angst. If you have been keeping up with the progression of cases, then you will notice what will be next. This story will not be season three compatible. I don't like Mary. At ALL and I refuse to add her in here. She will only be mentioned in passing or if mentioned, as a way to get over what is about to happen. I will make references to some things that have happened in season three, but nothing more. Thank you to all my readers and followers! I hope you like the story so far!
’ whatever the hell that means. Sherlock quickly jumps tracks and begins talking rapidly about Charles Augustus Magnussen. John’s still stuck on the girlfriend thing. The former blogger would love to question Sherlock further about Janine and the extent of their relationship, but it is in that moment Magnussen makes an appearance at 221B Baker Street.
"John stares fixedly at Sherlock's face. To Sherlock, it looks as if John is trying to gauge his wounds or memorize his face. Sherlock doesn't think he has ever felt more vulnerable. When their eyes meet John closes his eyes and visibly starts to shake. He sinks into the chair that is placed conveniently next to the bed and places his head in his hands.
By the time John finished his tirade, he was panting and his face was red, but as his dark blue eyes bore into Sherlock's watery, verdigris gaze, a voice in his head
Sherlock turns excited eyes toward his bemused soulmate. The excited detective’s face lights up as he explains the tours they would be taking and of a crime that he had been keeping an eye on. As he finished his eager speech, he realizes that honeymoons are about relaxing and sex. While Sherlock smiles at the last thought (having decided he is quite ready to give himself fully to his husband) but fidgets anxiously as he comes to the conclusion that going to crime scenes would be far from relaxing.
Mary’s face, in turn, twists into a murderous glower as she promises, “Oh, don't worry, then. That won't take very long at all,
Sherlock denies Irene’s plea for protection but would later rescue her from a terrorist cell in Pakistan and then cut all ties with the mysterious woman. Mycroft tells John of Irene’s ‘death’ and John lies about her passing to spare Sherlock’s feelings. Which is ridiculous. She was a challenge, and nothing more. John had some misconception that Sherlock had feelings about the woman. Which is, again, another ridiculous statement due to the fact that Sherlock
John’s heart hammers in his chest as he immediately asks, “Mary, thank god. Where’s Sherlock? Are you both okay?”
So, John returns back to the military and school to further pursue his career as an army surgeon. After he finishes all of his courses, he is finally a certified military physician. After the small ceremony concludes, his commander comes up to him to talk about shipping him off to Afghanistan for the next 8 years. John, excitingly agrees. He doesn’t know what will happen in that time period, but he is extremely happy with all of the doors that have opened up for him.
Sherlock's hands grab John's hips and begin to move downward until he reaches the waistband of John's pants. He teases his fingertips under the cloth and John gets the hint and raises up slightly to take them off. When he is completely bare, John reaches downward, and silently asks for permission. When he receives another small nod, he gently pulls the pants off and they land somewhere on the floor in the darkened corner.
.’ As John made his way to the breadbox, he checked the empty container only to remember that he had made the last piece of toast yesterday. The blogger’s patience, which had long since been exhausted, finally snapped as Sherlock made his way down the stairs, only in their sheet, and over to the couch to bemoan loudly that he was bored.
The blogger’s shoulders sag as the anger that once burned so intently leaves as quickly as it appeared. Confusion quickly overtakes him; however, as he gazes down at the consulting detective’s once proud frame. The confident, hard lines of Sherlock’s body are gone and they leave behind this fragile creature in their place. A shocked, “What did you say?” now hangs between the pair.
but, not unproductive. The first two weeks while John was away at the surgery, were spent furiously trying to find the perfect way to propose to his extraordinary blogger. He knew that he was an uneasy man to live with and wanted to make this the best he could so that his lovely doctor would say yes.
As the three of them shuffle into Sherlock’s private room (no doubt due to Mycroft’s influence), John felt his knees weaken when he finally lays eyes on the sleeping detective. Mycroft uncharacteristically lets relief overwhelm his facial features as he walks forward and lays a gentle hand on top of the younger brother’s head. He bends down and whispers something to the younger man that John cannot hear, and smiles when Sherlock unconsciously leans into his brother’s touch. The nurse breaks the moment as she softly clears her throat. Mycroft inclines his head as if to signal the others to follow him out into the hall so as to not disturb Sherlock. When they are away from the detective the nurse begins informing the two men what was being done to help Sherlock: “Hello, gentleman, my name is Grace and I will be Sherlock’s primary nurse. Mr. Holmes has approximately thirty shallow cuts on his left wrist, which travel up and down his arm, and a laceration on his left forearm, which is about 18 inches long. We stitched up the big gash and gave him some antibiotics to try and ward off infection. Also, we found traces of cocaine in his system, which he is sleeping off now. We want to keep him for 72 hours under observation. Any questions?”
Days would turn into months, which would include many 'dark moods', slamming doors, midnight chases through the alleyways of London, and a vindictive man named Moriarty. Things had been going great until John becomes a hostage to a crazed psychopath at a pool. When John first steps out into view, and Sherlock's eyes meet his, he can see a flash of hurt and anger before Sherlock's face blanks entirely. Moriarty steps out, Sherlock slowly exhales but no other sign of relief is shown. John reveals then that he is wrapped in explosives and from then, it is a battle of wits to see who would escape alive.
) until Mycroft cuts in: “Excellent! Now, Sherlock, go grab a few things, and then we will be off.” As Sherlock reluctantly goes to comply, John follows him into their bedroom.
Throughout Sherlock's little speech John's heart steadily sinks to the pit of his stomach. Along with the feeling of despair, comes the all consuming sense of rage. "Ignore them. Ignore them as if they don't matter?! That's
Sherlock keeps his face carefully blank as joy blooms within his chest but he allows his left hand to reach across the seat to grab John smaller hand in his own. The rings weigh heavily in his pocket and to himself from fiddling with the box, he traces the army doctor’s knuckles.

were being particularly cruel, he came home crying. Sherlock took up his place in front of his bathroom mirror and looked on in disgust. He looked at his red rimmed eyes, flushed cheeks, wild, untenable hair and
And just like that, John’s heart begins racing. He leans back enough to put space between them as he mutters out unintelligently, “I... uh… I think you should get some rest, Sherlock.”
Notes: It's taken me forever but here it is! I hope you like it! My Beta was having computer troubles and I had to do a quick look through myself, so if you see any mistakes, they are mine. Don't be shy, point them out! :D Chapter 18 is in the works. 18 will be wedding and the rating will most likely go up.
Of course nothing lasts forever. A few inches away, on Sherlock's night stand, lay his phone which pings only once. When he picks it up a message appears on the screen, from a familiar number, indicating to him that it is unanswered. He clicks the message and it sends a cold chill down his spine
Nothing can stay hidden forever, no matter how much it is wished, because just two months later John became aware of Sherlock's dark past. The day had started off normally. They had received a text from Lestrade asking for assistance with a '
That’s what this is, isn't it? Sherlock loves him. He is willing to lose everything for John...because he
!" Sherlock hisses as he tries to twist out of John's firm grasp. "No!" John bellows, "Not until you explain what these are!"
John exits the bed for a moment only to return with a wet flannel in order to clean both of them up. When he is finished he tosses the flannel onto the floor and curls up beside a contented Sherlock. Sherlock turns onto his side and buries his face into the crook of John's neck. The blogger drags the satisfied detective closer and wraps his arms around a thin waist.
how badly Sherlock’s death affected him the first time around, yet she murdered him in cold blood. After finding out that Mary was the one to kill his best friend and Magnussen, he could not even bear to look at her. John collected Sherlock and he left as quickly as possible. He refused to answer any calls, he refused to reply to texts, and he
So, it was my intention to create an absolute batshit crazy Mary. I wanted her to seem insane. I hope I succeeded. As Sherlock said, "Bitterness is a paralytic. Love is a much more vicious motivator. I had the idea swirling around in my head that Mary, while incredibly smart and cunning, and...well, EVIL, could become just as sentimental and sloppy when it came to love as Irene was. That's how she eventually lost the game, and ultimately, Mary loses to it as well.
John, now five, and Harry, a rambunctious six-year-old, lived happily with their grandmother until she became ill and perished that same year. Mr. Watson arrives at the funeral—completely sloshed—to pick up his children. The grieving children silently cry in the taxi on the way to their new home. When they finally arrive, Mr. Watson walks into his home and promptly passes out on the couch leaving the two children bereft and alone. Everything they knew and loved was gone. Everything they had was placed in two large suitcases. Life as they knew it was over. Harry turned to John and envelops him in a warm hug and whispers, “Shh, Johnny, it’ll be alright. We’ll be okay. He’s our Da, yeah? He’ll take care of us! Everything is going to be alright, just you wait and see!”
here!" He ignores them as his mind quickly switches over to case mode. He takes in the room before him, noting the four sobbing family members in the corner currently being questioned by another member of Scotland Yard, deducing with an intelligence that could rival the deity Mímir(1), before turning to the body which was lying lifelessly, face down on the floor. '
Everything for John suddenly slams to an abrupt stop. His heart lurches in his chest as he takes in the other man’s quiet words. How anyone, especially John himself, could think Sherlock as being a cold machine is beyond John’s comprehension. He regrets ever insinuating that he ever believed it to be true. But no more. This would end today. John sits down in front of the detective on the coffee table and prepares himself for the discussion that needed to happen from the beginning.
Sherlock laughs but it sounds broken and dry. "I owe you no explanation." Sherlock is finally able to twist away and he is he turns away from John, hunches his shoulders, and ducks his head. "If you are too incompetent to conceive what these..
Notes: I used a LOT of "Study is Pink" references, so, be mindful of that. I manipulated the text in order to fix the story line. I hope you like them so far! Oh, and next chapter THERE WILL BE ANGST! Sherlock cries and may seem about OOC but I will explain what that is about at the end notes at the next one. This one will have a bunch of chapters. I believe even more than my last one had. Oh, and before I forget, Updates will be Mondays and Fridays!
He awoke one morning to a cheery bright sky, which only served to dampen his mood further. In a last attempt to find a semblance of peace, he took a slow paced walk to the park. While there, he had met an old friend that had studied with him at St. Barts. They began reminiscing about old memories. When questioned about his life, John had replied that he had been looking for a flatshare that would be affordable but "Who would want me for a flatmate?" Mike took one look at the shell of a man and laughed. "You are the second person who has said that to me today."
Victoria (Mia) Grayson (she was the brilliant individual that helped me come up with the story title! It was so clever that I freaked out when she said it)
Despite himself, John can feel laughter bubble up inside him. He turns his head to hide his grin but his shoulders shake with silent mirth. Much later, the blond man would realize that that was the point of this entire endeavor.
As John leaves that evening to return to the house he now shares with Mary, best man now confirmed, the thoughts and doubts he has been denying spring to the front of his mind. Not for the first time, does John realize how wrong this all feels. Yes, by proposing he is making a promise to Mary. He is promising to love and care for her, but it all feels so dishonest. Marriage is the ultimate sign of love and devotion, but how can he truly love Mary fully when Sherlock is alive? He only started dating Mary to begin with as a distraction.
by telling him that he is a freak? I’m sure that got the message across. Sherlock doesn’t have friends, Doctor Watson. He only has you. He cares about your opinion, but as I’ve always said: caring is not an advantage and you’ve just proven my point.”
When John tries to interject, Mycroft quickly cuts him off, “Fix this. I have warned you before and believe me when I say this, John, but you will not like me as an enemy. Continue on as you have and that’s exactly what I will become.” With that ominous threat, the line goes dead.
John slammed the breadbox closed, ignoring Sherlock’s raised eyebrow, and stomped up the stairs to get dressed. The doctor, just to spite the detective, slowly put his clothes on and calmed down slightly in the process. When he finally made his way down the stairs, Sherlock had put on his signature coat and scarf and was waiting impatiently by the door, and, as soon as the detective saw the blogger, he was out the door making his way quickly down the stairs to hail the cab. John can’t help but huff out an amused laugh, anger momentarily forgotten, as he makes his way down the stairs after his madman of a lover.
Sherlock gathers the little one close to his chest as he sinks down onto the sitting room rug. He pulls out several of her toys and lays them out to pick the first game they will begin playing together. Instantly, she reaches for her favorite blocks and begins constructing fantastical buildings as she explains each building's purpose in excited gibberish. Sherlock nods his head seriously as if whatever she is saying is the utmost truth. They play for a few hours together building tall towers only for the excited toddler to knock it down in a fit of giggles with Sherlock’s own low rumble mixing in.

in fact have a heart and it had been currently wrapped in explosives. When they had effectively escaped, and returned safely back to Baker Street, it really wasn't surprising how they eventually got together. John and Sherlock both lunged at the other in a flurry of limbs which resulted in tangled appendages and clashing teeth. When they had finally calmed down, it was decided that they would continue with this relationship albeit a bit slowly. Sherlock was unused to the sensation of having a real relationship and John had to get over the fact that he was now with a man.
him!.” She laughs without humor as she begins walking around the Consulting Detective’s bound body, “To find out he felt the same was just simply perfect, though! I knew just how to break you just as you broke me. I knew how to bring the mighty, indifferent Sherlock Holmes to his knees, and it was so easy!”
“My love… No. Sebastian hasn’t changed the way I feel for you. I’m so sorry that I didn’t stand up for you. I made a disastrous decision and I will regret that for the rest of my life. You are first and foremost the most important thing in my life. You will always come first. I love you for you. That is what I was trying to convey to you this morning. I thought that keeping silent would have been more beneficial to you. I’m sorry you went to school with such ignorant pricks that could not see all of the beauty you posses. You are so good, Sherlock. I’m so proud of who you are and what you’ve survived through. You’ve come back to me and for that, I will be forever grateful. In all honesty, love, I don’t deserve you.”
On the first night, he was plagued with nightmares; each horrid dream was played on a constant, endless loop of Sherlock’s agonized face. When the second day came and went, John began calling, searching frequently visited places, and asking around if anyone had seen the detective, but came up empty handed. John called the ebony haired man’s phone for the one-hundredth time that evening without getting an answer. The nightmares never ceased and as John watched the sun rise on the third day, he finally swallowed his pride and called Mycroft Holmes.
Under the detective’s scrutinizing gaze, John fidgets and drops his own gaze to the floor, “I just…want to make up for yesterday, love. I never meant to hurt you. I just love you so much and I never meant to make you feel as though I’m ashamed of you. I’m so proud of you. You’re so smart and generous and compassionate. You love me for me—scars and all—and I don’t deserve you, so I want to show you that you are my entire world.” John moves from his position on the bed and crawls over to his soulmate and straddles his thighs, “So, please, let me make this up to you, my love.” The good doctor kisses his detective sweetly, “Please let me show you how much I adore you.”
When the rings do arrive, Sherlock receives a text from Mycroft that says he will be visiting sometime later that day. John is currently wrapped tightly around the excited detective and has yet to be roused. Sherlock slowly extracts himself from John's warm embrace and makes his way to the kitchen.
Finding a wedding ring wasn't easy. The selection seemed to be limitless, but the raven haired man knew his soulmate preferences so it was at least easier to narrow down. He finally settled on the glistening band made from titanium because he knows John wouldn't something too flashy or ornate. The titanium band would clearly display John's marital status but wouldn't damage easily or dent when he was either running after Sherlock or in the surgery. Yes, the bands are perfect, but,
didn’t hear anything from you or about you until just recently. An officer came by and said that you were shot…Harry couldn’t take it. She thought she knew what it meant when another soldier arrived at the door...She stormed off before she heard that you would be okay…I—I found her the next morning in the bathroom. She was so, so pale. Her skin looked blue, and I just…I knew.” Here she pauses momentarily to compose herself, unsuccessfully, before continuing, “Later, the mortician stated that Harry overdosed on synthetic happiness.” Clara’s face morphs into a tight, agonized expression as she chokes out, “I had to
In the end, Moriarty was right. He is weak. Spineless. Ordinary. He is no better than the rest of the masses. His self-hatred only mounts as he climbs the seventeen steps leading up to the flat. He is met with benighted halls and deafening silence.
John looks utterly miserable as he recounts so many terrible memories, “For the longest time, I thought I had drove you to suicide. The things I told you were awful and I thought I just added to the fact. That guilt and the pain of having you gone was proving to be too much.” Sherlock’s distress is palpable at John’s retelling, but before he can say anything, John fully laces his fingers between Sherlock’s own and continues, “But then I met Mary. She arrived in my life when I needed someone, and yes, in a way, I loved her, but then this lanky git of a detective appears out of nowhere for the second time to change my world entirely. Yes, Sherlock. You’re right. In a way, I was happy, I was trying to make the most out of my new half-life. I was trying desperately to move on, but then you came back to me and I no longer need to. Do you understand what I’m trying to say, Sherlock?”
At Anderson's outburst Sergeant Donovan flounces into the room but stops as Anderson had, before snidely commenting, "I pity the poor soul bound to you! Who the hell would want the heartless
,” Mary says with a sickened expression. “It’s pathetic, really. You never even realized that it was me! Even after I shot the man we both love,” she exclaims gesturing to the unconscious man.
This particular case ends with an explosion and a quick, reflexive move on John's part that plunges both, blogger and detective, into the icy waters of the pool. When both heads resurfaced, all that remained on the scene was blackened scorch marks and bits of debris floating in the water.
He flips past the first twenty pages, and nestled among the hollowed crevices, lies a little black box containing one final dosage of Apathy. He quickly rolls up his sleeves, takes his belt, tightens the makeshift tourniquet, and inject the needle into a vein without any hint of hesitation. He just needs the pain to stop for a little while. He won’t become addicted again. He can handle it this time. He just needs to forget for a little while.
Sherlock enters 221B with a flourish of his coat and a dramatic entrance. Only….he has no audience. '
Alcohol is definitely one of life’s greater blessings. Especially when one Sherlock Holmes is reduced to a giggling, bubbly mess. Sherlock is a very happy drunk. Well, this isn’t exactly news. The Stag Night fiasco was proof enough that Sherlock was a delightfully silly human being when absolutely sloshed. Tonight is no different. Sherlock sits in his signature black chair, the death frisby of a hat perched haphazardly atop his riotous curls as John giggles against his fist at something the detective says, but he can't quite remember what it was. An impish grin spreads across John's face as he peers closely at his dear friend. Sherlock giggles madly when John informs him that he looks marvelous in the hat.
Also: my beta told me that I was too repetitive with their names, however, I was afraid I was being too repetitive with everything else... so, hopefully this is a little better?
Special Thanks: QueenLadyAnne, my lovely Beta, who keeps reassuring me and giving me wonderful advice, and all my reviewers and commenters. You guys seriously make my day! :D
Lance Corporal James Mortimer of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers was lying on the scorching desert sands, bleeding out from a wound to his abdomen. John rushed over to the dying soldier and applied pressure to the wound and began digging out his supplies in order to patch him up. As John began applying the last stitch to the soldier’s now marred skin, a shot rings out, and a kneeling army doctor falls forward and clutches his injured shoulder.
He had been missing for three days now. Nothing in the flat had been moved, but John had discovered, upon returning to the flat, a few changes. The microwave had been scoured and cleaned of all experiments, case files no longer littered the floor, and milk and bread were now stocked inside their respective places. John had tried and failed many times to contact Sherlock, to find some way to apologize, to somehow make this right, but no calls were going through. Three days, and there was still no sign of Sherlock. ‘
She stops right in front of his chair, climbs up, and straddles his lap. She leans forward and begins softly kissing the detective’s neck as he squirms to get away. She continues unperturbed, “The sex with John was good, though. We had some pretty wild nights.” She smiles darkly at the detective, knowing her words are like knives, but she continues anyway, “All I had to put up with was your name being screamed out as John fitfully slept with his nightmares. What’s a few sleepless nights on my part when, in the end, I got to watch your face crumble when John told me he loved me? John chose me over you.Just like that. I easily took the one thing you thought you could never have, and all I had to do was sway my hips and play the sympathetic, understanding card and he was mine. That must hurt a lot, doesn’t it? Knowing that you are only second best?” She leans back and she pouts as her eyes appear doleful and sympathetic until she smiles brightly and states, “You can always change your mind, though. You can always pick me. I know it will take time, but you could eventually love me. John doesn’t have to know.” She leans forward until their noses are almost touching whilst simultaneously managing to undo three of his shirt buttons as her other hand travels down and unbuttons his trousers until Sherlock’s squirming made it impossible to continue. She pulls away and looks at Sherlock expectantly.

So, I know last chapter I said it would be wedding time... I lied a bit. I started thinking of how cool it would be to write in a Stag Night... The story began writing itself and I got swept away with a certain idea. Next chapter is definitely wedding (and possibly honeymoon). :)
" Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you—" Before John can finish asking his question, a mousy looking women enters in with coffee and a burning face as she approaches the mysterious man. The man in question dismisses the poor girl and she leaves with a soft sigh.
thread with his eyes, and noticed that the same red cord was attached to the shattered man just a few feet away from him. He closed his eyes briefly, but when he opened them again the threads were gone.
If you would ask John, his instant response would be that he, “is a creepy bugger,” and he would then quickly change conversation onto something much more pleasant. Magnussen is the epitome of a disturbed megalomaniac. Sherlock is, of course, very horrified but intrigued by the other man. Maybe that is why Sherlock stormed headfirst into the businessman’s office under the ruse of proposing to Janine (John, of course, is silently
Each soul is connect by a single red thread that never breaks and would cause extreme heartache to the soul’s whose mates died.

that there is something else seriously wrong that has nothing to do with being undercover. Deep down, although he would never admit it out loud, he knows that it has something to do with him. It doesn’t take a genius to realize that the timing is no coincidence. John’s no longer at Baker Street. The flat is cold and empty and Sherlock is alone once more. Without being told in so many words, John knows Sherlock’s life is a lonely one. He had admitted on several instances that John is his only friend.

"Yes, and I believe that I should mention now, that I know about your feelings for me, and what they entell. I may not currently understand what I have done to deserve these feelings, but with time, I am sure that the emotion will become clear.

John's hands soon move upward until he can bury them in ebony curls to draw the man above him in a sensual kiss. The observant man then moans when John's questing hands make their way downward to land on the Sherlock's backside which he gently squeezes. Long violinist fingers trace down a toned chest and continue their exploratory quest downward until Sherlock's skilled hands began fiddling with the waistband of John's pants. The kiss is broken once more as John looks searchingly at his threadmate as if to ask one last time,
