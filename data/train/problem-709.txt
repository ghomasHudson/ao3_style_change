John clears his throat, still feeling the sides of Sherlock's neck. "Um, well they... they always have each other's backs..."
"He's just in here."
Mycroft knew all he could do now was wait for the seizure to pass, but that didn't make it any easier. Watching his brother - usually so cool and collected - jerk uncontrollably on the floor dragged a lump from his stomach to his throat; he often found himself breathing rapidly with panic, but desperate to keep a calm facade for when Sherlock would wake. He couldn't help it. He loved his brother as any decent sibling should, and any suffering that befell him would be felt threefold in his heart.
"Holmes –"
The first was seemingly harmless. It must have been about a case, because John heard his friend mutter things like "obvious" and "phone," and then sometimes he would twist and turn like a criminal was getting away. John had smiled at this, wondering if he was in fact dreaming about their first case together, and began picturing himself the chases they had partaken in. However soon the first dream lapsed into the second - and the second was far more concerning.
"A week." He gnawed on his bottom lip. "You woke up yesterday, but I don't know if you remember much."
"Yes."
John frowns. "And?"
He hated him for it, but Mycroft was right. It could not look less good – John wasn't sure he had seen anything so 'not good' in all his life.
"That'll be for me to decide." He pointed to the bed. "In. Stop being dramatic and lay down."
Of course, we can't have that, can we? It's only right for Sherlock to reveal his ailment, publicly, in a very dramatic way. That's Sherlock's style, is it not?
"Come downstairs, I'll make you some."
like that.
"Sher -" John ran a hand through his hair, feeling the sweat that had collected on his hairline. "You never said - Are you supposed to be running around like this?"
"I'm fine," Sherlock croaked, and John huffed a laugh. He rushed off to grab his friend a glass of water, placing it carefully on the surface beside him and looking on endearingly as the brunette's eyes drooped. And then, without a single thought about what people might say, he climbed into the space beside him and settled down for a restless night.
Sherlock's back convulsed as another painful retch ripped through his throat, and he brought up another sweaty hand to cradle the toilet bowl, head almost disappearing completely as he brought up the rest of his meagre stomach contents. John rushed to his side, immediately placing a hand on his soaked t-shirt as the other student heaved again, his whole body lurching forward as more vomit hit the dirty water. "Shit, Sherlock," John cursed, rubbing his back in circles as each retch brought forth more bile. The poor boy was shaking violently when things began to calm, and he sat back on his knees, trying not to meet John's steady gaze.
Those sixteen minutes had been long and frantic. Molly had wrung the cloth despairingly each time, wiping the sweat from his brow and chest whilst her charge muttered insensibly. He was frightfully pale, emaciated – and for the first time, in all of Molly's stubborn optimism, she feared for his life.
It had all, horrifyingly, made sense. The cough that Sherlock had been struggling with for weeks suddenly didn't seem so much like a wintry cold anymore. The tightness in his chest that he'd assumed was a result of intense physical exertion became much darker, and more terrible. And the fatigue – the feverish, thick syrup that had been stuck between his eyes for over a month – no longer coincided so suitably with his frequent sleepless nights, or his busy, uninterrupted lifestyle. He had sought help for a supposed renal problem, and had received, instead, a pockmarked CT scan, six cycles of EP combo chemo, and a rather dismal prognosis.
"Uh... He's got, meningitis... I think it came on last night –" John frowned. "Wait, why are you asking me?"
. Looking after cancer patients was itself an emotionally and physically draining business – looking after
John Watson had been warned about Fresher's Flu, and as a budding medical student, had dismissed it with a scoff – but as he was now discovering, hangovers were no small deal. In fact, after six straight nights of hard-core drinking, John had awoken with both a spectacular headache and the taste of regurgitated jaeger in his mouth, and thus thanked the gods that both Sunday and Monday were void of lectures. He wasn't sure how much of a seminar he could absorb whilst this deep in his own woes.
"A medical student. Indeed," he clarified, marching quickly to the nearest table as he spoke. Once they were both situated across from each other, Sherlock placed his hands beneath his chin. "You're more intelligent than the average person, I can tell just by speaking to you. You agreed with my sentiments on Fresher's Week, which tells me you did not find the menial activities performed during that time at all interesting. Perhaps you are more acclimatised to a small social life – lots of studying, minimal procrastination – so, you took some demanding A-levels, such as Chemistry, and Biology, both renowned for their difficulty. Your nails are short – you've kept them so for practicals, and you eat a well-balanced meal, which suggests you are aware of your own health. Your bedside manner thus far has been impeccable – most with intent to pursue the medical career path have a kindness about them, I'm not sure why, but those who don't tend to struggle. And," he breathed quickly, finally pointing to John's rucksack, "
Watson, feeling now like a soldier again, shivered in the sudden wintry aspect of the room. His flannel nightshirt did nothing to shield him from the cold panic that rose, like a crescendo, from within. He tensed every muscle, felt the deep-rooted ache that was his sinew turning to ice. He wanted to reject the detective's statement, claim that he was, once more, being dramatic – but Sherlock Holmes' words felt inexplicably true. So, there was only one thing to say.
And then he'd taken a breath. And then another. And John looked up as he rushed clumsily over to the table and took up his inhaler. He quickly sprayed the corticosteroid into his mouth, pressing his left hand into the wood for support. He wheezed, trying to draw in a breath and then failing, returning to the inhaler once more, gasping, spraying -
“I… I…” I opened my mouth to speak, but my throat was dry and no sound came out. I was panicking, partly because I could finally look properly into John’s beautiful eyes, and partly because he was definitely mad at me.
this time would be a slow build. John’s stupidity had angered Sherlock, he would be mad for several days until that dreadful day when Sherlock would finally leave him. John felt something welling up in his chest, sadness? Self-hatred maybe. How could John be so foolish? Now Sherlock was going to leave him, he would not love John anymore.
He felt saved.
As our fame grew,
Listen I know I havent been starting on this for a bit of a while. I've probably just lost an amount of readers... but i will try to speed up and finish this asap
Sherlock smiled briefly. He muttered “Thanks, Mycroft.” before rushing out of the flat, into the cold winter streets.
“Says who?”
I opened my eyes wide at the familiar voice. It’s Mycroft.
“As you are spending longer time with him, you’re stepping into uncharted area. That scared you. You feel like you are losing control of your own body. Maybe you’ve taken your own pulse too, haven’t you, Sherlock?”
?” The foul breath of the pirates gushed into John’s nostrils, their words loaded with sarcasm.
were mad at me.”
John.” Sherlock said dramatically, while Mycroft was working on his chains. Once he was freed, he stumbled towards John and held his head in his hands. “Though I prefer a much better way of saying thank you.” And he kissed John.
For God’s sake, just take it to him. Ask him to solve it now.
. There was this man sitting beside me in the movies, constantly staring at me. That weirdo had absolutely ruined my date with Mary.
“Has that wound in your leg healed? Is it I who smacked your bone there? Does it hurt?” Moriarty pulled a face that sent chills down John’s spine. Those days were memories that he would never want to remember. “Did you wail like a baby when I tear your flesh apart? And those screams! What happy times! Did you miss me?” Moriarty laughed wickedly.
“But I could no longer find John. He had left my life ever since. I’ve wondered for countless times, whether he is happy now. I miss the amazing time when he and I shared a lot of blissful moments. And then, I was tired of the life on land, and I became a pirate. As I sail in the vast, vast oceans, I never yield my search for the right person to bring light and joy into my life again, just like how John once did.
The cold eyes on Mycroft’s face softened. “You have no idea, Doctor. Sherlock was not someone that one can easily stop worrying about.” Mycroft started fiddling with his suit when he thought of that painful history. “Some years ago Sherlock had serious things with drugs. He made himself inhuman. He made himself the psychopath he is now. But did you know, it was always I, who held him in my arms, he being unconscious in some back alleys, weak with drugs abuse? In normal days he shut everyone out. He shut
“ Why don’t we dance? “ Sherlock completely avoided the question as he got up to put his laptop on the table next to him. There was music playing. A smooth song that had violin and piano overlapping each other like waves in an ocean beautifully.
The pale man genuinely laughed at his joke and watched the flustered man storm out of the living room. He watched him angrily take out the groceries and did not bother to look back at the detective.
“ No! I’m not teaching you how to wank! “ John said quickly. He shut his eyes closed to block out images of Sherlock begging him to let him cum and calling him captain. John didn’t know why he was overreacting because he literally dreamed of Sherlock every single night for the last months! But, he honestly couldn’t believe that Sherlock asked him to help him. But on second thought, he would ask him to do something like this.
“ I'd be lying if I said that I didn't want to kiss you too. Was dancing with me an excuse to kiss me then? “ John said as he lifted the detective’s chin with his right hand. He smiled as he waited for his response. Sherlock tenderly rubbed John’s wrist as he still held it.
“ I never had lessons before. Though, I did enjoy dancing when I was younger” Sherlock said as he looked down at John to see his reaction. A warm smile crept onto John’s face and a chuckle illuminated out of him.
“ Um, I didn’t mean to do that, I'm sorry “ John said as he walked backwards and his hands left from the detective’s back. But, Sherlock quickly grabbed them to put them back at their original place. He held his wrists as he pulled John closer.
At this point, both were leaning in and staring at each other’s lips. Finally, at what seems to be ages; their lips collided into a soft kiss. Tongues softly caressing one another; Sherlock’s hands held John’s face softly. He wanted to kiss John for so long; sometimes, just to kiss the snarky remarks off his lips. Strong hands were placed at the small of his back and gripped at his blue robe he wears so often.
They had no cases today. It was supposed to be a relaxing day for the two men. John was worried that Sherlock might want to solve another case and overwork himself to death. But, John had begged him to take a day off since he was solving so many cases left to right. Sherlock was hesitant at first; however,he didn’t want his friend to be worried.
It was late in the afternoon as John opened the door to his flat and carried groceries into the kitchen. He sets them down on the kitchen counter that was filled with beakers and questioning liquids. But, John decided to ignore it and let Sherlock deal with his mess. He was just going to tell Sherlock to clean his mess; then, he finally heard violin playing. His flat mate was standing barefoot by the window with his violin in hand. Sherlock was playing a captivating song that sounded so sensuous yet sweet. His back was facing John and he couldn’t keep his eyes off him. John always adored when Sherlock played his violin. His eyebrows would furrow in concentration and he looked like he was at peace. The blonde man felt so light when he heard the younger man’s music.
Finally minutes after, John pulled out Sherlock's arse and threw away the used condom in a trash bin near the detective’s bed. Then, he went to fetch a wet rag to clean up all the dried cum on Sherlock’s stomach and dropped it in a clothes hamper. He laid down on the bed after and faced Sherlock. The pale man turned his body and cupped the flushed cheek of the blonde. Callused hands snaked over the dainty waist of the detective. He pulled them closer together and looked into each other’s eyes. The silence in the room was not awkward but….. content and calming. They both laid in each other’s warmth while they caressed their lover gently. Sherlock was the one to break the silence.
“ Well, well I didn't think you were actually going to do it. Such a good boy.“ John said as he trailed his fingers up the slim back of the detective. As an immediate reaction, Sherlock’s back arched like a bow and his chest was pressed against John’s broad chest. The delicate hands  gripped tighter into John’s shoulders.
John lowered his body to tease the flushed erection with his tongue as his fingers continued thrusting in and out of Sherlock. Swollen lips sucked the head of a shaking Sherlock and John dragged his tongue down the shaft. He swallowed all he could of Sherlock's cock and bobbed his head slowly. Moans escaped from the pale man as he laid his hands on the bed sheets for support.
Sherlock took a deep breath and exhaled heavily as he clenched his fists. His knuckles turned white while his nails stabbed through his skin and little dents left from this effect.
The blonde lowered himself to cage Sherlock and his arms instantly wrapped around his toned shoulders. John pulled out slowly and snapped his hips harshly with a loud smack against Sherlock’s arse.
“ Okay, take out your cock. “
“ Yes, John. ”
“ You’re really enjoying this aren’t you? “ Sherlock said between breaths. He felt the hot breath on his ear and reached over the blonde’s hair with his left hand. He lifts his head to hear what John has to say.
“ You heard me, Captain Watson. I have an erection and I need to get rid of it. ”
John laughed full wholeheartedly.
It was a quiet afternoon in the flat of the detective and the doctor. The sun casked its rays into the windows of the living room; it gave it a beautiful glow. Both of the men sat down in their respective chairs and sat in silence.
“Alright, are you going to tell me? “ There was a hint of confusion on the man’s face. He looked adorable.
“ Ask me to dance again, Sherlock if I get to kiss you each time.”
“ I need your help with something. “
A minute of silence passed before Sherlock sighed heavily and said :
The detective suddenly came up with a brilliant idea.
“ It's also a fun activity that sharpens the mind, eases anxiety,  builds social bonds- ”
Sherlock leaned down to his ear and said :
“Sherlock, ah you’re feel so good “ John said as he continued fucking him passionately. The man before him was shaking from pleasure. His mouth formed a ‘ o ‘ shape and eyes shut tightly with sweat layered on his skin. Moans were escaping from both of the men’s mouths.
“ I’ve considered every outing we had together as dates because my feelings towards you grew rapidly after you came into my life.” Sherlock said in a clear voice filled with confidence.
Slender hands gripped at the blonde’s hair as he continued to keep thrusting his fingers into the man before him. John scissored his fingers into the pale man as he looked up at his lover. Sherlock was shaking in pleasure and couldn’t wait for John. Then, he inserted a third finger and beads of precum leaked out Sherlock’s cock.
The whole article was basically listing all the benefits and wonders of dance. Despite the awful title, Sherlock was interested. As a child, he loved to dance and spin all around his room. He would always imagine himself dancing with a partner around in a big ballroom and everyone’s eyes were on them. It made him feel so light and happy. He would usually do it when he was alone; dancing was his guilty pleasure. Sherlock looked up from his laptop to see that John was still reading the newspaper. His eyebrows furrowed as he concentrated on whatever he’s reading. He looked adorable when he’s deeply focused on  something. Sherlock smiled and scrolled down the article:
“ Let us dance for eternity till  our feet bleed so i can hold you close ”
“ i-i’m close, too,” John said as he looked into those blue eyes filled with passion and love. He leaned in to kiss Sherlock as his left hand reached for the needy cock of the pale man. Tongues collided together into a wet, yet passionate kiss.
“Okay, what is it? “ John asked and looked at Sherlock into his blue-green eyes. He had crossed his arms and waited for the answer.
“ I love you Sherlock. “
The pale man finally looked up to see John’s face. His face was relaxed and unbothered. He was still reading the paper. Sherlock was intrigued; he didn’t think that John had taken lessons. He wonders if John’s any good at dancing; the detective wanted to know more. So, he asked another question.
John said as he towered over Sherlock and cupped his cheek. He wiped away a tear from the flushed face of Sherlock; the pale man wasn’t aware that he was tearing up. He leaned into the touch of the warm hand around his face and kissed John’s palm.
He grabbed the condom from the bed and ripped it with his teeth. John locked eyes with Sherlock as he did that whole moment. If his face could get any redder, he would be as red as a rose. John’s callused fingers rolled the condom on his erect penis and stroked himself with more lube.
“ Oh, J-John!  “ Sherlock said between breaths as John’s hands still held onto him. He gripped at the bed sheets with white knuckles. Sherlock was in complete shock from how good this feels. He looked up at the blonde; his eyes were closed shut and was panting with pleasure.
He stopped gazing at his flat mate and proceeded to think of a question so he could focus his mind on something else than drinking in Sherlock’s breathtaking features.
Sherlock sat there with his head down trying to get over the tingling sensations that he had experienced from his orgasm. He never knew it could be this heavenly. John let go of his dick and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist. He held the detective close; kisses were placed from  the bottom of his neck and ended up at his cheek.
“ Thank you, John “ Sherlock said quietly as they continued themselves perfectly as if it was routined.
He angled himself to hit the sweet spot of his lover that would bring him over the edge. Sherlock threw his head back with a loud moan and dragged his nails against the doctor’s back.  The sound of skin smacking with impact echoed off the walls of the room. Moans and gasps came from the men as they both tried to reach their climax.
“ It was waltz, and a bit of tango. I was told that I was acceptably good by my dance instructor. Why do you ask? “ John questioned as he looked in Sherlock’s eyes.  He seemed interested by the way he was looking at him. His full attention was on him and listening attentively to every detail.
“ Is this close enough, love?” John said as his left hand touched his side under his robe. It gave Sherlock shivers as he looked into his dark blue orbs.
“ Look at yourself in the mirror, “ John said as he kissed Sherlock’s neck and put his head on his shoulder.  The dark haired man looked at himself and at John. His cock was dripping with precum as John rubbed the silt of his cock. Sherlock’s hips unexpectedly thrusted into John’s hand. He looked down at his cock; then, he looked at John stroking him. John looked so beautiful and he wanted to kiss him. He really wanted to feel him.
“ Ah , John t-touch me more please, “ Sherlock said between pants as he stared into the eyes of John through the mirror. He threw his head back on John’s shoulder and closed his eyes. The sight of Sherlock on the edge of climaxing was so beautiful and would be forever ingrained into John’s head. The blonde felt a heat grow into his pants. He unbuttoned Sherlock’s shirt to reveal the flushed skin underneath it; he whispered sweet things in Sherlock’s ear.
The blonde smirked and closed his eyes. His right hand squeezed the bridge of his nose and Sherlock watched him as his shoulders shook as John chuckled a little. The dark haired man grew slightly nervous to hear his flat mate’s reply.
No need to blush, DI Lestrade,
“The same place where I’ll take you to, right now.” The man still had his back facing Sherlock. “Aren’t you scared, Sherlock? Seeing death right in front of you, smelling his breath of blood and pain, hearing little John’s muffled cries, oh, what a shame.” Moriarty turned around, his face teasing.
I had taken a few strides when I saw a dark shadow sprinting towards the door. I could not see clearly but I thought it was Sherlock. See? He could totally forget about me in a second or two. Why should I care?
I would follow you, I thought of you,
SHORT CHAPTER! SHORT CHAPTER WARNING
Sorry, this is not John. I am hacking into his computer again. At first I planned to delete his previous post, because I assume that he will be making fun of me again. But then I had an idea. I will take revenge here.
I blamed myself,
A little bit sad, i really hope that this chapter will not ruin your mood of the day...
“Good boy, good boy. I was thinking thirty strokes, but since you behaved, now let’s reduce it to twenty. This is going to be your parting gift with your puppy dog, make sure you whip him nice and hard. I’ll let him go if I’m satisfied.”
“John? Please, answer me. I… I cannot bear it any longer, please, just tell me what’s wrong. Have I done something wrong?” He said outside John’s bedroom door. But he didn’t answer. Not that Sherlock held much hope, but still that moment hurt so much. He panicked. His heart sank heavier and heavier.
"Cause I have you," you said in my ears,
A knock on the door.
“Message from Scotland Yard! Murder case. Locked rooms. Ha! Interesting case,
But I think at least I'll finish it... it is mean leaving an unfinished fic, it's just like abandoning a crying baby XD. Fine I dont know what i was talking about...
This experiment he was conducting, was certainly a difficult one. One hour? One day? Two days? He thought he would soon get Sherlock to yield. It had been three days since Sherlock was put in that box, and yet he had not even make a moan.
Oookay... the ending may be a little bit too abrupt.
Yes. London. How I missed the feeling of it.
John laughed. “Just let it go, Greg, you just have to live with it.”
Suddenly, shaking hands, short of breath, blackening vision, all too familiar to John.
Happy ending
John stood before the rusty gate of the old factory. The place where he suffered hell. The place where he broke under immense pain and torments.
Bet you’d like this, ehh??
What on earth are
With a huge grin, Sherlock said, “Of course not, my dear John, I’m just…
Well, the thing I love most about him is his height. He is miserably short. But that makes the perfect height difference between us. When he cuddles into me, his head lies comfortably on my chest. When we embrace each other, I can push my hand into his soft grey hair easily. And he is so tiny that I can’t help wanting to pet him. But, as I come to realize, although his cuteness, he can also be quite strong and manly.
"You have me," I whispered.
He sat up a bit. And… saw a man standing beside the bed, watching over him, with a pair of blue eyes that didn’t seem human.
Sherlock couldn’t see the blinking eyes of John, tired but focused on him. A line of tears rolled down from John’s cheek but Sherlock could not feel it. How John wanted to say in his ears, “Me too, Sherlock, me too.” But he could not. He opened his mouth but no words came out. Unfortunately none of this caught the attention of Sherlock.
I suppose that because of me, his life becomes a much happier one. Well, he’s got a lot to thank me. For buying
Greetings, little brother. I see you have recovered so soon after your…
He will take whatever case you have there
Just stay away from Anderson. I see that you are getting affected by his stupidity.
Sherlock's mind was burning up in eagerness to meet John, no matter what broken state he was in. It seemed like forever before someone finally lifted that blindfold away. He blinked, quickly adapting to the colours. He opened his eyes wide and very soon, regretted it. In front of him was a scene of horror that Sherlock almost threw up. It was a bloody mess. Pools of blood splattered on the floor, and in the centre of the room, was a person whose limbs were chained to the corners of the chamber. With one closer look, Sherlock discovered with terror that the blood-covered, battered face was indeed, John's.
"I'm not even going to reply to that." And he turned back to the microscope, brow furrowed, attempting in vain to identify some pancreatic enzyme active sites.
"Fine, fine, it's just-" he gulped, bobbing his knee. "
"Hello?"
"Yes, Sherlock," he says robotically, back clicking as he sits up. "What is it?"
the rug - "Breathe, sweetheart," she had whispered like a mantra next to Sherlock's ear, stroking his dark mop of hair.
"Pardon me?"
Feel free to correct me if I have anything wrong.
Double kidney failure.
"I do have mono-"
Mycroft placed a strong hand on his lower back, helping him sit up. He had Anthea bring them a glass of water and watched, a little light-headed, as Sherlock drank. "Ugh," he said, spitting blood into the glass. "I've bitten my bloody tongue."
"Why the fuck didn't you get your meningitis vaccination?"
John stared at him. "Wait, you know I'm –"
"You can go through now."
"Ah!" Watson shouted, "you know Keats as if by rote, then. Perhaps the great Sherlock Holmes has an inclination for the romantic, after all."
"I'm sure you needed the rest." He stepped back, spread his hands awkwardly. "You hungry? I brought some food over."
Sherlock shook his head minutely, eyes closed. The whole bed moved as John stood and searched through Sherlock's drawers, bringing out a red inhaler with the long-acting beta agonist inside. "You should've taken it." The detective shrugged, tired. He only wanted to sleep. John handed him his medicine and he drew it in with one heaving breath without even thinking. "It lasts twelve hours, so you can take one at..." he checked his watch. "Two, tomorrow afternoon." Sherlock gave him a look. "I know it's a little irregular, but you can suck it up."
"Alright," Lestrade said once John had switched the shower off, "let's get you dry. I think the fever's down now, right John?"
Sherlock heard John shuffle off, stomp up the stairs, and shut himself in his room. There was a shifting of what could only be cables, and a faint click that the detective labelled as the opening of a laptop. John was now occupied. Good.
"I'm not sick," Sherlock protested weakly, opening his eyes. "I'm not."
John looked at his flatmate, who was pacing along the opposite wall and fiddling with his gloves. "Sherlock?"
John pales, unable to conceal his shock.
"You're from London," the darker said, mouth pulling up into a smirk. "We're surrounded by Northerners. It's nice to hear someone with a more familiar accent."
John nodded, crossing his arms in a military-like fashion. "Whatever you have to do."
Everything starts to blur in front of him, a pool of colour shifting and morphing in the glaring light of the sun. Sherlock squints at the police tape, a dull pain beginning to pound behind his eyes. John isn't with him today- Sarah had threatened to fire him if he didn't return to work in the next twenty-four hours.
"Ms. Hooper." The elder Holmes' voice was uncharacteristically small, and she sat straighter on the couch. "I apologise for calling so late."
know where to look."
. With the way the man rolled out of bed practically screaming perfection, could you blame him for not wanting to look like a complete and utter twat?
"It's on your meal card," Sherlock explained coolly, nodding at John's tray.
John's head snapped round, mouth open and prepared to shriek every profanity, but the elder Holmes had already left, the tapping of his umbrella a ghostly echo on the floor. He croaked, and then choked, knees buckling as he slumped into the bedside chair.
Sherlock had come to Mycroft's office to exchange some repetitive quips concerning brotherly matters such as the younger's knighthood and the older's attendance to a play with mummy. There was absolutely no way Sherlock was going to witness 'Wicked' or anything else as obviously evil, and he didn't care if Mycroft had the Korean elections to worry about, this was simply more important.
"Sherlock?" he questioned nervously, taking his friend's chips from him as the shaking increased. "Sherlock, what -"
"John mate, what d'ya need?"
Several hours later, Sherlock was a mess amongst the hospital sheets, dark hair a shock of curls on the pillows and face mostly obscured by an oxygen mask. He was breathing evenly though, thank god, and his oxygen levels had remained stable all the while he slept. John released a shuddering breath of his own, stroking one thumb and forefinger over Sherlock's hand, whilst using the other to caress his forehead.
"If you would allow me some time to feed myself-"
Sorry this was so rushed.
He supposed it might upset his dear old dad, if he ever were to find out, that Sherlock might also be taken by the same disease.
The doctor nodded, tucking his clipboard in closer to his chest and taking off down the corridor. John drifted in and out of some kind of alternate reality, in which Mary was still alive and Sherlock hadn't destroyed himself on her orders; a gossamer dream where his life wasn't riddled with psychopaths, silvery revolvers and battered organs...
feeling ignorant.
"Have you sat with him, even once?" Silence. "He's in pain, Mr. Holmes. And with chemoradiotherapy, it will only get worse for him. Of course, he's scared – and there's nothing irrational about it."
The next time he woke, he could not stop coughing. They removed the ventilator.
, and hoped to hell that he hadn't woken any hung-over teenagers in the next rooms over.
"Here," John said as he placed the tea on the table, intentionally nudging it so it sloshed over the sides. Sherlock greened, and the doctor sighed. "Sherlock."
In the beginning, Watson had been horrified by the severe progression of Holmes' disease. If his knowledge served him correctly, his father had survived more than a year, and Keats, who had found this frightful thing so romantic in 1819, had lived with tuberculosis for two. But with the speed of his friend's deterioration, the doctor feared Holmes may not last until the end of spring.
John scoffed, tilting his head. "I
Warning for graphic depiction of vomit.
Merely two months later, the detective's battle with breathing restricted him from his beloved chasing of criminals, and, in order to shelter himself from the still frozen air, he resolved to remain contained inside 221B Baker Street.
Suddenly, Sherlock stumbles. As if still pretending to be the victim, he falls unceremoniously against the sofa, one hand gripping the fabric while the other reaches up to shield his eyes. Anderson shouts in surprise before waving his hands about in desperation. "Don't touch anything! You're contaminating the crime scene!"
Molly raised her eyebrow. "Oh?"
?" Holmes appeared disgusted; his white upper lip pulled taut over his teeth. "I should think Keats would make existence feel all the more stagnant."
"Which one of you is unconcious?"
The house was modest, and warm; the parlour held a boisterous fireplace, and the large wooden beams and thick stone walls did well to shut out the cool rains and chilled nights. For a few weeks, Holmes did seem to improve. The country air invigorated him, and his complexion began to adopt a healthier tone. For the first time throughout this whole ordeal, Watson wondered if there was still a chance the detective might be one of the luckier few.
"To be blunt."
A long silence. And then, "try."
One, two... nineteen, twenty. Five forced breaths. One, two... a broken rib... eighteen, nineteen...
They heard the shower creak on, the steady stream of water creating an almost soothing undertone, and after listening for another uneventful thirty seconds, made their way back to the kitchen to clean up the tea they'd left all over the table and floor.
"John!" The medical student turned reluctantly to face him, temporarily ending his conversation with the blonde who'd sidled up behind them. "I'm not sure I like this."
"Thank Christ for what?" he asked curiously as this mysterious man began fumbling with his keys. Stark blue eyes met his, alight with mirth, and John marvelled at how perfect he looked, especially after a week like Fresher's. His own mirror this morning had shown him eye-bags and a five o'clock shadow, and he suddenly felt self-conscious.
She nodded, though he couldn't see her. "I'll be right over," she said, and then ended the call before he could respond.
Sally winced when the detective began hyperventilating, unable to look away. To her, he'd always been an arrogant bastard. But watching this was just painful.
"Everyone has... different triggers."
"We'll check with the thermometer once we're back in the lounge." They both got out of the bath, slipping on the tiles and dripping all over the floor. "You think you can stand?"
Warnings for non-consensual drug use and minor depictions of vomit.
"Damn it," he moaned, shifting where he lay. "These are new trousers."
let this not last a month."
The fifth cycle brought tortuous afflictions.
"However," he continued, "I want you to remain vigilant. SCLC has always been difficult to detect, and so I'd like to perform one more course of radiation on your skull. This is both preventative and cautionary – I want to make sure the cancer cells have not, and will not, spread to your brain.
"Is it?" Sherlock spat back sarcastically, letting his head fall back onto the sofa. John rolled his eyes.
Molly took them up from the side table and knelt in front of him, a pristine glass of water in one of her gloved hands. "Sherlock," she said, voice muffled by the mask over her mouth, "I really need you to take these." The consulting detective shook his head and closed his eyes, chapped lips thinning out. Molly sighed, shifting her position so that her feet wouldn't lose feeling. "I know you don't want to. But I promise you, no matter how shit they make you feel now, you'll feel better in the long run."
She tilted her head, meeting Sherlock's gaze as he twisted, barely conscious. John's patience was thinning. "Shall I tell him?" John looked down at his friend for a moment before turning back to Irene, police sirens whistling somewhere in the distance. Irene smiled at him knowingly. "My measurements."
Warning for Major Character Death.
The doctor smiled, touched by this softer side of the detective - the vulnerable side. He didn't like being seen as weak.
Watson shook his head. "I do not understand. Why should I deserve your gratitude?"
"Anyone could have seen that one, mate," John had replied, rubbing distractedly at his tie with a muslin cloth. "There's no way I'd put this stuff in my mouth either."
The doctor opened the door to find a dishevelled Sherlock sprawled on the floor, tangled up in the sheet he'd worn to Buckingham Palace merely hours earlier. "You okay?"
dramatic."
"When was the last time you got sick?"
There was a crash from downstairs, followed by a tentative: "John?"
Mind over matter. Sherlock knew it was stupid to think that way, but he was the world's only consulting detective. His brain was superior, and his transport would not win. If he wanted his tea and toast to remain in his stomach, they would.
It was Sherlock's turn to drop his mash. "What?"
"You see, but you do not observe, John. I'm hot because the heating's broken, obviously. And my cheeks are flushed because..."
Warning for mild descriptions of vomit.
Sherlock looked up calmly, his pale jaw framed gorgeously by his navy roll-neck. John swallowed convulsively when their eyes met over his sloppy plate of green beans. "John Watson," he greeted coquettishly, and the shorter man blanched.
"Welcome back, little brother." He spoke gently, noting the crease of pain between Sherlock's eyebrows. Said brother groaned, closing his eyes. They sat in silence for several minutes, before Sherlock tilted his head.
Anderson does so, squinting hard at the floor. "What-"
"You know, I was wrong about him." Irene appeared to be looking at the fallen man endearingly, painted red mouth curling with affection. "He
"John, a little hand please," Lestrade asks, his eyes never leaving the half-conscious man next to him. The doctor jumps into action, hurrying over and falling to his knees next to the DI. "Can you check inside his pockets for his blood glucose level testing kit?"
Sherlock wrinkles his nose in disgust. "I only figured it out after I drank it."
"What about the carpet!" Anderson shouts back, not noticing how pale the detective's become. "Just spit it out already!"
"I'm fine," the detective countered tersely, sucking in a deep breath. John sat down on the sofa next to him, keeping one eye on the bin and the other on his flatmate, sipping his tea absent-mindedly.
"I have to," she told him, unable to keep the emotion from her words. "You know I have to."
I tried to touch on some subtler themes of cancer - the relationships, the emotions - rather than the disease itself, and I worked long and hard on this to make sure I wrote it properly. Apologies for any medical mistakes, I am not a doctor, but I did thoroughly research, so just let me know.
"Everything," he moans, letting his arm fall off the side of the sofa, "
Despite her reputation, however, Sally made sure to jam a piece of wood under the door next time a case involved a cramped space.
Stumbling from his bed, John pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, groaning as the room lurched violently around him. He picked his way through dirty laundry – and a tiara that he was ninety per cent certain
Sherlock sucked deeply on an inhaler, closing his eyes. "Asthma," he gasped out afterwards, taking another drag. John's eyes widened as his friend took a few moments to regain his composure, leaning his head back against the wall. "Happens, sometimes."
It had started with a cough, as these things do. London winters were often unforgiving, and left many crippled by congestion and malaise, and with the poor care Holmes took with himself, it was unsurprising to the doctor that he, too, fell prey to a touch of influenza.
"I have mono."
Mycroft frowned as he observed his mother placing Sherlock's empty dish into the sink. The little boy kicked his brother's shins and screamed until a second serving was placed in front of him.
They'd been on a case, as usual, and Sherlock hadn't even been running - it was early summer and they'd been at the flat looking over files. Sherlock had taken down a few books from the shelf and they'd shot into his hands following a cloud of dust - he'd coughed and waved his arms about, but then he'd rambled on to John about how the murderer had predicted the exact time the ball would ricochet off of the -
"Trapped," Sherlock repeated, face seemingly impassive. But then his knees buckled, and he sunk to the floor, one hand thrown out against the wall to steady his landing.
"I'm perfectly fine, John," he answered, rolling his eyes. "I just had a chill pass over me, is all."
John blinked, mouth dry. If Sherlock had kidney failure, then that meant... well, that meant a lot of things -
John kept a finger on Sherlock's wrist, monitoring his pulse. "Wake up."
Sherlock shrugged, averting his eyes. "Never came up," he said, voice alien with the mask on.
The younger man lowered his eyes so that his lashes cast dark lines across the curve of his cheek. "Watson," he led gently, "you are more than just a doctor to me. You are more than someone to share my lodgings with. You are more than a convenience." He looked at Watson once more. "I think you always have been."
Sherlock clambers out of the car unsteadily, keeping his eyes shielded with one hand as he shuffles towards 221B. Mrs Hudson answers the door and ushers them inside immediately upon seeing Sherlock, tutting about him needing to take better care of himself while watching him with a concerned gaze and soft expression. The stairs are a struggle, but Lestrade only needs to steady him once; upon entering the flat, the detective takes himself to the bedroom, collapsing messily on the bed without bothering to shut the door.
"Look at the carpet!" Sherlock exclaims, pointing in the general area of the sofa. "You say there's no sign of a struggle, so the killer must have known her. But look!"
Lestrade put the lid down on the loo and sat on it, legs spread. Donavan slid down next to him, against the wall. She held her phone up to the ceiling, looking at the bars tiredly. "We're going to be here a while," Greg said, rubbing his hands together, "we may as well go over the facts, eh?"
"Ah." He gave his umbrella a spin. "Give me a minute, Mr Watson."
The detective took a moment to cough again into his handkerchief, thin fingers gripping his jaw tightly, and once he had finished, he angled the cloth away from Watson's sight. "Forgive me, my friend," he said softly, "but your fears are unfounded. I know what ails me, and I know, also, that I shall not recover from it." Watson felt the river-stones become lumps of molten rock. "I am dying, doctor."
But one thing John had never anticipated was a rather large chink in his flatmates mental armour. Specifically his amygdala.
"John?"
"But that's so
"Sure." John took in his flat mates appearance and shook his head. Sherlock's mouth said he wasn't sick, but the pallor of his face, the sheen of sweat on his forehead and the involuntary shudders that passed through his body said otherwise. Not to mention the now vomit-filled basin John held in his hands. "If you're not sick, then I'm not an adrenaline junkie." He wandered to the kitchen and filled a glass by the tap, placing it more gently on the table before Sherlock in order to avoid another hurling episode. "Open," John ordered as he thrust a thermometer in Sherlock's direction. The detective glared but obeyed, his bowed lips snapping over the mercury and glass.
Sherlock stared at him incredulously before he shuffled over to the bed and lifted his inhaler to his lips. He took a breath. "This is getting old," he observed.
He was drawn back to the room by a bang.
Once the cannula was fitted, he cleared his throat desperately, until John dutifully fed him sips of water. He shook with only the effort of lifting his head, and had to resist crying in front of his friend – he did not want to look more pathetic than he already felt.
They came, around ten minutes later. They knocked on the door loudly, so loudly John almost thought it might wake Sherlock. But he didn't move.
The detective sucked in a breath, and on its way out, his lips could be heard shuddering. His knee stopped bobbing and intead went slack, but the shaking intensified. Their simultaneous breathing worked for a few minutes, but then Sherlock lost control again.
Holmes lost his smile, turning again to stare into the fire. "Surely you know," he said lowly, pulling his robe tighter across his thin frame. "You must. I am not certain how I should articulate it, otherwise."
Despite this, the third dream was the worst of all. John didn't know what it meant, couldn't decipher the words spilling from the detective's lips in this drugged haze, but the context was completely irrelevant. Because no matter what explanation the universe offered to give, the simple fact of the matter was that Sherlock, the stoic, impenetrable detective, was crying. His whole body was wracked as huge, ugly tears streamed onto the sheets, and John could do nothing but watch as Sherlock keened into his own arm, lips shuddering over words of protest and a single, inexplicable name.
, of all things."
This time, when he was summoned to Dr. Wilson's office, he brought a certain coroner with him in lieu of a politician, because something about her nowadays never failed to calm him.
The news came in the early afternoon that Sherlock had slipped into a coma. John had stood there, frozen, for far too long - far longer than socially acceptable - and he only just about gathered his wits enough to ask why. The doctor's face had been grave, and John could almost read the answers in the little lines on his face -
Many noises often emitted from the boys' flat - in fact, crashes, bangs, and thumps were common occurrences - but Sherlock had not been himself lately, and
"You get to help out on cases again," John finishes for him, nodding. "Sounds like a reasonable plan to me."
Mr. Holmes becomes a victim of one of the most prevalent killers in Victorian England. Dr. Watson is, frankly, devastated.
Lestrade sighed, stepping back into the hall, Molly shuffling out after him. He sent Sherlock a desperate look. "If you need anything –"
"Are you in pain?"
John sighed, his breath shuddering, and stood. His friend, usually larger than life itself, looked so small amongst the bedsheets. The doctor tucked the duvet up to the detective's ears and smiled fondly as Sherlock smacked his chapped lips, before standing to brew himself a much needed cup of tea.
Johns eyes widen, and he almost drops his tea. The china scrapes unceremoniously on the edge of the table as he catches it. "You've
"I won't." And the door slammed shut.
John pulls a face, holding his hands up and shaking his head. "Woah there. If you have mono-"
"The key code to my safe."
It isn't that Sherlock hadn't listened to him- he'd done everything the good doctor said, taking his pills, drinking lots of water and salt replacement solutions and swallowing some toast here and there. He'd even slept willingly, and sometimes without John telling him to. But the work, and the rushing about, and the
"What woman?"
This had to be his worst one for a long time.
"John!" the detective practically wails, flapping his arms pathetically. The man himself looks up tiredly from where he was falling asleep in the arm chair. "
"Tuberculosis," the good doctor whispered, but he did not feel good at all.
"Thank you," he said seriously, meeting her gaze over the washed-out hood. "I – I really mean it, Molly. I know it must have been difficult, looking after me."
"Jesus. I'm on my way." And with that he disconnected the line.
"We'll set him up an IV, administer a stronger dose of corticosteroids. At this moment in time I'm a little reluctant to give him an LABA..."
"Of course I was right," Sherlock forced out, snapping his lips shut immediately in order to ensure that words were the only things he spewed. John raised his eyebrows, wandering into the kitchen to make some tea. While boiling the kettle, he quickly identified the nearest basin, and while the detective was occupied with controlling the nausea, subtly nudged it closer to the couch.
"My chest, and back..." John frowned, surprised by Sherlock's leniency. "I think I should see someone."
"I'm hoping once my course officially gets started, I can meet some more like-minded people." The brunette peered at him. "In fact, we might have some lectures together. Our degrees will be particularly similar in first year."
"No wallet or identity found on the body," Lestrade ventures, also watching the taller man. "Looks a bit like-"
He stumbled around the room aimlessly, clearly frustrated. "
Save for the coughing. It grew worse; became so debilitating, in fact, that the very violence of it fatigued Holmes. To his own vexation, he spent an inordinate amount of time dozing, only to be woken again by the terrible bacteria harboured within. With Mrs Hudson's assistance, Holmes' silk pillows had been replaced twice, and all three of his handkerchiefs succeeded by newer, cleaner ones.
"I'm pretty certain I have it."
"And?" Sherlock's gaze never wavers.
"Sherlock's not well. I need to go to the hospital with him..." Mrs Hudson drew in a breath, a hand pressed to her lips. Her apartment smelled of a soothing combination of lemon drops and tea. "Could you look after Rosie? I'm sorry it's so early, but -"
It was a second later that his little figure began to convulse. Mycroft closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and quickly reached for the cushion to cradle Sherlock's jerking head. He watched on quietly as his younger sibling's thin limbs seized, trying to contain his horror as his elbows quickly grew red with carpet burns and he felt the floor become warm beneath his palms. It lasted just over two minutes, but it could easily have been hours. Mycroft released a breath he didn't know he'd been holding when the younger Holmes finally went still.
." The last word came out as a hiss, his anger slowly but surely getting the better of him.
"Doing whatever I tell you to." His flatmate groans, and it's followed by a chuckle from John. "Come on mate, it's not much. Just resting when I say, taking the medicine, eating what I give you and drinking all the fluids I say you need to drink. That way, we can get rid of it as soon as possible."
"Hang on –" John put the back of his hand on Sherlock's forehead. It was uncomfortably warm. "Fuck," he summarised eloquently, pressing his other hand to his friend's cheek. "You're burning up!"
"He should wake in the next few hours," the nurse told him, making notes on his chart quietly. John nodded, smiling.
"No service," Donavan interjected, glaring at her phone. "God. I'm stuck with you guys untll someone realises we're in here."
As March drew to a close, and April began to spread both her pollen and dewy showers across England, Watson finished packing his things at Baker Street.
The taller boy straightened his tailored shirt, a deep purple that made his skin appear even softer than usual. "Sorry, yes," he said, taking his key from behind the door and closing it behind him. "What drinks have you got?"
"So no vomiting then?"
As the months went on John became used to the shortness of breath that would follow a pursuit, though Sherlock seemed to only stop when the need for air became dire - much to John's despair. He even took to carrying around his own inhaler, not quite trusting of Sherlock's self-care skills. He made sure to get all the information he needed from Mycroft, who retold the struggle the detective went through as a child.
"I merely explained that although you've had the vaccine, perhaps if would be best if you stayed in quarantine with Sherlock. But –" he held up a mask. "You have to wear this."
“ In the drawer to the right of you “
“ Then, an official date without any shenanigans sounds good to me, love.” John said with a genuine tone of voice as he lifted his left hand to caress the flushed cheek of the detective.
“ I want you, John. I wouldn’t want to do this with anyone else.” Sherlock said looking down into the former soldier’s eyes. John stood up to kiss him slowly this time.  Soft and passionate could only describe this kiss. Both of the men are holding each other tenderly. John placed Sherlock in bed and proceeded to take his clothes off and his shoes. He positions himself over the dark haired man. Their erections rubbed against each other and created a synced noise out of the naked men. John kisses Sherlock as he touches his nipples. Twisting the red bud between his fingers and trailing hickies all over Sherlock’s body. Red marks to show that Sherlock was his and only his. The thought of Sherlock being his made his stomach flutter.
“ I love you, Sherlock.” John said as he held Sherlock closer. Long fingers lifted John’s head to look into those dark blue eyes he’s grown to love. Crimson spread across John’s sun kissed cheeks filled with light freckles.
“ Really, John? My brain is about to explode if I don't get this over with this distraction!”
“ We can get closer, John.“ Sherlock closed the gap between them as their bodies were pressed together. The detective threw his arms over the shorter man and John put his hands on his back.
“ Are you okay with this, Sherlock? I don’t want to force you to do anything you don’t want to do.“ John said as he drew circles on the taller man’s back. Lanky hands traveled their way down to John’s crotch and palmed him over his pants. John let out a moan as a response. The tall man smirked at the sound of pleasure.
“ It’s okay, Sherlock. Though I can't lie , I wasn't totally against dancing with you when you asked. I was thrilled because I kept thinking that I get to be close to you.”
John continued to hit Sherlock’s prostate with each thrust and held the pale man close to him. He lifted the slim hips closer to himself and long legs immediately wrapped around his back.
“John, you hopeless romantic, I've started liking you the moment we first met and i knew we would get closer soon after. I want to do everything with you. You gave me everything and the entire world. As long as I have you, I'm content. I’m relieved that you feel the same way.“ Sherlock said as he lifted his head to lay on the pillow as he watched John do the same. Eyes locked as they remained close with a little space between them.
“ - Dancing promotes and enhances the quality of contact between two people. It helps to nurture and improve relationships- “
“ It’s okay, John. I wanted to kiss you anyway.” Sherlock spoke as his head was looking straight at the ground.
( More like, Sherlock couldn’t resist the blonde’s puppy eyes and his heart fluttered a bit at that moment ... )
John looked in the mirror as Sherlock continued to pleasure himself. He looked so beautiful. His face was blushed and panting as his hand went up and down.
“ I’m sorry that it took me so long. I couldn't bring myself to express my feelings towards you. But after getting closer to you, I finally realized that I loved you and wanted to spend my life with you. I want to do everything and anything with you, Sherlock. To touch you, to hold you, kiss you, just to be close to you, just breathing with you. I want to be with you and your crazy shenanigans. “
" Are you close?"
No reply.
“ Careful for what you wish for, dear “ John said as he started curling and thrusting his finger into the detective’s arse. John grinded his dick against the bed to catch his own release. Sherlock was breathless; the warmth in his stomach was a mix of pleasure and pain. He felt John’s tongue right alongside him. Even though he thought this is very unhygienic, it felt amazing. His opening accepted another finger and grazed a spot that made the pale man see fireworks.
The blonde turned his face and was met with those entrancing blue eyes. They were different from the times before. Eyes filled with happiness crinkled as Sherlock smiled at John. He was star struck at this point. Sherlock was the most angelic man in the world. There he was standing in his arms and smiling at him. Eyes were locked together; neither were breaking eye contact.
The detective noticed and was paralyzed for a second. He attempted to come up with something but John’s eyes were intoxicating.
“ Sorry, I didn't answer you before but we have no cases today. I even tried calling Lestrade and it went to voicemail. I’m guessing he’s getting a bit too busy with Mycroft. “ Sherlock turned his whole body around and placed his violin in front of him.
“ John, do you know how to dance? “ the man asked as he continued to scroll on his laptop.  John looked up from his paper; he questioned why Sherlock would ask this but decided to ignore it. There were worse things he had asked John so he might as well.
“ Patience, John. I think we should take things slow. Perhaps, a date?”
The setting sun filled the detective’s room and gave it an orange glow. The sun kissed the lovers skin. The couple laid on the bed with their naked bodies close to each other. Tenderly holding their significant other close as sleep crept on them deeply after their “bonding moment.” Both were utterly happy with their life and they couldn’t wait to spend it with each other.
“ Sherlock, you’re not that bad! Did you get lessons as a kid too? “ John said as he spun Sherlock to loosen him up a bit. His blue robe spun around him like a bird extending its wings for a stretch. He was met with flushed cheeks as they retreated to their original position. The detective’s nerves melted in the swells of the music.
“ John, it’s important! I have work to solve! “
“ Are you ready, love? “
“It wouldn’t hurt to go on a date finally, John. You can decide the restaurant. It can be our first official date.” Sherlock said as he reached for the doctor’s hand and pressed a tender kiss on the knuckles. He held his lover’s hand and rested them on the bed.
“ Kiss me, John, “ Sherlock felt John’s lips as he muttered the last words. It felt so amazing; he’s been wanting this for so long. John’s warm hand cupped Sherlock’s cheek as his tongue slipped into the brunette’s mouth; Sherlock held his wrist tenderly. Tongues fighting for dominance and John clearly winning. It was a fast passionate kiss that led Sherlock coming long white stripes of cum on his purple shirt and on John.  The blonde milked his orgasm by pumping Sherlock’s member until he finished.
Sherlock clicked open the image and was so shocked that a gasp escaped his mouth. The background was an unfamiliar cellar. There was a bleeding body, tied up, badly beaten, and crouched into a tight little ball on the bloody floor like a weak little animal. Sherlock, having an uneasy feeling, enlarged the image and felt dizzy when he saw that the person was John.
*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** **
“I am trying to tell you that, do not play with your life. Please. We can’t lose you. The world can’t lose you.
Sherlock was on the verge of tears, and, seeing no reaction from John, he turned to leave, grimly. Suddenly he felt a hand on his shoulders. John was looking at his face, and violent shook his head.
John felt a sharp pain in his back, and he heard the clattering noise of a knife falling onto the floor. So it’s not the heart that had been stabbed, he thought, feeling the position of the pain. That’s good news. Ohh, except maybe it has punctured his lung… not so good then. But Sherlock, would he be able to fight off the attacker? No, he had to get up to protect Sherlock, John thought. He… he had to…
Sherlock felt his face get hot and redder as he uttered the last words. He couldn’t believe John for getting so worked up about this. He noticed the sudden change in John's behavior when he was around the detective a while ago. Lust made Sherlock feel hazy and he felt stupid because he finally realized what he said at the end. His trousers were getting painfully tighter and tighter.
“You gave me everything too. I’m so grateful that I have you and you have me. I was hoping to take you out on a date but I guess we’re far past that are we? “ John smirked as he waited for the pale man’s response.
“ I wasn't the one moaning Captain, was i?”
Sherlock groaned as he pressed himself closer into the crook of John’s neck. John chuckled at his comment and squeezed his partner tightly.
“ Sherlock. “ The blonde man behind growled and held him tighter. Hot breaths were placed on Sherlock’s neck. He let out a soft moan into the doctor’s ear.
“ J-John , that was a-amazing.” Sherlock said as he turned his head to see John’s face. He laid his head on Sherlock’s shoulder and was breathing heavily. He could feel John’s erection on his ass so he scooted backed a bit into it.
“ Before we start, I want you to beg. “ John said as he stepped a little closer to Sherlock.
"You're doing excellent, love."
“ It's going to be sorta like a waltz. Just follow my lead, okay?” John said as he began to move himself and Sherlock slowly to avoid hitting any of the furniture. The taller man simply nodded. The detective couldn’t believe this was happening; he was so close to John that he could smell his cologne. A smell of cedar-wood with delicate notes of citrus to lighten it. It was making his head dizzy but in a good way.
“ What??” John said as he watched the pale man extend his right hand to him. The doctor was shocked at why he asked him to dance. (It’s not like he doesn’t want to be close to him or anything…. To feel his warmth, to touch him and bask in his lovely scent. Obviously not that ) He was completely unphased and didn’t seem embarrassed. The music played softly in the background.
“No! We’re flat mates! They don’t do stuff like that together! “ John continued to deny not wanting to help even though he was literally aroused by it.
“ No.. and yes... I just wanted to dance with you and I really didn’t plan the kiss. But I really wanted to dance with you. I could try to explain to you the benefits of dancing and how it builds intimacy in a relationship. But, I don't think that can help me back up on the fact that I randomly asked you to dance with me and that we kissed.”
It was a passionate kiss that lasted forever. John gripped his black curls softly as his left hand remained in their place on the small of his back.
“ Start stroking yourself slowly, ” John said as he guided Sherlock’s right hand around his member. He left Sherlock to do his own thing and went to his neck. “ Try speeding it up and adding pressure to see what you like.”  the words slipped between kisses on Sherlock’s neck and putting his hands all over his body.
“ You look so beautiful, Sherlock.”  John said as he continued thrusting his fingers into the gaping hole. He went up to kiss Sherlock and tongues caressing one another. His left hand lazily pumped his and Sherlock’s erect member together; a whimper trapped between their lips. Separating mouths from each other, eyes look at each other and pure happiness flows throughout their bodies.
“ Things were always weird, John. It’s obvious that we have feelings towards each other. This bonding moment will probably bring us close-“ Sherlock cuts himself off as John walks closer to him and stands in front of him with some space between them.
" You're doing so well for me." John whispered into Sherlock’s ear as his rough hands gripped at his chest. John bit his ear lobe a bit and trailed down to suck a welt on his neck. A moan echoed in Sherlock’s throat as he continued pumping himself.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sherlock pulled out his throbbing cock dripped with precum. John could’ve come just at  the sight of that.
“ John, ah, I'm so close, “ Sherlock said as he turned his head to look at John. The man looked at him with such lust and wanting.
Lips separated from one the other and they’ve both stared at each other. Both were in awe.
“ I love you too, John”
John lined his cock up to Sherlock’s entrance and slowly traced the pulsing ring. He pushed the tip into Sherlock and slid in all the way. The man below winced at the new sensation; his narrowed eyes looked up at John. He smiled to reassure John to keep going. Warm hands grabbed at defined hip bones tightly but not enough to bruise. Creaks from the bed frame echoed the room with the soft sound of skin smacking. John repeatedly slid his penis out just to the tip; then, he pushed it all the way back again. He went slow to let Sherlock get used to this new sensation.
John instantly dipped Sherlock and their faces were inches away. Sherlock was wide eyed as he gripped the doctor’s shoulders to keep him from falling. But, John had a strong grip on his back and hip. The way John was looking at him was making his legs give out. Thank god John was holding him or else he would’ve collapsed on the floor if they were standing. The biggest smirk rested on his lips and his eyes were narrowed; it was making him blush redder than ever.
“ Please, John..”
“ Even the crime cases where we almost get killed? “ John jokingly said as he squeezed the pale hand that his hand was wrapped around.
“ John, you’re really amazing. Thank you for dancing with me. “
Sherlock did as he was told and was looking into the mirror in front of them. John pressed himself closer; he undid Sherlock’s belt and pant’s button. The man in front of him hissed at the release of his zipper.
Both hand in hand walked to Sherlock’s room and John closed the door behind him. Sherlock stood by the edge of his bed; he was all fidgety. His broad shoulders in his purple dress shirt were facing him; he was obviously tense about this. John went to walk over the taller man and notice the mirror in front of him. It was a long mirror with a white trim that faced the bed. He smirked at the idea that popped into his head and proceeded to think on how this would go.
John sat almost in the middle of the bed. The black-haired man turned to see what his flat mate was doing. Dark blue eyes met with his and shivers went up his spine.
“ You wanted to?”
A few seconds go by before John builds up the courage to speak from his heart truthfully.
“ John... that was amazing. I wouldn’t have wanted this with anyone else. Thank you, John. Thank you for everything. “ Sherlock said with such endearment in his eyes that John thought he saw little hearts in his eyes for a second. John chuckled and kissed the pale shoulder.
“ John, I’m s-so close,” Sherlock said into John’s ear between moans and his left hand came to stroke at the blonde’s mess of hair. John looked so beautiful; his eyebrows were furrowed and biting his lips to hold in a groan. Beads of sweat coming off his forehead as he thrusted hard into Sherlock’s arse.
"Can I see him?"
"Oh," the Detective Inspector said, mouth puckered. "I almost feel bad for taking pictures, now."
"How did you –"
"Uh, yeah, but I'd rather you didn't collapse on my floor while solving it," Lestrade chuckles, running his fingers through the detective's silky hair. "Want me to call John?"
It wasn't funny at all.
The doctor set his jaw. "If you do not let yourself rest, you will never recover, Holmes." The hollowness he saw then in the other man's countenance filled his stomach with river-stones. He approached his next sentence more dubiously. "I fear it will develop into something worse. Pneumonia, perhaps."
"John, do hurry up. A man has just been murdered and you're dawdling," the deceptive quips, wrinkling his nose and sanding his hands together. "It's quite irritating."
"Molly," she interrupted, accepting the tea graciously and cradling it in both hands. "I-I know, we haven't spoken a lot, but we've worked together enough detective, and now this. You can call me Molly, if you want."
"Sherlock –"
John woke up to harsh coughing a few weeks before Christmas, and lay in bed, unable to do anything but listen, for far too long. He could hear the way his friend's breath was rattling from all the way upstairs; could hear the repetitive hiss of his inhaler, and the short, quick gasps. Eventually, John made his way downstairs, pausing in Sherlock's doorway.
