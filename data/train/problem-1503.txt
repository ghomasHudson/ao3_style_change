Sherlock’s smile lasts until the moment John closes the door behind him. Dying away as his body tenses. Sherlock waits. Thankfully, though, Mrs. Hudson has a creaking staircase in need of a loving hand (not unlike the tenant that lives at the end of it). Sherlock can hear John all the way down the seventeen steps and out to the front door. The short break as John reaches the landing in the middle. The particularly bad creak as he reaches the fourth step from the bottom. The squeak of the hinges as he opens the front door. Sherlock waits. And there it is, the distinctive slam. John has left. Now he’s locked in here alone.
But then his gaze finds John. His pupils seem to narrow as they zoom in and focus, and Sherlock locks eyes with him with considerably more determination than he’s been able to muster on the previous occasions. For the first time since he’s woken up, he looks as though he’s actually able to identify what he’s looking at.
– in his most disgusted tone, as though it’s a bad word that he finds it below himself to pronounce.
“… need to get out of the house for something else than work. That’s just what the doctor ordered, you know. And your inbox must be bursting by now.”
And again, just as a quick and shameless self-advertisement, if you would like to talk with me or see some of my other Sherlock-related musings, please feel free to have a look at my tumblr, which is also called the-signs-of-two.
And so he replies, if only to drag out a moment that he should be trying to put an end to. He doesn't even lie.
No response. A slight frown appears between Sherlock’s brows, his otherwise expressionless face taking on an edge of annoyance. He wants John to shut up and let him think. Well, two can play that game.
True, John has to admit that he doubts whether Mary will ever be able to fully mend him. Wonders whether Mary isn’t more like a new cane than a new Sherlock. Which is a ridiculous sentiment. Mary isn’t supposed to be a new Sherlock. She’s supposed to be Mary. His girlfriend. She’s good enough just as she is even if she isn’t Sherlock. She has many fine qualities even if she’s nothing like Sherlock.
Still, the afternoon ends up being surprisingly tolerable. They chat and joke a little, John and Sherlock entertain with stories of old cases and they discuss the wedding, which they haven’t had a chance to do before now. Mary thanks Sherlock earnestly for all his help with the preparations, for being there on the day and for taking care of everything, and John belatedly realises that he hasn’t actually thanked Sherlock for all that yet. So he joins in the general praise while Mary is still on the table decorations and the cake flavours. And perhaps it’s simply a trick of the light, but it seems to John as if Sherlock’s eyes
him more human. But he didn’t stay to see the project through to the end. Now Sherlock is neither entirely opened nor entirely closed and all those
But John really doesn't know what else to say. He has no words, not until he's found out what he wants and how he feels.
. It takes an absurd amount of willpower to reconnect with his phantom leg and lift his foot from the puddle.
Mary chuckles. “I always agree with John’s assessment,” she says and gives John a challenging once-over that he can’t help but laugh at.
“I understand, Sherlock. I understand the appeal of an unlimited mind. Did you not think I would? Everything you’ve ever dreamed about within your reach. All the people who’ve outsmarted you, you will be thinking circles around them. All those frustrated nights in the lab or on the sofa waiting for an important mental breakthrough in a case, all of that gone. You could have the answer before they had a chance to ask the question. Maybe you could have the answer before it even happened. The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other. How often have we not theorised that, if you could only attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable? As inevitable as mathematics. You would be able to do that. To grab hold of any one thread of that tangle and pull on it to reveal every secret, every hidden information. All of that within your reach now. Trust me, I understand that temptation. But if you can’t see how irrational, how illogical, how
Sherlock can feel his body tense and wills himself to look Moriarty straight in the eye. Yet he finds his gaze glued to the floor, his head kept well down in defeat. This is it. This is the request, the confrontation he’s been waiting for Jim to initiate right from the start. All their carefree walks and naughty schoolboy laughs, all of it has been a façade and a lead-up to this conversation. Sherlock has seen it coming for the past two weeks, avoiding it like the plague and trying to convince himself that Moriarty didn’t bring it up because he hadn’t seen it - the emotion, the weakness, the hypocrisy. Preposterous, ludicrous hope. Now they’re here and Sherlock can’t run away. He has to come clean. And he’s terrified.
Kissing women has always been one thing. Warm, comforting, reassuring in its familiarity, sensual and intense, but always predictable. Always safe. John has loved many women and kissed even more, and though he’s nearly always enjoyed those kisses, they have also all felt more or less the same.
He tries to salvage it with an awkward “I didn’t mean…”, but he isn’t sure what he didn’t mean and his half-arsed, half-finished attempt at making it better only serves to do the opposite.
The first time happened right on the stairs up to 221B a couple of days after the scene at the restaurant. The first proper moment they’d had since Sherlock’s return where it was just the two of them. It had seemed as good a moment as any to at least try to say something. “Sherlock, you are going to tell me how you did it? How you jumped off that building and survived?” he’d asked. He’d tried to make the question sound light, like the whole thing had been nothing more than a well-executed trick. For all John knows, it might have been to Sherlock.
Not once has he consciously aired the thought of leaving Mary. He’s married to her, he loves her and he’s made her a promise to be by her side in sickness and in health. He owes it to her to at least give it a fucking chance. They’ve been married less than four months, for God’s sake. Considering leaving her now isn’t really trying.
“But you didn’t.” Sherlock cuts him off, looking up from his chair and holding John’s gaze, his eyes suddenly sharp as steel. “You didn’t, and that was the way I intended it to be.”
I woke up! And I don’t regret it, but… but perhaps again, I do! Because now I’m back here and you’re here for now, but you won’t stay! You can’t stay, for exactly the same reason that you couldn’t stay that day! You can’t stay because you have a home and a wife and a life far, far away from me! And I understand that! I made my choices and you made yours, that’s just the way it is, but I wish I had chosen differently! I wish none of this had happened! I wish I hadn’t made so many mistakes! I know you have to go back soon and I respect that, you have your own life and I won’t get in the way of that. But even if I’m not trapped in my own head anymore, it still feels the same! That I’m alone and… and I can’t talk to anyone! No one can hear me and no one can understand! And now I don’t even have Jim anymore! I’m all alone again! I know I’ve made the bed I lie in, but it’s just too… too unbearable to watch you go! Too unbearable that you’re so far away from me and I’m just here alone!”
The pause is barely audible, almost resembling a drawn out intake of breath. Then… “I’m not a child anymore, Mycroft.”
As much as he wants Jim, as much as he wants Jim to stay here with him, as much as he wants Jim to not leave him so horrendously alone, as much as he wants what Jim is offering and as much as everything that Jim has said about Sherlock and John and all of it is true… Sherlock can’t do this.
Of course the route from the clinic to Baker Street is one John has travelled many a time, way too familiar to keep him distracted on the way. Instead, inevitably, his thoughts drift towards Sherlock and Mary’s theory. Could Sherlock really be worried about the wedding? There’s nothing to worry about. John just got him back. He isn’t going to let him go again. Though John still feels both anger and frustration whenever he thinks about what Sherlock made him go through, the sheer relief of having Sherlock back, of knowing that he’s here and alive and well… John isn’t going to let him go again. Not for anything in the world.  No matter what happens with him and Mary, John and Sherlock are a thing and they’ll never stop doing this. Solving cases and drinking tea and laughing at things that the rest of the world don’t understand. Surely Sherlock knows this. They might not be very good at talking about what they have, neither of them really excels at communication when it comes to anything concerning feelings, but it seems absurd to assume that Sherlock should be worried about the wedding.
It comes as a decided surprise that Sherlock takes part in the wedding preparations to the extent that he does. Sherlock Holmes and getting lost in twenty minute discussions about which bakery makes the best marzipan to top off a wedding cake is not a combination that John would ever have come up with on his own. If he is being honest, Sherlock seems to be at least as motivated as he is. And sometimes, John can’t help but notice that it feels a bit as though it’s Mary and Sherlock who are getting married, the two of them discussing napkin colours, bouquet compositions and table arrangements with the greatest care and attention while John struggles to form an informed opinion on four slices of identically tasting white cake. It’s not that he doesn’t care. It’s just that there are limits to how much in detail John wants to go in preparation for a party that’s still several months away. Who can honestly tell the difference between plum and mulberry anyway?
The first two chapters were very introductory, but from here on out, the story is really going to take off. I didn't want to put this directly in the tags, because Icebergs is a fanfic first and foremost, but the story is a bit of a meta disguised as a fic and perhaps also an S4-fix it in some ways. I really hope you will enjoy this and subsequent chapters and please feel free to comment if you want, it's a great motivation to me!
John interrupts himself to chuckle softly, realising he’s beginning to sound too reverent and hurriedly attempting to guide his tone into a less formal vein.
It remains that way for a while, both of them exploring the other without rush, without force, just a gentle, delicate press of lips on lips. Then John lifts one of Sherlock’s legs partly onto and around his lap and their kiss grows slightly more desperate and insistent. Sherlock completes the movement John has begun for him, shifting his weight and moving his hips, in effect straddling John’s lap. He moves his hands into John’s hair on either side of his face, partly holding on and partly guiding him closer, and John
John gets up from the couch and shrugs out of his own jeans. Then he lets his boxers join them on the floor and Sherlock’s overly dramatic heart speeds up to an almost comedic degree.
John can’t figure out if he’d rather have the little smirk. It’s comforting in its familiarity and he longs to return to familiar ground. This is dangerous territory. He can sense it somehow. Something is building in the air between them and John is not entirely sure he wants to put a name to it lest he end up acknowledging its existence.
Suddenly, he can’t stand it. He can’t stay here, he needs to get out! He needs to shut the door, lock it, bolt it, place a dresser in front of it if that’s what it takes! Sherlock turns and slams the door behind him, automatic locks clicking back in place. Up, up, up, now! He nearly stumbles on the stairs in his hurry. He wants out now. He wants to go back to the safety of Baker Street, back to the safety of the real world. His hand reaches for the handle of the door and…
No, the point is that nothing John had done would have hurt under normal circumstances and John hadn’t known that the circumstances are far from normal. A minor comfort, perhaps, but valuable none the less, because what Sherlock can’t stop picturing right now is not John tackling him to the ground in the restaurant nor the punch to his lip nor the powerful
Sherlock swallows slightly. For once he doesn’t have to fight an impulse to wave John’s question off with a dismissive joke.
Sherlock smiles a little softly. He looks so innocently pure when he smiles like that, no edge of sarcastic or mirth.
And now… now he just wants rid of it. All of it. If he has to sacrifice the good times with John – the fond memories of past cases, the butterflies in his stomach when John smiled at him, the seeming drop in oxygen when John pulled rank or barked out a command, that feeling of being
“It’s not all your fault, Sherlock. Far from it. I’m… Christ, I’ve messed it up too. You don’t know the half of it. And I’m sorry. It’s true what you said, that I never asked, that I never
John is up from his chair the second after, pulling Sherlock to him and kissing him deeply. Sherlock responds eagerly, passionately, wrapping his arms around John as well and tilting his head just so to deepen the kiss even further.
Which begs the question what he’s going to do, a question he doesn’t feel ready to face yet no matter how long he’s already postponed thinking about it. He would much prefer the happy bubble of yesterday. But it's cowardice to continue to avoid the issue. It's not going to go away just because he keeps telling himself not to think about it.
It’s more than a week later before Sherlock is able to leave the hospital, which comes as a great relief to everybody seeing as he by that time seems just about ready to murder one of his nurses. She hasn’t done anything wrong per se, indeed she’s been following the protocol to the letter, but that hasn’t stopped Sherlock from developing the kind of distaste for her that he often aims at people in service positions who are actually just trying to help him when they manage to go the wrong way about it. Sherlock accuses her of talking down to him, which John must admit to agreeing with on occasion even though he tries to convince Sherlock (and thus himself) that it’s just part of a nurse’s job to be understanding and informative to the patients. Which only makes Sherlock grumble about unnecessary fussing and doctor-patient relationships in response.
But tired though he may be, John can’t deny that it’s actually also quite nice when he hears the front door downstairs a couple of minutes later followed by some awkward shuffling as Sherlock collapses the stroller and stores it away in the entrance hall. Then there’s Sherlock’s unmistakable stepping pattern on the stairs and the next moment…
Mary is all dignified concern and calm professionalism when she arrives in the early evening. John had phoned her while Mycroft had phoned his parents, after which they had lapsed back into that silence hanging between them, wobbling back and forth on the knife-edge between comfortable and decidedly not. It had been a relief to have someone interrupt, or so John had thought at first. Now he’s not so sure.
This is seriously annoying. With Mrs. Hudson apparently out of hearing range and Sherlock’s phone acting up, he will have to get up and go downstairs to either use the landline or find Mrs. Hudson and borrow her phone if he wants to get in touch with John. Sherlock would rather not have to get up already. He’s just enjoying the peace and quiet, the calm after the storm. For the past six months, being alone has been a constant bombardment of voices and sounds and feelings, splitting his head apart from the inside out. Now it’s finally all gone quiet, and then he isn’t even allowed to enjoy it? When he eventually does get in contact with John, he will have to complain about that too.
“I know it’s not my place. I have no right to know what’s been going on in your head. And whatever did, it’s not real. It didn’t really happen. Moriarty is dead. You haven’t brought him back by thinking about him or anything. So you can just call me a bloody idiot and tell me to piss off and that’ll be the end of it.” John’s eyes are on him, seeking eye contact. “You can do that. But I think it matters to me. Now that you’ve told me, I have to know why. Is there… do you miss him? The real him, I mean? When he was alive, were you…” John looks momentarily as though he’s struggling for words. “Were you attracted to him?” he says at last, obviously trying his hardest not to sound accusatory. He’s only partly successful.
! Even his physical body lying on the sofa in safe, familiar Baker Street opens his mouth in a silent scream and Sherlock vaguely feels himself digging his fingernails into his own forehead in an attempt to alleviate the pressure. The intolerable noise is evidently distracting him enough that he’s slipping out of his mind palace.
Sherlock sighs softly and shakes his head, stretching his arms overhead. “Mm, can’t say that I have. Which was the reason for, you know…” He gestures towards the microscope half-heartedly.
It takes a few poorly coordinated and not altogether graceful manoeuvrings before Sherlock is finally laid completely bare. John hesitates for a fraction of a moment, seeming to take in the sight before him. Then he meets Sherlock’s gaze, eyes blazing with heat and intensity. A strangely calm feeling that seems wholly misplaced in this moment spreads through Sherlock’s stomach. Perhaps a part of him had feared that John might still pull back, retreat when faced with Sherlock’s decidedly male physique. John has always been so defensive about his sexuality. Perhaps a part of Sherlock had worried that he wouldn’t be able to go through with it after all. Perhaps a part of Sherlock had worried that John might have been right about himself all along, that when push came to shove, he wouldn’t be physically attracted to Sherlock at all. Perhaps a part of Sherlock had worried…
John is showing none of that hesitation now. In two short seconds, he’s reached to the front of Sherlock’s shirt and undone the buttons, pushing it out of the way with an almost childish sense of urgency and entitlement. Sherlock is still wearing his dressing gown on top and his decidedly dishevelled shirt is partly lost beneath it. When John’s hands run over his now naked chest and it’s almost electrifying, an intensity like nothing Sherlock has ever experienced before. He thought that a seven percent solution of cocaine was lightening in a bottle. That was before this.
“I did!” he repeats and gets up from the couch, leaving Sherlock feeling undeniably cold and abandoned. He begins to pace, rubbing furiously at his mouth. Then he seems to reach a decision and turns back to face Sherlock.
things. When I’m there… it feels real. I have a perfect replica of the flat with everything in its place…” Sherlock lets his arms flare out, indicating the living room around them. “It’s all there, everything. And it feels real. I can run my hand over the sofa…”, his hand traces the outline of the armrest by his side, “… and it feels the same as in real life.”
“It’s okay,” John hastens to reassure. But it’s not really. John is angry with himself, angry that he can’t stick to his own decisions and angry that his lack of decisiveness always ends up hurting the very people he wants so badly to be happy. Sherlock is insecure about social things, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. The last thing he needs, and the last thing he deserves, is for John to exacerbate that anxiety because he can’t get his shit together.
Any conflicting feelings about contacting Mycroft for sympathy and advice evaporate like dew under the sun. It was undoubtedly a mistake. Hang Mycroft’s advice. His lack of sympathy and the unerring precision with which he twists the knife far outweighs whatever coping strategies he can offer. The still-active rational part of Sherlock’s brain can’t help but be impressed at the way his brother manages to both raise a strawman and then mercilessly shoot it down in two sentences flat. Sherlock has never quite managed that scale of manipulation. The emotional part of Sherlock’s brain, on the other hand, adds nothing but pain to the mix and wraps itself around his vocal chords unhelpfully.
Not good enough. Even he can hear how forced his voice sounds. And if he can hear it, so can Mycroft.
How many times haven’t they danced around this? How many times have they traversed that line between innocent joking and undiluted desire, moved from one to the other and back, but never taken it further?
The silence is deafening. John can practically hear the gears turning in Sherlock’s head, his brain scrambling for words and his lips and teeth and tongue fighting to form them. It takes at least a quarter of a minute before he succeeds.
“Daddy!” she exclaims gleefully, completely overriding the stiffness in John’s limbs and the slight discomfort of the icy cold meltwater dripping off her. John reaches down and lifts her up, placing her on his lap. His pants are immediately soaked. He can feel Sherlock’s eyes on them, affectionately amused.
Funny, that. He’s not alone anymore. Things have changed. He has changed. He’s moving on. And yet here, now, with Mary’s hand in his, a definitive proof of his newfound lack of solitude, he feels no different from how he felt standing here last time, two years ago. It disappoints him in a way. Somehow he had hoped to stand here with Mary by his side and feel contented. Somehow he had hoped to stand here in front of Sherlock’s tombstone and feel free enough to finally let go, to finally be able to say
As he exits Battersea Power Station, he exits his Mind Palace. During the intense emotional strain that he's just gone through in his Mind Palace, his heart rate has become dangerously elevated, which has caused John to think he was about to die. The chapter ends with Sherlock waking up in hospital.
Sherlock worries his lower lip. He’s thinking, turning that age-old conversation over in his head. Trying, no doubt, to listen to his own words through a pair of ears connected to a less intelligent brain. The stupid git.
Nor is John a failure. He’s an accomplished doctor, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, a battle-tested army doctor, a tried and true detective in his own right (although Sherlock isn’t certain he’s ever actually told him so) and above all someone who’s managed to not only put up with Sherlock to a degree where everyone else, including Sherlock’s own family, have failed, but also to provide Sherlock with everything he never even could have imagined he needed from another person.
All perfectly sound arguments, which John proceeds to ignore completely. He doesn’t interrupt or wave her off. He waits patiently for Mary to run out of arguments, then turns towards her and says what he knew would be his response before she had even opened her mouth: “You can go if you want to. I’m staying here tonight.” His tone tolerates no counterarguments. That’s all he has to say and that’s all he does say, even as Mary opens her mouth to protest. John simply returns his focus to Sherlock and, truth be told, ignores her.
They’ve been doing this every day for a week now. They head out from Baker Street in a random direction, find a place to sit, watch as people walk by and engage in a friendly competition in deduction. It’s quite relaxing in a way. But what’s more, it has allowed Sherlock to begin rebuilding confidence in his own deductive abilities. Observation by observation, deduction by deduction, he can feel his brain slowly regain momentum and reclaim its former exalted position as the pinnacle of Sherlock’s being. The deductions are useless, uninteresting and certainly not enough to get him back on track on their own, but it’s a start.
Which is in itself a troubling thought on so many levels, not least because it's a thought that John’s had far too often. He'd thought it might pass when he and Mary got married and everything settled down into a new normal. But it hasn’t, and John is frankly sick and tired of this constant doubt and guilt and uncertainty. It’s wearing him down. He can feel it.
He’s barely understandable, his speech slurred and his tongue wrapping around the words in unusual ways. But there’s no mistaking the sincerity in his broken apologies.
John chuckles and shakes his head good-humouredly, Sherlock smiles back just a little hesitantly and then resumes his explanations.
But then Sherlock opens his mouth, closes it again, swallows and narrows his eyes. And John remembers where he’s seen this expression before. The day he had asked Sherlock to be his best man and Sherlock had gone near-catatonic for several minutes. When he’d finally begun to talk again, it had taken John an embarrassing amount of prodding to get out of him that it was the casual reference to Sherlock being his best friend that had caused the disturbance. That Sherlock hadn’t known, hadn’t even hoped…
John beams back at her, unable to keep his relief from shining through. “He’s only bloody woken up! He’s pulled through.”
him… to speak. Sherlock pointedly ignores it, refusing to say a word. He’s deliberately not making this easy.
More than anything, Sherlock longs for the person he becomes in Jim’s presence. The detective who solves the crimes that nobody else can solve. The calculating machine that baffles others with acute observations that nobody else can make. The master manipulator who gets others to reveal information they would never have given to a less intelligent questioner. The calculating observer who reads others with more ease than ordinary people read a book yet gives nothing away himself. The child prodigy who noticed a murder that an entire nation overlooked at age thirteen. The intellect with an exceptional mind unburdened by tedious emotions. The era-defining genius. The brain without a heart.
are mutually exclusive. Incompatible at the best of times and downright adversarial most of the time. And John wouldn’t change a thing about that. Despite what he may have thought he needed once, now at last he knows with certainty that what he needs is Sherlock and Rosie and nothing and no one else.
Right at the moment, Sherlock and Mary are deep in a discussion that John is fairly certain concerns whether it’s a good idea to keep the same flowers throughout or whether it’s better to choose one composition for the entrance and another for the tables. At the same time, Sherlock looks to be researching wines that go well with salmon on his laptop while Mary is picking out fonts for the wedding invitations. It’s been almost ten minutes since either of them has spoken a word to John. Perhaps they’re counting on him doing whatever it was that they told him to do ten minutes ago.
Should he apologise? Should he tell them he knew it was a danger night, knew he shouldn’t leave Sherlock on his own when he clearly wasn’t in control of himself and yet did it anyway? Because that’s the truth of it, isn’t it? He bloody
The confused tangle of emotions and revelations immediately following Sherlock’s hospitalisation weigh heavily on John’s mind, but he has no energy to process them now. They’ve lined up in a nice little cue, all waiting to be dealt with and all pushing forward with increasing force as John does his best to ignore them. Too much confusion and uncertainty. Too many unspoken feelings. Too many heavy revelations to go through that require John to re-examine his choices and the reasons behind them. He just can’t deal with any of it right now. His brain feels about ready to explode as it is. The last thing John needs is any further considerations and troubles taking up space. But that leaves him with the almost equally insurmountable task of pretending that nothing is out of the ordinary around Mary.
Suddenly he’s a little self-conscious about the way he’s acting. It feels as though he’s baring his innermost thoughts, as though he’s somehow letting Mary in on a secret that really ought to remain between John and Sherlock. She’s his wife, his… his
Then, miraculously, it slows. One beat… two beats… three beats… Slower and slower until the monitor stops sounding the alarm and his heart rate stabilises within the normal range.
“You can’t always live up to the expectations of others, you know… Much less your own. You can try, but it just… life doesn’t always work out that way.” John presses his lips together, regretfully and yet almost resignedly. “Or maybe… sometimes you don’t know what the right thing is. Not just what you
Sherlock doesn’t say anything and John’s laughter stops. He’s suddenly uncomfortably aware of the implications underlying the statement he’s just made. He isn’t quite sure how to interpret Sherlock’s silence, whether it’s an annoyed/insecure silence because Sherlock
By the time Sherlock finally gets to the closing stanzas, the creaking in his head has increased to a persistent rapping loud enough to partially block out his own playing and he prays to whatever deity might be that he’s hitting the right notes because he honestly can’t tell anymore.
How could he possibly say any of that though? But he doesn’t want to lie either. This is not a time for dishonesty. This is not a time for shying away, for withholding how he actually feels. Not out of concern for who John is and wants to be, not out of concern for what others might think of him, not even out of concern for Mary and what this might mean for him and her.
That ought to be the long and short of it. From there, it should be easy. When has Mary ever disappointed him? When has Mary ever given John pause with her actions? Forced John to reconsider about

There’s nothing beyond this moment. No world outside, no people waiting with their expectations. Just this moment right here and now, there is just Jim and Sherlock and a mounting intensity in their kisses that is ready to boil over. And right here and now in this moment, that’s the only thing that Sherlock desires.
In the end, John decides to go. Within 24 hours, in fact, though he’s trying to convince himself that the very next day after work isn’t the same as
There’s another sound here too. Lower than the rest, barely perceptible above the general noise surrounding him. A creaking. A slow, insistent creaking. He wonders idly if the noise is coming from the aching joints in his shoulders. Maybe the noise is meant as a warning that his shoulders are about to give up on holding him even just partly upright and abandon him to the agonizing tearing he knows will ensue once he lets himself collapse. He steels himself for this.
“At most,” he reemphasises. “Provided that the police hadn’t messed up the crime scenes before I could get to them, of course.”
“Oh my God,” he choked. And he flew the remaining distance to where John stood in the doorway and threw his arms around him. He was almost afraid to ask but couldn’t delay the answer. “How bad?”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” he said, putting up his hands. “It’s not like that. Sherlock’s fine. Everything’s fine.”
Like a grand master of entrances, Sherlock was striding toward them, his large black coat billowing behind him. John could do nothing else but look at his shoelaces, convinced Sherlock would read his untimely confession in his eyes if John gave him the chance.
“I take it you haven’t moved out,” she said, eying him across the table, her hand spread close to her breast like he was trying to sneak a peek at her cards.
The doctor sighed out a long and silent breath. After what felt like an interminable pause, he finally said, “Righty then. Let’s have a look-see, shall we?”
. They were truly partners in detective work. He could almost feel himself shrinking in comparison. This other John was a soldier, a doctor, a detective, and bloody hell, a writer to boot. Was there anything that man
The myth, popularized by television and the movies and magazines, was that these restrictions were a systematic response to weaker bodies and slower minds. It was true that most Omegas were shorter, slighter, and just generally smaller, but early IQ tests in children ages four to twelve revealed no marked differences in intelligence among any of the sexes. It was when the children were separated and the Omegas sent off to government-mandated Omega Schools for alternative education that the differences began. Some studies purported that it was puberty, specifically the beginning of estrus, that slowed the brain and curbed Omegas’ ability to become critical thinkers and problem solvers, or to retain massive amounts of information, or to understand complex ideas. Contrary and little-accepted studies blamed the education system itself for not fostering higher thinking in Omega Schools, and for hiring substandard teachers, and for establishing exceedingly low expectations for the student body.
just a bump. The man cracked your bloody skull with a crowbar! I watched your eyes cross just before you hit the ground cold.”
So he had. Touched, that is. He’d given into a desire that went beyond disinterested sexamination, erm,
She was right; now that she mentioned it, John could smell the subtle sweetness in the air that stirred in him a sympathetic response. His bowels rumbled unpleasantly. She was entering her heat.
Besides, he had his own work to do. He checked his phone’s calendar, already feeling the tendril of anticipation beginning to warm him. A few more hours, and he would be the only thing Sherlock would be able to think about for days.

It’s not that Sherlock had tried to hurt him. He hadn’t even lifted a hand. It was the look on his face, the hardness in his eyes, directed at
All of London was awake, watching the clock, except for Mrs. Hudson, who was downstairs and asleep. She had had a trying day. Being assaulted and held at gunpoint by a small posse of Americans will do that to an old woman, even one as hale and hearty as Mrs. H.
They continue staring at each other a bit awkwardly.  What do you say when you’ve just faked your own violent death and are meant to be gone?  Or when you’ve just declared your undying love to a soon-to-be corpse at the top of your lungs in front of god knows who? Eventually, John asks, “How secure is this place, according to Mycroft?”
Sherlock has taken a step closer to him, is smiling shyly back at him, brushing a quick hand along his arm, and he hears Sherlock’s shouted “stay there, it’s only a 7 anyway” as the man himself clatters down the stairs.
Sherlock takes another step closer.  He is indeed desperate to see, so he chokes out “push it back.”
But it was when he actually kissed Sherlock that things really got strange – like his reality had been rearranged into some cubist painting, leaving him shaking his head in bewilderment.  Eyes one above the other, nose below the mouth, joy and pain swapping places, frustration knifing through like a scar about to break open, tenderness skirmishing with anger, straight lines of the calendar eclipsing the curves of the body…
A disgruntled Sherlock hails a cab, and when the address has been given, he mutters “You got an email request from a Mr. Easy Wilson, bodybuilder and personal trainer, who complains that his hitherto profitable sinecure has been dissolved as of --”
Sherlock flops wordlessly on the bed next to him and John sets the timer and glances at the laptop.  There is a spreadsheet open, but nothing recorded.  John turns his attention back to Sherlock, starting with a heavy feathering that he knows Sherlock likes, then murmurs “tell me what you want, love.”  There is a silence nearly broken by the furrowing of Sherlock’s brow as he scowls into the mattress.  John considers stopping until Sherlock actually says something, but decides that that is against the spirit of the game, if not the letter of it.
An indignant huff rouses him again, and he pads over and motions Sherlock to roll up in a ball.  Sherlock glares at him, so John clarifies, “Just pretend it’s your thinking couch and you’re avoiding me.”
“Neither do I, considering my French heritage and the abundance of evidence scattered--“ Sherlock stumbled to a halt. John had been looking intrigued, but already he was recovering. Amused, but not tempted.
Moving forward gets harder rather than easier, but finally he is at the door, the key fitting neatly, the knob turning scratchily in his hand.  He steps quietly into the dusty room, sees John look up wearily from the armchair pushed against one wall, obviously expecting one of Mycroft’s associates.  In a moment, Sherlock takes in the hunch of his shoulders and scrabbling of his hand.
In answer, Sherlock sped up and pressed harder and John moaned and moaned again and then growled not at all softly, and within moments John was shuddering in his arms, spurting come between Sherlock’s fingers.
he’ll use that word if he bloody well wants to -- for weeks, and he has yet to lay eyes on some parts of Sherlock.  Well, mainly this part.  He wishes Sherlock would take the pants off so he could stare properly, but something is better than nothing, yeah?  He gets a glimpse of curling ginger-brown hair, and his fingers itch to bury themselves in it.
Earlier Sherlock had been fuming at the fussiness of peeling and scooping and slicing a half dozen miniscule artichokes (“very thinly”, insisted the cookbook, “like a truffle”, and although he was determined to treat knifework as dissection practice, even Sherlock’s not that good at deceiving himself), and a text from Lestrade had distracted him long enough that the risotto burned after the vermouth but before the stock, so he'd needed to start over again.
Life was dangerous, Sherlock knew that. Their lives in particular. He was not a safe person, and neither was John.
Five days and three cases after the trampoline incident, Dimmock hands Sherlock an honest-to-god ten.  John watches, amused and not even trying to hide his pride, as Sherlock rampages through the the case, his very own bull in a candy shop.  As two days stretch into three and then four, John is sometimes with him, sometimes at the clinic, sometimes trying to urge tea and toast, and sometimes heading pointedly to bed in hopes that Sherlock will get a little rest.  Sherlock brushes at John like a moth fluttering too close to flame, and he doesn’t follow John anywhere.  Sherlock sleeps, John knows he must do somehow, but John hasn’t figured out how or where yet.
“Please don’t,” John murmurs as it dawns on him. “I’ve been doing the same thing.  I mean, I honestly didn’t realize at first, because you seemed, well, interested.  On the first night, I mean.  After that I should have known.  You told me and I should have known.  God, I even thought I was, I don’t know, helping you, maybe.” He is so appalled by the sudden realization that he can barely look at Sherlock.  “I just wanted to see what I wanted to see. I let you be … accommodating.”
So instead of doing any of those impossible things, Sherlock returned to the scar.  He ran his tongue along all the major lines, then he nipped at the smaller ones, then he sank his teeth in, just a little, to test how deep the scar tissue ran.  John didn’t lose his breath or whimper, though he may have growled, very quietly, almost meditatively, and for long minutes Sherlock licked and tasted and lost himself in minutiae.  He spiraled out, away from the original wound, and back in again, and he could have kept doing that forever, or at least until John got hungry again,  if he hadn’t got to John’s nipple on one of his forays, and John sucked in a suddenly violent breath and let it go and said “Jesus Sherlock!”  His voice was gritty and it was a moment before Sherlock even heard the individual words.  Then more evenly, John continued, “I like this, you know.  I really do.  This slow unfrantic exploration.  This is good.  But if you want to keep going this way, you probably don’t want
“My Omega made her a promise,” said Sherlock. “When one bond-mate does that, both are sworn to it. We keep our promises, John.”
John stared at her in horror, and he had a sudden and terrifying impulse: to echo Sherlock’s words and ask her who she was and what she had done with the real Harry Watson.
John, however, seemed too much overcome, and for the first time, he turned away, turned his back, and the moment John lost sight of his face, the connection broke, and he was face to face with himself.
Sherlock kissed the mark a though to soothe it. He hummed into the skin. “So what’s he like?” He traced a finger down John’s spine. “The other me. In the other place.”
“Here’s something,” said Chris. “It’s from what looks like a pseudo-Eastern philosophy spiritualism site, so maybe a little far-fetched, but bear with me. The article is called ‘Soul Searching.’”
“It will disengage you from your immediate surroundings. Keep your eyes closed.” They made two more rotations, and stopped. “Describe what you see.”
“Well, John,” said Lestrade, signaling for his third beer, “I’m hardly a study in successful relationships.” He tapped his left ring finger, conspicuously absent of a ring. “But one thing I do know is that the longer you stay silent about this sort of thing, the messier it gets. It’s cliché, but true: communication is key.”
They lay together in the bliss of afterglow, still touching and stroking, but without intention, only to feel and be felt. John felt like he could lie like that forever, perfectly sated, perfectly content, breathing in his bond-mate and reveling in their lifelong union.
For over an hour after waking up in Sherlock’s bed, John couldn’t move. He lay flat on his back—fists clutching the sheets to his chin—and stared blankly up at the ceiling.
“Okay. We could, I don’t know, look it up online? Maybe there’s something on Wikipedia about how one crosses worlds.”
Without removing his sweet lips from John’s, Sherlock brushed the tears from his cheeks and massaged the nape of his neck, like he understood. At least one of them did. He felt unlocked and vulnerable, but in Sherlock’s arms, he didn’t care. Here, he was safe. This must have been what a proper Omega felt in the arms of his Alpha. Maybe they weren’t so different after all. Maybe it wasn’t so wrong, feeling that. He craved it. Feeling loved and desired was a balm to a soul he didn’t know was wounded, and he no longer felt weak for needing it. The point was, he never wanted to stand alone again. Maybe he didn’t have to.
His adrenaline-fueled body and pounding heart were the only things keeping him warm, so he had one primary objective: to get out of river. The banks seemed so far, but he swam, hand over hand, and kicked his shoed feet. Shoes, trousers, shirt and jacket, all these things slowed him, and a couple of times he thought he might not make it. But through sheer grit, he refused, after all he’d endured to get there, to be beaten
In any case, Sherlock held the proof of John’s sanity in his palm: The deaths of those eleven people had been serial killings, not suicides, and they had all been carried out by a cabbie named Jeff Hope, who had died of a brain aneurysm, just as John had said. The question was, how could John possibly have known all that?
But then, why would Sherlock and John have devised such a plan, if they weren’t confident in its success?
Sherlock paused in the doorway, his hand on the doorjamb. Slowly, he looked back over his shoulder. “John,” he said, allowing a menacing growl to color his voice. “<<
Next he knew, Sherlock had released him, spun him around, and thrown him face down onto the bed. He had time only to grip the sheets, preparing to crawl away, before Sherlock was on top of him and pressing him further into the mattress while breathing deeply from John’s neck.
On the other, he feared being labeled insane, like, legitimately insane. It was a frightfully real possibility. He had done the research in his overabundant free time. In this world, Omegas weren’t considered terribly stable. They had been known to
What Sherlock had once written off as impossible was now, suddenly, the most obvious explanation: John was gay.
“I didn’t know where else to go!” he cried, trying to hold her more tightly. With her free hand, she tried to swat him away, but he thought she was patting him consolingly.
“I cannot rule out the possibility of latency, triggered by a moment of stress,” Sherlock said easily. “The Alpha attack, for instance. But let’s put that one to rest, shall we?
The steps were hurried now. Yes. Those were the steps of an Alpha desperate for his Omega. He would throw open the door, find John spread and dripping and aching for him, and the scent wouldn’t matter; his tightness wouldn’t matter. Sherlock would know him for his own and claim him still, and everything would be okay.
“So. Um.” He made himself stand fully inside the room. It was his own room, after all. He shouldn’t feel like an intruder in it. Only, he did. A little. “Lestrade’s just phoned. The pack, they went after someone else. An Omega-X.”
“No. I promise it’s not. That’s not why I’m here. I just . . . for the next hour or so, just no booze. Okay? For me, Harry?”
“Do we really have to kill a man?” John had asked, the night before, when they were running through scenarios and coming up with game plans. He was a soldier, yes, and he knew that in battle there was sometimes an imperative to kill or be killed. But though he had taken lives before, he took no pleasure in it, and never had. Besides, he had always thought of himself as a doctor first, and it was that instinct—to save a life—to which he felt most beholden.
This was serious business—he would abide no more questions, objections, or delays. Sherlock pulled John’s head to the side and once again exposed his neck and shoulder, and though John stiffened (he must have still been hurting from the attack), he didn’t try to push Sherlock back this time, and Sherlock got to work. Securing his arms around his Omega, Sherlock dragged him close and let his mouth fall once again upon the bond mark. He bit, first, letting his teeth work their way into the seven-year-old mark just enough so that the skin was opened and ready for the exchange. Then he flattened his tongue and pressed it against the mark, lathing generously, as much saliva as he could work up, and helped it seep into the mark.
John’s face twisted as though in pain, and he half turned away; but Sherlock’s accusation that he was hiding seemed to root him from turning away completely. Instead, he tried to school his face. “Two years we’ve lived together,” he said, nearly whispering because of the thickness of his throat. “Two years, and you never once . . . And then, I leave, and just
“No no, honestly, I’m intrigued.” Chris moved eagerly to the edge of his seat, his knees bouncing. “People have always been a little dismissive of Wonderland as the product of a drug-addled brain. But what if he was just trying to explain his experience? Or… or! What if he took drugs to
John couldn’t wait a second longer. He grabbed the back of Sherlock’s head, pressed up on his tippy toes, and brought their lips together at last. There was a short squeak of surprise in Sherlock’s throat, but John eased him through it. Softly, he moved his lips, and softly he parted them, and as he caressed Sherlock’s mouth with his, he touched his face and neck like his skin was fine porcelain, while the other hand slid under Sherlock’s shirt to feel the warm skin just above his trousers, then trailing around until his hand splayed across the small of Sherlock’s bare back, pulling him closer.
John knew nothing! What was he to anyone? What worth was he in the world? How did this man even see himself?
Had it worked or not? Had the other John made it home? Was his John lying in hospital, or lost in another universe? Or just . . . lost?
John pulled his damp trousers back up. He was still feeling slightly sickly, but he had the energy to go change into dry clothes. He trudged up the stairs, feeling an unfamiliar aching in his lower body that he had no inclination to examine or dwell on. All he wanted to do was crawl into bed, curl onto his side, and ride it out. But when he pushed open the door to his bedroom, he stopped short. His bed was gone. His wardrobe was gone. His desk was gone. In their place, a long table on which stood a microscope, beakers, flasks, and Petri dishes.
“He is, isn’t he?” Her cheeks were burning now, and her eyes dropped to her hands. “Never mind. I just need to . . . get past this. Figure something out.”
“That’s not true.” He pulled back, gripped her by the shoulders, and said, “You’re part of our pack now. We’re going to hunt these bastards down, I swear, and we’re going to do it for
“I’m new,” said John, grinning like he knew a secret. “I’m Fantasy John, and I’m about to solve all your problems.”
to have another bender in the family? So welcome to the club, poofter, and stay the fuck out of my life. Fucking knob.”
“I need to consult an expert. We’re talking alternate realities, and that’s not exactly my field of expertise.”
Torn between default outrage and quixotic impulse, he decided to settle on the latter and support her in what appeared to be romance burgeoning in the midst of tragedy. “Oh yeah? Greg Lestrade, right?”
John skidded to a halt, pointed the gun down the street, and screamed as he fired off two rounds with eyes closed. The first scraped into the ground like a plane coming into for a terrible landing; the second ricocheted off the brick wall of a building, off the side of a metal skip, and sank into the thief’s thigh. With a shriek of pain, down he went, both man and bike scraping pavement while the painting rolled like a cartwheel, splintering the expensive frame but leaving the painting itself miraculously whole.
“He wrote about everything. His dreams, his nightmares, his hopes, his fears. On one page, he talks about everything he wants in an Alpha, and on the next, he’s going on about how nervous Alphas make him. You were rather the exception. You should hear how his tone changes once he’s met you. He’s so smitten his grammar suffers, and it’s nothing but Sherlock Sherlock Sherlock—brilliant this, and fantastic that.” He smiled wryly, hearing a familiar echo.
Trapped between wall and Alpha, John screamed into his hand. But there was nothing Sherlock could do. If he broke it off, Dr. Stapleton would still be inside of John, having her way with him. If he rushed it, he might do unintended damage in the exchange of scent hormones and the integrity of the bond mark, which he had been so careful with creating. This was a delicate process, and an intimate one. It shouldn’t have to be like this. Damn that Alpha-X!
“I mean the dog fight. Holmes comes from a very small pack, and he’ll almost certainly be fighting alone. Three against one? We couldn’t hope for better odds. There’s no way he’s coming out of that.”
He thought. Then he said, “It’s for my”—he swallowed; saying the words for the first time was difficult—“bond-mate.”
Sherlock didn’t remember giving in. He didn’t remember commanding his feet to move. He didn’t even remember crossing the room. But suddenly, there he was, and he held John’s head with two hands. John. His John. The most precious thing in the world. And then he kissed him.
They took him somewhere outside the city, down a country road, and through iron gates leading to a Jacobethan-style house of brick. It looked a bit like it had once served as a boys’ school.
“This will never work,” said John, grimacing twenty-four hours later as the second vial was emptied into him. He was once again strapped down, the only protest possible a verbal one.
“Yes,” said the voice on the other line, sounding curious. “I already told her, I haven’t done work in that field in almost two decades. What is this about?”
Sherlock was not accustomed to feeling uncomfortable, least of all around John. In fact, historically, John had proven himself to be the
Visiting hours were drawing to a close, and Sherlock had not stopped in. Trying to ignore the sting of insult (or just plain hurt), John asked one of the nurses to call him. She returned with the report that there had been no answer.
John rolled his eyes. “We’re not jumping from the top of Tower Bridge. It’s the Waterloo. It’s not that high.”
that you know my . . .” He dropped his voice and only mouthed the next word. “. . . body . . . as thoroughly as you know your own.” He took another big bite and chewed furiously.
As the day wore on and Sherlock got more and more agitated, like a kid on Christmas Eve or a drug addict in need of a fix, John made up an excuse to get out of the house, mumbling something about needing to buy milk or get a haircut, he had no idea. Whatever he ended up saying, the truth was, he just needed his own space, and that was something he could no longer find in 221B.
He thought through all the evidence again, very carefully, and with the subjectivity of a computer analyzing data, until he was convinced. They had all been murders, all eleven of them, and Sherlock had let a serial killer escape justice. How had that been possible? Had he not considered all of the facts? More importantly, how had it been done?
Something was wrong. Definitely, unquestionably, alarmingly wrong. He felt a surge of panic now beginning to encroach. What was he to do? Go to A&E? And tell them what?
, though he had no way to measure that at the moment. Already a small man, he felt even smaller. He had fought the feelings of smallness and inadequacy his whole life; now, he felt it had beaten him. Not just beaten him, but had added insult to injury and taken more than its due. And to top it all off, just to make him feel even more degraded, it went ahead and added another injury anyway. He leaned closer to the mirror, staring at the unfamiliar discoloration. In the crook of his neck on his right, where the meat of the shoulder met the meat near the throat, were . . . teeth marks. It was the place he remembered Sherlock had returned time and time again, to bite and to suck, but this wasn’t just a bite. It was a scar. An old one, he discerned, and deep. It most certainly had bled. The skin was white and slightly raised, and when he dragged a finger along the ridges, it tingled. Had . . . had
They spent the next half hour sweeping away broken mirror shards, hoovering the rugs, and disposing of the destruction. “Don’t tell Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said. “We’ll replace it, and she won’t even notice.”
“That’s— that’s hardly the issue. We love each other like mad, but just, you know, not in ‘that’ way.”
“John. I’m sorry. I should have warned you about Marylebone. It’s hunting grounds for Alphas, day or night. I . . . I forget there are things you don’t know.”
(he didn’t really like to think about the disgusting things the man had said during knotting, the teasing threats that he would bite and bond whether John wanted it or not, or especially the ferocity with which he had claimed John, which had been both painful and humiliating). That time, after only a day, he had sneaked away from the sleeping Alpha, locked himself in the bathroom with his phone, and called the hotline in tears; and within the hour, a small team had arrived at his door to bear the abusive Alpha away and deliver a replacement to finish out his heat. It was a comfort, knowing that the Omega hotline was there.
Sherlock cleared his throat, remembering his experiment. He needed to turn the compliments back onto John. “Of course,
For what felt like long minutes, they lay there in silence. Sherlock never removed his hand, only continued a soft, patient stroking of skin and hair, a language John returned. When the breathing stabilized, and when the color receded from his cheeks, John began to talk.
He chided himself for the pounding heart. It wasn’t right he should be so nervous, like he had no business being there. But as the seconds ticked by and stretched over a minute in silence, John seriously considered just high-tailing it out of there and telling himself,
The man jumped; a flock of pigeons took flight; and John, having startled himself, clamped a hand across his mouth.
“You’re impossible,” said Sherlock. “And your counterpart would kill me for this. But he’s not here. So.”
. He’d been completely and utterly blindsided. In the space of five seconds, he had gone from believing—with great intensity—that he would need to spend the next several days, maybe even weeks, fashioning the perfect solution to bring John home.
For a moment, Sherlock thought he would feign ignorance. But he knew Mycroft would see straight through it. “It’s been,” Sherlock shook his head quickly and flung a dismissive hand into the air, “a strange couple of weeks. Hectic.”
Sherlock flung the curtain aside, revealing wild bedhead and an even wilder, saucer-eyed expression. John gripped the towel around his middle.
“Good morning, John,” said Mycroft. “You’re looking remarkably well, for having been assaulted by Alphas.”
Her hand trailed down to his throat, popped the top button of his shirt, and pulled the collar aside to reveal the white scar of the bond mark on his neck. “And this will soon be mine.” Dragging her finger across its ridge, her voice dropped to a husky timbre. “All mine.”
are more connected to alternate realities than our bodies, yeah? And what we really mean is our alter-selves. Some people have called it
love him.” But Sherlock was somber as he spoke. “It just took him a while to realize it. And frankly, I think he’s scared shitless by it. And Sherlock?”
Sherlock hands were running down John’s firm back and slipping under the elastic of his boxers. To encourage him, John hooked a finger under Sherlock’s pajama bottoms, catching the underpants below. Their eyes met. Unspoken agreement passed between them. Sherlock lifted his hips, and they were off, the pair of them; within seconds, nothing separated them, not clothes, not time, not space. They moved into oneness.
Sherlock growled deep in his throat, sending a current of heat straight into John’s groin. Sherlock must have felt it against his stomach, their skin separated by only a thin t-shirt and pair of boxer shorts. He grasped John’s arse with one hand while his arm held him securely around the back, and pressed him closer, letting him rub, making the heat spike. John gasped and felt himself going weak. But holding him firmly, Sherlock made an about-face and marched back through the kitchen, down the hall, and into their (their?) bedroom, all the while mouthing at John’s neck.
Sherlock knew John had nightmares. He heard them, sometimes, through the ceiling. Some nights, they wore themselves out and John continued sleeping. Other nights, he shouted himself awake. Once, he even fell out of bed. Because John never brought them up, neither did Sherlock, and so both pretended like there was nothing wrong. But Sherlock never felt right about that. He had always felt like he should be able to offer some sort of help.
“I need you to be my sister. And friend.” He grinned. “And confidante. For those days Sherlock drives me crazy.”
John chuckled and threw back the rest of the whiskey. Maybe it was a little cruel, but he did enjoy getting under Sherlock’s skin. If Sherlock could mock him for the number of girlfriends he had in the course of a year, he could surely tease him for how he looked at a naked woman. He stood with a groan.
“If Lestrade says he needs me, he needs me,” said Sherlock, “a thing you have born witness to time and time again. Maybe one of these days you’ll figure it out, Sally.”
“Why!” Sherlock threw himself back into his seat and crossed his arms. “Never mind. What do I know?”
“If something can happen once, it can happen twice. Sure. Why not?” He leaned in conspiratorially and lowered his voice. “Why did you come back here today? And without Sherlock?”
By the time he had finished in the bathroom and entered the sitting room, the sun was fully in the sky and filling both windows. The flat was quiet. Oh, that was right. Sherlock’s new case. He had received the message to his blog about midnight the night before, and Sherlock was eager to get started on it, in part to get it taken care of and keep his calendar cleared for the next three days. He was probably an hour gone already, and John had slept right through it.
With the abruptness of a startled rabbit, John gasped and launched his body off of Sherlock’s, rolling inelegantly, and crashing to the floor.
“If it weren’t for her,” said John, as they returned from the funeral, “if she’d not been renting, we never would have met.” He threw his jacket on the sofa and stood in the center of the sitting room, looking around, trying to remember that first day, so many years ago.
“The last possible outcome is demise. The death of any Alpha from either pack will terminate a dog fight, losing the challenge for the whole pack. In the case of death in the offending pack, each surviving member is given the chance to surrender and receive chemical castration, or refuse to admit fault and accept surgical castration in public. Either way, guilt is presumed.”
Sherlock. His Sherlock would be able to make sense of all of this, and what’s more, find a way out. He trusted, too, that his Sherlock would share in his bafflement at six sexes, balk at such a thing as heats in human beings, and scorn the way the world treated Omegas. He just wanted to be back with someone with whom he could have entire conversations in a single glance, with whom shared laughter came naturally and bickering was almost as enjoyable and comfortable as long, easy silences. God, it had been only a few days, and he missed his Sherlock fiercely, so fiercely it hurt, and it terrified him at the same time, the thought that he might never see him again, that his Sherlock would never know what had happened to him. Surely, even now, he was racing around London, panicked, searching high and low for him. Because that’s what his Sherlock would do for him. He knew it.
Despite his initial confusion and reluctance to engage, Dr. Serebryakov, once he got going, was a faucet that wouldn’t turn off. Twenty years before, he had given up his work on metaphysical displacement when no one in the scientific community would give him the time of day. But suddenly, there seemed to be an inexplicable resurgence of interest in his work, and his excitement was reignited. He talked so much and so fast that Sherlock did something he hadn’t done since uni: he took notes.
new people. They had been somehow and miraculously converted into Betas. And exploring those new bodies—discovering new pleasure points, capabilities, and limitations—had been a thrill. Erections had been . . . strange. But he could adapt to that. Sure, coupling in Beta bodies meant it was all over rather quickly, and usually (except once) happened only once in a night. And yes, it was far less
He quickly took stock of himself, noticing a few things that three days of hazy nakedness had not brought to his attention. To start, his penis was still pathetically small, but more than that, he felt narrower around the waist and slighter in the chest and thinner in the arms. Stepping on the scale revealed the truth of it: he was twenty pounds lighter than his proper weight. In fact, he even felt
Even though John pulled back to look into Sherlock’s face, it was too dark in the closet to see him properly. So instead, he reached to find him. Sherlock felt John’s fingertips against his cheek. “What?”
They stood at opposite ends of the room, John in the doorway, Sherlock by the window. He must have seen John get out of the taxi. His hands were deep in both pockets, and he wore a blue collared shirt with sleeves rolled to the elbows. Maybe it was the effect of John’s being slightly taller and marginally heavier (the nurse had measured and weighed him, and he was shocked with the numbers), or maybe it was the distance between them now, but Sherlock didn’t appear quite as tall and broad as usual. On the contrary, he seemed rather . . . narrow. Still tall, and certainly taller than he, but from shoulder to hip to floor, he was narrow as a rod.
It was possibly the strangest thing he had ever heard leave John’s mouth, but it had the desired effect. The old woman’s mouth snapped closed, and she looked as befuddled as Sherlock felt. Satisfied with the result, John, gave a sharp nod to Sherlock as though to say, inexplicably, “You’re welcome,” and he stepped back to resume his place just over Sherlock’s shoulder, and that was that.
So, sadly, he sat down in his armchair. He picked up the book. And, if only for something to do, he began to read. Sherlock was right. It was a ridiculous story, but amusing and clever. He read long into the night. But it didn’t hold the solution to his problem. Again, Sherlock had been right. The little girl, Alice, hadn’t stood in a storm, waiting for lightning to strike her and send her back to the world she knew. All she had done was wake up.
who think universe hopping explains child prodigies. Mozart. Da Vinci. Kim Ung-Yong. The theory goes that these people came from other universes, that somehow, their older, educated, experienced selves, I don’t know,
He walks back in the dark, expecting to come home to an empty flat, but Sherlock is there already, and the smell of curry wafts enticingly out of the door. They eat companionably, and resettle in the living room.  John intends to finish up his entry on "The Case of the Missing Carrot Peeler", but Sherlock grabs the laptop from his hands.  He fiddles aimlessly with it for a few moments before dropping it summarily in the kitchen.  He returns and clambers over the back of John's armchair, nudging him forward until he perches behind John but barely touching him.
Sherlock may not have received the ‘we need to talk’ ultimatum from a lifetime of girlfriends, but it still sounds ominous to him.  Not to mention the part about being tricked into coming up by the promise of something very different than what looks to be unfolding just now.
And that’s when it happened.  Sherlock’s zealous prowling vigilant hyperactive brain just gave up protesting and let him plummet into quiet stillness, and his body reacted by rubbing its eyes open and stretching luxuriously, and Sherlock took a deep breath and pried John’s face away from his shoulder and pressed kisses against his forehead and eyes, then reached resolutely between their two bodies, gathering up John’s thick solid cock and his own not-quite-soft one in one hand.  With the slipperiness of John’s pre-come, he moved his hand up and down, not too fast, just moving. Then when it wasn’t cloying or galling, he moved a little faster, a little harder.  While Sherlock’s body slotted sensations into place, fitting touch and response and breath and voice into something that made sense, John was off in the distance, like a man with a sizeable head start just now.  So Sherlock made a supreme effort to observe, even if he wasn’t exactly in the same race as John, and just when he had decided that the doctor was beyond speaking, John turned to him, his lips shaping words with careful concentration. “This --  gonna be all right? with you?”
“You need to respect when I need privacy,” John stays the course, “just like I would respect your need for privacy,”  He realises it’s a mistake as soon as it’s out of his mouth, he’s just not sure why.  Fortunately Sherlock is more than happy to enlighten him.
“Crème brulée,” Sherlock enunciated with a huff. “A custard of egg yolk, cream, and sugar, traditionally finished with a light application of flame from a torch such as the one which I am holding. It’s chemistry, John.”
The Kiss (in John’s mind it appeared with capital letters) had come on a Sunday in the flush of victory over a case.  That left Monday, Tuesday (wallpaper still as intact as before) and Wednesday for John to worry the problem like a toothache.  But by Thursday morning he was ready to let bygones be bygones.  From what he gathered (Sherlock seemed not at all interested in further discussions) one advantage of a schedule was not needing to worry about whether sex was ok on the specified day, and John took that to heart.  If all he had was Thursday, then might as well have a plan.  In fact John had spent the better part of Thursday morning, starting not long after midnight, mapping out a strategy, considering alternatives, running scenarios in his head, and needing to start all over when his thoughts inevitably became derailed.  But by the time he was ready to leave for the clinic, The Plan was perfected.  Because what Sherlock didn’t know, yet, was that John was bloody good at this, and he enjoyed being good at it, was a bit proud of it.  So if all he had was Thursdays, he would make it Enough.
The rest of the short ride, and indeed most of the day, proceeds in prickly silence.  By the time they arrive back at the flat, Sherlock has provoked, insulted and/or caused the arrest of a handful of imposing-looking physical specimens, but John has done one better -- he has managed to rile, vex, flummox, and/or show up the world’s only consulting detective at nearly every turn, and it hasn’t earned him a single “brilliant” or “luminous”.
“John… sexual relationships are not my area.  Sex as a motivator for crime, that goes without saying.  I can list 34 tells for physical attraction, 19 for jealousy, and 15 for revenge, but when not related to motive, I have very little data, and any that I ever had, I deleted it long ago.  I never thought I would need it.  Now I want it back.  And you need to help me.”
It went like clockwork.  John spotted the bottle of brunello left on the counter, and poured himself a glass, then looked over at Sherlock inquiringly. Sherlock shrugged and found himself with a glass as well. They ate and John recounted a particularly gory broken ulna at the surgery that day. By the time John was refilling his plate, Sherlock had almost relaxed again.
John’s laying on his back, a pillow propped under his head.  True, he had just been thinking about Sherlock, but the Sherlock in his head was a bit softer around the edges.  Less inclined to root through his wardrobe, flinging unacceptable disguises right and left, and more inclined to, well, John hadn’t exactly got to that  part yet, but the immediate Sherlock isn’t an improvement.
"Too bad its barely Friday morning," John replies with a smile, and Sherlock snorts, and John realizes Sherlock won't put up with waiting nearly that long.
“I was sitting here so fucking alone,  on infinite replay of you, falling out of the sky, and underneath that a voice whispering all the things I should have done, and now I would maybe never get to do.”
A bored Sherlock may be delightful.  One day, he may be want to meticulously paint a nearly-naked John in mud culled from various localities surrounding London -- the bits of sand gouging softly as they glide slickly over skin, the mud stiffening so that it’s difficult to fidget, wriggle, or squirm under Sherlock’s attentive ministrations -- then take careful notes as he rubs, washes, brushes, or breathes it off with equal care.
The stillness of the room is so jarring that his stomach lurches.  Sherlock is pressed to his side, just as before, his two hands in identical positions, his legs still holding John’s captive, his mouth still quiet against John’s chest.  Only the high keening noise is new, and that would be John -- and a drop of pre-come smeared across Sherlock’s stomach.
On his third time to the sink, he walks right into Sherlock.  It’s understandable – he’s never seen Sherlock washing forks before, and feels a little surprised that Sherlock knows his way around a dishrag.  He leaves the utensils to Sherlock in favor of starting the water for tea, and that’s when it hits him, Sherlock is looking artfully innocent, as if fork-washing were a daily occurrence.  Suspicion blooms into certainty in John’s head, and he can’t help adopting a teasing tone when he mutters “Bet you googled it.  Answers.com?”
Thursdays are quiet.  John can feel the worry in Sherlock when he wakes in the morning, and he knows that Sherlock will distance himself most of the day.  At first John tries to talk his way out of weekly physical relations, out of any physical relations at all, but that seems to make Sherlock even more tightly wound and worried, and god help him, John wants this too much to really make his point.  But he is slow and careful to a fault.  He runs through both lists of What Sherlock might like, and tests out a few new entries that he has chosen during the preceding week.  He sees that Sherlock wants him to come first, so he obliges, and if Sherlock fades afterwards, John tries not to take it personally.
Sherlock smiled carefully, measuring out the precise quantities of bitter and sweet and silly and sad, and murmured “It must be relaxing, not being me.  Tell me about being you.”
groused the running commentary in his head.  It felt oddly like being a small child, sheltering from something fearful that he couldn’t quite remember.  He held himself rigidly to avoid waking John, only his eyes flickering back and forth, taking in the details he’d never been allowed to access before.  The flow of the livid scar on John’s shoulder.  The shape of the inside of his ear, which you could really only discern up close.  The sparse trail of curly blondish hair that ran from John’s belly button down lower… best not to think of that right now, not if he wanted John to stay asleep.
Eating, that was even easier.  The body of a six foot tall man contains enough energy for days of deducing, sprinting, interrogating, and pipetting, with apparently some left over for fire-fighting.  (“John, I need some help in the kitchen,” Sherlock had called quite clearly.  “I’m busy, Sherlock, give me a minute,” John had answered.  After a half a minute, Sherlock had repeated “John, you really should come…” and John had responded “Busy, Sherlock.  I do have an actual independent life going on over here” so Sherlock had waited a full minute before calling “John, I—“ to which John had huffed “alright, fine, good, what’s the problem?” and then had become quite verbal about  god-damned scorch marks on the fucking ceiling, and the relative danger values of needing a pen versus setting kitchen appliances on fire.)
John hears Sherlock’s unspoken question and tells him, quite seriously, “Sherlock, I’m not going anywhere. Especially not over this.”  He sees that tears are winding down Sherlock’s face, even though his voice is steady, and he his desire to kiss them away is so strong it makes him dizzy.  But he knows it’s not a gesture that Sherlock would appreciate, so he raises his hand to Sherlock’s face and wipes them away with his thumb. Sherlock closes his eyes and lets John do it.
Sherlock nods as well and they fall silent, until Sherlock adds, “It was truly impressive, John.  Your … reaction, I mean.”
“It’s only for an hour, John.  Then the plan goes on.  You go back to Mrs. Hudson and the funeral and make your appearance in therapy.”
John smiles again, not the aren’t-you-clever smile, but a sad and possibly forgiving smile, and murmurs “We’ll get through it.  Although I think that was the first and last time for that particular kind of data.”
On Wednesday Sherlock heads out early in the morning and doesn't return until it's gone seven, looking rested and not sporting any spray patterns that would indicate he's been in the sewers, so John doesn't say anything.  Sherlock makes stroganoff for dinner and douses it with a red wine that John likes, and they are both quite mellow afterwards, and they watch a bit of telly.  At first Sherlock is silent, but John looks at him and says "go on, then" and Sherlock smiles and says "why doesn't the idiot notice there are 2 hangers reversed?" and John laughs and shushes him.
And fucking, shagging, getting or giving pleasure, making love – that was the easiest of all.  An urge only, no biological necessity at all.  Of course he had experimented as a teenager.  Already at that age he knew what puzzles he wanted to solve, and knew that solving them would involve knowledge of certain processes.  So he went about it methodically, learned how pleasure worked, conducted experiments on himself – temperature, light, duration – had even written some notes in a spidery adolescent code, had researched lists of physical tells and confirmed them on himself, and when he knew the what and the when and the how it felt, that was when he learned how to do without, how to reverse the process, how to take the tells of sexual arousal and turn them on themselves.
He fantasizes about Sherlock brandishing a riding crop over him, Sherlock immobilized with his own dressing gown belt and begging for John to touch him, Sherlock shouldering him down at a crime scene and fucking him mercilessly as five of London’s finest look on, Sherlock mouthing obscenities in his ear while John teases him, Sherlock covering his body with tender burning kisses, Sherlock on his knees with John’s cock in his mouth and John slumped almost insensible over his back.
“Oy!” There’s a shout from the burly man who gave them the booties.  “You two!  Lovebirds!  One at a time on the trampoline!”
It turns out that although there is lots of trampolining in London, there are no trampoline gyms like we have in the US.  At least not that I could find on google maps.  So, sorry about that...
“You removed the lock,” accuses Sherlock, and John sighs and says “because it wasn’t doing any good, Sherlock.”
So Sherlock did the most natural thing in the world.  He wriggled down until he was clamped to the very edge of the couch, only his palm still brushing against John’s scalp.  Then he closed his eyes and dozed off again like an albatross clinging to the edge of a cliff.
Oh, and did we mention that he never leaves the flat?  The black mood came on him surprisingly quickly after the straight razor incident, and now John is seriously doubting the sanity of their arrangement -- he’s trying to survive a frenzy of lust for a man he can barely tolerate up close, so if Sherlock could just get his arse off the couch and out of the flat for ten minutes, that would be lovely, thank you.  Or seven, seven would be plenty too.
“I threatened to throw a tantrum in the street in front of Scotland Yard if he didn’t,” Sherlock admits with a bit of bravado.
Up to now he had paid little attention to John’s comings and goings, as long as he was available when Sherlock needed him, which was frequently. At first, John had seemed quite taken with their lifestyle, and content as long as he could meet women for the occasional shag. That suited Sherlock fine.
“I’m not an exhibitionist, Sherlock,” John says doggedly, and he is astonished to see real hurt, deep disappointment, in Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock is dusting off his knees and doesn’t bother to answer, so John continues.  “Sit down, Sherlock.  We need to talk.”
Once the world is in place again, he reaches down to help Sherlock, and realizes that Sherlock doesn’t need any help.  He must have come together with John, and that was nice.
He got home late, brandishing Thai take away from the new place that John liked.  John was sitting in his armchair, looking like he’d been there a while, and he eyed Sherlock speculatively while unpacking the food.  John ate sparingly for once, and then they watched a bit of crap telly, and Sherlock did his best to be brilliant and witty when he cut the fictional detective to ribbons, but he could feel the tension, the waiting, the anticipation radiating ever more strongly from John.  About 5 minutes from the show’s final reveal, Sherlock laid out The Answer, which never failed to get a growling complaint from John, but this time John merely grunted “glad that’s out of the way” and clicked off the set.
“Dull,”  commented Sherlock, and, flatly, "even you don’t believe it” and John felt caught out.  Trust Sherlock to trample social niceties, even when John was just trying to be helpful.  This conversation didn’t look like it was going to get any easier, and John was running out of ways to putter. “Fine,” he huffed, dropping himself into a chair.  “What do I believe?”
Although he doesn’t realize it yet, soon John will stop trying so damn hard, and then he’ll stop trying altogether and just stick with enjoying, that’s enough to be going on with, and they’ll both be the happier for it.
Sherlock may think that John is a bit slow on the uptake, but John’s figured out a few things by now.  Since talking it out  and maintaining boundaries don’t seem to be getting him anywhere, he comes up with his own rules.
“Hold on, *I* got an email request?  On my password-protected email in my password-protected blog on my password-protected laptop?” John isn’t really surprised, well, he’s not surprised at all, but there’s a strange atmosphere in the cab just now, and he hopes that a bit of wingeing will dissolve it.
The other man approaches John warily but then their mouths lock and Sherlock realizes a flaw in his plan.  From up here, he really can’t see what’s going on inside their mouths.  Has John opened his lips to admit the other man?  He thinks so, but it’s difficult to be sure exactly when.  A miniature camera could have helped, but presumably would fall under the video ban.  Sherlock will have to plan more carefully in the future if he wants good data.
It’s a blank door in a nondescript neighborhood in a forgettable exurb, and Sherlock doesn’t even want to know how or why Mycroft chose this place.  All of his energy is focussed on the man that he has been promised he will find on the third floor.  Despite the reams of data he has meticulously collected and preserved on the subject on John Watson, M.D., Captain, and Combat Doctor, he finds himself unable to predict how John will react to his return from the dead.  His mind won’t frame even the most rudimentary deduction.  He is, in fact, desperate for this part to be over, desperate to simply
Sherlock blushes, but continues stubbornly, “Your eyes and your lips and your tongue know that I’m fine, John.  Let them handle your subconscious.”
Sherlock relaxes a little, ignoring the second part of John’s statement, which seemed a little barbed anyway.  But John has nudged him back to thinking about Data, and he has questions.  “I don’t understand really.  You were angry and resistant, you never went above 9 tells, not even when – at the end – and then you liked him enough to, well…” Sherlock is not sure if he can bring himself to articulate it again, but John rescues him.
Sherlock shakes his head.  “Mine does,” he states emphatically, adding  “Yours is not very efficient,” and immediately looks stricken.  “I didn’t mean that,” he tries to cover, but John rolls his eyes.
John’s smile fades, and he says “I didn’t do it on purpose, you know.  I mean, I didn’t do it to make you jealous.  I might have done if I’d thought of it, just so... well... but that’s not how it went.”
"Well, I hardly think that playing at hair dressing is going to satisfy either of us!" Sherlock is recovering his ability to be acerbic.
Once Sherlock relaxes a bit, John coaxes him to his feet again.  He’s still swaying woozily, so John presses his forehead to Sherlock’s shoulder, stabilizing him.   Then he slides around to Sherlock’s back, one arm loosely around Sherlock’s chest, the other curled low on his belly in a lover’s embrace.  Holding the taller man steady, John bounces them up and down, gently at first, then high enough to make Sherlock catch his breath.
The first few times it happened, Sherlock treated John to a blow-by-blow recounting of his date the next morning, but that made little difference except that now John was sometimes gone for the entire night and right through his clinic shift, and Sherlock had to make his deductions after half the evidence had been erased the next afternoon. An amusing challenge, yes, but hardly a satisfactory situation.
Four days stretch into six, and John is convinced Sherlock is subsisting on the fumes from his nicotine patch adhesives, then into eight in a hellish all-night stake-out, then nine before the case is cracked at last.
But for the moment, all this is a rather long-winded way to say that John’s wanking campaign has continued apace.  It’s less quiet than it used to be -- John’s walking around with a grin on his face, humming unfathomable tunes, and he can’t seem to get the stealth part working again -- but it’s completely discreet and ignorable, if one were inclined to ignore.  Which Sherlock is not.
I actually did write up most of the case and meant to include it in the chapter .... but as I have never written casefic before, I didn't realize the sheer length of all that exposition, so I'll finish it up and include it as an out-take at some point.
When he is finished finding the pieces of himself and putting them back together, John opens his eyes to see Sherlock still sitting at his side, looking pleased and a bit predatory. "Maybe you'd better introduce me to your tutor," offers John.
On Thursday, Sherlock is up to make John a cup of tea in the morning. John has a shift at the clinic, several extra hours made tense by a three year old with two crushed fingers (got closed into the frame of the door while the mother was in a hurry, and now she's screaming louder than her child) in the middle of which a homeless man who came in with a mild 'flu stops breathing and has to be resuscitated.  All ending well still does not make for an easy day, and John dreads the three year old's follow up appointment. Stitches can flash him back to scenes in Afghanistan, where he desperately wanted to stitch people up, especially when there's a lot of screaming involved.
John’s idea of a lovely night with Sherlock contains all of the above plus tracing the lines of Sherlock’s collarbone under his silk shirt (especially the aubergine one, god John loves that one, he hadn’t even known they made shirts that color). This makes Sherlock smile and squint at him.  It includes John leaning his forehead into Sherlock’s back, right between his ridiculously sharp shoulder blades (and bonus points if he can get Sherlock to take that aubergine shirt off) and breathing softly along the gentle knobs of Sherlock’s spine.  This makes Sherlock shiver and tip his head back. It includes John circling Sherlock’s elongated frame with his powerful arms, hands splayed not to tickle, fingers coming to rest on Sherlock’s equally sharp hipbones.  This makes Sherlock take a deep breath and turn to bury his head in John’s shoulder.  And that’s where it ends, because John, despite his large and varied experience, has yet to chart a way forward that doesn’t involve Sherlock going cool and leaning away.  He has tried more, tried less, tried slow, tried slower, but no matter how promising the beginning, the end is frustratingly the same.
These days, they still bicker, John still embarrasses Sherlock regularly on his blog, and Sherlock still blows up kitchen appliances.  They don't play as much as John would like – usually after a good case, but otherwise it's hard, being the caretaker of a brain like that.  Hard to connive or cajole it into being quiet, harder still to compel it to stay that way.  But Sherlock eats better when he cooks for John and sleeps better curled up next to John, so that's something.  And sometimes when John asks for risotto, his eyes go dreamy...
“About being me…? If I was seducing you…?” John’s tone said, do you really want to hear this? and yes, Sherlock did, suddenly he most definitely did.  “I’d do it slowly, then. I wouldn’t even touch you at first, I wouldn’t touch you for so long that when I did, there’d be enough space in your head, in that ridiculously vigilant brain of yours, but I’d trail just one finger from your ankle to your shoulder, I’d circle your beautiful throat with just the tip of my tongue. I’d listen to every breath, every movement of your tongue on your lips,  I’d find out just how hard I could suck before you’d growl or whimper.  I’d put my lips on your throat and feel you breathe.”
Sherlock can’t stand it any more, and words rush out of him.  “I had to come, John.  You were, you sounded … how could I just lay there and do nothing, you were hysterical, John.  I’ve never heard … And there was nothing I could do.   I had to come.  I had to know you were all right.”
On Thursday morning, Sherlock drank the tea and ate the toast John made him, then spent the morning searching for the right case – it wouldn’t do to have a mystery hanging over him by evening, or a 3-day marathon without sleep or food, or worst of all, something dangerous enough to call John in.  After all, he had promised, more or less, and he was reasonably sure John had understood, despite the frustrating amounts of repetition, and Sherlock knew that keeping promises was important in a relationship, really one of the first and easiest rules in that slippery world.
Finally both men are panting, and he sees that John’s belligerence has given way to a sort of grudging respect.  Sherlock can see 15 tells of physical attraction in the other man, 5 in John.  In a lull in the action, the other man crooks half a smile at John, and John nods once.
Before, he had debated how to deflect John without pushing him away.  But gradually it came to him that no deflecting was required.  John’s wanting was almost a physical presence in the room, but it never spoke, never acted, never took anything on itself.  Sherlock taunted it and it merely sat in stony silence.  Sherlock pushed himself into it and it merely gave way and reformed elsewhere.  So finally Sherlock started to ignore it, and then one day on the steps John had looked at him, ready to say something endearing and ridiculous and
“Hey,” John’s voice was so soft he had to inch forward to hear. “I’m sorry.  We can go back to the way you were doing it before.”
Or maybe it was even more like that, and John has squeezed the sap out of the memories like pressing autumn leaves in his biochem textbook.
John has checked out of this conversation right about the time the statistical analysis began, which seems preferable to melting into the flooring in a puddle of mortification.  That’s why his response time is woefully lacking when Sherlock undoes the contentious dressing gown belt and pushes the black silk pants partway down his slender hips, saying “what I
In the end, they agreed on two days, mostly because John proposed it as an experiment. They slept, ate, and played for the first day and a half, not always in that order.  No actual fucking took place, or even anything that could serve as a metaphor for it, but many other things did.  Touching.  Delighting.  Tickling (mostly Sherlock).  Orgasms (that was John).  Later Sherlock would look back on that day and a half as the longest period of detente that his mind and his body had ever shared.
“John,” he said, breathless. He stood in pajama bottoms and a thin t-shirt, overlaid with his blue dressing gown. His feet were bare and his hair was mussed, black curls in every direction. Either he had just woken up or had never gone to sleep, because his eyes were still glassy with tiredness.
John’s shoulders jumped a little before he turned around and looked startled to see Sherlock standing there so close. In one hand he held the fat end of a chopped carrot, in the other a cook’s knife.
“Depends,” said John, sighing, though not impatiently. “When the weather turns, or it gets too cold, or I move too fast in the morning and haven’t stretched.” He laughed shortly. “It reminds me it’s there. But no. Not on the surface. It’s deeper. You can . . . you can touch it. If you want.”
Being no stranger to being ushered into strangers’ cars, John felt his suspicious hackles rise, and he stopped cold. “Sorry, where are we going, exactly?” His eyes darted up and down the empty street.
Slowly, keeping a weather eye on John’s back and preparing to bolt from the room at any moment, Sherlock began to undress. Socks first. The least intimate of articles. Then he unbuttoned his cuffs and shirt down the front, removing it carefully, then his trousers, until he wore only an undershirt and pants. But he grabbed some pajama bottoms and slid into them quickly. At last, he folded back the sheets, waited another breath, but when he received no objections, he slid under the covers and held perfectly still, staring at the ceiling, wondering what would happen next.
“Kindly remind your Alpha that the mask must be worn at all times while in the hospital. The effect from his shot will wear off within six hours, and he won’t have any trouble recognizing or responding to your scent.”
“I’m fine, really, I just need . . .” He was waving the suggestion away, but then he seemed to rethink his assertion. “The nearest loo,” he finished, and at one officer’s pointing finger, he took off.
He threw himself into the back of a taxi. He was shaking like a leaf and felt close to throwing up, but he had the wherewithal to know what he needed to do, where he needed to go. “An Omega clinic, please,” he said. “
At the end of three and a half days, as they lay sated in each other’s arms, Sherlock’s phone dinged with a text. He half-rolled on top of John to reach his phone, then squinted to read.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Clearly. About twenty years old, I would guess. A deep cut, though not from a blade. It’s not clean enough. I was asking what happened.”
Finally, all his work paid off. At 12:45, with a loud yawn and a stretch, Sherlock announced that he was one for bed.
“Yes. An Alpha-X. I can’t really stomach the thought of even being around the Ys anymore.” She smiled apologetically at Sherlock. “Present company excluded.”
So he went to the only place left to him in the world where he knew he would find an open door and a warm embrace. Barely holding back the tears, he knocked on Harry’s door.
John stared, bemused, and abandoned his ready excuse to go make tea or use the loo or go for a long and silent walk. “For what?”
Five minutes later, John stood nervously at the open partition, wearing goggles and a noise-cancelling headset, one ear exposed. Sherlock, ever the defiant one, had yet to dress himself properly and wore the goggles on the top of his curly head and the headset around his neck. On the long table beneath the open partition were laid five different pistols.
That first week, they made love every night. (“It’s kinda nice, you know?” John said. “Not having to wait every forty-one days,” to which Sherlock replied, “That would be preposterous. And oddly specific.” John laughed.) Sometimes it was slow and tender, other times frenzied and hot. (“It’s like I’m discovering my body all over again,” said John. “Everything’s new. Including the scent.” To which Sherlock leaned in, put his nose to John’s neck, and said, “To me, you smell divine.” John giggled.) Sometimes facing each other, sometimes not. John had been quick to get on his knees, though he seemed less keen to do it the other way around, which disappointed Sherlock, who wanted to give it a go. But everything was still so new, and he didn’t want to pressure John into doing something he was uncomfortable doing. Although, when he thought about it, John’s discomfort at topping didn’t make a lot of sense to him. Given John’s sexual proclivities in the past, Sherlock had simply assumed he would take the more dominant role, and frankly, Sherlock had rather been hoping to be the student, in this area of their relationship at least.
John bit his tongue from saying exactly what he felt like saying. He recalibrated and tried a different tact. “I didn’t say I’d interrogate her. But look.” He lowered his voice and stepped a little closer into their circle so that only Sherlock and Lestrade could possibly hear him. “This girl has been through a trauma. She’s terrified. And the last person she needs to talk to is a tall, scary Alpha with the bed-side manner or a hyperactive six-year-old, or a Beta copper scraping for the bottom line.” Both men’s jaws dropped in offense, but John pushed on. “What she needs right now is one of her own kind, an Omega, someone who at least has an inkling of what she’s just been through, a kindly face who is no stranger to trauma recovery. It’s not like she has anyone else here for her, am I right? Dead father, no bond-mate, no especially close friends or other relatives. So I’m going to go in, just me, alone, to talk to her, to be that calming presence you brought me here to be. Then, when she’s good and ready, and only then, will I come fetch you. We all clear on that? Good?”
“The police think I’m senile,” he said, still holding out the two comparison photographs for Sherlock to examine, “but I’m telling you, she’s not my real wife. We’ve been bonded fifty-one years, I would know. She may look like my Jackie, but I’m telling you, she doesn’t smell like her. Whoever this is, she’s an impostor.”
give him hell for being an Omega, John thought. And this probably meant that she wasn’t one herself. Reading further, he learned that this was true: Harry was a Beta-X who fancied Omega-Xs. He wondered vaguely: was that still considered lesbianism? Then again, what he and Sherlock had, erm, yeah,
, wouldn’t it? And not something pathetic like a cat-napping?) until Lestrade returned with an apologetic look.
“Mother Nature designed Alphas and Omegas to mate, and everything from scents to heats facilitates that. However, if we can engineer scent inhibitors for Alphas, as a protective measure, shouldn’t we be able to do something for Omegas? Something that gives them power over their own heats . . . ?”
John marveled. There was a cultural element of oath and honor in this world that didn’t exist in his, and so much of it, he was slowly coming to see, began and ended with Alphas and Omegas. The beginning and end. It was a humbling thought.
It wasn’t that he wanted to lie to Sherlock. He hated it. But there was no way around it, either. The other John had been clear: they wouldn’t get to talk again. Things were happening in his world, things that precluded him from getting to the mirror again. There would be no meeting tonight to address concerns or formulate a new plan. He had his instructions. If he didn’t follow through and meet John on the bridge tomorrow at precisely twelve o’clock midnight, the other John would fall without him. He couldn’t let that happen.
“Honestly, John, you’re so easily shocked by the perfectly ordinary. Kissing is a Beta practice, a way to sniff out compatible pheromones. Alphas and Omegas, our sensory receptors are far more advanced, negating any need for messy, unhygienic oral contact. And once the bond is established . . .” He stopped, seeing John’s shaking head. “What?”
into that space, or swapped in my definition, with another. His theory was that returning to the original state would require similar mechanisms to coming out of a dream.”
They had ended up at St Bartholomew’s Hospital. Sherlock had a contact there (not Molly Hooper) who was letting them lie low. From there, it was a short twenty-minute walk to the bridge. While they waited out the remaining hours, John stitched Sherlock up. His wounds, fortunately, were superficial, but needed tending to.
To his right, darkening the doorway, Dr. Stapleton stood like a mad scientist, hair wild and eyes bulging while wearing a white lab coat and pointing an imperious finger at him to put down the vials.
John knew his mouth was open in wonder, but he couldn’t seem to find words to fill it. He and Sherlock had been partners for seven years. How had he never known this? Not that he went on and on about his former Alphas—they were a given—but in part because he had enjoyed so few of them, but in greater part because he
the fortune they spent on taxis and wondered why Sherlock didn’t just break down and buy his own car). They solved the case of the Halloway disappearance (It was the dog walker! Who would have thought!), and the Fleet Street poisonings (By George, the cat sitter!), and the copy-cat dog-nappings (Good lord, a secret society of avian occultists!).
“Is your pride worth your life? Your dignity?” he asked, appalled. “You can walk out of here. You can
John climbed over, knees bobbing. With Sherlock still holding onto him tightly, he looked down into the black waters. Lights below the bridge, for the sake of passing boats, illuminated the distance he would fall.
He took a quick whiff, then a series of short, rapid sniffs, then a long, seeking inhalation, smelling the air for his bond-mate. But all he smelled was the tomatoes from the carbonara.
Then came the little noises in the back of his throat. Glottal stops pushing air from lungs to mouth, then the panting, the whimpering. The bed shook as John started to tremble. This wasn’t just a dream. It was a nightmare.
As Sherlock continued to huff in his ear, another wind carried the scent of the Alphas from the west, spiking his internal agitation, because he could smell them now, more powerfully than before: the hunger. He calibrated quickly: He couldn’t outrun them. He couldn’t outmuscle them, not all at once. His only prayer was to outwit them, at least long enough for Sherlock to arrive. But even then, he didn’t know if the mere presence of his Alpha was enough to make them back off.
Lestrade was still laughing and couldn’t talk. John, face still red, just gave Sherlock a wink and said, “Back to work, Holmes.”
John looked over both shoulders dramatically. The street behind him was empty. “Looks that way, doesn’t it. Now. If you don’t mind.”
Then John sighed out a contented breath, gripped Sherlock’s hand with both of his own to hold it in place, and sank back into the seat, and as he closed his eyes he said, “Thanks, Sherlock,” as if this position, this joining of the hands, was the most ordinary thing in the world for them, like he wasn’t taken aback by it at all.
John stared down at his hands. “So what happens if these messengers don’t tell the Alphas about your challenge?”
, what did he need to change for?—when he remembered his experiment and his goal to offer John a compliment today. This was an open door.
“Good boy,” she murmured. Then she took his hand and led him from the room in nothing but his socks and polka-dot hospital gown.
like John.” The hands gripped his head harder and began to tremble, a mixture of anger and fear. “Then why can’t I believe you are really him?”
“Sherlock! Come quick, come quick!” He waved a hand frantically until he heard noise from the back of the flat. “Quick!”
“John told me that he recently had some MRIs taken of his brain. I don’t understand everything he said about it, but basically, the scans show patterns very similar to a brain in sleep mode. He bets scans of my brain would reveal the same thing.”
“John!” he cried, getting a mouthful of Thames. But in every direction, he saw lapping currents and debris, but no John.
“I’m feeling better,” Molly said bravely. “Less pain. No more burning . . . down there. Doctors say I’m responding well to the hormone treatment. They won’t let me leave until they’re one hundred percent positive the bond has no more effect. Not much they can do about the mark other than let it heal, though. It’ll scar.”
—and it hurt his heart, a little, that this world’s John had done so much, and he so little. All John was good for were home remedies and the basics of a first aid kit. He couldn’t even give CPR.
Sherlock shrugged and tugged at his scarf, agitated. “You would prefer to return to that world you described to me? A place where you are enslaved to biology and worth only what a hypersexual, domineering breed of ‘Alphas’ deems you are? I saw your face when you spoke of it last night, I heard your words. Tell me, John, honestly, were you
Despite knowing how useless it was, she struggled, beat her hands and kicked her legs, but she only managed to get out one scream before the first punch knocked her silent. Then they dragged her down the hallway, asked which bedroom was hers, and threw her inside.
He started playing rugby when he was eleven. It was a reason not to go home after school, and Dad seemed pleased that he was doing something athletic. It’s what proper boys did, and John would do nearly anything to not be called a pansy or poofter again. Dad was so excited, in fact, that he started to take John to the park on weekends to run exercises with him, make him faster, make him stronger, make him better. “A star,” said Dad. “Gonna make you a star.”
It was then that John realized the brilliance of it. If he told Sherlock straight up what had happened, where he was from, why he was behaving so strangely, he would be labeled a nutter. But if Sherlock deduced it for himself, if he came to the
“That’s right,” said the man in front. “We’re not doing you no harm. Just enjoying breathing you in. Ain’t that right, pack?”
They crept down the hallway and around corners, John stifling yawns in his free hand and trying to pull himself into full alertness more quickly. His other body was more adept at shocking itself awake.
Sherlock smiled, then turned his head to the clock. “Oh! I’d best disappear then, eh? Five minutes.” He rose to his feet, passing over a sheet full of notes for him to communicate.
And with that, the sharp point of a needle sank into John’s abdomen. John’s eyes flew open and he let out a cry of pain and alarm. Through eyes watery with panic, he saw her withdraw the syringe, its contents already drained inside of him.
She sighed in irritation but relented. “This better be damn good. Tea then. Put the Cokes in the fridge.”
Sherlock smirked, pushed into the pantry, and spotted the anticipated door built into the wooden planks with a little brass hook. “It’s all meant,” he said with grandeur, “to mask the stench of death!”
, John thought glumly, positioning the stand where he remembered seeing it last, and placing the violin on the floor beside Sherlock’s chair. As much as he wanted to believe in Sherlock’s latest scheme, he honestly had no faith in it.
It had been days since John had been so thrown off by the Wacko World, and he had halfway convinced himself that he’d be able to take anything in stride. But this . . .
Sherlock made a startled noise, like a bird being strangled. He looked personally offended by the notion that some other version of himself might be a virgin. “Let me get this straight. You live with Sherlock. You love Sherlock. But you won’t sleep with Sherlock.”
But it was while interviewing a member of Sherlock’s Homeless Network in a crowded park that John felt the first cramp, low in his abdomen, and his body flushed with heat. Sherlock caught the scent and cut the interview short.
So his skin always jumped, a little, when someone touched him in a familiar or meaningful way, skin to skin, paying attention. And no one paid attention like Sherlock Holmes. John had never told him what a dick his father had been. Not outright, anyway. He may have made a comment or two about arse-hole dads or seemed a little too interested in solving the Fletcher twin murders (it had been the father), but he didn’t talk about his parents. As far as he was concerned, it was a bygone era, living under the drunken, tyrannical rule of Dr. Kenneth Watson.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and handed the book back. “It’s a genuine effort, and a decent one. But this is a work of fantasy. Lewis Carroll wrote of talking cats and giant chess pieces and elusive rabbits and other nonsensical gibberish. It hardly parallels what we’re dealing with, and in any case, Alice enters Wonderland by falling through a rabbit hole. A
“So . . .” said John, trying to understand what it was Sherlock was trying to tell him, “before me—”
John shifted forward anxiously. “But for that to happen,” he said, “the synchronicity would have to be absolutely perfect. I mean, what are the chances? One in a billion?”
One: Throw caution to the winds! Break down the bathroom door, throw wide the shower curtain, and against yelps and curses and a whacking hand, gather John into his arms and confess his love.
“We’re the same person, you know,” said John. “Everything I’ve done, it’s been in him the whole time. So when it comes straight down to it, John and I are the same.”
(the adventures of Wing Commander Max Hancock, a dashing young Alpha-Y rogue RAF pilot, fighting West Russians and East Americans as he tries to restore peace to his native Britain and return to the love of his life, Omega-X Trixie Sandberg!), the bell sounded, and seconds later, Detective Inspector Lestrade came into the room.
Mycroft found his voice first, which was thin with anger as he lifted his chin and said, “Sherlock, get your Omega under your control
When she sprang forward, John fired off a warning shot, intended to terrify her in her tracks, but it wasn’t enough. And Sherlock, seeing her sprinting toward him, crouched, snarled, and launched himself at her. They met in the middle, colliding with a force that sounded like a thunderclap in John’s ears, almost as loud as the explosion from the gun, and they knocked over a stand of flasks and beakers on their inexorable crash to the ground.
Twenty minutes later, John was on his feet and fully dressed. He was leaving. They didn’t need to call his Alpha to escort him home, or hell, graciously offer him
detective. “Don’t be absurd. This is history. Unchangeable. What’s the use of these hypotheticals? Besides, what do you even mean, both of us? You’re not even a detective!”
, behaving erratically. Further evidence: he made not one but two blatant attempts to poison himself.”
“Sorry! Sorry!” he muttered, scrambling to find his feet while simultaneously cupping himself like a little boy who needed to use the loo, as if he could possibly hide his arousal. “I wasn’t expecting . . . That is, I didn’t know it would . . . feel . . . like this.”
Running down the hallway, he hit every light switch he came to until he caught up with John in the sitting room. With nowhere else to go, John came to a stop by the sofa, facing away from Sherlock in mortification, and in his desperate need to hide, he covered his face with his hands.
The officers’ conversations in the background halted abruptly, Sgt. Donovan jumped, and out on the balcony, Sherlock straightened his spine and turned toward the room. He pushed open the door, an expression wavering between annoyed and curious on his face.
“He may have been the one to strike the match, but I was a fuse ready to be lit. Don’t you see? The whole time,
John shook his head, not because he disbelieved her theory but because it didn’t account for his own situation. He had not crossed universes with his own body still intact. “Could it be,” he asked, trying to figure out how to phrase his question even as it was leaving his mouth, “that bodies aren’t displaced at all? Just, I don’t know, the conscious self? Mind swaps?”
just boosted his autoimmune system, after all. “But I should probably take you to the Omega Emergency Department. Just to be absolutely sure everything’s okay. Besides, I’m going to file a report, and I’d like exact descriptions of the three—”
“The frenulum,” Sherlock mouths greedily.  “Just touch it with your thumb.  That’s it, up and down.  A little pressure.”  John removes his hand and Sherlock frowns, but John just brings his fingers to his mouth and curls his flicking tongue around them before returning them to their place.
With his body going exactly nowhere, John’s thoughts have circled around again.  Yep, Sherlock’s hands still on his back, his mouth still pressed open into John’s chest, his long, lovely throat bared, John’s very pointy cock pushing into his stomach, almost bumping up against his ribcage, Sherlock’s thighs on his hips, oh god and warm and lovely, and his toes scrunched behind John’s knees.
John's whole body is awash in fire.  His skin can feel every move of Sherlock's before he makes it, and he is shaking in a way that is impossible to control. With an effort, he opens his eyes a fraction and the sight slams through his body -- Sherlock rapt above him, cheeks flushed a deep pink, tongue darting between his lips, eyes nothing but pupil.  He drags his eyes over Sherlock's body, down to his cock, which lies nestled, small and tender, between his legs.  Sherlock's words come back to him -- I'd like to watch you -- and for the first time, he has no desire to awaken anything else in Sherlock.
An hour later Sherlock opened his eyes again. He was fairly sure he had committed John’s entire skull to memory in his sleep, as well as the location of each of the coarser gray hairs that he possessed. If he ever needed to identify John based on a fragment of skull alone, he could do it, which was comforting in its own way, although he wouldn’t say that out loud, ever. John was curled with his back pressing into the couch cushion and the crown of his head just brushing Sherlock’s thigh. When Sherlock held still, he pushed the back of his head ever so slightly into Sherlock's palm.
And Sherlock shivered, because he didn’t know how to do any of those things that John mentioned so casually.  He had tried a bit of that with Seb once, and Seb had shoved him aside and muttered something about being too stupid to aim straight.  That had been moments before Sherlock had mentally declared the experiment invalid.  The speed with which he had extricated himself from Seb’s bed that afternoon had, well, complicated their relationship.
“Sherlock!” John resorted to a drill sergeant’s bark now and that worked, that quieted the inside of Sherlock’s head and even allowed the visual world to drop its surrealist edges and Sherlock could see John again,
“You’ll figure it out.  Or decide not to, it’s all fine.  I can dry-hump the pillow and cry myself back to sleep,” and Sherlock heard both the bravado and the absolution in John’s voice quite clearly.
Or maybe it was never like that, maybe his memories have filled in the spaces like a color-by-numbers.
They stare at each other for several more seconds, and the other man moves suddenly, knocking John to the bed and attempting to pin him there, but John is too fast, merely rolls to one side and flips to end up on top.  The other man kicks at his knee and succeeds in knocking it out from under John, toppling John onto his stomach in a rather undignified way, but John is reaching for the man’s hair…
He wakes half a day later with an erection the approximate size and shape of Sherlock’s harpoon.  It doesn’t take long to figure out why.  Sherlock’s grip on him has loosened, but his hands are splayed one on John’s back, the other just on the curve of his arse.  His curls caress John’s shoulder, while his mouth, his brilliant sexy questing mouth, has fallen slightly open and his upper lip just grazes John’s nipple -- not enough to suckle, far too much to ignore.  When John stirs, when he even takes a deep breath, Sherlock’s lips and teeth press perfectly against the very hard peak there.   Sherlock’s legs, meanwhile, wrap around John’s, all heat and weight and the promise of gorgeous friction.
“Thursdays?” said John for the third time, and Sherlock wondered if sex resulted in lower intelligence, and if so how this could be measured, and would it result in needing to filch any new equipment from St. Barts, but John was clearly waiting for more explanation, so he stumbled ahead.
“Now the frenular vein,” continues Sherlock.  “Stroke it lightly towards the base.” John blinks bemusedly at Sherlock’s terminology, but he is a doctor after all.  He moves as precisely as he can, fingering the small vein which pushes back at him.  “And the anastomosis?” he asks in a teasing voice, and Sherlock crowds in immediately with “god yes.”
“John John JOHN -- it’s a six at least, I realize that the world of competitive body-building is is a strange and unhealthy perversion of athleticism, and the bootleg Russian translation seems like a minute and bizarre point, but a fascinating case can emerge from -- ” Sherlock bursts through the door but stops short when he sees John getting up from the bed, eyes forward, head already nodding in agreement.
“Why not?” asked Sherlock, all innocent puzzlement.  “I’ve seen it before, you didn’t need privacy then.”
John nods.  He’s never been entirely comfortable talking about Sherlock’s mind palace, and this doesn’t seem like a good time to start.
“You’re not strong enough to--” Sherlock begins scornfully, but John outglares him with “Army, remember?  I’ll use your fucking dressing gown belt.  Yeah, it’s definitely me I’m worrying about.”
Sherlock was aware that his mouth was hanging open, his breathing suspiciously harsh, so he snapped shut like a codfish, but John had finished giving advice, and was just looking back at Sherlock, a faint challenge in his eyes.  Still, the words hung in his ears, pure humming keening singing desire that was nothing
John pauses in his contortions to consider Sherlock through slitted eyes.  The bastard appears to be serious.
...” he falters, and then adds bitterly “Or do you suppose I follow all my boyfriends around like a goddamn puppy trying to catch them masturbating?”
The next morning Sherlock woke with a lurching feeling only partly explained by the lingering effects of the drugs, and several hours in which to obsess.
2. Confirmed sightings by multiple persons, including but not limited to Greg Lestrade, Sally Donovan, or the rest of their team.
do, since you asked, is need privacy.” John knows he should say something, really he does, he knows he should stop Sherlock, but damn, they’ve been lovers -- and
“Of course I was. I am. Happy, I mean.  There was nobody else who could have gotten a small time crook to deliver me my cane on my own doorstep, no one else I would walk into a pool strapped with explosives for.  We’re both adrenaline junkies and you put up with the telly and we like the same semi-decent takeaway.  Sex, shagging, fucking – it’s just.  Well.  It’s just a small part.  Not the way to measure what we – what we have.”  John was aware that he had made a strong start, but the argument had faltered somewhere after semi-decent takeaway and petered out altogether by the time he voiced the vague “what we have”, and he was having a hard time meeting Sherlock’s eyes.
After that things get a bit hazy.  He is fairly clear on the part where Sherlock shoved him backwards up the steps, and he remembers that getting clothes off seemed to take several days.  But in the end they are together on Sherlock’s huge bed, and somehow he ends up in Sherlock’s mouth, and
“Hey, it’s all right,” John’s using his talking-to-a-ten-year-old-with-a-wounded-dog voice, and it’s annoying even him.  “I thought—“
, well, not quite as good as some of his more ridiculous fantasies, but still and all, for a first time, it is amazing, really.  A bit fast, perhaps, but aren’t all first times?  He tries to slow down, tries to think of surgery or runny noses or any unsexy topic just to get hold of himself, but every thought that isn’t
Sherlock would like multiple data points, preferably under a range of conditions, but he settles for one in depth observation and hopes that once the usefulness of the data is apparent, John will be motivated to increase the sample size.
Sherlock glares and John sighs again.  “Look,” he begins more peaceably, “I know there are things you don’t like, and that’s, that’s good, that’s fine, no one’s blaming you or asking you to change--”
It was amusing in an odd, touching sort of way – John liked to watch him eat, and apparently he liked to watch John eat as well, except that where Sherlock looked hungry, John looked like a doctor who was finally getting his say.
Sherlock opens his eyes slowly and tries in vain to control his voice.  It still came out in an undignified squeaky whisper when he said “what you did last week – that was fine.”  He saw John looking at him still, a flickering uncertainty dimming his regard, and Sherlock clarified “you don’t need to do anything different.”
John has been trying to argue and squirm himself under a blanket at the same time, but so far he has only succeeded in imprisoning his legs and jamming the duvet into his zip.  “Sherlock, would you please let me, just, I don’t know, just be, in peace, that would be lovely.”
It’s the single slippery drop that decides the issue.  John’s strength is more than a match for a sleeping detective, and now he pushes Sherlock away in earnest.  Sherlock lets him go and closes in on himself.  John lays panting next to him, bereft and angry and very much alone.
John takes a glance at the printed email in Sherlock’s hand, noting that the man spells his name in capitals, EZ, and ventures “American?”
“Yes,” breathes Sherlock, and John shudders, his eyes falling closed, his lips repeating “yes” and then he straightens again, and says “More, love,” and Sherlock repeats “more, yes, more.”  John smiles at him, the imp back in place, and teases “full sentences, love,” but Sherlock is beyond full sentences.  His eyes are wide and dark, his breathing labored, his tongue working over his lips, his hands gripping John convulsively behind the knees.  So John takes pity on him.  His hand moves at its own pace, petting and stroking and twisting and swirling, his thighs pushing hard outward against Sherlock’s arms, his hips rocking his body and Sherlock’s like a lullaby.  “So beautiful,” he murmurs to Sherlock.  “So gorgeous.  So lovely.”  The rhythm and the friction carry him along easily, pleasure building in waves, spreading luminous joy, and Sherlock finds his voice again and says “Now John” and John allows himself to fall, already caught and held safe, cherished and treasured and filled with light.
And Sherlock finally noticed how John was rocking slightly, how his hand open and shut by his side, how his face flushed.  Right, friction, Sherlock remembered.  That was the missing element.  He could spare one hand while keeping his mouth where it was… And when he did, when he set his hand approximately over the obvious bulge in John’s jeans and pressed a little in time with the rocking, John moaned low and choked through a few breaths, and then his face relaxed marginally and he murmured something into Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock walks away, and John hears the faint sound of fiddling, which lasts long enough for John’s skin to raise goosebumps.  Apparently being in your pants in their big bed on a cool November evening is less comfortable when nothing is actually happening.  Just as John is starting to consider burrowing under the covers, Sherlock returns.  The right strap is  slipping repeatedly over his eye, and he looks flummoxed, and beyond that, unsure, quiet, and reserved.
John has slept, like a sane human being without a death wish, at least 5 hours a night since this case began.  So now he is both hungry and horny, but every time he tries to move, Sherlock clamps down tighter.  So John huffs a few times and resigns himself to sleeping.
“Short is helpful if you go out for gymnastics,” John adds. “Not that I did.  Got a growth spurt and that was the end of it.”
Except that it does, of course. Because Sherlock is the unstoppable force and John is the immovable object and apparently they will annihilate each other like matter and anti-matter unless something gives. John offers to wank himself while Sherlock looks on, but really, how is that data with an entire variable just missing?  John casts about for parts of the sexual act that wouldn’t stress Sherlock too much, but by now the stress is stressing Sherlock, so he might as well be talking to the skull on the mantleplace.  And Sherlock wields John’s own words against him
The other man looks John up and down and says “Army?”  John nods curtly, noticing the American accent, and the other man jerks his chin and replies “Marines.”
John sighs, and Sherlock continues “as of this morning, when he found that the Grandsons of Russia Foundation had been disbanded overnight.  We’re meeting him at the cafe next door to his former place of employment.”
Within a few minutes, John's head is lolling back between Sherlock's knees, his eyes closed.   Sherlock ghosts one hand over John's forehead and cheek, and John stifles the urge to nip at his finger.  Just because Sherlock promised not to sham does not mean he can predict or avoid movements that, to John, are almost sexual. John takes a breath, focuses on relaxing, and opens his eyes to look at Sherlock.  Sherlock smiles down at him and says "maybe the bed would be better."
“Once a month is probably more than required, but I believe it better to err on the side of efficiency.  More than six or seven weeks can lead to unpredictable results.”
His first text of the evening, the address of the abandoned print shop hosting the suspected trafficking ring, had been ignored. His second text, a “looks dangerous, dress accordingly”, likewise. Only the third text, a terse “extremely”, had finally extracted John, who showed up looking pre-occupied.
But Sherlock’s eyes have gone unfocussed again.  This time it’s not erotic, but damn if it isn’t breathtaking all the same.  Slowly his eyes refocus on John’s face. “I
Updates to John’s blog are increasingly erratic, poorly spelled, and filled with emotional punctuation.  John gives his message at the no doubt also bugged gravestone and makes his appointment with Ella, plus a followup he doesn’t intend to keep three days later.
"No,” says Sherlock slowly. “I believe you wouldn't." Sherlock's voice is normal again, the flush gone, his eyes blue and green and gray in the space of one breath.
Sherlock has gone colorless again and is having a hard time making sounds.  After licking his lips several times, he whispers “I’m sorry, John.  I’m truly sorry.”
“Why would you do that?” it is sharp and not in the least elliptical, the first thing that Sherlock has said in 4 minutes and 38 seconds, according to the electronic timer, and if you don’t count the scowling.
Sherlock flinches at the old argument, but John’s mouth turns up and he is almost giggling and Sherlock is suddenly so happy it is sublime.
Luckily the “extremely” part had still panned out well. While John knocked out the suspects in a business-like way, Sherlock found himself sprayed by an unknown substance with mildly hallucinogenic effects and gashed by a well-handled letter opener. When he woozily suggested that John should return to his date in time for cheesecake, he got a familiar look of exasperation which may or may not have been mitigated with fondness.
Sherlock sleeps on through two more carefully timed performances.  He wakes in the late afternoon to the snick of the lube as John removes the cap a floor above him.
“All right,” says John.  “That’s -- that’s fine. You can take care of yourself and you don’t want anything.  Just.  Where does that leave me?”  John fights the ridiculous feeling that he’s about to burst into tears, and he hasn’t done that since his crush broke up with him during maths in the second form.
“I don’t --” Sherlock begins, but John springs lightly on the bed by way of teaching him a lesson.  Sherlock sprawls inelegantly, hands, feet, and curls going in ten different directions, and after that he wraps his arms around his knees and lets John bounce him this way and that.
John considers forcing the burden of this conversation onto Sherlock, and maybe he felt neglected enough to do that 10 minutes ago, but 10 minutes can be a lifetime and right now he can see how hard this is on Sherlock.  His ears are fluctuating from pink to red and spots come and go on his cheeks as well.
The next morning, Sherlock assembled his new emulsifier and ran tests on a variety of common ingredients, but stopped regretfully when he got to the human ears in the unlabeled butter tub.  No doubt John would have qualms.  Not that he would have served the ears, ever.
The sarcastic venom pools silently between them until Sherlock does something he’s never done before, not with John, and that is apologise.  Or at least try to.  He gets only two syllables into “I’m sorry”.
Luckily Sherlock has connections, has done favors for many people, and at least a few of those were tall, attractive, arrogant verging on infuriating men who don’t mind helping him out now even on short notice.  Sherlock has no illusions about his own personality, and since one observation is all he gets, at least for the moment, he wants to control as many variables as possible.  That’s the scientific reason, but he is also a bit afraid of John’s glower, and not sure that John wouldn’t eat one of his friendlier connections alive.
.  Too much in fact.  Far too much.  Before he knew what he was doing, he had pushed John’s hand away, and the lack of touch bit hard and tasted bloody and he closed his eyes and clenched his jaw and waited to feel how John would accomplish removing himself from the couch which Sherlock would give up willingly if he were a better person.
“Noise?” supplied Sherlock helpfully. Absently he noted that he’d just incinerated a shopping receipt. He hoped that Mrs. Hudson would overlook the scorch mark if he positioned an Erlenmeyer flask over it.
They break off kissing and Sherlock is gratified to see that John is up to 8 tells.  The number of tells does seem to be a good proxy indicator for arousal, and he wonders if there would be a proportional relationship between time spent kissing and arousal, or whether the depth of the kiss is a better indicator, or perhaps both.  Then John moves down to place an open-mouthed kiss on the other man’s throat.  Sherlock sees that his eyes flick up towards the other man’s face, assessing the results, then he moves a bit to the left, eye flick, a bit down, and apparently decides that’s the correct spot, because he stays there for almost 40 seconds, and by 20 the other man is moaning audibly.   After that John moves somewhat at random, kissing the other man’s neck, shoulders, and chest, but Sherlock sees that each time he moves on he searches until he finds whatever he’s looking for, and the other man is now easily over 2 dozen tells.
That’s hard because Sherlock doesn’t always fade.  Sometimes he explodes like a supernova streaking across their bedroom ceiling, shouting John’s name, laughing and crying at the same time, and John feels like a genius who has just discovered string theory or evolution or superconductors.
“I’m happy right now,” says John softly, realizing that it’s true. “I’m happy during a case. And watching telly. I’m happy that I’m here to have your back and patch you up and hear you spin your deductions out of straw.”
John looks like he’s been punched in the gut.  “I never meant--” he begins, but Sherlock beats him to it.  “Of course you didn’t.  You never do.”
“Used to do this when I was a kid,” he says by way of explanation, stepping onto the first bed and springing a foot into the air.  It takes a few jumps to get the feel of it back, and then he bounces, lands sprawlingly on his back, flips to his front in the air, goes heels over head to his back again, and lays there looking up at Sherlock.
“Exactly.  Clearly I need more data.”  John winced, because now Sherlock was doing that disconcerting thing where he had decided on an answer and was convinced it needed to be communicated at great speed and all in one breath.  Possibly before it could self-destruct.
John doesn’t realize, of course he doesn’t, since he’s by definition behind the closed door of his room at this point in the proceedings, but Sherlock’s unreasonably sharp ears are tuned to the snick of the lube cap popping off, to the faint rattle of John’s flies, to the even fainter sighing and creaking of John’s cheap metal bed. Every time, his damn ears prick up and his nose twitches with the desire to follow the traces.  Like a sodding beagle, he thinks sourly, but already his foot is on the first step to John’s room.
On the seventh Thursday, John sets himself to small tasks around the flat.  He finds a screwdriver to tighten a loose doorknob, rakes ashes and something else -- charred fingernails? -- from the bottom of the oven, and scrubs the sink drain.  In past relationships, he has found that having a task to do makes talking about potentially sensitive topics easier.  He hopes it’s a general rule, because he’s never had quite such a topic to broach.
Sherlock has promised (John made him swear twice, once on the skull and again on his own microscope) that he will lay low and won’t get himself killed before John can join him.  He wonders what it means, that he won’t ask Sherlock to swear on the Strad.
On Saturday, they get a fascinating case that involves a trip into the sewers, a jump from a second-story window to avoid the nanny, a missing carrot peeler and a mismatched stapler.  Sherlock is brilliant and John is happy to admire him, out loud, even with half of the Yard looking on.
something I wanted.  You’re not keeping me safe, really you’re not -- but you are … you have … something I want, you’ve transported me to a different existence, a place where things grow sideways and colors are different and, and, all the rules are changed --”
“I realize that a Friday or Saturday evening is more traditional, but your schedule varies week to week, and most of our cases involve a good deal of physical exertion on the weekend, whereas Tuesdays are statistically the most likely for episodes of severe boredom ending in walls being shot at, and that may not be very conducive to – this – so Thursday seems like a good compromise,” he finished in one breath.
Well, that was true in its own way.  That first night.  It could have happened to anyone, too.  Anyone who had been shot in the desert, come damn near to bleeding out on the sand, spent months too wracked from injury and therapy to even think about additional activities, then months after that avoiding his therapist despite a stress disorder compounded by clinical depression, then even more months after that being cockblocked by his sodding fuckmonkey of a flatmate who interrupted, interceded, invited himself on, or, in one memorable case, sent an actual ninja armed with nunchucks to break up his date for the evening -- the same sodding fuckmonkey who, on that first night, pored over John’s body with his bloody magnifying glass, while the heat of his lips and his breath and the feathering of his lashes made John moan and squirm and goddamn writhe under him.  John had gotten himself about halfway out of his trousers before coming rather spectacularly but still technically in his pants and untouched by Sherlock.  At which Sherlock had smiled his brilliant smile as if that had been the plan all along, and started chattering about fingerprints on ice-cube trays.
Sherlock was in a quandary.  Experimenting with Italian cuisine now would surely alert even John.  He would need an accomplice. Luckily Sherlock knew many people who owed him a favor, a few who pressed favors on him past owing, and a small-time criminal who often needed his name a bit clearer.  That’s how it happened that three mornings later, Sherlock was up early making ravioli, alternating between 3 differently shaped hand presses, a carved wooden rolling pin, and a shiny silver pasta machine with a crank handle and “property of Angelo” etched shakily into one side.  John eyed the tray as he made his tea, squinting, counting the rows, losing his place, starting over, and poking at a few of the odder shapes.  “It has to do with smuggling pieces of--“ Sherlock began, but John waved him silent.
