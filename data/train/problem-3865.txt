“I didn’t. I walked through the front door.” He punctuates it with a shit-eating grin, but Baldy just frowns at him, looking at him like he’s nothing more than a bug in a microscope.
Sam scrambles to pull a yellow legal pad out of his bag and flips to a fresh sheet. “I’ll need to see schematics,” he’s muttering, already pulling at his hair. “We should do this at night if we’re gonna go in and steal something physical. Less people around. Maybe tomorrow night?”
Cas' gaze turns quizzical, the longer Dean looks at him. He sets his cheeseburger down on his plate. "How are you, Dean? We haven't really...talked since I've been back."
Dean runs a hand through his hair. “I was just out for a jog and I saw some guys bashing the windows in.”
this dickbag before Cas is launching himself at Zachariah. They spar violently, landing hits on each other—but it’s clear that Castiel is the better fighter. Zachariah is already out of breath, with a paunch around his belly from where he’s probably spent too much time sitting at his desk and watching other people do the fighting. Cas, on the other hand, almost looks bored.
John’s built for smash and grabs. Quick jobs at an art gallery or a mansion. Security companies have cameras and guards and safes. Those kinds of jobs require
The bartender sways back over to him. She’s got a swirling tattoo on her arm and short dark hair. She sets another round in front of him. “Got yourself an admirer,” she says, motioning over to the other end of the bar.
His door is closed again, but someone must have opened it for Miracle, because he knows she went to sleep on Sam’s bed last night like a
He turns to give Dean an annoyed look, and almost runs straight into a kid texting on his phone. The kid is wearing a beanie and sunglasses—one of those too cool for school types that’s too busy on his phone to pay attention to the world around him. He twists out of the way just in time to avoid a collision, but fumbles his phone. It bounces on the sidewalk and lands at Sam’s feet.
Could it be that easy? He thinks about it all the way to the burger joint. Thinks about it as they’re walking inside and he unconsciously holds the door for Cas. Cas sends him a quick, appreciative smile, eyes crinkling at the corners.
,” he hears Sam say. He sounds tense. Probably expecting everything to go to shit. Dean can relate. It almost feels too easy. Who would’ve thought having a full crew would make things run so smoothly? “
As much as Sam hates to admit it, he missed the Impala. The smell of her; the rumble of the engine; the hypnotic rush of the highway beneath them.
good at is throwing punches. He’s never seemed to understand that you can’t get what you want by brute force, not all the time.
Chuck stands, seemingly grateful for an excuse to end this interview he didn’t know he was having. “Well—uh—Trisha—"
“Shut up,” Sam mutters. He takes in his surroundings for the first time. Woah. “You and Charlie are staying
Dean falls quiet at that, perhaps sensing that Cas doesn’t want to talk about this. He isn’t even sure why he told Dean that much, except that Dean is easy to talk to. There’s something about Dean that makes Cas
“So, what? Dad tried to steal this ledger and couldn’t? And now he’s on the run and wants you to grab it?”
Jack is flitting around, touching everything and using various synonyms for the word cool, but Castiel is just standing inside the door, like he’s a wind-up toy or something. Sam gives him a tentative smile. “You want to sit down? Get comfy?”
Sam shrugs and sits on the edge of a bed, opening the book. Charlie and Jack crowd in close behind him, peering over his shoulder. Castiel stays on the couch, unmoving.
He knows the soft, secretive smiles that Dean saves just for him. He knows the brutally honest, cracked open prayers that Dean choked out in purgatory. And the just as honest late-night conversations. The ones where Dean always used to ask (sounding heartbreakingly young):
The bartender flips the channel to a sports game, unaware of the seven eyes and ears that are gleefully watching the newscast. Dean turns to face their table—broad smile threatening to take over his face. He raises his glass. “Well how about that for a job well done? Huh? You guys hear that?”
When Jack gets thrown inside next to Dean, half of him is thrilled that everything’s going to plan so far, and the other half is scared to death that they’re going to beat the shit out of Jack just to get Dean to talk. It’s the easiest ploy in the book, and he can just see the cogs turning in Baldy’s mind. He hopes to God that Sam’s almost in place.
Sam shrugs. "It's weird. I used to think that Stanford is where I would have ended up if mom was alive." He laughs. "I used to think mom being alive meant that we would've had a normal life. But hearing Ellen talk about her--hearing how much she loved the life.... I don't know anymore. Maybe our life would've been just as fucked up
. He’s sure there’s a joke in there somewhere. He’s also not convinced that he’s down with relying on a 90-pound teenager to get him out of here.
“Dean and Sam are very good at their jobs,” Cas puts in earnestly—the first words he’s spoken since Dean interrupted whatever was going on between him and Sam. He makes a mental note to figure out what the hell that was about later—when they’re
Dean, absurdly, seems surprised by this. He laughs. “Sorry, man. I can’t picture it. What were you like? A loner? Or maybe one of those marching band geeks—?”
Cas ignores him. He drags Dean to the kitchen and takes a look around, trying to map out a strategy for the next few hours. The sink is empty and Jack and Sam are leaning against the counter in the midst of half made side dishes. Cas spots a stack of recipe cards that Dean has been waving around all morning and he flips through them quickly, frowning.
“Why not? Public places hold everyone accountable. Plus, everyone likes good food.” Dean has too many memories of tagging along with John to smoky back rooms in bars—angry men that were ready to fight at the slightest provocation. Dean likes his way better. He ups his pace, struggling to keep up with Sam’s stupidly long stride. “Jesus, will you slow down, Sammy?”
Cas cuts him off with a hard kiss, fingers twisted in Dean's flannel shirt. Someone that sounds suspiciously like Jack cheers and Garth breaks down into another round of sobs. Dean ignores them all and wraps his arms around Cas, gentling the kiss to something soft and tender.
“Okay then.” Dean turns to slaps the counter, letting the good feelings chase away the bad. “Bartender! Another round for me and my friend here!”
Reggie Baker is already fumbling with the door, cursing as he unlocks it and exits the building. He freezes before he can get too far, sending a suspicious look at Dean and pointedly locking the door behind him again before he bustles away.
And why Cas was trying to stop him? Trying to spare him from baring his soul in front of all of these people?
Victor rolls his eyes. “Get him out of here, guys.” They drag Adler out of the room, still screaming nonsense.
“Yeah,” he chokes out, ducking his head. His stomach is knotted with nerves. "Sorry about that. I haven't been sure what to say."
to flirt with the barista. “He’s changed, hasn’t he?” Sam says. “In some ways he’s the same, but in a lot of ways he’s different.”
“Dean,” Sam says helplessly. “Stop. This is a terrible plan. No wonder Dad got caught. You can’t just waltz into places like this.”
Cas offers his coffee out to Dean and Dean takes it with a grateful noise. Sam’s whole face contorts in confusion, eyes flicking between them, but Dean studiously ignores him. He knows it probably makes a weird sight—Dean being all buddy-buddy with a guy whose guts he hated six hours ago. He doesn’t care. That’s like the only good thing about being on his own now. Dean doesn’t have to explain himself to anyone. Well…except sometimes Charlie.
Ellen and Jack climb out of the van and stroll down the street. As they walk, Charlie’s typing furiously. She creates a press release, embeds a few email chains, and rearranges some meetings on the boss’s schedule all before they step foot into the lobby.
Charlie screeches to a halt in a hotel parking lot. Sam doesn’t even question where they are, too intent on not puking from the (frankly terrifying) way Charlie had been taking corners.
Sam used to think that he would hate getting back in this car, but he doesn’t. It’s comforting. Nice. …Even
Things move quickly after Sam rallies the troops. They end up in the room Charlie booked for Castiel and Jack—which is cleaner than the room Dean, Charlie, and Sam were sharing and doesn’t smell like dirty socks. Everyone is chattering excitedly, ready to make like David and take down the Goliath. It’s a weird job. They won’t be stealing anything, but they’ll be using their considerable skills to do something good. Make it right. There’s something healing about it.
“You think I don’t know that?” Dean asks, voice pained. His eyes are closed. “You think I didn’t ask myself every damn day why dad couldn’t pull his shit together and be a father? But he’s still our
“He didn’t give me a ton of details,” Charlie says. “But he seems harmless. He can’t be any older than Jack.”
“Relax,” Bobby says, with a roll of his eyes. “We spooked ‘em alright. But there’ll be plenty of evidence.”
You see, it is not easy to witness this...ending of endings. A moment that is a reminder of how much it has cost, a reminder of how much I have taken, even with all that I have given.
man, that he had hurt him, that he had been cruel. It shouldn't have mattered that he was leaving him behind, left alone to fend for himself on earth made hell by his hand.
Dean would understand, he told himself, even as he shattered his trust. Even as he witnessed the breaking of it in his emerald eyes set alight by the flames of Holy Fire. Dean would understand, and he would forgive Cas when he did. He had to believe that he would.
When he reads the notes folded into old tomes, he is not excited. When he is told about their next haunt, he is only resigned. Determined and ready, yes, but resigned.
I think he got too wrapped up in writing them to remember that they could exist without him - that he'd only needed to set the wheel turning, not direct its path.
Dean turns his face away from mine, and Sam begins to ask me a question, hurt lacing his voice and his words. And it is all too familiar, this distance I feel now. This chasm that seems uncrossable.
He was Castiel, an angel who had fallen, for the sake of Man. An angel who had fallen, in every way imaginable.
So he slips it through a silver chain and loops it around his neck. The ring falls over his beating heart, and it is silly, he knows, but with every breath he takes, he feels a little closer to the mother he has lost.
He is here with me, now, guiding my every step. An angel on my shoulder. A father, in every sense of the word that matters. A friend.
But this is an ending, and so I persevere. I squeeze their palms with mine, and then will myself away, taking them with me.
He looked back once, watching as Dean walked towards the house clutching a bag full of debris, and felt something heavy settle behind his ribs. It was guilt, he reasoned, for he knew, even then, that Dean would not have approved.
There is one last ending left, one ending I must witness before the wheel turns, and this story frays into the next one.
Sam finds solace in the world that never stopped needing them, even after their story was over. He works, reading spells and brewing potions, drawing book after book from shelves to find the thing that would keep this demon - that god, this monster - at bay.
It is Dean who reaches me first, his arms pulling me into an embrace that feels like home. Like coming back here after all this time. Like hearing my mother's voice the first time.
She told me he was crafted from the light that shines the brightest in this world, and that he is my father. She told me that I will shine, a star in his image. That I will be the warmth his light ushers in.
Still, I am here for a reason. So I smile, and it is pained, but it is also real, and that is enough.
He spends the time he has left clearing the remnants of the people they've lost from their home. He finds a cheap ring of tarnished silver at the bottom of a drawer in his mother's room. He knows it is not an important talisman. It is hardly a talisman, at all. But it is something of hers.
The emptiness under my feet feels solid even though I know it isn't, and it is eerie, still, to think that a thing that is the manifestation of non-existence...well,
His next step into the water submerged him, and for an instant, he was still, suspended in the deep blue that pressed against him, the darkness within him a tornado that twisted — foul, angry, a vortex of immeasurable power. And then it pulled. At the water, the air...at
I realize I must begin somewhere, somehow. But it is hard, which is an unexpected hurdle. I look to the men who sit before me now, and I note that they are older. Their skin doesn't quite sag, just yet, but there is grey at their temples, spots of white like salt in their beards. When they smile, the lines dig deeper into the skin by their eyes than they ever had before.
In the end, I do not say the word. I think the brothers know, just as well as I do, that this is farewell. Of a kind, anyway. There is a certain defiance to that sort of thing when you're human, though. And I carry a bit of that humanity in me, still.
He had been afraid of the plunge for so long, teetering at the edge of this precipice, tethering himself to the soil and rock in desperation, choice after choice made in the name of protecting a world he wasn't even a part of. But now he was in freefall, the universe falling away from him in thick, black rivulets, and he saw, perhaps truly, for the first time, the nature of the falsehoods he had told himself.
It is the last thing he touches, now - the old, unspooling cassette tape, as if he is uttering a prayer. As if he is parting with the last tether of a memory. As if this is goodbye.
They never had children, so to speak. But they have had me. They have had the young people that they trained and taught, that they fought with and loved. So fully. So fiercely.
Perhaps he would lose, his worst fear come to life, ripping him from everything and everyone in this world that he had placed his life on the line for.
First, it is only calls to their friends. Their family. The girls in Sioux Falls, the friends in Duluth. Then, it is the little gatherings.
In this place in between places, in between times, he waits, his face upturned, drinking in a yellow sun, savouring the light that gilds his raven hair and fair skin like a halo. He waits with his wings outstretched, fanned about him, and it is almost impossible to deny the stories my mother told me. Stories of Castiel, the Angel of Thursday, the Angel made of Light.
I tell them why I call on them and there is hurt and confusion and anger in their faces. I realize that they have been betrayed too many times, burned too often, for them to see this for the gift that it is meant to be. The choice that it truly is.
a nest, however, and the Winchesters are only two. The odds are not in their favour, even with their guns and their machetes.
He hadn't forgotten the price Dean had already paid for a battle he had been thrust into the midst of, and here he was, come to ask him to do it again. To take more from a man who had given all there was to give once before. Everything he had sacrificed, and here was Castiel, about to ask him for more.
Odd things, they are, these vampires. Like caricatures from Dean's favourite horror films. Masks pulled over their heads, teeth hidden behind thick fabric. Their only weapons disguised in favour of...theatrics.
There is an odd strength there, in the way he goes about his day, pulling flannel over his arms, breaking eggs over a hot skillet, folding notes into old tomes, flipping through the news to find their next haunt. An odd defiance that is not quite...explicable.
It was worry, he told himself, for a friend, a fellow soldier, that saw him wind up in the trees across from the brightly lit kitchen window. It was selfish pride, he reasoned, a thing to prove to himself — that choices could be made. That freedom was not an ephemeral thing, lost in the face of difficulty and doubt.
I give the heroes a choice. Of peace. Of contentment. Of the moment where they can catch their breath, where they can lay their arms down, pass their burden on, and say, It is over. I am ready.
When the brothers look to me, they are young once more in all but the glint of their eyes. They look the way they did on the day of my birth. On the day I was reborn. On the day the universe demanded one last thing from them.
who refused to be wielded in a war that would break the world for the sake of it, in the name of an absent God.
There is a story my mother once told me. About an angel named Castiel. She told me he was crafted from the light that shines the brightest in this world - the light that glitters on the surface of the sea like diamonds, the light that softens the darkness in an empty room at night, the light that bathes the world in silver and gold when there is nothing but silence and snow.
No. It is not easy, this thing that signals the closing of the curtains, this last sentence of the story. Still, it is inevitable.
He broaches it with questions about the night they do not speak of anymore. Dean wavers, his knuckles paling as he grips the fork in his hands harder. But then he sighs, sips from the glass of amber liquid by his plate, and begins to tell his story.
She bites her lip, fiddling with the coffee maker. “Not really. We’re not really friends, but I don’t believe he would cheat. Kevin is really smart. Even smarter than me,” she admits grudgingly after a moment. "Everybody was really surprised when he got caught."
Dean might have learned how to get what he wanted without using his fists, but his dad is another story. John Winchester was—
“It’s funny,” Baldy says. “We had a break in last night, you know. Someone stole something very precious. Three people actually. You two match the descriptions of two of the perpetrators.”
It’s the closest they’ve ever gotten to acknowledging the fucking huge elephant in the room. Cas is looking out of the corner of his eye at him, like he's not sure Dean wants to spend time with him anymore. It makes Dean feel sick. It's only been a week since Cas has been back, and Dean has spent the whole time existing in a haze of disbelief and quiet panic. He'd been so obsessed with actually getting Cas back, that he never stopped to prepare himself for what it would be like once they did.
Dean chews on his lip for a minute, thinking. He doesn’t want to have John Winchester’s life. Doesn’t want to be the lonely bastard that drinks alone. Dean has exactly one friend. He can’t afford to turn any potential ones away.
The name sends a cold blast of silence rippling around the table. Smiles dim and fingers fidget. Dean feels a little guilty for ruining the easy comradery of the morning, but if Bobby’s here to give them bad news, then he’d rather not play pretend.
Right now, he’s erring on the side of love—mostly because of how good the bartender’s taking care of him. Dean’s been wallowing away his sorrows with a bottle of Jack and is on his way to well and truly numb—just the way he likes it.
Cas shrugs and lets the subject drop, going back to observing the daily flow of foot traffic in and out of Ridgemont Prep. He tries to ignore the sting from Dean’s words, but it’s harder than it normally is to conceal his emotions. Embarrassingly, Dean seems to pick up on this.
Charlie hums a little, like she doesn’t quite believe him. It’s fair. Sam doesn’t know if he believes himself.
, Dean reminds himself sharply—a hitter through and through. His dad’s never liked Dean’s penchant for talking; always thought there were easier, bloodier ways to get what he needs. Dean never knew how to tell him that it was
“The Feds will catch up with them sooner or later,” Charlie says. “I'll make sure of it. Just be happy, Cas. We did it!”
Victor cocks his head. “Let me get this straight. Your story is that thieves stole this ledger, and then returned to the scene of the crime, beat you up, and planted the ledger on your body. And then they disappeared without being seen by any FBI agents?”
Dean wiggles out of the zip ties, wincing as the plastic cuts into his hands. Baldy and his goons booked it out of here pretty fast when the “FBI” showed up, but they could be back any second. If they get back before Cas finds them, Dean wants to be ready to fight.
Dean holds up his hand before Cas, looking extremely disturbed, can respond. "So let me get this straight: We fucked over the people who killed mom
Everyone turns to Cas, mouths agape. Sam lets the ledger sag in his hands, eyeing Cas warily. “What?”
immediately saw all the ways that could go wrong. You’ve always been better at thinking through plans. If this is gonna work, we need someone to run the show.”
Dean has doubts he’ll ever see Jack after tonight, but Jack is appeased by his answer and quiets down. In his earbud, Charlie directs them to a door with a key card reader. Dean swipes Reggie’s keycard, but the reader beeps red. The door stays locked.
He looks at Cas desperately. Cas rolls his eyes, but thankfully takes pity on him. “Yes,” he says, resting a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Don’t worry. I’ll fight them off.”
been avoiding looking anywhere but in his direction, and still appears anxious to do so, now. But, pulling the comforter tighter around himself, he straightens his spine some and seeks Dean’s face, uncertain. Their eyes meet, Dean looks a heartbreaking mix of disillusioned distrust and desperate, fragile hope.
Sam feels a sudden giggle tickling his chest. Dean presses the heel of his palm to his eye, swearing under his breath. “I know where that is. It’s, uh… I mean, we should check, but, there’s a Cass on Route 66. It should be about four-ish hours from here. Five if we drive to the speed limit.”
“‘Course we’re here,” Dean says gruffly. He pauses in his movement to look back at Castiel and licks his lips. “Hey, uh… Maybe there're some things
Sam sits, back against the booth, with his eyebrows high on his forehead. He reflects on how Dean has been so happy since yesterday, and how broken he’s been for the past year, and thinks maybe he missed some clues. One thing is pretty easy to conclude, though. Must have been one hell of a last conversation, they shared. He looks at the tabletop, scratching his hairline, trying to keep his grin from breaking his face. He shakes his head and peeks up, makes a face and raps his knuckles on the table as he gets up. “I’m gonna go pay. Meet you at the car.”
The holy water does nothing beyond wet Cas’ skin. Sam blinks when Castiel extends his hand, looking expectant and resigned at the same time. He decides that’s another sign that this is likely his friend, standing there, because he knows Sam well. He reaches for his inside pocket and pulls the silver knife he always carries out of his coat. Castiel maneuvers so that the bedding doesn’t fall off him, and takes a bracing breath before running his thumb along the sharp edge of the blade. He hisses. Sam can’t help the joyful chuckle he lets out when Castiel hands back the knife, sucking his thumb into his mouth with a disgruntled expression. “Please, don’t hit me with iron,” he asks, quietly.
Mannish Boy cuts off abruptly when Dean’s phone starts to ring. Blinking himself out of his rigid reading posture, Dean presses the phone to his ear and kicks out the leg he had folded under himself. “Garth, thanks for calling me back, did you f-...” something happens to startle Dean into staring at his phone. In the next second, he is scrambling to his feet, white as a sheet, dropping the device to the floor with a clatter, eyes fixed on it like it may try to attack.
Castiel fails to answer. Dean’s jaw works, his eyes flick to the phone and back, frowning. Sam looks between him and the phone, as if it’s going to hold answers for him. Eventually, Cas speaks.
He meets the eye of the waiter, who’s hanging with the girl that’s behind the bar, he lifts his hand from Cas’ shoulder and receive smiles and nods of acknowledgement as they walk out.
A second passes, then Cas beams. He positively lights up, dropping his chin, unable to control his grin.
Sam, who jumped to his feet as well, stares at the name on the display. The call, which is still open, reads ‘
Confused, Sam steps forward to embrace Cas first, nonetheless, careful not to step on bare toes. “Hey, buddy. S’good to have you back.”
Still, they both step out of the car to meet Castiel halfway. Dean walks alongside Sam, but hangs back the last few steps. Castiel, brows drawn a little, looks pointedly at the flask in Sam’s hand. “Test me, please.” His fingers spider nervously on the edge of the comforter. “I would like to make sure as well.”
, but… I also want to be on the job, having your back, if you are, so… I kind of mean us, yeah. Sorry.”
couldn’t. There’s no need to explain. Sam is very much hoping this isn’t some kind of trick, and it’ll be incredibly painful if it turns out to be one; but he’s not an idiot, he’s well aware it would be much worse on Dean. He understands the last step urge to
Robert, the cook at the diner with his dark hair pulled back in an ever-present ponytail, would melt away to a quiet, tall man with long hair who would alternate between studying a laptop and sleeping soundly against the window. If it wasn’t the tall man, Robert would melt away to reveal a surly-looking college student with dark hair and hurt eyes whose arms were constantly curled around a backpack.
“The ghost was friskier than I expected.” Dean gave him a lazy wink. “I can’t help it that even the dead want a piece of this.”
It was only when the light started to fade as the sun started to set that Cas finally broke the silence. “Why today?”
Sam started ordering food for himself and their mom. When he was finished, Dean fought with his tongue and managed to fumble out an order of food for himself and for Cas. If the angel didn’t feel like eating today, then Dean could swap plates with him.
Dean scoffed. “Are you kidding? You could stand up right now, announce you were single and ready to mingle in the middle of this bar and have ten people clobbering each other for a chance with you.”
When they got closer to the theater, Dean noticed a group of people standing outside in a rough circle. They were holding hands with their heads bowed. Dean and Sam exchanged a glance. Sam shook his head to indicate that he hadn’t seen them out front before when he was in line.
There was a challenge written in Cas's angry eyes. A challenge and an ultimatum. Mary’s words about needing to make a choice echoed in Dean’s head.
“How many of these have you had already this morning?” Dean asked as he held up Castiel’s empty coffee mug.
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean’s back. Dean could feel Cas’s smile radiating off of him like sunrise over a dark horizon.
Dean paused for a heartbeat. Just long enough to remember what the hell Cas was talking about. When he remembered he could feel the ache in the corners of his mouth from smiling so wide before he grabbed the back of Cas’s head and pulled their mouths together.
Sam glared at Dean’s use of his childhood nickname. “Yes, someone said it looked like a ghost. But it’s not like the general public know what a ghost looks like.”
“Why Cas?” Dean asked. “Why the hell would you want to stay here with me? You know we’re going to die here.”
He straightens up and heads over to Dean apologetically. Dean takes hold of a random mop bucket, and starts towards the door. “You aren’t gonna freak out on me, are you?”
Sam bristles even more at that and Dean practically leaps the last few feet, plunking down the food and coffee in the middle of the table before he can answer. Cas and Sam both jump at the interruption.
He brings his fist around in a solid hit and Zachariah slumps in his grip. Cas follows him down and keeps hitting him. He doesn’t look bored anymore. He looks furious.
Cas has never respected Grifters much. Has never liked how they lie and scheme and cheat their way to their goal. But Dean is different. Dean is a Grifter, but he still puts stock in things like promises.
Jack and Dean burst out of the staff exit—Jack almost tripping on the uneven pathway. Dean grabs him by the arm and yanks him upright as they careen towards the parking lot. Charlie’s yellow van is idling in wait, the back doors hanging open. Dean and Jack jump in, panting for breath.
Dean snorts. “Yeah. Just tell them a law school student, a nerd, and a high school dropout need some back up. They’ll be begging to come join the Dream Team.”
When he finally looks at Cas again, his expression has transformed into something awed and hopeful. "Dean, you didn't have to do that."
Cas narrowed his eyes. “Because I’d never danced with anyone before, and it looked like fun. I knew you would say no and Ricky seemed amiable.”
It wasn’t until Jessie and Kim were having dinner with Jessie’s boyfriend and Dean was forced to watch the girls pine for each other from across the table and behind the walls society put between them that Dean’s thoughts strayed back to Danny.
His feet had carried him into the kitchen. There was a void in his stomach gnawing absently on his insides. Whether that meant he was hungry or nauseous he didn’t really care anymore.
“It sounds like you struggled with this role a bit, when did it finally click for you?” Donna asked.
Cas's hand was warmer than Dean’s, warmer than a human’s hand thanks to what was left of his grace burning blue-white hot deep inside him. Dean wrapped his other arm around Cas's lower back and pulled him close so that their chests were almost touching. Being this close to him was something that Dean craved more than he cared to admit. Denying himself this contact hurt something deep in his soul.
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas's body and pulled him close enough that he could practically feel the outline of Cas's ribcage on his own.
Dean whipped his head around to look at the door leading out of the room. Cas shut the door behind himself and looked from Dean to the tv. Dean swiped at the tears on his cheeks. He could feel himself starting to blush, because his day really needed to get worse by blushing and crying in front of Cas of all people.
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean. His fingers dug into the thin fabric of Dean’s work uniform t-shirt. His beard was soft and rough against Dean’s temple. “I always come back to you, Dean.”
The dull humming coming from the orb grew louder and higher pitched. Dean winced and tried to lean away from the noise as he drove.
Roughly twelve hours later, Dean and Cas woke up in a disorienting tangle of naked limbs, sheets, and pillows on Dean’s bed as Sam kicked in the door, flipped on the overhead lights, and started blaring Etta James’s “At Last” from a Bluetooth speaker he’d picked up a few months before.
“She turned full-on lesbo,” the hunter said. “Moved to Illinois and started banging some chick. She was married to that guy Harper for a while. You remember him?”
A chill ran down Sam’s spine. It’s not that he didn’t trust the angel, he just didn’t know him like Dean apparently did.
When they got back onto the highway on their way to the movie theater, Dean started to feel Sam staring holes into his cheek.
He let go of Cas’s wrist as Cas wrapped his hand around the nape of Dean’s neck until he was cradling Dean’s head.
“I love you, dumbass,” Dean said. “I watched everything I gave a shit about shatter into pieces in front of me when you died this time. I couldn’t handle it, so I fucking ran because of you. Because I love
Joyce would melt away to show a girl with blonde hair twirling a knife between her fingers or a girl with red hair and a bright smile who talked with her hands while recounting sword fights.
“Playing waiter, apparently,” Castiel said as he pushed the coffee towards Dean. “I’m not interrupting anything, am I? Are you waiting for your date?”
“We’ll meet you at the motel,” Castiel said before he hung up the phone and slipped it back into his pocket. He crossed the room to the duffle again and pulled out more clothes for Dean. This time he placed them gently on the bed within Dean’s reach instead of throwing them at him. “I’m going to check in with your nurse to see what is taking so long.”
Dean’s phone vibrated in his pocket. He thought about ignoring it, but they’d had too many close calls lately and he didn’t want to ignore a call for help. He pulled out his phone, saw that it was Sam, and gestured for Cas to follow him outside where he could actually hear what Sam had to say.
If he spent the time before succumbing to sleep committing every detail of their encounter from the time Castiel had knocked on the door to the moment Dean finally slept in hopes that it would be immortalized one day if Dean made it back to heaven, no one would need to know.
“No, you didn’t,” Dean said. “I don’t know what’s wrong with that guy or how he ended up as a ghost, but I know two things.” Dean pushed Castiel down the row of seats toward the aisle of stairs. “You didn’t cause whatever the hell that was. And I know how to wake him up from this nightmare.”
“I’ll hold you to that,” Dean said. Everything in him felt rubbed raw and exposed. “Don’t take too long or I’ll have to come after you myself.”
The two of them grew close after Dean was returned to the states and his job with KCPD. When Castiel’s contract with the government was up, he took a job at the police department and became Dean’s work partner shortly after. The last few years Castiel had spent by Dean’s side were the best of his life. Even if they were only friends.
“And here I thought you were looking for a Stepford Wife of your own,” Castiel said. “I guess i should tell the Girl Scout leader and the physical therapist ladies I had waiting on standby that you’ve changed your mind.”
Finally, Cas met Dean’s eyes. There was so much weight in the expression on his face, Dean felt like he was staring down a tornado or a train, or maybe bracing himself on a beach somewhere while a giant wave crested on the horizon.
“We’re hunting a ghost angel,” Dean said with a grin. “A ghangel. Oh, or an anost. Hey, that almost sounds cool.”
Dean cupped Cas’s cheek. His chest ached. “I should have been there when you woke up. I shouldn’t have taken off like that.”
Dean turned to look at the pot now sitting there full and ready. Maybe the coffee would help warm him up. Dean turned back to Cas to offer him coffee out of habit when he realized the kitchen was empty again. His shoulders slumped. He reached into the pocket of his dead guy robe and ran a finger over the edge of the mixtape he’d taken from Cas’s body.
“Why does the FBI care?” Scott asked. “Was there something more to his death than what the police told me?”
Mary and Sam were walking through the rows of seats right in front of the screen. The rows were spread across flat ground instead of the ones raising closer and closer to the high ceiling.
Dean tapped the flyer with his index finger and pulled out his phone. He brought up Cas’s contact information and hit call. While the phone rang, Dean played the video one more time on mute. There was something odd about the angel in the video, but he couldn’t put his finger on what it was.
“You sure you don’t want to go back to the motel to ice your back?” Sam asked. “I don’t think Mom and Cas would mind meeting us there.”
Dean didn’t realize he’d let go of Cas’s hand and wandered away until he felt the cool glass of the jewelry counter beneath his hands. A bored teenager in an oversized sweater with purple streaks in their dark hair sat behind the counter scrolling through something on their cell phone. He cleared his throat, trying to get the teenager’s attention. When the teenager rolled their eyes up from the phone screen to look at Dean, he smiled and pointed at the poster.
“Christina Aguilera is a very talented singer, Dean,” Cas said. “And you said we could listen to the tape I found.”
Mary and Sam left the diner first. Dean and Cas stayed behind to pay the bill. Dean wished he was surprised to see Ricky’s phone number scribbled on the back of the receipt when the waiter handed it to him. He folded the paper up and shoved it in his wallet. He’d burn it later.
Sam had spent more than enough time living with Dean in situations that gave both of them little to nothing in the way of privacy. He’d suspected since he was a young teenager that his older brother liked guys too, but he’d never had real proof. Still, suspicions and instincts concerning Dean’s feelings about Cas weren’t reason enough to out Dean to their mom. Or anyone. It wasn’t Sam’s place.
“Maybe if you weren’t such a short little bitch you’d be able to catch up to me easier,” Dean said with a lazy smile.
Cas shook his head as his smile widened. “I don’t know. I was thinking of how I never thought you’d insist on cuddling and then I started to laugh and now I can’t stop. Human emotions are still so strange.”
Dean wasn’t facing them when Cas said it, but Sam recognized the disappointed lilt in his brother’s shoulders. It was gone by the time Dean turned to pat Cas on the shoulder. “Okay buddy, it was good to see you.”
Dean gritted his teeth for a moment before plastering on a fake smile. He flashed the fake grin at Sam before turning back to the road.
Sam called the woman behind the film festival and set up a meeting while Mary got cleaned up. He decided to work the writing research angle. The woman sounded intrigued and suggested they meet at a nearby cafe.
Four hours later, Dean sidles up to the front door of Free Will. It’s dark inside, but he bangs on the door until a suspicious looking guard comes out to the lobby and stalks over to the front door.
Their food comes and they eat quietly, Cas slipping away to go to the bathroom. When he returns, he asks: “So, what are you going to do now that you’re 42?”
“Yes,” Cas admits. “When I went to the bathroom. I can assure you that I genuinely regret it now.” There’s a desperate quality in his voice. Maybe he wants to continue their conversation just as badly as Dean does.
“I could…” Cas’ mouth twists and he looks away. “I could ask him to come if you’d be more comfortable with him.”
Dean shrugs, a fake smile on his face. “Works for me. One night wonders are basically my whole thing.”
They turn around when there’s a knock at the window. Castiel has scooted his butt forward to sit, crisscross applesauce, and look up at them through the car window with an expectant smile and puppy eyes. He’s got thick socks on, black jeans, a dark gray long sleeved t shirt with Dean’s latest favorite flannel on top. Sam laughs helplessly. “I’ve missed you, Cas.”
Castiel smiles, and Dean wishes they could have died like this, instead. Staring into Cas’ eyes, staring into goodbye. Wishes it’d stop now, on the verge of despair, on the cutting edge of goodnight, before he gets too weak to even honor his promise to another loved one he couldn’t save.
touch, he’s not sure he’ll manage to stop for very long, anytime soon. “We’re getting our own room tonight. I wanna spend some more time kissing you - possibly a lot more - without sexiling my brother,” he declares, voice low.
Sam is sitting by the motel window, having attempted to fold his entire frame between the two legs of the tiny table. He’s scrolling through some local maps of Canton and its surroundings to try and parse what could make for a good vampire nesting site in the area. The only sounds are the regular white noise of the pouring rain outside and Dean tapping his thumb along Muddy Waters’ beat, tinny music coming directly out of his phone. Periodically, there will be the sound of Dean sighing, flipping a page, or going back to reference an index; and, occasionally, the distant sound of a car rolling slowly by in the downpour.
Dean preens. “That’s Miracle. He’s the goodest of all the good boys.” Sam would say he ‘glows’ as he speaks of the dog, but he’d probably get a vicious boot in the shin for it. “Eileen’s watching him at the moment. She’s at the bunker. Her and Donna are working some tech-y intel for a case. Above my pay grade.”
Dean makes a sound, and wraps himself around Castiel further when the other man finally lays a tentative hand on his back. “Hi, Cas.” Dean’s hand cups the back of Castiel’s neck. “Welcome home.”
“Us too. I'll let you know when we have anything. Promise.” Sam sits in that for a while, absorbing the information. What the hell did that mean? He couldn’t make much sense of it. Eventually, he couldn’t help himself. “.... Dean?”
Sam swallows. It does sounds like Castiel. Which is confirmed when he glances up at Dean and finds his brother with his eyes closed and lips pressed in a queasy line.
Dean watches Sam weave through the tables. His posture’s a little stiff. He’s going to have to poke and prod, later. He knows that 2x4 did more damage to his ribs that he’s let on. Sam looks tired, Dean thinks. He’s always thought of his Sammy as a baby-faced, Sasquatch-sized manboy. But lately, when Sam doesn’t know he’s watching. When Dean looks in the mirror. Maybe for the first time, Dean thinks they look their age. He feels his age, too.
They fall into step easily, Cas fitting himself against his side like it’s a practiced move. It makes warmth tingle all over Dean’s body. “I know. I’m getting soft in my old age. Retirement does that to ya.”
When they’re finishing scrubbing most of the grime away and stashing the weapons, Dean pauses halfway through closing the trunk of the Chevy. “Did you ever… uh. Hear me?” he asks. Castiel gives him a patented head tilt of confusion. “I guess I… prayed?” Dean clarifies. “After you, uh… when you were gone.”
Something happens, it’s like shutters fall away from Castiel’s face. An abrupt shift in his expression when he sees something in Dean’s eyes. He looks cold, and embarrassed, and ashamed, and very, very lost, but the fearful and guarded look disappear in the blink of an eye. Not that he actually blinked, mind you. Neither does Dean, when Sam checks. He’s staring at Cas with the same face he had when they first saw him from inside the car, except now there’s the hint of a smile that’s starting to tug at his lips. A lot is communicated between the two men, but Sam only gets the intensity of it, not much of the meaning. In all evidence, it’s enough, because Dean’s entire body slumps with relief. “Yeah, that’s him,” he breathes out, winded and incredulous, eyes still locked on Castiel.
The first times Dean experienced devastating loss, as an adult, he thought he wasn’t going to be able to take it. He wasn’t going to survive the pain, the howling emptiness. But he
Dean’s eyes flit from Sam to Castiel, and he gives a breathless little laugh. “Not sure I can let go,” he says, expression devastatingly open. The blunt, bare honesty is uncharacteristic when it comes to what Dean’s feeling, and Sam sees the moment it hits Castiel. His eyes widen in realization just as Dean steps in to claim his own hug, as if he expected another kind of response. Cas’ smile wobbles, eyes filling with moisture, when Dean gathers him in. “Hello, Dean,” he manages, voice rough.
They drive on. Dean reaches over and slaps a pack of roasted chickpeas on Sam’s chest with a comment about rabbit food. It’s more for the sake of brotherly banter than actual judgement, considering Dean’s not even hiding the fact that he kept a second one in the pile in front of him. They lapse into silence, again. Castiel drinks more water, eats something crunchy that sounds like m&m’s, then chews on a Twizzler of his own.
Sam glances over to find Dean, eyes a little wet, staring at him. Like he’s touched that Sam would be here, today. Like he just remembered how much Sam loves them both. Like he’s sorry he’s been unable to recover from the loss. Sam will get to Dean’s instinct to blame himself for everything, including his own pain, later. For now, he reaches over and squeezes Dean’s arm. “He’s family,” he says, firmly. Because that’s what Cas is.
He reads the answer out loud. “Rowena says… this is wonderful news.” He exchanges a surprised look with Dean at the phrasing. “And says to holler if you…” Sam frowns. “...wanna learn more about 5B?”
Sam eyes the damage. “Yep. That one’s done.” The entire sleeve has come off at the top, half of it torn and the other ripped at the seam.
Dean feels under the layers. “Yeah. Bit bruised, maybe.” Dean grumbles. “At least, the job’s done,” he declares, voicing the bright side out loud. “We’re going home.”
Dean means to protest, to, futilely, try to find another way, to brainstorm a miracle. Anything not to have to face what’s coming. Not to have to
Instead, he drums a nervous beat on the table, chewing his lower lip in consideration. “Hey, Sammy.”
“We’re not at the bunker. We’re on a job.” Sam cuts in. Dean shoots him a sharp look, but Sam shrugs, it isn’t like he said where they actually are.
pale and tired than he usually is, that is. Ever since… Ever since so many things. Sam isn’t sure Dean’s had a proper night of sleep in months.
“Oh, yeah, I’m good.” Sam flops down, slumping a little in his seat with fatigue, content to finish his water. He does not seem to notice Dean and Cas’ hands are still linked on the bench between them. Dean doesn’t make a move to break the connection.
“I love you, too,” Dean says, hand coming to touch Castiel’s face. Something haunted lurks in his eyes at the memory of the last time they stood like this. “And don’t you dare think I wouldn’t, ever again.” He strokes his thumb along Cas’ cheekbone, serious, searching his eyes. “I mean it, Cas.
“Yeah.” Sam sits up, squaring his shoulders. He may be tired, but Dean looks like this day has ruined him, on top of the exhaustion he’s been carrying around to begin with. Castiel is sporting dark shadows under his eyes and still shivers periodically. “I’ll let you know if I start flagging.” Which he won’t. Flag, that is. That’s one thing he can do for them, right now.
Castiel twists his wrist faintly, shifting his hand so Dean’s fingers fall between his own. “Is it?” He needs to hear it. To make sure.
“I mean, I’m not sure about the color. But the vest look. It works.” Dean takes a breath. “Or, I dunno. Picket fence. All that.” Castiel looks up again. “Shit. I can picture it, I think… Two point five cats and a dog. You, with a cup of tea and readers on. Earning a living as some ancient cryptic language expert. Hives in the backyard.”
Sam stares at his brother. A man completely different from the guy who said he’d die with a knife in his hand, years ago. Completely different from the haunted shell he was twenty four hours ago. Because one thing changed, and everything feels different for it. “But, Dean…” He finds himself smirking. “If we retire, how will you ever get to use the shuriken?” he teases.
for it. But Castiel speaks again, before he can. He offers words Dean didn’t expect to hear again. Ever. From anyone.
The scene is so picturesque, it could be out of one of those recent, gritty, ‘return of the noir’ types of tv shows, Sam thinks. But for the two of them, it’s also so pedestrian. This their
Castiel appears in the entrance, shaking gore off his hand. He wipes his knife before sliding it back in its sheath. He hands the rag over to Sam when he and Dean catch up to him; together, they walk out of the old barn. “The masks were a bit much,” Castiel comments.
It’s Dean having a future with Cas in it. It’s Castiel wanting to be part of it. Romantically. It’s Dean’s first kiss with a man since he was twenty five. And it’s Castiel’s mouth against his, Castiel’s hand in his.
Castiel’s hand cups under Dean’s forearm, ever so gentle. “I need you to know you are worthy of love, Dean Winchester. And I need you to live.” He punctuates his request by taking a half step forward, his hand applying a little more pressure. Grounding.
On the one hand, sitting across from Dean and Castiel in a diner booth, attempting to fit his own legs under the table without kicking either of them, is very familiar. On the other hand, Cas wearing Dean’s clothes and a five o clock shadow is something that Sam hasn’t seen in ages. This time around, however, Castiel seems quite content to be here, if a still bit baffled to find he has a place, for some reason. He doesn’t seem to be mourning his status as a powerful being or having a mission to accomplish. Instead, he says he’s excited at the prospect of eating peach cobbler, the smell of laundry detergent and dreaming. However, he is still very much Castiel, and has already complained about the low efficiency of the human bladder function.
Sam takes a picture of the two of them. Dean happily munching on the end of a Twizzler, glowing as he takes in Cas, real, human, and alive, right there with them. He texts it to Rowena with a shrug emoji and ‘we have no idea’.
Sam takes a step back. The way Castiel looks on the verge of tears makes him swallow some of his own. It’s going around, it seems. Dean’s sharp exhale sounds suspiciously wet as well, and he turns his face into Castiel’s neck. The shift makes Cas stumble closer, a bare foot landing half on top of Dean’s shoe. There’s a rustle of fabric, Cas wrestling with the duvet to free his movements further when it gets in the way of hugging Dean closer. They’re properly clinging to each other, and it brings a bittersweet twist to Sam’s heart. Dean is trembling with the magnitude of it all, petting the back of Cas’ head. It betrays how glad it is, now, but it also speaks of all the grief over Cas’ absence he’s being stonily carrying around until now.
In response, Cas steps closer, only to stop when Dean waves him off. “You should…” Dean gestures jerkily between Sam and Castiel. “... say hi first.”
This is it. This stupid fucking plan is going to work and Cas’ going to… There is a squelch from behind him, and he turns to see black, animated ooze from The Empty seeping in. He feels hot, helpless tears fill his eyes. They blur his vision when he turns back to Cas, who’s stepped closer. Panic compresses Dean’s chest.
The drive is tense. Sam keeps the traffic radio on low for some background noise. The rain peters out about an hour out of Canton, but Dean gets impossibly more anxious the closer they get. He’s silent and fidgety. And so preoccupied that he doesn’t snap at Sam’s frequent worried glances his way.
Dean blinks, thrown by the throwback to earlier, during the case. “... recreationally,” he volleys back, amused and unconcerned. “I’ll find a way. You always find a way for throwing stars, Sammy, c’mon.”
A fresh tear rolls down Castiel’s cheek. It carves Dean open, because he already knows the answer. “Because it is.” Castiel’s voice breaks when he speaks. Every time Dean thinks he can’t be undone further, something proves him wrong.
A little later, Castiel sighs contentedly, bunching up the sandwich wrapper. Dean, who’s hand had been resting over his freshly socked foot for warmth, squeezes gently. “Better?”
Cas shuffles his feet, half covering one with the other, visibly cold. “Do you maybe also have water I can drink?”
He doesn’t have to say it. If this is really Cas… which, Sam is seriously starting to get his hopes up as well… if this
“Okay.” It’s Cas’ turn to fiddle with Dean’s shirt, eventually laying a hand flat on Dean’s stomach. Dean, cheeks hurting from all this grinning he’s being doing today, presses a quick kiss to Cas’ temple. “C’mon. Let’s go find Sam.”
Dean allows himself to get lost in the moment for a little longer, then he breaks the kiss reluctantly, nosing Cas’ cheek before he leans away. Blue eyes blink back at him, calm and happy. “It’s uh… you know. It’s just an idea. We can work out all the details. You get to chose everything you want. I just want…”
The tires crunch slowly on the gravel of Cass Road in the shifting afternoon sun, when they finally get there. Sam drives at walking speed as both brothers look around for sighs of a trap or a fallen angel. Up ahead, they can see the lone pole of a bus stop, displaying what looks like a very short timetable for a single bus route. Next to it, a decrepit, picturesque wooden bus shelter stands by the side of the road, rooted half in pebbles, half in the grass that spreads in lieu of a sidewalk. As they get nearer, Cas’ silhouette emerges from behind it, clumsily padding into view on bare feet, skinny legs poking out from under a lumpy comforter cocoon.
want to find out. To live in the uncertainty just a little longer, or maybe forever, just in case the fantasy isn’t real.
Castiel, looking just as baffled to be welcome as he was before, although much happier, stares back. “I'm just happy you're here.”
Cas tilts his head, studying Dean’s face and his proposition. “Would I see you there?” he asks, eventually.
“I heard you, you know?” Castiel smiles at him, even through the tears and the regret that is plain on his face. “I always hear you.” His eyes flick between Dean’s, suddenly frantic, desperate. “You said... You said you can't do this without Sam and I.” Dean watches his shaky exhalation, numb. “But you're going to have to. Dean. For me.”
“Great,” Dean throws him a grateful smile. He reaches over to the abandoned comforter and tucks it back around Cas’ shoulders. Then, with a playful quirk to his lips, he flops down to lie on the backseat, dragging Castiel along by the edges of the fabric. “Nap time,” he croons, before claiming a chunk of the duvet for himself.
“Son of a bitch.” Dean moves his arm so he can peer at the damage to his coat better. He flicks at a limp strip of fabric hanging from where it’s been torn at the shoulder. “Fucking rebar.”
Sam is touched to see Castiel’s eyes soften at the mention of the women. “I look forward to seeing everyone again.”
Dean gasps faintly into it, eyes fluttering shut. Instantly, he’s overwhelmed. It’s a kiss. It’s just a kiss. Chaste, at that. It’s lips against his own.
want?” He uses their joined hands to nudge his knuckles to Castiel thigh, and Sam’s eyes flick down, narrowing in suspicion. “D’you wanna keep hunting the baddies? Carry on with the Team Free Will lifestyle?” He quirks a smirk at Cas. “You wanna be Steve, again?”
Dean, eyes hard on something across the room from him, calls out to the phone. “Then, you’ll know. What's the last thing I said to you?”
“Uh, we got you some clothes,” Sam blurts out, snapping his mouth shut and chastising himself for breaking the moment, the second it’s out of his mouth.
“Maybe this, first, though.” Castiel picks up a deli sandwich. Sam vows to himself to get some better tasting food in him, soon. But this will have to do for now. Maybe a burger joint along the road if they pass one. It’s not like Dean will fight him.
Sam watches Dean stiffen. He hasn’t spoken much about what happened, but Sam can’t imagine watching one more loved one die. Especially when, like Dean had said, they sacrifice themselves to save your life.
Dean swallows. He’s not joking when he leans closer, meeting Castiel’s eyes steadily. “Every damn day, if you’ll have me.”
He walked through the valley of the shadow of deaths, alongside ghosts that waited for sleep to take him to wear the faces of family, friends, allies...
Idly, Sam tells himself to get used again to third wheeling and standing by while silent conversations are happening when his brother and Castiel lock eyes. Wiping his lips, he stands and gestures vaguely towards the bathroom when Dean throws him an inquiring look. Honestly? Sam’s surprised he even noticed.
Sam keeps his eyes on Dean, who’s letting out a shaky breath through his lips, slowly, eyes still closed, and jaw working.
Dean tilts his head faintly, swallowing thickly, and it hits Sam that Dean’s not working hard to keep a control on his grief at Cas’ loss and all the emotions that this brings. He’s trying to reign in
Sam was starting to drift off when he hears Cas speak again. “You kept your promise.” It’s quiet, clearly meant for Dean.
He moves back easily when Dean opens the car door and climbs in. By the time Sam has hopped back into the driver seat, Dean has scrambled over the front seat to snatch their bag of shopping and spread it to display various candy bars and snacks between them on the bench seat. Castiel finishes taking long pulls from a water bottle and looks down at the offerings. “Oh.” His hand falls on a pack of Twizzlers. “I love these.”
Cas folds his fingers in, their hands slot together. So simple. Chaste. Innocent, even. And yet, human society has ascribed this gesture
“Y-... Uh. Yeah.” Dean sniffs. Sam looks from him to Castiel, finds the blue-eyed man also watching Dean expectantly. “This is something you’ve brought up before and uh… I’ve been thinking. I think maybe this is a good time.”
A section of the comforter becomes dislodged from wherever it was tucked and falls away. Absolutely unconcerned, Castiel only hikes his arm higher up over Dean’s shoulder, Dean wrapping himself impossibly tighter around him in the mother of all bear hugs. Sam does a double take at Cas’ bare side and blinks away, strangely embarrassed.
The piling on and not dealing has Dean so wired that he kicks out and nearly startles out of his skin when his phone starts ringing again. This time, they look before picking up the call.
“Oh. No.” Dean lets the trunk fall shut. “I don’t know why,” Castiel muses. “Either I wasn’t connected to this world or I wasn’t an angel there.” Something sad crosses his expression. “I am definitely not one anymore, now. So, I won’t hear you, anymore.”
And Cas is asking him to do just that. To survive him. Again. To actively try not to let the next clever creature get a lucky shot, take down the great Dean Winchester. Just so he doesn’t have to stay. Just enough to be a tragic warrior’s end during a hunt, and not a suicide. So it’s a little bit not his fault, and he doesn’t have to feel so guilty for leaving Sammy.
“Immensely.” Cas’ smile tells them he doesn’t just mean the food. Dean’s face says he agrees wholeheartedly.
Sam stirs the car back onto the road, resolving to keep an eye out for gas stations and convenience stores on their way. “I’m still… not allowed to ask what happened, right?”
“I know.” Sam is ready to get lulled back into the drive but Dean surprises him back speaking again. “Thank you.”
They lean against the car while Castiel climbs in the backseat to wriggle into several much-needed layers. Next to Sam, Dean rubs his face, staring into the landscape ahead. “What the fuck,” he mutters quietly. He peeks behind them, unable to help himself from checking that this isn’t a fever dream. To be honest, Sam feels the same urge. But maybe it’s enough to see Dean look away with a beaming, baffled smile.
Dean sighs. It’s not annoyance, Sam knows. He’s learned it by now. It’s pain. It’s regret. It’s the weight of the grief Dean’s been carrying around in every stiff muscle of his posture, in every glassy eyes of his sleepless nights, in every tumbler of his attempts at oblivion. Dean swallows, licking his lips like he’s fighting a wave of nausea. “You can ask. I just... I c-...”
“We should eat something soon.” Sam’s stomach growls pointedly in agreement when they slide back into Baby.
Time feels suspended for a moment. Dean’s throat works as he awaits Cas’ answer, he strokes his thumb over Cas’, to try and convey that it’s Cas’ decision and only his, and that he shouldn’t feel pressured. It’s just an idea. A pipe dream, really. And then Dean’s breath gets lodged somewhere in his chest when Castiel smiles, starting with his eyes. “That sounds wonderful,” he replies softly, before he leans up and kisses Dean.
The hospital tile was white with streaks of gray in it. Something industrial and easy to clean up. He studied the floor like it was a new exorcism he’d yet to master.
Dean sighed. “Yeah, well, we’ll get you dance lessons or something when we get back home. If you’ve still got this bug up your ass.”
Dean got out of the car. He was wrong about the heat before, it wasn’t like an oven, with the drought it was more like an open oven in the middle of the desert in the summer.
“Cheer up, sunshine,” Dean said. Cas turned his glare on Dean. Dean’s smile widened, and he patted Cas’s shoulder. “The sooner we get this done, the sooner you can stop stretching your people skills beyond their limits.”
“Okay,” Dean said because he was none of the things he should have been. His grief would make him sloppy and get him killed soon enough anyway then Sam could rid the world of their ghosts. Dean only hoped he’d be reunited with Cas once all the ash settled.
Castiel’s feelings about the man were largely conflicting. On the one hand, Ricky had hurt Castiel, Dean, and many others while helping Kushiel and Carolynn. On the other, Ricky had also apologized with tears in his eyes before he’d stabbed Castiel with Kushiel’s blade.
Dillon flew toward him with outstretched hands. He kept repeating that the fall was Castiel’s fault. That he’d led them all to where they were now. Castiel stared him down and braced for his fate.
The haunting they were investigating took place in the high rise office building Danny’s husband Chris worked in. Dean and Sam were in the middle of interviewing Chris about the strange death of a coworker while Dean side eyed the picture of Chris, a little boy and a guy who looked
“Stop, Dean,” Castiel whispered. “Stop making me fight with you. Stop trying to run back to hell or heaven or purgatory somewhere else I can’t reach you in anymore.”
“We should call Dean and Cas,” Mary said, breaking through Sam’s thoughts. “See if we can split the list of families to interview.”
“We figured it’d be a good idea to go at the case from a couple different ways,” Sam said. “Either it was actually an angel who showed up, or it was a hoax to promote the festival and raise money.”
To Castiel’s surprise, The Roadhouse was overflowing with visitors when he arrived. The old roadside bar didn’t exactly scream romance in his opinion. A couple dressed in red and pink were getting handsy with each other just outside the door into the bar. Castiel had to pull his trench coat a little tighter to keep from brushing up against them as he made his way inside. Someone, probably Ash, had hung red and pink metallic heart garland from the ceiling throughout the bar. Tendrils brushed against the heads of couples dancing and fluttered in the breeze from the ceiling fans and air conditioning vents.
Fifteen minutes later, Sam and Mary stood in the middle of the park Sarah directed them to. The area was swarming with cops like every other crime scene Sam had visited over the years. Unlike many of the other crime scenes he’d been to, this one had a head detective who was more than happy to have agents from the FBI show up offering to help.
“The frame wouldn’t fit in the Impala,” Sam said. Dean scowled and started mentally rearranging things in the car so the framed poster would fit on the drive back to Kansas. Sam waved a hand in front of his face. “Forget the poster. Aren’t we supposed to be here getting clothes for Cas?”
“It’s worth looking into,” Dean said. “We’ve already run into a few others who didn’t follow the rules recently.”
Sam waved a hand at Dean in response before taking his place in line. Sam started up a conversation with a couple of women in front of him in line. Dean grinned.
“I’m never gonna have that,” Dean said in a soft, wrecked voice as Jessie and Kim shared their first kiss and the montage of their new happy life together started. The montage faded into a dimly lit love scene. Dean caught his reflection in the tv screen. He looked sloppy and miserable and pathetic. “Fuck my life.”
Finally, just as the contents of Dean’s stomach were threatening to sour and Dean was starting to contemplate calling Joyce up to see if he could keep his job after all, Cas’s eyes started to glisten in the low lamp light. Then the most brilliant smile spread across his face like dawn across a field.
The flutter of wings covered the sound of Dean picking up a pillow from the bed and lobbing it at Sam’s head.
“And tell them what?” Sam asked. “The FBI is here to investigate the guy pretending to be an angel in public?”
Dean shoved his fists deeper into the pockets of his jacket. His nails dug into his palms as he picked up the pace.
Sam rolled his eyes hard enough that Dean winced in sympathy for Sam’s eyeballs. “You heard from Cas today?”
Castiel huffed. If he was anyone other than an angel of the lord, Dean would have sworn Castiel had just called him an asshole under his breath.
Memories of a pair of waitresses he’d hooked up with a few years back came to mind. The skin on his neck felt hypersensitive and he remembered the sensation of their soft kisses, wet tongues, and sharp teeth as they’d given him a pair of matching hickies below his pulse points.
A throat cleared to Castiel’s right. He tore his attention from Dean just in time to catch the cup of coffee Ellen was trying to push into his hands.
“Yeah, waking nightmares and second guessing every move you made that led to whatever new terrible thing that’s happened is normal. It's human,” Dean said. “This wasn’t your fault though. And you didn’t fail.”
“By that logic,” Cas said. “A faithless man and a religious studies professor would be doomed too, would it not?”
“No,” Dean said. He cleared his throat and ignored Sam’s pitying frown. “He’s busy following a lead. He’ll call me whenever he gets a chance.”
Dean felt his face relax into a smile against his permission. Cas turned back to Dean and his curious expression turned to concern.
Castiel had never been inside a movie theater. During his brief time spent as a human he couldn’t afford the luxury of it, and as a fully powered angel in the millennia prior, the novelty was foreign to him.
Inevitably, his thoughts drifted to the case they'd just finished. It was in a little town outside of Des Moines. They'd lived in a larger suburb nearby for a few months back when Dean was in high school.
“Why?” Mary asked. “Our lead went nowhere and they have more than enough people to interview. We can cover more ground quicker if we split the load.”
Cas's smiling eyes sparked in the dim light from the old bedside lamp. The skin around his eyes folded as more of his teeth showed. Their movements were quick. Cas's feet matched Dean’s movements beat for beat. As the song came to an end, Dean pulled Cas close and dipped him. They both laughed at Cas's shock.
,” Scott said. His words dripped with venom and he made no moves to show he even noticed Dean’s gun pointed at him. “Dillon showed me how to melt down an angel blade to make bullets.” He tapped the side of his gun with his index finger without taking his eyes off Cas. “I’ve never gotten the chance to find out if they kill your kind or if they’ll just hurt like a bitch. If you don’t get your feathery ass off my property before I count to ten we’ll get to find out together.”
Soon enough they were settled under the sheets together and Cas was scrolling through their shared Netflix queue for the documentary series they were binging. They didn’t get many nights like these. Not nearly as many as Dean would like. But they happened often enough that they’d come up with this little ritual for nights when neither of them wanted to spend hours sitting in The Dean Cave.
Cas froze. His expression was careful, guarded in a way that cut straight through Dean’s heart. “I thought you didn’t like being watched in your sleep.”
Dean’s eyes lingered on Cas’s hands. They’d healed him, pulled him out of danger, even hurt him a few times. Each time they grazed his skin, they left an impact on Dean. Like a tattoo or a bruise of emotion deep in his bones. In his soul.
A gunshot rang through the air on Castiel’s right. Dillon disappeared into a wisp of blue-white light.
“Maybe,” Dean said with a tight smile. Dean finished off his coffee and forced his thoughts back to the case. “Can you tell me a little more about Dillon? What kind of person was he? Was he religious?”
“Hi there,” Sam said. Both of the college kids stared up at him with wide eyes, clutching their cups of coffee like teddy bears in the dark while staring down the monster in their closet. “I’m Agent Wolfgang with the FBI. I heard you two talking about a dead body. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about it?”
Cas met Dean’s eyes with a small smile. He looked uninjured and tired. Tension Dean didn’t know he was holding in melted from his shoulders.
He swallowed and met Cas’s neutral gaze. If the angel felt anything when he saw Dean this exposed, his expression didn’t betray it.
“This one decides she wanted to go on a pub crawl for our one year anniversary last month,” Sarah said. “I cut her off at one a.m. because I knew she’d be miserable with her hangover the next morning and I had still had a paper to write. She knows I’m not that good with directions, especially at night, but she insisted she knew where we were going. So that’s how we ended up in the same alley as a little herd of javelinas.”
He closed his eyes and grabbed a random bag off the rack of chips. Then he glanced around the store looking for his brother. He spotted Sam at the counter accepting the key to the men’s room.
Mary’s frown deepened. She opened her mouth to speak, but commotion from a couple of college kids settling down at a nearby table interrupted her.
Dean walked a little further up the street from the theater and found a quiet side street. He pulled out his phone, navigated to his favorite people in his contacts list and pressed Cas’s name. He licked his lips as he slowed his pace and put the phone up to his ear.
Cas winced as he pushed himself from the wall and crawled over to sit next to Dean. Their shoulders and legs brushed against each other when they breathed. Dean’s eyes started to burn as he turned to face Cas. Once Cas was settled he closed his eyes tight and breathed out slow. His hand went to his left side just below his ribs where their captors had sucker punched him the day before.
From then, the mantra came with humid, heavy air that hung between them as they spoke. Air heavy with potential and nerves.
Sam said something before Dean could. As far as Sam was concerned, Danny was just the guy Dean was friends with who drove the three of them to the local arcade when they lived in Iowa. Chris figured out the nature of Dean and Danny’s past relationship pretty quickly, but he didn’t say anything around Sam. Something Dean thanked him for when Sam sensed the tension and excused himself from the room.
“I hope so,” Cas said. He glared at the list of names in his hand. “Talking to people is exhausting.”
They'd had an argument about whether Cas should accept and consume whatever the people they were interviewing offered. Dean explained it was polite to do so and that taking care of others helped some people grieve. Cas still wasn't a fan of needlessly eating food, as he repeatedly bitched at Dean about between interviews, but he had a soft spot for coffee. A soft spot he seemed to enjoy indulging now that he had permission to do so.
One particular lock of Castiel’s hair stood up like a strange corkscrew spire at an angle from his head. Dean reached across the chasm before he realized he was going to do it and ran his fingers through Castiel’s hair in an attempt at taming the wild lock of hair.
“Come in,” Scott said. “Can I get you guys something to drink? I think the coffee I made this morning is still fresh enough.”
“Clicking is important to you now?” Castiel asked. “I seem to remember a tall tale or two about your Valentine’s Day adventures. It didn’t sound like there was a lot of clicking going on then.”
When Dean first caught sight of Cas standing there in front of him whole and gloriously alive once more it felt like the universe ground to a halt around them. There was no sound save for Dean’s heartbeat in his ears. For the first time that he could remember it didn’t matter to him who else was in the room with them all he saw was Cas.
a bad kiss could be when it was with the right person. When it was Cas he was kissing and not someone whose name Dean didn’t know.
Dean stared up at the ceiling until his eyes burned with the need to blink. Every time he closed his eyes he saw Castiel dying in front of him all over again. Dean’s throat felt knotted with helplessness and emotion.
In the span of a heartbeat, Castiel morphed from an unmoving mass of angel to a human trying to burrow his face into Dean’s collarbone as his wild limbs wrapped around Dean’s body like a limpet.
“That’s not what I meant,” Cas said. “Dancing with Ricky wasn’t fun. I don’t understand why humans do it so often.”
The worst dreams were the ones where his hands ended up soaked in blood. Sometimes they shook with adrenaline and shame. Other times, the worst times, they were steady. Like there was something in him that was confident and empowered by the obvious destruction.
you’re right, why would dad want this? A list of people that Free Will has been paid to kill? Why would he care?”
Dean scowls through the first ten minutes of their drive, Cas trying and failing to hide the amused smile on his face.
Charlie and Jack had simply shrugged and Cas had said, “Anywhere but Illinois,” and then refused to elaborate any more. Sam had abandoned that discussion with a huff, which means they’ve been playing Musical Motel Rooms in every city they stop in.
Castiel looks exasperated. “There are real FBI agents in the building now. This is the only way out of the building without being seen.”
A black man with a thunderous look on his face strides over to them. “What the hell are you doing here? This is
“Is that him?” he asks dubiously, shoving his hands deeper into his coat pockets. “He looks like a teenager.”
Castiel frowns. “Maybe he didn’t know how to tell you,” Cas offers. “Or maybe he was protecting you. I’ve heard fathers do that sometimes.”
Cas leans in and presses a lingering kiss to Dean’s cheek. “I’m going to make sure none of the pots on the stove boil over. I’ve heard it’s a very important job.”
“Cas, not you too,” Sam moans. He shoots a glare at Dean, like it's his fault the guy has a sense of humor.
Dean makes a face. “Oh, come on. You think I liked those shitty motel rooms we were always stuck in? I still have PTSD from that place that had the bed bugs.”
She’s smiling brightly at them both, a laptop covered with colorful stickers parked in front of her. She has a bright purple shirt on that proclaims her a
Dean takes pleasure in watching Baldy’s mouth go slack and the blood drain from the faces of his two lackeys.
“Can’t believe my dad never told us,” Dean groans, after he knocks it back. It burns warm in his chest. “What an asshole.”
Dean’s face shifts into a stubborn glare and he hunches down in his seat, tapping out a message to Charlie. “I don’t need glasses,” he mumbles. “
“Dean,” Cas interrupts, before Dean can think of a good enough retort. “Don’t cook. We should go out and celebrate. Let's go to lunch."
He sweeps forward and catches the guard’s hand as he brings the gun up, forcing it up towards the ceiling. Dean ushers Jack ahead of him, back toward the staff entrance. “Go, go—”
“I got it,” Jack says. The safe door is hanging open behind him and Jack is holding a brown ledger aloft. It looks old and beat up. Dean feels a wave of relief rush through him. They did it. They actually—
It’s cold and miserable in Michigan. Sludgy gray snow is piled up on the sides of the road and everyone is bustling around with their heads down, trying to brave the cold just long enough to get where they need to go.
“Well,” Bobby interrupts, clapping his hands on his thighs. “I hate to break this party up, but I've got a plane to catch. You boys did a good thing today. I'm proud of you.”
. Other people ignore Dean's calls, but Dean always answers. When's the last time he ignored a call from his dad?
Suddenly the card reader beeps and the door swings open. Dean jumps about a mile and grabs the mop like a weapon, but it’s just Castiel—hair windswept and face looking more aggravated than normal. “We need to leave,” he says.
“Hey, Dad, it’s me,” Dean says, from the other side of the room. He sounds tired and more than a little annoyed. Sam tries not to listen in. “We got your ledger. If you even still want it. Call me back, I guess.”
Dean backs up and the guard takes a threatening step toward him. “How’d you get in here without your card?”
“Let me get this straight,” Charlie says, massaging her temples. “Are we really going to break into a high-tech security company for a list of names that’s worth exactly
“Dean, it’s me,” his dad barks. Fuck, even the sound of his voice makes Dean stand up straighter. He thought he was over that. “Sit tight. You got that? Do
Now that she knows where to look, it’s easy to find what she needs. And with just a few more clicks, she’ll be—
Dean doesn’t remember how he gets back to the hotel, but he knows he must have because he’s sprawled face down on his bed. He doesn’t remember settling the tab, or how many drinks they ended up tossing back; he doesn’t even know where Cas ended up sleeping. When Dean wakes up in the morning, he only knows three things: he has a throbbing headache, a horrific taste in his mouth, and Bobby Singer is yelling at him.
Bobby hasn’t played the part of scowly FBI agent in a long time, but it’s like riding a bike. He’s glaring at everyone as he strides up to the front of the building, Sam and Cas not far behind him. Bobby’s done the intimidation act on his own, but there’s something to be said for having two guys as backup. Especially a guy as strong as Castiel and a guy as tall as Sam. They’re all in bright blue FBI windbreakers and it draws eyes to them like magnets. Bobby can hear the whispers start flying before they’re even in the building.
“They stole something from Azazel?” Sam asks. His whole face is contorted—like he doesn’t know whether to cry or shout.
“Here,” Jack says. Dean turns to find him caressing a small black wall safe. There’s a keypad on it.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean swears. It’s time to go, but he doesn’t want to leave without the ledger. Not when they’re so close. “Jack: your five minutes just turned into
When he gets out to the war room, Cas is already waiting on him. He’s in a flannel and jeans, but he has the trench coat on too. It's the first time he’s worn it since they dragged him back from the Empty, bruised and human. The first time Dean’s seen it since that terrible night in the dungeon when Cas had looked at him like that and said,
Charlie’s fingers start tapping away at her keyboard and Sam flips to a blank page in his legal pad. Dean leans forward to pluck a chocolate croissant from the bag of pastries. All in a day’s work.
“We should get back,” Cas eventually sighs, sliding his phone into his pocket. He looks at Dean expectantly.
“You ask me, they should have done it a long time ago.”  He gestures to the elevator as it dings. “Well. Duty calls.”
Cas had been stuck at the stove, stirring each pot periodically to make sure nothing boiled over. It was mind-numbing. Cranberry sauce. Gravy. Caramel sauce. Green beans. Cranberry sauce. Gravy. Caramel sauce. Green beans. Cranberry sauce—
By the time the elevator reaches the top floor, she’s the only one in it. A secretary gestures at the black leather armchairs lining the walls, barely looking up. “Please take a seat. Mr. Shurley will be with you in a moment.”
thing to do when you’re losing a fight), but then a shaft of moonlight must hit Dean’s face just the right way. Abruptly, Sam stops squirming.
“Thanks,” Dean says. Most of the time he’s almost afraid to look at Cas, but today his eyes are drawn to him helplessly. He’s in sweats and an old band t-shirt of Dean’s because he sleeps now. There’s still the ghost of a bruise on his cheek because he can’t heal anymore. “And thanks for the coffee, Cas.”
Castiel abruptly releases Dean’s foot, breaking their eye contact. Dean sits back in his chair, breathing heavily. “Sorry,” he grits out, refusing to meet anyone’s eyes. He’s fine. Or he
The way he says it, wryly—like it’s something he’s never experienced—makes Dean huff out a humorless laugh. “Maybe. Doesn’t sound like my dad.”
Cas blinks at him, startled. Like he didn't think he was allowed to join. They'll have to work on that. Hesitantly, he stands and wraps an arm around Charlie, but Dean grabs him by the tie and hauls him in, until they're all part of the big, messy group hug.
Dean is glaring at the table, looking like he’d rather get a root canal than have this conversation. At least
Cas managed a silent takedown in the amount of time it takes Dean to decide on which drink he wants to order at a bar. If Dean hadn’t seen him in action before—brutal and efficient—he wouldn’t believe it.
The guard sneers at him and digs a hand into his pocket, pulling out the USB drive. Baldy takes a step off the wall where he’d been leaning.
All Dean wants to do is slip into the warm embrace of the coffee shop. Instead, he tries to peer through the window without looking too obvious about it, stamping his feet on the ground to try and warm up his legs.
Cas and Sam are talking quietly about something at the table, though they stop immediately when Dean comes into the kitchen.
Dean sighs and leans against the building to wait. There’s a security camera trained right on the door, but Dean isn’t worried. If Charlie did her job right, that camera will just be showing looped footage for the next 5 minutes. And Charlie always does her job right. The person Dean’s worried about is Cas. This next part all depends on him.
Dean’s pretty sure it’s because they don’t have a home base. Crews aren’t meant to constantly be on the road. One of the perks of having a crew is having someplace to settle; a safehouse they can stay at when there’s no job to work. But that turned out to be just another thing they couldn’t agree on—not because everyone had strong opinions about where they should set up their base, but because no one did.
Charlie’s grinning up at them, oblivious to Dean’s inner turmoil. “Hey guys! This is Castiel. He’s the Hitter who’s helping us out. Castiel, this is Sam and Dean.”
an art. Dean can read his marks like a well-loved paperback. Can tell exactly what they want; what they need to hear. Can turn a conversation into an argument, make that argument into a seduction, finagle things so they always come out in his favor. Half the time his marks just give him whatever he’s looking for. It’s the one thing Dean’s good at.
He eyes Dean out of the corner of his eye as he sits, staring at his phone until the buzzing stops and the screen goes black.
“So?” Dean snaps. “It’s not like we tell each other everything. You’re allowed to have a private life, dude.”
By the time they pull into the garage, Dean has waffled back and forth so many times that he’s lost track of the argument he was having with himself. He just wants.
is the one who slips inside and shuts the door firmly behind him. He’s halfway through a relieved sigh when he looks around and sees Cas standing next to the filing cabinet.
happened to drive Dad underground.” He pulls out the napkin and slaps it down on the table in front of Sam. “He asked me to get this ledger. I can’t just leave him hanging.”
Ellen raises an eyebrow. “Well, I can’t speak to family. But looks to me like you got a crew right here.”
“Of course they can,” Cas says. “Your soul wants everything you want. And it wants everything you pretend not to."
The thought has barely crossed his mind before the door opens. Cas winces, but it isn’t Dean in the doorway.
“I was hired to,” Dean tells him, trying to ignore the throbbing in his jaw. He has to play this part juuuuust right…
Dean plucks the napkin out of Sam’s hands, rereading the instructions even though he has them memorized already. “I don’t have another option. It’s not like you’re offering to help.”
to get him back. Not just because some dickhead writer decided it would make the most interesting storyline.
“Maybe I figured you wouldn’t answer the door.” Dean lets his voice turn sharp with bitterness. “I wasn’t calling just to call, Sam. I need your help.”
“Dean, wait—” Cas interrupts, eyes widening in understanding. He looks behind him into the bunker, like he’s looking for a way out
“We’re a team,” Dean cuts in firmly, before the tensions get too high. Some things never change, and apparently being the peacekeeper is one of them. “And we should probably go inside.”
. I've been trying to tell Cas how I feel all day, and right as I get up the fucking courage, all of you clowns interrupt. So just. Shut up for a second while I tell Cas how much I love him."
Dean stares down at the phone in his hands before his face screws up in anger and he curls over, pressing his palms into his eyes—pressing so hard it hurts.
Charlie is hiding behind her computer screen, and Jack’s face is frozen in smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. It’s not hard to see why. Cas has this pinched look on his face, eyes narrowed as he snipes at Sam. And even though Dean can’t see Sam’s face, it’s clear from the set of his shoulders that he’s bitching right back. Kevin is looking like he regrets everything that’s led him to this moment. Another moment and they might spook away a job, and a kid who seems to genuinely need their help.
Cas hand tightens and pulls, yanking Dean into his grip and then off the roof with him in the next step.
Dean’s not as nice as Sam, so he doesn’t bend down to pick it up. “You need to watch where you’re going,” Dean says instead, already squeezing past him to catch up with Sam. Sam looks like he has thoughts about Dean’s people skills, but Dean ignores him—taking the chance to speed ahead of him on the sidewalk and leave Sam scrambling to catch up.
“What? You can’t expect a girl to learn about an offshore account and not drain it! I didn’t want them to use the money to hire a fancy-schmancy lawyer like Sam and get out of the charges. I was going to wire you guys the money to thank you for helping out.”
“You think we can leave yet?” Dean sighs, when he’s finished with his text. “This place is giving me the heebie jeebies.”
“You deserve to be happy too,” Dean tells him, the words tumbling out without his permission. “I want you to be happy.”
"So," he says awkwardly when Cas just continues to stare at him like he hung the moon. "How'd I do? I know it wasn't as eloquent as your big speech, but--"
Charlie and Jack exchange an uncomfortable look. Dean frowns at Sam. He’s been doing this more and more often lately. Sending these barbed remarks Cas’ way, like he’s expecting Cas to say:
Charlie chews on her lip. “Your dad was really interested in finding a list of their customers. Frank told him they didn’t keep records of that stuff online, and your dad said he would go in and get it himself. That was the last email between them.”
still the same after all these years. “You don’t owe me for that, Sam. I did all that because you’re my family. Because that’s what family
Sam’s still flipping through the pages. Some are yellowed with age. “This is nothing. Just a list of names and nonsense notes. Listen to this: 9/8/1970. Lola Parker. HP TX GSW 215. What the hell does that mean?”
Charlie leads their motley troop through a side door so they don’t attract any attention from the overnight receptionist. Charlie and Dean’s room is some kind of suite and is definitely several huge steps up from what they got used to as kids. There’s a couch and a coffee table right past the doorway, and a little kitchen area with a Keurig. Two pillow-soft beds call invitingly from the middle of the room and the bathroom is all soft towels and creamy tile and—Sam blinks. “Is that a jacuzzi?”
