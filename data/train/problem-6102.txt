“Not a problem. I’ll be in contact soon, Captain.”
“Sir, if I may interject, you were not fine, as you put it.”
“Well, I’m currently working on a project for SHIELD that allows the heart to slow down to one beat per minute. I think I’m pretty sure that I’m close to cracking it.” Bruce explained, putting his mug down on the table.
“What about their names? How did you come up with them?”
“Why on earth? You know what, don’t even tell me. I don’t want to know. The less I know the better.” Rhodey let out a sigh as he looked over at his best friend. “Let's get you home.”
“You are a pain in the butt, Tony.” Bruce walked over to the omega, sitting on the bed and passed over the glass.
“But I’ve been out of the pack house for so long. I don’t want him to be angry with me.”
“Hey Bruce, what are you doing tomorrow? I need more outfits and I still have my bank account linked to my, uh, previous job.” He asked, slipping on his watch and glasses.
The omega flung his jacket onto the floor without care. His trousers and dress shirt got the same treatment as soon as he managed to get out of them, having fought with the buttons.
“And that you’d get away with it,” Bucky added, trying his best to keep Clint and Thor away from the cake.
Tony sniffed, taking in the scent of an alpha as he looked up at the male. He had jet black hair and dark brown eyes that were hazy from alcohol, a predatory grin spread across his face.
“Oh, he will. Steve will never stop until he finds me. That man is as ever stubborn as you are a massive prick.”
“I will be okay Steve.” Tony smiled, picking up the glass of orange juice and taking a sip.
The two got comfy in bed, Steve turning on the tv and putting Brooklyn 99 on for them to watch. Tony was pressed up to Steve and that’s all that mattered right now. Tony was back where he belonged, safe with his pack.
“Eh, one, one and a half. I’m okay. Thank you Pep. For everything.” Tony hugged the redhead, so thankful that he had her in his life.
“What’s wrong?” Pepper furrowed her brows, hurrying over to Tony.
“Tony?” Fire jumped down from the bed, going over to the omega. “You okay?”
Steve didn’t respond, just started running towards the doors. Stephan Strange gave a look to Bruce, an eyebrow raising at the delta.
“I’m fine.” Tony put the tray on the empty spot beside him. “Except for the fact I need to pee now.”
“That applies to you too, blondie.”
“This is a ten!”
Tony hadn’t been running off to SHIELD as much as of late, but he had been getting up at all sorts of hours and not going bed until late as he was working on projects. Steve was less worried about Tony when he was at home, but he was still concerned with how little the brunette slept, ate and even went outside. If it wasn’t for the pack, Tony would only be running on coffee and energy drinks. Everyone would try to convince him to go to bed, sometimes he would go more willingly than others. Other times Thor or Steve would have to carry him up and into bed, where he would fall asleep almost straight away once his head hit the pillows. Loki also played his part occasionally, putting Tony into a sleep state, as much as the alpha hated it.
“Tony, I know Howard wasn’t the best parent ever. But he loved and cared for you a lot. I just don’t think he knew how to express it.” Pepper sighed, her hand gently squeezing the male’s own.
Tony had started to sober up through the movie, the pizza probably helped too, but he wasn’t completely clear. Tammi and Brooke left after the movie had finished, Pepper not long after them. Tony was still sat in between Rhodey and Tyler, looking for something to watch.
Fur colour: Black (solid)
“And what exactly would you be negotiating?” Tony ignored the beverage and walked over to the table.
“You have nothing to be sorry for.”
wanted to. He had learnt that he had shifted at a young age, very young. Most shifter children had their first shift averaging from the age of four to six. After they shifted, their rank status would be determined as they would give off their first scent. Tony first shifted aged only two. His father had left him for no longer than a minute, gone to get his son some juice from his wife who was preparing dinner in the kitchen and had returned to a small brown wolf pup sitting in his son’s place, his tail wagging. It was then that Tony was recognised as an omega and probably when his father started to resent him.
“Definitely no pressure. It will be fun. They'll probably just embarrass me, but I tend to do that on my own anyway.” Tony laid down beside Steve once more. “I want my best friends to get along with you Steve.”
Opening the door to the room he gently led the omega inside, a hand on the small of his back. The room was simple, almost empty as it was barely used. Steve let Tony go over to the bed on his own before looking back out the door.
(Pretend its green because I was never going to find that)
Anywho, thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy the chapter! I'm getting close to finishing the first book now and I really want to write the final chapter and start on the second one.
“Why were you in there?”
The pair went down to the labs and got set up, working hard on Bruce’s project, only stopping once to have a late lunch after Agent Coulson had stopped by to remind them and to check their progress. Tony had given that time to give the Agent back his guest card and informed him he’d look over his contracts tonight. The wolves worked late once again, not nearly as late as the night before and managed to finish the project, much to the scientist’s delight. It was another project he didn’t have to worry about and would get The Director off his back.
“Thor made lasagne today? I’m surprised Clint didn’t finish it off.” Bruce joked, looking down at the homemade Italian dish before looking at Steve once again.
Steve pulled back from Tony as his phone began to ring. Tony gave the blonde a confused look, to which Steve shrugged as he took out her phone.
“What about territory checks? Looking after the new members? All that other alpha-y stuff?” tony tilted his head to the side before taking a bite out of the toast.
“I understand, I can be gone for some time whilst lost in a project. Until the pack manages to reel me back to reality.” The scientist admitted, stepping inside and looking around the room before landing on the omega.
Tony only nodded in reply, waving as the alpha walked off before going to find Bucky. The beta was looking around, stopping and waving once he spotted Tony. The omega walked over to him, smiling up at the wolf.
“Sure. I believe I’m free tonight.” Tony began, shrugging, taking out his phone. “What’s your number?”
“If you want to you can, but if you’d rather sleep that’s okay.” Tony folded up the shirt before putting it in the draw.
“Wow!” Peter ran inside, looking around.
The blonde turned to face the omega who was confused, looking at the boy.
The group left Tony’s room, Clint claiming to know his way to the restaurant and talking about how it was split into two parts, aside for eating and another that’s a bar. The restaurant closes an hour and a half after the bar side opens and makes sure no underage people can get through. Clint continued to waffle on about the place as he guided the group out of the building and down the street. After walking up five different streets, Clint stopped, eyebrows furrowed.
“If you need anything else, don’t be afraid to ask.”
Steve thought to himself.
“You’ve seen the other two over there, right?” Fire continued, pointing over to the female and male in the rooms opposite across the hall. Tony nodded in response, sitting on the bed again. “Well, they’re human. Yes. Human. Siblings too. They’ve been here for three years. Kidnapped from their home in Europe after their parents died and shipped out here undetected.”
The alpha gave a confused look at the delta and before he could respond, Bruce had made his way upstairs and to his room and began getting things for his shower. The delta grabbed a towel and a change of clothes from his room before making his way over to the bathroom on the floor.
“What makes you think that?” Tony asked, eyebrow-raising.
“Not for the first time.” Tony sighed. “I can’t stand his attitude.”
“Okay.” Steve nodded.
“Anytime, sir.”
“Oh, so you finally admit that running across the pitch in a cheerleading outfit and pompoms was a regret.” Rhodey began to laugh.
Steve ran forward into the middle of the clearing before turning to face the omega. The alpha bowed down to Tony, butt up and wiggling to suggest friendly play, his tail wagging along with it. The brunette couldn’t help but let out a laugh at Steve’s behaviour as he ran over to where the alpha was still bowing. Tony stopped fright in front of the golden wolf, bowing down with his butt in the air to copy Steve. Tony’s tail wagged happily, Steve’s wagging even faster at the omega’s happiness.
“I’m sorry you had to leave.”
“You okay?”
“Yeah. Especially when you’re at home. You’re safe there. You should be able to be alone, to make a drink yourself and such.” Steve stood straight again. “But you leaving the house alone still worries me. As my mate, you are at risk of being attacked and kidnapped, and it’s happened once before. I can’t let it happen again, Tony.”
“I want to do something.” Steve bit his lip. “Can I take you to lunch at least? It can be like a date.”
“Let’s get you back to Steve, he’s probably been going crazy.” Bucky gave a nod to the door.
“I’ll have the spaghetti bolognese and a water please.” The blonde smiled up at her. She nodded as she wrote it down.
“I’m surprised you didn’t figure out sooner, the number of times Rhodey and Pepper have dropped the SI name. But yes, Howard Stark was my dad and alpha, then he died so his second took his place. I’m a Stark and there’s a reason I didn’t tell you. I know that name doesn’t have the best reputation.”
“Do you want me to go get him?” Bucky sighed, nodding to the door. “He needs to come and choose.”
“You’re right.” Steve let out a sigh and walked over carefully. “I don’t know why but I just feel that I need to watch you constantly. I need to make sure you’re okay.”
“The pizzas are great too. All freshly made, sauce included.” Rhodey added.
“Alright.” Steve nodded, looking up at Thor as Loki and Natasha ran down the right hall and Bucky and Bruce went down the left.
, looking for him and as much as he wanted to stay in the woods with the golden wolf, he knew he couldn’t. Not with another wolf and potentially more in search for this one. So, with the alpha howling and his back turned, he ran, ignoring the pain as he did.
Tyler continued to laugh, Tony joining in too, making other people in the bar look over at them in confusion. The two had tears in their eyes as they laughed at Tony’s story. Both just managed to calm down before laughing all over again, the alpha almost falling off the barstool. The omegas eyes stung, and his stomach ached, but he was having such a good time with his new friend.
“Who knew Tony knew every lyric to Britney Spears’ Toxic.” Rhodey laughed as he finished the story.
“You’re not fucked in the head.” Steve frowned before licking his ice cream.
Pepper wasn’t sure how much time had passed, she could hear a clock ticking away but it was behind her. Her hand continued to run through the brunette’s hair, knowing that it soothed him. Pepper waited until her friend was comfortable to talk about what happened, if at all this time. Tony had always talked about it in the past, but it didn’t mean he would this time. Eventually, the male spoke in almost a whisper.
The omega let out a whine as Bruce continued to laugh at him. He got so wound up he couldn’t even tie his tie and ended up throwing it on the floor.
“I’ll tell you the story,” Rhodey replied, Tony, letting out a groan and banging his head on the table. “When we were younger, Tones, Pep and I would play games. Tony was nine at the time, Pepper was six and I was eleven. We were playing hide and seek in Stark Industries; our packs were having a meeting and we were bored. We had to stay on the wing we were in, no leaving it or going onto other floors but there was still loads of places to hide. I was the seeker this time around and I had already found Pepper in a storage closet. So, I continued to look for Tony and I couldn’t find him anywhere, unknown to me that he was in the toilets that I had already checked once.” Rhodey looked over at the male omega who had the napkin over his head to hide.
“Tony you are not a desperate whore. Stane is a massive asshole.” Pepper replied. “You didn’t sleep with him.”
Once again that night, Steve’s cheeks reddened, resisting to run a hand through the omega’s locks. “You’re welcome, Tony.”
“Puny omega.” Hulk’s large tongue came out and licked across Tony’s face, the brown wolf managed to stay in place and accept the large wolf’s gesture. “Friend.”
The pair had briefly talked earlier about packs. Bruce explained that he only worked for SHIELD, his pack lived just outside of the city and he came in most days to work on his projects for them. He had learnt that Tony had just arrived last night and was considering working for SHIELD, he just wanted more information on them. Bruce knew there was more to it and noticed Tony hadn’t mentioned anything about a pack but didn’t pressure him to do so. It was quite a possibility that Tony was the omega that Clint and Natasha had been sent to rescue that night, but he knew it was too much of a personal question to ask. A lot of the time omegas were sedated to protect themselves and the agents that were sent to collect them. Some could get frightened and could lash out and some others went into massive panic attacks.
“And the bots.”
“Okay, that makes sense.” Tony bit his lip, turning off the bath and putting away the bubble bath. “Thanks, J.”
“I do have a thing for hot blondes,” Tony muttered, glancing over at Steve.
“You’re a smart one, huh?” Steve retorted, looking towards the stairway upstairs. The house upstairs had been ransacked and the village was ruined. The delta pup would be able to piece things together.
Tony shook his head and whispered back “your eyes.”
Tony shoved his hands in his pockets as he walked down the street that was lit up with street lights. The omega continued to walk, just glad he could do anything rather than sit in his room, bored and alone. He began to hum to himself, kicking a stone as a car drove past. He had no idea where he was going and prayed that he wouldn’t get lost as he didn’t bring his phone or JARVIS with him. The brunette walked for around for half an hour, coming to the edge of the city where a large forest stood. It was almost like it was calling him. The omega looked both ways before crossing the street once seeing it was clear. He bit his lip, walking into the woods just enough so he would be out of sight from anyone in the city. The omega stripped down and hid his clothes under some branches, shivering at the cold air whipping around him before shifting into his wolf form, thankful for his fur. It was predominately brown like his human hair but had bits of black tips across his back and his underbelly and muzzle were white.
The four wolves spent the day shopping in the city. Tony bought a range of clothes, shoes and accessories for himself and treated his new friends too. The group had stopped for lunch at a sub shop halfway through. Natasha and Clint were really nice to him considering they had only just met. Tony was glad that he got to meet new people and felt comfortable around them both already. Natasha was intimidating at times, but he knew deep down somewhere that she cared. Clint was a laugh, they both had a great time teasing Bruce. They had decided to go back to Tony’s place, Clint had been complaining about shopping for the past hour and the omega thought the poor delta deserved a break, along with the other two.
Tony moves in!
I originally wasn't going to have them be able to talk to one another in their wolf forms, but it would be a pretty weird and boring chapter and I wasn't too sure how to write it as I wanted them to go out shifted. So basically decided that non-wolves can't understand them, as they would be speaking in their wolf language (barking, whimpering, growling, and howling) and that's all that person would hear. Obviously, The Avengers Pack have two felines in their midst, but they have learnt to understand one another over the course of being together. Tony won't be able to understand Thor and Loki when they're shifted. Well, not yet anyway. The whole pack being shifted together is coming soon, including Bruce.
“At least he’s not setting them off in the house!”
“They were pretty sad they couldn’t spend my birthday with me.”
“You’ll be the best thing to happen.”
“He told you?” Pepper was shocked. “I know he refused to talk about that day.”
“Please let me go.”
"Neither of you can shift properly?" Tony's eyebrows furrowed. "But every other time the humans were always able to shift without a problem. Well, at least straight away. Is it just because of the pain or you just can't seem to hold it?"
“What’s it like? You know, being in charge of a pack, having to make the calls, being all big and strong… having shifters respect you.” A pause. “I’ve always wanted to know… Just to see how different my life could have been if I was the alpha my father wanted.”
2. Spider-Man.
Enjoy and thank you again!
“I want to join too.” Thor grinned before looking at Loki. “Brother?”
Reasoning: She just had to be an alpha, no other ways about it. At first, she wasn’t going to be a wolf. I debated for so long on what else she could be. I thought about different big cats and those in the Canidae family but didn’t settle on any others, so she ended up being a wolf too. I knew I wanted her to have somewhat brownish fur, and I liked this picture of a wolf.
“Okay, I brought his lab coat home. He’s been wearing it all day. This better not backfire.” Bruce said, nervously looking at the white piece of clothing.
“His brother is called Thor too.” This caused Fire to laugh, even more, Tony laughing along with her. He was glad he met Fire. She could make him laugh and eased the tension of being in a really bad situation.
“You okay?” The alpha asked.
“Great news.” Tony grinned, getting into the car along with Bruce. “Thanks for being my accomplice.”
“Shut it and take it like a good omega.”  The alpha stepped closer to Tony and both held their stance, the omega daring the dark-haired male to make another move.
“Most of my pack smokes, I don’t. I always bring spares in case someone forgets.” The alpha spoke as Tony lit up his cigarette and took a drag. She had bleach blonde hair and forest green eyes that were welcoming, her red lips curving up into a smile.
“Great,” Tony muttered, getting up from the bed to walk over to the glass.
“You’re an angel.” Tony smiled, waving goodbye as he left to join Natasha and Clint. “Want a drag?” He offered, looking between the pair.
“Ooo, does Tasha want to go dancing?” Clint grinned playfully, putting down the redhead’s drink in front of her before sitting down.
“Thor said he’s delighted. He can’t wait for it.”
Fur colour: White with grey tips along her back
“Sir, I have found reports on SHIELD in the specific area you asked. Would you like me to send them to you?” The mysterious voice said, leaving the delta very confused and the omega with a panicked face.
“Hello.” Steve crouched down, hoping to get the delta pup to look at him. “I’m Steve and I’m here to help.” Steve bit his lip. He hadn’t been around kids much. “What’s your name?”
“We were wondering when you were going to wake up,” Natasha said.
“Did you even know who was playing?” Rhodey replied with a smirk.
Steve let out a sigh, resting his head on Tony’s shoulder. “I didn’t even know that was possible, but it makes sense. All I want is for you all to be safe.”
The boy lifted his head, he had curious brown eyes that reminded the alpha of Tony. The pup looked Steve over before sniffing. “Not allowed to speak to strangers.”
are still wearing by the way, and cuddled you all night.” Tony may have not told her about the two of them exchanging numbers too, but what she didn’t know wouldn’t kill her.
“Loki is a special one.”
“Hey, Tony.” The man had that sickening smile on his face. For once in his life, Tony honestly didn’t know how to reply. “What? No sarcastic comeback?”
“I’m back.” Tony sing-songed as he flicked the lights on, holograms of his project appearing. “Thank you, JARVIS.”
“Are you drunk?” Natasha asked.
“On vacation. What do you think?”
Okay, so shorter chapter this time but it's lighthearted, especially after that deleted Endgame footage came out today. Man my heart. I didn't think I could cry at anything else to do with that movie.
“It’s what people call me.” Fire grinned. “I hate my name and I’ve been called Fire since I was a toddler. Stubborn, destructive and I have red hair.” She grinned.
“Steve Rogers?” An unfamiliar voice spoke down the line. “I know where Tony Stark is.”
“I’m happy to go out.” The omega smiled with a nod.
//The omega went around, trying to get anyone to give him a cigarette. He was unsuccessful, cursing at himself for not bringing any with him as he made his way back inside to find Bruce. Just as he was about to cross the dance floor to get to his table, the brunette frowned upon feeling hands on his waist, holding him still.
Tony sniffed around, trying to catch any sort of scent, an unknown alpha and beta had been here around 28 hours ago, but nothing more recently. Which most likely meant that this wasn’t a pack’s territory, so the omega had one less thing to worry about. But there would still be a possibility of wanders. The wolf wasn’t worried about finding the pack that had left him behind. In a way he was grateful to get away from it, for years he had tried to plan his escape, but he never knew how or had the guts to do it. He didn’t have anyone else. His childhood friend, Rhodey, was in another pack that was constantly on the move, protecting shifters that had made homes in towns and cities and going across to other lands to keep the peace between the different shifter types and humans. Pepper, an omega like him, was in his pack in the past and they were best friends; inseparable. She was the only one who wouldn’t take Tony’s shit. As soon as Howard died, she left. Stane had always said he hadn’t done anything to her, but he never believed him. Pepper would never have left him behind without warning. He knew that just like him, she hated the pack and was only kept around as Howard’s assistant once she reached maturity instead of being left like most omegas, but the two of them always stuck together.
“Tony.” The blonde sighed.
“See, Tony wins. Can you leave Steve and be with me instead?” Steve knew that Clint was teasing, but it didn’t stop the jealous growl escaping past his lips. “Calm down alpha, it was a joke.” Clint mouthed to Tony ‘I wasn’t joking’ before sending a wink, Tony laughing and returning it as Steve let out another growl. “We’re joking!” Clint assured, Tony nodding as he didn’t want the delta to be in trouble.
“One. Experiments sometimes don’t work. They backfire. Hence them being experiments. Two. This is why. You worry too much, you got to learn to relax.” The omega smiled at Steve as if getting blown up was nothing.
“Cap you need to get here, now,” Natasha spoke down the comms, which worried Steve.
“Your father was the CEO of Stark Industries? You’re a Stark?”
“You don’t have to come down today if you don’t want to. You’ll have to get your energy back.”
Bruce only nodded in response before following where his alpha had just run off, hoping that he would catch up to him soon.
Tony walked through the dark forest, frightened and alone. He had recently been abandoned from his pack. After his father died a little over two years ago, the rest of the pack had pushed him to the side unless they needed him for their “activities”. He shuddered at the memory, ears nearly flat on his head and tail between his legs. It had been some time since he had been in his wolf form. His pack lived in the city across the country and would mainly use cars to travel around on business. A lot of the time Tony wouldn’t be allowed to accompany them, as he was an omega, a disappointment for the Stark Pack.
“You know I don’t drink, Tony.”
“I think you mean genius.” Tony sipped from his mug, turning to the door when it opened.
“Oh, where are we going?” Tony smiled.
"We cannot shift."
“Hey, I’m here now and I’m fine. We’re all fine.” The brunette shuffled closer to the blonde, cuddling into his side. “I’m not really tired, want to watch some TV?”
“No! I just, I don’t want you to freak out. But I believe you deserve to know. I don’t think it’s very fair for me not to tell you this, and it’s been killing me for a while because I want to tell you, but I am so nervous to tell you. You don’t have to say it back if it’s too soon, even though some people do because they feel bad. I really don’t want you to do that if you don’t feel the same, don’t take pity on me, please. Be honest. I know you care about me but I-”
“Clint. You need to stay where you are. Or else I won’t be able to get you.”
“Pregnant. Anyway, as I was saying. While he seemed nervous, it didn’t seem like he would run anyway.” The doctor looked at Steve. “Steve? Steve, are you okay?”
“Look who’s being gross now.”
“You did this for me?” Steve asked once he pulled away.
“You think any of the other ‘engineers’ around here would be able to do that? So, it only comes back to you and you don’t have any other metal pieces flying at your ass.”
So, when Clint told him that they were going to SHIELD this morning to drop off the mission report, Steve was eager to join them. Yes, seeing Peggy again was nice, they had been friends for a long time and it was good to catch up with her. But Steve was on another mission right now. He was going to try to find that omega.
Tony goes on an adventure and comes across someone interesting.
Fire.
“I’m serious. And no fighting at the table either.” He looked between the three before looking down at the text on his screen, just as another text came through.
“So much.” Tony bit his lip. “But I just… I can’t…” The male didn’t know how to explain it.
“You have to cut out the food if you want him to leave, we’ve been through this.” Natasha looked between Bucky and Clint as she spoke.
“We can comfort one another.”
“I need to get my holograms sorted out,” Tony muttered to himself, before looking over at his phone as it pinged, indicating a text. It was from Pepper.
“I can see myself getting into some trouble with him. He’s a bit of a rule-breaker.” The delta continued to calm the blonde down. “He thinks he’s funny but can come off as kind of an ass. But I think it’s more of a defence for him. SHIELD is going to improve with him around.”
The blonde female alpha from earlier had made her way over to Tony, crouching down and looking him over, her eyes apologetic. “I am so sorry, I don’t know why he’s acting this way. Are you okay? I’m going to speak to him, I promise… I’m Brooke by the way.”
“I am really sorry about that.” Tyler sighed, looking at Tony again. “I can go if you want me too.” The alpha scratched the back of his neck out of nervousness before taking a step back.
“Come on. I promise to be on my best behaviour. I just want to have a look at what you have here. Just to see if it’s any good.” The omega had a grin on his face.
“Of course.” Tony let out a sigh. “Save it and close it down, J, and then pour me a coffee I’m going to need it… and thank you for the warning.”
“Could you update Steve, please? Let him know that it’s my hormones and that he can come and see me. I’m not angry at him anymore if he wants to talk.” Tony asked, climbing into the hot bath.
“You were never taught how to hunt?” Steve was shocked as he sat beside the smaller wolf. “You did so well though. You were so close to getting me, especially with no training. Who the hell gives up on training a hunter after their first hunt? I’d be surprised if you caught anything. It’s not easy.”
“The highest is five.”
Tony was in the middle, Steve curled up around him as he groomed the omega’s head. Hulk was towards his rear, eyes closed but Tony knew he was awake. Behind him and Steve were Bucky and Sam, Tony couldn’t see them, but they had been cuddling earlier when the omega had first joined Steve. Thor was close to his head, awake and cleaning his paws. Loki had made his way over and curled up against the other side of him. Clint had curled up in front of him and had fallen asleep not long after Natasha had cuddled up between him and Hulk.
As soon as they got home, Tony was swarmed with the bots. The omega happily greeted them all, laughing as he patted them all, each beeping happily in return. JARVIS also happily greeted the brunette, sounding happy that Tony was home safe.
“Or he’s interested in you.”
“Um, y-yes?” Steve sounded unsure as he stepped away.
“I want to come on a mission. I don’t have to do anything but I’m just as much as part of this pack as you, so I want to come.”
Steve had a problem. He couldn’t stop talking to Tony. Their texts were almost constant. From the moment he woke up to when he went to sleep. At first, the texts were sweet and friendly, but they had gotten flirtier over the past two weeks since Tony sent the first text. They had also begun to talk over the phone each night, sometimes Steve fell asleep whilst still on call but had woken up to a good night text from the omega anyway.
“They’re not my pack. Just good friends.”
“I don’t know anything.”
“Thanks, Steve.” Tony gave a smile, taking the cone from the alpha, biting on his lip as he stared at the bright blue ice cream before taking a lick. “I think my tongue is going to be blue.”
“I could ask if you could come tonight you know?” Tony began as he pulled back from the alpha. “I’m sure they won’t mind. I bet Pepper would like to know you better and Rhodey would like to see you again.”
“I’ll put an arrow through your head next time!” Clint shouted at the two wolves as Natasha put an arm around him. “You don’t touch our omega!”
“I’m Clint, this is Natasha. Bruce invited us to go shopping with you. He’s in the shower by the way. Well, he asked me because you said it was cool. Nat just came along because she can.” The male spoke. Tony narrowed his eyes. He looked familiar.
“Steve is never going to find you.”
“Definitely not.” The omega confirmed, looking straight into the alpha’s blue eyes.
“Come on Steve, I can be useful! Let me do something. I always get bored when you go out.” Tony turned to the blonde after pushing the button for the elevator. “I know how to use a gun and I have basic combat skills. I can keep myself out of trouble. I can even just fly the quinjet if you want!”
“I can’t dance.”
“Are you going to let that thing of yours talk to me like that?” Brock turned to Steve, pointing over to Tony.
“It’s cute,” Nat smirked, sitting on the bottom of the bed.
“So, are you going to dinner?” Pepper asked, twiddling her chopsticks.
Reasoning: I debated giving Natasha an alpha title, but I didn’t want too many alphas in the pack. I also didn’t want her to be higher than Bucky, just because Steve and Bucky have been friends for so long. I wanted the red not only because it’s her hair colour, but I have a fox soft toy called Natasha and wanted something similar but without her being a different species. I did think about her being something different because she’s Russian, but I went with a wolf in the end. Also, her fur is similar to Clint because, murder twins. Why not?
Clint nodded. “We just normally order a shit load of sides like onion bhajis, chips, samosas, poppadoms, the lot.”
“Hi.”
//“Let’s go to the lab and blow something up.” Tony’s mood had completely changed.
Tony smiled, taking another drag as he looked around at the others that were also outside. He noticed an alpha watching him, making him uncomfortable. The omega stepped closer to Bucky, smiling nervously at the beta.
“Or we could go to a party?” Tyler suggested, wiggling his phone.
Tony was so headstrong when he had his mind set on something it was going to happen. It was one of the qualities that were so amazing yet so frustrating to Steve because it also meant that the omega wasn’t always aware of putting himself in danger. He liked to push the limits, but sometimes it was too much. It isn’t a very common quality in an omega.
“I-I.” The alpha was stuck, his brain could have literally been broken by the one word.
Tony sat up, causing the alpha to uncurl from around him. Steve let out a whine, looking up at the wolf he was no longer grooming. Tony ignored the whine and leant forward to groom the golden wolf, starting at his head. Both of their tails began to wag as the omega groomed the alpha wolf. They were in their own world, happy in one another’s company and wouldn’t change it for anything.
1. Tony Stark makes up for a lack of a god by looking like one himself.
“Pumpkin-pie!” Tony cheered, arms wrapping around the alpha.
, he thought.
“I’ll go make you that tea.” Sam stood up and practically ran into the kitchen.
“We could play never have I ever?” Scott, the omega sitting beside Tony had suggested.
“They helped me when I first got here.”
“I’m surprised they said yes.”
“S-Steve.” Tony giggled, his head tilting as the alpha’s light kisses continued to kiss his neck, tickling him.
“Alright, I’m sitting.” The blonde sat down beside Tony. “Better?”
He heard Nat laugh down the phone, no doubt Clint would be pouting. They couldn’t be far at all. Clint’s scent, the one he decided to focus on, was very strong now. Natasha was still laughing down the line until it cut off. The blonde looked down at his phone, cursing at the fact he’d been hung upon. The archer was on thin ice with the alpha’s patience.
“Yeah, I think he has a thing for the omega I made friend’s with today.”
“I enjoyed it too Steve.”
“Of course.”
“Oh, I don’t think that’s a good idea.” The delta muttered, shaking his head. Food and drinks were something he could get away with, sort of, but an unauthorised shifter? That was something else.
“Chicken and mushroom penne with, have you got any whiskey? I forgot to look.” Tony looked at the woman.
Tony nodded in response, linking arms with Pepper as they left the workshop. The omegas made idle chatter about Pepper’s work as they walked out of SHIELD and took the ten-minute walk down to the ice cream parlour. Pepper ordered a raspberry ripple cone and Tony ordered a double scoop cone of salted caramel. The two sat at a table, Tony already beginning to lick his ice cream before they even sat down. The shop was pretty empty due to it being a weekday and being in the middle of February. It wasn’t freezing but wasn’t particularly warm either, but Tony needed comfort food, which was ice cream, and Pepper knew that.
“With you it is,” Loki replied, not looking up from the book in his hands.
Tony pulled the blankets over his head. There was too much noise and his head hurt. He remembered going out with Bruce last night, almost getting into a fight and something about butts. Groaning softly, he opened his eyes and lowered the blankets, daring to look into the light of the room.
“Yeah, doll.” Steve nodded in confirmation as he flagged down a taxi. Tony continued to grin at the alpha as they got into the cab, Steve telling the driver their destination before settling down beside the brunette.
The brunette sighed, running the bath.
“Natasha and Bucky are finishing up a training session downstairs and Steve has been in panic mode all day trying to get the house sorted or some shit,” Sam replied before snatching the menu.
“I know. It’s all most done. But-” The omega paused and used a hand to stable himself against the elevator wall as another wave of nausea hit. Agent Carter looked concerned, Tony swallowing before taking a deep breath and continuing. “I should go home and rest.”
“Tony, this is Peter. He likes the quinjet you designed.”
“We need to get out of this place. I can’t stay here.” Tony shook his head, coming to a stop. “God I’m gonna be sick.”
“Loki? And you questioned my name.” Fire began to laugh.
Bucky gave an apologetic look as Steve sighed and nodded. Tony climbed off the alpha’s lap, biting his lip as the alpha rubbed a hand over his face. Bucky left the two alone once more, most likely to get the pack together for Steve.
, Bruce thought before an idea came to his head.
First, he needed to pee, then he was going to get another drink.
“Your eyes are beautiful.”
The two began laughing again before deciding that they really should get a move on before they were late. Tony made sure his room was tidy although Agent Coulson assured him that the staff would be cleaning it tomorrow anyway and the room would be his again if he ever needed it. Tony’s stuff was packed into the car in one trip and the two wolves drove to The Avenger’s Packhouse. Bruce led Tony inside, both of them carrying the omega’s things before placing them down at the door.
“Touché.” Tony grinned. “Well played, Agent Carter.”
“I can’t believe you didn’t tell us it was your birthday yesterday,” Bruce said, placing the cake on the counter.
“The alpha is clearly affected by the omega smell. Can you not tell?” Loki spoke up, putting his book down.
Bruce had a quick shower, drying off and getting changed into a new set of clothes. The delta threw his dirty clothes and towel into the hamper before leaving the bathroom and going downstairs, deciding to leave his hair wet. Bruce walked into the kitchen, smiling at the lasagne Steve had just placed on the side.
“Mr Stark, I’m Collette. I’m here to take you to your meeting with Agent Coulson.” The blonde smiled.
“Then I will have a good time on your behalf, as well as mine.”
Tony grinned, snuggling back into the armchair as Steve walked over to the other alpha and placed a glass of water in front of him. The alpha didn’t seem so impressed to see Tony sitting there, but if Steve allowed him to stay then he would.
“Normally it should work.” Clint pressed a few more buttons, causing a pad to light up with a handprint.
"What?" Tony lifted his head.
The golden wolf sniffled around the omega’s underbelly and went to nuzzle into it, to which Tony let out a warning growl before he realised what he was doing. The alpha’s head turned to face the omega, letting out a whine as if to apologise to him before sitting in front of the smaller wolf. Seeing that the larger wolf wasn’t a threat either, and his growl didn’t anger the dominant male and had accepted his submission, Tony rolled onto his stomach and looked up at the alpha who leaned in close again, nuzzling against the side of the omega’s snout.
Steve tugged Tony out of the back door, literally bouncing with excitement as he pulled the omega towards the woods. It was just a little before lunchtime and Steve had come up with a great idea for their lunch date.
“Ah, my favourite magician,” Tony replied. “Just trying to get an appointment for today. I really need it.”
Tony huffed and sat up, watching the alpha run into the woodlands. It didn’t take too long for the golden wolf to return, a large hare in his mouth. Tony didn’t mind eating raw meat, his stomach was adapted to doing so, but he did prefer it cooked. But Steve had hunted for him, so Tony was just going to shut up and eat it because it was fine.
“Just a busy day.” It wasn’t a lie, he had been very busy, just not so much with his projects, more with his new friend.
“Mute JARVIS. You’re supposed to be on my side.”
"Fire and I are only half. Both of our mums were human." Tony sighed. "That's probably why they can't hold their state as well."
“I’ll see you later, Tony. Text me and hopefully, we can go out and meet up with Brooke and Tammi. I don’t know when Rhodey will be back but I’m hoping soon.” Pepper said as she left the room, waving to the omega.
“Puny omega,” Hulk grunted out before stepping back.
“It was definitely a diversion then? A plot to kill us?” Sam asked.
“Everyone wants his ass.” Bucky laughed.
Clint nodded a little in understanding. The whole pack knew how busy the scientist could get with projects for SHIELD.
Tony walked by Steve, still in his wolf form, tail flicking as he ignored the alpha. He would talk to Steve in private upstairs. Tony knew the alpha was following him as they went to the top floor and into their bedroom. It was then when Tony shifted back into his human form.
“No TIA, Tony is your mummy, we’ve been through this.” Clint groaned loudly before looking at the bot in his lap. “BRIE, go to mummy,” BRIE responded, beeping and flying over to Tony, to which the omega pouted. “See, she knows.”
“What’s the time now?”
“Yes, thank you. Oh, and Wanda and Pietro are happy to stay here.” Steve replied.
“Fuck my life.” Tony groaned, pulling the blankets over his head once again. Upon hearing laughter, that wasn’t Bruce’s, the omega lowered the blanket and glanced around the room. Two wolves, a female beta and a male delta, sitting on his bed. “Who the fuck are you?”
“I know you do.”
Unlike Tony, she didn’t have anyone to rely on and had to keep positive or she was sure she would go insane. Cheetahs were solitary animals, in some cases, male cheetahs would band together in pairs or small groups of three or four, but it wasn’t very common. She only had herself, had done from a young age. She never knew her father and her mum died when she was thirteen. She didn’t keep in contact with her half-sister, who wasn’t a shifter and had a life of her own, back in Paris where she originally came from. She had moved to the states when she was only fifteen, sneaking onboard a cargo ship. Still, nowhere had felt like home to her.
Bruce,  Clint and Natasha form an alliance.
Tony had messed around with creating AI bots before, most ended up only being designs or half-finished projects. One of the bots flew around to Tony’s face, the omega smiling and holding out his hands so the bot could rest on his hands.
“Things are a bit on edge. I think Clint’s got some cabin fever, he’s becoming more irritating. He’s also raiding whatever food you guys have left right now. Clint’s behaviour isn’t helping the Steve situation, he’s getting moodier by the second. Also, Sam wants to get some sleep after being out last night. I’m going to go to the shop, get some more food. Do you want anything?”
alpha and the omega hasn’t quite wrapped his head around it. He had befriended three of the members of The Avengers Pack and developed a major crush on their alpha and had got to cuddle with him last night. He had known about the famous pack a few years back when he was in his own. They had formed around five years ago and were known for being a highly successful pack that helped shifters and took down troublesome packs.
“Take Tony to the quinjet and stay with him. Make sure to check him over, we’ll be with you soon.”
“But I do worry. I can’t help it.” Steve said, he seemed hesitant, like he was going to say something else but didn’t. Tony leant up to kiss the alpha softly, smiling as he pulled back. “What are you working on?”
“No, you’re a pain in my backside.”
“But it’s your birthday. We have to do something special.” Steve was pouting now, looking at the omega with hopeful eyes.
“That omega? You’re here to rescue that waste of space?” Sam let out another growl.
“Did you know Pepper is allergic to strawberries? I almost gave them to her once because I got mixed up and thought she loved them.” The omega said as he picked up the red fruit.
Steve and Tony have a talk, lots of cuddles and a date.
“I- okay. Fine. You can stay in the spare room.” Steve pulled off as the light turned green.
The day had gone by so quickly which had caused the omega to worry more. He was going to keep the job at SHIELD, he enjoyed working on projects and keeping himself busy. But that could always change now. The pack might expect him to become a proper omega now that he was living there, although it could be only temporary, and expect him to do all the cooking and cleaning like most omegas would. The Avengers Pack had never had an omega before so they would share jobs that an omega would normally do, but now Tony was moving in they could give it all to him, meaning that he would have to resign from his job at SHIELD.
“Come on Tony. Please.” Bruce’s eyes closed before sniffing and opening up again to look over at Pepper. “I can’t get in. We have access to each other’s rooms but I think he’s barricaded the door so I can’t open it.”
4. That Steve scene with the helicopter.
“I’ve arranged to go out to dinner tonight.” Tony began, not looking up “I probably should have told you before.”
“I can’t believe you sassed Rumlow.” Fire grinned.
Steve looked up as there was a thump, seeing a door face down on the ground, Natasha standing in the doorway.
“Sounds good.” Tony nodded and hugged Pepper just before she left.
“I can help.” Steve smiled, climbing out of the bed and stretching before walking over to the omega. “Did you have a good day?” Steve asked, arms wrapping around Tony from behind.
“Our babies, huh?” Steve raised an eyebrow.
“Tony, you think you wandered off? Is that what Stane told you?” Pepper asked hesitantly. Tony only nodded in response. “That manipulative bastard.” The brunette looked up at Pepper, confusion written all over his face before the redhead continued. “Tony, your mum did die protecting you, but it was in the packhouse. You were both at home, a supposedly safe environment. The house was attacked whilst the pack was out. Your father didn’t make it back in time to save Maria, but he saved you in time. The rival pack was coming for you.”
“Nothing. You’ve seen me alive and well. Now out of my space so I can work.” Tony said as he began to make himself a coffee. The omega looked up, everyone had left, no shadows out in the hallway. Everyone except Steve of course.
“I am not embarrassing.” Tony huffed, arms folding.
“Never have I ever had a one-night stand?” She asked, Tony and three other omegas drinking.
Clint shot the alpha an irritated look before doing the same to the delta who just kicked his leg. Thor was first at the pasta dish, he made himself and Loki a plate before turning to Bucky at his side.
Even though Tony was terrified of moving in, and the pack’s opinion of him, he was glad it was happening. The two of them were becoming close and he had begun to care so deeply for the alpha. The slower steps they were taking had helped and made him more comfortable around Steve and he didn’t panic so much. Worries were always around but he would find someone to talk to them about, mainly his therapist or Pepper. If it concerned Steve the alpha had a right to know so Tony would tell him. The omega would also seek comfort in Bruce, Tammi, Natasha and even Clint. He had grown close to them all and it wouldn’t surprise him if he got close to the rest of the pack too, if all things went well. Omegas naturally had a charm about them which made it easy for them to get along with others and could diffuse conflicts easily, that being when they didn’t want to fight themselves.
3. That Bucky scene with the bike.
“Fuck.” The omega paused, eyes closing as he felt like he was going to throw up. “I can’t do this anymore.” DIEGO would be fine for now and it would only take him a couple of minutes to run to the shop and get a pregnancy test.
“It’s a talent.”
“Of course, Sir,” JARVIS replied, causing the pack to look up, trying to trace the voice.
“Of course and maybe you should text Steve too. Offer him to join us and you can talk about some ground rules. I’ll be there too.”
“We’re going to help too.” Bucky stepped forward, placing a hand on the alpha’s shoulder.
“If I’m asked.” The beta shrugged, taking a sip of her drink immediately.
“I warned you.” Sam let out a yawn.
The three of them headed towards the door, but before Tony could set outside, Tyler had held him back, letting Bucky go out without them.
“No smiles for you.” Tony frowned as Bruce fixed up his tie.
“Oh no, definitely not.” Bruce stepped inside, pressing the button for the second and hoping that he could distract him once the elevator got to the floor above them. As soon as the doors began to open, Bruce pressed the ones to shut them, much to Tony’s annoyance who then tried to press for the doors to open again and failed.
“Hey, Tony, right?”
Tony put on his t-shirt before wiggling out of his trousers. The alpha folded his uniform onto the chest of draws before doing the same with Tony’s clothes that he had thrown around the bed. Steve joined Tony under the covers, leaning in to give the omega a peck on the cheek. After a few minutes of silence, Steve spoke up.
“Hulk.” Steve stepped forward, in front of Tony, protecting him just in case. Tony lowered himself to the ground. “This is Tony. He is our omega.”
Pepper rolled her eyes but hugged the brunette anyway. “But you’re okay, yes?”
She took it gratefully before looking at Bruce, holding out her hand for him to come too. He declined like he had done to Tony last night which made both wolves frown.
Tony thought about it before nodding “Yeah, sure. It would be nice to meet someone else.”
“Listen to this alpha Tony, she knows.”
“Please?” Tony looked up at him with those gorgeous chocolate eyes and the alpha almost melted.
The two exchanged numbers before the alpha left, leaving Tony alone once more. He missed being around Steve’s pack. He was desperate to hear back from them, but he knew that it was going to be a long mission. The omega looked at the last text he sent to Steve with a sigh, as if staring at it would make the mission finish sooner and Steve would text him back.
I love this chapter and pretty much all the chapters I've written after this one so far.
“Why?” Tony asked, taking a seat beside Bruce.
“I’ll do that.” Clint was silent for a whole second. “What are you doing here?”
The two wolves walked into the kitchen looking around. Bucky opened the fridge, taking out a paper bag with his name on. Tony had started making lunches for the pack, and Steve had tried to convince him not to, but the omega had insisted and did it anyway. Natasha told him that it was an omega thing, and no doubt would be trying to take over their chores soon. Tony had been moved in for just over two weeks and things had been going well. He had yet to be put on the ‘Chore Chart’ and the dinner rota, but everyone else was happy to wait, and Tony did help without being asked to anyway.
Pepper looked over at the alpha, her eyes narrowed in suspicion.
“How long until he returns?” Tyler asked, swaying them gently.
Steve had to hold back a laugh. “Enough Clint. Bruce did apologise. Now, help yourselves.”
Steve let out a growl. “Don’t you speak to your alpha like that.”
After a few moments of silence, Tony spoke up again.
“I need you to test something for me.” Tony rinsed off another plate before putting it in the dishwasher.
Steve laughed at that, also taking a strawberry as he shook his head no. Steve grabbed another tub, containing mini sandwiches and opened it up, taking one of the peanut butter ones. Tony tried to keep the glasses for the champagne up, but they kept toppling over. The omega stuck out his tongue a little, concentrating on trying to balance them on the blanket, only for them to topple over once more.
“The cannelloni here is really good.” Pepper spoke up “I’m definitely having it again.”
“Steve, it’s just another day. I got to spend it with you and that was great. That’s all I needed. I don’t need any presents or extra special treatments.”
Tony shrugged. “Have you got any juice? Orange or apple is good.”
“No, please stay. We were having fun, right?”
“But nothing, Tony. Even if you did sleep with him you can. It doesn’t make you a whore. Kissing him doesn’t make you a whore. Nothing like that makes you a whore.”
Tammi had only spoken one word and Tony knew she was nervous and shy. There was an uncomfortable silence surrounding them and the brunette wanted to say something, anything, to the omega that was sat with him, but he had no idea what.
“Did... did you have to leave work?” Tony was hesitant about having to ask.
“Coffee.”
Tony took the card, looking over it, the words ‘S.H.I.E.L.D Guest ID’ printed across it along with with the same eagle logo that was on the door and the number 2.04 which he briefly remembered as his room number.
“Thank you, Peg. I’ll head over there right now.” The blonde nodded, smiling at the agent before turning on his heels and heading to SHIELD Medical.
“JARVIS?”
“What?” Bucky looked up at the omega in confusion, his arm which was wiggling about had come to a stop.
“It’s not your fault, Pepper. The sad thing is I’m not even surprised Obadiah did this.”
“Here.” Steve was back, holding out the ice cream cone in front of Tony’s face.
“No.” The omega frowned, offended.
“You’re amazing Steve. Thank you so much.” Tony bit his lip before kissing the alpha’s cheek.
“Yeah, my dad taught me. You think I’d design a jet, one specifically designed for our pack, that I couldn’t at least fly?”
Thank you to QueenE, tabbycat1220, BuckyAboveEverything and WhyIotta for commenting and everyone else who left kudus. It means a lot to me, thank you.
“Don’t do it, Steve. He’ll kill me anyway.”
Tony was in tears as he leant over to hug the other omega, her eyes also watering at her own story.
“That would ruin the surprise now, wouldn’t it? I mean it would be best if I could see you in action to analyse your fight patterns and see what could be improved.” Tony paused, nose scrunching up in thought. “Maybe I should come down to the training room more.”
“We had been playing loads of other games beforehand so his scent was everywhere, and it was back before we were properly trained, so I couldn’t track him. Plus, that would have been cheating. So, I looked around the wing again, checking the toilets last and there he was, head stuck underneath the toilet door, wiggling to try and get free and asking for help.” Rhodey began laughing, Pepper joining in too. “He was stuck, and he couldn’t shift, or move forwards or backwards to free himself. I sat there laughing at him for five minutes before going to get Pepper so we could both laugh at him”
“I’ll leave you to get to bed, I’m going to check on the others.” Steve had been focusing out the door and turned around to look at the omega and gulped.
“I’m sorry Tony. I didn’t want this to happen.”
“Most likely, yes. He’ll probably speed up the process when he’s not being distracting.” This caused Steve to sit back a little, a frown starting to form. Bruce had to hide a smirk at the alpha’s jealous scent.
“Do you want me to go?” Tony asked, going to stand up from the armchair.
“It will be fine. But I will go and call now, just to check.” The redhead made her way out of the room, her phone already to her ear.
Tony groaned as the knocking on the door increased. He nuzzled further into the pillow, pulling the duvet covers over his head and screwing his eyes shut even tighter, blue eyes and golden fur fading from his mind. It was far too early for the omega to be woken up.
“You lied to me.” The omega began, turning away from Steve and taking out some PJs from his draw. “You fucking lied to me, Steve. You could have at least told me the truth.”
“You can fly?”
“I-I’m good. I have a lunch date- n-not
"We're not in SHIELD anymore, JARVIS."
“You wouldn’t dare.” Tony let out another growl, fist banging on the glass. They would have found the envelope with the ultrasound in when they changed his clothes.
“Well, that sucks.”
“We don’t want any trouble, our alphas are having a good time, we will leave them be.” The female from before answered. “I’m Anna.”
“Steve! Wait up! I’ll come with you.” Bruce jogged over. “Peggy has gone with the rest of the pack.”
The mechanic was soon washed and dressed after having a chat with Bruce and a coffee. Bruce had taken a look at Tony’s wrist, deeming it only a mild sprain that should be healed within the next few days, a week at most and bandaged it up for the wolf again. The omega made his way out of the bathroom, dressed in a band tee and jeans, and looked around the room. The duvet had been placed back on the bed which was now neatly made.
Steve was still in his mission outfit; the dark blue suit had a silver star on the male’s chest, three stripes of horizontal silver on each side. It was a different one to which he wore on the night of their meal. Tony subconsciously traced over the star before looking up at Steve who was watching him with a soft smile.
“Yeah but if I didn’t wander off from my pack then I wouldn’t have put myself in danger. Then she wouldn’t have had to fight off the wolves as she protected me before the pack arrived.”
“I missed you a lot, Steve.” Tony smiled shyly up at the blonde.
“I think its time to go home.”
“Because you’re moving in.” Clint grinned, tapping at his phone.
Tony knew that the two of them will work through it together. Steve would support him, he wasn't going to abandon him like his previous pack. Steve wasn't like them.
"You don't need any more help?" The female asked.
“Just checking. Clint and Sam can get a bit rough, they’re used to playing with Thor and Hulk.”
“I believe this simulation could work, sir. Also, Master Rogers has woken and is coming to the lab straight away. He does not seem too happy that you left.”
“That’s what my uncle says.” Peter shrugged.
Fur colour: White wolf
Tony smiled a little bit, feeling safer already. Although he didn’t know Bucky that well, he was Steve’s beta, his second in command. If Steve could trust Bucky with his life, then he was good with Tony too. Tony glanced over at the alpha again, seeing him still watching. The omega looked up at Bucky, seeing the beta scowling over at the alpha, eyes narrowed. The beta moved to stand in front of Tony, out of the alpha’s eyesight, smiling down at Tony gently as he finished off his cigarette before putting it out.
“Steve?” Tony called and waited for a response.
Tony groaned at himself as he left the stall, throwing the pregnancy test in a bin before washing his hands. The omega was thankful no one walked in because he was on the verge of tears and he wasn’t sure if he was going to be able to handle this. Tony left the toilets, his head spinning. There was only one way he could check for sure, which would mean having an ultrasound.
“Okay.” Peter nodded, taking Steve’s hand. “Where are we going?”
"What do you want in return?" Strucker asked.
“Hey, you ready to get back home? Let’s get you back.” The delta spoke, ignoring Tony’s comment and taking a hold of his wrist as the omega started to lift it, going to swing at the alpha.  “Sorry, he’s had a lot to drink.” He continued, looking up at the alpha briefly before tugging on the omega to lead him outside before the drunk alpha could respond.
“Tony’s what?!” Bruce gasped, jaw-dropping.
Also, I put // again because a character is going to be talking about a sensitive topic to some (mentions of abuse, hints at sexual harassment and rape, panic attacks, anxiety and depression etc.) so feel free to skip over that.
I'm planning to update every Tuesday, Thursday and maybe the occasional Sunday to depending on my schedule at home.
“We’re here to kick your asses for taking Tony. We’ve come to reuse him.”
“I was so scared of telling Brooke how I felt but managed to, out loud. She cried so much, and I was scared that I had ruined everything, but she had returned my feelings. Now I have a new pack, an amazing one with an even better alpha who loves and cares for me. What they did to me and other omegas too, I won’t ever forget it and it. I am still nervous around higher-ranking wolves but I’m so much better than what I was because I opened my heart and took the opportunity to have a better life.”
The alpha left the table to get the ice creams, leaving Tony alone with his thoughts. Tony tried to think about the best way to get around this. He wasn’t breaking things off with Steve, he couldn’t even imagine doing that. He still cared about the alpha so much and half of him was screaming at him to ignore the panic and just continue with their courting as it was, but something inside of him had panicked and the omega couldn’t ignore it. It wouldn’t be fair on either of them. He didn’t want to have another panic attack further down the line in their courting for it to end it, due to Tony not handling things when he should have.
Brock looked at Steve in utter disbelief, still expecting the blonde to stick up for him. As if Steve would put Brock before his mate.
“Oh, thank you.” Tony smiled up at them all.
Tony looked up upon hearing a knock at his door. His phone continued to vibrate as he left it on his bedside table, no doubt Pepper would be having a go at Brooke. The omega walked to the door, standing up on his tip-toes to look through the peep-hole to see who was there. Bruce was standing at the other side, hands in his pockets as he looked up and down the hall. Even though he had access to Tony’s room whenever he wanted, he respected the omega’s privacy and wouldn’t come barging in whenever he wanted. Tony opened the door, only in his boxers and one sock as he ushered the delta in who looked at him funny.
This omega was going to be the death of him.
“Want to head to bed?” Steve asked, coming up behind the omega.
“Shut up, you love them.”
“In here.”
“Can’t what now?” Bruce asked, brow furrowing.
He had been trying to make sure that Clint, Bucky and Sam wouldn’t be able to harass the smaller wolf too much. Even though they said they wouldn’t, Steve just knew they’d be making comments to wind him up which could make the omega uncomfortable.
4) Pirate AU: (I like the pirates of the Caribbean alright) Captain Tony Stark, Commodore Steve Rogers -no one knows why Tony hates Steve so much until they find out why -ft. sneaky Loki trying to rule the land and sea and the two teams have to stop him -Not sure if I can do this becasuse I can't type like a pirate because I'll get angry/forget about the grammar with how they talk.
“Where are you from?” Tony tilted his head slightly.
“Just shut up.” Tony shook his head, running his hand through Sam’s fur as the wolf approached the pair.
“Sokovia.” She made her way over to him, sitting down in front of the male wolf.
“Omegas that have alpha-like tendencies. They saw that in me. They must have seen that in you.” The redhead said carefully. “Our DNA will be put into two humans, so they will lead the pack. Even though they will be omegas, they have enough alpha within them to lead. But not enough to try and take over the alphas of their pack. So then HYDRA can take over the world.”
Sam growled but didn’t move. Clint sent a reassuring smile to the wolf, letting him know it would be okay. They’d get out of this.
“It’s alright, Agent Barton, I’ll see to your report later on if you’d like to leave it with Agent Hill.” The human spoke, making both wolves turn to face him instead of staring at one another. The delta gave a firm nod before leaving the room and Agent Coulson focused on the omega in front of him again. “If you are curious about any job vacancies, you are welcome to ask at reception and they will give you a list. For now, you can retreat to your current room or help yourself to food in the cafeteria. I hope to hear back from you in 24 hours. If I don’t, I’ll assume that you have declined our request to stay here and I’ll send some agents to make sure your room is cleared out.” The agent continues as he stands from his desk and walks back over to the door, opening it up.
“Hi, Tones.” The alpha hugged him back. “You’ve been drinking, haven’t you?”
Steve thought.
“You’re right… You’re worse.”
The door to the room opened up, causing Fire to sit up from the bed. She sniffed, smelling the burning rage coming from Tony. She watched as the wolf paced around the room, a scowl on his face.
“Right, I need a ciggy. Anyone want to come outside?” Bucky asked, standing from the table.
The brunette let out a laugh and shook his head, amused. “Good choice there, Rogers.”
“If that’s alright with you,” Sam added.
Bruce was sent out on a mission with the rest of the pack four days ago for a long hall trip. He didn’t know when they would be back and was missing them all, but Steve in particular. Since Tony had a chat with Steve three months back, they had gone on a few small dates whenever they could; the movies; Steve taking out Tony for lunch on his break; walks through the park. Nothing else happened except a few small and sweet kisses, cuddles and hand-holding here and there. Steve had been so accepting of the omega’s terms and was willing to wait that it made Tony’s heart want to burst. Tony only went to the packhouse two other times since dinner, one was for Bucky’s birthday and the other was for another meal, and he knew that the alpha wanted him to go more, but he didn’t push it and didn’t ask Tony to stay either. Their relationship had done a 180, going from very intense to being more subtle and sweet but it was slowly turning back at Tony’s new pace.
“Me?” The omega raised an eyebrow as the alpha strode over to the table.
With a sigh, Tony took another swig from the bottle of whiskey and grabbed the soldering iron once more. He had been using a glass earlier, but he got tired of refilling it. He continued with his latest job for SHIELD; some new tech for the helicarrier, looking over the schematics once more.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We could go to the lake again?”
“Is your ass jealous?” The omega asked, just as Steve was about to step in.
Steve let out a growl, pulling back a little to look Tony in the eyes. Steve was furious, eyes dark, scowling. Tony turned away from the alpha, not being able to meet his eyes.
“I’ll get you your own helmet,” Steve spoke after they had parked up, the alpha helping Tony out of his. “Instead of using the spare. It would be one that fits and suits you too.”
“Hey, narcissism is my thing.”
“What are you working on?” Steve asked.
“I like your smell though. It’s nice.”
“Well, no, not exactly. I-I mean I’d like to, but I don’t think that’s going to happen.”
Smirking, Tony picked up a sushi roll from his plate before throwing it at the redhead, watching it hit her shoulder and land on the floor. He took a glance at the chef, thankful that he wasn’t watching the two wolves, so he wouldn’t be offended by Tony throwing his food.
“You’re mated right?” The redhead tilted her head, Tony nodding in response. “Have you tried your bond?”
“Brock, this is my mate, Tony. Tony, Brock Rumlow.” Steve introduced them.
The omega rested his forehead on the alpha’s own, both their eyes closing. It was a common and intimate wolf gesture that showed affection, especially between mated and courting wolves or a parent and pup. Tony pulled back a little before placing a sweet kiss on Steve’s lips before bumping their noses together affectionately, causing the blonde to blush. Tony let out a quiet laugh, stroking the alpha’s cheeks gently with his calloused thumb, humming quietly. Steve leant into Tony’s touch, eyes remaining closed as Tony caressed his cheek.
“But I might break something.”
“Happy?” Steve asked, pausing from grooming the brown wolf.
Everyone turned to face them from their spot at their table, their conversations dying. Steve would always be at the head of the table, on his right would always be Bucky, Thor, Loki and Bruce in that order. On Steve’s left Natasha, Sam and Clint, in that order. However, the three on his left had moved down a seat, allowing a space for Tony to sit next to the alpha.
Tony laughed and paid for his and Pepper’s meal before giving a hug to both females. Brooke was surprised at first but happily hugged the brunette back before joining her mate at the table once more as the male omega left the happy couple.
“Please, Steve? I don’t like to be alone when drunk.” And damn, Steve was whipped.
“I probably really shouldn’t but fuck it, sure.” Tony went to stand but Steve made him sit.
Tony watched sadly as his friend walked away before staring at the table and pushing his food away, suddenly not hungry.
“Really? They’re some great friends then.” A pause “Could I make it up to you somehow? A drink perhaps?”
Steve tilted Tony’s face so he could look him in the eyes, hand cupping the omega’s jaw gently. Steve smiled sadly, wiping away a bit of chocolate that was in the corner of Tony’s mouth. The omega very rarely talked about his past, but it didn’t take a genius to figure out that the brunette had a rough past and was mistreated. Steve would be willing to listen to Tony if he ever wanted to talk about it.
“I’m not worried.”
“How do you get your roll-ups so perfect? I prefer them but they’re a pain to roll.” Bucky asked, looking at Tony’s cigarette in his hand.
“I only know this happened because I saw the video, I have no recollection of the night and if I hadn’t seen the video my friend Rhodey recorded I would have denied it completely even if though it was something I would have done back then. Normally he would be trying to chase me down, but I was being compliant, so the bitch decided to record me to prove what a mess I had been. Pepper is the only other person who has seen it.” The omega began, placing his scotch down on the table.
“Put your hand on it and try saying your name?” Bruce suggested.
“You know something?” The delta asked. Steve must have overheard because he paused before walking over.
“Of course.” The alpha rolled his eyes again, waving to the omega as he left.
Tony walked up to the house, music blaring loud. It has been a while since he went to a house party, going out into clubs was completely different, and even then, it had been months.
“Clint, what the fuck?”
2) Uni AU -Tony is popular but alone (depression, suicidal thoughts etc.) he actually has no one (no Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, parents etc.). Steve is popular and has lots of friends -they become friends with benefits that evolves into more.
Bucky gave a small smile, nodding as he removed his current arm, Tony helping him put on the one he had made. The beta smiled as he wiggled his metal fingers and clenched his hand into a fist.
“Aren’t you going to shift?” Tony asked Bruce as the delta walked over.
“Thor could fall asleep anywhere, you know that, and I don’t mind at all.” Bruce smiled down at the blonde before looking up at Bucky. “What brings you here?” The scientist asked, bookmarking his book before putting on the bedside table.
Sniffling and looking up and down the hall, Tony stepped out, being as quiet as possible as he tiptoed to the door. He was hoping that he wouldn’t get caught by anyone or they caught his smell. The omega managed to sneak out of the front door, closing it as slowly and quietly as possible behind him, hissing at the bright sunlight of the outside.
“I know.” Peter giggled. “You already said.”
Brooke returned to the teary-eyed omegas, looking between them, worried. “What happened?”
“You’ll be okay?” Steve asked, turning to Tony.
“Alone?”
They went around and around to each person and Tony’s cup kept needing to get refiled because it was very rare that he hadn’t done something because Tony was wild back in his early days but didn’t regret a thing. Rhodey had come to check on him a few times but saw that Tony was happy enough being around other omegas, so went to go dance inside with the other alphas again. Soon enough the game came to an end and the redheaded male brought out some pre-rolled joints. Now the party was going to get fun.
“What have you been working on?”
A question to get to know you guys because I am a nosey person.
“Access denied.”
“I forgot how much of a dick you are.” Clint sighed.
“We got your clothes. Oh, and Bucky updated us while you were off galivanting with Steve’s omega all night. They saw each other last night. Can you believe it… Wait, did he tell you?” Clint gestured to Tony, keeping his voice low.
Steve looked around but the pack had all pointed to the far corner of the room, where Thor was making his way onto the stage where there was a microphone. The lion was grinning as he walked over to a man who was sat behind a laptop and began talking to him.
“I- Clint. What on Earth are you doing out here?” The alpha lowered his packmate back into the floor, tone stern.
“What the fuck?” The beta gave Tony a confused look before taking a drag.
Steve was taken aback when the delta pup hugged him, sniffling into his chest. But the alpha hugged the boy back. He needed the reassurance. Peter was a smart kid and had clearly gone through trauma before to be able to piece things together so quickly and to be so brave to ask such a horrible question.
“Thank you, Phil.”
“Um… I can’t remember.”
“Of course.” The alpha helped the brunette down from the bed. “If you need anything else, just let me know.”
Pepper and Tony would always have a number system. Tony would have a lot of panic attacks and general worries about everything growing up. Tony would give a number out of five whenever he was going into a panic about anything. Some of the time it would be silly things, like the outfit that Tony was calling about and being dramatic on purpose. But both knew when it was something serious.
“Didn’t you get offered it when you arrived?” Pepper was confused, as far as she was aware, all rescued shifters were offered if after being taken in by SHIELD as they came from traumatised backgrounds.
“I was drunk!” The omega defended, flicking his roll-up as the two off them began to laugh.
“Tony you have to work with me here.” The delta sighed, scanning his card on for the elevator which opened immedicably.
“Shut up.”
“Your Uber will arrive in eight minutes.” The AI responded.
Steve burst out laughing causing the omega to blush slightly. Steve smiled softly as he pulled Tony closer so he could kiss him once more.
The beta nodded before leaving the kitchen, Tony let out a little sigh. He was excited to give Bucky his upgrade to his arm, but he didn’t want him to be offended, or it to fail. That would be awful and the whole pack would hate him.
“Yes. I believe we should.” Agent Carter nodded before looking around the room at everyone. “Good luck on your mission.” The two agents left the room and Clint ran over to where Phil was standing moments before.
“Steeveee.” Tony grinned, pulling open the door. Everyone was there, panicked looks across their faces.
Clint came running over, tail wagging as he pounced on the omega, causing Tony to fall on his side. Sam joined in too as the three of them fought playfully, until Clint accidentally nipped Tony’s leg too hard, the omega letting out a whine. Sam jumped back, stepping on Tony’s tail by accident, making the omega whine again. Both delta wolves were off him in seconds, ears flat as they both let out an apologetic whine.
“No, you haven’t. I’m not your puppet.” Tony shook his head. “HYDRA wouldn’t be making deals with you.”
“That’s so cool!” Peter gasped, letting go of Steve’s hand as he began to run towards it.
“Both of you in the back, Tony can sit upfront.”
“Tony.” Steve took a step forward as the omega turned to face him. The alpha paused, sniffing before shaking his head a little and looking at Tony once more. “Do you want to come upstairs and take a nap with me?”
“I’ve got it on my Netflix. I know it’s not the extended version but that’s okay right?” Clint looked back to Tony who nodded.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony looked towards the bedroom door as Steve walked inside and over to the omega, a tray of snacks in his hands. The alpha was beaming with happiness as he set the tray on the bed before running a hand through Tony’s hair gently.
“And no doubt make your stupid comments too.” Tony huffed, thinking about all the times he had been sassed by his AI.
The alpha made his way downstairs, waving at Bucky and Sam who had just come back from a mission and grabbed his keys. Making his way to one of the few cars the packed owned, he unlocked it and climbed in. He buckled in and started the car before making the twenty-minute drive to Aurora’s. Steve parked the car next to the club and started to walk into the nearest part of the woodland. He picked up Clint’s scent quickly considering the alpha hadn’t shifted and it had started to get stronger as he moved closer. Steve got out his phone, calling Clint’s number again, thankful when the delta picked up.
“Then what are we waiting for?”
The omega bit his lip nervously before going over to the ‘bed’ and climbing up to it on it. In a way, he was regretting not having anyone with him, but he needed this to be confirmed. If he was pregnant, he would talk to Steve first before telling the pack. The two of them never even discussed children, they only just mated. Tony swallowed, looking around the room while he waited for the doctor to return. A few minutes past and Tony looked up at the door as it opened, Dr Strange wheeling in the ultrasound machine and set it up beside the bed.
“Well, that’s a nice first thing to say to your guest.” Tony grinned, making his way over to the blonde.
“I’m going to take the stairs as I’m going down. I’ll see you tomorrow? Don’t be too late.”
“Tony! Bruce!” Clint called, poking his head out from the kitchen door. “We’re having Indian food! Come choose.”
“I wouldn’t touch them.” The wolf said, picking up a gun before looking at Pietro. “You meet your sister and start phase two, yeah?” Tony pointed to the gun the teen had picked up. “You’ll be okay using that?”
“Not another one of your crazy ideas.”
“01:04 am, Sir.”
“Steve.” Toby let out a sigh, managing to push back a little so he could look at the alpha’s face. “I’m sorry. I should have made sure that you knew I was going to work. I’m just used to going to do my work without people except Pepper checking up on me; caring about me; checking that I’ve eaten or slept. I’ll try to remember next time. But you shouldn’t have to worry about me.”
Tony burst out laughing, Clint rubbing the back of his head mouthing ‘oww’ where the redhead hit him. Steve smiled at the omega as his laughter subsided, Clint flipping him off playfully and Tony returned it.
Steve nodded, slowing down so the delta could catch up as the two of them walked through the doors to the medical centre. The two wolves made their way over to the reception desk, smiling down at the receptionist. A female human with dark hair in a bob cut, Faye written on her name badge. Steve sniffed. Although it was faint, Tony’s scent was here. The omega had definitely been here.
Tony shifted as promised before padding over to Steve, nuzzling into his side gently to get the alpha to stand. Steve’s tail wagged as he stood up, licking across Tony’s neck and face down to his muzzle. Tony nuzzled back into Steve, tail wagging a little as the alpha licked across the omega’s face. Steve eventually pulled back, his tail still wagging as he looked over the smaller wolf. The alpha began to walk forwards into the woods, Tony trailing a few steps behind but keeping close to the alpha.
“I missed you a lot.” Tony pouted as the blonde let him down, kissing his forehead.
“Never,” Tony growled.
(See the end of the chapter for
The wolf’s head snapped up, growling as three more agents came running towards them, causing the archer to roll his eyes. Sam ran towards them, taking one of them out while Clint took the other two out with an arrow to the head each, smirking.
“Oh. Thank god.” Steve rushed over to the brunette, holding him close. “I thought getting you back was only a dream.”
“I’m sorry Tony. I wish I would have known he told you that, I could have told you the truth.”
“Let me help.” Bruce had calmed down by now and picked up the tie before turning to face the pouting omega. “Smile, Tony.”
Okay, so you wanted to see what I thought of the pack (and a few others) in their shifted forms. This is just what I could find to be the closest I picture them being.
"I want to make sure all of us are looked after. I'm pregnant, I can't keep sleeping on these shitty beds. Wanda and Piero are going to be getting used to being a completely new species. None of us needs any more stress." Tony paused. "And get rid of Obadiah Stane. He'll only double-cross you."
Thor Odinson: Alpha Lion
He began to eat his food, knowing that none of them would mind. Sam asked the delta about his project with SHIELD and he informed them all that it was finished, and he was moving onto the next one. He complimented Loki’s cooking which was responded with a flick of his wrist, indicating it was no trouble for the beta, and a “thank you”.
“Welcome home, Sir.” JARVIS greeted as the omega walked inside, toeing off his shoes.
“You okay?” Steve asked, concerned. It was obvious that he caught the nervousness of the omega.
“No, thank you.” Pepper smiled as everyone else shook their heads.
“I-I just felt like I had control and now a rug has been pulled out from under me and I’m just falling… Waiting to crash.” Tony let out a sigh. “My old pack really fucked everything up. With Steve and me constantly thinking about them, I keep panicking. I haven’t talked to Steve in days. I haven’t slept in days. Steve will show up soon enough and he’s going to hate me and be so disappointed in. I feel like such a bad person Pepper.” Tony took a deep breath and continued, not wanting to hear Pepper talk any more about the alpha. “I’ve been so distracted with Steve that I feel like I am going to fail this project I’m working on. Then I just went into a spiral thinking about my father.” Tony grabbed hold of Pepper’s free hand “I was just thinking about how many times I let the old man down. How I could have done better. Done him proud.”
“C-cancel that order Nat,” Steve spoke down the comms.
Tony walked back over to Steve but instead of sitting beside him, the omega sat on his lap. Steve’s hands instinctively went to hold Tony’s hips and leaned close to the omega so he could whisper to him whilst the pack went back to chatting.
“Of course.” Pepper smiled at Tony as the human walked away.
“I’m sorry Agent Carter, but I’m going home.” Tony sighed. “I think I’ve caught a stomach bug. I can’t focus on my work while feeling like I’m going to be sick every five seconds.”
“Does that mean I can get pregnant?” Pietro looked frightened.
“I believe it would be a good idea.”
“I’m really fucking sorry for making you so upset over this. I don’t think I can control this. I don’t know why I’m being so protective over you, especially at home.”
“Tony?” Steve called, going over to the kitchen. The light was on and the alpha had awakened at 5 am to an empty bed once again. “Tony?” He repeated, poking his head through the door.
A shifter going into rut or heat was something else entirely. They were in a pure-animalistic rage, the need to mate and reproduce was so strong that even the most ethically abiding shifter would lose all sense of morals. The alpha shouldn’t have been out, let alone consuming alcohol, but if he was two weeks early than expected it wouldn’t have been his fault. A wolf can’t completely control their emotions and actions at the very early stages, normally around twenty-four hours before, when a heat or rut begins. The male from last night would have smelt Tony, an unmated omega and would have felt the need to mate him.
Tony nodded in response and got up, taking Steve’s hand once the alpha had stood too. They walked back to the house and through the back door, picking up on chatter coming from the living room. Tony looked up at Steve, who only shrugged before leading the omega to the room. Everyone turned their heads as the two wolves walked into the room.
“Hmm? Did you say something?” The alpha finally looked up at the three who began to laugh.
Tony only stared up at the camera in the room, mouthing ‘Deadman’ before looking at Fire once more and shrugged. “Something like that.”
The alpha smashed the glass before jumping out of the building, just as the beeping got louder and faster before stopping. He landed and looked up at the building in confusion before a loud bang went off, only having seconds to curl up and pull his shield to protect himself from the falling debris.
“This is why I snuck away this morning.”
So I've decided to leave the regular updates because I am too impatient. I'm a few chapters ahead so as long as it stays that way updates will be more frequent. I hope you like it.
“I knew that bastard was responsible.” Tony let out a low growl directed at the man he hated. “The pack left me. After two years of putting up with me, they finally left me behind. I tried to find my way to safety, but I accidentally fell asleep and I woke up here… What’s SHIELD?”
“Steve! No!”
“How was work today?” The alpha asked, smiling at Tony.
“I wanted to apologise again for that, I’m glad I found you.” The female smiled apologetically. “My brother, he started his rut this morning. Two weeks early… He must have been in the early stages last night. If we had known, we wouldn’t have come out. I’m so sorry about what happened, Tony.”
“What about Bruce? Isn’t he looking for you?” Steve couldn’t help but think about the poor delta trying to find them, panicked and desperate. He was surprised he hadn’t had a call.
“And you don’t think I was when I was out walking and suddenly felt I was being watched?” The omega turned to face Steve, anger starting to settle in. He was trying to keep calm, but it wasn’t working. Tony hated being lied to.
, replied as the gold moved as if it was to show it was speaking.
“You enjoyed making it Loki. Don’t lie.” Clint smirked over at the snow leopard, who only rolled his eyes in response but had the faintest of smiles you would only notice if you were looking for it.
Thank you so so so much for reading this. It really means a lot to me. I hope I've made people happy, and that you have enjoyed my story. I've really enjoyed writing it. All of the reads, comments and kudos makes me so happy every time I see I have more.
Tony didn’t get in until around 4 am then had to bandage his wrist, cursing at himself for being stupid. He remembers lying in bed for some time, his mind too awake and taking in the events of the night, before drifting off.
“Steve, we wouldn’t dream of being mean to Tony.” Bucky grinned. “It’s you we’re going to wind up.”
“No.” The reply caused Bucky to huff and roll his eyes, adjusting in his seat to get more comfortable.
“I’m sorry!” Clint ran out of the kitchen, causing Bucky to look up and over at the delta who was carrying a plate with a sandwich on. Sam lifted his head from Bucky’s lap, also looking over at the archer.
“JARVIS has alerted them. They’re on their way. Did you want me to come help?”
“Oh, thank goodness.” Tony smiled. “I thought you were Steve for a second.”
search for Tony. He had reached out to the other SHIELD bases across the country, but until he heard back, he couldn’t afford to do anything else without a lead.
Tony watched as everyone got into position. It was clear that The Avengers Pack went out often and had positions where each pack member would be. Steve was always upfront, as head alpha and the leader, he would lead the pack. On his right was Bucky and his left, Natasha. They were his second in commands, if Steve was never around, Bucky or Natasha would be in charge. Behind them was Sam, Hulk, Clint and Loki. Loki distanced himself a bit more from the pack but still stood close by. Tony was waiting to see where Thor would stand, so he could follow behind as the pack moved out, but Thor sat there, staring at Tony as if waiting for him to make the first move. The lion let out a soft roar before nodding his head towards the pack. The omega tilted his head, confused at what the feline was asking before Clint walked over.
Bruce lifted his hands and wiggled his fingers making Tony jump back.
“We have champagne. Steve?” The redhead turned to face her alpha.
“Where are you going?” The blonde asked, head tilting slightly as he grabbed the omega’s hand.
“Mario’s then?” Pepper smiled.
Okay so the bots to me are kind of like the brainbots from megamind but not quite the same shape and the don't have the sharp bits and mouths. But you can picture them however you want. I can't believe I've almost finished this, I'm really excited for the next chapter but I have family coming up over the weekend and then I'm going back to university of Tuesday, so I don't know when I will be able to post.
Steve’s phone pinged again for the fourth time which caused him to sigh with a nod. “Okay. Thank you, Thor.”
Tony nodded as he picked up his coffee and finished it off. Natasha had gone back to reading and the omega really wanted to check on Steve. Tony left the living room to wash up his mug in the kitchen, leaving it on the drainer to dry before going up to the top floor. He stood outside his and Steve’s bedroom door for a moment, unsure how to handle the situation. It was a possibility that Steve didn’t want to be comforted or talk. Tony knocked on the door before poking his head in.
Tony whined, burying his face into the alpha’s golden fur. He whined louder when Steve stood up. The omega remained lying down, looking up at Steve. He really didn’t want to go, even if it was just a few more minutes of relaxing with the alpha. But Steve had insisted, pawing at Tony before starting to walk off. Tony didn’t move as he watched the alpha who turned back to face the brunette when he reached the tree-line, holding Tony’s gaze for a moment before walking into the woods.
“It’s nice to meet you, Tammi.” Tony smiled at the newcomer.
Dinner Time!
“Tony?” It was Steve. The alpha was now standing beside Tony, arms wrapping around the smaller male to hold him close. “I was so worried.”
“Rhodey!” Tony grinned, hugging the alpha before turning to Pepper, hugging her too. “Pepper. You guys remember Steve, right?”
Brooke: Alpha Wolf
“Earlier this week. I needed it.” Tony shrugged. “Now throw your frisbee.”
“We left him for ten days and I doubt he’s eaten or slept much. He’s drunk, installed JARVIS, locked us out of our own home and created a flying robot army and has given them all weird names. One of them is named after Steve.” The beta pointed at the blonde wolf.
“How are you feeling?” The blonde asked, picking up Tony’s mug of coffee and placing it on the bedside table so it wouldn’t get knocked over being on the bed. “You slept most of the day, I thought I’d bring you some snacks before dinner. We’re going to get Chinese.”
“And you’re only omegas. Deltas, Betas and Alphas have stronger senses. Though, I’ve heard some omega’s get stronger senses once they have children. Protection or something. I haven’t had anything yet.”
Tony turned around, fully expecting to see Bruce standing there, but instead it was Steve. The omega blushed, looking down at the ground immediately, refusing to look the alpha in the eyes. After a moment of silence, Steve was the one to speak up.
Steve looked around for Tony as his pack continued to tease the archer, spotting him lying on the grass with Bruce and Sam. The alpha wolf excused himself from the conversation and walked over to the three of them, dropping down beside the omega. Tony turned to face him, smiling wide before sitting up. He had his sunglasses on, sunbathing in a patch of the garden that had the sun.
“Welcome. Voice activation required.” It sounded like JARVIS.
“He invited you to his house for dinner, Tony! He wants you to get to know his pack!” The redhead was on the verge of shouting at the brunette and shaking some sense into him.
Pietro breathed out a sigh of relief.
The cake was delicious, and Tony regretted not giving himself a bigger slice. He found out that it was Sam’s recipe and he had not so subtly hinted that the delta should make the cake every day, Clint, Bucky and Thor agreeing with him.
Loki shrugged before passing the menu to Thor who began to look it over. Natasha and Bucky walked in, greeting everyone in the pack before talking about what they wanted to eat. Tony wasn’t paying much attention as the pack’s conversation continued, he was too busy thinking about Steve and wondering when the alpha would arrive.
//“This place is shit anyway!” Natasha called, flipping off the security as they had their backs turned before doing the same to the alpha and beta she had just fought with as they walked down the street.
“Call me when you’re back,” Tony whispered, a hand resting on the blonde’s chest.
“Help! Help us!” Pietro called through the door before running over to Tony.
“It’s fine! We talked! Do you think I’d let him spend time with me otherwise?” Tony pulled at Rhodey’s arm to stop him from stepping closer to the other alpha wolf. “He apologised to me. He went into rut, he didn’t know. We’re fine.”
“We’re good.” The beta gestured over to Thor and Loki, who were packing away the supplies.
“I think it would go with Steve’s eyes.”
The elevator doors opened and the two walked out. However, to get to the roof they’d have to climb the stairs.
“Hi.” Tony smiled softly.
Tony looked up from his plate, mouth stuffed stuff of pasta. Swallowing, the omega took in the appearance of the alpha standing in front of him. It was Brooke’s brother. The blonde hair and blue eyes were vivid in his mind from that night although it was months back. Tony wiped his mouth of any sauce before nodding.
“Where’s Steve? I haven’t seen him all morning.” Tony frowned as he looked over at Natasha who was reading. He placed his mug of coffee on the coffee table, turning to face the redhead. “He wasn’t around when I woke up and he didn’t come to breakfast.”
Natasha Romanoff: Beta Wolf
Steve joined the rest of his pack, sitting beside Bucky, and they had begun the movie. Throughout it, the alpha wolf failed to sit still for longer than five minutes, giving occasional glances out of the door. The alpha ended up excusing himself halfway through, his face red and apologetic. After making sure the coast was clear, Sam paused the movie as Clint burst out laughing, eyes watering.
“Steve’s getting sexted again.” Bucky burst out laughing at his alpha’s red face as each text appeared on the alpha's screen.
Tony almost faltered, almost cracked under the words spoken to him. He had promised himself never again. Never again would he allow himself to be talked down to. He had Steve and the rest of the pack, who all loved him and cared for him; showed him what a proper pack could be like. This was just some dickhead, stuck in his ways, trying to assert any type of power over a lower-ranking shifter. Tony hated to think about how Rumlow’s pack must be treated.
“You got your head stuck under a toilet door,” Rhodey replied, not even looking up from his phone.
The wolf spotted a rabbit that just came out from a nearby bush. Tony crouched down and silently stalked over to it the best he could. He never got much training in hunting, as that was the “strong” wolves’ job. According to his father’s beta, he was there to cook, lean and poop out babies. He wanted to shove the hare he hunted up the man’s ass and tell him to poop it out like a baby, but instead told him to fuck off and burnt his food instead.
Bruce let out a chuckle, shaking his head, knowing that Tony would without a doubt. The pair packed up the equipment for the evening and hung up their lab coats. Bruce glanced over to Tony as he was leaving the lab and grabbed the omega’s lab coat. He managed to get Tony to wear it all day and was going to “accidentally” bring it home instead of his own. At least this wasn’t something that belonged to Tony and could be replaced. Joining the omega out in the hall, he gave the omega a small smile before they headed towards the elevator.
Thank you once again to QueenE for your comments on every chapter and to everyone who has left kudos! It means a lot to me and I get very excited when it happens.
Science bros hanging out because their bromance is adorable!
“Tony.”
“It’s nice to meet you too, Steve. But please call me Pepper.” Pepper smiled before turning to Tony. “Want me to stay?”
Tony frowned before swallowing with a nod. “Um, they made weapons. Not just for humans, but ones capable of killing shifters too.”
“Yeah, and I just wanted to make sure it would work. I am a genius so it should, but I have my bad days.”
“Rumlow.” Steve stepped forward, ready to pounce on the alpha.
I also fixed the missing Steve wolf in book 1, it's different but I like it
“Want to get some ice cream?” Pepper asked as they pulled away.
“Why am I here?” Bruce asked, rubbing the back of his neck.
Tony was around seventeen weeks pregnant now and had a small bump and he was getting increasingly crankier each day. It was obvious that his parenting and omega instincts had kicked in, becoming very protective over Wanda and Pietro. They were only young and new to the shifter world, they needed help and Tony reused to allow those brutes to go anywhere near them. The HYDRA agents soon learnt not to push their luck with the small and angry omega.
Now that Tony had calmed down, he sniffed, taking in the scent of the alpha. Tony had never smelt an alpha like this before. His scent was soothing, calm, warm, and was almost like home… someone who could care and protect him; as an alpha should. The golden wolf rubbed his head against the omega’s, removing him from his thoughts as he began to lick the smaller wolf, starting at his muzzle and moving down to Tony’s injured leg, whining softly. In response to the whine, the omega rubbed against the alpha, showing that he was okay.
“Dammit. I owe Pepper 20 bucks.” Tony groaned.
“Yeah, I don’t start yet so my room will be free.” Stephen nodded. “What do you need so desperately?”
“I really don’t want to.”
“He’s coming to ours, Stevie. We’re having a sleepover!” The archer leaned forward in his seat, grinning wide.
“Plans?” Sam’s eyebrow rose as he looked at the omega.
“Steve.”
“Do you know what state he’s in?” Pepper asked.
“Okay, but Steve, you know that-”
“Hey Coulson, we just -oh I didn’t realise you had company.” The intruding male standing at the door looked surprised upon spotting Tony in the room. Subtly sniffing the air, Tony could tell the brunette was a delta wolf.
Dr Strange let out a sigh, giving in. “We didn’t have any appointments free today, but he seemed desperate. I managed to fit him in before I had my first patient, but it didn’t go on record.” He paused. “Tony is pregnant. And while he-”
“Are you ready?” Tony asked, turning to the feline shifter who nodded in response. Tony passed him one of the walkie-talkies that they had managed to sneak off some of the guards. They really were dumb. Tony had managed to change the frequencies on them so the HYDRA agents wouldn’t be able to pick up on their conversations. Tony sat on the floor, waiting for the signal so Pietro could call for ‘help’ from the guards outside, luring them into their trap.
“I want to, Bruce. I do. I’m excited but I’m just overthinking everything.” Tony sighed, looking at the delta.
“I was super drunk after a frat party and I have a bit of a thing for being naked when I get really drunk and it was one of those times. There I was, stumbling down this hallway buck ass nude with only a cowboy hat and shades on, it had been a cowboy and Indians themed party, a joint in one hand and a traffic cone dragging behind me in the other. I was singing ‘Save a Horse’ at the top of my lungs at 5 am, well I say singing, more like screeching slurred words, the lyrics all mixed together but you could make it out. I had tried to pick up the cone so I could sing into it, but it was heavy and how drunk and high I was it was never going to happen.” The alpha was laughing hard, and Tony was trying his hardest not to laugh too so he could continue the story.
Steve locked eyes on Tony for the first time in months, the omega struggling in the tight grip the alpha had on him. He was malnourished, his cheekbones more defined than before. There was a large gash on his forehead, no longer bleeding but with dried blood down the side of his face and he had a black eye too.
“Damn you really don’t want anyone going near him, do you Steve?” Clint laughed as Tony took a seat.
“Loki has given his turn to Tony, so he chooses. That’s what we’re watching Sam.” Steve spoke up. “You had your turn two days ago.”
“You made this and you’re an omega?” Peter gasped, running over to Tony. “That’s so cool. Only Alpha’s are allowed to make things in my pack.” Peter huffed with a pout. “It’s not fair, I want to build awesome stuff like this too.”
Tony was suddenly filled with guilt. He lashed out on Steve too much and made the alpha feel guilty. Tony was a terrible omega and mate.
“It’s fine Bruce, you can stay there.” Steve sat down on one of the chairs he brought in, pout still there.
The pair finished fixing up Steve’s dish of spaghetti carbonara, putting it into one large serving dish so that everyone could share. Steve also grabbed a basket of sliced bread that he had cut earlier. The bread was from a local bakery in the city and was the best one, maybe he was biased because he adored the owners and refused to go anywhere else. He passed the basket along with a butter tray from the fridge to the omega, smiling softly before grabbing the main dish.
“You’re being courted?” The blonde alpha asked, looking at Tony dead in the eyes.
“Peter, slow down!” Steve laughed, chasing after the boy.
“Can you still remember your ABC's?” Pepper asked.
“Steve tried to come into the bathroom while I was having a shit, Pep.”
“I think so too.” Steve grinned, leaning over to kiss Tony’s cheek.
“We’ll find him, Steve.” Sam patted the blonde’s shoulder. “And kill every bastard responsible.” Steve let out a small laugh.
“Yeah, to help look after us all.” Tony grinned. “J, make sure the bots don’t get into trouble please.” The omega watched as they flew off upstairs.
“I love him Bucky.”
“You don’t need to do anything, doll,” Steve replied as he helped Clint put everyone’s food out on plates. Natasha sorted out the side orders and Bruce and Thor went back into the kitchen. Sam passed Tony a tray and Bucky gave him his cutlery and Loki passed him his plate of food.
Tony managed to glance around Steve’s shoulder, thankful for the tall stools in his lab, spotting the rest of the pack at the door, watching closely. Bruce and Natasha were standing at the door, Tony could make out Clint and Bucky peering through the gaps between them. The sandblasted glass along the side showed a shadow as someone lent against it. Tony suspected Thor due to the size of the shadow.
Clint Barton: Delta Wolf
“I wouldn’t mind if you come back for dinner or something too... It would be nice.” The blonde gave a shy smile before going back inside to get his car keys.
Fur colour: Golden/Blonde (solid)
Steve swears that he’s going to kill Clint one day.
“Agent Coulson said this was for us, right? Tony designed and made this for us. So we have to think like Tony.” Sam nudges Clint. “Try a nickname.”
“Oh, well, isn’t that lovely?”
“I just, my previous pack, their business wasn’t seen as ethical to all. At first, I didn’t take notice or care, I had a job to do so I did it. But then I realised what was going on and refused to go along with it anymore, I was lucky I wasn’t kicked out and the alpha at the time respected my wishes. He let me do other projects. Once he died the alpha who replaced him didn’t like it so much.” Tony shrugged, looking away from Steve. “They needed my ideas, my skills to get things done at the rate they used to. I could make things ten times better in half the time compared to ten of them put together.”
“I’ll let them know. I’m sure Fury will be happy to allow you some time off for family matters, especially as you caught Strucker.”
“Actually, I didn’t go to work today. I decided to give myself the day off.” Tony explained, shooting over a glare at Bruce who snorted. “I kept myself busy though.”
Laughter was heard from outside, Steve moving to the window so he could look out, Bucky coming to stand at his side. The rest of the pack was in the garden, laughing at Clint who had been pinned down on the ground my Natasha. The blonde turned to his second in command, who looked back and gave a shrug as he took a bite out of his sandwich. Steve walked out of the kitchen and out the back door, Bucky trailing behind. The blonde went up to Thor who was watching as Clint walked away from the redhead.
“Yeah, I figured that one out.” Tony sighed. “Hey, what if you let me in?”
Tony smiled, taking the breakfast tray from Steve. “You didn’t have to do this.”
“But the difference is, you’re not Orlando Bloom.”
“I wasn’t efficient enough for them. Not when they already had trained hunters. We didn’t hunt much as we were a city pack. So, it wasn’t a necessity.”
Tony and Bruce looked at one another before going into the kitchen. Loki and Thor were arguing over the menu at who gets to look at it first, Clint was too busy laughing at them and Sam looked so fed up with the brothers.
“He listens to me.” Bucky huffed, frowning.
Clint let out a groan of annoyance, his head falling back onto Natasha’s knees. It wasn’t the first time that they had been called on an emergency mission during movie night, but it still irritated him each time. Bucky turned off the TV whilst the other left, deciding to leave the snacks out. Hopefully, they would return home by tomorrow and sort it out then.
Bucky pushed the door open, walking into the bedroom. Bruce was sat up on top of the bed, reading glasses on as he read a book, the lamp beside him being the only light source in the room as the curtains were drawn shut. Thor was fast asleep, arms wrapped around the delta’s middle, head resting on Bruce’s chest.
“Tony!” The omega stirred upon hearing his name, eyes fluttering open as he lifted his head from his desk. A piece of paper stuck to his cheek briefly before gravity took over and it dropped down with the other pieces of his work.
Tony Stark: Omega Wolf
“Um, yeah, sure.” Bucky shrugged, sitting up on the counter. “What’s it about?”
“I took a few pictures if you’d like me to print one for you?” Stephen asked, wiping off the gel. “You’ll have to come back and get regular check-ups by a midwife.”
“Can I?” Tony asked, reaching out a hand. Clint nodded in response, Tony smiling before running a hand through the fur on the archer’s head gently. It was softer than he thought, softer than Steve’s too and slightly thicker.
“Nothing!” The omega turned around, facing Bruce, his hands behind his back to which Bruce raised a sceptical brow. “Hi, I’m Tony. Kinda new here.” The male, Tony, said holding out a hand in which Bruce took and shook gently.
“Clint, you’re not the alpha,” Natasha replied to the delta who had begun to walk into the woods.
“When are you going to tell him?”
“I’m searching SHIELD’s database for anything that could point out HYRDA’s bases. JARVIS is amazing.”
“Tony. Tony… Tony.” The omega looked up from the joint in his hand to the person calling his name.
Tony followed the male, who went and sat down with a group of others, who were also all omegas too. Tony grinned and sat down too. The only other shifters he had smelt at this party so far had been mainly deltas, betas and alphas with some humans in the mix too.
“I ran a scan to detect any changes with you and your hormone levels have increased. Mood swings are very common in pregnancy due to this change in hormones. I believe that is what you are experiencing.”
“Bullshit. Bruce blows things up with me, Clint has the best pranks, Bucky tells me about all of your embarrassing stories, Natasha-”
The beta nodded, still confused and not sure what was going to happen. He had an idea, but he didn’t think it was possible. Tony looked away as the beta stripped, holding his breath as Bucky shifted into his wolf form, praying that his invention would work.
“Right, yeah. Your pack, I forgot.” Tony’s happy dancing stopped, a frown forming. “You head home, I’ll just go back to my room and annoy JARVIS.”
“No, wait, Pepper.”
Steve only shook his head in reply, opening up the container that had a range of fruits in it before offering it to Tony.
“What have you been doing?” Steve asked as the omega pulled him inside.
Bruce was stunned. “What is that? How did you get that?”
Tony’s shirt and jeans had been thrown on the floor along with his shoes, but he still wore the alpha’s jumper. He’d taken it off to put it back on again. The brunette sat on the bed, and looked up at Steve, holding out a sweater pawed hand for the blonde.
“So there were a couple-” Rhodey gave Tony a look. “Some.” Another. “Okay, a lot of times where I would make regrettable decisions.”
While his eyesight was the best on the team, better than the alphas’, his hearing lacked a lot. His hearing was that of a normal human, which was a serious disadvantage for a wolf shifter.
“Steve.” Tony poked the blonde’s cheek. “Steve.”
“It’s okay, Steve. I understand.” The delta smiled small at his alpha. “I’m going to go wash up, so you don’t have to worry about the smell anymore.”
Tony was pretty sure he fell asleep because when his eyed opened, he was in Steve’s arms as the alpha walked them into his room and over towards the bed. The omega let out a soft, happy hum as he was lowered to the bed, eyes now looking up at the alpha’s blue ones. Even though it was dark in the room, a shifter’s eyesight was much better than a human’s, allowing the two wolves to see each other.
“What movie did you choose, Thor?” Steve asked, looking over at the lion shifter.
Tony was a mess. It had been two days since they had tried to escape. Since Fire was murdered. He hadn’t seen the two humans since and needed to make sure they were okay.
Steve paused, confused, before following Tony’s gaze, seeing Wanda and Pietro. “Well, having pups would mean that extra help would be beneficial.”
“Not a fan of the outfit, huh? Same. White drains me so much I might as well be in a hole in the ground.” Fire said. Tony let out a laugh.
Bruce hadn’t meant to miss dinner tonight but he, along with Tony, was so close to completing the project that they had to stay a little later, which paid off in the end. It was another project that was out of his mind and he could focus on others. After having his food reheated, he joined the pack in the living room. Most of them were already sprawled out across the room, Thor and Natasha on one couch and Sam on the other. Loki was sitting on the armchair reading a book and Clint had opted for the floor, a bowl of popcorn between his legs. There were a variety of snacks and drinks on the coffee table, but Clint always claimed a bowl of popcorn to himself. The only ones missing were Steve and Bucky. He sat down between Nat and Thor on the couch, looking up at the screen which had Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl ready to play.
“So, he wasn’t running away.” Just as Steve thought.
“Oh, and Mr Stark, I suggest not being late for any future meetings.” The agent called as Tony began to walk away.
Vampire!Tony Werewolf!Steve enemies to lovers
“I think it’s the babies.” Tony faked being hurt, curling up and gripping at his stomach.
“And putting oneself in danger is meant to be mine.”
I just want to give a final thank you to everyone reading this book. It means so much to me. I love reading the comments I get and seeing every time my hits and kudos go up.
The two guards in the room left in a hurry, leaving the two omegas alone.
“Save it. I’m going to continue looking around this place.” Steve left the room, continuing down the hallway.
“Liar,” Natasha said as she walked passed, slapping the back of the delta’s head.
“Stark is missing?” Dr Strange sounded a little surprised. “I didn’t think he would run away.”
“Hi! I’m Sam, this is James, but everyone calls him Bucky because he thinks he’s cool.” Steve poked his head out of the kitchen to watch as Sam and Bucky walked over to the omega who was currently being hugged by Clint.
“It won’t.” Tony let out a soft sigh, holding Steve close. The omega was glad that they could actually talk about this instead of arguing. They were getting somewhere and seeing one another’s views.
“Pepper? Oh my god, Pepper!” Tony ran down the hall to the ginger-haired omega, completely forgetting about the other female. But this was more important. Pepper was his lifelong friend and he hadn’t seen her in two years. “What are you doing here?” He leant in and hugged her. The two were never really overly affectionate with one another, which was uncommon for omegas. They had more like a teasing brother-sister relationship. Pepper could take Tony’s shit and give it back just as much. But the pair hadn’t seen one another in so long, a hug just felt right.
Dr Strange: Alpha Wolf
Tony went straight back to his work, Tammi’s words still stuck in his mind as he thought about the blue-eyed blonde that had him so hooked. Time flew by and by the time Tony had stopped to get a drink, it was already dark out.
“Cap, Coulson wants to speak to you,” Natasha spoke down the comms.
“No, you’re hoping to stay at his.”
Bruce started to laugh and retreated his hands as Tony scowled, eyes narrowing. The two wolves stared at one another as Bruce’s laughing subsided, a few beats of silence happened before both were laughing.
“It’s been ages since I had anything close to a pack pile up… Even this.” Tony’s admitted. “My old pack wouldn’t let me join in if we went across the country by foot instead of car or jet. I didn’t get to come on most business trips, especially ones on foot.” Tony never opened up about his pack and it made the delta feel incredibly sad and also guilty. He was opening up whilst drunk and felt like he shouldn’t be told this until the omega was in the right state of mind. “This is nice.” The lower-ranking wolf had shuffled closer to Bruce, an arm draped over his waist. Bruce ran a hand through the brunette’s soft hair, getting a small hum as a response.
“We should get a doctor.” Guard two said to number one.
“Maybe we should cut the sparing short today?” Thor offered, looking over at the lockers before looking at the alpha wolf.
“Shit, Steve.” The omega gasped, detaching his lips from the blonde’s before kissing the man’s jaw repeatedly.
“Just left my boxes by the door, I’ll take them to whatever room I’m being put in after dinner I guess,” Tony replied.
“I missed you too.” Tony’s eyes closed as he wrapped his arms around the blonde.
“I can walk you back? Or we could get a taxi?” Steve offered.
Ever since they found Tony’s wallet, they didn’t have to worry about money. The omega was loaded. Steve felt bad about buying things with the omega’s money, but sleeping in the Quinjet wasn’t great for weeks on end and they had to buy food, find places to shower etc. Tony wouldn’t mind. He would want the pack to be looking after themselves. They needed to be in good condition to rescue him.
Tony recognised one of the female omegas in the circle, most-likely they worked at SHIELD, but he was too drunk to know for sure.
The small village was wrecked, buildings and cars on fire and if they weren’t on fire they were destroyed. But that wasn’t the worst bit. It was the bodies, some human some shifted form lying on the streets.
“I know you will.” The bald man grinned. “7 pm you will be escorted to dinner. I look forward to speaking with you properly.”
“Not on the adventure?”
“What are you guys doing?” Rhodey spoke up, making Tony roll his eyes.
Clint’s eyebrows rose, a smirk spreading across his face. Steve was prepared for an onslaught; no doubt Thor had told them what the two wolves were doing just before but in his own way and blowing it out of proportion even if the lion didn’t mean to.
“JARVIS? We’re heading back to the workshop.” Tony spoke, activating the AI as he walked downstairs to the main floor. “Can you bring up Project C.9 for me for when I get there?”
Tony blushed fiercely at the comment.
“If you’ve got everything, then we’re just waiting on Steve,” Natasha replied as Clint sat in the pilot seat.
Tony cursed, rubbing at his eyes beneath his glasses.
When they were pups, and Pepper was big enough, her and Tony were rarely seen apart. The two were best of friends and did almost everything together. It was even worse when Rhodey got thrown into the mix, as he was older and did “cooler older wolf things” with the two of them. Tony was always more of the child between them, despite being three years older, and got them into a lot of trouble growing up. Most omegas would get left behind once they matured if they weren’t the alpha’s child or mate, but Howard kept Pepper around as an assistant. She was much smarter than her job, and should have been doing more in Howard’s business, but was unable to move up because of her omega status. But he was still thankful she was around until Stane came along that is.
“Right. Yes. That’s good. But why don’t you let me help you? Are you hurt?”
“Path to where?”
“He’s come to rescue us!” Clint cheered, jumping on Steve. The delta was lucky that the blonde had caught him just in time, as he was a bit (very) preoccupied looking at the omega.
Tony’s ears flattened and out of defensive instinct spoke up, “that’s not nice.”
Steve turned around to face Tony, tail wagging as the omega walked over to him. Tony wagged his tail as Steve licked his head and the rest of the pack gathered around him, sniffing him. The brunette kept to Steve’s side, even after everyone eventually retreated from greeting him.
“I doubt it. I was born this way. And not all male omegas are able to carry children. Some male deltas are too, but it’s even fewer than omegas.”
Tony held up his bottle and shook it a little. “This is why you bring a bottle.”
Tony’s tail wagged, looking up at Steve.
“Shower is free.” Tony hummed, walking out of the en-suite wrapped up in a pastel blue towel after he had finished washing and had shaved. Tony checked his phone as Steve went to shower. The omega got dressed in a suit because suits were always a winner, and sneakers to keep it casual. Tony slid on his glasses and greeted JARVIS as he pushed back his hair. He had left his styling products in the bathroom and would have to wait until Steve was finished until he could get them, so, for now, his hair was slightly damp and if he didn’t blow-dry it, it would soon go extra fluffy and no amount of product could contain that.
3) Angel/Devil guide AU: (I don't know if this has been done before but I was watching the emperor's new groove and thought of an idea) Everyone has a devil and an angel but you can only see your own. Tony only has a devil (but he isn't evil) and Steve only has an angel, but they meet and discover they can see one another's guides. Kinda like a soulmate thingy.
“I want to keep an eye on you.” Steve continued.
“Peggy. I’m sorry. I’m glad I ran into you actually. Well, I didn’t plan to literally run into you, but I needed to find you.” The brunette gave Steve a look. “Right, rambling. Tony is missing. We’re going to find him and was wondering if we could get some help from SHIELD.”
“We probably won’t see him at all today.” Natasha looked up to Tony before going back to her book. “He probably had his morning run and has gone up to his room again.” Tony’s eyebrows furrowed as he tried to think why Steve would be hiding. “It’s the anniversary of the day he and Bucky lost their previous pack.”
“I um, need an ultrasound. I think I’m pregnant and I just need to know.” Tony said as they walked into a room, ‘Dr S. Strange’ written on the door.
“Um, hello… Can I help you?” Bruce asked tentatively, having never seen the male before.
, he kept telling himself.
“Yet you insist on coming here frequently just to talk. There is this thing called texting you know.”
It was a familiar practice for both of them, Tony having regular panic attacks growing up and Pepper being the one to help and support him. Once Tony’s breathing seemed to be back on course, Pepper ran a hand through Tony’s hair, humming gently and ignoring the sweat.
I also keep forgetting to reply to comments, but I do read them and by the time I remember to reply I feel like it's too late. But I appreciate all the love I get on my story and any feedback too.
“You guys are so mean to me.” Tony huffed, coming out of hiding behind the napkin to look at the three of them who were laughing.
“No, gosh not in that way. Just come over to HQ. Bring some clothes for me too. Room 2.04. You’ll have to get Agent Hill, Carter or Coulson to let you in.” Bruce cut off, still whispering.
“I’m going to take Tony home in a taxi, then I’ll be back,” Steve said as he shuffled out of the booth.
“Mr Stark, I am Agent Coulson. I work for SHIELD.” The agent began, walking over to the desk and sitting down on the chair behind it. “You were brought here because a shifter pack under our tabs found you alone in the forest. We sent some of our Agents out to retrieve you, it’s dangerous for an omega wolf to be out alone.”
“Bruce?” Bucky called, stepping into the room. The living space was empty, so the beta headed towards the bedroom as Clint went to the kitchen. “Bruce?”
“Tony?” Pepper knocked on the door gently. “Can I come in?”
“Where’s Tyler?” The brunette shouted over the music, looking around for the blonde.
“Clint, I don’t-”
“And how exactly do you know me?” Tony asked, playing with his watch. His father had always wanted to hide his son’s omega status to all those that didn’t know him. Though he never admitted it, Tony knew his father was ashamed to have an omega son. A powerful alpha, like his father who deserved better. Obadiah reminded him that every day.
It probably wasn’t Tony’s greatest idea to drink coffee this late, but his sleep schedule had always been so fucked anyway. He’d find something to do for now. At least from tomorrow night, he would be able to have access to the labs whenever he wanted. After sending a text to Bruce, he slid his phone back into his pocket and took out his guest key card as he approached his room door and scanned it.
“Thank you, Sam.” Tony smiled, gratefully taking the mug before pressing play again.
“Just another day.” Clint gasped.
“Well, I’m not most omegas.”
“When did you program JARVIS here? How? What?” Bruce asked, hands on either side of Tony’s face to get the omega to look at him.
“Of course, Sir,” JARVIS replied. “Everything will be ready for you when you arrive.”
The alpha wolf he’d come across in the woods had crossed into his path again, last night as SHIELD and Tony couldn’t stop thinking about him. They would more than likely see each other again and as much as the omega wanted it to happen, he was nervous about what the alpha would think. He was nervous last night, he probably thought the same as Tony, that their paths would never cross again after the affectionate night and the omega ditching him. Tony frowned.
“Loki.” Steve groaned.
“Nice to see you again Brock.” Tony heard Steve greet the person who had been knocking at their door.
“I want them with me,” Tony growled at Strucker who was watching him from behind the glass.
“You know it’s not like that Clint. She’s just a friend.” The alpha wolf sighed, shaking his head. Peggy had been his friend for a long time along with his second in command, Bucky. She helped the alpha and beta move on from their previous pack and, through SHIELD, helped them form a new one.
“Oh, so we’re shifting,” Tony stated as Steve was pawing at his leg. “Alright, alright. Turn around then. No looking.”
"Thanks, Brucie. Love you too."
“I missed you so much, Tony.”
Tony had completely ignored their short time in the woods. It was just a little error, Steve hadn’t meant it to be anything more than him accepting Tony not to be a threat. Or, that’s what the omega was telling himself to stop getting his hopes up. He hadn’t told anyone about it and didn’t plan to, hoping the alpha had done and would do the same too.
“I don’t want to leave this place.”
“Why don’t we go out to eat? If there’s no more shopping I don’t mind spending more time together. There’s a restaurant bar that I’ve been dying to try out since it opened a few months back but never had the chance. Plus, Bruce says you know how to have a good time.” Clint grinned, looking around at the others in the room.
“He’s a vital member of our pack and we’d do anything to save him.”
“I can understand that more. But I can’t be followed around forever, Steve. It’s not practical. I have work to do and you guys have missions to go out on.”
Enter someone new and super cute
“I don’t want to spook him out anymore but if it comes to it, we’ll have to.” Pepper sighed, trying again. “Do you want to talk like this?” Still, no response, causing the redhead’s eyes to close as her head rested against the door. “Go see if they have anything to open the door. I’ll keep trying.” Pepper gave Bruce a nervous smile as he nodded before leaving.
“I traded with Loki for his dessert.” Clint began to laugh.
“This is Hawkeye. I am in position.” Clint spoke over the comms.
“I’ll think about it.”
The omega walked back into his room and grabbed his phone. He looked down at Steve’s number, nervous. Of course, Steve hadn’t texted him either, so it was a possibility that he wasn’t interested and was just being polite to Tony.
“Where are the rest?”
“You look like shit."
The female omega had a bandage wrapped around her hand and was wearing baggy, faded white, almost grey, shirt and pants. Tony looked down at his matching outfit, scowling.
“Steve. I’m fine, I was just getting a snack.”
“Thank you.” Bruce smiled before hanging up, dropping his phone beside him, thankful that Tony was still asleep.
“I told you it’s okay. I had fun though, plus I didn’t put the pieces together until that moment.” Tony referred to the part of the night where Tyler had almost kissed him. “I hope we can still be friends though?”
The pack started the movie once again, only getting in another ten minutes before their alpha walked into the room, pausing the movie.
“Fuck I should tell Steve I found you,” Clint muttered.
“If you find any, I’ll be happy to try them on.” Tony smiled at her.
“They’re not the only humans to be kidnapped.” Fire continued.
“Now do you see what I mean? I’ve got to see what I’m working with here.” Tony jokes a little, but Bruce could tell that there was some seriousness to it. Tony could be a valuable asset to SHIELD and even to Bruce himself, so if letting him have a look around a lab was all it took to see if the other wolf would get on board then the beta was willing to let him in.
“Clint!”
“Only you would forget an allergy and think it’s someone’s favourite.”
“Thanks for that,” Tony called, pointing to the bed as he walked towards the delta on the couch.
“And then we’re killed?”
“And I said no.” Tony looked over at Steve for a second, the alpha seemed to be having a battle with himself. But Tony knew, that Steve knew, that he could handle his own battles.
“Want to talk?” Tony asked tentatively. Steve shook his head no. “Want to cuddle?” The omega tried again.
“I gave Clint explosive arrows for his birthday and he’s testing them out in the garden.”
Tony locked the tablet and looked up at the wolf, properly this time, taking in his appearance. The alpha had a scowl, clearly not liking the way Tony acted. He just a bit smaller than Steve and had dark hair, dark eyes and some stubble.
“You wouldn’t have done it on purpose Steve. I’m okay. Promise. I have you and the pack now, some asshole making comments isn’t going to derail me.”
Brock Rumlow was a SHIELD agent and an alpha of a pack. Tony wasn’t playing too much attention because he didn’t care. All he knew was that he was coming over to talk with Steve about strategies. A few members of their packs were joining up on a mission and wanted to work out a plan for a raid. They had meant to do it a couple of weeks ago, but Tony’s heat happened, and the pack had been pretty busy since.
“TMI but yeah that’s obsessive. Yes, alphas are naturally protective but that’s taking it too far. He’s never been like that before, right?”
The bartender nodded and made the drinks for the group, Tyler handing over the cash. As the three grabbed their drinks. Tony shimmied back up on the stool again and took a sip his scotch. Tyler and Rhodey were talking about their packs, Tony just about listening in.
The two deltas caught up with the omega, walking through the halls. The deltas had no idea where they were going, but Tony seemed to know.
“I didn’t put it together, Rhodey comes from a war pack so I thought there was just an ally between them, with the weapons and all. I’m sorry about your father Tony. I didn’t know the man even had a son… But you’re not him.”
“You snooze you lose, Cap.” Clint grinned. Tony let out a laugh, smiling at the two deltas either side of him. Bruce went to stand, but Steve held out a hand.
“I still hate you all.” Steve sighed, straightening up as he placed the bowls onto the counter.
“I’m glad I brought you or else I’d be third-wheeling these guys,” Tony whispered. “Look at them.” Both wolves lowered their menus, so their eyes were just above, looking at Rhodey and Pepper, she was laughing at something that Rhodey had said, neither of them paying any attention to Tony and Steve. “See” Tony huffed as they raised their menus once more.
I hope you enjoy the chapter everyone.
The alpha wanted to curse at the beta, tell him to leave the two of them alone. Nevertheless, he had a job to do and so while he wanted to get to know the wolf standing in front of him, the alpha had to leave.
Fur colour: Creamy-gold (solid)
The blonde stumbled back, pulling on Tony before letting go of his wrist and letting the omega fall to the floor. He was between the two wolves, both growling at one another as he looked up at them. Taking a shaky breath, the omega crawled away from them unnoticed just as another beta, a brunette male, joined the alpha’s side, squaring up to Clint.
