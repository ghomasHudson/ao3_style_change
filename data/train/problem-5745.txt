“You with us, Rogers?” Tony was snapping his fingers in front of Steve’s face, making the blonde take a surprised step back.
“You were gone all weekend and I was-I was-was just left here! All alone!” the boy whimpered, crossing his arms stubbornly.
“Goodnight, Steve,” Tony said abruptly, turning towards the driver’s door and sliding into his car without another word.
The extent of his cooking skills were throwing things into a big pot and only the simplest of baking. Like a ‘prepackaged cookie dough put onto a baking sheet that still ended up a little too crispy around the edges’ kind of baking. In fact, he was making his famous Totally-Not-Tollhouse cookies right now! Just to sweeten the deal after Peter had such a rough day.
“I shouldn’t overstay my welcome,” Steve, not one to miss a hint, plastered on a polite smile that Tony assumed he used on the most difficult of parents. After all, the genius would know, since that’s the very same smile that greeted him the first couple of times he met the artist. “Thanks for allowing me into your home.”
It’s not that Natalie had given him any reason to distrust her, in fact it was quite the opposite. From the start, she was all smiles and red curls and glorious takedowns that he’ll never let Happy live down. She was smart, strong, and damn good at her job, but there was something about her that the genius couldn’t quite place.
“An’ then Mr. Steve is Captain America. It’s ‘cause when I asked him why Jarvis called him Captain Rogers, he said that he used to fight for the american army,” Peter explained, pointing to the tall muscular hero standing behind the smaller Spiderman.
The boy started to climb his father’s legs, scrambling to get to his lap. He put up a fuss when Tony tried to help him, so all the man could do was sit there and smile as Peter tried to use his dress shirt sleeve and the edge of the counter to try and leverage himself up to where he wanted to be. When he finally succeeded, he grabbed Tony’s face between two tiny hands and tugged him down to press their foreheads together.
The blonde’s face was bright red as he tugged the american flag towel he had been using as a cape from around his shoulders.
“Then I’ll pick you up from aftercare, capiche?” Tony patted him on the back, trying to stretch his neck back and look at his kid’s face.
“You’re silly, daddy,” Peter giggled, before sticking his face into Steve’s shoulder to hide from the cool evening breeze that rushed in through the doors to the parking lot.
“Mr. Stark, I…” As Tony looked up at Steve, the teacher could see the dark circles under his eyes. Which, altogether, wasn’t all that surprising. He was a genuine billionaire businessman, after all. But paired with the tense way his shoulders were bunched up and the fact he wasn’t bothering with the effort of putting on a knowing smirk like he did for the press, it made him look worn down. Almost like a kicked puppy or something equally as pathetic.
The trip to visit the west coast headquarters for Stark Industries had gone better than the genius had expected it to. It was most likely due to the updated staff Pepper had hired after ridding the department of the last of Stane’s underlings. Even after the man was put into jail for his attempt at killing Tony, they continued to lurk in dark corners of the company and create issues. Like rats. Maybe not even rats, like ants. They were bothersome, but couldn’t create enough mayhem to result in anything more than a couple of easily fixed messes.
“Well it’s not, and it’s so exclusive that none of these schmucks are allowed on the team except for us,” the genius grinned, before holding his arms out wide. “Now give me a hug before I head out.”
“I know you couldn’t tell me about your job back before I had any part in it,” Steve argued, he was nothing if not stubborn. “But now that we just so happen to be working for the same ‘boss,’ I feel like it’s only right that you clue me in.”
For a brief second, Steve almost missed the emotionally inept Bucky from his childhood. The brute who used to tease him for feeling anything besides hunger or casual indifference.
After a lot of trouble to prove that Steve could, in fact, handle himself just fine, he finally got to join the 107th Regiment and his childhood friend.
“Is it Nat? I can get you a new babysitter if you don’t like her,” Tony reached over to put an arm around his son’s shoulder but was surprised when he immediately shoved him away.
Now though, walking down the path Steve knows was Natasha’s last, Steve finally lets himself grieve. He lets the crippling sadness overcome him, lets himself mourn the first and most true friend he had made in the 21
Steve cups Tony’s face and pulls him close. “I love you, too, Tony.” He whispers against his lips. “I always have.”
“What the fuck??” Natasha says the next morning, walking into the kitchen where Steve and Rogers are both making pancakes.
Steve looks surprised by Peter’s words, his eyes almost clouded with anger. “Why would you say that?” he asks, his voice deceptively calm.
hope you guys enjoyed this chapter!! nothing much happened in it, unfortunately, but hopefully we'll see a bit more action in the next one.
Thor was going with the Guardians, exploring space with a freedom he was never afforded the luxury of.
Steve finds Steve – Rogers, as he has been mentally calling his alternate version in his head – leaning against the balcony of the tower.
“You banished me to a fate worse than death,” Red Skull says, as if he didn’t hear Steve. “I am going to enjoy watching your pain.”
“You don’t have to,” he says. “You can stay here – we’ll figure something out about the other Steve. You don’t have to go.”
“Morgan – she’s so little. Make sure she remembers her old man, okay? Make sure she’s always happy. And Peter – he’s seen so much. He’s seen so many people leave him. Be there for him, okay? Look after him, make sure he doesn’t get himself killed.”
He almost tells Tony, every day, walks into the room prepared to tell him the truth and leaving the choice up to him, of what he wants to do. But then Tony looks up from whatever it is he is working on or comes up to Steve and presses a kiss on his cheek, and Steve falters. He has wanted this for so long, and he has it now. He can have it now. And so, he keeps his mouth shut, always telling himself that it’s not the right time. Tony had a nightmare today, saw the wormhole swallowing him whole and Steve can’t tell him about the future now, can he? Of a future where he gets lost in space, how he gets saved at the nick of time, but almost doesn’t – he doesn’t tell him, because he is scared. He mentions SHIELD sending him information about HYDRA bases, about how they suspect that HYDRA have been experimenting on human volunteers, and Steve almost tells him about the twins, about the visions he will be made to see in a couple years of time that will come through – he nearly tells him, but he doesn’t, because he is ashamed. He talks about needing to go to Malibu on a small business trip, and Steve almost tells him about the Mandarin, about the home he is going to lose soon. But he doesn’t, because he is a coward.
Peter knows he isn’t the only person who lost something. Everyone was grieving for someone they lost, because Tony Stark was important to all these people. And yet, he was filled with a bitter feeling that had embedded deep into his chest because
Steve doesn’t know how long he stands there, his eyes glassy with unshed tears. He sees this Tony, a little bruised from the encounter they had with Loki not too long ago, but Tony – alive. He drinks in the image of him, tries to erase the picture of Tony that has been etched into his brain in the last few weeks – the image of a bruised Tony, a burnt Tony, a dead Tony. Instead, he tries replacing it with this Tony – happy, and whole. He raises his hand up, pressing his palm over the glass, his large arms covering Tony’s face. He pretends it is his face Steve is holding, tries to imagine l the rough stubble of his beard, or the softness of his skin, the fluttering of his eyelashes. Steve remembers how they all felt, and yet he wishes he didn’t. He knew how the sensation he felt when Tony’s eyelashes tickled his skin, knew because he had bent over his lifeless form and closed his eyes after he had slept away from the abyss Steve would never get him back from.
Tony looks at him for a long time. “All right,” he says, clapping his hands. “Let’s blow this popsicle stand. I need to speak with Cap here, alone.”
Tony presses his forehead against Steve’s. For a minute, they just sit there, breathing in each other’s scent. Steve runs his hand over Tony’s face, tries to memorise every contour, how every breath he takes sounds.
Steve had been absent in all this, still standing by the lake in which they had finally let Tony go. Peter had looked up a few times, had seen Steve staring at him with a look in his eyes he couldn’t decipher. He hadn’t approached him though, not until everyone was long gone.
Past-Steve is still... somewhere. He tours America for a bit, fights as Captain America for a bit, and then eventually dies during a mission gone wrong. Our Steve retires as Captain America, so the world doesn't randomly see doubles.
The team are all huddled together in their meeting room, strategizing ways in which they could catch the Winter Soldier out. Steve stays quiet during the discussion, speaking only when spoken to. The team all know the truth, know how little Steve can truly discuss with them, and for the most part they adhere to the rules Steve and Tony had set out for them, all those months ago.
It isn’t that he hasn’t made his peace with it, because he has. Waking up in the future had been daunting, had filled him up with such incredible pain that sometimes, in the early days, Steve could scarcely make himself get up in the morning, nor could he make himself go to sleep at night.
Steve laughs, taking Tony’s hands in his own and leading them to the dance floor. They both hold onto each other, swaying to the slow rhythm of the music, Tony leaning his head on Steve’s shoulder.
It was then that Peter looks at him, really looks at him. It’s like seeing a reflection, because he can see the same brokenness in Steve’s eyes too. The brokenness of a man who has lost everything.
the voice comes and oh god, Steve knows that voice. Knows it so well, because he has been hearing it in his head every day for five years.
On the day Tony had passed, Steve woke up in the morning and just knew. Tony did too, because he had kissed Steve’s forehead and whispered: “it’s okay.”
Tony looks sad as he answers: “I know. I wish I wasn’t, I wish I could have stayed with you, with all of you – but I can’t. So you’ll have to do it for me. Promise me you’ll do it for me.”
Steve hadn’t felt that kind of love in years – decades – not since Peggy, at least. He had thought Peggy was it for him, and the day he had carried her casket on his shoulders was the day he accepted his fate. Steve Rogers was doomed to live a lifetime without feeling love. He thought he had one shot, and he had lost it.
He is a coward, because he has spent so long wishing, hoping, pining – and he has all he wants now. He isn’t strong enough to let go of it.
Somewhere, behind Tony a kid shouts “Mr Stark!” The voice is both achingly familiar and unfamiliar to Peter, because this kid has a bounce Peter hasn’t been able to muster in a while. A smile spreads across Tony’s face when he hears the voice, warm and indulgent, and that is the last image Peter is left with as the hologram feed cuts.
It’s the last memory he has of Steve before now, because not one day later, Steve has aged 50 years and looking happier than Peter ever remembers him seeing.
Tony continues looking at him, searching his eyes for an answer. Steve tries his best to school his face, try not to let the grief show. But Tony must have seen something, because he smiles, a genuine smile that lit up his face – a smile that Steve thought he would never get to see again. “I could eat,” he says.
Slowly he stalked forward, chest heaving, and Tony was left frozen in place as he watched, chin lifting to bare his neck without conscious thought. Blood pounded in his ears as it rushed south, and Tony in that moment was absolutely terrified, but also incredibly turned on as wet slick began creeping down his thigh. It was so wrong, the flutter he felt as Rogers picked him up in his arms, the swoop in his stomach as the alpha buried his face, stained with blood, in the cradle of Tony’s neck.
“Keep it in your pants Rumlow. That little bitch hacked into the Pentagon on a dare. Higher ups care more about what’s in his head than what’s between his legs, so don’t get any ideas.” Garret looked Rumlow in the eye with a clear order, and for a moment it seemed like the two alphas might come to blows. Dominance displays like this weren’t uncommon between alphas, but it wasn’t supposed to happen within the chain of command.
“Alright come on.” Again with that bewildered look. “I’m hungry, and entirely unnecessary or not, you just punched out my ex. Therefore you get pancakes. The kind with blueberries.” Tony insisted, his scent screaming
“Where were you last night, I missed you…” The he slurred into Tony’s ear, clearly intoxicated. It wasn’t a new look on Tiberius Stone, but it was a lot less endearing when Tony also wasn’t plastered.
I've also been seeing a lot of chatter and art lately around Regency Era Stony, which got some plot bunnies stirring full of some of my favorite trashy romance novel tropes. I've got some ideas jotted down for a fic, so if that's also something you'd be interested in reading, let me know. I hope you all enjoy!
Falling, cold, so cold. He must have lost time because when his eyes looked up and focused again, Tony was at the counter paying the check. Tony. The target. The mission. An asset, like him, extract and recruit. Encourage him to cooperate.
“But why do I have to wear this mom, it’s so tight!” Tony’s little doppelganger grimaced as he pulled on the offending tie. The getup made him look like the poster child for Easter brunch in the Hamptons, and the fabric clung to his body in a way Tony distinctly remembered as being hot and uncomfortable.
“Cryptic. Care to elaborate, or are we just gonna sit here and play guess who?” Tony bit out impatiently, arms crossed as he took in how many men were around the table. Five that he could detect for sure, but there could be more sprinkled throughout the bar like Rumlow had been.
“Yeah, because that would go over real well with the old man.” Tony replied flatly. “Do you remember what happened when I packed off to MIT?” In fairness to Howard, it was as much skipping out on that engagement to Justin Hammer he’s arranged as Tony’s unseemly foray into higher education, but all the same. Lots of screaming, very dramatic.
“T-thank, but I didn’t need your help okay, I was handling it!” Tony managed to get out, his voice steadying out by the end. He pushed himself off the ground to put a little distance between himself and the alphas, as frankly the position was making him feel a little cornered.
“Aw J, you know me so well.” Tony grinned. Whatever pain he felt in the process, it would be totally worth it to hear Jarvis snark again.
“Jarvis!” He called out the second he was through the door, sliding the dead bolt firmly in place. “Open a line, try Aunt Peggy.” Tony ordered, even as his stomach clenched in rising dread. It was ten o’clock on a Saturday night. Who the hell was going to be in the office to pick up?  The phone rang out as Tony scrambled about the lab for potential weapons. Pipe wrench, welding iron, copper coil, Tony tried to take a quick inventory as DUM-E came whirling off his charging station with a fire extinguisher.
“That should be illegal.” Came a smoky rumble on his left. Tony’s eyes roamed over the tall alpha leaning against the bar, their shoulders not quite touching, just close enough into his space for Tony to guess at his intent. Large, and undeniably attractive with his dark stubble and mischievous eyes, Tony suspected it was a move that often worked for him.
“I don’t keep those kinds of records agent. Anything of consequence on my private server is encrypted to the gills and incomplete. Even if you could find someone to hack through, the data is rigged to purge without my biometric code. Safety first.” Tony smiled tightly without humor. It wasn’t a
“The process should take another twelve hours Sir. With that time line, we should be ready to begin treatments by 1500 hours tomorrow.” The nurse suggested softly as she adjusted the thin sheet that hid the asset’s modesty. Pierce took a moment to examine it more closely, hand reaching out to brush a stray blond lock from a perfectly chiseled cheekbone before venturing lower to rip away the sheet. The nurse’s nostrils flared with a nervous glance at Pierce, clearly uncomfortable, but said nothing as he discarded the fabric on the floor. The asset was not a person, it would not do to treat it as such--even in small gestures meant to spare them any discomfort. A weapon had no need of such things. The nurse might need to be replaced, a beta would be better.
“So I’ve heard. Your guy here was pretty light on the specifics.” Rumlow was looming behind him, but Tony didn’t need to see the smirk to hear it in the huff he let out.
back at the omega! Where did an alpha in this situation get off on pouting like Tony had just stolen his puppy!
Tony’s mind reeled as he took in the newcomer, their eyes meeting briefly before he turned to square off against Ty. He was big, with the most insanely unfair hip to shoulder ratio Tony had ever seen. Everything about him screamed tightly coiled power, he was just so…
“Get. Off.” A voice growled behind Ty, the only warning Tony had before the alpha was ripped bodily off of him and tossed what looked like a good fifteen feet away.
“Wrong answer.” Tony grunted, as disappointed as he was angry. Curling himself into as much of a ball as possible, Tony covered his ears and squeezing his eyes shut. “J, light it up!” The effect of the flash bomb was immediate, dropping them both to the ground in a tangled heap. Tony scrambled up, still a little wobbly from the grenade’s effects on his balance, but he’d shielded himself better than Rogers. He didn’t have time to look at the downed alpha, dashing out the demolished doorway, and down the halls as quickly as he could.
“Yeah, I took a look at it, but the weight distribution is all off. You’ll never get that thing to launch properly with that configuration. I’d say you need to change the casing alloy at least. Tungsten's too brittle, but you might try mixing in magnesium.” Tony suggested offhandedly. “And getting someone competent in for your R&D if that’s the best they’re giving you.”
“Shut up! He ain’t here, and you ain’t gonna tell him.” Rumlow growled. “Go stand watch if you’re getting squeamish on me Sitwell.” Whatever Sitwell might have replied though was cut off with a wet squelch, a knife suddenly sticking out of his throat. The man collapsed to the ground in a convulsing heap making soft gurgling noises as his hand fingered at the knife.
lie, and Tony got the distinct feeling these ass clowns couldn’t tell the difference between a dummy data cache anyway. Come hell or high water, no one, SHIELD or not, was getting their hands on his work unless he damn well wanted them to.
“Why don’t we just grab him already then? It’s not like he’s gonna be much of a challenge.” One of the Alphas on the strike team piped up. Rumlow, the asset’s memory supplied. The asset wasn’t sure he liked Rumlow, which was odd. Weapons did not have feelings or preferences. He was sure he’d been told that before.
“Okay.” Tony lied after a beat. “Just let me grab my coat.” He said quietly, eyes carefully downcast in a submissive gesture and pumping out fear scent that had every alpha at the table sitting up a little bit taller. “Thank you for protecting me.” Tony said with a watery smile to really sell it as he slipped out of his seat toward the coat rack. He hadn’t bought himself much of a head start, but it would have to do. Coat in hand, Tony didn’t break stride as he slipped out the emergency exit, sprinting the second he hit the street.
DUM-E’s recovery time ended up being better than Tony’s. His stupidly brave little bot rolled right up to the intruder, dousing him with CO2. Those sharp eyes finally left Tony to look at the offending bot, and for a moment, Tony watched in horror as the alpha reached his hand out toward the bot. Oh God, was he about to rip DUM-E apart with his bare hands?! “Leave him alone!” Tony shouted before he could think it through, chucking whatever he could get his hands on from the prep table at the alpha trying to attack his bot.
“That’ my dad. Call me Tony or you’re gonna make me feel old.” Nothing on the man’s face changed at Tony’s jibe, so he dropped the pleasantness and jumped straight to the point. “What exactly is this about?”
“Target’s movements are consistent. He’s currently located in Zone B.” The asset replied as instructed, tone clinical and detached. He has tailed the target for most of the morning before watching him disappear inside one of the brick buildings owned by the school. The target would likely remain there for several more hours given his observations, and that was acceptable. The asset had already scouted the building, and it was secure. No one would threaten the target before extraction.
“…Okay.” The alpha replied, posture suddenly uncertain now that the threat was gone. He made no move forward, and his eyes shifted about, almost as if he were nervous Tony might walk over and try to touch
“But I don’t want to have a coming out party. Can’t we just stay home?” Tony turned to the camera, pleading to his only ally in the room. The first birthday after he’d presented as omega had been the hardest to adjust to. Before then, he’d been Howard’s heir, a beta like his father they’d all assumed. Tony had never shown any of the early signals or tendencies those stupid pamphlets at school proclaimed with their patronizing illustrated guides. Tony most certainly had
“Mr. Stark.” The alpha clearly in charge here greeted as Tony was led to a seat he didn’t choose, so much as was encouraged to take.
“Relax boss, they’ll put his brain back through the blender before you know it.” Rumlow said easily. The anticipation in his eyes as he looked at the asset unmistakable.
“Soooo my good samaritan, you got a name? What’s your deal?” Tony’s gaze shifted to something more calculating as he leaned back against the booth in a move designed to look casual. His eyes swept over the asset like he were a puzzle Tony could work out. Normally those looks made the asset tense, they were always followed by prodding, pain, or the chair. From Tony though, something base and primal unfurled in his belly, drinking in the attention like a languid cat in the afternoon sun.
“Think that was a real slick move huh? Taking off like that.” A smoky voice husked into Tony’s ear as the alpha’s body shifted on top of Tony’s in a manner that was most definitely
Obie had speculated, insisting emphatically the guy wasn’t on Howard’s payroll. It was a chilling thought, but it didn't really square either. What kind of stalker tries to flee when they had their victim practically cornered in a deserted alley? Weren’t they supposed to have delusional attachments? For god’s sake, Tony took the guy to dinner, he should be on some kind of drugged up honeymoon or skinned into a lampshade by now if that was this guy’s angle.
“Garret won’t like it.” The agent who’s called on the radio said nervously, looking around the dark street corner for sight of the van.
Alright, so he lied. Rhodey would forgive him, Tony thought morosely as he downed the shot of cheap whiskey that was tonight’s special. It burned with a god awful cinnamon aftertaste as it settled sour in his stomach, but anything was better than the flush of humiliation he felt just thinking about the fool he’d made of himself last night. It was stupid to make assumptions, Tony knew better, but damnit, usually he was right! What other reason was there for some quiet super-jacked alpha with an obvious military bearing to follow Tony around and take orders without even a peep of complaint? The idea just didn’t compute without money involved, and it wasn’t like the guy had denied the charge.
Some attempted non-con here, mostly for Rumlow's grabby hands, but there's a scene with some heavily implied threat as well. Also be aware there is more graphic violence this chapter, as you can guess how Steve will react to this. This chapter is exclusively from Tony's perspective (after some trial and error, I realized that was the only way to get this chapter to flow the way I wanted it to), so the next one will be from Steve's to compensate.
“Hey, what do you say we get out of here?” The alpha barreled forward, grabbing Tony’s wrist, thumb circling his pulse in a bid for his attention. “Find a quiet place we can talk?”
Tony’s ears were still ringing when he finally made it outside the lab building. Again, his options were few, but the apartment seemed too obvious. He took a left to head back toward the more populated part of town, hoping a crowd might at least give him some cover to figure out a better plan. Tony barely made it a block before suddenly being tackled into the pavement.
“Oh I have been waiting for this!” Rumlow’s boot pinned Tony in place on the ground as the omega tried to belly crawl away. Tony couldn’t see Rumlow’s face, but the telling clink of a belt buckle being undone was enough to send Tony spinning into a panic, frantically trying to buck free of the hold. Rumlow just dropped more pressure on his foot until Tony’s lungs felt like they were being crushed.
“We tried playing nice with you, now we do things my way.” Rumlow smiled as Tony gasped like a fish on a boat deck. Eventually the alpha let go with a chuckle, Tony coughed, sputtering desperately for air. “Not such a haughty little bitch now are you.”
“Come, we need to leave.” Sarcasm, along with bubble space, it appeared was also not a thing where this guy came from, as he nodded along with Tony as if his rant was perfectly insightful. The Alpha then started pulling Tony with him across the lab, careful to steer them away from the broken glass.
, Tony thought at first glance. Undoubtedly the eyes of a killer, and utterly unlike the ones Tony remembered belonging to the man he’d shared pancakes with the night before.
“The asset’s been secured on base when you’re ready. Currently still in the process of revival, but we’ve got a heartbeat steady, and the equipment is ready.” The awe in the agent’s voice was clear. After nearly forty years frozen in the ice, no one had truly expected such strong life signs to remain, serum induced alpha physique or not.
“Yes, I gathered that.” Tony replied dryly. “They said the same thing about you, so color me confused here.” Tony pointed out curtly at the alpha as he…did he just…no! He
“Who touched you?” Rogers asked, taking the same arm in a much gentler grasp. His voice was deceptively quiet, but there was an undercurrent there, something raw and barely caged that promised the sweet taste of violence to whomever dared touch what was his. Primal, Tony thought briefly, something that couldn’t be reasoned with.
“You’re in danger. I’m going to protect you.” The alpha rumbled as he hovered into Tony’s personal space. His body language wasn’t threatening exactly, but the sudden closeness left Tony feeling lightheaded. The protective pheromones coming off this guy could drop a fucking horse, and Tony had to fight against his own biology as his muscles tried to relax into jelly.
“C’mon, it was a mistake, I’m sorry! Don’t be like that. You know we’re not exclusive, no labels no fuss right?!” Ty jogged ahead again, this time crowding Tony up against the brick wall of the building behind them.
“Not when we’re there together asshole!” Tony hissed back, trying to get around Ty’s arms as they moved to cage him against the wall. “Knock it off Ty, I’m not in the mood for your bullshit tonight!” Drunk or not, Ty was a lot stronger than he was. In another context, Tony might find that a turn on, but right now it just pissed him off as he tried pushing the willfully oblivious alpha away without success.
“If you’re not coming home to visit, at least tell me you’re spending the holiday with someone. Your mother worries. You still seeing that--?”
“Your safety.” The alpha replied dryly, flashing his badge without missing a beat. Agent Garret Tony noted before shifting his gaze back to the older alpha.
just spent a sizable chunk of his morning passed out in some guy’s bathroom, so his position was a little undercut. Party hardy Bacardi and all that...
It was strangely comforting, and Tony felt the tension in his shoulders ease just a bit. At least they did until the alpha turned on his heel suddenly and started to walk away.
“Hah, I knew it! You work for my dad.” Tony snapped his fingers, sitting back in satisfaction with his assumption. “That getup you’re in, military cut, tight lipped and brooding. Are you on loan from Homeland Security or SHIELD?” Tony guessed with narrowed eyes.
They ended up leaving Ty inside a laundromat which, all things considered, Tony felt was fair. They hadn’t had to walk too far to find it, but that was all the time needed for the adrenaline to ware off and his stomach to roar back to life with the reminder he hadn’t eaten any of what Rhodey would call ‘real food’ in the better part of two days. Apparently vodka was not part of a balanced breakfast. If Tony was feeling a little shaky in that moment, obviously that was why.
A small petty part of Tony thought with vicious satisfaction, even as he began to discard the notion. For starters, being ditched at a diner was a pretty clear signal that tall, blonde, and beefy was not interested, and even Tony wasn’t enough of an asshole to lose the guy his job just to spite Howard. Some perfectly innocent flirting on the other hand...Tony mused thinking of blue eyes and an adorably wrinkled brow, no harm in that. The silence on the other end however, began to stretch on uncomfortably.
...the voice was familiar, but trying to focus on it was like grasping at smoke. It was a startling thought, but the asset agreed.
“Absence confirmed. Extraction window should open by 1700 hours.” The Asset complied, tossing down the photographs from the last 12 hour watch. Surveillance was key for the mission’s success.
This was perhaps what his ex-therapist would call a prime example of his masochistic tendencies, but Tony had spent the better part of his adult life ignoring her little kernels of wisdom, so he wasn’t about to start doing anything about it now. In his defense, this was the same woman who’d told him his manic depressive episodes were being caused by a hormone imbalance from his heat suppressants. Apparently the key to mental health was knotted bliss and babies. Who knew? Apparently the Federation of United Citizens for Keeping Integrated Natural Genders, for which she was a card carrying member. Tony could almost forgive them if they were more self-aware about their acronym.
“Uh no, you break it you buy it pal, you can’t just leave him here like this!” Tony insisted, arms crossed in his best imitation of his father’s “And that’s final!” voice.
punched Tony’s movements as he finished tightening the last loose bolt on Dum-E’s arm after his very convincing imitation of Humpty Dumpty. “Seriously, why do I bother with you? You can’t tell the difference between a drill press and a drill bit? It’s literally attached to the table!” Dum-E hand whirled down in apology, trying to pick up Tony’s mug off the desk to hold out as an oil spiked olive branch. Tony took it with a sigh of resignation, long since given up on getting Dum-E to tell the difference between creamer and motor oil.
go that long without a keeper you know.” Tony shot back as they rounded the corner. Neither man noticed the blank stared blue eyed alpha that followed on their tail a few moment later.
“Yeah, work on that for now J. Add all compatible files to your servers.” Tony said clearing his throat and wiping sweaty palms on his pant legs. No matter how much it hurt hearing Jarvis’s voice again, Tony craved it like a hit of whatever colorful pills Ty used to pass around at one of his house parties. Not that he’d be going to anymore of those in the near future, he thought bitterly. Tony’s vices these days veered strictly toward sex an alcohol, but occasionally he’d still feel this itch to be out of his head for a while in a way even tequila couldn’t replicate. Ty used to be Tony’s go to guy for that particular triple threat, but seeing as how things ended last night, Tony was more likely to punch Ty than fuck him. Probably.
“Is this about my father?” Tony asked carefully, picking up another photo of Rogers off the table that had a better angle of his face. The eyes were visible in this one.
“Oh I can think of a few ways to encourage him.” Rumlow leered at the other alpha. “I bet he’d beg for it too, with those doe eyes and pouty lips he’s always showing off. God just look at him, his ass is just asking for in those jeans.” He picked up the photo of the target sprawled out on a tiled floor. The position left his shirt rucked up to his midriff, and had looked distinctly uncomfortable for his neck. The asset’s orders were not to be seen, but as the target was clearly unconscious, he had not noticed as the asset lifted and rearranged him in the tub. That left his neck properly supported. The asset also locked the door before climbing back out the window. It would leave the target more secure before extraction. Rumlow made a noise deep in the back of his throat, something rumbling and vaguely possessive. No, the asset did not like Rumlow, he thought, a sharp hot flash sparking in his chest, violent in nature.
“Good. Then we have time to move.” Garret abruptly cut off his train of thought, standing from his seat with a tense look at the alphas around him. They obviously didn’t want to linger now that they’d found Tony.
“Nope.” Tony cut off quickly, in no mood to talk to Obie about the trash fire that was his love life
“Prep the work station J. Don’t worry buddy, we’ll have you talking with your big boy words before we know it. Try to make sure the first one’s daddy.” Tony added with a cheeky smirk as he swiveled in the chair. It was exciting to think they were this close to including interactive audio to the interface. It would make communicating when he was elbows deep in a project that much easier, but it would also be nice to hear another voice answering back. More than one classmate may have pointed out his seeming tendency to talk to himself while working. Which was ridiculous of course, crazy people did that. Tony was rich, so at worst talking to AIs made him eccentric. Still, it would probably seem less awkward if they were talking back.
“I just don’t like thinking of you stuck here alone. Tell me at least you’re not going to go on a binger while I’m gone? I can’t come pick you up from Virginia.” Rhodey said pointedly. Tony normally would have taken more offense to the insinuation, but he
“That’s okay sweetheart, I like the chase.” Agent Rumlow purred, pushing Tony’s cheek into the concrete with one hand, and gathered Tony’s hands in a painful grip with his other. Stunned as he was, Tony still recognized the distinctive click of the handcuffs that had been locked in place, and tried not to hurl as he was abruptly hauled off the ground. “Target secured, bring the van around.” One of the other agents called in on some kind of radio. Not good. Three of them was bad enough, but if they got him in that van, his odds of escaping went down drastically. Tony tried to jerk free from Rumlow’s hold, but just got a hand gripped around his throat for the trouble.
“You said you were handling it.” The alpha replied, almost wary as he stopped his retreat midstride. He didn’t turn completely back to Tony, as if ready to bolt at any moment, and for some reason it kind of pissed Tony off. Who the hell was this guy, swooping in and out like he was goddamn Batman or something?!
“Well good…that’s obviously well thought out.” Garret hesitated, eyes clearly scrutinizing. “What I need to know from you now though, is if he’s tried to contact you yet.”
Normally, he might find drinking alone in a dark office a bit maudlin, but tonight Alexander Pierce was willing to make an exception. Fate was a funny thing, he couldn’t help but muse thoughtfully to the scotch in his hand, ice clinking against the side as he raised the glass to his lips for a deep swallow. It burned down his throat in a smooth slide the way only good alcohol really can. It was pure, cleansing the stale taste of failure left behind after years of dead ends and dashed hopes. So many missed opportunities, years of resources lost to a fruitless search that they could never quite quit. Howard Stark alone had vested a neigh fortune into the venture, hands always coming away empty; save for the bottle of course.The potential reward was just too high, no matter how many times he watched his hopes dashed among the waves of the Atlantic. All that money, man power, and cutting edge Starktech useless...and then one fishing boat gets blown off course. It was sheer luck one of their agents was the one to pick up the chatter, otherwise there was no telling whose hands their prize might have fallen into. Order, security, a real chance for world peace. For the first time in years, Pierce felt like he’d glimpsed sight of a path toward that shining city on a hill.
expressed a nurturing nesting instinct toward animals and small children. The only warning he got was a brief wave of nausea. Then he spent a month bed ridden with the tale tell stomach cramps that signaled his body was going through the final stages of puberty as his body shifted to its omega physique. After that things were just different, or people treated him like
“He’s an assassin, possibly KGB affiliated. Most of his hits have been in Europe so far, but he was spotted in town two days ago. The chatter is, his next target is you.” Garret started, throwing down a few grainy photographs that show a familiar head of blond hair. Tony couldn’t see his eyes in the first picture, but the build definitely looked like Rogers. The gun in his hand was a new addition though, along with the lethal looking intent Tony could read coiled in that powerful frame. Tony’s mind flashed back to the last show of power he’s seen those muscles display, the warm heat coiling low in his own body as he’d watched. A shiver racked down Tony’s spine at the memory. Garret must have misinterpreted it for fear, since he barreled ahead.  “We’ve got men of the ground hunting for him now though, we’ll keep you safe.”
“Don’t play games Tony, I know who you are. Always down for a good time right?” Ty smirked, grabbing a handful of Tony’s ass as he dragged him against the Alpha’s body, and slotting his mouth over Tony’s. The kiss lasted about as long as it took Tony’s teeth to get a good grip and sink into Ty’s invading tongue.
“Sure, you promise, it’s settled then! I’ll just file you under ‘not a KGB assassin trying to kill me’. Glad we cleared that up.” Tony intoned sarcastically. It’s not like the guy hadn’t just busted into his lab with inhuman strength, and apparently been stalking him for days. But hey, he
“Nope.” Tony lied smoothly, not even sure why he did it. “I feel like I’d remember somebody sporting resting murder face.” He added grimly. He pointedly didn’t ask why a supposed assassin would try to talk to him before the whole murder bit. If this guy was as good as they were saying, Tony should never see him coming. Something else was going on here.
“Yeah J, let’s see what survived through the digitization process.” Tony agreed as he watched the screen fill up with a truly horrendous looking floral three tier cake that read
The room they kept it in was cold, both in temperature and in its clinical utilitarianism. That was fine, their new asset would have no need of such comforts. Pierce strode to the bed the asset was laid out on, pulling a chart out of the hands of an omega nurse who was fussing with his IV and breathing tube. The medical equipment they had the asset hooked up to was designed for a controlled assent, it shouldn’t regain any semblance on consciousness until they were ready for it. Just in case though, the heavily reinforced shackles eliminated any illusion that they were in a hospital, and would keep the asset succure.
“No Obie, I’m sure. There’s no reason for you to fly in from Malibu. You’re on vacation.” Tony insisted to the phone DUM-E was holding up above his work station. He was arm deep in the guts of a ‘69 Firebird engine he was cannibalizing for parts when the call came in, and Tony shot his over excited bot a pointed glare to try and get him to hold the receiver still.
“Jarvis, cut feed!” Tony choked out abruptly, and the screen went black. Tony wished they hadn’t started with that one, but it had the least corrupted audio, and frankly there just weren’t many Stark family home videos that were unscripted enough for Jarvis to be in them. And wasn’t that just a farce. Jarvis had been the central core of their family, the axis that kept all the wheels in place and turning. The Starks could never have function without him; maybe that’s why they weren’t speaking now that he was gone.
“Lindsey.” Rhodey corrected patiently with that long suffering friend squint that just pinched around the eyes.
“I insist.” He replied flatly, tightening his grip as he flashed a badge. “For your own protection, you need to come with me.” SHIELD, Tony registered as he looked over the photo ID and familiar logo. Tony narrowed his eyes, but didn’t protest as the alpha, an Agent Rumlow according to his badge, led him to a secluded table in the back with several other alphas in dark clothes and doing a poor job of masking the scent of their tension.
His instincts cried, the air around him reeking with it, and Tony hated himself just a little bit for that weakness.
“That was years ago Tony. Besides, he was too much of a pup for you. Did you hear Hammer Industries dipped another ten points this month?” Obie purred conspiratorially. And this was why Uncle Obie was the best.
I've got this chapter about as good as I think it's going to get, so hopefully it's some semblance of decent. Steve in particular was kind of difficult the write, so any comments on your take with the characterization would be appreciated. Tony's dialogue is more entertaining to write, but there is a lot of conflicted internalized sexism he's processing that I'm not sure always comes off how I was intending. Regardless, I hope those who choose to read this enjoy. Thanks to everyone who left comments and kudos for the prologue! I love getting feedback, and it definitely motivated me to get this first chapter finished within a week. I hope everyone enjoys.
“I’ll pass.” The grip wasn’t strong, and Tony tried to pull it away to create some distance between them at the bar. “I’m busy tonight, maybe another time.” Tony added, softening the blow with a tone as close to regret as he could stomach. That part was important though, safer.
“So you’re just going to stay on campus for the entire holiday vacation...alone...moping.” Rhodey shot back, raising an unimpressed brow as they continued their trek back towards their apartment.
There is a scene this chapter with some attempted non-con. (Not between Steve and Tony) Originally, that was not how I'd planned for that scene to go down, but the muse has a mind of it's own.
“Shit!” Rumlow cursed, foot lifted from Tony once again. Tony didn’t see the other agent go down, so much as hear the bone crunching as he hit the wall beside him. The sounds of a scuffle raged around him as Tony tried to crawl out of the way. The snarls of the alpha brawl growing more feral until someone screamed. Tony twisted up to his knees in time to watch Rogers, hands bloody, pound Rumlow’s skull one, two, three times. Tony caught sight of Rumlow's battered mess of a face before Rogers dropping him like a sack of garbage. Blue eyes searched out Tony once again. This time they reminded him of the photograph in the bar.
“He loved you,” Steve says as a way of greeting, and Peter grits his teeth in response. “You know that, don’t you?”
He didn’t understand why Mr Stark would look at him like that, but it was then that he realised that he looks older. Not physically, though there are physical changes Peter doesn’t remember seeing an hour (five years) ago. But there was something there, as if time hadn’t been kind to him.
He knows he is being bratty and selfish, and yet he can’t make himself care. Because he looks into the eyes of all these people and he sees grief, but he knows it’s not the same grief that is in his eyes.
“What the fuck,” Nat says again. Steve thinks distantly that this is the only time in all these years Steve has seen Nat look so shocked.
Steve smiles, his eyes going glassy with memories of a cherished life – of brown eyes with golden flecks and brown curls and a knowing smile.
Steve places a hand on his shoulder. “Yeah,” he says. “He’s alive. You’ll be given a mission in DC soon. You’ll find him then.”
Tony is there, alive and whole, his AC/DC t-shirt smeared with grease and motor oil, an expanse of empty mugs of coffee scattered on the table in front of him, a clear proof of the countless hours he has probably spent in the lab. Steve can tell he has music playing, because Tony’s hips are swaying rhythmically, his head bobbing to a fast tune as he stares at the screen in front of him. His face is lit up in blue – the blue screen, the blue reactor, and he looks absolutely ethereal.
The next stop is Vormir for the soul stone, leaving 1970 for last. As he makes the rickety path to the edge of the cliff, he feels a pain settle in his bones – one that he has become acutely familiar with in the last couple of years in particular.
) held her head high even as tears had fallen freely down her face. He had stayed over that first night, everyone holding vigil outside the room where his body was being kept, and he had heard her sobs, a sound he wishes he could forget.
In the moments it takes for him to be thrust back to the past, he says one last goodbye and takes off.
anyways!! there will be more parts to this series, hopefully soon! Steve still has a lot to work through.
“The thing is, kid, I know what happens. I didn’t all this time, but we defeated Thanos just last week. Steve and I are retiring now. I’m building him a farm in front of a lake and everything – it’s all very American Dream.” Tony laughs, and Peter aches at the sound. “Point is, I got lucky here, in this timeline. I got the love of my life, I got this amazing kid that quite literally fell into my life. And I know I lost some things too. But I don’t regret the life I am living now, and I certainly don’t regret the life I led in your time. Steve tells me I died to save the universe, but importantly, to save
scrawled on the bottom visible to Steve’s even from a distance, an ever-present reminder. Tony’s eyes follow his movement. He looks at Steve again, questions evident in his eyes.
Tony will tell him later that he had no plans of doing it that day – he was going to wait until their anniversary, in front of the Louvre during a romantic trip to Paris. But they were at a gala, one of the many Stark Industries ones Tony always managed to guilt Steve into attending, and a song had started playing.
Steve can see the exact moment Tony understands, because he closes his eyes and lets out a deep breath, leaning into Steve’s touch. Steve continues, “I wasn’t going to stay, I just came to take a look at you, just see you once before I had to go back to my time. But then you looked up, and you smiled at me and I wasn’t strong enough to walk away. I couldn’t.”
“I did, Pete,” he says. He wraps his arms around Peter, and there is a tingling sense of familiarity here that Peter doesn’t quite understand.
And Steve was happy, he really was. He found people to love in the form of his rag-tag group of superheroes, he found a purpose in the form of the Avengers, he found a home in the big ugly building in the middle of Manhattan that soon became the warm feeling of a summer day to him.
“Natasha,” Steve breathes out, running to her and pulling her into a hug. She remains Steve against his body, but he doesn’t care – not in this moment.
The device inside looks almost like a remote in the shape of a Spiderman mask. Peter looks at him confused.
“Hey,” Tony says. “I’m not going to leave you over this. I understand why you did it, and I understand it’s not his fault either. I was angry at first, when you told me. I wanted to find him and strange him with my bare hands. But I know now that it’s not his fault.”
“Please stay,” he whispers again, “it doesn’t have to end in the same way it did last time, in your time. Whatever it is, we can defeat it. Together.”
It was then that Peter realised that he had lost five years of his life. But it was okay, it felt okay, because Mr Stark was holding him, whispering things against his ear that Peter couldn’t really make out.
They’re the only ones in the diner, and he can feel Tony relaxed against his body. Tony doesn’t hold him the way Peggy did, her head on his chest. No, Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s shoulders, protesting with a
“What are you…? You’re returning the stones aren’t you?” he asks, confused. “The soul stone? Why am I here, then?”
And so, he pretends, balances several boxes of pizza on one hand and walks into Tony’s office where Pepper (his future
It was his heart that had given up, at an impressive age of 86. Tony and Steve had moved to a small town on the outskirts of New York by now, in a small house by a lake. Steve spent his days painting on the small balcony Tony had built him – Tony had built the entire house by hand – the lake glistening in the sunlight in the background. Tony had his own workshop in the corner of the garden too, because hell would have to break loose before Tony Stark stopped inventing. They hosted Sunday lunch every week, their whole makeshift family making sure to attend, come hell or high water. Natasha and Bucky – a pair that Steve hadn’t ever thought of, but one that seemed to fit almost as if made for each other – would drive up with Bruce and Thor, another unlikely pair. Peter, now the CEO of Stark Industries, would keep his schedule clear on Sundays no matter what, him and his family driving up early morning. Peter and Tony would lock themselves in Tony’s lab almost as soon as Peter’s car would pull up, and Michelle and Steve would shake their heads fondly at their eccentric husbands before pulling the kids along to the playroom. Sometimes, Clint’s kids would drive up too, now with families of their own. They would eat the lunch Steve got better at cooking with time, and together they would reminisce about the past.
“Steve, I can guess what happens in the future,” he looks up to meet Steve’s eyes. “I die, don’t I?”
He takes a deep breath. “He was brainwashed by HYDRA. Kept in some kind of cryogenic freezer for 70 years. At this point, he probably doesn’t even remember who he is.”
“I got a call from him a couple of weeks ago. Got JARVIS to scan you afterwards. Turns out you carry a time stamp. From nearly 12 years in the future.”
Steve has been here before, obviously, because this is Tony’s favourite diner. He knows the people who own it – an elderly couple who didn’t get phased neither by his fame nor his reputation. He waves at them as he walks in, Steve in tow, and slides into the corner booth Steve knows is his favourite.
Everyone had come to him, told him that they understand what he is going through. Peter nodded, accepted their hugs and their condolences. He nodded when Thor patted him on the back and told him he fought valiantly, that he should be proud of Tony. He said nothing when Happy and May and Pepper and Rhodey came over to him, told him that he isn’t alone in this. He smiled when Clint and Bruce and Scott all gave him soft smiles and promises of always being here for him, no matter what. He accepted Bucky and Sam’s apologies, and he accepted T’Challa and Carol and Quill’s sympathetic smiles. He thanked them for understanding, for being there – but all he wanted to do was tell them to
That’s not to say the anchor completely went. Some days, Steve woke up in the morning and thought he could smell Peggy’s perfume – that ridiculously fancy one she always managed to conjure up, even during the war. Sometimes, he would close his eyes and he would see Bucky’s laughing face, or Dum-Dum’s maniac laugh and at that moment all he would wish for is a chance to back.
Peter wishes he could say he was surprised when he sees Captain Rogers – 50 years older in the span of 5 seconds.
He sees hope in his counterpart’s eyes; in a way he doesn’t think he ever saw in himself. “Is he okay?” Rogers croaks out, his overwhelming emotions apparent.
He lets Peggy pull him into a hug, lets himself hold her too. He could have this, have her in his arms for the rest of his life.
He orders a cheeseburger – his favourite – and Steve asks for a milkshake, and then they sit in silence. Tony fidgets, and Steve can tell he is feeling awkward. It makes sense – the last time he was supposed to have seen Tony, they had parted civilly, but not as friends. Tony has questions, he knows, and Steve doesn’t know how to answer them. He doesn’t know what to say either, to be honest, because he is too busy trying to commit every angle of Tony’s face to his memory.
Steve smiles softly. "He isn't just any kid," Steve says. "He is a kid who is going to go on to meaning a lot to you, soon. That's all I can tell you, sweetheart. I already fractured time enough just by being here."
“You’re wrong,” Tony says. “There is no version of me that couldn’t love you, Steve Rogers.” He leans up to kiss him. “You’re my sure thing.”
Steve looks at Tony, and in that moment, he doesn’t understand how he could have ever thought he wasn’t in love with this man.
“I’ve got you, baby,” Tony whispers in his ear, rubbing soothing circles on his back. “I’ve got you.”
Tony shrugs. “Did you ever consider that the old Steve might call me at some point in the last couple of months?”
This Tony? Looking at this Tony, Peter understands what Steve meant by ‘alive’. Every part of him seems to be glowing – there are laugh lines Peter doesn’t remember his Tony ever having. And it’s more than that, too. He looks softer somehow, without the hard edge that had been carved into his Tony. And he looks younger, although his greying temples tell Peter he is pushing 50 at least. He is the man his Tony could have been, if the world had been nicer to him.
As Tony took his last breaths, he has turned to Steve with a cheeky smile. “Did we do it, then?” he rasped out.
“I don’t want to, sweetheart,” he says, “but there are people waiting for me over there, people who need me. People you told me to look after.” His eyes dart to the paper that is lying forgotten next to Tony, the small
Rhodey – he had stopped crying long ago, but he had this haunted look in his eyes, one that Peter was all too familiar with. Sometimes he would hear a sound, and his head would whip around expectantly. There would be a hint of a smile on his face, only for a split second. It would disappear as soon as he would realise that it’s not the person he has been waiting for.
Steve smiles, “I got to live my days with the love of my life,” he replies. “I’m grateful for that.”
“Hey Cap,” he said pleasantly, his voice warm and light, and Steve choked back a sob. “What are you doing here? Everything okay in D.C.?”
Tony leans forward, and Peter instinctively does too, his hand reaching up to touch the hologram image. His hand passes through, distorting the image.
That was the problem – Steve had a family there, and he has a family here, and he doesn’t want to leave either.
“His name is James Buchanan Barnes,” Steve says suddenly. Five pairs of eyes shot towards him. “He was, is, my best friend. He got fell off a train not long before I went down with the Valkyrie. I, well I thought he was dead, until I came across the Winter Soldier.”
“But I didn’t want him to!” Peter sobs out, jerking himself away from Steve. “I wanted him to live, here with his family – with his daughter! He didn’t just take away his own life, he took hers too! And he did it all for nothing.”
“In order to retrieve the soul stone,” Red Skull continued, “you must sacrifice the one you love. In order to return it,” Red Skull fixes his mocking eyes on Steve, “you must face the one you love.”
“But what about background checks and have you even met him really there’s a lot of real freaks out there and-”
The teacher opened his mouth to give a list of reasons, but looking into those wide brown eyes, he couldn’t bring a single one to mind.
“Get that shit-eating grin off your face before I take it off myself,” Tony groaned, shoving the rag back into his tool kit and shooting the mechanic the nastiest glare he could manage. “That’s it. You’ve lost arm privileges, hand it over.”
“Well, I hope the two of you can hang out soon,” Steve tried to keep up a smile, not wanting to let the kid to know just how little he cared for his father at the moment. What kind of dad didn’t let his son play with his friends outside of school? “What does your dad do?”
Tony stared down to the Stark Phone resting in his hand, squinted at his reflection in the screen that had gone black due to idling for so long. Pepper was at a conference, Rhodey busy with some important military business, like usual. He could call Natalie and be out of there in fifteen minutes tops...
“The day I allow you to turn my left arm into a hideous gold and red monstrosity is the day I die,” Bucky was giving Tony a cold look. “I’m surprised you didn’t just make it the way you wanted when you built the thing. You’re paying for it, after all.”
“I...guess you’re right, Peter,” Steve sighed, putting his hands on his hips and hanging his head in defeat. “I’ll lock this place up and meet you there.”
“As fun as this evening’s been, Rogers, I think it’s time for us to head back home,” The genius muttered, sliding out of the booth and gently tugging his sleepy kid along with him. “Methinks our superhero over here is tired after working hard all day to keep the city safe.”
“And that, my dear oblivious friend, leads us to an unrelated fourth point,” Natasha leaned in close. “Tony’s into you too. So, get off your high horse, and ask him out.”
Steve tripped over a bucket of paint brushes, sending them sprawling across the linoleum. His eyebrows shot into his hairline and he stared at the man in front of him incredulously. “I beg your pardon?”
“Here, why don’t you tell me more about Spiderman while we clean up the living room?” Tony offered, putting Peter down next to where the bare bones of the blanket fort stood remained.
“Yep, sure is. Why?” A hint of amusement crept into Sam’s voice. “You lonely? Why don’t you call up your handsome rich boyfriend, see if he can come pick you up?”
“I mean, yes? I don’t know!” Steve’s face was heating up and he desperately wished he could take back the entire last five minutes of their conversation. This was torture. “I’m sure it hardly constitutes as flirting. Just a couple of comments about how I look and-”
If Tony had asked him to babysit he wouldn’t have hesitated. The blonde adored Peter, but dinner just seemed too weird after only knowing them for such a short amount of time.
“Jarvis, I told you to tell me if something was wrong, why the hell didn’t you tell me anything was wrong?” Tony missed the way Natalie’s annoyance briefly rose to the surface at being completely ignored.
Pepper headed back towards the elevators, smiling over at the billionaire before the doors shut in front of her, taking her down to the lobby.
Clearly, he couldn’t have been more wrong. He just wished he’d have been able to foresee his son throwing a ginormous tantrum in front of the entire Rec Center staff so he could have prevented it, or at least been somewhat ready for it.
“She’s completely desensitized to my wily good looks, but a hunk like you? I bet people are just tripping over themselves to cheer you up,” Tony smirked, and just when did they get so close to each other?
Steve had to bite down on the urge to call out to him or tap on the window and stop him from leaving without talking this through further. Why did he even care? Technically this wasn’t his business. Him and Tony weren’t close, hell they weren’t even friends. So why was there a part of him that hated seeing the genius upset and driving off down the road?
Steve glanced up at the ceiling nervously, before heading back into the living room where Peter was watching cartoons.
It wasn’t as if he minded in the slightest, it sounded like Peter needed someone to just listen to him and the teacher was happy to do that.
This might have been the first time in Steve’s, admittedly short, career as an art teacher that he’s dreaded work.
“Oh, uh-yeah, he did. I don’t think I’ll be coming, though. I’m sorry,” Steve tried to explain it as gently as possible, keeping a comforting smile on his face. The last thing he wanted to do was ruin the boy’s good day.
“Oh, come on, Petey-Pop! What’s wrong?” Tony squatted down and reached out to rub Peter’s back. Immediately, the boy crumbled, turning to face him with watery eyes.
The genius was silent for a minute, which was an immense victory when it came to him and his unceasing chatter. In the time he took to formulate a response, he’d moved from the fingers, back up to the tangle of wires and neuro-transmitters that connected the arm to Bucky’s shoulder.
“Are you always so weirdly invested in your friend’s romantic life?” Tony drawled as he worked on putting the open panel to the metal arm securely back in place. “‘Cause I gotta say, it’s kind of unsettling.”
“Pepper, it’s fine. I’ve got all of this under control. Go home and get some rest before you pop a blood vessel,” the billionaire tossed back the rest of his drink and dropped the glass into the sink.
“Yes, you are. That’s exactly what you’re supposed to do,” Natasha said crossly. “And you can’t have more than one best friend. That defeats the purpose of a best friend.”
“I think that sounds exactly like something you’d do, sir,” JARVIS intoned before bringing the elevator up to the penthouse.
“Still?” Bucky leaned back in his chair. “Doesn’t the whole ‘single dad’ thing put stuff into perspective for you? Like, being a parent all by yourself is hard enough on your own, but add in the fact that you’re Tony fuckin’ Stark and own one of the biggest businesses in the world...I’m not saying it excuses his actions, but it makes sense why he can’t pick up little what’s-his-face everyday.”
"Five-fuckin'-fifty??? Why the hell didn't you get me up sooner!" He called out as he jammed his feet into a pair of chucks and burst out of his bed room.
“Peter’s a sweet boy, it’s no trouble at all,” Rogers looked like he had something more he wanted to stay, but after a beat of awkward silence, it was obvious he wasn’t going to talk any time soon.
He owned one of the largest, most successful companies worldwide and his last name was practically household. On top of his booming business, he was a certified know-it-all. Smart, wealthy, and had ladies practically knocking down the doors to the Stark Tower just to get a chance to speak with him, he truly had it all.
Living in the spotlife his entire life, the genius knew what would happen after this article was published. There’d be even more of the press stalking the recreation center, and subsequently, Steve.
“Know is a strong word. I’ve heard of him, he was Rogers’ right hand man in all things on and off of the field.”
Any of the serious, honest atmosphere that had built up in the last couple of minutes that remained was shattered like old glass. There was an icy glare coming from behind the billionaire’s shades that he still wore even in the dim parking lot.
By 5:30, like usual, it was just Ned and Peter left in the room. Steve was trying in vain to pick up an overturned bowl of sequins that he would most likely be cleaning out of the rug for the rest of the school year when he heard a knock on the door frame.
After Tony had maneuvered Peter out of the carseat and up to his bedroom, he had flopped back onto the couch. It took all of his willpower to not hightail it to the closest open bar just in order to avoid having to face the fact that this whole situation was his fault, and his fault alone.
Hell, his friend Natasha even offered to put in a good word for him at the place she works at. She'd insisted that, while she couldn't tell him anything about the job, she knew he'd be a perfect fit and it'd keep him busy while giving him adequate breaks. But Steve was nothing if not stubborn, and informed her that while she may have what it takes to be some kind of super spy secret agent? He definitely didn’t.
The friday afternoon after that monday evening, as Steve got on his motorcycle and prepared to follow Tony’s sports car to the tower, he received a text message from Bucky.
“Yes, yeah, of course, my dear James,” the billionaire mumbled, already scrolling through the holo-screen in front of him and not paying any attention to the phone still squished between his shoulder and ear.
In the six and a half years that Tony had been raising Peter, never had he seen a tantrum like that before. At least, never one in public anyways.
“That’s right! We’re doing watercolor paints today and since Valentine's Day is coming up soon, I want you to paint something that you love more than anything else,” Maybe it was an easy out but he had to come up with almost five projects a week, more for the kids who finished everything at lightning speed. “I’ll be walking around the room for anybody that needs the help.”
The art teacher’s bitch face returned full force, this time accompanied by him folding arms across his chest which, in all honesty, distracted the billionaire entirely from the task at hand. “There’s no late fee, but if there were? It’d probably be pretty steep. Peter’s here past six almost every day. I don't-"
“That sounds like fun,” Steve couldn’t imagine what kind of man would take his six year old into work with him on the weekends and call him an intern, but Peter didn’t seem to mind so he held his tongue. “Is your dad coming to pick you up today?”
“Jarvis is our butler and he lives in the ceiling. If you listen really closely, you can hear him scuttling around up there during the night,” Tony gestured above him as he bustled around the living area in the penthouse. Steve watched as the harried genius put his bags in a pile and tried to cram miscellaneous paperwork into a briefcase.
“Is that secret source 6’1, blonde, and apparently annoyingly open about his personal relationships when it comes to old war buddies who need a shower?” Tony groaned, halting his progress on the arm yet again.
It was quiet for a couple minutes as Tony began to eat his dinner, occasionally glancing over to where he could just barely see the top of Peter’s unmoving head over the counters. After three minutes passed, the boy slowly started to slip out of the kitchen towards the dining room where Stark pretended that he was too invested in spaghetti to notice the first grader slide across the floos to hide behind the chair opposite of him.
“Making me CEO doesn’t change the fact that you’re still a huge part of the company! You’re still the face of this entire business, it’s YOUR last name in the brand,” Pepper huffed. “What was so important this weekend that you couldn’t reschedule, huh? Do you even have any idea of what Peter likes to do anymore?”
“What a coincidence, I have a friend named Nat too!” Steve smiled down at the first grader who was shoving his knees underneath him in an attempt to be eye to eye with his teacher. “She’s also pretty, but don’t tell her I said that ‘cause I’d never hear the end of it.”
“Oh, boss, you’re awake. We just parked under the tower,” Happy muttered, taking the key out of the ignition and slipping out of the driver’s seat.
“It would be of great service to me if you could tell me when and where the meeting with the PR team is tomorrow,” She jumps right into it, not playing around in the slightest tonight. It must be another late night in the office for her.
Steve nodded, not knowing what to say to that as he stared at the parked cars beside the apartment building bathing in the orange glow from the street lamps. It was dark out.
“Can Mr. Steve eat dinner with us???” Peter set the cookies aside and scrambled to stand up on top of his bed, puppy dog eyes in full force.
“No, nothing like that. He’s just currently obsessed with the amazing Mr. Rogers right now,” Tony rolled his eyes so he’s not sure but for the briefest moments she almost looked surprised by something he said. The look was gone so quickly he started to wonder if he had just imagined it.
“Mr. Steve! Did daddy tell you that you’re comin’ to dinner with us???” Peter had finished shoving the last of his projects into his bag and had skipped over, the human embodiment of honest to god sunshine.
"Jarvis, snooze!" Tony yelled out, face half buried into one of the pillows that covered the top half of his bed.
“You know I can’t tell you that, Steve,” Natasha sighed, suddenly seeming more tired than she had a couple of moments ago.
“Hey! I’m not THAT greasy,” Barnes huffed, shooting Tony a look that the genius dubbed his ‘murder stare’ before continuing. “And it’s not that he’s open about it, it’s just obvious that you two have a thing going on.”
As the vehicle crawled slowly into the parking garage beneath the tower, Happy made sure to slam on the breaks none too gently as he parked. Tony jolted forward, waking with a start.
Steve had fought tooth and nail to save his best friend and hundreds of other men who had sacrificed everything for their country. He helped free over four hundred men. He made the front of the newspaper back home.
Tony was halfway through his glass of whiskey when he realized Natalie was resting on the couch closest to the bar. He was too good at controlling himself to do something like fling the glass across the room upon seeing her, but it was damn near close and he still jumped enough the slosh his drink over the edge and onto his fingers.
“Hey, Peter. Have you ever used these kinds of paint before?” Steve asked, squatting down next to the boy who was squinting over the set of paints like they would unlock the answers to life’s greatest mysteries.
“It’s hard to juggle a kid and an entire company, Tony. Nobody can blame you if you’re a little preoccupied,” Pepper gripped at the Stark Tablet in her hands, struggling with whether she should stay where she is or reach out to comfort her former boss. “Peter doesn’t blame you.”
Maybe it had been shortsighted of him to agree to be Peter's babysitter last week. He had thought that he would watch the boy for an afternoon or two if at all, and that would be that.
“Which brings me to point three,” Natasha gives him a sly smirk before inspecting her nails, looking like the image of nonchalance. “I’m pretty sure it isn’t appropriate to stare at your boss the way you do.”
“Red’s my favorite color! Did you paint it or was it man-uh-fractured like that?” There were practically stars in Peter’s eyes and his father looked just about the same. For the first time since he had found out that he was Tony Stark’s son, he could see the resemblance between the two.
A glance at the boy’s father showed that Tony was getting flustered. Not even those fancy thousand dollar shades could hide the look of guilt that flashed briefly across his face.
Pacing was definitely a more desirable habit to pick up than Tony’s penchant for getting shitfaced and singing Queen songs on top of tables.
“Oh, thank you, Spider Monkey! You’re such a big help,” Tony grinned, reaching out to shake the stuffed animal’s paw. “I owe you my life. However can I repay you?”
Bucky had moved out of Steve's apartment a year or two ago when he finally managed to get a job as a mechanic that was closer to Sam's than it was where they lived then.
“Yeah! My teacher brought cupcakes for lunch time an’ then, uhm, Mr. Steve gave us cookies for snack today!” Peter explained as he wiggled out of his father’s arms and went to gather the drawings he had been working on. “They were like the kind from the store. The white ones with the pink icing an’ the sprinkles an’ stuff.”
“I’m in aftercare right now. Go away,” Peter didn’t so much as look up at his father as he used the patterned scissors to cut the edges of his card into zig-zags.
“Pay...who?” Steve asked, giving such a confused puppy look that Tony was half tempted to pet the top of his head and ask him who the good boy was. Ridiculous, he needed the blonde out of here immediately. This absolute golden retriever of a man was bad for his sanity and his rickety old heart.
“Hey!” Steve chuckled, shaking his head at Bucky who was staring daggers into him from over top the list of specials. “You can’t call me a punk anymore. I’m not some scrawny li’l shrimp from Brooklyn now. I’ve got like two inches on you now.”
Tony fidgeted with his tie as he listened to the sound of his phone dialing through JARVIS’ speakers.
The billionaire looked personally offended at the piece of technology that had been placed into his hands.
“Well’ if you’re so insistent on sending me them...it’s not like I can stop you, right?” Tony sighed, making a big deal of putting his hands on his hips and rolling his eyes. All the blonde could focus on was the relieved smile on Tony’s face. “Besides, it gives me an excuse to be on my phone instead of staring mind-numbing charts and diagrams.”
“That’s what I said, squirt. Anything you want,” Tony planted a quick kiss on his forehead as the first grader seemed to pause, thinking about what he wanted to do.
“Daddy! Mr. Steve drew us as superheroes! He’s the best drawer ever, you’ve gotta come see,” Peter interrupted, tugging insistently on his father’s arm to try and drag him to his bedroom.
“Don’t worry a hair on your perfect little head, Pep. I’ve got myself a brand new sitter and Peter thinks the sun shines out of his ass and everything,” Tony informed, pride creeping into his voice.
Tony glanced back at her, like this was his first time seeing her since he arrived back to the tower, and waved a hand noncommittally. “Oh, yeah. I’m good, thanks. You did a great job and I’ll make sure your next paycheck reflects that, Thank you,” he muttered, already tossing his bags to the couch and heading towards his child. Natalie was already gone before he was done talking.
“Hey, get back here you snot monster!” Tony cried out in fake anguish, jumping to his feet and running to where he could hear his son’s thundering footsteps through the halls.
“Yes, sorry. What were you saying?” Steve cleared his throat, turning his full attention to the shorter man.
Tony blearily blinked the sleep out of his eyes and sluggishly dragged himself out of the car. The tired businessman trudged his way towards the trunk of the vehicle where his trusted bodyguard and friend was pulling out his suitcase.
It seemed the message had been received as the genius waved his hand flippantly. “Natalie’s my assistant. There’s plenty of things for her to do beyond watching my mini monster,” Tony hummed. “Honestly, I think she’d be relieved. She puts on a brave face but I don’t think she’s all that into childcare.”
“I wouldn’t say that,” Steve shrugged, giving the genius a knowing smile as he walked to Peter’s desk and gingerly removed a drawing tacked to the corkboard hanging above it. “Peter insisted I draw one of his other favorite heroes, too.”
“Love you too. Bye aunt Pepper,” Peter said softly as he wiped at his face with the sleeve of his shirt.
Really? Steve? With a crush on him? This was all so juvenile. So...middle school. It was enough to leave Tony gagging. He gathered the rest of his tools and decided he’d spend some time down in his lab before he went to pick Peter up from aftercare.
“I’m flattered he thought of me, but I’m not so sure that’s a good idea,” Steve tried to say it quietly to keep the little boy shoving his artwork into his bag from hearing.
Steve scoffed, “I don’t actually go on any of the dates she tries to force me into. The last person to try and put the moves on me was Peter’s no-good asshole of a father.”
Tony turned, fully expecting to come face to face with a crotchety old man. An old man who would tell him off for being so late but would, ultimately, be pacified once he saw it was THE Tony Stark. A bit of schmoozing here, an apologetic look there and the billionaire would be on his way to do fun things with his son.
Maybe it was because it was frankly uncomfortable seeing the genius without a know-it-all smirk on his face or just because this was getting sad, but Steve decided to have mercy on the billionaire. He went to grab Peter’s bag off a hook by the door.
This was a good choice, he thought to himself as he parked his bike in the lot of the park between his and Natasha’s apartments. The parking lot was about a ten minute walk to their usual spot in front of a pond at the park’s center, but he had time to wander aimlessly the long way around. A good chance to gather his thoughts, helpful thoughts about what he’d say to Nat. Nothing about this morning. Nothing about the dreams that interrupt his sleep almost every other night.
“It’s not fair! I’m not going! Bullshit!” the six year old was throwing a full-on tantrum now, and Tony had just about had it.
Well, googled is a loose term, seeing as he was pacing in front of a holo-screen in the living room after he had put Peter to bed for the night.
There was no pushing this aside, anymore. It’s happening today. The two are going to have a chat. Man to man. Today. In a couple of minutes.
The genius rose back to his feet, readjusting the backpack still slung over his shoulder. He offered a hand out to his son, who eagerly grabbed on, then shot an awkward smile to the teacher who had stood there and witnessed the entire offbeat conversation that had just taken place.
“But I wasn’t even home these last three days, and he has school tomorrow so it’s not like I can take him out for something then either,” The billionaire set the food down on the island, throwing his hands up in exasperation. “Peter will have had to spend the majority of the week alone and just when I get home I’m sent off to even more meetings?”
“No. Everything is bad, and I don’t want to make no Valentines for nobody,” Peter huffed, kicking his legs into the linoleum floor frustratedly.
“What’s up, Steve? Everything good?” Sam asked, the sounds of people fading away as he presumably walked to a different place.
But things were different, Tony had somebody who depended on him. Tony had a son, and the last thing that his son needed right now was for his father to ditch him during his post-rampage nap just to get wasted and circumvent the entire problem that got the two into this mess.
“Whenever someone tells a shitty joke it just goes ape, absolutely hog wild, and slaps the shit out of them. Here, I’ll show you: tell me that joke you brought up last month?”
Steve raised his hands in surrender immediately. “Hey! Don’t drag me into this, I’m just the babysitter.”
“Right. On that heartwarming note, come give me a hug, booger boy,” the genius rolled his eyes, but there wasn’t any hiding the fond smile that the boy had put on his face.
“You know Barnes too?” Rhodey said incredulously. “The hell, Stark? You some kind of American hero magnet or something?”
“Thanks for watching my rugrat,” Tony shrugged. “You got paypal? I’ll give you the cash through paypal.” he muttered, as he started to walk out of Peter’s room and back towards the living room.
A brief knock on the door frame to the classroom had Steve turning to face Ned’s mother who was here to pick him up. The teacher helped him gather his things and waved goodbye as they walked down the hallway to the doors, Ned excitedly chattering away to his mom about the painting he had made. He had painted a picture of the Death Star lego set he had begging his parents for, for weeks.
“That’ll be all, Ms. Potts,” Tony winked, before pretending to go back to the cold pizza he pulled out of the fridge a minute before.
The blonde knew that teachers weren’t supposed to have a favorite student, or at least they should never admit it out loud, but it was hard not to have a soft spot for the kid.
Steve grabbed his brown leather jacket off the hook next to the door to his art room and flicked off the lights.
With that, Steve entered the elevator and was presumably heading down to the private parking garage beneath the building. Tony would have probably fell to the ground if there hadn’t been a single remaining stool at the kitchen island for him to collapse into. He grasped at the shirt covering his chest like it was suddenly choking him, his breath speeding up as he hunched over the granite countertop.
“He’s just tired,” The man answered quickly, like Steve hadn’t totally heard Peter calling his dad out for never spending time with him just ten minutes prior. “Nothing a nap won’t fix. Thanks for carrying his bag, supernanny.”
“I’ll be at the meetings this weekend,” Tony sniffed, finally looking up to meet Pepper’s eyes. “Do me a favor and schedule the majority of my meetings on weekdays from this point on, if you so please, my dear Pepper?”
“I think this room needed an update anyways. You used scotch tape, right?” Tony bent over to give Peter a playful glare, poking at his ribs and making him giggle. “If I find out you’ve been putting duct tape on the walls again, you’re in for it, pal.”
There was around ten kids from ages six to twelve coming in the next ten minutes and he had the project ready for them as soon as they came in the door, so he could give them the lesson plan and let them go wild.
“Oof, geez, kiddo. You’re getting too heavy for me to carry you,” the man teased, poking at his son’s side to make him giggle.
Steve would have stayed there for longer if the cool, March chill hadn’t caused his fingers to go numb.
The caption on the page read ‘New Addition to the Stark Family???’ and went into detail how this mysterious, unidentified, blonde hottie was one of Tony’s newest sweethearts. Things like ‘What does he think about the Stark heir??? Will Tony Stark’s son make or break this blossoming relationship?! Could this finally be the man to tie down and tame the unruly Stark namesake???’ The press were utter vultures.
"Hey, you must be Peter's father," the blonde held out Peter's backpack, it had the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on it.
"I thought - I thought Unca Happy was gonna pick me up today! You surprised me!" Peter wrapped his tiny arms around his father's neck.
The boy was too interested in finding his way out of the maze on his paper to keep the conversation going any further. This was awkward. The silence was killing Steve. He had already picked what he was going to order two minutes ago and now he was just continuing to read the menu for lack of anything better to do.
“Whatever you want, kiddo,” Tony replied, trying to remember if he had remembered to order meatballs from the grocery store last week.
Tony thought that would have been enough to get Peter interested, but a wave of disappointment filled him as he watched his son run away and back to his bedroom. God, he had really messed up this time if not even the promise of cookies could get his son to do something as simple as eating dinner with him. The urge to run away multiplied in tenfold, he ruined the one good thing in his life right now. All for some stupid business trips, he was so stupid and a pathetic excuse for-
The window pumped freezing, cold spring air in from the early morning sky. It cooled him off, making the sweaty shirt he was wearing stick to him uncomfortably, but all Steve could do was sit there and focus on breathing. He sat there, unmoving for anywhere from ten minutes to a full hour, it’s not like he could tell. By the time he straightened up, pulling his head from where he had buried it against his arms on the window sill, the alarm clock on the side of his bed read 8:16.
“That’s very nice of you. I’m sure both of them would be overjoyed to get a card from you,” Steve smiled, patting the boy’s back before standing up.
Tony let himself fall backwards onto the couch. He had been expecting to find anything from an instagram to small criminal records, like maybe a speeding ticket from whipping it too hard on his sexy beast of a motorcycle or smoking pot or something. Not viable proof that Steve could pick Tony up and bend him into a pretzel.
also a quick apology for disappearing for two weeks, i was in a different state with no laptop one week and then after that I caught the plague, which i am still trying to get over! Thanks for sticking with me, though!
“Sorry about that, ma’am. Hopefully I can live up to your legacy,” Steve chuckled, not missing a beat. He may not understand just what his friend was doing playing an assistant with a clipboard and a pencil skirt, but he knew better than to say anything.
Steve sighed, figuring he might as well just say it before they beat it out of him. “I may have gotten myself in over my head this time.”
Imagine Tony's surprise when Mr. Rogers isn't some half decomposed corpse but a man in the prime of his life with shoulders for days. This man was built like god damn Adonis. Who gave him the right??? With chiseled features and perfectly pushed back blonde hair and those sparkling blue eyes and their cold fury and - wait hold on a second...was he? Was he glaring at Tony?
Through the entirety of the car ride and the countless meetings that plagued his weekend, he managed to forget his worries about his son being upset. While the business being conducted was dull and menial, it was enough to keep the man distracted.
I recently came to the horrifying realization that this fic is slowly morphing into a slow burn fic, something I vowed to never do because of how insane they drive me. You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain. Thank god I look good in black.
As soon as he was strapped in, Tony shut the door to the car and turned to Steve. He held out his hand expectantly.
I'm actually posting Friday's chapter before eleven at night, break out the fuckin champagne! Let's celebrate.
“Wow, I’m really feeling the love tonight kiddo. Nothing says ‘I love you, pops’ more than asking your art teacher to carry you to the car instead of your dear old dad,” Tony teased, leading the way out of the still busy restaurant. “No, no, please. I enjoy feeling like chopped liver. Don’t mind me.”
ok first off, sorry the last two chapters have literally just been set-up but good news! This was the last one, next chapter is the big date!
“I must’ve overestimated how hungry I was,” he sighed, leaning his head onto his hand with a forlorn look at his half-empty plate. “I’ll never be able to finish all these noodles on my own. If only there was a certain special spider monkey who could come help me out, then we could eat the cookies I made for dessert too. Oh, well.”
“I don’t want Miss Natalie to be my babysitter anymore, she doesn’t read any of my books right. Doesn’t use any of the voices,” Peter flopped over, wrapping both his tiny arms around Steve’s considerably larger one. “I want you to be my babysitter now. You can do really good drawings an’ you like superheroes an’ I bet you could throw me like a basketball too. That would be cool.”
“Oh, I see it now,” Tony managed to spit out after a moment’s hesitation. “Well, there we go. Aren’t we just a regular Brady Bunch?”
“C’mon, Mr. Steve!” the first grader pleaded, pushing himself upright and clasping his hands in front of himself. “I’ll even draw you as a superhero if you say yes, you can be my sidekick!”
“He was famous for being a total tank and barreling through almost any obstacle in his way, but just as famous for his last years in service where he did everything in his power to keep out of the press,” Rhodey explained before jumping straight to the point. “And what the hell do you mean babysit? This man could bench press a truck.”
“Now let’s attack!” Peter yelled, jumping around to face the teddy bear and holding out a can of silly string menacingly. It was at this exact moment when he finally noticed his father standing by the elevator, watching the scene play out before him. The spray can hit the floor, “Daddy!!!”
“Is there anything you can’t do, superman?” Tony pushed through the awkwardness, gesturing to Steve with his half-eaten cookie. “Good with kids, hot as the dickens, an honest to God COOK??? I’ll find your secret weakness one day.”
It had been hard to get him back from Hydra, and it didn’t help that the brunette was fighting them on it every step of the way. Little did anyone know that getting him to the states would be the easiest part of the entire mess. When James Buchanan Barnes finally came home he was missing his arm and the majority of his memories beyond the time he spent as an assassin in Russia.
Genius. Playboy. Billionaire. Philanthropist. Face smashed against the car window. Passed out and drooling as Happy drove them back home to the tower.
“No, no. You’re not allowed to pull the ‘aw shucks’ routine on me, Cupid,” Tony chuckled, pulling his tools from the metal arm and wiping them off with a nearby rag. “I’ve seen that nasty, mushy, lovesick-fool look in your eyes when you talk about Sam. Names are irrelevant, you become a regular ol’ softy when it comes to him.”
Steve came to talk with Nat and hadn’t gotten a single clear answer out of her for why she was working as Stark’s secretary. She left him with even more questions, and she was probably already in her car and halfway to her apartment by now.
“Are you going to give me your phone so I can put in my contact information or do I have to go hound the front desk at the Rec Center for your number?”
The boy giggled and called his dad silly, but gladly held onto him as they made their way from the parking lot to the front lobby to the diner.
“Yeah, sorry! Just doing some spring cleaning in advance,” the veteran sighed, rubbing the back of his head as he shuffled his way through the maze of stacked tupperware bins and dusty old boxes to where Tony now stood in the doorway of the closet. “What can I do for you two?”
“Shhhhh, do you need a band-aid?” Peter asked, pulling back a little bit to look him in the eyes. All of this was so very serious and it was hard for him not to laugh.
“Absolutely wonderful, I truly enjoyed every second spent in that room listening to the speaker lower the I.Q. of everyone within a five mile radius. How’s my boy?” The genius muttered, not able to take his eyes off where Peter was completely ignoring him.
“Hey there, Spiderman!” Tony chuckled as he took a knee so he could catch his son, who immediately sprinted over, in a tight hug. “Looks like you two were having fun while I was out?” The genius smirked, looking up at Steve from over Peter’s shoulder.
“You’ve outdone yourself, Nanny McPhee. I don’t think Peter thought about the fact that dear ol’ dad ditched him at all this weekend,” Tony hummed, turning to Steve with his hands in his pockets.
“Aww, you big softie!” He laughed, pulling her in for a quick hug. It took about three seconds for her to start slipping out of his grasp.
Usually men like Steve would have way more press. Interviews and charity balls and shaking hands with government officials, hell, BECOMING a government official wasn’t uncommon for men like him. The scant information that Tony managed to uncover about the man had the distinct writing of a reporter trying to work around a restraining order on the press.
“Daddy? Are you ok?” He asked softly, patting his father’s knees. “Do you want me to call Unca Rhodey to help you breath?”
“Watch, daddy!” That was all the warning Steve got that Peter was going to take a running start and launch himself into his teacher’s arms. The artist just barely had enough time to set the drink he was holding down and catch the boy. “See! Steve didn’t even make grumbly sounds like you did.”
“Welcome back, sir. Would you like me to inform Captain Rogers of your arrival?” JARVIS greeted his creator as soon as he stepped into the elevator to Stark Tower.
He glanced down at the paper he had been handed. It was another superhero, this one was red and gold and looked like a robot. ‘Ironman’ was scrawled across the top of the page in what Tony assumed was the blonde’s handwriting. The drawing was annoyingly well done, just like everything else Steve did, but what really caught his eye was the glowing blue circle in the middle of Ironman’s chest that made it suddenly much too hard to breathe in here.
“You’re ok, dude. You’ll be fine when you get married,” The little boy told him, with a determined look on his face.
“No, I’m going to drop him off at a friend’s house. They’re making a lego death star, the little nerds couldn’t be more thrilled about it,” Despite the teasing tone of voice, Tony couldn’t help but grin. His son and Ned were adorable with how anxious they were to finish it.
“Purely circumstantial. Maybe I just pay more attention to you when you tell me about your friends,” Tony glanced up at where the mechanic was looking down at him with an amused smirk on his face.
“Oh? Do you and Ned hang out a lot outside of class?” Steve asked, sitting down next to Peter and grabbing some paper and a pencil for himself.
“Ok! If I carry you to your dad’s car, will you promise to drop this conversation?” Steve asked, already pulling the boy up to sit on his hip. As soon as the words had left Peter’s mouth, he had seen Tony puffing up to argue against being called short.
It wasn’t so much as dreading work as he was dreading what came afterwards. At six, Tony would be here to pick up Peter. Instead of the billionaire’s usual weirdly flirtatious greeting, query about his son’s behavior, and quick exit, he would be waiting for Steve to clean and lock up his classroom. From there he’d be letting him follow him back to the Stark tower so he could park his motorcycle in Tony’s personal garage.
There was a brief pause as Tony’s usual smirk morphed into something more thoughtful as he squinted up at Steve. It was as if he was trying to figure him out just by staring at him.
“Wow, really? Not even a hello from my dear sweet Rhodey Bear? I’m removing the hearts from your contact name in my phone as we speak. Mortally wounded, over here.”
"Yes, he's mine. Now that we're all caught up, where is he???" Tony was impatiently bouncing his left leg, glancing around the lobby as if Peter would just magically be there.
"James Buchanan Barnes, you big gossip!" Steve laughed, raising a skeptical brow at his friend who was suddenly intently surveying the menu yet again. "Do you not have anything better to do than sit around all day and read tabloids?"
“I haven’t a clue what you’re talking about,” Tony lied, poking at the circuits attached to the fingers of the arms and making them jump.
“Google it,” Tony told him, grabbing Steve’s duffel bag from where it had been sitting beside the couch and turning to shove it into his arms. “Shoot me a message when you finish making your paypal and then we’re all set. Have a good rest of your weekend.” the brunette, turned with a half-hearted wave as he walked to the kitchen. He hoped to god it looked like he knew what he was doing.
“That’s enough outta you, son. You’ve got two options here,” The man started, bending at the waist so he could look his unruly child in the eyes. “One; you can walk out to the car yourself like a big boy. Or two; I pick you up, kicking and screaming, and take you to the car on my own. Your choice.”
“I just hired him to babysit my son,” Tony muttered as he rolled onto his stomach. “There isn’t much about him on the interwebs, so I figured I’d call you up, my dear.”
“C’mon, bud. Your dad’s here! You can go home now,” Steve tried to give the kid a reassuring smile, but it only proved to make the child even more upset.
“I’m sorry about the mess. I figured you would have texted me when you left so we would have time to tidy up before you got back,” Steve was laughing nervously, nearly tripping over the chair directly behind him.
“Would you shut the hell up already, Stark?” Bucky laughed, throwing the rag lying on the cot into his face. “Just figured I’d let you know. It’s honestly completely selfish of me, I’m tired of hearing him pine over you like a thirteen year old girl.” Barnes slid off the table, standing up and stretching a bit more before grabbing his coat. “But I get it if you’re too pussy to make the first move.”
“Just the word on the street, Stark,” Bucky shrugged, using the shoulder that wasn’t currently being dug around in.
“If she isn’t afraid to call you out then I’d suggest you’d go meet her before you’re late,” Steve joked, a hand on the genius’ shoulder as he not-so-subtly directed him towards the elevator doors.
“Are you really ok with this?” It had been gnawing at the back of Steve’s mind all throughout dinner. “You don’t know anything about me besides my name and where I work, and you’re letting me take care of your son.”
Tony’s smile had slipped off his face, and a quick glance over his shoulder told him ‘Mr. Steve’ was just as lost for an answer as he was.
“I’ve been here the whole time, Mr. Stark,” Natalie said with a dazzling smile and a tilt of her head. “I can leave if you’d like me to, I was just finishing up some paperwork before I went home for the night. Figured I’d do it somewhere comfortable instead of the offices.”
“Shocker. What’d you do this time, Cap?” Bucky mumbled slumping into the couch cushions, stretching his legs out across Sam’s lap. “Doesn’t got anything to do with your Tony Stark biz, does it?”
“I was just saying that if you have any questions, just ask Jarvis. Bedtime is eight, and Peter will most certainly try to weasel out of it, so have fun with that. Kid’s damn persuasive when he wants to be,” Tony explained, eyes trained on where his son had curled up on the couch with his juice.
“Bucky’s got a point,” Sam shrugged at the betrayed looking blonde. “He’s all you’ve been talking about for weeks.”
“Promise. I love you, spider monkey,”Tony pressed a quick kiss to his son’s forehead and stood back up, trying to give Peter a brave smile. Steve wondered if this is how it went every time the man went on a business trip.
He shrugged as he stood back up. “I’m not sure, maybe it’s magic?” Steve held back another laugh as the kid wrinkled his nose up at that answer.
“It’s getting late. I should get home,” The blonde muttered, going to where he had thrown his jacket across the counter when he first came in. “I’m helping a neighbor move tomorrow and then I’ve got work in the afternoon.”
“Goodnight, Ms. Potts,” Just as he was returning his phone to his pocket, Natalie approached, bag slung over her shoulder as she got ready to head home as well.
It wasn’t a repeat of the day prior by any means. Peter gave his dad a small smile when he came into the art room, and even answered when asked how his day had been. No, the first grader was just fine. It was looking at the business tycoon shaped elephant in the room eye-to-eye that was causing problems.
Steve awoke violently, with the sounds of gunshots in his good ear and the smell of smoke filling his nose. He tore out of the sweaty sheets that were clinging to him like a vice, that were choking him like an enemy he couldn’t find in the dim room he slept in. Nearly, ripping the curtains off of the rod nailed above the window, he managed to brush them aside and tug open the window for some desperately needed fresh air.
Reluctantly, Tony slipped his phone out of his pocket. He angrily jabbed at his contacts list until he was dialing just the man he’d been meaning to talk to. Admittedly, this wasn’t the circumstance he’d want to ask this in, but when has anything ever gone well for him before? The phone rang for thirty seconds before someone finally picked up.
“Jarvis? The time?” He muttered as he folded the box up and stuck it into the fridge where he had previously pulled it out from.
