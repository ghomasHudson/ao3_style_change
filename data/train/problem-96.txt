John turned to Sherlock with sadness, he could see that he was reluctant to go but Sherlock was right, they both had obligations. "Right."
John had a history book opened and was trying to concentrate as Sherlock was kissing his neck. "You know I actually have to study." He said playfully pushing him away.
John huffed but walked away. There was nothing more for him to do. Hopefully Sherlock would let him back in. There had to be an end to this nightmare somewhere.
Sherlock turned to face John. "You need help John. You anger is getting out of hand."
Clark hung his head down in shame "Sorry Caleb"
John had walked in and greeted Mike and Lily, a big smile on his face. Age was apparent on his face but he wore it with fine dignity. Sherlock could tell that he was still in the military, had been bonded, was currently single, was as handsome as ever.
John was getting frustrated. "This is all so bloody stupid!"
"Sleeping Persephone. Why aren't you doing it?" He said looking back down at the piles of post and making sure Archimedes was still settled in his arms.
"I know I did." John tried to sooth. "But I want to make it up to you."
Tristan though as little as he was seemed to understand that his Daddy was not coming back. Sherlock held his grandson as the little boy cried and held his Dad's dog tags.
_____________________________________
Sherlock took that as full on permission as he started to pull John jumper off.
All the children started talking at once, making their own deductions about how there Mums night went.
Sherlock smiled so wide and kissed John passionately. John pulled away just for one second. "Can this just be ours for a little while. I know we'll eventually have to make the engagement public but...I want this to just be ours."
"As you wish."
PLEASE?!
Sherlock was walking around the dorm room looking around at the different objects and wrinkling his nose at the naked omega model calendar that was on the wall. Alphas. "No, we are going to my parents house. There's going to be a small gathering with a few family members and close friends. I think it would be an opportune night to just introduce you to all of them at once so there's not much gossip and rumours running around later."
In all honesty Sherlock was surprised he even received an invitation but it seems that this was a big celebration and if you really stressed the point Sherlock could see how you would mistake him and the Beta as friends. Still, useless sending an invitation to a man with as many children as he had to a night out where it seemed children would not be welcome. Not that anyone besides his family, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson had an exact number on how many children he had.
All Holmes heads turned towards John and at that moment he wished he had the power of invisibility. Violet looked like she was about to tear John a new arsehole before Siger stepped in "John, why don't we go in the study?" Siger put his hand on John's back and started leading him out of the kitchen "We'll be safer in there." He whispered to him.
"Food fight!” Edelweiss and Valentina yelled.
David shifted in his seat "Actually....there's not going to be a time to work on us...."
John couldn't help but laugh a little "Ale? Are we in the 18th century now?"
George looked back and forth between Sherlock and Greg before nodding "Fine." He pointed towards Sherlock "But I don't want to hear him saying anything like that again! I know times are different but I still believe in treating Omegas with respect. I also think it's best that he leave and sleep this off."
"He's an Omega. And we knew each other in school and even dated for awhile." John said.
"They're really weird though." Valentina said.
If any of you were wondering the poppyseed thing is real. It's how you make synthetic heroin.
His guards weren't by his side like Greg was though they were mostly in the shadows making sure the fellow students kept the taking pictures to none.
John leaned against the closed bedroom door. What did he just do? The alpha rage completely took over his body like he was a pubescent teenage boy. When alpha rage struck it was anyone's guess what would happen and unfortunately now it was the worst.
Sherlock took a deep breath. "John Watson."
John snuggled deeper into his pillow trying to keep sleeping.
Greg stepped in putting his hands up between the two brothers "Now before we get dramatic here, Sherlock you need to understand this could change your life completely."
John looked at Sherlock who was listening intently "I want you to be apart of our lives too especially the baby's but I will take no ill treatment of my husband. He and I plan to bond after the baby is born so he's not going anywhere. You have to be willing to accept all of us."
John took a deep breath "Fine. What do you want to show me?"
John couldn’t believe his eyes. Jim had said that there would be no pushback. He turned to Sherlock and said “I had to study.” He said quietly.
Sherlock took Tristan from John's arms as they stood next to each other to greet thier daughter.
"John Watson!" Mike said excitedly and crushed John with a big hug.
"I observed. I can smell the birth control but it's only very faint under your natural smell although it has a slight hint of sterile meaning you still have some suppressants in your system. You have a tan line on your writs and neckline which means you've been out in the desert and the only reason to go is because you are in the army. Being an Alpha I know Omegas are not allowed to fight in combat, you look to bullheaded for a desk job so you're training in the medical field. It'll get you close enough to the action while still abiding by the restrictions put on your gender. You're favouring your left side but not enough for anyone to notice so you're trying not to worry someone which must be your family. Too small to be major but yet if it's still giving you problems that means it was quite a wound and since you were training I can only come to the conclusion you were under attack. The only question I cannot answer is were you in Afghanistan or Iraq."
We're brilliant together and I never have to think twice about your commitment towards me. Even if sometimes I still snap at you for being a bit slower to understanding then I am you just smile and kiss me.
John narrowed his eyes "I'm not scared, I've just never danced before."
He was greeted by a group of people all in black. "Welcome John." A woman with black hair in a tight bun and a small frame said being the first to smile and shake his hand. "My name is Meredith. I'm the royal families personal stylist. I'm assigned to the well being of any omega in the family or personally connected to the family. This is my team and we're going to make sure you look your best today." Her smile was warm and reassuring.
The Watson Kids immediately stood in a line and at attention. John got down from the table and looked all his children in the eye “You all should be ashamed of yourselves! We are going to be a family and we need to start acting like it! Jankers for you all!” the Watson children all groaned “We’re leaving!” John went over to Sherlock and picked-up Caleb. “Forward March!”
David stood up straight. "I'm sorry sir."
Sherlock smiled and offered his hand "A pleasure to meet you sir. John speaks very highly of you."
Mycroft accepted the answer. "So does Mother know about him?"
Greg, who had been standing and listening outside the door immediately bolted in the office. "What?! Sherlock! Are you sure?"
Greg encompassed him in an embrace and let Sherlock cry "The baby will never think you're a freak and you know who loves you? I do, your brother does, your family does. You're an amazing person Sherlock. John saw that and I know he still loves you. You need to tell him you still love him too."
"Is that my boy?" A hearty voice called. A man that looked exactly like Mycroft in a black suit just older came up and embraced Sherlock. "I was starting to think you weren't coming."
Sherlock closed his eyes "Get out John." He said quietly.
This was even better then the last time. The slightly rough treatment and the moans and screams that began to poor from trier lips helped. Soon John's knot grew and with one final hard thrust he came with Sherlock coming for the second time.
Sherlock gave his brother a scowl. Sherlock knew what would be expected of John once he began learning his station "I cannot ask of John to simply put on the burden of a household. He's going to school to be a Doctor as well as being enrolled in the army. I cannot ask him to simply throw that all away."
Sherlock stood almost nose to nose in front of his Father. "I will find a way."
John sucked in the fresh air of home. He had just gotten back from basic training in Kabul but being an Omega, was not allowed to stay and do a full tour with his mates. Even though Omegas had been allowed into the military for over a quarter of a century they were still too "delicate" to fight in the front lines. Instead the were subjected to desk jobs or in John's case, off-combat medical staff which brought him to now, his last year of basic university levels before medical school.
John slowly walked up the steps of 221B, trying to come up with a way to break to Sherlock that their deal was off and they could not stay in London. As he opened the flat door he braced himself for what was on the other side.
As the ambulance pulled over to the side of the road Oliver put one hand on Sherlocks knee "Alright, on your next contraction I'm going to need you to give me a big push. This baby wants out and I can't do this without you."
John nodded and delicately carried Sherlock down the hall. He tried reaching for the door handle but it was rather difficult trying to do that and carry his husband at the same time. After a few tried and failed attempts Sherlock opened the door but not without laughing at his husband pouted face.
'Oh God can I kill myself?' Sherlock thought as another Alpha tried to flatter him by saying his backside was something he wanted to eat cake off of, whatever that meant. He then deduced that the Beta that he was currently shacking up with was using him for his money and was currently pregnant with his brothers baby.
So this song is actually titled "A Summer In Ohio."
(See the end of the chapter for
The room became very silent and heavy.
Greg smiled "Talk to you later?"
Conner stuck his tongue out at his older sister "She wouldn't let me carry the box with the TV in it!"
Violet sighed "Thank you! Finally someone who understands the point I'm coming from!"
Johns had enough and punched Sherlock right in the face. Sherlock who was not expecting the blow fell to the floor and the pub got quiet as they were all trying to see what was going on. John came around the other side and pointed his finger toward him "I don't know who you think you are but I'm not some whore! Come back to the pub when you learn some manners you knot head!"
The Watsons all froze, John never got mail. He took the envelope and slowly opened it up. "They're divorce papers...." John said quietly.
"No, just dress like a normal person. And also loose the fancy talk. You're not having a meeting with the Pope your royal lushness."
"That would be lovely." Cynthia said joining her husband on the couch.
David puts his nose to his blissfully unaware son's head. "Can we just wait to see if you get into the company then go on from there?"
Sabian nodded and cooed at the baby as he walked away.
"Mum? Dad?" John said in surprise. "What are you doing here?"
"Well I guess this is it." Darius said picking at his plate of cake.
Sherlock pursed his lips wanting to believe the Alpha so badly. ‘If you say so John.’
Even though Sherlock looked uncomfortable with the attention he smiled at his parents "I apologise I was.....delayed." He said the last word while directly looking at John.
Harry gave a wicked grin "Oh come off it, Omega. Mummy and Daddy aren't here to protect or defend you so get angry, see if I care."
Mycroft smiles at his nephew "A little structure never hurt anyone. You all have been blessed with a parent who is also a child and therefore has no discipline or boundaries whatsoever. I think a little military influence would be good on all of you."
Sherlock stood up straighter and lifted his chin "I was in need of a job and your boss was surprised by my references so he told me as long as I could keep my manners in check and do as you tell me I could have the job."
Charlotte shrugged. Her eyes were still puffy from the crying and voice was still a bit raw. "Figured I would find you here. This is the one day that was always special to you." She does everything to avoid eye contact.
"Hello" Jim said. John was surprised to hear a slight Irish accent.
Darius and Sabian tagged teamed Christopher and Connor trying to back the two into a corner so there was no way out.
David stayed silent. Ever since that night eight months ago when John got mad over David wanting to hold his son his father in-laws have been growing more and more apart.
John couldn't help the grimace "Thank you Clara."
Richard kept the smile plastered on his face "Does your mother know about him?"
After a second of hesitation Sherlock began to kiss back and soon they were laying down on the floor of the roof. Slowly the clothes began to shed and it was nice not to rush but to savour every moment.
John smiled and walks towards him. "It's been what? Three months?"
Persephone became hot with rage. “Is it really for your younger brother’s benefit or are you just jealous you don’t have a body to show off like mine?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and slammed the door once the boys walked out. He then walked back to his very drunk husband who was currently trying to lift himself up.
David could smell the over powering stench of alcohol on her breath. "Let's get you upstairs." The girls from the ballet company left after he gave them a look of anger.
Sherlock
"But you don't understand!-" John said as he tried to push past.
The boys hooped and hollered as the made their way out to enjoy their night.
Valentina 10- Beta(Adopted)
"Shut up." John whispered.
Sherlock looked confused then angry about being pulled out of his thoughts "What?!"
Sherlock nodded "Right, check-book is in my room and take Persephone with you so you two can go grab some things from the market. Seems we're out of milk and bread."
Sherlock looked at the out stretched hand for a quick second before grabbing it "Sherlock."
John stood up holding his hand out in front of his Dad "Dad-"
Sherlock looked down and pulled on his jacket a bit "What's wrong with the way I dress?"
"That's enough!" John yells in his alpha voice and Sherlock immediately silences. "I am the alpha in the household and how dare you speak to me in such a way! From now on you are to start submitting to what I say and ask for permission on what you do! Maybe taking on your traditional omega role will teach you not to make a mistake like this ever again!"
"You look good like that."
"Brandy?" Siger offered pulling John away from his thought.
Sherlock sat up straighter and rubbed his belly "I've wanted to talk to you about something..."
"I'm sorry about that. She can be quite pushy when she drinks." Jim said.
(See the end of the chapter for
We're fine!
__________________________________________________
Sherlock turned to the two beta girls "And I'm sure you two have a lot of cleaning up to do after your artistic expressions. Go on."
John threw off his covers and took a deep breath. "Fine..." he said. Getting up out if his bed he allowed himself to be pulled into the washroom to begin his day of fake smiles and genuine enthusiasm.  He guessed that it would be have to be something he would have to get used too. Being engaged to the Crown Prince had people already referring to him as Prince Regent, his official title when Sherlock would be crowned King. He was glad it wasn't like olden days when he would be referred to as Queen despite him being a male, Prince Regent although snobby as all hell was still a better title than Queen.
Oliver laughed "Give me one more big push and you'll find out."
"That's another thing!" Greg yelled "I can't believe you lied to him about loosing the baby! That has got to be the most selfish, horrible thing you have ever done! What's going to happen if he one day finds out Sherlock?"
_______________________________________
All eight children stared back at him. They knew something was up when this morning their father didn't blow his usual whistle to get them all up in the morning.
"State your name, age, and what you will be performing for us." A young woman who was looking down at papers said.
The Holmes children started to chuckle amongst themselves never seeing such a formality.
John started breathing heavily leaning up against a brick wall in an alleyway. Sherlock was next to him trying to catch his breath, hair disheveled and eyes wide. For a second they stare at each other then start giggling.
John sighed "Well I think I found out who ratted us out."
Alvin shook his head. "I don't mind sitting out here Master John. It is my duty to protect you and I tased that duty very seriously."
Sherlock smiled and laid his chin on Johns stomach. "You smell a little more ripe then usual."
'Alright it was foolish of me to think that.’ John said. ‘I guess it’ll just take them a little longer to get along. It’ll all be okay love.’
Sherlock squeezed his hand which forced John to look at him. The two gave each other a smile before John was compelled to kiss his husband. "I love you." John said after they broke apart. "And I'm sorry."
Sherlock winced at the pain but it quickly turned into a warm feeling, like when you had a sore muscle that was being massaged out. The bite would trigger Sherlock's heat in about 12 hours and then they could complete the bond.
Sherlock showed John his phone.
___________________________________
Sherlock felt an unease come over him "Cleary an admirer pining after John."
Sherlock looked at his daughter "I'd be a very difficult man to find a mate for."
They got up to the room and Greg unlocked the door and stepped inside the room. "Good God." He said.
George the owner, a big muscular man with a balding head, came out from the back room once he heard the yelling going on. He came to stand beside John and saw a boy on the ground holding his cheek "What the devil is going on here?"
Sherlocks sobs became louder "I'm saying there is no baby anymore. I lost it. So....go to Scotland. Become an army doctor. Live all the dreams you deserve. Without me."
Sherlock nodded his head. "I love you too."
"Are we allowed to?" John questioned.
John smiled "Thanks." He then looked at his watch "Well looks like this place is cleaned up. Are you ready to go?"
Sherlock smiled and looked down at their linked fingers. "You're welcome."
Just earlier today I was a wounded soldier with a limp and I can't even begin to comprehend that my leg no longer hurts and that I've just practically signed on to be your assistant on cases.
"You can have a seat by John." The professor pointed to the stool that was empty.
Mycroft began to make himself a cup of tea from the spread that was sitting in the table between them "I must say that we are all pleased with your progress at school. Perhaps this little experiment will end sooner then we hoped if you continue down this path."
John turned to the truck to see Clara aged eight and Carter aged six struggling with a big box as they tried to carry it together. Out of all his children Clara and Carter were the closest. "Do you two need some help?"
He was quickly taken out of his thoughts as guards started to pay him down. They were going through his pockets and even one grabbed his behind in the process.
_____________________________________
Charlotte skipped over to David and kissed him on the cheek. "Thank you!" She kissed Tristan on the forehead. "Bye!" She quickly called before she headed out the door.
"It was a thank you. For everything." John smiled.
The doors opened to the palace and John marvelled in its splendour. He of course had been here before on school trips and such but for some reason it felt even more amazing then it used to.
Molly was on the phone crying "I'm so sorry."
The officers backed away to revile John. Sherlock gasped in shock "John?", he was the last person he thought he'd ever see. He stood right behind Greg so John couldn't see his stomach.
"Mother." Sherlock said in John's defence "John is actually quite gifted. He's very intelligent."
Joh sighed knowing that Alvin would not let the name up. "Would you like to come in?"
"Well good thing I don't have to worry about that." Greg said going over the files himself.
Sherlock held his phone closer to his face while rocking Archimedes after his nightly feed. ‘Could have gone? John it was an absolute nightmare.’
Greg looked over to Sherlock "Sherlock." He said to try to get his attention "Sherlock." He said a bit more louder and firmer. Still not getting an answer he walked over the the bed and shook the boy "Sherlock!"
"John! John! Turn here!" the paparazzi where outside the store but he could clearly see them through the windows. Immediately people turned towards him which immediately made him go red with embarrassment.
Sherlock
John H. Watson
When John woke up it took him a second to remember his surroundings and last night. He was still on top of the roof but a quick sweep told him that Sherlock had dressed and left already.
Sherlock
The car trip to the palace seemed to take forever. He was told there would be a private room to get ready in for the announcement.
Siger smiled "Can I have any clues?"
"I would expect so. I'm completely exhausted as well but I don't want to put him down." He said.
Flames burned behind his eyes as he turned to his family. "You have no right to keep us apart!"
Sherlock pouts but let's go of John who answers the door. When he opens it he's surprised to see Siger Holmes standing on the other side.
John's air had escaped his lugs, Sherlock had just proposed to him how could his Da possibly know? "How?..."
Dumbfounded at what just happened James yelled at him "John there's plenty of bitches out there! Don't get hung up on just one!"
Soon the world was peaceful and the stars seemed to dance above them and they both fell asleep in each other's arms.
"It was...my um...." John stuttered.
Sherlock picked up a light blue onsie "I really like John's middle name, Hamish. He hates it though."
Sherlock looked up but steeled his face to not give away how vulnerable he was.
Greg sighed "Only bloody Sherlock Holmes would wish for a murder."
John gave a weak smile to his parents. "Everything sounds so pretty in French. Excuse me." John said then walked to the bedroom door as well.
John grunted and walked back into the living room.
He had won a paid-internship at St. Barts for his academics in the medical field. It was hard leaving Scotland where his parents currently resided as well as his friends but this was too good of an opportunity to pass up. His parents used to live in England when he was no older then three then his Dad's company transferred to Scotland so even though his roots were English the place felt foreign and a little too big for his liking. He was making do though.
Caleb turned to John “Did you conform to society Captain?”
Cody listened to her sister and couldn't help but agree "This isn't fair! Dad should be thinking about us!"
This is a long chapter but I hope you enjoy! I had fun writing this one!
John stood next to him "Um.....no not really. If it's just dinner with your parents do I really need to dress up?"
Charlotte feels a part of herself feel compassion towards another human. "I didn't know you felt that way...." She says in a small voice.
"Oh my god they’re insane” Chloe whispered to Christopher.
The gates were closed behind them and the car pulled up. Johns door was open and to protect his privacy an umbrella was opened to the side of him to hide him from the pictures that were being taken. Sherlock was quickly escorted in with John about 12 guards behind him.
Cases have been pouring in thanks to the blog and you're thrilled with the fact that you're no longer so bored. I'm greatful that you don't feel the need to shoot the wall due to it. Poor Mrs. Hudson, she never saw the damage coming.
Sherlock sat down at his desk with a heavy sigh adjusting Archimedes in his arms as he gave him his nightly feed slightly wincing at the hard bite the infant possessed. As much as he adored his children, nights were a time that he could organise his mind palace, get things done, and also enjoy the silence of his flat.
When the music concluded and Charlotte took her bow. There was no applause, there wasn't even any smiles. The head instructor got out of his chair and stood in front of Charlotte. She was sure he'd be able to hear her heart pounding.
"I bet."
____________________________________
As John walked to his first class he noticed a sort of buzz around the campus. Not the usual nervousness or the greeting of friends but an excitement.
Caleb wrinkled his nose “You have funny names.”
April 10, 2013 20:00
Oliver looked up in panic "This baby isn't going to wait! He's at 10cm and already starting to crown!"
Sherlock approached John gently. "You alright?"
John decided to get a little closer. "Are you....are you alright."
All the children knew when their father used that voice it was time to stop.
John looked at the people who were currently watching them "Maybe we could talk about this some other time?"
I'm trying my hardest to stick all this nonsense out. I made you a promise that I would stick through this all thick and thin.
"No. Just my brother-in-law. When I thought I may be pregnant he took me to buy the test and I didn't want to find out alone so he stayed with me."
Sherlock laid his head on John's shoulder and took a deep breath of his sent. "I'm exhausted. I had classes all morning, then I come home and find all this nonsense waiting for me, and this baby won't give me a moments peace."
John was smiling so hard his face began to hurt, he wanted to badly to snog Sherlock senseless but has no desire to embarrass himself in front of his family so he settled with laying a kiss on his arm.
As much as it was normal for his family to move around he could tell that it was a toll on his family as it was the first move since Mary, their mother and his Omega wife had died. She died in a car accident three years prior and the family was just coming out of their grieving period and even Chloe who was abiding by her mothers wishes for her Dad to move on was trying to encourage him to meet other Omegas.
That morning her parents wished her good luck. She kissed Tristan goodbye but David didn't really acknowledge her which threw her off a little bit but was determined it wasn't going to mess with her mind frame.
"About 30 minutes ago." John answered again.
We began to ask around the town. We found out that he was a single man, that he was poor because we dedicated himself to helping others who could not afford to mend thier children's clothes. The town would pitch in to help this man keep up his rent.
"Of course darling. She is family after all."
"I understand your concerns." John said "But it'll be great.
Sherlock smiled "I like the sound of that." The kissing began again as they started to take each other's clothes off.
As he packed his knapsack Mike walked in alone "Hey..."
Greg went to stand next to John "So a little less then five months until the kid comes huh?"
John sighed ‘Yeah….’
John conscious kept him up all night as he tried to think of a way to tell Sherlock the news. He came up empty and didn't know what he was going to do.
Mycroft and Sherlock say on one couch while Violet and Siger sat on the other. An uncomfortable silence befell the family as the parents stared at their son and Sherlock avoided eye contact.
John turned away to hide the tears in his eyes. "Well I'm not Royal material and you'll be busy with your duties and running this country. I guess I'll just see you in a parade sometime yeah?"
The stench of eggs hits her and makes her want to throw up. She turns the corner and her parents are in the kitchen. Sherlock is at the table reading a book while John is walking back and forth making breakfast.
John held Sherlock in his arms and Sherlock wrapped his arms around John as well "It's going to be okay. Come on, you're the strongest person I know. Just a few pushes and our baby will be here. But we need you to push."
I mean you can't touch them, hell, you can't even look at them.
"John! John!" A female voice calls.
Violet nodded "Good. Go wash up for dinner darling. We have a meeting with the Prime Minister tonight."
Greg rolled his eyes "Whatever you say Your Highness. Shall we unload the car and get you set up in your room?"
"Do as I say and do the shopping." He said as he passed through his two children.
John flinched a little at the last part, he hated the "birth" conversation.
Sherlock grabbed John's hand. "Look about last night-"
I'm not willing to let her go.
Sherlock held on to John a little tighter "I know it's difficult but it's something we must do."
Sherlock gave John a hard look. "Your heat is going to start soon."
John was drying a glass when a tall, dark haired Alpha came up to the bar. He was rather attractive but John tried to be professional. "What can I get you mate?" He said with a smile.
The music began and Charlotte started. The dance was simple yet elegant. The choreography was meant to show off a dancers form and the way the body of a ballet dancer is kept. Even the lyrics asked the audience to watch the way she moved and to take note that there's a thousand other dancers but she is the most beautiful. In a way Charlotte hoped that the song would resonate with the judges and show them that she worked hard and belonged here.
John suddenly became angry. Did Sherlock think him not good enough to be seen in public now? He had half a mind to just say 'fuck it all' and leave.
It sounded so simple but with those few words it was like all of Sherlock's wishes came true. For the first time in his life he made a decision on impulse and not on facts. "Yes." He said.
"I bet you don't." Avoiding the mess Sherlock helped his husband up to his feet. "Come on let's get you to bed so you can sleep this off."
When they got into Greg's office Sherlock leaned against the desk trying not to cry out in pain "No you don't John. Love is an illusion."
"Don't move." Sherlock said gently "You might make yourself sick."
Sherlock offered a small smile "Anytime darling."
Sherlock laughed at the surprise but appreciated the sentiment none the less. He then kissed his new husband "Bedroom is down the hall." He whispered.
Sherlock got up in a huff and headed to the bar.
John grabbed Sherlock "No...just please hear me out. You are by far the most interesting, complex person I ever met and I think we could be great together. Yes maybe it was the baby that brought us together but I think we could really be good for each other."
"You're not asking me. I'm telling you. We'll keep it a secret, stay out of the public eye. Whatever it takes to be with you, I'll do it."
John started to grasp at straws "It wasn't the baby though Sherlock, you're brilliant and interesting. I'm sorry about the baby but you and I need each other to get through this time, together."
Charlotte looked at him and started laughing. "Oh....if it ism't my perfffect mate." Her words terrible slurred and she flung her arms around David's neck. "I might've had a few drinks."
Sherlock lifted the baby into his arms and yelled after the two twins who ran down the stairs to the second floor of their three story apartment building which Sherlock owned "Don't break anything!" He said.
Charlotte turned towards her Dad. "I spend time with him!"
John nodded his head. "Okay well, the offer stands anytime you want."
Sherlock nodded "I could be persuaded to do that."
After a pause of silence lasted Sherlock speaks again. "I understand that this is a shock and believe me I've thought about this and there's really only one thing that can be done in a situation like ours-"
"Family?" Sherlock said. "I realise that you had a mate but it seems that they're not in the picture anymore."
Sherlock gave a quick look to John and they both shared a small smile "I'm sure. This isn't just about John and I becoming one, it's about all of us becoming a family and I feel Christopher needs to be apart of it. After all he's the one that brought us all together."
John watched him go and took a deep breath before slowly opening the door.
"Yeah." Sherlock groaned. "Things are just a bit uncomfortable right now. I'm told that the second trimester is supposed to be the easiest part but if this is easy I shudder at the thought of my third trimester."
Sherlock folded his arms across his chest "Charlotte feels that going to her ballet rehearsal is more important then keeping her promise to stay with David and Tristan while we go out."
John could cut the tension with a knife. Every step he took towards the bed felt like an eternity. "Sherlock?" John said with a scratchy voice.
Mike and the other lads laughed and started playfully rough housing with each other as they walked off to the locker room to shower and change.
Chloe tossed her long blonde hair and swivelled her hips in a playful manor "But Daddy my shoes could get dirty. I have to inspect my room before I decide where everything goes."
John held Sherlock close and made small moans as each thrust. It was wonderful, each slap of their hips joining them as one and pleasure coursing through their veins. "I'm going to cum." John said.
He was met with silence over the phone then after what seemed like an eternity John spoke again "I don't think that's a good idea. Sherlock doesn't want to see me, he made that very clear with the cut and dry divorce papers."
Violet sat very stiffly, her arms across her chest glaring at the people in her house.
The room was rather small and had two small mattresses on each side of the room, two plain wooden dressers, and one small desk. The walls were white but some of the paint was peeling and black stains from previous tenets scatter the walls. This was absolute horror compared to the palace.
We walked into the old man's shop and there was nothing. No sign of a struggle, no footprints or finger prints, it seemed our tailor friend did indeed up and vanish.
"Nice to meet you." John said gently taking her hand and shaking it.
John stood up “Did you not just hear what I said? Besides, Jim was there and he assured me that it would be fine if I sat one out as long as I gave him permission!”
John was going to open his mouth and ask more about Sherlocks children when Sherlocks phone started ringing.
Sherlock nodded and then a moment of silence happened between them. "My family is going to kill me." He said softly.
__________________________________________________
When you realised it was I that saved you life you just smiled. My God I think that I could be in love with you. You crazy, mad, genius.
John smiled and held out his hand "I'm John."
When the boys started changing again another trainee by the name Andrew called for John's attention. "So you coming out for pizza and the pub after mate?"
He looked over to the cradle that harboured his sleeping son. How could Charlotte say she didn't want their precious baby? That is what hurt him most of all. Their son was a gift and David couldn't imagine life without him.
Charlotte took a deep breath. "My name is Charlotte Lily Watson-Holmes. I am 16 years old and I will be preforming the solo piece from the musical Little Dancer titled In Between."
John snapped from his daydreaming and with a smile on his face said "I will."
John didn't listen "I lovvvve yuuuu." He then proceeded to throw up all over the floor.
Clara, being without filter said "You look uncomfortable."
John smiled widely. "That would be nice, I can't help but feel that everyone is out to get me in some way. It would be nice to have a friend close by."
Sherlock stood in front of John as to shield him from from his family "I was the one to instigate this relationship. John is a willing participant and I will not have it said that's he's a common gold digger."
All I could do was love you, God I loved you, but I know it's not enough.
April 10, 2013
Valerie elbowed her daughter in the side. "We are very proud of John and all his accomplishments." She says trying to cover it up.
Siger turned towards his wife "He shouldn't even be in a relationship in the first place! You are meant to be building your reputation as Future King! Not flouncing around with some whore Omega."
Harry smiled, convinced that she won "Don't forget to come down and do the dishes! Someone has got to prepare you for housework and I know for sure Mum and Da aren't doing it!"
The day came where she would board her plane to travel with the company for their European tour and would also be doing an American tour. For an entire year she would be gone.
John shook his head "Nothing....nothing."
John excepted the invitation "Sounds like fun actually. I'll see if Christopher and Chloe can hold down the fort so as of right now count me in."
Sherlock smiled "Privacy unfortunately is one luxury the royal family cannot afford."
_____________________________________
Charlotte nodded and headed towards the front. It wasn't exactly a bad thing to be called to that bar but you were criticised much more then the others. Charlotte knew it was a ploy to put a sense of fear in her.
"Do it because you want to John not because this is an ultimatum otherwise you will learn nothing."
Sherlock was tired of this conversation, since his children were small they wanted their mother to find an Alpha, not that they craved a Father but they just wanted him to have a companion so he wouldn't look so sad when he thought they weren't looking.
John huffed a laugh and brought his hand up to his face and started rubbing the bridge of his nose. "Sherlock, no. Just no."
Greg suddenly felt a rush of sympathy overcome him and went to kneel before Sherlock putting a comforting hand on his knee "Sherlock....he loves you and you love him. I know he made mistakes, some really bad ones even but I know you two are supposed to be together. You need to understand that not everyone is going to leave you. There are people who love you Sherlock."
Sherlock felt like he was being punched in the gut. "But what about University....John?"
Sherlock grabbed on to John tighter "It burns!!"
Sherlock tried to compose himself and took a gasping breath "I have ten children."
“Captain?” Caleb said raising his hands and standing on his tippy-toes.
Bruce smiled "Well, don't want you getting lazy. Just because you've been in a desert the past three months does not mean you can forget that hard work does a man good!"
The next people they ran into was a slightly older couple. If John would have to guess early-to-mid thirties. One was in a full grey suit and tie, he looked more dressed up the anyone in the room. He had another mans hand on his arm and he looked less formal then anyone in a green button up shirt and grey cardigan, if it wasn't for the slacks John would feel a bit of relief over his own outfit.
Thank God for Tristan. His grandson kept him sane and for all it was worth he was happy that David was with him as well.
Being somewhat called out of their trance the Watsons “Nice to meet you Holmes family.” They said somewhat hesitantly.
Sherlock silenced, this pointless arguing wasn't going to get him anywhere, he just wanted to disappear into his study and fiddle with his microscope. Before that though he knew they needed to discuss the consequences of his actions "So what is it this time? Forbid me to help Lestrade out with security? Lock me in my room until I must assume the throne?"
David caught her just in time before she hit the ground. He kicked off some of Charlottes sick off his feet before carrying her up to her bedroom. He laid her down and started to gently undress her until she was down to her underwear and put a blanket over her.
John blushed at the compliment. "Thank you."
"Yes because lying face down on your bedroom floor in vomit because you overdosed on cocaine is the pure sign of having control!" Siger yelled.
Zachary was fuming "If you Holmes didn't have your heads so far up your arse then maybe you could be normal and not some stupid evolutionary flaw!"
"What the hell? Why not!" John exclaimed.
Sherlock grabbed him by the hand and they were off.
Connor 12- Alpha
John couldn't keep his mind off the kiss. Sure he thought Sherlock attractive but the kiss threw him off. Was it just a moment thing? Was it for real? What would he do if Sherlock felt something for him?
John bitterly laughed. "You know, that is that last thing I want to hear from you right now."
The Professer nodded "In any matter this will be the first and last time you are allowed to be late or else you will find yourself looked out of class."
Greg nodded and turned Sherlock towards the door "Of course. Thank you for your understanding." Greg then lead Sherlock out.
John was getting whiplash from all these emotions "What?! I never said that!"
"I love him Dad." John said.
Sherlock being used to getting down on a child level stared directly into Caleb’s eyes. “Thank you.” He said honestly. “Who might you be?”
"I'm sure. You know I'm sure my mother told you about our families agreement for Sherlock and I but know that I do not think like her. But if you ever need an ear or a rescue from the vultures I am more than happy to be a sounding board for you."
Sherlock went hungrily after John's lips and was soon carding his hand through his hair.
Sherlock smiled "I'm ready as I'll ever be."
"Please John, call me Moriarty. All my friends do."
"I have made peace with the fact that my time has come to give you a strong leader that you deserve. Crowned prince Sherlock will be taking the throne come the end of May which will be in two months. Have have no doubt in my kind that he will be a good and just King as all if you deserve. I know turn the attention over to my son, Prince Sherlock." Siger stepped away from the podium and clapped as everyone else did while Sherlock took the stand.
Sherlock smiled "Want to see some more?"
"What's happening!" Greg said loudly to be heard over all the noise.
John started panicking but stayed where he was "We are supposed to be a family!"
Greg nodded "Yeah. Marriage is full of them and it's obvious this is something that needs to happen. I know you love each other but if you both give a little maybe each party won't be completely put out."
Sherlock watched from the corner and saw John trying to take control of the situation to no avail. Archimedes had begun crying; scared of the loud noises and Killian and Caleb had decided to hide behind his legs.
Greg looked down at his feet and scuffed his shoe against the floor "Well, let's just say that when I was given the opportunity I took it for granted."
Cody 14- Omega
Sherlock was on the verge of shaking "Please sir, I have no intentions of holding John back. I care deeply for your son."
"Yes, Madam." Charlotte said.
Sherlock walked behind a older woman. She looked like Sherlock with her dark hair pulled up and in a simple black dress that hugged her thin frame.
July 17, 2015
John started rubbing his head "No. I just was trying to find the right time."
John looked down "A rather sad look on life."
John cleared his throat "Right, Sherlock."
John was stunned silent.
With just one look I know you know what was going on. Then it became awkward as I try to show I wasn't encouraging this kind of behaviour (but of course I sort of was). I don't want to look whipped in front of this young woman, which is stupid I shouldn't care what she thinks since I can't fuck her anyways. You quickly brushed it aside though.
Chloe tried putting on a smile but it was very condescending “Do you mind putting on something to cover yourself up? I don’t want my younger brothers being subjected to such an immodest attire.”
Before she could show him the picture John looked at his watch "I'm sorry Molly but I have to go or else I'm going to be late. Catch you later?"
David nodded his head. "Obviously whatever she's doing is more important and she'll do nothing but complain all night if we keep her here. I can handle Tristan by myself."
Harry rolled her eyes "I mean come on. He's not nobility and he's not the most dropped dead gorgeous omega. Why him out of all people?"
"Richard please! I just need to speak with him for a few minutes!"
John shrunk back in defeat.
John smiled. Sherlock always knew what to say. "Well then...." he leaned up and gave his teenage love a kiss. "I'll see you later."
The boys hooped and hollered on their way out.
David turned the baby to his shoulder and held him. "Sh...it's alright. I got you mate."
Richard slightly bowed "Thank you sir and Master Sherlock." He gave a kind smile. "I take it you made a friend Master Sherlock."
John wanted to hang his head in shame but stood at attention without flinching even while he was getting yelled at "Loud and clear sir!"
Smith nodded "Yes, Watson. A week after graduation. Normally studies would begin in September but Conner is going to be travelling, giving lectures come September so you'll be getting in early."
Carter nodded his head "Yeah! We're not babies! We can do it."
John paled at the sight. The doctor was prodding at an area he found pleasure in and it was weird to think it be used for medical purposes "Yeah....um....hi...."
Sherlock kissed his head "No need to apologise. We'll get through this together." They kissed once again before joining the family.
John was shocked to hear his best mate talk like this "Sherlock is my husband Michael!"
John smiled “Alright everyone! This is it! John stood next to his children “Attention!” everyone stood straighter and stiffer than before.
John gave a questioning look "What?"
John caught his breath as his eyes began to fog but kept himself together by telling himself this was not the time to become emotional.
John laid down the boxes and walked next to Sherlock and put his hand on his shoulder. Sherlock looked up and smiled seeming to be   unaffected by what was happening around him. "Hello husband." He said kissing John's fingers.
David then spoke. "I have some news for you all."
I've closed our joint bank account as well.
"Oh for Christs sake!" Greg said exasperated and turned his back huffing.
John raised his eyebrows "Thanks but I think I can dress myself. I've been doing it for years now."
John began rocking his hips on the fingers that we're currently inside of him but it didn't quite reach the right spot. "I'm ready Sherlock." He begged. "Please just make love to me."
John walked out to his ROTC class. After the craziness this morning and dealing with Sherlock's morning sickness then having to go through all the paperwork with the University letting them know he would no longer be on campus, it was good to be back in familiar territory.
Mycroft cleared his throat pulling them out of their moment and back in the face of reality. "If you two are done playing house, we need to get back to the matters at hand! Sherlock, this could mean you being disowned! Don't you care?!"
_____________________________________
That question had been haunting him the past few days and hearing it out loud felt like a knife digging into his heart "I don't know." He answered honestly. "He saw his Sargent a few weeks ago and ever since then he's been avoiding me. I think something's wrong but he won't tell me anything. I think he's hiding something..."
It was a moment worth living in. Both bodies seemed to connect and John's thrusts made them give out moans and sighs from shared lips. Kisses where exchanged and at some point Sherlock's hand had found their way to John hair gently pulling on it.
Sherlock almost threw up as well. The pregnancy made his stomach rather weak but he refused to make a bigger mess in the flat.
Sherlock gave a long sigh to calm himself down. He walk towards John and embraced him. “I know this is not the easiest life and a lot is expected of you but please try. There is a lot at stake and I want everyone to love you as much as I do.”
Molly looked at Sherlock who gave her pleading eyes as well. "Alright."
John gave a half laugh "Yes sir."
“Take that back!” Sabian yelled.
John was taken out of his thoughts and looked down at the man who was clearly annoyed with him. "I'm sorry. Just not used to this sort of thing."
Sherlock saw the sincerity in John's eyes. "Can I still snog you?"
Christopher hit his sisters arm and tried to remedy the situation "You look ship shape Dad."
_________________________________________________
The girls softly clapped while Charlotte thought those were 200 girls she had to crush.
"Okay." Clark said noncommittally and continued on his way back to the truck.
"Well, Jim dear. John seems to be having a tough time at it here at the palace I thought it would be good for you to talk, maybe teach him the ropes about a few things" Kathleen said in a no nonsense tone.
For some reason this was the hardest goodbye and she felt like her heart was ripping in two. She kissed Tristan's head "I love you son. Don't forget me okay?"
John helped him by removing his jumper and shirt then began to remove Sherlock's suit jacket. He then started unbuttoning his shirt slowly one right after the other and kissed the spot where the button had been previously.
But for right now nobody needs to know.
I smile so hard it feel like my face will split in two.
Before he could finish Sargent Smith patted his back. "Congratulations Watson." He gave a warm smile.
John nodded and gestured to a table in the corner "Want to grab us those seats so we can catch up a bit?"
Sherlock quickly turned around "John. You nearly have me a heart attack."
"O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; they pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
"This way!" Sherlock shouted as he pushed Johns jumper in his arms.
David shrugged. "It's probably better any ways." He smiled a little trying to make the situation better. "Besides.." He says as he lifted up the baby in the air making him laugh. "I get to spend time with the little guy."
"Compromise?" Sherlock said with a questioning expression.
"They always so forceful?"
Audition day. The day she had been both dreading and excited for.
Greg rolled his eyes "I can't wait until the day you become king and I can tell people about that way you act."
Persephone 16- Omega
Sherlock nodded a thank you "I see that you're still in the military. A Captian it seems. You just been recently restationed in London and it seemed you're here to stay awhile. You've just moved here less then three weeks ago and are still trying to settle."
Sherlock peeked over the counter "Um...." Sherlock thought "To be completely honest I've only had fine wines and aged rums before  and I don't know much about any of...this. So I guess your finest ale."
Sherlock licked his lips. He tried to pull himself together "Because....I'm me....and you're....well....you."
John spoke up "Thank you for all that but we are doing fine all around. Can you just be happy for us?" He looked at his Dad.
Sherlock adjusted himself and tried to sit up but couldn't do it very well with his belly in the way. John then got the hint and helped him. Finally they were face to face. Sherlock then spoke "I wanted to talk to you as well....I felt bad about the way things were handled."
"Oh....hello John." Siger says.
"Oh, so this is John." Greg said shaking John's hand.
"I'm sorry Greg I wasn't paying attention what were you saying?"
John knew it was coming and blew his whistle to quite them all. "Attention!" He yelled.
____________________________________________________________________________________________
"So Johnny!" Stephan said. "Had any good lays lately?"
Charlotte became worried as did her parents but they stayed quiet waiting for David to continue.
John beamed "I missed you too Mum."
"Hello ladies." He greeted with a smile on his face. "Thank you all for showing interest in the company. I'm sure you all have had years of training and have come with your heads held high and the encouragements from your teachers and families that you are good enough to be in this company, yes?" The smile he had quickly faded. "I'm here to tell you they're wrong. You are not good enough to be in this company. You have to prove to me you belong here. We only take the best of the best and if that is not you I suggest you hang up your toe shoes after this audition and say goodbye to your little girl dreams of becoming a dancer."
The girls all curtsied while the boys all bowed “Nice to meet you Holmes family.” They all said in perfect unison.
_______________________________________
"Mycroft, just because you're lonely and suffering doesn't mean you can ridicule John and I for showing affection." Sherlock said defensively.
The first realization that his hopes where stupid was his first trip to Tesco two days after the announcement. His Mum had asked him to pick up a few items as she was in the middle of house work and he wanted to help out. He was looking at a can of beans when the flash happened.
_____________________________________
James walked over "So we were hoping you let John go for the evening. We're having a rugby meet up with some of the guys from the surgical unit."
John made Sherlock meet his gaze by lifting his chin "Don't you think it's worth a try?" John kissed him and he kisses back. It was passionate and desperate but felt wonderful.
John reached across the table and flicked her spoon that was used to launch food at him out of her hand. "Stop it!"
Sorry this is kind of short. But next is the bonding ceremony!
Sherlock not knowing how to act simply nodded "Yes John Watson it's me."
Chloe smiled "Well then Dad. I guess, we'll try our best."
John ran into St. Barts hospital. He was out of breath when he got up to the head nurses counter "Sherlock Holmes room please." He said breathless.
Chloe 16- Omega
Sherlock looked at his watch again and gave up waiting for his husband. He grabbed the mat they purchased for the class and hailed a cab to head over to the facility.
"I know, caring is not an advantage." Sherlock said almost under his breath.
Violet looked to her husband for permission to speak before she started "Actually your father and I have discussed an....alternative if you will."
Kathleen put on her fake smile "Of course you wouldn't dear and you know we al want our little Sherlock to be happy. I'm taking it palace life isn't something you're used to?"
"Sherlock are you listening to me?" Greg said slightly annoyed.
Sherlock shook his head "No, not at all. After you and I parted I got into a little bit of a rough patch in my younger years. I went down a hole of drugs and with the help of my brother Mycroft I was able to get clean again. During that time I felt like something had been missing in my life, I wanted a baby. I didn't have any intention nor want to bond with anyone so I obtained a sperm donor and got pregnant with my first child. After she was born I was content but then I wanted to give her not only a companion but to keep feeling that special feeling of loving someone unconditionally and went again for another round. Around the time my second child was born I had developed close relations with the homeless of London and a young Omega male had given birth to his son but for obvious reasons couldn't give him a life he had wanted for his baby so I adopted him and then so on and so forth. I had five and I adopted the other five."
John turned and nodded. He marched to the door and went through. He was then escorted through the place to the gardens outside. He was out in a private room but through the window he could see the press and some others who were personally invited to the announcement. From what he heard people had their speculations on what was taking place but no one knew for sure what the King was going to say.
Class started the next day and along side a full schedule he also had his job as a barmen at the local pub right by the school. He couldn't complain really he absolutely loved his job at Traders and the owner George was one of his Dad's best mates so he worked with his schedule and treated him well.
"Don't call me stupid, idiot!" Persephone shot back and the arguing continued as they walked to Sherlocks room.
Sherlock immediately shoots up and can't help but smirk at his cheeky husband. "You know...you could help me do a few stretches...."
Sherlock raised his chin.
John shook his head and leaned his forehead against Sherlocks "No, I'm sorry. I'm an idiot."
The next day John came back to the hospital bringing a book and a 'I'm sorry' card. He knew it wasn't much but he had to start somewhere to prove to Sherlock he wanted to make this work.
Sherlock practically sprinted into the stage.
Greg looked concerned "Is he sick?"
Sherlock was confused "Are you....are you serious?"
A tear fell down Sherlock's face "Please don't do this. I'm not what you think. I'm unloveable, selfish, it would never work."
John rarely came home and Sherlock invested all his time and energy into taking care of Tristan. David was sure if it wasn't for the baby Sherlock would have died of a broken heart.
After he had his son settled he went to the bathroom to wash off his feet then proceeded to take the cleaning supples out from under the sink to clean the floor.
John held Sherlocks hand "Me too. I know it's a learning curve with us and our families are no help at all but....I do love you and I want to see this thing through."
Sherlock sighed "No. Every time I bring it up he goes on and on about Scotland this and Scotland that. It's just no use talking to him."
Sherlock kept looking at the door hoping he'd see John come in at any moment but soon class was over and he headed home alone.
"I believe I'm the exception to that rule." Sherlock said walking up the stage.
Violet accepted the challenge that Zachary was giving "And if your son wasn't raised by a Beta nobody, then perhaps he would have gained some manners and tried courting our son before humping him!"
Sherlock looked down at his drink and traced the edge of his glass with his finger "I've been doing well. I'm currently in detective work with Scotland Yard while at the same time taking my own personal clients. I'm a consulting detective so when the police are out of their depth they consult me."
Lately you've been a little stressed with trying to get your book finished by the deadline but I know you'll do it. You've always been brilliant under pressure.
John stopped and scowled at him "Oh really? Then how did you mean it?"
___________________________________________________
John watched as the omega writhed underneath him as he loosened him up so he could take his cock. After adding a few fingers John deemed him ready and lined himself up to Sherlock's opening. "You ready?"
Sherlock stood up trying to see what all the fuss was about and decided to follow Greg as he went to see for himself what was going on.
Just then the door to the theatre closed making John jump. "I'm sorry but the theatre's closed." He called out.
Everyone tells you that the minute you get married everyone woman suddenly find you attractive. Well I'm here to say that's not true.......it only affects the woman you always wanted to sleep with.
---------------------------------------------------
Siger patted John's arm like he was trying to sooth a child "But just because they can doesn't mean they should. While yes, Omegas have made great strides and I am proud to say that England is the forerunner of Omega rights, at what costs must our children suffer while Omegas frill about searching for some dream?"
Sherlock sighed and thought for a second. Maybe they needed a different approach then just reading out loud. He got up and went over to John and pulled the script off his face. "I have an idea." He grabbed John's hand and pulled him up. "We are going to act it out. I will play Romeo and you will be Juliet."
Sherlock so badly wanted to be done now but trying to get it over with quickly he gritted his teeth and made a low grunting sound which turned into a full blown yell as he pushed. "How big is this baby?!"
Judge Peterson looked too Sherlock "And do you Sherlock Holmes take John Watson to be your lawfully wedded husband. To bond together in sickness and in health. To keep house and home as all Omegas have done before you?"
"Okay." David said. He walked Sherlock to the door and closed it behind him. David leaned against the closed door and sighed. "Well little man, it's just you and me."
Valerie shook her head "Well glad that's all behind us. No more running around like that worrying us silly young man. I nearly had a heart attack when I heard your training group was shot at!"
Charlotte and David would be home from school soon and Charlotte promised they would both be there so Sherlock and John could go out for some alone time.
When he entered the room it was completely furnished in light cream colours with very delicate roses painted on the walls and a crystal chandler hanging from the ceiling. The bed was huge with a delicate silk canopy hanging from the top. The room was almost as long as the bottom floor of his house.
_____________________________________
Sherlock smiled into the second kiss he gave him. This was the John he missed and loved so much, it was wonderful having him back.
Greg heard the urgency in Mycrofts voice "What's going on?"
All of the girls confidences diminished with his harsh words. The once bright, smiling faces turned into faces of despair. What if you weren't good enough?
No one talked. Whether it was from the awkwardness of a "commoner" being at the table or the silence bring the norm John just pushed the food around his plate even though it was quite delicious.
"I love you." Sherlock said in an almost whisper.
Sherlock glared but got up and proceeded to the loo to get ready.
He was enjoying sucking Johns neck currently. Every little red mark he smirked at. It was proof that John belonged to him and no one else.
The words bite, more so because they are true. "I don't want to loose you David."
Sherlock cried harder. The baby was the most ugly, wrinkled thing he had ever seen but he loved his son with a fire hotter then he ever imagined. "A son. We have a son John."
Sherlock stopped what he was doing and rolls his eyes at John "Honestly, a man going into the medical field and you're squeamish over the birth of a baby."
John's eyes widened at that. If this wasn't a crowded party then John would hate to find out what a Holmes considered busy. As they walked into the mansion John was immediately taken back. There was a giant crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling and a grand staircase that welcomed you in.
John rolled his eyes "If you take your crown with that same attitude I'm moving to Sweden."
"John this is my son Jim." Kathleen said.
"Put me down!" John shouted. "Sherlock! Make them put me down!"
The officiant began his long speech about love and devotion. Sherlock had tuned him out just staring at John. As much as he hated fanciful thoughts he couldn't help but feel like he was in a dream, here he was about to be bonded with the only person he ever fell in love with. It was almost too good to be true.
"We reconnected at the party and it was wonderful."
John tried to shield his eyes from the constant pictures.
Greg let out a breath, Sherlock was right, in the last eight years that he had known the Omega he had seen how the addition of children that either Sherlock adopted or had, added to the chaos that was already the consulting detectives life. In all honesty when he met the Omega he was surprised that this selfish, childish, man was a parent, much less an Omega parent who had never been bonded.
As he was brushing his teeth the pain came back. He hunched over and grabbed his stomach. He looked at his watch, it had been an hour since the last pain, a sense of fear came back but his mind was telling him to be logical about it, start timing the space in between the pains.
John couldn’t help the smile on his face from the cuteness of his four-year old “Of course solider.”
Sherlock's mouth went dry looking at John. The jumper went perfectly with his skin tone and matched his eyes. Even if it was a little too casual it looked really good on him. "Perfect." Sherlock said as dignified as he could possibly be. "We better go though. Fashionably late is okay, we are boarding on just rude."
Josh swallowed hard "You've been having contractions all morning and didn't bother to say anything?"
The baby started to make an appearance, not enough to be defined as defiantly pregnant but looks as if Sherlock had been indulging on one too many sweets. Sherlock threw the biggest fit when he could no longer fit into his trousers but thankfully his trust fund hadn't been frozen yet so he was able to purchase some new clothing.
"Well let's just say him and I are in sort of a....relationship."
Sherlock was momentarily surprised by the act but then melted into it. Johns tongue tasted like peppermint with a hint of brandy. The taste was so addicting he never wanted it to end.
"Gan'pa!" Tristan exclaimed and jumped into John's arms.
Sherlock nods "Yes it's been a bit."
Charlotte offered a small smile back and headed upstairs to her room where David was putting Tristan down for the night. The young couple looked at each other but did no other greeting. David avoided her gaze and headed downstairs.
(See the end of the chapter for
They both laughed and Sherlock said. "Consider it done."
______________________________________________
John chugged the pint much to the amazement of his friends. After he took a few breaths he spoke "If this is going to be my last crazy night lets make it a good one." John said.
Meredith smiled as she saw John turn this way and that. "He's going to love it. You look absolutely brilliant."
David nodded and picked the baby up gently so he wouldn't wake him and went upstairs.
"Well then change the law!" Sherlock yelled "If we can't do that what the bloody hell are we good for?!"
Zachary stood up from the table "John! I forbid it!"
John followed suit until they reached Greg's office. "Hello boys." He greeted.
As John went to brush some curls from his forehead Sherlock smacked his hand away "What would you know!? You were never there for anything that had to do with the birth of the baby." He let out a moan.
John furrowed his brow "Think highly of yourself do you?"
"Don't worry about that right now John. I'll have someone get it and bring it up to you. It's very late and I think you just need to sleep."
Sherlock called all his children to a family meeting. They sat in a circle so that way no one was superior to the other. Sherlock was breastfeeding Archimedes and cleared his throat.
Charlotte tossed her head back and groaned "I have to go to rehearsal tonight."
Sherlock felt the tell tale signs of another contraction coming on "Don't leave John. I don't want to do this alone."
John couldn't help but laugh at the greeting and patted the Beta's back as they pulled away "Mike, good to see you! How are you?"
Cynthia chimed in "John is not the one to blame here. They are both equally parts guilty. Young minds wonder and things happen."
Sherlock woke up to a sharp pain in his stomach. It took his breath away but it stopped soon afterwards. He took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down. He wasn't due for two more weeks, this was probably false labor like last time.
John stayed awake a little longer running his fingers through Sherlock's hair. Before he drifted off to sleep he laid his hand on Sherlock's stomach, slowly circling the spot which held their baby. John kissed Sherlock's forehead then closed his eyes as well. Both ignorant of what tomorrow might bring.
Before the doors were fully opened Greg entered the room "Your Majesties, his Lordship Mycroft and crowned Prince Sherlock."
Sherlock looked at his brother with wide eyes "What?"
Sherlock walked around to the other side of the table so he could face John. "While I am all for higher education and being at the top of your class I would like the relaxed husband I started out with. That's why you're getting a surprise today."
They decided to meet in between classes in a vacant hallway. It was torture being apart and with John approaching heat they knew they would be separated for a few days and needed to make the most of it.
Everyone started heading for the dining table but John held Sherlock back for a bit. "I'm sorry."
Sherlock
"Oh yeah."
The man with the prince slightly bowed his head "My apologies the Prince's security was somewhat compromised this morning."
Sherlock became blank faced and gave John a glare. "You lied to me." He said plainly to John.
Sherlock looked up and a small snails came on his lips. "You look wonderful as well. I've never seen you more handsome."
John smiled at the praise "Thank you sir."
Valentina and Edelweiss ran off towards their room giggling as Sabian, the eldest of his adopted children, walked in with a book "Mum, it says here that oxidising acids with combustible material may cause a fire. Can we try it?"
"Twenty minutes eh? I'll show you twenty minutes." John then lifts Sherlock in a bridal carry which makes Sherlock burst out in laughter.
Mycroft looked at Sherlock "Yes, brother mine seems like you're hiding something." Mycroft gave Sherlock a sly smile.
John took a deep breath and his heart started racing. What the fuck did he agree to? He couldn't do this! But yet....this was his last chance at happiness.
Dear God if it wasn't for the stupid tracker that Mycroft and installed on their phones he would have just gone to Scotland Yard and not have come to this stupid party. Persephone though vowed that she would track him and make sure he'd stay for the agreed upon two hours.
John reached his hand forward to grab Sherlocks as a thank you.
Darius was wearing a pink shirt and black slacks, preferring to take on a more conservative style then his older sibling. The great thing about being in this family that even though Sherlock may not agree with everything his children did he highly believed that his children should be free to express themselves in any way they saw fit. Growing up in a strict family where boundaries were at every turn he never wanted his children to feel that way.
"Alright. I'll be right back." Sherlock said.
The orders fell on deaf ears and soon even the tight grip that they had of each other's hands wasn't strong enough. John was quickly pushed into the car and was quickly driven out of Sherlock sight.
Greg Lestrade looked frustrated as he tried to talk over the screaming of children that always met him when he came into this house of chaos. "Sherlock I'm serious! You can't just have fun solving crimes there's paperwork that needs to be done!"
Sherlock had been staying with Greg and Mycroft since he left the hospital 6 weeks ago. He was trying to have the will to go back to 221B but every time he did he thought of John and it became to much. To earn some money Greg had hired him at Scotland Yard to be his "secretary" but really he assisted on cases like usual but now it he was getting payed for his work, which was a good thing now.
Sherlock leaned his head up "Next week is the announcement."
Bruce clenched his jaw. "Yeah right. Look laddie. I don't care who you are but you are not to come with in a hundred kilometre radius of my son. I made a promise on the day he was born and we found out that he was an Omega that I would not let anything hold him back from doing what he wants. I have kept that promise and I never plan to break it. I don't care that you're the prince. You could be the bloody pope and I still wouldn't let you in there. Stay away from my son. I want him to do great things and no horny Alpha is going to keep him from that!"
Zachary nodded "You know Violet you're absolutely right."
"Posh? So you want me to what? Where jeans and a t-shirt? Is that the uniform of this establishment?"
Sherlock was smiling at John outside the building "I want to show you what I do. Hopefully it will persuade you to understand why we can't leave London." Without another word he marched into the building.
Sherlock looked at John "Well Romeo is saying that love is blind and can make you do things against your will."
"Sherlock." John said as his breath left his body. He cleared his throat, over taken by emotion. "Where have you been?"
They moved into a spooning position and tried to cuddle up to each other as close as possible. "I love you John." Sherlock said before he closed his eyes and fell asleep.
He started stripping out of his uniform and then checked the time, perhaps he could pick up Sherlock from his last class so they could at least talk for a bit. Before he could talk himself into growing a pair and facing his husband he groaned remembering Sherlock had a doctors appointment today. Well, there went that idea.
He tried waiting up for John at night but soon was overcome by sleep. He didn't hear John come in or get up in the morning. The only sign that he did come home was the ruffled up sheets on the right side of the bed.
Killian smiled and ran off.

John nodded. "I promise I'm not lying."
"Well no matter that's what nannies are for." Violet said handing off her cup to a maid for her to take away. "We'll give John today to recover from his misfortune but tomorrow I will begin to oversee his grooming and preparations for the wedding." Violet held her Alphas hand and smiled "This is going to be such fun."
Sherlock picks up the shattered pieces of glass and it's a cruel irony that his life has become the glass he's trying to clean up, broken and no hope for repair.
John looked up at Sherlock. "Look....please don't get hurt by what I'm about to say...." He then took a deep breath "But....well....we haven't been together very long and my...um...heats are very personal and I'm not ready to share that part of me with someone."
Sherlock starts to cry but because the will to submit is so strong he can do nothing but nod.
Sherlock smiled as he walked the boys to the door "Have fun love!"
So this is actually based off the song Shiska Godess in the musical but since John isn't Jewish and Sherlock is not a woman I just decided to use a line in the song as the title.
Sherlock picked up the script and started to read out loud "Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!"
John held his head high and began "Mum, Dad. I have something I need to tell you."
"Why....why are you.....so cute?" Charlotte said running her hands through his hair. "I just want to fuck you you're so cute."
John turned to the Omega as his parents beckoned him over. "So I guess this is it? This is where we say goodbye?" He said hesitantly.
John was about to rip into his Dad but his Mum put a stop to it. "Zachary stop." Cynthia approached her son and grabbed her keys "Need a ride to the airport?"
It's a sad realisation when the child you loved and supported all these years becomes someone you don't even recognise and can't wait for the day she leaves so there can be peace in your own home again.
Sherlock tried shaking him a little harder "John...."
---------------------------------------------
Sherlock tried to speak "I was only-"
John was dazed "Yeah I'm....I'm fine."
"How are things going with John?"
"Mm....her name was Mary Morstan."
Trying to recover from the pain he nodded "This baby seems to be mad at me for sitting down too long." He tried to joke.
John was stepping in for the queen to oversee a donation being made to the hospital to expand the cancer wing. While normally he would be more than happy to be involved his grades had been slipping due to the pressing need to be available at any given time to the crown. His professors have been kind enough to be understanding but that kindness was starting to dry up.
Greg shook his head "No, it's fine. Um...." Greg tried collecting his thoughts "Mycroft and I were newly bonded and married and things happened and I had gotten pregnant. He was just starting out in the government and I was dedicated to being on the force. We decided together that kids could wait so....I got rid of it...."
"I love you." John said breathlessly.
The next day getting out of bed for Sherlock was impossible. It wasn't so much the fact he was tired it was more a fact being a slave to a schedule. He was so used to doing things on his own time that having to be on someone else's schedule was punishment in and of itself.
Sherlock had tucked him to the bed and slid behind him. He kissed the side of Johns head "I love you."

"One or nothing." John said in a no nonsense tone.
John looked at Charlotte with wide eyes. "Is this true?"
Sherlock looked out the window once the black car he was in stopped. He vaguely noticed a young man who jumped back when he wasn't paying attention and almost ran into the car but the memory was fleeting and he could care less.
