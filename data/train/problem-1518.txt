” Sherlock said again, pulling his knees to his chest and lying his head on them. Mycroft sighed, then motioned with his head for John to join him in the kitchen.
"So waterboarding me was okay?" Sherlock snapped, swinging his legs over the side of the couch. His head pounded with a hangover; looking down, he found a needle still sticking out from his arm. He plucked it out, tossing it onto the table.
“I wasn’t aware we were officially dating,” Sherlock couldn’t help but counter, his wit too quick for his mouth to block.
Sherlock pulled back, his eyes glinting slightly. John gaped at him in wonderment as Sherlock took his hand, guiding him over to the bed and pushing him down onto it. He stripped in front of John slowly, pulling his shirt over his head and dropping his jeans with swift hands. He straddled John slowly, smirking as John gasped.
“Sherlock, answer your damn phone. It’s been six hours since you’ve left, and it’s getting late. I’m worried.” John hit the ‘end call’ button and tossed his phone onto the couch, downing the rest of his tea in a desperate attempt to soothe his anxiety. His phone rang; he jumped to get it, hitting the ‘answer’ button without even seeing who it was first.
"Time to change your bag," she said. Sherlock turned from his side onto his back, pulling up his gown. John looked away.
At twelve thirty, John swallowed his anxiety and boldly walked into the Undead Ink tattoo shop. The girl at the desk - covered in so many tattoos there wasn’t any bare skin left - arched a pierced eyebrow at him. “Can I help you?”
John looked up, startled. It was the first time Sherlock had spoken in the week and a half since he'd been admitted to the hospital. Now it was John's turn to stare at him.
Sherlock’s cheeks flushed. “That’s not necessary, John.” He was heaving, out of breath as well, although his sounded a lot more laboured. John’s eyebrows knit together as he watched Sherlock sit on the couch, trying to catch his breath.
“I can bite,” Sherlock growled, casting his eyes towards John at last. “Make no mistake in that regard, John.”
And with that, he slipped inside the bedroom, slamming the door and locking it and leaving John looking dumbfounded. John, defeated, took himself to bed - only to hear the same chorus of moaning and thumping a few hours later.
“Fine,” Sherlock muttered, pulling a baggie from his jean pocket and pouring it into the spoon. Picking it up, he leaned back against the wall and lit his lighter, holding it with ease underneath the spoon’s curve. He was avoiding John’s gaze.
“Fuck,” John muttered, his hips rolling upwards to meet Sherlock’s. He was positively panting now. “Sherlock, we shouldn’t be - “
“He seems quite smitten with you, John.” Mycroft said, low enough that Sherlock couldn’t hear. His eyes were the same color blue, only like ice, with no warmth. “If you hurt him, there will be consequences. Understood?”
"John," Sherlock said again, blushing as he arched into the contact. John sucked for another moment or so before moving downward again, nuzzling Sherlock's cock and running his tongue along the shaft. Sherlock gasped and arched yet again, hardening quickly.
"I'm getting clean of all that," Sherlock murmured, kissing him again, his hands on James' chest. James' smirk faded, his hand reaching up and circling Sherlock's wrist with an iron-tight grip.
Sherlock took his cup of coffee and pack of cigarettes to the roof of the Baker Street building, watching the sunset as he smoked his morning cigarette. It was a routine he had gotten into at rehab - something about mindfulness and finding gratitude. He was a bit surprised when John joined him.
"Someone's made a mess of himself," John smirked, then kissed him, hard and passionate yet gentle, a mark of ownership, of acceptance. Sherlock shuddered, submitting to it, still trying to catch his breath.
“It’s not about us being together, John.” Sherlock explained, smirking slightly. “Even if we weren’t together, I’d let you stay at the flat. It’s too big for one person anyway. Now, would you like me to go there with you tonight and help you pack?” They came to a halt outside of Speedy’s; Sherlock lingered on the curb to finish his cigarette.
John nodded slowly, too tired to argue with her. When he moved his way through the living room, he and Sherlock said nothing to each other as John left.
“No, shit, no.” He muttered, fumbling in the drawer under the counter for more gauze as blood poured from his wound and down his side in a steady stream. “No, c’mon, fuck.” He hastily pressed the fresh gauze to his abdomen, applying pressure as best he could with one hand as his other hand fumbled for tape. Ripping the tape off with his teeth, he pressed it onto the gauze and smoothed it over, trying to blink away his light-headedness and praying that the bleeding would stop soon.
"Sherlock, God, fuck - " John leaned one hand against the wall behind Sherlock for support, eyelids fluttering, "Oh, fuck - "
Sherrinford looked young as ever - bright and shiny and new, his golden curls perfect, the eyeliner he wore curved into an impeccable wing on either side.
John left the bed, making his way downstairs to the main floor of the flat. The living room was modest - a writing desk, a soft-looking burgundy chair, and a fireplace surrounded on either side by two full bookcases. Above the mantel was a cow’s skull with earphones, and below that was a pile of mail stuck to the mantelpiece with a large knife. On the table beside the burgundy chair lay an open violin case and a handsome mahogany violin, complete with bow and rosin. On the floor lay several chemistry textbooks and cold case files.
Sherlock nodded, not taking his eyes off the screen in front of him. John smiled to himself and left the flat.
“This is it,” John murmured, a few hours later as he let Sherlock into his flat. “It’s a lot smaller than Baker Street, mind you.”
“Come on,” John said, pulling into a parking spot on the street outside of 221B. He got out and opened Sherlock’s door for him, letting the gangly twenty-year-old lean on him as they made their way into the flat. Managing to get up the stairs, John deposited Sherlock’s lanky figure onto the bed, noting that it looked barely-used. He made sure Sherlock was in the recovery position - on his side, legs crossed, mouth unobstructed - and made to leave.
“Please what, love?” John’s hand quickened, Sherlock’s whimpers pitching higher and higher as John increased the pressure.
A few days passed without incident since their talk, days filled with flirting and conversation about the most philosophical topics John could think to ask, Sherlock showing off his deduction abilities any time the talk between them fell into a lull.
Sherlock sniffled loudly. John looked away, feeling as though he were intruding on a very special moment that he shouldn’t be.
"You hungry?" John asked him, bringing him his tea. Sherlock shook his head silently, setting the tea on the coffee table without taking a drink. John watched him for a moment, then took a seat in his own chair. Sherlock turned on the television, watching it unseeingly.
“Just for a few years, when I was younger.” John nodded, stiffening as Sherlock moved the needle towards him. He squirmed.
“Who said I didn’t want to pursue a relationship with you anymore?” John retorted, crossing his arms with a frown.
And now, in another few short months, they were going to be married. John allowed himself to smile at the thought as he sat back and opened his book. Him, a jumper-wearing medical student, marrying the flirtatious and punk Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock even put up with Harry. And John found himself part of the foster family of Lestrade, Mycroft and Sherlock. He liked it.
That got a reaction, Sherlock’s eyes snapping open, his pupils blown wide as he got ten times wetter, slickness spilling over John’s finger. John eagerly lapped it up, his tongue folding expertly into Sherlock’s hole, engulfing his cock all in one action. Sherlock gasped and quivered, squeezing his legs shut; John pushed them apart with his hands, his tongue working furiously as he sucked on Sherlock’s cock.
The rest of the day in the flower shop passed by mostly uneventful, with a few customers every now and then and Sherlock bringing him coffee a few hours before their shifts were over. When it was time for John to close up shop, he locked the front door and then went across the street to Undead Ink.
After a few minutes, Molly managed to find a salvageable vein and drew some blood, putting it to the side before bandaging his arm.
"I thought you were getting clean," Sebastian didn't turn his chair around or even look up from his desk.
"Don't you have a date with Mary tonight?" Sherlock asked him pointedly, not looking at him. "Or anywhere to be besides here?"
“Only if it involves a date in the bathroom.” His voice came out smoother than he could have ever imagined; he put on a smirk. John rolled his eyes.
"So it has nothing to do with your boyfriend - slash - pimp?" Molly arched an eyebrow at him. When Sherlock avoided her gaze, she slapped him on the arm.
“I don’t know,” John murmured, taking the fold-out chair and settling in next to Sherlock at the desk. “When’s your first appointment?”
“Over the last twenty four hours, not all at once.” Sherlock scoffed. “Mostly cocaine and whisky, though.” He swayed on the spot, falling into a fit of giggles.
“It doesn’t appear so, but the surgery did cause the fetus to go into mild distress,” the nurse explained. “There is a very, very slim chance of losing the baby, but it is possible. We just wanted to know if this was planned and wanted.”
They finished their coffee and threw their garbage away, walking together back towards Bart's. Sherlock found that he wasn't nervous or full of dread - like he inexplicably already knew the results. Still, he flashed Molly an uneasy smile as they stepped onto the elevator and ascended their way towards the sampling lab.
“It is what it is.” His food arrived, carried by a kind-looking waitress with teased up hair. “Tell me more about being Lestrade’s foster kid.”
"You know where to find me for my services," Sherlock drawled, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. He stalled in tying his boots, waiting for Stewart to leave first before he finished getting dressed himself and headed out of the flat.
Sherlock stared at the ground as he smoked, thinking of his brother. Oh, how disappointed Mycroft would be in him now.
“You didn’t think to ask him?” Mycroft murmured, his eyes boring into John. “He’s not stable enough to handle this kind of thing, John. Not with the trauma he’s endured.”
"Please fuck me," he managed, whimpering, and John kissed him slow and hard before removing his fingers and replacing them with himself, pushing into Sherlock slowly and gently.
Sherlock shrugged, standing and pulling his denim jacket from the back of his chair before pulling it on. “Sure.”
“Your attitude, and your style, and your smoking, and your mysteriousness.” John seemed to be talking to himself, glancing occasionally at the stars above as he did so.
"I want to make sure you're getting tested," John said quickly. Sherlock stared at him, cheeks flushing.
Sherlock shut him up with a hot and heavy kiss, his fingers threading through John’s hair. After a moment he detached himself and stood - John let out a whine at the loss despite himself, eyes going wide as Sherlock dropped to his knees in front of John’s chair.
“We’ll worry about that after dinner,” John replied. They waited for their food to arrive. When it did, they ate in comfortable silence.
"Shh," Sherlock murmured, climbing into the bed with him and kissing him softly, hiking one leg up and over John's middle so that he was on John's lap. He took the book in his hands and folded it closed, setting it to the side before kissing John again, gently, his fingers threading through the hair at the nape of John's neck.
Sherlock laid back in bed and lit a cigarette, taking the cash the man handed him and setting it down beside him as the other got dressed.
“He wants nothing more than to hurt Sherlock.” Mycroft replied. “And he’s got numerous ways of doing so.”
Sherlock’s flat wasn’t too far from Angelo’s, only about a ten minute walk. Sherlock lit a cigarette, stealing glances at John in the darkness as they walked.
“Just because I’m being vulnerable and no longer hiding behind a ‘cool kid’ exterior?” Sherlock muttered into his beer, not looking up. “Sorry to disappoint you, John.”
“Sherlock,” Mycroft began, casting a dark look at John before continuing. “The wound you sustained caused the baby some distress.”
But Sherlock was on his feet in an instant, yanking the paper from Molly's hand and scanning over it rapidly. When he got to the bottom - the positive results Molly hadn't mentioned - he let out a derisive laugh and threw the sheet onto the nearest table, shoving his hands into his pockets. Molly grabbed it before either John or Mycroft could read it, voice hushed as she followed Sherlock, who began to pace the room like a caged animal.
“Just in case?” Sherlock looked momentarily confused, until a flicker of understanding softened his gaze. “John.”
“Well, it was nice to see you John. Tell Sherlock I’m looking for him next time you see him?” Lestrade made his way towards the door.
“Don’t care,” John replied, running his tongue broadly up Sherlock’s folds and taking Sherlock’s rock-solid cock into his mouth. Sherlock made another obscene noise, his head falling back. John sucked hard, his tongue swiping against the head, then pulled back, his finger circling Sherlock’s entrance. “If only your brother could see you now.”
“Well, wuss or not, that’s what would happen.” He felt Sherlock’s foot rub against the inside of his leg. He took a drink of his coffee to hide his ever-reddening cheeks, heat creeping up the back of his neck as Sherlock’s foot crept up further and further.
Sherlock let them into the flat, throwing his keys onto the floor before kicking off his boots. John peeled off his jacket, watching Sherlock pad over to his chair and curl up in it.
"Sure," Sherlock shrugged nonchalantly, not looking at him. "It's whatever, John. It's fine. Stay as long as you need."
"Oh, and Johnny boy," the man called, making John stop at the front door with his hand on the doorknob. "I wouldn't suggest calling dear old Mycroft, not if you want Sherlock to stay alive."
Sherlock jumped, head snapping up to see the flower shop boy. He was wearing khakis and a soft-looking jumper, his sandy hair combed handsomely to the side. He was looking at Sherlock with those warm brown eyes.
When they got home, John went into the kitchen to make tea and Sherlock went to the kitchen table to check on his various experiments. The two worked in comfortable silence; this was their routine now, work and then home. Home. John thought about the word for a moment. Yes, home was where his love resided, wherever Sherlock was. Wherever Sherlock laid his head was where John wanted to be.
"We're not in a rush, Sherlock," John murmured into his ear, running his tongue along the long, pale expanse of Sherlock's throat. "But I love how eager you are to please."
“I know, love.” John replied, crossing the space between them and kissing Sherlock softly. “Let’s just go, yeah?”
“I’m good,” Sherlock breathed, nodding as he pushed past Tony and made his way back to the cubicle. He didn’t look at John, instead going straight to the bottom left-hand drawer of the cubicle desk and pulling out a thick, cable-knit black jumper. After a moment of wonderment, John realised it was his own, watching Sherlock pull it on and push up the sleeves as if it were the most casual thing in the world.
Sherlock was discharged a few days later, with the promise that he would take all of his antibiotics and stay in Baker Street on bedrest with John to look after him. John felt something was different; Sherlock shuffled around the house in sweatpants and one of Mycroft’s old Oxford hoodies, his eyes downcast, his body language stiff, sad almost. He sulked on the couch and didn’t eat much; he only spoke to correct the telly, refused any tea John offered him, and slept for the majority of the day. John started to become worried when he found empty beer bottles underneath their bed.
"I don't believe that's any of your business," Sherlock replied, the back of his neck going slightly pink.
John used one hand to pull at Sherlock’s sleeves, examining the bruises scattered along his arms quietly.
"Hey," John took him by the arm and turned him round again, kissing him once more for only a second or two before pulling away as he stood. "Come downstairs for some breakfast, alright?"
“Sherlock?” John murmured around the bulge, nuzzling it with his cheek. “Has anyone ever blown you before?”
"I've gotta go,"  he muttered, watching her for a moment in return. "Do you have John's new address by chance?"
That didn't stop Sherrinford from surveying him like prey,  a smirk on his lips as he peered at Sherlock over the top of his wine glass.
"Look, Sherlock, it's okay if you don't know. I can take you, actually, right now - we can go to Bart's, have Molly run the test."
"This is about you two sleeping together and him not telling you he remembered because he doesn't reciprocate your feelings for him."
Sherlock stared out of his window quietly. John shook his head and started the car. They drove to Baker Street in silence.
Sherlock leaned back against the crease of the couch, trying not to lose his consciousness. He closed his eyes - sleep, just for a few minutes, until John gets home.
“Work,” Sherlock replied in his baritone voice, sounding already bored with the day that had just begun.
“I am...scared, that once you...engage in intimacy with me, you will no longer see me as a man.” Sherlock said quietly to his mug of tea. “Not to mention, I have never...received, before. I’m afraid I’m going to be bad at it.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened, his breath quickening in anticipation, his fingers shaking as they threaded again through John’s hair.
“I didn’t know he could still get pregnant,” John muttered, running his hands nervously through his hair. “I didn’t...I mean..”
“Oh,” John looked away, training his eyes anywhere but Sherlock’s. “Erm. For, you know. Just in case.”
"It's better if I say this out here," Sherlock insisted. John let out a huff and joined him on the asphalt.
Sherlock nodded, sniffling into his blanket, eyes bloodshot and pupils dilated. Lestrade wandered over, running his hand through Sherlock’s curls once before sitting down on the couch. Mycroft joined him, seeming to take careful consideration of the distance between them. They waited in silence until the drug squad arrived. Sherlock stood, almost losing balance, before shuffling his way over to John and burying his still very wet face in John’s neck. John rubbed his back, watching as the team of people took everything away.
Mycroft looked him over as he set the now-empty pitcher onto the coffee table. "I was running out of ways to try and wake you up, brother mine."
"I don't want to see you for a couple of days, alright? Even for a junkie, you're fucked on it. Cut back a little."
John knocked three times on the door of 221B. It was a minute or so before the door opened, revealing Sherlock, lanky as ever, in a hoodie with the sleeves pushed up and sweatpants. He looked like shit again, all the weight he had gained from rehab now gone; his hair desperately needed a cut, there were dark purple bags under his eyes and track marks littering the inside of both his elbows. A large gash on his forehead was crudely stapled shut and oozing. Sherlock squinted at John for a moment.
"Him beating you constitutes you being happy?" Mycroft followed him, arching an incredulous eyebrow. "At some point you have to stop wallowing in your self-will and surrender, Sherlock. Accept the help I'm trying to offer you."
But yes, there was. The noises he was hearing was undoubtedly moaning - loud, erotic moaning and the squeaking of bedsprings, coming from his flatmate's bedroom at - John glanced at the clock on the bedside table - two in the morning. His frown only deepened. There was no way Sherlock - the least sexual being on the planet - could be having sex at two in the morning. That just wasn't something Sherlock did, no matter how off his roommate had been acting lately.
“You think you’re the only boyfriend he’s had?” She called to John. “Only the others weren’t nearly as nice, mind you.”
“You’re beautiful,” John murmured, his hips moving slow and methodical. Sherlock’s pale skin glinted in the light, sweat running down his neck. John’s tongue darted out and grabbed it, running itself up the column of ivory and nibbling on Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock’s hitched as he moaned, rocking, his hands threading through John’s hair.
Mycroft blinked, surprised by the sudden politeness of his usually surly little brother. “Sure, thanks.”
John was hidden in the closet just as the bedroom door opened. John held his breath, listening; the man was whispering sweet nothings, ignoring Sherlock's whimpers of protest. The bedsprings began squeaking just a few minutes later and John's stomach twisted; it was nothing like what had just transpired. He could hear Sherlock crying, trying to hold back whimpers and yelps of pain; he heard the man mutter something, then the sound of palm hitting face and the bedspring squeaking becoming faster. John felt like he was going to be sick.
Sherlock turned his head to face the wall, heart pounding in his chest. After several minutes of silence John finally left, closing the door behind him and plunging the bedroom into darkness. Sherlock felt hot tears roll down his cheeks.
John was out of the room in seconds, leaving Sherlock standing there staring at his feet. John flipped on the bathroom light and pulled the drawer out, bending over to look at the underside. True to Sherlock’s word, there were two razor blades and a baggie of white powder taped to the wood. He tugged them out carefully as Sherlock came to a halt in the doorway, his face pale. They made eye contact once again as John dropped the contraband into the toilet, flushing it with more force than necessary.
“Sure.” He licked his lips nervously. “But if you’re gonna take me to lunch, I should at least get to know your name.”
A loud, whimpering moan let John know otherwise. He groaned internally and rolled over onto his stomach, suddenly desperate to get back to sleep.
“John.” His fingers threaded through John’s blond hair and tugged, a moan escaping from somewhere deep in his throat.
When he finally did come home - after a consecutive seventy two hours of John being worried out of his mind - stumbling through the front door and nearly tripping on his feet, squinting, John was in his chair waiting for him. He jumped to his feet, striding over as Sherlock struggled to shut the door properly.
Sherlock groaned before he opened his eyes, cursing the sun out loud as it’s rays streamed in through the living room window. He sat up slowly, his head pounding, and reached for the glass of water on the coffee table. Everything hurt.
“Can I at least know his name?” John asked sweetly, batting his eyelashes at Sherlock. Sherlock met his gaze and sighed dramatically.
He saw Sherlock again that night, curled up on the couch with a blanket thrown over him, knees pulled to his chest and watching crap telly. He didn't look up as John came in.
"You have no proof he did anything," Sherlock reminded him. "You can't have him arrested or killed or anything of that nature, right? Just let me and my boyfriend be happy."
Sherlock nodded without saying a word and sauntered back out of the shop, staring contemplatively into his own coffee cup as he did so. Smiling to himself, John took a sip of the coffee Sherlock had given him, then chuckled. Vanilla flavored.
“If you say so,” John chuckled, pouring a splash of cream into his coffee. Sherlock was watching him, a gentle smile playing on his lips.
Sherlock lit a cigarette the second they stepped onto the pavement. “Yes, I am. Quite proud of it, too.”
“My father moved to the States and took me with him, right after the first abortion.” Sherlock murmured. “I had managed to save enough money to run away to London by the time I was fifteen, but after I got here I realised that I was pregnant again. I was still homeless at the time; afterwards is when Lestrade took me in. When I was seventeen, my father came to visit me from the states; Mycroft and Lestrade tried to keep him away, but I…” He paused, looking away. “Anyway, he did what he did and then left for the states again. That’s when I got into drugs, after the third one.”
The doorbell rang a few hours later. Sherlock, seated at the couch with crap telly on and a pack of cigarette sitting at his side, turned to glare at it.
"No," John shook his head and helped himself to some of the wine. "Killed herself when Sherlock was a baby. Not that I can blame her, seeing the absolute monster she was married to."
"I'll go right now, love," John kissed Sherlock's forehead before pulling on his jacket. "You'll be okay by yourself for a minute?"
Sherlock nodded slowly, nuzzling John softly for a moment before they made their way towards the door.
John shook his head. "This doesn't mean I'm just leaving your life, Sherlock. Just because we can't have sex or whatever anymore doesn't mean I'm going to stand by while that douchebag - "
“I thought you liked it?” John could feel Sherlock smirking against his neck, his hand pressing against the parting of John’s legs firmly. John’s eyelids fluttered.
"I left them with somebody at the sample testing lab, we should have results in about an hour. No worries, I kept the specimen anonymous." He stood, legs a little weak, and followed her from the lab, feeling nauseous for multiple reasons. They walked to a small coffee shop not far from the hospital, where he begrudgingly let her buy him lunch.
Sherlock's heart began to beat very fast. He stared down at the ring with his mouth agape, at a loss for words.
“Just forget about them,” Sherlock mumbled, reaching down and pulling his boxers up so that the cuts were covered. He stood, moving past John to where his ripped jeans were and tugging them back on, buttoning them without looking at his boyfriend.
“I’ll make sure he stays incarcerated, Sherlock.” Mycroft said quietly, looking Sherlock in the eyes. “I’ll even make sure he’s dead, if I have to, but you have to get clean. There’s only so much your body can take before it gives out.”
“Let me repay your lunch with dinner. Friday? I know this great place, and I know the owner so we can eat for free.”
Sherlock dropped his eyes down to his plate, his food mostly untouched. Just two more days, two more days of Sherrinford crawling into bed with him, two more days of enduring the pain and humiliation and then he would get to go home, back to his flat, back to his own world and work on getting his life together. Two more days.
He stared, his heart hammering in his chest. Below the first line was a note, supposedly from his donor:
“I know it was you,” John shook his head. “SH? Sherlock Holmes? How come you didn’t tell me you came from the Holmes family?”
"I don't want it 'taken care of'," hmmm Sherlock huffed, shaking his head. "Look, it's my business. What John and Myc don't know won't hurt them, oh yes clearly none of this is hurting them and I can handle it on my own. It's under control, okay?"
"It's not what you think it is," Sherlock said quickly, just as their ticket number was called. Molly got up and returned seconds later with their baskets of food. Sherlock ran one of his long, thin fingers around the lip of his cup's lid, unsure what to say.
"He's moving out," Sherlock said curtly just as the needle pierced his skin. He let out a small sigh of ecstasy.
After a little while he looked up at Sherlock, engrossed in the notes, and smiled; this was what he had to look forward to for forever.
“So you haven’t got a…” John trailed off, leaning back in his seat as he examined Sherlock more closely.
"What's your point, Mycroft? You're moving up in the world while your little brother remains a dumpsterfire?"
“Sherlock,” he sighed, walking into the living room to find Sherlock nursing a beer on the couch. “C’mon, love.” He gently pulled the bottle from Sherlock’s hand; Sherlock didn’t protest, instead staring blankly at the telly.
Sherlock wouldn't or couldn't listen, however; he scrambled towards the wall and curled up there, breathing heavily like a scared, wounded animal. John pulled his mobile from his pocket and sent a two-worded text: "284 Abernathy."
“And as such deductions are being made, might I point out how glaringly obvious it is that you and John have had sexual relations since the last time Lestrade and I were here?” Mycroft shot back, leaning against his umbrella.
"Anyway," John leaned against the counter and crossed his arms. "I can't do anything about Sherlock, Molly. Not by myself, and that absolute stupid fucking cocksucker said if I went to Mycroft, he'd kill Sherlock."
Sherlock let out a huff of annoyance and dug into his jean pocket, producing the bills accordingly. Sebastian took the money and filed it away, stuffed Sherlock's product in a bag, and tossed it to him.
"Well, what else did you take? Who have you been with? You can't just disappear for days on end without - "
Sherlock grabbed an empty box and wandered over to the desk as John finished up the box he was working on. He heard Sherlock open a drawer, and then there was a very tense pause.
With a small groan, he let go of John's waist and made his way slowly back to the desk, his tongue thick and dry. He pulled up the email from the client of his next appointment and printed off the attached tattoo design. John took up residence in his fold out chair once again, opening his textbooks to work on his homework and keeping a careful but discreet eye on Sherlock. The rest of the day passed uneventful, although the entire time, John’s mind whirled with the new information about Sherlock’s past.
When the search of the entire flat came up empty, John threw the hood of his jacket up against the rain and made his way down to the condemned house on Westminster street. He shoved his way past the doorkeeper and up the stairs, throwing open the door to the bedroom only to find Seb on the bed, a naked girl riding him.
He was the first one awake the next morning, halfway through his eggs and coffee when Sherlock finally stumbled into the kitchen, blinking against the sunlight streaming in. Fighting to keep his face passive, John stared into his eggs and chewed for a moment as Sherlock made a cup of coffee for himself.
“We both know it was that bastard that caused it,” John snapped. Mycroft was prepared to retort when they were interrupted by an orderly.
John didn’t realize he was staring until Sherlock’s bright green eyes were staring back at him. He blinked and shook himself, pulling his attention back to the book he held in his hands, gaze sliding out of the words distractedly. It was going to be a longer day than usual.
John sighed, following Sherlock into the latter's bedroom. "I was trying to find a way to let you down easy, Sherlock - "
He took John into his mouth, staring up at him with the best innocent look he could muster with a mouthful of cock. John was happy to actively participate this time, thrusting in and out slowly, his fingers tugging Sherlock's hair.
“I was visiting Mycroft.” Sherlock muttered, and John noticed his hand was shaking. He began his way towards the bathroom. “I need a minute.”
Sherlock reached over and grabbed the beer from the table, taking a large swig of it. “It’s just transport, John.”
"Come on love," John said after a week of this, taking Sherlock by the hand. Sherlock let himself be led back to the bedroom, where John put him to bed and then laid out beside him. Sherlock stared at him quietly, not saying anything for a moment, then burrowed closer; he put his head on John's chest and got as close as possible.  He slung a possessive arm around John's middle and was asleep in minutes. John let his hand card through Sherlock's hair, breathing in the other's scent of pine, cigarette smoke and fresh ink. He thought about what a wild rollercoaster the past few months had been, from finding out about Sherlock;s shitty boyfriend to discovering Sherlock felt the same way. Had felt the same way, all these months and years. John thought about all the time that had been wasted.  He combed his fingers through Sherlock's hair, closing his eyes. He was asleep in minutes as well.
“That’s one of the most painful places,” Sherlock chided, his eyes roving over John’s exposed torso, falling on the scar on John’s shoulder. “But if you insist.”
“You’ve been sleeping all day, Sherlock.” John said, but only got a soft snore in reply. He sighed, watching his boyfriend for a moment before resigning himself back to the kitchen.
He winked before he slipped back into the flower shop. Sherlock finished his cigarette with a fluttering stomach.
“I was thinking Speedy’s,” John replied as they left the shop together. Sherlock nodded in agreement and lit a cigarette.
When he awoke from his third nightmare that night it was to find John silhouetted in his doorway, watching him. Sherlock, pouring sweat, met his gaze.
“Let ‘im go, Dad.” Sherlock mumbled drunkenly from the couch again, where he had sat up, his face screwed up tight. Lestrade turned to him, letting go of John’s shoulder slowly as his face softened.
"Fuck," he hissed, grabbing at his arm. He had missed the vein, nicking it instead; blood ran down his arm towards his hand.
He reached out and stroked Sherlock's cheek. Sherlock closed his eyes, looking like he might be sick. John found he couldn't look at his former flatmate, opting instead to stare at the floor as he spoke to Sherlock directly.
e sight of something new caught his attention. A head full of brunette, lazy curls, slightly trimmed. The head turned and revealed its face - an angular, pale canvas punctuated with miscellaneous studs and rings. Bright green eyes that snapped around and met John’s, the beautiful smile fading almost instantly. The man - teen, really, he couldn’t have been older than twenty - turned halfway and said something to one of the other artists. A different artist replied. Smirking, the teen turned back towards John and slowly gave him the bird.
Molly's gaze had become fixated on the bruises around Sherlock's wrists. With another sniffle, he pulled on his sleeves to hide them.
The two made eye contact. John's tongue was in his cheek and he crossed his arms. Sherlock sighed heavily.
“I’m trans,” he spit out, letting the words fall from his throat jaggedly. John stared at him, the tension stretching in the silence between them.
“Thanks for dinner,” he rushed out, before turning on the heel of his boot and starting towards the door of his flat. John watched the sway of his hips as he went, his head spinning, dizzy from the taste of Sherlock’s mouth and the incredibly strong scent of whiskey on Sherlock’s breath. Shaking his head slowly, he turned around and ambled his way to his car.
“Suicide,” Sherlock said matter-of-factly, returning to the desk to work on the stencil for John’s tattoo. “Attempted murder suicide, to be correct.”
"Thank you, Molly," Sherlock pressed a gentle kiss to her cheek. He turned and shook Thomas' hand. "And of course it's lovely to meet you. Can I get you anything to drink?"
“Shut up,” John murmured with a grin, his hand moving between them and swiping across the tip of Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock gasped in surprise, his hips bucking instinctively, the hand in John’s hair tugging hard. John smirked and did it again, noting the way Sherlock’s stomach sucked in and his breath quivered. “Like that?”
“We’re definitely late now,” Sherlock murmured weakly, forehead shining with sweat. His legs were shaking. “That was worth it, though.”
“Here,” John said gently, helping Sherlock wiggle out of the binder. He plucked the Oxford hoodie off of the bedroom floor and handed it to him, keeping his eyes averted as Sherlock tugged it on. He unbuttoned Sherlock’s trousers and slipped them off, then helped Sherlock fold his impossibly long legs onto the bed.
“Our waiter,” Sherlock said, as they sat at Angelo’s on Friday night. “Is into BDSM and dominant women.”
“Is this okay?” John asked, surprised but pleased to see that it was Sherlock blushing for goddamn once.
When he woke up it was to find himself alone. He pushed down the panic rising in his chest and got up, checking first the bathroom, then the living room, then the kitchen. It was the last place that he found Sherlock, standing out the counter with a plateful of cake, shoveling it into his mouth with a fork.  He looked up as John came in. It was the first thing John had seen Sherlock eat since coming home from the hospital. He looked pretty adorable, with chocolate smeared around the outside of his lip just a bit. He paused when John walked into the kitchen.
“I considered the chances of that minimal based on what I knew of the extent of the injury at the time.”
When they were full, John cleared away their dishes and Sherlock set about reading old case notes, curled up on the couch. John joined him after putting the dishes in the sink, pulling a book down from the shelves and settling into his chair.
Sherlock ignored the way his heart fluttered and turned to stare at the horizon again, taking a long draw off his cigarette.
“Let me change your dressing before we leave,” John made his way to the hallway bathroom to retrieve the first aid kit. When he returned, Sherlock had changed from his hoodie into a half-tank grey binder. John got on his knees in front of him, setting the first aid kit onto the floor and opening it. Sherlock stared at the ceiling, his hands awkwardly folded against his chest.
“Fine,” Sherlock sighed, pulling his mobile from his pocket. “Let me just text Tony and OK it with him first.”
“Why not?” Sherlock murmured, his voice hoarse from lack of use. “It’s not like I have to put in any work. They just pull it out of me.”
John swallowed again, his hands shaking as he quickly closed the email tab on his browser. Sherlock turned, saw him, and strode over, the heels of his boots clacking against the cafe’s hardwood floors.
Lestrade nodded. “Alright, see you guys tomorrow.” He and Mycroft left. Sherlock immediately crossed the two rooms to the window, watching them get into the same car.
“Recreational drug use in no way is certain to lead to death, Greg.” Sherlock shook his finger at Lestrade, eyes wide.
"Where in the hell have you been?" John demanded, ignoring the way Sherlock flinched at his loud voice. John couldn't help but notice the large, dark hickies on Sherlock's neck, the even more obvious bruises circling the younger man's wrist. Sherlock stumbled again and John scrunched up his nose - Sherlock stank of liquor.
Sherlock stopped playing, turning to look at him. Lestrade stared into his glass of sparkling water.
“Stay still,” Sherlock said softly, putting a hand on the upper part of John’s rib cage to steady him. “Here we go.”
John blushed and spluttered. Sherlock chuckled, bunching up the side of his shirt as they continued to walk. He turned to show John the impressive fox that took up part of his rib cage, spreading down over his abdomen and stomach.
He slotted his key into the lock of 221B and let himself inside, breathing in the familiar scent of his flat with indulgence. It felt good to be home - or at least it did, until he walked into the living room to find John sitting in the old red chair.
"Welcome home," he said as they stepped inside. Molly had gotten a banner and a cake, both reading 'welcome home Sherlock'. Sherlock ignored them as he stepped inside, settling in on his usual spot on the couch. John went into the kitchen to make tea.
"Fair," James had gone back to smirking, his hands combing through Sherlock's curls. "Now we can expand the use of your flat, host more there. Won't have that pesky detective or your little doctor friend to bug us, hm?"
"We can make it work, Sherlock," John told him earnestly, kissing his hand. "We can figure it out. I know I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Maybe even....maybe even have a baby one day."
"I remember that," Sherlock nodded quietly, staring down at the ring on his finger. "It was the first time anyone had bought me anything for Christmas."
With the wound at least halfway taken care of, Sherlock shuffled his way from the bathroom back into the living room, collapsing on the couch with exhaustion and running his hands roughly over his face. He glanced at the clock next to the cow skull above the mantle; it was almost six already.
“You’re supposed to be sober,” John murmured, setting the beer on the coffee table and sitting beside him. “Feeding your addiction does nothing but hurt you.”
Instead, it was an older looking gentleman, pulling on a button up shirt with a suit jacket slung over one arm and his shoes in his hand. He met John's eyes sheepishly, nodded once, then shuffled past John towards the front door. John watched him go with fire burning in his throat and stomach. Stomping now, he went into the kitchen to make breakfast. Sherlock emerged a few minutes later, shirtless and wearing sweatpants. John huffed into his coffee pointedly.
"I love you," Sherlock said suddenly, as if reading John's mind. John hummed, not looking up from the tea. He brought the mug full of tea over to Sherlock, setting it on the scarce empty space of the kitchen table. Sherlock reached down, capturing John's lips with his own. They stood there, kissing, for several long moments until John pulled away, dizzy. Tea forgotten he grabbed Sherlock by the collar of his shirt, pulling him down for another and walking them backwards towards the bedroom.
“John,” John was walking back towards the flower shop, a smile dominating his face. “John Watson. See you at twelve thirty.”
Sherlock peeled his eyes open to find John staring at him. He tried to blink away some of the sleep, wrapping an arm around John's middle and drawing him closer.
John sat up slowly, picking his mobile off up off of the table and checking the time. It was just now noon. He stood and stretched, running his hand through his hair before trotting to the bathroom to wash his face. He would have to go back to his own place soon, just for a shower and some new clothes if anything.
Saturday morning, John took himself and his school materials to the coffee shop in the town square, ready to get some studying done before his shift at the flower shop, which opened late on weekends. He ordered his usual - black coffee, light cream, no sugar - and settled into a booth, opening his laptop. All of his paycheque was about to go towards his tuition -
"Where are you? I've called you sixteen times in the past hour, Sherlock, you can't just disappear - "
John brought him his tea and they sat together in the living room silently, comfortable with each other.
“The wound was deeper than they first thought,” John mumbled, his heart in his stomach. “Organ damage. They had to take him to surgery to fix it.”
“I knew you didn’t want to have a baby with someone like me.” Sherlock said quietly. “Damaged goods, and a freak on top of it.”
“Of course,” John said quietly, standing and walking over to where they sat. He pulled Sherlock’s lanky, heavy figure to his feet, slinging Sherlock’s skinny arm around his shoulders and making their way towards the hallway.
"Don't sound so surprised, John," Sherlock drawled in his usual Sherlockian drawling voice. "I have a sex life, as unlikely as that may seem to you and others."
He packed away the uniform and hid it in its spot under the floorboard closest to the wall and the bathtub, wiping the blood from his nose with his sleeve. When he opened the door, it was to find John staring at him.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock replied, dismissing John’s concern with a wave of his hand. John watched him for a moment, realization dawning on him.
"Please what?" John murmured, smirking as he worked Sherlock for a minute before adding another finger.
Lestrade said nothing, his broad hand rubbing Sherlock’s bony shoulders. “It’s going to be okay, Sherlock. You’re safe now.”
Sherlock knocked three times and lit a cigarette, hands shaking. Whether it was from anxiety or withdrawal, he didn't know. Either way, right after this, he was going to go score.
“So,” Sherlock said as they stepped outside. He lit a cigarette and pulled his hood up to protect his hair from the rain.
“We’re boyfriends for a reason, Sherlock!” John snapped, and Sherlock flinched. “You’re supposed to tell me these things, not hide them like the fucking junkie you are.”
"You get three hours," James told him, smirking and opening the door for him. He closed the door again as John descended the stairs. The room was large and pitch black; John managed to make out a singular chain hanging from the ceiling and tugged on it, flooding the room in dim light. He had to bite back a gasp.
“Well, thanks for putting up with me.” Sherlock murmured, his voice sincere. They came to a stop outside of 221B. They stood together for a moment.
But John only dug his tongue deeper into Sherlock, listening to Sherlock's crescendo of whimpers and moans. Sherlock buried his face in the pillow beneath his head, his entire body on fire with pleasure. When John pulled away and spoke to him, Sherlock had trouble hearing him, too lost in his own head; John had to repeat himself.
“Should you be telling me all this?” John asked, feeling sick to his stomach. The kettle was going off, but he ignored it.
The door opened, revealing a sweater and jeans-clad John, looking confused. Sherlock fiddled with his hood, shoulders hunched against the drizzling rain and the cold.
"Please," Sherlock managed to choke out, hips arching again, his mind blanking for a moment. "John - "
.” John growled, his teeth gritted. “You got rid of my pistol, I’m getting rid of every single thing you could use to hurt yourself.”
"Better's getting married,"Sherlock muttered bitterly, his food going untouched as he swirled his beer around in its bottle.
“Have you ever thought about coming forward?” John said softly, watching him. “I’m sure Mycroft could make him disappear.”
Sherlock grinned, the sides of his eyes crinkling, and did as he was told. They finished the rest of their lunch telling each other jokes with their eyes.
John turned towards him, grinning, and began to dance his way. "Come on, you know you want to dance with me."
He had to fight not to smile, not to let Sherlock know that he had heard. After a few moments of silence, Sherlock laid his head on John's shoulder and fell asleep.
"Shut up and hug me," Lestrade replied, hugging him tightly. Sherlock actually looked like he might cry, cheeks crimson as he pulled away, taking the bottle of sparkling water and whisking away to the kitchen.
"Fine. But you're going to have to eat your sandwich in exchange, understand? It looks like you haven't eaten in days. And I'm going to teach you how to use concealer properly."
"He can't see you," Sherlock sounded earnest, glancing around desperately before ushering John towards the closet. "Get in here. Please, John, I'm sorry, but he really can't know that you - "
“Yeah, we busted him before he could get any more heroin,” Lestrade said, walking up to beside John with the cell key in his hand. “Lucky we did, or else he’d probably be dead right now.”
Sherlock walked closer until they were toe-to-toe, looming over John with a satisfied smirk on his face. John swallowed and hoped his arousal wasn’t too obvious.
Seb turned his chair to look at him, arching an eyebrow. "Nah, nobody paid me. Some bloke in a sweater came around, talking about cracking skulls if I sold to you again. Seemed pretty serious - took out two of my guys just to prove his point."
John ambled into the kitchen. The kitchen table was covered in various beakers and science equipment, looking both dangerous and disgusting. John rifled through the cabinets - Sherlock was right, there were very little edible items, but soon enough John found both tea and the kettle. He put the kettle on, then continued snooping.
“John, John, I’m - “ Sherlock fell into mindless babbling, his entire body melting and coming undone above John. John didn’t even pause, pushing two fingers into him and twisting as he sucked hard and fast; Sherlock came almost immediately, clenching and quivering as he cried out John’s name. John sucked him off through it, feeling smug and pleased with himself as Sherlock collapsed against the desk, his head falling back. John leveled with him, sucking a love bite onto Sherlock’s exposed neck.
He got his bearings together and found his discarded clothes in the hall. Pulling them on as he walked, he moved shamefully through the flat to the front door.
With his innate grace, not at all dented by the baby-carrier placed on his chest that hold Hamish, Sherlock turned to Sally and stared at her with a bored look.
The sky above them was covered with gray clouds and soon a slight drizzle of dull rain would begin to fall.
The detective quickly wondered what might have caused that reaction, coming to the correct conclusion: he had made the wrong move by letting John precede him.
-No, it's still important, but... -he said before stopping, looking for the most suitable words to help Mycroft understand. -When you are in a relationship, especially in an important relationship like ours, you have to carefully choose your own battles, know what you are willing to give up for the sake of the other... -
The homeless man, closer to fifty than forty, tall with hair that had once been red, but which were now so tangled and dirty that it would have been difficult to recognize its natural color, green eyes, an acrylic suit in bright colors and brown loafers battered and so ruined that it would make Mycroft cringe, stared at him for a few seconds before his face clouded.
At any moment John would come down those stairs and their date would officially begin and, for the first time in many years, Sherlock Holmes was literally terrified.
After all, he didn't need an anniversary to miss Sherlock... Not when everything in his apartment reminded him of his former roommate.
John let his face open into a loving smile and took the few steps that separated him from the sofa, moving cautiously until he was lying as well in the small portion left free by Sherlock, his head on the man's chest and an arm wrapped around  his narrow waist.
Instead of answering, the woman nodded to the nearest waiter and ordered Assam tea, returning to lay her eyes on John’s face as soon as the waiter turned his back on them.
-It's a movie with subtitles, it's obvious it's going to be deadly boring! - commented Sherlock, determined not to back down in his convictions.
-It's highly unlikely that John saw the press conference because he was busy at his "beloved" clinic...-
After you disappeared, he realized he didn't even have a picture of you, except for the ones in the papers, so he started taking pictures.
On a critical day, both for national security and for his private life, the number of the texts and phone calls that will arrive on Mycroft Holmes cellphone will greatly exceed a number of three digits.
For a few moments there was an incredulous silence in the room until Sherlock, who had never let go of John's gaze, bowed his lips into a mischievous smile.
Mycroft had to acknowledge that the boy had great acting skills; perhaps on another occasion he would consider him for a position in one of the many ministries he dealt with.
Silently John nodded and went into their bedroom to quickly change and retrieve his kit, checking that everything was there, before returning to the living room and approaching the sofa where Sherlock was busy with his mobile phone.
Sherlock paid the cab driver and waited for John to join him again before heading down a side street until he stopped in front of a restaurant.
You've got me and Hamish now—Sherlock said moving his face closer to John, the tip of his nose stroking John’s cheek, letting the silence fall.
It was clear that he did not want to leave him alone, and John nodded appreciating the offer and its implications.
Both Daniel and John turned to stare at the detective, with expressions of disbelief almost identical on their faces.
Pulling away once more with short breath from their kiss, John lowered his head, moving on Sherlock to focus his attention on Sherlock's long neck; that small movement brought his hips closer to Sherlock’s, their erections still contained by their pajamas sliding together.
Making a huge effort,he looked away from the photo and moved on, quickly reading the first sheet: a Barts Hospital hospitalization sheet for dehydration a few weeks after his death,with the list of various exams and treatments to which John was submitted and the following resignation sheet signed by John.
-You will be the one who will help Hamish during the tough years of childhood and the even more difficult ones of adolescence; the person who will understand and help him overcome his own fears and nightmares and who will be patient during his whims; if  my son will not be an outcast it will be because you will not allow it, helping him to make friends.
John looked away from the man, suddenly feeling the need of hiding in a corner and crying without any shame.
-My husband was older than me: his intelligence was out of the ordinary and it was the first thing that struck me in him.
"It's a pretty deep cut" he said, quickly looking up to meet Daniel's gaze. – Who did this to you?-John asked concerned.
Emma stared at him for a few moments, clearly undecided whether or not to believe him before letting go of another sigh.
So, if Emma's presence is the price to pay for having you with me, well so be it- concluded Sherlock.
-Mr. Holmes, I see that you lost an assistant but gained a child...-comment the old man, his eyes now focused on Hamish.
He thought back to the silence that had invaded Baker Street for weeks and to the umpteenth wall that John had raised against him after the press conference.
Mycroft often used that office, especially after the capture of Osama Bin Laden, as if he needed to be at the nerve point from which all the information started and arrived.
He needed to see with his own eyes, to experience on his own skin the difference between the man he knew, and the one unknown to him.
He turned around as he heard the door, and as soon as his eyes rested on the visitor, Sherlock saw them wide open.
Yet there is no area that is not occupied by  newspapers, papers full of notes and folders from the Yard; on any given day we have mold growing under the sink and which cannot be disturbed for the sake of Science, and the severed body parts in the refrigerator right next to the food, but we are perpetually short of milk-said John smiling.
The problem, however, was that John had no intention of talking about what had happened with Sherlock, at least not now: everything was still so confused, Sherlock's visit had only made things worse, and John definitely needed time to think.
-True, but sometimes it's good to have a laugh for something "normal" instead of Anderson’s stupidity or the other Met agents; or go to dinner with a friend just for the sake of it instead of celebrating the end of a case-
It would have taken a small gesture to make all those conflicting thoughts fade away and to make that wonderful mind still and silent for a few precious moments, but just as the distance between them was about to diminish further, John remembered being in a public place and how Sherlock had always hated public displays of affection, so he merely took the detective's hand again, weaving his fingers around the pale, tapered ones.
-When our father died I was eighteen years old and Mycroft twenty-five; he was already engaged in his political rise and surrounded by minions ready to fulfill his every desire, but he managed to free himself from his commitments for two weeks and dealt with everything from financial management, to the reading of the will, to the reorganization of the estate before disappearing back into the corridors of Whitehall-
John suspected that there, as well as downstairs, few changes had occurred, and he had confirmation as he opened the door of the room: the last time he had slept there had been the night before his departure for the training camp, almost twenty-five years earlier.
Letting a frustrated sound slip from his open lips, John grabbed the detective by the lapel of his coat and in a quick and unexpected move, turned the detective and slammed him violently against the church wall.
His mind wandered for a moment to Baker Street, imagining Sherlock as a parent to little Hamish, busy feeding him, or focused on bathing him with the same delicacy he used to handle his test tubes or in the arduous task of getting him to sleep.
That affability was completely gone, giving way to a clearly unexpected pain, which was compounded by a latent rage.
John nodded slowly as he looked at the girl, although it was clear to the detective that he was still worried.
John nodded almost in a  military way biting his lower lip, busy checking the inventory of his own bag in his mind.
Ten days had passed since his return to Baker Street and in all that time John had kept himself at a distance, totally uninterested in his life and basic needs: never once had he worried if the detective had eaten or slept, never once a cup of tea had appeared on the coffee table of the living room next to the sofa, perfect as only John was able to make it.
-Sherlock... Do you really think that if it was all over between us, I would have come to the Zoo with you and Misha? -John asked him trying to make him realize his mistake.
Congratulations! - John added, turning his back and moving a slightly trembling hand through his hair.
When he finally came back to the doctor, certain that he could resume his life from the exact moment he left it, he had to face an unexpected problem.
The apartment was silent for almost two hours, allowing him to reflect for a long time on the situation, taking advantage of Hamish's long nap.
In those few moments, the doctor saw Sherlock's face change quickly, clearly uncomfortable in that totally unexplored field that were feelings.
-I'm pretty sure that if John was sexually frustrated, he wouldn't need these methods to... Maybe Jack's trying to help him in this situation with the reporters. -concluded the woman, changing the subject in half so as not to succumb to her own embarrassment.
Still visibly sleepy, Daniel sat down with obvious fatigue, showing his bruises to the British official who, in the space of a few moments, catalogued his wounds.
Instead, he was confronted with a woman ten centimeters taller than himself, with soft curves wrapped in a midnight blue dress accompanied by a pair of shoes of the same color with a low heel.
-Mycroft-John greeted him clearly letting his surprise show on his face and in the tone of his voice-I didn't expect to see you here- he added.
Despite the obvious hatred that radiated from his presence towards the detective, his brain seemed unable not to care about the man.
Just two days ago I had everything I had always wanted for three years and now I don't know if I have to pack my stuff and move out from Baker Street or give your brother another chance- he said exasperated.
The embarrassment had been enormous, but there had been no mortifying discussion as to why he felt the need to masturbate, as would have happen with her mother.
Are you really ready to give up the future we imagined just two days ago because you can't forgive yet another stupid mistake?
"It seems you have everything under control…Carry on" Mycroft said, masking his surprise behind the mask of indifference he usually wore.
"I said, Dr. Watson has made a habit over the years of go through the apartment every two days looking for microphones and cameras" he said.
It was completely uncharted territory and the conclusions that he would draw from it would be misled by Lestrade and Mycroft’s insinuations.
-Of course, the first few days the novelty will fill them with a spirit of solidarity, and they will try to help you in some way, but then when they will have to choose whether to help you and your little girl or help themselves...
John focused on that kiss, his eyes fixed momentarily in the icy-blue ones,  stroking Sherlock’s upper lip with the tip of his tongue, biting the bottom one gently, until his tongue got involved in a dance with his twin and, again overwhelmed with passion, John closed his eyes,  his arms clasped around the detective's hips, his skinny chest pressed against his own still covered by the sweater.
The man clasped his abandoned hands along his hips in fists, trying to control the anger towards the woman and himself: could it be so easy for anyone to interpret his every move?
Slowing down slightly he stopped in front of a wooden gate on which hung a parking ban, which began to open the moment the roar of his engine settled on a quiet meowl.
In his relationship with Sherlock, John had found everything he wanted, even willing to give up sex for the rest of his life if this represented a problem in their "friendship".
-We will leave him with Mrs. Hudson; since you came back, she became more affectionate towards him- Sherlock commented.
For most governments I'm officially dead, do you think it's the ideal condition to raise a child? -she asked him, bringing the small cup to her face.
John lay down on his side, his elbow folded to support the weight of his body and observed Hamish and how he accompanied his every move with a continuous mumble, almost a commentary of his actions for those around him, so that his actions were clear and easily understandable to all.
Almost attracted as magnets, their bodies annulled the distance to a minimum, touching each other's from shoulders to hips; their lips engaged in a sensual dance that tore a groan from John's throat.
And I'm going to go back to fucking the half of London's gay population that I haven’t slept with yet" John said with a shrug.
John had always been very extroverted with women, so he certainly didn't expect him to stop dating them just because his roommate had jumped down a roof.
In the past they had been partners and roommates, but this had not stopped the various allegations about them and now, even if his confused feelings led him to wonder what the nature of their relationship was.
He stretched and approached the window, watching the sky slightly covered with gray clouds and the crowd mingling in the streets of Marylbone.
I'm not sure I'll be able to post a new chapter next week so I want to wish you a MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR!
"You're not going to compare your friendship with John to MY relationship with John, I hope" Sherlock warned him in a serious voice.
Still with his brow wrinkled with surprise and confusion, John quickly glanced at Greg, asking him a mute question.
Was he really willing to let someone else endure the same bullying and mistreatment he suffered during his childhood because of ignorant children frightened by his superior intelligence?
After a long moment of silence their breaths returned to normal and John found enough strength to move his head until he met Sherlock's gaze: a peaceful and happy smile bent the man's swollen lips and John could not stop himself from kissing them lazily.
-I know... But I had nothing to do, and I thought if my teachers saw me talking to the Captain, they'd let me go home.
John found himself unable to take a step in any direction: initially he wanted to leave and forget that evening and all that had happened, but once again he found himself encased in the need to run to Sherlock, curling up against him and wait for everything to settle as if by magic and the desire to close that chapter of his life behind once and for all.
The idea of Sherlock being overwhelmed by such a human feeling as lust made him even more furious, while his imagination  flooded him with images that had once been of two of them together and that now only worsen his anger and resentment: Sherlock's pale back stretched by effort, his perfectly drawn lips made more swollen by kisses and bites, the marks on his chest and neck left by two lips unable to detach  from that statuesque body... the satisfied expression on his face as he orgasmed.
With his back straight and his shoulders perfectly aligned, John once more touched the words on the headstone in one last gesture of greeting before turning around and walking toward the cemetery exit.
The next moment he was gone, leaving John to fight with his noisy thoughts while trying to control the crazy heartbeat of his own heart.
If you want to continue to brood unnecessarily on your discussion by endlessly analyzing my brother’s words be my guest, but personally I think you need a higher mind-
Wrapped in Sherlock's embrace, John continued to play with the child, his mind only partially focused on his own actions, while a predominant part of his brain continued to reflect on his own desires and how they had only become stronger in previous days.
Sherlock remained silent, not knowing what to say or do in response to that spontaneous gesture of affection.
-Oh, Jack, you're here too. A tea would be welcome, thank you-added Mrs. Hudson moving around the kitchen, casting a quick glance at John and Sherlock.
"To be honest, I have to confess that there is an important person in my life... - he said, meeting John's gaze again and noticing his surprised expression.
John had to admit that there was nothing truer, so he merely nodded, sure that even that slight hint would be enough to keep the detective going.
He explained in detail how he had infiltrated Moriarty's criminal network several times, dismantling cell after cell, resorting to force when the situation demanded it and how Sebastian Moran, Moriarty's right-hand man and killer assigned to John, had managed several times to escape him thus prolonging his return home.
John wasn't a careful person, so it would take a moment to steal the detective's number from John's cell phone and send that message.
A smug smile was stretching Sherlock's full lips as he realized that his partner had finally noticed that "little and unusual" detail, leading John to smile in turn.
He had expected Sherlock to ask him to leave at any moment, while the detective had other thoughts in his head.
-I'm not the one who spends hours in front of the closet looking for the beigest sweater - Sherlock teased him.
Greg had feared the worst when John's name was inevitably made, but Sherlock had merely humiliated the journalist and given her the "standard" answer on the subject.
That's why that Friday evening, he sat in his own armchair and met Sherlock's gaze for the first time in seven days.
For the second time in thirty-eight years, Sherlock had found himself in front of a blank sheet, unable to draw his own conclusions.
-I was in total paranoia, convinced that that was the most logical solution, the only way out... I guess I even thought I'd do my friends a favor, that I would free them from a burden, but I had forgotten how stubborn they could be- he said with a small smile.
With an innocent expression on his face, Sherlock bowed his head as if he wanted to speak in the doctor's right ear.
Feeling observed, the detective looked in his direction and their eyes met for a few moments, before the doctor returned to the screen where Amy and Rory were fleeing from a horde of Weeping Angels.
The woman placed her hands on her knees perfectly aligned with each other and stared at him a few moments before answering.
Sherlock raised both hands to the side of the other's neck, trying to convey all those feelings to which he could not give a name to the blond, to make him understand that he no longer needed to be afraid, that all those insecurities now were unnecessary.
-Well, you and I know I'm a very stubborn man. I'm going to stay here until you listen to me- Sherlock said persistent.
But if they would play their cards well, then there would be hope that everything would go as Sherlock had described last night: forty years of life together.
The detective remained silent for a few moments, giving rise to the other's hope that perhaps this time the message had come loud and clear.
Now that his task was over, he couldn't  wait to get out of there: the adrenaline rush he always felt on those occasions was short-lived, making him realize that his presence at the crime scenes was wrong, that he was clearly out of place surrounded by police and forensic officers.
John clenched his fists and closed his eyes for a moment, cursing the detective for his intelligence and his brilliant and perfect deductions.
Greg followed him into the kitchen with his bag and began placing the containers on the experiment-free portions of the table.
"You came back with the certainty that you and John would take the necessary step to turn your friendship into something else...-began Molly.
John looked down and stared at his toes, trying to control that uncontrolled reflex that led him to compliment the detective at the end of each brilliant deduction.
-You were controlled 24/7 by Moriarty's men, even the slightest mistake would have shattered the entire operation.
When John returned home, the living room was shrouded in silence, but from the ajar door of the bathroom the now customary noises of the evening bath came to his ears and made him smile.
"She seems to appreciate the company of your brother, who would have thought of that…" said Greg, looking at the little girl.
Sherlock merely nodded, thus freeing him from the task of finding an explanation for his absurd behavior and stood up, approaching the stand next to the window.
Everything Sherlock had just said was true: John had formed a bond with Baby Girl and her unborn baby, almost without realizing it, driven above all by loneliness and the need for affection, toying with the idea of being able to convince the girl to entrust the baby to him so that he  could raise her and take care of her.
And indeed it was not difficult to imagine a child with black and curly hair always energetic, with a notebook always in his hands, in need of a thousand answers; or with a Chelsea kit or a rugby outfit entirely muddy but fully satisfied with the result of the match.
John put down his fork and stared at Sherlock's face for a few moments, before Sherlock's eyes met his.
The man shrugged his shoulders, then carefully reflected on the events of the last few years but went back with his mind to one episode.
John quickly finished his breakfast and, after taking his jacket from the hanger next to the door, went out into the street.
"Let's just hope my brother doesn't act like an unbearable spoiled child like he used to" said the other, taking a sip of wine from his own glass.
If we add the negligible fact that I had returned from Iran a few days before... I could have told the truth then, at that moment, but John is a terrible liar.
John was the main subject of almost every photo, sometimes Molly, sometimes with the man who seemed to follow him everywhere, other times with Greg.
When John finally approached the crime scene, he saw that they were on a side street, behind the "Ed's" restaurant a short distance from Shaftesbury Avenue, in a area busy both day and night: how had the killer not to be discovered?
The man had spent the night in the police station and, although it was not the first time he had spent sleeping at his desk,  Mycroft could not help but wonder if he would come home to change clothes or if will wait until he sure to find the apartment empty.
"What should I have done?" Mycroft asked, again feeling that pleading vein that was an accompaniment to his words.
He had only been to that building once before and, even at the time, he had to stop at the edge of the world that was swarming within it because he lacked the necessary authorization.
I can give you a long list of evidence that would only corroborate my case, but it's a decision you have to make all by yourself, so when you finally make your choice you can't blame anyone else but yourself- Mycroft said.
Sherlock studied him for a few moments, looking for a hidden meaning behind his words, before raising his head just enough to meet John’s lips.
"To be honest, I thought Anthea would come” John confessed to him, stepping aside to get Mycroft into the house.
He was sitting at his desk, trying to focus on yet another report, when outside the door of his office he felt a slight commotion that he did not take much notice: probably Donovan and Anderson had found another reason to quarrel; the situation between them had remained tense after the end of their relationship and almost every day the two  were at each other’s throat.
Sherlock could not avoid the pang of jealousy that materialized within himself to those words: John was HIS best friend!
With quick movements, John grabbed the hem of the T-shirt Sherlock was wearing and pushed it upwards, throwing it the next moment somewhere on the floor of the living room, following the reverse path that a few moments earlier had taken the shirt with his lips, licking and kissing Sherlock’s protruding collarbone and the chiseled pectorals leaving his mark along the way on Sherlock perfect pale skin, kissing and teasing the brown nipples with the tip of his tongue until they were stiff under his lips.
Observing the way he interacted with the child, the way he stroked his little hands, or even the serious nod with which he seemed to agree to every word of the little one, Greg wondered once again why Mycroft had decided categorically not to have a family.
Thank you for dinner, but I have to get back to work- Daniel said as he stood up and tucked half of the sandwich and of the cookies, which was also wrapped in multiple napkins, in the pockets of his jacket.
On the short journey that would take him to the bathroom, he turned off the music and once inside, he closed the door behind him, locking it the next moment.
Even if I had slept with the entire gay population of London, it’s not your fucking business" John said, speaking through his teeth, making himself more threatening.
Baby Girl stroked her belly with one hand, gently, almost without noticing it before meeting the doctor's blue eyes.
John arched an eyebrow at those words, clearly incredulous, leading Sally to nod vehemently to remark her own words.
With an unexpected tenderness, Sherlock pulled off the fabric of the shirt from John’s shoulders, trapping John with the still buttoned cuffs, and focused completely on the observation of the scar: curiously it was starshaped, the tissues around the wound of a rosy color despite the fact that almost six years had passed since the accident, and scar tissue lines extended to the left pectoral.
Returning to the kitchen, John carefully opened the bottle, checking the amount of water contained in the bottle before emptying it in the sink, and filling it with warm water directly from the kettle and then carefully adding the milk powder to it with extreme caution, being careful not to drop it on the kitchen floor, finally closing up the bottle.
There was also a smell, spicier than the cologne that John used habitually, and that Sherlock had only heard on another occasion that told him who John had spent those hours with.
John swallowed visibly, curbing the desire to reach out a hand, sinking his fingers into those black curls he knew to be soft and thick, get their faces closer and taking possession of those drawn lips.
-It was a really great bike. I think it partly justified the pain of the break-up- retorted John ironically.
John lowered his head slightly, enjoying the thrill that that single word had unleashed along his back, before encountering Sherlock’s gaze again.
Sherlock remained silent for a few moments, coming to terms with the new truth hidden in those words: John had replaced him.
That's why I started taking those pills: one was enough, and everything made sense, you were with me again and I stopped being the pathetic person I had become.
The vibration of his mobile phone on the mahogany desktop pulled him away from his thoughts and led him to cast a glance on the iPhone screen.
John burst out laughing and looked down for an instant; when their eyes met again a serious expression had appeared in the blue eyes of the doctor, and the jaw muscles had contracted leading him to assume his typically military pose.
Why had John sought comfort in things, albeit moderately, but avoided erasing their friendship by reinventing himself?
You also know as well as I do that the idea that Baby Girl can keep the baby is not practical and clearly impossible: Social Services would take the baby away from her the first week, if they ever allow her to leave the hospital with the baby.
The direct attack had always brought him results, and he was sure that in this case, it would certainly improve the situation between them.
-With a splash of milk and no sugar, if I remember correctly- he added, sitting in John's place, his cup clenched in his hands and a smile to bend his lips to the thought that before leaving, John had made his tea.
Nothing would have given him back those three years; nothing would diminish the anger, guilt or all the feelings that stirred within him at the mere thought of Sherlock.
This was John's hunting territory, being even considered by John was for those guys an acknowledgment, something to brag about, and the mere fact that John had chosen Sherlock that night made him the object of their jealousy.
That simple bickering, like other conversations they had in the past, was instead a symbol of normality, proof that his life should not be sucked back into a black hole because of the return of Sherlock Holmes.
The expression that was initially serious, prepared for the worst on John's face, had slowly turned into an incredulous expression as Sherlock went on.
With his steady hand on the handle he took a deep breath and a smile appeared as if by magic to stretch out his lips.
John's arms tightened around the black-haired man’s shoulders, leading John to stand on tiptoes to decrease the height difference between them, responding to the kiss, sinking his fingers between the black and silky curls of the detective.
-Why don't you ask John? I think he's more qualified than I am, and then, in case you forgot, I already have a boyfriend-replied Greg, trying to change the subject.
Behind his narrow eyelids, listening to the man's movements around the living room, Sherlock was able to reproduce his every action: checking his appearance in the mirror above the fireplace, passing his hand over his jaws covered with blonde beard, the quick movement of the fingers in the hair (
Even at the cost of spending hours in front of a laptop or phone- Sherlock concluded, his eyes fixed in John's ocean-blue ones confirming his words.
The taxi stopped a short distance from Battersea Bridge, perfectly lit in the night and John looked around looking not very discreetly for the place of their date.
“Mycroft,” John wants to throttle the man. He tries to call on his experience, as a doctor, to find more compassion. “Mycroft, you’re desperate to see him.”
"He couldn't breathe, his lips were going blue and when he coughed blood bubbled up.  So much blood.  I tried to stop the bleeding.  I tried.  You have to tell Mycroft I tried.  I tried."
John nods, remembering all too well how he felt before they’d come with news about Sherlock, how he felt lying in a hospital bed his shoulder in a cast, unable to help the men on his ward.  He’d thought it would improve when he left the hospital, until he met Sherlock it gotten progressively worse.
For all the time John's spent in hospitals he can't fathom if Mycroft has worked out the internal maze of this one, or if he is marching them around in random circles, trying to expend excess energy and prolong the true moment of confrontation between himself and Lestrade's mother.
They arrived in  East Staffordshire village just as dusk was just beginning to fall.   "Sherlock…"  John protested.   "Really, this is…"   What could he add to the protests he'd already lodged?  Sherlock wasn't listening, never listened when he got something in his head.
Sherlock swallowed hard as he stared into the lupine eyes of his former friend. They were different, deadly.  "John.  Please…"    He searched for any bit of the man he knew.  "John.  It is me.  It is Sherlock."
"It is unlikely, but given the clues, I think we need to entertain the possibility that the Rawls might be or at least believe himself to be a werewolf."
"They don't like salt.  There is a school of belief that a bath in salt water can cure a werewolf.  Obviously, that theory is untested.  As is the theory that it is exposure to mercury and not an actual silver bullet that can kill them.    And me without my trusty glass thermometer." John shook his head.
Warm, lythe, free of pain,  and suddenly ravenously hungry.  John sniffed the air and turned towards the nearest meat.
She's already seated, in a descent chair, as far as John can tell the only one in the whole hospital.
John watches, entranced, trying to figure out what words could possibly do in a moment such as this one.  He comes up with nothing and eventually takes a step backwards.
Mycroft pulls up short just inside the second. From a small window he can see directly into Lestrade’s small room.
“He’s a friend?” John realizes it sounds like a question. He isn’t sure he would have categorized Mycroft as a friend before this morning. He’s thinks he would now.
“I’m sorry we can only release information to family.”   John searches the doctor’s eyes.   He doesn’t like what he sees.  “I’m a doctor.”
The hairs on John's neck bristled.  There was something in the air, a familiar musk. He lifted his head to the sky and let out a loud, primal, primitive howl.
Maybe…  A church?  A Gardens?  A salt water pool?"  Sherlock grabbed the phone back and googled Hoar Cross Hall.  He put the phone to his face.   "Hello, this is his personal assistant.  has Mr. Rawls checked in yet?  No, no message.   Thank you."
“Just about.” She responded. John crossed his arms and waited. Sherlock appeared a few moments later, wearing black torn skinny jeans and the same sleeveless tee he wore the first time John met him. His arm was decorated with a brand new, bandaged tattoo.
Sherlock's mouth had gone numb, humiliation flushing the back of his neck up to the tips of his ears and his cheeks.
Sherlock was staring at him, his gaze piercing John to his core. He looked down into his coffee mug.
"You can stay," Sherlock mumbled, not looking anywhere but the ceiling as the nurse began to change his ileostomy bag. John nodded to himself, staring down at his feet as the nurse changed the bag and then left again.
“I need a cigarette,” Sherlock muttered to the shop’s owner, Tony, and stepped out before Tony could protest. Standing on the corner of the sidewalk, he lit a menthol, staring resolutely at his boots as he took a draw.
"Of course I've told him," Sherlock muttered. "He doesn't want anything to do with me anymore, happy?"
“Yeah,” Sherlock took a sip of his coffee, exhaling steam. “Just a little zombie, nothing major. Aside from that, it’s been a pretty easy day. Lots of sorority girls from America.” Sherlock was silent for a moment. “You should get a tattoo.”
“Hey,” he said casually, sliding into the booth seat opposite John. “Didn’t expect to see you here.”
He stopped, finger frozen on the touchpad as he opened the email from his school’s financial office.
Sherlock, a bit relieved, took a bite of his sandwich, suddenly ravenous. He knew Molly was watching him and he forced himself to slow down, taking the time to chew before s before swallowing. He really hadn't eaten in days.
“Thanks, Sherl.” Victor murmured, and to John’s surprise, he swooped down and pecked Sherlock on the forehead, disappearing before Sherlock could release any of the rage contorted in his face.
“Well, um, we weren’t sure you were aware, but it appears - erm - “ She looked down at her feet. “Sherlock is pregnant, and we weren’t sure how attached he was to the pregnancy in question.”
John settled onto the countertop, flipping open his book and preparing for a long day in which he could finish it, but was interrupted by the bell above the shop door. Sherlock sauntered towards him, carrying two coffees, stopping short when he caught sight of John’s cup on the counter.
“I’ve excelled at my goal then.” He stood between Sherlock’s legs, his smirk fading as his fingers ran from smooth marble skin to brushing against rough, fresh cuts lining Sherlock’s hips.
“And Lestrade came by looking for you. I told him you weren’t here. Where have you been?” John’s eyes narrowed. “You don’t drive to work, so you weren’t there.”
“I’m not just going to ‘forget about them’, Sherlock.” John snapped. “You’ve been cutting yourself for who knows how long, and I’m just supposed to pretend like it’s not happening?”
He got up, pulling on his boxers and stubbing his cigarette out in the ashtray on his way towards the bathroom. John was quick to follow.
“I’m not being naughty,” Sherlock replied, and palmed John as if that would prove his point. John gasped, biting his lip.
"My stomach hurts," he rumbled into John's ear, a whine underscoring his voice. "Come to bed and cuddle me."
"They are when it comes to you," Mycroft snapped. "Your stubbornness has always been your most fatal flaw, Sherlock. Stubbornness, this refusal to accept help, this incessant need to stand on your own even when your knees are broken - this need to push everyone away who cares about you, this unquenchable need for self destruction - it's going to get you killed. This man is going to end up killing you - "
“Sherlock Holmes,” Sherlock said to the woman at the front desk. She got up and gestured for them to follow her, leading them to a room at the end of a very long hallway. She handed Sherlock a paper gown and left the room, closing the door behind her. Sherlock undressed quickly; John couldn’t help but stare at the already noticeable bump as Sherlock pulled on the dressing gown. Sherlock climbed into the bed, laying flat on his back and staring up at the ceiling.
“For the thousandth time John, I am happy to share my room and the bed it contains with my boyfriend.”
"You're getting married so I had to take it while I could," Sherlock slurred, wiping his mouth with his sleeve as he stood to leave. "Now get the hell out of my flat."
sorry it's so short. i was originally going to make this end on sixteen chapters, but i might stretch it out more :)
He reached one hand into the bag and extracted the pads, then the paracetamol. He opened the painkillers and popped two into his mouth, swallowing them before picking up the pads and excusing himself to the restroom. John went into the kitchen and made himself some tea.
“Good lord,” he swore loudly. “There’s enough drugs in here to kill you three times over, Sherlock, not to mention give you a life sentence if I were to arrest you.”
Mummy had gone on and on about how much older Sherlock looked, how thin he was - and he had put on seventeen pounds at the rehab center, seventeen! - how his hair was thinning, curls flat and limp.
Sherlock walked in, folding himself into the space beside John silently. He stared at John; John, eager to get back to sleep, closed his eyes. He could hear Sherlock breathing beside him, slow and deliberate; after a moment, he felt Sherlock's hand slip into his.
"Tell them to fuck off," he rolled his eyes, taking the shot from the bartender and downing it with ease. "I have better things to do than just mope around the flat listening to you and Mary talk about me."
“Maybe tomorrow,” Sherlock replied, taking a sip from his mug. “Or in a few days. I’ll talk to Tony in the morning.”
"Leave him alone, John. In fact, both of you, get out of here. Let Sherlock have a moment of peace."
“Sherlock,” John said softly. “I didn’t want to get an abortion because of you. I love you, everything about you. You’re not a freak and you’re not damaged goods.”
It was a quick walk to Westminster and the condemned house that stood on its corner. Sherlock went to the back door, rotting with decay, and knocked three times precisely. A rail thin man with ebony skin and bad teeth answered, giving Sherlock a once-over before stepping to the side and letting the man inside. Sherlock passed by the urine-soaked mattresses on the floor without second though, taking the rickety stairs two at a time until he got to the second floor bedroom.
He heard his phone go off from where it was in the pocket of his sweatpants, discarded on the floor. It was probably James - texting him, wondering where he was. Sherlock calmed his racing heart and made a decision. He closed his eyes and let the water run over him.
“Yes, John.” Mycroft straightened and turned towards the aforementioned. Crossing the room to where John stood, he stuck out his hand. “I don’t believe we’ve met.”
The room was made of concrete, a large wooden chest pushed against the middle of one wall. In the corner was a bare mattress with a naked Sherlock on it; he was so thin you could see each rib, his body covered in bruises and gashes, the mattress stained red with blood from forceful intercourse. He was shackled to the wall by a chain, his left eye so swollen John doubted he could see out of it. When John approached and touched him on the shoulder Sherlock yanked away, lashing out, his hand narrowly missing John's face. He writhed around in panic, trying his best to put as much distance between himself and John as possible, eyes wide as he stared at John without registering who he was.
“Boring.” Sherlock muttered, a smirk tugging at his mouth. “You really are vanilla, John. I called it from the moment I saw you.”
“Calm down,” Sherlock hissed, looking around them to make sure John hadn’t attracted any attention. “You’re making a big deal out of nothing, John.”
"Mmf - Sherlock - " John pulled away long enough to give Sherlock a long, searching look. Sherlock met his gaze evenly, drunkenly, before sinking lower.
"Cocaine, heroin, ecstasy and - " he faltered for a moment, then steadied himself. "Chlamydia and a preliminary positive for HIV. Well."
And so Sherlock was, moping around the flat in old hoodies and sweatpants, barely eating and barely sleeping. John would come downstairs in the middle of the night - they still slept in separate beds - to find Sherlock at the window overlooking Baker Street, chain smoking.
“Sherlock?” John tried to shake him awake. “Sherlock?!” He pressed his hands against the growing blood stain in Sherlock’s t-shirt, trying not to panic as he dug his phone out of his pocket with his other hand. Sherlock was limp and almost lifeless beneath him. John rang an ambulance as best he could with his shaking voice.
“Even if that were true, and even if you were a recreational user and not an addict, the man you were propositioning for drugs probably would have continued beating you until you suffered brain injury serious enough to kill you, Sherlock.” Lestrade said patiently, opening the cell door and pulling Sherlock out by the wrist. “And then instead of being here with me, you’d be in a morgue and I’d be investigating a hate crime.”
Lestrade, like years past, was the first one to arrive at the annual Baker Street Christmas Gathering. He brought a bottle of sparkling water, not missing a beat as he took in the engagement rings and grinned at the two.
Sherlock stopped dead, looking up slowly. His gaze shifted from John to Mycroft and down again, his mouth set in a grimace. He walked into the living room, stumbling.
And in one swift motion, he was standing, pushing Sherlock so that he was sitting on the desk as he pulled off Sherlock’s boxers at the same time. He dropped to his knees again, nudging Sherlock’s legs open with his hands, pressing a hard kiss on the inside of Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock shuddered, his hand re-tangling in John’s hair and tugging, a soft whine escaping him.
“I am,” Sherlock conceded, finishing off his coffee and standing. “I must be getting back. Would you like to walk with me? If you can stand?”
"Now's the part where I make you beg to come without even touching you," John smirked, then leaned his head forward to suck a hickey along Sherlock's Adam's apple. "Where I tell you all about those nights I would lay awake in bed, listening to you fuck someone else and wishing it was me inside you, pounding you into the mattress, making you moan my name - "
“Night boys.” Lestrade waved, then disappeared out the front door. John sat Sherlock on the bed, untying his boots. Sherlock sloppily pulled off his shirt, his fingers struggling at the hem of his binder. He whined in frustration.
“Come on,” John took his hand and led him gently out of the Yard. “We’re gonna take you home, Sherlock.”
John, half-asleep, felt the weight of the bed shift, and the warm figure snuggled against him pull away. With a soft groan, he opened one eye, watching Sherlock pull on a pair of ripped jeans.
"I don't see why you care so much," Sherlock finally snapped. "We're flatmates, John, nothing more. What I do with my body in my own home is my business."
“Lube?” John mumbled into Sherlock’s neck, and Sherlock nodded, reaching behind him into his bedside drawer and pulling out a bottle. He squirted a liberal amount into his hand and prepped them both before lowering himself onto John, eyelids fluttering.
“Been saying that on repeat since he showed up at my door an hour ago,” Lestrade noted. “Reckon he’s been drinking all day.”
“Sure,” Lestrade nodded, smirking. “Either way, he wouldn’t let just anyone be alone in his flat. Sorry you had to see him like that last night. I guess he must’ve fallen off the wagon. One of my officers was out on patrol last night when she saw him, hollering drunkenly outside of his brother’s house. She told him to go home, but saw him a little later with an older man getting the shit beat out of him. Brought him into the Yard.”
“Since you’re into girls and I have a girl’s name,” Sherlock shrugged nonchalantly, exhaling smoke again. “Maybe having the name makes me enough of a girl for you to fuck.”
"I'm working on it," John was saying. "He's too vulnerable right now, and he's sick, and if I tell him now - if I leave him now - our friendship won't survive it, Mary."
It was the first time Sherlock had called John by anything other than his name. John felt heat fanning its way up the back of his neck and his cheeks. He kissed Sherlock again, relishing the way Sherlock's reinstated piercings felt against his own lips.
Sherlock went silent, staring down at his plate. John realized what he said and spluttered, his cheeks going rosy.
"So your flatmate," the man - Sherlock thought his name was Stewart - said as he buckled his belt. "Is that your boyfriend or something?"
"Do grow up, John. How many nights have I had to endure listening to your girlfriends fake orgasms?"
“Pay at the counter,” he practically spat, not looking at Victor as he snapped off his gloves. “Marla can take care of it.”
"Since you and Mary got together," Sherlock said icily. John, taken aback, only blinked at his eggs and said nothing more. Sherlock threw the spoon he was using to stir his coffee with into the sink and retreated into his room, locking the door behind him. When he emerged twenty minutes later dressed in an unusual ensemble of street clothes - ratty band tee, jeans, boots and a beanie, all of which just seemed wrong to John in comparison to the way Sherlock usually dressed - the two said nothing and Sherlock disappeared through the front door.
“Are you sure you don’t want to go to rehab?” Mycroft asked, leaning a little on his umbrella. “You know I could have it taken care of, Sherlock.”
“I’m fine for the moment,” Sherlock murmured. “Alcohol’s numbing everything.” He pushed his head into John’s hand, and John resumed petting his hair. Sherlock closed his eyes, and after a moment, he was snoring softly. John watched him. He looked peaceful.
“Got kicked out of uni,” Sherlock replied automatically. “Relapsed and lost control and got expelled. Tony was a TA and offered me a job as his apprentice at his shop. How did you end up at the flower shop?”
With a slow, deep thrust he came, moaning as Sherlock swallowed. Sherlock pulled away, leaning back on his heels, cheeks flushed pleasantly and his own cock straining against the constraint of his jeans. He tried to hide his discomfort with the last part, but John, quicker than Sherlock could ever give him credit for, took Sherlock by the hair and tugged until Sherlock was standing, back against the wall again. Sherlock flushed and tried to put his hands over his lap to hide himself, but John took him by the wrists and pinned his arms above his head.
“Sherlock?” He heard the front door open and quickly made his way back down the hall and into the living room. The voice was Lestrade, looking surprised to see John.
“Sherlock - “ the younger boy’s fingers were already at John’s fly, undoing it expertly as Sherlock planted a trail of kisses up John’s knee. “Sherlock, you don’t have to - “
When Lestrade only stared at him, Mycroft nodded and swept down the hall. After a moment, Lestrade followed him. Anthea had disappeared again. John remained where he was, staring into the room, watching Sherlock lay stationery and silent, not moving, but not sleeping either.
“The fetus was never alive, John.” Sherlock snapped, swiping furiously at his eyes. “My father, however, is the one who’s dead.”
“No, Sherlock. I just don’t think it’s the right choice.” John took his hand. “But what you want matters too.”
“You do have it bad,” Sherlock insisted. “You didn’t ask for the hand you got dealt. Everything that happened to me happened because I either chose it or allowed it to happen. For the most part.”
“Stockholm syndrome,” Mycroft said simply. “He’s in a very vulnerable state right now, John. He goes back because he feels bonded to our father, after having been emotionally abused and manipulated by him for so long. It’s hard for him to break that cycle. And then our father appeals to Sherlock’s vices - gets him drunk, or high. Then he takes advantage, all while making Sherlock think he was in control.”
“If you’re getting high,” John closed the door behind him and mirrored Sherlock’s position on the ground, his back against the door. “I get to watch, and make sure you do it as safely as possible.”
"Not that it's any of your business, but no," Sherlock sighed, exhaling smoke through his nose. "Why're you here, John?"
"Fine," Seb snatched the wad of cash from Sherlock's hand, turning around to file it away and obtain the right amount of goods. "Fine, Sherlock, but you gotta promise you're gonna stay away from that dickwad, okay?"
He wasn’t sure what made him tell John the second part - he hardly knew the kid, and very, very few people got to know about his
Sherlock lit a cigarette, unable to speak to either one of them. After a moment of John continuing to badger, Molly stepped forward.
Molly, still looking at him with pity, took the cup and disappeared through the door to go preform the tests immediately. Sherlock took a seat in the metal chair, staring down at his boots for what seemed like forever.
Sherlock finished the tattoo and straightened, snapping off his gloves. The young man got up and went to the counter to pay as Sherlock turned on his stool, wheeling over to John and giving him a kiss.
John was quiet at this. Sherlock knew that he was thinking about the truth in Mary's words. He sniffed hard, taking a drink of the cold coffee on his nightstand before standing and peeling off his sweat-soaked shirt. Gathering the towel and laid out clothes in his arms, he went into the bathroom, being as loud as he could to make his presence known. Before John could make the connection of Sherlock being there and asking him how he was, however, Sherlock had locked himself in the bathroom and turned the shower on, the water scalding hot. He stripped himself of his sweats and pants before stepping in, the water burning his scalp. He let it.
“That’s because you don’t have one, Donovan.” Sherlock replied without missing a beat, leading John to one of the cubicles in the middle of the shop. John stopped as Sherlock settled at the small desk in the cubicle to get ready for the day, his eyes falling on a small polaroid of himself hanging on the cubicle wall. He smiled softly.
By the third day, John just assumed that Sherlock was sick with the flu or something. At the end of his day, after closing the shop, he got into his car and drove home. He did all of his homework - six hours of it, goddamit - and let himself into bed, cursing the fact that he had classes tomorrow.
They stayed like that for a long while, sitting together in the silence, until soft snoring let John know that Sherlock was asleep again. He sighed and opened his book.
He was across the room in seconds, his free hand cupping John’s cheek. “You tell me, when you have those thoughts from now on. Okay, John?”
Lestrade deposited him onto the couch, where Sherlock remained face-first in the cushions, mumbling to himself.
“Sorry,” Sherlock ran a hand through his curls and stared at the ground as well. “You probably didn’t want to know all that.”
“Yeah,” John said distractedly, his mind elsewhere as he watched Lestrade leave. He went to the kitchen and made himself some tea.
“Of course not,” Sherlock muttered, gesturing to the chair. “Take a seat while I get everything ready.”
"Shut up!" he told it, as it rang a second, then a third time. With a huff he stood, wrapped his blanket tighter around himself, and stomped downstairs to answer it. He stared accusingly at Molly, who stood on the other side of the door looking like a sad puppy.
“Made a baby, but ‘e didn’t want it,” Sherlock was saying, as the two came into the flat, his arm slung around Lestrade’s shoulders. “Didn’ want it, not at all. Killed it, right so.”
“Are you drunk?” John frowned. Sherlock didn’t reply, stumbling his way to his chair and flopping into it. Mycroft strode in from the kitchen, leaning on his umbrella in front of where Sherlock sat. A minute or so of silence passed. Sherlock hiccuped.
"No," John shook his head, voice shaking a bit. "No, no. You weren't - you weren't sleeping with those guys for money. You weren't. Right, Sherlock? Sherlock?"
“Why on earth,” Sherlock’s voice was almost dangerously quiet, “Do you own a pistol, and why is it loaded?”
“I - I did but - i-in public? Really?” John managed, trying to not let all of his focus be pulled to Sherlock’s hand massaging his cock through his jeans. Sherlock bit down on the skin just below John’s ear, making him moan once more.
"Does Mary ever blow you like this?" Sherlock murmured, kissing his way along the shaft with a smirk.
"Done for the day, love?" Sherlock asked, not looking up from where he was tattooing a young man's side. John gave him a quick kiss on the temple before taking a seat in the metal chair at the desk. Instead of opening his book to read some more, he sat back and watched Sherlock. Man, did he love him.
Sherlock glanced upward, up the stairs towards the door of 221B, panic evident in his face for just a second. "You should go, John."
"Thanks," John muttered, turning and leaving. He had checked the whorehouse last night, after his initial look for Sherlock at Baker Street had turned up empty; he had double-checked the flat this morning in case Sherlock had returned, but still no sight of him. John began his way towards Abernathy street.
"I know, love," John drew his attention away again, kissing him more deeply this time. "I'm saying we can start on the sex part early."
John looked up from the book in his lap to where Sherlock was typing away on his laptop at the desk. He furrowed his brow. "For?"
"Look, um, I don't know - how much experience you have, and uh, what your parents were like or if Mycroft raised you and what Mycroft maybe told you growing up, but - "
As if on cue, the older Holmes brother appeared. John figured he must have left in a rush - no umbrella, and his face looked flushed.
Sherlock took a long draw off his cigarette, sure that the boy could hear his heart thumping against his chest.
They laid in bed naked together after eating, sharing gentle, tender kisses, hands exploring each other's bodies slowly and with growing comfort.
Sherlock turned his head and kissed him, soft and gentle, searching. John let it last for several long seconds before pulling away, meeting Sherlock's gaze.
“Um, well, I know it’s really early in our relationship,” John muttered, staring at his feet again. “But, um, well, I’ve been behind on rent for a few months, and I got an eviction notice from my landlord today, and - “
John arched an eyebrow to himself. For Sherlock to use the word 'please', he must really have wanted some chocolate.
John dropped his fork, letting it clatter onto his plate with a sigh. “It’s Friday, Sherlock, and I seriously don’t think you’ve eaten anything since our lunch date on Tuesday. And you barely ate anything there!”
“What a shame,” John smirked, his fingers running across the dampening crotch of Sherlock’s boxers. “But I’m glad to be the first, because
“The point of the matter is,” Mycroft cleared his throat pointedly. “Is that I can have it taken care of, if you wish.”
"This is a family matter, Greg,"  Mycroft hissed, and it was impossible to miss the look of hurt on Lestrade's face. "We can't afford for your boys at the Yard to botch this up and let this man go free. I'm dealing with it my way. If you don't like it, arrest me."
"Thanks," Sherlock came up to stand behind him, his hand absently playing with the hair at the nape of John's neck. His cheeks looked to be tinted green, as if he was ill.
“C’mon, John.” Sherlock mumbled, his cheeks positively crimson now. John did it again, lower this time, his hands massaging the outer parts of Sherlock’s thighs. He unbuttoned Sherlock’s jeans and let them fall, smirking even wider when he saw the bulge in Sherlock’s black and blue spotted boxers. He licked it, the fabric rough on his tongue, and Sherlock made an obscene, delicious sound, flinging one arm out to catch himself on the desk as his knees buckled.
"Or you'll be begging before I'm done with you," John murmured into his ear, his head ducking down and teeth scraping against the side of Sherlock's neck. Sherlock let out a surprised moan, his knees actually buckling this time, his cock quickly hardening his jeans - he knew John, pressed against him, could feel it. John smirked, his own leg hiking up, knee dragging along the erection and drawing another long, low moan from the man beneath him.
“Who - ?” John began, but stopped when he saw Sherlock’s face. Sherlock watched Victor leave, breathing heavily, then stood, his boots pounding heavily on the shop’s tile.
“You don’t have to thank me, John.” Sherlock replied, moving past John and making his way back downstairs.
"Breakfast'll be ready when you get out," John smirked at him, getting new eggs from the fridge. Sherlock nodded slowly, mind hazy as he excused himself to the restroom and stripped.
"Less talking," John managed, voice choked a bit as he gave Sherlock's hair a particularly hard tug. Sherlock arched an eyebrow.
“The past few days have proven otherwise,” John retorted, buttoning up his jeans. “Besides, quit complaining, you get to spend the whole day with your boyfriend and I’ll have a chance to get some homework done while you’re tattooing.”
“Yeah, he’s had a rough few days.” John replied in a mutter, his cheeks going slightly red. “Fell off the wagon, you know.”
“I eat enough,” Sherlock huffed, settling into a booth with his knees pulled to his chest. He took a sip of his latte.
Sherlock knew he must look terribly thin. Whether it was the drugs or the possible HIV remained to be seen. He nodded a bit, watching her pad away. He checked his phone - sixteen text messages from John. He pocketed his mobile again. She returned moments later.
John padded into the living room, holding a glass of water in front of Sherlock’s curled up form until the other reluctantly took it, downing half of it with ease.
“How dare you insinuate that Detective Inspector Lestrade and I’s relationship extends anything beyond professional?”
John chuckled, kissing him on the jaw. "Of course I'm serious, love. Marry me. We can have the wedding in the spring."
John did as he was told, removing his shirt as he stretched out on the chair. Sherlock stopped, his eyebrows going up in mild alarm.
"James is out of town," Molly told him, and Sherlock glared at her, burrowing deeper under his blanket. The silent treatment for John, then.
“It’s not like I impregnated him on fucking purpose,” John muttered under his breath, his voice trembling. “I can’t believe…”
“Shall we go inside?” He asked, throwing his cigarette on the ground. John smiled at him as they made their way into the diner.
“You should get one,” Sherlock told him from across the cubicle. “I’ll do it myself, even; won’t take long, and my next appointment is in three hours, anyway.”
Sherlock felt his heart sink even further. “I was going to tell you eventually. It just didn’t seem like something you bring up on a first date, you know?”
John met the man's gaze evenly, glaring a bit, until the man disappeared into 221B and John was left standing on the staircase, alone. He pretended not to hear Sherlock's scream as he left the building.
"And why is that, Sherlock? Why are you keeping this a secret?" Molly lowered her voice. "If someone is hurting you - "
"Look, Molly, just - please just don't say anything, okay? For me?" He put on his puppy dog eyes and stuck out his bottom lip. Molly sighed.
Two days passed. Sherlock didn’t show up for work on either, even though John kept a careful eye out for him, and waited after the flower shop closed just to see if he had missed Sherlock within the tattoo shop.
John heard sniggering and turned around to see the girl, Donovan, laughing to herself behind her hands as she watched Sherlock wash his hands and pull on non-latex gloves.
"Great, what, I got a drug dealer with a conscience?" Sherlock snapped, digging out a wad of cash from his pocket. "C'mon, Seb. Please."
"So what, this is an intervention?" Sherlock drawled, doing his best to sound bored even as panic rose in his chest.
Sherlock had stopped breathing, his eyes trained on the paper before them, running his slender fingers over them absently. “Interesting.”
It was a bit past midnight when the guests finally left the Baker Street residence. It didn't take long for the two remaining men to take themselves to bed, curled together under the blanket, Sherlock's head on John's chest.
"I'm not going back there, Mycroft." Sherlock leaned against the counter, screwing his eyes shut tight.
"John told me," she replied softly, then held up a pharmacy bag and an order of takeout. "And I brought you your meds and some food."
The answer popped into his mind just as the actual figure strode into the coffee shop, piercings glinting in the sunlight, not even noticing John as he walked to the counter to order.
Sherlock stumbled a bit, feeling sick. He pocketed the package and made his way home, stepping into the empty, sterile flat and letting the loneliness wash over him.
"You're not my boyfriend, John!" Sherlock snapped, pausing outside of his bedroom to door to turn and snarl at him. "Or my parent. Just fuck off."
Sherlock shivered, licking his lips anxiously, knees threatening to buckle as his hips pushed up to meet John's. "Or what?"
SH? John swallowed past the lump in his throat and sat back, his mind racing. Who in the hell could SH be?
“I can’t spend another day moping around this flat,” Sherlock snapped, and John let go of his hand. Sherlock turned to him, his gaze softening.
“Shut up,” Sherlock snapped, switching on the machine. “And stay still.” He bent his head down, putting needle to skin without any hesitation. Victor did as he was told, smirking the entire hour it took for Sherlock to tattoo him. John sat and watched in fascination, letting out a soft ‘wow’ when Sherlock sprayed the fresh ink with green soap and then wiped it with a soft paper towel.
Sherlock entered Baker Street and closed the door behind him, peeling off his jacket and throwing his keys onto the floor by the door.
“Up and at ‘em,” John murmured, gently pulling Sherlock to his feet. Sherlock grumbled, retreating into his hoodie as he slowly stood. John noticed that Sherlock’s entire body was shaking; he silently followed John to the car, climbing into the front seat before he even began to put his boots on.
“Since the first night you stayed at Baker Street,” Sherlock mumbled, heat rising in his cheeks. “I swiped it from the laundry before you could take it back.”
“So when Lestrade said you were propositioning someone for drugs, he definitely did not mean that you were offering someone sex in exchange for dope?”
He whisked away once more and returned with a glass of wine. John looked a bit dumbfounded, and pulled Sherlock to the side.
The letter was dated three days before Friday. Hands shaking, John stuffed the papers back into their envelope and put everything back the way it was. Picking up his mug of tea again, he began to browse the bookshelves, stopping when he saw an entire shelf dedicated to what looked like Sherlock’s journals. He paused, considering, then shook his head as guilt overwhelmed him. There were just certain boundaries he felt he shouldn’t cross, and looking through Sherlock’s journals was one of them. Picking up an Arthur Conan Doyle book instead, he curled up in Sherlock’s chair with his mug and began reading.
Sherlock shook his head back and forth like a shaggy dog, trying to shut his brain up. He wasn’t falling for the flower shop kid. Some flirting and a cup of coffee meant nothing, not in the grand scheme of things.
Sherlock made a soft humming noise, working slowly and expertly, his tongue pushing over the length as he listened to John mutter blasphemies in lust and confusion.
John stared at him for a few moments before shaking his head, turning and leaving the flat. He passed a man on his way down, the man going up; he had sunken eyes with bags under them, buzz-cut brunette hair whittled into a widow's peak on his forehead, straight, white teeth that flashed John a smile as they passed each other.
“Send them back,” Sherlock called in reply, not looking up from his artwork. A young man in his twenties appeared; his skin was perfect, an olive brown, complimented by bright green eyes and untidy black hair. He cleared his throat; Sherlock looked up, immediately stiffening.
Sherlock took a long, anxious draw off his cigarette before responding. “Heroin, coke, alcohol, ecstasy, crack, you name it…” He swallowed, looking away, suddenly embarrassed by how much he was talking. “Heroin, mostly, though. It was really my vice.”
“Ready for work?” He said casually, pushing past Sherlock to collect his bookbag. Sherlock lit a forlorn cigarette.
“They worked, didn’t they?” Sherlock deadpanned, glancing at John out of the corner of his eye with a smile. He reached out with his left hand, patting the tattooing chair. “Take a seat.”
"There's tea," John told him, watching him as Sherlock entered the room. Sherlock rubbed at his eyes, his mouth tasting distinctly of vomit. He wandered over to the counter, forgoing the tea in favor of making coffee.
He was doing just so when he saw the interesting man for the first time. He sat on the counter, eyes scanning the front lobby of the tattoo parlor through the shop’s glass front, when t
“Is not who you’re talking to at the moment,” Lestrade replied, and John could hear the smirk in his voice. “He is with me, though. Showed up at my door nearly blackout drunk. Keeps saying something about a baby.”
When he woke up, it had gone dark outside, leaving his room pitch black. He sat up, feeling a bit better, and reached for the light, stopping when he heard hushed voices drifting into his room from the sitting room.
The teen was back to smirking, running the back of his hand over his mouth - was he wearing lipstick? John realized with a small flutter in his stomach - and pulling at the several lip rings that rested there.
Sherlock decided he was done with this conversation, picking up his coffee mug and retreating sullenly to his bedroom where he could have withdrawal symptoms in peace. To his mild surprise, John didn't follow, instead allowing Sherlock to sit on the edge of his bed alone in complete silence. Sherlock didn't know if he was grateful for this or not.  He set the cup of coffee on his nightstand and curled up in the fetal position on the mattress, fighting a wave of nausea. Somehow, he was able to sleep again.
“Of course not.” Sherlock scoffed, rolling his eyes, but John still felt as if Sherlock was lying. Sherlock took another draw off his cigarette.
John Watson rolled over onto his back and blinked away a bit of sleep, frowning in confusion. There was no way -
“I got it when I was in foster care,” John offered, watching Sherlock with a careful gaze. “One of the other kids had found a gun, and it went off when we were in the backyard.”
He locked his bedroom door behind him and got dressed quickly, throwing on another pair of jeans, his boots, and a large, oversized hoodie. He took a look at himself in the mirror on the back of his door - he had serious bag under his eyes, his cheeks sunken in, his jaw line sharp and shaded with stubble. He looked like shit.
“So,” Lestrade stood once the team was finished, Mycroft quickly following suit. “We’ll be back to check in tomorrow. John, would you mind staying with him for the night?”
"Well we have to figure something out," Molly said, scrunching up her nose. A second later, John realized why; the smell of cooking heroin wafted through the apartment.  John made to go into the living room, but Molly grabbed his arm to stop him.
“Glad you agree,” John muttered smugly, catching Sherlock’s lips in a deep kiss. “Now put your pants on.”
“A bit, yeah.” Sherlock smiled softly and poured their mugs, handing one to Lestrade before taking his and Mycroft’s into the living room. He handed the mug carefully to his brother. A moment passed between them.
"Why're you wearing sunglasses?"  John asked again, reaching for the large sunglasses obscuring half of Sherlock's face. "It's raining and overcast."
“Whatever,” John muttered in an embarrassed tone, his cheeks growing even redder. “Since you aren’t going to eat anything, do you want me to walk you home?”
"John," Sherlock managed, hips arching, desperate for any contact or friction he could get. John pulled his body away, smirking.
“You’re the one always getting me hot and bothered in public,” John muttered under his breath, pressing a quick, hot kiss to the underside of Sherlock’s neck.
“Just because you’re trans doesn’t mean I don’t want to date you.” John stated, arching an eyebrow at Sherlock.
“No, apparently you only sleep with people for drugs.” John muttered, missing the flicker of hurt that crossed Sherlock’s face as they got into his car.
“Must you make everything dirty?” John sighed dramatically as they came upon their respective shops; Sherlock made work of finishing his cigarette, his next appointment in ten minutes.
"Lestrade and your brother are both here, wondering where the hell you are!" John hissed from his end of the line. Sherlock put a hand to his face, feeling the fresh bruise on his cheekbone. He would have to stop on the way home and get more concealer.
“How were the withdrawals, Sherlock?” Lestrade asked, hands in his coat pockets as he joined Sherlock in the kitchen.
“I’m here,” Lestrade said softly, taking a seat beside him. Sherlock leaned his head on Lestrade’s shoulder, sniffling, and John realised that he was crying.
“Transgender,” Sherlock clarified, clearing his throat. Have to keep the cool demeanor. “Tarnished the family name and all, got addicted to drugs because of it, and my brother wasn’t going to keep me around when I was a disgrace.”
“Erm, Sherlock,” John managed, trying and failing to keep his breath from hitching. “What’re you doing?”
"Sherlock has some weird emotions sometimes," Lestrade nodded sagely. "He loved his dad, even after everything that bastard did to him."
John stepped out of the shower a little while later and got dressed quickly, excited to meet his boyfriend for lunch. He grabbed his keys off his dresser and practically skipped into the kitchen, thumbing through his unopened mail before he left. He stopped when he saw the letter from his landlord.
“Oi!” Donovan launched a paper wad at the two of them. “Keep your dirty talking in the bedroom, Freak!”
"Ms. Hooper, let me see," Mycroft asked, voice icy. Molly, a shiver of fear running down her spine, obediently relinquished the paper. Sherlock bit back a growl as Mycroft read the paper out loud.
Sherlock took John into his mouth and the former broke off stammering, hands tangling in Sherlock's curls as his eyelids fluttered.
Ice cold water washed over his face. Sherlock spluttered, sitting up, the void of sleep quickly dissipating from his brain.
"Do those plans include him laying hands on you again?" Mycroft asked, his voice light even though the hand holding his umbrella had gone white-knuckled in its grip.
“Does it matter?” Sherlock snapped, getting defensive despite himself. “I understand you may no longer want to pursue a romantic relationship with me anymore, but that doesn’t mean we have to drag my genitalia into this conversation.”
“More importantly,” John lowered his voice, staring Sherlock down. “What kind of shit did you do to get fostered out?”
"You look," he told her, leaning against the wall next to the counter. She tossed him an indecipherable look and picked up the paper, turning it over decisively. She glanced it over and then looked up at him again, nodding her head a bit. Sherlock looked down at his boots.
Sherlock slotted his key into the lock and let himself into 221B, feeling exhausted all of a sudden and sighing when John was waiting for him.
Sherlock whimpered, nodding, his pace on John’s cock quickening. John had to fight himself to not be too rough, his hand rubbing Sherlock’s cock in slow, tantalizing circles. He could see the way it pulsated through the taller, younger man; the way Sherlock’s eyes fluttered, his mouth moving as he babbled silently, rocking closer and closer to the edge -
“Come on, then.” He said, dropping his cigarette on the ground and crushing it with the heel of his boot as he got out of the car. He began walking towards the clinic, his face unreadable. John shoved his car keys into his pocket and followed.
He did as he was told, turning to face the hallway so his back was to Sherlock. He heard the other man shuffling around, shimmying out of the binder and rummaging through the wardrobe for another shirt. A minute or so passed.
“Just came in to do a bit of studying,” John fought to keep his voice under control. “Got an interesting email.”
John opened his mouth to respond but was interrupted by the flat’s door opening. Lestrade strode in, followed by a man in an expensive three-piece suit carrying an umbrella. The man from the photo.
“Top one is when she died, and the bottom one is the date of the first abortion.” Sherlock kept his voice low so none of the other artists would hear. “It’s just interesting, that that’s the one you chose instinctively. You chose it without even knowing that it’s the biggest part of me I’ve put out in the world.”
"I need a cigarette," he muttered, not really listening to her. He turned and took the stairs, practically gasping for air when he finally pushed his way through the stairwell exit onto the roof. Jumping was tempting; he forced himself to hang back, lighting a cigarette and overlooking the city.
“I’m not good at this, John.” Sherlock said quietly. “I’ve never had any experience with this kind of thing, okay? I don’t know all of the rules.”
“Would you mind, erm,” he cleared his throat, sounding embarrassed. “Would you mind...turning around?”
“I’m being professional,” Sherlock replied, his gaze steady as he stared Victor down. “And don’t you ever call me that again, or this machine won’t be the only thing I hurt you with.”
When John awoke in bed the next morning - weird, he didn’t remember leaving the sofa - it was once again alone and to another note on the bedside table.
Sherlock leaned down, catching John's lips with his own. John returned the kiss full force, and suddenly Sherlock was pressed up against the wall, John's hands digging into his hips.
"You'll just worsen things, John. We're in harm reduction and damage control at this point." She tossed a glance towards the living room. "Maybe it would just be best if you left, for now. I'll text you with updates, okay?"
They waved to him as they departed, closing the door behind them. Sherlock curled up on the couch next to John’s sleeping figure. He watched the older man for a moment, then turned his attention to the telly and turned it on.
"It's okay," Sherlock exhaled smoke slowly. "She's a lovely woman, John, and she raised an amazing man."
“You sure?” John asked again, peeling off the old gauze and applying antiseptic to the stitches on Sherlock’s side. Sherlock nodded again, his breath hitching in a way that told John it wasn’t from the antiseptic stinging. He smirked, applying fresh gauze and tape, then pressed a slow, sensual kiss to Sherlock’s naval.
“Yeah, Victor was the one before you.” She nodded casually. “The Freak used to come in with bruises all over his face and arms, sometimes he’d be hungover, one time he walked in and there was still a goddamn needle hanging out of his arm.” She looked John up and down. “And before that bloke was Jim, and Jim’s been the worst of them all so far. Tony found the Freak by the dumpster out back once, beat all to hell, couldn’t even tell him what day it was.”
“Fading rope marks on his wrists, the hickie on his neck, and the lipstick stain on the collar of his shirt.” Sherlock said matter-of-factly. “He’s into being tied up, and apparently by a woman.”
“Yeah,” Lestrade nodded, looking at the floor then back up at John, his eyes fiery. “Let me just remind you, John, that I’ve raised him, since he was a young teen. Sherlock’s the closest thing I have to a kid, and if you’ve hurt him, I’m gonna hurt you.”
Sherlock’s smirk faded immediately as his cheeks grew rosy. “Shut up,” he muttered, scuffing his toes embarrassedly against the hardwood floors. Mycroft allowed himself to smirk as he drank the rest of his tea.
“Sherlock,” John sighed, running a hand through the soft brunette curls. “Did you want to keep the baby?”
“Of course you can stay at Baker Street,” Sherlock said automatically, exhaling smoke through his nose. “You should have said something earlier, John.”
“Recreational use is in no way the same thing as getting out of control.” Sherlock muttered, pulling a blanket off of the floor and covering himself with it, pulling the hem to his chin. John snorted. Both Lestrade and Mycroft turned to him.
John leaned forward, palms against the counter. "Mary is coming over later. Part of our agreement with Mycroft was that neither you or I can leave the flat, remember?"
Sherlock was staring at him now, the movement of his hands automatic as he continued to prep everything. “You were in foster care?”
“You don’t have to worry about it anymore,” Mycroft assured him. “I have it taken care of. This situation was the proof I needed.” He tapped his umbrella on the ground and turned towards the door. “I’ll be in touch, John. Make sure you take care of him, okay?” And with that, he was gone.
John blinked; he would never have imagined Sherlock as an inherently violent person, and yet the threat sent shivers even down his spine. Victor, however, took it all in stride, smiling cheerfully.
“No thanks,” John said flatly, watching Sherlock crack open the bottle and chug half of it as they stood there. Sherlock shrugged and sauntered to his chair, where he curled up like a graceful cat and nursed his beer.
"John Hamish Watson!" His mother slapped him on the shoulder. "That's not nice. It's not good to talk ill of the dead."
"Is it any of your business?" He turned, walking towards the hallway. John, determined, followed him.
“Is the Freak’s ex, yeah.” She nodded, the both of them looking up as Sherlock re-entered the shop, looking a lot less angry. Tony stopped him on his way in.
"I always used to think what a good little slut you could be for me, Sherlock, how good and obedient you could be, how I could tell Lestrade and your brother and Molly what a good fucktoy you are for me - "
John continued snooping with his tea in hand, crossing first and foremost to the letters on the mantelpiece. Pulling them from underneath the ridiculously large knife, he began to rifle through them. Most of them were from Mycroft, one was from a gynecologist, and the one on the very bottom was to Sherlock, from one William Holmes. Curious, he pulled the papers from the envelope and unfolded them.
A soft smile was playing on Sherlock’s lips. He pulled his right sleeve up more, showing John an identical piece on the inside of his forearm, only this one was ordained by two dates, each on the top and bottom.
“It’s a lovely place, John.” Sherlock said softly. “Fits your personality and aesthetic very well. Reminds me of your jumpers.”
Sherlock shook his head stubbornly, moaning loudly when John bit his neck again. John licked the bite for a few seconds before continuing.
“You literally look like you’re ninety pounds,” John chided as he took the booth seat opposite. “And can you not sit like a normal bloke?”
“No,” Mycroft murmured. “But they weren’t sure how attached to the pregnancy you were, and neither did we.”
“That’s perfectly fine,” John murmured softly, planting a gentle kiss below Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock leaned on him, pushing them both into a lying position on the old couch. They were both asleep in minutes.
"Both of my parents unfortunately passed.""Oh dear," John's mother hugged him again. "I'm so sorry to hear that, dear."
"No, that happened when we slept together and you failed to mention that you did in fact remember doing so."
"Yes. Of course yes, John. Of course I do." Sherlock stared at him. "But we only just met three months ago, you're a med student, and after everything - "
John shivered at the huskiness in Sherlock’s voice, licking his lips subconsciously. Sherlock’s smirk had returned, his lip ring glinting in the light pouring in from the kitchen. John leaned back, trying to hide his hard-on. Sherlock sat his tea down on the coffee table and sauntered towards John, straddling him with ease. John leaned back even more and gasped slightly at the friction, looking up at Sherlock. Sherlock grinded down slowly, a smirk playing on his lips as he kissed John’s neck.
“Sherlock!” John chided from the kitchen, watching Sherlock’s lithe figure collapse onto the couch. “I told you to stay in bed.”
“Easy,” John said quickly, helping Sherlock sit his back up against the headboard. Sherlock waved him off with an impatient growl.
"We aren't going to talk about it," Sherlock muttered, opening the fridge as Molly set the food on the counter. He took out a beer for himself, then offered her one. Unsure what else to do, she took it, taking a sip of it before she began to partition the food.
“Yeah,” Sherlock huffed out a laugh, pulling his denim jacket on closer around him. “My foster dad, basically.”
“I don’t want him to come home.” Sherlock replied, so soft it was barely audible. “Every time I think about it, I want to do more drugs.”
"And what about the one you tried to cover up on your face, hm? That concealer is the wrong shade, by the way."
"I told you we were going to his dad's funeral," John hissed in his mother's ear. She had the sense to look a bit guilty.
"You have to tell him eventually. Or what, you're going to stay in this flat forever?" It was Mary, sounding accusatory. Sherlock paused, listening.
“I love you,” John murmured, half-asleep. Sherlock nuzzled closer, soft heat creeping up his cheeks.
“Hush, you.” John muttered, cheeks going rosy as he brought two mugs of tea into the living room. “Before I do put that mouth to better use.”
"Sherlock," Mycroft let out an annoyed sigh. "You have to get over this thing between you and Sherrinford. Get clean, come to Christmas, have a good time."
“John,” Sherlock whimpered, and the desperation in his voice made John shiver as their rhythms matched. “John, I’m - “
“I didn’t even know,” John murmured despite himself. His hands were still shaking. Sherlock bit his scabbed-up lip.
“I love you too,” he mumbled, a huge grin overtaking his face. John wondered if he remembered anything from last night.
“Do you want the list?” Sherlock’s nimble fingers slipped to the inside pocket of his jacket, pulling out a folded piece of paper and handing it to John. “There’s always a list.”
John managed to contain his smile only slightly. “Everything’s mostly packed except for the desk and the bedside table.”
"See you later Fox," Donovan called as Sherlock and John left the shop. They stepped outside and Sherlock lit a cigarette. Hand in hand, the two walked home.
He returned a short time later, carrying a bag with a box of pads and packages of chocolate inside. Sherlock was right where John left him, looking contemplative, holding what John assumed to be a hot water bottle to his stomach. John was glad he picked up some paracetamol.
“What’re you guys doing here?” He muttered, standing carefully and making his way into the kitchen. “And would you like some tea?”
"When I would touch myself, thinking about you and your beautiful body, thinking about how pretty you look with a cock in your mouth, thinking about stretching you open and feeling every inch of you - "
John watched in horror as the man took Sherlock's head and slammed it into the kitchen counter. Sherlock only whimpered at the violence, but when he pulled his head upright again, the stapled gash had broken open and crimson was pouring down his face. He avoided John's gaze.
“Alright,” the doctor said as she entered, taking a seat on the stool in front of the bed and pulling on latex gloves. “Since this isn’t your first time here, I assume you don’t need me to go through the procedure step by step with you?”
“Watch it.” Mycroft muttered, before turning on his heel and going back to his brother. “Are you alright for the moment, Sherlock?”
Sherlock’s cheeks immediately turned crimson. “Only if you promise to wear only the leather jacket.”
“Yes, it is.” Sherlock murmured, his gaze soft. They walked in silence for a few minutes, Sherlock smoking his cigarette and John watching his feet as he thought. After a moment, they came upon the tattoo parlor. John let go of his hand.
“I’m looking for Sherlock. We’re supposed to be - getting lunch together.” John’s eyes darted nervously to the floor. The girl let out a laugh.
"You haven't told him you're positive yet? Sherlock, think about the people you're putting at risk - "
“Feeling okay?” John murmured as he started the car. Sherlock only stared out of the window in reply.
“Like I said, he’s never liked anyone, John. And certainly not like he likes you. As I told you before, he wouldn’t leave just anyone alone in his flat, with all his secrets.”
John didn't bother knocking when he returned the next day, instead letting himself into the building with his old key. When he got into 221B, it was to find an unlikely guest sitting on the loveseat across from Sherlock; Molly, who looked apologetic as she met his gaze. John looked from her to Sherlock, curled up with the blanket again, eyes trained unseeingly on the television; he was high, no doubt about that - but the gash on his forehead had been cleaned and properly sutured and bandaged, his curls carefully shorn to a manageable length.
“Partly because of the trans thing, yeah.” Lestrade took a sip of his iced coffee. “Mostly because he’s self-medicating his PTSD. Anyway, they never convicted his dad of it. Got him on a shitload of mob-related charges, so he’s in prison for life, but Sherlock’s still pretty fucked up about it.”
"And what has Sherlock Holmes ever done for you, then?" Mary's voice rose a bit. "What has he done besides lie to you and keep things from you?"
When he awoke in the late afternoon of the next day, it was to the smell of cooking pasta and a breeze coming through the previously-shut windows of his bedroom. John had laid him out some clothes and a towel for a shower - with a groan, Sherlock forced himself to sit up, shaking badly and struggling to see straight. Standing as best he could, he stumbled from his room and into the kitchen, where John was indeed cooking.
“I just want to know what I’m getting myself into,” John said bluntly, not looking up from his screen. “I don’t want some asshole to kidnap me and bust up my kneecaps because of family business.”
One sip, however, was enough to reinforce that smile on the perfectly drawn lips of the detective: it was perfect... As only John could do.
At a first glance the cause of death seemed obvious: a slightly coagulated blood stain spread across the pavement by the man’s head but extracting a pair of latex gloves from his pocket, John crouched, carefully folding his stiff leg and examined the body.
Ten minutes later Hamish was again secured against Sherlock's chest in the baby carrier and the two men resumed their exploration of the Zoo.
Emma quickly shook her head and ran towards Sherlock, grabbing the sleeve of his dressing gown, surprising everyone in the room.
The British official observed the young man's malnourished body (rejoicing briefly when he saw no marks on his arms that testified to the use of narcotics), his young face,  his short brown hair washed recently, his deep and serious brown eyes.
-It seems that Hamish is not a morning person... He was in a bad mood until he had breakfast- Sherlock said, meeting the doctor's blue eyes.- Just like you-he added.
John clenched his jaw and nodded, ending the hug and then heading towards the seventeen steps that would lead him to his flat.
It was something so rare and important that even the passage of a comet over Baker Street would pale in comparison.
"The last time you had to deal with journalists, you loudly proclaimed your heterosexuality” he said.
So at least you'll have a chance to see your doctor tonight... Even though I don't know how much you're going to like to see him completely drunk.
A well-orchestrated unforeseen incident had called Gregory back to Scotland Yard that morning very early, leaving him free to implement his plan: today was the day when Mycroft Holmes ended the shameful relationship between the detective and that young boy.
He looked up at the ceiling, contemplating the years they had ahead of them. Would every night be like this one? Doubtful (this night would be rather unbeatable, but he had a feeling they’d give it a run). Every night he’d spent alone in the last twenty years taught him that every subsequent night spent with John next to him would be infinitely better.
John lays against the down pillow behind him and takes his cock in hand. “You’re beautiful, Sherlock. I love watching you like this.”
It was delicious- light and flavorful with hints of a floral aroma on his tongue. The perfect temperature, it was smooth going down his throat. He expected to feel a great shift, for something to happen, but nothing.
Jacqueline stood over them in shock, holding the first aid kit rather unhelpfully. “Go get the AED kit. I’m going to deliver a shock,” he commanded, barely giving her a glance, mostly to get her out of the room. Sweat dripped down his forehead as he pressed into the woman’s chest to the hypnotic beat of Stayin’ Alive. But he was beginning to doubt that the woman- Diana, was it?- would be revived. Regardless, he continued his efforts, then with the AED until EMS arrived ten minutes later and took over.
.” She fastened silver earrings (frets of Rosie’s guitar playing a love song) with a playful roll of her eyes.
She got up to fill the kettle, but to her dismay, the tap wasn’t working. She went into the loo to try the sink, and nothing. The shower wouldn’t turn on. How was she supposed to get ready for the rehearsal dinner tonight without running water? She even searched for a complimentary bottle of water, and found nothing.
“Thank you, Mrs. Liu, for your honesty,” Sherlock said. “Now, back to Jacqueline.” His entire being went from posh and polite to menacing in half a second. The suspect had gone limp in Lestrade’s arms, having lost the will to fight any longer.
Sherlock’s newly-bandaged head shot up to look at John. “What?” Ridiculous. Gaslighting. “I don’t know what you…”
Strands of short, fine black hair wove themselves between Rosie’s fingers. They were memories of a starless midnight when she’d kissed Stella outside of the underground bar the night they met. Soft, deep brown eyes were countless cappuccinos on grey London weekend mornings after indulgent lie-ins. The already-fading pink flush on Stella’s cheeks was the reflection of the Manx sunset on a rocky shore when Stella had proposed. Rosie could have spent the better half of the afternoon cataloguing the colors of her soon-to-be wife, but Stella stayed true to her word through hell and high water, and she insisted on going to lunch with her mum.
Sherlock would not give him the satisfaction, especially not after his brother so rudely interrupted his afternoon sulk. “I’m not going.”
Mrs. Hudson greets them both with kisses. “Oh, John. It’s good to see you up and about. I’ve been so worried.” She takes Rosie into her arms, who coos “Huddy!” in delight. “Poor thing, she’s had so much loss in her life already. She’s a strong little thing, though, just like her Daddies.”
Whatever news beckoned at 5:54 was never good, so she carefully extrapolated herself from Yasmin’s grasp and hurried towards the sound of insistent knocking.
This Sherlock was staring at her from down the hallway, decidedly not from Dad’s desktop computer, but the stiffness was so very much the same, Rosie nearly laughed.
Yasmin’s perfectly shaped brows shot up. “So does this confirm our long-standing Dr. Watson-Is-Bi theory?” Yasmin asked, referring to their lengthy discussions about Rosie’s father’s potential closetedness as two queer teens with nothing better on which to ruminate.
“Yes, John. You need to sleep. You’re delirious, grieving, and going through withdrawal.” He attempts to move John’s arm, but it stays firm.
“Okay. Tell me about the case.” Sherlock took a breath to launch into the details, but John had a caveat, “And Sherlock, if it’s anything like a case of a glow-in-the-dark rabbit I swear I will wring Mycroft’s neck.”
People hesitantly started getting up from their chairs, collecting themselves. The uninvited crowd started to disperse.
“It was adequate for my purposes. But he was a bad knock-off replacement for what I really wanted.” Sherlock looks meaningfully at John, who reaches for his hand, intertwining their fingers on top of Sherlock’s stomach. “And John, I intend to shag you more than adequately tonight.”
“How do you want to come, John?” Sherlock deepened his voice and lowered his lips to John’s ear. “Do you want to come inside me?”
Dad nodded, and Rosie leapt up to hug him, sinking into his jumper. He wrapped his arms tightly around her, and if she could, Rosie would have tied his arms there so he could never let go. The moment of separation came far too soon, however, and Dad gestured for the two of them to sit on the edge of Rosie’s hard, single bed.
Sherlock reached down to undo John’s belt and the zip on John’s trousers. “Absolutely not,” he assured, pushing down John’s trousers for emphasis.
John shifted so that his hand rested on Sherlock’s chest, his left leg thrown over Sherlock’s thighs, and his head on the same pillow.
“Sherlock, relax,” John said gently, moving the fingers currently in his hair in a circular motion as if to pet him.
“I love you too, Rose,” Stella replied, notes of anxiety playing in her voice. She was so beautiful, with her soft skin and her sharp jawline and her eyes like infinity pools. In the end, it was so simple. All she needed for clarity were a few choice words. Now, Rosie knew exactly what she wanted.
“What?” Sherlock panted, thrusting up into John’s palm. John answered with a questioning glance. “You, looking at me-
Clara stands and smoothes her dress, the one she’s been wearing for far too long. “Well, that’s my cue to leave. John, if you change your mind about the flat-”
“I’ll tell you the details later. You need to sleep,” Sherlock replied, fighting against his impulses to pick John’s brain.
Mrs. Liu closed her eyes, the first hint of a crack in her composure. “Lord Moran was my ex-husband.”
“I will if it means I can get my mouth on you sooner.” John was pressed so close, he could feel Sherlock’s voice rumble in his chest.
John turned to her. “I used to think my wife would never hurt anyone, and it turns out she was a professional assassin. Love makes you see what you want to see.” Sherlock shot a meaningful glance to John. That must have been difficult for him to admit.
“Glad you think so.” God, he loved this blushing man with every fiber of his being. John pulled him down by the nape of his neck for a slow, morning snog. Sherlock came willingly, pulling John’s lips between his own with unexpected immediate enthusiasm.
When he knocked, Yasmin opened the door, dressed in a soft green pantsuit with full makeup and a styled updo, a classy upgrade from her usual clay-stained rompers. But, he supposed, his morning suit was a far cry from his typical ripped jumper and jeans.
Sherlock bristled. John burned him, and now he was making casual jokes about their life together. His stomach churned.
Stella tilted her pointy chin in Dad’s direction, and the light played off her jawline like a natural sharp. “Your dad’s smiling at his mobile like a teenager.”
expression used to affect John more than he’d care to admit. Now, it only stung. “We’ve got to get back to the hotel to investigate that storage closet.”
“The one who’s just dramatically confessed his love for me since the day we met to a crowd of unsuspecting wedding guests.”
John had to fight every natural instinct not to roll his eyes, or shout, or punch this man. His patients could be
,” John said, taking in the sight of her freshly chopped hair down to her chin. Rosie rolled her eyes.
Mike was the only friend from Before that John regularly kept in touch with, and their conversations were fleeting at best. It had been months since he had last seen the other doctor. It had been at least a year since he’d stepped foot near West Smithfield. John sparingly texted Greg only when the thought occurred, which it hadn’t lately.
John let out a breath. “Sherlock, I -” his mobile started vibrating, “Shit, it’s Harry. I have to take this, say hi to Rosie.”
The image of John imagining Sherlock doing this to him was a powerful aphrodisiac. Sherlock couldn’t stand the extra fabric barrier anymore, and he managed to pull John’s jeans and pants down between strokes and kisses (with some struggle).
So John did. When they finished, they would do a perfunctory clean-up, John would thank George for coming over, and George would be off with a small smile. Neither of them wanted nor needed anything more. George slept with other people. John just wanted an outlet. They used each other for good sex. Occasionally they went out for drinks. The arrangement worked.
The A&E waiting area is crowded with patients. John deduces what they’re in for, and Sherlock deduces how the injury was sustained or where the virus was caught.
Both of Rosie’s friends blushed, caught out. He used to get angry at Sherlock for asking the blunt questions, now he was the one asking them. He read once about “identity fusion,” where people became more like their partner over time. He wondered if it applied long after the relationship ended.
He made the short drive from home back to the Crown Hotel, and decidedly did not scan the lobby for signs of a tall detective as he made his way to Rosie’s bridal suite. Lestrade was nowhere to be seen, either, and it was nearly time to walk down the aisle.
Stella thanked him for his help, and he waved it off. “I cocked up my own wedding by letting my best man do all the work, so it’s only fair I pay it forward now.” He caught traces of knowing glances exchanged between Rosie’s friends, and he was determined to figure out what those meant.
John gaped, nearly knocking over his empty glass in- surprise? relief? anger? on his way to standing. He shook his head vigorously, as if to shake off the phantom voice. It must’ve been a trick of the alcohol, or post-adrenaline exhaustion. It wasn’t unusual for him, he supposed-- hearing voices. One posh, silky, arsehole voice in particular. But it hadn’t happened in years. Wedding stress? God, he needed another pint.
He knew that sentiment all too well. “Now that you’re getting married, he’ll have to make some of his own adventures. Otherwise he’ll punch through the walls out of boredom.” He didn’t dare make the same mistake that
Sherlock had considered picking up random strangers for sexual research, observation, and experimentation exactly four times, but he never followed through. It was a socially precarious practice. There was no reason to be unnecessarily vulnerable when he understood the act itself and the emotional and physical responses it elicited. He
journal, he realized, after opening the first page to see the achingly familiar words “A Strange Meeting” printed there, complete with a goofy picture of his younger self under the title
“She loved you so much, Clara. She did. She’s an idiot for ever leaving you,” he mutters into her hair. Sherlock looks at him from his chair wearing an expression of sad understanding. He’s thinking of when he left John for two years. John’s thinking of the time after Mary’s death.
good, but not enough. He takes his hand out from Sherlock’s trousers and hurriedly undoes his own belt and zip just enough to pull out his cock, so Sherlock can touch it, unrestrained. He doesn’t hesitate. Sherlock’s fingers wrap tightly around the base of John’s cock and stroke, and
Sherlock began undoing John’s getup, pulling him closer by his tie. “I also have regrets about that day.”
They put Rosie to bed upstairs around seven, after another reading of the infamous insect book as the three of them gather on John’s bed. John holds Rosie on his lap, one arm around Sherlock as he reads. Rosie points to the bee and shouts, “Sher!”
John sat at the corner table by the window, in the same creamy cable-knit jumper he’d worn the first time they’d sat there together. It wasn’t that same John, though, because age had weathered him. He was softer, greyer, more familiar. A John of experience.
Stella had gestured with her chin over to the group she’d been sitting with. “My one friend thinks you have a boyfriend. Another thinks you have a girlfriend. I think you’re single.”
Sherlock was still struggling with the lock as the door handle turned. Shit. He ducked underneath the desk, no time to dash to the closet. He was thankful for the wooden back hiding him from view of the door, but if this person needed anything from the desk, he was going to be caught. He started devising an escape plan when the security guard appeared in front of the desk and smiled eerily down at him. Sherlock attempted an escape around the security guard’s bad foot, but this only gave him access to Sherlock’s shoulder, where he plunged a syringe.
John opened his mouth and closed it and opened it again. “I want you,” John said, his voice low. Sherlock nearly whined. “And,” he turned, so he could move the hand from Sherlock’s waist to his cheek. “I love you.
“You done?” John flexed his fists a couple times, and remembered a time a few years ago when he would’ve wanted to use them. Now, he would work through this. He wanted Sherlock enough-
John puffs up. “Your turn. Switch places.” John plops on the bed next to Sherlock, who climbs over him dramatically, stopping to run a hand over his chest and plant an open-mouthed kiss on John’s nipple.
There was Sherlock, scolding John for butchering Rosie’s curls and magically wielding the scissors himself. Sherlock moving her into the dormitory for the first time, verbally ripping her roommate’s family photo collage to shreds. Sherlock standing with Dad as she came out to them, telling her he’d known for years.
John went down to the hotel early that morning, wanting to get a head start on the centrepieces. He had taken the week off work, which hadn’t been an issue. His schedule was slowly edging its way into retirement, and he had already been taking a handful of days off every month. This week, he had deliberately made his way through his extensive checklist of wedding to-dos. Planning a wedding was a hell of a lot of work, and despite having had one himself, he didn’t remember doing half of this stuff last time around.
“Harry loved taking risks, and she loved taking me along. Once, she planned an elaborate scheme to set off a stink bomb in school, and we had lessons cancelled for three days. She always knew how to get what she wanted in the craziest way possible. She was a risk-taking mastermind...until the end.” The room turns somber.
John is reminded of Sherlock’s similar comment some months ago. He nods against Sherlock’s neck. “I think she’d be secretly thrilled for us. She’d act like a right dick about it, though. Her being right all this time.”
“You can call me anytime, you know.” Dad wore a sort of sad smile that nearly brought tears to her eyes in her current state.
“As she should. As you should, too. Sit, please.” Sherlock gestured to a brown leather loveseat with a shag throw on top.
Sherlock mouthed as John’s ear as he softly stroked John to completion for a second time. John came with a low groan, this time in small, separate spurts. Sherlock was uncomfortably hard and completely untouched.
many people could be after it. I’m just not sure how anyone would have found out what it does, or that I was going to be on that very train that day.”
Rosie sipped on the latte, her mind wandering to conversations she’d had with Stella of their families.
Without much to offer in terms of a social life, the conversation between the doctors turned quickly to work, the surgery, the classes Stamford was teaching. John was particularly interested in the newest course offering at Bart’s, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging. “
not you. You barely have a scratch. They had access to classified information and a well-organized plan. They could have tried to kidnap or kill you, but they didn’t.”
A week in London passed quickly. Scotland Yard was inundated with post-holiday cases, and Sherlock spent his days with Lestrade. John was back at the surgery after holiday break. The only thing that had changed was that John was spending nights at 221B, Rosie tucked in his old bedroom. He still had his old flat, though, and occasionally returned there for clothes and items for Rosie.
At this, Stella let out a low chuckle. It eased Rosie a bit, and she relaxed her shoulders. They’d been tense since she brought up the subject of the journal. “Well, very nearly,” she explained, “It’s mostly printouts of Dad’s entries about the two of them on a blog he used to keep. And get this- the blog was
He must have been silent for moments too long to be deemed socially acceptable, because when he resurfaced, Watson was staring at him worriedly. Half her pitta was eaten. He cleared his throat. “Apologies. I haven’t thought about your father in a long time,” he tried to recover, weakly. “So much to sift through.”
The owner was an older gentleman who had lived in the central Taiwan countryside his whole life, growing and selling tea and running the homestay for more adventurous travelers. He spoke with Sherlock in Mandarin:
She picked up an object from the vanity and teased it between her fingers. “I mean it. Could you put this in my hair?” She opened her palm to reveal a white flower hair piece.
John’s groan was so loud, Earl woke up frightened from her kip. He couldn’t take any more of the talking, he wanted this
John’s mouth, on his cock. Even Mind Palace John hadn’t gone there. The imminent reality of this fantasy was making him delirious. That, and John’s hand rubbing harder over his increasingly hard cock.
Sherlock bites his lip like he’s trying hard not to say something. He strides confidently into the kitchen and puts the kettle on. “I’m making tea. Then I’m sending you to bed.” His voice is steady. John hates it.
“Sorry for your loss,” John comforted with an understanding pat on the knee. Neither of John’s parents were alive, so he did understand, in that sense. But Sherlock hypothesized that the real emotional chord that struck for John was a daughter losing a mother. The guilt of raising Rosie without Mary physically wore on John. Xiaowen gave him a sad smile- she could see it, too.
