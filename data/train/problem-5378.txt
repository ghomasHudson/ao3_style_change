“You ready, Dean?” Sam asks, emphatic, right in his ear.
“Cas,” Dean whispers brokenly, and Cas freezes there, myriad of emotions in his pained expression, openly displayed. He’s hurting, same as Dean.
“Sam. Dean. Get to cover. Now.” Castiel speaks urgently, getting up, readying himself. The brothers don’t argue with him, dashing behind the makeshift barricades, guns trained to the doorway.
Dean observes the way Cas’ tongue darts out to lick his upper lip, when he smears the precum down the hard length, thumb tracing the ridge of the head. Cas’ eyes close briefly. He’s really close already; Dean can tell. His mouth opens, shuts, working towards saying something.
When the doorbell rings, he almost jumps out of his skin. Dean walks to the door at an even pace, so no one could think he’s rushing or anything. He opens the door and is immediately greeted by a wide, welcoming smile. Castiel looks more tanned in the fluorescent lighting of the hallway, messy hair looking like someone tried to smooth it down, unsuccessfully.
“What, no girlfriend yet to warm your bed?” Dean actually blushes, but he’s lucky Cas can’t see that in the dark.
“You’ll stay for dinner, right?” He asks quietly, hopeful. Dean nods, not trusting his voice enough to speak yet. How could he say no to that?
Cas collapses partially on top of him, not minding the mess on their stomachs, trying to regain his breath, panting into the nape of Dean’s neck. Dean adjusts his position to fit them on the narrow couch better, trying to free his other arm underneath Cas, so Cas settles on his side, completely lethargic. Kissing Cas’ hair, Dean holds him close, inhaling that familiar smell, and Cas throws his arm and leg over Dean, face buried in his neck. They stay like that for awhile, still riding that high and just existing for each other, skin against skin.
“Okay”, Cas says slowly, questioningly.
, not sure whether to shake hands or hug him, just standing there awkwardly.
Dean manages to think and
"The neck kissing is new. Is this your way of greeting me when you've missed me?" Castiel had murmured, making Dean lift his head, scoffing amusedly.
“Sam, I’m damaged goods, why would he?” Dean scoffs mirthlessly.
Anxiety ramps up in him, making his palms sweat.
"I don't need a goddamn hug, I need a way to make myself stop! Lock me up, kill me, take your fucking pick!" Dean had shouted in his face, but Castiel had seen right through his anger, the sheer terror and grief underneath, so he just had shaken his head, determined.
“Truthfully, I think maybe it was the first time I saw you”, he says, because he has no other answer.
“Jesus fuckin Christ, I was just asking. Stop biting my head off”, he snaps back. Cas is slightly taken back by his comment, but precisely that moment the waiter swoops in, delivering their food. Dean gets a steamy plate of barbecued ribs, and Cas gets handed two bowls, the first one filled with strongly smelling soup, and the second one with some dish with noodles and bits of tofu and vegetables mashed together. They distract themselves with their meals for few minutes, letting the uncomfortable silence stew between them. Dean stubbornly looks at his food, cutting his meat into tiny slices. He can hear Cas stirring his stew, the metallic spoon scraping against the bowl loudly. Well, ain’t this going just fuckin fine. Cas says he’s out in the open, but judging by his reaction, he’d rather have his teeth pulled out rather than opening up about his life. Dean doesn’t even know why he cares. It shouldn’t be a big deal. Doesn’t Cas trust him? His reaction to this conversation few weeks ago was just as reserved and closed off as right now, and Dean’s been circling it endlessly in his mind, trying to figure out is it better to just stay silent or ask about it. He doesn’t want to seem like he’s avoiding it, but Cas’ reaction makes it almost impossible to talk about it like normal human beings.
“Dean!” Sam bellows somewhere unseen, going back and forth between the cars, trying to find him. Dean swallows, his throat dry as sandpaper, mouth tasting like blood. When he opens his mouth to speak, his voice sounds so wrecked and weak he wants to grimace.
“Thanks, Bobby”, Dean mutters, thankful and embarrassed, pulling on his jacket over his work clothes to protect him against the chilly weather. Just as he’s opening the door, Bobby stops him.
“Wait, where’s this coming from?” Dean sees Sam’s shoulders tense minutely as he shoots him an incredulous look.
”I’ve never stopped being your brother,” Dean raises his voice, instantly defending himself.
“You’re gonna need some help with this, you know.”
God, the smell. He wants to puke, it reeks of slaughterhouse. He covers his nose, breathing into his sleeve. Sam coughs behind him. There’s a lying figure in the middle of the room, curled up in a fetal position, unmoving.
Luckily for them, they find a roadside motel fairly quickly, after getting the greasiest takeout hamburgers Castiel has seen in his time with the Winchesters. Dean has been really quiet and withdrawn after they got out of that house, and it can’t be all written off as exhaustion. They all need some space after this hunt, he knows it. Seeing one of his brothers like that, so far gone, it was hard on Castiel as well. But right now, Castiel just wants to sleep like the dead, and it’s getting harder to stay awake, so it’s a relief when Dean pulls into the parking lot. Sam tidies up and readies himself to leave the car, when Dean casually speaks over his shoulder.
“Listen, uh, what’s your name?”
"Really? A thank you? That's a one way to ruin the moment." Although his voice had carried a sarcastic undertone, he had seemed somewhat relieved. Dean's confidence had always carried him far, but when it came to Castiel, nothing seemed to be that clear-cut any longer.
“That’s what brothers are for.”
“Thanks Cas”, he chokes out, holding on for a long moment, before reluctantly pulling out of the embrace, before he will break down like a teenage girl. He avoids Cas’ eyes, lungs constricted tight like he can’t draw a full breath, and Cas squeezes his arm reassuringly.
“Have you always been this annoying?” Dean interrupts him somewhat moodily, but not angry yet, and not one bit surprised. Sam ignores him, plows on.
“Hey, like I said before, it’s okay, man. I didn’t plan on celebrating anyway.” Cas leans closer and places a tiny kiss on his exposed shoulder, where the sleeve of the t-shirt has rucked up, as a response.
"Going on a beer run?" Sam would ask them, as innocently as he could, when Dean and Castiel would hurry past him in the study.
But at the same time, Cas is freely being who he is, and he’s not terrified, he’s not ashamed, and it makes Dean wonder, because he was never given the liberty to express himself. Something about Cas makes something stir deep inside of him; a flicker of hope. Would it be possible to live being himself, freely? And in those wakeful, restless hours he allows himself this one treacherous thought. What if Cas was feeling the same way he was?
okay?” He asks in a quiet voice. Dean leans into his hands and closes his eyes, tension bleeding out of him almost visibly.
Dean searches his memories, suddenly remembering how the large man had placed his hand on his chest before he exploded. No wonder he had been easy to find in the hospital. And now they know his current location, so they’re basically just sitting ducks here.
Castiel used his own saliva to coat his erection, then unceremoniously pushed two slick fingers into Dean, earning him a sharp gasp, and began hurriedly work him open, carefully avoiding the spot that made Dean melt under his touch. He had become quite good at this. Dean stayed down, ceasing his struggling but eyes still sharp, pleasure flashing in the little green flecks of his irises.
A door had been opened, and they were supposed to figure out what was beyond it. Dean had slowly started to rely on his presence more, ensuring his whereabouts and wellbeing more often, almost like he did always for Sam, asking him with to their cases, to just hang around in the bunker. Just as quickly Dean had reverted to his old habits, sharp comments rolling off his tongue about angels and their douchbagness, enclosing in himself, ready to be disappointed if Castiel disappeared on him again.
"Dean. You can still stop this." Castiel held up his hands, futile gesture to calm the raging whirlwind of a man before him. Dean cocked his head slightly, as if the language was foreign and he had to strain himself to understand the meaning of the words.
And that’s how he finds himself knocking on Cas’ door an hour later. His car is parked outside, so if he isn’t on one of his hour-long runs, he should be home. Dean’s not sure which outcome he would prefer, because he isn’t used to apologizing face-to-face. Fucking up usually has meant goodbyes as well. But Sam practically shoved him outside, so he didn’t really have a choice. His heart is hammering in his chest, palms sweaty, when he knocks on the door. He’s gonna wait for fifteen seconds, and then go, because he probably isn’t-
it hurts.
"That's bullshit, I want a fucking fight, so fucking fight me back!" Castiel saw the flash of Dean's eyes before he charged for him again, giving him ample warning. He tried reaching for that endless calm inside him one last time, but found only turmoil and wrath. Fine. The world of men was of violence, so to that he would turn to. Castiel grabbed Dean's incoming fist with one graceful movement, twisting it back, and hit him hard with all of his power, sending him spiraling through the room. He felt his whole figure grow taller, eyes glowing blue, as he walked closer to Dean, who was swiftly on his feet again, coiling himself for the next attack.
“Hey”, Dean grunts back, voice rough with sleep. He pours himself a cup of coffee and sits opposite of Sam, who has folded the magazine and is staring at Dean expectantly. Dean sighs in defeat. He doesn’t have the energy for this.
“The thing is...I feel like I’m responsible for his death. Maybe I could’ve stopped it, if I had just gotten there earlier. Do you know that feeling, when you can’t let go of the what-ifs and you lie awake just thinking that you failed?” Sam listens to him, brows furrowed. “He could’ve avoided this if it wasn’t for me, we’ve could’ve-”
“I will not let you!” Castiel growls, facing the vessel, readying himself for an attack. That’s the cue for the Winchesters, and things start happening simultaneously. He hears Dean barking an insult to the other two newborns, almost feels it in his own skin when Dean slices up his palm and starts drawing the angel banishing sigil somewhere behind him. The newborn take the bait and rush forward, leaving Castiel with the old man.
?” Sam doesn’t let up and it’s making Dean squirm uncomfortably.
“Ohhhhh fuck Cas”, he moans, relishing in the way Cas’ tongue and mouth moves on his cock, alternating between swallowing him in his mouth and sealing his lips around him, or using that wicked tongue to lick the underside and the head of his cock, flattening it against his slit. He’s leaking freely now, but Cas is not deterred, letting Dean push his hips forward to chase his pleasure. Dean can feel his orgasm getting closer, and he’s really tempted to just come with Cas’ mouth on his cock, but he finds he’s somehow missing the other man’s weight on him. He tugs lightly on Cas’ hair, signaling him to stop, and Cas rises, cheeks flushed and lips swollen, looking slightly disgruntled from getting interrupted at his work.
It becomes a thing between them to text casually back and forth daily. They text about casual stuff, complain about work, sometimes just to wish each other a good morning. It always bring a silly grin to Dean’s face to hear his phone beep, because most of the time he knows it’s Cas.
”You’re in a hospital. You had a stab wound, a broken ankle and some very interesting bruises, so you’ll probably be staying horizontal for a few days,” Sam starts explaining wearily, sensing Dean’s confusion. “They managed to close the wound and put a cast on your leg, but you got out of the surgery few hours ago, so that’s why you still feel like you’ve been drugged.” It takes time for Dean to process Sam’s words, but he starts remembering little bits and pieces there. He was searching for something. A big guy. Falling down the stairs, how the guy exploded. A world of hurt.
Just one more chapter to go!
“Not a chance, hotshot. Me and Sammy will live.”
“Shut up, you know how the pain meds make me,” Dean cuts him off, suddenly embarrassed of his outburst. This would be the point where he usually would storm out, but Sam wears that look that tells Dean he’s just getting started. Dean turns his head away in protest. He doesn’t deserve any words of forgiveness, but at the same time, there’s a part of him that yearns for Sam to absolve him.
“Looks like we got them all.” There isn’t any emotion in Sam’s statement, he just looks weary and done. Castiel can understand that, he’s barely got enough strength to hold himself up and keep the connection to Raguel at the same time. Dean looks like he isn’t faring any better, the shallow, measured breaths revealing that he took quite more hits than he’s letting on. Still, he flashes him a thin smile, leaning closer that their foreheads almost touch, and Castiel leans in, closes the distance.
, he says, at least he tries to, but he can’t resist the pull to go under anymore.
“Dean, I’m so sorry. For leaving you.”
The sound of heavy footsteps descending the stairs bring Dean back in the
That one had hurt. He had punched Sam and that was the end of that.
“Cas. We can’t save him,” Dean says softly. Cas avoids his eyes, but Dean knows what he’s going through; the internal struggle within him, and the shame that has weighted the angel’s step ever since the Fall. He wishes he could take it upon himself to carry that burden.
Dean feels so spent when he starts coming down from his high. He feels his sticky fingers and
“I waited. This one can hold me, you see,” the woman speaks, completely ignoring Dean. Her voice is like dry twigs, and she steps forward, staggering slightly. Her footsteps aren’t making any sound. Dean can’t hear her breathing. And in her hand, something glints in the darkness, and yep, that’s his cue to run.
“Cas. Please stay,” Dean pleads, and there’s that look of confusion again, like Dean’s speaking in a foreign language. It doesn’t suit Cas at all, seeing the exterior of solemnity and confidence chipped away like blemishes on fine marble, and Dean reminds himself that he did that. Something uncomfortable squeezes his chest. He has to fix this. He’s got Cas here; he can fix this.
“Depends. Are you gonna behave?” Shit, angry Cas is sassy as hell. Dean has no idea how to navigate around this dramatic version of Cas, as his usual demeanor is so well-composed.
“Look alive.” Sam tosses him a beer and Dean catches it automatically. He licks the grease off his fingers with no self-reservation and sets aside the remains of a cold pizza on the bed.
“Sammy. I bet you’ve followed the local news, anything on the hospital?” Dean’s tone is neutral, but he’s got the look of a man who’s dreading to hear the answer. Sam looks identical in his measured carefulness when he answers, like he was afraid to hear the question.
“What did you get, Sammy-boy?” Dean plasters on the most obnoxious grin he has in his repertoire, earning himself a patented bitch-face, a sure sign his jab has found its mark.
“Just wait until you get to know him. He’s a real busybody about everyone’s business”, Dean scoffs, half-annoyed and half-amused. Cas laughs softly. It’s always making him giddy for some reason to hear his laugh; Cas is usually very reserved and his eyes crinkle up when he smiles.
“I know”, Cas murmurs in a tone that Dean can’t read. It’s softer than he’s used to. “We’re okay, so let’s just get to sleep.” He turns around, rolls the covers tighter around himself. “Good night, Dean.”
before he’s yanked forward by his collar by impossibly strong grip, spun around, feet sliding and kicking, clawing and
faintly feels the sting when the iv-line gets ripped out when he barrels forward, or tries to, the cast on his left leg making his running clumsy and slow. The door is only few steps away, and Dean rams into it, swinging it open and he almost loses his balance again. He needs to block the door. There are some chairs meant for visitors right next to him and he grabs one, throws himself against the door, jamming the handle with the chair, desperation making his hands shake and fumble. There’s no resistance from the other side of the door, and Dean’s not sure if the fucker isn’t just waiting for him to tire himself out.
“Uh no, I really get it Cas. I’ll try to be more sensitive about it, I really didn’t know.” Dean’s pretty sure spending time with Cas has made him decent at apologies. He’s used to handling fights by yelling and storming out, but this, actually talking things through, this is new. “And for the record, I really am interested, you know, about your life.” Cas looks at him, faint smile on his lips.
“Not sure what the etiquette is for binge watching westerns, but I brought wine?”
“Less than five minutes.” Sam sounds strained. “How’s the wound? Stitches holding up well?” Dean  lifts his uncoordinated hands and manages to raise the edge of the hoodie carefully to inspect the wound. There’s a small patch of blood soaked through the bandages, but it doesn’t look like it’s continually seeping.
“You don’t handle any problems, you deny they ever existed and bury them deep without ever talking about it!” Sam almost shouts back, frustrated.
Dean asked once, when he was in a bad way, thoughts dark and invasive. Cas held him, body tightly pressed against his back, a warm cocoon around him. “
It’s a Friday afternoon in February, and Dean’s at work as usual, in the middle of changing the tires, when Bobby calls out to him.
“Dean, I’m pretty sure I can keep my hands off you if you sleep next to me”, Cas snaps at him, palpably frustrated.
Dean manages to free his other hand from under covers, brushes his fingertips over Castiel’s knuckles lightly, and leaves his hand there. He needs to touch him, needs to feel the warm skin beneath his fingers. Cas follows the movement, still as a statue, then he looks up in puzzlement. Dean can’t hold his gaze for long, instead following the path his thumb trails on Cas' hand. Cas lets him, sensing that he’s working his way to saying something difficult.
“Thank you. I know there are a lot of things you choose not to talk about, but I want you to know that I’m here for you. You can trust me and you can talk to me.” Cas speaks quietly next to his ear, and suddenly Dean needs to blink the unwanted tears away.  “And for what’s it worth, I really am sorry about your dad.”
“Jesus, Dean, I know he drank himself to death. And I hardly talked to him during this couple of years. Do you know how that feels? I’m just honestly asking you, how he was, and did he ever…” Sam’s voice shatters, before he can reach the end of the sentence, and he can’t look at Dean anymore, covering his mouth with his hand.
turned on, and all the other voices in his head have gone quiet, allowing him for once the courage to just go for it. He slides his hand from his chest to Cas’ stomach, feeling the muscles jump underneath his touch. Cas is right there, so close, solid, muscular and warm enough to bask in the heat, and he doesn’t stop Dean, letting Dean touch him in a stunned silence. “I got you”, he murmurs, moving his hand lower to trail over the sharp hip bones, and finally feel Cas’ erection through his boxers. Dean cups his cock, squeezing it slightly and it pulses in his hand expectantly. The weight and the warmth of it feels foreign, but he’s more than willing to make this work to the best of his ability. Oh god, he’s gone to hell and this is his punishment, and fuck he wants more.
It’s Monday evening and two days after Cas stormed out of the apartment. Sitting - or more like bonelessly slouching - on the couch, he stares at the TV, not even registering what he’s watching as a background noise, not an ounce of energy left in him. His head hurts like fuck. On the third call, he finally answers Sam, because he knows his brother won’t relent until he picks up the phone. There’s nothing unusual about them calling back and forth, they talk on the phone all the time, but three consecutive calls means Sam has sniffed something is up and he’s fucking stubborn about making Dean ‘fess up.
No, he has to do better than that.
Dean still gets conscious of himself, when they’re in public spaces, subtly glancing around to see if anyone’s looking at them before he kisses Cas, and Cas
“Jesus, Cas”, he whines, but the angel doesn’t relent.
Dean rose up, running his fingers through Castiel’s dark, messy hair, yanking him forward for a kiss, their lips all red and swollen from the rough contact, bodies molding against each other. They were fighting for the upper hand in this, with small claims of victory and Dean was trying to regain control. Dean licked his tongue against his, invading his mouth, and Castiel had had enough. He broke apart from Dean’s lips, breathless, shoving the man down with force. Dean let out a gasp that had nothing to do with pain.
But what if he never gets the chance now?
“It’s just me, Dean”, a tired voice calls out from the door, a familiar gravel, accompanied by a small sigh. Dean relaxes his grip on the weapon, rolling onto his back and yawning widely, trying to chase that feeling of pleasant sleepiness again, now that he’s established there’s no immediate danger. He doesn’t open his eyes, listening as the angel shuffles closer to the bed, putters about in the darkness. He hears the shuffling noises as Cas undresses his coat and jacket, and a moment of silence where Dean imagines he must be trying to unbutton his shirt.
He stands up quietly, with Sam steadying him, chest heavy, like there’s a large rock lodged inside his ribcage, and it’s almost as if he’s suffocating. It’s a good thing that they’ve done, it’s gotta be. They’re safe, everyone is safe, but still Dean feels like shit.
Then it slowly started to hit Dean when he persistently fought against losing his consciousness. He stubbornly kept his eyes open, ready to give the angel his most efficient death glare, eyes swollen shut or not, when he came back. But Castiel didn't, no matter how he waited. He was not coming back. The exhaustion and irritation mixed with worry started to give space to a darker feeling. Betrayal. Castiel had left him here. The thought hit him worse than the fist of a brainwashed angel. Castiel had left him here, broken by his hands, and had deemed it more important to save a goddamn rock than Dean. They had always shared a tight bond, but now Dean could feel tiny strings severing from it, making the connection thinner, frayed. The blood seeping from tiny wounds in his mouth tasted even more sour at this revelation. And he suddenly wanted to welcome that darkness. He stopped resisting the inevitable surrender, closing his eyes at last. Dean started sinking further down, past the red screaming hurt, both physical and emotional, knowing there was a bitter oblivion in the bottom of that abyss.
“Fine,” he answers in the same tone and digs up his computer, starting to explain to Cas about the evidence of the murders he’s found. But his shoulders are more tense than before, and he steals worried looks in his brother’s direction. They go through their plans for tomorrow; interview the widow, visit the murder scene and the morgue, the usual. This murder is the most recent one, so maybe they can find some traces of the killer and trace some pattern between the murders. Dean listens to them quietly, not offering any kind of insight on the case, or even any snarky remarks. Finally, Sam shuts his laptop and yawns loudly.
“Please, humor me”, Cas says softly. He places his hand on Dean’s thigh, and suddenly the warm touch of his palm is all he can think about. He squeezes his eyes shut.
The words still ring in Dean’s ears every time he looks at his younger brother. Dean beating the shit out of Cas. That was the last time they’ve actually spoke. The Mark… No,
Castiel was reminded of a bloodthirsty beast when Dean lunged at him again, almost growling, animalistic rage clouding his eyes, and now Castiel was ready for this kind of bullfight. They collided roughly, punching, kicking, grasping for whatever they could sink their nails into, fighting for footing, not giving in an inch. The primal need to hurt was far beneath them, but Castiel only wanted to see the other man give up and come back to his senses. And Dean just wanted to break him down. Castiel took a ruthless hit in the ribs without a complaint and aimed for Dean's nose, feeling the delicate bone give in a little under his knuckles. The hunter took a step back, dazed, blood dribbling down his lips and chin. Castiel used the brief window of opportunity to grab Dean and rammed him against a bookshelf, not caring about the valuable books that clattered down from the mistreated furniture, feeling grim joy at the sound of breathless grunt Dean made.
"I would like to do that again some time." Castiel had continued with his usual seriousness, placing his hand on Dean's, squeezing the sweaty palm. Dean had blushed slightly, opening his mouth to speak, but no words had come out. He had wrested his hand from Castiel's grasp with an awkward chuckle, and it was like he could only pull himself together when he wasn't too close to Castiel, drunk on his presence. He had cleared his throat, giving him a lopsided grin, still kind of shakier than Castiel had ever seen him, eyes bright.
Dean settles into the bed, almost succeeding into fooling himself there’s nothing weird about any of this, even though he realises this is so far out of the straight territory. He hears the bathroom door opening, and Cas shuffles in the dark into the bedroom, awkwardly bumping into the furniture, not accustomed to moving in the strange apartment. He slides under covers, leaving a respectable distance between them, settling on his side, back facing towards Dean.
“Not really. Sam and Eileen postponed their lovefest vacation a little, because they were sure I couldn’t handle being on my own for a couple of nights.” A bitter note creeps into his tone before he can take it back.
“Uh, sure. Guess you have some catching up to do.” With that, he leaves the car, leaving Castiel and Dean alone.
Sam had pleaded over the phone, but Dean told him not worry about it.
“How? In what universe has it been ever for the best that you disappear? I know it’s not easy between us right now, I said some shit, I did some…things, but that doesn’t mean you get to quit on me like that.” Castiel recognizes the veiled despair underneath Dean’s harsh demeanor and his heart feels like a heavy stone.
“Which is it?” Dean snaps moodily, irritated with Cas’ fumbling directions.
Reaching the other end of the corridor, he spots the exit sign and turns left again, only managing to take couple of steps before he stumbles, nausea hitting him out of nowhere with dizzying force.
“I really am sorry, Cas. I promise I’ll try.” Dean breathes out, trying to convey everything he can’t say with his earnest expression. Cas searches his face, eyes softening up in a small smile, equally relieved and nervous. He circles around the table, stops in front of Dean, assessing him. He bites his lower lip and then steps even closer, pulling Dean into a tight hug. Dean stiffens up for a second, but after the initial surprise, he lets himself melt into the embrace. He grabs Cas’ shirt with both of his hands, pressing his nose against the nape of his neck, and he feels Cas’s deep exhale of relief against his own rib cage.
“Come on. You need to get up for a second,” Dean whispers and pulls Castiel up, flush against his body. Dean doesn’t take his eyes off him when he slides off the shirt and starts working on the belt of his trousers. Their noses almost touch, and it’s the world’s easiest thing to lean in and press a tentative kiss on his lips. His lips are warm and willing, and he just wants to kiss Dean’s sadness away. Dean chases after him when he pulls back, softly kissing him again, and Castiel almost melts against him. Dean eases his trousers off him, and then he gestures with his hands on Castiel’s chest for him to sit down again, now only clad in his boxers. There’s so much going on between them, the mere intimacy of the moment making Castiel breathless, and Dean eyes him appreciatively, his hands still hot on Castiel’s body. Dean leans in and plants his lips on his forehead in a quick kiss, before retreating into the bathroom, and Castiel’s able to breathe again.
The conversation flows easier while they’re watching movies. Dean has picked out his all-time favorite, Tombstone, and the other one had to be a Clint Eastwood movie, so he made a difficult choice and picked Unforgiven. Castiel seems to be enjoying himself, although he constantly interrupts Dean’s favorite scenes by questioning the rationality of the plot and the characters. They’re splayed on the opposite ends of the couch, the leftovers of the pizza discarded on the floor. They’re almost done with the wine bottle when the second film ends, and maybe it’s the company, maybe it’s the wine, Dean’s feeling happier than in a long while. It doesn’t feel like he’s invited a stranger into his house, more like old friends bantering about everything and anything. Castiel is funny, in a dry, sarcastic fashion, and he seems like a man who has been around the block and still has remained humble and compassionate. He has endless amount of stories and he isn’t afraid to make fun of himself. Dean likes that.
“Sam...I, uh, I think I’m in love with him.” And there it fucking is. The big, ugly truth right there in the open and now there’s no going back. Dean expects his heart to start beating faster and the panic swell inside of his chest, but the first time in weeks, his flight-or-fight-response isn’t kicking up. He’s in total control of his mind, and it almost feels liberating to finally say it out loud.
“I, uh, whatever works”, he manages to say, too far gone already, not sure when was the last time he was this worked up over sex, even though they mostly have their clothes on. Cas grips his hip, halting his desperate writhing with an expression Dean’s never seen him wear; arousal mixed with absolute confidence, a look that tells him he’s ready to make Dean suffer a little. Cas leans in, planting a kiss underneath his jaw, moving lower to his collarbone, leaving a tiny mark there with his teeth. He slowly moves downward, giving some attention to his nipples, tracing a path to his stomach with his lips, which makes Dean inhale sharply. Each of his hip bones get some open-mouthed kisses, and Cas glances up, making sure that Dean’s still on board. Fuck yes he’s on board, sailor hat on and everything. Cas grins, but it’s more predatory than one of his usual happy grins that light his whole face up.
“Okay, awesome, you can tell me all about it while we’re watching movies. I got pizza, you bring the wine.”
Dean blinks slowly, trying to remember if he ever saw a weapon in the brute’s hand, replaying fragments of the fight in his mind. He can’t make sense of it anymore, the details slip from his mind and warp to greyish, stuttered images, until his mind is just replaying how wrong the blue in the man’s eyes looked.
"If I'm nothing, it's because of you, Dean. I have given up
he’s just as hard as Dean is and it’s all too much. Neither of them have the restraint anymore to keep the appreciative groans from spilling their lips when they start moving slowly, and Cas leans their foreheads together, panting. Dean wraps his other leg around Cas, keeping him in place, thrusting his hips upward to meet Cas. Holding his upper body up with his forearms, Cas takes Dean’s hand into his and guides it between them, urging him to touch their cocks, and Dean fits them both in his hand, looking for the right angle because let’s face it, neither of them aren’t the smallest guys. He gets a steady rhythm going quickly, spurring Cas to move his hips more forcefully against Dean’s, and the heat and the friction between gets Dean closer to the edge faster than he could’ve imagined. He takes shuddering breaths against Cas’ lips, rubbing their cocks together swiftly, hand sticky with precum he’s not even sure whose it is, and seems like Cas isn’t faring any better.
“Alright, shut up, I really wasn’t.” Cas just clears his throat, walking to the bed and placing his bag on the left side of the bed. Dean takes the hint and follows him, and throws his on the right side, opening the bag and rummaging around for a comfortable t-shirt.
So when the opportunity arises to spend a weekend with Cas in Denver, he immediately jumps to it. Bobby has asked Dean to be his eyes and ears at a big car show, so the first thing he does, is a text to Cas.
“Nothing alarming on news,” Sam clears his throat to break the silence, face scrunched up in concentration. Both look up in mild interest. Sam glances at Dean, offering a sympathetic smile when he observes his bruises. Dean almost can return the simple gesture. The smile tugging his lips feels all wrong and undeserved.
and suddenly the room is engulfed in dim, yellowish light provided by the bedside lamp. Dean blinks owlishly, eyes watering and stinging, and when his vision clears, he makes the outline of the angel, shirtless, body twisted towards him invitingly. Dean shifts to get closer to him, freeing his hand from under the covers to touch Cas’ back, fingers tracing the knobs of his spine and the adjacent erector spinae muscle. He doesn’t know why he still expects there to be some sort of weird energy, buzz of electricity or a strange hum when he touches where he imagines Cas has folded his wings, but there’s just the solid feeling of warm skin and strong muscles beneath his fingers. The dull light paints vivid shadows on Cas’ face, and his hair is a windswept mess. He’s more human than angel nowadays, but there’s still something very ancient about him. He’s like a sculpture, weathered by time, but still beautiful. Eternal.
“No. I’m- I’m good. Just, ah, give me…a minute.” He sounds like he’s out of breath, voice uneven and shaky. He needs to pull himself together. Sam needs him. The brother in question shoots him a look that’s equal parts of annoyance and worry. Dean takes few steadying breaths, trying to clear his head, following his brother’s movements when he rips a strip from his shirt, tears it in two and gives the second rag to Dean.
, Dean wanted say,
“So, Sam finally hunted down those lawyer-contacts that might be willing to help us with the shelter cases”, Cas starts conversationally, piling bacon slices to his empty plate. Dean steals few pieces off the plate, just in case if the other man tries to hog all of them. Cas scoffs but doesn’t try to stop him.
“What? Never mind that, I need to fix you now.” Sam grabs the hem of the garb in an attempt to lift it higher, but Dean grips his wrist in alert.
“To be frank Dean, I also don’t have your appreciation for beer. This is not the type of establishment I usually go to in my free time.” Cas tracks Dean’s movement, when he takes a long swig from his pint, and Dean raises his eyebrows at him, mock-pity written on his expression.
“Yeah, I think I just figured out how gay I’m for you”, Dean mumbles, trying to ignore his throbbing erection for a second. He figures he’s finally past the point where it’s redundant to resort to the denial-phase again, with his best friend,
Yeah. Things might not be perfect, he might be a broken mess, a hopeless alcoholic, and Cas a grieving father, but when they’re together like this, it doesn’t all seem too bad. When he’s concentrating on the scruff of his beard against his neck, how they’re breathing in sync, the way Cas seems to cling to him like he’s something valuable, it almost makes him feel like he’s on the mend.
"Just...
When Dean steps out of the bathroom, Cas is waiting, wringing his hands nervously, clothes clean like nothing ever happened.
Sam had made him promise. And Castiel, he’ll always come when he’s needed.
“I am”, Cas confesses, gracefully ignoring Dean’s blatant bullshit. He trails his hand to Dean’s stomach, and he tries his best not to show how much it tickles.
“But...you killed it already. What the hell was that thing?” Susan looks at the body suspiciously, still clearly riled up. Dean closes his eyes for a second to figure out how much he wants to tell the nurse. Right now, they just need to get out quickly.
“Then it’s better I take my leave,” Cas says tensely. Sam looks equally displeased. Dean offers only a curt nod in response and starts searching for the car keys in his pocket, heading for the driver’s side of the Impala.
better that I go!” Castiel argues. Dean closes the book with a decisive
“What do you mean?” Sam counters his question with a frown on his features.
”Sammy, I’m so sorry.” The apology tumbles out of Dean’s mouth before he can stop it. Sam looks at him, baffled.
“Anytime, you know that.” Sam gives him a small, sincere smile over his shoulder. The knowledge that Sam has his back no matter what, steadies Dean, but there’s something that nags him, something that still feels unfinished. And now that he’s opened the unspoken can of worms in the hospital, it’s really hard to shove that thought back down that says everything’s not the way it should be. Maybe it’s the painkillers and the head injury that make him more loose-lipped than usual, but he finds that he has no control over his mouth.
“I think you need some time to think about this”, he says in a tight voice. There’s a lump stuck in Dean’s throat, making it harder to breathe.
"I'll just be here." Dean didn't bother answering, but he felt the tight, cold knot inside him ease up a little, even though he was reluctant to admit it had anything to do with the angel. But it was enough that he slipped into dreamless, black sleep easier than before.
"Hey. What happened?" Dean blinked blearily the shadows away, trying to gather his strength to convince there was nothing to worry about. Sam still held onto him, and Dean feared that without his constant presence he would've crumbled.
“Okay hold on, what the fuck, hands- hands off my junk,” he slurs and he tries to guide his brother’s hand away, but Sam shakes loose with ease.
“Thanks…” He mutters, closes his eyes.
“So, shower and bed?” Cas asks, going about his unpacking in a more sophisticated manner, placing folded articles of clothing on the bed. Dean glances at him, but Cas keeps his eyes trained on his belongings.
They get ready fast and pick up much needed coffee for Dean to wake him fully up. The plan is to drive Cas into town, where he’s meeting a friend and then later meet up, once Dean is ready with the car show. They chat easily on the way, and Cas hasn’t brought up last night at all, so Dean lets it rest. Scratch that, he would be too chicken-shit to even bring out the subject. There’s no way to sneak that into the conversation without it seeming something it wasn’t. “
"Now you're just being sappy." The hunter had accepted the contact despite his grumbling, pressing his nose against Castiel's neck.
"But I don't sleep." Castiel had answered, making the other man look at him pointedly.
into the speakers
some NSFW and gore in this chapter.
“You think?”
A rock song blasting from the speakers, the stuffy smell of unwashed bodies, cigarette smoke and alcohol is enough to make Dean feel right at home, when he enters the crowded bar with his brother. Sam follows him somewhat uneasily. Fancy college boy. He nods to the familiar bartender, Pamela, who gives him a lazy salute between fixing some drinks, and starts looking around for Cas. Soon Dean finds him, huddled at a corner table, looking rather out of place here in his trench coat and playing with his drink nervously. Trust Cas to be formal about a night out, appearing early and well dressed. Dean can’t wait to make fun of him. Wide eyed, Cas notices the brothers approaching him, his bewildered expression melting into obvious relief. Dean can’t keep the wide grin off his face when they make their way to him through the crowd, and Cas answers in kind, albeit more hesitantly. He eyes Sam behind him questioningly.
“Not good. But, uh, I can’t stop you from leaving, so we need to get him into the wheelchair.” Susan ignores Dean completely, choosing to answer Sam, sounding already a bit more composed. Dean lifts his head, thanks her with a small, shaky smile. The nurse barely notices him, guiding the wheelchair closer. Dean tries to think about anything but the inevitable manhandling he’s about to get. He wishes Cas was here.
“No, I haven’t, but- maybe I will, you know?” Dean aims for a roguish grin, but it comes off feeble and nervous. Cas nods, carefully keeping emotions off his face, but he’s watching Dean closely. Dean tries to take a steadying sip of his beer, mind racing with desperate possibilities how to get out of this one, but finds his bottle empty. “And you?” He asks, somehow sounding out of breath. He tells himself it’s only to keep the conversation going, not because it’s been bothering him for a long time.
“I must commend you on your perseverance. You simply refuse to yield. Even though you’re running away.” The angel’s voice sounds almost like it’s coming from underwater, far away. But at least Dean’s pathetic escape attempt keeps her focus on him. Dean doesn’t look back, he keeps crawling forward, slow but steady. The world is narrowed down to the dim light coming from somewhere further ahead, rapid breathing and the burn of his muscles. Just few more feet, then he can rest, Dean tells himself. Then abruptly there’s a screeching, high-pitched sound that echoes from the walls, and his eardrums almost shatter from the pained scream coming from behind him.
“Well- you know. You’re my friend and all that. I’m curious.” Dean fiddles with his fork, suddenly awkward. Cas is wearing a smile like he’s on some inside joke he’s not ready to share with Dean.
They gather their belongings from the car in silence, and Sam comes back with the keys, dangling them from a leathery keychain.
“Sorry,” his brother whispers hastily, but Dean ignores that.
“You won’t.”
“Okay then. Guess I’m getting our weapons,” he says too evenly, his tone betraying his irritation, and takes off. Fuck. Dean shuts his eyes, gathers his patience. He can’t say anything right, it seems.
“You know her. She can’t be tamed. She and Kaia had found some-” he stops for a moment and Dean hears soft thuds as Cas gets rid of his shoes, “-some vampire cult that had been responsible for kidnapping people for decades, so of course they dragged me into that hunt and I had to spend three days chasing vampires wearing idiotic masks, because apparently that was their “thing”-” Dean doesn’t see the air quotes but he can still hear them, and his lips quirk up into a small smile.
“Dean, I don’t-“
“Well maybe, but it’s only gonna hurt you further to get stuck on that. You know… Bobby told me that you blamed yourself for mom’s death as well, when you were four. He said you got the exact same look back then, like you were riddled with guilt. He’s worried as well. You have a habit of taking the whole world as your responsibility, and when something bad happens, you beat yourself up for it. You can’t let other people’s lives drag you down, because the thing is, bad shit always keeps happening, and you aren’t responsible for everything.”
“My condolences,” the he says quietly, retreating back, and Dean can feel the man studying him carefully. Yeah. Condolences and well-wishes have done jackshit for him. He’s heard them countless times.
and look at what you’re
“So yeah, if the offer is on table, I’d like to take you out on a real date. Maybe ask if you want to be my boyfriend if it goes really well. But right now, if you want it, I’d like to take off your clothes and have my way with you.” Cas’ tone darkens towards the end, and the loose grip he has of Dean’s hips, tightens slightly.
Cas finally clears his throat. “So, how are you?” His voice scratchy from tension. Dean stares him blankly, until Cas meets his eyes tentatively, shoulders rigid. The second their eyes are locked, the flickering lights and the quiet rattle of the air conditioning fades away in the distance. Dean licks his lips, trying to figure out what the hell he’s supposed to say to that.
“Go.” Luckily Sam listens to him. He squeezes Dean’s shoulder in silent reassurance, gets up and takes off in long strides. Almost immediately, the nurse takes his place, starting to assess the damage, still looking shaky and avoiding Dean’s eyes. There are deep lines edged on her face, and her blonde hair is in disarray. She digs something from the pocket of her uniform, conjures out a clean cloth. She touches Dean’s hand lightly, silently telling him to move it. Dean complies, still holding the bloody rag in his palm.
“Huh. Looks like you finally managed to learn how to do proper stitches,” he jokes weakly. His head feels like it’s made of lead, thoughts running slower than oily water, but if there’s a chance to rib his brother, he’ll take it.
“What?” Cas asks, brow furrowed in confusion.
“Hey man, you still awake?” The tone is casual but there’s a whole world of repressed fear underneath. Dean slowly directs his gaze to his brother, sees him drawing some sigils on the windows. That alerts him immediately, and he tries to sit up straighter.
“Actually pretty good. Yeah, I think Bobby will be pleased with what I found, as much as that surly bastard can feel pleased. He always says I have a good eye for cars, that’s why he sends me to these things”, he says, shrugging slightly. Cas doesn’t have an actual clue about cars, so Dean always tries to keep the car-talk bare minimum with him. Even though Cas’ confused squint is always fun to watch, when he’s trying to understand all the technical stuff so hard.
The first time Dean meets Castiel is at a local shelter for homeless people.
"Yeah Cas, it was a dick-move. What do you want me to say?" He said after a long pause, turning his hardened gaze towards the angel. He really didn't want to have this conversation. He really didn't want to expose any of his weaknesses to the other, or talk about his feelings. The words were a heavy understatement of the betrayal he had felt inside, but if one knew Dean Winchester, one knew to look for specific signs. And Castiel knew how to search for the little nuances, the way Dean pursed his lips, hardened his jaw and how his eyes mirrored every emotion he was feeling deep inside.
Dean looks at him in dismay, because why in the hell Cas needs to ask permission for that? Both Sam and Cas stare back with solemn faces. Right. Last time Dean refused. Consent issues and all that. Sam misreads his hesitation, butting into the conversation.
“I can’t deal with this right now, Cas.” Dean manages, and the angel must take this as some sort of encouragement to start a conversation, because he can hear him stepping closer softly.
"Just stop this, okay? Nobody has to hurt anyone!" Castiel could feel his tranquility chipping away fast, piece by piece.
"He left. Castiel... He left, Sammy." The words weren't supposed to come out so brokenly, but it all was a mess and red agony and the walls around his carefully concealed vulnerabilities were crushing down. Sam still had that look,
“He’s got no class, this one”, Dean mutters to Cas, loud enough for Sam to catch his words.
“Oh really? Did that cum on your hand appear on its own then, too?” He snarks, leveling a glare at his direction. Dean has no answer for that. He feels small in a way he hasn’t felt in a long time. Cas sits up abruptly, throwing the covers off him. “Fuck, Dean! I’ve been trying to keep up with your mood swings for the past month and you’ve been acting like an asshole for half of that time, but I can’t go through this again. I- I can’t deal with this right now.” He gets off the bed, probing around for the light switch. He finds it, and the bedroom fills with unnatural bright light that hurts Dean’s eyes. He hears Cas opening the zipper of his bag aggressively and the rustling sounds when starts dressing himself.
That’s when Castiel feels it. It feels like someone would press heavily against a thick film of plastic, slowly stretching it outward. The pressure grows in his head, and Sam’s and Dean’s voices become more distant, just background noise on which he can’t focus. He fights the disorienting feeling, taking a split second to wonder how did Raguel slip past his notice so easily.
“What did you do?” He asks quietly, an alarm going off in his head. Just then there’s a knock on the door and they both flinch, and Dean reaches for the gun immediately. He fixes his eyes on Sam, silently demanding answers and the sasquatch has the nerve to look apologetic.
“Morning.” Sam says pointedly. That one word is so laden with different meanings that Dean would could write a thesis about it. It means he’s still pissed, but set on making Dean talk, meaning the usual avoidance-techniques are out of the question, but foremost he’s testing the waters to see how he will respond.
“Okay, let’s get you out of your clothes and clean you up,” he says decisively. Shuffling closer, bracketed by Castiel’s knees, Dean starts undressing Castiel, sliding the battered jacket off him and lets it pool behind his back. Castiel relaxes under his touch, pleasant shivers running down his back when Dean strips him with gentle hands. A hushed silence envelops the room, Dean’s measured breaths tickle his skin, and he can’t help but to reach over and touch Dean, fingers running through his hair slowly, aching to feel him. Dean’s eyes find his, and Castiel cradles his face, thumbs soothing the worried lines around his eyes.
“He good for you?” He nods towards Cas with an assessing look in his wary eyes.
, describes one witness. They’ve suddenly found their faith, killed people in God’s name and died afterwards, leaving only bits and pieces left of themselves.”
written in his gaze. Dean gives him a small smile, but a noise from other side of the booth distracts him.
“Here, Sam.” Sam, the sharp-eared hunter catches the words, and the footsteps come hurriedly closer, then abruptly stop like he hit a brick wall. Dean stretches his neck to catch sight of him.
“I know that, Dean. But he’s still one of my brothers.”
Dean doesn’t spot anyone on the premises when he maneuvers Baby next to a light blue Ford in front of the warehouse. It feels a more fertile ground to start searching for anything out of the ordinary, but he knows that he’s grasping at straws here. The killer was here and now they’re gone. But they still gotta figure out who they’re dealing with. Dean automatically glances at the front seat when he exits the car, takes in his surroundings. It seems the man’s death has brought the place to a full stop, and the stillness instead of where there should be noise and movement, makes Dean more aware of every creak and clang he hears in the yard. He sort of regrets leaving Sam behind now, and double checks he still has the gun in the waistband of his jeans, loaded and safety on. Dean grabs the angel blade from the trunk as an afterthought as well, stuffs it under his belt, before heading for a side door closest to him. Trying the handle reveals it’s locked. The widow gave him the keys to the main gate but forgot all the rest. So, Dean digs out a lockpick while grumbling to himself that Sam should be there to do this. The door opens very quickly though, and Dean enters the dark hall.
“You still plan on taking me to that date?” Dean asks quietly after some time, and Cas raises his head, a content smile on his lips.
“You hear me? Everyone is in-in danger here, especially me. We can’t…uh, defend ourselves.” Dean hears the slight slur in his voice, tangling the letters together. Sam looks at him sharply.
to. He grabs Cas' coat lapels and almost throttling him, pushes the angel against the drawer, knocking a cheap vase off it. Cas' eyes are widened in surprise, but he lets Dean manhandle him without trying to fight back. That just angers Dean more.
Castiel started fucking him, slowly at first, listening in to the little gasps Dean let out with every thrust to anticipate what he wanted. Dean’s fingers dug into his scalp, and he let his hips snap against his ass more forcefully, making Dean in return sink his teeth into the tendons of his neck. The bite hurt, and he slammed his cock in as deep as he could, relishing the wave of pleasure that rippled through him, angling for that sweet spot to make Dean more compliant. It clearly worked, the man's mouth became slack, unable to suppress a breathless moan and he sagged back on the table. Castiel pried loose from his grip and continued fucking him harder, barely able to think beyond the overwhelming sensations Dean gave him. Dean was getting closer too to the climax, the predatory glint in his eyes almost diminished, just desperation for release remaining. He tried grasping for his own erection, now completely without any friction, but Castiel swatted his hand almost angrily away and wrapped his own fingers around the pulsing cock. He smeared his hand with Dean’s precum, and started jerking him off with quick movements that matched the rhythm of his hips. Dean let his whole body finally relax into the contact, head dropped down, eyes closed, his own hips bucking forward to meet Castiel, hitting that sweet spot with every rapid thrust. For a moment it was pure harmony, the bodies moving together, and he knew he was unraveling fast. Dean’s cock was already slick with seeping cum, his mouth hanging open, unable to find oxygen in his ecstasy.
“Hey you”, Dean grins at him, and Cas opens his arms, pulling him into a quick hug.
“Dean, are
“Yeah, he asked about you.” Dean answers softly, instantly knowing what his brother was about to ask. “Even called me Sammy couple of times by accident. You know how he was. He liked to drown himself in alcohol and depression. He sat down on his worn-down chair and never really tried to get back to living again.” He’s not entirely sure, if he’s trying to make things better or worse for Sam. Either way, his brother looks at him, sort of taken back by the softly spoken bitterness in his tone.
"Hi", he had returned, voice still hoarse from sleep. Castiel had felt all his sorrows and worries just melt away from the smile, and he hadn't wondered any longer why humans drew strength from having someone waiting for them.
“Keep in touch, okay? Don’t do anything reckless.” Dean hears Sam give some final mother-hen advice when he opens the door, hears the whining creak of the hinges again.
They load themselves into Dean’s Impala next Friday and start their long drive to Denver. The drive goes by smoothly, easy conversation keeping them busy for the next hours. Dean plays his favorite songs, and Cas pretends to like them. Cas has located some antique stores and ethnic restaurants he wants to visit, and he sounds so excited about them that Dean allows him rattle on about them. At some point he nods off, snoring silently, cheek pressed against the window. Dean lets him sleep, stretching his back and legs on the wheel, feeling the effects of a long drive more than he used to ten years ago. They stop briefly for a dinner and a bathroom break, otherwise letting Baby devour the highway.
“It is now. I’ve had enough of you for now. So, scoot, agent McGilligan. I’ll call you if something comes up.” The car is raising some interested looks from the officers heading inside, but Sam looks like he’s ready to go for another round. A nervous muscle ticks in his jaw as he’s trying to swallow down his emotions.
“I’m gonna dress the wound, okay?” Dean nods, hears a fabric ripping and then the prodding is back, and he tries to endure it, teeth clenched. Sam talks just as much for Dean’s benefit as for his own and maybe, just maybe, it manages to distract him a little from the abuse he’s suffering right now.
“I got clothes, shoes, bed sheets, uh, towels… some other stuff too, can’t remember what, though. I got few more boxes in my car too, if you need this sort of shit- I mean items.” His slip-up makes the dark-haired man laugh, making his eyes crinkle up. Dean decides he likes the guy.
Dean kept backing him towards the nearest surface that could support them both, demanding hands roaming over his chest, stomach and then occupying themselves with his belt. All the while he kept  leaving sloppy kisses at Castiel’s jaw and neck, while the flushed angel struggled with his t-shirt. Their erections grinded against each other, and Castiel had to remind himself to keep some ounce of control, biting his lip against the friction. He needed to go off Dean's script, even if he wanted to believe this could be just one of their heated sexual encounters. It wasn’t though, but Castiel was burning up just as much as Dean was. His buckle came off with a clink, and Castiel used that moment to swing Dean around and throw him against the table the hunter had aimed for. He held him there, pushing him down when Dean tried to get up and slap his hand away, growling like a cornered animal.
“So… Korean food?” He asks carefully, trying to pick something that looks least suspicious. He’ll go with meat. You can’t go wrong with that one.
“Wait- what kind of business is he running?”
“Truce?”
“This is good,” Dean muses contently, and Sam looks caught off guard, before his features settle into a hesitant smile, happier than Dean’s seen him in weeks. He wishes he could make his brother smile like that more often. He certainly hasn’t given him a reason in a while.
During the day he can find all the excuses in the world to avoid dealing with the panicked doubts about himself. He’s building up metal walls into his own mind, isolating every treacherous thought the second they’re born. He’s walled up and stuck, feeling like he’s treading forward in a sandpit, slowly sinking deeper and deeper.
How do you break out something like that? How can he mend something like that, when the ground beneath them has shattered again, and he’s the one who caused it?
“Like you’re any better,” he snaps without thinking. Sam frowns, puzzled. Shit. That was the thing they were not supposed to talk about.
“Hey, how is he?” Sam asks.
"Did I do something wrong?" He had leaned towards Sam, expecting him to have all the answers. Sam had simply shrugged wearing his emphatic expression, chewing food thoughtfully.
Dean drags himself to the kitchen, not surprised to find Sam already there, typing something on his laptop. His brother gives him a smile as greeting, glancing him over appraisingly and concentrating back on whatever nerdy stuff that gets him up in the morning, face suspiciously neutral.
Cas brings up his other hand, the other one still tethered in Dean’s tight grip, places his long fingers on his cheek, almost shyly. At once, Dean feels the familiar warm tingle spreading through his limbs, and all of his aches just dissolve; he breathes easier, without the constant headache. He sighs, melting back into the cushions. Dean had almost forgotten what it felt like to be without pain. Cas hasn’t moved his hand, and Dean glances at him, seeing his face tightly burrowed in concentration.
“It would just be, what, gay? Is that the word you’re looking for?” There’s sharpness in his tone.
"You've been doing a lot of that", Sam would shout after them, and Castiel could hear the badly hidden amusement in his voice. Dean would point his middle finger very moodily at his brother, not even glancing back. Castiel hadn't minded the teasing or the transparent excuses, not as long as Dean was okay with it, under all his snarky exterior. All of them had known what was going on from early on, even Castiel had picked up on the signals, but labeling their thing something as trivial as a beer run made it lot easier for Dean to handle than having to deal with the fact that he might have romantic feelings towards another man.
“You want to try the kimchi?” He suddenly offers, pushing his bowl towards Dean.
“What about him?” Dean asks, staying on his guard.
Yeah, his dad was old drunk who fucked up his head with booze and all it got him was a stroke and some vicious hemorrhaging. But he was still Dean’s dad.
“I don’t care. Let’s just get this over with.” The conversation dries up after that. Dean pretends to concentrate on his phone, skimming through some local news with zero interest. A local market has a wooden veal-mascot named Gary. The new library has a collection of rare books on porcelain painting. The autumn rains are hindering the transport of local crops. God, how can this town be so boring?
“It was fairly easy, once I knew what I was looking for,” he says dismissively, turning his focus back on the screen. Okay, there’s something Sam’s not telling him, but Dean doesn’t have the energy to pry into his secrets. He gets up with a groan, raps the table with his knuckles.
“No, you know what, I’m sorry too. Sometimes I tend to forget that some people have different boundaries than me, and I didn’t realise this was one those boundaries to you.” His tone is sheepish and regretful, and Dean doesn’t want to hear it, no way, Cas doesn’t get to take it out on himself.
he finally pushes two, lubed fingers inside Dean with minimal resistance, forcing a shuddering moan from his lungs, and he melts against the cushions, spreading his legs further, eyes fluttering closed. Cas slowly pumps his fingers in and out of him, twisting and spreading them slightly, aiming for his prostate with each pass.
“I should probably-“
“So, uh, how was it? How’s your brother doing?” Dean asks quickly, and Cas lets out a frustrated sigh.
he mentally reprimands himself, feeling the pit of shame deepen inside his chest.
“Dammit Cas. I-I don’t think this is a good moment to talk about this.” Dean struggles with his words, trying to find any sense in this situation and failing. The guilt is eating him and he needs to be alone, so he can bury all that fucked up shit deep inside him and come back less broken. More like the man everyone’s expecting him to be. “I think I’m gonna go sleep.” Dean’s trying to keep his tone even, but his voice falters midway through. He rises slowly, keep his gaze directed everywhere but the angel.
The door closes with a
so you have nothing to make up for.” Dean stubbornly keeps his head turned, but he can hear the honest thickness in Sam’s voice and it makes his heart clench. He wants to believe that Sam believes in what he says, because he can’t.
“So, he’s basically making…horcruxes?” Sam looks like he’s having trouble swallowing Cas' words, and the angel furrows his brow at the strange reference. Dean accepts the theory easier, thoughts already focusing on how they can kill this fucker.
he almost passes out again when the movement jostles his bleeding side the wrong way. So, he stays still, taking even, shallow breaths, fighting the graying edges of his vision.
And there you have it. Not a native speaker here, so if you catch any mistakes or weird sentences, let me know :) thanks for reading and following my story, feedback is always appreciated!
now. But those are the words that has treacherously slipped into his mind when sits awake at night, trying to drink himself numb. They are the words he refuses to think of, when he’s reminded of Cas. And he has armored himself so well, just pushing on and on, past his breaking point and onward, but those little words threaten to topple him. And it hurts like hell and Dean feels sudden need to lash out, take the pain out on the angel who brought out the shame in him for everyone to see, with that softly spoken statement.
“Stop it, Dean. You look like a breeze could kill you.” Dean scoffs tiredly in response. Sam starts digging into the first aid kit, fishes out a needle and thread, and then scoots closer. He looks exhausted, with dark circles under his eyes and coarse stubble framing his cheeks.
The man pushes him out of the door with one-handed death grip on his throat and into the railing with rattling force, teeth bared. The metal presses painfully on Dean’s back and there’s a sharp twinge under his ribs, which he has no time to worry about, because he’s fumbling for the angel blade on his belt, fingers slipping, all the while trying to hold the huge man at bay and from choking him. He manages to get a grip and pulls the blade out, striking out blindly. The blade connects with flesh, buries somewhere in the man’s chest he hopes, who roars out in rage and pain, but is still very much alive. But the arm on his throat loosens and Dean shakes loose, drawing breath hungrily, yanking the blade free,
#prayforSam
“Can I help you?” He asks, voice deep and friendly.
“Great, so he’s a fucking snitch now.”
“I, uh…” Dean blanks, searching for some plausible explanation, “-I’ve been, you know, staying busy and- and I’m thinking of getting a girlfriend?” His voice rises at least an octave, while he’s trying to tamp down the mild panic that’s making his palms damp all of a sudden.
The bunker never quiets down, not even in the night. The giant machinery that works as the building’s heart, lungs and arteries hums, pulses and occasionally makes ticking, whirring sounds as Castiel makes his way down the corridor to the library. It has always given him solace and keeping company in the dark, when he guards Dean’s sleep, listening to the man breathe right next to him. Now the low background noises sound mocking; too loud and irritating to him.
Dean’s fucked up. He’s fucked up so badly. He’s gonna mess this up, he’s already messed it up by acting like a completely bipolar asshole, and Cas is probably gonna be fed up with the shit he’s pulled real soon. If he isn’t already. Dean can’t make the heads or tails of this situation; there’s no way he can be in love with Cas. He’s straight, for fuck’s sake. He dates girls, and he’s never even kissed a dude. He’s been single so long that his body has gotten somehow tricked by their continuous proximity, some wires must’ve been crossed wrong, it’s just a passing thing, he tells himself. He’s just confused, because Cas treats him good and seems like he cares about Dean. Dean’s thoughts keeps circling these vicious thoughts day after day. Cas probably hates him. He’s been busy dealing with his brother, so the steady trickle of daily messages has almost died down over the past few days. Dean finds himself often sitting on the couch, staring at his phone or pulling up their messages, fingers frozen over the keypad because he can’t think of a single thing to say. He can’t even speak about this to Sam, or to anyone else. What would he even say? It’s been awhile since he felt this lonely.
“I’m not gay”, Dean defends himself weakly, finally finding his voice again. It’s a knee jerk reaction, a weak attempt of plausible deniability, a way to maintain status quo in a situation that is quickly spiraling out of his control, but it does nothing but make Cas more angry.
to keep him grounded here. Footsteps come closer and Cas stops when he enters the living room. They stare at each other wordlessly for a while, unmoving. Cas looks almost as terrible as he does, with dark circles under his eyes and a stubble so long it almost counts as a beard. There’s a pained expression in Cas’ eyes, and Dean braces himself for the worst, because that’s a 100% break-up look right there.
“Fuck.” Dean whispers, with the dawning realization that Cas wasn’t the one to leave, he fucking made him do it. He raises a heavy arm, the iv-line tugging his hand, and runs it over his face, winces when his fingers brush a large bruise on his temple. He wouldn’t look at Cas. He would barely speak to him. He got angry when Cas wanted to help, even though it was the very nature of the angel. And there was such profound sorrow in Cas, but he wouldn’t speak up. Maybe the unsaid things between them were part of the problem. They’ve never been good with words and it’s always driven them further apart, harder to get back up every time. Dean needs to fix this. He doesn’t know how, but he has to.
and Dean can’t help but feel trapped. Coming here is like every bad decision he’s ever made multiplied by two. He swore he’d keep away from Cas. No second chances. And now here he stands, trying to find the safest corner of the small single room so he can escape fast if need be. Anger still burns through his veins, but the violent thrashing in his heart has settled. It was hard listening to Sam and Cas talk about the hunt like nothing had happened, trying to include him like he would merrily go along. It was hard to look at either of them, knowing that they had kept this secret from Dean, like it was their place and privilege to start fixing his fucked-up life on his behalf. Like he isn’t capable of doing his own decisions. A fight would have ensued either way, had he stayed with Sam or come with Cas, and he’s too pissed to deal with Sam yet. So here he is.
“You’re a stubborn asshole.” Sam shakes his head and leans in to clean out the slowly clotting blood on Dean’s face.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean”, he started, not quite knowing how to continue, regret and sorrow coloring the single word with deep meaning. The hunter didn’t stop, didn’t even turn his head.
“You’re a sap. Now let’s get inside before you keel over.” The tone is affectionate, but there still is an edge to it when Dean speaks. Castiel notices how tense his shoulders are, how guarded his eyes look, but lets it rest for now.
but tells he’s happy for them, and Sam’s approval eases something within him.
“I fucked up, plain and simple”, Dean shoots back, shrugging nonchalantly. That’s what his life is, and Sam should know it by now. Trust Dean to make a mess of things. Sam rolls his eyes, mouth setting on a thin line.
“Yeah? Best for whom?” He challenges Castiel. Dean is making this as hard as he thought we would. At least this time their fight doesn’t seem like it will come down to blows. Castiel isn’t sure if he would prefer Dean hitting him square in the jaw and be done with this, because every moment makes it harder for him to leave.
“So, Cas, what do you do for living?” Sam pipes in, completely ignoring Dean.
Dean enters the shabby-looking lobby, looking just as lost as he’s feeling, two fully stuffed boxes precariously balanced in his arms. There’s a dark-haired man sitting behind a worn-down desk, eyeing him curiously, pencil in his other hand and a calculator in the other.
“Not sure if I warranty that kind of care, but I’m glad to be sharing the room with you, Dean.”
“Well okay, the man does his best impression of a holy hand grenade,” Dean mutters dryly, earning him a
“Yeah, you don’t have to give me a friggin’ lecture about it in the middle of the night. I know it’s for my own good and it’s not forever, all that crap. I’ve taken care of myself all my life and got this far, didn’t I?”
“So how did you piece this together? The killings take place all over the country.” Dean is genuinely impressed, but Sam glances at him sharply with an unreadable expression.
“Fuck you, Cas.” Dean wrenches his arm free violently, pushing Cas back. Cas allows the movement, stepping backwards. Dean can’t breathe right, his heart is hammering in his chest like a caged animal. He keeps the angel at bay with a threatening glare, but finding nothing but desperation, ever-present devotion and loyalty being reflected at him. And it almost unravels him. Dean doesn’t deserve it. Cas doesn’t deserve his forgiveness. It’s all a mess inside his head, tectonic plates grinding their edges together and building up the pressure that finds no release.
“Cas?” Dean gets his mouth moving finally. Cas looks at him in obvious worry, Sam mirroring his look unknowingly. He waves them off, completely done being coddled by them, done with how they look at him like he’ll shatter on impact. He feels more like himself with every passing moment, and he can still take a hit. Dean’s muscles feel sore and there’s an uncomfortable tingle in his fingertips, but otherwise he feels surprisingly functional. He throws off the blanket and pushes himself up slowly, reveling in the fact that he can do that without passing out from pain. Once he’s seated, feet firmly planted on the floor, he remembers the cast in his leg. Dean wiggles his toes experimentally. His leg feels fine. He feels fine. Tired, but fine.
“This here is a finely made table. It’s oak, right?
"Dean, please, I can fix it-"
“Did you drive him away for that same reason?”
A high-pitched clink brings his attention back to Cas, who has let his spoon drop loudly into the bowl, and is now looking at Dean, chewing his bottom lip. There’s still some undercurrent of irritation running through him, but for the most part, Cas looks a lot more like himself again.
“Lawsuit?” It’s the first time Cas has even mentioned that, and Dean leans closer confidentially. Cas finds his hands suddenly very interesting, sounding very embarrassed.
He gets it. There’s a swirl of some unknown emotion stirring inside of Dean, and he has to look away to keep it from spilling out.
“Dammit, Cas, I’m not some fuckin therapy project for you to feel good about yourself! You wanna hold hands and sing kumbaya so I can find the light? I can handle myself.” Dean has never seen Cas angry, much less angry with him, so he’s taken aback by the gathering stormcloud that shadows his expression, darkening his features. But the raw pain in Cas’ eyes is what stabs Dean in the heart. Cas doesn’t say anything, he just turns back on his heels and marches out, shoulders hunched. And Dean knows, he’s monumentally fucked up now.
The police station comes into view soon enough. Instead of parking the car, Dean drives it near the front doors and leaves the engine on, turning to look at Sam pointedly, who in turn looks at him, pure bafflement written across his face.
he almost says to Sam. But it’s not about hurting one another now. “And I’m not trying to be a comedian to- to hide anything, it’s just the way I deal, you
The man thanks him politely, treading past him in the narrow hallway, looking around like people always do when they’re trying to map out a strange apartment.
"How are you?" Dean grunted in answer to the pointless question and started maneuvering his upper body towards the edge of the bed. He clumsily reached for a water glass that had been placed ready there, fingers fumbling weakly for the glass. It was the drugs, Dean knew, but it felt like a personal slight that his body was working against him. He clenched his teeth together in frustration, and finally got the slippery bastard securely in his hand. All the while Castiel was looking at him intently, looking like he wanted to intervene but did not dare to. Dean shot a warning look at the angel, and Castiel's gaze quickly shifted to his lap and he gathered his hands on his lap like a disobedient child. Finally some real humility, Dean thought, and propped himself enough that he could drink. It was a slow process, one sip at a time through his split, swollen lips, and once he was finished and the glass was back on the bedside table, Dean collapsed against the mattress, breathing heavily. His whole head hurt like a motherfucker, and he had almost forgotten about the angel when Castiel started speaking again.
Sam takes a deep breath and continues, unaware of Dean’s inner turmoil. His voice gains volume with his conviction. “And now… I watch you doing the same mistakes again, you’re making nothing but bad decisions because you’re too stubborn to fix things with Cas. You’re both just so blind sometimes, it’s almost insufferable to watch!”
“Uh, yeah. These killings have something to do with angels, but I don’t know who. I’ve sensed some…fluctuations in the fabric of the grace, like there is a dissonance chord in it, all within the timeframe of the murders. It just feels wrong. And before the last murder, it just grew stronger. But the killings are so wide-spread that I can’t track down the culprits. That’s why I called you to help.” It had taken surprisingly long for Castiel to put two and two together, but he didn’t possess Sam’s talents for investigation. Mostly he had wandered aimlessly from town to town, picking up on prayers, discreetly trying to help people. This wasn’t the first time he had tried to make it on his own, but this time the days felt hollow, greyed out. But it was the way it had to be, and he had to learn how to live with his choices. Then the case had literally fallen into his lap, when the news had reported a weird murder couple of towns over, and he finally had an explanation for the oppressive feeling that had building at the edges of his consciousness for weeks.
Feedback is always appreciated! :)
Castiel’s heart is pounding in his chest when he knocks on the door and stands in wait. He’s only met with prolonged silence from inside the room, which makes him double check the room number. Eleven. That’s what Sam said. It’s more than likely that the brothers are having a silent showdown inside on whether to let him in right now. He shuffles awkwardly away from the door, trying to adjust his damp clothing, even running his fingers through his wild hair in an effort to comb it. A big part of him just wants to run away. Castiel knows the extent of Dean’s rage and he feels sort of terrified to face him now. But he has to try. He has replayed the conversation with Sam countless times, trying to work up his resolve.
“Cas, whoa, okay, wait a little-” he stumbles, grabbing Cas’ hand and removing it from his groin. Cas allows him, lifting his head in confusion.
“Text me when you’re done? There’s no rush”, he grins at Dean, who can only nod, and then there’s that awkward second when they’re not sure how to act around each other, and Dean’s uncertain if he should hug Cas, give him a friendly slap on the shoulder or something, because they never established a routine for this, so they just keep staring at each other for few beats.
“Sammy,” Dean warns feebly, attempting to push his brother’s hands away shakily. Sam doesn’t relent, grasping his hands and guides them away, shushing him. Dean lets his hands fall limply, exhaling shakily. Cold sweat is coating Dean’s skin, gathering under his upper lip and making him shiver. He’s running on fumes and he ain’t got much left.
“Nice, have you contacted them yet?” Dean carries on casually. They managed to meet couple of times before Sam had to leave, with much more success than the first time. Cas and Sam get along well, and with their altruistic, nerdy personalities Dean can’t fathom how they could’ve not. And now Sam can use Cas as a proxy if he wants to nag at Dean and he’s ignoring his texts. It’s working out great.
“Thanks for picking me up. Although, you really shouldn’t have”, Cas rumbles in his ear, detaching himself from the hug slowly, looking at him curiously. Dean rolls with it, even though he could’ve held on just a little bit longer, turning around and guiding them towards the exit. He squeezes Cas’ shoulder, grinning widely.
“There you are. You, um, passed out for a minute there.” The relief is palpable in Sam’s voice.
He drags himself to the kitchen, the smell of fresh coffee awakening him slightly. Sam is sitting by the table, looking little tired but not particularly hungover. He’s browsing a magazine deep in thought, but Dean’s shuffling steps draw his attention and he sits up straighter in his chair.
“I- I came to apologise about last night”, Dean offers, hoping that it’d be the right thing to say. Cas stares at him in sullen silence, before he huffs and opens the door fully, inviting Dean in. Cas is barefooted, and he curls his toes against the cold when Dean enters, bringing in the chilly autumn breeze. He disappears into the kitchen without a word, carrying a certain air of resentment about him, leaving Dean to undress his coat. Dean follows Cas silently, observing him from the doorway. His shoulders are tense, when he picks up the knife and carries on chopping some carrots, and he’s deliberately not looking at Dean. It’s not particularly encouraging, but he doesn’t really have a say in the matter, if Cas chooses to ignore him. He takes a steadying breath, struggling at finding the right thing to say.
“Dean, try to understand. I’m doing this for me. I’m not…giving up on anything, I just think it’d be best I stay away from you now.” Dean bites his lower lip in frustration, his whole posture tightening.
"Castiel...has the tablet." He slurred out the words, tasting blood, painfully noticing how sluggish his entire face felt. Sam furrowed his eyebrows in confusion, ready to shoot more questions that filled in the blanks, but the bare devastation in Dean's features stopped him.
“Hi, yeah, I was just cleaning out stuff and I-I thought that it would be nice to, you know, talk.” Dean is stammering and he knows it. He clears his throat and tries to work out the roughness of his voice.
“Hey, Dean,” Cas says softly, worry tightening the lines around his eyes. There’s a ghost of a smile on his lips, but he looks so unsure of himself, like he wants to touch Dean but doesn’t know how. Dean’s just so damn relieved to see him, and he offers a tired grin in response.
“Cas, I

“Yeah, but the best part was he actually ate that-”
“That was good”, he echoes, and when he continues squirming and huffing discreetly, Dean rolls around to face him, placing a heavy hand on his hip.
“Yeah, like a fucking baby.” He says shortly, wishing pointlessly that Sam would just let it go, but he’s like a bloodhound with these things. They both know how it goes. Hit and evade. But it’s their thing. Sam sees Dean more clearly than anyone, and he has never learned not to shelter his little brother from his troubles. Sam expects to hear a reassuring answer, because if Dean would say otherwise, then he’d know things were monumentally fucked.
“Fuck yeah you can”, Dean answers without hesitation, and then the next few seconds are a blur of moment when Cas pushes him on his back again and settles between his legs, gripping his thighs and pushing them towards his chest, exposing his slick hole. He slides home in a one, swift push, and they both groan loudly when he’s fully sheathed inside Dean. Dean’s overworked body is trying to rally, clenching around Cas’ thick erection, and it’s almost too much, bordering on painful, but it doesn’t matter when Cas begins to move, thrusting into him hard and deep and the sensation turns to just
“Look, I’m not saying what he did was right. But you’ve been doing nothing but pushing us both away ever since you got back, so I kinda get it that Cas probably thought you actually wanted him gone. I know he didn’t want to leave you, but he thought it would be easier for you, since you couldn’t even look at him.” Sam tries to convey calmness in his voice, but there’s an accusatory tone underneath it and Dean’s first instinct is to bristle and defend himself, yet Sam’s words hit him hard.
“Why?”
"Come on Cas, this isn't you. We're family."
When he finally manages to get back to the motel, Sam is sitting at the table, typing something on his laptop. Some things never change. When Dean barges through the door with his offerings in a greasy paper bag, Sam looks up in alarm, immediately trying to read Dean’s mood.
“I thought you were supposed to come back tomorrow”, Dean mumbles, voice rough from remnants of sleep. He swallows around the cottony taste of his mouth, pulling the comforter tighter around himself to combat the chill of the room. The ancient, barely functioning heating system of the bunker never bothered him before, not until he had the luxury of cozying up to Cas every night. Now every time the angel leaves the bunker, sometimes for days, Dean grumbles about it and fetches thicker blankets and puts on some old, ratty woollen socks he would never be caught wearing in the daylight. Shut up, it’s not his fault he prefers to sleep with Cas.
“You’re damn right it wasn’t,” he quips. “Can we finally focus on this damn hunt?” Sam still looks at him like a dog who’s been scolded, but a cautious flicker of a smile tugs the corners of his brother’s mouth nonetheless.
Dean’s not sure what wakes him up the second time. All that he knows is that he’s awake, mind clearer and throat parched like a desert. He blinks in the darkness, trying to orient himself. Hazy images and conversations pass through his mind. Stab wound, hospital and a lot of meds that makes his head dopy. Right. Dean cautiously inhales, careful not to stretch the muscles in his abdomen, and that’s when he notices the complete absence of sound. None of the machines are beeping, all the lights are off. A prickling sensation runs along his arms, his neck, like sharp, cold needles. Something’s definitely off. Dean strains his eyes, trying to find Sam, but he only can make out the shape of the empty chair on his right.
“Look- nothing’s wrong. I just- I want to get ready so we can leave early.”
He prompts, and Dean closes his eyes, in midstep of crossing that final bridge. He knows he’s giving in, but still Dean fights it, fights the urge that says
“In Colorado, Grand Junction, as far as I can tell. I could feel it, few hours ago. And I found this in the local news- “, Cas fishes the phone out from his pocket, taps something on his screen and holds it out to Sam, who takes it carefully, “-a local housewife kills his husband and two strangers. The same MO as the others. She went missing. The chances are she could still be alive.” Dean hears the question in his voice and instantly jumps the bone.
“The last thing I want to do, is out you, but I feel like you’re keeping me under tight wraps, like you don’t want people to know about me. And I don’t want to be anyone’s dirty secret”, Cas says after some consideration, and Dean finally hears the story of the guy who broke Cas’ heart by being so deep in the closet he was practically spitting moth balls. He holds Cas through it, with apologies on his lips when he finishes, and tells Cas it’s mostly his father’s ghost that keeps haunting him, still holding him back. Cas understands, of course he does, and they don’t broach the subject again, but it stays with Dean.
Once Dean’s safely positioned inside, albeit breathing raggedly, broken ankle stretched out on the leather seat, body rigidly leaning on the on the door, Sam disappears from his field of vision. “I need the first aid kit, now,” he explains curtly, opens the trunk and starts rummaging through things. Dean listens to his frantic rustling, sweaty forehead pressed into the cool glass and it takes all of his strength just to keep his eyes open. His other hand is restlessly twitching against his side, seeking out the wound but he can’t bear to touch it, because
“Better?”
"You're the one who never wanted me to leave you!" Dean regained his balance quickly and stood tall, intimidating, their bodies almost pressed together. His hazel eyes narrowed at Castiel's words.
“I’m not blind, you assholes.” Dean cuts in behind them, clearly irked. Sam gives Castiel a final, coercive look, before he swirls around and heads for his bag, ignoring Dean’s comment. That leaves Castiel exposed and he gapes like a fish on dry land, trying to find the words that won’t lead to Dean stomping out of the room angrily.
, bliss", Dean had choked out between rapid gasps, eyes fluttering open and fixating on Castiel, before his whole body had arched when he came spilling in Castiel's hand, letting out a strangled cry, muffled by his lips, more vulnerable than Castiel had ever seen him.
"Is that my shirt?" He had asked immediately, eyeing Castiel's black t-shirt with a frown darkening his features. He's a ticking time bomb, Castiel had thought to himself, and this was not clearly a good day.
“Unfortunately, no. But you seem to have cared for her well.”
“Dean? You were awake? I’m so sorry-” he starts, voice rough from sleep, sounding mortified, but Dean shuts him up.
The first thing Castiel had learned about Dean was that he could act like a teenage boy around his first crush when it came to relationships. From what he had gathered, Dean was all about drunken one-night stands, but Castiel had found out that there existed also a romantic under all that spike and sarcasm.
“Okay, I can explain this-“, Dean gestures to the bloody sigil on the wall hurriedly, “-later, but right now you’re in dan-"
“I actually have no idea, what’s it like to grow up as a gay guy in a small town. I didn’t know any gay people when I grew up, at least not openly gay ones.” He opts for honesty, hoping that Cas will find some mercy in him not to throttle him between his teeth over his ignorance. “Have you like- have you always know you’re gay?”
Dean did not like that. Castiel could feel him sneering into the kiss. There were rules to this game they were playing. Dean’s rules, and Castiel had to obey the unspoken script, follow every turn meticulously. There was only physical relief, achieved by any means necessary, nothing else. Dean pried his strong arms out of Castiel’s grip, and suddenly the angel was stumbling back from the hunter's right hook, jaw stinging. And then Dean was already upon him, fingers digging into his collar, yanking him forward for a fiercer kiss, one that didn’t leave room for breath.
“Man, I wish things would’ve been different as well,” Sam admits, a clear peace offering. They stay silent for a while, until his brother suddenly scoffs, amused.
“Yes, I’m aware of that, and I’ll perform my part in this, just as you will,” Cas answers dejectedly. He sighs heavily, before continuing on. “He can be killed, like any other angel, theoretically. The only problem is the original host; as long as he exists, he can carve up more pieces of himself. And because the newborn parts of him are extremely unpredictable, it wears down the hosts more quickly, which explains the rapidly exploding bodies. We need to kill them, before they can do that, otherwise they’ll just find new hosts. Mutilating himself has already made Raguel weaker, killing few of the newborn hosts should incapacitate him, I hope.”
“Whatever gets you going. I’ll get the room,” Sam offers and gets out of the car, letting in the smell of damp autumn air. Dean opens the door after him and it creaks with a heartbreaking sound.
He trails off, offering Dean some room to explain his side of things. He rolls his eyes, even though Sam can’t see it, but he knows his brother
and he he tried to beat it out of Dean, to make him afraid to even look twice at other men. But it’s still there, and even though Dean’s terrified, he knows it’s there.
“If you have energy to make stupid jokes, you could’ve walked here yourself, you know.”
The opposite door swings open and Dean feels the seat cushions dip when Sam stuffs his gigantic body inside.
It takes couple of hours for them to reach their destination. Dean’s behind the wheel, and Sam has given his usual spot to Castiel, who leans heavily against the door, fading in and out of focus, waking up once in a while to give instructions on where to go. He almost burned himself out in that fight, and the gnawing fear still eats at Dean, the thought of losing Cas. Again, it was little too close for comfort, for all of them. His own ribs ache, and the ringing in his ears hasn’t ceased, building up a dull headache behind his eyes. Cas' power-up almost shattered their eardrums. He wants nothing more than to sleep for a thousand years, but they have to take care of this now, before Raguel has a chance to strike back again.
Dean adjusts himself, uneasy, scanning the almost empty parking lot, absentmindedly noting the overflowing dumpsters by the side of the building and a rundown husk of a car, left forgotten on the corner. This place really is a shithole, even by their standards. He’s probably doing just the opposite of what Sam wants by picking the easier route, but he just needs time. That’s what he needs, yes. It’s just Dean feels like he’s constantly getting knifed when Cas is near.
“What are you talking about? I’m here to apologise to you.” There’s bewilderment in Cas’ words, and Dean risks a glance at his direction, mind trying to catch up with this sudden turn. Cas looks at him, afraid, letting his words tumble out of his mouth in a hurry. “I’m so sorry for the way I reacted, it was completely out of line and awful to you, I think I was just so sleep-deprived and you were sending me a lot of mixed messages and I had
"I don't want to hurt you." Castiel shook his head, determined not let the other man's words affect him. Dean fixed his hungry eyes upon him, piercing through like a blade.
, but Cas’ solid weight above him brings him back in the now really quick. Girls have topped him several times, but he’s never been held down by 170 pounds of pure muscle, and he’s finding out that he’s fucking
A finger touches Dean’s rim, passing over it several times, but never sliding in. Dean curses under his breath, shifting his hips impatiently, but Cas seems hellbent on driving him crazy.
“I mean I don’t have any, you just look like you need it”, Cas calls out after him, teasingly. Dean slams the door behind him in silent protest, and he can hear the other man snicker on the other side.
“We’ll, uh, talk when we get back. Or see you, I mean,” he fills in the awkward silence clumsily, completing it with a weak smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. The flicker of hope in Cas' eyes is real, though. Dean feels like a jerk. Talk. Like that has ever fixed anything. He saves himself from further humiliation by plopping down on his seat, followed by Sam. He starts the car, the very familiar rumble of the engine singing soothing melodies to him. Cas backs up when Dean turns the car and heads for the exit, constantly throwing looks to the rear mirror to catch glimpses of the angel. Cas doesn’t move, instead just keenly following the car with his gaze, until Dean loses him behind some buildings.
“Truce.” Dean steps forward, claps Sam’s broad shoulder, too wired to give him a real smile. Sam nods knowingly, lets his brother push past him to gather their meager possessions, and  work quietly to give him some time to gather his thoughts. It feels like their every conversation is laden with fights and tension, and Dean’s starting to get tired of it. But he has no way to make it better. Time heals all wounds and they’ve always been able to work it out, but their Winchester-repair ABC didn’t exactly cover the subject of turning into a psychopath and almost killing a brother. Sam’s able to verbalize his wrongs and seek forgiveness; Dean wishes he was just as strong.
“Um, hi, Cas. Can- can I come in?”
“Fuck...” He groans, mouth moving against Cas' coarse stubble, pushing the angel’s hand away harshly. The angel huffs in displeasure, a disgruntled, small sound which turns into a keen moan when Dean fits them both in his palm, fingers tracing the bulging veins along the shaft of Cas' erection, feeling how slickened both are already. He can’t take his eyes off, mouth dry with sudden thirst, lips parted, when he watches how the heads of their cocks rub together when he sets up a hard, fast rhythm. Cas thrusts against him, legs trembling with building pleasure, and he meets the angel halfway there, so close now. Cas’ wandering hand sweeps over their erections, thumbing Dean’s slit and yeah, if he wasn’t already crashing through his breaking point, this does it. The orgasm hits him like a cold tidal wave, tightening the muscles in his lower abdomen, and he has no other choice but to ride it out, muffling his moans into Cas' exposed throat, hips stuttering compulsively against the angel, and he squeezes out every last ounce of pleasure left in him by seeking friction on his oversensitive cock, only to feel Cas coming too, fingers wound tight in Dean’s hair, groaning out his name, come coating their hands.
“Hey. Didn’t take you for a early riser.” Cas greets him, voice rough from sleep.
under his breath, and he knows he needn’t have worried. He’s the only one who can witness Cas like this, becoming unhinged, certain beautiful sounds reserved just for him. That thought alone could be enough to drive him wild. Cas gets to work immediately, distracting him with lingering kisses, while his hand slides over Dean’s collarbone, brushing over his chest and nipple, following the curve of his ribs to his stomach, and the warmth of his palm leaves his skin burning and tingling. His fingers brush over the waistband of Dean’s boxers, and he hooks his fingers underneath it, dragging them lower. Dean helps by lifting his hips and they manage to get them off in a more or less coordinated manner. Dean’s hard already, and Cas grips him without any preamble, wrapping his fingers around the hardened flesh, making him gasp and buck up into his hand. Itching for something to do with his hands, Dean fumbles to wrap his hand around Cas’ wrist, but he pushes Dean off, placing a soothing kiss on the bolt of his jaw.
, who was ready to give his everything for him, but he can’t be worth it anymore. So, it’s easier to keep Cas out of reach. Just until he can be someone worthy. And he’s not even sure how serious Cas is about redeeming himself. Maybe he’s just humoring Sam. Maybe he just wanted to see what a mess Dean is and now, all he needs is a reason to leave again.
The man gets up and follows Dean outside. The weather is gray, the kind of chill in the air that tells they might get the first snow any day now. Dean leads him to his car, and the man stops abruptly to appreciatively sweep his eyes over the sleek form of the Impala.
“Is everything alright?” He asks. He signals for a beer, then turning his blue eyes back on Dean.
“I want you here, with me. And I wish…I wish that you’d want that too.”
“Your soul is blackened with sin. I can’t understand why they let you live.” The angel speaks softly from further away, but her voice carries out like it’s being spoken directly to Dean’s ear. His focus sharpens on the sounds coming from behind him, senses working furiously to pinpoint her location, but turning his head seems like a monumental task right now, vision swimming in and out of focus.
“She’s very special,” he answers curtly, and if the other man can hear the slight crack in his voice, he doesn’t comment on it. Dean quickly distracts himself by fishing out the keys from his pocket and opening the trunk. He hands the man couple of the bigger boxes, which he grabs readily, juggling them like they weigh nothing. He piles up the last remaining boxes and closes the trunk, following closely behind. The man has a lean figure, muscled shoulders and thighs that have to be a result of a very strict gym routine. Not what he typically expects of a shelter employee.
“Dean, uh-”, Cas starts, shooting a questioning look in his direction and he gives the man a thumbs-up to continue. “He came to donate some of your dad’s stuff at the shelter, and we got to talking. Turns out, Dean took it as a personal insult that I had never seen his favorite films, so he decided to educate me thoroughly on the subject.”
There are some moments in movies, where time seems to slow down, when the hero of the story locks eyes with the heroine for the first time, a moment of fated encounter, but that moment, Dean just feels monumentally, abysmally fucked. And very abruptly he understands, he’s been fucked from the very beginning, but it’s hitting him now like a oversized brick, leaving him winded. He wants to deny it, wants to shove this revelation back inside the dark corners of his brain, with the rest of his messy secrets, but he can’t. He just knows he’s thoroughly fucked. How the
“Yeah? You got the plans ready for that already?” They talk about Castiel’s vision for a house and his crafting projects, but everytime Castiel tries to change the subject to what’s going on with Dean, he deflects by talking about menial stuff. He can’t. He just wants to feel like a normal person having a normal conversation. Castiel seems to understand and indulges him, conversation flowing then more easily.
Cas sighs, rolling his eyes. Couple weeks have passed since their falling out, and everything feels back to normal. Cas has started a new weekend tradition for them; home-cooked breakfast at his house. Dean’s not sure if Cas wants to use him as a guinea pig for his experimentations or if he genuinely enjoys cooking for him. Either way, Dean’s not gonna look a gift horse in the mouth, free food and great company keeps him happy. And he can actually say that in all honesty. He feels lighter than he’s felt since dad died, instead of constantly being dragged down by guilt and shame. Occasionally they still manage to suckerpunch him when he’s tired or had a bad day, but being with Cas helps.
Asshole
“I don’t want to lose him”, he finally chokes out.
sucking his cock.
“I might be persuaded”, he hums, placing small kisses on the corner of Cas’ mouth, jaw. The angel makes a sound, which might come off as gruff if you didn’t know him, but to Dean it just sounds amused. Cas lifts his head, shifting so his weight is on his elbow, leaning over Dean. His hand wanders upwards, tracing the outline of Dean’s mouth with his thumb, then trailing lower to his chin, to the hollow of his throat. His eyes never leave Dean’s, but the closeness doesn’t feel like it’s too much, more like it’s grounding him, keeping him here, in this current moment.
“You are ungrateful. Do you remember how furious dad was when he found out?”
"No. Don't bother." Castiel was taken aback by his words, hurt evident in his eyes.
“Not saying that the whole sweatpants-thing isn’t sexy, but I think these are in the way”, he says, smoothing his hands on Dean’s waistband, and begins to tug them downward with his underwear. Dean tries to help, and other than an almost accidental kick to Cas’ groin, they manage to get them off quite smoothly. Suddenly he feels really exposed, laying there naked like that, with no means to hide how hard he is, but before he can start to second-guess himself, Cas bends down again, licking the tip of his erection. Dean’s hips snap forward before he even realises it, cock twitching, but Cas presses him down again, firmly. Cas licks wet stripes along the shaft of the cock, mouthing his balls, and Dean’s pretty sure he’s gonna die any minute now. He groans, trying to get some air into his lungs, fingers winding in Cas’ dark hair, encouraging him. Cas sucks the tip into his mouth, easily lapping up all the precum gathered there, before he swallows Dean’s cock down his throat like an expert. There’s something too hot and incomprehensible to see Cas deepthroat him like he’s done this a thousand times, and his brain fries at the thought that behind the homely, soft exterior of this man, exists a pure sex god who’s hellbent on making Dean feel good.
“Are you okay? I will heal you in a bit, once.. I, uh, rest awhile,” he says shakily. Dean raises his eyebrows, cups his cheek and swipes his fingers under Castiel’s nose, smearing them in blood. Huh, he wasn’t even aware that his nose was bleeding.
“Dean?” Sam immediately asks, the calm façade cracking, worry leaking through. His eyes are wide, something frantic bubbling underneath. Dean has to concentrate on holding his upper body up, so he only spares Sam a groan that almost sounds like a
It feels like Dean just fell asleep, when he wakes up feeling too hot and closely pressed up between Cas and the wall. His arms are numb from the uncomfortable position they’ve been in, and Cas is tightly nestled against his back, arm resting on Dean’s side so that they’re almost cuddling. That’s the first thing Dean registers with his sleep-addled mind, but the second thing is much more urgent and it leaves his mouth dry. Cas’ erection, pressing up against his ass. What the fuck. He wiggles experimentally, trying to get his arms from underneath him, but it brings his ass flush against Cas’ cock, and he can feel it twitching slightly. He freezes, expecting himself to go to a full-on panic mode, but instead an intense wave of arousal rushes through his body. Dean’s heart beats so loud, he’s afraid that Cas will wake up. He tries to carefully adjust his position again, but
“Sorry Baby, I’ll fix you later,” he mutters aloud, patting the hood of the car, somewhat ashamed. He gets the bags out and waits for Sam, stuffing his chilled hands in his pockets. He’s missed being on the road like this with his brother. Their usual banter has managed to make his heart lighter somehow, and for a second he is ready to believe that maybe things could turn out okay. Dean kills that thought quickly before the dark thoughts can corrupt it. Finally, Sam emerges, dangling a set of keys from his hands and guides them to their room, unlocking the door.
“Then we gotta just deal with it, right?”
“Now now, it’ll all be alright.” Before Dean can start wondering what she means, the door closes, and he’s left alone on the front porch. He checks his phone before he starts the car, but there are zero messages or calls, so after few minutes of indecisiveness he tries calling Sam, but it goes to voicemail after few unsuccessful rings.
Castiel heard steady footsteps approach the room, and straightened his back to brace himself to face Dean. The man entered, clean of blood and in fresh clothes, a steely expression hardening his features. Dean walked straight to him, cupping his face, and without any hint of emotion, pressed their lips together, stealing a rough kiss. Castiel let it happen, standing still, so not to aggravate the other man. But Dean pulled away just as quick and started walking towards the stairs, and seeing him leave made Castiel’s insides twist and turn, a feeling that something would permanently break if he let the man go.
The sting of the bruises mixed with the hungry, teeth-scraping kisses allowed Castiel to ground himself a little, although his body was screaming with yearning. He was willing to look past the abuse Dean gave him just to feel him near him. They parted from the kiss for a second, as Castiel ripped the blue, blood-stained shirt off with hurry and threw it on the floor. Castiel’s jacket was the next to go, as Dean began undressing him with the same rush, tearing his white shirt open, buttons flying everywhere. There was a strange erratic beat to his movements, like a dying star that was collapsing in on itself, pulsing self-destructive energy around them. Dean was barely containing himself, and Castiel didn’t want to be at his mercy when he went over the edge.
“Dean?” Cas calls from the door. Dean’s throat is dry.
“What are you talking about? I’ll be ready in five,” Dean calls over his shoulder when he exits the kitchen, not bothering to wait for a reply. There goes that relaxed morning.
Dean unlocks the room and clicks the lights on, nodding approvingly to the king-sized bed in the middle of the room. Castiel heads for the bed immediately without any further notion of checking out their room, slumping down on top of the comforter, weight of his limbs dragging him further down, and Dean follows closely, kneeling down in front of him.
“I thought you didn’t want to celebrate.”
“Well good going, Einstein.” He compliments his brother and Sam rewards him with a small smile. They go about their morning routines in their usual silence, and this morning they almost have a sense of normalcy. Dean fixes himself some cereal and opens the first beer bottle of the day, settling back in his seat. He offers his brother a taste, but Sam refuses with a shake of his head, instead just giving Dean a meaningful stare.
“You can cut the bullshit, you two. I’m like a gourmet meal of self-loathing and bad decisions, we all know exactly why he’s after me.”
“Are you hurt? How badly? Give me the address. I’ll come right now.” The increasing panic in Sam’s voice makes his speech harder to follow, and Dean stops to process the fast-stringed words.
Cas breaks the kiss to focus on Dean’s hardening cock, palming him through the jeans and he has to silence an obstinate moan that almost breaks free, burying his face against the other man’s neck. The angel knows exactly what he’s doing and Dean’s movements falter for a moment when Cas' long fingers trail the outline of his cock through the stiff fabric, before slipping in. The touch feels cold on his hot, pulsing erection, sending shivers up his body, and he has to stifle another moan, biting hard on his lower lip. Cas works him free quickly and guides their cocks together with his hand, urging Dean to move with breathy encouragements in his ear. Dean rolls his hips forward, fucking into Cas' tight fist, hot, dry skin dragging against skin. Their erections rub together, and Dean can’t remember the last time when it was so urgent to find release he couldn’t even bother taking his clothes off. Cas feels just as desperate as him, heat coming off him in waves, pulling Dean even closer with a frantic grip on his lower back. He knows how to exert just the right amount of pressure, running his hand up and down their lengths, pausing at the head of Dean’s cock to tease the slit, smearing precum all over, all the while whispering half-coherent stream of
“Well, then show me what you got, tiger.” Cas smiles and kisses him as a response, taking his sweet time to get Dean relaxed again. Then he presses gentle hands against him, urging Dean to lay back, his head against the arm of the couch, and it takes a bit of uncoordinated shuffling to get Cas situated on top of him without crushing Dean underneath. Dean spreads his legs to accommodate Cas between them, bringing their hips together. There’s a brief moment of
“I know getting back to this life isn’t easy after…you know.” Sam is struggling, avoiding speaking about the Mark like it’s the plague. He licks his lips, trying to weigh his next words. Oh, Dean’s not gonna like this.
“H-he needs medical attention. We need to, uh, stop the bleeding and then find a doctor.” She starts to sound more like a seasoned nurse again, voice gaining strength and certitude as she continues speaking. Sam exchanges looks with Dean, and he knows he’s won when Sam sighs in surrender. Dean nods almost imperceptibly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Go get a wheelchair or something,” he murmurs quietly to his brother, who opens his mouth to argue. Fuck, Dean’s too tired to continue this headbutting contest now.
“Cas, stop looking me like a beaten dog, okay?” Dean snaps, regretting his harsh tone the second the words come out of his mouth. Cas finally stops his cowering, blue eyes steeled, hiding his hurt. The angel thinks he can mask his emotions well, but he always forgets Dean can read him like a book. Most of the time, at least. Moments like these are the ones which show how fragile they are with each other,  he realizes with pang of shame. How easily it all crumbles. The loss gnaws his insides, even though Cas is right there.
“So, what the fuck was that?” He asks, running his hand through his hair, noting with slight disgust how it’s a damp mess. The grimness returns to Cas with the question, makes shadows on his face again.
Feedback is always appreciated. Not a native speaker here and I don't have a beta, so the mistakes are mine and mine alone. (Anyone willing to beta this..?). I'll post the chapters regularly, the fic has been finished for ages but I just need to post them  :)
Oh man, do I. You can come over and I can school you on the classics.” Dean answers at once, only then stopping to think if he’s coming off as too forward and pushy.
it means.
“At this rate, never.” Dean says gruffly, mentally already making plans for the three of them.
Dean hunches his shoulders down, refusing to look at him, and suddenly his whole frame seems to shrink.
“How are things here? Anything happened while I was away?” Cas asks, fishing for Dean’s hand, intertwining their fingers easily. His hand is warm and dry, compared to the coldness of Dean’s skin. Cas’ thumb traces patterns on the back of his hand. Dean shrugs.
The first sound he hears when he emerges from unconsciousness, is the incessant beeping. He listens to it, the steady sound pulling him further away from comfortable nothingness with each irritating blip. After a while he becomes aware how his body feels like lead, limbs weighing him down. He’s lying on a soft bed and everything smells of disinfectant. He fights to open his eyes, but they won’t cooperate. Finally, he manages it, taking in the soft light and white, sterile walls. Dean blinks slowly. A hospital, he thinks dully. Why is he in a hospital? He contemplates asking this aloud, but his throat feels swollen and dry as a desert, and he licks his lips.
There are footsteps entering the room behind him.
into the scant spaces between them.
“Sounds like a nice family vacation you had there, champs”, he says, rubbing the last of sleep from his eyes. The angel makes a non-committal sound in response. Cas has taken to spending some time with Claire occasionally, a few days here and there, and even though they’ve officially retired from hunting, Claire or others might manage to rope them into a hunt, because they’re that bad at saying “no” to people. Dean’s hardly heard from Cas in the past few days; a few text messages to let Dean know he’s alive and kicking. Now, he’s not saying he missed Cas or was worried for him - or maybe he was, sue him - but it’s nice to see him back and healthy. He knows the trips are important to Cas. Ever since they lost Jack, the blueness of his eyes was dulled somehow and even though it’s been more than a year, Cas is still not the same. He gets restless sometimes, grief shrouding his features when he thinks Dean isn’t noticing. “
