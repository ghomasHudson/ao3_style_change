Dean hugged him tightly and kissed his cheek. "Off you go now, sir. It's quite late and you've work tomorrow..."
The Chief hummed as he inspected the evidence; he seemed pleased. “That’s not quite big as a murder but… you did it Mr Novak. Those are enough to bring down, not only the Shelbys, but the Solomons too”
It was raining that night; They were staying at a motel in Wichita, after a successful case; Dee had killed that vampire with a swift motion of her machete; Joannah was so proud of her. Dee was a good little soldier. At the age of 23, she never expressed the need to go to college or do something else, apart from hunting.
He thought some disgusting things so he'd make this traitorous boner to fall down and decisively he entered the club. He spotted Castiel under the stage, on a table, sitting, drinking some liquid that was obviously vodka, waiting with a young woman dressed in black. She had black hair and curious, mischievous eyes. "Who's this?" Dean asked the moment he reached them. He earned a glare from Cas and rolled his eyes as he sat beside him. "Look, babe I'm sorry but you know how I feel about you being alone... My mind goes crazy - "
Sam raised an eyebrow. "Oh, Cas is the lion? And what are you? The innocent deer? Should I call you Bambi from now on?"
"You're the best, Sammich. Now you've your very own archangel"
Dean doesn’t say anything in response. Cas deserves more than a high-school drop out mechanic with oil under his fingernails. More than someone who breaks everything he touches.
“Hi, Missouri.”
“Hello, Dean.”
“Of course. I promised my brother as well.”
And that's a good thing.
Cas laughs.
“Looking at you right now, I’m wondering the same thing,” Castiel says seriously. Dean blushes a bit ashamed of himself for making the next offer.
Cas smiles, Dean wants to tell him that being able to look at him and know it’s ok might be the best part of the evening. Cas kisses him again, gently, then leaving a trail of kisses, nips and bites along his jaw, up his neck to his ears. He can’t find the words. He wraps his arms around Cas pulling him closer. He feels a bead of precome on his thigh that isn’t his own. Guess he doesn’t need to worry that Cas isn’t into this, somehow that’s a relief.
Cas awakens to the smell of bacon and the sound of rain still coming down. He opens his eyes, but stays in bed for a moment as the events of last night come back to him. Looking out over the lake, he sees droplets clinging to the window. He was so tired he forgot to close the blinds last night. He reaches for his phone. It’s 9 a.m. He never sleeps in this late.
“Dean?”
“I didn’t tell you because I didn’t  want you to worry.”
“Thanks, I think.” Dean gets up and rings out the washcloth and places it back on Cas’s neck. “Not a dream. Also not entirely straight.”
Cas rolls his eyes.
“Dude, I have no clue who you’re talking about,” Dean says. “But ain’t nothing wrong with shaking your money maker for a living. It’s putting my bro through college with enough left over to support myself quite comfortably. People at clubs save their cash for the dancers. The waitstaff don’t do as well.”
“How naked do you want me?” Dean asks like he’s asking Cas to pass the salt and pepper. Cas coughs.
Dean whimpers, he knows Cas can feel his erection, just like he can feel his.  “Yeah, I did say that, didn’t I?”
Castiel is looking very uncomfortable indeed. He looks up at Dean, hands rigid at his side as if he’s holding back. As if he’s at war with a his body isn’t really his. And then crystal blue eyes meet green -- and it’s game over for Dean.
“Cas, I fucked up that night. I wanted you forever, I just didn’t know how to say it. Missed you like 30 seconds after I left your place and was too scared to go back. I freaked out when every single dumb thing my dad ever said started playing in my head, about how I break everything I touch, and how I couldn’t do anything right. Even though I knew, guess I still know that you don’t think it’s true. By the time I’d calmed down, I didn’t know what to say to make it better.”
“What’s not fair is that I’ve wanted to suck you off since I was 17. I suppose one more day waiting won’t hurt. I just have one question, our first time, do you want to top or bottom?”
“Yes. What about you, no whiskey to get over the hurt?”
“‘Night Cas. Good to see you, man.”
He looks up to find a beautiful women with bright blue hair. There are remnants of stage make-up on her face. She looks tired and like someone keeps throwing new crises at her. He reaches up to shake her hand.
“It’s laundry day,” Dean teases as he gives his own dick a gentle stroke.  It’s for show really since he’s already hard. He walks back to straddle Cas’s lap. Cas whimpers, Dean can tell he's fighting off on instinct to grind up onto Dean's erection. Not that Dean would mind, but he appreciates the small effort to keep professional.
Eventually they clean up and get out of bed. Dean makes Cas pancakes. Cas somehow manages to get syrup all over Dean. Best breakfast ever. Then Dean announces that he needs Cas to stay off the porch so he can get the space ready for their date. Cas retires to his bedroom to get ready. But he hasn’t really ever dated. He lays out five or six items on the bed and he can’t decide.
“What about speed dates? 10 minutes per alpha? We could book them on the internet.”
Cas is looking like he’s won the lottery and found out his dog died at the same time.
“Cas? This feather came out.” Dean doesn’t know anything about birds or about feather or about angel feathers. “Are they like teeth? Once they’re lost is it for good. I am so sorry.”
“Cas, I’m going to move the cars too.”
Zar sighs, he did get his start as a dancer, he’d only stopped once he’d blackmailed his dad into giving them enough money to buy the club and upgrade it.
But this morning he’s proud of himself.  “I got fucked by a lava lamp.” He chuckles to himself. “I. Am. Amazing.”
Dean feels the need to fill the silence
Next thing he knew the paramedics were on him. Jody was giving them a report on what she saw.
Chelsea shrugs. “Ok, kiddo. Let’s go, give Cas and Dean their space back.”
Dean laughs.
“Yes. You want to kiss me?”
“It’s a classic,” Cas says. “Let me get you an unopened copy.”
“Amazing how you can fit such a big thing into such a tight space,” Cas deadpans. Dean shakes his head and laughs.
I don’t kiss and tell.
Cas walks to the back of the store, comes back to find Jamie handing Dean something that looks like her number. Cas clears his throat.
“She was hot and her son was incredible. I hope I get to see him once in a while. Her ex came back into the picture, she started seeing him behind my back. The proposal was just what felt like the right thing to do at the time. Everone told me it was dumb. Think it was a bit of a Hail Mary pass to keep us together.”
The bridge re-opened yesterday, it’s a makeshift thing until the repairs can be completed. But that’ll start next week. It has come to pass that since Lisa kicked him out, Dean’s between apartments. Things are good, but Cas isn’t sure he’s ready for Dean to move in with him yet. He’s planning on staying at the cottage until he can find a place. (Or until one of them concedes that they hate sleeping alone and two places is too much. But for now they are being cautious.)
“They grow back?”
“That could be arranged, I’m sure. Ready for another finger or two?”
“See! What did I tell you?” Cas says snatching a bit for himself.
“Lyra, my name is Cas. I am not your father.”
Maybe Balt has a few moments to spare, so he calls.
Bobby says Jack and Cas rebuilt this place. No more walls, no more being stuck in memories. Just good times with people you love, people you were meant to be with forever. But there is no Cas. He’s not sure what to make of that.
“He is your best friend, Dean. And he is leaving and...”
Dean sets the feather aside and goes back to work. From top to bottom, bottom to top through the rows around the fine bones that hold everything together. He spends hours re-arranging the bottom feathers. Cas is very still and the kittens are snoring quietly in his lap. Dean feels the gentle contented purr coming from Cas. Once he finishes the right he moves to the left.  He moves to the front, when the right wing sweeps him in closer to Cas. It’s gentle yet firm. Then the other wraps around him. He’s wrapped in a cocoon of Cas’s wings. Cas opens his eyes and smiles.
An angel in love is a beautiful thing.
Cas returns to the Cain collection and braces for the inevitable return of the faux-metal Holiday assault, but to his great surprise the album stays on, Dean even flips it over to the B-side.
Even if he escapes this and he finds some way back to civilization, he is still going to have to find his way back here to get his car and his things. He knows it will result in some sort of Winchester intervention. And the last thing he needs is more fucking Winchester drama in his life. A simple life, nice house, job he likes and friends whose very presence don’t remind him every single day of how he let Dean get away..
“But it’s…” And Dean sees for the first time, that he’s not the only one who may struggling with his feelings.
“And of course, he will take one look at you, sniff  your cotton candy and popcorn scent, drop trou and present right there?” As far as Castiel was concerned even a five-minute date with Gabriel should be enough to send anyone running.  “Besides, I thought you’d decided to remain unattached. Something about sharing your gifts with all of weredom.”
“Fuck…” Lyra echoes. They both look at her in surprise. Cas may have forgotten she was there.
“I wondered that too,” says a very gleeful Missouri. “Danced around each other for months, making each other crazy. Lord. The bill has been handled. I expect there are places you two would rather be.”
“I thought it was ectoplasm.”
Cas has heard banshees with less lung power. Maybe he’s wrong, maybe she is more demon that she seems. He gently touches, her forehead. Just an loud, incomprehensible tiny human. Great. Dean seems to understand this request.
“Boooooo!”
“Castiel, my love, how are you?”
Cas looks at Dean, their eyes meet. They get lost there for a moment, like they always have.
“What do I do now?”
“A date?”
“A family history on four wheels.” Cas replies.
“I would like to undress you. Touch you, and take you into my mouth. Is that ok?”
“Usually done between pair-bonds or something?”
: Brother, did you cross that bridge?
“I’m so sorry,” Cas says.
“I don’t remember that. Does this mean you’re coming back to Lawrence?”
Ram, have you seen you? That’s not likely to happen any time soon. But guys, Facetime, it’s almost like being there...
Cas laughs.
“Dean, have you ever had tiramisu,” Cas says. Dean shakes his head.
“Some guys have all the luck,” Dean says.
“I could never figure out why it feels so warm in our bed.” Dean mutters
At that Dean opens the condom, he looks at Cas.
“I don’t understand.”
He grabs another clove and smashes it with his knife blade. Peels it and adds it to the pile. Every few seconds another smash.
Dean is already at work on Thursday, but something is different. There’s a compilation of big band classics playing right now, the big band brat pack version of Baby, It’s Cold  Outside with Dean Martin and Doris Day.
Therapy has helped in many ways. Mostly in pointing out that not everything his dad said was right or reasonable. Telling this story again Dean does feel particularly worthy.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas doesn’t even turn to look at him.
“Geez Cas, trying to get us arrested?” Cas unzips Dean’s leather jacket and makes a move for Dean’s belt.
“Do you say that to all the alphas? Is that why Gabriel disrobed?”
He starts up his SUV. He drives down to the end of the dirt road. But the skies are quickly darkening and the wind has picked up again. Not the best time to be stuck in his car. The cabin is less than a mile away, he can dash back there if things get really bad. He needs a walk, time alone to think. He hears thunder rumbling in the distance.
“Daddy!”
“Knowing your type, my friend, you’re going to like this assignment.”
“I’d like that.” Dean lies.  “I was about to make soup and grilled cheese for dinner. Should I make enough for two?”
“Bu they’re also the only part of you’ve I’ve never seen, I don’t really care what they look like. It’s like your true form. I want to know it all.”
He turns his back to Dean, and finds his way to the porch, the screens have been replaced by windows. In the daylight, Cas can see that the water level of the lake is much higher than it should be. The ominous grey sky seems to go on forever, blending into the pebbled surface of the water as rain fall into it. Even weighed down by all that hasn’t been said between Cas and Dean, the place is still really, really beautiful.
Cas knows how much can change in a night. More thunder and lightning. Cas is tired, so tired — spending the night is probably the right thing to do. There is another dramatic pause.
“Very. Dark hair. Blue eyes.”
“Well, I can certainly give you a lap dance if you think it’ll help your audition.”
“Not what I meant... My plan is to leave first thing in the morning.” Any warmth in his voice is gone, this is cold business Dean. “Get out of your hair. And we can pretend this never happened.”
“Best first date ever.” Dean declares as Cas leads him into the shower to clean up.
They end up at the bunker, where Sam gets Miracle. Dean loves that dog, he’s in good hands with Sam. He thinks Miracle can see him, and follows Dean’s spirit around.
He quietly curses the powers that be and his father for abandoning them. Curses himself for giving into Dean’s request for mint chocolate chip ice cream and tater tots. He was trying to decide between regular and extra crunchy when he heard the prayer again. Less powerful this time.
: at least four days on the first. Probably never on the other
, Dean thinks as he plots creative ways to kill himself.
Cas takes off his shoes and socks.
Dean smell changes slightly, as slight panics seeps in, no no no. He knows it’s bad even he can smell it. Cas reaches out and grabs Dean’s hand reassuringly before continuing.
“I know you both worry. I promise to call when I get into town.”
“Cas, my friend, good to see you.” Garth, one of the areas ridiculously friendly local cops, leans into the SUV. Cas is grateful for the barrier — Garth likes to hug. “Welcome back man, it’s been a long time. How was Canada? I always wanted to go up there.”
“Hmmmm… I’m starving. And a bit sticky.”
Then he’s out the door. The wind picks up and really he should have grabbed a shirt before heading out. He’s soaked within minutes. First the generator, he checks to make sure it’s full of gas then starts it up. They’ve got enough gas that it should last for a few days if needed. He moves a few bundles of wood for the fireplace closer to the door. He doesn’t think the cabin will get that cold, but you can’t beat the romance of a fire.
Cas has the smirk he gets when he’s managed to surprise Dean. A cross between “awesome” and “gotcha.”
“Enough stalling. Out with it. Tell me about the accident.”
“Dean…” Cas puts the little cat down with all the others that have crawled into his lap, and touches Dean’s shoulder. “You’re still hurting from last night. You said you wanted to feel it today, but...”
“Huh, you going to tell him about me?”
“Dean, we’re not all like that…”
“My prince has come to save me....” Cas says as Dean carries him back to his bed. Cas tries to kiss him but misses. Again.
Neither man speaks. Cas stares at Dean. Dean stares at Cas. Dean bites his lower lip, sizing Cas up. Cas, in spite of himself, lets his eyes wander down to his lips. They’ve done this dance a million times, yet as always, no one takes the next step. The storm picks up, making the window rattle, breaking the spell.
“What happened to the furniture?” says a long lost voice that is most definitely not Gabe. It has deep rumble like an old car engine. It can’t be. No, clearly this is an alcohol-fueled hallucination – Cas guzzles a bit more bourbon.
“I think I want you…” Dean crawls onto Cas’s lap, Cas offers his neck.
“But…” Cas tries to reach up and touch Dean’s face, but the room seems to be rotating of its own volition.
“See, look they are uneven there.” Cas points to a spot where the feathers look bent and ruffled.
Sam huffed.
But of course, as he should really have come to expect by now, the human who concerned him most was Dean.
“Get bent,” Bris spat.
It took a few hours to find a suitable place for their ambush. Almost every inch of the lakefront was developed in one way or another, and what was left was just acre after acre of endless cattail marshes. Eventually the boys realized they were going to have to head out to one of the uninhabited islands in the lakes if they were going to find firm ground to attack from, so they ended up “borrowing” a little fishing boat from a lonely pier.
The inscrutable contentment on Sam’s face slipped a fraction, and he set down his fork.
“Dean, I—”
“...You don’t care.”
His fist
Why hadn’t he been doing this all this time—?

It took him a minute to start, but Bris waited patiently, and he found the words eventually.
Bris tensed. “I’m… I ain't talkin’ about Sam.”
there, love,” Bris corrected kindly. She stepped up past Jody’s outstretched hand to hug her, too. “He jus' means I'm his mot,” she smiled as they parted.
“Thanks, Cas, we might need every minute we can get. Our lore doesn't cover other dimensions, but—”
What he did have was a never-ending replay of what had led up to Hell. He ran through it all, over and over, and always came to the same conclusion: It was all his fault. All of it. Everyone had done what they should have, everyone had tried to tell him to stop, but he wouldn’t listen.
“'Course it was.” He stepped back from the counter and offered his hand. “Just thought you might like to dance.”
Bris and her surrounding family turned to Sebhin.
Sam gave a short sigh as he shifted his duffel higher on his shoulder. “Well, he's not as pissy anymore. Maybe you should go talk to him.”
Castiel watched him as he drove, waiting until the car had pulled back onto the slightly safer highway before he spoke.
“Well, that
Rowena blinked at him. Then she seemed to remember where she was, and closed off again. “Not about to share the business of Hell with a Winchester.
And frankly, he was exhausted.
Whoa, I’ll rock you like the sea,
Last night after everyone else had gone to bed, and upon finding that Dean wasn’t actually asleep yet, Cas had settled himself into a seat in the library. A lot had happened that day, so he'd taken his time to go through it all again, and he’d realized that he had made a slight misstep.
over—!”
“I don’t know but we have to do something…” Dean’s hand balled into a fist. “Maybe we can find another angel, get some of their mojo for him.”
Sam sighed, shoulders tensing. "Yes," he grunted in reply.
“I wouldn’t let you drown, Dean,” Cas said with the righteous intensity usually reserved for facing bad guys. “I would never allow such harm to come to you.”
Michael darted Dean's eyes straight to him.
Longing.
Dean was on his feet quickly, supporting Sam's weight with a practiced ease. He shifted to balance him better, and headed for the doorway to the library. Bris leapt forward after him, ducking under Sam's other arm.
“Why didn’t Michael just… kill us?” Direl shrugged. “He’s a bleedin’ archangel, why not just wipe us off the face a’ this Earth?”
“Wha—” She recoiled. “Of
if anythin’ were wrong.”
“Honestly, boy, not every spell requires a gallon a’ juice. I just have to tell this one who it’s for.”
Sam rushed down the stairs over to Dean, “Okay, what is your
Well, alone with Cas.
Dean laughs at this resurgence of now-ancient internet-speak from Charlie.
Sam glanced up and back down to his laptop, “Nope.”
Dean peeked around the corner, “Two guards by the door. How do we get across the front yard to them?”
The store slowly came into view. Cas crossed the vast parking lot in a place between frustration, anger, and melancholy.
“Um— okay. Well,” Claire picked up a lock of her hair, fiddling with it as she looked between the phone and Dean, “I... think I might be a lesbian.”
Jo still frowned. “What else can you tell me?”
Maybe that's what was souring the mood, but Sam was unconvinced. There was something... weird surrounding the three of them in the Impala: Dean was on edge and Cas was being, well, Cas-ier than usual. With Dean, Sam could at least guess that he might be nervous about maybe coming out to Cas as well, but with Cas… well Sam had no idea there.
“The spellbook of our favorite, late, attempted mass-murderer. Obviously. Use your context-clues,” said Crowley. “I took this book off the witch, thus cutting her power in half and giving your bird here the opportunity she needed to take her down. Again:
Dean quietly resolved to stop using it. He answered the phone, “Hey. Where are you?”

"M'sure a man like you ain't asked to wait very often," they said, "but she asked ye then, an' I'm askin' ye now. Show the lass some respect an' keep your patience. You’re not the only thing in her life, ye know.”
"Yes," Cas said. He still hadn't blinked.
“Now you’re going in small groups, not all at once,” he started. “We don't want to draw any attention to you. The flights leave over the next few weeks and you're going to...”
“Sure, alright.” Sam stood with his book and placed a quick kiss to Bris’s forehead. “Good luck,” he smiled, and left to check the map room.
“Dean…”
Castiel said again, and began moving toward her.
“Actually thought I’d see you guys sooner," he said with a smile, "this is the

Sam glanced to his side where Direl was standing, practically bouncing on his toes and clearly biting his tongue.
“Come on, love," they said, "hows abouts you join me for a turn around the block, yeah?”
Castiel turned fully from the door, his whole stance hardening and his face going dark with a
Dean drew himself up. “Fuck, Sam,” he pointed the whisk accusingly, “is this chick really worth all this crap?”
He could see it on everyone’s faces, he was getting better. Things were better. Even Cas was spending more time around him and
Castiel and Dean exchanged a look. Dean nodded.
“What?” Sam looked up to where Cas was making his way over. “Oh, geez. You sure you don’t want my help?”
“Dean doesn't watch those kinds of movies with me.”
Bris’s stomach churned. “But—”
Cas’s frown deepened.
"Ahh, it's alright," Dean said, putting a consoling arm around Cas’s shoulders. "Maybe they'll have like a... a little bee party. Figure out how to all get along."
“The Great War!” supplied Direl.
“I would like… to ask your advice.”
Bris waited for him to continue. He didn’t.
So he decided to go big.
“I’m not sure,” Cas stepped up to them, “I’ve never done it before. It’s highly unorthodox, if not simply blasphemous, to bless an entire body of water.”
“Wisconsin. Thank you,” Castiel said honestly. “Are there any nearby towns?” he asked next. Perhaps there was a reason the portal had sent them here, still on the same continent, yet so far from Lebanon.
“So—what—you wanted me to wait here patiently while they tore you to shreds!?" He tried to jerk himself from Cas's hold.
“No!” Cas quickly took her hand in his own, “No, it’s not stupid, Claire. It’s…” he looked away again, “I'm sorry that I make you uncomfortable.”

Dean paced in his room.

Vast blue light shot out from the hole, rising in a roaring, writhing column to the darkening sky already strained with the coming horror, splitting it anew— rending it, warping it, tearing it asunder with the vast energies spewing forth.
Sam flinched. He slowly turned back around to face Bris. “I… um…”
“Here, maybe I can—” Dean grabbed the necklace and yanked up.
His heart clenched as he watched her go.

“You guys sat out in the common areas all the time, you weren’t subtle.”
Castiel cut off, looking up at something behind Bris. She turned around, following his gaze, and found Gabriel standing in the main doorway.
He needed help. He was losing Sam. Was this the curse, the necklace? Some spell?
"I mean, for one thing I was unconscious for the painful part this time, but what I mean is—" He glanced over at Bris and Dean, and lowered his voice a bit. "I'm glad because I'm pretty sure Rowena used
we got, why do you even want to be here?”
Gabriel nodded again, slower, less shakily this time. Sam decided to just sit with him for a moment, to give him a second to just take it all in. Gradually, Gabriel's breath became more even, and he was finally able to sit still.
After a slight pause, he reaches in and takes one, smiling as he takes a bite.
Dean could shut his eyes to the burning light, but he couldn’t stop the screams, the high, crazed cries, far worse than anything Cas had ever bombarded him with on that first day back on Earth. It cut through him and he toppled, falling to his knees as he gnashed his teeth against the tearing, grating, maddening noise.
That evening, Donna joined the group when they ended up back at Jody’s house. They gathered in the living room to discuss the case as Jody bounced around in the kitchen.
They agreed to head out for lunch, and reconvened at a little crab shack a short ways up the road.
“Bris!” He sprinted as fast as he could and just barely caught up before she reached the seawall, stopping her by the arm. “Please, wait—”
He vanished as Dean turned to catch up with Cas. He picked up a jog, any faster hurt too much.
Rowena fluttered a hand over her heart, “Am I… am I about to give
“Cas…?”
“There ye go, see? I did manage to teach ye somethin’ after all these years!” They chuckled as the two of them pulled apart. “Now c’mon, love, let’s go on an’ get back to them boys. I swears I could about ate a reverend mother right about nows!”
Sam’s phone rang. He pulled it out, relieved for an excuse to stop whatever the heck was happening in front of him.
That feeling built inside of Castiel, a warmth he’d feared he would never know again. It grew and
“Well— My way.”
Sam shared a glance with Bris, and doubled back to poke his head through Dean’s cracked door. “Massachusetts?" he asked, "I got that from Ketch days ago.”
But he couldn’t hear Dean. He rushed the door and slammed his shoulder against it, bouncing right off. He hit it again. And again. Nothing.
“But she

Cas surfaced further away, his face burning with fury.
He had been so close.

The Chorus, that is what I really wanted you to hear when I added the music link:
doing, per se. No, the thing was, interspersed in that consistent regimen were these… moments. Tiny moments that Cas would have never dedicated to memory before. Moments that were, on the surface, absolutely insignificant, and yet Cas found himself floating in them like a leaf suspended in the wind— helpless, frozen, and enraptured. In recent months, these moments had become more and more frequent, to the point that almost every day now, Cas was struck by something new.

Sam glanced at Cas and Dean. They offered no assistance. “Plan?”
He returned his attention to Lucifer, “I’ll stay as long as I can, and when our little brother burns out I’ll return as soon as possible. We must act quickly—”
Castiel’s mouth worked but no sound came out.
She was taken aback by his blatancy, but soon seemed to realize he wasn’t kidding. She pulled her arm back from around his shoulders to handle her glass on the bartop, slowly swirling its contents.
Dean whipped a silver knife from his belt and sprinted in, diving headfirst after Cas before Sam was even ankle deep.
Dean clamped around Cas in a bear hug and leaned back—
Dean let out a shaky breath, *Thank god,* and he rushed out of the kitchen into the library, knowing that Cas would follow.
Sam leaned forward and pushed a book down the table toward Bris. “Right now, I need you to either help me, or leave.”
As Sam gave the contents of the bowl a final stir, Gabriel threw him a sudden smirk.
“Dammit, you don't! I can
Crowley and Rowena vanished. Cas dropped to the floor and Sam’s limbs were released.
be!” Castiel cried, something like nausea wrenching through him. “It doesn’t make sense! It doesn’t make any
you try to put this on your own shoulders, lad."
something off in the front, an initial taste that didn't sit quite right yet, but after that it was wonderfully smooth.
It was morning now, probably late morning. Someone was gonna wonder why he hadn't come out yet, hadn't even made breakfast yet. The answer was simple, of course, but he wasn't about to tell anyone.
“Oh— Well— Thank you anyway,” Cas said. He stood for a moment longer, fingers twitching, before he abruptly headed back up the stairs into the bunker and turned toward the kitchen.
Within seconds the two of them burst into a fray. People dressed in military fatigues were dashing back and forth, shouting, screaming—  They were attacking scattered targets, three targets, as Castiel saw. Direl and Gabriel were fighting a group of them, standing back to back, dodging knives left and right; Crowley was blinking in and around the trees, cursing as he tried and failed to use his demonic magic, being cursed at as he evaded the enemy’s blows; and Bris was off at the edge, fighting two of them on her own, one already dead on the ground at her feet. There was a cut on her left arm, bleeding under her jacket, staining the snow red as she leapt and ducked from her attackers.
“He might not have built it, he might have taken it over from the last King.”
It was late when Dean finally crossed into Massachusetts. The last three days had been a blur of nothing but driving and sleeping, but he wasn’t about to stop. He was so close he could
take the whole of the responsibility upon himself, no matter whether he could actually bear it, that he would try, try so hard that he’d— that he would—”
“R’you
It's like a flood... a deluge of..." He raised pleading eyes to Dean, “It’s very hard to describe—”
Because... again.
gone with ye!”
Another swig off her drink and her thoughts turned sour. Why was she even still here, anyway? She could probably get home on her own if she really tried hard enough. Could probably swim out across the Great Lakes, right out to the ocean, and make her way back home from there. She’d have to go ‘round by… fuck, Canada, Greenland... probably a stop in Iceland... Huh, might be able to fit in a visit to her grandmother’s branch of the family—
A loud thunder clap startles him, he looks outside, the sky is dark and menacing. Something is coming. It’s only then that Dean notices that Cas’s car is gone. There really isn’t far to go with the bridge closed, it’s a two-mile strip. Dean opens the front door, hoping to see Cas’s car parked on the road. Nothing.
“Gabriel, please, I told you I’m not interested in taking a mate right now. Why waste everyone’s time?”
“Oooooh, that’s perfect,” Becky says with a giggle. “Just like in a real strip club.”
Charlie barges in, Gabriel falls into the room behind her. “Dean, Cas, you two ok in there?”
“What’s up, bitches?” she says as she puts down a few bags.
“Now go finish with my tree.”
Cas growls, Dean thinks he looks like a puppy that has just discovered his bark. It’s the cutest thing. He kisses his nose.
“You most certainly would. But we are engaged with this little brigade.”
“Dear Cas, who are somewhere in heaven…
“Thanks, Charlie. I think Victor needed to leave early. I’m ok here so why don’t you takes his place.”
“Hello, Missouri.” Sometimes it takes seeing a person again to realize how much you’ve missed them. He should have done a better job keeping in touch with her.
“Of course, pick me up at 7.”
“So Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl broke up… well, maybe he is ready to face some long hard truths, pun intended.”
After checking his neck and making sure there was nothing more serious than a bump to the head, the paramedic got him out of the car and into the ambulance.
Dean tries to pretend he’s not shocked.
Making sure to lock eyes with Dean, he slowly undoes the last few buttons of his shirt. Castiel turns and reaches up the pole. Pulling himself up off the ground, he slowly, oh-so slowly, spins around the pole, his shirt opens revealing some sort of quote on his ribs. Dean wishes he were within touching distance. Dean had been expecting a sheltered little rich boy, not hot tattooed dancer boy.  Cas raises his legs up to his hands until he’s upside down. Somehow, fluidly, a moment later, Cas has one foot on the floor, the other wrapped around the pole and he leans back and removes his shirt and throws it. And Dean is transfixed.
“Dean Winchester, you are an idiot.” She pokes her index into his shoulder. It hurts but he won’t turn to look at her. “Cas would stay if you asked him. So get out there and stop this before it’s too late.”
“Yeah, he’s hot. But not him, the other guy… you. There’s that tattoo on your ribs. There’s the scar on your hand,” Dean points to Cas’s hand holding Ramzey’s head. Then points to Cas’s hand. “From that time we went fishing. And yeah, I’d know those hands anywhere.” Cas doesn’t miss the way Dean squirms in his jeans.
Cas sighs. “But platonically, because...”
Oddly yes. Not his usual post-break up MO.
There it is, the crux of the matter. They haven’t spoken. Cas sees that he needs to tell Dean how he feels. But to what end? Dean doesn’t love him, not like that. Cas just needs to accept this and move on, just like Dean did. End of story.
Dean just nods, grabs his ginger ale and heads over to the couch.
“Cas, no. Not like this,” Dean says.  “Come on, let’s get you in the shower.”
“Yeah, about that we should probably…” Dean tries regain his composure. He’s seen naked men before, obviously. There is nothing particularly shocking about this except that Castiel is his friend, and his dick really seems to appreciate the view. He shifts, trying to hide what’s growing in his denim all while looking for the cool that has clearly evaded him.
“No, I’ve never really seen them, just shadows. Why?”
“All your fucking learning and you can’t fucking stack a few pieces of wood.”
Then he starts on the left leg. KIssing, massaging, nipping. He taps Cas’s legs farther apart and runs his hands up the inner thighs. Cas bucks up a bit, offering Dean his ass. It’s beautiful, slow torture.
“Yes, Dean. I was wondering that myself,” Cas is standing in his space again and Dean is feeling naked under his glare. He blushes and forgets how to speak English.
“You’re beautiful, Dean. It’s not about your body. Let me show you…”
“I’m not sure I’d be willing to share like that.”
“Gabe and Zar’s geeky dancer cousin or something. Needs a job, Zar can’t bring himself to watch. So yours truly has to do it.” Dean sighs.
Cas moves in closer to Dean. “Hmmmm…. I really don’t want to, but if we keep going, we are going to have to get you out of your pants. If we do that, then I am going to end up kneeling in front of you, and we all know where that leads.”
“Yeah, not quite, she decided to go back to her ex. They have a kid. I can’t fault her wanting that. And well, I’m a mess.”
Dean doesn’t fully remember why he started drinking that day. He was off work and pissed off about something, but he was always kind of pissed off. He’d pushed everyone away. Charlie told him to call her when he stopped being a rude asshole, Sam was barely tolerating him. And Bobby, well he was the last one hanging on, probably out of some sort of parental responsibility thing.
“That dance may have been a bit exceptional. I, ummmm… wanted to get close.” Dean hates himself, but he's feeling just a bit embarrassed by the whole thing. “Just remember that you are in control, always. If someone makes you uncomfortable, you can always end it. Just like they can ask the dancer to stop. Do you still want to dance for me?”
“I’m going to change into something dry. Then I’ll put my food and things away.”
“Is that a rattle?” Cas asks. Dean smiles, Cas loves it when it reaches his eyes.
Gabriel was taking this opportunity to have as many trysts as possible, while Castiel had simply continued what he’d always done. He went to work every day at the university, where he was a tenured professor of astrophysics, teaching, writing and looking at the stars. He didn’t want some poor unsuspecting omega to get stuck with him. He knew his mother was true to her word, but his father was more rational and could be talked out of this. Still, Sunday dinner was difficult enough without her non-stop “why won’t you give me grand-pups” refrain.
Dean got a job at a local oil and lube place. Cas kept an eye out, and provided lore and expertise to other hunters. They’d just settled into a routine. They should have known that it was too good to last, their time as borrowed as it was.
“Gabriel, what did you do?” Castiel says.
“Deeeeeeaaaaan, you gotta come sing Wanted Dead or Alive for us…” Jo Harvelle, is beyond drunk yet somehow still standing. “It’s a tradition.”
“Let me kiss you.”
“Text me when you make it to the cabin.”
“Oh that can’t be good.”
“Don’t knock until you’ve tried it.”
“But he is a dancer… that’s what he’s studying.” Gabe counters. “And he is easy on the eyes, gives off a bit of Clark Kent vibe. Come on, admit it, if he weren’t your cousin, you’d tap that.”
“Ok, ok, that’s enough!” Gabe says motioning for the music to stop. Thanking fuck for small mercies, Dean downs another vodka and fills Gabe’s glass.
. It wasn’t high art, but it emphasized his physique and his assets. Come to think of it, he’s not sure he even touched the pole. Zar got appropriately distracted during the lap dance, and offered him a job on the spot. His dancing had improved considerably since then.
Cas looks victorious, as he crawls up Dean’s body. Kissing him deep and filthy -- Dean can taste himself on Cas’s tongue. He feels Cas stroking himself between them.
Clearly his usual meditation technique is not going to work. Cas then tries looking for the space between the wagons of the train but they are filled with images of Dean. Focussing on the rhythm of the rain hitting the window, but it sounds like an old Zeppelin tune. He gives up, frustrated and angrier than he was before. He really should have eaten first. When he finds his way back to the kitchen area, he sees that his coffee has been refreshed, and a green apple with peanut butter is on the plate — his usual breakfast. It’s a small gesture. And he feels his rage ebbing as he cuts the apple into quarters and spreads peanut butter on them. He’s so lost in thought that it’s some time before he sees Dean’s note.
Dean spits out his water.
It was a hell of his own making, and he knew it, but Dean wasn’t sold on the concept that he might have a problem with alcohol, and honestly, he only went to rehab because they wouldn’t give him his license back until he had. During his first session with “Just Donna” his court-appointed therapist, she suggested he stopped drinking until the next appointment two days later. It was a bet, if Dean won, Donna would sign off on his license, if he failed, he would pick up doughnuts for the next session.
“Mistakes were made, charges were laid. Rehab ensued. Got 13th stepped, and well that’s it in a nutshell.”
“No,” she says with surprising authority.. “Monsters.”
They settle on Captain Marvel followed by The Black Panther. If they end up sitting close enough on the couch that their knees touch, Dean will count it as a win.
Dean rakes his eyes over Cas. Cas feels naked and exposed.
“Please.”
“Gentlemen, please,” Zar says stifling a laugh himself.
“Hi,I’m Dean. I hear you’ll be entertaining me this morning,” Dean is going for cocky but it falls flat when a pair of blue eyes lock with his own. He tries to look away but ends up fixating on the slightly chapped, full lips. Damn, Gabe was right, this man is stunning.
“Some one’s going to be coming on you, soon enough,” Gabriel snorts.
“Heaven forbid…”
“It’s fine, Cas. Just water. We can clean it up later.” Dean is trying to look ok but it’s a nervous facade. Cas wonders if this is as difficult for Dean as it is for Cas. Probably not, but then he just stares at Cas again — ironic really, since Dean always used to accuse him of looking too intensely.
Cas can’t help it, he leans in and kisses Dean a bit more chastely.
“Hey, you little stray trash kittens, go join the others on Cas.” And all 15 kittens re-arrange themselves in his lap. This time, when Dean touches the wing pushes back against his hand. It moves offering itself to him -- Cas is offering himself to Dean. Very gently, he feels each feather. They are silky soft, almost liquid, and warm gentle heat. He uses his fingers to comb through, to feel each one. Cas seems to play along fluffing up, tickling Dean when he least expects it. It’s amazing and beautiful until one of the feather comes out in his hand. Dean panics.
“Whatever you like, Dean.”
“I’ll make you a deal,” Dean whispers into Cas’s ear. “If you remember any of this once you sober up and you still really want me, we can talk about it.“
He weeps. All those weeks after Cas got sucked into the empty. All that time, when he put on a brave face for everyone when all he wanted was to feel the agony of his loss. The way Jack just rebuilt the worlds, and the folks were happy. Jody, Donna, the girls, Charlie, everyone. They were so pleased it was over. He was glad too. No one seemed to want to talk about the cost. And he couldn’t explain why his was suddenly so much greater than everyone else’s. Some things he just wanted to keep for himself. So he didn’t tell them, just something about Cas’s stupid brave last sacrifice for humanity. Jack knew, all he could offer Dean was a sad smile, but no angel.
“I am sugar and spice and everything nice and you know it.”
It’s a question, Dean could say no. They are supposed to be taking this slow. He probably should, but he’s a weak man, so he nods. Dean can feel the heat from Cas’s body while he gets his hair ruffled. Then he feels the towel move gently down around his ears, over his face. Cas kisses the tip of his nose, stops for a moment then gives Dean’s lips a gentle peck. Dean places his hands on Cas’s hips.
“Cas, you are so beautiful like this. For me…” Dean know this is hard does his best to offer comfort running his hand down his boyfriend’s wing. “My boyfriend’s got wings.” Cas chuckles.
“Still not into that hippy crap, though.”
Dean doesn’t need to be asked twice as he pulls Cas closer. But Cas will not be moved.
: Sober?
“Oh, babe…” Dean directs Cas under the water to rinse out the shampoo.
“Come on… “ Cas said as he grabbed Dean’s hand and pulls him into the bedroom. He catches a glimpse of uncertainty in Dean’s eyes. Cas had to be sure, so he asked again.
The apartment that he left less than an hour ago is now in massive disarray and eerily silent.
Cas takes his time. Prays Dean isn’t freaking out. He cleans himself off and gets rids of the condom.
“When we’re old, and I’m telling Sam’s grandkids about our first kiss. I’m going to tell them about this one.”
“Ewww, can I be spared the incest?” Dean shudders. “Guy is a real dancer, why not let him try out and see? Not like you didn't start off there...”
Where are you, man? I need you. I have to tell you things. You don’t need to stick around but at least let me set this right.”
Dean huffs out a breath. “Not really a vacation, more that I needed a place to stay where I wasn’t in everyone’s hair. I’d been crashing at the garage, but it’s not ideal.”
He just smirked as he arranged his clothing. “You’re up next little brother.  Word to the wise bro, he really doesn’t want to see your knot.”
“Because you don’t get out much and you need to see what you might be missing.  Besides Mikey and Luke both struck out and that never happens.” Michael and Lucifer were the Milton clan’s older alphas, few had to the nerve to refuse them anything. And yet, this little omega had sent them away.
Cas walks through the carnage of what’s left of their living room. A chair is overturned and there is rice and macaroni strewn all over the floor. A strange white liquid is drying into the small black and white area rug. It might be milk. Their large brown leather couch, the one Dean insisted they buy, has a bright green ectoplasm-like blob on the middle cushion. The remote is lying broken on the floor, but the TV is on. It’s playing an old episode of Blue’s Clues.
“I do know that’s sexist.”
“Damn the power’s out. I’ll get candles,” Dean says and stands up and tries to dart out of the room. But Cas catches his wrist. “We’ll need to get the generator going.” Dean continues as he tries to get away.
“Stay…” is all Cas can think to say.
“Don’t you dare.”
“Would you like me to stop.” He looks at Dean a bit concerned. Dean smiles.
He woke up to a series of panicked texts from Sam and Bobby asking where he was, apparently they were supposed to have had dinner the night before. He didn’t care enough to answer. He turned off his phone and finished the bottle of JD in front of him. The passage of time is a bit hazy, but when he woke up next, he craved salt and carbs of the fast food variety. Nearest Rotten Ronnies was in the village 20 miles back. Dean admits he was feeling a bit off kilter but figured it was hunger and a hangover. He’d been asleep for a good long time, now time for the punishing aftermath. He started driving down the dirt road, when right before the bridge he swears a rabbit darted out in front of him. He took a sharp turn to avoid it and drove his beloved Baby into a large oak tree.
“SCOOOOORE one for Ash, Kevin, that’s another shot for you….”
“If you could set the wood to dry by the side of the house, we can chop it into smaller pieces later. Meanwhile I’ll make lunch for us.”
Cas loves that story. He read his poem and they’d given him a scholarship for college. And Dean hooted and hollered like he’d scored the winning touchdown. Afterwards, Dean hugged him hard. The group assumed they were a couple. Dean didn’t correct them. It gay boy gets on up on the popular girl in school, and for a moment, he even had the boy.
The sun comes beaming in through a crack between the curtains. As he’d feared, he’s alone in his bed. His head hurts, his heart hurts, and he needs a cup of coffee so badly he can smell it. Actually he can really smell coffee. He sits up in his bed. He can hear someone in the kitchen down the hall. “Please let it be Dean,” he prays. “Please let it be Dean.”
“Not so sure about that, I’ve always been a sucker for a guy in a well-tailored suit.” Then Dean licks his lips and goes back to sorting records. Castiel takes a deep cleansing breath and wonders what he did to deserve this.
Totally your call, brother. How do you feel about that?
“Fine. If this is how you treat your friends, you can lose my number too.” She gets out of the car and slams the door.
And reaches for  Cas hand. He can’t help but feel himself fall completely under the spell Dean’s charm. He reaches up and kisses him again, while Dean unlocks the car door, and holds it while Cas gets it. Cas reaches over and unlocks the driver side door. Dean gets in, Cas slides in next to him.
“Dean, we have all the time in the world. We don’t have to do anything you’re not comfortable with slow, remember?”
Then Cas shimmies out of his pants revealing, of all things, an orange g-string.
Cas winks. “Once Lyra has gone home, you have a closer look if you’d like.”
“Did you make cornbread?”
There’s a cold compress on his forehead when he opens his eyes – and a lot of pain in his head. A pair of concerned green eyes are looking over him.
“Thank you. No. There are any number of people I need to check in with. They’ll be worried.”
“Looking like you cleaned up well yourself.”
“Oh, so you’re pretty sure there’s going to be a next time. Cocky,” Dean pulls Cas closer and grabs his ass. “Damn you’ve been holding out on me, some muscle in that ass.”
“My room. Now.” Cas said before pushing Dean away, turning him around and chasing him up to the bedroom.
Cas needs a lot of things right now, a stiff drink for one. But he swallows hard and shakes his head no. Then they stare again until Cas can’t bear it. He turns around and heads back to the car. He really should drive away and not come back. But at this moment, it’s easier to deal with Dean than the interstate.
“But mom…”
“Oh baby, I been blind…”
Cas nods as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. And Dean is suddenly very jealous of little Kai snuggled up on Cas’s shoulder. He runs his hands down Cas’s back. “Do they see the true visage or this vessel?”
“I need to tell you a few things. I kind of keep chickening out. God, this was easier when I was rehearsing it in my head. I just want to explain about that night, about the last two years… about everything. One of the things they talk about in rehab is making amends to people you’ve hurt, but only if you doing so doesn’t hurt them more. I’d been clinging to the last bit, but Benny says it’s an excuse. So I dunno man, I hope this doesn’t make it worse. Things are plenty bad already.”
“Thank god you’re back. They issued another tornado alert.” Dean says as Cas walks into the cabin. “I was worried.”
Dean looks a bit taken aback, sad almost. It’s not what Cas expects.
But without the distraction of mind-blowing orgasm, he is curious, very curious in fact, as to how big true-visage angel dick is. He tries to do the math proportionately: assuming Cas is the size of the Chrysler building, what does that mean for his dick and is that bigger or smaller than Dean himself? Why do angels need dicks in the first place, they don’t pee and they don’t make baby angels? He put away the last cup, decided he should ask Cas about it, word problems were never his strong suit.
At least, he’ll have some time to write those lessons plans.
“Ramzey is a lovely man and a dear friend. But I don’t understand, Dean. What are you saying?”
“Dean honey, I know I said I wouldn’t push the issue. But this is taking up a lot of my time. Sam suggested maybe you could take over, set aside a bit of time to see them? I want you to be .”
The phone rings after breakfast while Dean and Cas are doing the dishes — Cas washes, Dean dries. They’ve touched a total of 28 times since they got up this morning, right now Dean’s arm is brushing against Cas’s. Cas can deal with being relegated to friends, but the mixed messages this morning are frustrating.
Whether he likes it or not, Kansas is home. His people are here, and he’s never really felt like he belonged anywhere else. He’s missed things too, his favourite burger at the Roadhouse, Thursday night games with Charlie, the coffee shop next to Gabe’s office with the amazing cinnamon buns. The only thing keeping him away is one Dean Winchester. Cas tries lie to himself and pretends he’s over Dean. He’s  just someone he used to know, right? He doesn’t believe himself.
“Whatever you want, Cas.”
“We can’t.”
Cas looks right up at Dean and smiles. As if this is something that happens every single day. “You can put your hand back, now. I hear you have a thing for hips.”
Oh Cassie, that is absolutely dreadful. I am surprised they let him leave Narnia, he seemed so happy in that closet. Then again, we all know what happened to that lion. Maybe Dean is to blame. This does not bode well for your fetish, Ramzey.
Cas doesn’t say anything he just nods. Dean gently moves all the kittens, stands up and walks behind Cas. Even with Cas kneeling in front of him the wings are taller than he is. Some of the feathers seem out of place, like they need to be combed, replaced. The bottom layer is in tatters.  “Cas, this damage, it’s from helping us?”
“Booze is all over the place, Cas. It’s ok. Alcoholism is genetic but like there’s often a trigger. Shit with my dad, probably learned it was a coping mechanism.”
“I’ll make you waffles.” Nuzzles. “Bacon.” Lick  “Coffee too.” Bite. “If you let me have you this morning.”
He waits a few moments as three dots appear.
“Thank you again,” she says.
Dean is admittedly moving a bit more slowly today as he tidies up the kitchen in the bunker. Last night, Cas decided to “try something new”  and started inserting larger and larger things up Dean’s ass. It started with a small dildo, then various food items:  a churro, an ear of corn, an eggplant then onto bigger and wider household items. He was honestly shocked when the lava lamp slid all the way in, but safeworded out when Cas started lubing up a
Thing have suddenly becomes much more interesting. Castiel looks decidedly uncomfortable. He keeps staring at his feet.
“I’d like that. It will be good to see everyone again.” Everyone except Dean..
“You wouldn’t dare tell mother!” Castiel would really rather die than spend his Thursday doing this.
“Yes, so fucking ok…”
“Besides, sweetie, you might find your true mate. And you’ll just know.”
“Kai.”
“Gabe and Zar are going to kill me for this. You have the job right, like don’t do this because you need the work.”
When Balthazar took him under his wing (and eventually his sheets), Cas felt like this was the change he was craving. They explored Ottawa together, from the Canal to Beavertails. (The only kind of beaver Balt said he would eat.) Eventually Ramzey and Carter moved: in smart beautiful gay men, completely secure in who they were and what they wanted. Somehow, they were a mini-tribe, an arrangement with close friends with benefits. He did love them all, and it was easy and fun.
She smiles and nods. “Boo!”
Sam looks over the pyre, flicks the zippo lighter and throws it in. Dean recognizes it as his own. It is only once the flames reachhis body that he finally sees the path. He pats Miracle’s head, and ruffles Sam’s hair one last time.
“God, Cas, you…”
“Cas, I’m so close.”
Dean gently cards his fingers through Cas’s hair. “I find that hard to believe.”
His phone rings, it’s Balthazar.
Dean gives a deep chuckle and pulls Cas closer to kiss him once more. He nibbles along Cas’s chin, licking down his neck. Dean works his way down his chest, nipping, leaving little bite marks.  Cas moans. The path continues to his navel, then to the hip bones as Dean pulls down Cas’s pants.
Getting ready for his date with Dean is more nerve wracking than he’d imagine. He feels silly for all the clothes currently strewn all over his room. In the end, he opts for slim-fitting dark jeans and his favourite blue cashmere sweater. He fusses with his hair, but quickly realizes it’s hopeless. Dishevelled it is. The doorbell rings, and Castiel realizes his palms are sweaty. He opens the door to find Dean looking gorgeous as ever, with no sign of his usual bravado.
“It’s not porn, I know. I might have prepped in the bathroom.”
Could be worse, at least she’s over her crush on him.
“Tell me my chili is still amazing.”
“Perfect, then it’s a date.”
Dean returns mid-afternoon with a pie. In typical Mildred fashion, she’d fed Dean and sent him home with a treat. Dean sets the dessert down on the counter. Cas is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, reading.
Cas nods and looks slightly ashamed and pulls the wings in towards himself.
“Good to see you, brother! He’s already there. Warming up or something,” Benny explains. “How come he gets special treatment?”
Cas nods. “Let me see if I can show you.”
Oddly no one had every asked Dean what he wants. His animal brain chimes in CasCasCas. He gives in.
“As you recall, you seem to have no issue with it when I was handling yours.”
“Do you think Kevin will be ok?” Cas places a glass of water and a bottle of Advil on the nightstand, and strategically places an empty metal trash can by the bed.
“Yes, Dean.”
“She’s good, told me she basically told her son to drop her off and leave her alone. Says the Winchesters always treated her better than Dick ever does. Said she missed me, us. Whatever. Glad to see we are back. I tried to explain that there was no ‘we’ to speak of but… ” Dean doesn’t finish the sentence, there is no need.
Cas wakes up to the sounds of birds, and an empty spot beside him in bed. There is nowhere for Dean to go, still he panics momentarily. It’s still too new.
“I remember that night. I almost kissed you,” Dean says softly. That’s his Dean, Cas thinks. This tender man who has been through so much.
“You know, the truth. You came back, remembered I was totally hot and you finally tapped this.”
The howling wind slams the rain against the windows again, punctuating Dean’s point. Cas really doesn’t want to head back out there either, he’s so tired of driving.
Charlie is suddenly sitting at their feet, her girlfriend Gilda next to her.
“Cas, good to hear your voice. Still in the car?”
A petite blonde woman walks onto the stage, dressed in a weird get-up of white feathers and papier-maché, like some sort of homemade chicken Halloween costume. She’s even wearing yellow fishnet stockings and red high heeled platform shoes.
“Ok, what do you remember?”
Even if Cas has changed his mind about Kansas, there is nothing he can do about it now. He’s stuck in this motorized cage until he gets to his destination, which at this rate might be some point in the next millenia. It was supposed to be an easy eight-hour drive. He got up this morning at 9 am, and it’s now nearly 9 p.m. and he swears the walls of the car are closing in on him. He knows if he pulls over to stretch his legs, he’ll never have the courage to get back on the highway.
What Dean wants and what is good for the both of them are two different things. He’s decided he can’t have Cas and that’s the end of that.
“You two kissed and made up, I see. You gotta give me a sec here.” Gabe pulls out his phone and snaps a photo. “Gotta send that to everyone. Good thing the pants hadn’t come off yet.”
“Oh, I met her after all this happened. We kind of hooked up after a meeting one night. I think we both just needed the release. It just sort of evolved from there. Benny says I got thirteenth-stepped.”
“Nah, after the accident I really didn’t come up here much. Lisa wasn’t into roughing it. We decided on a road trips instead saw a bit of the country. She bitched the whole time about that too, said she’d prefer an ‘all inclusive’ beach with drink with frou-frou umbrellas.”
“Forgiveness is an interesting concept, you know. It’s not pretending the past didn’t happen. It’s acknowledging the pain and the hurt while refusing to let it hold you back from moving on and creating something new.”
“Welcome back,” Dean says, he stops playing to speak to him.
“Thank you.” Cas gets out bed, he’s naked. “Did you want to come in?”
“Here let me get that for you,” Dean says as he wipes the sauce off Cas’s lip with his thumb and licks it. Cas wonders if anyone has ever fainted from a sudden rush of blood to the cock.
Cas and Dean have been the yin and yang of Little Wing since Chuck Shurley hired them on two years ago -- Cas’s in-depth knowledge of classical, jazz and folk a natural counterpoint to Dean’s passion for rock, blues and old country. It’s a bit of a love-hate but it’s a solid work relationship except when, like today, Dean’s love of things loud and guitar collides with Cas’s love for all things bop and big band.
“Wait, no Dean, stay. Please? Just give me a second to catch up. I remember last night, I think.” Cas is not letting Dean get away, not again. “We should talk.”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck…” Lyra begins again. They may have to apologize to her parents for the sudden onset of profanity.
“We haven’t even had our first date and we’re already talking about grandkids.” Cas isn’t quite read to let Dean go.
“Dean!”
No doubt it’s a beautiful thing, but Cas and mornings are not friends. Then Dean leans down and kisses him. Maybe this isn’t so bad.
Dean feels a hundred times lighter now that he’s spoken to Cas and the date settled and well, the kiss. But he’s got to deal with stuff around the cabin. The wind has picked up again. And the rain is coming down in sheets. Dean is surprised the power hasn’t gone off before now.
“Well, what have we here,” the waitress is a short, plump woman with warm kind eyes. “My name is Missouri. I’ll be helping you tonight.” She seems to be examining the boys a little too closely. “Oh, finally a first date for you two. ‘Bout time too.”
“It will never be like it was. But yes, we can try.” Cas looks disappointed though and Dean’s not sure why.
True to his word, Dean has placed the briefcase with his laptop on the desk by the window and his overnight bag at the foot of the bed. He picks it up and opens it, looks over his options for dry clothing: jeans, henleys, sweaters, t-shirt, sleep pants. But he’s not sure what the dress code is for confronting the past. He settles on sleep pants and his favourite University of St. Paul hoodie. If this is going to be terrible, he may as well be comfortable.
“Does anyone hate heaven, I mean it’s good and all but I think I might just hate it here?”
“Zar wanted me to see what you can do with a pole,” Dean says with an eyebrow waggle,
“I, ummmm, don’t have any jazz or Christmas tunes. Zeppelin ok?”
His mind flashes to sandy beaches and the warm sun. She gives his arm a gentle smack.”And you know California would only be another diversion.”
Dean seems to be choosing his words.
“What did you say to her?” It comes out harsher than he’d meant. Dean just ignores it.
“You know his knot isn’t nearly as big as mine,” Gabriel says to Dean, he really can’t stand being bested. Cas growls again, like he means it.
“The interstate in the rain is never fun. One of the reasons I prefer the long way round.”
“These are for the Vince Guaraldi concert on Saturday night. Your shifts have been covered because Chuck fears the unresolved sexual tension between you two will explode in a very un-family-friendly way. I have taken the liberty of booking you a reservation at Tony’s Bistro. The cute little Italian place up the street with the red-checkered tablecloths. I recommend the lasagna.” She points at them . “You two are going on a date.”
Dean wanted more.
“Cas isn’t a bird, silly. You’re the only baby bird here.”
“Dean, you probably want to get that away from her. I am sure her parents will not approve of her playing with it.”
Cas wishes he had more small talk in him. Sam’s voice on the end of the line was soothing. He starts a David Tennant podcast, he’s talking to Michael Sheen. They sound like old friends. It’s endearing. It doesn’t remind him of Dean, much.
It’s an odd question.
The question seems to calm her. She shakes her head, then rests it on Cas’s shoulder. Oddly, her hand is rubbing the spot where his wings meet his back and she’s running her hand through those feathers.
“But…” Dean and Cas say together but Missouri has walked away again.
“Not gonna last long.” Cas swallows. Dean doesn’t mean to, but he thrusts up into Cas’s throat. “Fuck, I’m sorry.”
*******
Castiel sits on the couch. Dean gets up and walks over to it and sits next to him. Their knees touch. Dean is suddenly breathless and Cas is taking deep cleansing breath, as if he’s trying to fight something off. He’s blushing. Dean thinks he’s the most gorgeous man he’s ever seen.
“Hey let me… “ Cas wipes off Dean’s chest, and the excess lube from his ass. Then he crawls in behind Dean, wraps himself around him. Dean makes like he’s going to protest, but snuggles in instead. Cas covers them both and hopes that bridge doesn’t open too soon.
I have no shame
In his last thoughts, he prays.
“You had new people in your life. Less fucked up people.”
“Yes.”
It’s a cold grey day in Lawrence, unusual for late August. The clouds hang low in the sky, and a cool wind sends shivers through the trees. Dean sits in his beloved black 1967 Chevy Impala down the street from Cas’s apartment. He doesn’t get out of the car, he just sits watching. Sam comes out holding a box and makes his way to Cas’s old SUV — the one Dean rebuilt for him. A very small part of Dean is glad that he could, at the very least, give Cas a safe ride to his new life even if he’s chosen to no longer be a part of it.
“Have a seat.” Dean pulls out one of the chairs and asks Cas to sit. “I’ll be right back.”
Christmas is a busy time in record store world and Friday is no exception. Somehow Dean and Cas end up behind the cash, even though it’s usually Kevin’s spot. It’s mindless work. Regulars know to ask them for help anyway and the Christmas crowd usually go to the front desk first. Cas is sure he imagines that Dean’s hand lingers over his own when they pack purchases, just like the many times he feels Dean apologize as he rubs up behind him as he helps a customer. The space behind the counter is small, right? All this is bound to happen.
“Please. Hear me out. This is hard. I know what Missouri said, what a lot of people have said, so this is me trying. You deserve so much better than me. You deserve some super-smart, hot, perfect guy, who has a good job and can take care of you. Talk about all that religious stuff you keep studying. Not the fucking mess that I am.”
“Well, you do have wings.” Dean goes for levity. “You sure there aren’t any nephilim of yours floating around.” Cas hates it when he throws things like this out there.
Dean picks up on the vulnerability. It’s hard to show yourself to someone like this.
I didn’t know how much you wanted to know.
“To be fair, it looks more like a retro toy than some of the things they brought over for her.”
“That little one…”
Smash, there goes another clove. But Cas isn’t done.
“Cas, where are you, man?”
Smash. There is going to be a lot of garlic in this chili. Smash. Smash. Smash.
This makes Balt laugh more.
“Me too, Cas. You here with me for good?”
He wants Cas, he’s in love with Cas. And yeah, the idea of Cas with all those other guys is making him a bit nuts. The clip is hot as hell, but what he wouldn’t give to be the only one who made Cas feel that way. But he can’t and he’s trying to make to do with that he knows he can have.
“I would have answered, you know.” Cas finally says. “Had you called.”
“It’s what it always should have been. Everyone happy, everyone together,” Bobby explains. His parents live down the way, Rufus  too.
“It’ll make Mother happy.”
“Would it be ok if I drove?” Dean asks.
“Dean, there’s plenty of hot water. Would you like a cup?” May as well play nice.
“Yes. Cas, I….”
Cas runs the tips of the wing along Dean’s face. Dean realizes he’s crying. It’s going to be ok. It’s finally going to be ok.
“Yes. I’m yours.”
“We all have a good reason to do it, Cas,” Dean says gently. He’s forgotten what the rest of the name is. “But getting naked for strangers isn’t for everyone. I just want to make sure you understand what you’re getting into.”
Cas just watches the scene as if it’s happening to someone else. But when Dean draws him into a hug. Cas collapses into his arms holding onto Dean, like he never thought he’d see his lover again.
“Almost there,” he tells himself. But the last half hour is crawling by, and it feels like he’s been trapped in this car for weeks.
“Turn around, I’ll wash your hair and back.”
He can see the light of the exit up ahead. Soon he’s off the highway onto a deserted rural road. It’s much darker here, but visibility is better without the spray from the other cars and trucks. He turns down the radio and tries to find the usual landmarks, the broken tree and the old shack signalling the hidden road, but the rain and dark make it difficult. In spite of GPS directions, he still manages to miss his turn. He doubles back twice before finally spotting it.
He looks up at again, there’s Cas watching him. He ponders changing it to some sort of cheesy love song. He plays to his strengths sings what the crowd wants. After the song, he’ll go talk to Cas, like adults do.
Food and the weather, two safe things they can discuss. Cas figures he might have to make a list. Still he’s thinking about what Missouri said. They do need to have a conversation or it’s going to be a very long week.
“Oh my god, Cas… the rocket... “  The rocket, aka, the new big wide vibrating sex-toy Dean decided they needed. It’s never been used. Cas isn’t really sure he understands the purpose of the thing, and Dean hasn’t had the chance to explain it yet.
“There’s a towel on the back of the couch for you,” Dean says looking up from behind the fridge door. He’s taken Cas’s bags and moved them into the small galley kitchen off the living room.
Dean looks up just as the smell of maple, cinnamon and a touch of lemon hit his nose.
“There are a lot of things that don’t make sense,” Castiel says to no one in particular as he walks over and turns off the TV.
“I’ll be dancing to
fill the room, it feels like a bold choice for a dancer like Cas and in that get up. But fuck, it’s one of Dean’s favourite songs. Dean’s own audition had been to a much more thematically appropriate
Cas brain comes to a screeching halt. He looks down on to the screen and there is Ramzey on his knees, eyes beaming, his smirk evident. The angle of the video reveals the Enochian tattoo Cas has on his ribs. To anyone else, he could deny that it’s him, but Dean was there when he got it after his mother died. Still Cas is going to give denial the old college try.
