He cleared his throat and attempted to get some words out. His tongue felt like it had grown in size and his throat felt as if it was permanently closed.
“They’re good for each other,” Dean agrees, “although I am jealous -- I’m really glad they found each other.”
“Someone here wants to see you,” Dean says walking towards him, “his papa hasn’t said good morning to him.”
“Welcome to Hellian,” Meg greeted in a bored tone, “do I really have to go through the whole speech?”
The cracks begin to deepen in Dean’s resolve, so he attempts to stay silent in order to see where the conversation will lead.
“And I was sitting watching Michael and Adam dance here, waiting for the perfect opportunity to come over and speak to you.” Cas replies. “Who would’ve thought we’d end up here?”
time about his inability to eat. It was these burgers that got him through his degree, his doctorate and now, his actual job. However, there had always been a downside.
Together, they prepared a small range of finger food for the party, ready to go for when guests arrived. After they finished that, all that was left to do were the decorations, which took the two of them a grand total of ten minutes. They then stepped into the entry of the hall, surveying their work with pride.
The graduating children invaded the backyard, most of them swam in the pool while the others ran around like headless chickens. Dean spent his time talking to everyone, from the parents of his classmates to Charlie, Benny and Garth. However the whole time, Cas was glued to his side, his friend still uncomfortable with most of their classmates.
she says, “follow me. I’ll go ask Missouri if she’d like to speak to you. But I have a feeling, the answer is going to be a firm no.”
Jody’s words transported her back to the memory of sitting with Dean at the bakery. The day she was conflicted about whether or not she should run away and the story he told to convince her otherwise. The feelings, the thoughts, the reasons as to why she once wanted to run away, they weren’t there anymore. More like something of the past, something she needed to leave behind.
Dean watched as Claire’s face dropped and her gaze became dark. After quickly glaring at him, she turned around in a huff, storming out of the bakery. Dean took a moment for himself, pinching the bridge of his nose in frustration. He then took a deep breath and turned to face the customer who was waiting patiently at the counter.
“Do you know this guy?” The stranger snapped, turning his attention to Cas. “He doesn’t understand that I need him to move his car from in front of my driveway.”
Dean walks over and the roof creaks below his feet. Cas’ eyes fly open and make contact with Dean’s. Then, there it is. A small, closed mouth smile springs to his lips. The smile he reserves only for Dean.
, the three of them settled in, letting the serenity of the movie help them wind down for the night.
Dean winces at the thought of his one and only stalker ever. From day one, Dean and his team were adamant about keeping his life private, not just through what he wore on stage, but with how he promoted himself and his music. Only radio interviews, done over the phone, and
Dean can feel himself soften like a marshmallow just by staring at it on a screen and he wonders how Charlie has survived it all of these months.
The stranger had the decency to look slightly guilty and immediately closed his mouth on whatever retort he had originally planned. Cas turned his attention to his neighbour, who looked a lot calmer.
By the time they got to the halfway point of the first episode, Dean was enjoying it. He’d remembered watching Queer Eye for the Straight Guy years ago, but it hadn’t been as appealing as this. He loved the team and the way they collaborated in order to make over a seemingly normal guy. And the fact they were all openly gay? It was nice to know that society had become more and more accepting as it went on.
one, to give him that caffeine kick he needed to drive the rest of the way. It was hard to believe that soon, he would be seeing Dean,
Fortunately, he does not face an army on his way to the castle, but he does come across a few here and there. Some he is able to avoid, while others he destroys quickly and efficiently. If he were to come here almost two weeks ago, when he first left the bunker, this machinery would have got the best of him again. Now, he is prepared, even without the majority of his memories.
He wraps his legs around Cas’ waist as the man pushes him against the wall, shoving his tongue into Dean’s mouth. Dean pulls his arms tighter around Cas’ neck, panting and moaning against Cas’ lips. He can feel himself writhing with a pleasure he’s never felt before. He’s had his fair share of hook-ups, flings, and the slightest snatches of a relationship. But none of those moments could possibly compare to this. There’s something about Cas that electrifies something in him.
With shaking limbs and bile rising in his throat, Castiel jumped onto his horse. Together, they galloped away from the mountain and towards the castle, watching as dark plasm took over the island one thing at a time.
“Hey! Cas, you in there? Is Dean with you? Where the hell did you guys run off to? Get out here!” Charlie’s voice called down the hall.
“I do not want you to feel as if you are required to be with me every minute of the day. I know that my mother believes that should be your job, but I can always have another member of the royal guard with me. I do not wish for you to feel that you need to be here out of a sense of obligation.”
Cas asked incredulously, almost as if he couldn’t believe the words coming out of Dean’s mouth. “I watched you grow up from a child Dean. When I met you, you were
Their journey was quiet, as neither Dean nor Castiel had any desire to speak. While they talked regularly, together they also enjoyed the moments of silence within their friendship. It was comforting knowing they did not need to speak a word to each other, in order to strengthen their bond. It was moments like that which made Castiel think back to the time when Dean had been nothing but the enemy. It was hard to remember the times when he hated Dean, despite the fact it had lasted for several years.
“Mrs. Winnigan.” Cas said. “What if… what if she isn’t in Heaven? What if she hasn’t moved on? There’s… there’s no way Moby did so… what if something happened to the both of them?”
Dean brings his hand up to encase Cas’, savouring the warmth from the touch. He looks into Cas’ eyes, the eyes that he’s stared at hundreds of times before, now seeing them differently. That missing piece, that lingering feeling, he can make sense of it now.
He had tried dating over the past year, tried to get his mind off of his friend. However, after many failed attempts of dating he realised that it was pointless. Girls were boring, guys just downright scared him. All he wanted was Cas. His mind just fixated on Cas.
His mother parked the car and Dean practically leapt out. He jumped up and down as he impatiently waited for his mom to unbuckle Sam from his car seat. He then practically dragged her towards the building, wanting to get to his classroom as quick as he could. They walked through the courtyard and passed the turn off for the kindergarten area, making Dean feel a sense of egotistical pride he was not one of the
Benny ended up being right, considering a few weeks later, Dean had commented as such while hanging out with Cas.
Dean signed, an expression of exasperation on his face. However, Cas knew that Dean was secretly happy to see that the two of them already getting along well. Sam and Jess moved away for a moment to greet Mary and John, while Cas and Dean settled back into their seats to finish their pizza. By the time Sam and Jess wandered back over to them with slices of pizza in their hands, their little group had split up into several separate conversations. Sam used that as his opportunity to talk to Cas, asking him questions about the courses he taught. While Sam was intrigued, Cas knew that to the other two, the conversation was quite dull. Jess was the first to leave them, heading over to join Charlie’s small group. After a couple of minutes, Dean left next, pausing Cas in the middle of his signing.
While he was close to Meg, he knew he could not tell her everything.  So Castiel did not tell her about the prophecy, but rather about his troubles with his training. And he did not tell her about his true feelings for Dean, but rather that he thought Dean only stayed with him due to obligation. Once he finished telling her about the conversation he and Dean just had, he saw that Meg was staring at him as if he had grown two heads.
Dean returned to the inn before supper, looking just the same as he had before he left. Same stoic expression, observant eyes and his continued, complete silence. Castiel did not talk to him for the rest of the night, not because he felt betrayed or angry, but because he was afraid that if he spoke, those deep desires of his would all come tumbling out.
Dean and Charlie sit side-by-side on the sofa, Missouri opposite from them in her armchair. He feels the weight of her stare as she glares at the both of them. She hasn’t spoken one word the entire time, instead just letting the silence smother them, the air around them thick with tension. Charlie fidgets next to Dean, obviously not liking how silent her mother is being. Despite the confidence she showed Dean in the stables, it’s obvious that a lot of it was just false bravado. He knows she is petrified of what Missouri will say and whether she will forbid her from going.
“Put those clothes down, let’s get a good look at you.” Dean joked. Cas blinked but again, did as he was told and dropped them on the floor.
In the car, Dean was practically a constant ball of energy. He couldn’t sit still, no matter how hard he tried. Dean bopped up and down in his seat, kept leaning over and tickling Sammy, and kicked his legs into the back of his mom’s seat, making her agitated until she scolded him. Although he remained still for the rest of the car ride to avoid being in trouble, Dean couldn’t ignore the anticipation that thrummed through his veins. He was officially going to be a big kid and go to the big kid school and wear the big kid uniform. He was finally going to be grown up.
By the time first year started to end, was when Dean began to question. The more time he spent at the club, the more he realised that sexuality wasn’t just black and white. He learnt about being ace, being demi and being trans--things Dean rarely had been exposed to growing up. He began to learn more and more about the community, from guest speakers to just his friends’ own experiences. He also learnt about what it meant to be bisexual, a term that stuck out the most to Dean. Hearing it for the first time, he remembered his heart racing at the thought. He didn’t know why at the time and just tried to bury it in his mind. Yet as continued to pop up every now and then, the more and more he got exposed to it.
It reads. The first three words her soulmate spoke to her. Dean knows for a fact that she’s met her soulmate already due to the fact that it’s red. Unlike Dean’s own soulmark, written in black, a red soulmark means you and your soulmate have made contact. He also notices how her’s is openly displayed, showing every person in the room that she’s found her one. Dean’s soulmark is written along the length of his upper arm and he makes an effort to keep it hidden. He doesn’t want people knowing that he hasn’t found his soulmate -- that he is most likely destined to be alone. He also
“She says you may enter,” the girl states, almost as if she can’t believe what she is saying. She walks away from the door, glancing back at him with curiosity. He ignores her staring and instead climbs the stairs and enters the building.
“Just… just be careful with him, okay Dean? I’m going out on a limb here for you because I know you care about Castiel and… and he needs you right now. Despite the fact Michael might disagree.”
He did not want to admit that he was slowly feeling himself deteriorate, becoming nothing but an empty shell. He knew that he should not complain, considering it was he who had not accessed his powers. Yet each day had the same repetitive motion, the same tasks carried out in a monotonous cycle. He rarely saw Dean and Dean was the only social interaction he was allowed.
He looked over at Cas, who surprisingly had stayed quiet for the entire time. Usually he was a bucket of comments, saying everything that came across his mind. As he watched it, he had a frown on his face. Dean looked over at him, bemused.
Dinner conversation goes well, with both families of the grooms engaging in lively, friendly discussions. The newlyweds stay in their own little bubble of bliss, barely joining in with the rest of them, but no one at the table faults them for it. Gabriel and Castiel seem to fit quite well into the Winchester family dynamic, with Gabriel enjoying the crude jokes of the Winchester men and Castiel interesting everyone with his knowledge and stories of soulmates. At one point part way through the meal, Dean watches Gabriel laughing with John and can’t help wondering how Michael, Gabriel and Castiel are feeling. He knows that prior to Michael and Adam’s meeting, the three brothers had lost their parents. Dean knows from experience that events like those bring back painful memories. He remembers Sam’s wedding and the raw feeling of pain he felt knowing their mother wasn’t there to celebrate the day with them.
His sleep sequenced the way it usually had recently, with the nightmares continuing. For hours he heard the cries of
They are led to her building, a quaint little house made from dark spruce wood and a white tiled roof. As soon as they step inside, they are met by an old woman, sitting comfortably in the corner of the room. She has faded blue eyes and soft grey hair on top of her head. She is small and frail, but seems to possess a lot of warmth and wisdom. She smiles at them.
While Anna was friendly, charismatic and a genuinely kind person, it did bother Dean when she spoke for Cas. The man was perfectly capable of talking, of expressing his own thoughts and feelings. He knew it was just Anna taking on the role of a big sister that she’d missed out on, Dean understood considering he was an older sibling himself. Yet, it still agitated him to a certain degree.
“I know I’m sorry, I just… I uh… I really need to see Professor Novak, it’s urgent.” He gasps out through panting breaths.
After Grace is clean and dry, Cas eventually places her into her crib after reading her a book and singing her song. Dean has no idea why Cas chose to sing the theme song from
“It has been a long time since I have heard you speak.” She says with a laugh. “Longer than you may think. However, your words are unsurprising. I knew that the most likely outcome of you going into the Resurrection Bunker, is that you would return without memories.”
One year of living in his new home passed-by quicker than Cas expected it to and suddenly, it was his one year anniversary of moving in. He spent the day prepping for his second year as a professor and watching a documentary on bees. While to some that seemed like a tedious day, to Castiel -- it was practically heaven. As evening approached, he decided that he was going to celebrate by ordering Chinese.
So on the Monday morning of Spring Break, they left for St. Louis. Dean had found it ironic how Missouri had moved to the state of Missouri, and had mentioned it in their previous night’s phone call where they finalised their plans. Missouri, apparently, did not find it so amusing. It was only a 5 hour drive, including stopping for gas. It wasn’t one that bothered Dean, considering the amount of family road trips he had gone on during the summer. However for Cas, who was used to just teleporting everywhere, it was an agonising drive for him.
that he desperately wants to let slip. While he’s grateful for Pam and Lazarus Records for taking a chance on him and giving him the success he has today, he isn’t particularly fond of its founders: Alistair Smith and Zachariah Adler. He feels that between the two of them, the artists under their label aren’t seen as people but rather collectables. They’re pretty pieces for the men’s shelves — there to make them look good and bring in the dough. If it wasn’t for the loyalty Dean has to Pam, he knows he would’ve left this place long ago.
Dean had turned twenty-one just before his duty to Castiel commenced. He had explained that his celebrations at home involved singing and dancing with his fellow neighbours, an evening feast with his family, followed by a dessert made by his mother. It had been pie, a pastry with a sweet, scrumptious filling. He had received gifts from the village elders, including coins and small weaponry. Dean had told the story of his birthday with a fondness in his eye and a small smile on his lips.
“My training has concluded,” Castiel murmured, his eyes still pinned to the ground. “We can return to the castle now.”
Dean indicated to the phone in his hand. “Sorry… I was uh… having a meeting with Professor Callehassi when I had to take this phone call. The room was empty so I thought I’d just answer it in here.”
culinary school, way more then I loved my English course. Baking felt more natural and the more I learnt, the easier it became. I studied there for a few years, got my degree and then it was up to me to decide where I went from there. I headed up North and drove through Sioux Falls and I found myself staring up at a store which had gone bankrupt. I didn’t put any thought into it, just used the money my grandparents left me and bought it right there. And that’s where I’ve been ever since… here. I think I’ve only left to visit a few friends and Sam in San Francisco
By now Dean had made the Varsity Football team and he’d caught up academically, but that didn’t mean all his problems had disappeared. Just a week prior, Dean had broken up with his long-time girlfriend—Lisa.
“Yet, despite everything, I cannot hate her.” She says. “And I also did not wish for her to be dead. I have waited many years to avenge her, many years for you to return. I had a feeling you would be back Dean and I am glad that I was correct.
cause now we’re going to have to make up for lost time. We could’ve had years if either of us had the guts to say anything. So for today, let’s just spend it alone, and we can do a proper celebration once you’re officially back. It’s going to take a while for us to make up for the years we lost.”
The conversation lulls into a comfortable silence for a moment as the music slowly comes to an end. Everyone claps as Adam and Michael tumble off the dance floor, hand in hand, heading towards the bar. As the next song begins to play, Dean turns back to look at Cas.
She signed, indicating to the desserts in the refrigerated displays. Dean felt oddly too gleeful about her request.
In her armchair, Missouri was looking over a wooden bowl, not acknowledging either Castiel nor Dean’s presence. Beside her, a large book sat on a table, propped up so that the cover was in plain sight. It was covered in a black material, but Castiel was too far away to see what material it was. He knew what the book was from the moment he saw it as it was probably the most famous book on Grace Island. Anyone who lived on the island knew of this book as it was an integral part of their history, their present and their future.
“Your Highness, I am so honoured you are here,” she greeted him, “I am Mary Winchester, Dean’s mother.”
He looks back down at the control panel and is immediately overwhelmed by the amount of buttons. He has no idea how he is going to commandeer this fortress, stabilise it and return it back to normal functioning. Every button looks the same, he has no idea how to control the weaponry. He thinks about asking Castiel for help, but thinks better of it. He can’t ask him for help all the time, not when the prince right now is exerting every amount of his energy into keeping The Empty at bay.
When Cas Novak moved from Chicago to the small city of Lawrence, Kansas -- he expected to experience the things he’d seen in movies.
Sirens rang into the night. Blaring, ugly sounds. They alerted everyone that those inside the fortresses were in danger, that they needed help.
The voice startled him. He turned around swiftly to see his mother a few feet away, looking thoroughly unimpressed. Dean was already kneeling, bowing his head in respect towards Castiel’s mother.
The Winchester’s had their own little home on the edge of the town, beside a cliffside that overlooked the forest down below. To get to their house, you had to walk down through the village right to the other end, before crossing a small bridge over a minor chasm. Castiel loved the look of their house, with its cream brick walls and black tiled roof. A chimney turreted out of the top of the house, with light grey blowing out of the top. Castiel loved how ornate and cozy this house looked compared to the castle. The castle was large, empty, even
“No, Castiel, Dean will not be in trouble,” his father replied. “Sir John means well, but he is often afraid of upsetting the kingdom, particularly myself. He can be quite strict with young Dean, as he fails to realise that he is only a child and still has a lot to learn about this world.”
“Sir Dean has been in a slumber for the past one hundred years, recovering from the battle that almost cost him his life.” Charlie states. “He is here today to fulfill his duty from so long ago, to fix the fortresses and to defeat The Empty.
Charlie grins and pops the last of her muffin into her mouth. As she chews, the little bell on top of the door rings and Dean looks up, just to fall into a pool of blue.
“Now, I may not personally know the angels, especially because I think they hate me and most of my family…”
As they wandered up and down aisles, Cas couldn’t help but reflect on the fact that another year was almost gone. The year had gone by in a blur, so quickly that it was hard to process. One moment, it was February and he’d been celebrating his first Valentine’s Day with Dean, the next it was November and he’d brought Dean to have Thanksgiving with his parents. The year had been wonderful, full of lots of love and warmth. With his job going well, having a good group of friends and being in a loving, committed relationship -- Cas was leaving the year on a high.
“Oh my God… you have a soulmate?” Dean chokes out, a coldness washing through him, “you have a soulmate and you cheated on them?”
They were chatting animatedly the moment Dean Winchester walked in, a destined-to-be-quarterback type of guy, with a cheeky smile. He was new to town and almost every kid at their school was obsessed with him, to the point that he was sure to gain a seat at the popular kids table by the end of the week.
After the students left, Dean rushed to the bathroom before his next lecture. He walked in and looked around, sleuthing at toilet stalls to see if anyone was in the bathroom. When he realised the coast was clear, he took a deep breath and leant against the sink.
The entrance laid just beyond the walls of the castle, accessed through pushing a large boulder to reveal a dimly lit cave. Dean had been trained to navigate his way through those tunnels, to the point that he was required to do it without sight. If they had just been able to get inside those tunnels, then maybe that would have made it safely after all.
“I need you to attempt to use those inhuman navigational skills of yours to find our way to the main control room.”
Mary gave three slow nods, starting at Castiel with a look in her eye that he could not place. However, before he could question her on it, she changed the subject.
“Anytime,” Dean replies with a wink, “but honestly, I just knew that I couldn’t let you leave tonight without getting you on the dancefloor.”
She sways slightly to her side, the bottom of her dress swishing with the movement. The way her body moves fixates Dean and as he watches her, he can finally pinpoint why she looks so different. He realises that for some reason, the woman isn’t truly there. He can see
Dean froze for a split second, his insides churning at Claire’s words. He swallowed hard and took a small breath before shaking his head.
“No, Dean --” Cas begins to say, but Dean doesn’t let him. He’s too mad, hurt and betrayed right now to even care.
Slowly, Castiel got up from the ground and headed inside the castle. Dean followed, just a step behind him with quiet, soft movements that could barely be heard. Just inside the entrance, a water jug with two glasses sat on a table. Panting, Castiel immediately poured himself a glass, draining it with large gulps. After he had replenished his thirst, it was Dean who was the first to speak.
“So I’m assuming you are here to visit the Winchesters? Well they would be happy to see you! Now, I’m not usually fond of giving addresses to strangers but… I know for a fact that a friend of Dean’s is a friend of the family’s.”
just like most couples do. I mean, remember how much fighting you did when you were with Aaron? Or Lisa? Or Benny? Those were
Gilda flies him up in the air, above the village and the chasm that drops down next to it. Dean realises that he hates flying more than anything else in his life and after he reclaims this fortress, he never wants to do it again.
by The Pretenders plays over the venue’s speakers as everyone sits quietly and watches the newlywed couple’s first dance. According to Adam, it was the song that was playing when they met two years ago, hence making it ‘their song’. As Dean observes the new couple from afar, he can see his step-mom Kate out of the corner of his eye. She’s taking pictures from her table, the flash frequently going off in bright spurts. His father, who is sitting right next to her, continuously rolls his eyes at her obsessive actions. Dean can’t help but look at them and wonder if there’ll ever come a time when they act like that for him.
He gets into his own cab, giving them Cas’ address, which he somehow still remembers. The car ride is silent, Dean too wrapped up in his thoughts to even try and keep up a conversation. He spends the drive watching as the buildings and streets of central Lawrence disappear to the fields on the outskirts, before altogether transforming to the quaint little town of Eudora.
on DVD in his bag, a movie the boys had both decided to watch that night in preparation for the new Harry Potter movie coming out in a few months. Dean was excited, especially to be able to tell Cas about everything that had happened that week.
“Now, I hope you enjoy your night’s stay in the village. However, I must travel back to the fortress to oversee the mechanisms. I do hope to hear that the other champions have been doing their part, as well.”
“Please do. Also don’t be a strange Dean Winchester. I should hope that I’m not just waiting for you to call me about the son of night. I expect weekly phone calls from now on.”
“What?” He huffs, putting down the burger he was just about to bite into. The two exchange a glance.
It is a long journey on foot and by the time he arrives, he is exhausted, barely standing on his two legs.
Charlie’s eyes widen when she realises what she’s said, “Oh.. right. I’m not really meant to call her that in front of others, considering her role and status. But uh… Missouri is my mother. Well, no, I mean, she’s not the woman who
“Um… sorry. Forget what I said, welcome to Vale Village! Is there a particular reason you have decided to visit on your travels? Food? Clothing? A warm place to sleep?”
Missouri raises an eyebrow, “Yes, I know he is quite skilled, but I worry that he isn’t skilled enough to protect both himself and you. He doesn’t have his memories back.”
“But really, it’s like you said. I’ve had time to mourn. I only have scattered memories of her, all pretty superficial. A memory of her singing me to sleep, making me soup when I was sick, making me pie for dessert, cutting the crusts off my sandwich. I can’t remember the sound of her voice and if it wasn’t for pictures, I wouldn’t remember what she looks like. There is always going to be this… this
“Well this is getting interesting,” Amara states, “so you’re saying that not only is the human champion alive, but the young prince as well?”
So when a job came up for a lecturer at Kansas University, he didn’t hesitate to seize the opportunity.
“Because I have the entire map of Grace Island memorised,” Charlie states proudly, “I know every road, every path, every tunnel. Plus, I have an excellent sense of direction. You said it yourself, you don’t remember much. How are you expecting to find your way around?”
as his choice lullaby, but he’s not one to judge. He watches from the doorway as Cas tucks Grace in before quietly leaving the room as the baby sleeps soundly.
“We have a big journey ahead of us,” Castiel stated, changing the subject. He gave Dean a small smile, indicating his head over to the inn. “Let us go have supper. I distinctly remember you saying that your village has the best vegetable soup there is.”
When Dean did not say anything in response, Castiel took that as his opportunity to begin his descent towards the horses. However, he was only able to take a couple of steps before something stopped him. He did not have time to even blink before two hands had spun him around, forcing him to meet Dean’s gaze. His friend’s piercing green eyes stared straight at him with tinges of concern and sadness around their edges. The look he gave seemed to ask him,
“Forgot we were coming over, didn’t you?” Sam asks with a grin. Dean grimaces as he only just remembers the invitation he gave them before the ceremony.
“You know, you may be one of the best swordsmen on the island, but you are not particularly stealthy.” Castiel said, turning back to face Dean.
For the most part, Jimmy has the decency to look guilty. The air is still tense for a moment, before Jimmy relaxes, his face no longer pinched and his body no longer rigid.
He’s not to see Missouri again until the afternoon, so he journeys to the stables just outside of the village. He had passed them on his way in, but hadn’t stopped to really examine them. There are only a few horses there and a stablehand who barely gives Dean another glance. So Dean takes his time to pet each horse, soothing them. He knows he likes horses, not just because the memory told him, but because he feels it deep down. There is a love and appreciation there, something that makes his heart warm.
“My entire life, I’ve been destined to be a knight.” Dean said. “It was what my parents wanted me to be, as it was a duty that carried through my family. Each of us was a member of the royal guard. I was the youngest of all my family to not only become a part of the guard, but to be the chief knight of your protection. It was an honour, it still
Hester did not reply, instead focusing her attention on Castiel. “I am sorry, Your Highness, for my sister’s badgering. Please follow me and we shall go discuss my progress in private.”
The night ended with Dean’s lips swollen from an impromptu make out session with his roommate and him throwing up in the bathroom, with Cas standing by him and helping him through it. While the next day was awkward, Aaron and Dean both agreed in their sober state of mind that they were better off as friends. Aaron assured Dean that he wouldn’t out him to his friends and kept that promise for the rest of their time at college. While Dean could no longer hide from himself that he liked guys as well as girls, he at least could keep it a secret from his friends for a little while longer.
Dean huffs and turns in bed, switching to his other side so that he can look over at Charlie. She lays in her own bed, her body just a silhouette in the darkness.
But he did. He didn’t know whether it was because of the sight before him, or the day he'd just had or because of where they were. Maybe he was tired, he had no idea. Though he listened to the voice and it actually made sense. A flare of impulsivity bubbled inside of him and it was then he that he decided, a split second decision just like the one he had made when he was 16 years old.
to do this. The feeling is so strong that he can’t ignore it, despite having no memories as to why he feels that way in the first place.
Claire stayed for a few minutes longer, having a small discussion with Cas about his art pieces. She then made her cue to leave on a long drive back to Sioux Falls. Cas walked her to do the door, seeing her off. As she went to wave goodbye to him, she stopped when she saw his face.
And the sounds of guns blazing. He was grateful when he was pulled out of his sleep in the middle of the night, panting heavily from the continuous running he did in his sleep. However when he saw the figure at the end of his bed, he began to wonder whether he was better off staying asleep.
fix things? All of Claire’s insecurities began to come rifling up as a moment of clarity struck her. The urge to run filled her and she went to turn and go bolting down the stairs. Yet the sound of lock turning, stopped her in her tracks.
“I have tried everything I can. Mother,” Castiel said, frustration biting in his tone, “I will continue to try but I can also be useful here. I know all the lore, I remember everything Father taught me. I can help with the Nephilims, I can help with all the research if you let --”
“I’m guessing you must be hungry, but I have no idea what you eat for breakfast,” Dean tells her. “I’m hoping you won’t be too upset if we just stay here for a moment, give your dad some time to rest.”
So Cas did as he was told and wandered around in the living room, looking at the various pictures and items Dean had. He saw pictures of him with his family, graduation pictures from school, pictures of him with his car, which he now knew was a 1967 Chevrolet Impala that Dean called ‘Baby’. He glanced over everything with a soft fondness, until he laid eyes on one of the photographs by the staircase.
“We’ll be there in a minute, Charlie.” Dean says. The girl nods and scurries away again, most likely to make sure every little detail is perfect.
Dean can't believe that the battle that he's been waiting for, the whole land has been waiting for and the one that he nearly died for is finally happening. Mostly, he can't believe how anti-climatic it has all become.
A week passed and after many failed attempts of reconciliation, Dean gave up. He spent his time sitting by the living room window with a book, watching the Shurley house for any sign of movement. For the most part, all he saw was Michael leave for work in the mornings. Sometimes he’d see Gabriel leave as well, but at those points he hid away from the window, afraid of what Cas’ older brother would do to him. Though there was never sign of Cas, no matter how many sorry cards and letters Dean stuck in the mailbox.
He watches the video and realises what Charlie meant all along. Despite being on the receiving end of it, Dean was never able to truly see how Cas looked at him. He stared at him with a gaze full of adoration, full of warmth, full of
When college ended and both Dean and Charlie moved back home, it was safe to say that everyone thought Cas would stay and work in Lawrence. Being an accountant, there were a multitude of places he could work. He’d even seen countless advertisements at the time, all looking for a full-time or part-time accountant within the Lawrence district. Yet, he surprised everyone when he announced that he had taken a job in Denver, a good five-hundred miles from home.
Yet they were waiting for them, there were at least fifty there. The Nephilim stood tall and proud, like an army of soldiers. The blue light that Castiel had once observed shine from their eyes, was now deep and pure black. Castiel’s theory had been proven correct -- The Empty had taken them too.
than I do, that patience is the strongest virtue. That magic is powerful stuff, it’s going to take some time to grab hold.”
Plenty of time turned into fifteen years. Now here he was, at thirty-three years old, watching his youngest brother on his wedding day. He glances away from his parents and over to the other table where his brother Sam sits, his soulmate Jess right beside him. They got married three years ago but they’d met long before that, back when Sam was only eighteen. Dean remembers the sucker punch he felt when he realised that Sam had met his soulmate only a couple of months after receiving his mark. He’d met her two days into his first week at college, the two of them running into each other at a frat party. Again, Dean is happy for his brother, obviously. Jess is awesome and the two of them are amazing together. But it still doesn’t ease the bitter sting that both of his brothers are happily married to their soulmates, and he continues to be alone.
Castiel leads him through as normal, telling him where to go. However, as he nears the main control room, something changes.
“I cherish our time too,” Dean said. “I love being your knight and I also enjoy being your friend. How could you doubt that?”
The Queen did not answer at first, instead she looked down at his chest, indicating her head towards it.
“I assure you Dean, there was nothing for you to be worried about.” Bobby says. “That sword yours for as long as you shall live.”
“Damn right you should be,” Meg replied, stuffing her hands into the pockets of her champion’s jacket. Castiel would forever be confused as to why Meg chose a jacket for her champion clothing. She lived in the
“If you confess your love for someone on one,” Charlie says, “then legend says, you will be with that person for the rest of your life.”
neighbour was probably the most attractive man that Castiel had ever stumbled across. Being a gay man, he wasn’t exactly shy in looking at guys and admiring them from afar. He wasn’t the most confident type and was a terrible flirter, but he had enough years of looking at guys that he knew what he thought of as attractive. He’d met plenty of guys that fell into the attractive category, but
did his new neighbor jump to the top of the list. Defined cheekbones, tousled hair and a five o’clock shadow, Cas had only caught a brief glimpse of him the other day and was ready to fall to his knees and swoon.
They both give a quick glance to their eldest, who is happily munching on her eggs and toast, oblivious to the rest of the world.
They both took a moment to stare at each other, the memories of the night before flashing in Cas’ mind. Their bare, flushed skin pressed tightly together, the soft whimpers of Dean in his ear, the overwhelming pleasure ---
Mary gazed at him in awe, her mouth slightly parted. Castiel pursed his lips, a slight flush on his cheeks as he recounted the words he spoke, the bashful, love-sickening words that he has kept pent up in his mind for so long. Mary quietly bowed her head, a sign of respect as she arose from her seat, taking her cup over to the water basin. She washed it, before drying it with a cloth. He watched as she stared out the window, to the small clearing behind the Winchester’s home. While he could not see from where he was sitting, he presumed that Dean was out there with John.
Which was why a few months into the semester, it wasn’t unusual for Aaron to invite him out. Dean, sick of his current assignment, agreed to go and began to get ready. When his roommate left, Dean remembered asking Cas if he wanted to come. Cas of course, did not.
Dean blinked, the words at first not registering. At first, he felt as if he was hallucinating. That his brain had somehow made him think that the fantasy in his head was playing out in real life. He blinked again and he felt his heart begin to speed up in his chest. Cas was still looking at him, a cautious expression in his eyes. Did that just happen? Did… Cas actually just say that? By the time Dean blinked for a third time, the realisation had finally dawned upon him.
Dean was silent for a moment and was just staring at Cas with startled eyes. At first, Cas had been worried that Dean was going to reject the idea outright. Instead, Cas was tackled backwards into the couch as warm lips met his.
In the Winchester household, the celebrations mainly focused on the commercial aspect. There were Christmas soundtracks playing in their house all December long, Christmas decorations hung up on every wall and furniture from the first day of November. A huge Christmas tree in front of the living room window, decorated poorly in cheap baubles and holiday decorations Sam and Dean made through their childhood. It wasn’t anything special, but the Winchester family definitely focused a great amount on festivities.
be interested in is super invasive, dude. I am happy to keep this a secret from Cas if you promise you won’t intervene again. I get you’re protective, I
A selfish part of Cas briefly wished they could have cancelled on their family and friends and just rung in the new year that way.
When Dean and his friends headed out to the playground for recess, Dean instantaneously noticed his neighbour was sitting alone to eat his food.
“I not only wanted to say my congratulations but that I’m proud of you Dean. You have always been like a younger brother to me as well, being so close with Cas your whole lives. I’ve watched you grow up, from an energetic little boy who was dead set on being best friends with my little brother—to an intelligent man who is kind, sincere and is going to do amazing things in your lifetime. I’m honored I’ve been able to be a part of your life and watch you grow up and… I can’t wait to see where life takes you.”
As he exited the street, he waited until Dean was no longer in the rearview mirror, before he let himself cry.
Dean had nothing against the LGBT community as he was raised to be accepting of anyone. His mom made sure that her boys respected
Grace eats the scoop with no hassle, happily munching on it. As Cas goes to get another spoonful, Dean clears his throat.
“Halloween is a great holiday for all. Kids enjoy it, teens enjoy it, adults enjoy it. There aren’t many holidays where all ages can take pleasure out of it.”
She walks forward so that she is just a step in front of him and places her hand to his forehead. Suddenly, the pain Dean had felt from the fight disappears and his body feels brand new again, as if he has had the best sleep of his life. Well, the best sleep without a loss of memories.
He sighed and forced on his most enthusiastic customer smile. He then turned to them, the greeting on the tip of his tongue. That was until he noticed who exactly was standing in line.
Missouri lead them both inside and offered Dean a glass of lemonade. At the mention of her homemade lemonade, Dean could feel his inner kid bounce with joy. He’d always loved Missouri’s lemonade as a kid--in fact, he used to practically race to Missouri’s from school in order to have it. He was disappointed as he took his first sip of the lemonade in 20 years. It tasted the exact same and brought back some fond childhood memories.
“Shut up.” Cas not only snapped but signed as well. Dean stopped moving, letting his hands drop to his sides. He met Cas’ gaze and saw the hurt behind his features. His eyes were swirling with so many unsaid words, with so many years of resentment and longing. His eyes mirrored Dean in the way that they had both grieved for each other, in the way that they both wished they could go back in time to that one moment and change it all.
He didn’t speak until Dean was almost seven. It was during Dean’s fifth viewing of Toy Story, when Cas made a comment about Buzz Lightyear being ‘a dumbass.’ Dean had giggled and Cas had turned his gaze to him, surprised. Dean realised that Cas was funny and found himself chatting to him throughout the course of the movie, out of his mother’s earshot.
Castiel groaned quietly and, begrudgingly, pulled himself from Dean’s arms. If it were not for his duty to the kingdom and prophecy, he would have stayed there with Dean. He would have faced the wrath of his mother and the conflict within the kingdom, just to spend some more time in bed with the man he loved more than anything. Yet, he knew lives were at stake, and it was important that he attempted to save them.
For the second time in a minute, Dean couldn’t help pause as his brain registered the language. He was unsure as to why this girl was asking who he was and why she knew to use sign language with him. Though, it didn’t take him long for his brain to remember the words of his long-time friend, Jody Mills.
“Yeah, my uh… wife and our child,” Dean says, deciding to go for the half-truth. While he wouldn’t exactly be opposed to admitting his sexuality to a stranger, he doesn’t exactly want to out Cas as one of the men who carries the gene. With it being so rare, he figured that it wouldn’t be fair to focus a whole spectacle over it.
-- a different mother. Her and my dad were soulmates. They met in ‘72 at the Lawrence cinema, my mom was leaving a screening of
Missouri huffed a small laugh, “Yourself and the prince are not the only ones who have not aged. Castiel’s magic keeps him alive, same with the magic that brought you back to life. For me, it is the magic of my ancestors. I cannot age until the prophecy is fulfilled. Thus, I have stayed like this for the past a hundred years, watching the only family and friends I knew pass on and watching the babies I once saw born, become adults.”
Despite being tired, Dean picked up what Claire signed right on the first go. He realised the more time he spent with Claire, the more natural sign language was becoming for him again.
Dean brought his other hand in to grip onto Cas’ other shoulder. He couldn’t believe he was touching him, that they were able to have actual physical contact. It wasn’t the same as touching another human, due to the temperature and the semi-permanence of it. He didn’t feel as solid as another person, more like jello. Yet, it was still something.
Mary carefully grabbed it with a cloth, bringing it over to the dining table. She gestured for Castiel to sit as she began to pour them both a cup of tea. Castiel sat and patiently waited.
They grab their horses from the stable and Dean is obviously quick to saddle up Baby, whereas Charlie goes for a reddish-brown horse called Hermione.
Dean was in no mood for it, the events of the day leaving him in a sour mood. He had his back turned to the door but he assumed it was Claire—she was the only one who would dare to come into his store after closing.
Missouri smiled, “The fact that you were able to make your way here, unharmed, is just a sign that you aren’t as incapable as you think you are. However, I can understand your worry, considering you have only just awoken. No one, not even Prince Castiel, expects you to defeat The Empty today, or even tomorrow. In fact, you have another duty to do first, one that will not only assist you, but will help fix the devastation The Empty caused.”
However, she found Cas’ older brother through Facebook. The profile picture was of a middle aged man taking a selfie with a gorgeous woman, the both of them smiling brightly at the camera. Upon clicking on the photo, Claire was able to see that the woman was tagged as Duma—which she knew about from the stories.
“Yeah, you’re mad he kept it from you, because you believe he saw you and decided you weren’t it for him, which we all know isn’t the case.” Sam adds on.
He slammed the front door shut behind him and stormed to his room, shutting his bedroom door as well. He fell onto his bed with his arms crossed over his chest. With a grunt, he swallowed the surfacing tears down and closed his eyes, trying his best to sleep through the fear and worry.
Mary’s eyes watered at his words and her lower lip trembled. However, she said nothing in reply. So, Castiel continued on.
He watched as the man knelt down to Dean’s eye level, chastising him in quiet but harsh tones. Castiel spotted his father waiting by the castle’s entrance and began to walk over to him, not before catching Dean’s reason for being in the gardens.
“He says that I am older than you by a few months, but you have already learned how to read big books. I have trouble reading books, the words make my eyes hurt.”
Dean looked over as Sir John hurried over in large strides. His eyebrows were furrowed and his nostrils flared. Sir John was not happy.
“It’s not that simple! I just… look, I like Cas. And he’s the only good friend I’ve had, even after just two weeks together. I trusted him, because… he saw this side of me that I’ve never really shown anyone before. He… got me. You know? We just clicked. And that scared me, so I spent two weeks pretending I didn’t think he was hot, or that I had this attraction to him… all up until that last night. And then when I left him, even though we both knew I had to leave for work, I
They put the bags into the trunk and when Cas returned from putting the cart in the bay, he saw Dean hadn’t gone into the car yet. He put his hands into two fists, moving one in a circular motion on top of the other.
The bus arrived and Dean hopped on. He looked behind him to try see Cas, only to see that the ghost had disappeared. With a sigh, Dean sunk into his seat, closed his eyes and embraced the silence. He knew Cas was aching for his friend, the one now passed on. He felt bad for Cas, losing a companion – someone that he could talk to. However, Dean knew that in the spirit world, that was the way things were run. Spirits never really lasted on Earth.  They all disappear in the end, one way or another. Once they’ve found peace, they move on and it’s an end to an endless existence.
“It is.” Dean responded, hesitantly sinking into the chair across from Claire. “However, most of my fond memories of apple pie were from when it was Summer back home.”
However, his death happened before he even had time to tell his mom. It was in the beginning months of Sophomore year on a Sunday afternoon that Dean got the call. It was from Charlie, who had obviously been crying due to the hoarseness of her voice. She was quick to reveal the news that their friend had been killed in a hit and run incident. That he was found dead on the scene from head trauma. That they were unable to revive him.
He watches as Hester’s face changes, into an expression that Dean feels must have never formed on her face before. It’s an expression of remorse. Of
They hug for what could be mere seconds, or minutes, maybe even hours. However, eventually, Cas leans back, so that they’re face-to-face. Cas brings his hands up to Dean’s face, cupping his cheeks. His blue eyes are teary, a swarm of emotions flooding through them. He smiles brightly.
A couple of minutes later, he sees the building up ahead. The large science and history office building looming ahead of him. He doesn’t slow down however, only glancing at his watch to see that it’s one minute until five o’clock.
Over the next week, while Dean and Cas worked on getting to know each other in a different light, more spirits began to disappear. Including Kevin.
Claire could not that Cas had become awkward around the word friend and almost seemed to be puzzled as to why this teenager was friends with a thirty-one-year-old.
“Claire I want to meet my friends, I think I’ve told you a bit about them. This is Benny, Garth and Charlie. Guys, this is the girl who lets me rattle onto her for about an hour each week—Claire.”
she says, exasperated, “you’ve convinced me. I’ll take you up there tomorrow. But this trip is dangerous and there are plenty of monster camps along the way. If you’re prepared to fight them, I’ll lead the way.”
“Good evening traveller, did you have a safe trip?” She asks, her voice both bubbly, yet warm and inviting.
They arrived at the village during the middle of the day, being warmly greeted by the faeries who lived there. They were taken to the inn to place down their things and freshen up. Castiel quickly washed his face, trying to make himself feel more awake after the tiring journey. Dean, on the other hand, rested on his bed for a couple of minutes. Castiel felt compelled to watch him for a moment, noticing how tranquil Dean looked when he allowed himself to relax. Castiel only ever saw Dean at ease when they were alone and there was no danger nearby. Usually, Dean was very stoic and on guard, his piercing eyes focused on anything that may have posed a threat.
“I am trying Mother, you must see that I have been trying for so long,” Castiel whispered, though it came out almost like a whimper, “I have been praying every morning and every evening, I travelled to one of the pools of fate --”
He thinks about how much fun he had today, and how for the first time in a long while, he felt like he actually belonged somewhere. His thoughts are racing as he thinks back to the blissful morning he spent with Cas, and the words he spoke to Grace on the rocking chair. He thinks of Charlie’s words.
Sir John seemed pleased at the answer, thanking Castiel before giving another bow and heading back over to the other two.
Rather than a big explosion, his memories flood in like a waterfall. Trickling down in succession, from his earliest memories to his most recent. He remembers himself as a child, playing among the fields of Vale, or on the brick paths of the kingdom’s village. He remembers himself as an adolescent, waking up at dawn with his father to practice his sword wielding skills and combat training. He remembers meeting Cas again for the first time since they were children and the cold shoulder the prince gave him and the way his heart fell every time the prince couldn’t bear his presence.. And he remembers everything after that, remembers all the time they spent together. However, he also remembers everything after that, when they became each other’s closest companions. He remembers the good days and the bad days. The ups and downs. The puzzle pieces slowly begin to slot themselves back into Dean’s brain, as the memories reinsert themselves into his mind.
Cas frowned at the notifications, curious as to why Dean would call him at that time. It was late, being one in the morning and it was even later for Dean, who was an hour ahead. He wondered if maybe Dean had forgotten that he wasn’t supposed to call Cas that night, or maybe it was just a drunken dial? Cas was who Dean regularly called when drunk, spouting muffled and slurred sentences about love and honesty and friendship before either passing out in the street, or being rescued by Cas. Most of the time, Cas was far too concerned with helping Dean than to pay attention to what he was actually saying.
It’s a large tub, filled with just the slightest bit of water. The water sparkles with an array of colours, twinkling under the soft, minimal light that the room has provided. For a moment, Dean is mesmerised, watching the water. In his mind, he can faintly remember what water looks like. What it looks like in a glass, what it looks like as it twinkles under sunlight. He has no idea why he remembers these things, nor any memories pertaining to water, but for some reason, he understands what water is.
“Yes,” Charlie replies, although both Dean and her know that it’s Dean who is the knight in question.
Cas stands before him, his blue eyes wide as he realises who is on his front door step. He looks the same as Dean remembers him, with the exception of the added scruff on his jaw, and the fact that he looks
Dean thinks for a moment. He can’t remember much about his previous life and his memories aren’t particularly interesting. However, there is something he hasn’t revealed, something that has been bothering him for quite a while.
Later that evening, Dean watched as Michael left the house. Every Friday night was the nights that Dean spent over at the Shurley’s. It was how he knew that every Friday night, Michael had to attend business dinners for his firm. He watched as Michael drove away towards the city, leaving the gateway to Cas wide open. After waiting a few minutes to make sure Michael had well and truly left—Dean prepared to strike.
Cas nodded softly on Dean’s chest, the sleep beginning to rise from where it had been hiding. However, before he could drift off, he had to speak one last thought.
Dean sighs. “Look Pamela, that reminds me of why I called. As my manager, you should probably know that I’m not coming back.”
he was lying. Dean had known Michael most of his life and despite the amount of times the older man had attempted to lie to him, Dean always knew when he was. It was how he had discovered that Santa wasn’t real.
The tradition started back in 6th grade and ended up continuing into their college years. However, with Charlie attending college in Michigan. Most of the time it ended up being just Cas and Dean, lounging in Cas’ basement, watching old movies on a crappy, second-hand television. Sometimes, they wouldn’t even watch movies, but just stay up for hours talking. Talking to Dean was effortless for Cas, which was surprising since he was a person who found talking to people utterly exhausting. At the time, Dean knew everything about him, from his great-aunt’s name to what he had for breakfast the day before. Their lives were entwined, a friendship formed over so many years, that they were essentially family.
Having a ghost as a best friend has its perks: 1, they’re always there to lend a hand. 2, they have life experience that can tend to be quite helpful and 3, they have useful skills (such as sneaking is into classrooms and finding test answers). Plus, they have no one to tell your secrets to. However, there are some downsides that Dean discovered. 1, There was no privacy. Dean found himself multiple times begging Cas to leave the room so that he could just have an
“You look…. Different.” He stated, with a pause. He stared at Cas for a little longer before his face brightened with a grin. “I like it.”
Castiel slowly staggered to his feet once Dean and the knights had faded away. With a sigh, he leant down and grabbed the sword.
“Cas… what happened this morning… we can talk about it later. I’m just… I’m just so glad you’re here. I thought something happened to you.”
“Dean… I worry… are you happy with your job? Do you actually want to be here? I cannot help but wonder if you would prefer to live a normal, civilian life. If you had the option to finish your duties, would you take it?”
“All thanks to you, I haven’t had that much fun with someone in years.” Dean says, his voice slurring slightly,
want you. Before I knew we were soulmates, I had hoped, as soon as you said hello. I was sad when I thought that you weren’t mine, and the whole night, I couldn’t help but feel how connected we were. I’d never met anyone like you man, we just clicked. I’ve never clicked like that with anyone,
“Dean!” Castiel screamed, running out from the clearing. Dean turned to look at him, but Castiel could barely even see his eyes.
With everyone now gone, the house once again has fallen into silence. Grace is napping, Cas is doing the dishes and Dean is cleaning up the wrapping paper in the living room. He is mindlessly completing the task at first, until he fully takes notice of the abundance of gifts that Grace’s family and friends spoiled her with. As he pauses to look, Cas’ words from the night before drift into his head.
The second was his grandad’s watch, the one he had worn since the fifth grade. Before his grandad died, he had gifted it to him at a family dinner as a late birthday present. It wasn’t a fancy watch by any means, nothing like the shiny gold Rolexes seen in commercials. It was a simple analogue watch with a brown leather strap. Ever since it was gifted to him, he’d worn it almost everyday and made sure to take very special care of it. Whenever he looked at it, it would remind him of his grandad and it helped motivate him to continue on, push through whatever turmoil he was facing. He liked to think that he was making his grandad proud.
Castiel looked out the window, wanting to groan at just how early it was. It was not even dawn yet, the sky still a dark, brooding grey. Dean must have noticed Castiel’s distaste, as he began to chuckle.
“I’m so sorry,” Cas utters out, “I shouldn’t have lied to you. I didn’t mean to hurt you by my actions, I swear. Can… Can we just go to the car and head back to your apartment, or mine? Just to talk --”
The omens caused the kingdom to be on high alert. While Castiel still did his daily combat training with Dean, the knight also spent some time during the day working with the royal guard. Some of his skills were believed to be one-of-a-kind and Castiel’s mother wanted all the royal soldiers to be as proficient as they could. It meant that Castiel spent most days in his study, considering that Dean was elsewhere and his mother did not want him to travel alone. He spent countless hours pouring through the lore and his journals, as well as observing the Nephilims from the balcony.
“So, do I get an answer?” Dean asks with a grin. Cas is up in a heartbeat, racing towards him and connecting their lips. Dean immediately leans into the kiss, pulling Cas as close to his body as he can. The kiss isn’t heated or fast-paced, it’s slow and soft. Dean doesn’t think he will ever get tired of kissing Cas, no matter how many years they share together.
By 11:30, Claire was tired and was in search for a place to grab some lunch. She had parked her car and was strolling through the town, taking in the place Dean had once used to live. Upon heading for the busy centre again, she came across a large orange building which stood out like a store thumb. Confused, she headed a bit closer until the large sign came into view, showing that the building was actually the public library.
Time passed slowly and each chant made Castiel grow less and less hopeful. He attempted everything that he had used in training; he cleared his head, he held his amulet, he focused his energy towards the statue, he enunciated every chant and had memorised them precisely. Every technique he knew he utilised, trying desperately hard to summon the power so that he would no longer have to face the disappointment of his mother. But as time went one, he felt nothing. There was no tingling under his skin or unique sensation. He just felt exhausted, sad and frustrated. Why would this power not emerge? What was he doing wrong?
Cas looked over at him and their eyes met. Dean could see the question in Cas’ gaze, could see that he was wanting clarification that the note meant what he thought it meant. Dean nodded.
He stared into Dean’s dimly lit eyes and sighed. He knew there was no way that Dean would relent and let him wordlessly escape. Dean was demanding answers and Castiel knew he had to give them.
Kevin shrugged. “Same as usual. Aced one of the chemistry quizzes today. How about you? How’s things with the gang?”
Cas couldn’t believe that after a full year, he was finally having the “meet-your-neighbour” conversation, the one he could’ve had a year ago, if he had paid more attention. Looking at Dean, he decided not to tell him about his slight hiccup a year ago. At least, not now. Instead, he was going to offer a peace offering.
seared into his brain. Just as the person answered, Dean turned to look at Cas and immediately froze. His friend had his back turned to him… his
Claire went inside and followed Michael into the living room. The living room was neat and pristine. It featured a large white leather couch and two accompanying living chairs, all overlooking a large plasma screen perched on top of a fireplace. On the ledge of the fireplace, sat family pictures. Most of them featured Michael and five other people, which Claire assumed were his siblings. Claire wanted to take a good look at the pictures, see if she could get an idea of what Cas looked like. However, Michael had let her in despite his reluctance to do so. She didn’t want to push her luck.
Dean attempted to hold back a laugh as Anna whispered the last part. However, it proved futile as warm, throaty chuckles began to bubble over. The glare Anna sent him was murderous.
He stepped inside further, hearing the echo of his movement against the silent walls. At first, he figured that maybe the place was closed and that there was a last minute change of venue. He felt annoyed that he had come all this way and got his phone out to send an angry text to his best friend… which was when he heard the music.
“Well, I am glad to hear that the fortress is running smoothly. I am happy that the journey here brought positive news.”
A knotted feeling appeared in Dean’s chest, one that appeared every time he thought of Cas this way. So he turned away from his friend and went over to mini fridge they had in their dorm. They were running low on supplies, most of their soda and other snacks gone throughout their exam preparation. Plus, their fridge was quite small—it wasn’t as if they could put a whole lot in there.
“Yeah I got the invite about a month ago.” Dean said with a small laugh. “Okay, what cake are you thinking?”
He signed, fingerspelling his name before adding the sign name his parents gave him. It was the sign for cat, but with the starting hand position as a ‘C’. The man grinned.
“I went away for a few months.” Dean explained. “I dropped out of college, ditched my friends, pretty much left all of my things behind. I hopped in my Impala and drove for miles and miles, using whatever cash I had left for gas. I was so lost and confused, but I felt guilty most of all. I kept remembering Cas’ face… it was like on repeat in my head. It’s why in the end I knew it was best that I had to go back in see him.”
“Left alone?” Dean cut her off. Duma looked hesitant and Dean sighed. “Sorry ma’am, it’s just… I’m worried about Cas okay? He’s my best friend and I know something is wrong with him. I just… I need to see him.”
“Where’s Cas?” Dean immediately asked, getting straight to the point. Although he knew it was quite rude how he was speaking to Michael, his concern for his best friend’s wellbeing was more important to him at that point.
Inias leads him to the largest building in the town, one that stands out from the rest in its regality. It has marble pillars and gold tiling and is pristine from head to toe. It is much fancier than anything Vale Village had to offer and it even feels out of place in this town.
Fortunately, no one gives him a second glance and he realises that with how long it has been, anyone who probably remembered him has most likely died.
“I suppose so. I mean, there are definitely many interpretations of Perseus and Andromeda. Some bizarre, others fascinating. Despite what you may think, it isn’t my favourite Greek mythology story but… it has a special sentiment to me.”
He knows he should go through the castle, try and find The Empty in there. However, he finds it much easier to bring him there insead.
Castiel puts all his weight on one arm and brings his other hand up to Dean’s face. His thumb traces along Dean’s cheekbone, right below his eye.
“He’s so stupidly co-dependent with the Deafie. It’s almost as if Shurley’s dumbass can’t function without Winchester doing everything for him.” Alastair Smith chimed in.
Dean gave the slightest nod of his head as he didn’t know how subtly he could indicate to Kevin that he would talk to him later. It was Cas who had spoken for him, letting Kevin know to meet them outside in five minutes. Once the funeral was over, Dean and Cas split from the group as
His current Friday night centered around him being sat in front of his computer, a cold, half-eaten bowl of ramen beside him. It’s how he spent most of his Friday nights recently, alone in his apartment, checking emails. Despite having lived in Denver for almost a full-year, he had never really made any friends. Sure, he had co-workers who he had friendly chats to once in a while or the occasional warm greeting to a neighbour, but
Dean did not consider Castiel a friend. For while he was once Castiel’s burden, somehow, Castiel had turned into his.
The word sacrifice made Castiel’s stomach churn. He thought about Dean and he thought about Mary’s words. His brain procured an image, a vile nightmare where he saw the life fade from his friend’s eyes. Those beautiful green eyes of his becoming cold and dim. The thought constricted him, began to suffocate him, clouded his mind with feelings of fear and anxiety.
Dean looked hesitant after stating his suggestion, worry pooling behind his eyes. Castiel knew it was a weird thing to suggest to a Prince, especially by the Prince’s own knight. Dean could not have known that Castiel practically wanted to leap into Dean’s arms -- he could not have known how irrevocably in love Castiel was with him. To Dean, the suggestion broke the social boundaries and royal etiquette. To Castiel, the suggestion was everything he wanted and more.
It was a momentous occasion for the island people. The past year had been spent preparing for this day. Civilians had spent months constructing the fortresses for battle, with highly advanced weaponry that could weaken the entity. Four individuals from across the nation trained to use this weaponry, ready to subsequently defeat the monstrosity. They weakened him, allowing the loyal knight to do the rest, slicing and dicing until the monster was just about ready to accept defeat. That was when the prince came in, using his light to banish The Empty back to where he belonged.
“I’m right here, Dean,” a voice says, startling him. He stands up quickly, looking over at Cas who is leaning against the doorway. He’s wearing a simple grey shirt and sweatpants, and his hair is in a disarray, tufts of hair spiking up all over the place. However, what Dean notices most is the look on Cas’ face. His eyes are soft, and there’s a warm smile spreading over his lips. Dean realises he must’ve heard the conversation, and immediately he feels his cheeks flush a bright red.
What he failed to realise at the time was that over the next eight years, he was going to have to wait a lot longer to see his best friend again.
He couldn’t describe the thoughts and feelings running through his mind. If he tried, he knows they would just end up as an indecipherable babble. He’s nervous, but excited. Hesitant, but impatient. Part of him wants to march up to the front door right that second, the other wonders if it’s too late to turn back around.
He immediately went into the fridge, pulling out the first drink he could find—a carton of milk. He rummaged through his cupboards for a glass, since he hated drinking out of the carton itself. As he poured the milk, he looked over at the other side of the counter and noticed the unopened packet of cookies. It was a small Christmas present from his employee Kevin, the high school student too broke to afford anything lavish. They were just plain sugar cookies, but Dean was eagerly reaching for them.
The longing feeling is beginning to intensify the more he recovers his memories, and the closer they get to the end.
sign appeared in his headlights, reminding him that he was officially back in the state he grew up in. Despite living in Lawrence almost all his life, he hadn’t been born there. He was born in Pontiac, a small town in Illinois. He moved to Lawrence at four years old, just a month after Dean and his family had moved away. Sometimes, Castiel found it strange that Dean had been born in Lawrence and that the two of them might have met sooner, if the events of their lives had been different.
Cas nodded with a small smile on his face. He held up his hand so Dean could see it, forming it into the sign for ‘I love you’. Dean’s eyes brightened, before he did the same with his own. Cas reached out and rubbed his thumb along Dean’s cheekbone, before cupping Dean’s cheek in his palm. Dean melted into the touch and for a moment, they laid like that, staring at each other with fond gazes. Cas appreciated these private moments with Dean, when the rest of the world faded away leaving nothing but the two of them. They had been so far and few in the recent months, with Dean getting promoted and Cas taking on an extra class. Between both their work schedules, they had spent most of their nights passing out together on the sofa rather than having sweet, tender moments.
Cas only worked days, while the manager Benny worked nights. This was partly due to the fact that Cas was young, and the more dodgy types would show up during the later hours. It was also because Benny was an Army veteran, and wasn’t the type to take shit from nobody. Nobody believed he was a veteran, due to the fact he was only about twenty-six, but after an explosion caused shrapnel to be embedded into his leg, he was officially discharged as he could no longer work with his injury.
That morning, Cas awoke to a soft, feathery sensation on his jaw. In fact, most mornings he awoke to this sensation, to the point that he recognised what the feeling was even in his sleep-induced haze. He took a moment to blink his eyes awake, taking in the soft morning light of his bedroom. On the left side of his body, there was the weight of a warm body and the feeling of soft gushes of air on his neck every few seconds. Cas couldn’t help but sigh in contentment, knowing that there was no better way to wake up than this.
So it was definitely shocking that Cas had been invited to the party of one of the most popular girls in the school.
“Sorry, these emails are getting tedious,” she tells him, pausing her typing and picking up her empty mug. “I’m gonna go grab some more joe, you okay here?”
Castiel’s plans to travel fell through pretty quickly, when he realised that his land really needed a leader during the aftermath. Additionally, he wanted to contribute with the rebuilding and clean up as much as possible. So while himself and Dean stayed behind to look after the land, Charlie travelled in their stead. However, she did not go alone, as she had begun a relationship with Gilda, a faery from the Aether. Together, they did the royal duty of travelling for a year, visiting the nearby lands and meeting their royalty. A few members of these royal families would be there today, ready to meet Castiel and his husband, Prince Dean. A title he was given upon his marital union with the king.
Meg’s theory had been correct, that The Empty took from parts of itself to create the four monsters in the fortresses. When Dean destroyed each of them, it destroyed a part of The Empty, thus making him weaker. The entity has been trapped, festering in the castle for over a hundred years. As Dean battles it, he notices how sluggish it is and how its body feels soft like a sponge.
“Who told you?” He asked Cas, knowing full well that his friend couldn’t hear him. The blue eyed man sent him a look of bewilderment. He raised his hands to ask, but Dean was too caught in his own cycle of fear that he couldn’t acknowledge him.
“Pamela—” He interrupts her, and watches as his friend looks over at him, concerned. “Casteel... or did you mean,
Disney World was big… well, big was an understatement. They only made it through half the park by the time the sun had begun to descend and it was time to head back to main street for the fireworks. As they strolled back to the front of the park, side by side, Dean couldn’t help but think about how Sam was right. It had been a lot of fun.
Cas was standing in the middle of the living room, with a little store bought cupcake on a plate in his hands.
At that point, Dean thought he was done and didn’t need to help no more. He was about to leave to go do a grocery shop when Cas had stopped him, a pleading look in his eye.
Cas had first proposed the idea of moving in together when they were six months into their relationship.
He was out in the kingdom’s gardens at the time. They were located in the northern area of the castle, just beyond the western courtyard and the eastern docks. Two knights stood on guard nearby, watching as the little prince wandered around examining bees. He had been absorbed in watching the way they moved and how they flew from flower to flower, that he had not noticed the other boy creep up on him.
Anna promised them that the horses would be safe just outside the fortress. So when they unmounted, Dean carefully tied their bridles to a nearby tree. The fortress, just like all of them, was large and daunting. It was the width of two houses and the height of three. It was a dark grey in colour, almost to the point of being black, with no windows in sight. Instead there was just a door, bolted shut, which one could only access by the use of a code. This, along with the nephilims, was technology that Castiel could not help but marvel at. He knew why his ancestors hid these inventions, only to be found when it was time for the prophecy to begin. Who knows how far advanced their technology would be now? How powerful and destructive it may be?
Dean looked over at his backpack, which he knew had homework he needed to do over the weekend. There was his spelling list, his math sums and the chapter he needed to read for his literacy assessment. He debated getting a start on them, going downstairs to get his mom to help him. However, he also noticed the small novel he was reading, sitting on his bedside table. After weighing the two options, the novel won.
Two minutes pass before either of them say anything further. All they can hear is the soft babbling of Grace, and the sound of sloshing water from the sink. In the end, it’s Dean who speaks first.
Turns out she is right, because as they continue along, Dean suddenly notices something in the distance.
“Yes,” Charlie sighs, “the other girls didn’t want to be around me after I revealed that. Not like I actually like any of them, considering how mean and judgemental they are. Missouri supports me, of course, she actually already knew before I even said anything to her. But… but it’s part of the reason why I found life much calmer among the horses, because animals are so less judgemental, you know?”
“That must make you Castiel,” he says. According to Michael, all three sons were named after angels, thanks to their father’s obsession with biblical history. Michael and Gabriel had fairly common names. Castiel on the other hand? Dean had never heard the name before.
Sam and Jess end up leaving after a couple more hours, heading back to their hotel to get some sleep before their flight. Dean is sad to see them go, wishing they could live nearby so he could see them more often. But with them both finding success in California, Dean knows there’s no way they’ll be moving back anytime soon. And Dean knows there’s no doubt, under any circumstance, that he will be moving to the
“Oh!” He exclaimed, all the confusion gone. “I just heard another voice in here and thought I was just imagining things. Sorry for bothering you, Professor!”
Cas thought about that as he drove, conjuring up an image of Dean’s soft smile, as if it were as easy as breathing. In a way, when they would go on those drives, Cas was worried as well. Whenever Dean was in a mood, Cas found himself worried for his friend; whether it be due to the strained relationship Dean had with his father, or the fact that his friend was a perfectionist. He was worried that Dean was beating himself up too much, letting himself fall into a pit of despair and a cycle of negative thought patterns.
He attempted to get more work done, but his view was obscured by a foil wrapped item held out in front of him. It was some sort of food, judging by the mouthwatering scent. Dean attempted to ignore it, but Cas was persistent, shoving the item at him until Dean accepted it.
There was a middle aged woman sitting at the desk, typing on the computer. She had dark skin and short, black ringlets. She also had a large bright smile which upon seeing Claire, immediately brightened the room.
“It’s buried in an ancient Labyrinth, on a little island far north of the Aether.” Charlie says. “However, not only is it basically impossible to go out to the Labyrinth, but it’s theorised that the inside holds Nephilims as well. Overall, it’s basically impossible to get that crown.”
“No need for the formalities, Mary.” Castiel said with a smile, “Your son continuously puts my own life in front of his own, and he is one of my closest companions. I consider him family. Thus, his family is also mine.”
Dean stumbled into his bedroom as soon as he got home, dumping his bag on the floor and flopping onto his bed. They had only been back at school for three weeks following winter break and Dean wanted it to be vacation time again. Despite being excited going into 1
“Our beloved Kevin Tran!” She began to shout. “We bring you gifts from life into death. Commune with us, Kevin Tran, and move among--”
Dean didn’t answer her and just punched in the order, along with a black coffee. He then went into the kitchen to toast the sandwiches, bringing them back out to Claire with her coffee. He slumped down at the table and munched on a sandwich himself, already wanting to go to bed despite the fact it wasn’t even 4pm.
They departed Purgatory Village during the mid-afternoon, deciding not to stay at their inn for the night.
Cas grinned and walked past Dean, grabbing the container. He gave it to Dean before indicating over to the sidewalk.
He follows her down the hill and into the village. There are people bustling around him, walking in and out of the different buildings, or chatting off to the side. It’s the most people he’s seen since he awoke, considering the only other people he’s seen is the Queen and the girl, and at least the girl is an actual,
As Dean walked up to the table, he noticed everyone was sitting in their usual spots. Anna and Charlie on one side, Benny on the other in the seat next to Dean’s. Castiel sat on the same side as the two of them, but always with a chair between them. Dean tried to not let it bother him that Castiel was so closed off, Anna said that was just a part of who he was and to not take it personally.
graders. As they talked, Dean signed to make sure Cas was able to understand the conversation. He hated it when Cas was left out, so he made sure he did his best to include Cas the entire night.
The first thing Dean notices is her eyes. They’re big, green and almost too big for her small face. They are staring right at him, almost as if she is assessing him, seeing whether she trusts him or not. It’s a strange look to see on a baby, let alone one that isn’t even a year old. He tries to take note of all her features, burning whatever image he can of his daughter in his mind. He has no idea what is going to happen but he doesn’t want to ever forget her. He doesn’t want to forget her brown curls, or her button nose. It’s that moment when he realises just how much he loves her, despite only just meeting her. He realises it’s almost as if he’s meeting a stranger that he already knows, this deep love and connection for his own child causing a sense of familiarity.
He focused his gaze on his dirt covered hands, angrily staring at them as if they were nothing but vermin. All his life, he had been told that these hands were to bear the powers of Michael and Gabriel. All his life, he had been told that his life had been blessed with the magic of angels. All his life, he was told he would amount to great things.
Dean stood smiling at the camera, dressed in a plain blue shirt and denim jeans. He had sunglasses on and his usual black cap (the one that Cas had seen him wearing numerous times now). However, it wasn’t how attractive he looked in the photo that made Cas stop (because he
“She’s right, and I’m not hating on you for walking away, in fact it was the mature thing to do in that situation. You needed time to think, and I get that, but Cas never said he found you flawed. From what I’m hearing, Cas chose you from the beginning, he wanted you from the beginning, and he continued to want you despite these so-called-flaws you claim you have. Dean… Cas
Dean’s mother let go of him, so that he could greet Sir John. She then made her way over to Castiel, curtseying when she arrived in front of him. It was a strange form of a curtsey though, considering Mary wore not a dress, but trousers instead. If it were not for the many different places Castiel visited, such as the Aether region or meeting the workers upon Purgatory mountain, he would not have known that dresses were not the main form of dress for women. All the women in the castle, in the kingdom’s village, even out in the Grasslands town all wore dresses. There, you would not see one woman in trousers, it was considered blasphemy. Castiel’s exposure to other places amongst the island, granted him the knowledge that this was not customary to all citizens of Grace Island. That in some regions, women were more inclined to wear trousers as they found them much comfier and easier to move in.
one of her favourite movies of all time, when she bumped into my dad so hard that she knocked him flat on his ass.”
He follows the signs that point to the different offices, following the corridors down to the area for soulmate and bond history studies. From there, he reads each of the names on the doors, slowly creeping down the hall. It only takes a couple of doors for him to spot it, the familiar last name embroidered into the gold name plate that’s stuck to the door on his left.
Remembering it was time for his weekly visit from Claire, Dean grinned and bid an abrupt farewell to his brother—Sam protesting as Dean ended the call. Dean wandered out of the kitchen and into the bakery, where Claire stood waiting at the till. She asked for a latte and a few of the chocolate chip cookies before retreating to her usual spot. Dean had to complete a few errands around the bakery and by the time he sat down across from Claire, she’d nearly finished her cookies.
“Dean, are you okay?” Cas asks, panting. His lips are swollen red, a reminder of what they just took part in. A reminder that what they just did was going to send the friendship they’d just started to form crashing and burning.
It was a good eight hours to Lawrence, a long time to be driving. Ironically, it made Cas wish that Dean were there, because he knew how much his friends liked long drives. The moment Dean had gotten his license, he’d made the vow that he would drive all over the country, just like the road trips his father took him on as a child.
The minutes pass and the road is still long and Dean is hoping to spot some form of life soon. But as he walks a few steps forward and hears a snarl echo through the woodland, he realises that maybe his hopes should’ve been more specific.
“Can I just clarify something?” she asks, as if she hasn’t just bombarded him with 30 minutes worth of follow up questions.
“My father taught Michael all his moves.” Cas comments. “He always loved dancing, but none of us have any idea where it came from, not even our mother. He never took formal lessons or anything. He just… loved the art.”
They ran through the forest just along the outer banks of the kingdom. Despite having lived there all his life, Castiel had no idea where they were going. The forest was dark with no direct pathways through it. To him, everything that surrounded them were nothing but endless trees. Fortunately, Dean knew his way around Grace Island as if it were the back of his hand. He ran and darted through trees, gripping Castiel’s hand tightly and pulling him along. Castiel followed blindly, consumed by his thoughts and grief that he did not even hesitate for a second.
“Pretty cliché but we’re making gingerbread cookies. The masses seem to love them; everyone is always ordering some sort of batch. So I figured to help save me time, you could help me.”
Dean stood still for a moment, before he pulled Cas into a bone-crushing hug. Cas melted right into it, clutching onto Dean as if he were a lifeline. They stood like that for a while, gathered up in each other’s arms, neither one of them wanting to be the first to let go.
From what Benny had said, the sword is one of the treasures buried within the woods and only a knight who is worthy can retrieve it.
“Well, I can move back in with my parents, or… if you’re willing to have me... I could move in here? Not saying that I would mooch off of you or anything… I mean… I’d obviously contribute to the bills and it’s only if you actually
helped. Though there were some nights, some dark nights when Dean just couldn’t shake the feeling off. Where he woke up screaming, the repressed feelings slowly attempting to claw their way out.
Gabe dropped them off back at the Winchester’s, Dean giving the older Shurley a few candy bars (which he’d snuck from the party) as payment. They walked inside to find Sam in the living room with a huge bucket of candy next to him. He was watching
So Dean does, leaning in closer to get a better look at it. He doesn’t get it at first, his mind clouded by the alcohol and the flurry of emotions he’s just felt. It takes a couple of seconds, but then it all clicks into his brain and he feels the shock hit him like a freight train.
Dean sits down next to him and Cas is quick to throw his arm around him, drawing him to his side. They are silent for a few minutes, just enjoying the peacefulness of their land and the feeling of the soft cold breeze from the trees. It’s nights like this where Dean feels a sense of security. It’s nights like this where he feels at home.
“We shall celebrate when you return from Lazarus tomorrow.” She declared. “However, in the meantime, I feel your knight will make sure it is a day worth celebrating.”
Purgatory Mountain is tall and boiling hot. Even miles below the mountain’s peak, the heat of the mountain’s core makes sweat pool on Dean’s forehead and his lips dry.
Most Friday nights, they were able to somewhat keep up their tradition, through weekly phone calls. Life in Denver was much harder than Cas had thought, with limited friends and limited sources of happiness in a city where he knew nobody. His weekly calls to Dean and Charlie were the highlight of his week and the time where he truly felt like himself. Just like when he was a child returning home from school, getting home from work and calling his friends on the phone brought the same sense of relief. Every phone call ended with his cheeks hurting from smiling, his throat sore from talking and a cold feeling inside of him, as he couldn’t help but wonder why on Earth he still lived in Denver.
Kevin and Dean had done the same unit in their second semester of Freshman year. Leading up to exams, Dean had asked Kevin if he could copy some notes and Kevin had kindly leant him his notebook. Dean had forgotten to give it back, something he still felt bad about to this day. He even apologised to Kevin at one point, in which the spirit had called him an idiot. However, in this moment… he was never so grateful for keeping that notebook.
He watched as his friend… or ex-friend rather closed his eyes for a moment, almost as if it had all became too much for him. He too took a breath, before allowing the blue of his eyes to be seen again. He forced a small smile in Dean’s direction.
“You should be grateful that luck was on your side and that monster finally got tired. Otherwise, you would have had no chance at defeating him.”
”. It felt homely and welcoming, exactly what Cas wanted his neighbour to be. It gave him a bounce in his step as he headed up the two front steps and straight for the front door to knock. However, he noticed straight away that there was a doorbell, with a mini sign that said: “Please ring! :)”. So Castiel did as he was told and rang the doorbell a couple of times for good measure. No sound came from inside the house, not even from the doorbell. He pressed it one more time, scrutinizing it carefully as he did and concluded that the darn thing was broken. So he proceeded to knock, which led nowhere, so he came to the logical verdict that his new neighbour was not home.
At first, Dean had a hard time continuing to do it--worried that maybe he was hurting Cas. He slowly went to draw his hand away but Cas stopped him.
He never thought the day would come that Cas would be sitting here, in his kitchen, eating the apple pie he’d built from scratch with his own hands. It was always a distant fantasy, one Dean thought about to help him sleep at night. Never, ever did he think it was in the realm of possibility.
He locked up and headed downstairs, Cas trailing behind him as per usual. They were always silent during the journey home, Dean learnt the hard way growing up what it was like to talk to spirits around others. In his adult years, he made sure never to communicate with a spirit in the public eye. Although, there were plenty of times when Cas attempted to antagonise him.
He jumped out and walked to the back, examining the distance and deeming it safe. The car he was parked in front of was a sleek black Chevy, definitely fitting into the category of a ‘classic car’. However, he didn’t know much more than that as he wasn’t exactly much of a car person.
“Dean… I appreciate the sentiment, but what about your job? Travelling all the time? I am well aware of your past year and a half of performances, I don’t think I ever saw you slow down. I want you to be in Grace’s life and be a father, but only if you are all in.”
He recognises himself, although he was much younger. He’s smiling in the panting, big and bright. The woman in the picture is smiling too, cradling him in her arms. She has long blonde hair that falls in curls down her shoulders and atop of his head. Her eyes twinkle in the painting, almost as excited and bright as his own. He doesn’t know whether that was what her eyes actually looked like, or the painter just made her that way, but he likes it nonetheless. A man is also in the painting, standing behind them with the slightest of smiles. He has dark hair and dark eyes as he stares straight ahead. Dean supposes he wasn’t as loving and affectionate as the woman, but he didn’t seem cold or callous. The people in the picture look like a loving family, a
Cas breathed in Dean’s scent, latching onto him so tightly, he was worried that his friend might break. But considering this was the first time they had hugged in so many months, Cas didn’t care at all. He let the relief wash over him in a wave, knowing that at least for that moment, he could enjoy the peace and serenity that Dean’s touch brought him. The comfort of knowing that he was finally home, safe and sound.
Pamela narrows her eyes. “Yes, I do happen to recall those three weeks you dropped off the face of the planet and left me running around like a headless chicken….
For a moment, Mary looked astonished, her eyes wide as she regarded Castiel’s words. He was not surprised at her shock, considering it was something that no member of royalty had ever really said before. He thought of his own father, with Sir John as his knight. While the two were close companions, Castiel never felt as if they could call each other friends. Mary and Dean were both forbidden within the castle, never invited to dinner or to at least be near John while they slept. He knew for a fact that his father didn’t accept John as family, which Castiel couldn’t exactly blame him for, but at the same time, it made Castiel’s current words all the more unfamiliar.
Dean doesn’t have time to reflect on it, even though the worry bubbles inside of him. He keeps walking, heading straight for the main control room.
After sometime, he felt the noticeable sensation of someone looking at him. As if there were eyes fixed on the back of his head.  He turned slightly to see Dean, who was staring over at him from the archway, a worried frown prominent on his face. Castiel realised his shaky breaths and muffled whimpers must have not been as subtle as he thought. Dean was one of the most attentive people he had ever had the pleasure to meet, so it did not surprise Castiel that the knight was able to pick up on his emotional state.
She only just got through making Dean’s name sign when Michael went to shut the door. Claire shot her foot out and stopped the door, sending a nasty glare towards him.
Castiel informs him and Dean is quick to follow. The prince leads him through, down the main tunnel, through side tunnels, down winding slopes. The place is a maze and without Castiel there, Dean’s sure he would’ve gotten lost a thousand times over.
“Ouch, ow! I’m sorry, okay? I promise, apart from my family, he was the only other one to know. I just… I knew he wouldn’t tell, okay?”
Instead of being happy like Dean thought he would be, instead a heavy layer of guilt flooded through him, triggering an aggression deep inside of him.
“You know… I have no idea why you always tell me this story. I mean… it is pretty depressing.” Dean states.
One of them has been ripped open, and the contents of that letter were obviously enough for Pam to deem that person a “loony”. For a reason Dean can’t explain, however, he feels a pull to investigate these envelopes further.
“Okay fine. Yes, I contacted Sam to ask if you were still kicking. But c’mon Dean, I’m your manager, I should be hearing it first.”
He shook Cas a little bit to make sure--his friend going along with it and continuing to laugh. Once he had solid empirical evidence, he squeezed Cas’ shoulders before pulling him into an embrace. He gripped Cas tightly in his arms, resting his head on his freezing cold shoulder. Although it was slightly uncomfortable, the moment was far too overwhelming and warm for Dean to care. Cas buried his head in the crook of Dean’s neck, holding him tight around the waist.
Dean helped him remove the coat and shoes, leaving them safely beside the pool. Then, with one last reassuring look, he turned away and left Castiel alone.
He signed, gasping out a gush of air as he did so. He watched Cas pause, the fork halfway to his mouth and stare at Dean with wide eyes.
This was not good. He knew what Mary was implying. He knew that she was right. But he could not let her think that.
As he laid in Dean’s arms, he felt as if it were Heaven on Earth. He could never have imagined that he would experience a moment like this -- wrapped in Dean’s arms, safe and sound from the peril of monsters and entities alike. While he knew this moment would not last for long, that these few moments was all he was going to get, he made it his mission to cherish every single second.
“Party was lame.” Dean said with a shrug. “Thought we’d have a lot more fun hanging here with Sammy.”
Once he got there, he saw a figure waiting for him in the dark. Despite not being able to see his face, Dean knew it was Cas in a heartbeat. When he was able to fully see Cas in the dark, his friend signed:
Vale Village was beautiful, very quaint and sophisticated. Castiel could see why Dean enjoyed living here. The citizens were all very friendly with each other, a camaraderie that only existed between people living so closely together for so long. He saw a group of children playing together, chasing each other along the village’s main path. Their infectious laughter was enough to make Castiel give a small smile as if he could practically feel their joy. He could not help but ponder what it was like for them, being able to play with other children their age. Castiel was never granted that luxury, his only friends being the adult guards who were ordered to protect him.
“No, Castiel.” His mother practically snarled, causing him to stop speaking. “You will not have anymore to do with this. I forbid you from going on anymore expeditions, or spending your time in your study. From this moment onwards, you are to dedicate your time to training. This has gone on for far too long.”
Before Dean can even blink, his hand is reaching for whatever it can grab. It latches onto a large tree branch, gripping it tightly. Dean swings his arm out, wacking the closest one in the head with it. Then, he is up on his feet, doing the same for the other two. Swinging, hitting, swinging, hitting. Dean isn’t even thinking, his brain not computing the situation he is in. His body is working on muscle memory, beating all three monsters to a pulp. Eventually, he watches as all of them collapse to the ground, still alive, but unconscious. When he feels safe to do so, he drops the branch and begins running, running as fast as his legs will take him.
He finished serving the customer in front of him, telling them their order wouldn’t be too long. He faced away to hand the barista the receipt and turned back only to lock eyes with a piercing gaze.
“I can hear a thrum, as if it is energy.” She says. “I am assuming, due to how powerful the weaponry is meant to be… that this thrum will lead us to the controls.”
The next sound Cas registered was his own thump as he fell out of bed and onto the floor, along with Dean’s throaty chuckle echoing on the bathroom walls.
Cas is silent for a moment, barely having blinked during the entire time Dean spoke. They stare at each other quietly, Dean waiting for Cas to make his choice. However, he doesn’t have to wait long before Cas grips his hands tightly around Dean’s jacket. Then, before he can even blink, Cas is pulling him into a searing kiss.
Mary raised an eyebrow. “Sure, is there a reason you want to go? We already went last week to get you a bunch of new books. Did you finish them already?”
Dean looks around at the corner he tucked himself into before he fell asleep. It was about 10 feet from the waiting area, and only about 3 feet from the giant window overlooking the tarmac and runway outside. Earlier, after satisfying his hunger with a small McDonald’s meal, he found himself wandering over to this corner in an attempt to get away from other people. He must have fallen asleep at one point while reading his book.
He grins but shakes his head. “Nah, I was on the red-eye to Wisconsin. But because of your flight hiccup, it pushed us back as well.”
“I don’t know you well enough to explain all your inner thoughts. Dean. You were always closed off when I knew you.”
“Dean, if you move your hands away you break the seance. Just sit still and be quiet.” She snapped. Dean did as he was told.
“Put those on, wash your hands and then come and grab some gloves.” He instructed. Claire, despite being quite stubborn, did as she was told. Dean, on the other hand, got his bench space prepared, grabbing a bowl of dough out of the fridge.
Dean grins and reaches out to pull Cas into a hug, gripping onto him tightly. He takes comfort in the quiet, and just the
A few steps into the woods, darkness descends upon them. The torches they carry provide minimal light, but they quickly figure out that it’s enough for them to slowly guide themselves through. They stand still for a moment, attempting to get their bearings as they look for a path to guide them through.
“I couldn’t handle my feelings so I ran away and moved to Denver. I… I thought that was best for all of us, but I see now that I’m wrong. I should’ve told you and Charlie first and I should’ve told you the truth. I apologise for being a coward and I really hope you can forgive me for all the pain I’ve caused us.”
The two of them headed over to the playground, Cas starting to run mid-walk—sprinting ahead of Dean. Dean laughed and chased after his friend, the two of them having an impromptu midnight tag game.
The royal stables were beside the castle, near the west courtyard where they had trained. They only had a few horses in their stables, considering Castiel and his mother barely rode. Dean, on the other hand, loved horses more than anything Castiel had ever seen. Although they had a stablehand, it was not uncommon for Castiel to find Dean out in the stables when he had a break in his duties.
Dean laughed humorously as he slunk back into his chair, keeping his eyes trained on the road in front of them.
Upon entering Dean’s childhood street, she couldn’t say she was surprised. The street very much looked like the street an All-American boy would grow up on. From the white picket fences to the sturdy front porches. It looked like a place Claire wished she had grown up in, instead of being bounced from house to house.
with him and then expected Cas to be fine with it. He may be tired, but the minimal night’s sleep did make him realise that he was a fucking moron.
“He started attending there after Spring Break and he took all his stuff with him. Meg explained that she was only living there until the lease was up at the end of June. After that she basically kicked me out, told me that my stuff was in a storage locker and gave me the key for it. But… before I could leave she stopped me. She told me how her and Cas were only fake dating. How Cas had a crush on me and wanted to find out a way to see if I had one on him too. Like we were in high school. With that she slammed the door in my face and I haven’t seen her since.”
Later that evening, the Winchesters found themselves settling down after dinner. John and Mary watching TV in the living room, with Sam sat in front of them on the floor playing with his toy train. Dean laid on his stomach, kicking his legs as he read through the book in front of him. The book was filled with pictures, people showing the signs through still images.
As soon as Dean stepped into the room, he’d felt a wave of déjà vu hit him. Almost everything looked the same, from the tables, to the flowers, to every little decoration. He supposes that shouldn’t be a surprise, considering it was the exact same venue that Michael and Adam had their wedding in. They only had minor differences, different napkins, a different cake. Everything was mostly kept the same because neither Dean nor Cas were fussy when it came to the planning.
Despite all of that, the mere thought of Cas being with someone that wasn’t him still brought an overwhelming pain deep inside of Dean.
Dean could feel the energy in the room and the way Cas looked as if he was almost ready to explode. Dean knew what happened when he pushed spirits too far. He had many broken bulbs in his room as a teenager. It seemed he always had a flare for pushing people… and entities… far beyond their limit. He didn’t want Cas to do something he would regret, nor did Dean himself. So he took a breath and decided to redirect the conversation.
“It’s lovely to meet you, Dean. How do you know Cas and Grace?” she asks warmly. Dean sends a quick glance to Cas, scared to answer the question. Does he tell the truth? Or does he lie?
was all Dean could see and for a moment, his mind flooded with memories from the past. He paused as the past he had tried so hard to forget, attempted to wriggle itself from the box it had been buried away in. The eyes in front of him were so familiar, yet so different at the same time. It took Dean a second to realise these eyes belonged to a stranger and not the figure his brain had desperately tried to keep hidden away.
She shook her head. “Unfortunately, no. It doesn’t ring any bells. I will try to look into it, but I’m mainly good at being a psychic… not any good at lore or research.”
She was an avid reader and was always a big believer in happy endings. For a while, she never thought she’d get her own—not until she moved to Sioux Falls. It took time, but soon she began to feel safe in the home of Jody. After time she began to get along with Jody’s other daughter Alex. Alex introduced Claire to her circle of friends and before Claire knew it, she was enjoying school for the first time in her life. It was all thanks to Dean, whose stories cracked those tough walls around Claire’s heart. He brought her back to her childhood, in a time when stories were once upon a times and happily ever afters—to where the world could be magical. Claire owed him so much gratitude.
“Ah, hit a sore spot, did I?” The monster laughed. “You should be happy to know I killed her nice and slow. It was…
Whether they’re masking their emotions or not, however, the Novak brothers certainly seem perfectly content.
Around the sixth play, Castiel found himself stopping, just to stare at the phone with wide eyes, almost as if he couldn’t believe what he had just heard. Like he couldn’t believe what was actually happening.
Dean was finishing up the final touches on his costume when he heard the sound of the doorbell ring. Rolling his eyes, he left his room and ran down the stairs to the front door. He opened it wide to see his best friend standing there, dressed head to toe in his costume. Dean grinned.
“I’m sure you knew already, but Kate isn’t my mom.” Dean explains, sneaking a glance over to his step-mom who is talking with some relatives of hers, “Sam and I have --
Gilda leaves them as Charlie and Dean begin to travel back to Hannah, to explain the events of the past two hours. He tells it to Charlie as he walks, explaining his memory of Hester and the woman he met there today.
With a sigh, he took a gentle step backwards towards the staircase. However, as soon as his foot made contact with the carpeted floor, a large creak echoed through the hall, bouncing and ricocheting off the walls. Castiel froze, immediately turning to look behind him, in the direction of where the guards were. He listened quietly, trying to hear if any of them happened to be approaching. He waited through a few beats of silence, trying to detect the sound of footsteps or any sort of movement. In the end, all he could hear was nothing but soundlessness, which made him let out a breath of relief. However, before he could bask in his consolation, something made him freeze again.
“Cher, your friend is just like most of the guys I talk to,” the Cajun man said, “he’s fascinated by the stories, thinks of me as a damn hero, but he’s definitely not thinking about going into combat. Trust me.”
Luckily for Dean, his boyfriend Castiel understood this. And his boyfriend was also inherently aware that he was the topic of a majority of their conversations.
“I came here to talk to you, because I knew we couldn’t do this over the phone,” Cas said, “I just… I wanted to tell you I’m sorry.”
His mother, recognising the sign, smiled with her eyes slightly glassy. She leant down and kissed her son’s head,
Two members of the royal guard approached in a hurry, having witnessed the Nephlims’ demise and Dean’s collapse. Castiel turned to look at them with a stern gaze, his voice deepening as he spoke with a tone of authority.
Relief floods through Cas from head to toe, his gaze softens and his shoulders relax. Dean barely catches the smile on Cas’ lips before the man dives forward, pulling Dean into a bone-crushing hug. Dean’s arms immediately wrap around Cas’ waist and he leans in, burying his head into the crook of Cas’ neck. Cas’ warmth and presence soothes him, immediately makes every bit of this whole, terrifying ordeal worth it. He’s enfolded in the arms of his best friend, the person he trusts the most out of anyone in this world.  He’s safe, he’s at peace.
“Yeah… yeah, I know.” Dean whispers, looking over at the box as well. “I know this sounds weird, but… I knew him, okay? I know what he was like, even though I wasn’t there for long, and… I gotta read those, okay Pam? It’s important.”
it was Dean’s fault that Cas could no longer eat. When he served it up and re-entered the living room, Cas was glaring at him. However, he seemed too excited for Netflix to bother being too irritated.
“Yes?” Michael asked, probably not understanding why the strange girl in front of him was still silent.
The whole problem wasn’t just that he was in love with his best friend. The problem was, he was in love with his best friend but couldn’t tell him.
“However,” Dean continued, taking a step forward. “Despite my occasional fears, I wouldn’t trade being your knight and being your friend, for
Dean ended up calling Cas’ brother Gabriel, who had moved back home. He picked the two of them up 15 minutes later, the boys leaving without saying goodbye to anyone.
Dean was stopped mid his rant by two hands gripping his wrists. He immediately locked eyes with Castiel who trapped him in his piercing gaze. He watched as Cas purposefully took a very deep breath, emphasising what he was doing to Dean. With a flash of annoyance, Dean played along—taking a large deep breath in and out. He kept doing so, keeping his eyes locked on Cas’. He didn’t look at any other part of his friend’s face, not wanting the fury to consume him again. He just kept breathing: in and out, in and out—until soon, he could feel the calm wash over him.
Before he could think about it, he pulled himself out of bed, venturing out into the hall in only his sleepwear. The hallway was dark, as the light from the candles had begun to fade. He walked quietly, careful not to misstep in the areas where the floorboards creaked from the slightest touch. He had grown up in the castle his entire twenty-one years of life -- he knew how not to get caught on midnight strolls.
“There are three things I must tell you, Castiel,” Missouri murmured, dropping the formalities, “are you ready to hear them?”
Dean hums softly, because ultimately, he agrees. He doesn’t want to travel alone, to go and find these fortresses. If he had the choice, he’d much rather stay in the village, where it’s safe.
“I’m all in,” Dean states. “I’m all in for every bit of it. I was scared about losing my job, because even though it was nothing like I thought it’d be, I thought I’d be disappointing everyone, including myself, if I gave it up after working all this time for it. But I now know that it means shit-all compared to
“You must leave now before it gets dark,” she says, “but I have one final thing to say. A message, for my son.”
Charlie lets him in through the front door, to the small living and dining area of the home. It’s dark inside, with the only light source coming from the windows. Mostly everything in the house has been packed away, the room quite bare and empty. He can’t remember what it used to look like, but he’s sure it wouldn’t have looked like his. He knows there would be more to this, little pieces that make the place a home.
“Well, I’ll put in my two-week resignation on Monday and once I’ve completed those weeks, I’ll move back here.”
Dean retorted, trying to ignore the fact that he sounded like a teenager attempting to be rebellious.
“However, ten thousand years ago, shortly before my ancestor wrote this prophecy, The Empty had returned. She told the prince of what was to come and he heeded her warning, gathering warriors and researchers from across the land. See, this civilisation had an abundance of wealth and resources, some of the most glorious technology you could ever see. Together, they created four giant fortresses, equipped with weapons that The Empty was no match for. They also created an army of robotic creatures, known as the Nephilims, which would help protect the castle and the royal family. The fortresses were controlled by four individuals, one from each region of Grace Island. Together these four individuals, the prince and his knight, were able to vanquish The Empty from their land, saving their civilisation.”
Because Dean had paid for the groceries, Cas decided to head over by himself to buy their coffees. He knew Dean’s coffee order off by heart, having bought coffee for him so many times before. A couple of minutes later, he walked back out with two takeaway cups and a box of donuts. When he got back to the impala, he was positive that he saw Dean’s eyes actually
He knew that the way they treated Cas was what officially won Dean over. They had welcomed him immediately into their family, no hesitation whatsoever. Dean hadn’t told him at the time, but he had worried that bringing home a boyfriend would flare up their previous issues and homophobia. Yet, from what Cas had seen, neither of them had been bothered in the slightest. Mary, Dean’s mom, had asked him questions about his profession and family while John had talked to him about Chicago and the sporting teams that they had there (not that Cas really followed sports). Later that night after they left, Dean ended up telling Cas about his past with his parents and how that night had shown how the both of them had grown.
They begin to share stories about themselves, as the dancing and festivities continue to happen around them. Cas tells Dean a little more about his studies as a professor of history, particularly the formation of soulmate bonds over the past few millennia. Dean reluctantly tells Cas about his job as the head cook at the local bar and grill, but surprisingly, the man seems to be intrigued rather than have any form of detest for Dean’s career.
As soon as the words tumble out of his mouth, he immediately wants to take them back. An apology on his tongue, he opens his mouth to stumble his way out of an uncomfortable situation, until he sees Cas meeting his gaze. The man’s eyes are soft, with no hint of anger or irritation in them. He sends Dean the ghost of a smile.
her. He can see the otherside of the room, behind her body and from what he can remember, he knows that humans shouldn’t be able to do that.
Claire nodded and a distraught expression formed on her face. Dean smiled softly and got up, heading over into the kitchen. He could see Claire watching him confused as he turned on the espresso machine and grabbed two mugs. After some time, he headed back to the table, sliding the warm mug of hot cocoa in front of Claire.
Upon entering the kitchen, Claire immediately realised what Dean had been describing in all of his stories. Just like in the bakery, the smell of sugar and flour was overwhelming. It was as if the whole room had been perfumed in the scent. Claire could also smell something tangier, another sweet smell in the midst of the others.
After helping her clean up, Dean gave her a hug goodbye. With another long drive ahead of them, Dean wanted to leave sooner rather than later.
Dean had been busy all day, completing order after order for the multitude of awaiting customers. So by the time Claire came in, the mass of customers had dissipated and Dean was exhausted.
Cas smiles softly, his eyes crinkling, “It was my pleasure Dean, I appreciate that you trusted me enough to tell me. In all honesty, I rarely talk about my parents with anyone who isn’t my immediate family. However, I felt completely comfortable telling you everything. It was nice to be able to talk about that with you.”
“You had an apprehension about going.” Cas stated. “You kept trying to refuse the trip, despite Sam’s insistence. Yet now you’re here and you seem to be enjoying yourself. So I’ve concluded that there must be some other reason as to why you didn’t want to come.”
“I want it because I don’t think I could do this without it,” Charlie states, lifting her gaze again, “I don’t think I could go out into the wild, leave this town, knowing you didn’t support me.”
Dean laughed and closed the door behind him. As he did, his mother walked into the room. Every time his mom took them trick or treating, she wore the same angel costume: a white dress with a halo headband.
Dean shakes his head. “There is no way in hell I wasn’t going to be here. I only received your letters yesterday, and I booked it to get here. I’m so sorry I wasn’t here sooner.”
