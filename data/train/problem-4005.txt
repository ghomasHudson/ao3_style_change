“So...I guess I’ll just, what, wait for you to pop back unexpectedly?” he encourages, trying to seem casual as he leans back against Baby.
But Sam had already experienced what a home felt like. He had made one all those years ago at Stanford. It was more than just a roof over your head and the feeling that you could sleep safely at night. A home was a warm place, filled with people you cared about and wanted to look after.
“I, uh,” he fumbled, “I’m sure it’s not as impressive as the stuff you’re doing.”
Older wizards pursed their lips, eying the Hufflepuff in annoyance as he tore down the corridor and barely avoided crashing into a small group of 4th years being accompanied to the makeshift Hospital ward. He paid them no mind, searching frantically in every weary face, looking only for one particular Slytherin.
“Hunter funerals are something we’re unfortunately all too familiar with. We’ve lost a lot of good people throughout our years on the road…friends we couldn’t save or people who ran out of luck. And while it isn’t an easy life, Dean embraced it with everything he had because he believed it all made a difference. Saving people, hunting things.” Sam chuckled fondly. “Anyone who hunted with my brother could vouch for his abilities and skills against every kind of monster the world could spit out. Even if you had never hunted with Dean before, you knew you were in safe hands, because Dean Winchester had your back.”
“He...hung up his trench coat?” Sam repeated incredulously, eyeing the weathered, tan garment hanging next to Dean’s shirts and trucker jacket.
“And it wasn’t your fault either, Sam.” the younger man returned, turning to face his once adoptive father. “I know that you still feel guilty about not being able to help Dean, but you gave him what he needed. You were there for him, beside him until his last day. That was all Dean really wanted. To go out with his brother by his side. Not to die alone and forgotten.”
“What are you, his mother now?” Dean shakes his head, glancing back to his laptop screen. “So the guy left the trench coat behind, big deal Sammy. Maybe he’s finally realized how weird it is to wear it around all the time? Or, uh, he’s...feeling comfortable to...let loose a little?” he falters, frowning slightly. He intently focuses on the empty space above Sam’s head, as though trying to come up with a more convincing argument but gives up with a one armed shrug. “It’s not like the dude’s walking around the bunker naked.” He finishes at last, returning his attention to Sam in the doorway.
For the first time ever, Dean Winchester was on his own, with no directions, no orders, and no purpose. He was finally a free man with free will, exactly what he had fought for...except now he wasn’t sure what to do with all of it.
Trying to regain control of his inner turmoil. Trying to keep himself from falling apart.
He bows his head, remembering the days following their final stand against Chuck. There had been moments where Dean had let his anger get the better of him, where he had called Cas everything short of a coward for leaving Dean to deal with the aftermath of his confession alone. To re-evaluate everything he thought he had known about the angel. For leaving his life with an empty, Cas-shaped-hole and no hints on how to fix it.
Dean straightened himself, squaring his shoulders. He wanted to believe him, but it was hard to bypass decades’ worth of shitty mental conditioning. Being the “ideal” son for John Winchester, following orders like a good little soldier boy, and being the man the world demanded of him.
“Never really cared much for the Irish myself,” Rowena sniffed, sipping her champagne. “A bunch of superstitious numpties, really. Always getting themselves in trouble with the wee fae folk and then blaming their misfortune on a harmless red-haired maiden passing through.”
So despite the primal urge to chase his own pleasure, Dean releases his hold after a moment, relishing the smooth suction as Cas pulls off only to sink right back down into that blessed heat once again.
He knew he got off lucky.
Dean felt like a lump had fallen down his throat. “Cas…”
And now, he was back to where he started. His family was here, he had his brother back in his life, and Eileen was a nice bonus. He was honestly glad that Sam hadn’t scared her off and married some faceless sweetheart. And depending on how time ran up here, he could be meeting his nephew soon. Maybe even the rest of Sammy’s legacy eventually. Family reunions were gonna be hell to plan.
“Hello,” he beamed, still doing the same awkward wave he picked up over 20 years ago.
Dean turns back, lowering his head to meet Cas’ eyes.
“So what, you waited until I spilled my guts before deciding whether it was safe to pop back in and say hi?”
Panting hard together, Dean rests his head forehead against Cas’ with a soft thunk. Cas chuckles deeply, the pads of his fingers deftly running through the short hairs along the nape of his neck.
“Okay, maybe not. We will figure it out together, Sam. You, me, and Dean.” She points to each of them in turn before forming the letter “F” and using her hands to trace the shape of an outward circle.
Hours later, after they had said their goodbyes to John and Mary, Dean had helped Sam and Eileen settle into their new home which, according to Eileen, was a near exact replica of the house they bought together. It was...well, it was perfect.
It felt like an apology, one that was undeserved but one he was grateful for all the same.
“ ‘preciate that.” He grunts out, doing his damndest to keep his breathing steady and collected under Cas’ ministrations.
Dean had them in his life...but they didn’t
Dean fiddled absentmindedly with the keys, flipping them over in his hands, enjoying the distracting jingling.
“But you’re happy now with Eileen. With your son. I didn’t want to bring up bad memories, so I stayed away.” Jack responded, his gaze turned downward.
“Anyway, I was hoping Cas might be able to appraise some of the stuff before we go around touching or tossing them. I’ve been looking all around the bunker for him,” Sam continued, leaning against the doorframe. “Library, kitchen, even knocked on his room. Jack hasn’t seen him since they got back either. Any idea where he might’ve gotten to?” At this, Dean shakes his head dismissively.
“Think about it, Dean. We keep expecting Cas to be the one to reach out to us, but when was the last time we called him just to see how he was doing and not because we needed his help?” He shakes his head, taking a sip of beer, “And the thing is, we got so used to it that we just came to expect him to make contact first. So maybe it’s our turn, you know? We need to make an effort as well if we want to keep him in our lives.”
Except here was Cas, a celestial being beyond time and understanding, once again telling him that he was
“Change...like turning it into a Sorority house for badass bitches?”
Cas immediately catches onto what Dean isn’t saying and sits up sharply. Or he tries to, repositioning his shoulders leaning against the stone pillar as leverage through tiny hisses of discomfort.
Cas looks up at Dean with narrowed eyes. The angel tilts his head as he peers up at Dean, pressing his mouth into a familiar firm line. Annoyed, but still willing to put up with Dean’s crap.
“Rowena?”
Because these two idiots deserve to be honest with each other.
“Our grandfather left this for Dean and me to find the Men of Letters Bunker and restore the order to its former glory. For years it was a place for just the two of us. A kind of sanctuary. But it always felt a little empty, even before Dean…” he trailed off. It still hurt to say the words out loud. “But the truth is, the Bunker is more than just a safe place to crash. It’s a homebase, meant to be lived in by a team of people. Full of activity and life. It’s time that it went back to what it was built for. Besides, the place could use a change.”
“Wait, seriously?” Sam stares at his brother, grinning in amusement. “How did you know that?”
He was ready to let go. He had been for quite some time.
For the first time in a very, very long time, Sam Winchester felt a spark of hope.
And judging by the way Cas clings to him, he’s in no rush to return to the others either.
He grins sadly. “But you would come back to us every time, and when you did, it... it felt like I could breathe again. I should’ve appreciated you more man.”
“I know, Dean.” He responded, sounding regretful.
“Dean, I’m being serious. One day soon, we’ll have time to discuss all of this. To pick up the pieces and...make up for lost time. But right now, Heaven still needs me, and I have an obligation to help Jack succeed in bringing about a new period of peace. I owe all of them that much.”
“Why?”
The two of them fell into a comfortable chat about the state of Hell and the effect of her “No Deals” policy up on Earth. Now that there were less demon deals to look out for, hunters were finding new ways to handle the hundreds of unemployed demons walking around.
He gripped the steering wheel harder, hearing the leather creak under his hold. It should have been Dean in this car, riding her down the country backroads with a smile. Travelling, hunting, maybe even finally settling down in a nice little cabin with his second dog. Taking Baby to car shows in the summer for the cash prizes, proudly showing her off instead of letting her sit alone in the back of the house. Living a semi-retired life he never thought he could have.
By some miracle (or more likely his Hero’s Fortune, he reminds himself) he had arrived unscathed at his destination. Now that he had determined the “How he got Here”, logic dictated that he should figure out the “Where Here was”. Sam scanned the neighbourhood to get his bearings, and his breath hitched once he recognized the small, suburban home he had parked in front of.
As hard as it was, Sam had to accept that Eileen’s second chance had come to a long end.
“And you don’t think that’s odd? Dean, Cas almost never takes off his coat, even when we’re just hanging out together in the TV room.”
A malicious thought justified. He shook his head to clear his mind.
He couldn’t help wonder how Dean would have felt, seeing for himself how much he had meant to these people. How his influence (and, Sam supposed, the rumours that spread amongst the hunting community probably helped with Dean’s popularity) had brought together this group of diverse people into a family. Their family.
Dean marvels at being able to hold Cas like this. This cosmic being beyond his understanding, capable of creating miracles or absolute suffering, was letting Dean affect him. He feels Cas gently grip the short hairs on the back of his neck with one hand and clutch at the front of his jacket with sturdy fingers, settling himself comfortably closer as Dean’s other arm slips down to his waist.
At some point they made it to John and Mary’s place over the ridge, and the tearful reunion started all over again. John took an immediate liking to Eileen, listening as she regaled them with tales of her hunts. Sam, on his part, proudly told them of the people he helped with his practice, including a rather nasty case against a hunter who got caught in the middle of a homicide investigation.
“Oh, I know. You became a lawyer, like you told me you wanted to be! It was very nice, what you were doing to help those people when no one else would. They all really appreciated it, you know!”
“Cas, I uh, I owe you an answer. A proper one.” He coughs slightly, trying to ignore the tingling heat rising to his ears. “I know- I know I said that you didn’t give me an opportunity to answer you, but we both know that’s a cheap excuse…”
It was pretty much everything he had ever wanted.
Dean closed his mouth, biting back his sarcastic retort. Truth be told, Dean didn’t know what to believe. For nearly his entire life, living as a hunter was all he had ever known. All he had ever really been good at.
“Dean,” Cas chastised, deliberately embracing the man with his free arm and resting his chin onto Dean’s shoulder, “that’s not your decision to make.”
It had been hard learning how to live without her after 30-odd years of marriage. At first it was just lonely, even with Dean stopping by to check in on him. But soon he found his mind wandering, forgetting simple things like the day of the week and where he left his blasted glasses. Without his wife around to challenge him, his mind was becoming dull. It wasn’t long after that he was moved into the hospice, surrounded by worn and withered souls like him, making the best of the time they had left.
he grumbled to himself,
“Truth is, a part of me keeps expecting the other shoe to drop. That all this,” he waves his arm in a broad, sweeping motion, feeling the beer slosh around in his hand, “is nothing more than a really good dream.”
“Still, it’s weird though that he hasn’t called, you know? It’s almost like he’s, I don’t know, waiting or something…”
This development in their relationship was still new to both of them; Dean hadn’t ever felt unashamed of being physical with another man beyond trading handjobs or a blowjob when the occasion called for it. And Cas...well, they had time to get him up to speed. Besides, what Cas lacked in experience, he more than made up for in his proficiency in human anatomy.
No more monsters, no more pain, no more dancing for Fate or God or anyone else like a puppet on a wire. Just peace.
He slides into the driver’s seat of the Impala in a familiar move, but stops himself before closing the door. The cool evening air brushes against his face, the door creaking softly against the gentle breeze.
He was seeing Dean for the first time in ages and the actuality of the moment, for some strange reason, was scary. Maybe it was the suddenness that threw him off. Moments ago he was lying on his deathbed, ready to meet Dean again in the afterlife. Now Dean was here, apparently waiting for him.
Claire hesitantly takes the box, turning it over absentmindedly in her hands.
“Dammit, I’m frustrated, okay, but not with you! I’m annoyed with this, us. Two grown-ass men who can’t even have an honest conversation with each other without it turning into a freakin’ argument!”
Everything was going well until the conversation turned to the subject of Sam’s luck, finding such a wholesome spot to start a family of his own. The edges of his smile dipped down for half a second, but Rowena’s sharp eyes were still as impeccable as always.
That had been the last case Sam had handled before handing the keys of the Bunker over to Claire. He couldn’t bring himself to hunt after that.
“Jack?”
“Sorry man, no idea where the little guy wandered off to. I’m not exactly the angel’s keeper,” he grins, clearly proud of his little joke.
Eileen observed him from the hospital bed and somehow seemed to know where his mind had wandered to.
“Yeah? That sounds like him,” he replies evenly, swallowing a sip of beer carefully. “Trying to make the world a better place for the people he cares about.”
He was ready for it now.
“Do you need to go?”
Still, it isn’t until he actually sees Eileen grinning at him from the doorway that Sam is convinced she is really there.
Sam turned from the Impala to look at her.
“Who?”
“Yeah, I do…”
“Hmm, that’s true. But it’s still important, protecting people.”
There was very little to suggest this was anything but a social event.
He may only be able to taste the molecules rather than the salty musk of Dean’s release, but it was still Dean’s essence. A quintessential part of the human he loved. Cas wouldn’t see any of it go to waste.
“How are you, Dean?”
“Nearly every choice I have made, every decision, I did it for you and your happiness,” Cas admitted steadily before Dean could continue. The dying light played across his face, shrouding him in shadows. After a moment, he turned back to face Dean, locking eyes with the hunter and determined to lay it all out. “I made a decision to sacrifice myself to save you without giving you a say in the matter. And in doing so I…also made a declaration that you weren’t prepared to receive.” His arms hung heavy at his sides, “I’m sorry, Dean, it wasn’t a burden I meant to leave you.”
The panic attacks came and went as they pleased. Some nights he lies curled into himself in a cold sweat with Eileen at his back, whispering comforting things with her soothing voice. Other times he finds himself sharply pulling over to the side of the freeway, clutching the steering wheel and trying to get his breathing under control.
Sam grins knowingly, “You sure she’s the only one?”
Dean felt the death grip around his heart squeeze experimentally.
“Yeah, well, there’s a difference between a thrill and accidentally getting your dick bitten off.” He struggles to sound casual, suppressing the instinctive urge to cross his legs.
“It’s a good name. Sturdy. Powerful. Short. Like his uncle.” She signed, grinning as Sam laughed. Most days it was hard to talk about his brother without sending him into a downward spiral of guilt. It was rough, but Sam was trying to move on.
“I’m counting on it.”
Dean darted a glance at Sam, wondering if his brother had thought the same thing.
He kisses Cas. Again. And Again. Slotting their lips together with ease. Giving the man his answer between slow and languid pecks on his lips.
“Dean’s dead.”
Dean Winchester did
Dean hadn’t realized just how much he had missed the familiarity of the old Harvelle place.
Sam blinked at her, confused.
They stood there like that for a long moment, holding each other in the peaceful quiet of twilight. Dean wasn’t sure how much time had passed since he said goodbye to Sam and Eileen. Time felt different up here, just like Bobby said. Seconds like this could feel like a lifetime and still seem too short.
Sure, it was under new management, but even Rowena couldn’t risk her position as the Queen to protect him forever. Eventually, the demons would win.  Eventually, Dean Winchester would be put back on the rack to suffer at the hands of the very monsters he fought his whole life against, taunting them with sarcastic one-liners before delivering the killing blow.
Cas purposely remains silent, answering Dean’s question in more ways than one.
After a moment Jack’s eyes fluttered open, but his gaze was far away. Sam caught the quick flash of gold around his irises as he spoke.
“Hey, Sammy.”
Threading his fingers into Cas’ dark hair, Dean softens Cas’ uneven bobbing to a casual pace. Despite his reputation and penchant for one night stands, Dean Winchester liked it slow. He enjoyed the experience and savoured the feeling of every drawn out wave of pleasure. Not that he would ever admit it out loud.
“Nope, fuck it, this is something I gotta do.” Dean scrunches his face in frustration, the lines of his brow deepening. “I couldn’t say anything when I was alive, and I’ll be damned if I don’t say it when I’m dead.”
“But seriously Sam are you sure about this? Giving up the key to
‘No no no no no no!’
He’s unsure whether he imagines the mumbled groan over the sound of his frantically beating heart, but he doesn’t miss a familiar pair of sky blue eyes slowly blinking open with effort. Or the small, soft smile once Cas’ eyes meet his.
And honestly? Dean could get used to that.
While this was going on, Sam had finally dug up his old school transcripts and applied at the local community college. On top of being a stay-at-home dad teaching his 6 year old basic math, working as a part-time student trying to earn his paralegal degree introduced Sam Winchester to a whole new level of hell. The courses were rough and he was wildly out of practice with the legal jargon, but he felt back in his element, reading court transcripts and writing essays while waiting to pick up Dean from school.
He strains to listen for the swift clap of wings cutting through the air, but only the cool evening breeze greets him. Dean licks his lips nervously.
Dean laughed to himself; here he was, an unattached drifter who finally wanted to settle down somewhere to call his own.
“Then why-”
Then there had been Bobby, their Bobby, waiting for him like freaking Obi-Wan Kenobi. Telling him how the place worked, how the...love and memories kept it real, that the kid pulled some serious muscle to make the place more than just a retirement home for your golden years. That Cas had a hand in it too.
Dean freezes.
“I can’t promise there won’t be a lot of confusion in conversations.”
Before he can reply back, Garth is getting her attention and seamlessly drawing her back into conversation. He wouldn’t be surprised if by the end of the night Garth decided to name his next potential child after her in some way.
“Look, I’m not good at this kind of stuff. You probably know that better than anyone. But I know when the ball’s in my court and now it’s up to me to do the talking. So…I’m gonna talk, and I’m gonna hope that you’re still listening. ‘Cause I need you to know that I’m not mad, okay? About going incognito, or staying in heaven, or sacrificing yourself back in the Bunker. Which was a total dick move, by the way.” He adds, furrowing his brows as he looks skyward. “You don’t just get to drop a truth bomb like that on a guy and then vanish.”
Castiel takes a step back and narrowly avoids getting hit by a half ton of metal as Dean hastily flings the car door open. The two stare at each other in silence. Dean’s eyes, wide and red-rimmed, imploringly vulnerable, locked onto Cas’ fixed stare. If it were anyone else he would drop his gaze, but with Cas...for some reason, Dean was always drawn in closer, always wanting more.
A huge thank you to my friend and beta reader bluntrook for helping me get through this colossus writing project. When I started writing, I didn't realize just how massive and important the story was going to be. Her ongoing encouragement, dedicated beta reading and confidence in the story I was trying to tell has meant more to me than I can put into words.
“Because it wasn’t true.”
“Dean would have insisted that we name him after our father, but that just never seemed right to me…” he confessed to Eileen, not taking his eyes off his son. “I mean sure, he was always looking out for us in the end, even if he had a complicated way of showing it. But I don’t know…I guess I never considered naming my kids after our parents. It was Dean’s kind of thing, if he ever settled down properly. Mom and Dad were his heroes, not mine.”
The two men size each other up, taking in the moment before Dean pulls him into a long awaited embrace. Sam’s arms squeezes him tightly to his chest and he hears his brother let out an unsteady laugh that catches at the end. He felt comforting warmth seep into him.
He tries not to hold Cas down for too long, still in awe of Cas’ dismissive gag reflex. Something of which they discovered by happy accident in an initial post-hunt escapade. Although Cas had reassured him it wasn’t painful, he did say it was “rather indelicate to contract the muscles of the throat for an extended period of time, Dean”.
Dean laughs. “Relax, okay? I’m fine,” he pauses, before repeating “I’ll be fine. This is just something I’m gonna have to get used to on my own.”
The years wore on. Dean flourished well in and out of school, slowly growing into his awkward teen phase and waiting for his voice to drop so he could finally join Aunty Claire and the other Wayward Sisters on one of their “beginner” hunts. Eileen, in turn, began turning down opportunities to hunt one by one until eventually people stopped asking altogether. Sam’s job paid well and he fought well, earning him a reputation in and out of the community as the guy to go to if you ever found yourself in a spot of trouble with the law. He even extended his contact information to hunters that drove through, running a legal gig on the side to keep the law off of their backs while they were out there saving the people under it.
“Because you cared,” he answers bluntly, returning the eye contact. “For all your faults, for all of your struggles and resentment, you were always trying to make the world a better place. You are a loyal, caring friend, and anyone who knows you can see it. I should've been just another ‘dick with wings’, but you decided I was worth looking out for. Even when we first met, even though we argued and you defied my orders every opportunity you had, you still came to my aid when I asked for it. I never knew what that felt like until I met you.”
Sam snorts, finally making the connection. “Us.”
“Hey,” said Sam, reaching over and patting him on the back, his latent Dad instincts kicking in, “it’s not your fault.”
Jack looked up at Sam with those soft doe eyes of his, “It’s okay Sam. I know what you want to ask. Why I didn’t save Dean.” Sam’s breath caught at the mention of his brother’s name. “I’m truly sorry, but there was nothing I could have done. I told you I was going to be a hands-off God, to keep myself out of the narrative. And to do that...”
Cas must see the look of pain on Dean’s face, because he reaches up to catch Dean’s hand where it gently rests against his temple, pressing closer to Dean’s touch.
Dean watched all of this from the sidelines like a man entering a dream. It felt like a repeat of the time when Dean had accidentally pulled John out of the past and rewrote the world’s history just for one precious dinner together. Except this time there were no damned consequences, no freaking time paradoxes, and especially no douchebag angels out for their asses.
“Not to mention that you are stubborn to the point of stupidity. I’m not a mind reader, Dean, and even if I was, you would have issues about me ‘getting in your head’. It’s hard enough trying to navigate your temper whenever you feel the need to defend your own ego-” But there he stopped, suddenly, as if remembering what the argument was really about. Cas takes another steadying breath, and continues. “You are by far, the most frustrating human I have ever known. And I...I didn’t want to lose you,” he adds, in a small voice.
“Yes.”
“He’s good too. We’re all-” he cuts himself off, swallowing hard, “...we’re going to come out of this okay.” He finishes, unwilling to trust his words beyond that.
“You’ve also done a lot of good down here,” the kid beams at him, his expression so warm and bright, “just like I knew you would.”
Just as he twists the key in the ignition, about to rev up Baby’s engine and head out, Dean catches a flicker of motion from his peripheral on the left. He instinctively reaches into the empty pocket that once held his ivory-plated Colt .45. When his eyes discover a familiar tan trench coat outside the car window, Dean freezes, too stunned to move.
He doesn’t know what time it is or the name of the street he’s currently pulled over on. He’s not even sure he knows how long he’s been behind the wheel of the car, but judging by the aching cramp in his hands, he hasn’t let go of the steering wheel for hours. His hunter’s instincts kicked into autopilot to assess his current situation: he’s not covered in blood, he’s aware of his surroundings, he doesn’t smell sulphur in the car cabin or hear a jeering voice in his head, and his anti-possession sigil tattoo on his chest is still intact. He firmly concludes that he wasn’t possessed by a demon.
Mary catches him staring and excuses herself from the trio, offering to refill their drinks. She stops by Dean on her way to the kitchen, turning to watch their little family adamantly chatter away.
He turned around and took a couple steps away from the angel, rubbing his eyes and feeling his frustration give way to weariness with a grunt.
He remembers when he first woke up in Heaven 2.0, the feeling of his stomach unclenching when it became obvious that he hadn’t taken the elevator downstairs like he feared. Granted, he hadn’t been sure where he ended up, but it sure as hell wasn’t...well, Hell. The place looked like Earth, smelled like Earth, but felt...neater. Like someone had decided to accurately recreate the world but the paint was still drying. He couldn’t explain it any better than that.
A nagging thought at the back of his head reminds him that Cas is still in serious critical condition and in need of some medical attention. Even if Cas could stand on his own, he was going to need Dean’s help to make it all the way to the Great Hall. For the moment though, Dean was content to hold Cas in his arms, to listen to their breathing synchronize with the calming beat of their hearts. Proof that they’re alive. Proof that they survived. Proof that, against the odds, good things do happen.
Cas nods, understanding, and proceeds to shed his suit jacket. He does a fairly good job at it, Dean notes, considering his restricted space. Cas folds the dark material mechanically and, after a brief moment of consideration, places it under his knees as a makeshift cushion. The intention behind it causes Dean’s libido to reciprocate enthusiastically and appreciatively.
“Yeah yeah, I know…” she casually rolled her eyes at Sam’s cheesy response before checking to make sure Jody was out of earshot. “Between you and me...I don’t think she’s ready to be an empty nester yet.”
He jabs the bell frantically and hears the loud chiming resonate inside the house, the strobe light also flashing on the other side of the door. Sam took a step back, his hazel eyes checking the upper windows for any signs of life. With his heart beating a frantic staccato, Sam almost misses the faint glow of the hallway light beyond the dark windows. As he starts getting his breathing under control, his eyes pick out other signs of life in the house, like the warm glow peeking through the living room blinds. Then, the quiet clicking of a latch and a subtle groan from the door being forced open.  His elevated heartbeat begins to subside.
Dean chuckled to himself. A “profound bond”, Cas had called it. It wasn’t as though Dean had been blind to what Cas had done for them, he just hadn’t known what he was looking at exactly.
“We’ll see each other again soon,” Cas replies, a consolation and a promise.
“I don’t deserve it. You know that, right?” he mumbled into Cas’ trenchcoat.
“The guy came by a while ago. We chatted for a bit, he hung up his trench coat, left, and I went back to scoring us a case.”
Sam could have kissed her right then and there if he hadn’t found exceptional enjoyment in watching those hardened, seasonal hunters sheepishly laugh and blunder away with their tails between their legs.
Dead Sea Scrolls. Ancient Jewish treasure map? Awesome!”
“Because I didn’t believe that you felt the same way about me.”
He understood where she was coming from, in a way. The thought of passing on Azazel’s curse, his latent special abilities, or even just painting an assumed target on his son’s back because the kid was born from Sam Winchester’s DNA had kept him up more nights than he could count.
“Cas?” he calls out quietly, “You got your ears on you?”
“Hello, Dean.”
“Cas, I…” he began, unsure how to properly translate the complexity of his feelings into real, actual words. Feeling he had been raised to repress. Feelings that, honestly, still scared the shit outta him.
“Dean.”
Because Cas, for some reason beyond Dean’s understanding, had decided to love his dumb ass.
The truth was, Sam hadn’t known what to expect. He thought he had been ready to face his brother without guilt holding him back, but now he was second-guessing himself.
Dean frowns slightly, quickly glancing over his shoulder to double check. “Uh, yeah?”
Cas stays silent, watching Dean apprehensively as he paces.
“No,” he admits, holding himself straighter, “but I should.”
Dean can feel the shallow stinging in his hands as Cas’ damp skin pressed against the tiny, fragmentary cuts from exploded marble, but he tunes it out as he examines his friend's face. Cas has a split lip, a few minor nicks cutting over his handsome face, one rather nasty looking cut that managed to slice along his impressive cheekbone, and a splitting gash on his forehead. Dean’s thumb lightly brushes over the sticky, red blood that had run down Cas’ face, noting that the injury had stopped bleeding a while ago and was beginning to coagulate.
“I gotta say, that’s some shitty family dynamics you grew up with there, Cas.” Dean says, deflecting with humor out of habit.
Having said that, looking at the round pink face of their son wrapped up in a blue blanket made it all worth it. Judging by the way Eileen tiredly crossed her arms over her chest for the sign of “love”, she seemed to be of the same mind.
“Well, I have been around for a few millennia. I think I can wait another couple decades.”
Dean ran a hand through his cropped hair with a shaky breath. With everything he’d said, it felt like a weight slowly lifting off his chest. A tightly-closed bottle finally opening up. Yet he still lacked a sense of fulfillment. He tried not to linger on why.
“Yes, I’m frustrated. Stellar observation, Cas.”
“I like her.” She comments matter-of-factly, “She’s good for Sam.”
Dean inclines Cas’ gently sloping face to allow himself more access to those soft, chapped lips, eagerly pursuing the soft moans emitting from Cas’ throat with a hungry fervor. He feels a hand slip to the back of his neck, drawing him in closer and deeper. Dean’s knees threaten to buckle under the sweet, provocative sensation of kissing Cas, but it isn’t until the other man hisses at the contact of his split lip that Dean finds it in him to pull away.
The old girl was retired, same as Sam, and had been relocated to the detached garage for quite a few years. As much as he had tried to keep up with her maintenance and care, he didn’t have his brother’s mechanical touch. The golden rays of the afternoon sun streamed through the cracked window panes and settled softly over her glossy black hood. Sam rarely took her out for a leisurely drive, but he adamantly refused to let her rust away under his watch or sell her to someone else. He unlatched the car door, disrupting the thin layer of dust on the floor as he awkwardly shuffled his tall and stiff body through the door frame, groaning uncomfortably when his trick knee decided to act up.
“Yes, it is.” Cas urges without raising his voice. He steps into Dean’s personal space before adding, “And I think you know that.”
Failing to save the kid one final time.
“I let you down. I let you all down. You were my family too; I cared about you, about everyone. I should have used my privileges to protect you.” He continued with a grunt, eyes flickering close for a moment while the pain passed. When he opened them again, his tone was mirthless, “I ended up being just another ‘dickless Slytherin’ like you said.”
It was also recognized amongst the Hunting Community that Sam was off limits. This was mostly followed out of respect for Dean and their legacy. He and Dean had done more than enough for the world, and they had also lost the most. Everyone unanimously agreed: Sam Winchester had earned his retirement.
“Dean,” Cas sighs, instinctively reaching out to the hunter, “after all this time, after everything I said to you, do you really still believe that this was the ending you deserved?”
“Jack, I-”
Sam had already given up so much for Dean when they were alive. He knew, even when Sam kept it from him, how many damned times his brother had chosen him over and over again instead of the normal life he’d dreamed about as a kid.
Sam stared at the kid in wonder and awe, his chest filling up with emotion. Despite himself, he gets choked up and turns away. His adopted-son reaches out his hand and pats his shoulder gently, soft blue eyes watching him mindfully.
Besides, he could just see the self-satisfied look on his brother’s face if he ever cut it short.
Dean turns his head to face his mother. He notes the relaxed way she holds herself, the easy smile that graces her face, her whole demeanor softened by John’s love. It made her look younger and beautiful.
wasn’t prepared to deal with your feelings. Or what acknowledging those feelings would mean. For me.” He clarifies, clearing his throat before continuing, “Because if I did, I’d have no choice but admit that I cared about you in a way that guy friends just...don’t do. In a way I didn’t think you could feel. And I couldn’t deal with that knowing you were saying goodbye.”
Dean started to squint as the dimness began to slowly cover him, the fading sunlight glinting orange and pale gold off the jagged metal keys in his hand.
Sam wasn’t sure he could love her more than he already did. But he did.
“Cas-”
“Well, I’m sorry it was all for nothing. Looks like I was always meant to cash in early, huh?” he jokes, his tone flat and bleak.
He couldn’t say it. Not yet.
Dean’s lungs and heart hitch in his chest. The urge to backtrack, to downplay Cas’ words into a heat of the moment situation and not a confession he's fairly certain he is undeserving of, is vicious. He bites his tongue and the sharp pain somewhat deters the negative thoughts, clearing his head momentarily.
Mary presses her lips together, but doesn’t say anything.
fucking whimper like a lovestruck heroine in those sappy movies Sam liked to watch (that Dean honestly didn’t dislike as much as he protested). “Fuck, Cas…” he mumbles, inhaling deeply. He cradles the tanned wrists framing his face with a cautious touch. “You deserve it. You deserve to hear me say it back.”
“I have had many regrets in my life, most of which I no longer recall,” he confided, sincerely and confidently, “but loving you, Dean Winchester, has never been one of them.”
“I know I reacted poorly. I- fuck, I practically told you to take it back ‘cause
Well,
Dean chuckles at the absurd question, given the circumstances. Trust Cas to ask about his   well-being after months of no contact when he was the one laying in a desolate corridor, having had to defend himself against an army of pissed off Death Eaters. Dean knew he didn’t look like he’d just come back from a stroll in the park either.
“He would be proud of you, Sam. I know he would be.”
Finally seated, he slowly reached out to grip the steering wheel in front of him. The leather was worn and stiff under his hands, the edges digging into his palms as his grip tightened.
“Jack...why are you here? I mean don’t get me wrong, I’m glad to see you again kid,” he explained, “but just...why now?”
Was Jack always this wise when he was living with them? Or was this a by-product of becoming the new God?
“Dean Cave.” The older brother corrects him with a grunt.
Miracle had immediately made himself at home and took to laying in wait by Eileen's front door, leaving his post only to relieve himself in the front lawn shrubbery before dutifully returning. All day long, he laid there with big, dark eyes, head cocked on his paws, clearly listening for Dean’s familiar gait, waiting patiently for his best friend to come back. Even though Sam had tried to call him away, bribing him with treats, neither he nor Eileen had the heart to move him.
Surrounded by Cas’ heavenly heat, Dean comes with a swallowed groan, thick streaks of his seed spilling down Cas’ throat. Cas swallows with little difficulty, both hands firmly holding down Dean’s hips he finishes with an appeased shudder. He kneads his thumbs soothingly over Dean’s hip bones, pulling off slowly and deliberately to collect every last drop.
“Me too, Cas.”
“Thank you.”
“The...thrill of getting caught. Of being able to hide your position from Sam in plain sight. Being able to get away with it.” He presses languidly, voice low. His thumb brushes over the tip of Dean’s cock and smears built-up droplets of precum over the head, earning him a deeply appreciative sound from his partner.
The boys stood outside on Sam’s new porch, each with a beer in hand and watched the still blue sky, clouds being dusted in gentle pinks and purples. Dean’s eyes held steady on the horizon, face aglow with the warm rays of the setting sun. He was finally getting around to telling Sam about his meeting with Bobby, how Jack had sprung him from Heaven’s lock-up and made things right up here.
killed Hitler, or whether it was just all just a technicality.
“This is your last chance to change your mind, you know. Once you leave it’s going to belong to the Wayward Sisters.”
“I read, Sammy. Just because I don’t have a fancy-ass subscription to the New York Times doesn’t mean I don’t pick stuff up.” He responds dryly.
He had even found his peace in being dead, although he couldn’t get over
“Hmm, did that. Twice.” She held up two fingers, levelling them with an apathetic gaze. “But it didn’t work out. So I guess that means he’s stuck with me.”
He gently rocks the bundle in his arms, watching his son's tiny breaths as he sleeps soundlessly. A tiny pink fist was clenching open and close next to his face as though catching butterflies in his dreams.
The idea left an odd taste in his mouth. He grumbled to himself and closed Baby’s door shut, settling back into the driver’s seat.
“I’m sorry.”
Dean shifted uncomfortably, “Yeah well, it wasn’t just your burden to carry, Cas.”
Sam exited the car and looked at the property with a worrying sense of deja-vu. The last time he had pulled up in front of her house he had also been in a state of blind panic. Sure, Dean had been driving that night, but Sam was about as conscious of his surroundings then as he had been moments ago.
“Sam!” she cries out, a warm smile spreading across her face at his sudden appearance. “Sorry, I didn’t know you were coming. Must have missed your message.”
All too soon, the moment was over. Cas straightens suddenly, his previously calm demeanor shifting into a pensive one as he pulls himself out of their embrace, appearing rather reluctant to do so.
It was easier to shift the blame rather than deal with what was really eating him inside.
Like it was all a Djinn dream that Cas didn’t want to break free from.
“Yes, she is still tasked with overviewing the fundamentals that keep Heaven running.” He answered, clearly not thrilled about the development either. “We may have had our differences, but she wants what’s best for Heaven, same as Jack. Same as me. And she’s one of the only original angels left with the most experience running a fully operational simulation large enough to withstand all the souls in Heaven.”
His mouth twitched into a weary smile. Definitely not a demon possession then.
It had been a few days since Sam showed up at Eileen’s front door with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He doesn’t remember much after he crumpled into her arms and wept into her shoulder, silently screaming into her damp flannel shirt, and suffocating with each breath he took. Just that he woke up with her arms still around him.
In the Bunker, Sam stood alone at the side of the room, nursing a beer and observing the life around him. The mingling sounds of laughter, idle chatter, and a few shed tears bounced off the thick Bunker walls. He maps out familiar faces and the not-so familiar ones as people wander around, sharing their favourite hunting stories about Dean or arguing amongst themselves whether or not Dean Winchester had
The old man tried tirelessly to keep his eyes open and focused on the door to his room, but his mind isn’t as sharp as it used to be. He often finds his eyes wandering around the room, taking it all in; there on the shelf was his collection of spellbooks from the redhead witch, useless now to him, and next to them sat a little green plastic soldier rescued at long last from the Impala’s ashtray. After that came the diploma above the dresser, with grainy snapshots jammed into the corner of the mirror. Cards, books and letters from old friends long gone. Memories, all of them. He would do this until he remembered that he was supposed to be watching the door, turning his blinking gaze back to the door once more.
“No, not...not just about Jo.” Cas replies, tired blue eyes seeking out Dean’s and holding his gaze. “I’m sorry for not doing anything sooner. For not saying anything. You were right... there was a right and a wrong, and I knew it, but I continued to be an enabler and do nothing because it was... easier.”
“Asshole.”
“You know, I don’t think Dean would be too happy to see the car like this.”
That had been in the middle of the night. Dawn had long since broken across the horizon, sunbeams politely cutting through the dust and smoky haze settling around the castle.
“Relax, Sammy,” Dean snickered, waving a hand at his little brother and turning fully towards his open laptop, leaning against the wooden desk top and indicating that the conversation had run its course. “If he pops in again, I’ll send him your way. And I’ll tell him to wear his scandalous trench coat so you won’t be traumatized.”
Dean grunted, lightly pondering his brother’s question in his head until he realized that Sammy was expecting an actual answer.
“Oh, so…” he said leaning towards his wife, being mindful not to squish their newborn between their bodies, his tone teasing, “There’s going to be a next one?”
Dean laughs mirthlessly, straightening Cas’ blue tie. “Yeah, of course you do. Someone’s gotta keep an eye on that kid.”
But then what? When the ride was over and the journey ended, what did he have waiting for him at the end? Where was his
He’d seen Cas relaxed and unruffled more often than not the past, but this is the first time he’s really seen him like this: eyes closed, breathing deeply, complying wordlessly with Dean’s unspoken requests, the man practically putty in Dean Winchester’s hands, implicitly trusting the hunter. Finally giving in to the yearning. Finally able to act of his own free will. Finally allowing himself to believe this is something he can have.
That night, Eileen stayed with him on the couch.
When did Dean become so big? Or was it that Sam himself had become small?
“Fine. I’m- I’m fine Jack, thank you.” He coughed, sitting up straighter. “So, where is he? I mean, if I’m allowed to ask?”
“Dean-”
John and Mary, they had each other to look after now, to make up for all the time one family dinner couldn’t cover. Bobby no doubt had his wife to go back to, assuming that the kid hadn’t appointed him as Heaven’s greeter like some underpaid employee standing around awkwardly in the Walmart entrances. He hadn’t seen Jack, which was a bit of a letdown honestly. He practically helped raise the kid for three years and he couldn’t even get a “hello”?
Again, he waits patiently for the familiar sounds of the angel’s approach: the rustle of his ever so slightly too large trench coat and the crunch of gravel beneath his polished shoes walking towards Dean in a stride he had grown accustomed to. He shifts uncomfortably in the seat as the silence drags on, debating whether or not to continue.
The boy nodded cheerfully, “It’s good to see you again, Sam.”
Dean looks away from Sam, taking a swig of his beer. He feels a pull at his heart, the same one he’s been feeling all day when he thought about the angel. Ever since hearing Cas’ confession, Dean couldn’t stop interpreting all of Cas’ past actions and sacrifices for what they actually were.  Always putting himself in harm's way to protect Dean, always showing up by his side when he needed it most, always willing to bleed, fight and follow him to their certain death. Even when Dean pushed him away.
For a while, living in the Bunker with Dean had been one of the best experiences he shared with his brother. It was, as Claire had pointed out, a secret boys’ club for just the two of them. And then Kevin came along and made the place a little more exciting. Then there was Cas, choosing to stay with the Winchesters even after he recovered his Grace. Then Mary, and Jack, and eventually the refugees from Apocalypse World. Even when it went back to being just the two of them, the Men of Letters Bunker had a way of making Sam feel like a welcomed guest, but nothing more than that.
Within 10 minutes of the fight, Sam found himself unlocking the creaky backdoor and paying Baby a visit.
Finally, one night he broke down in front of her.
It’s not long before Cas’ mouth is on him again, sucking demurely on Dean’s red, drooling head before sinking down, his free hand pumping the remaining length. Dean can vividly feel the head of his cock rubbing heavy across Cas’ tongue as he sinks further towards his goal with every other bob of his head.
“You seemed to enjoy it, though.” The angel states, pulling Dean out of his thoughts.
“It does appear that way, yes.” He jokes, smiling at Dean apologetically.
“I’m good Cas. Nothing I can’t handle.”
Dean grunted affirmatively. They stood together in a comfortable silence, appreciating the reality of the moment.
The Roadhouse looked exactly as he had remembered it; the shaded interior, the muted colours of the well stocked bar against the dark oak tabletop, the rough paintwork, the din of rock music playing from the jukebox.
“I know I did, but you didn’t- forget it, that’s not the point here,” replies the hunter, trying to pick up the fallen pieces of his dignity.
“That does sound like you.”
“I never asked you to do any of that for me.” Dean amended sternly.
“I’ll see you soon, Dean.” Cas promises with a final nod.
Sam spotted a few more familiar faces as the night wore on; stopping to chat with Jody’s girls and hearing about Kaia’s first vamp kill, running into Bobby and sharing some short words of sympathy, even getting an opportunity to properly meet Charlie’s Stevie in an info-swap huddle. Eventually though, Sam ran out of excuses and knew he couldn't put it off any longer.
“You…how long were you listening?”
“You didn’t need to ask, that was the point.”
“Oh, so you just let me carry on then? That’s nice, that’s real great…” Dean accuses, dragging his hand over his face before crossing his arms defensively in front of him. Cas shifts his weight from side to side.
“I’m pretty good. Heaven is keeping me very busy, now that it’s under my care. Apparently it takes more than just deciding to change how Heaven runs, so there’s always something to do. Oh, and I’m making angels again! Proper ones this time.” He replies brightly. “I’m trying to do good, building a better place for humans to live in once they’ve done their best down here.”
Dean clenches and unclenches his hands into fists too. “Cas-”
Dean didn’t know how the hell he deserved Cas, but he sure as hell wasn’t going to take it for granted.
Dean shakes his head with a soft no. “No, Cas, you’re not. You’re different from the rest of them. You always have been. Because you came back.” He tells him, studying the man below him. “Just like I knew you would.”
And now, he was one of them.
Maybe that’s why he wasn’t so gung-ho about his “drive off into the sunset” plan.
Shit, he really had it bad for his best friend, didn’t he?
He was so lost in his thoughts that he almost missed the familiar tuff of messy dark hair in the adjacent Transfiguration corridor. The rubber soles of his shoes squeaked threateningly against the polished floor as he rounded the corner, his eyes fixed on the slumped figure leaning heavily against the jutting pillar.
“You left, but you didn’t give me a chance to stop you this time.” He gritted out. “And I couldn’t handle that. But I’m not really mad at you Cas, and I-I need you to understand that. I want you to know that it’s okay. That
For the first time in his long, convoluted life, Dean has something good to look forward to.
And fuck, the thought of getting caught should not be as thrilling as his dick seems to think it is.
He cleared his throat as he approached, giving them ample time to disentangle themselves before wrapping Eileen in a broad hug of his own.
“Go ahead,” she says, signing tiredly, “I understand what it means to you.”
And now they had all the time in the world.
So here we are, one month after the finale, tying up loose ends.
The taller Winchester inhales sharply. He required a moment to separate his thoughts from his feelings. He knew without a doubt that if Dean were there, the man would be insufferable, loudly congratulating the tired new mom, slapping Sam on the back, calling for shots and declaring himself the best, fun uncle this kid could ever ask for.
“I’m sure.”
If Cas tries to hide his relief with a shaky laugh, Dean says nothing about it, gently kissing the dark chocolate curls at the top of Cas’ head. His usually ruffled “bed sex” hair now in a complete and total state of disarray, the stuffy scent of soot and dust permeating Dean’s nose as he inhaled deeply, exhaling a gratuitous sigh.
Sam’s lips twitched into a quick smile. It had been well over 20 years since he had last seen the nephilim he once considered as a son. He was pleased to find that Jack had lost none of his boyish optimism and positive outlook on life.
Sam Winchester doesn’t need to see the Reaper waiting patiently near his bedside to know that his time is almost up.
His right hand gripped the soft, worn leather of the steering wheel in a vise and clenched his other hand into a fist. Dean could feel himself hovering at a threshold of something unspoken between them. Like a one-way trip off a cliff without a parachute. He knew if he kept going down this path, there would be no turning back.
All around him are memories of Dean, full of bad jokes, fortune cookie wisdom, and idiotic grins. Sam closed his eyes, letting his mind fill with their moments.
“That’s okay, we’ll work around it.” Eileen considered a moment before continuing, “Worse case, we just have to call him Junior.”
Cas hums distractedly, his hand stilling. He moves his head back and regards Dean sincerely.
This had proved to be the best solution for a number of reasons. For one, Garth and Bess turned out to be first-rate wedding planners and took care of most of the details. The only time Sam really had to step in was to politely decline their more... adventurously-themed suggestions based on their favourite book series (and Sam used that term very lightly). It was also, he realized, easier than showing up at city hall and explaining to the minister why Samuel William Winchester was wanted for several counts of mass muder, treason, possession of illegal firearms, credit card fraud, kidnapping and endangering an ex-President of The United States, and was considered legally dead by the United States census…three times.
Not entirely of course. Someone still had to keep Sammy from making stupid decisions, and he couldn’t expect Eileen to shoulder that burden for the rest of eternity alone. But Dean understood. Sam wasn’t his responsibility any more. There was no need for Dean to linger around like a mother hen.
“You always stood by me, even when I was in the wrong, even though I didn’t always show you the same respect. And I’m sorry,” he breathed, casting his eyes warily about. “I’m so sorry you felt that you couldn’t be honest with me about something so goddamn important. I’m sorry that...that I-I made you think you had to hide how you felt, just ‘cause I wasn’t equipped to handle the truth. ”
Dean moved to face him. Sam braced himself for the emotional impact.
Dean considers that last one for a moment. “Dead Sea Scrolls? Like,
Sam wouldn’t stop Eileen from hunting and doing what she felt was the right. In turn, she’d turn down any cases that would take her out of state or seemed risky out of respect for Sam. It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it helped ease the fear festering in his gut knowing she would never be too far for him to reach.
Because 15 years of character development shouldn't be erased or overlooked.
“Oh? What gave you that idea?” The hunter asks cockily.
Jack hadn’t aged a day, whereas Sam knew he looked older than he felt. No one had understood his desire to grow out his grey hair and not dye it. Even Eileen would gently tease him, calling it his “Old Man Party Town” wig. But Sam just couldn’t find it in himself to cut it.
The shorter Winchester regards his brother for a moment, practically hearing the gears turning in Sam’s head as his nerdy little brother tries to come up with a logical explanation. Because, c’mon, it was weird for Cas not to reach out to them already. Maybe Cas was overwhelmed with his new responsibilities like Dean had suggested, but the whole thing just seemed off to him. Even when Cas was fighting a civil war against Raphael, he still found the time to answer the Winchesters’ calls when they needed him. Hell, he was hexed by Rowena and hunted down by rogue angels, and still the idiot had called to make sure that Dean was okay.
Dean jerks his head to the side and makes a small, appreciative sound.
Cas nods, but Dean notices how his lips purse together and his brow furrows. Dean smirks proudly at the sight of the silently pouting angel still nestled between his legs, sliding his hand down from his hair to cup the underside of his stubbled jaw. He brushes the pad of his thumb fondly over the ridge of Cas’ defined cheekbone. “Does that make you jealous?”
“He’s beautiful,” Sam tells her, signing with one hand as he does. “Like his mom. Beautiful and sleepy.”
It would be so easy to jam the keys in the ignition, get Baby up and running and just leave. No plans or purposes or direction, just to keep on driving to his heart's content like he usually did. This Heaven had to be vast and teeming with life, full of places he had yet to explore. He could probably ride for miles and miles, leaving it all behind, and still be back in time for Sunday brunch with his folks.
Dean licks his bottom lip nervously and resists the urge to take a step back, trying not to look bothered by the sudden closeness.
“Yeah well...we survived a war. Puts things into perspective.”
He just wished that Dean had been here to witness it too.
