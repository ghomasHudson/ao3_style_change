"Hello Sam. I came in here to tell you that you should probably call Charlie back. Perhaps a baby shower would make us too happy. Can't risk it." Castiel turned to face Dean on the last words, then walked out the door again.
"Dude, he was trying to be funny! The one time he makes a joke and you can't even figure it out." Dean explained. Sam gave Dean bitchface #29.
"Love you too, babe." Dean hung up. Cas flopped down on the bed with a sigh and he felt the bind close as Dean drifted off to sleep. For once, Castiel wasn't tired. In fact he just wanted to do…something. Anything really. Then Cas sat up suddenly.
"Cas is starting to get a little bigger and he doesn't have any clothes that fit him any more. I almost passed out when he freaked. He is totally turning into a chick, worrying about his weight and stuff." Dean explained with a laugh. Sam chuckled and grabbed his wallet. Castiel came out from the room with a gray pair of sweatpants on, a large jacket and Dean's Led Zeppelin t-shirt. He shuffled up the stairs to the front door and turned to face the brothers.
"Hello Internet. I have been looking around some of the pages I follow, and apparently, you are all talking about an Impala67 video that came out yesterday,
"Dean, you do not need to witness this. Please wait in the main room for my arrival." Castiel said weakly, barely finishing before he choked up another stream of bile. Dean shook his head and knelt down beside Castiel. Dean had promised that he would always help Castiel with whatever he needed, and that included times that were more...well, gross than other times.
"Wow. Cas, they're beautiful. And Dean? We have to put the furniture in here soon. Wanna just do it now?" Sam asked. Dean nodded and kissed Castiel once before following Sam out to the garage to get the assembled cribs and the rest of the furniture. Another hour and the room was complete. Beneath each pair of wings was one of the cribs. The light carpet contrasted well with the red walls, each crib painted black. Inside Dean and Cas' room were two bayonets on each side of the bed. One came from Jody that she had recommended from dealing with her own son. The other was brought by Sam after Dean made him go to Babies R' US. Everything was ready for the twins.
"I didn't know that at all. I just thought that since you talk about Sam all the time in your videos, you only had him." Castiel said, still confused.
Dean woke up the next morning with cold sheets and no Cas through the bond. He nearly panicked, but he searched for the bond and found the golden spot pulsing heartily. Dean sighed in relief as he remembered the conversation from the night prior. Castiel was going to spend most of the day in the future nursery. Dean figured it was going to be some sort of angel ritual, like a baptism of the room. Never did he expect what was actually happening inside that small room.
"Dude, you hate cake. Why do you want to get him one?" Sam had asked from the passenger seat. They pulled into the parking lot of the grocery store and Dean looked at Sam.
He panted. Dean immediately searched through Castiel's Grace, hoping to find out what was going on. Dean found it at the same time Cas did. They looked at each other with wide eyes and gaping mouths.
Dean was lying in a chair, mostly limp, but still screaming. He had a drill through his eye, blood streaming down his face mimicking tears in their patterns. Naomi looked up and scowled.
"As you all know, I am not exactly one for dating, and while I understand that you ship Dean and I together...I have something to tell you all. I'm not...I don't date because I'm demisexual. I just don't care for the thought of sex for pleasure, and I would much rather know someone well before I get into anything. I don't know Dean all that well, so I don't think it will end up happening. I hope that you guys can understand where I'm coming from here, because honestly I just wanted you to know about me, about who I am. I love you all so much, and you have helped me through thick and thin, especially with my issues last year. I got so many cards and letters in the mail that I nearly cried, so thank you. If I end up losing followers for this video, so be it. But I hope that you will accept me for who I am truly, instead of who you think I am." Castiel gave a shaky sigh, his chest shaking a little bit.
A normal black screen turned into flashing white words, reading in large, bold font "RANT INCOMING", and after they flashed for a few seconds, the screen faded until Castiel's face was clear. He was clearly angry, his eyes a storm of blue and gray, making him look incredibly dark, despite the brightly lit room.
"Okay, I won't call, HER, a nephilim. But either way, we need to do some research about this. I just hope that there is some sort of precedent so we can figure out how long this will last and what we can expect." Sam explained. As he finished, Cas winced and held his abdomen again. Dean sent a stream of worry to Castiel and received a faint 'okay' feeling.
"Kinda formal, but okay." He repeated the line as Castiel placed his hands on Dean's shoulders, Dean automatically followed suit. Castiel started murmuring words in Enochian as his eyes blazed an electric blue.
Castiel turned sharply to look at Dean where he sat, ignoring the slight protest from his distended stomach. Sam had already left the room to call Charlie, so it was just the pair of them. Cas' eyes had their angelic fury that scared Dean still.
Sam ran up the stairs and outside to the car. When he came back, Castiel was standing at the table in the library. He was sobbing into the sleeve of his trench coat, a pitiful sight that made Sam sprint to the weeping angel and pull him into a hug, hesitant of the baby bump that protruded from the top of his pants.
"What do you mean, Dean? You killed her? Don't you remember going all 'angel' on her?" Sam asked, furrowing his eyebrows. Dean was surprised.
As the night progressed, Castiel lost track of the number of various shots he took, but the world was beginning to get confusing, especially when he couldn't see Dean or Sam anymore. He just kept drinking whatever was put in his hand, and he was beginning to ramble to Noah.
"I swear you two are the cutest freaking thing." Sam laughed. "But, Cas, seriously. What do you know about any of this?"
"Dean! Dean, answer me!" Sam yelled through the empty warehouse that Dean had been taken to by the witch they were hunting. Castiel was by his side with a long knife and a worried expression. "Cas, can you hear him?"
"Oo, Charlie, you better watch out. Cas is pretty defensive of his Oreos. I wouldn't be surprised if he smites you in your sleep." Sam kidded. Cas shuffled into the room and into Dean's side.
"Your wings are very flashy. Whats that all about?" Dean asked, laughing a little when Cas rolled his eyes at the hunter.
Cas walked in the bar and went straight for the counter. A blonde woman was tending the counter, she looked at Castiel with a soft brown gaze.
"Sammy, it's Cas. We...we don't know what is going on. He fell asleep earlier and just before that he puked his guys out. He said that there is something in his Grace." Dean said, looking at his brother. Sam immediately dropped to his knees and looked into Cas' eyes.
"Aww, don't pout. Come on, we have one last question to do. What's your worst fear? I'm going to say that your worst fear is..." Dean's face softened a bit when he saw Castiel's face, which was a bit desperate. Turns out this would be a deep video as well as a fan pleaser. "Judgement."
"No, I believe the Chef Digiorno made the frozen part. I simply heated it per his instruction." Castiel explained. Dean laughed and placed a kiss on the crown of Cas' head before sitting down and eating. The trio ate in comfortable silence, Dean and Cas didn't even talk to each other through the bond, they were too tired and content with the quietness to let it leave.
Upon Castiel's reorientation into the world of the living, which was so cruelly called 'waking up', he noticed a searing pain in his mind, his ass, and in his heart. Cas' eyes flung open when he realized that he could be in the clutches of Noah still, since he could feel a warmth beside him, and he looked around, the darkness in the room not telling him anything. He stumbled to one of the two doors that were in the room, crying out when the pain in his thighs suddenly became present as well. He opened one of the doors, and he found a bathroom, which he staggered into. He shut and locked the door behind him, since he knew he had startled whoever was in bed with him.
" Dean yelled, worry and disbelief tainting his mind. He stopped immediately after he felt a surge of fear coming through the bond.
"I did once. Amelia dragged me to one when I was with her. It was really boring, but I learned a bit." Sam said, getting the bags. Charlie came from around the corner and saw them. She broke into a grin and went to help them.
They paid the appropriate people and got in line to board the plane. Dean looked at Castiel with a look of desperation. "Please make sure we stay together? I don't think I could do this alone." Dean said in a small voice, and Castiel just smiled.
"Well now this just won't do, will it? Three men, one of whom is practically dripping power, a devilishly handsome one, and a gentle giant. Where the hell did you scrounge up this group, Dean?" The witch sneered. Dean pulled at the ropes desperately.
. Dean thought, winking at the angel that was already up. Castiel rolled his eyes as Dean laughed again.
"Can...you choose something else? I don't know if I would be comfortable with that." Dean mumbled. Castiel frowned, about to ask, when Dean shook his head. "Never mind, it's fine, I guess. I've just never told anyone about my fear, so all you people out there should count yourselves lucky." Dean gave a smile, shoving away his old thoughts almost visually. Castiel's eyes just got even more narrow, so that they were almost closed while he wrote down his answer.
"Because darling, I've got a hell of a gift." He crooned before vanishing with a quick smile. Sam looked up and down the halls, then closed the door.
. Dean went over to his chair and kneeled down in front of him. He took the muscle in his hand and began to rub the sore leg. Castiel sighed in relief, filling Dean's mind with gratitude. Dean gently sent a nod back and a genuine smile before helping the angel to his feet.
"Not when I am the hand maiden. I made it the most manly position ever." Dean scoffed. Then he clapped his hands and looked around. "So, are you ready to see your presents, Cas?" Castiel's eyes widened in shock.
Dean was not prepared for the shower. He had been to one in Cicero with Lisa, but even then it was completely boring and he didn't pay any attention to how or why everything happened.
"Makes sense. I would do the same thing if my girlfriend was out of town. Is he away on business?" She asked, looking honestly curious. Castiel thought for a second.
"Don't sit up, you have three broken vertebrates and a fractured sternum." Castiel said, which stopped everyone in their tracks. Dean inhaled sharply as Sam winced and lied back down.
Though the tone was rough, it was slightly slurred by sleep. It almost made Dean laugh at the light waves of annoyance hitting the back of his mind.
Cas smiled even wider and finished unwrapping Dean, leaving the bow on his head and over his mouth. Dean got up and helped Cas up as well, and they walked back inside. Dean kept his arms at his side and a straight face.
"Yeah, I really hoped to keep this a secret. Well, at least to the bad guys." Dean said, Castiel murmuring an agreement. Dean leaned down to get eye level with Castiel's stomach. "Daddy is going to keep you safe sweetheart. No worries." He cooed, planting a kiss on Cas' stomach. Cas blushed wildly as red hot embarrassment painted his mind. Sam cleared his throat and frowned.
"Sam! Get your ass in here now!" Dean yelled out to his brother as he kept his gaze on the distended stomach of his husband. Castiel had a look of absolute shock painted across his face as he put a hand on his abdomen. Dean followed suit and placed a hand beside Cas'. There were two distinct fluttering heartbeats coming through the skin and fabric.
The video screen opened with a familiar face, but it was almost unrecognizable with the way it looked. Red eyes, blotchy cheeks, bitten lip, but most prominent was a bruised nose and black eye on the normally happy man most called Dean.
on the top. Dean thought for a second and asked the baker if he could write something else on the cake. The baker and asked what he would like to be on it. Dean smiled and told him, causing the baker to smile as well. The cake went into the white box and Dean payed for it. He met up with Sam at the exit, and Sam had a bag that was opaque, so there was no telling what was inside. When he asled what it was, he only received a shake of the head, so, in turn, Dean did not allow Sam to see the cake he got. Seemed fair.
"Her name is Bridget. She's my hand maiden in Moondoor. Sorry, Dean. I needed a new one after you left." Charlie explained. Dean mocked a pout and Cas looked at Dean.
"No. But I am not most angels, so it may be some sort of human sickness that is lightly affecting me. Do not concern yourself with it. I am sure it is nothing." Dean snorted at the statement, looking over at his boyfriend.
"Don't blame yourself though, Cas. It is never the victim's fault. It's the rapist's fault for being a complete dick and waste of living space." Dean spat, letting Castiel lean on him, knowing that he needed it. "You couldn't have stopped him. He would have gotten you there one way or another, but that's because he's awful, not because of anything you did or didn't do."
“I am hurt.” Tan said with a frown. “I know it sounds boring, but I promise that when you shop with me, it will be far superior to normal shopping. I just want to show you how to put an outfit together.” Plus he wanted to get the lowdown on Cas and potentially try to convince him to say something while they were alone.
Dean sang to Cas. He heard the sharp inhale of breath as he received it, which caused Dean to smirk.
"No. That means that there is something wrong and I need the sleep to fix it." Castiel replied, much to the shock of Dean.
"DEAN! Are-you-okay?" Castiel asked between kisses peppered along Dean's face. Dean nodded, but then paled as he saw the blood around his stomach.
“Hello! And welcome to yet another episode of IntriguedAssbutt and friends! About two weeks ago, I had none other than TheGirlWithTheDungeonsAndDragonsTattoo, Ms. Charlie Bradbury, and we did the blindfolded makeup challenge, and she really made my eyes pop with that mascara.” Castiel batted his eyelashes playfully, then he laughed. “Or, maybe not. Anyway, I have another guest today, and it’s someone brand new to me! Why don’t you show yourself?” Castiel grinned.
She got cut off by a hand pushing down on her forehead. Light streamed out of her eyes and gaping mouth before she slumped to the floor. Cas stood in front of the body for only a moment before making his way over to Dean to untie him.
"I swear. One day you are going to be just staring at each other, then one of you is going to end up bent over the table. And I will ask Cas to blind me." Sam muttered to himself as he walked out of the room. Dean just kept a goofy grin on his face.
"Don't go too fast there." The man chuckled, watching Cas' throat as it worked around the liquid to get it down as quickly as he could. "I'm Noah, by the way." He said, swallowing down another comment, and Cas nodded, taking another shot, used to the way that his angelic Grace would quickly eliminate any foreign threat, such as alcohol. He had only gotten drunk that one time because of his failing powers and the use of so much liquor at once.
"He wants to come back, but I don't know when he'll make another video...so I guess we'll all see. Thanks guys, and wish him well."
"I think that'd be the best for the baby. And, also...you really want to keep hunting? I mean...Cas, you are pregnant, and wouldn't hunting hurt the baby?" Sam asked, furrowing his brow. Dean put an arm around his mate's waist and pulled him close.
"I love you, Cas. You're going to do great. I know it." Dean said, placing a chaste kiss on Castiel's forehead and getting up. "What do you guys want for dinner? Burgers?"
"Its there, just a bit dormant. See if you can find it." Dean nodded and closed his eyes. He searched through his brain and found a little golden spot that pulsed with power and just something that screamed
"You want the same thing, or something stronger?" Noah inquired immediately, and Castiel, who had suddenly felt a wave of dizziness hit him, just nodded again. When the dizzy spell cleared, he still noticed how out of focus things were getting, but after some thought, things went back to normal and he didn't feel that anymore.
"As I'll ever be." Then, they were gone. In a mere second, they appeared again in a large field. There was a man in the distance flying a kite, but other than that, it was empty. Sam landed hard, but kept upright. Castiel, however, fell immediately after stopping. There was blood streaming from his nose as he struggled to sit up. Sam knelt down as pulled him so he could look him in the eye. "Cas? Are you okay?"
"I win. You tell her." He smiled, resting a hand on his belly. Sam looked at him and at his still out stretched hand. Dean could not stop laughing, his face growing red. He was gasping by the time Sam had begun to pout. Castiel leaned back in the chair and folded his hands over his abdomen. Contentment was flowing through the bond, double sided in a orange glow. At that moment, Dean became worried.
Dean's mind filled with hurt, anger and complete and utter betrayal. Castiel tried to send reassurance, but it was hastily tossed aside.
"Just leave them alone! You have me! Just leave them." Dean growled. She scoffed and ran a hand across his face.
"I do not understand what happened, but be assured Dean, I am perfectly normal now." Castiel assured him, stroking his thumb with his own lazily.
handicap yourself." Castiel said, sarcasm trying to worm its way into the words. Cas touched his two fingers to Sam's head and Dean could feel Cas' Grace gather and push through his fingers into Sam. Sam gasped and sat up.
"Cas, when you are done, come out and show me please?" Dean called out. He heard a grumble from behind one of the doors as it opened to reveal Castiel with the jeans on and the long sleeved polo covering his growing baby bump. Sam came from around the corner with a heap of clothing draped over one arm.
"Could you please wait until we finish before you jump each other?" Sam groaned. Castiel blushed and went back into the changing room. They ended up getting him four new shirts and two pairs of pants. Cas insisted on getting another trench coat since his would soon be too small. They got back to the bunker and immediately, Dean followed Cas to their room.
"A surprise baby shower? How does that work? But, yeah. I think that'd be good. When did Charlie say that she was coming?" Dean asked.
"You are not Dean. You...are a thing that is wearing my beloved's skin." Castiel spat as he stood up, fuming. He felt his wings expand in the space that humans could not see, but feel. Not-Dean shrunk back with wide innocent eyes.
The mouse scrolls down a few clicks so there is only writing on the page, and no titles or other links. Dean squints at the screen, and gasps. "Wait, do we not get together in this?" Dean asked, as though he was worried it wouldn't happen. "I thought this was supposed to be fanfiction! Doesn't it always end up happy? Listen to this!
"No way. And why is a black room a bad thing?! It think it would kick ass!" Dean steamed. Sam laughed and looked at the color choices.
It took nearly two weeks of non-stop watching, but they finished the series and the three men sat back in their seats with gaping mouths.
"As you both know, I am going to go into labor any day now. On that day, I am going to be in agony, most likely. Whatever I will say, I will not mean. Also, the pain will last anywhere from four to thirteen hours. The babies will detach themselves from my Grace and appear in Dean's arms since he is the father. Sam, you will need to be in the room to take the first baby quickly so Dean can catch the second." Castiel explained gently. Sam nodded and looked at Dean.
"Thank you guys. This has been a wonderful day. I think I will take Dean to our room now. Have a nice evening." Castiel said after cake and talking. Well, Dean remained still beside Cas, and he never spoke out loud through the entire party. But talking through the bond? That was different story.
“I don’t exactly know what there is to learn. The three of us are all in the same line of work, and we work together whenever possible. That’s pretty much it.” Cas shrugged. “Dean once tried to take me to a strip club.” He had once called it a den of iniquity, but had since learned about the actual name of it.
"DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT I MEAN? If we do this, not only would be bonded for this lifetime, but your soul would literally be binded to mine until it withered away when I did. Which won't be for another three millennium!" He shouted at Dean. Dean straightened and turned his smile into a tight line.
"Cas, you gotta heal him. His brain is fried from her. Use your mojo." Sam said, hoping it would be that simple.
"Get away from them!" Sam shouted, brandishing his shotgun. She laughed and muttered a few words of Latin before Sam went flying across the room, landing in a heap of used boxes.
"I know that you were in Hell. You are the one that caused this entire mess." She hissed at him, strapping him to the table as usual. "So now, you are being punished again. And you are helping Heaven. The children you fathered could be the decimation of the angel species. Do you honestly think I would let them live?" Naomi's mouth curled into a cruel smile.
Castiel practically fell over, his knees buckling, but Dean was able to catch him before he hit the ground.
"Castiel Novak, do you take Dean Winchester, as your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, for better and for worse, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live?" Castiel sniffed.
Wait, why does loving me make him angry?" The man asked, his brow furrowed in both confusion and in a slight pout. "
"Great. Call her back and tell her the plan, then have her come immediately. You and I will go out and get supplies." Dean decided. Sam nodded in agreement and grabbed his phone.
Castiel flung himself into the shower and turned it on as high and as cold as it would go, sitting in the bathtub and sobbing into his hands, hearing a pounding on the door, which not only frightened him, but made him angry. Why had Noah hurt him like that? He had seemed so nice, so kind, and yet something had happened that had made the human want to harm Cas. He didn't understand it.
"No, you listen to me, Becky! I either get my event back or the money goes back to the fans!" Castiel could hear Dean snapping at the poor lady on the other end of the phone, and he just kept walking past the room and to his own. Castiel closed the door and peeled off the jogging attire he had donned for the early morning, slipping into some comfortable jeans and a t-shirt. He had already packed everything he needed besides his phone and laptop, so he didn't need to worry about hurrying to pack. Castiel opened up his laptop and checked his sub count and his page. Castiel raised his eyebrow when he saw that he had just hit six million subscribers. Castiel grinned widely and opened a new tab to check out his Tumblr.
This chapter is going to be formatted a little bit differently, as it won't be a video. It'll be kinda like a regular fan fic. You'll see. I know it's been awhile since I updated, but I was just looking over it and figured I could add to the chapters. TW: Depiction of a panic attack
"Is that...two heartbeats? Which means...you guys are having twins?!" He shouted, standing up suddenly. He grinned and crushed Dean in a Sasquatch hug.
"I get it that you haven't seen Cas in awhile Dean, but that doesn't mean you can break the 'no sex in front of Sam' rule." Sam scolded playfully. He went and hugged his brother tightly. "It's good to have you back."
"I will be in a moment. Just...hold on." Cas panted, trying to catch his breath. A light came from his eyes and mouth. Sam shut his eyes and waited for the light to subside. In front of him was Castiel in his normal attire...but he had no baby bump to speak of, and yet he was smiling.
"Aww, does the widdle Deanie feel sad? Did I hurt your widdle boyfriend?" She cooed in a mocking voice.
The whole thing went much smoother than Dean had imagined. He did throw up once or twice, but he lived, and that was the most important part.
"Okay, so now I'm going to go off on my own rant separate from the video I just watched." Castiel said, the screen just showing him now.
"Oh, Dean. When will you ever learn? Everyone you ever cared about has died. Why should these boys be any different? And before you freak out, of course I know about your life. First there was Mommy and Daddy, then your little friends Jo and Ellen, and last but not least is your weirdo friend, Bobby." She purred in a sinister voice. Dean felt his heart breaking at the mention of his family. She saw this and grinned evilly before continuing. "I was in your head, and man, it was truly messed up. There was a name though, Cas. Must be the guy I just killed. Poor widdle Deanie. So afraid and all al-"
"I have loved you since I first laid eyes on you. I tried to hide it from myself for years, attempting to bury it under duty. But finally, you opened my eyes and now, I practically flew down the aisle. I am tired of you not being loved, so I am taking the job, now and forever. I love you. More than you can ever imagine, and you will always be the man that I put back together and fell for." Castiel finished, and even though Sam and Garth say otherwise, Dean did NOT cry. Cas took the black ring and grabbed Dean's hand. He slid the ring onto Dean's finger, fitting exactly right. The minister looked between them and smiled.
"Okay, I can see those as being your favorites. And I was decently close. Around the same time, right?" Castiel asked, and Dean chuckled.
"Thanks Sammy." Charlie gave a hug to Cas and Dean, stopping to comment on how well she put together Cas, then the pair left. Castiel was lying on the bed with a great big smile and a suggestive wink.
"As many of you know who follow Impala67, Dean...he's in a bad place right now, and how the fuck could you do that to someone as nice as him? I've known him for awhile now, and I've never once thought of any reason to hurt him, physically or emotionally. Benny Lafyette, whoever the fuck you are, you are directly out of the seventh circle of Hell, you know that?" Castiel snarled at the screen. "Dean deserves better than you could ever give him, and you hurt him because you didn't have the balls to be serious."
Do I die in this?" Dean asked, his face horrorstriken. "Please tell me I don't die in this, because that would suck major ass."
Dean searched the screen for some sort of sign that he would survive the story, and he sighed in relief as he found out that it was Castiel who saves him in the end, and they find out that everything was a huge misunderstanding.
Castiel covered his mouth as he realized that Dean was dying in the story, and his eyes went wide. "What?! No, no Dean can't just die! It was just a misunderstanding! They belong together!" He cried out. "Who the fuck wrote this shit!" He shouted at the screen, and finally, he found out that it all ended with him saving Dean. "Oh my god, we lived! And we ended up together!" Castiel grinned. "Okay, I got waay more into that than I should have." Castiel admitted, his cheeks turning slightly red.
"Big no no, hot stuff. I was going to be gentle, but you've forced my hand." He whispered in Castiel's ear before trailing sloppy kisses down the column of Cas' throat. Cas was frozen, he couldn't find the strength to pull away, even though he was disgusted by the man. His Grace told him to smite the man, he was a threat to Castiel and the babies' safety, so kill him. The humanity inside Dean's mind that had rubbed off on Cas said to take him to the police for justice. Then the man's hand moved from Cas' wrist to between his legs, and that decided it. Castiel's eyes blazed white and the man was suddenly on the other side of the alley, pinned to the wall by an invisible force that was Cas' Grace. The man immediately sobered, eyes blown wide in fear. "What are you?" He cried out, shaking.
It was beginning to get towards the end of June, which meant it drew closer to month ten. Castiel wasn't worried, he knew that the babies would come when they were ready to detach themselves from his Grace. Dean, however, was constantly worried. Whenever Cas winced from a slight pain or kick, Dean was either on his feet immediately or running into the room.
Everyone at the table laughed beside Dean and Cas, and Dean sighed and smacked his face. “C’mon, Cas. I’ve told you that you don’t need to tell people about that. Sorry, guys. He’s… not the best with social cues.” Castiel seemingly had an idea that he decided to roll with.
"Well, can you get us to Heaven? Both of us?" Sam asked, hoping the answer was yes. Cas furrowed his eyebrows and thought for a moment.
"Hi little one! You're getting bigger, aren't you? But don't worry because we love you very much." Dean said out loud. He placed a kiss on Castiel's belly button and stood up. Dean wrapped his arms around his husband and leaned down to kiss him too. Cas smiled and sighed happily. The bond glowed a joyful pink and warm amber contentment.
"Nope! September 18th." Castiel pronounced proudly. "I like it, because it's still warm from summer, but it's just cool enough to be happy. Plus the leaves are starting to fall and the Pumpkin Spice Latte comes out at Starbucks."
“Thank you,” Castiel said at last. “That… actually means a lot to hear. Sincerely, thank you.” He smiled warmly, eyes crinkling at the corners, and Tan smiled back.
Dean cleaned up before Castiel got back, and he held out a bottle of water to his roommate when Castiel sat down at the table. Castiel nodded at him and took a swig, sighing and panting still.
"Hello Dean." She said. "I am here about Castiel and the...thing he is carrying." Her face twisted into a scowl when she said the word 'thing'. Dean ran over to her and pinned her against the wall.
"Of course you do, sweetheart. I'll make sure you feel so much better by tomorrow mornin'." Noah drawled, and he pulled Castiel from his seat, letting Cas lean against his side as the alcohol and...whatever else was making Cas feel so out of it, took hold of his capability for motion. Castiel stumbled over his own feet as Noah led him through the crowd, his hand firmly on Castiel's backside the entire time. Castiel couldn't help but want to speak out about it, but his tongue weighed more than a million pounds at the moment, and speech was simply not possible.
"Cas! You ok?! Cas! I'm coming in!" Dean yelled as he came in. He took in the sight if the angel crouched over the toilet, puking his guts out, hot tears threatening to fall.
"Where did Dean go?" He heard Cas ask with confusion dripping into Dean's mind. Dean almost told him where he was, but he realized it would be worth it to see his surprise.
Castiel bent and pressed a final kiss to Dean's lips and then tried to get up. Dean laughed when he saw Cas struggling, but helped him up and hugged him. Castiel nuzzled into Dean's neck affectionately. Sam coughed as he saw the pair getting closer and closer.
Cas widened his eyes, as he remembered that the witch had tossed Sam like a rag doll across the room. The two ran over to where Sam was trying to get up, rubbing his head.
"What has been the matter with you recently, Dean? You have distanced yourself very much. In fact, we have not had intercourse in over a week. You broke our bond for now ten days and their is no sign that you will open it back up. What has happened?" Castiel pleaded. Dean looked at him calmly and frowned.
"I now pronounce you married by law and under God. You may kiss your husband." Dean grabbed Cas' face and crushed it to his, feeling the bond blooming open with senses going wild. Castiel's hands found their way around Dean's neck as they exchanged thoughts. They pulled away and Dean grinned.
Cas pulled Dean to him and gave him a long kiss, giving Dean all his feelings and love through the bond, he also threw in a thank you.
“I get what it is like to be raised in a family like that. And Bobby understands going against the church. It's hard, especially when it is all you know. But it is important to realize who you are despite it all. You decide who you are, not anyone else.” Tan told him, and Castiel looked at him up and down. He was a good man. All of them were. No one had ever told him that. Dean had always told him to rebel or do stuff for himself, but he had never specifically talked about his identity. He supposed it was too “chick-flick” for Dean.
Castiel frowned, though, as he watched the video progress. "Do we end up getting together? I seem really sad. I don't think I've cried like that since...high school." Castiel said. "Wow, Dean seems really upset that we aren't getting together." He noted with an even deeper frown etched into his face. "It's just a story."
"CAS! The...the baby! Is...is she?" Dean whispered, not being able to finish his sentence. Castiel shook his head and took Dean's hands.
"Sorry Charlie, I think Sam already claimed that title." He joked. Sam rolled his eyes but pulled his brother and his mate into a hug. Charlie joined in until Dean pushed out of the embrace. "Enough hugging for one day!"
"Cas had an angelic mood swing when Charlie ate one of his Oreos." Dean explained. Sam winced jokingly.
"Hell if I know! I've never done this before." Dean exclaimed, pulling into the garage. Sam chuckled lightly and got out of the car and went to the back.
"Cas...they're incredible. Are their wings going to look like that?" Dean managed to choke out in amazement. Castiel nodded and hugged Dean from behind, his abdomen pressing against Dean's back.
"Hellllooooo, hot stuff. What brings someone like you to a place like this?" The drunk slurred. Castiel furrowed his brows and scooched away from him a little.
"I told you you would do something you would regret. Please, leave before I ha-" Cas was cut off by the crash of the drunk's lips to his. He smelled of whiskey and tried to pry Cas' mouth open with his tongue. Castiel pushed him away hastily and wiped his mouth. He then reared back and punched the man. He staggered back and held his face. He looked up and spat some blood from his mouth to the side. Then, he strode unbelievably fast to Castiel and pinned his hands against the wall of the alley.
It happened incredibly fast. One second his mind was filled with happiness and contentment, then it was like someone turned on a faucet. White hot pain stemming from Castiel poured through the bond, knocking Dean to the ground, sending popcorn spilling across the hard wood floor. Cas snapped the bond off, not wanting Dean to feel the pain as well. Dean felt the relief of losing the pain, but it was replaced quickly by concern for his mate.
"Hi, babe. I'm sorry about everything earlier. I was being a dumbass." Dean apologized, mumbling into Castiel's neck as he hugged him.
"You keep praying for Castiel, and yet you know he will not come. Why do you do this?" Naomi asked one day before the daily torture. Dean laughed weakly.
The next morning the brothers took all of their things they needed and drove to the church. Dean ensured to call Charlie and made sure that they were on time and also headed to the chapel to get ready. Once they got there, Sam turned into a 'best man-zilla' and tried to make everything perfect. He made certain that Dean's black tuxedo with the dark green shirt and gold tie was spotless, Dean's hair was perfectly combed, and that the corsage of a white rose was perfectly pinned to Dean's breast pocket.
"Thanks. Went on a longer jog than normal. Saw you texted but didn't see what was up." Castiel said between breaths, and Dean sat down across from him.
Castiel sent Dean an image of a movie all about chickens, which made Dean laugh loudly and kiss Cas on the nose.
"Surprise!" Charlie and Sam yelled in unison. At the same moment, Dean opened the bond and whispered an apology for closing it, then he smiled.
Wasn't there supposed to be a specific time when they did a signing in front of the panel hall? Dean looked over the plan again, still not seeing it. Dean texted Cas saying "
“Ohhhh. I think it’s time for a group hug!” Jonathan got up out of his chair beside Sam and went behind Cas, wrapping his arms around him and giving him a squeeze and the other four followed, basically dog-piling Castiel in his chair with a warm, but awkward, hug. He smiled bashfully and glanced in Dean’s direction as the Five dissipated and returned to their seats.
Sam chuckled nervously. “I’ve never brushed my hair. I wish I had an answer for you. That’s just… how it is.”
"It seems that something I thought utterly impossible has just come true. Dean," Castiel said, looking into the hunter's eyes with a sad look. "I am carrying a nephilim." Sam nearly fell over and Dean just stared at his new mate.
"Hang on a sec, I gotta take these to Cas. Actually, you should probably come with me. He's pretty excited to see you." Dean told her as they made their way into the bunker.
It wasn't much longer that they walked until they got to the bar, and almost right away, Dean was pulled in by some group of scantily clad women, who were all drinking varying drinks that ranged from bright green to almost black in color. Their makeup seemed plastered on, with bright red or pink lips, as well as glittering eyelids. Castiel was nearly sucked in as well, but the long red nails that grasped for him were either pried off or avoided as he stumbled to the actual bar of the establishment. Sam rolled his eyes at his brother, and patted Castiel on the shoulder before he went off to find someone to talk to as well, leaving the ex-angel alone.
"Ugh. I am huge." Cas declared, cradling his belly tenderly, but scowling at it. Dean laughed and kissed his husband.
That was it. No additional information below it, besides the basic date and links to IntriguedAssbutt's pages on various websites. It was especially worrying, since it had been weeks since the last video. And the last video had been the vlog with Impala67.
"Good morning Dean. Sam, I would appreciate if you abstained from calling me human. Please? Though, I enjoy the term 'my angel', Dean." Cas said politely between bites of cereal. Sam shrugged, and Dean blushed through the bond.
"Sam!" Cas yelled as the random angel lunged at the Winchester. Sam side stepped with precision and stabbed at the angel's chest. White light poured out of his wound and features as he fell to the ground. Sam looked up at Castiel who was fighting off another angel. Castiel pierced her and she fell to the floor, wings searing the ground. Another of Dean's screams rang out and Castiel and Sam broke into a sprint again. They came to a room that was obviously locked. Cas could feel the pain of his mate as he was so close to him. It was unbelievable that Dean had lasted this long, let along had the strength to give back the remarks to Naomi's questions. Sam knelt down to the lock and started to pick it and Cas looked up and down the halls for more threats, but found none. A click rang out as the door unlocked, Sam opening it hastily.
"How did you like the pres-woah. Dean?" Sam said, seeing Dean with the bow still placed precariously on his head and over his mouth. Sam spat out the beer he had just taken a sip of and fell to the ground, clutching his sides in laughter. Charlie came out of the kitchen with the cake box at that moment, and she hurried across the room and put it down and joined Sam on the ground, gasping for air. Dean looked annoyed, but didn't remove the bow. It was Cas' day today.
"Am I missing something between the two of you? Because I feel like you are having your own conversation of something." Sam said, looking between his brother and his...brother in law?
"Cas! Cas! Cas, calm down, shhh...it's me. It's Dean!" Dean tried to say gently, but he ended up shouting over Cas' sounds of terror. Cas barely heard it, but something registered, and he opened his bloodshot eyes.
"Whatever your 'gift' is, we don't want it. I guess you'll have to return it." Dean snapped in Crowley's direction. The demon shook his head and looked at Cas' abdomen.
"Well, you guys aren't technically married, just mated. Have you ever thought of making it official?" Sam asked. That made Dean and Castiel turn in attention.
"Damn, babies are freaking expensive." Dean mused as he walked outside to put the large bags and boxes in the trunk. Sam laughed.
"I'm fine Dean. I just got up too fast. Now, what was it you wanted to show me?" Cas asked. Dean led him out and covered his eyes. Cas struggled to get him off. "Dean! Stop it! You don't have to do that! I'll just close my eyes if you don;t want me to see it!"
"Yeah, the bond thingy gave us a telepathic connection. I can hear his thought and he can hear mine." Dean grinned as he finished the sentence. Sam rolled his eyes and looked back at Cas.
"Yeah, that would be shitty, huh?" Dean said, nudging Cas' arm before whistling and taking the lead again. Sam nearly glared at his brother before he dropped back to walk with Cas.
"Uh, hi. Listen, I don't know much about making videos, but Dean had to go, so he asked if I could take over. He's...he's going through a lot right now, with Dad, and with Benny...I'm glad he's getting everything out, don't get me wrong...but please, send him all the love you can. He needs it." Sam said, his hazel eyes filled with concern and nothing but love for his brother.
Cas replied with a hasty snap of the bond. The golden spot in Dean's mind pulsed with anger and hurt. While it mad Dean unhappy that he was doing this to Cas, he hoped it would be worth it to see his reaction. Dean met Sam in the garage and got into the Impala. Sam leaned down and looked through the window.
." Charlie yelled into the phone, not exactly mad, just so excited that her voice was coming out extremely loud.
"Yes, but the ceremony is much like human marriage in that it needs a witness and I need a blessing from usually the father, but in this case, your brother will do." Castiel explained, weary of what Dean was going to say. Dean began to laugh.
"Yes, Naomi." The fake Dean said before watching her vanish along with the mess it had made with the skin. He then walked down the hallway and met up with Sam. After talking with Sam for awhile, Castiel found them in the library with a worried expression.
"Hello everyone! I know it's been a long time, and I owe you something good. So I hope this will do. I've spent the last few weeks with Dean and Sam in Kansas, since Dean got hurt, and...well we decided that it would be best if we moved in together. I had an extra room, and Dean was looking for a place to stay. Sam is in California now, so it seemed like the best option. I'm sure you're all raving about it, but don't get any ideas. We're good friends, and this will help us. We're both messed up, and it will help us get better, help us move on from our past." Castiel explained, and that was when Dean's face peeked in from the door.
"Dean, calm down. I just wanted to make sure you were serious. I didn't want you to back out as soon as I said no. But, of course I support you! Your my brother. Even if you are a jerk sometimes." Sam said with a smile. Dean was taken aback and let go of Sam immediately. Castiel poked his head in the room and made his way inside.
"Yeah, let's just go to bed." He took off his flannel so he was just in a soft t-shirt, and he went into the bathroom to change into his pajama pants while Castiel did the same.
"Crowley." Dean growled as he turned to face the demon. Castiel turned with a similar look of anger tainting his features, as well as the bond. Crowley looked at the pair with a cocky smirk, his hands folded together beneath his chin.
"Its great to see you too, Cas. And actually, I have some news for everyone. I met someone!" Charlie squealed. Dean smiled and gave her a big hug.
They planned on not having a reception, but Cas and Charlie begged otherwise, so they ended up in one of the hotel rooms. The pushed all of the furniture to the side of the room and got some food and Sam's iPod for music. Dean had managed to put some good music on there, besides the crap he listened to. Sam set up the speaker he got from the hotel for Dean and Cas' first dance. They went to the center of the room and got into position. Then, a violin began to play. Dean looked at the stereo with confusion, then he realized what the song was. A smile grew on their faces as they swayed to the music. Dean started to sing softly, even though there weren't any on this version.
"Um, I am not here to flirt. Apologies. But I am married." Cas explained, holding up his hand to show off his ring. She laughed.
"Come right down here boys, I'll show you the aisle." She shuffled down the furthest aisle and showed them a long row of blue and pink things for a baby shower. She looked at Dean and smiled again. "Is it going to be a girl or a boy?"
"You okay, buddy?" Noah asked, and Castiel, while he could barely speak, managed an actual giggle. Castiel, former angel of the Lord, giggled out loud. That just made Noah's now creepy grin become even bigger as his hand drifted up Cas' thigh until it rested between his legs. Castiel's head swung down to look at his crotch, which did nothing more than sit there, and then he looked back up at Noah, who leaned over to pressed his smelly lips to Castiel's neck.
?!" Charlie screeched over the phone when Sam called her. He winced and pulled the reciever from his ear momentarily.
” He was determined that they could help more than one person in this bunker, and he would not let them leave until they did all they could for this strange, complicated little family.
"What are you talking about? I don't think I was mad today, why would I be?" Dean looked confused. Cas widened his eyes.
"Yes, but it is cut off. I will see if I can try and break through. Give me a minute." Castiel stood with difficulty and closed his eyes. He journeyed into his own mind, searching for the spot he knew so well. The forest green spot gave off waves of apology, most likely what Dean last sent before he was forced to cut the bond. Castiel went to the spot and put an imaginary hand on it. Through it, all he felt was white. A painfully blank white. He unfurled his wings in their shared mind and flew straight into the spot. It gave little, but Castiel managed to get through to his hunter's broken mind. He now knew why the bond was tainted with white. It was a white hot pain. One that Dean could hardly comprehend himself, and yet it was normal for his brain now. Castiel knew he was not observed as he broke into his mate's mind, so he made himself known as the drill was removed from Dean's eye.
Castiel nodded and wiped away tears hastily, trying to erase their existence in the first place. Dean got up quickly and pressed a kiss to Cas' forehead, sending a reassuring streak through the bond before leaving to go to meet up with Sam in the library. But he was stopped by the woman who he had seen almost a month before. Immediately, the memories flew back and he growled at her, his instincts to protect his children and mate kicking in.
Cas was startled when the door opened, and Castiel screamed, shutting his eyes and turning his head away from the door, only to feel familiar warm hands turn his head.
"Of course not. We can invite Charlie! I'm sure she'll be happy. And also...we haven't told her about the twins. We are never going to hear the end of it." Sam admitted with a groan. Dean and Cas exchanged a look and a few thoughts.
"Well, the reason I had a distended abdomen in the first place was because this Vessel needed extra space to hold the full extra Grace. Now that I am in Heaven, there is no need for it because this form is only a means to an end so you do not burn." Castiel said. Sam scoffed.
"Do you honestly think we would let you communicate with him now? He cannot hear your bond now, nor can he hear your voice, but you must cut it off, or, we will go now and kill both Castiel and your brother Samuel." Naomi suggested. Dean fell to his knees and looked at the ground.
"No problem, honey. Just remember, you are welcome back here. Actually, take my number. I would love to meet up with you sometimes. Maybe our significant others can meet, too." June proposed, and Castiel smiled at her.
Dean shook away his thoughts and put in his earbuds while he started packing the last of his things: laptop, chargers, phone. The essentials. Dean would save the toiletries for later, so he decided to go grab something to eat. He shuffled out of his room, still bobbing his head to the beat of the newest Taylor Swift song. He would never admit that he listened to her music, but with earbuds in, he could get away with it. Dean looked around and noticed that Castiel had gone on his morning jog, so he unplugged his ear buds and played the song from his speakers on the phone.
A drink was put into his hand, and he tossed that one back, wincing at the stronger burn in his throat, this one resembling the feeling of hot coals tumbling down his esophagus, yet it just felt so satisfyingly hurtful.
"So, what am I going to do, Mr. I-Can-Fix-Everything?" Dean asked with false sweetness. Sam thought for a second, then Cas came into the room.
"I'll go. And I'll cut the bond." Dean gave in. Naomi smiled cruelly and nodded at the shifter girl. She walked forward and touched Dean's arm, then stood back and began to take off her skin, turning into a perfect replica of Dean. The real Dean felt into his mind for the bond, feeling only a slight warmth, sent the strongest wave of apology and warning he could muster, then closed the bond. "It's done. I closed it. Now leave them alone."
"I am sure he would love that, thank you." She found a pen and wrote down a number on the back of his hand with her name signed
"You see...we have decided to not take Castiel. However, the abominations are still a threat, so we need to be rid of them. We need to monitor Castiel without him knowing it. Hadraniel? Bring the skin walker." She said quietly. Another angel appeared besides her with a young girl who had a large smirk. "You will come with us and this will take your place. So now, cut off your bond with Castiel."
"Oh Dean. Please don't try and lie to me. You are absolutely terrible at trying to tell me off. When the angel has better insults, its time to give up, darling." Castiel stepped forward, his mind blazing in protection for his mate.
"Yes, of course." Cas agreed weakly as he pressed his fingers to Dean's forehead. The wounds on his face closed instantly, along with the pained expression on his sleeping face. It smoothed out into on that Cas was used to seeing when he woke up beside his hunter. It was then that Cas and Sam realized how bad Dean was. He had a beard from not shaving in so long, he was sickly thin and his cheeks were caving him on themselves. Castiel put his fingers on his again, but this time it was to make Dean whole again. His features filled back up, his clothes were no longer hanging off him, the facial hair disappeared, and the man Castiel had married reappeared. Castiel wondered if that was what it felt like to Dean when Castiel had returned from Prurgatory. Castiel grabbed Dean in his arms, put a hand on Sam'shore head and flew back to the bunker.
"Before you go inside, I want you to understand why I did what I did. Our children is going to be half angel and half human. Both Bobby and Mary Jo are going to have limited abilities of angels, but they will have wings. Unfortunately, only I will be able to see them between us, so I decided you had the right to see your own children's wings." Cas said before opening the door to the room.
"What else would he do? Wait around the Bat Cave for us to come home like a freaking house wife? No way. We are, of course, going to take some further precautions, but damn right we are still hunting." Dean said, putting his chin on Castiel's shoulder. Castiel nuzzled Dean's cheek affectionately.
"Sorry, we should have told you, but Dean and Cas were kind of absorbed in each other. They got this bond thing with their minds, and ever since then, they just look at each other and have intense eye sex." Sam said, laughing.
"Cas?" A familiar voice said, but Cas wasn't able to place it before the member inside of him was pulled out, and he could feel something happening, some kind of fighting. Cas just laid there limply, too caught up in his invalid body's lack of movement to notice that it was Dean who was beating Noah to a pulp on the disgusting floor of the dark room.
Wow, Sam, really formal, don't ya think?" Dean laughed a little. "Okay, I don't think this is going anywhere too fast, so lets skip a little, shall we?"
Hey, I'm not on my laptop all the time! I sometimes go outside! Jeez, Dean's bb Cas, you're a tough writer." Dean said, only joking in his voice. "
"Excuse me, sir. But could I ask you what you are drinking?" Cas gestured to the goldish brown liquid that was sitting in front of the burly man beside him, and the man looked at Castiel, about to make a rude comment when he saw Cas' eyes and face, which turned the scowl into an inviting grin.
The producer knocked on the door, then peered in. “We’re going to start shooting again soon, we figured we might want to go shopping? Tan and Dean, you can go out together while Bobby starts working on your rooms.” She offered. Dean glanced at Tan, then sighed.
"No apology is necessary. But, I have a question." Castiel said, turning to face the brothers at the end of the table.
Dean woke up with a groan, his guts aching, but no more than normal. Ever since the beating, his insides always seemed to hurt for some reason. He had seen a doctor about it, but they said it was likely just bruising from the attack. Dean got up and took his pills, then he glanced around his mostly bare room. It had been two weeks since he moved in with Castiel, and things were going pretty well so far. They had started going to therapy together, since it was always easier with a buddy, and more importantly the move had gotten Dean away from his father and from Benny.
"Hey, Charlie...what?...Great, we are almost home...Yeah, will you stay in the garage until we get there?...Because! Its a surprise party! If Cas sees you, everyone know you'll spill the beans...Okay, see you then...Bye" Sam hung up and looked at the clock. "We've been gone for an hour and half. How long do you think it'll take to set up the library for the party?"
"Aww. Children are wonderful. I have three of my own, all grown now though. I have a few grandchildren as well. I suggest you get this package of cookies. The mothers-to-be almost always get hungry. Also..." She puttered up and down the aisle, pointing out good things to get, and before long both Winchesters had full arms and baskets. After they left with a small wave to Marion, Dean wanted to get Cas a cake.
"Shoot." Dean said. Cas hinted at confusion on why Dean wanted him to shoot, so Dean clarified. "I mean, go ahead."
"Why can't you just take what you get and hope it doesn't go away instead of expecting it to? You can't live your life like that!" Sam exclaimed, for pulling Dean to face him. "Just, accept that you are happy with your life, and that the world isn't out to get you for once!"
And I have gotten comments on videos so old that I barely remember doing them. They all say to do a reaction to the video, or do it myself." A dark haired head shook as blue eyes looked down, obviously amused. "So, I decided to do a reaction to it. I am not that much of a fangirl like you guys are, but Dean and I are friends, so I wouldn't really want to read things where we end up fucking."
"I can't, you moron. It is something a little more...personal. I was going to tell you the sex of the baby, but since you are so adamant-" Crowley started before Cas cut him off.
"Dean says 'Shut up, bitch.' And what is in the box?" Castiel asked, going to the table and opening the white box. Inside was the cake Dean picked out. It was relatively simple. It was white frosted with pink and blue swirls around the edges. In the middle, there was black icing scripted in the words 'Congradualtions Cas" Then beneath it was an additional lettering of 'I love you, babe'. Castiel turned to Dean and pulled the ribbon from his mouth to give him a brief kiss, then he replaced it.
"Ummm…I guess I will have your cheapest, please." He decided. She nodded in agreement and got the bottle. With a sharp twist, the cap came off and landed in the trash behind the bar. She set it on the counter and smiled at him.
"Do not fear Dean, I would not dream of taking your mark. It is my claim to you. No, instead, I...I need to mate with you." He finished sheepishly. Dean felt his eyes widen as he took in what the angel had said.
You already know Team FreeWill, but the Fab Five don't. And vice versa. Let them get to know each other.
Castiel supposed that he realized he loved Dean shortly after he though Raphael was going to kill him after trapping him. Dean had taken Castiel to a den of inequity, and he had realized there that he did not want to fornicate with a random woman who had issues with her father, but rather with the hunter who laughed with him with his sparkling green eyes and crinkled grin. Dean realized that he loved Castiel the moment he saw his angel after he came back from the horrible future that Zachariah had created. He looked at Castiel, and all he could think of was how happy he was now that Castiel was
Antoni gathered everyone in the library. “Okay. Some of our crew have ventured out to get pizza so we’ll take a lunch break before we continue filming. I see this as a great way for us to get to know Sam, Dean, and Cas and maybe bond a little.”
Sam looked at him. "I didn't ask." Dean laughed and before he could tell off his brother, he heard Castiel again.
"We just wanted this to be a short video to tell everyone about this and to let you know we're still alive." Dean laughed a little bit at that. "Well, I'm barely alive, but you get the picture." He winked at the screen.
"Oh my god. Well...I said I would do this. I'll just do the first...uh, I'll do the first five." The mouse clicked on the first link, and text filled the screen.
Of course the comments on that message were insane, going from crazed Destiel shippers, to theorists, to even haters. Castiel smiled and told himself to thank Dean later, after this whole mess was sorted out. Castiel typed out a general thank you message with a few gifs attached and posted it. He decided to scroll through Tumblr for a bit, at least until he couldn't hear Dean shouting anymore. He also made sure all his identification and tickets were together and put with his wallet so he could grab them all at once before leaving.
"No. I don't believe it will hurt me too much. No more than an average pregnancy." Castiel answered Sam, it was quite inconvenient that Sam couldn't listen in on their conversations and just know. But then again, Dean had a feeling that he definitely did not want him listening in on some of the things he was going to be saying through the bond. The thought made him grin.
"When I put this away, there were exactly thirty-four cookies left. Now, I ate thirty-three and the last is missing." Castiel explained, looking through the container and on the floor in case he dropped it. Dean chuckled.
Lunch was peaceful, full of chatter and laughter as the eight men got to know each other. Everything was going off without a hitch until a dramatic gasp came from Jonathan. “You
An audio tech came and collected Sam and Dean’s mic packs as cameras were temporarily stored in cases and set aside. Dean looked immensely relieved and he, Sam, and Cas all took seats at the library table. Some of the crew pushed the two tables together and the Five sat across from Team FreeWill, aside from Jonathan, who settled in right beside Sam, positively glowing and full of questions.
Dean finally joined the group, having been held back talking to one of the crew members. He brightened up immediately when he saw Castiel. “Cas! You’re back!” Cas returned Dean’s smile with a warm one of his own and went to embrace him. Dean squeezed him tight, holding on a second too long when he remembered he was in a room full of strangers. He took a step back and cleared his throat. He couldn’t believe these words were about to leave his mouth. “So, uh… guess you met the… Fab… Five.”
"Thank you for dinner, and I am very excited to find out what you are going to do in the nursery tomorrow." Dean whispered in Castiel's ear. Sam rolled his eyes at the moment his brother and his angel were having and decided to turn in and go to sleep.
He was content with his married life, and babies on the way, and most of all with his beautiful mate. Castiel was eight months along and his abdomen had streched wide. If you put your hands on it, you could feel two fluttering beating hearts and slight movements from the little half-Graces. Sam had suggested to stop hunting at month eight, which Dean reluctantly agreed to. Cas needed him now more than ever.
Dean was taken slightly aback by the nickname, but soon the shock wore off as he smiled widely. He placed a chaste kiss on Castiel, who was practically buzzing with happiness and excitement.
"You see, Castiel has allowed himself to be corrupted by emotions. So now, we are using them to our advantage. While there is only a single nephilim on Earth, another was attempted about a century ago. The angel was emotionally compromised and let them over take her. She went into premature labor at about six months and the child died. Instead of trying to kill Castiel ourselves, we are letting him live knowing he was the one who killed his children. He will also blame you." Naomi explained, tying Dean's head down and putting a leather strap over his mouth. She grabbed the drill and smiled menacingly. "Let's begin, shall we?"
“I know we’ve never done this before, but Castiel needs our help too.” Jonathan insisted. “His wardrobe is ill-fitting and it almost looks like it is someone else’s. Not only that, but if you watch him, he’s always looking at Dean. I know he’s only been here for a little bit, but he’s looking at him and waiting for him to say something or do something. He needs to learn how to live for
"Yes, he is doing his job. Its a family business, so he is with his brother." Cas explained. June nodded and looked down at some of the other customers.
"Well, look behind you." Sam prodded. Cas turned around with a furrowed brow, which immediately turned into one of surprise.
"That seems fair." Dean nodded with his lips pursed. He reached off screen and brought some notecards and pens up, handing one stack to Castiel and keeping one for himself. "First question. Favorite song." Dean said, grinning as he quickly wrote down his answer.
"In Heaven, angels can see your wings in their true form, so they are kind of like a status symbol. The more intricate your wings, the higher in command you are. I was leader of my garrison, therefore i had the most decorated pair in my sector of Heaven. You should've seen Gabriel's wings. There were six of them and all were gold and white. It was breathtaking to see." Cas stopped talking, but his mind continued on to think about Heaven and his siblings. Dean got a lump in his throat, unable to talk any more.
"Dean!" Castiel gasped as he sat up, straddling Dean's hips. Dean's face melted from confusion into a look of concern as he put his hand on Castiel's stomach. Beneath his hand, something...fluttered, as though there were literal butterflies in Dean's stomach. Both could feel it and they looked at one another in shock.
"Woh, Sammy. Calm down. I...I was just kinda excited. Just, come here." Dean gestured to Cas' stomach. Sam furrowed his brow and came over. He knelt down and put a hand on his abdomen. Then he widened his eyes and put both hands on the bump.
"Yeah, you wanted to take my husband and babies, and now you 'need me'? Sounds convincing." Dean said, turning away and trying to walk away. Naomi appeared in front of him, blocking his way.
"Come on Sammy! Why are you so against it? Are you homophobic or something? You have been fine with us so far! How is this any different?" Dean requested. Sam shook his head and stood from the table.
Dean laughed a little. Ever since Castiel had tried Oreos, he decided that they are the 'best thing ever'. They had to keep a constant supply in the pantry, because Cas would just walk around the bunker with a bag of Oreos to snack on.
Exhausted and ready for bed, the pair headed to their hotel in the Anaheim Hilton near the convention center.
"Don't worry, babe. I will love you even if you get to be the size of a small moon." Dean said as he raised Cas' hand and kissed each of the knuckles gently. A wave of relief flooded his senses, and it almost made Dean want to exhale in relief with him.
"Once I rose above the noise and confusion, just to get an glimpse beyond this illusion. I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high." Dean rumbled the last note, causing Cas to chuckle lightly.
"I don't know who Naomi is. Crowley, what did you do to me? That name...it scares me." Castiel whimpered into Dean's side. Dean looked at Crowley with anger pulsing through his stare.
"Commah nanaeel monons nostoah obza." Castiel said, beginning to get louder. Dean felt a light touch at the back of his mind. He closed his eyes and fell into a dream. He saw Castiel standing in front of him, everything blanked out besides the two of them in Dean's mind. The angel had two wings sprouted from his back, each one was a deep black color, glistening with sheens of violet and emerald. The limbs were stunning, now that the veil that normally covered them had been lifted. Dean felt his jaw drop as he got closer to Castiel. He reached out a hand and stroked the length of the appendage, causing them to shudder delicately. Castiel moaned, but grabbed his hand. "Dean, focus. I can only do this for so long. I need you to let me into your mind completely. No restrictions, no secrets. Okay?" Castiel asked. Dean felt his throat close, but he nodded as the entire world burst in color. Memories flew by him, both good and bad, and Castiel took in everything with wide eyes. With a final heave, Castiel swung his gaze back to Dean and placed his hand on Dean's forehead. "I hereby bond us now and forever. Dean Winchester and Castiel." Dean flew out of the dream and fell to the ground, landing on his back in the bunker, same as Castiel. His eyes danced with the lights as Sam came over to help him up.
