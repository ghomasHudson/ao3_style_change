But alpha's right, Dean didn't even think about that. If Sam just randomly told him, today, that Castiel was a part of an omega center... before Castiel's family ever came to visit him...
'That's probably why you're shaking. You must be hungry, and I think maybe yesterday, well - it was eventful, wasn't it?' the alpha pushes the plate in his direction. 'Please, eat.'
The huge snake slithers in the cage, its body coiled like a slowly-unwinding, thick and murderous spring, and Dean imagines what it would feel like, being crushed to death by it. Nope.
'Thank you,' he replies, and opens the fridge to have something to do. He takes out all the ingredients; the meat, the oil, the eggs. He could probably fry zucchini. He feels the alpha's stare on his back, so he keeps his eyes lowered. Suddenly, the man is right behind him, and he touches his shoulder. Dean stiffens. Okay, so alpha's horny
'Wh-what, what-' Dean exhales, his legs trembling, it feels so good. He feels insistent pressure already growing in his lower stomach, and has to restrain himself from sliding down onto Castiel's fingers. 'What exactly?'
?! Tell him he's grown bored of him? Move? Where, to Sam's, to California? Leave university? But he was just talking about being a teacher, about working alongside Castiel-
'Now,' Castiel opens the chat and writes to Benny. 'We'll let Benny know to take care of special characters. That's exactly what I wanted from you, to test the website.'
'Dean,' he greets him and Dean starts to say 'Hello-' but is cut off as Castiel grabs him by the arm and lifts him off his knees.
He wishes alpha was here with him, helping him count. His warm minty breath against his cheek or mouth or forehead, his strong arms wrapped around Dean, keeping him in place, keeping him here.
'You said you don't worship me,' Castiel continues, and Dean loves the quiet confidence, alpha's body thrumming with it. 'Prove it. There must be something that I do that irritates you. No one's perfect.'
He leaves the house and realizes he's not sure where to go. City this big, though, there have to be many supermarkets around. He just walks down the street, relishing in feeling unrestricted and unobserved. He doesn't have to guard his movements, his facial expressions, control if his eyes are on the ground or on the various houses he passes by. One of the neighbours has a cool vintage Dodge, and Dean slows down to look through the window. He's outside on his own for the first time in a week, and it feels amazing.
'It's not him,' Castiel kisses his head and rocks them on the tiled floor. 'It's not him, look, you have to look, Dean.'
'I'm sorry if I implied otherwise,' Castiel does sound apologetic, but most of all, very cautious. Too cautious, and it gets on Dean's nerves.
'I forgot tomatoes. We need them for the sauce,' they both gaze back, to the far end of the shop they just came from. Castiel sighs. 'Please wait here with the basket. I'll be right back.'
Dean thinks and smiles. He really hopes the tea will help alpha chill out. The family thing was bad enough, and they talked a little but it's only been a day, but then the box... Dean wonders if maybe it left alpha feeling as bad as him. Cause alpha keeps trying to make everything nice, and life - or Dean - keep shooting him down.
'Pretty thing, ain't ya?' the guard asks, staring at Dean, but it lacks the usual leer. It sounds... friendly? 'Good to know Castiel's finally settling down with a mate. Been a long time coming, if you ask me.'
Yeah, Dean's always scared of that, too. It's kind of comforting to share the burden with someone else. To have someone give a damn.
'Welcome!' a perky waitress says, handing out their menus. She doesn't look at Dean in any weird way. This place must be really omega-tolerant.
At least he feels more grounded now. Even though he's alone, again, in the house that he likes but that feels empty without alpha.
Not like he wants it, except he kinda does. He just wants to know what Castiel is like at his worst. He wants to know the size of the room he's in, so he can stay within it in the future and live happily with alpha and never cross the threshold. Sometimes, he thinks it's only then that he'll really be able to relax.
'You're telling me you want to visit Boulderplains without wearing a cowboy hat?' Cas asks, sounding pretend-gobsmacked. 'That won't do, Dean. Come here so we can try them on.'
'I do, in fact,' Castiel says. He's a little reluctant to show it to Sam, but he does want to show Henry, show him what a good omega he has. He pulls out his wallet and takes out the photo he has of Dean. It's not great, it's the one from his file taken at the omega center, but it's the only one he has of him, and he's started taking it with him at the beginning of the week. That way, he kind of feels like Dean's near.
This alpha is clearly a saint. After the morning mishap, he didn't even try to punish him or anything. So far, he was always true to his word... They head to the grocery shop downstairs and all the way there, Dean wonders how could he get Castiel a gift tomorrow. He has no money, doesn't even know what he could buy if he did.
This isn't how he's supposed to say it, he knows. Everything's wrong. There was a whole different life out there - in the diner, past Alastair-
'Why not?' Dean asks, but he averts his eyes, a beginning of a blush gracing his freckled cheeks. Castiel wants to kiss them, but Dean moves first, pressing himself against Castiel until the alpha's trapped between a sink and a tiled wall, and Dean's lips wander down his neck, sucking and licking and-
Dean continues. He strokes Cas' back for a second, muttering "Okay, relax...", then starts kneading again, working Cas' back in a slow but determined fashion.
Dean looks at Cas for a moment, probably to try to figure out if he's lying, then finally gives a defeated grunt and lets his hands drop from the trenchcoat. He raises a brow at Sam and says pointedly, "Fine, but if he dies, don't you come crying to me."
Dean's too far into sleep to make rational decisions, so he simply shuffles to make a little more space for Cas, and tries to ignore his heartbeat quickening as Cas pulls back the covers enough to slip in beside him. The warmth radiating from Cas is comfortably familiar, and as Cas settles in, Dean wonders why Cas is here with him, and why that makes so much more sense than Cas going to Sam, even though it really should be the same thing.
Dean is spared from having to answer when their police radio crackles and reports of an unexplained incident come in. They look at each other, and Dean throws his fist against the bathroom door while Cas gathers their weapons.
Dean has wanted to ask Cas about it since Dean became aware of it. But somehow, it has never come up. And they never have time for stuff like that anyway; They've got bones to salt and monsters to kill.
Dean, down on the mattress, suddenly has Cas' thighs directly in front of his face. He turns around, continues staring into the blackness of the room. He can't hear Micheal over the sound of his own blood rushing in his ears, but he knows the archangel is there, waiting for him to drop his guard.
Sam comes closer and helps Dean lift Cas off the ground. They walk to the Impala in silence, Sam with a shotgun in his hands, covering them. Once in the car Cas can think of nothing other than Dean's body against his in the back seat, supporting him with both hands. It's a comically short drive, and when the car halts Dean throws a "Good luck" towards the driver's seat, grabs Cas tightly, and reaches around to open the car door.
is love, the fear and the fire inside of him, the weight of Dean's body, so delicate. It fits. Humans say love is beautiful, but they also say love is ugly. They're right. Castiel always knew that it can be both. But he never
It's whatever, you know. One day your best friend is an angel and the next he's stealing fries from your plate. And it's fine, it's a-okay.
He sees Dean nod towards Sam with a determined look on his face. "Okay, hotel's on the way. Let's get to the car."
Why then does Sam move up the bed to get closer to the wall, why does he press his ear up against it, holding his breath so he can hear.
"It's alright, Dean." It really is. Cas wouldn't mind more overreactions in the future, if it meant breathing in Dean's air.
Sam comes back from his morning jog with a big smile and an idea. He wants to celebrate Christmas this year. Cas is on board immediately, asking about all the traditions he has never experienced, a warm smile tugging on his lips, and Dean's stoic visage melts at it until he finally agrees to exchange presents on Christmas morning. Sam checks where they could buy a tree, and Cas looks over his shoulder at Sam's phone with a sparkle in his eyes that makes Dean almost excited for Christmas, too.
Then, of course, step three: Get rid of these obstacles, and watch as a new love blooms in their bunker.
The beating in his head is quiet but there. It grows louder when Dean relaxes and closes his eyes, so he doesn't. He shuffles, turns and turns again, catches a glance of Cas' silhouette in the darkness.
, as Dean liked to call it, was the one thing he could do, the one thing he depended on. He didn't think about the possibility of that thing being gone someday, disappearing with his grace and his wings. And the problem with being a one-trick-pony is, of course, that when you can't do the trick anymore you're just a pony, and a useless one at that.
, taking his hand in his own, weaving their fingers together, falling asleep like that, with Dean beside him.
make Dean want to lean in and kiss it off like the guy in that stupid rom-com did. And that his fingers keep brushing over Cas' hand when they've settled into the couch again, listening to Sam telling stories from their childhood, has absolutely
"You don't have to like it." Dean is grinning now. "Personally, I hate the idea of Dick frickin' Ro-"
He managed to not give in this time. But he's weak, and tired. And as he's sitting on his bed, hearing footsteps approaching in the hallway - unmistakably Dean's - he gives up. Just like that. It's another first.
"Cas, I'm not going to leave you," he starts, just to get that out of the way so that maybe he can see Cas smile again. "You won't ever have to be... without me, okay?"
"I'll help you," Cas confirms again, voice low. "If that's what you need me to do. But I won't like it."
Dean shoots him a weak smile and stands up. "Okay, enough flirting," he jokes, regretting it instantly. "I'm, uh, going to bed," he says awkwardly.
You see, that room next door is almost the same as this one. Stained carpeted floor, low cealing, obnoxiously blue partition, beige toilet and sink, complimentary scratch pad on the tiny wooden table. Most importantly, though, it has the same amount of beds: one (king-sized, that is).
Cas does try to relax, but it's almost impossible with the feeling of Dean on him, touching him. And besides, the massage itself really did feel amazing.
Dean shuffles a few inches closer to Cas and leans back, frowning at the movie preview. Sam presses play.
When Castiel finally did fall asleep it was to the image of spending the rest of his short human life with Dean, helping, learning, watching... but never having.
"Don't be stupid, Cas," Dean says, but his voice is full of adoration. "You're learning. It's okay." He lets go of Cas and raises his shirt to reveal his abdomen. Pointing at one of the scars, he says, "See this? Didn't know how to deal with it, so it didn't heal properly. Shouldn't have left a scar, but it did, 'cause I was stupid."
Sam is being clever with his gifts. He buys them online and jogs to the nearest post office to pick them up. When he returns to the bunker, his brother and Castiel are still asleep, so he uses the time to wrap the presents with old newspapers, which he thinks has a certain charm to it. He puts a Christmas bow on top of them as a finishing touch though, just so that Dean won't complain about them looking sad. He hides them in the giant closet in his room, knowing that Dean won't look there, and telling Cas that December isn't a good time to be snooping around.
When Castiel becomes human he isn't the only one who needs time to adjust. Sam and Dean have to deal with it too. And it's hard to think about, and Dean feels wrong thinking it, but they lost their best asset, the ace up their sleeve.
An awkward silence falls between them, with Cas smiling shyly, head dipped down, and Dean frantically thinking about why he is more than okay with how the situation has progressed.
The movie is about a big city hotshot who warms up to the idea of Christmas through his love for the awkward new coworker. Dean hates it, frankly, but Cas seems to be enthralled by it, and that makes it endurable. Dean finds himself watching Cas more often than the tv screen though, taking in his reactions to every little interaction, dialogue, and plot point. Even with the Winchester's best efforts Cas still hasn't seen many movies, and his resistance to lazy tropes and recycled plots always make watching a movie an experience.
's mysterious death was gruesome enough to be mentioned in the town's record not once, not twice, but three times." Sam frowns at Dean's makeshift bed. "Also, I would never shoot you for money."
And beyond all of that waves and waves of guilt crashing into him. Guilt about lying to Dean and using him; Guilt so bitter and burning that Castiel's pillow ended up wet from tears for the second time that day.
"But you've made a mistake, and now you're carrying it around with you." Cas raises his arm and hovers his hand next to the scar. He doesn't dare touching Dean's bare skin,
Sam wants to reach through the wall, really be there. It seems like a different world to him, a better one, a world in color. Not as dreary and gray as on Sam's side.
Dean grips the front of the trench coat and pulls Cas closer. Their eyes meet, and for a second Dean thinks that Cas is leaning in, quick breaths and eyes flickering down to his lips. He panics and lowers his head and brushes the lametta in his hair off onto Cas, who laughs, huffs and puffs, and finally raises his hands in defeat.
"Yeah," Sam confirms. "Just fight through it. You'll feel better once you've talked to him." At least I hope so*, Sam adds in his mind.
"Well, they say the eyes are the window to the soul, so..." Dean says with a smirk and rubs his hand over his face. "But, uhm, thank you," he finishes lamely.
Sam attempts to catch Dean's eyes, but his brother seems determined to not let that happen. Instead, Dean follows Cas to the tree and points at the tiny stack of presents.
Dean takes some of the strips and grins. "We'll find something else to decorate," he says and lays one golden strip over Cas' head.
"Perfect," Dean says, and at the same time Sam says "Maybe we should leave more space in between, we don't have that much stuff."
The day passes quickly with the help of booze, cookies, and board games. Dean just finished cleaning the kitchen and walks into the living room, finding Sam splayed out on the couch, long limbs hanging off the edges, snoring. He still has the pink clip in his hair, and his new glasses are lying on his chest, rising and falling with his breath. Dean smiles at the sight and pulls the blanket that's bunched up at Sam's feet up a bit.
to do with how much Dean wants to hold Cas' hand. And that, when they're playing Scrabble a while later, Dean keeps saying that Cas is a handsome genius - well, that's just the truth. And when a voice in Dean's head keeps saying
on Cas. He wants to take him out to dinner, hold his hands, watch bad movies while cuddling against him, feel his stubble on his own cheek, and yes, he wants to press his fingers into the skin right above Cas' hip which is flashing him so delightfully at this very moment.
But hey, it's been a long day, and he's bored out of his mind, and Cas is here, and Dean feels the need to rock the boat, because that's just what he does when he's bored.
Sam is up early the next morning and goes for a grocery run. When he returns Cas is already in the kitchen, a folorn look on his face.
Dean continues to mouth along next to Cas's ear, not close enough to be intimate but close enough to make Cas' face flush red, Sam notices as his eyes flicker back and forth between Dean and Cas.
Sam smiles a sad smile at him and steps closer. "Cas... It's okay. You don't have to say it. I know what you mean. I think Dean would understand too, even if you're not sure how to say it. Just talk to him, it'll be alright. I promise."
They return to the hotel room - two kings and a pull-out couch - soon afterward, and Dean offers Cas one of the beds, having listened to Cas complaining about his lower back for the last few minutes.
"So, looks like you have a concussion. That means bed rest for you, kiddo," Dean says, flushing the toilet and pushing Cas towards the bed.
He wants to say, "Dean, I lied to you. It's the ugliness inside of me that made me do it, the ugliness of being human and of loving you." He wants to apologize, tell him, "There is beauty in loving you too, but I am afraid to experience it. I'm afraid you do not reciprocate. And maybe deep down I know that you don't, but whatever is inside of me, it doesn't let me accept that."
Dean grunts, half in agreement and half in rebellion. He misses the feeling of Cas' hand and subconsciously leans back towards the angel. He feels Cas' breaths, his warmth on his back. It's unfamiliar, having spent most of the nights of his adult life without another person to share a bed with. Not in this sense, anyway.
There is no way in heaven or hell that he can see this for the rest of his life, not allowed to touch, barely allowed to look, and not lose his mind.
He really wants to create an evil plot and execute it flawlessly until Dean and Cas make out - or whatever it is the kids these days do. He thinks about creating coincidences, starting awkward conversations, "accidentally" booking a motel room with a double bed, basically playing god. Hell, maybe straight-up yelling "Guys, just kiss each other already!" would do the trick.
Cas shuffles under the blanket sometimes, and each and every time their bodies seem to be pressed together just a little bit more. Cas, who's in sweatpants and a Henley shirt he's borrowed from Dean (which absolutely does
Another day Cas finds Dean in the library, eyes filled with tears, looking at a picture of Bobby, and Cas promises Dean that they'll all meet again.
"Why do you look at me like that?" he asks into the room, putting his phone away. When Cas raises his head Dean looks towards him to meet his eyes. "You always look at me, what's up with that?"
Sam stops him. "Wait, let me first," and presses the other newspaper-wrapped gift into his brother's hands.
"They will look lovely on you," Cas says, tone entirely serious, and that makes Dean laugh. Sam can't help but laugh, too, and clamps one of the clips into his hair, and swishes his hair around like he's in a shampoo commercial.
He didn't get a goodnight from Dean today, just a curt "See ya". He didn't get an "I love you" either, not even the ones he used to share with his brother — nicknames and teasing and hair ruffling and "If you're in the bathroom in the next ten seconds you can shower first."
"Don't," Dean interrupts him. "Don't say it, Cas. Not now," he begs. "Not when we're all about to die."
"I would have gotten it myself," Cas begins, looking forlorn, "but since I am not an angel anymore I had to ask one of my brothers for help. I hope you appreciate it despite that." He reveals a potted flower with a large white blossom.
No response. He dares to open the door a crack and sticks his head in. "It's Christmas," he announces gently. His eyes fall on the bed, where he sees Cas pressed up to Dean's back, and clears his throat. Cas' eyes open slowly.
"You've noticed a change on how Dean acts around you?" Sam guesses. "But you're not sure if Dean's noticed it himself?"
It's not like Dean to admit to needing someone (someone human) though, so Sam doesn't pressure him to. So Sam bites his tongue when Dean hands him the key to the single room and proceeds to go off with Cas to the other one.
"You wouldn't ever owe me anything, Dean. I can and will do anything you ask of me. Except this." There's a finality there. "Please understand."
Dean's got a long way to go, Sam thinks with a sigh. Cas is trying to meet him in the middle, but the puzzle pieces don't quite fit together yet. There's some more rounding off to do.
Cas looks at Sam, but doesn't say anything. Sam isn't an idiot, but he can be a jerk sometimes, so he makes no effort to shut up and instead says "That's such a thoughtful gift, Cas."
He ends up not doing it, though, and good thing too, because he notices Sam's glances towards the couch. Their eyes meet once, and Sam's face says
. They're not going to figure it out themselves. No pining or staring contest that Sam isn't invited to will make up for apparently-dead-or-unused brain cells.
It's a few hours later, and Castiel thanks the heavens that his mouth had started feeling normal again soon after what happened in the library. Though, he has to admit, it took his heartbeat a while longer than that to return to normal, with Dean's investigating hands having been all over him.
Ten minutes later the kitchen is almost clean, leftover food in the fridge and plates scrubbed clean, and Cas stands next to Dean, both of them towel in hand, drying the tableware.
Sam told him that it might take him a long time to learn how to turn off his thoughts when going to sleep. But Sam didn't understand. Castiel didn't have problems falling asleep when he first became human. In fact, he couldn't get enough of it. Something is different now, now that he lives and hunts with the brothers, now that he accepts what he is feeling for Dean. Last night it took him ages to even become drowsy, rolling around in his bed, uncomfortable, hot, loud thoughts keeping him awake.
Dean is bent over the sink in his bedroom, hands gripping the sides of it tightly, toothbrush hanging out of his mouth as he glares at his own reflection in the mirror. His vision blurs whenever Micheal moves, and all sounds except for the archangel's loud cries are drowned out.
"Yeah, well, he's probably gonna eat them all anyways, so it's only fair," Dean says and turns around to face him. He has flour on his cheeks and the top of his nose. Sam wonders how that happened.
As much as Dean loves looking at Cas, realistically he can do it only so long before he starts to scratch his own brains out from boredom - he simply doesn't have the angelic patience Cas still seems to harbour when it comes to things like that. Cas can probably look at Dean for hours without getting bored. Dean takes that as a compliment. And yeah, Dean, against popular belief,
part. But everything before and after that he's not good at, and he needs to learn it, which means the Winchesters have to teach him, as if they don't already have enough on their plate.
"No, I like them," Sam says honestly, and puts the glasses on. They seem to fit perfectly, but they feel foreign on his face. "Gonna take some time to get used to."
Minutes pass, and Dean flexes his muscles in an attempt to keep himself awake and alert. He doesn't know how long he can do this, how long it will take until sleep will overcome him, but he has to try to delay it as much as possible.
Sam takes Cas shopping now and again, and each time Cas picks a small trinket or snack to give to Dean for when they return to the bunker. But one day, a Thursday in May, he keeps his gift in his pocket, waiting for a better moment, and regardless: when they come home Dean is in a bundle of blankets on the couch watching
No more gentle touches to his forehead or cheek (and no, those didn't make all the injuries worth it, why would Dean even think that?), no more magical moment of relief when all the blood and pain vanished. Sam and Dean have to tend to each other again, nurse themselves back to health, like in the good old times. Except now they have one more human to take care of, and Castiel is a really bad patient most of the time - whining and grunting and putting weight on his broken leg when he really should just let it heal in peace.
"Okay." Sam seems pleased with himself. Fine, let him be. If he's going to help Cas he has every right to be.
It's the human things: The shortness of breath. The spinning sensation. The ridiculous rush of blood into his face whenever Dean touches him. The way Castiel can feel his
Sam is the first to wake up in the morning. He makes himself a light smoothie for breakfast, not wanting to ruin his appetite for the large meal they have planned for later. He does grab a cookie from the tray on the kitchen table though, because he's only human. The other bedroom doors stay closed, so Sam decides to finish preparing the tree, dimming the ceiling lights and switching on the tree's string of lights. He even bought a bunch of fake candles, which he spreads around the room, then he starts up an instrumental Christmas playlist and steps back to admire his work, trying not to look at the presents under the tree too closely, as to not spoil the surprise later. He sits down criss-cross on the carpet, and stares up to the tree, waiting for the others to wake up.
Cas doesn't say anything, so Dean clears his throat and asks "So... d'you wanna give this" - he gestures back and forth between them - "a try?"
"I suppose stopping the deaths is worth the tension in my lower back," Cas' voice pulls Dean back into the hotel room. Cas stretches with his arms on the back of his hips, shirt slipping up to reveal skin, and Dean is reminded that no matter how strong their bond or how deep his love, at the end of the day he has a fucking
"You want me to—?" Cas asks. Dean can't even make out his lips moving, only sees the looming shadow of the angel standing there.
Dean doesn't dare look at his brother until Cas returns a minute later. He's holding something behind his back.
Cas starts cutting the kiwi in slices, which makes Sam grab a spoon and demonstrate scooping up the kiwi with it.
He stares until he re-lived the whole scene ten times, and only then he fully grasps what the hell just happened.
"I don't know," Dean answers honestly. "Just, different, I guess." He lets that statement linger between them for a while.
"Nah," Dean says. "I know you like 'em plain. And it's probably good for Cas too, the first taste should be
Sam and Cas are in the kitchen doing the dishes - Sam washes the plates and Cas towels them off - when Dean returns from his grocery trip. He sets down the heavy bag next to the fridge, then throws his hands up into the air as he steps closer to his brother and Cas.
thinking it, files the butterflies he feels away somewhere, and finally drifts into sleep. Because that's the Winchester way.
Dean nods back and sits down next to him awkwardly, meeting his crystal blue eyes and finally recognizing the tender look in them - the look that's always been there - as love.
Cas finds news of suspicious murder all by himself one morning. He checks in with Sam, who's shaving in the bathroom, to make sure it really could be a case, and when Sam nods proudly, Cas goes to the kitchen where Dean is already at the stove, preparing breakfast.
, those fantasies are going up in smoke, and he is left with nothing but the ashes of horrible regret.
“I’m happy to be home,” Cas says, turning to look at Dean, his gaze full of warmth and affection. From the way he says
“You love him too.” It’s spoken as a statement, and it’s so unexpected that Dean snaps his head up to look at Sam. Normally Sam beats around the bush when he tries to get Dean to admit his feelings, goes around and around in circles, giving Dean an out, which Dean almost always takes. This is so blunt, so upfront, and so
Dean feels like his hands haven’t been washed of blood since. He has looked down to see blood on them so many times, too many times 𑁋 Sam’s blood, Cas’ blood, his own blood.
Cas picks up a note that sits on top of the gift, scanning it quickly before handing it over to Dean with a smile.
“Well, we ended up in this barn with them. I remember we were all fighting . . .” Dean trails off. He remembers that one of them told him her name, but he can’t for the life of him recall what it was. “And then one of them shoved me backwards against a wall. Except the wall had this big piece of metal sticking out of it, so I got totally shanked. And then I died.”
“But we’ve lived this life for so long,” Arthur finishes for her. “We both felt like it was time for something new. For a change.”
“I don’t want to hear it. When Cas –” Dean chokes on his words. God, it hurts to even say his name. “When he died, he took a part of me with him, and that’s something I’m never gonna get over.” Dean stands up quickly, suddenly feeling like the air in the kitchen is stifling, feeling like he needs to crawl out of his skin.
tired. I’m tired of seeing you get hurt, of wondering if a hunt will be our last. I want –” Cas’ voice catches, and he takes a shaky breath, seemingly gathering himself as he does so. “Dean, I want to grow old with you.”
He stands and heads to the kitchen, setting the cookbook down on the island and pressing gently on the pages until it lies flat. He’ll bake Cas some cinnamon rolls as an apology, Dean decides. Cooking and baking have always helped him to clear his head, but he hasn’t done much of either lately, too focused on getting their house set up. As a bonus, they’ll hopefully loosen Cas up a bit before Dean springs his we-should-move-back-to-the-bunker speech on him.
Dean thinks about putting his hand over his heart earlier and how he was surprised to feel it beating, because he had felt that it
Arthur holds the keys up in his hands. “You left them on the kitchen counter,” he says, smiling affectionately at her.
Cas comes in early from the garden one rainy, November day. Dean looks up at him from where he’s sitting on the couch with his book, removing his reading glasses and setting them down on the table beside him. Cas’ hair is stark white now, though it’s still as messy as ever, sticking up in spiky, wet clumps due to the rain. Dean thinks he looks adorable.
Dean’s heart swells with an emotion he can’t quite name 𑁋 though words like gratefulness and peace and
“Sam!” Dean calls, backing up until his back is pressed flush against Cas’ own. He raises his knife as a vamp advances on him, using his legs to kick it back until he has enough distance to lunge at it. “Eleven!”
Dean sets the book down on the counter and flips to the pancake recipe. He has no doubt the pancakes will be delicious, even though he’s never tried the recipe out; this book hasn’t disappointed him yet, and the picture the book includes boasts some of the fluffiest pancakes he’s ever seen.
“Cas!” Dean bellows. “I will hit you with my spoon!” Dean chases Cas in circles around the kitchen, Cas dodging the swipes that he makes with his spoon, Bobby’s riotous giggles echoing around them.
“I do,” comes Cas’ answer somewhere to Dean’s left, followed by the sound of his blade making contact with a throat. “Five!”
One bright summer’s morning, the sweet pea finally blooms, vibrant and beautiful, and Dean knows that it’s time.
Sam sounds so wistful as he talks about her that Dean honestly wonders if he’s been possessed by a lovesick thirteen-year-old.
Pancakes had been a special Sunday morning treat for their family; Mary had insisted on it. Dean remembers that she always made the batter from scratch, a “secret family recipe” that Dean had never had the chance to learn, still too young to do much more than add the blueberries when his mother had died. The recipe, Dean’s sure, had gone up in smoke as well.
Their family and friends stay until late, and when Dean finally falls into bed with Cas that night he feels so full of happiness that he can’t stop smiling, even between their heated kisses.
Dean takes a bite of his own roll. It’s . . . pretty damn fantastic, like Cas said. The frosting is thick and creamy, sweet but with a slight tang from the cream cheese. The dough is fluffy and light, and the cinnamon swirling through the middle adds just the right amount of spice.
The upstairs consists of just a small linen closet and the master bedroom with an adjacent bathroom. There’s a bed in the room, though most other furniture has already been removed. The entire space is suffused in warm, golden light that’s coming in from two large windows. The one to Dean’s left looks out over the backyard and the hills, just like the one in the kitchen. The window to his right opens to the front of the house, providing a stunning view of the entire front garden.
Everyone gathers at their house for Christmas that year. Cas receives extra hugs and kisses but relatively few gifts, and though no one acknowledges it, it’s because they all know that it will be Cas’ last one.
Cas’ hair starts to turn grey at the temples. Dean pokes fun of him for it right up until he starts not being able to see things two feet in front of his own face, and then Dean quickly shuts his trap.
“Is it because you and Cas don’t love each other?” Bobby says, without waiting for Dean’s answer. “One of my friends at school says that his mom told him that only people who are really in love get married.”
“After I returned from Purgatory, you asked me what I was going to do. You mentioned opening a bed and breakfast in Vermont,” Cas says without looking up, continuing to sort through his things. He drops a bottle of strawberry-flavored lube into what Dean privately hopes is his “keep” pile. “There are two downstairs bedrooms we won’t be using, and we’ll need the money.” Cas gives a small shrug. “Why not?”
Besides, when you never thought you’d live to see past thirty-five, getting older feels more like a privilege than a burden.
There’s just something . . . different, Dean supposes, about imagining Cas waking up in a house that just the two of them share, a house that has a flower garden and a vegetable garden and an island in the kitchen with a frankly ridiculous amount of counter space. A house that speaks of comfort and safety, rather than of endless research and monster-hunting. A
Dean spends the months after Cas’ death in a terrible haze, sorrow clinging to him like the humidity of the approaching summer.
Dean lives long enough after that to set his affairs in order, ensuring that the house will go to Bobby and saying his goodbyes to Sam and Eileen.
Their first spring at the house boasts of Cas’ diligent work that he’d put in all winter long. There’re new seedlings sprouting everywhere, and the flowers that were already planted before they moved in look healthier, larger, and more vibrant under Cas’ care. Dean thinks he’ll always remember that first spring, filled with sunshine and color and the quiet hum of bees, tinted rosy in his mind with the blissful newness of it all.
goes unsaid between them. “You have to go through all of this pain. You’re going to –” Dean’s voice catches, but there’s no use beating around the bush, not at this point. “You’re going to die.”
Cas laughs. “Why not?” he says, squeezing Dean’s shoulder. “We already share a house and a family together. And I’d like to spend the rest of my life with you, Dean. If you’ll have me.”
“Right,” Sam agrees. “The Empty is so big you’d never be able to find him, even if you looked for years.” He raises his eyes from the page and looks at Dean. “But what if we sent you in with something, something that could basically guide you straight to Cas?”
Dean is lying on his back, staring at the dark ceiling of his bedroom like he has been for the past three hours, too exhausted to sleep, when Sam comes bursting through his door.
The four of them tour the house Sam and Eileen had been looking at the next day. Although it’s not very large, it is close to town and has a nice, private backyard. Dean thinks it would be perfect for the two of them, but over dinner that night Sam admits that, while they love the house, they’re not entirely sure they want to move right away.
“Uh, yeah,” Sam says, laughter still in his voice. Dean narrows his eyes. “I’m a big boy now. And I’ve got Eileen with me too. I think I can manage.”
Truthfully, Dean finds Cas’ penchant for mug collecting kind of – okay, very – endearing, as much as he grumbles and gripes about them. On one of his trips out to a local thrift shop to look for a nightstand for one of the guest bedrooms, he finds a mug that says “I Love My Angel” on it. (
“Do you, Castiel, promise to love and cherish Dean, in good times – four! – and in bad, in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, and forsaking all others, keep yourself only unto him, for as long as you both shall live?”
Cas’ health only gets worse from there. It becomes difficult for him to walk, and since Dean is in no physical condition to be able to carry him (as much as he wishes he could), they relocate to one of the downstairs bedrooms to sleep. Every night, Cas tells Dean that he should go and sleep in their bed upstairs because it’s much more comfortable, and every night, Dean tells him to stop being an idiot. He wouldn’t be able to leave Cas’ side even if he wanted to, and besides, he doesn’t think he knows how to fall asleep anymore without Cas next to him.
“So, I mean, yeah,” Sam says eventually, when Dean doesn’t respond, “‘course I’ll miss having you around. But I’m also really excited for you.”
Dean goes through the motions of getting ready for bed, pulling items from his bathroom bag that he still needs to properly unpack. Washes his face, brushes his teeth. They’re the same things that he’s been doing every night for years, but it feels completely different, somehow. Everything feels brand new, novel.
Sam; his thumb hovers over the green “answer call” button before he ultimately drops his wrist and lets the call ring out to voicemail. He should have answered, he knows that, because Sam is probably extremely worried by this point, but he doesn’t think he can even speak right now, even if he was able to muster the energy to call Sam back. Instead, Dean draws his legs to his chest, feeling distinctly child-like, rests his forearms on top of his knees, and hangs his head between his shoulders, the weight of what has happened pressing heavily against his body.
, he can scarcely believe that this is his life. If someone were to have told him five years ago that he would one day be living in Vermont with Cas, opening up a bed and breakfast with him, he would have laughed in their face before decking them. Now, though, it feels so – so
“Aren’t you tired, Dean?” Cas turns his gaze on him then, an ancient, heavy melancholy etched in the lines on his face.
It takes a couple of months, but they eventually get approved for the house. They’ve got enough saved up to cover most of the down payment, but they’ll need to pick up some kind of work once they move if they actually want to keep eating on a regular basis.
come to mind 𑁋 and concludes that it is due time to reinstate the Winchester tradition of making pancakes on Sunday mornings.
“Daffodils,” Arthur says, offering them to Dean and Cas. Cas accepts them with a gracious smile. “To symbolize new beginnings.”
Dean is pulled from sleep by the tender, lingering kiss of early morning sunlight as it streams in through the bedroom’s large windows. It fills the room in its entirety, turning the air hazy and golden with its splendor; it is the kind of sacred, precious light that the sun seems to savor for only the most perfect of Sunday mornings.
After a moment, he says, “You should know that what I feel for you far surpasses any sort of contract that humans have created to symbolize their love for each other.”
Dean squeezes Cas’ hand, not breaking his hold as he raises his blade between himself and the vampire that’s coming towards him.
“Mornin’, Sleeping Beauty,” Dean chirps, passing Sam a lukewarm cup of coffee from the gas station they stopped at a while back. Sam takes it with a grumble of thanks, muffling another yawn with the back on his hand.
“Do you wanna try one?” Dean asks eagerly. He can’t help it; he’s strangely giddy at the idea of Cas getting to taste one. He wants to share this thing that he made, that he’s proud of, with the person he loves.
They make their way towards the kitchen together. There’s a small, rectangular package sitting on the island, just like Arthur said there would be.
“Dean –” There’s clear relief in Sam’s voice, but he cuts himself off as he takes in the mess of the room, Dean’s position on the floor, the lack of Cas’ presence. It’s terribly silent for a moment before Sam says softly, hesitantly, “Cas?”
Cas comes in from the garden then, toeing off his dirty boots by the front door before heading to the kitchen.
The tugging sensation he had felt in his chest standing on the precipice of the Empty comes back, pulsing within his body like a heartbeat, urging him to move somewhere to his left. He follows blindly, hoping with all that he has that this will work, that it will lead him to Cas. He walks to his left and thinks about how he would chase Cas all the way down to the ends of the entire Universe to find him. He walks to his right and thinks about how much he loves Cas, how he feels that love so deeply in his bones that it hurts, sometimes. He walks forward and – it’s silly, really – thinks about what it would feel like to kiss Cas.
They get married a couple of months later, in May. Even though the whole thing started as a kind of half-joke, a let’s-get-married-because-we-already-pretty-much-are type of deal, Dean still wakes up on the morning of the wedding filled with a heady combination of excitement and nerves.
On this Sunday morning, up in their shared bedroom in their home in Vermont, Dean breathes steadily in and out, in and out
As ridiculous as it sounds, even in Dean’s own head, baking the cinnamon rolls this morning had given him that sense of productivity, of self-importance, that he’d been missing for a while. He thinks about baking the rolls again for their guests and how it might bring them happiness to eat them too, just like it did for Cas. It fills him with an unexpected sense of purpose that effectively silences his thoughts about returning to the bunker.
“Aw, Cas, I think Sammy’s in love,” Dean says with a shit-eating grin, earning himself another flick to his ear.
Dean straightens up from where he’s been packing a box labeled “Dean’s clothes”, a half-folded flannel in his hands. He looks over at Cas, who’s currently sorting through the items in his nightstand drawer. “What?”
He still can’t quite believe that he’s really here, in this house in Vermont, doing this whole “semi-retirement” thing, as Sam put it. A poignant, bittersweet feeling washes over him as he thinks about how he never actually expected to live long enough to get to retire, not really. He listens to Cas’ footsteps as he climbs the stairs and thinks about how he also never expected to have someone to share retirement with, either.
Dean steps up to the door and inserts the key into the lock. He pauses before turning it all the way, glancing back at Cas.
They say their goodbyes shortly after, thanking Florence and Arthur for their time. Florence hands them a small piece of paper with an email and phone number so that they can contact them, in case they’re interested in the house. Before they leave, Arthur holds up a finger and asks them to wait for a moment, disappearing into the garden. He returns a few minutes later, a bundle of white flowers with sunny yellow centers in his hands.
“Like a tracking device?” Dean’s sitting up fully now, feeling wide awake, a muted sort of hope glimmering faintly in his chest.
“By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and husband,” Sam says as he makes his way over to them, wheezing slightly with exertion. “You may now kiss the groom.” He collapses on the floor, his chest heaving.
Dean can’t help it; he doubles over, laughter bubbling up from his throat as tears leak from his eyes. Cas’ deep chuckle resonates into the night, buoying Dean, bringing him up for air. Lightening his heart, at least for the moment.
They’re lying in bed a little while later, their legs entwined beneath the comforter, and Dean’s just about to nod off when Cas speaks.
Dean huffs a weak laugh before forcing himself to continue, to voice what’s been on his mind ever since Cas died.
Dean cries himself out, physical exhaustion eventually overtaking his fraught emotions, preventing any more sobs from wracking his body. His head is pounding, his eyes sting from the salt of his tears, and his chest and abdomen are sore from the physicality of crying. As he takes deep, shuddering breaths and focuses on the concrete wall opposite him, his mind eventually goes mercifully blank. He feels completely numb; he stares in front of himself without seeing. He barely even registers Sam’s desperate cries of “Dean!” from the hallway, his pounding footsteps as he gets closer, the crash of the door as Sam bursts through.
When Dean laments one day about how their local grocery store always seems to be out of rosemary, Cas plants an herb garden right next to the vegetables, and Dean is never short on rosemary again.
Dean walks over to the shelf next to the fridge and pulls down his favorite recipe book for anything breakfast related. The title
“Cas,” Dean says to the empty room, putting his head in his hands. He hasn’t prayed in decades; he hasn’t needed to. Cas was the only one worth praying to, and he’d always been right there, right by Dean’s side.
They stay in the garden for a long while after that, simply enjoying the warmth of the sunshine and the comfort of each other. The hum of bees fills the air as they buzz languidly around them.
It’s Sam’s quiet, slightly awkward cough that breaks them apart once more. Dean nearly jumps; he had completely forgotten Sam was there.
A ray of golden sunlight suddenly streams through the window that faces the front garden, settling gently over Dean. Dean pulls his head from his hands and looks up, taking deep, shuddering breaths, the warm sunshine a welcome reprieve from his cold, dark thoughts. He eventually pushes himself to a standing position and shuffles over to the window, squinting out of it at the front garden, not entirely sure what he’s looking for.
Dean pulls Cas in for a kiss, his shoulder burning hot when their lips meet, a reminder of Cas’ constant, unwavering love for him. It spreads through his body, bringing him a warmth that has nothing to do with the steam in the bathroom, before it settles right over his heart, like a promise.
is always sitting on his nightstand), but regardless, he’s definitely got the greener thumb between the two of them.
Dean makes the first move, lunging out as a vamp steps within range. It swings at him, but Dean is faster; he ducks and weaves, popping up on the side of it before swiping at eye level, decapitating the vamp with one clean stroke.
Instinctively, Dean reaches out to touch it, placing his palm right over it, once more feeling Cas’ heartbeat, just as he had in the Empty. His hand covers it perfectly. Cas’ skin is warm to his touch. Alive and beautiful.
Sam makes a good point. Dean runs over to Cas, linking their hands together. It gives them both one less arm to use, and Dean has to switch his knife to his non-dominant hand, which also happens to be the hand attached to his injured arm, but to hell with it. Dean’s going to do this thing properly.
There have been more times than Dean can count that he has looked down to see blood coating his fingers and hands and knuckles. He thinks the first time must have been sometime at an elementary school that he attended for a couple of months; he had gotten into a juvenile fist fight on the playground with another boy. Dean doesn’t remember why or much else about it, but he does remember looking down at his hands and seeing his split knuckles, the red blood shining almost grotesquely against his young skin.
“I can only keep this portal open for a short time,” Sam reminds Dean as he takes another step closer. He’s teetering on the edge now; he can hear the sounds of the Empty, somehow too loud and too quiet all at once. There’s a foreign tugging sensation within his chest, urging him to take that final step into the abyss. Dean looks back at Sam.
Cas exhales heavily. The silvery-blue glow of the moon reflects in Cas’ eyes, making him look otherworldly, ethereal.
In Cas’ eyes, Dean sees his future stretched out before him, warm and inviting, like an open road on a sunny, cloudless day. Dean kind of wants to kick himself for waiting so long for this when he clearly didn’t have to, but that hardly matters now; Cas is here, miraculous and impossibly perfect, and Dean isn’t about to let him go again.
Dean sighs, rubbing the bridge of his nose. Cas shouldn’t have to take the brunt of his self-loathing, though. It’s not fair, and Dean knows that. He resolves to make it up to Cas somehow after he gets back before taking a look at the book Cas dropped in front of him.
Before he can escape from the kitchen, Sam grabs his forearm and Dean turns around, fully prepared to tell Sam that now is not the time, his misdirected anger still coursing hot and fiery through him. All he sees in Sam’s face, though, is sympathy and understanding, and Dean deflates completely, an awful sadness settling in to replace his momentary anger. Sam releases his arm and Dean musters what he can of a small smile. They don’t say anything more, and Dean turns and walks to his bedroom, shutting the door quietly behind him.
On one of their weekly FaceTime calls with Sam and Eileen, Sam tells them that they’re thinking of moving to Vermont.
of a new life, a new beginning, not when so many of their family and friends weren’t given the chance.
It turns out that there’s only one place in town that will deliver to them since they’re so far out in the country. Their food comes an hour later, the ring of the doorbell signaling its arrival. Dean pokes Cas’ calf with his foot.
“Can we take a look?” Cas asks, turning towards Dean, and, well, Dean is always helpless to say no to him, especially when he looks so damn
Dean sets the mixing bowl down on the countertop, watching Cas through the window as he digs in the front garden. The idea of getting married to Cas had crossed Dean’s mind before, of course, but he’d never entertained it for long. What he feels for Cas, the bond that he shares with him, runs deeper than marriage, in his opinion. He doesn’t need a fancy wedding or a legal document to know that Cas means absolutely everything to him. That Dean wants to spend the rest of his life, and whatever comes after that, with him.
Ignoring the pounding in his head and heart, Dean practically lunges towards Cas, desperate to touch him, to feel the warmth of his body and know for certain that he’s alive. He grips Cas’ wrists and pulls until they’re both sitting, facing each other. Dean doesn’t let go, maintains his grip. Cas’ eyes flicker down momentarily, a furrow in his brow, but he doesn’t pull his hands away.
“’Course we can,” Dean says, giving Cas’ hand a squeeze. Cas gives him a sunny smile that crinkles the corners of his eyes and Dean’s heart clenches, just a bit. It’s kind of ridiculous that after all these years Cas still has that effect on him, can still leave him breathless with a smile, but Dean can’t find it in him to be upset about it. Dean brings Cas’ knuckles to his lips and brushes a light kiss there, something like peace or contentment warming his chest.
He tilts his head downwards and Dean follows, breath catching in his throat when he sees it. There, right over Cas’ heart, is a red handprint.
Dean spits, rinses, pats his mouth dry with a towel. He glances at Cas out of the corner of his eye, catching him blatantly ogling his ass. Dean stands up straight and tosses the towel back onto the countertop, waggling his eyebrows.
Dean’s suddenly struck by just how grateful he is for this life that he’s created with Cas in Vermont. He wakes up every morning secure in the knowledge that they’ll both be able to live through the day – and the next one, and the one after that – because they spend their time cooking or making reservations for guests or planting flowers in the garden, rather than running after monsters.
sound nice though, and really, Dean’s over forty years old; he can keep it in his pants for a couple of hours.
“Aw, c’mon,” Dean says teasingly, running a hand self-consciously over his head. “I hardly have any hair left.”
Dean sits at the table in the kitchen and stares down at the surface of it. A sandwich is set in front of him. Dean’s stomach turns.
Dean bakes all morning – cinnamon rolls are apparently a lot of damn work – and loses himself in it, a sense of calm settling over him as he measures and stirs and kneads, focusing all of his attention on the task at hand. It’s a tricky recipe and Dean adds too much flour at one point, but he’s able to improvise and quickly rectify the situation. An unexpected feeling of pride warms his chest when the dough is able to take up the excess flour, turning slightly sticky just like the recipe says it should. It feels good – amazing, really – to make something with his hands and to know that he’ll be able to share the end result with Cas later. To know that what he made will make Cas happy, even if it’s just a cinnamon roll.
They spend the rest of the day getting as much of their stuff unpacked as they can. It’s a difficult, seemingly never-ending task; Dean’s exhausted by the time they collapse into their bed that evening, the kind of deep, pleasant ache in his bones that speaks of a busy day spent doing important work.
In some deep recess of his soul, Dean knows that he’s not being fair to himself, and he tries to fight back as the waves of guilt crash over him. He looks into Cas’ eyes, still shining in the moonlight, and gathers enough courage to put himself first, for once. To make the leap.
Dean heads back to the bunker with Sam while Eileen stays in Vermont with Cas, as she’d adamantly refused (already looking a little green) to get into a moving vehicle for any extended period of time. Dean and Sam spend the next several days packing, a large portion of that time dedicated to sorting through the piles and piles of books in the library, determining which books they want to keep and which they want to leave behind.
They pull apart from each other, their foreheads still touching, Cas maintaining the distance between them with a gentle hand settled on Dean’s shoulder, right over the palm print on his jacket, on his skin. Dean licks his lips involuntarily and is surprised when he tastes salt. It’s only then that he realizes he’s crying; his cheeks are wet with tears. Cas is crying too, he notices, and Dean gently wipes away the tears with his thumb as they fall.
Dean just squeezes him tighter to his chest. He feels a small wet spot soaking through his shirt right where Cas’ face is buried, but Dean doesn’t bother mentioning it. After all, there are a few tears in his eyes, too.
On one particularly awful day two months after Cas’ death, Dean finds himself sitting on the edge of their bed upstairs, head bowed. He hasn’t been here in several months, not since Cas took that first fall, but he had woken up this morning with an urge to be in this room, an urge so powerful that he was able to manage to pull himself, very slowly and carefully, up the stairs.
Sam is so enthusiastic about the idea when Dean calls him the next morning that Dean has half a mind to be offended.
“Yeah, well. Thanks, Sammy,” Dean says gruffly, though he can’t tamp down the smile on his face. “I’m gonna miss you too.”
The silence of the room is broken by the buzz of Dean’s phone. The sound of the plastic case vibrating against the concrete floor feels too loud, too grating in Dean’s shock, but it forces him to pick himself off of the floor and into a sitting position, his back resting against the wall. He doesn’t have to look at his phone to know that it’s Sam calling – who else could it be? – but he picks up his phone to check anyway. It
True to his word, there’s a knock on the door fifty minutes later. Charlie comes bursting through, hair flying as she tackles Dean with a hug. Next to arrive is Bobby, then Donna, then Jody, and before long, their house is filled with the happy buzz of conversation and excitement.
Sam sighs heavily, scrubbing a hand over his face, and pulls out a chair; the loud drag of the legs on the floor make Dean involuntarily grind his teeth. Dean struggles internally, waging a silent war in his mind. Part of him doesn’t want to say anything, doesn’t want to acknowledge the revelation that occurred just before Cas’ death, the
Sam and Eileen are already downstairs in the kitchen, along with Bobby. Dean takes a moment to appreciate the bouquet of flowers on the kitchen counter that he and Cas had arranged last night. It’s lovely, full of pastel pinks, deep purples, and pure whites. Cas wrote out one of his cards to go with it as well, and Dean thinks that he might have to buy a special box just to keep this one in.
“Welcome home, Dean,” Cas says, and Dean pulls him in for a searing kiss. God, it feels so good to hold Cas, to touch him and feel him and taste him, that Dean thinks he might cry.
“What?!” Sam and Cas yell at the same time, turning to look at him with matching incredulous expressions on their faces.
Dean is too, he realizes, but he has absolutely no energy left to make anything for dinner. He doesn’t even know where half of their pots and pans are.
“Sounds great to me,” Dean says, clapping his hands together. “Tell you what, you guys should come up and stay for a week so you can check out houses in person. I’m pretty sure we don’t have any guests coming for another two weeks, right Cas?”
“Alright, alright,” Dean admonishes his insistent stomach as he begins the complicated process of extricating himself from Cas’ limbs without disturbing him. “Hold your horses, I’m getting up.”
Sam does that quick intake of breath again. Dean chances a look at him; he doesn’t look remotely surprised, only sad. Dean puts his head in his hands, grinding the heel of his palms into his eyes until he sees bursts of light behind his eyelids. He’s reminded of the night he first met Castiel, the showers of sparks raining down from the ceiling of the barn, from the heavens, and has to take a deep, steadying breath. He really doesn’t want to cry anymore.
Dean Winchester’s shoulder burns. The heat of it simmers white-hot, radiating right from where Cas had pushed him, as he lies on the cool concrete of the floor. It’s not painful so much as it is grounding; it gives him a solid, physical feeling to focus on, rather than the terrifying well of emotions that he can feel sitting just behind his eyes and in his throat, closer to the surface than they have been in years.
,' Dean groans, and thumps his head against the back of the couch. 'I hate school. I hate everything.'
'Yes,' Castiel nods sincerely. He doesn't know what's going on in Dean's head, but his eyes are full of emotions, at least for the two seconds before Castiel has to direct his attention back on the road.
Anyway, it was pointless. He didn't find anything, no matter what he typed. Dad's fate remained unknown.
The order was clear, and alpha's left. Dean's face crumbles but he won't cry. He'll take this with whatever dignity he has left and maybe then, Castiel will think he's good enough to be allowed back. He ties the sneakers and looks at the living room - their living room, he thought, the nest upstairs, his things in the drawer, the coffee machine he likes, his playlist on the phone, his alpha - all of it no longer his, and he's not sure why. Alpha was happy with him. The only thing that changed it was the call, so - he's gotta be ashamed of Dean. That's what it's gotta be. He doesn't want his family to know about his existence, maybe doesn't want Dean to embarrass him. He did tell him, back at the restaurant, that he'd never fit into the rich lifestyle, that he'd say the wrong things. Or maybe he did something wrong (
'Hey, did he ever call you back?' Dean asks. He forgot about Gabriel, just like he forgot about Mrs. Miller and Benny.
Dean smirks and opens his mouth like he's going to say something - inappropriate? - but he restrains himself at the last minute and just shakes his head. Pity. Castiel would have loved to hear what he had to say.
'What do you think I should do later?' Dean continues, and it surprises Castiel. 'Like, with my life.'
'Uh, pepperoni? If I can? Anything with meat is good,' Dean thinks back to Castiel's note about healthy meals and wonders if he's gonna make him order a vegetable one.
'Look, I appreciate the show,' he says, and it must be clear on Castiel's face and in his scent, how angry he is, because Dean puts a hand on his cheek and runs a thumb across it, in a display of affection so unlike Dean, Castiel brain screeches to a halt. 'I really do. Should shut'em up for a day or two. Now that you've showed them who's boss, I guess you gotta go?'
His words turn to grunts when Castiel knees him into the stomach, hard; Dean thinks he can even hear the snap of his ribs. It's a familiar sound. Dean's not scared; it's like looking at a lion baring his teeth at him from behind a zoo display window; reinforced glass. He knows he's safe, even though his brain keeps sending him overwhelming signals to hide, to submit.
'What do you mean unrestricted?' The waitress, Tina, brings their orders then. The cakes both look incredible. Dean eyes his juice. It has an orange color. At least it's not green.
'It's not weird,' Castiel replies as they're headed to the backyard. It's not too big, but Benny has an impressive grill and a huge target board, and an assortment of knives laid out on the table. Dean's going that way without a conscious thought, while alpha still chats Benny up. 'Actually, I think the antique decor is quite lovely. I especially like the paintings.'
Sam looks up at alpha, as if he's only noticed him now. His face changes. There's a dark frown and his eyes glint with something bad, and Dean thinks,
'I know,' he replies. 'But for years, I had no say in how my life was gonna go. Let me decide for myself.'
'This is her,' he says, and hears the pride in his voice. He shows Castiel but notices that the man is watching his face instead of the phone, and is smiling. He does look down at the pics though.
'Sure. You keep him chained in your bedroom?' he levels Castiel with a gaze, the infuriating smirk making an appearance again. 'Scared I'll have a go at him?'
'Alright, I'm sorry,' alpha hurries to say. 'I met Sam Winchester during a coffee break with Henry. I did not like him. He behaved strangely, and seemed... dangerous. And then I showed Henry your picture, and Sam looked stricken when he saw it. I didn't understand then, it seemed odd, but he asked to - well, he asked to spend a night with you.'
Just like now. Castiel opens the fridge, finds a plate with some chicken and potatoes and puts it in the microwave. He spots a carrot-onion salad he really likes, freshly cut in a bowl on the counter. Which means that Dean prepared it right after he came home, and before he sat down to eat himself.
Dean tells him that he's cooking, trying to help him prepare for the guests. His omega tries to be so good for him. Castiel hates telling him that he has to go, but this is necessary, and they have to hurry, they don't have
'You have Dean's confession,' Castiel points out, already knowing it's futile, but wanting to say it out loud, anyway. The terrible, blunt truth is that Wilson's not going anywhere. Nothing will be done about Dean or about other possible assaults - not
'A nice memory, of something you did before, with your family, perhaps?' Castiel continues, the circles rubbed into Dean's back finally starting to feel comforting. 'Find one nice memory. Close your eyes and think about it.'
,' Charlie emphasizes. 'No one looks at that and thinks hey, let's use their center to correct our omega. That's about twenty years too old.'
Dean watches intently as he writes peanut butter sandwiches (shocker), eggs, cereal, Danish and regular sandwich. He also adds yoghurt and cottage cheese and a long list of different fruit and vegetables.
of your websites,' Dean claims, falling forward into Castiel's embrace. Castiel's hands are busy getting under Dean's sweater and caressing his omega's perfect back. He dips his fingers down Dean's underwear, and Dean's breath speeds up and he spreads his legs in Castiel's lap.
'What should I be pissed about, then?' Castiel asks, calmly, feeling like Dean's about to share something important. He stares at Castiel for a moment, biting his lip, assessing him. And it's heartwrenching, how he deflates suddenly, all his anger gone, and he stares at his hands. It reminds Castiel of how Dean looked back when he arrived at his house. Defeated.
They eat, listening to Robert Plant telling them about his time of dying. Dean loves the burgers, he loves the music, loves the view and being outside and the whole date, and maybe his alpha, just a little, who looks pretty hot in his blue shirt and tie, staring at the city, his pink lips wrapped around the straw. Dean's never been this horny for anyone. He tells himself he can get through it tonight without freaking out, because if there's any good time for a fuck, it's this night.
it. He wants to run, but he won't. No point, he learned ages ago. If he doesn't face it, alpha will make him go through the same psychological game with him, when he's back. But then, alpha will also be sad, so it'll be worse.
Castiel knows omegas can come untouched, but he's never checked if Dean had, and now the guilt eats away at him.
'No,' he replies shortly. 'I wasn't sheltered but I... I mean, I didn't have my phone, and I can't really surf the Internet when it's unrestricted, I don't know how.'
!' something roars, something altogether different than the ghostly voice from before. The chest where they've found the guns is suddenly flung across the room, and the floor, the walls - it all seems to shake. Like during a particularly vicious storm, like the start of an earthquake. Dean feels his teeth chatter.
'I'm here, sweetheart,' Castiel says and Dean opens his eyes, not knowing when he closed them. Alpha crawls inside. He closes the door and they're left alone, cut off from the outside world. Alpha leans closer, tries to fit himself in the backseat so that they're both somewhat comfortable. He ends up stretched over him, his knees at the edge of the seat, one hand next to Dean's head, another on the headrest.
'It's all good,' she says, waving her hand. 'Please try to call me Charlie, okay? Even Charles. I hate it but I can grant you an exclusive license to use it.'
Except he's not grading them. He's just giving Dean tips. As, most likely, mates do. Support each other. Talk about their problems.
'Hell yes,' Dean confirms, feeling bold. Castiel grins, a hint of surprise and excitement, and he lays back down. They listen to songs about love, about depression and solitude, and some of the lines Dean can really identify with. He only realizes he's fallen asleep when Castiel gently takes the bud out of his ear and it wakes him.
'What?' he frowns, and then remembers. Holy shit, they did decide to go to Benny's, on Friday. Dean totally forgot. 'It's still happening?'
'You won't. I'll help you,' alpha leans back in his seat and Dean hates the compartment separating them. 'Keep your foot on the clutch, the other on the brake, just in case, alright?'
'That does sound nice, though,' Charlie considers, sipping the coke. 'I don't even know what to do with Dorothy anymore, for our anniversaries. Feels like we've been everywhere already. That's one upside you guys get, everything's fresh, there's so much to see!'
Alpha's voice brooks no argument. Dean pouts softly, his eyes darting pointedly in Sam's direction, cause really, he's super embarrassed, and alpha should
Castiel holds him so close, like he'll never let him go, and he rubs Dean's neck and back and kisses his head. 'Shh,' he says, and it's so comforting, it's like Dean's wrapped in layers of blankets and hugs and love. 'You're the best thing in my life, baby, I hope I didn't make you think otherwise.'
'You'll hand me my bitch right now,' Alastair says, coolly, something glinting in his hand. A knife, already pressed snugly against the alpha's balls. 'Or I'll cut these off.'
'Oh, The Old Man and The Sea?' Castiel smiles, seeing the cover. 'I see you want to try some classic literature. Have you read it before?'
, and then when alpha does, because of course he does, even though Dean's body expected the opposite, he bolts and makes it to the corner of the kitchen - whole four steps away - and stops there, like an idiot that he is.
'Ugh,' Dean groans and looks to the ceiling. 'Seriously. I don't even care about Othello. I'm only in this class cause I need it to pass the first year and then I'll be out of your hair, and never read any books ever again. Can't you go easy on me?'
'I found Alastair's contact info and I called him. I wanted to ask him to let me see you, cause I hoped he'd be reasonable, but if he weren't, I was gonna sue him to get you out of there,' Sam says, quickly, stumbling over his words. He smells of shame and regret, and Dean feels like the earth is crumbling underneath his feet. 'So we met. There was no discussion. He just said if he sees me again, you'll pay the price,' there are tears in Sam's eyes, and this time, he lets them fall. 'I said I'll fight him in court. He said he'll make sure you'll be too broken to belong to anyone. I wanted to hurt him,' Sam swallows, hard. 'But I couldn't. If I got arrested, there'd be no one left to watch over you. I had to - to wait. Because I was gonna get you out. But until then, I just - I had to see you. And I think he knew that. He texted me, he said that if I come tomorrow, I'll see what I caused. I knew, I knew it was a trap, but I just couldn't not go,' Sam drops his eyes, and Dean knows that he's going to hate what comes next.
'He is a bit of a baby, yeah,' Dean replies without missing a beat, and the girl just gets madder and madder. She glances back at Theo, who watches them with his lips pursed and something like hope in his eyes. Fuck, Dean thinks, fuck. It sucks to be owned and helpless and it's so easy to forget how it feels.
Though Dean feels like he ruined the meeting a little, it was still great at Benny's, and he hopes the man doesn't regret inviting them. The food was awesome, spending laid-back time with a cool alpha was awesome, talking about weapons and rougarous was awesome. Benny tells him to come over anytime; tells
'Okay,' Dean says and lingers there even when alpha goes to the kitchen. They can still see each other in the open space, but Dean's a little scared. Finally, he turns around and manages a tight smile at Charlie, who looks kind of nervous as well, sitting down by the coffee table with her hands wrapped around her middle.
'When Sammy comes over, I - well, I dunno what he's like, now, but - we used to be brothers, you know? Not alpha and omega. I never acted like an omega around him, so what I'm saying is - I might not behave so well when he comes over. You know, omega-wise.'
'Should I leave?' Dean asks immediately. He doesn't really wanna, he wants to stay here and be here for alpha, but maybe he'd like some privacy.
Dean sends him an unconvinced smile, but he falls quiet and eats his salad. Later, he browses his old phone for hours, smelling like longing, when Castiel tries to sleep, wishing he could read all of Dean's messages, wishing he knew even more about his past. Wishing he knew that their future will turn out good.
The rest of the evening and the night are quiet. Castiel can't sleep for a long time, thinking about the events of the day and the project he's working on. It's nothing that major, but he needs to catch up on some coding if he wants to turn it in on time. Especially now, that Dean's constantly on his mind. It's nearly impossible to try and ignore him, like he successfully did for three weeks.
,' Castiel insists, refusing to acknowledge the stab of pain he felt at Dean's disbelief. Disbelief, or reluctance? Perhaps it really is just what everyone else is saying. Castiel heard them, the teachers gossiping, his own brother calling him to tell him how insane he is.
Dean stops when he hears the voice and sort of freezes. He turns around and suddenly looks young and uncertain and scared, surveying the car - and Castiel - closely. After a moment, he must understand that he won't be left alone.
It looks like mother didn't age much. She still has her brown hair neatly arranged, her blue, piercing eyes that he probably inherited are still calculating and analyzing, even as she sees him for the first time in twenty years. Her suit - something she's always insisted on wearing - looks impeccable and expensive. Next to her stands Michael - and he looks older, but he's still dashing, he's still the kind of man everyone swoons over. But Castiel knows him, and in his arrogant smirk, in the darkness behind his fake-friendly gaze, he sees cold steel. He's taken after mother, stylish and elegant on the exterior, frigid and ruthless on the inside.
'Thank you,' Castiel says, and ends the call. He texts Benny the address and comes out to talk to Dean, steeling himself for the hard conversation they're about to have.
'My dad used to drink too,' he shares, seemingly out of nowhere. He doesn't talk about his past life, either. Like an unspoken pact between them.
You're doing so good, but recovery always takes time, and you have to let it. You're so kind to me, but you have to be kind to yourself too, sometimes.'
He sits up silently, confused, and leaves the bed to follow Dean. He makes sure to keep his footsteps quiet, because he doesn't want to scare him. Dean didn't even look back once, so he probably still doesn't know he woke Castiel up.
'That means no taking off the collar when you go outside. No hiding when you're sick or feel bad. Telling me when something happens.'
Then, there were other things, like the chapter called INTERCOURSE where Castiel actually highlighted a couple of lines, especially the one about omegas getting slick on their own.
'Well, let's check out the hardware store, then,' Castiel takes his hand as if he can read his mind, and they go. On the way there, Dean sees something that draws his attention big time. He slows down to stare at the display of one of the home decor stores. There's a big
'Yeah, and I - when he told me he lost you - and those were the words he used, Dean, man, I thought I was gonna-'
'Well, he never said it out loud,' Dean replies weakly. 'He always said he needed to get him. But. Yeah,' he thinks back to how it felt, being on the road with dad. Without mom and without a home, and without regular life. It wasn't always bad - hell, sometimes he enjoyed it - but there were things he never admitted he missed. 'That guy... he killed my mom, alpha.'
'Do you want to go upstairs? I'll help you finish the nest, if you'd let me,' Castiel offers just now, Dean blinking the memories away and smiling uncertainly.
'I didn't - didn't warn you-' Castiel tries to pant, tries to gather his scattered thoughts. 'Before I came.'
'But I want to,' replies Castiel, his eyes shining. 'I'd like to keep the lights on, and to see your face, and to help you climax.'
He got so lucky, but he misses Alastair. He doesn't know how he feels, now that he's gone. Is this where he'll spend the rest of his sorry life? With this strange, awkward alpha? But he's polite, and fair. He hasn't punished Dean for anything, yet. Maybe he's just lenient, or maybe Dean's doing well so far. If anything, it's a change, right? Right. Still, Dean kinda wishes Alastair would walk through the door, and tell Dean to prepare dinner. Back at their worn out, gray house, where Dean intimately knew every corner. He misses the blue and grey mugs he kept in the cupboard. Misses the floormat that was a bitch to clean; he did it with a brush, getting into all crevices until it looked good as new. Even misses the view from the floor next to Alastair's bed. The light would stream through the small window, and in the summer, the sun would reach his bare legs and warm them. Dean liked those mornings; he could just lie there for a while, prepare for the day, with Alastair snoring next to him. He could almost pretend they were sleeping together, and he felt safer.
'Alpha, shouldn't we keep driving though?' Dean asks, because he can't just take the win like a regular person. 'I mean. We've already been here a day. I don't know if we can stay another.'
'Are you gonna clean it up?' he'd asked, in a monotone voice, but observing him curiously. Like Dean was a new species of animal, and he was just getting to know him.
Alpha being so energetic is a weird thing to get used to, but Dean doesn't exactly mind. He goes to sit by Castiel's side, and they google nesting. It's a website for alphas, and there's a picture of a bird in a nest and a lot of text.
'I'm trying to show you,' Castiel says, slowly, thinking over his words. 'That we are partners. We are
He can see Dean roll his eyes one final time before he nods and disappears, always in a hurry. Maybe he has a bus he really needs to catch.
'You're right, I'm not good at explaining,' he gives up, sounding annoyed at himself. 'Would you like to listen to one of their songs to see what I mean?'
'Come here, already,' Castiel grabs his hand again, and tugs him down. 'You look very handsome in this shirt.'
It's the first time - probably ever - that he demands something from an alpha, and it scares the hell out of him, but he does it. Despite his freak out, he's still horny. Dean doesn't know Castiel as well as he'd like to, but this alpha tries more than anyone did for him, and it has to mean something, it just has to.
'Well, I enjoy it,' Castiel considers it. 'But most of all, I like getting to glimpse people's personalities through their works. It doesn't always show, of course, but sometimes-'
'I never knew- I didn't know you could do that!' he exclaims in awe, and he's so sweaty, they haven't even really started - 'Feels so good-'
'Fine, cocoa then,' Dean rolls his eyes and gets up to prepare it. Castiel reaches for another candy bar and unwraps it, and eats it slowly, his thoughts spinning in his mind like wheels on the asphalt, getting somewhere, surely, but not knowing where until they stop. So far, they haven't. It feels like a hangover, but without nausea.
He means it, though he thinks that it comes out snappy and petulant. He closes his eyes, stubbornly set on falling asleep and putting this argument behind them. He ruined everything, fuck. He always does.
But there's only a pause, and Dean doesn't look up but he thinks Castiel sounds puzzled when he says:
He stares at Castiel's face from his position on the porcelain floor of the tub. He knows some arousal must be showing on his own face and he can smell and feel that he's slicking. Usually, he'd feel humiliated, but Castiel's not holding him down, not making him do it - if anything, he looks like he's holding back, biting his lip, many conflicting emotions in his scent.
A dawning realization washes over him, an understanding that maybe making the world a better place doesn’t always have to involve throwing himself into harm’s way. That it can also take the form of other things, like baking homemade cinnamon rolls, too.
Florence tilts her head up to the sky, a contemplative expression on her face. “It is,” she says after a moment. “But . . .”
The three of them try to maintain their formation as best as they can, but it’s difficult due to how outnumbered they are. They’re a good team, though, and they make it down to Sam’s shouted “Fourteen!” before Dean takes a hit.
of Cas’ heartbeat under his palm. He holds Cas’ gaze steady, his own heart in his throat, and says, “I love you too, Cas, you absolute idiot.”
The impact of the book on the table causes a couple drops of Dean’s coffee to slosh over the rim of the mug. He looks up at Cas, glaring, while pointedly wiping away the spilled liquid with his shirtsleeve. Cas just levels him with an entirely unamused stare.
“We did all of it ourselves,” Arthur says, a note of pride in his voice. “Forty years ago now, back when we first moved in.”
Cas spends much of his time during the fall and winter after they move in outside in the garden. Dean helps out where he can, following Cas’ instructions for which plants to water and where to weed, though he mostly focuses on making food for the guests. In return, Cas helps him out in the kitchen, doing prep work (helpful) or stealing bites of food before it’s ready (not as helpful, though Dean only half-heartedly complains about it since Cas always tells him how delicious it is).
Cas just glares at him, tying the piece of shirt around Dean’s arm just above his wound and knotting it tightly.
Dean is up faster than he realized his body could move at his age. His joints pop and groan in protest, but he doesn’t pay them any mind, focused solely on reaching Cas where he lays near the front door.
They eat in comfortable silence, side by side on the bed. Cas steals all of his mushrooms, as usual, which Dean pretends to be upset about, as usual. Through the windows, they watch as the sun sets slowly, painting the sky in vibrant reds and oranges, then muted pinks and purples, before disappearing beyond the horizon and gently yielding to the moon and stars.
Cas takes the leftovers downstairs to the fridge while Dean starts to get ready for bed. He strips down into just his boxers – the heat of the day still hasn’t quite left the night air – and heads to the bathroom, staking claim to the right side of the double sink vanity.
Inside, Cas’ soft snores fill the air instead, though they are slightly muffled because Cas’ face is pressed against Dean’s neck. Dean brushes a soft, lingering kiss to the top of Cas’ head, reveling in the way Cas snuggles even closer to him. Dean can feel the small puffs of breath against his skin with every exhale Cas makes, a constant, welcome reminder that Cas is
Cas throws his head back and laughs, deep and genuine, and Dean wants to bottle the sound up and keep it with him forever. “Believe me, I was planning on it.”
Dean blinks hard and the image is gone, though it leaves behind a strange sense of longing that he isn’t quite sure what to make of.
Dean finds himself standing in the middle of a dirt road after he dies, blinking in the sudden sunlight. The road stretches out endlessly in both directions, and Dean breathes a sigh of relief as he takes in the familiar hills and valleys of the landscape. He knows this place; he’s lived here for over forty years.
that I won’t see you after I die. What if we end up somewhere different from each other, Cas? What if I never see you again? I wouldn’t be able to handle that, I wouldn’t –” Dean has to stop talking; he’s crying too hard now, tears pouring from his eyes, down his cheeks, splashing into his lap.
She pats around her jean’s pockets, reaching inside them when she presumably doesn’t feel what she’s looking for. “Arthur, have you –”
At that exact moment, the morning sun climbs high enough in the sky that it shines right through the window, beaming down onto their bed. It hits Cas, backlighting his face and messy hair in a bright, golden halo of sunshine. Dean sucks in a breath, suddenly reminded of that image he had seen in his head, eight years ago now, when they had first visited this house. Dean doesn’t know why, but he feels his eyes start to prick with moisture, a lump forming in his throat.
been kind of a dick to Cas the last couple of days, not that he’d meant to be. It’s just hard to play nice when you feel like a piece of shit for abandoning a life where you can actually help people and trading it for a peaceful, monster-free life in Vermont instead.
The front door opens directly into a single large room that seems to encompass most of the downstairs. A large, airy living room is situated to their immediate left, beams of light streaming in through a bay window that overlooks the front garden, making the hardwood floors gleam. There’s a red brick fireplace built into the wall, offering a warmth and coziness to the space despite it not being lit. Slightly off to their right is the kitchen, completely open to the rest of the house. Dean follows Cas as he makes his way over there, running his hands along the granite countertop of the island situated in the middle. It’s smooth, cool to his touch, and Dean can’t help but think about how nice it would be to have this kind of space to cook in. More often than not, he’s the one in charge of making food back at the bunker. He doesn’t mind cooking for everyone – he actually really enjoys it – but it
“Do you, Dean, promise to love and cherish Castiel, in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, and forsaking all others, keep yourself only unto him, for as long as you both shall live?”
It’s . . . actually a pretty good idea, Dean thinks. It would be nice to be able to meet new people every once in a while. Plus, Dean’s been getting pretty handy at making a damn good breakfast.
They’re about an hour away from their destination when rustling from the backseat indicates that Sam has finally decided to grace them with his presence. Dean glances in the rearview mirror and sure enough, Sam’s sitting up, bleary-eyed and yawning.
Cas – at least, his physical form – doesn’t move at Dean’s touch, but he can feel Cas’ presence shifting around him. He hears his name, “Dean,” said in Cas’ voice, though he doesn’t think there was an actual sound made out loud. Instead, the voice passes through him like a force, like something more physical, before fading into nothingness, just a whisper on the wind. Dean’s shoulder and heart are burning but the tugging feeling, the one that guided him to Cas, is gone, replaced simply with a feeling of completeness, of contentment, now that he has found what he was looking for, what he was missing. He moves his hand from Cas’ face to rest his palm over Cas’ heart, and thinks,
, whether they’re back at the bunker, in a random motel, or on vacation in Vermont. And it’s amazing. Dean couldn’t ask for a better way to start his mornings.
The house sits a few hundred feet back from the road, the front surrounded by a short, freshly painted white picket fence. It’s moderately sized from what Dean can see; two stories tall with lots of large windows that glint in the afternoon sun. The majority of the house is painted a cheerful yellow color while the trim is painted white. The most notable feature, however, is the massive garden that looks like it has essentially taken over the entire front yard.
The vampires are coming at them from all angles now, forcing them to break their formation. Dean watches out of the corner of his eye as a vamp swipes at Cas, very nearly missing his throat.
Dean watches as Cas takes the first bite, his own excitement about trying the cinnamon rolls momentarily forgotten in favor of seeing Cas’ reaction to them. Cas bites, chews; his eyes close in pleasure and he honest-to-God
“Of course, Cas,” Dean says quickly, eyes still locked on where his hand is touching Cas’ chest, his heart. “I – There was . . .” he tries haltingly, the adrenaline of the day wearing off, making him less forthcoming with his words. “There was never any other choice for me, you know?” he finally finishes with a weak laugh, pulling away and scratching the back of his neck, suddenly embarrassed.
Sam finally steps back from where he’s been hunched over, working on the summoning spell. The Empty materializes out of thin air, black and horrible, like tar. Dean stands, rooted at the spot, just looking at it, Sam at his side. He has a small flask gripped in his hand and nothing else, nothing but the clothes on his back. He feels strange, almost naked, without some sort of weapon on him, but he knows bringing a gun or knife with him into the Empty would be useless.
They’re sitting on the porch together late one spring evening, Cas tucked under a blanket and Dean tucked into his side, listening quietly to the chirping of the cicadas. The flowers in the garden are blooming, filling the night with their vibrant colors and sweet scent.
to do, like buying towels for the downstairs bathroom or installing a new light fixture over the kitchen table. Now, though, they’ve reached a point where the house is as decorated as it's going to get, the website that Sam helped them create for their bed and breakfast is up and running, and they’ve got all of this extra
Dean looks up at the sky and watches as a shooting star streaks across it, its tail glowing fiery white. He’s reminded of angels.
Dean finds Cas in the garden, just like he knew he would. Cas looks up from where he’s kneeling over the paper daisies –
Florence gives them both one last hug before they leave, making them promise to take care of the garden, and Dean and Cas reassure her that they will. Dean’s pretty sure Cas has already been doing research about gardening, if the multiple books about flowers that have been popping up around the bunker for the past couple of months are anything to go by.
Dean sucks in an involuntary breath, his vision blurring slightly. The tips of his fingers, from the second knuckle to his fingernails, are entirely red. Deep and dark. His hands, his fingers, they look . . .
Dean feels that same excitement reflected within himself. As he stands there next to Cas, holding the keys to this house, their
“Well,” Cas says, stepping into the center of the room and spreading his arms wide. “How do I look?”
Cas picks up the package and unwraps it, revealing an old, obviously well-loved copy of a book titled
currently occupied with advances on him, large and menacing, a terrible smile twisting its pale face. Dean is totally overpowered with no available back-up. Damn.
; he doesn’t want to lose him to a goddamned monster that happened to get lucky that day. And, well, the lifestyle they currently lead is entirely conducive to putting oneself in a position that allows monsters to get lucky.
Dean isn’t sure how long he lies there, staring at the spot where Cas had stood minutes – or was it hours? – ago, once again sacrificing himself for the Winchesters. For Dean, specifically. Because Dean knows now, he knows with an absolute certainty that almost scares him, that everything Cas has done, every mistake he has made and every battle he has fought, has all been, in some way, for Dean. It makes Dean want to scream, loudly enough that his voice reaches the Empty, so Cas will know that somewhere along the line, everything Dean did became something done for Cas, too. That somewhere along the line, or maybe even from the very beginning when Cas had gripped him tight and raised him from Hell, Dean had fallen in love with Cas, too.
“I feel like I made one of the best decisions of my life,” Dean says honestly, bringing Cas’ palm to his lips and pressing a sleepy kiss there.
“It was important to us to have a garden when we bought this house, since we’re both so passionate about flowers,” Florence continues. “We started working on this garden as soon as we moved in, about forty years ago now, like Arthur said.” She lets out a laugh. “Jesus, Arthur, we’re getting old!”
Dean picks up old frames at antique stores and Cas gets photos printed out at their local Costco to put into them. They display the pictures all around their house: on the walls, the fireplace mantle, the upstairs dressers. Everywhere becomes filled with the people in their lives that they love, as well as the people that aren’t in their lives anymore but that they want to remember.
Cas’ ring gleams in the early morning sunlight as it makes its way above the horizon and through the windshield of the car. It’s dark grey, made of tungsten so that Cas doesn’t have to worry about scratching it up during a hunt or anything like that. Dean eyes his own ring, similar to Cas’ except that it's a little lighter in color, and can’t help the smile that he feels growing on his face. They’re nice rings, to be sure, but what he loves most about them is what they symbolize: that he gets to spend the rest of his life with Cas.
The tendrils of sleep still cling to Dean, trying to pull him under. They open up his chest, his heart, letting words spill out that he normally wouldn’t have the courage to voice in the harsher light of day.
Cas is standing in front of the large farmhouse sink, peering out of the window above it. Dean comes to stand next to him, pulling himself from fantasies involving being able to prep multiple dishes at once. The window overlooks the backyard, where even more flowers and what looks like a small vegetable garden grow, as well as the expansive valley and rolling hills beyond the property.
“Every flower has its own special meaning,” Arthur explains. “For example, the blue violets over there represent faithfulness. And red roses represent love.” He points first towards a low-growing patch of small, bluish-purple flowers nestled next to the fence, then towards a large rosebush full of red roses that sits beneath the bay window. Smiling, he crosses his arms over his chest and leans backwards against the porch swing, gazing out over the garden. “One of the great things about being a florist was getting to know the language of flowers.”
“Dean,” Cas says, his voice quiet, rough, and damn, does it feel good to hear Cas say his name. He gazes at Dean with a sort of wary, hopeful earnestness. “How were you able to find me?”
There’s a gnawing guilt in Dean’s chest that holds him back from jumping after Cas. As much as he wants this – the house with the garden and the kitchen and the lack of things that go bump in the night – he feels like he’s being horribly selfish, leaving it all behind. Dean’s done a lot of bad things, made a lot of mistakes, and he can’t help but feel . . .
The house comes up on their right, the first one they’ve seen for miles. A hand-painted “Open House” sign sits on the side of the road, several bright orange balloons tied to it. Dean eases his foot off of the gas, slowing down as they approach.
Dean may be sitting on the floor of an abandoned warehouse with an injured, bleeding arm, surrounded by the dead bodies of twenty-one vampires, but he doesn’t think he’s ever been happier.
"They do," Cas agrees. His hands are covered in flour, his shirt is crinkly and the top button unbuttoned, sleeves rolled up.
They started in the bunker. Back when Cas struggled with being homeless and they invited him to live with them. Sam's not entirely sure what changed, or rather which change was the catalyst, but something must have shifted one day, and then he found the two men wrapped up around each other on the couch watching Star Trek.
Not three days later the bunker is filled with a loud e-guitar solo coming from the sound system. Dean enters the war room dramatically, nodding along. Sam looks up from his research, laughs. Before he can say anything:
Sam watches them, observing Dean's hand on Cas. He can't help but smile and decides to slip out of the kitchen unnoticed, to give these two some privacy.
After that's done Cas says, "Maybe I should leave you two and come back once I've learned how to take care of myself."
Just one look at Dean in his crumpled sweatpants and sleep-in shirt, fuzzy face and bed hair and grumpy demeanor, sipping his coffee (black) and shoveling in his eggs (almost black) is all it takes: Cas feels lost again.
After a while Cas' head rolls to the other side, leaving Dean to relax again. Not long after, Cas' eyes blink open, and with a yawn he asks "Are we there yet?" His voice is deep and filled with sleep, and he stretches, bumping into Dean as he moves his arms and legs into his space. Then the fucker just leaves them there, knee against Dean's, arm touching Dean's thigh. Dean wants to complain, because he
He's curled up on his bed and cries and laughs and feels more human than he ever has before, and after a while, his body stops shaking and his nose stops running and he's just there, sobbing quietly, and there's a knock on the door.
Dean spends a week and four shopping trips trying to find the perfect gifts. He's satisfied finally, having wrapped them imperfectly but at least completely, but suspicious of Sam for not having asked to take Baby once.
"Why should we spend our time fighting and waring when we could be gentle and loving instead?" he says, expecting no answer.
It feels like only a few minutes pass, and then Dean's movements are slowing down. Eventually he stops massaging altogether, but he's still touching, moving his hands to Cas' waist, then up his back, fingers slipping under Cas' shirt. He stops when he's at the base of Cas' neck, and pulls his hands out again.
"I-" for a second it seems like Cas is going to fight it, lie about not doing such a thing, but he concedes. "I'm sorry if it makes you uncomfortable."
When Sam returns to the library he finds Dean inspecting Cas' face, one hand curled around the collar of the trench coat, index finger of the other hand slowly stroking over Cas' bottom lip. His brows are furrowed, a concentrated expression on his face that contrasts heavily with the look of panic in Castiel's eyes.
Why? Because apparently humans need eight (according to the internet) or six (according to Sam) or at the very least four (according to Dean) hours of sleep, and Cas is barely getting them.
Castiel might never get used to being human. He had been an angel for several hundred million years before losing his grace. A human lifespan, even a long one, is
They pack their stuff and get ready after breakfast, and leave for Colorado by midday. Cas, in the back seat, is nervous about the whole thing turning out to be nothing, and keeps fidgeting with the window crank.
Dean pushes himself off the sink and continues to brush his teeth. He's not in the mood for talking about Micheal, so it's best that Cas doesn't know that there was yet another attack, stronger than the last.
Thoughts of Dean, about the hunter's hand on his neck, and his palm spreading over his back, massaging. Innocent thoughts, wishing he knew how it felt if Dean folded himself over Cas' back, warm against him, holding him and not letting go, whispering in Cas' ear, "Is it helping?",
It's mostly quiet. They've all had a long day, and they all will have to get up early to wrap the case up before anyone else gets hurt. Cas and his brother are probably in bed already, like Sam, lights shut off, maybe tossing and turning like he does. But every now and again pieces of muffled conversation float over. Sam can't make it out, not even a single word, but he recognises Dean's voice, softer, more intimate than he's used to, but unmistakably Dean's. Sometimes a gruff reply from Cas' side.
, gesturing to Cas to come cuddle in with him, and Cas can't say no to that, so it's not the right time anyways.
Sam chuckles. "You're overreacting, Dean. And no, I don't exactly know what his lips look like. Sorry," he adds to Cas with a grin on his face, "I don't stare at you like he does."
Cas, who has followed Dean to the light switch, gapes at it like a child seeing Santa for the first time, and Sam and Dean can't help but stare too: Sam's staring at the tree, thinking about how this is something they couldn't ever have as kids; Dean's staring at Cas, at the golden sparkles in his eyes and the bits of lametta still hanging off of him.
"Dean, can we talk?" Cas asks carefully, eyes fixed on the spoon he's drying off. In his peripheral vision, he sees Dean go still and turn his head towards him.
Castiel hesitates for a moment. Dean is being so nice to him, so protective and caring, and he's about to selfishly use him for his own benefit. That's what being human does to you, apparently.
Dean turns back to the sink to spit and rinse to give himself some time to think. By the time he plops his toothbrush back into the glass and wipes his mouth dry with the sleeve of his flannel he still doesn't have an answer. He shrugs.
"Whoa, that should be enough tinsel," Sam says and moves the box to the ground so he can open the last box too, which is, again, full of ornaments, and also includes a long string of lights.
He opens his mouth, almost says "I'm fine, thank you, Sam" but stops himself last second, and forces himself to be truthful.
. The choice between the two falls to Castiel, who, unsurprisingly, decides that tacky romance is the way to go.
Cas tilts his head in disbelief but doesn't fight him on it. Instead, he pushes the door closed behind him and takes a step closer.
Dean's sure that Cas means both Dean and Sam, and yet his snarky reply is stuck in his throat. He swallows hard and sits down on the couch.
Dean yanks down his hand and turns towards him. His mouth opens, but he has to think for two seconds. "Did you give Cas strange fruit?" he snaps.
"Holy—," he starts. "What was that, Cas?" He stares at the angel, who at least has the decency to look abashed.
"It's really nothing," Cas says and pulls his face away from Dean's examining and - frankly - grabby hands.
He comes back an hour later, drawn in by the smell of freshly baked cookies. The kitchen floor is covered in flour, and empty pots are all around the messy countertop. Dean is wiping it off as good as he can, and Castiel is kneeling in front of the oven, staring into it, assumingly to watch the second batch of cookies bake.
Cas looks at the toilet and it's over for him; He starts gagging and puking and his muscles convulse painfully. His fingers wrap around the toilet seat, holding on tightly. It's probably the worst thing he has ever experienced.
Dean unloads a stack of decoration boxes he found stashed away somewhere onto the floor next to the tree. He wipes the sweat from his forehead, rolls up his sleeves and opens the topmost box. Sam takes a look at the contents, Dean steps back and fixes his eyes on Cas.
Meanwhile, Dean's brain short-circuits, and he's left there standing between his brother and Cas, mouth open to say something but instead gaping like a fish out of water, every possible string of words escaping his thoughts before he can say them out loud. A punch from Sam into his side snaps him out of his trance.
, but Sam answers "One more hour, give or take," and stops for gas. While Cas is in the restroom Dean buys him a cereal bar ("for strength"), which Cas gratefully accepts with a soft "Thank you, Dean" and a smile that could give you diabetes. Dean does not miss Sam's amused headshake.
Dean feels his stomach churn. "No," he challenges, and pats the space behind his back in what he hopes is an inviting gesture. He's closing his eyes now, tightly, not to fall asleep, but to hide from what happens next.
Cas nods, obviously appreciating Sam's lesson. "I guess I didn't sleep well," he says finally. He slips a spoonful of kiwi into his mouth.
"Sam and me will make sure you're not going to leave unnecessary scars if that's what you're worried about," Dean tells him, eyes on the arm that was reaching for him a moment ago.
Dean's annoyed that he gets a question as an reply and doesn't even consider answering it. "Fine, don't tell me."
Cas' eyes open slowly, and his gaze travels up, stopping at Dean's lips for a short while, then continuing up until they meet Dean's eyes.
Cas continues, "Even when I was homeless, what I missed more than anything was you." His voice is soft.
He laughs at the absurdity of it all; of an angel becoming mortal, falling first to earth and then head over heels for the Righteous Man he pulled out of damnation, the man who could never return the love that waited for millennia, the love of an angel (or of what used to be an angel), an ancient love; whatever it really is and was.
"Sammy, commotion at the so-called 'Heritage Center'. I'm guessing it's our Casper," Dean shouts through the door.
He attempts to ground himself, tastes the bitter toothpaste, feels the cool ceramic against his palms — little anchors to help him stay in reality. If he slips up, even for just a second, if he leans into the feeling in any way the door might give way and everything that he, Sam, Cas, and Jack have worked for would be destroyed, crumbling away under Michael's iron grip.
Dean continues, "I'm—", he doesn't quite know which words to use. Being vulnerable doesn't come easy to him, and confiding in
Fingertips start pressing Cas' his skin, right above his hips, massaging softly. Cas is glad he had the foresight to hold his breath, because he almost lets a groan escape from his lips.
When Dean and Cas arrive in the living room ten minutes later, Dean's face is still flushed red. Cas shoots Sam a quick awkward glance, but is immediately distracted by the sight of the Christmas tree and gifts.
Cas nods and lets Dean guide him to their hotel room with a hand on his shoulder. Once inside, Dean wants to push Cas down to sit on the bed so that he can examine him closer, but Cas beelines to the bathroom, stomach twisting and turning.
Soon the first box of decorations is used up, and Sam opens the next one. This one is full of lametta. Metallic golden and silver, glittering strips, many packages of them, filling up the whole box.
Nevertheless, a few weeks later Dean sits him down and tells him that Cas and him are together now and that he doesn't want any stupid comments.
Cas starts feeling better on the third day since his injury, and they leave town, counting themselves lucky that the spirit seems to have vanished. Dean insists on sitting next to Cas, in the middle seat, in case Cas starts feeling worse again. Sam is driving, and he keeps shooting glances into the rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of them, so Dean doesn't dare touch Cas even though he desperately wants to.
"Oh," Dean says again. He feels dumb. Once he processes Cas' words, there's a fluttering in his stomach he has a hard time ignoring.
"You alright?" Dean asks him as soon as they're outside watching Sam drive away. "Just a few more steps."
Dean is pretty sure that the earth stops turning when Cas kisses him. It's a fleeting kiss, lips barely touching, a soft touch on the corner of his mouth, over as quickly as it started. But its message is clear. Dean feels like he has been turned to stone, standing stiff and holding his breath, unbelieving that Cas could reciprocate his feelings.
Dean doesn't know if Sam feels the same way. He tried asking him about it once, but it's really difficult to ask "Hey, does your heart skip a beat when you see Cas yawn?" or "Sammy, do you ever think about Cas when you're about to fall asleep, just so maybe he appears in your dreams?" so Dean ended up stuttering and blushing and steering the conversation back to the topic of the dinner they were eating.
Dean looks sad now, awfully so, and the sight of it fills Cas with remorse. Dean doesn't say anything for a while, and Cas thinks maybe he's waiting for him to elaborate.
So Sam starts up Netflix and Dean leaves just to come back a few minutes later with two mugs of hot chocolate. He hands one of them to Cas, who accepts it with a thankful nod and sips at it carefully, and puts the other one down on the coffee table before sitting down on the couch on Cas' side.
Blood is rushing through his ears as he begins to leave the kitchen, slow and almost mechanical. One step in front of the next.
And that ends the conversation. Dean shakes his head and looks at the tree, and the single package under it.
"It's okay," he said, parroting her words, lowering his free hand to touch Viridius lightly. Daphne sighed happily and cupped his cheek. He could feel the panic begin to leave them both. At the edge of his vision, the man and his dæmon stood and watched them.
"Constant." His voice was the same, a rumbling exhalation, but that was all there was. Only his voice, his eyes and his expression. Nothing through the link, in fact, no link at all. "I was afraid that you - " He paused, sounding almost panicked -
"And, hey, look at that," he said weakly, gesturing toward the horizon. "Sun snuck up on us. Was that you or me?"
But it didn't feel like Dean or Prosper. No hot, amber-thick sunlight, almost too immediate and bright to face without flinching, no engine-roar of tattered, defiant feeling.
Outside, he stalked across the short distance that separated the motel door from Baby, dropping his hands down on her hood and bending his head over her black surface, gleaming darkly beneath the parking lot's dim lighting. "Goddamn it, Cas." His hands curled into fists, he dug them in against the warm metal. "If you don't get down here now - " He stopped, swallowing hard to regain control of his voice. "Lemme guess, you're commanding an army, you've got your hands full directing a bunch of junkless rays of light around. Well, I don't give two fucks, you hear me? We need you. Just get here." He held his breath, waited. Kept waiting.
"And you'll come back to us?" She asked quietly. She looked at him, her pale eyes clouded with doubt.
He turned. Castiel was standing behind him, loose-tied and tightly wound, that strange combination of unkempt and controlled that was all Cas. Only Cas. His hair was more rumpled than Dean had seen it in years, and he glanced away from Dean, looking up, something harried around his eyes, something unhappy around his mouth. Dean got the feeling that he had flown down in a hurry, and he was relieved, so goddamn relieved to see him that he could just - "About freaking time," he snapped. "What the hell took you so long?"
Prosper wondered why that might be. Dean's instincts may have been more right about Castiel than they had realized, if the angel was capable of sidestepping orders. She also wondered why they didn't seem concerned that she was listening to every word they spoke, but then again, she was hardly more than an animal to them, wasn't she? Even to Anna, who had clung so desperately to Theodore in the moments before she took back her grace.
"Whoa, whoa," Ash said, dropping the whiskey bottle with a clatter and quick-stepping toward Dean, "Careful with the hardware, man."
"They're probably not telling us a bunch of stuff." He shrugged, trying to dismiss her, and picked the book back up. "It's been four months. He's been hunting alone, that right there's enough to mess with anyone's head."
"Not for this," Cas said hastily, lifting their joined hands. "Well. Of course for this, but this is...this is just a fraction of what I'm trying to thank you for."
"I'm not," Dean said defensively, glancing away from the road to scowl at her. "And shut up, Sammy."
"You got about ninety seconds," Dean said tightly, as the columns of smoke arched and curved and began to spiral down toward them. The first wave of human-riding demons burst through the distant labyrinthine opening. "Keep together. Don't let 'em - " And then he was out of time, and fuck, they didn't even have ninety seconds, did they? They probably had about ten until the demons tore them apart, and he hadn't gotten the chance to hold Prosper one last time, or to thank her, for sticking with him, for loving him when he hadn't been able to love himself. But she knew, she knew. Dean adjusted his grip on the blade, pressing his shoulder more firmly against Sammy's, and really, it wasn't so bad a way to go -
"Uh, yeah," she answered, like she was talking to a couple of idiots. All this time and they still didn't know her name; she and Adam had never trusted them enough to share it.
Castiel leaned toward him again. "If you want the Word - hello, Prosper - you'll have to duck Hester and her soldiers."
When Sam stopped by a couple hours later, all kitted out in his ridiculous jogging gear, his hippie hair held back from his face with a freaking headband, it was to Dean posted up on the back deck with a beer in one hand and the iron fire poker in the other.
"Why do humans couch their intentions behind so many needless layers?" For a split second Dean thought that Connie was calling him out, but then he continued on. "It's impossible to know what any single person truly wants from us. All these elaborate rituals, and we follow them so desperately, as if the world would slip into chaos if we spoke the unadorned truth to one another."
"But you don't think that I - " Sam stopped, the corner of his mouth twitching spasmodically. "You think I couldn't feel the same?"
"Come again?" Mary said. She shot Prosper a look, as if hoping that she might give a different, more sensible answer.
"Because they're afraid of Lucifer's kid and what it might do to heaven," Prosper pointed out. "They didn't much care when he was on the loose and burning through people down here."
But Dean didn't want to hear that, and the truth wasn't a comfort to either of them. Prosper didn't say anything, lifting her head to push her nose in against his hand instead. Dean shook her off.
It moved so easily between them these days, this warm feeling, this open sky of a link. "You deserve that too, Dean," she said.
Dean insisted that he could drive through the night, but Mary insisted that they stop, and so, some twelve hours later, Castiel was opening a motel room door and ushering Jack and Juniper inside.
"Yeah, but you can fix that no problem, right?" Cas looked back at him, all dark-eyed, focused intent, that old stare of his that had never bothered Dean the way he knew it should. Dean winked at him.
She bared her teeth, and it bolted down the link like a fist, like a roaring storm. A riptide of hate.
At the fill-up, he guzzled water, cool and fresh and clean, then rattled around the back room until he found a dented metal bowl and poured the rest of the bottle into it for Prosper. He stared at his face in the mirror, and they both stared in fear and confusion at the raised welt of a handprint on his shoulder.
Lucifer seemed to be in a similar state. He made a moue of confusion and swung his finger through the air in a dragging motion, shifting it and his focus away from Sam and Dean. "Now, you
"You're confused," he said flatly to Dean's startled, blinking face. His breath was frustratingly hard to control; he had made too long a habit of breathing, and now had to forcibly still the push and pull motion of his lungs.
"Wow." Sam frowned as he mulled that bit of information over. "That's going to take some getting used to."
"Ah, Sam," Lucifer was saying, as Castiel and Dean joined him on the porch, "you don't have to be frightened of me. Yet." He smiled, shrugged sheepishly. "You know I'll always save you for last." Sam didn't answer, just shifted to the side so that Castiel could stand beside him. Castiel summoned his blade as he stepped slightly forward, arraying himself a few inches in front, and Dean, by some miracle, allowed it. Prosper didn't; she placed herself at his side, her head lowered, her fangs bared. Lucifer looked them over with open amusement. "You guys," he said affectionately. "You're so adorable. You just don't give up, even when you should. Even when it would be so stupid not to."
"What do you recall of your father?" Michael asked, dismissing the conversation around him. Jack's brow pinched, his head tilting in confusion. "Did he reach out to you, before your birth?" Michael clarified.
"Cas, it's me, we need you down here yesterday." He made a shoving motion at Prosper with his free hand, to get her to move herself and Temperance further toward the window, just in case Cas showed up in the car. "It's Sammy. Something's really fucking wrong with him, man, we need your help. And yeah, I know, you don't know, you're looking into it, but I've got a situation going on right now. New developments, and all that." He glanced at Prosper; she stared silently back, crouching over Temperance, prepared to guard her, or to snap her neck. Dean tried again. "Cas, come on. Kansas calling, come back on over the rainbow." He forced his hands steady on the wheel, forced the swelling panic down, glaring at Prosper when she whimpered. He ground his teeth and waited.
"Aren't we?" Illness was largely a matter of perspective, after all. By Castiel's estimation, having his thoughts and memories tampered with since the dawn of humanity, having been conditioned and trained to kill on command, to kill his dearest friend, having been deceived and used, having rebelled and played god and spewed monsters onto the earth and been cast down - surely any being who experienced all this and continued to live was suffering under a mental illness, even if it was simply the delusion that he had something more to give the world. "Look, there." He lifted a hand to point. "That's a payphone."
. She didn't say it, only came to stand beside him. Dean buried his hand in her scruff, his grip desperate and hard.
The fleeing dæmon was quick and nimble, some sort of cat by the smell of it, but it was impeded by its unwillingness to be too far apart from its ghoul. Prosper chased it in a frenetic, desperate circle, wearing it down and letting it grow more panicked as she herded it away from the direction it wanted to go. Finally it stumbled, yowling for its other half, and Prosper pounced, snapping down on its spine. She felt the vertebra crack and fold under the force of her jaw, felt the hot rush of blood fill her mouth in the moment before the dæmon turned to ash and Dust, and she was alive, she and Dean were each other and they were
If either of them meant to answer him, it was lost in the sudden gusting rise of the air around the barn, so strong that it set the corrugated roofing to clattering loudly against the beams. Dean and Bobby both jumped up, guns in hand, and Delia and Prosper came to stand shoulder to shoulder in front of them, tails lowered and hackles raised.
Sam stared at him for a long, silent moment, then stood up. Dean got hopeful for a second or too, thinking that was the end of it, but instead of turning for the door, Sam started pacing back and forth in front of Dean and Prosper. "Okay," he said, running his hands through his hair, "Let me just - let me just walk through this."
"'For until that moment it had seemed that they were at one with all the creatures of the earth and air, and there was no difference between them,'" Castiel said. It took Prosper a moment to realize that he was quoting something, and another moment to realize that it was a passage from Genesis.
And then Benny sliced the Leviathan's head off with one long, beautiful swing of his blade. Black blood spurted up in a thick, viscous arc, and the Leviathan's body tipped sideways and to the ground. Prosper skidded to a stop, Dean coming up beside her, watching as Benny offered Cas his hand.
"What?" Sam asked. He too appeared uncomfortable, twisting his long frame in his seat in order to look back at them. "Existence?"
The Colt was in here somewhere. Dean had an unfathomable obsession with firearms, and a tendency to attach sentimental value to his weapons. There was no doubt that the gun he had used to end Azazel, the gun that he and Sam had retrieved together under John Winchester's direction, would be kept close at hand.
"We got everything you need in here," Dean said, dropping the duffel to the floor and throwing it open. "And we're on a time crunch, Rowena, so let's save the hair pulling for after we've got Lucifer locked away, okay?"
"Then what's the deal? You look like you're about two seconds away from jumping out of your skin." He said it lightly, with his typical glib bravado, but Castiel caught the nervous current beneath his words.
"Sam!" Dean all but shouted. Sam finally shut up, dropping his hands (because he had started counting off on the other one too), and staring a challenge at Dean. "What the fuck is your point?"
"And how do you know that?" Presumably because Cas would recognize his own evil goddamn brother, but Dean wanted to hear it. He needed something, anything.
"You're in the back," he said, jabbing a finger at Meg. She shrugged insouciantly and walked to the door. Dean glared after her for a moment, then turned his attention to his dæmon and Emanuel, looking back and forth between them. He pointed at his dæmon. "You're up front with me."
"Yeah, uh. I should have called." No one did earnestly contrite quite like Sam. "I was pretty messed up."
"Keep it." She needed something solid, something more than memory. She used to bury her nose in John's old leather jacket, searching out that faint, final remnant of him; cheap scotch and engine oil, and, even more elusive, Clementine's warm, weary scent. Eventually, the jacket just came to smell like Dean.
It was unbearable. Dean wouldn't look at him, Prosper wouldn't speak. It was as if one of Castiel's wings had been ripped from his back, leaving him terribly unbalanced, hobbled and bound to the earth. Castiel knew, logically, that obtaining Dean's forgiveness would not truly balance the scales. Whether Dean allowed him in his home grudgingly or happily, nothing could alter the choices that Castiel had made. He apparently had a long history of making dire choices, although Naomi had twisted and ground those memories away. Castiel didn't know which he preferred, remembering or forgetting. Mistakes and failures were a heavy burden to carry forward into the gloam of the future. Yet he continued to grasp fruitlessly for those stolen memories, like a human tongue seeking an absent tooth.
" - Just shut up. Sammy, get the door." He didn't like how much Cas was having to lean against him as they went. He also didn't like how disconcertingly normal he felt, sagging warm and boneless against his side. It was dishonest, was what it was. Cas should feel like a plank of wood, or a stone plinth: he shouldn't feel human. "You ever hear of pacing yourself?" He said, once they were outside, helping Cas lean back against the motel's stained and faded siding.
"I guess," Framingham said, looking at Castiel like he was beginning to suspect him of being an alien invader. Which, really. Not that far off. Castiel's eyes slid sideways, toward Prosper. His face was the same as always, that strangely focused impassiveness, but Prosper could see, in the tenseness of his jaw and the faint tightening around his eyes, how acutely confused he was. She opened her mouth happily.
" - First off," Sam went on, ignoring him, "just to make sure I'm understanding, you think Cas is incapable of love?"
"I don't know." Sam was shaking, but he extended an arm down to Temperance so she could hop up and shuffle her way to her customary place on his shoulder.
, Dean thought as the plane tilted violently to the side, and the mask dropped down and hit him in the face.
"One way or another," he muttered in agreement, then lifted his chin in a nod as Sammy and Temperance approached. "They good?"
"I dunno," she answered. "Don't really feel like testing it right now either." And she moved in towards him, leaning momentarily against his leg as they walked.
Castiel took the call. "Dean. Yes, we found them. Where are you, I would rather talk in person. No, it's just that - " he looked around helplessly, " - I'm driving at the moment." He listened, nodded. "Okay. We'll be there soon." He ended the call, returning the phone to his pocket and his second hand to the wheel. "They'll meet us at the Biggerson's outside of town," he said to Constant.
old," Dean pointed out. "And I still don't get what any of this has to do with the three of you keeping me in the dark on shit, or how Sam somehow managed to leave heaven without breaking the - the balance of the universe or something."
"Ugh, who says that?" Dean groaned, pulling a face while his heart somersaulted in his chest. He licked his lips, scrubbed his free hand along the back of his neck. "But, uh. Yeah. You do that."
reciprocate. The world was ending already, while pile on the misery? So what could Dean even say, except,
"Okay," Enzo said nervously, darting in a zig-zagging pattern around Charlie's head, "I think some of us might be in need of a little sustenance. Get that blood sugar back up."
He opened his eyes, and saw Dean's back, the anxious knot of Dean's shoulders. He was facing away from Castiel; beyond him, Prosper was standing over Temperance's limp form, sniffing anxiously.
"I'll be with you," Constant said, with such confidence that Castiel almost believed him. "I suppose you will just have to listen very hard for me." He began making his way back up Castiel's arm. "We shouldn't delay any further. I'm sure Metatron and Caesura have been plotting against us since the moment we left them in the car."
"So, what, you just wished it into being?" He had asked Sam, standing in front of the low brick building that Sam had, apparently, created in the span of an hour. Behind the house, a huge pine forest stretched away as far as the eye could see. From where he stood, Dean could make out more than one narrow path winding through the trees, probably jogging trails, because even dead Sam was somehow still worried about his health. "Like a dream board?"
"Okay, you know what, screw the garrison. We need the tablet to end Dick Roman's 'soylent us' crap."
"So you'd come with me? To eat dinner?" Cas nodded. "And you'd actually eat?" Cas squinted, nodded again. "Okay, just checking. Didn't know how you felt about the food up here."
The car slowed as it passed her, then stopped completely, pulling to the side of the road and idling there. Prosper twitched her ears warily, preparing to dart away. The doors opened on either side; two figures stepped out, their heads turning as one to look back at the clump of weeds that she was crouched in. One of them lifted a hand in a small, stilted wave of greeting; the raven on his shoulder launched himself through the air toward her.
"Yes," Castiel answered. "About your dæmon." Michael's expression shuttered, which was remarkable, considering the fact that there had been nothing open about it to begin with. "Where is she?" Castiel asked.
"Big surprise," Dean said. "Well, they're useless, as usual, which," he gestured at Prosper and himself with his free hand, "coulda told you that and saved you some time, but hey. You're back home, that's what matters."
"Seriously?" He groused, settling with a groan into the wet grass beside her. "It's not like you can see them anyway."
"C'mon, we really gotta go through this again? If you'd stop running off every chance you get, maybe I could start showing you the way it's supposed to be."
He looked down, saw the books laying in torn disarray before him. Looked around, saw the shattered lights and the door that Metatron had fled through. He touched his hollow chest, his empty shoulder.
"You made the right call, Sammy. Besides, you never know. One of those things might end up making the difference someday. Might save his life, or someone else's life."
"What's she saying?" Dean asked, watching as Cas paused at the bottom of Nora It-Wasn't-Really-A-Date's porch. Prosper, already in the back seat and clearly eavesdropping, didn't answer him. The only thing Dean got was a bolt of unhappiness down the link. "We'll fix it," he muttered. "We're fixing it."
" - I'll deal with it," Cas cut in as he walked past him, spearing Dean with one brief, dark-eyed look.
"He can keep you," Dean said, taking a step back. Prosper stayed where she was, guarding the door, guarding Cas. "A little advice? Have him and Sammy lock you up sooner rather than later, 'cause this?" He pointed to the Mark. "It don't end with me."
"We do, yeah." Dean glanced at Prosper, as if for reassurance; she twitched her ears meaningfully in answer. He looked back at Cas. "You know, I kinda wanted to talk to you about that - "
"Next to Temper and Sammy, you're our favorite person to talk to," she said. She thought Cas might understand the significance of that at least. That he was family, and more than family.
Castiel's shoulders dropped. "Constant," he murmured softly. He stroked him again, a more assured touch beneath his bill. His other hand, the one holding the angel blade, fell to his side. "No," he said to his gathered angels. "I can't."
He and Sam got roaring drunk that night, sprawled out in Jack's room of all places, Sam on the bed and Dean with his legs kicked up on top of the nightstand. Sam told him for the first time about leaving the bunker after Dean had died, about how he never went back again. Dean didn't get it, but then, Sam had always been like that. He wasn't the type to cling on to something after the life had left it. He had always been able to let go.
"See, buddy, you're not getting it." He pushed again, leaning the full weight of his body against Castiel. "You see that bed right there behind you? I'm trying to get you on it."
"Folks, quick word from the flight deck." The pilot's voice was calm, light, like it was any other day, just any other flight. "We're just passing over Ilchester, then Ellicott City, on our initial descent into Baltimore. So if you'd like to stretch your legs, now would be a good time to - holy crap!"
Dean had only felt so stupid stunned once before in his life, and that one had been Cas' fault too. "Uh. You're welcome," he managed hoarsely.
Through the link, another bolt-bright shot of feeling, dissolving into weariness: Castiel's reaction to the torture they were subjecting him to. Constant allowed it to rock over him, against him, in hopes that he might somehow take a portion of the pain onto himself in Castiel's stead. It was the weariness that concerned him most. It was not the torture that might eventually end Castiel, but his growing exhaustion from being battered with the unending hate of his former brethren. With each blow they struck, each word they spoke to him, Castiel's grief grew.
"You know, you and Cas have always had this - " Sam made an open-palmed gesture, like he was holding something large and unwieldy, pushing it through the air toward Dean " -
"Yeah." He tried to stop himself from smiling, then wondered why the hell it mattered. It was just the two of them, she already knew everything. "It was a real good one."
, Dean thought, and the sickening wave of fury, of betrayal, that rose up in his stomach was enough to tear a low keening howl from Prosper's throat.
"Well, that did it," Crowley sighed. "Hell's blundering denizens now know precisely where we are and what we've done. I suggest we begin fleeing for our lives."
As Dean began steering them free of Detroit, Temperance left her customary place on Sam's knee, hopping onto the back of the seat, her great size requiring her to hunch her head and shoulders down into her keel.
"I gave the key to Dean," he said, staring down at the empty glass in his hands. "Gave him the Impala, and Dad's journal, and the demon knife." He shook his head. "I almost didn't give him any of it, other than the car. I didn't want him to feel like he had to be a hunter, or a legacy, or anything in between if he didn't want to, you know? But in the end, I guess it seemed like he'd be better off having the option."
"I'm gonna reach down your throat and rip out your lungs," she promised flatly. But Dean had heard it all before, from ghosts just before he dropped the lighter, from vamps paralyzed by dead man's blood. Right now, in this moment, she was powerless.
. Funny that she could feel anything from him; she had thought that all their ties were finally severed. Another perk of becoming a demon, the main perk in fact: finally being free of that stunted, stupid man.
"God has seen fit to end our loneliness," Viridius said. Daphne was crying, clear-eyed. She lifted her free hand and laid it against his chest.
"Why's that? Oh, Dad, please don't tell me you've bought into the lies these guys have been selling." Here he gestured toward the porch where Castiel was still standing with Sam and Dean. He pursed his lips, rolled his eyes theatrically. "The power of friendship! Family don't end in blood! It's just a bunch of noise they make to cover the fact that they have no idea what to do from one minute to the next."
Dean turned a frustrated, terribly weary glare on her. He glanced at his dæmon, then at Emanuel. "Excuse us," he said, turning away. Then, more sharply, "Meg."
"Hurry up," Dean snapped at Prosper, dropping Sam's head and shoulders down next to the car, a surge of something vicious rising up in him at the dull sound of his skull hitting against the pavement. "You got her or what?" Prosper couldn't answer, since she currently had a mouthful of gyrfalcon, hauling Temperance along by the thin skin of her inner wing, but Dean felt the snarl of her helpless fury through their link. He opened the back door and began the involved process of stuffing Sammy inside, one oversized limb at a time. "If I can move André the Giant by myself, you should be able to handle one damn bird," he managed to get out between breaths. He circled around to the other door so he could pull Sam in by his shoulders, looking up in time to watch Prosper scrabble her way into the front seat and drop Temperance in Sam's customary spot. One long white-speckled wing stretched out across the seat, and something in Dean threatened to break. "Move that," he said shortly, and nearly slammed the door on Sam's head.
Dean was half-convinced that they had sat side by side through separate plays by the time Cas told him to pull over. They got out and started walking, following a path through the trees. The snow had given way to a soft, misting sort of rain, the night had dialed backwards a bit and left them with the twilight. Dean wasn't cold, but he shoved his hands into the pockets of his jacket anyway, hugged his elbows in against his side. There was something depressing about this spot, something heavy and too-quiet, despite the sound of running water that seemed to surround them.
"Legacies," Castiel repeated, following Sam around another curving hallway. The lower halves of the walls were paved with pale brick, sigils carved into the hidden backs of each; every archway was lined internally with spell-worked iron, the properties of which, Castiel sensed, could be adjusted by a magical practitioner or scholar. Human ingenuity never failed to impress.
. If going out to watch a friend perform in local theater (Charlie, of course) had been a thing that Dean did back when he was alive, he wouldn't have thought twice about standing up and shouting, "Cas!" over the heads and low chatter of the waiting audience when he saw Cas walk in, waving off Sam and Kevin's whisper-hisses to lower his voice, or of throwing his arm over Cas' shoulders when he made his way to Dean's side while haranguing the entire aisle until they all shuffled down a seat so they could sit together. But he definitely wouldn't have kept his arm there for the rest of the night. Honestly, he hadn't even noticed until the play (which was
"The library," Cas rumbled. He bent down to retrieve Dean's empty bottles, returning them to the counter. "Lucifer is still at large."
"I'm not talking about Lucifer's vessel," Sam said, his words coming out in a rush of growing excitement. "I'm talking about the cage itself. Rowena," he said urgently, when she only stared at him with an arched, baffled look, "could you throw open the cage?"
He spread his palm flat against his own chest, searching in the human way, a more subtle awareness of his being, the unending physicality of earthly existence. He felt the contraction of his lungs, the beating of his heart. The cool prickle of night air against the exposed skin of his neck. He listened intently, as Constant had told him he should.
"Okay, so." Dean clapped his hands together. "Let's brass tacks this. I was feeling bored - " Jack's mouth opened, and Dean hastened to speak over him " - or
"Make it quick," Dean ordered. Cas nodded, his gaze steady on Dean as Michael lifted a hand to his shoulder, and in the next instant they were gone.
Cas snorted, a slow smile pulling at the edge of his mouth. "I very often am," he said gravely, after a long moment.
"Dean." It was an invasion, but they had no time. Castiel touched his temple, connecting directly with his thoughts. He pushed his way through terror, through love, through years and memories, until he found the moment, until they were both there again, on the precipice of trust and choice.
. Dean snatched the towel from Jack, drying his hands as he paced around the kitchen. He could see how it made sense, from a certain, stupid standpoint, to want to have someone with separate loyalties. Someone to balance the power out. But Naomi was ruthless. Naomi had hurt Cas, more than Dean suspected Cas would ever admit. So what more was there to think about? "That's three," he said, coming to stand back in front of Jack, his chest turning leaden, his stomach roiling with nerves and disappointment and love, "and now you got four." He huffed when Jack just stared at him, all puzzled concern. "Me, Jack. I'll be your fourth not-archangel."
," he said mockingly, standing too as he holstered his gun. "Is that even a thing you should be doing? I mean, isn't that the whole point of drinking the kool-aid? Not having to think for yourself anymore?"
"What if - " Prosper said, and then stopped, her tail twitching uncertainly along the worn bedsheets. Dean stopped too. "I could just come back with you," she said, hesitantly, like she actually thought Dean might say something other than
"Let's not waste time. It's a finite resource for certain members of the group. Not you and me, of course." With that, he turned and scampered with liquid ease up along the roof of the car and out of sight.
They drove through the night, pulling over some time before dawn so that Dean could 'snatch a couple of hours.' He leaned back in his seat, folding his arms across his chest and muttering to Emanuel to stay put, then dropped off to sleep so swiftly and completely that Emanuel was almost startled. His dæmon lay in the back seat; her eyes were closed but she was awake and on her guard. Emanuel sat in his seat and watched the sun rise up out of the road ahead them.
Infuriating. Dean was impossibly infuriating, and Castiel had nothing to give in his own defense beyond what he had already tried to explain to them. He clenched his jaw and didn't answer, and after a moment Dean huffed and returned to his work.
That was how he ended up elbows deep in sudsy water, Jack at his side with a towel at the ready. Sam and Cas were sitting side by side at the table behind them.
"Shut up," Meg snapped at her, then, "No, no, Cas." Back to speaking so saccharinely sweet that Dean could fucking gag. "You talk. Perth?"
When an angel took a vessel (as if putting a fancy word on it made it something other than possession), there was nothing struggling underneath, not from what Prosper had seen. The dæmons were empty shells, no better than souped-up zombies. The angels weren't aware of them at all, outside of their use in battle. There was no trusting something like that. Prosper would sooner trust a twister.
She smelled Evangeline and Benny first, then Dean. She couldn't catch Cas' scent, but then, his smell had always been subtle, impossible to pick up unless you were standing close. Soon after scenting them, she began to pick up the sound of their movement, the soft suck of the earth as it pulled at their feet, Dean's muttering voice, Benny's drawl. But she couldn't hear Cas. Prosper broke into a trot, suddenly impossibly impatient to see him.
He, too, had been watching the reunion, for what else could this first meeting be called, other than a reunion? His face was open, unguarded, still impossible to interpret. His lips were moving soundlessly. His focus shifted, as if he could feel the touch of Castiel's gaze; he looked down at Castiel with a hardening expression, summer-green eyes.
"Yeah, well, how 'bout we start with a little backstory here." Ash pulled the laptop closer but didn't make any further move to start searching. "Hate to be that guy, but if there's somebody up here you can't find, it's 'cause they don't wanna see you, you know?"
Castiel could feel Constant's deepening pleasure along their link. "Precisely," Constant answered. "We are two aspects of the same being, but Castiel and I have separate perspectives, and even at times separate desires." Castiel grimaced, acutely aware that this was Constant's way of quietly gloating over his gross missteps with April.
. Bullshit. If this was faith, calling and believing and having absolutely nothing answer back, then faith and prayer and Castiel fucking angel-of-the-absent-Lord could go fuck themselves straight down to -
Cas didn't pay any attention to his tone. "Know about what?" He asked, scarcely sparing Dean an upwards glance as he flipped through the channels. He had taken his coat off, which wasn't new, but Dean was surprised to see that his shoes were off as well, set tidily along the railing, the shoelaces tucked away into the shoes. He snuck a peek at Cas' socks as he came down the stairs, paced around the couch as he ranted.
"Heaven is alive," Jack answered simply. "I exist, you exist - " he gestured past Dean's shoulder, " - these trees and this sky exist. Why wouldn't the mole also exist?"
She wanted to, she couldn't hide it from him. It was in every line of her body, and inside his chest; the call to move, to keep moving. To run. Prosper circled him once, twice, then bounded away. Her feet scarcely seemed to touch the ground; she only belonged halfway to earth and to Dean, the rest of her was in the air. Dean braced himself for the ripping pain as she neared the twenty to thirty foot mark that had always been their limit before, but she flew past that invisible barrier and kept moving. She could go on forever, beyond the capability of his senses, except that he would still feel her in that space inside him. It was terrifying; it almost felt like being free. Dean watched her grow small, a pinpoint of moving color.
It only lasted for a moment longer, then Dean stood up and went back into the house, still holding the trench coat.
"I'm here to assess the threat the nephilim poses the earth and my people," Michael answered assuredly, looking past Castiel to where Jack stood with Juniper in his arms. "It has a dæmon," he remarked tonelessly.
"Oh," Ash said, looking up from behind the bar counter where he was pouring drinks for a couple of hunters that Dean didn't recognize. They were dressed like goddamn Davy Crockett, so it was a pretty safe bet that they were from before Dean's time. "Hey, Dean. What's shakin', bacon?"
"I suppose you wouldn't know," Michael answered. "You were a foot soldier, after all. Even I was rarely allowed." He raised a hand, gesturing at the breathing, quickening world.  "Look around you, Castiel. Where do you think we are?"
"Dean." He listened to him approach, his boots crunching against the mix of leaves and loose stone that seemed to inevitably collect outside the bunker's entrance. Dean came to stand beside him, glancing suspiciously between Castiel and the Impala, as if Castiel might transmit his weaknesses to her through proximity. Castiel slipped his hands into his pockets and turned to face him.
"C'mon, no he's not." Cas wouldn't throw them to a fucking vampire for one thing, wouldn't stand there and watch while...fuck, he needed another drink. "He's gonna make, you know. Angel inquiries."
frightened, but then again, he had very little past experience to compare his current emotions against. "I'm taking comfort in the thought that I must be doing something right, to have caught their interest."
Back when they had been alive, Dean had gradually formed a weird suspicion about Cas. He did a little research one day, comparing the handful of pictures that he had of Cas from over the years, lining them up chronologically and studying his face. It didn't take very long to verify that yeah, Cas was definitely looking older. Dean didn't really know what to make of it, but it was obvious that Cas, for whatever reason, had been allowing his vessel to age. Since arriving in heaven, he had wondered (when he let himself think about it at all) what version of Cas he was going to see in front of him when they met again. Would it be Angel of the Lord Castiel, with the wild hair and the too-intense staring and the unlined face? Would it be post-Purgatory Cas, still just as young-looking but with something heavy starting to gather around his eyes and shoulders? Or would it be the Cas that Dean secretly thought of as his Cas, the Cas that stuck around, the Cas that Cas had grown into as they slowly fought their way clear of all the bullshit, the lies they had told each other, the walls they had thrown up.
"...Not mine per se, but it'll do," Castiel was saying as Constant landed. His eyes flickered toward him, then away. He listened, smiling faintly in response to something Dean said. "I'm not sure. But I am an angel." Now he did look at Constant, the lines around his eyes tightening as he listened to Dean speak. Constant could just make him out, his voice reduced to a low, muffled vibration. "No, he's still here. We're." He grimaced and turned his gaze forward again. "We're both okay." Another pause, then, "If we're going to war, I need to be ready."
The dæmon answered. "Paola," she said, twisting in definitely-not-Castiel's arms to regard them. "I'm Paola, and this is Jimmy."
"Okay." They started out across the yard, stepping over the tunnels of torn earth. "Would you like me to get rid of the mole?" Jack asked.
"So what were you doing around here if you weren't digging me out of my grave?" He asked later, after hot-panty-chick had left, her mink dæmon scampering ahead of her while she lingered in the doorway with Sam. Temperance, tellingly, had stuck to the other side of the room, rubbing her beak against Prosper's head. Now she was back on Sam's shoulder, her talons flexing minutely as she adjusted her grip in response to his movements. Prosper was prowling the space between Sam and Bobby, avoiding Dean. Their theory that Sam and Temperance had been the ones responsible for their release from the pit had been shot to shit, and Dean was having to admit to himself that he had no fucking idea what the hell was going on.
"Yeah, why not?" He straightened, to show he meant it, and walked to stand in the middle of the row. "Go on, I wanna see."
"Thank you," Castiel said, nearly choking on his gratitude. He had tried, but he knew he had been of little comfort to Kelly in her labor. He moved aside, and Mary squeezed his arm gently as she and Gallant passed him by. He came to stand beside Prosper, relieved by her closeness, the instant forgiveness she had granted him as soon as she and Dean had appeared in the doorway. He would touch her, if they were alone and Dean were willing to look at him. "Any updates?" He asked finally, as the uncomfortable quiet stretched on.
Jack took his time answering, wiping the plate down in careful circles with the corner of his towel, starting at the center and working his way outward. "Aunt Amara and I have talked about it," he finally said, "and we both believe that my grandfather hadn't always been the way he was at the end."
"Guess not," he said, hating her; she lowered her head and didn't reply. Dean gave it a moment, then, "Hey." She swiveled an ear toward him. "Do you think we can, you know." He gestured between them, spread his hands out wide. "Like Sammy and Temper could after they came back?"
"Sure, but on the other hand, you kinda are. I mean, a month ago you didn't even have, I don't know," he threw his hands up, "self-awareness. Or whatever it was you and Temper were talking about. That sounds like a baby to me." He craned his neck to the side so that they could look at each other. Constant didn't speak, just stared at him, his eyes blinking in silver flashes, like a coin catching and throwing light. "Talk to me," Dean said, caught in his winking dark-bright gaze. Constant hesitated, his talons digging in, prickling through the thick fabric of Dean's jacket and the two shirts beneath. It made Dean's stomach tighten with nerves. "C'mon, man," he said, forcing himself to look away. He grabbed a six pack of El Sol and tucked it under his arm. "What do you think Cas and Prosper are doing right now? She tells him freaking everything, the blabbermouth. So," he raised a hand and gestured impatiently between them, "you and me, let's go. Hit me with it."
"Dean will almost certainly give you a nickname," he said. Constant ruffled his feathers, pleased. "Con, perhaps."
Was this what it felt like to want someone else, here in the afterlife? Physical sensation was more of a pick and choose kind of deal now that Dean was dead, just something to keep around out of habit. It was all reduced, or amplified maybe, emblematic instead of biologic. A symbol of intent, like Cas kept saying. Because honestly, if this was desire, it didn't seem much different from what Dean had felt when he had been alive. That same coil of feeling, that same sharp climb of awareness. It sure as fuck didn't feel very heavenly of him.
Prosper's ears swiveled, tracking Sam and Temperance while she looked at Dean, a sign of discomfort. "I don't know what to say to him."
"So, is that why - " Dean cut himself off, tried again. "You know, I haven't been able to find some people, and I figured it was just 'cause they didn't want to see me,  but - " and then his throat closed up and he had to swallow hard before continuing. "I mean. I've been looking for them, but I can't find Ellen and Jo."
Cas straightened in his seat, the chain dragging along the floor. "Sam, Temperance. Can Prosper and I have a moment?" They both stared at him, and Cas made an exaggerated motion with his head toward the door that Dean had disappeared through. "Alone?"
"Is this necessary?" Connie replied, bitchily and so like Cas that it made Dean want to smirk and roll his eyes all at once.
"It doesn't make you," Cas paused, his eyes rising back up to catch Dean's, holding them in that way he had, so dark and searching that Dean always found himself staring back, trying to root out what Cas was looking for. A feedback loop of seeking. "Uncomfortable?" Cas finished eventually, after so long a silence that Dean had nearly lost track of what they had been talking about.
"And don't worry about the whole," Dean waved a hand in Castiel's general vicinity as they crossed the street, "no dæmon thing. Most people will probably assume you got it tucked away in one of your pockets. Anyway, it happens sometimes, it's not that weird."
Michael stood there, slivered by the bars of the cage. Emotionless as always, his arms at his side. He was staring, but Dean wasn't sure at what.
There was an old bus that sat at the edge of the salvage yard. It had been there for as long as Prosper could remember, had been a favorite spot of theirs back when they were kids. Prosper found Temperance there, perched on its bent roof. She joined her, making her way through the permanently open door, up into the driver's seat, then through the busted window and onto the hood. "Trust you to find the best seat in the house," she said, settling in and looking out across the yard. The morning was rising up fresh and new around them, and here she and Temper sat like two harbingers of doom.
After all, someone had to hang back to watch the way they had come. They had been crossing paths with an increasing number of monsters the closer they got to Cas, which made Benny grumble and Evangeline fret. They couldn't afford to let their guard down, not when they were this close, and so while Dean and Benny followed the path down to the water, Evangeline and Prosper split up, Evangeline circling through the trees to scout the way forward while Prosper stayed behind to make sure they hadn't been followed.
"Look, wherever they took him, it's out of our reach. I mean, heaven? About as far away as it gets. Tessa's the only one we know who has a shot at reaching him, but I don't think even a reaper can swing that. Maybe Anna?"
"Alright," he said, narrowing his eyes at Sam. "I'll...go." Sam nodded some more, and Castiel turned away, bewildered. The subtleties of human communication still quite often escaped him.
"No," Cas answered. "We can go to the party if you want to. But I have several questions about Charlie's play."
"Jack!" Dean shouted. Jack jumped, his eyes dropping down. "That's not the point! Now, just listen to me for a second and - "
"Over here," Prosper called. Dean spun around, following her voice. The flashlight caught the glow of Prosper's eyes first, then the white of Castiel's shirt where she was standing over him.
"Well, try one and see what you think," Dean said, reaching into the bag and holding a wrapped burger out to Jack. "Even Cas eats burgers every once in a while."
"I'm sorry for your loss," Michael said, alarmingly sincere. "If he is truly lost." He looked away, up toward the sky, the vast promises of the universe. "I can take you where I went," he said eventually. "But any choices you make there will be your own." Castiel didn't answer, his grace lurching drunkenly within his chest, the world too quiet for the sudden clamor of need coming from within. Michael looked at him when he gave no reply, frowning impatiently. "I have little time, Castiel. Come with me now, or find your own way."
"Heard you got your mojo back," she said. Her gaze flickered briefly around the room before returning to him.
He really got into mowing the lawn, for a while there. When the weather was just right (which, no surprise, it was most of the time), just the other side of too hot, there wasn't anything more satisfying than going to the shed that he didn't remember building, pulling out the push mower, and firing the sweet little thing up. In all honesty, he just liked being able to move with some purpose, liked patrolling every inch of the little corner of heaven that he had staked for himself. He liked it so much, he ended up mowing just about every day, which Sam apparently found interesting enough to grill him over.
Dean, no matter how they fought. She had only tried to speak to him once, to ask where her future self was. He had ignored her, and told Dean flatly to fuck off when he repeated the question.
The lioness on his back, snarling as her teeth sought purchase in flesh. She was large, easily matching Lucifer's vessel in both size and weight. Her fur rippled with the heavy musculature beneath; she was instinct and merciless intent, life in all its terrible glory.
"Yeah, pretty much," Sam said. He looked across the table, at where Cas was sitting, wrapped in a blanket and chained to the ground. "Cas, you gonna be okay until we get back?"
"Yes," Cas answered. His hands were shaking. Prosper, already sitting at his side, edged closer, propping her head against the arm rest. She had never seen Cas like this before.
"It's typically pretentious of Metatron, to name them after a poetical function," Castiel opined as they returned to the car.
"Bye, Cas," Prosper said, brushing against his leg as she trailed after Dean. Constant waited until they had gone, then pressed his head against Castiel's temple.
Behind her, Alastair made a new sound, a wet, frantic gurgling. Prosper still couldn't hear Dean. In front of her, Anna moved closer to Castiel, her expression urgent. Castiel, if anything about him could be trusted, was looking away from her with something like concern, maybe even guilt. Anna touched his hand; Castiel stared down at their point of contact, his brow pinching with confusion. Prosper tracked his expression for each subtle change; they all took place around his eyes. Anna's grip on his hand tightened.
"A-fucking-men." As quickly as it had appeared, the bright mood left them, dropping away as they thought, like they always did, of Temperance and Sam.
"Yes, and that as well," Constant said, rousing affectionately. Castiel touched the top of his head, the long feathers of his throat. Constant spread his wings and Castiel touched those too, marveling at their color, their intricate fineness.
And there had been that one night, back when the world was ending for the first time (or hell, maybe it had been the second time around, Dean couldn't keep track of the number of times the world had teetered on the brink of collapse these past couple of years), when they had been driving to Detroit to deliver Sammy to Lucifer like a wrapped package, when the situation couldn't have been more grim or the stakes less high. But Sam and Temperance had been in the seat across from him, right where they belonged, and Dean had glanced over his shoulder to where Prosper was sitting beside a sleeping Castiel. And Dean had thought at the time that if they somehow managed to pull this off, if they all somehow came out the other side alive, then this right here might actually be the ideal number of people for a car to hold.
"Okay, Oprah, thanks for the heart to heart," Dean said with all the flippancy he could force into his voice, shrugging Cas' hand off. Cas looked at Prosper, smiled hesitantly, stomach-lurchingly heartfelt. He looked back at Dean.
"Both," Cas answered without hesitation. "The two aren't as far apart as you think they are, Dean." And that - that couldn't be true, but there Cas went again, saying things that made Dean's chest feel overstuffed, things that left him just standing there like an idiot. And how had that ended up for him the last time? He had stood there, and Cas had smiled, and died for him.
"Bobby, how many times do I have to prove I'm me?" He kicked his foot out to stop Prosper as she tried to move past him. "Would you quit? You're freaking everybody out." She didn't answer, but she settled unhappily between his and Sam's legs. Sam was contemplating the lip of his beer with a studied nonchalance, but Dean knew without looking that everyone else was watching him now, like he was some sort of ticking demonic time bomb. "We're both fine," Dean said to Bobby, and drank his beer.
It's a relatively short drive, 400 miles, seven hours give or take. They stop for gas once and for toilets three times, the third time requested by Castiel, who isn't used to road trips as a human just yet.
Dean continues to look at Cas, who doesn't seem to either notice or think it important enough to comment on, which is good because Dean doesn't ever want to stop looking. He doesn't even know why. He just likes the way Cas' lips silently repeat some of the more confusing dialog, or the way the bad jokes tug on the corner of Cas' mouth, or the way his eyes seem to droop more and more as the movie progresses. He looks at the wrinkles at his eyes and feels warm inside, wondering if they've always been there or if Cas has been a human long enough to age, and he looks at the mess of Cas' hair, thinks about how badly he wants to run his fingers through it to mess it up even more, make it look wild like when they first met in that barn when sparks were flying all around them.
He's not sure why he did it. Maybe he really is going crazy.  Maybe he just wants Cas to be comfortable. Maybe— Maybe it's because—
Cas swallows heavily and sets the dry spoon aside. His fingers curl into the towel on the counter as he turns towards Dean. He thinks maybe he can actually do it now, confess, if he doesn't think about it too much, doesn't let the fear inside him rise. But he doesn't find the words fast enough, and all that stumbles out is "I-, you-, I can't-, I don't
Dean grabs the first decoration he can get his fingers on (a blue and silver icicle) and hangs it on the tree, leaving a generous amount of space between it and Sam's bulb. Cas' eyes follow Dean, then he goes to grab another piece of decoration. This time he puts it on the opposite side of the tree and looks at Sam for approval. Sam nods with a smile.
so much more, so much more distinct," he says. "The sunshine, the flowers, the bees, this tree," he gives the branch a gentle pat, "even myself." He turns to face Dean again. "And you."
Dean returns the favor whenever Cas is fed up with Sam's attempts at teaching Cas anything above basic first-aid. Dean gets it, reassures Cas, praises him, tells him that everyone would feel a bit woozy at the sight of this much blood, catches Cas when he faints, moves strands of hair on Cas' sweaty forehead, and taps his cheek's lovingly to get him conscious afterwards.
Dean sighs, breath visible in the cold air. He has his hand buried in his coat pockets and stares at his shoes awkwardly. Cas is beside him, not moving.
Dean sighs. "There's something you need to know," he pushes out. It sounds more serious than he planned.
The movie ends, obviously, with a cheesy kiss between the leads, and Sam finds himself looking over at the couch to see what Dean and Castiel are up to. They're still under the blanket, but Cas has moved closer to Dean, his eyes shut, breathing deeply, his head resting on Dean's shoulder. Dean's arm is wrapped around Cas, and his eyes are closed too, but there's a smile on his face, and Sam feels his heart fill with adoration at the sight of it.
"Tell Sam about this and you won't ever have to worry about your back again, got it?" Dean says from om top of Cas, but his voice is soft. He lifts Cas' arms from his sides and places them further up, next to Cas' head.
He can swear he can feel their presence next to him. Knows which space they occupy, what their faces look like in the dimness.
After the burgers are eaten, the three men return to the living room. Sam's carrying two bottles of cinnamon beer ("Disgusting," Dean comments). Dean took the eggnog from the kitchen for himself and offers Cas some of it. Having never tried it, Cas is very excited to taste it. The line of eggnog on Cas' upper lip after taking a sip definitely
The start of the plan goes quite smoothly. Dean doesn't find a case for them, maybe hasn't even been looking, and Sam prepares a two-course menu: tomato soup with little cubes of stale bread (they have to get rid of it somehow), and an Asian dish he forgot the name of as soon as his eyes left the cookbook. They all dig in happily, and when their plates are empty Sam stacks them up and thrusts them into Dean's hands.
Sam opens the other package, stares at it for a second, then gapes at Dean, who's grinning at him in response.
Cas feels hopeful at that, but the thought of confronting Dean quickens his pulse. It's still too difficult, too daunting.
"Good Morning, Sam," Cas says, scratching the empty table he is sitting at, apparently lost in thought.
Cas hesitates for a moment before opening the bow and ripping off the newspaper. Sam's present turns out to be a bathroom set for men: hairbrush, razor, shampoo, and everything. Cas thanks Sam warmly, and promises not to borrow Sam's stuff anymore. Sam grins at him, and Cas grins back. He smells the shampoo, nods approvingly, then sets it aside and says, "Here is my present for you." He takes the gift bag from under the tree and gives it to Sam. Inside is an old, lavish-looking book written in Latin, and Dean zones out as Sam geeks about how happy he is to finally own it. Sam hugs Cas, which tugs at Dean's heartstrings, so he stands up and announces "My turn."
The lyrics continue, and Dean lets himself enjoy the moment without shame. They are home, they're about to do a simple salt-n-burn just one state over, and then they'll be back here, Sam and Cas and him, and they'll celebrate Christmas. For realsies. Dean can't wait.
Dean's heart breaks from guilt, and he takes a step closer to the tree and reaches up towards where Cas is sitting. He tests if the branch will hold his weight, and it seems more than sturdy enough, so he grabs it hard with both his hands and launches himself up, pulling his legs up behind him, and then one of them over the branch to straddle it. He's facing Cas, who has quietly regarded him throughout the whole thing.
Sam smiles at him. "Yeah, it takes some people a lifetime to learn." He grabs the knife and washes the kiwi bits off it. "Anything in particular on your mind?"
he walks towards the table. Sam is still staring incredulously, and Dean looks at his brother too, face mock-serious. Cas, who's next to Sam, stares too, eyes wide, slight puzzlement edged into his features.
"Dean," Cas says, "Despite what you may believe: I am not crazy. I just... I know now. What I've felt for humanity, for Earth, and for you, this whole time...."
"Dean, your brother is right, you mustn't worry about me so much. The tingles are already subsiding," Cas agrees.
