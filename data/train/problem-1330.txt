John came in the door, then, jarring Sherlock.  That's another new development, Sherlock observed. John's absence and reappearance were something that usually went by Sherlock unnoticed. But ever since that night, John's absence was accutely felt and his reappearance brought a sense of relief. That was a fact that did not go unnoticed. John's whereabouts were at the forefront of Sherlock's mind, where James Moriarty ought to be instead. "I got the butter you like, even though I find it quite repulsive," John said, setting the shopping on the floor of the kitchen because the counters were full with Sherlock's experiments. "I also got you some nicotine patches. You were doing so well, why'd you take up the smoking again?" Thoughtful, Sherlock thought. I'll add that to my considerations concerning John. No. This had to stop. He had to get his mind off John. And when you're a genius who makes deductions constantly and find it impossible to stop, there is only one way to clear your mind. Without a word to John, Sherlock grabbed his coat and headed out the door.
"How?" Sherlock whispered, not leaving his spot on his neck. "I... I want you. Inside me. I want us to lose our virginity, fully, to eachother." "You're not a virgin, John." Sherlock wasn't sure if he was technically a virgin now either. Technically, he'd never stuck his cock in anything so he guessed he was. "I am there," John said. And he meant it. He wanted Sherlock's first time penetrating someone to be his first time being penetrated. He was ready.
The next morning, John awoke with a start. Had last night really happened? He felt as though it had to be a dream, but when he took a sip from the glass of water on his bedside table, he realized his lips were still a little sensitive and swollen in a way only a night of snogging could induce. He climbed out of bed and crept toward the door, listening for signs that Sherlock had woken. He was worried that today might be awkward. Maybe last night's snog only happened because of Sherlock's nightmare. Maybe, in the light of day, it will all seem absurd. Upon hearing nothing downstairs, John eased the door open and crept down to the kitchen to make a cuppa. What he saw there sent him reeling.
John stomped down the stairs and out the front door of 221. He knew this was ridiculous. It's just sex! He's had loads of sex in his life, it cant be that complicated to switch up the anatomy. If he were being totally honest with himself, something he almost never was, he knew exactly how to have sex with a man. It was anal. He'd done that. But he didn't know how to go about taking Sherlock's virginity. Sherlock wasn't like other people. One wrong move could send him spiraling into a heroin induced coma, or he could simply not enjoy it and decide to never touch John again. How would that end? Could they ever go back to just being flatmates? Obviously not. He'd absolutely love it if he and Sherlock could just snog eachother to death every day. They were very good at it. But they kept getting turned on. When John was young, and the girls he was with were the same, he had plenty of snoggings that never went anywhere. As he's gotten older, he's acutely aware that if you're gonna shag someone, it usually happens in the first two weeks. As much as he tells Sherlock they should take it slowly, sex was inevitable. They already decided they were in love.
"Sherlock...I..." John cleared his throat and tried again. "I want to completely eliminate talk of sex before its proper time, but in order to do that, I need to know: why were you so repulsed by what you watched this morning?" Sherlock blinked. He thought that conversation was over. But he thought he understood why John was asking. "I thought sex was supposed to be about love." "It is." "But those men did not love eachother. They degraded eachother. The common theme in every video I watched was degredation, and pain." "Pain?" "Yes. Pain in the title, in the descriptions. In the dialogue. They all seemed to be in pain and they enjoyed it. They said filthy things to eachother. There was no evidence of love in any of it. It was sweaty and loud and repulsive. The camera shots and the zooms. It was all incredibly degrading. If that is what sex is, I have to wonder why people enjoy it so." John was a bit taken aback. This is why he didn't want Sherlock watching porn to learn what was expected of him. Because John did not expect him to be a porn star. And he certainly hoped nobody expected that of him because he was not. John liked to make love. Yes, ofcoarse, he could get a little wild. Drunk sex, angry sex, wild passionate first time meeting someone in a bar sex. He'd had it all. But Sherlock was right, what people did in porn had nothing to do with love. "Sherlock, it won't be that way with us. It isn't like that for most people. Those videos....they're made with wanking in mind. The angles, the zooms...they're not realistic. And no, those people are not in love. They are actors, getting paid. Most of the time they meet five minutes before stuffing their cocks in eachother's mouths. That's why they're so degrading to eachother. Because they are degraded. And because people...some people...like that. The viewers, that is. It helps get them off."
enter.”
Being momentarily halted by Sherlock’s words he almost didn’t notice the detective reach out a hand towards his face. The blush that had started as a low cinder had ignited and he could feel it burning all the way down his neck and even up to his ears. John watched him with anticipation as his hand came closer and closer, but missed his face entirely. Instead he felt the brush of Sherlock’s fingers on the nape of his neck and tugging on his coat.
“How’s the tomato juice?”
“Well I’m not going to lie it’s a fucking nightmare here,” Lestrade started. “Katherine Carmichael, a patient only 17, was found in a field about a kilometer down the road. In pieces, mind you. Definitely not for the faint of heart. She was getting treatment here at Brightwell Hospital. It’s a mental institution. She was reported missing last week and then found earlier this evening by a jogger. We have a doctor in custody right now. He has a hobby of collecting old surgical tools and one of his was missing from his office.”
?” Holmes’s eyes widened with the nonsense that was now pouring out of his companion’s mouth.
This time Sherlock’s full focus was now on him. His eyes didn’t take a quick gloss over his figure. Instead made it more of a study. From the very top of his head down to his shoes, his gaze roamed, pausing here and there to look at certain things with interest.
“Since the moment of conception? How breathtakingly prescient of her! It is
“Of course, where are my manners? My name is Sherlock Holmes and you are currently at 221B Baker St. And as for what I want that is simple. I am in need of a flatmate and you will do perfectly.”
A woman had a pole through her. Impaled diagonally from hip to hip. No doubt puncturing through her internal organs. It would be a fucking miracle if it didn’t hit her spinal column. She was rushed to surgery.
him with credible information?”
“I’ve seen worse.” John admitted. “What happened? Why did you attack that man?”
The detective stilled and raised his head toward Lestrade.
He made sure to catalog exactly where they were going and which hallways they maneuvered so he wouldn’t have to ask a second time. Let alone get caught or bump into unwanted company along the way. They entered a laboratory that was thankfully vacant at the moment and she guided him to where the blood was stored.
"Because he's a psychopath. And psychopaths get bored."
"You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb." His voice hinted in skepticism.
“Here take mine.” John slid it across the table to her. “It’s still cold. Put it on the back of your neck. It’ll feel good.”
“Living as long as I have things become too outdated that it no longer pertains to this day in age. And as time moves on things are changing more at a rapid pace. I hate to admit it but there are times where I have trouble keeping up. So in order to do so I have swept away old knowledge, deleted useless material, and tossed out antiques I doubt I will ever use again. Though there are certain memories I have preserved for the sake of sentiment alone. They are my tethered shadows to the past.”
"Come on I got you some coffee. You have a big day ahead of you."
“Why do I get the feeling that won’t make a difference? Mrs. Hudson says you get all sorts. Besides this has to be the craziest thing I’ve done in a while.”
John’s pager went off shaking him out of his thoughts. So much for a lunch break. Duty called. He reached down, plucked off the pager from the waist band of his scrub pants and read the message. The coded words brought a thrum of excitement to him though at the same time dread as well.
“Just because I can’t smell blood unless it has been spilt doesn’t mean I don’t crave it constantly. How long can you go without eating before you become truly hungry to the point of starvation? A couple days? So what do you do? You eat to stave off the pains of hunger. That is one of my many reasons for the bagged blood.”
John blinked. Then blinked again. Had he heard him right? Surely not. He must’ve been imagining the words that had just come out of Sherlock’s mouth.
With that Watson got out, leaving the detective to watch him from behind the glass of the window of the cab as he went inside. Perhaps in another time, in another place, things would be different. As for now, their love could only be kindled in secret. And as such it would have to remain.
"A bloody army doctor. Well, I can't blame them. Sticking to the truth as much as possible is smart in case of kidnapping or death. Hopefully I don't need a full back story."
"Say that again." Sherlock requested.
“Your guess is as good as mine.”
“I see. No doubt your curiosity comes from recent events. And rightly so. Perhaps I should have disclosed certain qualities of mine when you first moved in.” Sherlock turned off his blow torch.
Mrs. Hudson pursed her lips and dropped her bubbly face.
“Oh…uh, good morning.” John’s eyes flitted to the open drapes that was letting in full scales of light into the room and back to Sherlock. Apart from his shocking metamorphosis John was wondering how he wasn’t bursting into flames. Obviously he had a lot to learn about what was fiction and what was real regarding the detective’s unique lifestyle.
“Might be. Depends how far I can get.”
“What is it?” Molly stilled her fanning and looked over at John.
He scoured the room like a hunter in search for prey, but becoming frustrated when he was coming up empty handed. If John didn’t know any better he would’ve said that this Felisian was more of a blood hound than feline. It was the dogs who usually sniffed out and hunted down the thing they were looking for. Cats on the other hand were the wait-it-out and attack type. Sherlock seemed to not have any time for patience as his prowl continued around the flat, looking in every nook and cranny.
John thought to himself as he got in the car reluctantly.
As they entered, John's legs were frozen to the floor he was standing on, unable to move as his heart thundered furiously in his chest. He had seen countless dead bodies before, but none prepared him for the one in front of him. Prostrate on the ground with her head turned sideways to the floor was, in his book, the most vile woman he had ever known. Her sickening pink outfit made him nearly want to vomit then and there. He remembered her cruelty not only as a teacher and headmistress, but in the ministry of magic as well with her outrageous prejudice ideas about muggle borns when she herself was only a half blood. She had ruined countless lives and tried the innocent all in the vision for Lord Voldemort.
“I don’t know. And I don’t like not knowing.”
“White as death...mouth like a crimson wound.”
“Whatever happened in Limehouse last night, I think we can safely assume it wasn’t the work of a dead woman.” said Holmes.
"Friend of mine. When I say 'friend' ..." Sherlock slid off his coat and scarf and put them on a nearby chair letting his words fall on empty meanings. John was starting to get a second impression of the muggle at hand, almost a different nature. No longer was he the arrogant prat he had met yesterday, but rather boyish and awkward, fumbling in his conversation. Almost as if he really didn't know how to talk to people or perhaps his only friend was the quiet skull on the mantle piece. He looked too innocent.
“Well, my therapist did say I should get a hobby. Get out of the house more,’’ He nodded in agreement. “Alright. Next time.”
“No dates back to the flat and don’t tell anyone your a vampire. Actually those aren’t too hard to think of.”
"Soon as all this rubbish gets cleaned out ... Oh." John's words had train wrecked against Sherlock's until he realized what he was saying. "So this is all ..."His words trailed off, hoping he hadn't offended him.
At this moment John fished out his phone that was given him by Arthur. He was going to conduct an experiment just to see how good this detective truly was. Could it be possible for him to crack a magically modified phone or would he be stumped? He wanted to know exactly what he was dealing with and plan accordingly. With a touch of a button he switched on the muggle safety and handed his phone to him with baited breath.
"Afternoon."
“No, Dr. Watson, I am not having psychological issues, or a crisis or whatever people are calling it these days. Been there and done that a long time ago. You are a medical man. Examine me yourself if you like. In fact I encourage it.” He extended his arms out in hopes to clear up any perceived notion John was now cooking up in his head to try and normalize the current state of affairs.
Sherlock drew back his sword and tossed the umbrella back to him.
The detective's statement made John's thoughts come to a screeching halt.
"Is this your subtle way of telling me I'm out of a job? Don't get me wrong desk work is still as important but its…its just not the same. I need to do something. Even if it means quitting altogether and maybe going to 's as a healer. I doubt my leg will ever get better or ever have a decent night's sleep again, but I can't be confined to a desk. It will drive me mad."
"That's brilliant!" Sherlock's eyes had flicked over to John's meeting his, brows burrowing slightly over his outburst. "Sorry."
And just like that she pulled her veil down and walked away. Constable Rance was in such a state of fright. He turned in his badge because of what he saw.” Lestrade finished off the rest of his drink, concluding his tale.
blood? Reasoning with himself he figured, no. He had taken careful practice to never getting a cut around the vampire. A habit he started from day one; changing every aspect of his life and daily routine to do so. And now he was going to be going against his hard trained discipline.
Mr. Weasley and John stopped in their walk and Mr. Weasley turned to him.
This time John's words faltered. He felt the interrogation table had been turned against him and it was now the muggle questioning him.
“Holmes, could it have been twins?”
“That was amazing.” John stood following Sherlock.
"Get into the car, Doctor Watson."
Sherlock slammed his hand down on the arm rest of his chair. The audible pound had made John jump and look at him while Mycroft barely seemed fazed by the action.
"Yeah, where are we going?"
"Got anything?" Lestrade broke the silence.
“He can’t call someone to send one of his prisoners over to…give you a sip?”
"Ah, well you won't be going far. The muggle has been doing most of his work here in London. Mike Stamford, the wizard who reported it, will be meeting you at the park near St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Also we will need a new identity for you and I have just the thing. As for reporting to, you can call either myself or Harry." Mr. Weasley handed John a manila file folder and John flipped it open, glancing at the papers.
“Don’t let me keep you. Maybe you can tell me later how its going with Mr. Anemic. Over coffee?”
"A colleague? How do
"Wanna see some more?" With the last question John's heart swelled.
“Jesus.” John’s shoulders sagged at the thought.
His words struck a chord within John. Perhaps he was right. How was he to expect a traumatizing tale of the detective’s own death when he couldn’t even be truthful about his own plagues with his therapist. John’s eyes pulled away from Sherlock’s and suddenly found his cereal more interesting.
“Mycroft is on the continent for a couple of weeks.”
“About six o’clock in the evening.”
“What else?”
“That’s where you are wrong once again,” Sherlock stood to his full height. “I am not employed by the Yard or anyone else. That is why I am a
“So what is your deal with her?” He continued on with his breakfast.
“Not for a very long time. That’s why under careful supervision and a controlled diet, so to speak, I have supplied him what he needs given his circumstances. Now why he has decided to change this arrangement is beyond me. I was hoping you would have provided more insight, but from your statement this morning I am back at the drawing board.”
"Harry and me don't get on, never have. Ginny and Harry split up three months ago and they're getting things sorted; and Harry is a drinker."
“Heaven’s no! Even as a vampire I do have morals. I mean for you to supply me with blood from the hospital as rent payment.”
What had once been a one time occurrence began to take form as a new routine for John. It wasn’t too long after the case of the murdered psychiatric patient that they were swept away again on another adventure. He wasn’t surprised when Sherlock had asked him to come along to join him and he was eager to go. This time however, it was a stake out.
“Your thoughtfulness is much appreciated, but I’ll be fine. Besides I can’t leave right now I’m waiting for someone.”
How was it that people couldn't find Sherlock's talent amazing? The cab arrived at its destination, police cars were surrounding what appeared to be a rundown abandoned apartment building with tape strung up to keep out on lookers. The two men got out of the cab and walk towards the police tape strung across the road, John struggling to keep up with the long strided detective.
He hoped the subtle hint was understood.
"Harry: clearly a family member who's given you his old phone. Not your father; this is a young man's gadget.
"Doctor Watson." Sherlock addressed John again. From his stance he could see he was inviting him to examine the body in which he felt constricted in doing. He knew he needed to for his own information to give back to Auror's, but he didn't want to be caught in the cross fire between the two conflicting men.
"D'you know you do that out loud?"
"Who's this? Who's speaking?"
“Long enough.”
“I believe so. Kind of like how a drug addict gets high. One taste and they’re addicted.”
“And am I just to sit here?” Mary voiced her dismay to her husband.
“They did. Two weeks ago.” Sherlock said frankly.
“How do you know that?” The Inspector asked confused.
"No," John answered. "I switch departments for a change. I'm with the Obiliviator Headquarters just temporarily, giving it a try. I'm being assigned to watch someone. Some bloke using a laboratory at hospital. They think he's up to trouble." John stopped, taking a sip of his coffee. Mike awkwardly looked away and drank his coffee.
“Put off by a kiss I can’t remember?” John asked for the detective. “Not really. Not unless…you were? I mean that must’ve been a taboo thing in your time.”
“Very well. I’ll wire you of any changes.”
“Have you been spying on me? Did you follow me home? God are you a spy?!”
“I never understand when you speak French, but that’s usually normal and I ignore it.” John grabbed his tea and began to drink it.
“Is that why you have been researching more affordable flats in the central London area despite your hospital job and army pension? Can you really live there even knowing you scrap by, living paycheck to paycheck? Please, stay awhile, talk. I know you are not scheduled for work tomorrow and there is no need for you to rush off. Trust me Dr. Watson. I will make this worth your while.”
"Hello?" Came the older man's voice on the line.
"Couldn't Harry help?" Mike asked.
In that instance the staring spell was broken as Sherlock’s frame pulled back at John’s words. His face was no longer cold or indifferent, but something akin to remembering a memory one wants to readily forget because it brings them sorrow. His gaze turned away from John and back to his computer.
“A moment.” Holmes paused Lestrade’s story with a raised hand. “When was this?”
He ventured further down the street trying to find any sign of the tall lanky muggle. Though the more he walked the more the crowds of people on the street got denser. There would be no way he was going to be able to find him like this. How was it that this man got away so fast? So far his first day as an Obilivator was not looking well. His attention was drawn to another phone booth that began ringing for no reason. For a moment he observed it and found nothing unremarkable about it, though curious if it was a phone booth that had been modified for Ministry employees. A thought occurred to him that perhaps they were trying to get a hold of him and without any greater judgement went inside the phone booth and answered the ringing contraption.
John had learned by now, very quickly in fact, when Sherlock made these short biting statements he was trying to hide something.
"We have some new modified muggle things that we have been testing out on the field and so far they have proved to be quite a success. Ah here." He picked up a laptop computer and showed it, with careful handling as though it was made of glass, to John.
“As it turned out, he was saved the trip.”
hungry.
"Yeah, I see it."
“You sure?”
“Normal? I think you killed that idea on the night you brought me here.”
"Fine with me."
those. There's always something to look forward to."
Sherlock turned quick and met John’s face with a impish grin.
No longer could he oblige John with tea. Every time he drew near the man Sherlock’s eyes would drop from his face, attuned to the pulsating rhythm of his artery that thrummed under the of his neck. All he would have to do was reach across the table and take hold of him. He would never see it coming, he was too quick. No longer could he find comfort in the violin that sat silently by the window. The poisonous thoughts had distorted the way he held the instrument. All he could see anymore was his fingers digging into the frets as if he was giving his victim a deadly hold by the neck. It didn’t matter what it was. Anything was bringing about thoughts of violence to get what he wanted.
“There will be nothing to tell. It will be a dead end case. Unsolved. Surprisingly, Lestrade will be very easy to convince.”
“So basically you used me and made me do laps,” John huffed as he caught up to him. “Brilliant.” He went to stairs to go to his own room. After all he had work in the morning and running around with an undead twat had made him exhausted.
“Good Lord.” Sherlock sighed “Are you going to continue to hold that above my head?”
Professor McGonagall couldn't help but smile.
"Rightly so. You must forgive me I haven't had the chance to tidy up a bit and sort things out. Just moved in myself a few weeks back but I have been engrossed in work. I'm sure with both our incomes we can live quite simply. What say you?"
“And neither was that.” Lestrade pointed to the stone wall nearby. Walking towards the wall he picked up a lantern to illuminate it more clearly. Removing all interest of the dead woman, Holmes and Watson followed him to see what the Inspector had found. In the light from the lantern, a single word was painted on the stony surface, red, in blood.
“You do, actually, quite a lot.” Watson verified and this earned him a narrowing of the eyes of the sleuth.
He didn't realize that the man was referring to him once more, actually he still couldn't believe the audacity of his behavior towards the poor girl that this man was capable of making a decent conversation.
“Looking back on my behavior now, I see I may have overstepped my bounds…and yours. I do hope you do not hold it against me. Bringing you here and altering your life. It was never my intention to make you feel uncomfortable.’’
“Oh yes. I trust them more than government officials. A user knows a user. Ah, there he is now. Going to go have a cigarette, John. Be back in a flash.”
"Right, yeah, thanks,
“Wh...uncle? Uncle? He’s your uncle?!” John exclaimed as he pointed to Sherlock.
The morning came stead fast for John. The rays of sunlight brought mind a realization of hope to him. He had made it through the night. In a sense of urgency he bounded out of his bed and made towards the full length mirror by his closet door. He checked his neck, arms, wrists, and the plains of his body. Every inch of skin he inspected for any sign of a bite. None was found. He breathed out a sigh of relief and went to the window to find it still locked. Even his door. All was as Sherlock had said. He hadn’t bothered him. At least he was going to think that way. He hoped that the vampire didn’t have some key to his room where he could come and go as he pleased. Or was that superstition now null and void since now John was the one who occupied and lived in the room? Would Sherlock be forced to be an uninvited guest in a part of his own home until John gave the word to let him in?
11:35pm.
John's jaw slacked opened a bit. How in the devil did he know he had been job hunting?
“Like people who have a photographic memory?”
"Mmm, yes."
"Of course. Though…there is one more thing." John could hear him setting a tray and footsteps coming closer. Finally, John would come face to face with the man he had been speaking to.
“Yes! Am I speaking French or do you not understand?”
Guilt crept up in John and thought perhaps he approached on a sensitive topic. After all, how does one joke and talk to one who is already dead without offending them? What exactly was the social etiquette? Deciding that it was best to keep his mouth shut instead of inserting his foot again he muttered a quick gratitude and made his way to the bathroom. He found it with ease, though noticed at the end of the hallway was another door. The dark wooden structure hung on its hinges in a sinister manner the way no light played upon its frame. Shadows clung to it like cobwebs and the door itself was closed tightly as if it was a jail cell.
"You know how they never leave notes?"
“If you ever catch yourself failing to stay away from or to try and…drink…from me, will you let me know?”
Sherlock took the piece of paper out of his pack of cigarette’s and handed it to John.
John nodded.
“Running after the devil is one thing. Staving off one, is entirely another matter. I believe it would be safer for us both if I went home. At least for awhile.”
John had already tuned her out as picture in the paper caught his eye. The front page story was oddly enough about the suicides Sherlock and the Inspector were just discussing. A brief scan of the article suggested all the suicides were concurrent with one another given the fact the victims had all taken the same poison. Glancing down near the bottom of the page there in the corner was a photo of the same man that had visited them moments before: Greg Lestrade, D.I.
“Yes, idiots. Poetry or truth?”
After being stripped down raw by the muggle, John could only breathe out one statement.
"Lumos." The lamp turned back on and John suddenly sat back up, flipping open the folder again to the young detective's page. "What exactly was you poking around in? How did you even find our case?" He skimmed his finger down through the page as it rested on his destination.
“You look very dashing Watson. The dark brown sports coat and the light blue dress shirt compliment your complexion and eyes.” His deep voice was soft yet sincere as he gave him a small smile.
"Sherlock, there was no case!" Lestrade barked at him.
Sherlock waived a hand of indifference at John’s comment and adjusted his suit jacket.
“I’m not even sure if I want to know.” John dropped the subject.
“A smear of blood on her finger. That could have happened any number of ways.” said Watson.
“Actually,” his pupils constricted in scrutiny as he studied the off guard confronted doctor. “Lestrade this is Dr. John Watson. He lives in the room above me. Doctor this is Lestrade from Scotland Yard.”
“Yeah you should see the guy. Bad hemoglobin levels, anemic, pale as a damn ghost. Not healthy I tell you. Thanks.”
"It wasn't working for me."
“You know I don’t even remember seeing you. On the street that night. I don’t remember you bringing me here either. How
This caught Sherlock’s attention as he looked up from his phone and slipped it back into his pocket.
Though there was one thing John had failed to mention to Sherlock and that was the mysterious invisible note upon the window. He wondered now if it was important or not since Sherlock had set the Yard straight. But the heavy singular word of “YOU” had made his blood go cold. Not because he thought the girl had wrote it, but because it was wrote on the outside and in a direction where anyone could read it. Even her. It was why John had questioned Sherlock’s change in story. He shook off his wavering feelings and returned his attention back to Sherlock.
“I would think if I was here that you would know the answer Donovan. However, since you can’t put two and two together I’ll make it simple for you and say yes.”
John watched her go, grateful she had been called away before he could say something not so nice himself. The ringing of a nearby phone booth pulled him from his now sour mood to refocus, he had a call to make himself. Making his way further down the street and away from the crime scene John pulled out his mobile phone, flipping through the contacts for Harry and rang him up.
“Well I gathered that from day one, but what is your real age?”
“Uh…sorry.” John looked away, his cheeks burning from being caught. As he occupied his gaze out the window he turned his cane into the floorboard in his hands at his embarrassment.
John's brows furrowed again. Surely this department didn't need special equipment just to do simple social work and watch muggles. John had come from a muggle family himself and it was to his parents shock, and John's, that he had received a letter from Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardy when he was a child. But, nevertheless, his parents were proud and supported him going to an unconventional school to learn about this new identity of his life and every summer and winter he would come home to tell them all that he had learned. Until the last year of school. Shaking his head of the morbid thoughts he focused back at the task on hand.
"Serial killers are always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake." Sherlock smiled to himself.
“Anything in her therapy notes saying if she saw these figures here?” Sherlock asked.
it came from.
John stepped into the sitting room and he could see Sherlock had definitely gotten the call. He was wildly at work. The wall over the sofa was already being decorated in maps, papers and pictures. Strings tied one lead to the next in a flowing maze across different items of interest. One by one Sherlock thumbtacked a new segment here and there, adjusting where needed be, like a giant wall of abstract art.
“Look at his clothes. Dust has been smeared on his shirt due to the filthy air. Filters haven’t been cleaned regularly in this building; leading to the accumulation of dust in the duct work. Yet his flat is spotless. Your murderer was clever but not that clever. He was like a mouse in a hole in the wall. Or in this case the duct work.”
"Gracious. And here I thought you wanted a quiet life after your time in the Auror's."
Curiosity got the better of John as he asked what they normally said in which Sherlock only replied "Piss off." John couldn't help but smile and drink his tea, watching as the other smiled in return. All the ice that was between them was broken. John had met Felisian's before but never did interact with any of them. And now it seemed he was getting his full dose.
“He’s still here.” Sherlock charged up the stairs, Lestrade in tow trailing behind him.
“I don’t remember calling for a ride.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak again but immediately shut it. His confusion dissipating into more understanding.
“What is it?” Sherlock asked as he started to ascend the stairs leading to the front door.
John watched their interaction with interest. He noted the blank face and stiff posture that this man was trying his hardest to stay somewhat civil to the woman who had struck a nerve in him.
"Cardiff?" Lestrade questioned.
John took off his jacket and started to put on the garment when he noticed Sherlock only picked up a pair of latex gloves not bothering to put on the suit he and the Inspector were wearing.
you know?"
The young pathologist assistant had become a good friend of his and brought a sense of normalcy into his life. Given the fact she was the few “live” friends he had. John had decided after he met her that it would probably be in his best interest to be on good terms with her. It allowed him easy access to the labs below the hospital and he could freely come and go whenever he pleased. This meant hunting for blood became a lot simpler. And her odd disposition and scatterbrained demeanor meant she was never none the wiser and never noticed anything out of place.
"You sure about that? Not sure what the Ministry will think of that situation."
“Sherlock?” John rose from his chair and followed him. “When you said the case would be unsolved you mean that you got rid of him, right? What did you do with the body?”
“I believe you do recall from your physical examination of me that I was not breathing. I wanted you to be completely sober while you diagnosed me. The only air I breathe is to speak or to smell. Otherwise I have no use for oxygen since I am dead. Besides for my attributes to be…successful…so to speak, I would have to be right upon you. I would say you are relatively safe in my presence.”
So sorry it has taken me a hot minute to update! I have been non-stop working at my job and its been crazy. The only times I have for writing are in the middle of the night and sometimes I have productive nights and others not so much. But without further ado here is chapter 3. It took me awhile to figure out how I wanted to piece this together, but if some things sound odd it will because they will be explained and/or revealed in later chapters.
“I heard it was bad. Had to be. We kept getting orders to the lab one right after another for blood. I’ve never seen so many orders. Now we’re going to have to look for more.”
“Depending on what market you sell blood it can run the average cost of today’s rent with two or three pints. I say its a fair trade.”
The phone line suddenly went dead as he eyed the car by the curb. This surely wasn't part of the Obiliviator's job? Right? The more deeper and deeper he got into this case with the muggle, the stranger it got. Now he knew if he got into this car he wasn't sure if he would be coming back at all. This muggle who had easily called him from a phone box already knew his cover name for Christ's sake! Who was he?! The fight or flight was high in his system, but deep down he knew he had no option. He had to go. If he fled, Aparating away from this new fresh danger, his cover would be blown. On top of that there would be no video footage of his subtle kidnapping. It would be like he had vanished into the night.
"Spot on, then. I didn't expect to be right about everything." He said impressed with himself.
“So bloody hot today. I don’t see how you stand it.” Molly had taken up fanning herself with the folder she had brought. She had already shrugged off her lab coat and had gathered up her hair to get it off the nape of her neck to allow some semblance of a breeze to cool her off. But the humidity was doing her no favors.
“Thirsty?” John asked boldly.
The case in said violation; a kelpie had started attacking a village drainage pipe into a lake. There were reports from muggles that there was supposedly a "monster" in the lake, as they heard groans and roars from within and a glowing "dragon" and fish at night. The glowing was only a recent occurrence in the past couple of years. Naturally the detective was hired and he took the case, not because he was interested in said monster, he was more interested in the drainage pipe. In the end he found that a power plant run by terrorist cell was illegally draining nuclear waste into the lake and the plot was shut down immediately. Now the kelpie was being relocated, the lake cleaned, and minds Obliviated of any "monster". Ultimately solving the Ministry's mystery of what was going on with the lake, the kelpie and the breach. So didn't he actually…help?
Reaching for his phone again he called up Arthur.
Anderson hesitated once more, but before he could answer, the door to the adjoining room opened. Holmes turned to look at the new arrival, a man of soft young features and a mustache. Almost feminine in characteristic. Hooper was a man of peculiar ways. His reasoning for his code of conduct never made sense to the detective, but regardless of what he thought there were times that the coroner made him think outside the box. Even if they barely saw eye to eye.
“The back of your collar had flipped,” Sherlock said as he straightened it back in place and withdrew his hand. “I can’t have my doctor looking unsightly before we arrive.”
“Wait, then how do I not remember that either?”
“Good morning.” The vampire popped out of the kitchen to greet John who was startled out of his skin, not expecting him to still be awake. His appearance seemingly had transformed over night. No longer did he look like walking corpse with ivory skin and tired eyes. The sun caressed his skin and gave it a youthful glow. Pale dusk lips were now rosy. Dark hallow eyes now shown in radiance. He had also changed his clothes to a more brighter display of a lilac button up dress shirt and black trousers. Even a silk maroon robe adorned him. The only theory John could come up with to Sherlock looking more alive was that he had to have done something recently. A meal. He did say he was going to be ‘busy’ last night.
When Sherlock was finished he nodded his head for John to follow him, but the doctor did not budge. As if sensing his hesitancy about the questionable place they were now in, the detective came over to John and linked his arm with his at the elbow. Guiding him down a hallway like a man would guide a woman down the street in older films. John felt the impertinent blush start to rise again, but quickly brushed it away before he was seduced by another spell.
in here."
John stood in awe again at the deduction this man had brought forth from the deepest darkest crevice he had buried.
“Quiet.” He commanded and the room came to a pause and stared at Sherlock with confused expressions. But John had caught on a little faster than the rest. He could see the quick twitch of the feline’s ear underneath the hat and knew he had heard something of great importance. Enough to summon a complete stand still.
Chapter 11
“Yea. I’ll check again today. Hopefully now that most of the hype has calmed down there is bound to be something.”
“Mrs. Hudson? Who’s Mrs. Hudson? Is she a one too?”
Led like a man of importance on parade, Sherlock was escorted to the patient’s room. To say it was a room of residence for a patient seemed rather bleak when they entered. No curtains draped the window, neither were there any sort of bed sheets or pillows of any kind. Windows were locked, a TV screwed into the wall itself, the door to the bathroom was sloped at an odd angle on its hinges. Nothing looked right in the room, but this didn’t seem to deter Sherlock as he glided around the room checking every crevice known to man.
“Know this, Sherlock does everything for a reason, in some form or another. Whether we understand why he does it makes little difference to him. It is easier for him know something than to explain why he knows it. He has had a set schedule of living for as long as he has lived. And when he suddenly does something out of the ordinary it is like a rock being dropped into water. It splashes. Makes a mess. And its ripples are what follows in its wake. The thing is, is the rock as already splashed. It is the mess that I am waiting for.”
The man's rounded face nodded in recognition, but was unsure whether to press on with his questions any further. He didn't want upset or bring back bad memories to the Auror. He waved him to a nearby bench and handed John a hot cup of coffee.
“The paracetamol will kick in soon. I might even have a hot shower.” John leaned back against the counter, glass in hand as he watched the detective turn the knobs of his microscope ever so slowly.
Sherlock seemed to have busied himself resuming whatever work on the computer he had been doing prior to his meeting with John. For a brief moment he didn’t look like a demon who couldn’t be trusted, but like any other human doing regular human things. Sherlock gave him a quick glance before returning his gaze back to the screen.
“Putting it in that light sounds quite impersonal and depressing. I could say you will be my colleague.”
“Thank you.” John’s words came out solemnly.
"Sherlock," Lestrade cut off the pair. "two minutes, I said. I need anything you've got."
“Exactly that. It will last a few days until it is regulated in my system again. Then the symptoms will go away.”
It had been going on for a half an hour now, almost a full forty-five minutes. John was trying to be inconspicuous by being fully invested in the paper he was reading, which at first he was, until the fine hairs on the back of his neck began to tingle with a sense of alarm. He knew it was Sherlock.
"Yeah. He's always like that. And congratulations on not beating the blazes out of him."
"Well the only way you are going to survive in London is to get a flatmate."
Heavy mist was trying to turn into rain, but luckily they had been spared the weather’s change by the cover of the roof of an empty parking garage. The top most part gave them the surveillance they needed to keep a clever eye on the street below; watching and waiting for their  suspect. As a trained military man John was accustomed to waiting out the enemy in more harsher climates of the desert. London’s weather appeared to be no different. They were going on their third hour of their watch and so far there was no word from Sherlock to indicate he had seen them.
Emelia Ricoletti. She has been categorically identified. Beyond a doubt it is her.” Hooper stated.
"Good luck John. Make sure to always stay by him. I'm sure you won't regret it."
He distinctly remembered leaving work at 11:20pm. How long was he out before he awoke here? He had been talking with this man, to him, it felt like no more than ten minutes. If that was indeed the case, how had his captor get him from St. Bart’s to Baker St in no less than five minutes?
“Your abilities. What exactly can you do? I know there are hundreds of myths and legends about vampires, but what exactly is the truth? At least for you.”
“Oh.” John let out a shaky breath he didn’t realize he was holding in. His shoulders eased up from the tension he had built up for himself. Another thought occurred to him. If he was a detective and a vampire, why not hunt the criminals? Then again did he really want to ask? Let alone how…no. A snorted laugh came from him unexpectedly.
"Wait, no," Lestrade stopped him perturbed by the idea of having a third party inspect the dead woman "we have a whole team right outside."
With hesitation John slipped under the tape Sherlock had held up for him. The sergeant, who was clearly not impressed by the men's presence, clicked over her radio to page the officers inside the building.
hoping you'd go deeper."
"Please don't tell me you are a mass murdering maniac. I haven't even drank my tea yet though now I'm wondering about it since you ensured Mrs. Hudson's husband's death." John confessed in a hurry and without a second thought. Once the words were out he felt as though he had put his foot in his mouth by most likely offending the residing occupant.
“What club?”
One of Sherlock's ears flicked back to John and his eyes narrowed back at him again. Surely he hadn't heard him right.
"Her wedding ring." Sherlock pointed to her ringed left hand. "Ten years old at least. The rest of her jewelry has been regularly cleaned, but not her wedding ring. State of her marriage right there. The inside of the ring is shinier than the outside – that means it's regularly removed. The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger. Rather who does she remove her rings for? Clearly not one lover; she'd never sustain the fiction of being single over that amount of time, so more likely a string of them. Simple."
“What would you do? If I did refuse?”
"Anderson won't work with me."
"And there was something else. A note, burned into the goddamn wall, but it was in German. RACHE, means revenge. Do we know of anyone that's German that's pissed off at Umbridge enough to kill her? And the detective he's out searching right now for a suitcase that belonged to either Umbridge or Jennifer Wilson. May need to send a team out here too."
"Look at you, all happy. It's not decent." She tutted again.
But the question now was what was triggering it? Was it the location? The fact they were waiting on a suspect? The possibilities were endless. The main thing right now though was to distract Sherlock of his plagued thoughts.
Visualizing the scene of the crime was the upmost importance of his methods. It was like making a painting upon a canvas. Every detail had to be precise in order to see the full picture. Lighting, position, colors and shapes is what he formulated within his mind palace. Every once and a while he stepped back to view different angles to see the secrets that laid hidden to the unobservant.
"Her case! Come on, where is her case? Did she eat it?! Someone else was here, and they took her case. So the killer must have driven her here; forgot the case was in the car."
He sighed heavily and looked at his watch. Quarter till six already. Another fifteen minutes before his guest arrived and possibly turn right around and leave. Either way he had determined this would be the last one.
“One thing you must understand John, I have lived many years and am far older than you. I have felt loss, grief, and anger longer and more deeply than most. Sure my transition into the being that I am happened a long time ago, but there are times it haunts my dreams as though it just happened yesterday,” Sherlock stood and produced a lunch box that had been nestled on top of the fridge and set it on the table. “You need to hurry if you are going to be on time for work. Take the lunch box with you. I’m sure it will be…discrete…if you follow my meaning.”
“What’s a mind palace?”
John smiled in disbelief that this guy obviously didn't see what the problem was. John looked at Mike for some sort of clue or hint to how to deal with him, but once again all he could do was grin.
John couldn’t help but snigger and before he could control his mouth and realize who and what he was speaking to; let out the first thing that popped into his mind.
“Sorry, I was trying to be quiet when I came down. I knew you was busy.”
John shook his head of the muggle's strange behavior and followed him to the police tape. An officer saw them approach and her smug smile gave off a arrogance that matched her long curly hair.
Lestrade briefly glanced over the clipboard and back to Sherlock.
“Is that how people in your family usually make friends? They just pick them off the street like vultures terrifying them half to death?”
Sherlock, on the other hand, seemed to be lacking in patience. In the time they had spent waiting he had managed to easily burn through half a pack of cigarettes. His continuous pacing and smoking did nothing to quell his anxiousness and frankly it was beginning to make John nervous himself.
“Oh let’s hear it. Might as well since we’re waiting.”
"What happened to the lipstick?" His dark brows furrowed in confusion as he waited on her explanation. Even John glanced at her, noticing a small smudge of leftover pink lipstick on the corner of her mouth. Must've went unnoticed by her, perhaps in a hurry to get the coffee to impress him.
“Who’s Wiggins?”
"You must be John. Come in, come in," she smiled and ushered him through the door. "And you are the solider fellow correct? Sorry my mind sometimes slips around and I've had all sorts come to see about the room. "
Well that didn’t take long. Then again the detective was working in high gear tonight. Keeping his mind sharp and pristine.
John watched as the detective slipped on his long dark coat which had been draped over his desk chair, tail slinking up the inside. Flattening his ears against his head he tucked them inside a deerstalker cap he had produced out of his coat pocket. Some well fitted black gloves were next that slipped graciously onto his long fingers. John thought he looked down right ridiculous. He had seen old detective movies and never did he ever see someone look more the part. Though he was curious as to why all the concealment. Was he ashamed of who he was or was there more prejudice matters at hand? He was about to set off in a dash but stopped suddenly by the doorway, turning towards John in thought.
John's walk ended at a black door with golden letters of 221B gleaming overhead and a large door knocker. The unknown waiting behind its void color. With simple twist of his wrist he popped off the top of his cane, double checking the compartment in which held his wand in secrecy. Satisfied that everything was in place he quickly popped the top back on and knocked the door as a cab pulled up to the curb. John watched as the man he had met just yesterday paid the driver and now faced him with now a cooler demeanor. The detective smiled at him, this time John thought it was actually a true smile and not the fiendish grin from the lab.
“You mean you did it…two weeks ago? Two weeks?!”
"Hello, freak." Her nasally voice was harsh on the ears.
The steam of the water brought him out of his thoughts as his eyes drifted over to the niche in the wall to the side of the tub and found a familiar bar of soap and shampoo. The scents couldn’t be mistaken. They were his own necessities. Now that he was aware of this new fact his eyes darted up to the sink and sure enough nestled in a cup was his toothbrush and toothpaste.
Sherlock watched as the doctor retreated up the stairs to his room. This had been an odd night indeed. One where it had pulled on the lingering lines to his past. The case had been brief but it had brought a dark foreboding feeling of dread. Something he could not readily place. Like a word one has forgotten but hides at the end of ones tongue beckoning to be spoken into existence.Sherlock laid on the sofa and closed his eyes, resting his hands under his chin. There was only one solution to this prickling sensation in his mind and that was to go and seek answers.
"Shut up." Sherlock blurted out unexpectedly startling both John and Lestrade in the impregnable silence.
“As potential flatmates should.”
"Do you think so?" The meek question of the detective threw John for a loop.
He pulled the plug of the drain and got out of the delicious embrace of the water. He dried off quickly, put on his pajamas, gathered up his belongings and made his way out of the bathroom. Sherlock was still where he had left him and John had no intentions of disturbing him and made right for the stair case.
"I know what your feeling John. I know it is nowhere near to what you experienced, but I was once attacked and left for dead by Voldemort's minions as well. It is an uneasy feeling. An uncertain feeling. Like the evening has fallen and you are not sure if the sun will ever rise again. But it does John, it does."
"So where will I be going and where do I report to?"
“Someone had to come and look in on you Dr. Watson. Or recover you. Whichever came first.” The man that was speaking was older, well dressed in a crisp suit and barely looked like anything resembling Sherlock. His frame was not as lean, his nose protruded over like a beak and he did not have the luscious locks, but more likely losing it.
Tension filled the air so thick it had made John pause in his breakfast and stare at the man before him. How was it that Sherlock could pry into his inner most nightmares and tease at demons to reveal themselves. As quickly as the onslaught came, just like a passing storm, the clouds lifted off Sherlock’s face; straightening back in his chair letting his presence soften.
"Suitcase?" The Inspector asked confused.
John rose up from the chair, discarding the paper, and answered with a simple 'Yes'.
"I got shot."
“Quite a lot actually,’’ Sherlock admitted with a playful raised eyebrow. “Wiggins gathers information for me in the lower places of the city, I pay him for it, he takes his money, and gets whatever exhilarating drug he desires.”
“Unprocessed. It must've not have gone through the separation process just yet. Do you know who donated this blood?”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth tipped up in a smile. So this was how he was doing it. Easier to trick the mind into thinking one thing is actually something else. Clever doctor.
The two men smoked and chatted on the pavement; blending in with the crowd. Once they finished the man known as Wiggins left to scurry back to wherever he came from. The detective gave a brief glance over to John and the doctor took that as his cue to follow. He finished off the last piece of his sandwich and headed outside to trail after Sherlock who had already started down the street and made a sharp turn down an alley.
“Yes, the club Watson.”
“No, I don’t think that will be necessary. However, I think with your absence of pulse, lack of oxygen intake, and no findings of normal sinus rhythm I would say you are, without a doubt, quite dead.”
Wasting no time he unscrewed the cap and took his first drink. The taste was like opening an old vintage wine. A flavor he had not tasted in a nearly a hundred years since the creation of blood banks. The blood was rich in iron that created a coppery tang on his tongue. The parched plains of his mouth and throat were immediately blessed. He could practically feel it already metabolizing in his system like a rush of a drug. He had forgotten what it tasted like to have fresh blood, live blood, one that could sustain him. He forgot how addicting it was, just like the cocaine that was his mistress long ago. He wanted to savor this. There was such a unique taste to it he was sure he had never tasted one quite like it before.
"And there went any chance of a date you ass." John watched him as he didn't even so much as look at the poor soul's defeated face as he went back to his station to the other side of the lab.
“I am not a hound, John.” Sherlock said as he lit his cigarette and exhaled the fumes from his mouth. “In theory and thinking I see your reasoning, but it is not all that simple. A suspect may leave their scent at the crime scene, but if left to the elements it can die out. And the suspect can easily wash off the victim’s blood off their person. You see to me the scent of a person and the scent of blood are two distinct smells. One is created by the natural hormones of the body that can be sweat or odor. And depending on the body the smell can range based on their lifestyle and health. The other, made by blood, is a scent all on its own. Since blood contains Iron atoms there is a metallic note to it. Some have it stronger than others. Even right now I could probably pinpoint here on the street who has a wound and who does not simply by following the smell of blood.”
Seemed like word traveled fast, however it always did in the Daily Prophet. No doubt half of England had heard of his unfortunate latest excursion.
what was he thinking? John looked down at the IV kit he had just set up on the metal tray table. Beside him was a pole with an empty bag. All of it ready for a donation. It wasn’t that he was opposed or weirded out by the sight of blood and needles on his own skin. It was the fact he was setting up this donation not for a live patient, but a dead one.
“It wasn’t the doctor. Nor the regular staff. I believe her hallucinations of the people she saw were real. Falling prey to a serial killer. You are looking for someone who has ties to the occult. No doubt she was their latest victim and sacrifice.”
“Impossible!” His wife remarked.
Desperate times call for desperate measures as Sherlock suffers from not being fed leading to John to take matters into his own hands.
A quiet night in was something John definitely needed. From the failed stake out attempt days prior the dust had yet to settle between him and the detective. Whether it was the fact that the suspect was now disposed of in a nameless grave or that Sherlock had caused said death; he didn’t know what disturbed him more. He understood the vampire’s reasoning, truly he did, and for that he was grateful, but he never expected the situation to blow up so quickly. Since then he felt cautious around Sherlock when he knew he didn’t need to.
A dead on arrival teenage boy. A uni student. Shrapnel was imbedded into his skin on one side. He must have seen the brunt end of the explosion and was unfortunate to have a piece slice into his carotid artery. A phone call to his parents was going to have to be made to let them know their son was in the morgue.
“’Til death us do part. Twice, in this case.” Holmes smiled at the Inspector. Just like him to save the good parts till last. Now this was getting interesting. This was the masterpiece he was trying to paint on his easel. And what a grand spectacle it was!
John thought cautiously.
“Does it not you?”
Sherlock finally reached the ground floor and disappeared from sight.
“Well, um…yeah, I’m looking for the uh labs. I ordered blood about half an hour ago and it still hasn’t turned up yet. So I came down myself. To get it.”
"Okay, you've got questions." The muggle shoved his phone back into the pocket of his coat.
"So he's done it to you then? This "deduction" thing? What is it?" John was beginning to get leery abut how this muggle had such an effect on people.
Sherlock only gave John a stern look before following the Inspector. John made a mental note that the muggle seemed to like to play by his own rules and not the rules of the police force which he found odd. He thought that a man with such intellectual acuity as his own he would like to be a perfectionist when it came to finding clues and not contaminating a crime scene.
The vampire closed the door of the bathroom softly, ending unspoken words and meanings.
“None of this is legal!”
“Still hasn’t come by yet?”
The first weekend with Sherlock had flew by and went without a hitch. John saw very little of him during the day as he was out procuring evidence for one of his cases and when he returned home he kept to himself, engrossed in his work. He paid John no mind whatsoever and John stayed within his own parameters. As Sherlock had said he was under no obligation to interact with him if he so chose. When the weekend came to a close and the new work week crept up, John really felt no different than if he was living at his previous flat. He was surprised in himself that he transitioned and was taking this as well as he was, but so far the vampire had done nothing to harm him and actually paid him little attention. Maybe he was being paranoid for nothing.
“You will have to forgive me,” The deep velvet baritone voice of his captor resonated through the room as he began his introduction. “This is not the usual way I receive people into my home. Though I think if you are of open, conscious and sound mind then you may be comfortable in what I have to propose to you.”
“A junkie looking for another fix. He also happens to be an irregular of mine.”
"The police don't consult amateurs." He turned away as his gaze watched the traffic out the window.
“Oh?”
“Ah,” Sherlock answered. “I see your knowledge of my kind is low. What exactly do you know if I may ask? Or is your view of us clouded by myths and rumors?”
Sherlock is back in the game since the new blood supply has turned up. Perhaps its a little too good as John notices the detective dive back into normality in full force and a new abundance of energy.
In all of less than an hour John had been pulled off the street and rendered unconscious, brought to a stranger’s home, performed a medical exam on a vampire, and now was moving in. All to find out he had been prepping up for him, waiting for the right time to take action, even moving him out of his own flat.
“You’re staring.” Sherlock simply stated.
“Terrorist attack?” John’s thoughts raced. “Surely Lestrade is blowing up Sherlock’s phone right now.”
"Why d'you keep saying suitcase?" Lestrade interrupted, jarring Sherlock back to the situation at hand.
“So he’s a crackhead homeless spy? And you
"Ah, impressing him, she must like him. And he is a tall dark haired striking fellow. What lady wouldn't like that? And he was obviously happy that he got the coffee and even noticed the small detail about her lipstick. So he must be interested as well." John concluded his answer to himself. However, her hesitating voice spoke volumes more. In the other direction.
"I didn't say anything." The Inspector chided.
Turning to the last camera John watched as it too moved out of view.
“I’m so sorry.” John could only say.
"He's gone."
John nodded.
John looked up at him and nodded his head.
“Afghanistan.” The ghostly whisper played in Sherlock’s mind once again. He knew then that this wasn’t chance. That the universe indeed was not lazy. That this was not coincidence. Or maybe he was just being too hopeful.
John had heard his command but his body simply refused to obey. He knew he needed to leave.
“Holmes.”
John knocked generously on the black lacquered door of 221B. Coming home from the war and discharged to civilian life had left him estranged from family and in need of a place to live. The advertisement he had seen days before felt like a golden opportunity for the weary solider that had fallen straight into his lap.
John was surprised to find a blog, oddly enough on the said "deductions". Clicking on it, it brought up Sherlock's inner most writings, scribbles and thoughts in the most dry manner one could imagine. Based on the count meter, very, very few people had read his blog. Or they had read it and quickly clicked away from the utter nonsense.
“No rent if she could be my housekeeper,” Sherlock paused as he poured tea into a RAMC mug he had plucked out of the cabinet. Another thing of John’s that he had settled in under his nose. “Now I may not know how to cook, but I do know how to make a proper cup of tea.”
“Its…my breath.”
"Now what can I do for you?"
Sherlock spun around in circle quickly surveying the run down room.
"I looked you up on the internet last night." John confessed.
"But you're not his friend." The woman's words hit at him unexpectedly and he turned back to face her. "He doesn't have friends. So who are you?"
By the kerb was a parked black car. The vehicle itself did not appear threatening, but the person who sat inside it with the door open, waiting for him to draw closer.
The pair walked away from the crime scene and made their way back home.
“Oh for God’s sake!” Sherlock plopped in his chair, resting his head on the balled up fist of his hand. If looks could kill Sherlock’s menacing eyes could’ve easily killed an army by the way he looked at Mycroft.
“Yes?” Sherlock probed.
"There is a park near the hospital. Why don't you guys meet there. Say twelve?"
The two men slipped into the cab, starting their journey as a silence grew between the two. John didn't have the chance to get to the bottom of his question back at the flat. And he wasn't exactly sure how long their ride would last, but he had to get the muggle to open up. Right now the man beside him had his attention transfixed on his phone, typing away God knows what. Sherlock's eyes gave him the briefest looks and he gave out a soft sigh.
"Come along John. I think there is something you can do. If you are interested that is. It's social work, but it shouldn't be too difficult. All you have to do is observe and report to us." Harry explained as he arose from his desk and made way for the door, expecting John to follow.
"There's always something!" He hissed under his breath, ignoring his question as he bypassed him.
Sherlock set the tray on the end table next to John, handing him his tea, and collecting a cup and saucer for himself and settling in the chair across from him. The emotions he saw fleet across his guest's face was that of shock, surprise and even fascination. No doubt it was because of his features that defined his very being. His mop of black glossy curly hair was home to two black triangular ears much like that of a cat. His pale skin made his unnerving icy blue eyes stand out. The pupil also cat like with their oval definition. The hands that embraced his cup and saucer were gracefully long, musician's hands, the nails a distinct opaque color and thicker than any humans. Normally longer, sharper, he had trimmed his down to the edges of his fingers. Easier to play the violin with no claws in the way. And lastly, curled over the edge of his seat, a thick rope of a tail, its tip flicking side to side. The black fur of the tail was more slim at the beginning and filling out more till it ended in a plume.
As soon as he was out of sight, John grabbed his purchases from this morning from his bag. He ran to his room and tossed the lube in the drawer next to his condoms. He doubted they'd need those things tonight but as a doctor and a veteran he knew it was better safe than sorry. He went back to the living room and quickly began to set up and light the candles. Sherlock reemerged, freshly shaven, too, and gave John a winning smile. "I sure hope my mouth is now to your satisfaction." John rolled his eyes and continued to light the candles. When he was finished, he opened the containers of food and plopped the spaghetti onto two plates, unwrapped the garlic bread, and sat down on the couch next to Sherlock, handing him his dinner.
John nudged him further onto the bed and propped himself up on his left elbow. With his right, he slowly slid his hand down into Sherlock's pants and grasped his cock loosely. Sherlock hissed and arched. John stared in wonder. He began to massage Sherlock, all the while watching his face for any sign that he wasn't comfortable. There were none. On the contrary, Sherlock's eyes were closed and his mouth hung open and he was taking deep, shuddering breaths. John had to bite that damn lip again. He started to kiss down his jaw, worked his way across his throat, and began to suckle on his ear, all the while steadily and gently massaging his now throbbing cock.
Sherlock raised his hands in acquiescence, took a drag of his cigarette and said "Okay. I'll let you win this round. In thanks for these DELICIOUS things." John kissed him again, made a face at the DISGUSTING taste, and slowly made his way to his bedroom to change, wishing all the while he could just call in sick and snog Sherlock until it was dark enough to light the candles.
When John got off work, he stopped at Giovanni's. He was thinking about his first meeting there with Sherlock. The first time Sherlock thought he was hitting on him and John felt compelled to tell him he wasn't gay, but that it was okay if Sherlock was. He laughed at that now, standing in line for his pickup order. The hostess looked at him oddly and he just smiled back. He gave her a five pound note for a tip when she handed him his order and said "I promise I'm not mad. I have a date tonight. Just a bit excited." She smiled and told him to have a good night. Oh, he planned to.
A few hours later, Sherlock returned home hoping that John had just forgotten the whole thing. No such luck, he thought as soon as he walked in and found John facing the door, obviously intent on pickng up where they had left off.
Sherlock moaned and buried his face in John's neck, going back to work on his prized hickey and thrusting gently into John's warm hand. When he started to feel like he was close and John was sufficiently writhing beneath him, he sat up onto his knees and grabbed John by the hips, pulling him into his lap. John was obviously caught off guard by this sudden show of force but melted into Sherlock's aggressive kiss all the same. Sherlock began to rub his hand up and down John's spine as he bit at his mouth and reached for the lube with the other hand.
"John, baby, you have to breathe." John wasn't sure if he was more surprised by the fact that Sherlock Fucking Holmes had just called him "baby" or if it was the fact that somehow, Sherlock had become the one knowledgeable in the ways of intercourse. Either way he turned around and kissed him, letting his tongue slide over his and moaning deep into his mouth. Now it was his turn for his erection to flag. But as soon as Sherlock relaxed into his kiss and started to stroke him again, it was back. John broke the kiss and rolled back over, pulled his knee up again and said "I'm ready. Take me, Sherlock."
Now both of them were sheened in sweat again, sliding together and moaning into each other's mouths, not kissing, just panting together, clutching eachother, rutting together like animals. John fell down on his elbows and buried his face in Sherlock's neck. He wasn't going to last, and he wanted this to last. Sherlock moaned and arched into John's touch. He was breathing faster and faster, speaking incoherently, John knew he was close too. He sat up immediately and removed his hands. Sherlock opened his eyes wide and made a grab to pull John back but John said "Wait." He breathed. "Just wait. I want to try something."
Its here. It's finally here.
"I came in here last night to check on you."
"I have to get ready for work," he replied and tried to grab the bag on his way past. Sherlock was already there. "Sherlock, stop!" He froze, about to open the bag. John reached out and took it from him. "I'm going to work. I'm taking this with me so don't even think about destroying my bedroom in your search." John pointed his finger at him and gave him his most serious "I mean it, Sherlock" look.
He thought back over every second of their friendship so far.  There were no signs of anything of this ridiculous nature forming inside him.  How had this happened?  John sat staring at Sherlock and Sherlock felt that blush creeping up his face again.  No.  No.  Sherlock Holmes does not do this. Sherlock Holmes does not feel attraction. Although, he would have to say that if he did have to feel it, someone as kind and caring and just plain old good as John would be his preference. Not to mention the fact that although Sherlock was often ignorant of beauty, he was not ignorant of John's. It wasn't so much the physical features of his new and only friend, but the way he held himself, the way he respected those around him in a way Sherlock never could.  Stop it! No! This sort of feeling is for ordinary people and why is John staring at you? Oh....you still haven't responded.
"It's for a case," Sherlock said again. John grinned and Sherlock, who had been returning to his natural shade, reddened again. "It isn't what you think." "I think you got a litle turned on last night and needed a wank." "John, I told you not to be so crass. Or repulsive. I would never 'wank' to that disgusting video."
They started to kiss again, properly this time, all tongues and saliva and open mouths and hot breaths, pressing into eachother over and over. Without breaking, Sherlock once again reached for the lube and this time he placed his hand between them, lifted John's leg, and poured it directly down his crack. John shuddered again but didn't complain about the cold this time. Sherlock reached down and slowly pressed his middle finger inside John's oh so tight passage. He broke the kiss long enough to say "Breathe, John." and went back in with his tongue. John realized he was probing his mouth with the same rhythm he was stroking into John, in and out, and John took up the same pattern with his breathing, in and out, in through his nose, out from his mouth. "That's good," Sherlock told him and he looked down between them to watch himself add a second finger. John breathed in and out as Sherlock began to twist and scissor his fingers deep inside him. John panted and gasped for air. It felt so good now. He wanted so badly to feel what it was like to have Sherlock press on his prostate. "Now crook your fingers," he said, realizing his voice was hoarse and cracked now.  Sherlock flicked his gaze up to his and did just that.
"They couldn't have used the window outside to get in." John commented, holding out his phone with its light on to shine on the darkest corner.
"You said it yourself, Sherlock. Just getting to be closer to you was reward enough before today happened."
"Yes," Sherlock whimpered, watching John's face as he approached his own climax. John's eyes were squeezed closed, his mouth hung open, and it was the most beautiful image Sherlock had ever seen. Sherlock tossed the pillow to the side and whispered, "Kiss me."
John slowly turned his head to look at Peter and Peter looked horrified. He met John's eyes and pleaded, "He was asleep! I-I thought h-he was asleep! That wasn't me, Cap'n, I swear!"
"Sherlock,
There was a short pause of silence before Sherlock cautiously asked, "What did you mean when you said 'again'?"
"When you turn sixteen, let me know." John dismissed, limping to his desk chair to grab his overshirt and coat. It was windy out and the island would provide little safety from the wind chill. "Now get." Peter huffed and closed the door, and John could hear his heavy footfalls as he walked away.
"No less?" Peter challenged. John begrudgingly nodded. Peter grinned cockily and held out a hand. "Deal." John shook it firmly, and when they let each other's hands go, Peter motioned to the paper. "So, what do you think? He had to hide it for a reason, right?"
"I suggest you answer my question. My ship, my rules."
"Let's search afterwards," John murmured to Sherlock. "The longer it's been since Oliver went 'missing', the longer the criminal has to get away."
Sherlock led Rosie through the task of making the solution to blow bubbles through an online flash game while John made his own concoction in his mug. He made a cup of tea for Sherlock as well, remembering how he liked his tea, and poured a little of Sherlock's into a smaller glass for Rosie. Whatever Sherlock or John ate or drank, Rosie wanted to try, and one of the few things she liked so far was Sherlock's favorite flavor of tea, just with more milk and sugar. John smiled, remembering how her face scrunched up one time when she dared to try John's straight black coffee.
"Oh, you're not." John smirked. "I give every prisoner with coin the same condition that I'm going to give you."
John turned toward the door to Lestrade's office once more.
"Ah." Sherlock hummed. "Still, no need to thank me. As you are fond of reminding me, sleep is necessary for proper bodily functioning, and 'sleeping in' is merely a social construct of-"
"Poor Ollie." She finally breathed, removing her hand from her face. The front door opened and the bell chimed, causing John and Isabelle to glance over. Isabelle continued, correctly thinking that the tall pale man that entered was with the kind doctor informing her about Oliver. "I've no idea where he got out, we checked everywhere."
"That's why you started using again when you came back. You started doing reckless things, like picking fights and letting yourself waste away on cocaine. Sherlock Holmes realized he was a mere mortal and it scared him."
"You know what's at the end of all this?" John prompted, patting the pocket where the letter was. Sherlock shook his head.
John's eyebrows shot up in surprise.
Oliver eyed his hand and cautiously took it, standing up. John smiled softly at him, let Oliver's hand go, and gingerly put a hand on his shoulder to steady Oliver as he led him out of the office. When Oliver saw the small group of officers standing just outside the office, he stopped and stared wide-eyed at them, stepping backwards into John. John gripped his shoulder firmly, his free hand reaching up to Oliver's elbow instinctively in case he tried to run away.
"Is that odd?" John asked, sensing something shifting in Oliver.
"I could have told you that." John joked, smirking softly. Sherlock rolled his eyes. "In all seriousness, I appreciate this newfound revelation. In fact..." John paused, wondering whether to continue the sentence. It wasn't like John, either, to say aloud 'such things'. He could sense Sherlock cautiously glancing over at him. It took him a few seconds, but he made up his mind. "Ever since you returned, I've noticed a change in you."
Sherlock immediately nodded, eyes still closed. John leaned down, his chest forcing Sherlock's knees to spread apart to allow him closer, and he pressed soft kisses over Sherlock's tensed face. As the detective let out a shaky breath and his brow relaxed, John trailed his kisses down Sherlock's cheek to his neck. The jolt of arousal left Sherlock's calves shaking, and wordlessly John reached back with a gentle hand and guided Sherlock's knee toward his back.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
Sherlock quickly forwarded the initial message to Lestrade, receiving a message from Mycroft in the process.
want."
"Yes, please. Earl Grey." Sherlock handed over the shirt and sighed, "I really liked that shirt, too."
"Exactly." Sherlock pointed at the walls of the basement, "and this basement is smaller than the building it is on top of. It's not unheard of, but-"
"I work alongside them." John told the half-truth and glanced at the unmarked door to his left, likely leading to the rest of the building. Before John could continue, the woman breathed,
"No-" John whispered and rushed over, setting his gun down on the floor beside Sherlock as Sherlock stepped back and leaned against the wall, clutching his side. John recognized the handle as a scalpel and he breathed a bit easier. It could be bad, but it definitely could've been worse.
"I want what I've always wanted since I left, John." Sherlock shifted his hand underneath John's so their hands could interlock. "I want to be here, with you, in whatever way that makes you comfortable."
tumbled out with it - and reached up to cradle John's jaw with one hand, his other still holding John's hand on the counter. He leaned down and pressed his lips to John's, inexperienced and unsure but passionate all the same. John's eyes closed and he let go of Sherlock's hand in favor of resting it around the curve of Sherlock's long neck. John could tell that Sherlock hadn't been lying all those years ago when he said that relationships weren't really his area of expertise, but John found it comforting more than anything else. He knew what to expect, and there was an odd sense of trust that came with it, especially after that confusing time where Sherlock was...
"Antipsychotics." Oliver said, for the first time with certainty. "Psychiatrist," he breathed, as if remembering something, "I have-" He shifted in the chair and felt for his back pocket, but realized something and looked down at his body. "What the...? My wallet's gone!"
"I dreamed that I was back in Afghanistan, in the middle of a firefight." John admitted. "I guess I thought of you and Rosie at some point because suddenly you both were there in the middle of all that mess and... Fucking hell." John wiped his face with his hands, trying to wipe away the tears before they even had the chance to form.
"What's scary, love?" John carried his daughter over to his end table and pulled a tissue out of a tissue box, wiping her nose and eyes.
John stepped toward Sherlock, swallowing down nervousness. "A sociopath wouldn't have faked his death to keep his friends alive."
"What's a nobleman doing on
"Don't get ahead of yourself." John folded up the piece of paper and tucked it into his coat's inner pocket underneath the cloak that draped over his left shoulder and arm. "You've got to make it to apprenticeship first."
Sherlock snorted. "You say that like
He rushed over and John lifted his good leg instinctively, letting the young kid dive underneath the table. He rested the heel of his leather boot on the wood floor and, with his good arm, draped the navy blue cloak that covered his bad left shoulder over his right leg, working as a makeshift curtain for the boy and a "blanket" for John. John tilted down the front of his black gambler hat to shield his face and leaned his head back against the wall, pretending to be asleep.
"Um yea, Mr. Weasley I can hear you just fine. You don't have to shout." John rubbed his ear.
is excellent. How is your curry?”
“No, why? I just picked it up from the labs like I usually do. Maybe it was just donated. The hospital did start a drive today as a matter of fact. But I have no idea who it was. If… if its not any good just..”
“No. I’m a consulting detective with a touch of extra qualities so to speak.”
"Right," He had hoped she would've elaborated further on where Sherlock had went, but given their previous encounter her was doubtful she would help. "Right….yes. Sorry where am I?"
John wondered how on earth he fared in his past life with his type of work. In some ways it amused him to see the normally calm and collected man be completely agitated over the fact he had to wait for his suspect. It seemed like patience was not a virtue of his. Though the more he observed him, the more his amusement died off and his skill for diagnosing came out. A empty half a pack of cigarettes, the pacing, the constant vigilance of the surrounding area, the way Sherlock pulled his coat tighter around him subconsciously. This wasn't a display of Sherlock’s lack of patience, this was anxiety. How could he be so blind? He was a PTSD sufferer himself he knew the signs.
“No, she is no vampire. In our respective roles she is playing as my landlady. When in truth she is my housekeeper. She lives on the floor below.”
"What about these suicides then, Sherlock?," Mrs. Hudson's voice broke the tension in the room as she brought in a newspaper. "I thought that'd be right up your street. Three exactly the same."
The sitting room had a wave of renewed life within it now. Darkness no longer bathed in every corner and crevice. Strange commodities of dead things framed behind glass would’ve gave the cold chill of dread to any if it were still night. However, in the lit room they no longer held such power. Now they were scientific fascinations decorating the mantle of the fireplace and shelves for all to see. Beetles, bats, botany of mushrooms and other fauna. They were life and death together in harmony. Glass jars and chemistry materials lined shelves in a display cabinet along with other knickknacks that even piqued John’s interest as he looked at them all. This no longer felt like the den of a vampire, but a flat of a detective who had an interest in the mechanics of life and science. He was about to go into the kitchen when he heard the shuffle of feet and turned to meet the figure of his new flatmate.
But for now enjoy the beginning of Season 2, as I am calling it, of our vampire story!
"Uh, yes," Startled by how the man knew he was a doctor. He had never mentioned it to Mrs. Hudson on the phone prior. "You must be Sherlock." He made his way into the sitting room and took a seat in red armchair that looked like it had seen better days.
say that.”
"Oh you'll have to experience it for yourself. Something quite extraordinary." Mr. Weasley said in excitement.
"Yes, where is it? She must have had a phone or an organizer. Find out who Rachel is."
An unexpected visitor causes some tension for Sherlock and John is going on his first blood hunt for a cranky vampire.
“Thanks.”
"Of the body. You're a medical man."
Even turned away from him, John could see Sherlock’s back instantly stiffen and he set down the mug with a little more force than what he meant to. As though the question itself had brought  a horrible thought to him.
Sherlock's eyes flashed over to John who was now getting up and stretching away the stiffness his body had created from sitting in his chair for the past five hours.
John blinked up in surprise.
“Ever the observant one, John. You need facts before you make theories, instead of twisting theories to suit facts. That is why I changed it.”
"Four." Sherlock's face reflected the red and blue glow of lights coming from outside. "There's been a fourth. And there's something different this time."
Mike patted himself down but turned up empty handed "Sorry. It's in my coat."
“Good! Your hat and boots. We have about an hour’s drive outside the city.”
The detective remained quiet. His silence speaking volumes.
John thought to himself.
“Needs must when the devil drives, Watson.” That was all his words took to get Watson to follow him, hurrying down the stairs.
“I won’t bother you if that’s what you are worried about. I’m quite busy tonight and I promise you won’t hear a peep out of me.”
John nodded and mulled over his words.
“ ‘Miss me?’,” John’s brows knitted together in confusion as he handed back the paper and Sherlock tucked it into his coat pocket. “Sounds like they’ve done this before.”
"Chaos?"John answered.
“Oh Lord, now he has a colleague. How did we get so lucky?” Her tone turning to the sarcastic side as she put her walkie talkie to her face. “Freak and company are here.”
**Magnifique—Magnificent**
“Work. Why what’s wrong with it? Is it no good?”
"That's fantastic!" came John's praise.
"Marvelous Mrs. Hudson. Just telling Dr. Watson about my work."
"A terrorist cell of all things. No wonder the Ministry didn't know. They barely correlate with Muggle politics they wouldn't know. They haven't been on good terms for years. And he solved it in a day. And what are "deductions"?" His mind reeled.
"Is that it?" John interjected, not satisfied with his answer. He wasn't going to let him just hop out the door and not answer how he thought John was just going to be his flatmate and move in and for God's sake how in the hell did he know about the middle east?!
“Definitely not. I ensured it.”
“Sure, coffee. Coffee sounds lovely.”
"Good man let me put your mind at rest. I'm a consulting detective. You have nothing to worry about."
Oh. Oh. So it was something more primal. Something out of his nature that he had barely any control over. Of course not. John had only seen a mere scratch of the surface when they were in the parking garage months ago. Sherlock had been on edge during that stake out, but from what he could remember he had just fed that previous day. He knew he hadn’t been hungry. But Sherlock said he knew John was about to be attacked. That must’ve been the trigger to have tipped him over the edge.
He decided to unwind his nerves by walking to the address the detective had given him yesterday instead of Apparating there. No need to be waiting around on edge for this little interview with him, personally, this time. Who knows, perhaps it wouldn't take long. Once he figured out how this uncouth man possessed his unnatural ability to read people's life story like a book he could be Obiliviated. Simple as that.
December 20th, 1894
“Good. Makes for unnecessary chit chat.” He picked up John’s briefcase and put it back in the doctor’s hands. “Now, come in.” Sherlock re-entered the flat, leaving John to stand there.
"And an ex-soldier?" he raised an eye brow up to him.
This time John’s body stilled and the wavering perfume of fear was beginning to make itself known in sweat and perspiration. John was afraid.
John must have been on the brunt end of Sherlock’s cryptic conversations for the day. He hated to admit that sometimes if not most, he felt out of the loop whenever the detective was on a case. This meant being in a constant lost in translation. As in Sherlock would expect him to know what he was talking about and he would have absolutely no clue.
“I hope.” John said softly.
Though first things first. He would have to make it through the night.
"No, she never got to the hotel." Sherlock disputed "Look at her hair. She color coordinates her lipstick and her shoes. She'd never have left any hotel with her hair still looking ..." All of a sudden Sherlock's eyes went wide, exclaiming an "oh" from his mouth as he clapped his hands together at his epiphany.
A sly smile graced Sherlock's lips as he took a sip of tea.
“Those things will kill you, you know.” said John trying to defuse the tension.
"Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase? Was there a suitcase in this house?!"
“John.”
John’s feet felt planted to the floor with his stare as he bore into him. He felt urges to look away but try as he might, he couldn’t leave his face. He had been taught to be still and at attention when the time needed in the military and this felt like one of those moments.
“What, you’re probably hundreds of years old. You must have more medical knowledge than all of Bart’s Hospital put together and then some.”
Mrs. Hudson’s features changed in understanding.
Well Mycroft was going to have to wait. A doctor couldn’t just abandon his patients to be summoned upon to have a chat or shooed into another black car waiting by the curb. He was going to have to wait his turn. Because right now all John needed to do was just breathe. Breathe and not think of war.
Sherlock shook his head in disbelief.
Sincerely, Your Dearly Demented Author
“You sure you can’t brainwash people?”
“You look fine.”
"All I have to say John is you will just have to see for yourself." He stopped at a door labeled 'LABORATORY'. "Just act casual. Your an old friend of mine visiting me. I'm just showing you around the hospital."
Sorry for the small absence. Work has been crazy and I am still trying to get over the side effects of the second dose of the Covid vaccine. It truly kicked my butt. But I'm on the road to feeling better.
“I see. Of course the victims were transferred to nearby hospitals. Yours being one of them.” Sherlock shook his head as if mentally scolding himself. “Well then this might be a slight problem as neither of us calculated this outcome to our day.”
Sherlock... He had really changed after Mary died, and even more now that John and Rosie were living in 221b with him. John wasn't sure whether to say it was for better or for-
"Christ, Sherlock - Knock next time?" John breathed with exasperation, rubbing his eyes with one hand while the other found his waist. Sherlock opened his mouth, paused, then spoke:
"Well, it's reassuring to have you two on the case." She said at a normal volume. Sherlock slowly stood and looked at John, noticing an odd pinkish hue to his face. Isabelle smiled at both of them. "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
"I can't hide anything from you, can I?" John teased, looking over his shoulder at the similarly bare-chested detective behind him. Sherlock rubbed his hand over John's right shoulder and down his side, pressing a chaste kiss to the back of John's neck.
"Where am I?" The man said in a shaking tone of voice, sitting up and pressing his back against the wall, using his arms to brace himself. "Who are you?"
John smirked softly, seeing the abrasive bit of himself in his daughter's behavior that Sherlock had mentioned. John glanced at Sherlock and said, "I'll help her. We'll meet you downstairs." There was a hint of something in John's eyes that told Sherlock that John had something he wanted to mention, something about Sherlock, but John turned and followed Rosie to help her turn the faucet on and reach the sink. Sherlock hummed in mild acknowledgement and curiosity before he left, closing the door behind him. He went downstairs and resumed his position at the kitchen table, his laptop left open from when he noticed the time and went up the stairs to perform his 'thoughtful' deed.
"Lock!"
Sherlock looked at John softly, his heart aching. John didn't have to finish explaining his dream for Sherlock to understand what had happened to them both. It explained why John was shell-shocked when they sat out here in the living room that night with Rosie, calming her down. Sherlock had incorrectly assumed that the subject of his dream had been Rosie, not both Rosie and Sherlock. Now that he understood, he felt the urge to comfort John somehow. Admittedly, that surprised Sherlock. Sherlock wasn't known to be a comforting personality, yet he was willing to try and likely fail if it meant that John would be comforted.
"There's something else there." Sherlock interrupted, agreeing with John. His lips tightened into a thin line. "Something hidden behind the illness, locked away in his head."
"No need."
Oliver grimaces and grabs his head, growling lowly, "Shut up shut up shut
John nodded slowly, starting to understand. "Was?" He repeated. Sherlock nodded, avoiding John's eyes. "So he's dead." Sherlock gritted his teeth and nodded again. Silence filled the air, and John contemplated what to do next. "Any chance you know the island?"
John sighed heavily, a tinge of a growl at the end of it, and Sherlock cautiously glanced over. John was utterly furious, jaw clenched and glaring across the room at the unlit fireplace.
"'His doctor'?" Isabelle repeated then lowered her voice. Sherlock could hear the floor creak slightly as she shifted closer to whisper to John. "As in
There was a few seconds of pause before John said, "You got injured, didn't you?"
"Rest your legs on my back. No, bit lower. You're not climbing a tree, love." John jokingly teased when Sherlock wrapped his long legs around the middle of John's back. "
"I'm going to get dressed for bed." John said aloud and walked over to the dresser beside Sherlock's armoire in the corner of the room. He started to pull his jumper over his head, and continued once he was pulling his arms out of the sleeves. "And no, before you start whinging, I've not forgotten about our deal."
"I didn't realize that you had considered my changing at great length."
"You could always flirt," Sherlock absently suggested, moving further down the alley. "Although the idea of entering the building while you've been shagging the receptionist-"
Sherlock and John leave New Scotland Yard and head out to follow Oliver's path back to where he escaped from.
There was a slight pause. Sherlock whispered cautiously, "I was?" John swallowed and nodded.
"I know, but you've got to focus on mine. I'm going to help you, but you've got to help me, too." John swallows, teeth clenching as he chooses his question and its wording carefully. "Do you remember where you live? Is there anyone we can call for you?"
John wondered if Sherlock knew he had been in his nightmare, too.
negatively, his romantic, Three-Continents-Watson confidence was returning. The teasing smile faded from Sherlock's face, and John witnessed something that he'd never seen Sherlock's body do before. Sherlock's pupils flared.
"He always wants to talk." The man grasps Lestrade's rolling chair at the base and snarls, "Talk talk talk."
"That's where we store the medicine." Isabelle answered. "If you've got any questions, I'll be upstairs checking on the patients. They're about to leave lunch right now."
Watson studied the boy, who admittedly was almost close to crying, then looked back at Sherlock.
"Earlier I told you my name. Do you remember it?" John watched the man's face closely, looking for some uncertainty or a forgetfulness that might give himself and the two men watching outside some narrowing information.
"This is where we keep the patients' belongings that can't stay with them in their room." She gestured to the shelves sticking out from the wall beside the door. "Mostly sharp things, metal, anything they could use to harm themselves or others."
His heart stilled when John sat back down and leaned closer to Sherlock. John let out a soft gasp of horror and Sherlock squeezed his eyes closed, his whole body tensing with anxiety. Why did he care so much about what John thought of him? Why did he care about John seeing his scars, seeing his body? It was stupid, stupid stupid-
"You are such a sweetheart, you know that?" Rosie giggled and John carried her over to the bag of brightly colored books that Ms. Hudson had left by John's armchair. "Why don't we see what books you got with Ms. Hudson?"
"You go." Sherlock waved a hand as if to bat the idea away. "Testimonies are weak, people are liars, and besides," Sherlock started to walk down the alley at a slow pace, scanning the ground and walls for abnormalities, "you're better with people anyways."
"How are you doing?" He asked, putting his hand on top of Sherlock's on his side. Sherlock swallowed and John tried not to think about how oddly intimate the situation was.
John sighed as he closed the door to Lestrade's office. He didn't bother to lock it; Oliver was unresponsive once more, battling whatever demons he had in his head.
"Yes, yes I do."
"Are you friends with your patients?" Sherlock interrupted John, who looked at him curiously. Isabelle smiled sheepishly.
Just a warning here. If the word "rape" triggers you, you should probably stop reading. There will be no graphic details involving it, though, so if the word itself doesn't bother you, then you should be good.
enough."
"The rat." The man slowly rises until he can slither into Lestrade's seat, looking at John from over the back of it with his knees planted into the cushioned seat. John cocks his head with interest.
"I could leave the stab would," Sherlock let out a content sigh, mumbling, "but otherwise this is how it was supposed to be."
"Rosamund..." He said in a warning, this-is-not-debatable tone. She whimpered in frustration and stomped off to the bathroom again, scowling. "I suppose today is dedicated to the Watson's interrupting me."
Much like they just had done, the two kissed and caressed for a few long moments before continuing to undress. They took their time with each other, learning and exploring, even sharing stories. Sherlock noticed the little scars and marks left in John's skin that hid beneath his undershirts during the night and his jumpers during the day, and John told the stories he could remember that accompanied them. Most of them were from the war: grenade debris, a bullet grazing, some small burn marks from hot metal casings that got underneath his clothing somehow. But a couple came from studying at Bart's, such as a shimmering white line across his bicep and a larger, jagged line along his forearm. John explained that the first was a pocketknife that a drug addict pulled on him while on shift, and the second was received while treating a patient that had been impaled through the hip by a piece of metal during a car crash. Sherlock was fascinated - it was as if he was studying the wounds of a victim during a case, but the story was more personal and intriguing because it was John. It was a part of John's story that Sherlock hadn't been there to experience alongside the soldier.
Sherlock let out a yelp when John wrapped his hands under Sherlock's knees, lifted, and shoved, all in one movement, causing Sherlock to fall back onto the mattress and slide toward the center of it. John then twisted and straddled Sherlock's thighs, putting his weight on them, and Sherlock stared up at him wide eyed.
"And that is?"
"Sometimes, yes." He brushed Rosie's blonde hair away from her face. "What are some things you could think about to make you happy before you sleep?"
"There's also Dr. Stone..."
"Fu..." John choked out, burying himself into Sherlock's body and clutching onto Sherlock's hip. After a couple seconds his lungs began to work again and he huffed out a heavy pant. Sherlock peppered kisses all over John's face.
"Will you help me? I already know a lot of words!" Peter asked hopefully.
The kiss was sweet and spiked with lust, making for a dangerously addictive combination. As the smile faded from John's preoccupied lips, his hands found Sherlock's thighs and pushed on the back of them, pining them at the detective's chest. John let go of one to grab a pillow and force it underneath Sherlock's hips, pulling away to see what he was doing. The detective watched with hungry eyes, lifting his hips for the doctor. John patted Sherlock's thigh once he was done adjusting the pillow and Sherlock lowered his hips, rocking them to flatten out the pillow a bit. John grabbed the lubricant and poured some onto his palm, coating himself generously and setting the lube off to one side.
Most of Sherlock's scars, John noticed, had been patched by John himself. Only a few barely visible, fading scars from childhood exploration and the harsh scars on Sherlock's back had not been directly treated by John. There was a sense of pride knowing that John had taken care of Sherlock so many times, despite everything that had happened since they met. Sherlock could pull himself apart so many times, but John would always be there to put the detective back together.
"That's what they say, yes." John nodded, leaning on his cane. "You're right to be weary."
"What does it tell you to do?"
"Hurry up, John." Sherlock demanded, shifting his weight on his knees in an attempt to get more comfortable. John took it as Sherlock shaking his arse impatiently, and admittedly he wasn't too far off.
Sorry it's taken so long to finally finish this fanfiction! I had my own mental roadblocks to go through before I was ready and willing. I hope the wait was worth it, though. Thank you for reading!
"One day I'll have to lop your legs off at the knee to make you short enough for me to carry."
"Just because you're doped up doesn't mean you're invincible, Holmes." John chided him as they ascended the stairs. Sherlock wasn't exactly sure when they had started the climb, but judging by their speed and John's nagging it had likely been no more than a minute ago. Their coats were gone as well. How had he not noticed John taking his coat off? Morphine was certainly an annoying, but effective, opiate.
"Lockie!" Rosie cheered and ran toward Sherlock sitting in his chair. Sherlock twisted and reached out just in time to catch her as she tripped on her blanket.
"What?" John prompted, confused. Sherlock knew what it had been like when John lost Mary, so John didn't understand what Sherlock meant.
"But why?" Sherlock hummed, finishing John's thought. John sighed. "Come along, John. We've got somewhere to be."
Finally looking down at the piece of paper Peter handed him, John studied what was written. The words on the page were hand written, and at first they didn't make much sense, but the longer John looked it over the more he noticed a pattern. Peter was watching him intently, lips slightly parted in a smile. John glanced over and offered the boy a nod of approval.
"Mm, I apologize," Sherlock answered thoughtlessly, reaching for the drawer and fishing out the paper that laid on top of the rest, "I've been told it's annoying."
sure, but he
Sherlock was in the middle of sending the code word to Lestrade from his phone while John watched the suspect, gun drawn and pointed at him.
"What happened, Sherlock?" John whispered, moving to sit down on the couch next to his friend. He glanced down at Sherlock's hands tensing around Sherlock's kneecaps, then slowly looked up to study Sherlock's profile. "Where is...?"
"It appears you've decided on a course of action." Sherlock mused, causing John to remember what he'd said just before Ms. Hudson and Rosie interrupted them.
"That I noticed the change?" John supplied, bracing himself for some sort of biting remark from Sherlock. "Or that-"
"Sherlock," John started, and the man hummed absently, "As much as I'd love to sit here waiting for you to solve a case several hundred kilometers away-"
Sherlock turned around and walked off, and John followed behind him. Sherlock texted  Lestrade as he walked, expertly maneuvering around walking officers and cubicles.
"The rat will kill you?" John asks, pushing himself off the wall to stand freely. The man nods, and John nods slowly, taking in the information. "Is it alright if I sit across from you?" The man eyes one of the two armchairs placed a few feet away in front of Lestrade's desk, and his lips tighten into a thin line. He gives a sharp nod, not once taking his eye off John as John follows the wall and then tugs the chair a little further back and sits down.
"Maybe he left you a parting gift." John supplied, standing up slowly and with a grunt of effort. He gestured to Peter, "Fetch the keys, lad."
Sherlock blinked, his eyes focusing on the present surroundings once more. John was standing at the edge of the bed with a grin on his face, and the tiny black strings that had been in a neat pile beside Sherlock on the bed were gone.
John chuckled, dropping the jumper in the clothes hamper. "I won't, I swear."
"I'll keep interrupting you to a one-on-one basis, then."
"Dreams aren't something to be afraid of, cuppa." John reassured. "For every bad dream you have, you'll have lots of really good dreams to make you forget them."
want to be...?"
"My bones are intact, so no." Sherlock replied. John rolled his eyes.
a bit bigger than average, but Sherlock was already groaning with impatience and John couldn't find himself disagreeing with the detective, so instead of adding another finger he opted to speed up the process and just be more careful.
"My legs work perfectly fine, John." Sherlock countered, turning back around. He walked toward the fridge slowly, a hand over his bandage, and John was faced with a complete view of Sherlock's scarred back. His irritation at Sherlock moving about instead of asking John for help faded instantly, and he stared at Sherlock's back as Sherlock opened the fridge door and grabbed the wrapped food that Ms. Hudson had saved for him.
"Dadda."
"If you ever see that man," John fumed, "just point him out to me."
? And people called Sherlock odd.
as the practicing psychiatrist listed beneath the name of the three-story building. Sherlock narrowed his eyes and looked down the alley next to the building. Oliver's story was valid, so far.
Together they went up to the captain's quarters. John opened the door and gestured for them to enter. Peter hesitated.
"You didn't wash your hands." Sherlock deduced and told her, firm but not mean. John knew this was the case, but must have had an odd look about him that made Sherlock question it when he glanced at John. He focused on Rosie after a second of glancing at John. "Go wash your hands, please."
"Hmm?" Sherlock hummed and put his hand on the door handle before glancing over at John.
"Alright, get comfy." John told Sherlock, removing his fingers. Eagerly, Sherlock flopped onto his back, spreading his legs for John. John couldn't help but smile and slip into place between Sherlock's thighs, leaning over the detective's torso to kiss him.
"What about whatevers at the end of this?" One of the crew members pried, frowning with annoyed eyes.
"I..." Oliver swallowed thickly, his eyes stopping at the window. He stared, and John glanced over to see that he was meeting Sherlock's steeled gaze.
"Oh. Good. So... you were staring at me now for the same reason that you had stared at me when I asked you to be my best man... correct? It wasn't that you were-"
"Do you remember making any turns?" John supplied, and after a moment Oliver shook his head. He quickly met Sherlock's gaze and added,
"I..." Oliver paused, his gaze falling from Sherlock's eyes to Lestrade's desk. John noticed that his grip was loosening on Lestrade's armchair. "I remember... running? Down the street. No, down an alley. Then down a street. I remember the police cars parked on the side of the building."
Rosie waddled off toward the television where the rest of her stuffed toys lay on the floor, and Sherlock murmured to John, "It appears I'm being offered sacrifices."
"And this door?" Sherlock murmured, staring at a padlocked metal door painted a light blue.
Sherlock chuckled softly, watching and catching the different toys Rosie brought him while John applied antibacterial ointment to the line of stitches, placed a pad of non-stick gauze on top, then taped down the edges with medical tape. By the time he was done, a pile of stuffed animals had formed on the couch next to Sherlock. John noticed it and laughed, looking over at Rosie as she waddled off in search of more toys. He followed her and picked her up, kissing her cheek.
"After all..." John pulled the note out of his pocket, looked at it, then held it out so Sherlock could grab it through the bars, "Your note."
"Search the walls and the floor. There has to be a way in somewhere."
"'Rest of my time here'?" He repeated, glaring at John.
Rosie thought for a couple seconds then chose to point at the stitches, instead of reaching again. "Booboo?"
"How could they report it
"Uh..." Oliver rubbed his hands over the knees of his sweatpants. "W-We had a meeting. A support group meeting. Doctor Stone's assistant led it, her name's Isabelle. She's really sweet - she makes sure Lane gets his chair and she helps calm Audrey when she has a panic attack."
"Why not?" He questioned, slowly continuing to undo the buttons of his shirt. Sherlock's cheeks turned pink as he thought of what to respond with.
"Thank you again, Ms. Hudson." John told her, setting the book down on the couch and holding Rosie as he stood up.
A coherent Oliver answers Sherlock's questions, and John discovers some shocking things when giving Oliver a medical examination.
he'd gone and what had happened after The Fall.
"I appreciate the consideration for my web history," John teased, shifting his weight to lay partially on Sherlock take some pressure off of his shoulder, "and for us, of course. I have my own experience and medical education, but being with another man is new to me, too."
Peter cautiously went over to the door and peeked out, looking for the man, then closed the door and jogged back over to John. He sat down next to John at the table, and John raised an eyebrow and adjusted his gambler.
"I was making sure." John corrected, giving Sherlock a look. "You get testy when someone tries to help you."
His eyes trailed over Sherlock's almost bare body, a breath escaping his lips, "Christ." Sherlock blushed.
"I've got to teach the adults here not to send a child to pass on important information." John patted Peter on the shoulder, rustling the brown hair on the back on his head, then turned away.
Sherlock stood and dropped Rosie's blanket beside her on the floor, then took off toward the door. He grabbed his coat and raced down the stairs to knock on Ms. Hudson's door, but she was already exiting her flat and turning to look up the stairs when he was about halfway down.
"I've been here the whole time." Sherlock countered. "Well, most of the time. I suppose some waiting may have been involved, but I wouldn't classify it as 'long'." John playfully thwacked Sherlock's uninjured side with a flick of his fingers.
"Do you have a therapist, psychiatrist, anyone we can call for you? Are you on any medications?"
"Your welcome, cuppa." John kissed the top of her head then grabbed the newspaper from next to Sherlock's laptop, walking around the side of the table to sit across from them. John read the front page and his eyebrows raised. "Sherlock?"
"I wasn't aware you were a psychologist." Sherlock teased lightly, trying to distract himself from how close John was. He could feel whispers of John's breath on his chest. At his teasing, John seemed to ease somewhat, and his hand on Sherlock's relaxed.
"Well, I figured out what the traumatic event, was." John sighed, his jaw clenching. Sherlock frowned and looked through the one-way mirror into the interrogation room. There were two officers talking to Oliver, who seemed surprisingly calm considering John wasn't in the room, and a plastic kit was left on the table. Sherlock understood from the officers' body language what John had found just as John spoke.
"Not unless you murdered Mr. Trevor." Sherlock replied, watching the boy closely. Peter shook his head adamantly. "Then your illegal occupation doesn't concern me."
John glanced over and noticed Sherlock sleeping while Rosie poked a felt-covered lamb on the cover of the pop-up book on his lap. The corner of John's mouth turned upwards in a small smile, bordering on a smirk. Morphine was one way of getting Sherlock to rest, John guessed. He went back to talking to Rosie and looking with her at her different books, and they were halfway through one of them when Ms. Hudson popped her head in to say, "Dinner's ready, boys," she smiled at Rosie, "and girl, of course."
The message directed the reader to a particular latitude and longitude, which meant the hardest part was over with. John found the correct place on the globe, noticing that it was an island about half the size of London. It's shape didn't have many unique features, which proved annoying but not impossible. After studying the shape, the island's location compared to the nearest landmasses, and comparing it all to his map table for a long while, John made an educated guess and circled it with a piece of charcoal.
you are." John took a few steps closer, leaned on his good leg, and lifted his cane to point at the man, easily within arm's reach.
"I could tell there was something you wanted to say," Sherlock said in a soft breath, still a bit in shock at John's confession, "but I didn't realize-"
Sherlock frowned, confused. "Why?"
"So many," Oliver whimpers softly, "There's so many."
The man scowled, staring at the note in John's hands. His jaw clenched, his Adam's apple bobbed with the movement of him swallowing, and he sighed heavily after a long moment.
"Uh, well, there's me, of course."
John gave Sherlock a pointed look and rolled his eyes. "No, you twit. For
"Yes, please-"
"Smart man." John praised. He limped over to a wooden stool placed against the wall of the ship's hull and he dragged it closer, back to where he had been standing before.
"I can write a list of names, if you want." Isabelle glanced between John and the unfamiliar figure next to him, wondering why the man was looking her over with darting eyes.
"Well, there was Lane and Audrey, of course. Plus Isabelle, Doctor Stone's assistant. Lizzy, the anorexic girl." Oliver leaned back in his plastic chair and stared up at the ceiling. He mumbled through the list of names again and licked his lips in concentration. "Um... I think that's it? There might have been an orderly there, but I'm not sure."
"This is much better." Sherlock hummed. John looked over, seeing his lanky flatmate slouching against the back of the couch with his head propped on top of the couch cushion.
Grinning sinfully, John thrusted into Sherlock harder, slowing his pace down just slightly, and he growled into Sherlock's ear, "I can't wait for the day that no one is home but us. You're gonna be hoarse by the time we're done."
Sherlock had to use all his willpower to tug on his arm sleeve, a simple gesture that he knew John would interpret correctly. John hesitated, looking at Sherlock questioningly, and when Sherlock didn't change his mind John stood up and helped Sherlock pull his arms out of his sleeves. The cloth fell between Sherlock's back and the couch, and Sherlock swallowed thickly, his heart beating harder. He sat up a bit straighter when John pulled the shirt out from behind him.
"I'd do it again, too." John glared at him, stood up, and tucked the I.D. into his jeans pocket. With a moment to spare he chose to text Lestrade the code word for whenever Sherlock (or John himself) needed medical services that John couldn't handle purely with first aid.
John quickly searched the room and, thankfully, by the time he was glancing around hoping to find something to bound the man with, he could hear sirens in the distance. He looked over at Sherlock, glanced down at the man who was pale from blood loss, and jogged past him and over to Sherlock. The man wasn't going to get anywhere anytime soon, John reasoned. Besides, Sherlock was more important.
Peter nodded solemnly, "Yes sir."
"Patient?" Sherlock finished for her. Isabelle glanced over at him and solemnly nodded.
"Go on, boy." John nodded toward the room, and Peter eyed him with uncertainty. "You're not in trouble."
," John met Sherlock's eyes and held him close with his hand on Sherlock's side, being sure to keep pressure away from his wound, "want to kiss you?"
"Try me." John shot back.
Rosie mumbled incoherently in teary toddler talk, and John struggled to make out any words. He rubbed her back, hoping to calm her enough so she could speak a bit clearer, when he made out the word
"God, stop talking." John shuddered and walked off, flustered and disgusted by the mental image in his mind. He missed the mischievous smirk on Sherlock's face, whom was pleased that he got his doctor to finally leave him unattended to search for evidence. Admittedly, Sherlock had to suppress his own disgust at the concept as well.
John's sentence trailed off, but Sherlock knew what he was asking. They both knew that John, if given the chance, could deduce what had caused Sherlock's scars. They were distinctive, unique to the shape of a whip's lashing strike. Sherlock wondered if he could stall, somehow, but he knew John wouldn't let him even try, now. Besides, he would see the scars as soon as Sherlock's shirt was off.
"The 'dumb bastard' was probably killed in that chair, Peter." John chided the boy. Peter shrugged. "Tease the living all you want but respect the dead."
John planted his free hand next to Sherlock's head and leaned down, pressing his lips firmly against Sherlock's to shut him up. The kiss was rough and unlike any of their kisses prior; it held a heat and passion to it that John had been keeping under wraps since the start of their newly-founded relationship. He had been worried to go further than kissing and touching with Sherlock because the detective was inexperienced, which could cause Sherlock to panic if John didn't give him time to adapt. However, it meant that beneath his calm exterior lurked a pool of repressed sexual tension. While expressing this tension could lead to a panicked Sherlock, if it meant that he'd shut up for a few moments and stay still, John was willing to take the risk.
"Not bad, Pete. You were right." John praised. "I suggest you keep out of trouble, though. 'Least for now. Rather not have the Queen's men beat us to wherever this leads."
"White walls," Oliver starts to mumble aimlessly, "white ceiling, white jacket, white white white-" Oliver grips the arm of Lestrade's chair and rocks gently, causing him to slowly turn in place as his speech becomes incoherent. John frowns and watches him for a couple of minutes and wondering where to go from here. With a soft sigh he stands up with a grunt and quietly leaves the room.
"On the phone with Lestrade, still." Sherlock sighed. Ms. Hudson smirked slightly - Sherlock wasn't entirely sure why.
"What if I really,
." Sherlock immediately replied. "That would be while I was dismantling Moriarty's organization. When your life depends on how fast you move you learn to do things quicker, as I'm sure you're personally aware. You know, being a soldier and all." He opened the door and glanced at John, being met with an odd look. Suddenly Sherlock remembered that he had never told John about
"I love you, too." John rumbled in a husky voice. "You'll want to shower, by the way."
"... Okay." Molly said meekly and turned and went out the door.
Sherlock set down his cup and saucer on the side table and conjoined his fingers in an elegant manner in front of him.
"She could have checked into a hotel, left her case there." John was trying to put out any second thoughts into Sherlock's head. He was going to have to play him for time if he was going to call up the Auror's to find the suitcase first. No way he was letting this muggle getting his hands on it.
"It's murder, all of them. I don't know how, but they're not suicides, they're killings – serial killings. We've got ourselves a serial killer. I
“Very well. Then welcome home Dr. Watson.”
"What, she's one of the suicides? The fourth ...?"
“Hurry along Graham, I’ll be behind in a taxi. There is something I must discuss with the doctor for a few minutes.”
"He's with me." His answer was clipped as he took off his black leather gloves.
John had barely shrugged off his coat when he had heard Sherlock’s newest announcement.
“But how does it all work? How do you walk around in broad daylight?” John asked as he switched off the television now fully invested in the conversation.
“Don’t think too hard on this. Don’t let this case consume you.” Watson caressed his hand against Holmes’s cheek.
“How?” John asked.
But there was more to her than just that. She reminded him in some ways of the strange vampire that resided in his flat, being out of place with her personality, but at least she was with the current times. There were days John felt he was talking more with his grandfather when he was helping Sherlock with a case on his days off. Even though it made the detective interesting to listen to it could be tiring as well. John couldn’t count how many times he had to explain how certain things worked because Sherlock didn’t know. John could understand his frustration to some degree, but it didn’t help when your flatmate was considerably older than you were, yet looked younger.
“John. Listen to me! Move! Go home!” Sherlock urged more strongly.
“You mean no mind controlling? Powers of seduction to lure victims to their impending doom? Climb up walls, aversions to crosses, allergic to garlic, sleep in a coffin or…change into a bat?” John spouted off.
okay?
"Oh fuck me."
“A friendly chat never hurt anyone. I assure you will arrive at Baker Street unharmed.”
“An irregular? What other secrets haven’t you told me?”
“How long have you known?” The sergeant questioned further.
"They say he did it with "deductions"."
Before the doctor could open the door to exit the cab the detective placed his gloved hand over his, pausing his movements on the handle.
Sherlock invites John out on a case, but of course things don't go as planned
John picked up the mobile phone given to him and he scrolled through the contact list and pressed a number, waiting as it rang on the other end.
He knew John was starting to feel uneasy about him. Of course he was, he was once a soldier, trained to be observant in times of danger. And he couldn’t say that he blamed him. The vampire’s thoughts had grown dark as of late. His once balanced mind was being thrown off into a skelter. It was the creature that he was that plagued him every moment of every day. The longer he went without blood the more thirsty he became. His tongue felt too thick, his throat dry with a burning sensation for lack of fluids, and a constant urge to bite.
“I surmise.”
“Pity you didn’t arrive sooner. We could’ve all had breakfast together, like family.” The drawled out voice of Mycroft filled the room as they approached him.
Honestly he should’ve thought of this sooner instead of letting this madness going on for so long. Yes, the hospital was receiving blood in the labs, all ready for another transfusion if needed be, but they were constantly going out as fast as they were coming in. Which led to the hospital’s newest solution that they came up with today and that was to hold a local blood drive for the victims of the terrorist attack on the tube. Once John saw all the setup he didn’t think twice about pickpocketing a IV kit and stealing other supplies, whisking it all away and setting up his own donation in an unoccupied consultation room.
He stood and in a brief stride took the phone from John, flipping out the keyboard , typing away.
embarrassed.” Sherlock flustered.
"Ah, Mr. Holmes." John reached out and shook his hand.
John nodded.
“Sheer will more or less. Have you ever been addicted to something or craved something you just had to have? Let’s say your craving is a beer at the pub you enjoy. Say one night you go for a drink and that drink is so satisfying you have to have another. So the next night you go again. Then again and again and again and so on. Its not because you are thirsty. Its because you
His cane clicked as he followed her inside.
John could have swore he saw a spring to the young muggle's step as he just insulted these two people to the highest level. Even he couldn't help but find it funny as well. He followed behind and gave a quick peek to the sergeant's legs to see that all he had said, was in fact, true.
"Cream, no sugar." He tried to keep his voice steady despite his nervousness.
“Before. I started smoking after I left home for university. I was a connoisseur of tobacco back then. I do believe I have smoked just about anything and everything ranging from pipe tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes. Hard habit to discontinue after awhile.”
“It is bad enough that I am the way that I am. I would like to appear as normal as possible.”
“How so?”
John briefly glanced to his watch to check the time. His shift had ended ten minutes ago and he knew if he was going to do this he was going to have to get a move on. Sherlock may have been a detective for the past hundred years or so, but that only meant he was more meticulous in his ways. This meant that not only was he talented in moving in a complete stranger off the street, but it also meant he knew John’s work schedule too, down to the last minute. He knew when he arrived to work, went on break, clocked out for work, the bus route, traffic times, and walking distance. Anything and everything, the detective knew the slightest misstep or inconvenience if John should arrive home late.
“Why were you so frightened? Nothing so far has justified your assault on my decanter, and why have you allowed a dead woman to be placed under arrest?”
“Oh, thank you!,” Her face lit up at the mentioning of her cooking. “But just this once. I’m not your housekeeper.”
“He must’ve thought he was triggering my PTSD and relieved when I didn’t have a reaction.” John mulled as he slid his jacket back on and went after the detective who was waiting for him by the kerb. With simple ease Sherlock raised his hand and hailed down a cab and soon they were off.
Sherlock's ears were stock forward, attentive and his eyes narrowed. Then he let go of a laugh, letting his sharp canines freely show.
John looked back to the detective and he could almost hear his heart breaking for him. He wouldn’t admit to him that he had grown up in a prejudiced household where he was never allowed to interact with Felisian's, have them as friends, or even go to school with them. He had heard the racial slurs, the nasty assumptions and opinions his parents made. He had always hated it.
be a cousin, but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live. Unlikely you've got an extended family, certainly not one you're close to, so brother it is. Now, Ginny. Who's Ginny? Three kisses says it's a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend. She must have given it to him recently – this model's only six months old. Marriage in trouble then, six months on he's just given it away. If she'd left him, he'd have kept it. People do; sentiment. But no, he wanted rid of it. He left her. He gave the phone to you: that says he wants you to stay in touch. You're looking for cheap accommodation, but you're not going to your brother for help: that says you've got problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife; maybe you don't like his drinking."
"That's right! Like Magnum P.I.!," she chuckled to herself and looked over at John. "Are you going to be Jonathon Quail Higgins?"
Sherlock dropped the butt of the cigarette on the ground and snuffed it out with his shoe.
"Ooh, and I think it just vaporized. May I go in?"
There was no point in arguing with Sherlock about how he had just packed up his life and brought his things here. He agreed to this and now here he was. Suddenly the warmth of the bath no longer felt inviting but more of just another psychological motive on Sherlock’s part. Take a warm bath, relax, and welcome to your new home. That’s all this screamed. Calm your victim. Make them more compliant.
make some sort of threat, but I'm sure your situation is quite clear to you."
"I'm a
“Sleep is not such a trivial thing when one does not need it so often. A practice I often did even when I was alive. It is not a priority of mine.”
"Ah! Right! Of course. Then that must've been how you knew about me. You must've looked my name up."
John let out a nervous laugh and let a eye wonder down to the drink at hand.
“So how is the shoulder?” Sherlock asked as he hung up his coat on a peg and started up the stairs.
“Did you knock me out?”
John sat back in keen interest now. No wonder Sherlock was able to come to the conclusions he did the first night they met despite his skill. If John was correct in thinking and given the fact that his new flatmate was a vampire; he must have vast amounts of information right at his fingertips. Able to solve crimes at a mere glance without even touching a body. All he would have to do is go to the right location in his mind to get whatever he needed.
“You picked me up off the street to be your flatmate. How is any of
Skepticism was now radiating off the doctor. He was torn on wanting to be cautious of a potential dangerous delusional man yet almost itching to prove him wrong. That this way of thinking and admitting he was some dangerous fictional creature was all in his head. John reached over to his briefcase and retrieved his stethoscope and with only slight hesitancy he approached his captor. He set about his examination as he would with any other patient. Placing the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the fifth intercostal space of the man’s chest he listened through the eartips.
Sherlock gave John a small smile and continued his trek towards the road. John had been right. Sherlock’s skills were no magic trick, but the real deal. The fact he could piece together this gruesome scene in just a an hour had been a remarkable feat. But there was something in Sherlock’s reasoning that didn’t add up.
"Oh, don't pretend you worked that out. Somebody told you that."
It wasn’t the awe of strength that kept John watching the scene from afar, but pure unbridled shock of the display. He wanted to call out for Sherlock to stop, though no matter how much his mind screamed the word, his tongue caught in his throat. It too paralyzed. His legs twitched at the urge to run over and defuse the situation however, they too was anchored to the ground. All military instinct had flown out the window.
“Ma’am.” The Inspector tipped his head toward’s the doctor’s wife and left to follow the pair.
“Sorry. I’m making you uncomfortable, aren’t I?”
"They call this a laptop. Not sure why because it doesn't necessarily have to be in your lap to work. You press the button here and….," The laptop brightened to life and dinged "It comes on. They say muggles use these all the time for work or school. You can do just about any type of job on here from…calculating sums to making a letter, there are games you can play or even get on the "web". We're still not completely sure if the "web" is a real world or not.
“We might as well call this stake out a draw. I do believe our endeavors will be fruitless tonight. Why don’t you go on and seek out the comforts of home. I shall be along momentarily.” Said Sherlock.
"I'd say private detective ..."
The detective was…inviting him? The prospect of running like an Auror again, even if it meant for a couple of hours, how could he refuse! It had been a long time since he had a good adrenaline rush. Now one laid before his feet.
“Do you?” Sherlock’s eyebrows raised, challenging John's statement as he stepped out of the taxi cab and John followed suit. Right now the feline looked like any other person on the street. Even the pupils of his eyes that were only mere slits at the flat earlier had now widened in the darkness, making them appear more human. It would take anyone a good hard look to try and find the differences between him and John.
“There’s more? I thought we laid out all the terms and conditions.”
“Bags in the fridge, Mr. Anemic.”
John shook his head and he tried to hide the smile that was wanting to grace his face due to Mr. Weasley's explanation. It would not be the first time a wizard was totally fascinated by modern technology. When he was in school he often saw the pure and half blood wizards stare at him in amazement at the wonders of his pens. Something so simple.
"Donovan!" A call from Lestrade from the doorway of the building broke their conversation.
"Perfectly sound analysis, but I
“You…
As Baker Street disappeared out of sight he could see the pale figure of Sherlock looking out the window watching his bus. Another thought occurred to him. Mycroft had come to the conclusion John was being fed off of and held against his own will. On top of it all Sherlock had made no defense on his part as to why John was living there. Something told John that Sherlock hadn’t exactly been truthful to Mycroft. What story had Sherlock told him? The only expressive reaction Mycroft had got out of Sherlock was that he had swore he hadn’t bit John. Though it left John to wonder. Where exactly did Sherlock get his blood source before him if not directly biting a victim? John had a theory it may have been from Mycroft if he indeed held a higher power office in the British government. God only knows
“Precisely the point. Morning nephew.”
With a simple nod from John, Sherlock returned to the desk mug in hand. This had been somewhat of an odd day for him. He wasn’t sure if it was because he had been starving for a length of time or it was the rush of new blood in his system. He had crossed realities this morning with John blatantly thinking he knew of the Diogenes Club. He subtly flirted on the cab ride, which if he was truly honest he quite enjoyed himself, and even pleased he had invoked such a reaction in the doctor. And then it even seemed, for the briefest of seconds, he had hoped John had remembered the club in his deja vu encounter. What was wrong with him today? These would have to be questions he would need to answer at a later time. Right now the case was at hand.
"Sounds brilliant." Harry nodded and excused himself, once again fighting the crowd of people back to the elevator.
“It’s relevant to me.” John leaned forward in his chair to get a better look at the detective. “Are…are you embarrassed?”
“Nice to meet you. Breakfast is lovely by the way.”
He knew in an instant from his stony look that he had said the wrong words. How little John knew that he was about to be undressed to the soul for the next five minutes.
“Lestrade you never told us the freak was well…a freak!”
“Damn,” John blinked back his stupor. “Maybe I should fire her. God this is crazy. Absolutely ridiculous! You are right though, this offer I mean, it would be stupid to refuse but you have to know I would be taking a giant risk. Seriously if anyone found out..”
John's eyes flitted down at his leg and cane for a second and shuffled his feet awkwardly at the blunt comments.
Lestrade took another drink, then nodded.
"Next," Mr. Weasley spun around and searched through a box that was sitting on a desk "I have a mobile phone. These things are all the rage in the muggle world! You can talk to people from far away, or anymore, they are just like the laptop where you can access the web. Fascinating things!" he turned back to John to show him.
John eyes widened at his question. “You mean go with you? To the crime scene?”
“Three? They must be bad off.” She handed him the bags.
two bedrooms."
"Who's this?" Lestrade asked Sherlock in a hushed voice as he dressed in coveralls as well.
Sherlock walked through the kitchen again with a fresh change of clothes that was no different from his usual dressed up attire.
John made a hasty retreat down the staircase, shucked off the plastic coveralls and put back on his jacket. He hobbled outside to the street sure the muggle would be there waiting for him, since had invited him on this adventure, but he was no where to be found.
"Oh, do as he says. Help yourself." His tone was frustrated and clipped as he turned to go outside of the room, barking orders to the rat faced man to give John and Sherlock some time. John hobbled over to Umbridge's body, awkwardly getting down on one knee and laying his cane off to the side. The detective crouched on the other side, his eyes full of interest and intrigue.
“Wait…he was the suspect wasn’t he?” John’s brows shot up. “The one you were waiting for?”
“I’m not repeating myself.” Sherlock shook his head and prepared John’s cup of tea.
"You'll have to forgive Mrs. Hudson sometimes she indulges at times in taking a higher dosage of her "evening herbal soothers" and it interferes with her dementia as she often forgets that I am. A. Consulting. Detective!" He said the last part through gritted teeth. Hoping his words would penetrate her brain.
“You helped her husband get off?”
Sherlock had been so deep in his trancelike gaze that the tips of his fingers were brushing ever so lightly across his lips as he stared. Not at John’s face, but further down towards his exposed neck. It felt more predatory than friendly. Like a mouth watering hungry man at a feast whose only privilege was to look; yet not allowed to touch or taste. But this was Sherlock’s own rules for himself. And from what he could guess this is why the vampire had put distance between them, choosing not to socialize at the table, but to take up residence in his grey chair. The faint glow of sunlight behind the curtains made him look more ominous in the darkened room. It was time that John took matters into his own hands before it started spiraling out of control.
John headed back to 221B Baker Street with a sense of purpose. He and Sherlock were going to discuss last night, and they were going to discuss what happened this morning. But when John walked in, Mycroft Holmes was standing over a very annoyed looking Sherlock. "Doctor Watson," Mycroft said snottily. "I presume you know why I am here." "Can't say that I do, Mycroft." "Really? So you weren't aware Little Brother was back on the sauce?" John froze. That was another thing he had wanted to discuss a little more that afternoon. Now he was worried that Sherlock may not be around to discuss it. "Mycroft, I am not back on the sauce. I had a slip. It is over. I have figured out the cause of my distress, I will handle it from here." "What was the cause of your distress?" Sherlock looked at John who looked at the floor. Mycroft noticed. "John? What did he do?" John heard a hint of the brotherly concern in Mycroft's voice. "Nothing. He did nothing. It was my fault, I missed something." "I'm confused." "You should be used to that" Mycroft sighed and straightened up a bit. "Fine, Sherlock. Whatever you say. I will go. I can see I am not wanted. But I have my eye on you. Buying heroin on the street like a bum? Tsk, tsk. I know everything that happens in this city, Sherlock. Doctor Watson, please do as I have asked and look after this one." And with that, Mycroft Holmes left the building.
It had been a month since that fateful night when the maddest man Sherlock had ever come in contact with escaped. 32 days, actually. And Sherlock had spent every single one of them pondering what in the hell it was about John Watson that had caused him to care.  John was kind, sure. But Sherlock had known kind men before. Kindness never seemed to matter to Sherlock, it was usually irrelevant to the facts of the case whether or not the victim or the suspect or Sherlock himself were kind. And John was smart. As smart as any ordinary man could be, at least. He was a wonderful doctor who knew so much about the human body. He would have to, to piece together men broken and bloody and burned by war. But Sherlock reckoned he could do the same if he'd ever felt the inclination to attend medical school. John was loyal, loyal to a fault really. Another trait Sherlock had never felt necessary. But he had decided he rather liked having someone around that was so loyal to him.  It made him feel more responsibility to be careful in regards to his own safety. So how could an ordinary man like John Watson with perfectly ordinary traits, cause Sherlock so much concern that he'd let Moriarty win the game and get away?
"Oh my God!" John shouted, completely by accident. Sherlock jumped about ten feet in the air, dropped his cigarette, knocked over the computer and pulled the headphones out in the process. The sound of two men very engrossed in eachother's penises filled the air and John scrambled to turn it off. Sherlock stood there, a very pretty shade of red coloring every inch of flesh John could see. Once the computer was fully off (John had removed the battery) and Sherlock's cigarette was removed from the floor where it was burning a hole in the linoleum, they stood awkwardly for a moment, refusing to look at eachother. Then they both spoke at once.
I'm a bit blocked, guys. Leave some comments I need some motivation :)
"It's for a case..."
Sorry it took so long, so many chapters, but let's be real. Our boys have way too many neuroses to just jump in the sack together.
John shuddered again at the mix between his gentle caress and the intensity with which he kissed him. What had gotten into Sherlock? He seemed to be staking his claim on John's body, like dawn was approaching and they would soon have to go back into the world and he wanted everyone to...oh. He wanted everyone to know that John belonged to him now. Well, he is dating a sociopath. "Oh, God, Sherlock! That's cold!" Sherlock had begun to press the pad of his lubricated thumb to John's hole. He reached back and took Sherlock's hands away from his ass and placed them on the bed on either side of their hips. Then he took Sherlock's face in his hands and said "I am not going anywhere. I love you. I mean it. And you said you love me, too. So you're stuck with me. I told you I want you to make love to me. It's our first time, you can stake your claim on my body next time." And with that, he kissed Sherlock tenderly and pressed him back down to the mattress.
"Are you saying...?" "Yes. Not right now. I'm having way too much fun building this up to go straight for that right now. But yes. You may touch me there. You may do whatever you want to there."
So I wrote this series years ago because I wanted something that felt realistic, like if John was gonna be with a man, how would that really happen? It was meant to be short and spiraled into this, as happens so many times. Because of that, I stalled out and never finished the story. So here I am, years later, to finish the story of how John and Sherlock end up in bed together. I also changed the title because 3 years later the only thing I hate in this story is that terrible title.
John finds Sherlock watching gay porn and things get a little messy. Where will the Baker Street Boys decide to go from here? And why is Mycroft so judgy?
Sherlock's face lit up like a firecracker. His smile was blinding and his eyes crinkled at the edges and John just had to kiss him. Especially before he lit a cigarette. "Sherlock, I'm sorry, but I have to get ready for work. These are to tide you over until I get home but I PROMISE we'll talk then."
Now it had been a full week later and they hadn't so much as sat less than two feet from eachother while watching the telly. But if Mrs. Hudson thought they were a couple before, she knew it now. They had been having "domestics" as she liked to call them every night since, the latest being on Sherlock's smoking. "I don't like kissing an ashtray, Sherlock! And I won't like hooking up your oxygen machine one day!" Because Sherlock wasn't sure that John would ever kiss him again and because he definitely wasn't sure John would be around long enough to see Sherlock need oxygen, he simply rolled his eyes and went back to his microscope. John said "Fine. I'll handle this." And stormed out of the apartment carrying the jar of emergency cash. How he would handle it was beyond Sherlock. Until he went out later to buy a pack and was informed by the clerk that John had paid him, and everyone else, to keep the cigarettes far from Sherlock Holmes.  Madenning.
Shore leave wasn't the plan, but it was difficult to deny his men of the...
"So you're having fun?" John teased lightly, his breaths becoming pants.
"Oh?" John prompted, smirking softly.
Sherlock deduced - before she walked over. "How are you feeling, Sherlock?"
"Oliver?" John attempts to get his attention, leaning forward slightly with his hands in his lap. "Focus on me, okay? Focus on my voice."
sound like a hospital, maybe - or a mental institution." John confessed with a soft breath trailing behind. "But-"
As Peter brought the chair over and sat down a few feet away from Sherlock, Sherlock started. "You said that you thought the man was asleep. Did you see him?"
Sherlock immediately relaxed beneath John, his jaw going slack just enough for John to shove his tongue in Sherlock's mouth. The taller man hummed a pleasant noise and reached up with both hands to cup John's face, returning the favor after the few seconds of surprise faded away. John started to pull back after a long moment but Sherlock tried to follow his lips with his own, refusing to part until John pushed on Sherlock's bare shoulder and put Sherlock flat on his back again.
"What were you doing in a bookstore this late?" John questioned skeptically, holding a hand out to the boy. Peter placed the paper in John's hands, and John started to unfold it. It looked like the paper was torn out of something, maybe a book, because only one edge was rough and jagged.
He stormed off with a huff, and after a moment or so John dared to peek out from under the bill of his black soft gambler. The man was gone.
Sherlock was so consumed by thought that he mistook John repeating what he said as John asking if he was okay. "Sorry, I never considered the concept of being asked to partake in a serious monogamous relationship before. You caught me off guard." John suddenly understood the odd look on Sherlock's face moments before and let out a breath of relief.
John pressed closer, the tip of his length touching Sherlock's entrance, and the detective's breathing stuttered. The soldier smiled softly, watching his partner's face for discomfort as his hips pressed closer. When the tip finally breached the tight ring of muscle, Sherlock closed his eyes and his eyebrows furrowed. John rubbed and massaged the backs of Sherlock's thighs and stopped pushing his hips forward, letting Sherlock adjust and have all the time he needed.
"Oliver, do you have anything on your person?" John asked, calmly adding, "Perhaps a phone, a wallet..." Oliver shakes his head.
"Partially," Lestrade started. Sherlock beat him to the finish, however.
"Fine, I'll play your game." He spat. "Sherlock Holmes."
"Yeah, he was sittin' in his desk chair a few feet away. I thought it was kinda odd, but I just wanted to get the gold and get out."
The scene played out in Sherlock's mind; he remembered the hot, piercing pain of the bullet, the struggle to fight his way back to life inside his Mind Palace, and waking up groggily on the operating table.
The blue metal door.
John's ears turned pink and he clenched his jaw. The timer on the microwave dinged and Sherlock opened it. "I'm flattered that our antics make you happy, though I admit I knew that from the start. It's the reason I recruited you, after all. Not many doctors in London that would enjoy chasing down a criminal with a high-functioning sociopath."
"So demanding," John teased the detective, pressing a kiss to the same spot he had caressed. Gently, John rubbed the tip of a lubed finger against Sherlock's hole and Sherlock let out a little gasp. The sudden cold against his nerves sent a chill up his spine, and he felt something -
"What?"
"You're right. I didn't kill him, and neither did this
Sherlock smiled softly, watching them disappear into the kitchen, and continued to explain what the doctors had said about his injury to Ms. Hudson. The wound was neat and would heal within a month, so long as he kept it clean and didn't pop any stitches. The morphine tablets he was prescribed would last a week, but he doubted that he would need to take them all.
"You're letting me go." Sherlock narrowed his eyes. "You never let prisoners of nobility go."
don't."
"There was..." Oliver licked his dry lips. "There was a house..? No, wait, it was a halfway house. I've been living there for..." Oliver paused then looked up at John, confessing with mild horror, "Christ, I have no idea what day it is."
"Alright."
She looked up when John entered and smiled politely, although with a hint of confusion. John walked forward as she asked with a warm, welcoming voice, "Hello, sir. What can I help you with today?"
John stared blankly into Sherlock's eyes, conflicting emotions threatening to swallow him whole. His ribs ached with the pressure of them, as if they were expanding outward from his core and filling his chest cavity.
Sherlock moved over to the door and fished something out of his pocket, kneeling down by the padlock around two thick metal loops: one bolted to the door and one bolted to the concrete wall. He tilted the padlock up so he could see the keyhole and stuck a thin piece of metal inside. Within a minute the lock was picked and the padlock slipped off easily.
John and Sherlock walked down the street toward the direction Oliver and the officers had said he had come from, glancing down alleyways for anything suspicious and studying building fronts for mentions of a halfway house. After about twenty minutes of walking, they saw a minimalist sign with
"Christ, Sherlock, stay still!" John chided the taller man, both of them sitting on the edge of their bed. Rosie was asleep upstairs in her crib, which meant that now was the perfect time to take out Sherlock's stitches without being bothered by a toddler's grabby hands. However, Sherlock was restless and bored after having spent a month barred from crime scenes. All cases since he stopped needing the morphine were done on his laptop and were dreadfully simple, of which he kept reminding John.
- The deduction came to Sherlock like a freight train had slammed into his chest, nearly knocking the wind out of him.
"Uh, okay-" Lestrade grabbed his walkie talkie and spat some numbers into it as he went down the stairs the duo had just come up, getting a response of similar numbers back. John recognized them, but admittedly he was too focused on Sherlock to decode them. His subconscious supplied that it was probably something about serious injuries, but John dismissed it just as quickly as the thought came. He guided Sherlock over to a plastic chair and sat him down gently, whispering to him to take it easy and relax. Sherlock's injury was the only injury he cared about.
John smirked.
"I'm pleased that you want to stay." Sherlock confessed, avoiding John's eyes by looking at the window once again, that way he could still assess John's response in his reflection. As Sherlock expected, John was a bit surprised; he cocked an eyebrow and glanced over at Sherlock.
"More." He pleaded. "Please. I need it." John pulled his torso away from Sherlock's and put both hands on the bed, shifting his weight to his arms, and picked up the tempo. Sherlock's back arched and his finger nails scraped down John's shoulder blades to the doctor's biceps, Sherlock groaning lowly from deep in his chest. John's name became a mantra on Sherlock's lips, and John found that the faster he went the louder Sherlock became.
"You're a great father." Sherlock said, placing the plate in the microwave and setting the timer. It hummed while he continued speaking. "I'm not well-versed on child-rearing or child development, but I doubt someone else could have explained post-traumatic night terrors to a two-year-old and had them understand that they would not suffer the same terrors."
John put his hand on the door handle, took a breath, and turned it slowly. This was not his first encounter with the mentally ill. Working in the surgery had its fair share of suicide attempts and suicide watches, but this was different. This was quite literally psychotic. Like knowing there's a landmine
"Likewise." Sherlock hummed, blushing a bright pink from his neck to his cheeks. "I was fine with just being physically closer than we had been previously, had it been what you wanted, but I don't think that is an option, now." John chuckled, moving his hand from Sherlock's neck to Sherlock's ribs, both hands now resting on Sherlock's sides.
"And I've got experience from dealing with patients." John glanced over at Lestrade and Sherlock then went for the door, "You said you got the pocketknife off him?"
"Doctor Watson."
Sherlock had an odd look settle over his face, and John decided to ignore it. He didn't have time for a bitter back-and-forth to last much longer. Sherlock was mildly surprised that Captain Watson was so protective of the orphaned child.
"Q-Questions?" Peter stuttered nervously, glancing over at Sherlock. Sherlock eyed John before he focused on Peter.
Sherlock returns home after visiting the emergency room to get stitched up, and he has a heart-to-heart with John on the couch.
judge." After a moment John realized what he said and swallowed slightly. "I mean, you're a healthy weight, and you don't have any bad scarring, you know?"
"I don't know." Sherlock replied, this time a bit easier. "Mycroft paid my way out and sent me home. I didn't care enough to ask at that point if he bombed the place or what. I was just ready to come home and have everything back to how it was supposed to be."
"'Piss off'."
"That's very kind of you."
"Good?"
"When do you have your support group?" Sherlock asked next, and Oliver blinked and looked up at Sherlock.
mmf!"
Sherlock was fairly sure he had the case solved by this point, but he wondered where the fun was in leaving Lestrade to find the criminal when the case was mildly interesting? So, he sat quietly and pondered the information he'd found outside while Isabelle wrote down a list of names for John.
"What?" Peter gave John a funny look, and John met his eyes.
Rosie brought John from his thoughts, smiling and standing up in her crib, tiny hands holding onto the top of the wooden railing. She rubbed her eyes with a balled fist and John smiled softly.
"... wouldn't have come back to me." John looked down at Sherlock's chest, seeing the circular scar where Mary's bullet pierced him. "At the very least, not
They started at opposite sides of the room and worked their way around, feeling the walls and looking for scuff marks on the floor. Sherlock tapped on the walls every two steps to check for a hollow sound where insulation was removed to make an entrance.
"Did 'who' hurt me?" John pries, standing up straight and skirting the far wall so he can see the man and not strain his back.
"Think you can take your button-up off?" John asked, watching Sherlock kick his shoes off his heels and shake them off his long feet, hitting the floor with a soft thud. "I'd like to wrap your stitches with some gauze. It should help with the irritation."
?" He questioned curiously, narrowing his eyes at the man in the brig when he bristled, taking in a restrained breath. "What, don't like being called a noble? You clearly know who I am. I clearly know
"For better." John immediately supplied. He swallowed, realizing what he just said and the mild shock in Sherlock's eyes. "I had considered saying that this morning, before Rosie needed my help." Both men pictured the event in their minds - Sherlock remembered the odd look in John's eyes, and John remembered the warmth in Sherlock's that hadn't been there years before.
"What do you remember of your route to the Yard?"
you have to let me get the stitches out first."
"Why the hell do I try-"
"I'm not his keeper, Ms. Hudson," Sherlock gave her a sincere look, a promise in his eyes, "but I will not let him be injured, just as I've always strived to do." She gave Sherlock a look of worry, but wisely chose not to continue the conversation. John turned the corner of the stairwell and met Sherlock's eyes, then Ms. Hudson's.
The man, a bit younger than John himself but not by much, spoke with a deep rumble. His voice was a smooth baritone, elegant like his appearance.
"Oh?" John prompted, confused and curious. "How what was supposed to be?"
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at John, bemused and oddly flattered, then leaned his head back and stared up at the ceiling. They were silent for a long while, the flat silent thanks to Ms. Hudson taking Rosie out for a bit of lunchtime shopping. At the news of Sherlock's injury, Ms. Hudson offered to make an early dinner for everyone and to have Rosie out of the flat for a while as Sherlock got settled in. John couldn't thank whatever omnipresent being there was enough for the absolute saint that Ms. Hudson was.
"You can't touch that, Rosie." John chided her gently. "Sherlock got hurt."
Sherlock huffed and rolled his eyes, "Fine, you have a deal."
Sherlock looked at the two men next to him after he spoke. Greg met his eyes for a moment then looked at Oliver with a thoughtful gaze, as if he could figure out what was wrong just by looking. Sherlock and John met eyes next, and John new that expression on Sherlock's face and the message hidden there.
"Yes."
"I like... tigers!" Rosie growled and looked up at John, making him laugh.
"John." The man replied after a moment. John smiled and nodded, crossing one leg over the other and adjusting his coat.
"What's wrong, cuppa?" John soothed, holding her against him and rocking slightly, shifting his balance in a gently sway. "It's just your crib, darling. See?" He patted the railing lightly.
. Sherlock hadn't considered thoughtfulness as a good thing, before. Typically others told him to stop thinking so much. Or was that talking? Sherlock heard both whenever his mind was whirring with deductions and ideas.
." The volume of his voice tells John that Oliver likely isn't talking to him. He silently watches for a moment as Oliver snarls and grips his hair tight in one hand.
"Found a- well- by house," Ivan panted. "Pulled up- water bucket. Found this inside." Ivan panted from the effort of swimming back to the ship and he held out the corked bottle. Inside was a rolled up piece of parchment.
"Great." Sherlock replied with a husky voice. "I think I need a few more to focus on, though." John chuckled, giving him a smirk.
John and Sherlock arrive at Scotland Yard to find the Yarders, particularly Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade, in a tough situation. Being the medical expert on scene, John meets the man that Greg called him about.
"Uh, okay." John absently replied. "I'll admit, I didn't expect you to know that you'd need to... Or that you'd be..." John trailed off and Sherlock sheepishly smirked.
John finished the last letter and nodded, clicking his pen and folding his paper pad before tucking them back into his pocket. Sherlock walked toward the door and John looked up, saying abruptly, "Oh, Sherlock?"
