Or: the greasers and socs have an illegal drag race (not RuPaul's. With cars.)
He blushed and fiddled with his hands in his lap. I stood up and gazed out the window, leaning to one side of the frame. The city's lights were lit up in golden-yellow squares of windows and circles of streetlights. Lustrous, firey, honey-colored light dotted at the skyline like a splatter of golden stars on the canvas of Paris. Cas hummed along with the music. I felt like dancing.
My father didn't look up from the paper as he said, "Your mother doesn't hate you. I'm starting to think we mainstream schooled you too quickly. Maybe we should bring you back to homeschooling for a while."
He laughed, then turned solemn and whispered, "Dad's really mad."
My dad had yet to realize that the definition of being grounded, was to not be able to leave the house. That made my Mathlete escape a lot easier.
The students shook their heads and Kevin raised his hand.
I touched my face and shook off the pain. Winchester men don't cry. What kinda fuckin' man am I? Hardly 16 and crushing on another guy. I'm no man. I crumpled to the floor and felt a kick to my side.
He groaned and turned over, nuzzling into my chest.
"Well, at least there's no distractions. Not one of those Marymount boys are cute."
He planted a little peck on my nose. "M'kay."
We pulled over other the side of the road and grabbed a couple of blankets.
"What are Kälteen bars?" Sam stretched up to a box in a cupboard above the countertop.
I don't blame you for hating me. I wrote this, and now I hate me.
Lucky lady? Not this time, soc.
Mr. Singer gossiped with the other teachers. "I hear Lucifer George is back together with Dean Winchester. The two were seen canoodling at a Halloween party and have been inseparable since."
Ugh I just realized NONE of the italics transferred to AO3 that’s so frustrating dhhdjskdk I just have to trust that you all understand the inflections through telepathy or something idk :/
"-all the way around. Like an owl."
"No, I'm actually failing almost everything." He picked at his potatoes.
"That depends. Are you still an asshole?" Charlie said.
"Just- I don't feel like talking about it." I lifted his chin to give him a soft kiss. "Just be with me. 'Kay?"
"I don't know, I care about people!"
"Cas!" I shouted with relief since he looked unharmed and alive.
"So are we still fighting?" I asked tentatively.
I picked him up by the armpits and shook him a bit until he woke up
"Try satanic," I interjected.
I KNOW I said it was the last one tonight but it turns out that I’m a little liar.
Dean fired back. "That book was written by a bunch of stupid guys who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.."
"That's that Winchester boy." One pointed, trying to be discreet.
"Cut the gas, greasers!" Someone yelled, which I recognized as Luke Novak, who has a more unfortunate name than Alfie's nickname. The Novak's are very religious, and when their Dad, Chuck, was still at home, he named his kids after angels. Gabriel and Michael got normal names, Cas had a more obscure name, but Lucifer, or Luke, had it bad. He sure gave teachers one hell of a scare on the roll list the first day.
lol guess it's an mpreg fic now. So anyways back to fixing shit. Deans preggo, somehow he hid his baby bump or smth. But how does Castiel know?? Because...
I know 15x19 also sucked, but I think it would have made a better last episode. 15x20 didn’t really resolve any plot points left open in the end, and 15x19 would still be a shitty finale but at least it would have understood basic plot structure. I would have been super upset either way but at least we wouldn’t have to sit through carry on my wayward son twice in a row. Like seriously, once is all you need.
After class, he told me even more than I could have hoped.
Cas flinched, and I grabbed his hand and gave a reassuring squeeze.
I ran down to meet with Charlie and Sam, who were in matching tuxes, sticking my fragment behind my ear.
"How do you even spell Castiel?" Charlie fiddled with her bag's zipper.
"Cas?" Dean asked in confusion.
"Let's dance." I turned around and gestured to the open floor space between the end of the bed and a desk.
"You've got no part in this, Sam. Go to bed." My father's voice had the ability to sound so soothing, but I could tell it only hid the hatred and fury it kept for me.
"You are a monster. He was never broken, he was his own perfect part of our own new machine. And we worked perfectly." I cried as a red and blue light washed over the street, filling the night with sirens and wails.
"Hey baby," I whispered to the car as a sign of respect towards the nicest thing we owned. Then I crept up to the door, awaiting the shitstorm I had coming.
Luci smells like feet, or peppermint, Michael is doing everything backwards, Cas saved the talent show, and fetch has yet to happen.
"You're safer without me!" He shouted.
"Why am I going on the floor? I'm a bit tall for that."
We sat at the wooden table at Dean's house, papers scattered across the tabletop.
"Did you just say 'thang' with an a?"
They scurried away quickly, saddle shoes clicking on the pavement, the poodle embroidery on the hems of their skirts flapping as they walked faster.
"Ready Dean?" Sam said, dressed as formally as I was.
"We can't go to Taco Bell. I'm on an all-carb diet! God, Gabriel, you're so stupid!" He angrily picked up his lunch tray and stormed off.
"Shut up." Lucifer snapped back.
Lucifer turned to Gabriel. "Oh my god Gabriel, you can't just ask people why they're an angel!"
"A little disappointed you didn't, but glad. I didn't really think you would have done that." He said and I sighed with relief.
"Thanks. The property part is really Luci's fault, and I think getting hit by a bus was good enough punishment." He smiled his winning smile at me and his freckles jumped around his cheeks.
"What? Cas, this is your night. Don't let the haters stop you from doing your thang!"
"No, you're not fine, you need to recover, you and Sam can stay here, I've got this covered." He lifted my head to put an ice pack where I hit my head on the table.
I walked down the street for a while, stressing over that, but eventually daydreaming about Cas. Then I paused across the street from my house. My Dad's black Impala was parked outside, which meant Dad was home early. And I was supposed to watch Sammy. Son of a bitch.
"I know you didn't write that whole book yourself. Did you rat out the others or take the blame?"
Shit, we lost.
I know child abuse is tagged in the tags and this falls under it, but I wanted to be specific, about that if that bothers anyone.
The sirens blared, but they couldn't help Sam. Lights were flashing everywhere, like when the police car pulled up after Cas was dead. They were too late to save him.
"Oh, no, Cas." Sam looked empathetically at me, a sobbing and angry zombie mess.
"It's overused." He pulled out a record and put it on the record player. He set the needle down and the sounds of jazz music filled the room.
"Vous ne voudrez peut-être pas en commander un autre. Vous êtes très ivre et il est tard," he said with a faint American lilt in his otherwise convincing French accent.
"Nonsense! Everyone is welcome, it's a big party, and you'd better be there, instead of moping at home like a sad sack.
"Why?" I looked at him, still holding Cas' body.
"I don't dance." He scuffed his shoe on the ground.
"Hey, I didn't think you'd make it!" He smiled and handed me the gift card. "I'm here to present you with your gift card for Biggerson's."
"I understand, Dean. People like you and I, we're from different groups. We just don't mix, and that's the way of things."
"Nope."
"Hey Benny, if someone here were, y'know, queer, would you be okay still being in the gang with 'em and all?" I whispered.
"You're not a warthog, you're a lion. Just focus on schoolwork. You're a good student, so you should make it through."
I walked up to her desk with my quiz.
"That is correct." I was rusty.
"I-I'm sorry Dean, I shouldn't do that, uh, I don't know what I was-"
"The eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg represent the eyes of God looking down on the American wasteland of society. That wasteland is the valley of ashes. The valley shows the moral and social decline of society when people like the Buchanan's or Gatsby pursue wealth without thinking of the consequences." He explained while we sat at my kitchen table, carefully positioned by me so he was constantly on my left side, and wouldn't see the mark.
I saw Cas standing in the streetlight haze, in a baggy shirt and jeans.
"They're gorgeous. That's the color I wish mine were"
"Cas?" I slurred, my voice was thick and croaky.
Yeah yeah I said I’d wait until tomorrow but like I said: no posting schedule we go on whatever energy I feel. I don’t even remember what happens in this chapter this is way less organized than I thought it would be 15 minutes ago.
"Drop dead twice, Dean-o" he quipped, a lollipop stick hanging from his mouth like a cigarette.
"No way!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sam's sleeping in my room, and I'm going to stay out here."
"Give it back."
She lifted them up into the air, hesitated, and brought them down with a swish, as the cars sped past. Sammy would have to goose it to keep up with Luke's bent eight, but he could make it.
Wrong.
Still, nothing came to me. I was in a place where thousands of writers have gotten inspiration, and I had nothing. I had finished my coffee and paid, so I began to walk around again. Soon I realized the ideas wouldn't just come if I walked around all night.
When you get bit by a snake, you're supposed to suck the poison out. That's what I had to do. Suck all the poison out of my life. I started with Lucifer, who was living proof that the more people are scared of you, the more flowers you get. Then there was Ms. Mills, who was living proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
Later that evening, Sam and I waited for on the porch for our ride to the drive-in.
"Cas I don't need to be babied, I'm fine!" I protested, only to be tucked in on the couch.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He's not even that hot if you look closely." I knew people were getting annoyed with me, but I just couldn't stop. It was like word vomit.
"It burned down in 1983," Sam explained.
"You're not Gabe." I comforted Gabriel who looked glumly at his food.
"We wouldn't get you in trouble, we're friends!" Charlie sat down on the grass.
"Sam's dead." She whispered.
"I'm Castiel. Do you guys know where room G is? I have Health next." I showed them my printed out agenda.
I sighed and slumped in my seat again. Cherry on the fucking top.
He slunk away, rubbing his arm. The girls in the gang were less like girls we dated, and more like sisters. Jo was tough and Charlie was independent and, as she put it "flamingly liberal." Which lead to a lot of talk about the girls liking girls. They didn't really mind the talk, but we made sure they didn't talk shit about them.
"Dean-o! hop in!" Gabriel Novak shouted from the beat-up station wagon. Not all Novaks were dicks, like Gabe and Cas, but I didn't trust Michael, and their brother, Luke, jumped Sam a while back and beat him up pretty bad. Gabe wasn't in a gang, though we treated him almost like a part of ours, the Hunters.
"I don't care what you were doing. You need to be more responsible! You've gotta start using your head."
I quickly detached from Cas and pushed him away guiltily. "Cas, pack up your stuff," I said softly. "Just leave. Please."
Then they all go out for pizza feeling very alive and happy and openly LGBTQ+ and proud of it. They go watch game of thrones together or something and start picking out baby crap with Cas and Dean. The Impala gets a baby car-seat in the back and it's too cute for words. Dean and Cas take a break with hunting to raise their child properly. Unlike John Winchester.
"That blonde one, Gabriel Smith, is the dumbest archangel you'll ever meet. He was in my English class last year and asked me how to spell 'orange.'"
"Thanks, I get it now."

Okay hello again I think it’s time I stop being surprised at how long it takes me to update it’s been another month, but here is another chapter. I recently finished few big projects and had a fair bit of personal issues to handle but I think I’ll be writing more, and updating more frequently. I’m totally jinxing it by promising that.
I put my hand in the middle of his back and held his right hand up in mine. He put his other hand just below the collar of my shirt. I guided his feet through a waltz and spun him around the small open space. He hummed along and swayed to the music. His coat, which he had convinced me was dry enough for him to wear, swirled out behind him the way a dancer's dress would. A sand colored trail followed his steps with a swishing noise, accenting every twirl and spin. He swished his coat and knocked over a jar of brushes, and we laughed and danced over to the window. The music swelled as we circled the available space. Violins and piano enveloped my senses and suddenly we weren't in a bedroom filled with art, we were in a grand ballroom, filled with musicians and dancers. Golden lights seemed to dreamily radiate from every surface in the ballroom, and magnificent frescos on the walls danced along with the people. As the song ended with a flourish, we were brought back to reality, and I dipped him back into my arm. The hem of his trench coat brushed the floor as he let himself drape over my arm dramatically. Cas pulled himself up to brush my cheek, staring intently. I dropped my head closer to his face, noses almost touching. When I got close to Cas, just barely a half inch away from him, there was a spark. Like a spark jumping between wires, a little thread of electricity jumped between our lips. The air was static, the hair at the back of my neck stood up, his eyes danced with electric blue. When our lips met, a circuit completed. Energy seemed to reach every bit of my body. Every touch, even as light as a brush of his fingers, set off a fire in my stomach. I needed to feel his skin on mine like I needed air to breathe. If all of Paris had gone dark I wouldn't have noticed, the light from him was warm, buzzing electricity. I longed for it every second he was away. I was insatiable, and nobody else would do. I pulled off his trench coat and threw it on the floor, where it sat next to spilled paintbrushes. With one hand he hooked his fingers down the back of my pants and pulled at my tie with the other. He loosened it and pulled it over my head, tossing it to the growing pile of clothes on the floor.
"It burns carbs like crazy. It just burns them all up."
"You've got to have this little thing called balance."
I shakily got up to the stand. Mr. Salvatore was in need of a major makeover. His outfit looked like a blind nun picked it out of a dollar store, and he needed some serious training on posture. That's when I realized that making fun of him wouldn't help me win.
"I could tutor you after school if you want." Dean offered.
"Rebel Without a Cause. Jeez, you writing a book or something?"
Grease. "I said get up!"
Lucifer is a slut dressed like a good friend, dressing like a slut. A back-stabbing boy-stealing son of a bitch.
"Cas! What happened?"
"Cas, your family."
"Well I've reached my awkwardness limit, so see you guys later."
"Sam! Seriously! Look, he won't get away with this. We're going to do something."
Dean and Cas have their adorable nephilim baby who's totally not evil and it's all cool and everyone's happy for once in this chuck damn show. And nobody died.
"Well, they only work if it's already raining." He admitted and fluffed his wings a little.
I pulled myself up on my bandaged feet and stood by the armchair while Cas made a frantic attempt to clean up my hair.
"Crowley?" Sam pulled off his mask, suprised.
"Fiiine." he mock-pouted.
"Quickly!"
"Well until someone confesses to making it up, this is how we do things."
"741" was the answer the other side gave.

It's typical for parents to cry on their kids first day of school. But that usually happens when the kid is in kindergarten. Up until today, I've been homeschooled. I know what you're thinking, homeschooled kids always weird, but my family is pretty normal. Aside from the fact that my parents are research zoologists and we've spent the last 14 years in Africa. I had a great life until my mom got offered tenure at Lawrence University, and it was goodbye Africa, hello high school.
"I don't think you're sober enough to get home on your own." he gave me a worried look and threw my arm over his shoulder, supporting my weight. "I'll walk you home."
I closed the book quietly and set it by the flowers. It's pages fluttered in the wind, as if his ghost was sitting with us, still helping me find the meaning of a metaphor or some symbolism. The creased pages were now tearstained and dirty. It had grown dark, and the wind swirled dry leaves around the park. I saw Sam shiver in his thin jacket and offered him mine, which he declined.
"Sure, thanks!"
Shouts, whispers, and giggles of names I've been called swirled around my head, jumbled and distorted by the pain in my stomach. I felt like puking.
"What are you-"
I regret last night. Hangovers are a bitch. I also regret never asking that guy what his name was. I sure was stuck on him though. I dragged my feet out of bed and out into the hallway. I passed a mirror, turned to my reflection and saw that I looked like a scruffy piece of shit. I felt like it too. I shut the curtains, hiding the scenic view of Parisian streets. The city of lights was too bright, I grumbled, rubbing my temples. I shuffled over to the counter and opened a beer. Hair of dog, right?
"Je ne peux pas te sortir de ma tête, tu me rends fou. Je veux sentir chaque morceau de toi. Je veux que tu mentes sur ce lit maintenant et que tu me parles sale avec la voix douce que tu utilises." He unbuttoned my shirt and I sat back on the bed.
"It was nothing, you don't owe me."
He picked up a jar and hurled it at my head, and it shattered on the wall to my right. "DON'T TALK BACK AT ME, BOY! You- you're not even a boy, you filthy animal!"
I felt a shiver throughout my body and stepped away from Sam. This was too much.
"Um, I hate to ask Gabe, but what are you?" I stared questioningly anywhere other than from the shoulders down.
"Yeah, moderately priced soaps sure are my calling." She smiled and gave a thumbs up with a hint of sarcasm.
"What's going on?" he broke the silence with the childlike curiosity I wish he used elsewhere.
I looked up quickly and touched his shoulder. "Wait, Cas, no I uh-"
I clicked away at the story, and he began to mix paints into various colors, matching the walls or the typewriter, then making different shades and hues for the highlights and shadows. We sat there all day, working until the sun was low in the sky. Golden oranges, rich pinks, and creamy purples began to streak across the sky, seeping in through the clouds.

He relaxed. "Okay, grool."
A glass jar- "Take my damn pot to piss in!”
"Je veux mettre mes mains dans tes cheveux moelleux et ma langue dans des endroits où tu ne peux que rêver. Je vous aimerai comme personne ne vous a jamais aimés auparavant et lorsque nous aurons terminé, les voisins connaîtront nos noms. Je vais te baiser jusqu'à ce que tu ne puisses pas te lever. That's how you flirt."
I hurled a large dish at the cabinet and watched it shatter, with a chaotic mix of sadness, anger and relief, "I DON'T CARE! I JUST DON'T GIVE A FUCK!"
"Ok, I'll be right back." He pushed through the crowd again. hate to see him leave, love to watch him go.
"He took him back! Lucifer took Dean back!"
"Everyone has their good and bad sides, Lucifer's just more up-front about it."
"Just in case you listen to rumors, I didn't push Luci in front of the bus." I wanted to make sure he didn't think I would do that.
"I guess I just like you more than I like me. You dragged me around a bar until you found the right redhead, and wouldn't let me go home alone, so I guess I just owe you."
"My friend Benny's having a Halloween party and I wanted to know if you'll come. It's a costume party, and people get really into it." He handed me a small green flyer with a smile. "This only lets in one person, so don't bring along some other guy."
Cas tries to play To Catch a Cheater and ends up playing Dateline.

"I that the summation?"
After school I walked with Dean around the school, leading him closer to the projection room.
At that moment, the lock turned and a group of teenagers stepped into the house.
Frankenbitch has entered the bathroom. Code? Cracked. Email? Sent. Charlie? Armed and ready. Eldon Styne is forcefully removed from existence.
"I'm Castiel Novak." I shook his hand.
"Get him out of here. Now." My Dad's voice was flat and brittle as he tensed his jaw.
I turned back to go to my seat. I apologized to Dean about lying and all the things I said about him being Lucifer's property.
Dean draws a picture. but symbolismmmmm
"Oh, and on Wednesdays, we wear plaid!" Gabriel called after me.
"Both is good. I've always liked both. Both is- grool."
"Hey Charlie, you uh, doin' anything after this? Up for some backseat bingo?"
I avoided Cas and the other socs all throughout the day. At the end of the day, I started towards Sam's school, but Cas was standing outside the library and caught my eye. He ran over and I ducked my head.
"Oh, get bent, Alfie." She socked him in the arm.
"Yeah, we dig." The car chorused, and Charlie put her feet on the floor again.
The Hunters go see a movie at the drive-in
I lost my balance slightly, and the man in the coat caught me.
"You'll get socialized, a little slice like you." Charlie laughed.
"I know you like Dean." Busted. "I don't really care, do what you want. But Dean only really cares about friends, family, and school. I'll talk to him for you, though. And you could totally talk to him yourself."
He smacked me across the face with a backhand that sent me stumbling back into the table."Dean, you're broken! Boys doing that- It's unnatural! It's wrong!" He said in a taut voice, hardly trying to hide his disdain for me.
Suddenly, a shadow behind him moved, and Michael stepped out, switchblade in hand.

"I forgive you, Castiel. But as my own personal form of punishment, I figured out how you're earning your extra credit."
"Why would they trip on me if I'm warm? You know what, forget it."
"Mr. Singer, what are marijuana tablets?" He laughed.
"You've out-gayed yourself, Sam," Charlie said dryly. "Here, this map is your guide to Lawrence High School."
"Just being friendly." Meg smiled.
"No, I'm fine, shoul' get home though." I stood up, swaying slightly.
"You're crazy!" Michael piped up. "You're already so fit."
"You smell like a baby prostitute." She fanned her face.
"Yeah, they're pretty much the same." No, they aren't.
"You know? Then why was Sam all alone when I got home? It's like you don't even think!"
"Of course the God Squad is all in the same gym class." Charlie groaned.
"Why would he do that?" I shouted.
"The limit does not exist!" I answered quickly.
"It's pronounced Castiel."
"Dad I'm not broken-"
Sam fled inside and Dean followed, then I brought in the rear.
“Well shit, what do we do?” Jo put her hands on her hips and frowned.

"Why are you dressed so scary?" Gabriel asked.
"And I have to present you with your crown, King Dean." I pulled a section of crown out of my pocket.
"When you talk dirty in French. I can tell what kind of things you're saying, but I can't understand exactly. It's mysterious and sexy."
"Lucifer..." I  trailed off.
"I lost them."
"Yessir," I looked at the floor.
Everybody gets together for a family reunion and they kill god. And they lived happily ever after.
"No Cas, I really like you, I do, I just gotta be at home to watch my brother." It still sounded like a rejection! "I um, still need help. With the other symbols in the book. Like the eyes!" Stop trying to fool yourself, you can't be with him, he's your green light. "We could go over that at my place. If you want, I guess."
She waved and smiled impishly and I rolled my eyes at her. I turned back to the man. "I really only know enough to get by, and she takes full advantage of that."
We walked up the sidewalk and opened the wrought-iron gate. We searched the grassy hills for a minute until we found the right grave.
"Comme ça? Mystérieux et sexy?"
"Uh, okay?" I gripped my lunch tray.
It’s been a while and the Winchester’s have made more problems for me to fix, so here it is.
I staggered down the cobblestone roads, blissfully unaware of the rain, leaning into Charlie, then a door, then hanging onto a streetlamp for dear life. Swinging around it and hooking my leg around like a terribly trained and drunken pole dancer, I smiled at Charlie.
"I'm sure you have something you're good at."
"Like what?" He traced my jaw.
"Hey, Sammy. I'm okay. I was just doin' some schoolwork. No soc could ever get me down. though I'd leave 'em with a couple black and blue marks." I playfully punched him in the arm.
I hated that Sammy saw me like this. I pressed my arms on my stomach and my head on the linoleum floor as I waited for more pain.
"Oh I'm new, I moved here from Africa. My name is Castiel."
It’s a very short chapter and isn’t very important to the plot, but it’s important to my heart :) hope y’all enjoy
I got to English, and that day, I was actually excited. I understood the book, and I shared that class with Cas. The downsides were the fact that he sat across the room from me, and the class was boring as hell.  I started sketching into the margins of my paper, letting my pencil run loose, with a mind of its own. After a few minutes, I found myself staring at a drawing of a face. It was Cas. I smiled back at the paper. suddenly it was snatched from my hands.
I love this show, but f u c k.
Cas gets with Lawrence High's in-crowd and fails to see that they're all gay as hell. or heaven.
He tapped his eraser on his forehead and ran a hand through his hair. "Well, first I got zero." Wrong. "But I checked again, and got one." There you go.
"Cas, you've gotta steal that book."
"Do you wanna do something fun? Wanna go to Taco Bell?" Gabriel suggested.
I felt that bad feeling in my stomach again and walked into the kitchen.
"Mr. Singer, I wrote it. I made it up."
"Yeah, we'll show you." The bell rang and he pushed through the crowded hallway. "Look out, fresh meat coming through!"
PS I know this chapter might sound like I hate Lisa (it definitely had that vibe in the first draft ngl) but I promise I don’t they’re just teenagers who make mistakes
I heard heavy footsteps out of the kitchen, and when they had gone, I looked up and hugged Sam. He slept in my bed that night and didn't let go until he woke up the next morning.
I tugged at the baggy sleeves of my Mathletes jacket.
"I got one as well," I responded.
I faced my fuming father with defiance, my feet scraping shards of glass and porcelain, and a little blood around the linoleum. "For once in my life," My voice was low, trembling with tears. "I'm happy. Dad, I'm happy with Cas. Do you know how often that happened in the last 14 years? Not a damn second with you. This is the happiest I've been since Mom died."
"Guys, why did we think we could do this? There was no way if knowing anyone would even be in the projection booth. We're amateurs." I said. "That was a mess."
"Yahtzee. Saves money." I said.
"Oh great, thanks." She walked off into the store.
"Teen royalty," Sam replied.
"I took the blame. I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs."
An attractive man at the bar with messy hair, blue eyes, a 5 o'clock shadow and a trench coat. I watched him out of the corner of my eye.
"Thanks."
"It's October 3rd."
"Let's do it, let's fall in love."
He sighed in defeat. "I want to put my hands in your soft hair and my tongue in places where you can only dream. I will love you as no one has ever loved you before, and when we are done, the neighbors will know our names. I'll fuck you until you can't stand up."
I felt sweat forming on my palms as I touched the door handle. I paused for a moment to collect myself. I felt a similar feeling to what I felt with Cas, but it was all dread and guilt, and I hated it. Whatever punishment I got I deserved. I let down Dad, I let down Sammy, and for what? a boy? A stupid-smart pretty boy with blue eyes and a safe, upper-middle-class home to go to? A boy I shouldn't even like in the first place! I deserve every last bruise and scratch. I opened the door and stepped inside. I flinched as Sam ran at me and hugged me tightly.
Charlie leaves the motel totally alive and more badass than ever, having Alan Turinged the shit out of that code. She goes back to the bunker, and sees that Cyrus kid who was actually kind of cool. They re-shelve the books that got knocked over by that other guy. And Dean didn't kill anybody because they talked it out and Cyrus moves to L.A. or wherever and lives his friggin life in peace, and his family never bothers him again. The Stynes get killed because they suck. Boo you nazi-profiting whores.
I stared at the Novak's living room ceiling for what felt like hours, waiting for sleep. Suddenly I heard a whimpering from where Cas was curled up, in an armchair facing the couch.
"Dean, you were supposed to watch your brother. It’s your responsibility to-"
"Lucifer is an evil dictator. And how do you overthrow an evil dictator? Cut off his resources. Lucifer is nothing without his looks, his ignorant followers and his man candy. Take that away- he's just some common bitch." Charlie gave a mischievous grin. "Cas, for this to work, you've got to play it off like nothing happened, and keep hanging out with them. Can you do that?"
"Wow, thank you. Y'know, half the people in this room hate me, and the other half only likes me because they think I pushed someone in front of a bus. That's not great." A small chuckle went through the gym.
Charlie kneeled by my brother, fingers on his limp wrist. "Dean... he's gone."
"I find the streets are quite nice this time of night, all lit up." He said dreamily. "Would you like to walk with me?"
"Merci, chéri."
"It's like British slang or something."
"What movie are we watching?"
"I thought so. You said some stuff about soaking bread in soup, that was loaded with sexual innuendo. I figured you had no clue what you were saying, or you were horrible at pickup lines."
I ground my teeth and kept on walking. We rounded the corner in silence and came upon a grassy, neat park.
"The grease! If they know you're a greaser, they'll kick you out."
"Oh, how awful," Michael whispered like he was at the funeral of someone he secretly didn't really like. I nodded sympathetically. We were at a funeral of sorts. The funeral of Lucifer and Dean's relationship. Good riddance, I thought to myself with a secret smile.
Charlie was off talking to Gilda, a dancer she liked. She gave me a smile, and I gave her a thumbs up, and she ran off with Gilda, the fringe on their party dresses swished around their knees. So I stood on my own, drink in hand. I tapped my feet to the music and lit a cigarette. The song ended and the piano player started to play the opening notes of a new song
"Stop... Stop it, don't hurt him please..." He mumbled fitfully.
That first day was a blur. I kept getting in trouble for random things. In science, I got up to use the bathroom, and was told I needed a "lavatory pass" and when I asked for one, they wouldn't let me have it. The adults no longer trusted me and yelled all the time. No eating in class, no reading ahead, no using the bathroom in class. And to top it off, I had no friends.
"I don't get this, do you?" I leaned over with a math problem I totally understood.
"Sorry, that's Sam, he's almost too gay to function." A red-headed girl in a Star Wars shirt leaned over beside the tall guy, Sam. "I'm Charlie."
"Contestant Salvatore." Kevin leaned into his small microphone.
"Why not?"
"Sure, lemme get my coat." My heart fluttered with excitement.
"Grool!" I blushed. "I- I mean, great. Or cool. Both. I mean both."
"Yeah." I clutched my books.
"You nervous?" Ms. Mills asked.
"I don't know how."
Alright after this I promise I’ll shut up and talk about the story
"Les Années Folles- The Crazy Years," He translated, "are hitting a low point for us."
"Oh come on, that's not true." He scoffed.
"Bonjour, Dean," She said cheerfully in a thick French accent. "Don't forget to stay dry!"
"I won't steal anything."
"Damn," I whispered. "That's a bit more than flirting, but still, damn."
"I know, Dean. But after the allegation towards Coach Lilith turned out to be shockingly true, we have to investigate every claim made in the burn book." He sighed.
"Damn, that was deep."
Also I had to take like a week off because mitski released new music. And I’m thinking of changing my username, but I’ve been gone so long I think it’ll make it hard to recognize.
Gabriel is also there. He is not dead or hurt. He's happy an has candy and all that good shit. He and Sam are dating now because I need my daily dose of Sabriel.
"Did Ms. Mills ever try to sell you marijuana or ecstasy tablets?" Oh shit, this is about the page I wrote.
"You're also a bit young for this movie."
I felt pitying looks all around me. I lost Cas, I lost Sam, and they all give you that look. I sat down on the side of the track and put my head between my knees. He'll be fine, he'll be okay, if I just keep telling myself that he'll be okay, he'll be-
Someone screamed. It could have been me, the crowds, or Sam, or the car itself. The car was mangled, and the windshield shattered. I ran out to the car, but someone grabbed my arm. Fighting and struggling in a blind haze,  I pushed them off and ran across the track. I got to the wreck and pulled open the mangled door. Sam was slouched over the steering wheel, with glass shards stuck in his arm and a gash on his head. I pulled him out of the car, he was limp as a rag doll and I prayed to anyone listening that he wasn't dead.
-now it's Sam. This-
“One race can’t hurt.” He grinned and bounced up to the car. “Be safe, don’t make me regret this,” I called after him.
"You hardly know me, and you worry like an overbearing mother. You've known yourself your entire life- if that makes any sense. You care about a stranger more than yourself."
"This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe. Does that mean anything to you?" She set the vase down on the countertop.
"Umm... I'm good. Anything else?" He pulled his knuckles from his mouth and looked disappointed.
"The new guy from Africa, Castiel, was wearing a trench coat, so I bought a trench coat too." I heard people chattering behind me.
"No, I'm dressed as a student during finals." He laughed at my joke.
"They seem to get along well," I commented.
"Damn it, Charlie." I cursed under my breath, glaring at her.
"Well, the author used symbolism with the green light to, uh, show what Gatsby wants, but can never quite get. For example, he can't have love, because his meaning of love, is Daisy, and she can't fully love him back. 'Cause of Tom and all that."
"No buts. You're a disgrace. A blemish to our family name. Just look at yourself. Your hair, your clothes, what you do- you're lucky I even give you a pot to piss in! Imagine- if your mother could see you-"
My test came back with a 94%.
I'm the best, aren't i?
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yikes."
"Family? Wh- SHIT." He instantly became alert and scrambled out of the armchair.
Slut!
"No- you're wrong. He's not dead, he can't be, check his pulse again!"
Two weeks later we spoke again.
"Ugh, I thought I was gonna puke the whole time, I was so nervous." He leaned back a little bit, wary. "I'm fine now."
"Well, you are already out." She offered.
"Please just don't. I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna think about it, all I wanna do is be with you." I turned to face him and saw his expression change from hurt to something new. He leaned forward and put a hand on my knee. For a second, I was putty in his hands, and I leaned forward too. but then I caught myself and pulled back. You can't be with him, Cas is your unattainable green light. His face went to an even more hurt expression.
Anyways if it hasn’t done it already, shit is about to get lowkey homophobic because you know, the 60s :) (totally forgot to tag period typical homophobia or anything I’m definitely doing that right after I finish bothering my readers)
I grabbed at his shirt, now darkening with a stain of crimson death.
Sam shuddered and shoved his hands in the pockets of his tuxedo. "I hate this song."
"Brother, I don't know what to say. Hanging out with a greaser is risky, but bringing him home? You're just asking for it." Michael sneered. "Especially a Winchester."
"My parents wanted me to be socialized."
"Things about pretty eyes and nice legs."
"Most people just take the crown and go..." Mr. Singer couldn't stop me. I was on a roll.
"It is a heavy burden to bear the truth." He said wisely.
"Cas I'm sorry they did this to you." I wiped at the paint, smearing it on the tissue I brought. I shoved the red-stained paper into my pocket. "That's a bit better, huh? Sorry, we're giving you such a shabby funeral, it's just that we're not exactly the class vote for 'best couple' or anything."
"Then who-"
"Your Man Candy, stage right." Sam shoved me in the direction of Dean, at the snack table.
"lot of blood."
"Yep."
"Dude, that's Ms. Mills," I said.
"Where's the back building?" I looked around, wondering if I was looking in the wrong place.
"So why didn't they keep homeschooling you?" Sam asked.
"CAS!" I screamed my last steps towards him faltering. "NO!" I screamed. I caught him falling and I sank to my knees. I hugged him tightly, staining my shirt. "Oh Cas, baby no, don't die, don't die, don't you dare, nononononono Cas honey, it's okay Cas, you're okay. Please be okay, stay with me please, Cas. CAS! NO!" Salty, bitter tears streamed down my face and I let out a scream from deep in my stomach as if I needed people to hear the pain I felt.
-your fault.
"So I heard you guys won state. Congrats on winning the tiebreaker, by the way. Sounds like you did good. " He said, fingering his crown protectively.
"Just let me finish, I'm almost done. I swear. I apologize to everyone who got hurt by the Burn Book. I've never actually been to a Spring Fling or anything like that before, and I realized how we all get upset about not winning. You all look like royalty. Really, Cole Trenton, your outfit looks amazing. And Hannah, your hairdo must have taken hours. It looks great. So... Why is everyone stressing over this thing? It's only plastic." I took the crown off my head and held it in front of me. "Why couldn't we just..." A thought popped into my head and I smiled as I snapped the crown in two. "Share it." I broke it into smaller pieces. "A piece for Michael Weiners, partial Spring Fling King." I tossed him his crown piece from the other end of the stage.
I, on the other hand, had no idea what teenagers did. I came as a zombie, with unattractive makeup and that rotting, ready-for-brains look.
"A what?" To me, a slice meant pizza or pie, not a person.
Noticing the malice in her voice, knowing how things can get dangerous quickly, I turned over the coffee table and shattered the modern glass top, then dragged Cas to his room.
"Uh... Thanks? I think your eyes suit you better."
I went up to Ms. Mills after class and apologized to her too.
Ok I figured out the notes issue it’s all good but I also stayed up to post another chapter. I swear I’ll watch 15x20 I’m not using this to procrastinate the inevitable end of the show I promise ahah
I sat down at my first-period class with Ms. Mills.
-Cas is dead because of you-
Charlie smiled. "That's the back building. Right, Sam?"
There was no time to argue with him, so I kept running with Sam in tow. We got to our house, and waited in anticipation, for Cas, the socs, or even Dad. I was putting shoes on over my bandages when the phone rang.
"DON'T BRING HER INTO THIS!" I shouted, tears welling in my eyes. "DON'T YOU DARE, YOU BASTARD!"
"Boss machine, Gabriel," I said sarcastically as I patted his parent's station wagon.
After class, he came up to me.
"Bye." Charlie and I called after him.
Dean takes a shower because he's sweaty from all that non-murder or some shit, and we find out that the Mark of Cain was really a magical temporary tattoo. Maybe it stays on really long, maybe Dean doesn't shower very often, who knows? Cain was a party magician in his spare time I guess. But why was Dean so stab-happy? Castiel figures it out quickly. Dean's so murdery because of hormones. Because Dean is...
Do I need to summarize this? Its all in the chapter title.
"Who cares?" Popularity didn't seem very important to me
"Really? You'd do that? No hard feelings?"
"M' French's not good, you speak English?" I slurred, leaning towards him drunkenly.
"Charlie, it's Dean Winchester. I'm in Paris, I have been for a while, I mean, I live there, but anyways, what are you doing tonight?" I started when Charlie picked up the phone.
"Who're you drawin' Winchester?" Michael sneered from beside me. "You're smiling so much, someone oughta think you're gettin' married to her."
A few weeks later, when hangovers were a distant memory, I went out to another party with Charlie. We stopped at this swanky old gin mill near Moulin Rouge. I went to go get drinks when I saw him. The man in the trench coat. I unconsciously smoothed out a wrinkle in my shirt. I took a breath and walked up to him. Charlie taught me a few more ways to start a conversation, and I hoped my French would be better than last time. I couldn't understand them, but they seemed to make sense.
"Oh, that's cool."
"Uh... I guess I'll go." I caved and Kevin high-fived everyone again.
"Hey Castiel, we don't do this a lot, so it's kind of a big deal, but I think you should sit with us. Every day for the rest of the week."
I handed Lucifer a blue and yellow nutrition bar. "They've got this ingredient that isn't allowed in the US yet. It makes you lose weight really fast."
Spaz. "-and face me-"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I do not!" Michael butted in.
"Dean Winchester, that greaser?" Another asked.
-Mom too-
Sam’s face lit up. “Can I?” he pleaded. “I know what to do, it’s good practice for getting your driver's license, and we do need a driver. Please?”
-it's always your fault-
Chuck goes to fucking therapy now, Charlie and Stevie resume their domestic bliss and get to ride off into the sunset or whatever. Sam and Eileen resume their reasonable adult relationship and vow to never wear party city wigs when they get old.
Hey y’all! This is just a sweet chapter I like, but I think the natural stopping point for the summer is gonna be the chapter after this, and hopefully by the time I return to posting, I will have finished. That’s absolutely not happening, but it’s nice to hope. I also hope you all enjoyed this chapter.
Cas sneaks out to go to the Mathlete State Championship
On the next test, a 67% score slapped down on my table with a note. 'Not your best.'
"He's only fourteen, dear god, he can't be dead! Don't be dead Sammy, I can't lose you too." I dragged him back, Jo and Benny met me halfway across the track and carried him away.
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Kansas High School Mathletes State Championship." The announcer boomed. "Let's start the competition. Here is the first question. Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71. What are...? Lawrence High?"
With Lucifer's blessing, I now talked to Dean more and more. On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.
so then Dean calls up jack or new god or whatever that fucking deal is, and reminds him that “hey, your adopted father is in super-venti-macchiato hell because he’s a fruit, so since you’re god, can you just undo that real quick?”
I kicked a rock down the sidewalk, lost in my own thoughts. We always stayed at the library until they kicked us out, then I'd say goodbye to Cas. I called him that now. I don't think he's ever had a nickname before. He's pretty different, and I like that about him. He's got something about him, that I just can't put a finger on.
"Your father's not here. We're at my house." I looked around, noticing I was sitting on a flower print couch in a typical suburban living room with lace curtains, a brick fireplace, and a china cabinet, as opposed to the Winchester household furnishings of sagging couches, stained pillows, and secondhand chairs, accented with empty beer cans and full ashtrays.
(Apologies for the rant that ended up being longer than the chapter, which is already super short)
something. You said something about teaching me French."
"Is your muffin buttered?"
"-Pushed him in front of the bus-"
Yes, It can get worse!
He hastily gathered his pencils and book and started to shove them into his bag.
She broke away from a conversation with Gilda when the man tapped her on the shoulder, carrying me, red-faced, sweaty and drunk.
I prayed that the loud clicking and dinging of the typewriter wouldn't wake Cas, but soon enough, he was awake too. He strolled over to the desk and leaned down to kiss my neck.
"What's that smell?" She wrinkled her nose.
"He's headed for the projection booth!" I called from behind.
"He's not interested. You can leave now." Meg shuffled away with a glare, and I started to walk to Sam and Charlie. "Why don't I know you?"
"'Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?' is the worst line I've ever heard." He laughed.
She opened the cabinet under the sink. "Why is my tribal vase under the sink?"
(See the end of the chapter for
That night had brought a host of ideas, images, and scenes. I wrote furiously, as the mental dam of writer's block began to crack, a flood of words rushed to my fingertips. In small black letters, I created colorful skylines and went night adventures, hosted wild parties and composed lively music. Dresses and suits swished around a dance floor as waiters circled with trays of colorful drinks. The sheer chaos of a party slunk into the room as I created a world of colorful debauchery.
"He lost a-"
"He'll never know. Our little secret."
Freeloader. "-like a man!"
I had so many words left for Cas, though he couldn't hear them, but so little for Michael.
Sam scrambled to regain control of the car, and I shut my eyes as I heard a loud scraping and screeching. I opened them just as Sam lost control for good, and the car slammed into the concrete pillar supporting the highway.
"Oh hi, here to buy some drugs?" She asked.
"He what?"
"I'm painting you. Why else would I face away from the city?" He sighed. "Now go back to writing, you've moved too much already."
I edited out the part about Janis/Charlie being made fun of for being lesbian, because that's so 2004.
-it's your fault-
"Je rêve de tremper ma baguette dans ta soupe."
I rounded the corner to see Lucifer kissing Dean.
"He told me," Lucifer said smoothly. "He tells everyone. It's kind of cute actually. He's like a little kid, he draws all over his notebook, CN + DW in a heart and all that. He has this t-shirt he made, it says 'I heart Dean' on it and he wears it under his clothes all the time."
"That’s boss, let's meet at the park on the corner of Maple Street and 3rd." I didn't want to wait around any longer for anybody to show up, so I tied my shoes and left with Sam.
nurse cas to the rescue
"Je veux te baiser, ici, maintenant." He gracefully moved to me in a way that wasn't quite falling or sitting, just sort of moving, as if he were pulled by an unseen force.
"So what'd you get on this one?" I asked.
"It wasn't a soc if that's what you're asking," I said harshly.
Mr. Singer stood in front of the room asking questions to the students.
We filed onto the stage and sat at our seats, on opposing sides of the Marymount boys.
(See the end of the chapter for
"J'aime quand tu gémis comme ça." He purred and grinned. "Je vais embrasser chaque tache de rousseur sur votre visage"
Ok so I’m putting the notes at the beginning to say this is like the first big tw for homophobia, if you didn’t get that huge addition of tags I put in, but these kids throw around slurs like I throw... I can’t actually throw anything very well but the point is there is a lot of slurs and stuff.
"It's Halloween!" I replied through fake blood makeup on my lips.
"Dean! Oh I was so worried, you stayed and studied longer than usual and Dad came home early and I was worried a soc jumped you and you were dead or something awful happened!" He blabbered at lightning speed.
"Incorrect. If Mr. Novak can answer correctly, we will have a winner." The announcer said through the speakers.
"You're not in it," I lied.
"So what is the symbolism of the green light?"
"Okay, um, did you sit in a pile of sugar? 'Cause you have a pretty sweet ass."
I’m thinking I’ll be posting chapters I’ve saved up until it gets to a decent place to leave off for a few months.
Oh god. That's me.
Kevin buzzed in. "14 and 5."
"Not much, how are things running with you?" I gave the signal for Sam in a ski mask to run down the hall. His hair peeked out the bottom of the mask, but I hoped Dean wouldn't notice it was his brother. Sam snatched my backpack out of the hand I carried it in.
Edit: I fixed the notes issue, I believe. :)
Car lights splashed over the wallpaper through the thin curtains.
"Really? Tell me your best line." He challenged.
"Did he say why he broke up with you?" Gabriel asked, dumbstruck.
I glanced around the room to look at the people when someone caught my eye.
The crowd parted like the Red Sea, and I felt more awkward than ever, surrounded by dresses and tuxedos while I was in a baggy jacket and jeans. I tentatively jogged to the stage and took the plastic crown and the microphone.
He threw pots from the sink in my direction, bruising my arms and clattering on the walls.
I caught a glint in his eye that gave me that word vomit feeling. But not word vomit, more action vomit. I quickly leaned over and kissed him. He lingered in the kiss, then pulled away.
"Dean was that one of-" I brushed away his hand. He's your green light, don't bother.
"I said, you might not want to order another. You're very drunk, and it's late."
The strange thing about hanging out with Lucifer was that the meaner he was to us, the more we wanted him to like us. We all knew hating life in the God Squad was better than not being in it at all. Being in the God Squad was like being famous. People just knew things about you.
Coach Lilith and Crowley stepped away from each other quickly, laughing nervously.
"He's dead."
"After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie. In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round. Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent. Lawrence, who do you select?"
Howdy howdy howdy I’m back surprisingly early, don’t get too comfortable with that, if you’ve been following my updates you’ll know that school is stressful and always will be, and this week is no exception! Anyways, I’m very proud of this chapter, I think it’s short but sweet.
heyyy... i’m baaack... I know it’s been like a month sooo... sorry. But hey, what is a holiday season in 2020 if not a hyper-condensed series of traumatic events? I didn’t even get any writing done I just cried a lot during finals :)
"Hypothetically if it goes bad, Gabe might find himself hypothetically in the same situation as Luci. Hypothetically broke up with a Winchester and hypothetically broke a bone or seven." I started to think he wasn't speaking in a hypothetical sense.
"Cas, you okay?" I whispered, gently shaking his shoulder.
"Good enough. Class, turn to the page written on the board..." I shot a glance at Cas, but he didn't see me. I sighed and pulled out the drawing. I crumpled it up and shoved it into my bag. He's your green light. You can never have him, no matter how much you want him. So forget it, and maybe you won't end up like Gatsby. Sad and lonely, only you're not rich.
"What are you doing? You broke up with me!" Dean said, facing away from the doorway I stood in.
"Does that mean my line was good?"
We cheered for Sam as loud as we could, while the Garrison cheered for Luke.
"Um, I care." Sam gestured to himself. "Spring Fling king and queen automatically become head of the Student Activities Committee, which I'm an active member of, so yeah, I care. And I cannot stand to see him take the funding from drama again. I'm in tech, too."
"I understand, Luci, wait for me!" Michael trailed off as he chased Luci out of the cafeteria.
Ohohooo I am so behind on writing but anyways here’s another chapter, and in spn filler episode fashion Cas is conspicuously absent. Again. He’s just vaguely out of town. But the next couple chapters are more focused on Dean’s development as a character than to his relationship with Cas. Even though that’s probably what you all came here for.
"Is that your natural eye color?" A tall, long-haired guy in a lot of layers of plaid looked me in the eyes as he turned around in his seat.
"Uh okay! I've got to sit with my friends because promised I would, but I'll see you tomorrow."
"Ah, yes. Well, I say we start with the pickup lines since you need a lot of improvement there."
"Dad I was-"
"We're sneaking in?" Sam questioned.
"I love it when you talk like that," I whispered and ran my hands through his messy hair.
We lingered to chat after school.
"Anything to ruin that bitch."
Sam makes Rowena and Crowley go to group therapy to work out crowley's mommy issues and Rowena's A+ parenting. They got together an killed the therapist but it's okay because they made hell super productive.
"Damn Africa, what happened?" Kevin looked at the score.
"I slept well." I tipped my head up and kissed his cheek. "And I'm also very sore, so no more biting, mon beau petit ami." I gestured to a group of bruises and marks on my neck and chest.
I kissed his sweet lips and slipped in a little tongue, making him moan quietly. I put my hands on his waist and leaned in a little. He cupped my face in his hands and tilted his head, leaning in, intensely, moving in a sort of rhythm, a rhapsody in almost every sense of the word. A euphoric, epic, poetic symphony. He was one hell of a kisser.
I survived my first three-way phone call attack.
"We are?" I sniffled
I turned to my left and began to pull out some paper when I felt a finger brush where the red mark was.
Hey here’s a finale hot take that’s totally unrelated to the story:
” He gestured to me like I was some stain to clean, or a strange bug to squash. “Like you, live under my roof."
"Oh, you are? Then you're- what do they call it..." My dad spoke calmly. "Grounded. You're grounded, Castiel."
“Check his pulse!"
"You are such a good friend, I can't believe Luci would do something like that. You deserve so much better." I buttered him up and inflated his ego effortlessly. Jackpot. Now, all we needed was for Dean to catch Lucifer in the act.
"I'm sorry, I-"
"Nah, s'okay. M'friend Charlie can walk with me. She's the redhead." He carried me around to every red-haired girl in the bar until we found Charlie.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Birds do it, bees do it," the singer's words flowed.
"Un café au lait, s'il vous plaît," I sat at a table on the street, watching the people stroll by.
"Cas, you shouldn't punish yourself forever." Ms. Mills said.
We stepped out of the house and walked down the street. We walked in solemn silence for a long period of time, not wanting to break the quiet. We turned onto Main Street and I ducked my head. A group of girls walking by suddenly dropped their chatter to a low whisper.
And they just bring back Cas its the bare fucking minimum Jesus fucking Christ.
Hey remember when killing god was the most stressful thing happening?
Castiel's place was littered with brushes, palettes, pencils, and paints. Canvases hung on nearly every surface, and every desk and table was strewn with art supplies.
He took it and stuck it into his hair. "I'm the princess."
I picked up a plate and threw it at his feet. "FUCK YOU AND FUCK THIS HOUSE! FUCK YOUR RULES! I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!" I screamed.
"It's not a crush, back off," I lied.
I slammed the door behind me and stormed into Charlie and Sam's scary movie marathon.
"You were a Mathlete in freshman year." Charlie wiped off the counter and raised her eyebrows at him.
"I don't know, I don't like to spy on him."
He mumbled and clung to the baggy shirt he lent me. I scooted under him so his head was resting on my chest.
"It's raining."
FUCK CANON FUCK MY SLEEP SCHEDULE FUCK THAT WHOLE “I don’t own any characters in supernatural nor am I affiliated with the writers” or whatever I’m sure as hell not affiliated with the writers but the characters are MINE now I wrote them and it is shitty headcanon hours up in the notes babey!!
"Hey, I'm totally lost, can you help me?" I wasn't lost.
“I’ve driven before, I just want to do this one race.” he gave me puppy eyes.
"Turning in my quiz." I placed the paper in a stack on her desk.
Dean realizes he 's crushing on Cas and John Winchester is a dickbag. What a surprise.
I set the flowers beside the headstone that read, "Castiel Novak, July 10th, 1940 - May 13th, 1957" it also read, scribbled over that in red paint, "FAG" and "BURN IN HELL, QUEER"
I felt his chest rising and falling as he breathed, and when it slowed to a restful pace, I kissed the top of his head and fell asleep peacefully.
Hey! Last post for a while, it’s chapter 20, a perfectly round number to leave off on. It’s been fun to write, but I’m officially taking a break now. Just for the summer, this is goodnight but not goodbye. Sorry if it’s short, but I hope you all like it.
"Will he make it?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Luci, wait!" Michael followed him like a puppy.
"I've seen it, it's a little weird, but who can blame him? You're gorgeous." He brushed Dean's jawline with a finger. "I'm not saying he's a stalker, but he does keep a Kleenex you used so he could do some African voodoo shit with it. He says it'll make you like him."
"A lot," I admitted.
"Yeah, like that."
"Please, just leave him alone." I could hardly hear him when he dropped his voice just above a whisper.
"Where'd that question come from? You writin' a book?" He laughed. "Well, sure I guess, it don't change my life that much. But, are you trying to say somethin'?"
"Sure you can, anyone can dance." I moved to the record player and changed the record to a waltz.
-okay, he'll be oka-
Michael was arrested after that night and was now doing 9 years.  The courts believed his accident story, and gave him the minimum sentence. But the whole town knew what really happened and nobody did anything. Not even Dad. He hardly looked at me, an when he did, there was just hate in his eyes.
Ew it feels like it’s been forever since I posted. Just a little filler chapter pretty much :/ I mean like not really but it’s super short.
"That's real nice Cas, but not right now." I tried to pull him off, but he flopped onto my stomach, making me grunt. "Cas, you clingy son of a bitch."
"Those bitches." She sighed.
"Oh god," I whispered.
We went out the doors at the end of the hallway and stood in a grassy area behind the school.
He moaned contentedly and I started to unbutton his shirt a little and leaving marks on his neck and just below his collarbone. He started to pull up my shirt a little, but I touched his hand to stop him.
"Can I get you something to drink?"
"Look at me when you're talking. Stand up straight. I'll treat you like a man when you start acting like one."
"He's hot. Like, hotter than Lucifer."
I looked in the mirror and straightened my black tie. I put on a worn, thin sport-coat and ran a comb through my hair. I grabbed the bouquet I had saved up for and headed to the living room.
My blood boiled at the thought of Dean being with Luci, while Luci was cheating on him, but I played it cool.
I huffed and crossed my arms, but truthfully, I hadn't been treated like this in a long time, and I didn't really mind.
"Look Cas, I- I can't do this to Luci. It's just not fair to him."
"Heavy stuff," I whistled.
His eyes were fluttering wide, and then he kissed me back, and I just melted. I ran my fingers through his soft brown hair and tasted honey on his soft lips. I pulled him onto my lap and he wrapped his arms around the back of my neck. He smelled sweet and made a little noise when I sucked at his bottom lip. I worked my hands up to his back and untucked his shirt, running my fingers along his skin. It was soft and smooth and I took it all in with every sense. It was heavenly, divine and sugary, and I loved every minute.
I looked up through the tears and faced Michael.
"Hey Charlie, I didn't know you worked here!"
"Dean, I'm fine, it's just a splash."
I sat in my apartment by the telephone.
"I saw him do it. He pushed Lucifer."
“He’s gone, Dean”
"Not in the slightest. I'm coaching you in flirting."
In which Castiel ruins everything. With everyone.
you are all gonna hate me so much
"We choose contestant Novak."
"..Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And then one fine morning—
"OK, if you even knew how mean he really is. Did you know he cheats on Dean? Yes. Every Thursday Dean thinks he's doing SAT prep. But really, he's hooking up with Kelly Klein in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because ...I'm such a good friend."
"Let's find out who the lucky lady is. I'm sure she'd love to find out about this." He waved the paper just out of reach.
"He was broken. We have to fix the problem or remove the broken part entirely." He stared down at his brother's body with a cold look of indifference and almost disgust.
"But dad-"
"Well first, teach me your name. I'm Dean Winchester."
I sat down next to him. "It was a lot of effort for a stranger. But I think
I kneeled down next to the fresh dirt patch.
I hung with the hunters, and we fixed cars together, but it wasn't the same. A depressed gloom hung around the shop, and Gabriel had just stopped coming altogether. Benny seems like I betrayed him because I didn't tell him earlier. Sam hardly talks, and it occurred to me that this is the only time he's ever seen someone die. He doesn't remember Mom at all. Kevin still visits the shop, but less often. He and Charlie don't ever bicker like they used to, and Garth seems so much less lively, and Jo seems tired all the time. We've all been weighed down by Cas' death. The hunters were falling apart.
"Sure it's not." He looked at my drawing. "My brother? Guess it wasn't." He tossed the paper back at me.
This is how Lucifer was talking to Dean for me.
, my social life really took off after then. Lucky I'm so popular, I'd hate to be some loser with foot cream all over his hands!" He waved his hands around for emphasis.
"You disrespectful, freeloading piece of shit! Get up! Face me like a real man! You're a sad excuse for a Winchester!" He grabbed the back of my jacket and pulled me to my feet, throwing me into a cabinet. I slid down the cupboard door and fell onto my hands and knees.
"Oh hiya, Sammy..." I drawled. "What happened? Oh god, is he still here? Cas you gotta get out and take Sammy and-" Cas put a hand on my shoulder, noticing my panic.
"An ambulance is on its way"
"I'm an artist. Or, I'm trying to be. I haven't really found my next inspiration, and without having any art to make, I'm not exactly an artist."
I glanced at Charlie, who gave a thumbs up.
You guys are gonna have to ignore the shitty writing and grammar and the weird lack of paragraph indentations.
Sorry I went AWOL for like... a month. School has just been back to back stressful projects and the weekend has just become an extra work day and a day to recover, so I’ve been in my worst writers block slump of all time. I kept thinking I’d post when it got better, but it really hasn’t gotten any easier. Anyways I have a sort of posting “schedule” that whenever I finish a chapter, I post a chapter, so the next chapter could be... a while. Basically the theory is I’ll have a buffer so that I don’t run out of chapters, but it really ends up being insanely long hiatuses in the between mundane chapters because there’s a difficult scene five chapters later. Trust me these next few chapters are really good, although it leaves you guys with some very dry posts every time I get around to posting. It’s weird. Sorry.
He sat down on the bench by the side of the street.
Garth stepped over the back of the chairs noisily and plopped into the seat on the other side of me. "What's buzzin' cuzzin'?"
All of a sudden, one of the Garrison came up to Charlie. It was Alfie.
"I'm not sayin' anything," I said shortly.
"Yeah, I'm gonna call you Cas." She said.
I sat down next to his grave, careful not to sit over his body. It just didn't feel right to walk over him. Something about the fact that his body was really under there. It was really six feet underground, but it felt like much less. I pulled out a battered copy of The Great Gatsby and a crumpled piece of paper. "It came to me the other day that you never got to finish the book. So here we go..."
"Say it, dad. Say it to my face. To you, I'm just a freak, a creature who lurks in bars and alleys, a defect of society. I'm not. I'm a human, a brother, a friend, your son. I always have been and always will be. " My heart raced. "So why should that change because I'm bisexual?"
Lucifer wasn't in the projection room. Instead, Coach Lilith was making out with someone.
(See the end of the chapter for
Suddenly, the front door swung open, and my father staggered into the kitchen, slightly drunk. He dropped a bottle on the floor with a shatter, and the sweet honey smell was overpowered by the stench of cheap beer.
-is all-
"You could catch a cold! You could get sick and die." He gave a resigned sigh and took off his trench coat. I draped my jacket over his shoulders like a cape and carried his coat over my arm like a towel.
"I think he does it for attention."
Goodbye Dean. You're gonna hate me forever after this. I stood up, and things seemed to move in slow motion. I took a breath and let out my word vomit. This time, for good, not bad.
"Hmm..." I chewed my lip in mock thought. "Nope, don't think so."
He shoved me back down to the floor, and I shouted as my head hit the table, then it went dark.
"Well, be careful, because he has a huge crush on you." Lucifer grinned smugly.
The lunchroom was crowded, packed with what seemed like thousands of people. I clung to my little blue plastic tray of peas, a carton of milk, and some fried things that were supposedly meat. I picked my way past the tables Charlie had listed out, and was stopped on my way to her and Sam by a short, dark-haired girl.
I rounded the corner at a strolling pace, taking in the city of Paris in all its glory, rainy and picturesque, as it should be. I paused at a newsstand to glance at the papers. Moving down the street, I stared at cafés on the street and pharmacists' signs. I stopped at a café and got a seat outside, under the awning.
The Marymount boys conferred.
"I like it because it's the same in every country and every language."
For kids, Halloween is where you dress up scary, or as a character from a movie or something, and then you beg for candy to puke up the next morning. For teenagers, Halloween is the one night a year you can dress up like a total slut, and nobody can say anything about it. Some people wear lingerie and animal ears and call it a costume. Mainly this is girls, but Gabriel, defying gender norms like a pro, opened the door in a skimpy see-through dress and mouse ears.
Later in English class, we discussed Julius Ceasar, the Shakespearean play, and I knew. We cracked Michael Wieners.
Okay, so after this post I’ll be taking a break from posting for a few weeks because of holidays, finals (especially my biology final, where I’m fermenting alcohol :) I’m fairly certain it’s legal, but if I get arrested that’s how I know the experiment was successful.) and the fact that I can’t write as fast as I post. I don’t know if I went on hiatus at the best or worst place, but unfortunately for you all it’s a big cliff hanger. But if I never update this, I may have been arrested for my illegal bootlegging operation. Maybe I’ll see you next year, good riddance 2020!
"Nah, you guys are friends. He doesn't have to know, anyways."
"Yeah. Ready as I'll ever be."
"Yes I know, you've told me that a million times. Anyways, I'm doing this LARPing thing in the park tonight with Sam and my army. Why don't you take a night off your double life and come to the Kingdom of Moondor?" Charlie suggested.
"Oh, Luci gave me some cologne."
The credits rolled on the movie and we piled back into the station wagon.
"The limit is negative one." He answered.
"Cas!" I shouted again, this time in fear. I ran, feet slapping pavement, heart pounding too fast.
Later, I got a 98% on the test and a 'Nice job, Castiel' from Ms. Mills.
"Kevin, you're small, so you and Samsquatch get to be our secret passengers." Gabriel passed them back.
I was a man possessed. I spent 80% of my time talking about Luci, and the remaining 20% waiting for someone to bring him up so I could talk.
“Somebody’s gotta race for him.” Kevin sighed.
"My bag!" I yelled and pointed in the direction Sam ran, also towards the projection room. Dean sprinted down the hall, determined to get my bag. I smiled and ran after him. He sprinted to the auditorium.
"That's almost as bad as mine." I sat back onto the bed.
"Yeah." I wasn't really. I went home to work on my costume.
"What's the God Squad?"
"Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit?" Sam pointed at a woman in a colorfully striped vest and wiped his hands.
"Hey, you made it! And you're a zombie."
I walked around the party, thinking about how Lucifer was putting in a good word for me with Dean. How could Charlie hate Lucifer, he was such a good-
"I promise."
"Really? How do you know?" Dean's eyes widened in surprise.
"You haven't been drinking?" He asked.
“No, Sam you’ve never done this before, you’re fourteen, you haven’t gotten a license. I can drive.” I worried.
Heyy I’m back after yet another disappearance :) I took a break during finals to put more effort into studying, and I’m taking another break for the summer and plan on taking a few breaks this coming year because I’m moving out of my hometown and want to spend the summer “living in the moment” and not worrying about updates. I know this isn’t a super convenient place to disappear for a few months, but I hope you all will stay interested, because there is more to come.  I have like six chapters left to write and only a week left in school, so I don’t think I’ll be able to get it done in time. Sorry :(
"He's really creepy and into that voodoo crap, but he's my friend, so promise you won't make fun of him?"
"No-" my voice faltered.
When we had smuggled in our extra viewers, we filed out of the car and took seats near Jo and Garth. I went to the concession stand to bring snacks for everyone else.
Michael jumped in. "Wow I love your coat, it's so fetch!"
Just like that feeling of being so happy your heart jumps out of your chest, like a cartoon. I stopped for a minute and dug my hands into my pockets. What was it? It's like feeling a little sick, a little warm and a lot nervous, but you like it all. A tug in your gut that says 'He's different. This one's special'. A little skip in your heart that makes you jump a bit. A little feeling called love. Love.
Wrong. I clung to the toilet bowl as I puked out my hangover "cure"
"STOP IT! Dad, stop!" Sam's distressed, barely teenaged voice rung out over the abuses being shouted in and out of my head.
"Cas I want you." I tilted my head back lazily.
"The dude in the middle." Someone whispered.
"No feet on the seats, dig it?" Gabriel turned around like a mom reprimanding unruly children in the car.
"Dean! Sam!" He yelled back. "I escaped them."
"That is correct! Lawrence High School is the winner of the Mathlete State Championship!" The team cheered and jumped and high-fived all around me. My face glowed with a huge smile as members of my team congratulated me.
"And that's Michael Wieners." Charlie pointed. "He's super stuck up because his dad invented humanity. He knows everything, about everyone."
Suddenly, the music changed to a song I recognized, for once. It was Heat of the Moment by... Not Europe. Or Africa. That's that song by Toto that I definitely know. Oh- Asia! These old bands used too many continent names.
"We're going to my place, we have work to do."
"Oh god, oh god, oh my fucking god what do I do, he's dying, he's gonna die, I can't lose another one, I can't, I can't!" I sobbed
"We've just got to think outside the box, and figure out better ways." Charlie waved her hands as she talked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hate was all I got. The Novaks had "politely" asked if I would refrain from coming to the funeral. And if I came, they'd "politely" ask for the police to come and give me a "nice and friendly" ride to the station. So we held our own little funeral a bit later.
"Nobody understands me!" Lucifer yelled like an angsty teen as he stomped away.
"It's okay Cas, you're okay." I hugged him closer and he sniffled into the shirt.
Blood rushed to my face and pounded in my ears, my stomach dropped to the floor. Jealous rage was a new feeling for me and I hated it. I hated Lucifer too. I hated him!
"That's not true! It's not! It can't be!"
Hi. I think I disappeared again. Looks like the last time I posted was… June. Oops. Turns out I don’t get any work done without deadlines, and without work, I get insanely bored, so I got really excited to write again, then school killed that. I’m in a huge writing block, and all my creative energy is going towards creative writing classes, and I’m not bold enough to write fanfic in class. Writing is a slow process these days. I’m insanely busy all of the time and I have no idea how anybody gets anything done ever. But I recognize that I dropped the ball on this, so here’s an apology chapter, I’ll try to stay more consistent.
"So Castiel, what do you do?"
"It's not really required to make a speech." Mr. Singer said.
"He's cheating on you!" I blurted out.
We gathered in our usual lunch group, sans Dean. We all exaggerated sympathy with little gasps and tuts that suburban mothers use when gossiping.
"And your Spring Fling King, future co-chair of the Student Activities Board and winner of two gift certificates to Biggerson's Sizzlin' Grill & Bar," he paused "...is Castiel Novak! Where is Castiel? There he is."
"Well,
"I like math."
"Why do you even like him?"
"Cas- Cas wake up. Cas your family-"
"I know the feeling. I'm trying to write a novel, but I think I've hit the biggest writers' block of 1926."
Its spring fling and an epilogue of sorts
"They'd better hurry."
"They're all blue, that's the brand logo color." He sighed and continued searching among endless rows of blue plastic bottles.
"When we were 13, she started this petition, saying Charlie was-"
"Thanks for your advice, Sam," I said dryly.
I sat up and limped over, trying not to put pressure on the bandages covering cuts on my feet and hands.
"...Fetch?" I was pretty unfamiliar with American slang, but that seemed more unusual than most slang.
"Contestants, find the limit of this equation."
Castiel, Charlie and Sam mix crack and talent shows.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's supposed to be like that, Africa." Kevin showed me how he wore the sleeves. "Alright, let's bet those Marymount sons of birches."
"Oh sure. I'm actually surprised how you don't seem mad at Michael. It was pretty bitchy of him to do that."
"It's not looking good."
When the cars were ready, Jo ran out into the track, bandanas in hand.
I laughed. I looked over to see Gabriel talking to Sam closely. Sam seemed to be complaining about the song, as Gabriel hung on to every word like he hung on to candy. His current choice in sweets was a small red lollipop.
"Some hunter told him about Kelly Klein." Lucifer sighed and pouted. "I gave him everything! I was half a virgin when I met him."
Oh god. Oh my god! Dean friggin Winchester, what the hell was that?! Nonono. No. That's not it. That's how everyone feels. No, it isn't! Son of a bitch, I'm not- no, no way in hell. Okay, so I've got a crush, big deal. Except it's on a soc. Not only that but on a soc guy! And god, what a dreamboat. Shit! I can't be- I can't even say it. I mean, I felt like this when I asked out Lisa, but I feel like that with Cas. But I guess I can like both. That's okay, right?
i can't remember the name of those mini hotdog things, but just think 50's food. green jello and spray cheese, but slightly nicer.
"C-A-S-T-I-E-L." I spelled out rhythmically.
When Cas had left, Sam wandered into the living room and looked into the kitchen to see me and Dad in a sort of silent argument, neither daring to say something first. Like the calm before the storm, we were two clouds, wordlessly daring the other to start the tempest.
Also unrelated I just found out that the notes I put in the beginning chapter show up in all the chapters?? Sorry I’ll fix that ASAP, but if I were you I wouldn’t trust me because I’m a liar.
Just remembered a fun fact about the very early drafts: going into this fic I was very into dark academia and there was going to be a plot about Cas finding out one of his teachers murdered somebody. There’s still a few remnants of that like the poetry book is supposed to have belonged to Akobel and Lily Sunder and there was the whole Lily Sunder Has Regrets plot line on the show. But I threw that out early on because it really doesn’t fit the vibe anymore. It would be weird if there was a murder mystery b plot to a coming of age romance (or whatever I’m doing)
"It seems like you understand it," Dean said after class. If I wanted to do this, I was going to have to commit.
"Coolness," I said.
"He's de-"
A raised red area stood out on my right cheek when I looked in the mirror that morning.  I could cover the bruises on my chest and back, but my face was hard to hide. I could just keep my head down until school ends, and hope a teacher doesn't notice. Shitty plan, but it's worth a shot.
"Wow. What'd you say?"
like honestly I can only do so much a self indulgent fix it fic is meant to patch a hole, not rebuild the entire story even I have my limits and there was definitely an mpreg thing in the first chapter, which shows just how far I’m willing to go. Even I have my limits.
"Oh! I think it's more than just hanging out and bringing him home, is it, brother?" Michael cackled "You're really in for it now."
"Yeah, he's cool, I invited him."
"This isn't your business, Sam. Go to your room." he scurried off, but I knew he was still listening. "As for you, Dean..." I looked down at my bedraggled clothes in shame. I had broken his trust twice now. And with a boy. Another boy. The same boy. Son of a bitch, I was gonna get it. "I told you, again and again, not to break my trust, not to leave Sam alone, not to- not to be doing this!" He gestured with disgust.
"Almost too well..." Dean narrowed his eyes with comical protective suspicion.
I went inside and milled around with all the slutty people in lingerie and animal ears. A dirty blonde head squeezed through the crowd, and a freckled face with football stripes on his cheeks appeared.
"They're these weird Swedish nutrition bars." I explained. "My mom gave them to kids in Africa to help them gain weight."
Meanwhile, the votes were being cast for Spring Fling King. Sam was calling out to anyone who hadn't voted should do so now, or forever be stuck with that person in charge of the school activities board. Votes for Lucifer were cast because of his casts from the accident, and votes for me were cast because they thought I pushed him into the bus.
And everyone is super fucking happy and Cas and Dean are openly dating and Dean can say he's bisexual.
Tw for implied/refrenced physical abuse and slight memory loss
But I wanted things to move a bit faster. I started a conversation in math.
I shifted in my seat, then ordered a few more drinks until I was half-seas over. The romantic, twanging, swinging sound of jazz guitars and pianos filled the room.  The saxophone warbled mournfully as I finished a third, possibly sixth drink. The man sat on a bar stool a few seats away. I started to wave over the bartender for another, and then he spoke to me.
"I would enjoy that, Dean." He said with a sunny smile.
Sam was going faster than Luke, swerving around corners pulling ahead for the beginning, but then Luke hit Sam’s bumper, denting the new metal and scratching the paint. Sam accelerated forwards so quickly, he was on two wheels for a second. He hit the ground, making the car bounce and the trunk and hood flap with the impact. Luke started to pass Sam and edged him further off the track. Soon, Sammy's car was completely on the slanted wall of the track. He and Luke drove side by side, tilting towards the lower part of the track. He tried to turn back into the flat track but hit Luke's car. The two cars made a horrible screeching sound as Sam pushed back to the road. He pulled out ahead, making a sharp turn, and spun out of control.
I pulled the gate shut behind me as I entered the small courtyard. It was more of a small square of concrete floor that was uncovered by apartments and was surrounded by walls. Staring up at the sky I saw clotheslines connecting the sides of the court, lacing from window to window in a mesh of drying clothes. I glanced at the butcher shop with a chipped yellow sign painted on the wall, thinking how I still hadn't gotten used to the sight of cooked ducks hanging in the window. The floor had a puddle of summer rain around the drain, which was now growing as it began to drizzle. I turned up the narrow and creaky staircase that wound around the courtyard so small it hardly counted as a courtyard. Unlocking the front door of my new apartment, I stepped inside. Hanging up my hat and coat as I went in, I sat at my desk for a minute. I looked around the room, a few boxes were left to unpack, but for now, I had to write. Nothing came to me. I moved to Paris to write my novel, but I wasn't getting anything. I am a sorry son of a bitch, I thought to myself. I'm in the most beautiful place in the world with beautiful people, beautiful music, and I can't think of a single word to write. I put my hat back on and went outside. I creaked past my neighbor's place, and the landlady leaned out the window.
Ok I promise this is the last one before I go to sleep, but I might start doing like... fun facts?? Idk like weird things that happened or didn’t make it into the fic over the past year I’ve been writing?? Idk just thinking.
"You never treat me like anything more than a pile of shit," I mumbled, instantly regretting it.
Adam got rescued from hell finally.
"You're broken! You're wrong in the head, and you're gonna straighten out or I won't have you under this roof."
I felt the word vomit building up again. I tried to swallow it down and shut up, but then-
