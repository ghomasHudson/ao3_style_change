He got carried away in his thoughts watching his sub on the screen. He would need to speak to Mycroft at the nearest opportunity.
The detective dropped his head, blushing further at the sight of his trussed cock.
Mycroft leaned forward and tipped his brothers head back with a finger under his chin. "Yes. To an extent. Does John scare you?"
"It's not a problem, Mycroft. You wanted me here anyway."
He glanced down at his caged cock and nodded. He had thought that had been a dream. The whole caged again thing.
“Of course, Doctor Watson,” she nodded on her way out.
Greg walked in and crouched in front of Sherlock's snarling teeth. The boy seemed out of control and he had no idea what had set him off.
"No. You are not my responsibility. And I have long since stopped giving a crap about you."
"Is that what you talk about in your end of the world meetings?" the detective asked.
Sherlock had never told his brother about Irene and the riding crop, all he knew about was the drugs.
Together, they entered the building and made their way towards the courtroom. They stopped just outside.
Sherlock didn't know whether to be grateful or not for being able to see his brother. From the look on Mycroft's face, he was thinking the same thing.
That figures, John sighed, he had to keep reminding himself how inexperienced with proper BDSM ettiquette Sherlock really was.
Greg shook his head. "Fair point. There were more than a few raised eyebrows."
The detective nodded. Anything was worth a try at this point.
It was now 10 o clock and John was still riding the dildo chair. "Master," he panted. "I'm sorry."
"I won't be going anywhere anyway. Mycroft isn't here."
“Hm? What?” Greg looked around and caught the detective looking in his direction. “I have no idea, unless… I mentioned the baby to John. Maybe he said something to him.”
“Well, sir, I... I damaged the curtains,” he said, slightly unsure.
“Problem?” It was clear Rita was only confused.
The knock on the door jarred the little boy from the bed. “Uncle Mycie!” He ran through to the living room in his pyjamas and threw his arms around Mycroft’s legs.
The fact the detective had apparently given up completely made John pause, but he couldn't tell if it was genuine. He tossed his shirt into his bag. "No. If you want any hope of this ever working out, explain what you were asking."
John knew, even if Sherlock ignored it, they had made some progress so far that morning. He unattached the rope from the cage, but left it so it was still wrapped tightly around his fingers. “By coming here you’ve admitted you want help - need help. Why did you sign the contract?” he asked at the snarl on Sherlock’s face.
“Now!” John barked. “And you’d better get back to addressing me properly, you’ve already added 20 to your tally today and now that is an extra 5. That corner is the least of your worries.”
John saw the traffic first and glanced at his watch, it wasn't right at this time of day. It was far too busy in this part of the city.
“Hello to you too, Sherlock,” Greg’s voice was the usual, calm yet threatening without changing at all.
The brothers didn't speak for the remainder of the flight. They were too concerned about what they would find back home.
Sherlock frowned, then it turned into a scowl.
John was getting more and more concerned, Sherlock's behaviour had definitely improved over recent weeks but this was weird.
“What happened, Sherlock?” The Dom repeated. He would get an answer, even if he had to force it from the sub.
Sherlock hmphed, but it sounded contented somehow. He enjoyed taking care of John and he didn't get to do it nearly often enough.
The government nodded, with a knowing smirk, “One would think so.”
John clipped him on the back of the head, ignoring the idiots over by the wall, he lightened the blow by laughing softly. “I had Mycroft show me how. Now shut it.” He pulled him down so his head was under his chin.
Mycroft just had toast, but he was glad his brother was actually eating something.
Sherlock dropped to his knees, and bowed his head submissively. Stay calm, make John happy. It couldn't be that difficult, he'd done it before.
"It's a coffee, Irene. Do get over yourself." John glanced down at Kate, wondering how she stayed so... within the lines that seemed to be forever changing with Irene as a Domme.
“But they can’t all be up there.”
He disliked her touch immensely, even more than the pain. There was nothing more he wanted than to pull away from her.
“Sorry, sir.”
Sherlock didn't do anything but glare at the older man.
“Same rules apply as last time, pet,” John said softly.
The Superintendent was still blushing furiously. "Thank you, sir."
“What?”
Sherlock felt completely pampered and loved and couldn't be arsed to cause trouble. He didn't need to, he had all of John's attention.
Sherlock tried to move away from the machine, but of course he didn't succeed.
"No." Sherlock gave himself a shake to dispel his childhood memories. "That's one thing she never did."
Sherlock glared up at him, with a clear huff through his nose.
"What? No, I... You-" Sherlock's face was red and flustered.
“I can’t find your brother, he’s disappeared.”
"No!"
Sherlock was relaxing slightly beside him. He began to settle into the fabric of the furniture rather than avoid it as much as possible.
John's eyes rolled back into his head, his master's prick still down his throat as he was filled oh so completely down below.
Enjoy!!!
“Really, sir?” his sub’s expression lit up at that and John couldn’t believe what he was seeing. Did he want to be spanked? He daren’t push it, he thought, as he took a seat and patted his thigh. The sub laid himself over his lap and shifted so the pale flesh of his backside was in the perfect position for the Dom to lay down his hand. The doctor didn’t miss his hands creeping to the pillow and wrapping around them tightly.
The doctor knew he had fallen asleep, his breath hot against the Dom's suit trousers. It was always likely with subs during aftercare, they drifted to a sleep to calm themselves down. That was why he had a few books in the drawer beside the bed.
“I will pull the plug on this contract, despite what I said the first day about ending it in 3 months, if that is what you really want. One word, boy, that’s it.”
“Good boy. I’m going to knock 5 off of your punishment tally, pet. It’s gone down to 36.”
The two Doms dragged the pair of Holmeses into the house.
Sherlock’s arms wrapped around the pillow he had automatically grabbed and he nodded into it.
John went back to the rest of the buttons and Sherlock couldn’t have helped if he had wanted to as he slipped into subspace and lost the control of his arms. John worked the pyjama shirt off one shoulder then the other and placed it under the pillow. Then he ran his hands over Sherlock’s pale chest pausing to tweak at his nipples slightly.
"Yes, sir," Sherlock whispered.

The doctor recalled his blow job, Sherlock had a very talented mouth, specifically his breath control, he had deep-throated him far way passed the norm of a sub in a position such as Sherlock's. His tongue had been passionate too. In fact, it had been one of the best blow jobs he had received. There was room for improvement, technique specifically, but overall John was rather proud of him, like he had made a point of repeating since they’d stepped out of the shower.
“It appears I must continue your education before the obviously needed conversation. I use a tally system to keep track of misdemeanours which I don’t think require immediate attention, such as a lack in respect or cheekiness or a certain level of disobedience will be counted up. At 7pm each evening you will come and find me wherever I am and whatever you are doing. You will tell me the number for which you need to be punished for. You will ask for your punishment and thank me for it, like you did tonight. Your tally for tomorrow evening has started. I will not necessarily keep count, but if you lie to me, I will know. Now put your head in my lap.”
He crawled over to the corner and knelt up, his hands once more going to his neck.
Sherlock was off guard the moment they entered the familiar room. Why weren’t they heading upstairs? Wasn’t he overdue a beating by now? Or at least a ‘paddling’ as this Dom preferred. He knew it would be worse than the first day. There was no way he would halve the amount of times the paddle would fall this time. This was also the second time he had broken out. A second offence so close to the first would mean a more intense punishment. When thinking this through last night he had thought through all the likely consequences he would face and he was sure it would be 40 with the paddle, twice the amount it should have been the other day, instead he was knelt in the kitchen. Again.
“Being a Dominant does not give you power,” Mycroft hissed. “Submissive’s do that.” He wasn’t angry for himself, he was angry for Sherlock who was still being held by John. These were two he hadn’t known about, well he’d known the name Ben, but he hadn’t known what it was short for. Benjamin? Benedict? Or something else. He didn’t have enough data to dig into back then and he hadn’t even had the resources to be able to conduct a thorough investigation.
“You'd better lose that look on your face because as you can tell, your cock is caged and that sound deeply locked inside it won't let anything come free. If you behave and lose the attitude I might milk you tonight.”
Greg chuckled warmly. As he continued humping his boy, he gently bit Mycroft’s shoulder. The resulting moan just made the Superintendent’s cock harder. “Ahh, look at you all cute and complaining.”
The doctor ignored him.
The sub knew he wanted a response. “Yes, sir,” he whispered.
"Why would you do that?"
The boy gasped as his cock was released and John blew on it briefly, eliciting a shiver.
John picked Sherlock up when they reached the stairs. He wasn’t about to remove the cuffs from the boy. He put him down at the top. “Crawl,” he ordered simply.
The whole while Mycroft kept shooting him obscure glances.
"Quicker!" Eurus yelled.
"You don't have one in your flat?"
“Wash it.”
It was a strain, he was already somewhat uncomfortable but Sherlock slowly put his hands behind his back, John reached over and joined them together, all while Sherlock was still sucking on his fingers.
The pair of them ignored him. It was clear what Mycroft was trying to do, but they weren't going to fall for it. He would have the same attention Sherlock had. Nothing more, nothing less.
The government official picked the little boy up. "Let's go upstairs and talk to your fathers, shall we?"
Mycroft sighed. “He’s been called in to testify.”
"No, sir."
Both Anderson and Donovan shared worried glances, this could go very wrong very quickly.
Sherlock's frown deepened and John sighed, stepping back.
"That's not unusual," John noted, "but you kneeling here like this in the middle of the night is."
John snorted. "You're boring when you're professional."
Thinking of his Dom, the sound of footsteps running up the stairs announced the DI’s arrival.
Sherlock barked a laugh at that; his brother, sulking?
"No. Not right now."
Sherlock's face looked resigned, but the two Doms didn't trust it. The brat had spent the majority of the day with that expression on his face, the rest of it he'd been pissing around.
“Shlock sad.”
“So he won't be in his shirt and trousers?” He asked, recalling what the boy had been wearing when he had been arrested.
Eurus was leant against the other cross. She looked at Mycroft with her odd smile. "Ms. Adler is good at what she does. Jim said she was the best."
With a fair amount of encouragement Mycroft climbed up onto his Dom’s lap.
“He wants a good me,” Sherlock responded. “A good old me. I can be one or the other. Not both. And that one made John want to leave. That can’t happen, Mycroft.” He ducked his head as John appeared.
The Superintendent reached over and spun Mycroft around so he could see the view. "Your brother is damned hot, isn't he, pet? Just think of the people who would pay to see this."
Sherlock jolted and sprung back from the Dom as the door slammed open and 5 people charged in. The only thing John paid attention to, though, was the detective as he gagged when his collar snagged on the leash that still tethered him to the ground. John felt another rush of guilt flood over him. He had basically tied him up and handed him over. He moved quickly to release the leash to at least attempt to prevent further injury and the boy shuffled into the corner backwards as fast as he could.
John made sure he was thorough enough so damage wouldn't be done to the boy, but not too thorough that there'd be no burn. It was discipline after all.
Mycroft had to stop himself from pouting. "Yes, sir," he moaned. Mycroft squeezed his eyes shut as the Superintendent fiddled with the cage.
Sherlock looked at him with wide eyes as he calculated how heavy the weight was.
But before he was done, the boy was lunging at Siger. “Grandad.”
“What are you doing here, Mycroft?!”
“So Moriarty took my shoes...” his head was spinning with how long this must have been planned. “He took my shoes months ago to frame me.”
John nodded once, satisfied with that. “Go on then.”
The detective’s phone buzzed. He pulled it out of his pocket, only to confirm the text was from Lestrade. He shoved the phone back in his pocket, ignored. He was determined to spend the day with his family.
“Come here.”
He set about fingering his hole. Poking and prodding it slightly. “About time you had something back in here. I've been very lenient with you as of late. I won't be making that mistake again.”
Sherlock growled and John’s whole demeanour suddenly changed. It was as if the growl was a switch and John had had enough.
“Mmm.”
“Yes. And?”
"Hold his arms in place," John ordered the older sub, "whilst I work the rope around them."
“Correct. I did. I punished you that way to make a point. The fact you were uncomfortable was not the issue, but helped to reinforce my point. Now, stand up.”
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock sighed, lowering his head.
John moved around in front of his pet and used the handle of the flogger to prod at the clamps on Sherlock's bollocks.
“Did he let you run off on your own searching for that?” He used his umbrella to point at the suitcase in the detective’s hand. “Fetching colour, I wouldn’t say that it suited you though.”
"Much like you do."
“I thought we were going to the gardens, sir?” Mycroft asked after a while.
John smiled at his boy and went to retrieve one from the rack on the wall. Sherlock was still holding the headboard when he returned and he didn’t let go despite the apprehension running through his muscles as the Dom pressed the bar between the cuffs already in place.
John let his eyebrow raised. "If there was a problem, you would no longer be submitting."
The detective sighed, “Sorry, sir.”
Finn nodded but went to Siger instead.
The cabbie almost looked disappointed when he lifted the pistol he had held earlier. “You can take your fifty-fifty chance, or I can shoot you in the head.”
The doctor rolled his eyes. "Well would you like to come sight seeing with us?"

Sherlock realised Irene was speaking again and thought on her words. That sounded like a compliment. Was that a compliment? This was when he really needed John to translate human statements such as that. It would help with his response.
Mycroft dropped to his knees immediately.
John smiled, running his chin across his hair once more before releasing him. He held his hand out, still remembering just how much Sherlock appreciated it, such a simple thing. A warm hand found his and he tugged gently towards the stairs. “Come on, then.”
He untied his leash, and led him to the stairs again.
"No, sir," he shook his head.
“Try anything tonight boy and you’ll find yourself cuffed tomorrow night.” The doctor finished what he was doing and ruffled the younger man’s hair, caught off guard he didn’t have a chance to pull away and John smiled.
"Yes, sir."
“They are going to the Yard, pet,” Greg only now intervened.
Quickly, the Superintendent snatched off all of the pegs, one after another, leaving Mycroft's cock throbbing.
“Nothing! Sir,” he added after a moment.
“He's an intelligent kid who has run rings around Doms for years. He even runs rings around Mycroft. Very few people are capable of that.”
"I didn't tell you to stop either."
When the Dom had Sherlock tied down to the bench, with many more straps and buckles than he'd used before, he heard Sherlock sigh. He hoped it was content, because it didn't sound like frustration. The detective was left looking upwards and his ankles were uncomfortably held to the bench.
"No!" Greg barked, making John look over at him. "We started being tough on you, we come here and give you a break and this is how we are repaid."
Sherlock gulped so loudly that the Dom heard it from his relaxing position on his bed. His shoulders hunched up, hiding his collar behind his shirt as he turned around; well and truly caught.
“I have,” he grumbled.
John nodded. Not the greatest of answers, but better than what he had been expecting, considering.
Now, there was no time for playing. “I’ve got a friend on his way over, pet,” John said as he entered the room.
John found the largest dildo they owned that could be used with the machine and attached it. He lubed it up, then he worked some lube into Sherlock's hole.
“He used to lock. Him. In. A. Cupboard?!” John hissed, livid. How could anyone do that to a sub let alone one so perfectly innocent as Sherlock. Of course John knew he could be a bugger but that did not deserve that treatment, not at all.
With practiced ease, John removed his sub’s feet from the bench and cuffed them together. Then he pulled his feet up to meet his hands and used his belt to keep them there.
The doctor had his stick resting up against the chair as he folded his arms, looking highly unimpressed. “I wasn’t going to, no. I was going to offer you a cuddle and a little relax before we need to get ready, but after that attitude, I think I will. Go and kneel in the corner.”
Greg smiled, but of course the government official couldn't see that. He turned on his heel and glanced at Sherlock. "You do realise your boy is watching mine, right?"
The Dom quickly set about removing his current day plug and replacing it with one close to the size of the mounted dildo down in the kitchen. He knew his sub was biting his lip at the burn as he eased it in, neither fast nor slow.
John nudged the Superintendent on the shoulder. "What do you reckon that's all about?" He jerked his head in the Holmeses' direction. They couldn't hear what was being said but it was clear it was an altercation of some sort.
John could clearly see what Sherlock was thinking. “I might let you if we continue with what I have planned or I might not. If you make me punish you, there won’t even be hope.” He knew that was warning enough. Sherlock wouldn’t come without permission, not again.
Sherlock twisted his head to the side and winked at the older Holmes.
Finally John managed to get 3 fingers into the boy’s hole and knew it was enough to progress further into the scene, into more interesting events.

"Makes him an arse in my book."
At that, Finn looked at Sherlock and smiled. He liked being called trouble if that meant he was like him.
Sherlock nodded.
"Finish your beer before it gets too warm," John told him, handing him the neglected bottle of beer.
"I didn't think so." Greg collapsed back in the chair he had sat in minutes before. "Kneel up straight, lower your head and do not move."
John cleared his throat, but Sherlock ignored the interruption, “-having to remake it,” Sherlock finished. He wandered over to his bed and flopped down, sighing loudly.
He ducked his head as the shorter man raised his hand and ruffled his curls. “Wrong country. Good alibi.”
“How long have you been knelt for?” He was angry at himself for not paying more attention to his sub.
It was nearly 10 minutes before John joined him, typing in the code. Sherlock still didn't understand why he wasn't allowed in the room on his own. It wasn't like he planned to go out the roof again.
"Watch it, mate," Greg called back. "If you give him too much of that stuff he'll be bouncing off the roof."
John glanced up as he lined the dildo up with Sherlock's hole. "I'm not so sure you mean that, boy." He flicked on the machine and looked back down as the dildo disappeared into his boy again and again.
Siger laughed. "Either that suit or another one."
Aware that if he argued anymore he was more than likely to lose the offer of half his punishment now. Again. He would not fail at this twice.
Greg ran his hand roughly over the government official's head.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock quietly admitted.
? He had done it earlier when apologising, but that was under rather strict guidance from his Dom. Judging by Sherlock looking away awkwardly, he hadn’t responded, just had that entire conversation with himself in his head. “Sure,” he said for nothing better to say, after all, to those puppy dog eyes, he couldn’t say no.
“I’m sorry, sir,” he offered the DI immediately.
“Everything alright?” John asked.
Sherlock bent to pick her up. "None of that, now, Rosie. We'll both be back Sunday, you know that."
“However, this is part of the contract. Now I’m not just going to suddenly decide to take you over my desk whenever you’re in reach. I hope by now we have established enough of a bond between us for you to realise that, but you know how this works, eventually.”
"Sir, I don't-"
Sherlock recognised the sound of his brother's footsteps as he approached and let out a sigh.
"Me neither. But Gregory got me into this. There's so much going on all the time that even I didn't notice it all the first time I watched it. You'll see."
“I'm going to give you her name in a moment. If you know her or have had any contact you must tell me at once. I will not have what happened last time repeat itself.”
Sherlock watched as John caught him up, 30 yards from the water. “You don’t run towards the sea, Finn. Not without telling me or daddy or uncle Mycroft first ok?”
“Like I've just said, you have an hour, would you like to spend it in your lab?”
“Why not?”
Maybe they had turned the corner, in more than just the discipline sense. Sherlock had never shown much interest in the sexual side of the submissive/dominant relationship. The thing was, it was one of the primary functions of said relationship, yes, there was the discipline, the respect, the caring, but play... Playing was huge.
As he thought through ideas the door clicked quietly. Looking around to make sure he was unobserved, Sherlock slipped through the door and shut it behind himself. When he turned around and looked inside, the detective was delighted to see it was indeed bigger on the inside.
Sighing, the younger man dropped to his knees. Now that was a surprise, he had expected to have to repeat himself.
Greg chuckled and John laughed outright.
He unlocked the door to the playroom, his grip on the boy’s arm unrelenting. He dragged him into the corner of the punishment side of the room and used the tip of his cane to make the detective’s knees bend. He hit the floor with a thud and a growl.
"Sir. Please, touch me."
"On your knees, boys,” Eurus ordered.
"My brother was just bu- He was talking about something he knows nothing about. It doesn't really matter."
Sherlock suddenly felt very nervous. He was sure Eurus would take her fury out on them, but instead she reached up and unhooked the cuffs from the ceiling.
"Do you want a minute alone with him?" Greg asked.
John raised an eyebrow in the direction of his sub, what was he up to?
“Wait.” Sherlock whimpered slightly and stopped, regaining his balance on one foot. His shoulders tensed, but he didn’t pull away. His arms went out to the side as if he was expecting John to grab him.
This Dom also used a tally rather than throwing him over his lap at every opportunity. It was a lot better than it used to be, but now he had to wait for the punishment in the evening. It was also loads better than living in constant fear as to when he might be hit next; it had always been when he least expected it.
"What is it, little brother?" Mycroft asked, sitting beside the younger Holmes.
John laughed inside his head but kept the strict Dom persona where his pet could see. So Sherlock didn’t want out... it was something else. Again. He didn’t care right now. He would deal with Sherlock how he’d told Greg he would. But this would be the last time Sherlock took off, or the contract would be void immediately. Once or twice was one thing, the third time had been understandable given the reasons but now...
“How do you know that?”
“Yes, he gave me permission,” Sherlock lied. “I am just going to stay here for a bit. I need to-”
He glanced down at his cock. "But, sir-"
Irene looked over and slapped him, hard across he cheek.
The blond nodded once. “Can you pull over?”
“I think Greg is building something with the girls.”
John gathered up a mug of tea, milky and sweet the way his boy liked it and placed it in his hands. “Drink, pet, we'll take as long as you need.” He kissed him again. “You've been such a good boy for me today. You're forgiven for last week, ok?”
The Dom contemplated cuffing him, but thought with the amount of compliance he was getting, there was no need, at least until he came out of Panic fully. Sherlock’s head remained on John’s lap as he ate bite after bite without complaining.
His glance at Mycroft still hanging from the ceiling renewed his efforts to be good. If they were perfect, Eurus' temper would be aimed at Irene.
"Oh you do."
Ok, so I've had the question 'why is he running again?' A few times. We will find out, maybe not this chapter, maybe not the next but Sherlock will tell us
The Sergeant closed his eyes and stared at the latch for a moment. “I'll see to it,” came a well known female voice from up the corridor. He hadn't been expecting that and by the look on the guys face outside the cell, he hadn't either.
Mycroft closed his eyes. "I didn't mean it. It just-"
The Dominatrix tugged on his cock, causing him to step dangerously close to the edge of the stool. It tipped a bit, and Sherlock had to step back despite the discomfort.
John shook his head, smiling and pushed the last few nearly cold chips into Sherlock's mouth.
When he was within reach, Greg reached over and snagged his sub's hair. "Cuffs," he demanded, holding out his free hand.
Greg smiled into the mirror. "We're glad to have you. Besides, I don't think it would be a good idea to split the boys up right now."
Sherlock looked to him in surprise at that, he was in really bad trouble, why was the Dom taking him to the den, that was where they went when he had been good.
"I do suppose running off whenever he wants slows your progress somewhat. Fancy a coffee?" Irene asked, indicating the nearest coffee shop three doors down from where they stood.
When Sherlock obeyed, she ordered him to pick it up in his mouth.
He took the detective’s clenched fists and brought them round behind him where he attached the cuffs. Then he straightened his palms and fingers out, sighing at the little crescent moon shapes his nails had left behind. He pushed his palms together behind him with his fingers facing down and his thumbs sat in the crack of his arse.
Not receiving either permission or a command to stop, Sherlock looked up at John, water trailing over his face and droplets clinging to his dark lashes. He looked like a half crazed angel.
Both subs flinched.
Finally, finally, Eurus called out, "Stop!" She pulled on Sherlock's arms. "How many, little big brother?"
"I don't understand."
With a few long strides, Sherlock had crossed the living room and plucked his phone from Finn's grasping hands. He looked at the phone for a long moment, then turned to John. "This is one of those things that should be done in person, isn't it?" He didn't sound all that happy about it.
“I’m going to collect something from my study at the end of the hall, when I return we’ll practice rule one.”
"Let's go through to the den," John offered, passing Mycroft his brother's crutches and picking the detective up in his arms.
The younger Holmes jerked the door open to glare at his brother, wearing nothing more than a towel. "Why are you here?"
“Um… well.” He brought his hand up and rubbed at the back of his neck awkwardly.
He had run free of John and collided with a few men in suits. Sherlock, at first had believed them to be his brother's men, but he had been thrown in the back of the van that had been parked in the alley and that wasn't something Mycroft's men would do through fear of dying painfully.
Irene came striding in wearing form fitting leather pants and top. "Eurus has given me a free hand for an hour. I thought I should dress for the occasion." She looked down at herself. "You've already seen my battle armour, Sherlock. This is what I wear to truly break a man."
A new day dawns
The doctor backed up, still holding onto the detective. He collapsed onto the bed and Sherlock fell with him, whimpering again.
“You haven’t touched your food, boy.”
"Yes, sir," Mycroft sighed.
"Yes, John, sir," Sherlock said as he leaned forward and stole a kiss.
“Oh.” Finn hopped up and ran over to Mrs. H. “Here. This is for you.” He dumped the oyster shell in her lap, looking extremely proud of himself.
“I'm not Mr.. Holmes. I save that crap for Mycroft.”
"No. You're his boyfriend for a reason."
"Oh. Do you now?"
The Dom began gently humping his boy's arse. It wasn't urgent or frenzied, but slow and insistent. Mycroft found that nothing but frustrating and his growing erection was pointless where it was squished. He let out a frustrated groan.
Slipping out the front door, he counted down inside his head until the powerful stink bomb he had prepared went off innocently hidden in an experiment. Hearing the cry of disgust from downstairs, he dashed away down the street only to stop when he walked through one of the things. The now-familiar sensation still made him shudder. He ground to a halt and followed the thing for a short distance. He wanted to examine it. He hadn't been able to get near the things the last few days because John wouldn't allow it.
Mycroft watched on, waiting for the inevitable deductions that came from watching TV with his baby brother, but they never came. However, it wasn't because  Sherlock wasn't watching, he did seem focused on the show, just not inclined to air his opinion on it.
“May I have the cushion, sir?”
Sherlock let himself be carried across the room. He loved being in John's arms, but didn't complain as he was put down to the floor. He kept his eyes to the front, despite wanting to watch what his Dom was doing. He wasn't going to ruin things now.
Mycroft settled himself gracefully on his knees in front of Greg. He was up for the challenge. Leaning forward, he licked at his Dom's cock, teasing it until it started to fill out again.
“Yes, I am. I’m in charge of you. Not anybody else, just you. That doesn’t mean I beat you up for kicks and then leave you to ‘drop on your own. It also doesn’t mean I can go out and order every sub to kneel in front of me. Because the only one I can punish for not doing so is you.”
John paced the room for a long while, looking for inspiration. Hoping for an idea to strike. He knew one thing for sure, the boy needed to be naked. He paced for a while longer before eventually stepping up behind Sherlock and detaching the cuffs. “Strip.”
“What?” Greg asked, his tone sharp, he was still unimpressed with his sub’s performance earlier in the day, despite now running his own fingers through his hair.
“Then I’d rather not say.”
Another blast of air seemed to be an answer in the affirmative. Stunned, he leant against one of the supports that were dotted around the central console.
“Of course.”
The detective was surprised when John took him to the bed on the play side of the room rather than the punishment side, but he put his head in John's lap as he laid out on it all the same.
The sub’s head went back to looking out of the window, this time the other side seeing as he was still on the blond’s lap. He was clearly content not to reply to that.
"This isn't fair!" That time it was Mycroft who argued.
Sherlock settled back on his knees and stared at his hands. He had the sudden urge to run them all over John, to touch him everywhere and make him feel good. Somehow he managed to refrain from doing so.
“Well, you weren’t today.”
Sherlock was laid out on the sofa in Baker Street. His hands were pressed together beneath his chin as he gathered inspiration from the ceiling.
At the sound of Mycroft’s voice, the detective flinched, trying his hardest not to bite down on what was in his mouth. That would make this worse.
John began winding the length of rope around his thumb, middle and little fingers systematically. He tightened it up then threaded the length of loose rope between his legs, attaching it to the base of the metal around the sub’s cock. Sherlock whimpered.
"Is that a yes or a no?" John prompted.
Eurus frowned at him and walked around to crouch where his hands were cuffed. She ran her finger up his arm.
"He's got a point, Mycroft. I'm all for keeping him out of bother but it's getting obsessive."
“Answer the question, boy!”
She glanced from the sub across from her to the other Dom. “Excuse me?”
“You won’t be doing it once.”
Sherlock ducked his head and stared at the floor. He didn't need to be the world's only consulting detective to know it was the same one Irene had used all those years ago.
“Now, what happened the last time you came without permission, Sherlock?” John was still stroking his cock, he'd gone as far as to tug him around by it, so the sub was knelt up in front of him. He ran his thumb over the head, precome beginning to escape.
The Dominatrix hesitated. "We were business partners. I knew him well enough to know not to cross him."
“I am going to punish you like never before.” It was a fair warning, but he should have already known. He really did deserve this.

It was 7 minutes later when there was so much as another sound.
Mycroft couldn't risk moving without hurting himself further.
John tossed the cage to the Superintendent, then looked back over his shoulder at his boy. "Anything to say about that?"
“No. At least I don’t think so.”
Greg watched the kneeling detective for a moment before nodding once. “Well Mycroft? I think it’s time to come out of this silly mood. Panic won’t do you any good.”
“I got accosted by Mrs. Hudson.” Greg picked the little boy up and hugged him. "Have you been taking care of John and Sherlock?" he asked.
"And Mrs. Hudson can stand in as your mum. She's been more of a mother to you than that woman ever was." Siger smiled at Martha, hugging her around the waist with one arm.
In next to no time, John was back holding his boy and the two now arrested Doms were against the back wall, their arms pulled back and cuffed behind two poles for suspension bondage when the building was used for its actual function.
John shook his head sadly, it was time they talked. “Give me your wrists.”
“No, sir,” he shook his head.
The older three stayed outside the den for several minutes before returning. Greg wasn't as mad at Mycroft after he'd heard what the government official had wanted, but that could soon change.
"Yes, it is." John grinned, proud that he hadn't had to tell his fiancé that fact. “But he was there when I proposed the first time.”
Greg winked at John, delighted with their secret plans.
Finn jumped up and down, excited.
The doctor thought about that for a bit. "Well- What does it say about me that I don't like it?" He threw himself down on the bench and covered his face with his hands. "I am so messed up."
This time, the older sub swallowed around the lump in his throat, he could only imagine what that would have been like, even for a boy like Sherlock: hell. He shifted slightly to let one of the officers unlock the cuffs and pulled his mobile from his pocket. Worry dawned on his face, but he smothered it out and then smiled at his little brother, Sherlock needed him more right now. “It's alright. My men have him now.”
Sherlock looked back and forth between the two men. He leaned over and whispered to John, "I don't want a spanking tonight." He blushed furiously. John tried to imagine what Sherlock was about to ask for that had turned him so pink. "I just want to cuddle and then have you fuck me long and slow."
"Alright. I'm going to take the plug out now, but you have to keep behaving."
Sherlock was knelt beside John at the table, feeling distant. The routine so far this morning had been identical to yesterday. Well, John’s part of the routine had been identical. Sherlock had decided that sulking when his Dom arrived at 7 was not the best way to go to the toilet. He also didn’t bother tugging at the cock cage when he went to the loo and let John wash him without a fuss. Because of this, his tally was only as low as 7, surprisingly small given the preceding days events.
“Well?” John repeated. “It’s entirely your choice, Sherlock.”
“Inside,” John ordered sharply when Sherlock refused to cooperate. He may have crawled yesterday, but he was in the after effects of Panic. It didn’t really count. No way was he going to just crawl at this Dom’s whim. “And if you even think of standing up, this punishment will be like nothing you have ever experienced before.” Okay, so maybe he had underestimated how mad he was.
“Seeing as you’ve had Dom’s before and you are not a virgin, I know you have been penetrated before.”
"I can only assume you failing to address me correctly is a desire to be punished? More than your current predicament."
John kept pushing down until Sherlock’s head touched the floor. “You aren’t to move without permission at all, is that clear, pet?”
The sub was about to respond with a snarky comment but retained it quickly at the last minute. “I apologise, sir,” he said quickly. He wished John had been there to head him apologise without prompting.
Mycroft let out a sigh of relief. He wasn't as trusting of his sister as Sherlock was for some reason seemed to be.
“Lift your feet up, boy.”
Greg came in carrying the largest thumb of ginger that they had. It had been freshly peeled and shaped.
The doctor didn’t miss the sarcasm in the last part this time either, but he was more impressed by the fact Sherlock had referred to him as his Dom, let alone address him so fluidly in front of someone he clearly despised. It wasn’t muttered or murmured, he hadn’t stuttered or looked away, embarrassed. He was proud of him already and they hadn’t even got to wherever the body was. He could clearly tell that this woman was a sub, he doubted even Sherlock would be that brash, but then again, he looked back at how he had been when they’d first started the contract. His rudeness and arrogance was a seriously strong part of him, but even now in front of someone he had already admitted rubbed him up the wrong way, there was no sign of that Sherlock, not at all.
“Why not?”
"Is he sulking again? Already?" Mycroft asked.
“He'll be fine.”
Sherlock wasn't in the Jacuzzi when they reached the apartment, he was knelt beside it.
Sighing, Mycroft stepped forward and helped him take them off, swapping them over without his bad foot ever touching the floor.
Sherlock couldn't work out why she was turning away to speak. He could still hear her even if he couldn't see what was in her hands. It was easily deducible.
“It was you,” Sherlock continued, unfazed by the man, he was clearly a sub, after all, “not your passenger.” He feared that had this man been a Dom a simple command would have him doing whatever he wanted thanks to John's influence.
“A reward?” his boy sounded confused and the doctor decided he didn’t like it.
Sherlock had ambushed him as soon as he had appeared. Throwing him into the wall and cuffing his hands behind him. He'd practically thrown him at the chair, not pausing to ask for an explanation on his tardiness.
Irene pulled Sherlock back to his knees. Then pinched at his oversensitive nipples.
Mycroft let out an indignant yelp from a few feet away and the pair of them saw Greg leaning over and nipping at his reddened nipple.
"You know what I think." Mycroft turned his head away, refusing to look at her. Enjoy your victory while you may."
“But-” the boy tried again.
John grinned wickedly. "After we have that shower, I have an idea for the ice cream." He grasped Sherlock by the nape and steered him back towards the house.
"Pack it in!" John ordered sharply.
“You heard,” Sherlock hissed, fighting to get to his feet, but John beat him to it, with speed Sherlock hadn’t needed to see in a long time.
His brother looked him up and down. It was evident immediately how Sherlock refrained from running to him and closing the few yards across the threshold to engulf him in a hug.
Sherlock pulled his hand free and took off in the direction of a back alley, clearly somewhere that was lodged in his Mind Palace.
Sherlock ducked his head and closed his eyes. He knew he shouldn't have run off, he knew it was wrong, but he'd done it anyway and then he had been caught by some mad man. That bit wasn't his fault, but John didn't seem to care.
“Another Dom then?” The idea that two of his previous Doms had been petty and abusive angered John, but he forced himself to remain atop of it, for Sherlock’s sake. He was scared enough at the moment as it was.
“But where can I go? You’ve said yourself that I can’t get out of the house.”
“Pet, you are dropping. Now listen to me, okay?” He waited for his pet’s nod of acceptance before continuing. “It was putting my shoes on that did it,” John explained. “Service, that’s all. Nothing bad. You need to do exactly what I say and you won’t go into ‘drop.”
The detective glared at it.
The detective glared at the rope as he was hauled to his feet.
“I meant untie all of me not just that stupid thing.” He stamped on where John had covered the hook in the floor.
Sherlock laughed again. "Fuck you."
The detective clearly saw what he was thinking and he snorted.
“After you,” John indicated the only way they could run, sure his boy knew where they were and how they could get back to Baker Street.
Mycroft sighed. "Not very likely, sir."
"I need to be good for you and I can't."
Sherlock shook his head. “Nope. Finn, pick a bucket.”
Sherlock shook his head, somehow already on the edge, he hadn't come since before he'd been caged. That had to be at least a week? Was it a week? It seemed like so much longer! He wanted to ask John, but couldn't find the concentration to do so. Or find the point, as his prostate spasmed again.
John took the detective’s hand rather than using just the leash to tug him upstairs. It was something the doctor had seen a friend do many years ago, whose sub had been traumatised before they’d found one another.
By the time the bath was finished, the entire bathroom was a complete wreck. There was water and bubbles splashed everywhere. Sherlock did manage to find some dry-ish towels for them to use to dry off with, then he sent Finn into the bedroom to get dressed whilst he used the towels to soak up most of the mess.
“Will you be alright here?” he asked, raising his voice slightly as the coffee table flew across the room.
He was jerked out of his concentration to John slamming one sock-clad foot down on the table in front of him. "Woke up with these on."
With his Dom's permission, Sherlock came, he came so hard he fell onto the doctor on his way back down.
“When he went to speak to Sherlock.” The older Dom got to his feet and went to the window, glancing out to see it the government official was standing around out there, smoking or on the phone.
"I don't know if he will fight and I need to get him fully untied so I can undress him."
“Why aren’t I allowed one?” he completely ignored the term of address he knew he should have added.
"Be that as it may, you aren't putting any more pressure on that leg." He scooped him up, making sure his bad leg wasn't tucked in up against him. On their way towards the stairs John grabbed one of the maids and asked her to find the crutches.
Sherlock was aware that if he had just gritted his teeth they would be almost finished.
“What?” He offered instead.
He ground his teeth as Irene worked it into him. The only thing stopping him from turning around and whacking her was the fact his brother was chained up on his knees beside him.
Benjamin had his warrant card out in a flash. “I really don’t think that’s a good idea, mate. Put it down and walk away. I’ll say nothing of it to anyone, neither will Douglas.”
In the living room, Mycroft sighed. "Fine, but you will let me arrange the details, all to your taste, as my gift to you."
“Tomorrow-”
“What?”
Several hours later they were out on the beach. The two Holmeses walked beside each other so the Doms could talk.
“Aren’t you meant to start the tally, sir?” The doctor laughed and buried his head in Sherlock’s back for a moment before coming up for air.
“Up, pet,” John said again.
“Yes, you’ve done it before, but this is practice and something expected from all subs, especially after living and contracting with a professional Dom.”
"Snap your fingers to safeword, Sherlock," John ordered from the door. When all his sub did was glare at him, he rolled his eyes. "Thought not."
"We had already established it was alright, little brother."
“No, you shouldn’t have,” he agreed.
"I don't know what you mean, mistress." It should be weird calling his little sister that, but everything that had gone on in Sherrinford was far beyond normal.
"I thought we'd drop in at the Yard and see Greg. See if he has any cases he needs help with."
“Yes, sir,” he said quietly.
John stood to the side and waited until Greg was done with his kneeling sub. "Sorry, mate, did you need my help?"
Both Sherlock and Mycroft fell asleep like that, half covering their Doms. It wasn't something that either of them minded one bit.
John sat back on the bed and shuffled up so he could see the whole room. His gaze dropped to his kneeling sub. He thought of tying the now-extended leash to the wall, but he always was a fan of the personal touch. He also liked the idea of being able to tug Sherlock over whenever he felt like it. It would no doubt teach the boy that submitting wasn’t a bad thing. If his Dom was happy the sub would be happy and if the sub was happy so was his Dom.
"You, Holmes one, get up and help us," the Superintendent ordered as Sherlock began to fight them.
"He can go from arse to absolutely wonderful in under three seconds, can't he?" Greg asked, a smile on his face.
"N-no, sir," Greg cursed his stumble as he scrambled over the Dom's lap.
“Can I go to the loo, sir? Please?” there was no point in fighting it with the Dom stood there, and he really was desperate. He wasn’t about to wet himself in front of the blond, especially after letting himself fall into subspace the night before.
“Yes, sir,” he took a deep breath and then dusted off the dirt from his knees.
That, the detective could understand. And he did. He felt lighter when John had said he'd forgiven him. Like they were on a level playing field again.
"Tough shit, I'll just leave him hanging. He's hardly going anywhere."
John was taken completely by surprise, he had 8 counter-arguments at least prepared in his head for when the sub said no and went on a rant about how wrong this was; all now invalid.
Mycroft grabbed it and closed his eyes. He glanced at one of the guards. "Have you got some cuffs?"
“That's quite an achievement, for your age.”
“Well you know what I think, don’t you?” John was hoping Sherlock wouldn’t reply so he could and put a few words of his own to this irritating woman. He had only taken one glance at her to know she wasn’t someone he wanted to spend any more time with than strictly necessary and he definitely understood where the detective had been coming from in the car.
John had already got another length of rope and a weight. He was about to show his boy just how uncomfortable things could get.
So… Sherlock had been caught… again.
They already had drinks out and Mycroft had clearly deduced the menu for the 3 of them.
“I could also tie you up in the playroom. How about that?”
“Doesn’t every sub know, sir? Isn’t it common knowledge?”
The woman frowned and Mycroft had to step in. "Sherlock, pick four."
The simple fact that Sherlock was clearly ok, but hadn't first addressed his Dom, but Mycroft's pissed John off. He had thought Sherlock knew better. Had thought he understood the way things worked with him.
“It’s weird, sir. It’s like I am, but don’t want to be.”

Their conversation broke off when John glanced down and spotted Sherlock knelt, head low, a few feet in front of them. John was sure that even had the DI not cleared the room when they’d entered, Sherlock still would have had the same response.
There had to be somewhere he could examine the things. He pulled up his Mind Palace to search for the closest university. They'd likely have some useful technology. With a gasp, his eyes flew open. He immediately changed direction and headed to Regent's University at a run.
John could tell Sherlock was right on the edge of orgasm, so he pulled off before he could tip him over. Looking up, he saw that his boy's eyes were screwed shut and he was biting his lip.
Irene drained her glass of wine and stood up, approaching the brothers. "Junior here always fascinated me. He acted to resentful of big brother, but he really just wanted his praise. I suppose they're the best of friends now." She grasped a handful of Sherlock's curls. "I want to see just how much you care about him."
The doctor turned and gripped the boy by the neck, just below his collar. "I've had enough of the attitude, fail to address me correctly again and it will be an extra day in your current predicament."
Sherlock stopped fighting, he knew his brother was only trying to protect him.
Sherlock took a few deep breaths, his hair still in John's grasp. “Are you going to milk me again today, sir?” He didn't feel as ashamed as he thought he would at asking that question. He braced himself for the answer, sure he wasn't going to like it, but he needed to know.
“No, sir. Please, sir. I'm sorry.”
"I did apologise, sir," Mycroft grumbled.
“Have I teased or tormented you since you’ve arrived?”
"Yes, sir," Mycroft whispered in response. He wasn't sure how long it would be before he at least tried to get away from the no doubt heavy strikes.
The two Holmeses realised they needed to still and be quiet for a moment. They certainly didn't want Eurus' wrath turned on them.
"He's convinced being himself is what upset you and made you want to leave. He knows he can't live without you. He's doing what he can to stop that from happening," Mycroft explained.
"Thanks," Sherlock whispered, which surprised the older Holmes as he'd been expecting resentment. Or annoyance at the very least.
“Enough!” Sally snapped sharply and it was enough for the submissive in Sherlock to turn his attention out the window.
“You’ve been a good boy this week, taken your punishment well, I thought we could go for a walk through my grounds to the lale at the bottom. There might not be any ducks on it at this time of year, but it’s nice and relaxing.”
"Yes, sir," Sherlock whispered, his eyes squeezed shut as he tried to stretch out his knee and foot. John was bent over the man they'd apprehended and couldn't see him. He hadn't seen him slip and trip before he had lunged at the suspect and his leg was screaming at him. Screaming at him for being so stupid as to lunge for someone clearly too far away.
“How do you know he’ll let me?” Sherlock was hoping for something that this Dom knew that he didn’t.
“I know, sir, but you won’t need to punish me again.” Sherlock seemed incredibly confident considering there was at least another 11 weeks to go and they’d barely started when it came to the sexual aspect of their relationship. Neither of them had any idea how he would act in company, which they would find out that night. In public, neither of them had any idea what was likely to happen or how obedient he would be. John admired his optimism, though. It made a nice change.
The doctor took him straight to the kitchen and tried to make him take a seat on one of the comfy chairs, but he shook his head and dropped with a painful thud to his knees beside the Dom’s usual chair. His groan was internal
John let his palm fall on his sub's arse, the ice still in his hand.
The government official got to his feet and paced the cell for a moment, before coming to a halt. “Moriarty.”
Not willing to show himself up in front of his older brother any more than he had, Sherlock nodded slightly, his curls slipping forward masking his expression. “No, sir,” he offered.
“Can I go to the loo?”
"Let's just leave him," Greg said. "He's clearly shattered."
“Well you can do the work, up, down, and you know what I said about what happens to you if you come without my express permission.”
"No, I'll take him," Sherlock insisted. He could use the time to settle his nerves out of the sight of the other adults.
Sherlock watched his brother a moment longer before switching his attention to the little boy in front of him. He was certain John found the situation ironic as the doctor often accused him of sulking himself. “Thank you for apologising, Finn. Come on, then.”
“But he’s bigger than me. He need a bigger spade.”
When he came back from the boot he was holding two padded blindfolds. He threw one to the backseat that John caught and he tied the other around Mycroft's head.
Sherlock didn't know how to explain it, let alone to himself. It felt like he was peeing backwards, or some strange inverted orgasm.
“Funnily enough, no-one’s ever gone for that option.”
"Mm. Sir," the sub said, blinking slowly.
Sherlock actually flinched. “Sorry, sir, I can’t help it.”
Sherlock shifted to the top of the bed to sit up as John told him to.
He sipped at the water again until the bottle was empty. "More please, sir," he whispered.
"That'a boy, Greggie," John patted his head like a dog.
"Yes, sir. Sorry, sir."
"No. No, no, no." The detective shook his head, understanding. "This isn't just our sister. We should risk it. We should go." He started back the way they had come, but it was now blocked.
“So I have protected your ass from my paddle because I know you. I know what you are like.”

“Please, sir. I can’t hold it anymore.”
"Sir," Sherlock whined after a moment.
A lack of soldier grunts walking around should make the pair of them feel better. Instead it just made them nervous.
He leant back against the wall and watched him for a while, he was so peaceful while he slept, it was unlikely to continue when he woke up.
The sub obeyed and whimpered pitifully when his sensitive skin was tugged and stretched. He dropped his head to hide his face as he bit his lip to stop from crying out.
The Superintendent began moving faster, enjoying the pleasure that was building low in his belly. “My good boy, my gorgeous boy. You're so good for me.”
"That's where imagination comes into play," Irene said with a wink.
The doctor gripped Sherlock by the curls and pulled tightly. He could tell that his boy had almost reached subspace. It wouldn't take much to push him over the edge, leaving him with a soft, compliant boy.
“But, daddy!” Finn moaned. “I want to tell uncle Myc!”
"My being here years ago." His attention was drawn to the door where the Doms appeared holding the pizza boxes.
“Who cares,” Sherlock lifted Finn up onto his hip. “Mycroft’s paying.”
The government official glanced at his Dom. Greg nodded at him and Mycroft took a deep breath. “My brother is still trying to be the perfect sub, foolish as that is.”
Across the hot tub, Greg and Mycroft watched closely.
“No, sir, you were, sir.”
Eurus had had a chair brought in from somewhere and was lounging in it by the door, watching Irene work.
"Yup." Sherlock leant over and gave the doctor a peck on the lips.
“Now. Uncuff. Him.”
“I’ll have the gun, please.”
He held his hand out for the flask and gathered his leash in his grip too. “Come on, then.”
Greg reached out and grabbed his own sub by the hair, dragging him into the room. "Pick something," Greg ordered.
"But, sir-"
"Open up, boy," Greg ordered. When Mycroft complied, he pushed the ball gag between his teeth and buckled it tightly in place. "Hmm, better, but there's still something missing.
Sherlock had unpacked all of John's things and put them away. In addition, he was dressed impeccably as his Dom had ordered. Not knowing what else to do, he knelt in the centre of the room with his hands at his neck.
“You'll address Irene as 'miss', Sherlock. Without fail.”
“I prefer you choose this morning,” the doctor said, as he took a seat.
"Open your eyes, Greggie, look at me."
“Oh you are, you so are. I'll be tripling your tally for the next several days, but that's it.”
"Prove it. What's the atomic weight of... Iridium?"
"I'm sorry, sir." Sherlock ducked his head and ate a chip quickly so he didn't have to say anything more.
The boy whimpered as he was freed. “I wouldn’t get your hopes up, boy. It won’t be for long.” John could see his hands itching to roam downwards, but forbidden to do so. Somehow, from somewhere came the strength to make him obey and continue obeying. “Good boy.” John leant forward so there was less than an inch between their faces.
“Whatever I say, you’ll hide and not allow me to have it, sir. You choose.” Then at least I can't blame myself.
"Ah." So his boy didn't want to make him angry. That was much better than last night. "Good." John moved around behind his pet and shifted him so he could slide the fucking machine away.
"I'm not hungry yet."
The boy tried to nod his understanding, he couldn’t speak with the soap so it was his only option. He couldn’t leave John, he couldn’t!
The detective took his brother’s words in the spirit they were meant, not looking for hidden agendas because they weren't there. "Thank you, Mycroft. He's more important than the rest of us, isn't he? I don't think I ever understood that about children before now."
Greg glanced at the screen as well and straightened up.
The Dom knelt down beside the younger man and took hold of his soft length. Sherlock pulled back, forcing the doctor to grab the D-ring on the collar with his finger to pull him back up straight.
“It didn’t feel right, sir.”
"You're being a git."
Mycroft shot him a glare, but started the odious task of turning back around. He was stopped, however, when his Dom grasped him by the chin. Mycroft flinched back at the look on Greg's face. "Sir-"
"Hmm?"
“Hello to you too, brother mine.” Mycroft set Finn back on his feet. “There's plenty of room to join the girls if you would like.”
Finn struggled for a bit, then he stopped. He looked dazed and in shock.
Greg was already naked when he reached it and the shower was running so warm the room had steamed up.
Irene glanced down at Sherlock.
"You can't believe that? I had him on his knees a few weeks ago moving rice," he pointed at the room Mycroft was asleep in.
Their little sister awaited them, as usual, but an exhausted and slightly battered Irene stood behind her. The Dominatrix had lost her polish and glamour.
With Mycroft involved, the wedding photos had already been delivered to 221B despite it only having been a few days since the event. Being the first one awake, Finn had crept into the living room and was looking at them... again. The little boy loved looking at the photos of his daddy and papa together. He especially liked the ones with him standing with them like a real family.
Sherlock nodded once where he’d sat on the floor beside Finn and his truck.
Irene lifted the cane high overheard with the intent to bring it down on Sherlock hard, but one of the guards grasped it and took it from her. "Eurus said you weren't to damage them."
“He hang up on you?”
John had attached the overhead hook to the rope harness and he went to the winch, lifting Mycroft into the air.
It's a porny one
John didn’t know the Detective Inspector as well as he knew Mycroft, but knew him well enough to know that he liked privacy when Mycroft hit this area, many Doms did.
“Because you need your own space.” John wasn’t surprised that this question had come from the sub. It always did, but the thing that did surprise him was the fact that Sherlock of all people had wanted his company at night earlier than many of the other subs he had ever trained. “Subs always need their own space when getting used to a new Dom. I’m not going to force you to sleep with me, hence your own room from day one.”
"Why don't you just throw me out in the snow when it falls next time. I bet you'd love that."
“I suppose you thought, half an hour ago you were about to have the luckiest and most enjoyable evening your pathetic excuse for lives had seen since university. Must have been one hell of a fluke for Sherlock to pass by where you two psychos were. But then John turned up, an ex-army captain who still has a licence to kill. Oh, didn’t he tell you that? That would be because he protects the British Government’s little brother. And then I turn up, a bit shell shocked really but I’ll go along with anything me…”
“Strip,” he ordered.
“It’s just the curtains, John,” her response was cautious, as if she believed she would get in trouble for something. She’d have shut the windows herself, but Sherlock had flung them open far too wide.
Holding something, Sherlock’s brain automatically told him. But what was it? Good or bad? Sherlock watched him for a bit longer than John would have liked, but he was glad again. His sub was back to testing the system, back from the fuzzy area of Panic and into reality.
