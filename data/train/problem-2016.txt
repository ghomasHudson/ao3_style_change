. Nevertheless, because I named myself after a snake, I eventually came to take an interest in them; plus, I lived near a friend for a while who was a serious snake nut and had filled her house with boas and pythons. So, although I am not the first to point this out by any means, I can confirm from experience that Doyle knew fuck-all about how snakes work. Let me just list the Major Errors Of The Speckled Band:
At the end of the day, well, this episode doesn’t make spring bloom again for me; but it’s entertaining, and certainly it’s a big improvement on the canon story. I love the final scene in 221B, with Holmes getting in his digs about Watson’s gambling and then finding out that Mrs. Hudson plays the ponies too. Basically, after
So, when Holmes says “I have never loved,” well, the whole episode has been about showing us why that’s bullshit. He has loved, and the person he has loved is the person he’s saying this to. But the rest of it…Holmes is basically saying, if anyone ever harms the person I love, I will fuck them up. And in the adaptation, Watson gets to say it back: yeah, I would probably do the same in that situation. Now, “I will kill anyone who hurts you” is kind of a strange way to say “I love you;” but honestly, if you watch the scene, I think that’s basically what they both mean.  This is the ILY exchange. They’re closer now than ever before. Death is still with them. But now they’ve faced it together. They’ve both gone into that chasm and come back out. And they’re finally, now, on holiday. Together.
In general, the grotesquerie that Doyle attached to the cook is developed by Hammond in relationship to Murillo/Henderson, who doesn’t really appear in the canon story. Senora Durango, once she revives, speaks of the “rivers of blood” shed by Murillo in San Pedro, and Hammond seems to have taken that as his text; Murillo wears red jewelry and sees visitors in a red throne room which doubles as a theater for his devilish torture rituals:
"Your readers will think I pocketed that bauble, and deprived Peterson of the reward he is currently enjoying--"
I just imagine these conversations happening during shooting: “How’s Jeremy feeling today?” “He seems in pretty good spirits.” “Great. Call props, tell them to get him some more paper.”

Jeremy Brett.
One is forced to console oneself by reflecting that absence is the highest form of presence. There’s a nice moment when the Professor is ranting about the stupidity of country girls and you see Holmes giving him the “all right, fuck THIS guy” look with which he has favored so many in the past (Carruthers and Roylott being two of the most memorable). All the way back in “Dancing Men,” we see Watson coaching Holmes about consideration for the servants, as he leans over to whisper into his ear that Mrs. King might want to sit down for her interview–knowing that she won’t think she’s allowed unless Holmes gives her permission. In this episode, as in many of the others since “Dancing Men,” Holmes starts his interviews with the servants by asking if they want to sit down. When Susan Tarlton does, and he notices that she’s staring at the bloodstain on the carpet, he covers it with his scarf before continuing the interview. Mycroft doesn’t think of these things; that’s Watson’s influence. Watson’s influence also explains the fact that Anna’s suicide is a mystery to Mycroft but transparent to Holmes. Hope, despair, and the death of love–all things he’s contemplating as he sits alone in 221b, talking to himself, while Watson’s out working at his surgery…still.
Below the cut tag I’m going to talk mainly about the consequences of using “The Red Headed League” as a vehicle for introducing Moriarty. And also, of course, the many delightful moments it provides for our next-to-last look at the Brett and Burke team.
Longer story behind the cut tag: I was very disappointed, and I will tell you why.
In case you didn’t notice, Senora Durango is lying the middle of a cruciform spotlight. The candelabra and the black-robed Lucas who’s drawing her blood with the point of his knife complete the whole “black mass” vibe here. The alienation of Murillo is completed when, as he’s leaving the room, he announces that he’s immortal, and catches sight of his reflection:

The mystery is resolved by the characters who are motivated to do it (because the Dark Secret or the villain is endangering or blocking them). Even in
Let me say up front that although it has some cultural and historical interest, as a story I’ve never liked “The Crooked Man” much. Like “The Engineer’s Thumb” and “The Five Orange Pips,” “The Crooked Man” seems to be just using Holmes’s investigation as an excuse to tell a sensational story about something else. “The Crooked Man” is mostly told rather than shown; Holmes has already done almost all the investigation before he drops by Watson’s place to ask if he wants to be in at the kill, and a few paragraphs later they’ve found Harry Wood and he then launches into his own narrative. Watson does almost nothing, and the investigation is rendered completely irrelevant after the coroner determines that Barclay died of apoplexy. If I’d been running the series, I personally would have left this one alone.

–would blow up moments like this into melodrama by exaggerating Holmes’s addictions and turning his housekeeping quirks into epic dysfunctions. With a Holmes who’s that self-destructive, Watson’s nurturing becomes self-denial, and the relationship becomes an opera of codependency. But this scene is presented as just one among many moments in a relationship long and deep enough to encompass much more than what we can see from our voyeuristic position. And so I appreciate the way Watson just sits down, pours Holmes some tea, gently pushes it at him, and says, let’s go down to Norwood and see what we can do. And it’s such a poignant and heartstrings-playing moment when Holmes looks back at him and says, “I feel I shall need your company, and your moral support, today.”
Oh my God, it’s the Young Pope!
. I recommend it to the curious. But of course that’s not all there is to “The Empty House,” and that piece doesn’t take up the BIG question, asked by some of my loyal readers in response to
So one can’t say they pulled punches when it came to depicting the poverty; indeed, they seem to have scoured the country for dissolute-looking extras to dress up in rags and lie around in the street. But all of this is shot in such an alienating way that the overall impression is not, this poverty is an injustice, but rather, poor people are scary. The same scariness is baked into the scene in the opium den, which takes forever, and which is shot like a scene in an 80s horror film.
This episode, for me, is about more than the case. Everyone’s all “Three Garridebs” this and “Three Garridebs” that; but in canon, IMHO, “Devil’s Foot” is just as big a milestone in Holmes and Watson’s relationship. The adaptation emphasizes and expands that into something which–for me, anyway–becomes profound and moving. In the context of the Granada series, “Devil’s Foot” is a kind of emotional sequel to “Empty House,” in which the Reichenbach trauma is–surreptitiously and subterraneously–reopened, worked through, and healed. Mercifully, this episode is largely unconcerned with
"No--it's--it's not about stealing. You are
Hawkesworth’s adaptation is, for me, a mixed bag. I think the smartest decision he made was to involve Watson more formally in the case. Having completed the apprenticeship narrative that runs from “Dancing Men” to “Final Problem,” Watson is now investigating things on his own, and has signed up to be a “police surgeon;” Lestrade apparently works with him from time to time, and calls him in to the Adair crime scene. This gives us a chance to find out a little more about Watson’s life without Holmes, and to introduce us to Hardwicke. The scene in which Watson gives evidence at the inquest is a great idea from that point of view. We see how, after producing Holmes’s celebrity, poor Watson himself has been forgotten, reduced to a nondescript man giving evidence to a testy coroner who won’t let him use his carefully honed deductive faculties and can’t even remember his name. Hardwicke seems very depressed by this interaction, and in general the mutedness of his performance fits very well with one’s idea of a Watson without Holmes. He’s doing his duty, getting through the day, still taking an interest in crime, but not really enjoying the full and exciting life he had with Holmes. The rest of the inquest, however, is very slow, very boring, and very full of unconvincing performances by bit players.
I got into Sherlock Holmes at around the same time, and the Granada series aired on PBS sometime during my teenage years; and honestly, when I watch “Norwood Builder,” I recognize more of myself and my relationship in it than I do in
The “second stain” idea is something Doyle has used before in “Abbey Grange,” where (in canon; they left this out of the adaptation) one of the clues that Lady Brackenstall’s story is wack is that there are flecks of Sir Eustace’s blood on the seat of the chair to which she was supposedly tied during the murder. Holmes notes that if they examined Lady B’s dress from that evening they’d probably find a corresponding stain. This takes us back to our old friend
, though Doyle has considerably sanitized the process. Serge Voronoff, who pioneered this ‘treatment,’ used to graft animal testicles onto the testicles of his patients, on the theory that this would increase their sexual potency. So Dr. Presbury, who’s so keen to marry a woman his daughter’s age, would actually have been a prime candidate for Voronoff’s operation.
Holmes’s decision to let Turner go takes place in what I would argue is a significantly different context from the one provided by the ACD canon story, and that makes it more interesting and more poignant to me. In the canon story, as I said, this is the first time Holmes has ever done something like this, and he’s nervous about it. Before Turner shows up, he makes a production of asking Watson to weigh in on his dilemma:
…though it’s hard to see what that was about, casewise, unless he just wanted a chance to go see a man about some sheep. Holmes’s irritation with his high-handed rich client is of course nothing new either ( “Scandal in Bohemia,” “Priory School,” etc.), but there are some nice little touches, like Holmes’s utter disgust for the vulgarly loud bell Ross uses to summon his servants:
It’s not as warm and cuddly as “The Blue Carbuncle;” it’s not as creepy as “The Speckled Band.” But “Norwood Builder” has always been one of my favorites, and it’s because it marks, to me, a significant change in Holmes and Watson’s relationship. In ACD canon, the catalyst for this change is really the Return; “Norwood Builder” is the first story set and published after “The Empty House.” As I’ve said many times before, the stories in The Return of Sherlock Holmes show us a Holmes/Watson relationship which is much more intimate, and much more central to both of their lives, than in earlier volumes. Hawkesworth seems to have wanted the whole first series to have that Return vibe.  Accordingly, in the Granada narrative, “Norwood Builder” takes place three episodes before “The Final Problem” (we have “Resident Patient” and “The Red-Headed League” coming up first). And thanks to some great work from the screenwriter and from Brett and Burke, this becomes, not just an interesting case, but a beautiful moment in the development of Holmes and Watson’s relationship.
, or even for the hiatus between the
So overall, I would say they did a pretty good job with some unpromising material. I’ll be interested to see what happens with “Bruce-Partington Plans,” another story I never liked much, but which will at least bring back Mycroft.
When Watson comes back in, laden with presents and holly and full of the details on the Hotel Cosmopolitan robbery, Holmes is just sitting there in his deshabille, gazing at the hat. Watson is a little piqued to find out he’s being ignored; but again, the beauty of Granada Holmes is how comfortable they are with each other. Watson’s not going to lose his temper over it; after his bit of snark, he happily heads over to his desk to start going through the Christmas cards and teasing Holmes about what a sinister and terrible criminal history must be attached to that hat. The Reading of the Hat has to be one of the best deduction bits Doyle wrote for Holmes, and Brett and Burke actually make it better. They’re both playing with each other, Holmes adopting a condescending pity in his explanation and Watson pretending to be annoyed by it, and it builds to a nice climax right at the moment that Peterson busts in with the carbuncle.
“But surely, Holmes, neither you nor I could have any knowledge of that, given that
Late in the afternoon of the twenty-fourth of December, I struggled up the stairs to our sitting room, weighted down with brown-paper parcels and nearly strangled by a garland of greenery that I had rather impulsively purchased without thinking about how I would carry it home. I knocked the snow and slush from my boots, staggered into the sitting room, and dropped the parcels anyhow onto the settee. I next set about freeing myself from the twelve feet of pine needles that were coiled uncomfortably about my neck and shoulders. Having disentangled myself, I took up the slippery, whispering thing in both hands, intending to arrange it over the mantel. My eye caught the china tray onto which Holmes has the bad habit of carelessly piling our incoming correspondence. Peeping from amongst the half-penny holiday cards was a sealed, oblong envelope. I could not see the address, but the paper was the shade of pressed lilac.
Ooooh, distortion. Could it be that this Don Murillo has a soul as distorted and warped as this reflection? Stay tuned to find out!
, anything that doesn’t outrage my sensibilities and break my heart is a win.
Anyway, so, there are three reasons why “The Musgrave Ritual” has always been one of my least favorite stories. One: no Watson. “The Musgrave Ritual” is an old case, from the beginning of Holmes’s career, which survives amongst his records as a peg with a string on it and a few old coins. Holmes tells Watson the story to get out of cleaning up their sitting room. Two: more telling than showing. All of the most interesting things in this case have already happened before Musgrave shows up in London to consult Holmes. And three: I’m American. When I was 12, I had no idea who the fuck Charles I was, or what a cavalier was. I eventually learned, of course; but even then, I couldn’t really
Well, no one could have known at the beginning that treating Brett’s bipolar disorder would one day take such a huge toll on his body, or that the fluid retention caused by the medication would aggravate what would turn out to be a fatal heart condition. But all of these things did happen. And so by the time they did make
This of course is exactly the attitude we’re all fighting as we try to interest the next generation in a TV show filmed in the mid-1980s. I remember, back when cable was new and MTV became a thing, people talking about how music videos were accelerating the pacing of other kinds of visual entertainment. Twenty-first century viewers are used to a lot more visual stimulation–which basically means a lot more editing–per minute than we made do with back in the dark ages. The Granada episodes will naturally feel slow to children of the millennium, especially those accustomed to
There you have it. Per the authority of one A. Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes does a therapeutic version of the Vulcan neck pinch. Put that in your fic and smoke it.
I stuffed the letter and the report into a pigeon-hole in my writing desk, and went to work on tidying and decorating the sitting room. I had, I fear, entirely lost my Christmas spirit. It did not return, even when I had succeeded in snaking that extravagant garland over, amongst, and around everything in the sitting room that abutted its walls--from the sideboard to the mantel to the tantalus and the gasogene. My time in the Army had given me a distaste for physical violence. I would have preferred it, for instance, if Holmes could have resolved Miss Sutherland's case without actually horsewhipping her stepfather--and not only because we then had the trouble of blackmailing him into dropping the charges. I cannot truthfully say that I have never resorted to fisticuffs at a moment of crisis. I can say, however, that until I met Sir George Burnville, I had never left the print of my knuckles on the face of a peer of the realm.
I’m going to talk about Hammond’s thing with mirrors. And though I don’t plan to talk about Sherlock much in this one, my exposure to Sherlock does make me more interested in the question Hammond and his mirrors raise in “Wisteria Lodge”: When is a motif a symbol, and when is it just a trick? In other words, as the viewer, can we really tell the difference between something intended to create meaning, and something the director just happens to think is a cool effect? And does it really matter?

"Do you know what I would do with those jewels, if indeed I still had them?" he murmured.
As I said at some point somewhere, I think Kitty and Porky need their own spinoff. The fight in the sewer is one of the most successful fight scenes they’ve staged for this series, and Porky’s personality really shines through. The attack on Holmes is shot so that we don’t have to see too much of Brett fighting; but it’s done effectively enough. (The bastards went for the head. Gruner promises to shoot for the head too. What an evil-minded little psychopath he is.) They should team up and fight crime. The revelation of Kitty’s scars at Violet de Merville’s house is a shock to the viewers, of course, because this is not in canon at all. But it’s also a shock to Holmes; and that’s another thing I appreciate about this adaptation. When he’s telling the story to Watson later, he starts reproaching himself for not having deduced the scars earlier. He’s realizing that for all his science of deduction there are certain blindnesses he still can’t truly compensate for. Holmes has been to Hell, London–but only as a visitor. He doesn’t really know what it’s like to

Which you seem to show–
How is any of this necessary? How is it excusable? The story doesn’t call for it; it’s completely inconsistent with the way Brett’s Holmes has so far treated the other women he’s interacted with on screen. It’s all of a piece with the gratuitous action and the killing of Latimer; and I just wonder why anyone thought they needed it. Had Marlowe read the canon stories? Had he seen any of the earlier episodes? Was he just so committed to Chandleresque atmosphere that he decided to give Holmes Philip Marlowe’s disgust for femmes fatales and really dames of all kinds? I don’t know. All I know is, that whole train sequence was a mistake and it shouldn’t have been made. One can only imagine Brett, who appears to have appointed himself guardian of the canon, reading the script and just facepalming when he got to that part. I have to SAY this shit? For real?
From Bowen’s point of view, at least going by the adaptation, Wilder is the real criminal. Whereas Holmes seems primarily concerned with making sure that Heidegger’s murderer swings for it, Bowen is much less interested in the murder of the adult than in the abduction of the child. Wilder is shown manhandling and terrorizing Arthur as he drags him out of the inn; Watson gives chase, but can’t find him; and this leads to an actual search mob armed
In other words: Holmes finally gets it. He’s experiencing what it was like to be Watson during those three years, and he’s fucking terrified by it. And that’s going to change everything.

But then again, it’s not surprising that the episode turned out heavier, darker, and more tragic than the canon story. You can now hear Brett’s labored breathing along with every line delivery. He rallies for the opening scene in 221b, which is mostly enjoyable–Watson is so pleased he gets to do the deducing, Holmes scrapbooking and pretending it’s important it pretty funny, and of course Rosalie Williams remains a treasure. He also somehow manages to haul himself in and out of that hole in the roof. But in the final scene at the opera, when they end with a closeup of Holmes weeping over the music and the tragic events that have gone before…that’s more sadness than this episode has really earned, or than the viewer can easily bear.

You know, I was looking at this going, that’s a very pretty actor they found for this very small part. He kind of reminds me of a young Jude Law…and then I get to the closing credits:
And the bottom line here is, I suppose, that the 1857 mutiny in and of itself is just not as interesting to me as it was to Doyle’s contemporaries. It was certainly a huge deal for Doyle and his audiences, who even a generation later were still worrying about how long they’d be able to hold their imperial possessions. Doyle seems to have been especially anxious about this. Watson’s military history in
So all this is great for Kitty. She stows away on the back of Watson’s cab, acting completely independently of Holmes and Watson; and her vitriol-throwing, while still very Woman Scorned, is now reciprocal: she turns on him the weapon he used against her. Props to the production team, BTW, for finding a credible way to do the vitriol throwing. Much more effective to show the painting melting under the acid than to attempt to represent the vitriol-ravaged Baron’s face. It also saves Holmes some embarrassment. In the canon story, Holmes takes Kitty along with him, and later protests total ignorance of her intentions–even though he mentions that he could see she was carrying something very carefully under her cloak. “How could I have known” what was in it, he asks. YOU ARE SHERLOCK HOLMES. THAT’S HOW. Indeed, in the canon story, one has to conclude either that Holmes really is slipping–or that he knew damn well what was in that vial, and he was using Kitty to punish Gruner the same way he used the swamp adder to punish Roylott.

For about half an hour, this episode is pretty effective. There is not a lot of actual detective work that goes into solving this case in “Greek Interpreter;” but the situation itself is legitimately suspenseful and ultimately tragic (even more so to me in 2017 than it was in 1985), and of course we owe to it the introduction of Sherlock Holmes’s smarter brother, Mycroft.

My point is, the word “stain” has Connotations, especially in the context of a woman’s ‘honor’ or ‘virtue,’ which in this era were synonymous–for women–with sexual fidelity and chastity.

. And this little scene here, in which Watson comes downstairs for breakfast and finds Holmes staring despondently into space, is kind of a touchstone for me.
In Bowen’s adaptation, Watson is still kind of an idiot; but he’s not stupid. When Watson fucks up in this story–and he does, epically, at the bank–it’s because he’s trying to protect his friend, and directly confronting Green is the only way he can see of doing it. Unlike the canon story, Bowen’s script gives Watson excellent reasons to believe that Green is the abductor. Not only does Watson probably have flashbacks to Carruthers every time he looks at the guy, but he has seen how Lady Frances reacts to him. He knows she wants him to stay away and that he refuses to do so. He recognizes Green, in other words, as the stalker that he is; and it is completely reasonable for him to infer on that basis that Green is the villain of the piece.
Below the cut tag I’m going to talk about what this adaptation does with Kitty Winter, pictured above on the cab ride home from their dramatic visit to Violet de Merville’s house. But I will be talking about all that in the context of what really makes this episode stand out, which is what this adaptation does with the Great Partnership. This is a great episode for the Brett and Hardwicke team–even though, curse my besotted teenage heart of yore, I still can’t help wishing sometimes that I was watching Brett and Burke do this instead.
He rose on his knees, lifting his two hands into the air between us, a little higher than my head. I knelt before him and looked up at the circlet of darkness and light that that his hands described, and I swear by heaven that I saw it. I saw, poised in the curves drawn by his fingers, a circlet woven subtly of golden wire, fixing within its labyrinths many-colored brilliants from all the ends of the earth.
In Collins’s novel, the Moonstone is a large diamond from India which was, hundreds of years ago, stolen out of the head of a statue in a Hindu temple in Somnath and then passed from plunderer to plunderer until it finally winds up in England, in the hands of a British officer who killed three people in cold blood to get it. The diamond is supposed to have been cursed at the time of the original theft, and to bring nothing but bad luck to anyone who owns it. What happens after “the wicked old Colonel” leaves this jewel to his beautiful niece on her 20
We’re told all kinds of dire things about him, but we don’t know much about the specifics of what he actually does. Holmes’s plan to entrap him is similarly left up to the imagination; we don’t know why he has to wait until Monday to make his final move–especially since Moriarty evidently knows what he’s planning already–or why he doesn’t have to be in England for the big round-up.
Most of what happens after this is Holmes walking Watson through the evidence and the deductions; but the main thing he wants to hear from Watson is what to do about the fact that the murderer is a dying man–and also the father of the very girl who has been pleading with them so earnestly to find the real killer. When he hears Turner’s story, and about how McCarthy had been blackmailing him for years, Holmes makes the decision to try to shield McCarthy. We don’t find out much about how Watson reacts to any of this; but we do get Holmes’s commentary on it:
, who is now my sole source for art history). The parallels are not exact but there are undeniable compositional similarities. That final image of Rachel presents her murder of Brunton as a kind of Ophelia’s Revenge; yes, she winds up drowning herself, but first she’s gonna get the guy who did her wrong. It reminds us that the whole “Musgrave Ritual” plot, since it’s all about things being buried, is great fodder for psychoanalysis as well as horror; like Rachel’s horrible corpse, the whole episode is about What Lies Beneath. Holmes gets stuck at the very end of the hunt because he’s forgotten the most important part of the instructions, which (in the adaptation) Watson excitedly reminds him of: “And under! You’ve forgotten the ‘and under’!” Excavation is one of the primary metaphors for psychoanalysis; and it’s also a very common trope for mystery novels, given that we’re always trying to discover something that’s been

The situation after this point gets a little stickier. The Duke tries to buy Holmes and Watson’s silence by doubling the amount of the check. Holmes tells him look, I can help you, but first you have to tell me everything and then you have to let me do what I want. The Duke agrees. Holmes rips Holdernesse a new one, but having ensured Hayes’s arrest, and dispatched a servant to go bring young Lord Saltire home, he allows the Duke to send Wilder off to Australia instead of turning him in. Then he pockets the check, and that’s the end of the story.

The adaptation takes this farther, finally making Lestrade a real character and laying, one could argue, the foundation for Greg Lestrade’s character and his relationship with Sherlock on
We respond to that aspect of Brett’s performance so strongly because it speaks to something fundamental about how humans learn–something that the twenty-first century often seems to be in danger of forgetting. Some research has now been done comparing the experience of reading ebooks to paper books, and early results seem to indicate that we retain the material better when reading a physical book because of the sensory and spatial “mapping” that holding and manipulating the physical book allows us to do. We know something better when we can grapple with it somatically as well as mentally.
I may as well observe in passing that it really seems to me as if Hawkesworth is really pushing the envelope when it comes to coding this relationship. Hardwicke’s most animated moment comes after Holmes asks if he can crash on Watson’s examination table for a few hours, and Watson cries, “My BEDROOM is at your disposal!” This is not ACD canon. Neither is Holmes’s line about how he was so excited about the prospect of seeing Watson again that he couldn’t sleep. In canon, they just have dinner and spend the next three hours catching up. In this episode, Holmes falls asleep in Watson’s consulting room and Watson tenderly tucks a blanket around him. There’s also this weird little moment at the empty house when Holmes gets overexcited and yells “YOU’RE MY TIGER!” at Moran. Watson puts a hand on his shoulder, like, easy there tiger, and Holmes smacks it away in a state of high excitement. Makes you wonder what games they’re going to be playing back at 221b after the champagne is gone and Mrs. Hudson has retired.
The big news with Granada Holmes was that they were supposed to be doing adaptations of the actual Conan Doyle stories, instead of taking the characters of Holmes and Watson and writing new plots for them. That’s what most theatrical, film, and TV adaptations had done up to that point. With the exception of
"Of course. It's...more than usually accurate, and entirely charming."
So all right. I’m ready for the Hardwicke Era. Onward we go.
Now. What happens next is, from an artistic point of view, terrible. And yet, I’m going to argue, it is also extremely meaningful, and makes this episode so much more important than it would otherwise be.
So here’s what I’m talking about: if you look at the image I opened with, which is our first shot of Holmes and Watson, there’s enough going on visually that you could really go down the rabbit hole of interpretation before the case even starts. Holmes’s back is to Watson (and to us) and he’s facing the giant framed print of the Reichenbach Falls that now hangs over the mantelpiece; so while he’s talking to Watson, he’s Facing Into His Death. The mirror on the mantelpiece, meanwhile, which we would intuitively expect to reflect Holmes’s face, actually reflects Watson’s. So many doublings and reflections, you could be all day constructing meanings created by the two reflective things Holmes is facing here. I’m going to just single out one: this is our introduction to the word “grotesque,” and it suggests that Hammond has identified the uncanniness of the mirror as the way to visually “define the word grotesque.” There’s always something uncanny about mirrors. Even when a mirror functions perfectly, it doubles something that is supposed to be unique, i.e., your face. Mirrors often function as a gateway to another world, as in
All of this is set up in the opening scene, which contains the famous “you do not propose to invest in South African securities” deductive riff. What I love about this is how playful they both are. Holmes is showing off a bit, but he’s not trying to score off Watson; he’s just enjoying his little demonstration, and perhaps enjoying even more the fact that Watson reacts exactly as he initially predicted. But Watson’s got game of his own:
episodes. To be honest, I didn’t get a lot of enjoyment out of either HOB or
. Either way, though her performance is kind of odd, you can tell that you’re watching someone who has It–the ability to keep the camera and the viewer interested, even when what she’s doing is pretty mundane. And I should also point out that I have been noticing that these screenplays do spend more time than you might expect fleshing out the servant characters, and that I’ve now figured out that a lot of the writers for this series had also worked on
I looked up at him over the edge of the paper. "Yes, Holmes?"
You know, after I finished this episode, I started kicking myself for not having seen it back in 1986. I was 17, I could really have used it then. Why, I lamented, did I let my adolescent fear of change prevent me from the years of enjoyment I could have derived from “The Second Stain”? But then I said, no, do not be so hard on Young Plaidder. She was more prescient than you imagine. Somehow she mysteriously knew, without knowing, that in 2017, you would DESPERATELY need the shot in the arm that these ‘new’ episodes of Granada Holmes would provide–and that this particular episode would come along right at the moment that Cranky Old Plaidder would be most exquisitely poised to appreciate the many, many intertextualities which add zest and deliciousness to this most scrumptious of palimpsests.
That’s basically the TL:DR on this one. The Granada team waited too long to do
Seriously, the setup in “Thor Bridge” is basically the same as in
I really tried very hard to go into this episode with an open mind, even though I knew it was written by Derek Marlowe, the man who thought it was a good idea to end “The Greek Interpreter” with a 20-minute chase scene on a train. I was excited for it, even, because I had never actually seen it before–which surprised me, because I really thought I’d seen all of the Brett and Burke episodes. Imagine my joy when I discovered there was a whole new one that was as yet unknown to me! Even if it was written by Derek Marlowe!
HELLO. Yes, they do it. Indeed, they are kind of, you should pardon the expression, taking a bath in it. It’s true they put the little end table between them with the hookah on it…but all the same…
of who he is and what he does. Nor did he ever expect that Lestrade would invite him to go down to Scotland Yard and have Lestrade’s brethren “shake him by the hand,” thus
"And?" I said, bracing myself.
All this is to say that when I first read the Sherlock Holmes stories as a child, I did not know enough to appreciate “The Illustrious Client.” I was very frustrated with Violet de Merville for being dumb enough to fall for the wicked Baron. I’m still frustrated with the way in which, as we get further into the 20th century, Doyle shifts from women who come to Holmes because they know something’s wrong, and women whose relatives and friends come to him because *they* know something wrong but the victim herself is too blind/infatuated/stubborn to admit it. But I can now see, through the layers of melodrama enveloping this most sensationalistic of plots, the outline of something very real. You don’t have to be an idiot to for fall for a guy who’s made a career out of convincing women that he’s better than he really is. And although most guys who do this are simply hiding their turbo-jerkdom, some of them are hiding their abusive tendencies; and any abuser is a potential murderer. The wicked Baron was, even in 1924, something of a melodramatic cliche. But although Baron Gruner may be a nearly-cartoonish exaggeration, that doesn’t mean he’s not real.
. And mostly, I haven’t really had much occasion to do comparisons, except when it came to “Empty House.” Nevertheless, while this review is going to focus mainly on the Granada episode and the adaptation–especially the way Jeremy Paul, who also adapted “Speckled Band” and “Naval Treaty” for Granada, manages to make a compelling hour of television out of a story I’ve never had any time for–I am going to talk about the profound influence that I believe this specific episode had, not only on
So in some ways, Bowen’s script is more like a
episode “Syzygy.”)
Gary Hopkins wrote “Devil’s Foot,” which I loved, so I’m just going to assume that most of the WTF? decisions made during the process of adapting this story were dictated by external circumstances. Obviously the biggest was to replace Watson with Mycroft, who has nothing to do with the canon story. I don’t, as usual, know anything about the production process; but although Brett seems to be doing better in this episode than he was in “Dying Detective,” I assume that either Hardwicke had another project to do at filming time, or this change was another attempt to protect an ailing Brett by reducing his workload. This story is very heavy on the deduction–it really makes you wish they’d done it earlier; it would have been a great “Adventures” or “Return” episode and it’s set in 1894–and substituting Mycroft allows him to handle his share of the deducing, which leaves Brett less to memorize and fewer takes to do. It also introduces some novelty value; and I’m not against that. Trying something new insulates the episode slightly from invidious comparisons; since they’ve never done an episode with just Sherlock and Mycroft, people can’t watch it and wish they were watching some earlier episode with just Sherlock and Mycroft. And I’m sure there were Mycroft fans back in the 1990s, as there are today, who were glad to see him get some screen time. Hopkins works in a couple of tantalizing little references to the Holmes brothers’ home life–Sherlock seems particularly pained to discover (improbably, for the first time) that Mycroft has their father’s magnifying glass, and I was somewhat pained to discover that the “whatever is left, however improbable” line originally belonged to their father.
That’s how I felt about “The Resident Patient.” Marlowe restricts himself to canon in this one–at least more so than in “Greek Interpreter”–but it feels like this was not so much out of respect as just that he couldn’t be bothered. Trevelyan’s voiceover is used to convey things that direct action could have made more interesting. There’s absolutely no attempt to individuate the members of the Worthington bank gang; instead of writing some dialogue for the ‘trial’ of Blessington/Sutton, which might have given us more of an interest in the outcome, Marlowe focuses on the horror of the actual killing. The flashback to the bank robbery honestly looks as if they did the first take without rehearsal, then said fuck it, let’s keep it. The extra playing the bank guy who gets shot isn’t even really trying.
On the page, Holmes is immortal. He rises from the dead, and is allowed to drift off into various afterlives: keeping bees on the South Downs, international espionage, the Valhalla of the mind where it is always 1895. That’s part of what fascinates us about him: he never has to get old, he never has to die. Over time, film and TV adaptation preserves the myth of Holmes’s immortality by continually renewing the character and the stories so that a rejuvenated Holmes reappears, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and modern, with each iteration. But this adaptation, because of the rapid deterioration of Brett’s health during the last few years of filming, unavoidably dramatizes human frailty, vulnerability, and mortality in ways that are often difficult to watch.
Holmes’s dressing-down of Watson after his first (in this series anyway) solo assignment is a classic moment, in ACD canon and in this adaptation. But Holmes also clearly has a few things to learn. In fact, all the men drawn into Violet Smith’s orbit seem to have a habit of bungling things at critical moments. And yet, despite all this masculine incompetence, Violet Smith is still in real danger, because that’s what life is like when you’re a single woman trying to support yourself and your widowed mother in a world where men are pretty much never held accountable for the way they treat women.
That in itself was partly due to Brett’s extraordinary fidelity to the original text. Brett talked a lot about how he had to fight the rest of the team to keep the show in line with ACD canon. The viewer could be forgiven for being puzzled by that; nearly all the Granada episodes deviate to some extent, and some of them are startlingly divergent. I’ve come to the conclusion that when Brett talked about being faithful to the canon, he was talking first and foremost about being faithful to the dialogue. In the adaptation, at least through the end of the “Return” series, Holmes’s dialogue is usually preserved as close to verbatim as possible. The producers evidently thought he wouldn’t be able to make all that Victorian diction live. But he did it. He inhabited those speeches and transformed them, with all the care and dedication other actors lavish on Shakespeare. In that sense, his whole performance derives from paper–from the book of Doyle’s stories that he read, and
Look, I understand, you sent the production assistants out to scour the country for monkey-related Victoriana, and they did a bang-up job with it and I’m sure they were very excited. I’m sure they must have thought this thing was the biggest score EVER, I know everyone must have been oohing and aahing over it, once you’ve found a wind-up music box hookah-smoking kitsch monkey I can see you’d want to use it, but you see that whole simianization thing that I was talking about is all over this thing like…oh…well…never mind, I’ll just…
Whether I’m right about that or not, it remains the case that one of the best things about this adaptation is the way it emphasizes how much Holmes and Watson share at this point–especially their increasingly urgent concern for their vulnerable client. This isn’t one of those situations where Watson does the client handling and Holmes does the deducing. Holmes is the one who notices Helen’s bruises. Holmes is the one who lets Helen know that he knows her father is abusing her. Most importantly, Holmes is the one who instantly recognizes that her fear of being moved into Julia’s room–into the trap Roylott set for his last victim–is entirely justified. Holmes is a consulting detective and a recoverer of lost opal tiaras and a resolver of diplomatic crises and a decipherer of cryptograms and all that; but this episode emphasizes his function as
Well, it’s not what it looks like. They haven’t been finally convicted of burglary; they’ve just stepped into an empty cell, while visiting Miss Grace Dunbar in prison, so that Watson can pitch his theory of who killed Mrs. Gibson and how to Holmes. This conversation completely does not happen in canon; it is one of the many little tasty bon-bons offered to the faithful Granada fan by veteran adapter Jeremy Paul’s script. Paul adapted “Naval Treaty,” “Speckled Band,” “Wisteria Lodge,” and “Musgrave Ritual”; and if you look at his track record you can see that he has a healthy respect for the canon stories but is also not afraid to, let’s say, enhance them by making some significant changes (as he does in “Musgrave Ritual” and “Wisteria Lodge”). In his expansion of “Thor Bridge,” Paul gives us loads of what has worked for this show so far: more and better Watson, Holmes facing off against asshole millionaire clients, and–of course!–Jeremy Brett handling paper:
Just forgot how to grow
to Watson.
But the scene that’s really at the heart of “Dying Detective” is Watson’s first visit to Holmes’s bedside after his supposed infection. And quite unexpectedly, I thought it was the strongest scene he and Hardwicke had done together since “Illustrious Client.” And then I realized. In the sickbed scenes, because Holmes is pretending to be sick, Brett didn’t have to pretend to be well.
If you’re only going to watch one episode from the Brett/Burke era, this is the one. “The Speckled Band” is, first of all, one of the best Holmes stories Doyle ever wrote, despite the fact that it is riddled with unfortunate factual errors. While the mystery itself is exciting enough, it’s also pretty clear that there’s more going on beneath the surface. Dr. Roylott is up there with Moriarty and Charles Augustus Milverton as one of the truly memorable villains of ACD canon. The story is set before Watson’s marriage–the conceit is that Watson held off on publishing it until Helen Stoner (later Armitage) died–and it famously starts with Holmes in Watson’s bedroom, waking him up at an ungodly hour of the morning. This story helps lay the foundation for Action Hero Holmes, and also establishes Holmes as someone who, while he still takes no romantic interest in women, is always ready to risk life and limb to assist a lady in need. The atmosphere of horror and suspense stands up better for modern readers than it does in many another.
fan, so for me the bar is not high. There are worse notes on which this show could have gone out. And after the vast disappointments of “Mazarin Stone,” it’s nice to have Brett back–even not at full capacity–so that you can say a proper goodbye.
because this series was obviously an influence on that show; but these posts should still be enjoyable and accessible to people with no knowledge of

movies. And I will admit that the opening tracking shot is actually, from a purely cinematic point of view, a lot more interesting than the camera work normally is on this show. But that really only makes the content more insulting. I cannot think of a single Italian stereotype this episode doesn’t hit on their way to 221B. We open with this completely gratuitous image of a sultry Italian woman passionately…washing herself:
He doesn’t really want them; he wants the credit for destroying them. And so it’s actually a very clever touch that he throws vitriol on Kitty because she refuses to look at the book with him. The one thing she did that enraged him was to decline to participate in her own humiliation, or to gloat over the humiliation of the women who had come before her. He attacks her physically because her refusal to look at the book shows that despite his best efforts, he hasn’t been able to corrupt and degrade her to his own satisfaction.
Watson’s a little out of focus there, but I bet he could use a cigarette too. And in fact, that’s really the best thing about this episode: it’s just so satisfying. So many ups and downs, so much energy–the scene with him crawling all over the floor looking for the secret compartment while Watson keeps a lookout for the fuzz is priceless–and in the end, so much joy when it all comes out right for once:
But in all other respects, the adaptation sustains a much closer intimacy between the two principals than the canon story does. I mean I was watching the opening teaser thinking, hm, I wonder if they’re really going to do the Turkish bath thing or not…
performance. Hawkesworth did the screenplay for this one, and he stayed, as far as Holmes’s dialogue goes, very close to canon–which means that Brett is often faced, in this one, with paragraph-sized monologues. Not to worry; Brett has been dealing with giant chunks of dialogue since
So first, the elephant in the room: It’s very, very, very strange to watch “Dying Detective” knowing that Brett was, while they were making it, dying.
Instead, we have to content ourselves with the final conversation, after Watson has once again objected to Holmes’s decision to let a murderer go because he killed in revenge for the woman he loved. Well, that’s all traceable to Doyle’s biography and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. But they do something very interesting with this little snippet from the canon story:
* Though Holmes is the one to put the explanation together in the end, he has very little practical impact. His and Watson’s intervention is actually counterproductive; they very nearly cock-up a perfectly good escape plan that had already been concocted between Alice and her fiance with the help of Mrs. Toller. They really have two main functions in this story: 1) punish the villain (inadvertently and indirectly; like Roylott, Rucastle is attacked during all the confusion by the animal he’s weaponized) and 2) protect the detective (i.e., Violet). Like I said: Lestrade.
2) When someone dies after a long illness, one of the strangest things is not having to worry about them any more. For weeks or months your entire life has been full of anxiety about how best to care for them; now, that anxiety is over. There is nothing more to do. That in itself is its own loss. Watson has been trying to get Holmes to stop it with the cocaine since “Scandal in Bohemia.” One imagines there were many conflicts about that behind the scenes. And here it is, the syringe that caused them so much trouble, and an empty cocaine bottle. Watson’s been battling it all these years, and it’s over. It can’t do Holmes any more harm. And in a way, that’s a more convincing proof of his death than Watson’s imagined scene of the two of them taking that long last fall down into the whirlpool.
But the real payoff is at the end, after Holmes Dramatically Reveals the Black Pearl of the Borgias. In the Doyle story, Watson does talk about how deliberately dramatic he’s being, how much they enjoy that, and how they spontaneously applaud at the denouement. (We’ll just pass over the fact that once again Sherlock Holmes steals a valuable jewel and nobody does anything about it.) But the real punch comes when Lestrade walks up to Holmes and says, completely sincerely and with no trace of sarcasm or irony, “You know, we’re not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. We’re proud of you.”
Worried you would be too modern
But I digress.
In this way, “The Copper Beeches” betrays Doyle’s fidelity to sensation fiction. That’s exactly what Holmes is arguing with Watson about in that delightful opening conversation about “Watson’s” writing; Watson admits that “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records,” and he does it with a smile. That conversation is Doyle’s little sorry-not-sorry to his critics: yes, I am a sensationalist, and you love it and if you can’t acknowledge that well FUCK YOU. Holmes and Watson are having this argument right now because “The Copper Beeches” is in fact very reminiscent of sensation fiction, the genre which gave birth to the mystery. It’s a kind of
Let me also say how much I love it that the fake name “Ross” gives to the lawyer he’s subletting from is “William Morris.” This is something I only figured out on repeated reading, but many of the pre-Reichenbach stories indirectly represent the massive poverty and unemployment rampant in 1890s London–but usually represent it as somehow fraudulent or not real. There’s the journalist who pretends to be an unemployable panhandler in “The Man with the Twisted Lip,” the gang of ‘idle’ ruffians who pretend to get into a fight over the right to earn a copper by opening Irene Adler’s carriage door, and now this building full of desperate red-headed men hoping against hope to get a job where they can make four pounds a year. William Morris, one of England’s great writer/radicals, devoted much of his career to addressing this crisis. All he got in return–from Doyle, at any rate–was this rather cheeky cameo.
; but next to this one it looks like
"Always?" I said, incredulously. "Then why--invariably--"
I found this scary. I realized that this was meant to be an indication that Holmes was slipping, and I didn’t want to see that happen. I had a horror of addiction, when I was a teenager–no doubt encourage by my mother–and if this was going to be a story about Holmes rotting his brain with cocaine, I didn’t want any part of it. In fact, that’s not really most of what “The Musgrave Ritual” is about; but this is the first post-Return episode in which the syringe makes an appearance. It’s prepared by Holmes’s reference to his “lethargy” during the drive up–Brett lets you know Holmes is using it as a euphemism–and from the look on Watson’s face it appears that he thought maybe Holmes had kicked the habit during his worldwide walkabout. Poor Watson doesn’t even say anything about it. But he must have been secretly pretty glad when the butler went missing.
, death is part of this relationship now. Specifically, your death. This is Watson telling Holmes: I lived with your death for three years. I’m still living with it. I don’t have to wonder what it’s going to be like for me when you die, because
Bowen eliminates Doyle’s grandstanding and instead has Lady Brackenstall invent a much more complex account of her marriage which is more sympathetic both to Sir Eustace and to alcoholism in general. And here is where you start to feel like the Hawkesworth series is now starting to develop its own, semi-independent continuity. As in “Speckled Band,” Holmes notices the signs of abuse on Lady Brackenstall’s arm; but in canon, after she dismisses them as unrelated, he continues to assume that everything she’s telling him is true. As I’ve argued before, the Granada adaptations of “Speckled Band” and “Copper Beeches” provide some evidence that the Granada team was interpreting these stories through a more contemporary understanding of domestic violence and sexual abuse. The same thing seems to be happening with “Abbey Grange,” and you can see this most clearly in the reaction shots of Holmes and Watson while Lady Brackenstall tells her story. For one thing, it’s clear that Holmes never believes Lady Brackenstall’s account of her alcoholic husband for an instant. He’s drawn his own conclusions based on the hatpin stab wounds and the way she frames the story. He’s pretty sure that she’s minimizing both his drinking and his abuse of her from the beginning. When Watson compliments her on the “compassion” of her narrative, they have an Exchange of Glances which is priceless: Watson looks over at Holmes with an approving smile, and Holmes looks back at him with barely-disguised astonishment and disappointment, before returning to Lady Brackenstall and listening to her narrative with cynical skepticism.
The good old canon can still surprise you. The absolute best thing about either the canon or the Granada “Red Circle” is the landlady bonding between Mrs. Hudson and Mrs. Warren, Holmes’s initial client. Mrs. Warren has a tenant whose conduct she finds so grievous that she needs to call in a detective to help her deal with it; every time she mentions one of her tenant’s crimes, Holmes basically says, listen, I do the same thing only worse, why don’t you go home and be glad you’re not MY landlady. But Mrs. Hudson’s solidarity is not to be shaken, and Mrs. Warren eventually gets Holmes’s attention. Then, when Mrs. Warren gets overexcited and is in danger of hysterics, Holmes comes around behind her and puts his hands on her shoulders and gives them a little squeeze…and she calms down. I saw that and thought, “What, is that a yoga move?” But I turned to the canon story, and lo:
Hawkesworth deals with this the only way you really can: by forcing the viewer to share the
The image you see above is from the end of the episode, while they’re waiting for the notorious Abe Slaney to ride over from Eldridge’s farm in answer to the coded message Holmes just sent him. Inspector Martin has asked Holmes how he figured this out. Watson jumps in and starts explaining. As he goes on telling the story of how they deciphered the messages, the camera closes in and you can see Holmes doing his best not to laugh. He’s smoking, and smiling, and graciously not calling attention to the fact that Watson has learned everything he now knows about codes from a monograph Holmes wrote on the subject. Early in the investigation, Holmes asks him whether he’s read this monograph, and Watson says, “Some of it…I found it rather heavy going.” Later on, as their flat starts filling up with chalkboards and dancing figures, Watson sits down with a paper and surreptitiously slips the code monograph behind it, studying up on the sly. When Watson asks what “ABESLANE” means, instead of telling him, Holmes says, “Watson, if this is ‘E’…”:
I will occasionally be referencing

It’s amazing, when you think about it, what has happened to the concept of the “London fog.” Since they are a thing of the past (for now), and thanks to film, TV, and songs like “A Foggy Day in London Town,” people now associate the phrase “London fog” with romance, nostalgia, beauty, and sophistication. London Fog is the name of a clothing company. You can get a London Fog Latte at Starbuck’s. (It has Earl Grey in it.) Someone write a fic where Holmes and Watson are suddenly catapulted to modern times and Watson is horrified to discover that people are DRINKING this stuff. ON PURPOSE. And PAYING for it. I mean, to him, it would be like ordering a Nuclear Waste Slurry. Extra points if it’s a coffeeshop AU.
There are numerous nifty moments in “The Red Headed League,” but the mature me has a better appreciation for this one now than I did in my youth:
was such an adaptation. Many of us were waiting to see if Moffat and Gatiss would ever bring in “Three Garridebs.” Many of us thought maybe the “I love you” moment in the S4 trailer might have had something to do with “Three Garridebs.” And in fact, in “The Final Problem,” they DO bring in “The Three Garridebs!”
(Yes, I know that last gif is actually from “Wisteria Lodge.” No letters please.)
Maybe he’s also jealous of Percy. I say this, not just because I ship the ship (though I do), but because a lot of Holmes’s stranger behavior seems to happen around Percy. When it’s just the two of them investigating, everything seems to click, and there are some wonderful moments–like the scene in Phelps’s office with Inspector Forbes. He comes in bitching about how Holmes uses their information and take the credit; Holmes goes off on him; and when a chastened Forbes asks them where they’re going next, Watson REALLY enjoys telling him they’re going to see Lord Holdhurst. But while they’re interviewing Percy and Annie, and Watson keeps trying to help out by pointing things out on the map, Holmes barely acknowledges him, and seems to be getting more and more irritated. That night, back in 221B, when Watson asks Holmes if he’s all right, Holmes brushes it off. But when Watson gets up to go, Holmes gets positively plaintive: “I won’t detain you any longer from your *legitimate* work,” he says, but he hopes Watson will come to Woking with him the next morning. Watson’s hugely pleased to get the invite, and walks out calling, “Good night, Holmes.” Holmes sits there as the door closes, brooding. And at the end, when Percy offers Holmes his hand, Holmes avoids shaking it by handing Percy his cane instead:
I’m all of sixteen
. It’s established in the King’s first interview that Irene Adler is not really a blackmailer in the ordinary sense of the word; the King has tried to buy the photograph but she won’t sell it. What she wants is for him to marry her and not someone else. As soon as she doesn’t want that any more, she’s done. In this adaptation, they underline that by showing her tossing The Photograph from the deck of the ship in which she and Godfrey are sailing for the Continent, like Rose throwing away the Heart of the Ocean.
“What do you mean, Holmes?”
And you’re onthe screen,

grief is not pleasurable and it doesn’t look or sound like what viewers are used to. Martin Freeman, during Mary Morstan’s death scene in “The Six Thatchers,” tried to keep it real–and got mocked by fans for failing to follow convention. Speaking of Freeman, let me say that the effectiveness of his performance of in “The Reichenbach Fall” depends largely on the fact that John, in general, suppresses his emotions. Because he actually witnesses the “death,” John’s initial reaction is shock and disbelief, and that’s performed pretty full-bore. John’s actual grief, on the other hand, is repressed, so that we can

What else is there to say? They would not have made this episode the way they did if they’d had any other choice. But I do find the “third eye” thing very unsettling. It’s a very strange way of compensating for his physical deterioration. I mean I know Holmes is the greatest reasoner who ever lived; but do we actually have to give him mystical omniscience? Could we just not let him stay a human, increasingly broken as he appears to be?
Below, I will discuss the good, the bad, and the gratuitously misogynistic. You have been warned.
The investigation itself is, as I said, entertaining, and yet I did start to kind of get impatient with the way Bowen kept taking short cuts. There’s a lot less actual tracking, and a lot more stumbling across things. Instead of tracking down Heidegger’s body, Holmes finds it by following the crows; OK, points for atmosphere. Instead of tracking the patched-tire bicycle to the “squalid inn,” they go there because–of course–Watson’s hungry, and it’s the only place for lunch. And here…I know it will disappoint, but honestly, although I like Hardwicke fine, in these more recent episodes I find I do really miss Burke. I just can’t help wishing I were watching him instead. Sorry, Hardwicke fans. You never forget your first, I guess.
Jeremy Paul’s adaptation of “Naval Treaty” doesn’t do a great job of making sense of Holmes’s behavior; if anything, it gets weirder. After the first trip to Woking, as he’s headed off to bed, Watson says, “Are you all right?” A lot of things about Holmes seem to be off in this one, and it’s hard to know whether that was the result of intention or of the lack of it. But the theory does occur to me–and it’s probably occurred to others before me–that maybe, in fact, the point here is that Holmes is not, in fact, all right. And that this may have to do with the fact that this is, AFAIK, the only case in the canon that involves someone from Watson’s past.
"You may as well," I sighed, with a shrug. Holmes extracted the ball of paper and sat down at my desk. I returned to the day's old news, feigning indifference. I heard him gently smooth out each crumpled page with his fingertips, then turn it over and reach for the next.
But when we get beyond the H/W stuff, this episode is just not very how. It’s true there is an attempt at exciting sympathy for our primate cousins, and there’s this interesting shot of Holmes in the zoo, one exhibit among many:
"I would burnish all the iron in Charles's rusting diadem," Holmes said, as his hands rose into the air. His fingers danced, gently, lovingly, along invisible strands of wire. "I would lace it with the gold from that wretched coronet. I would set the thirty-nine beryls--or thirty-six, or three, no matter--in a ring around the band. The black pearl, I would fix in the center, with the blue carbuncle flashing on its left hand and a Bohemian emerald blazing on its right."
Now, comparing Gibson to the Buttercup In Chief is slightly unfair to Gibson in that Gibson can use the English language competently and has actually been successful in business. But Gibson is the same kind of rich asshole who thinks rules are for the little people, and who bullies even the people who are trying to help him. Also, he’s a sexual predator. The canon story includes a conversation about this which is, compared to the way these issues are handled in the earlier stories, pretty explicit. Holmes tells Gibson straight up that whatever he felt for Dunbar, he shouldn’t have told her about it, since she was “under his protection.” And here’s Gibson’s response:
And so when he apologizes, and says that this experience was “an unjustifiable experiment even for one’s self, and doubly so for a friend,” it’s not just about the poison. It’s about the Fall. Holmes finally understands enough about what he did to offer a truly meaningful apology. This is the moment that the gulf between them closes, and the relationship is truly repaired. And I only wish they would have stayed with Hardwicke a little longer to let us watch this sink in for Watson.
(A+ for use of Mrs. Hudson in this episode, by the way.)
This is so bizarrely out of context for “The Six Napoleons” that I initially assumed I must have opened the wrong window or started it in the middle or something. No…this is our production team setting the scene for the tale of passion, lust, vengeance, and murder that follows. Doyle contented himself with making the Venuccis a family of small-time criminals, possibly with Mafia connections, but mainly focused on the theft and sale of the Black Pearl of the Borgias. John Kane, our adapter, apparently decided to expand this into a miniature Leoncavallo opera by positing a romance between Lucretia Venucci (it’s the black pearl of the BORGIAS, see) and Beppo, the workman who hides the pearl in the bust of Napoleon. By the way, Lucretia is played in this episode by someone I am quite familiar with, but shockingly did not recognize at all:
So we’re four epsiodes into this series and we’ve seen that syringe in three of them.
“The diabolical business of that monstrous hound–”
This story was adapted by Derek Marlowe, who appears to have been under the impression that his name should have been Philip Marlowe. The first half is quite entertaining, even endearing, in classic Granada Holmes style. Then, Marlowe runs out of story, and fills out the rest of the hour with a hardboiled detective AU involving a chase on a train, guns, extrajudicial murder, and a femme fatale. “You still retain your low opinion of women,” says Mycroft to Sherlock, after the case wraps up. No, Mycroft; no, he doesn’t. I hate to be the one to break it to you…but that man you’re talking to isn’t really your brother.
how long he was going to be writing Sherlock Holmes stories, he would never have married Watson off. Doyle had zero interest in Watson’s marriage from a character development point of view; in ACD canon after
I should also talk about how much I love the way they handle Holmes’s opening conversation with Watson about his brother. In the story as written, Mycroft comes up as part of a discussion about heredity. Doyle obviously believes in nature over nurture; many of the saga’s biggest and baddest villains (Moriarty, Magnussen, Roylott, Kemp) are described as products of bad breeding–or, as Doyle puts it in Kemp’s case, “the foulest antecedents.” One of Mycroft’s purposes is to confirm that intelligence is hereditary; only DNA could account for the birth of two such prodigies to the same parents. Now that Charles Murray is back in circulation on American college campuses, Doyle’s determinism seems even creepier to me than usual, so it’s a relief that in the adaptation, the focus is on Holmes’s finessing of the delicate business of revealing to Watson that in fact he’s not entirely alone in the world. He’s obviously nervous about it because he’s laid out a very careful plan of attack: bring Mycroft up in casual conversation, then see if Watson’s interested, and if he bites, then let him know Mycroft has a case for him and see if he wants to go. Holmes is obviously watching Watson for his reactions, and although he acts annoyed by Watson’s enthusiasm, he must secretly be thrilled by it. It’s a big deal, bringing the “intimate friend” to meet the family.
much in this one, my exposure to Sherlock does make me more interested in the question Hammond and his mirrors raise in “Wisteria Lodge”: When is a motif a symbol, and when is it just a trick? In other words, as the viewer, can we really tell the difference between something intended to create meaning, and something the director just happens to think is a cool effect? And does it really matter?
It absolutely baffles me that Moffat and Gatiss passed up the opportunity to do their take on “The Speckled Band.” It’s name-checked in “Scandal in Belgravia” in the title John gives one of Sherlock’s cases (”The Speckled Blonde”); but that’s all. As a story that feels very modern in some ways but is encumbered with Victorian Orientalism plus whatever it is that explains the 19th century British fascination with “gypsies,” and in which the H/W relationship game is pretty strong, you’d think it would be right in their wheelhouse. Well, never mind; Granada did one, and they did it right. There are of course some production values-related misfires. But the guest star playing Helen Stoner is a cut above; the creepiness is indeed creepy; and most of all, Brett and Burke make beautiful music together. And all of this gets even more affecting if you read “The Speckled Band,” as I do–and as I believe the whole production team does–as another story in which Helen Stoner was in more danger than Doyle was able to tell us about at the time.
connects him to a
So let me first say that the real mystery of “Priory School” is: what in the world is going on at 221b *before* Dr. Huxtable shows up? The lights are down, the candles are lit, Watson is whispering, and Holmes is lying flat on the couch, apparently but evidently not really asleep. Watson seems not to want him disturbed. Holmes doesn’t show any signs of consciousness until Huxtable collapses on the floor, at which point he springs bolt upright. Is this some more of that “lethargy” he was talking about at the beginning of “The Musgrave Ritual?” Has Watson taken to supervising him during his drug trips now? Or have they just had a romantic candlelight dinner and were hoping, after a digestive nap, for a little postprandial private entertainment? Or what? When Huxtable asks Holmes to come back to the Priory School with him, Holmes starts talking about how busy they both are, while Watson looks at him with evident surprise. So what’s going on? Why’s he pretending he’s busy when he isn’t?
"What?"
; but Brett will always be Holmes in my heart. Brett and Burke were the team that inspired my first ever Holmes/Watson fanfic, “
I assume this is all so that we can start feeling Unnerved and Unsettled by the ominous approach of the Ape Within. Chapman does try to bring out the horror aspects of the story, emphasizing the incest overtones (Presbury’s face at Edith’s window, the fact that he’s violently in love with a girl Edith’s age) and making explicit the threat of sexual violence represented by Presbury’s ‘rejuvenation’ (Alice breaks off the engagement; that night, Presbury invades her bedroom and is obviously planning to rape her). And I guess that’s not a stupid idea; but honestly, no matter how you dress it up on the way there, the moment will eventually come when you are asked to be shocked and horrified…
Immediately after Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, the rest of us watched appalled as people on the racist right started comparing both Barack Obama and Michelle Obama to gorillas, monkeys, apes, etc., verbally and visually. The grotesque resurrection of this racist trope was startling, sudden, and extremely disturbing. So that’s part of my baggage as a twenty-first century American watching this episode, and I’m sure it influenced my response to it.
"I enjoyed it tremendously," he said.
In the canon story, Watson’s narration hints that Holmes’s vices may have had something to do with the health crisis that sends them out to the back end of Cornwall. Holmes has ground himself down with “constant hard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional indiscretions of his own.” Gary Hopkins, the screenwriter, takes this hint and runs with it, using this episode to resolve Holmes’s addiction storyline. But, as I’m going to argue, Holmes’s addiction is revealed, in this episode, to be a symptom of, or a metaphor for, something much deeper.
that in the end, the Moonstone
"And that makes a difference?"
Why is it that this children’s party of the damned seems to me like it could also be Halloween night at the Holmes children’s house? Eurus in the middle, Sherlock next to her, Mycroft in the foreground giving us that “how long must I endure this hilarity” glare, and poor old Victor Trevor in the background checking out his pirate sword.
, things between Holmes and Watson start to get weird. In
The best scene from the Switzerland trip is the conversation after Holmes gets the note telling him Moriarty has escaped. Holmes tries to get Watson to go home, for his own safety. The canon story doesn’t report what Watson says in response, only that this “was hardly an appeal to be successful with one who was an old campaigner as well as an old friend.” Hawkesworth lets Watson articulate, to a limited extent, some of what’s compressed into that line: “I’m not leaving you, Holmes. Not unless you order me to go.” Holmes looks back at him; and he doesn’t give the order. Watson’s just dared Holmes to break up with him; Holmes has acknowledged that he can’t stand to do it. This situation is its own emotional maelstrom; but all we actually

of this episode is good; and pretty much all the good has to do with the way Chapman writes the Great Partnership. As in “Illustrious Client,” Chapman rescues the relationship from the wretched state into which it has deteriorated in the canon story. Surely this is the saddest paragraph in all of Watson’s narration:
that conversation. And this brings me to:
All right. So, in the ACD canon story, once Lady Hilda comes into the picture, there is a lot of byplay about Women. This is the story in which Holmes utters the fateful words, “The fair sex is your department, Watson.” Watson describes Hilda as possibly the most beautiful woman in London, and then Holmes goes off on how hard women are to read, because they’re so concerned about their appearance that they will skulk in the shadows and act guilty when in fact it may just be that they’re having a bad hair day. The adaptation keeps some of this; but it’s counteracted by the actress playing Lady Hilda, who either hadn’t read the canon story or had read it but decided she didn’t give a fuck. In the canon story, Lady Hilda is basically a hot mess; she’s always terrified, always on the verge of tears, always pale, and always doing a lot of Bad Acting to telegraph her guilt. Well, Patricia Hodge is having none of that. Her Lady Hilda has nerves of…well, maybe not steel exactly. Whalebone, maybe. At any rate, she comes into 221B swinging her class privilege left and right. She fences with Holmes instead of pleading with him. In her dealings with Eduardo Lucas, which are staged in the adaptation, she comes across as vulnerable but also intelligent, sophisticated, and willing to do some dirt if she decides it’s necessary. In other words, she’s a lot more like her husband the diplomat than he thinks she is. In her first interview with Holmes, she mentions that her husband won’t discuss politics with her, ever; in her last interview with him, right before Hope arrives, she tells him that she agreed to steal the Potentate’s Letter because she had no idea what it would mean–and she couldn’t have, because nobody’s ever wanted her to understand what her husband does or indeed politics in general. All that’s in canon. What’s not in canon is the speech Trelawney gives while embracing Hilda after he discovers (as he thinks) that the letter was in the box all along–in which he talks to her patronizingly about how of course she can’t possibly understand this because it’s politics, but she should just know that things have suddenly turned out really well. It makes the point that he, and all the men around him, have been underestimating her (and all the women like her) all their lives. Trelawney has no idea that his wife has not only stolen his precious document out of his box but witnessed a murder, done an unauthorized search of a crime scene, and bearded Holmes Himself in his den–or indeed that she has a) ever lied to him b) is lying to him now and c) plans to lie to him for the forseeable future. Hilda and Trelawney go back into their happy marriage which is now full of forbidden secrets–all of which Hilda knows, and none of which Trelawney knows.
Beyond the cut tag I will take up this question, and also address the episode as a whole. The short story is: I miss ‘my’ Watson. Almost as much as this poor bastard in the above photo does at this moment. But I’m willing to give the new guy a chance.

. She’s compassionate and gracious to those ‘below’ her in the social hierarchy; he’s contemptuous and abusive. She’s motivated by love; he’s motivated by self-interest. She appreciates music and art; he apparently only appreciates money, power, and sex. She’s capable of being magnanimous to a defeated adversary; everything we know about the King suggests that he likes to grind his own adversaries into the dirt.
But Green isn’t the only man in this story who rides roughshod over Lady Frances’s autonomy. After all, in the canon story, at least someone connected with Lady Frances has asked Holmes to take the case. In Bowen’s script, nobody asks Holmes to intervene–not even Watson. Watson, who I will point out seems to be the only man Lady Frances knows who has ever respected her autonomy, has simply befriended her while on holiday and written to Holmes about her. It’s Holmes who decides, based on his silent games with his little figures and his perusal of the daily papers, that Lady Frances needs their help. Indeed, from an objective point of view, in the adaptation Lady Frances doesn’t “disappear;” she just leaves the hotel without telling anyone where she’s going. One imagines that if she had stuck around to see Holmes and Watson burst in on her and tell her she’s in mortal danger, she would have yelled at both of them to get out of her life too.
Another bit of good adapting is the explanation of the body in the fire. This fixes a problem with canon–I know they didn’t have forensic anthropologists back then, but could Scotland Yard REALLY have been faked out “with a dead dog or rabbits”?–with something suggested but never followed up in canon. When he’s trying to come up with an alternative theory that would explain Lestrade’s evidence, he says, well, suppose a tramp was passing by, saw what was going on, snuck in thinking he could steal something valuable, and then brained Oldacre. This isn’t much of a theory in canon, but Harris turns it into its own little B-plot by giving the tramp an identity and making him Oldacre’s victim instead of his murderer. This allows Holmes to do one of the disguise things he loves so much; and it also actually verifies
There are a lot of surprises in “Shoscombe Old Place,” because about 75% of this episode is extrapolation. In most ways, the extrapolations improve the story, which I evidently found one of the least memorable.

The strategy Holmes eventually decides to pursue–have Watson write down Turner’s dictated confession, get him to sign it, and then keep it in reserve in case McCarthy is convicted–is, from a legal point of view, unbelievably risky. Especially if Turner is dead, there’s no guarantee they could establish the authenticity of that confession to anyone’s satisfaction. Watson is worthless as a witness; he’s too close to Holmes. The document is in Watson’s handwriting and it would be easy enough to forge a signature. If Holmes waits until McCarthy is actually
When it’s your time to go.
Ah well. One more left.
The Holmes stories stay up to date with all of this; but at the same time, they pulse with an already-nostalgic love for the handwritten document. These documents conceal mysteries and have to be decoded, even when they are not (as in “Dancing Men,” for instance) actually written in code. From the King of Bohemia’s stationery to the desperate note scrawled by “D” in “Wisteria Lodge,” paper in the Holmes stories is a landscape of mystery and intrigue whose secrets always yield themselves up to Holmes eventually.
. But maybe they were afraid they couldn’t do it as well as Granada did.
’s incorporation of “Priory School” into “The Reichenbach Fall” as a later example of that same shift in focus from the adults to the children; and it becomes a major problem for Sherlock that he doesn’t perform the appropriate amount of concern for the kidnapped siblings when they find the abandoned chocolate factory. In their version, the murder and the kidnapping have been combined, and the adult victim has disappeared completely.
I wondered about that. I think there are basically two readings here:

’s standards and practices, he refers to this possibility as “the worst fate that can befall a woman.” That’s also one of the things Carruthers obviously thinks he’s protecting Violet from by following her on her rides back and forth to the train station. Like a lot of male attempts to “protect” women, however, this is really just endangerment in disguise; in order to keep her near him, he keeps her vulnerable to Woodley. As the solitary cyclist–or, as we would put it, stalker–he becomes an embodiment of the danger he tells himself he’s protecting her from. Which shows you how messed up patriarchal logic is; but at least it means that Violet finally has something concrete she can ask Holmes to investigate, apart from her vague intuitions that something about this situation is pretty fucked up.
nor was it entirely mandated by canon that the soundtrack should become dominated by the sound of Tibetan meditation bowls–as it does. (This brought back unpleasant memories of my own cancer saga years ago, because my mother’s way of being helpful was to bring up a set of meditation tapes made by some breast cancer doctor/guru her friend was into, in which these meditation bowls were played while the doctor intoned, “IMAGINE THAT YOUR HEART IS AN EGG-SHAPED BALL OF LIGHT” in a voice like a buzz-saw.) When Holmes goes to wash his hands and face–an action they seem to love showing; not that I complain, but I do wonder why–they put it in slow motion and honestly it looks for a moment as if we’re just gonna go full-on
"So you liked 'Blue Carbuncle,' " I said, for the pleasure of hearing him tell me again.
: 1) Everything’s better with more Watson and 2) all the changes you make should come from canon. Watson’s expanded role in this one provides a lot of the entertainment. Holmes himself is vastly entertained by the fact that Watson knows so much about racing, and is both sincerely grateful to him for offering up his story of knowledge and also kind of dragging him for it. Watson providing a diversion while Holmes cases the joint is also entertaining; I mean none of what happens during that sequence is really that original, but it’s fun, and their reunion behind the tree on the lawn is a great little tidbit. Giving Holmes the chance to swipe some hairs from the brush allows Paul to actually make the microscope hair-and-fiber bit at the opening of “Shoscombe Old Place” relevant to the solution of the mystery. The crypt scenes are spooky enough, though frankly I found the giant spider on Lady Beatrice’s corpse
With mysterious fears—
What I mainly remember from reading “Illustrious Client” for the first time, in my vanished youth, was an anxious concern over the state of Holmes and Watson’s relationship. “Illustrious Client” was published in 1924, and belongs to the period where, as Watson says, their “relations” had become “peculiar.” In ACD canon, once you get past
So let me say, first of all, that for Doyle, what Holmes does with this unidentified white powder is certainly on the edge, but it’s not so far outside the box as to be
I’m just going to go ahead and say that this has to have been on some level a deliberate fuck-you to the Johnlock contingent. Why else would you invoke this story and all it represents, only to deploy it in this utterly meaningless and entirely ridiculous way? Of all the bait-and-switches that show perpetrated–and there have been MANY–I think this must rank as one of the cruelest.
"Whereas, to you," I began.
So, this is all very dramatic (though the fall to the death is not well staged). And I sympathize with Bowen’s feeling that none of the adults in this story are thinking enough about Arthur. What I object to is that in order to avoid having Holmes let the Duke off the hook, Bowen lets the Duke off the hook himself. In Bowen’s adaptation, the Duke is never in on it; he doesn’t go to the inn, nor allow Wilder to let Ruben Hayes escape, nor promise to leave Arthur at the inn for three days so the police don’t find out where Arthur’s been and go after Hayes. These are all things that Holmes quite rightly roasts the Duke for during their final confrontation in Doyle’s story; and I’m sorry to lose that. Instead, Holmes winds up befriending the Duke, listening sympathetically when he opens up about his first love, and giving the Duke the chance to make it right by ordering the search party. So the Duke still gets off; we just don’t have to blame Holmes for it any more. The Duke also STILL writes Holmes a huge check; but now it’s out of gratitude for Holmes helping him See The Light, rather than as a bribe.
So one thing that all of us want with the sharpest of longings is, one day, to see a really
* Once at the Copper Beeches, Violet searches the place (discovering Alice’s coil of hair and the inhabitant of the locked-up wing of the house), uses the mirror trick to figure out what’s behind her when she’s sitting in front of the window, and in general gets so close to uncovering the secret that Rucastle threatens to feed her to the mastiff if she doesn’t STOP investigating.
This is a brilliant episode for character development, and all three actors make the most of the opportunity. In ACD canon, “The Six Napoleons” marks a major shift in the way Holmes and Lestrade interact. The adaptation takes this farther, finally making Lestrade a real character and laying, one could argue, the foundation for Greg Lestrade’s character and his relationship with Sherlock on Sherlock. Granada’s “Empty House” establishes that during the Hiatus, Lestrade and Watson developed their own working relationship, and in this episode they both follow Holmes around like residents following the attending. Holmes obviously really enjoys the extra attention, and it spurs him to new heights of histrionics that are quite entertaining and by this time quite familiar. But it’s the final conversation between Holmes and Lestrade at the end of this episode that makes it worth sitting through all the BS about Italians. At that point, this episode becomes truly extraordinary. You would think that by this point in the series you’d have pretty much seen everything Brett could do with this character. But you would be wrong.
of detection. His whole gig is resolving apparently supernatural or mysterious occurrences into rationally explicable phenomena. And no matter how you slice it, that is just not what happens in “The Creeping Man.” The solution is impossible for a twenty-first century person (at least one with a basic grasp of human biology and modern science) to believe. And unlike with other problematic solutions, such as in “Speckled Band” or “Norwood Builder,” it’s not wrong in some partial and fixable way. It is wrong completely and totally, from one end to the other.
“I quite agree, Holmes. The last one brought me nothing but misery.”
And it starts to seem, during that conversation in the shed, that Holmes might have been chewing on that deduction for a while, and that Watson is starting to finally get it. Murder, of course, is appalling enough. But in that moment of unspoken explication– “I begin to see what you are driving at,” says the man who normally needs such things spelled out for him–I think we can see the transmission of forbidden knowledge.
. The precautions he tells Watson to take, so the theory goes, are just enough to give the ruse some credibility; Holmes always intended Moriarty to follow him, and the trip draws him deeper and deeper into the wilderness, where it will be easier for Holmes to get to him. This seems too cold-blooded and calculating to me, so I’ve always opted for a simpler fan theory: Holmes knows he’s going to die, and he wants to spend his last days on holiday with Watson. That makes perfect sense to me.
problem in "Empty House” than it would have been in almost any other episode. There is the awkwardness of the Reichenbach reconstruction, for example, where Watson is shot from so far away you have no idea WHO’s playing him, and is also clearly not standing where Burke was during the corresponding scene in “Final Problem.” But it cannot be denied that the main problem is that it would just be more powerful for the viewer if the person who welcomed Holmes back were the person who had actually lost him. Chemistry between actors doesn’t happen overnight; it’s built up over time as they work together and begin to trust and rely on each other. Burke and Brett’s chemistry was cooking at a pretty good clip by the time they hit “Speckled Band.” All that went up the spout, and it can’t be recovered; it has to be rebuilt. It just isn’t there yet for Brett and Hardwicke. Hardwicke is also at a disadvantage in the reunion scene in that he doesn’t have an established character or an established relationship to draw on; he has to
I drew the lilac envelope carefully from the pile. It was addressed to me, in Mary's clear and confident handwriting. It contained an enclosure.
I will say, though, I do kind of love the Lunch Episode. It’s all so awkward and weird and sinister and there’s Watson, who can certainly tell something’s going on, and is very curious about the parallel scratches on Hayes’s neck, but is still trying to act like a customer anyway. And then he gets his black pudding and sad accompaniments. “How is it, Watson?” “It is disgusting, Holmes.”
All this is just to say that although you wouldn’t call this a good episode, and although it’s now clear that Brett’s illness is affecting his performance, and though this is based on what I would say is the Actual Worst Story In The Sherlock Holmes Canon And That’s Up Against Some Stiff Competition, there is something interesting to watch in “Three Gables.” If “Eligible Bachelor” is about mental illness, “Three Gables” is preoccupied with aging. Both Langdale Pike–pictured above in one of those window-reflection shots that director Peter Hammond is so freaking enamored of–and Holmes’s adversary Isadora Klein are creatures of fashion who are aging out of the cult of youth and beauty that created the rarefied atmosphere in which they flourish. The strongest thing about this episode, whether it was intentional or simply unavoidable, is the way Holmes’s interactions with them confront him and us with some uncomfortable but inescapable truths about what it means to be mortal.
, it is never anything more than a logistical problem. Mary Morstan plays virtually no role in any of the other stories. What Doyle seems to have really wanted is what most fans have always wanted: the two of them together in their bachelor pad in Baker Street, unencumbered by other human relationships (in canon, Mycroft is the only family member we ever meet, and he only shows up twice). So I have no problem with Hawkesworth’s decision to suppress the marriage. What I think was a mistake was to suppress the marriage

You can just see it in the eyes and the smile: All right, fuck this guy. It’s not about the puzzle for him any more. This is about getting Helen Stoner away from this asshole. And yeah, this is a story about a woman being saved by a man; but one of the things I like about it is that Brett and the director seem, to some extent, self-conscious about the way Holmes uses the privilege Victorian society grants him as a gentleman to block Roylott’s abuse of the same privilege. There’s an interesting cut in which Holmes walks toward his desk to get the record of Mrs. Farintosh’s case, and the next thing we see is Roylott going through Helen’s room and finding Mrs. Farintosh’s letter. Brett plays his initial consultation with Helen as if Holmes knows somehow that she’s already under surveillance: it’s as if, by demystifying his own deduction trick, he’s trying to let her know that a) he’s just as smart as Roylott is and b) there’s no magic to the way he’s keeping track of you, I know how this works and I can show you how it works.
Of course, Holmes isn’t talking about a case where the murderer had what is considered a material motive. Perhaps the reason this case unsettles him so much is that the motive seems nonsensical to him. Holmes, a connoisseur of the weird and the outre, stands baffled before one of the most common kinds of murder there is: a man killing a woman because she refuses to belong to him. It seems to Holmes, perhaps, as a crime which is peculiarly without an “object.” Jim Browder, miserable enough before the murders, is now suicidal and eager to end a nightmarish existence. His wife is no more within his grasp now than she was before. The one thing Browder *has* ‘accomplished’ by killing Mary (and, incidentally, her lover) is hurting Sarah Cushing–and he even fucked up that part by sending the package to the wrong sister. Does having stuck it to Sarah Cushing really compensate Browder for what his murders destroyed? It appears not. So no human object was served. As for the divine or providential object for which Holmes is searching…it’s bad enough if the world is “ruled by chance,” but WTF is ruling the world if whatever it is WANTS THIS?
I want to talk about what I think is the fundamental problem with

That’s Moriarty’s hand up top; he’s studying a map of Saxe-Coburg square because he’s the mastermind behind the bank job that the Red-Headed League is a cover for. And that hand down below is Watson’s, drawing a map of the same location on the 221B chalkboard.
episode, in which Mulder and Scully undertake an investigation which requires them to navigate a close-knit immigrant community with a Strange And Alien Culture, often with the help of a lower-ranking FBI agent or cop who’s from that culture and serves as their informant ( “Shapes,” “Hell Money,” “El Mondo Gira,” etc.). That’s basically the approach that Lestrade takes, both here and in the canon story: there’s an Inspector Hill who apparently specializes in policing London’s Italian quarter, and he’s responsible for identifying Pietro’s body and providing Lestrade with most of his wins. Holmes, who doesn’t have access to all this information, decides instead to follow the busts, and this turns out to do a better job of predicting Beppo’s next move. My point is, the adaptation elaborates on the Italian characters but it never really escapes the Doyle story’s assumption that Italian immigrants in London are both uncontrollably violent, possibly mad, and neck-deep in crime. It is almost as if Doyle were listening to Trump’s speeches when he came up with this plot.
