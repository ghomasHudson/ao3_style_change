“I did,” said Castiel.
Mary nodded. “Well, I only need four hours, so I should probably try again. Wish me luck,” she said.
“I know, Sammy. I know, it’s just — “
It was then he decided they weren’t going to drive up to Canada in this tense silence.
They took their time. There was no need to rush. It was the middle of the night, and they were safe. They were home and no one else was awake.
Dean nodded and rose from the bed. When he stood, he had his back to Cas. Quickly, he made his way to the bathroom, grabbing the towel he had left drying on the armchair with his duffle. Castiel didn’t think anything of it until he heard the water start. Dean had showered the night before, odd for him to shower so soon.
But Dean’s memory was long. He remembered the fear in the voices of those demons in that diner in Illinois. They hadn’t understood, and thus feared, a being who could pull a soul out of Hell. And they were right to fear the angels. They were righteous and powerful.
Jody watched, unsure where this was going. She could see the effort it took to control his breathing. Then, she noticed his hands were shaking.
Dean could sense it though. He had been around the angel long enough. When Castiel first appeared, and when he placed his fingers on Dean’s forehead, and then again when he reached for his hands, Dean felt it. There was an energy emanating from him that hadn’t been there before.
“I’ve really corrupted you if you’re smoking now,” said Dean.
“What got into him?”
“Should you be drinking so quickly?”
“I only push as far as you’ll let me. You’re the angel of the Lord,” said Dean.
“I have found that Dean finds the expectations placed on men to be a burden. It has made things…difficult for him. He desperately wants to be one thing and society — and his father — have told him he needs to be something else. This causes him a great deal of grief,” said Castiel.
Realizing he’s in love with his dead best friend while trying to convince a psychic she shouldn’t follow in her grandmother’s footsteps was hard enough. But her grandmother had been an old friend, and with each passing day, Dean had less and less of those.
“I don’t.”
He and Sam had been fighting demons for years. They had made crossroads deals and exorcised their fair share. Demons they knew, and when left with no other recourse, would welcome. Angels were another story.
“Ordinarily, I would raise an objection,” said Castiel as Dean pulled into the gas station. “But given the events of the day—”
Dean hadn’t closed the door, another olive branch.
“I’m just teasing, Cas. Will you — Will you be here when I get out of the shower?”
“Does that mean I’m —”
“Where does this leave us?”
“Long enough,” said Sam. He met Castiel’s eyes but didn’t say anything more.
“I am a seraph,” said Castiel, as if Dean knew what that meant.
Grabbing his jacket, he started to make his way back to the house. Midway, he stopped and turned back to see she hadn’t moved. He walked back to where she stood.
And he’d had the nerve, the unmitigated gall to tell Dean not to bring him back. As if Dean could ever… As if Dean could ever live without his brother, without his Sammy.
The camaraderie built from surviving the unthinkable helped the brothers form strong bonds. They would turn to their friends, their colleagues. No longer needing to reach for the journal, it spent more and more time in the trunk. Yet another weapon kept within arm’s reach for when he wanted to turn it on himself.
He kissed him.
Thus, though Dean did everything his father ever asked, he was never awarded for his diligence. It was expected, not exemplary.
All the Mark did was free that beast. Free the evil. Why else would Cain have passed on the Mark? He already knew what lay dormant. He had been trained to kill. A Marine had taught him to shoot and he was a sharpshooter. Bobby had said he was a better man than John had ever been, and Dean didn’t know if he believed it, but he knew how to shoot better than his old man.
Castiel looked away and blushed. Dean closed the distance between them and reached for his hand.
Dean slid into Baby and looked over at Jody. She was looking ahead, but her eyes were still glassy. At least she wasn’t crying anymore. He wasn’t sure he could handle that. He had never known how to handle tears. He had cried so many times while driving down winding roads and quiet stretches of highway, but he did his best to keep it under check. He made sure to wait until Sammy was asleep.
“Dean, I – I can explain.”
He needed a drink to calm his nerves. He left the room and made his way back to the kitchen. He knew he was being followed and he knew who was following him, but he didn’t turn around until he had a beer in his hands.
He was tired and he wanted to rest.
“Don’t tell me you appeared before him on the side of the road?”
Sometime later, Dean reached for his hand, and their fingers interlocked.
“I was too — I was overcome with emotion,” said Castiel.
He was relieved and in disbelief, and finally, he spoke. Words forming slowly, as if testing the waters.
Then, she heard footsteps approaching.
“That’s all? You were gone for hours. How long where you… Where’d you even go?”
“No, no. I — I wasn’t going to appear before him at all. I was just… Doesn’t matter, but he reached out to me. I could… Prayers don’t have to be formal. I can sense… I sensed he needed me. He missed me, has been missing me this whole time. I just thought… I’ve done it so many times before; how was I to know this time it would lead to catastrophe?”
The people in that hospital. Charlie’s blood on his knuckles. He had hurt her. He was supposed to protect her from the monsters, not be the monster. It had felt good to kill her killers, but it didn’t bring her back, and it never would. He hoped she was at peace. He hoped she was reunited with her parents. He hoped she could heal. It would be nice if one of them could. She was always the best of them, and she was gone far too soon.
He didn’t know what it was, and he didn’t know why it felt familiar, just that it did. And he trusted it, implicitly. After all, it was a part of him. And despite what he said, he knew he could only rely on himself were it all to come to an end.
Dean leaned over and reached for the mug as Castiel closed the door behind him. Dean licked his lips in anticipation. Castiel loved him, early in the morning, just like this: content.
“Cas, you know I do,” he said.
and finally, seemed to understand:
She was calm, but there was an uneasiness Castiel couldn’t mistake. How could he? She and Dean were so similar. And yet, they couldn’t see that, wouldn’t see that.
She ran her finger down the front and hugged it to her chest. The boys in this picture, these were her kids. The ones she remembered, not the man sitting on the bed in front of her, trying his best to keep his composure.
“No, I don’t think it does. I don’t fight anymore. And I should be getting back,” said Castiel.
As if on cue, Dean said, “I’ve been catching more fish.”
“A paramedic came up to me and asked me if he had kin or next of kin. I gave her Sam’s number without hesitation. I’m ashamed to admit, but I didn’t have the courage to speak to him, and she wouldn’t have expected me to do so.”
“I wasn’t asking,” said Castiel before taking flight.
He felt as if he hadn’t spoken in years. And yet, there was hope in his voice. He was incredulous, of course, but the words were an exaltation.
“I see the way you stare at me,” said Dean.
“And you. You said yes,” he said.
“These are poems,” said Cas.
Seeing Dean awake flooded him with relief. These human emotions were strange. Too much, all at once, or nothing at all for long stretches. It was difficult to keep track of which emotions where a response to which stimuli.
Hundreds of people had touched his shoulder, in passing. And hundreds of people had touched the mark, but this was the first time she touched had touched the mark, and he flinched.
“What happened?”
He was still staring out the window.
“Why… Why? Why did we wait so long? Why didn’t I just tell you one of the other times you were in my dreams? Why didn’t I tell you all the times we were sitting like this or in the kitchen in the middle of the night, when I couldn’t sleep, and you wanted to spend time with me?”
“No, I’m not going to ask him for help,” said Castiel.
“Dean,” said Castiel.
“So, what happened?”
Cas always answered his calls, was always there to comfort him.
Dean threw his head back and closed his eyes, and suddenly, Castiel understood déjà vu.
“Can’t believe I’m discussing feelings, of all things, but he will resent this,” said Crowley.
“The Darkness herself brought you back. And I’m trying to make the most of it, but mom… I need you to play your part. I need you to try,” he said.
Castiel saw now that they were both wrong. Mary didn’t want Dean to censor their lives and she didn’t want to connect with Sam, the hunter. She wanted the life of which she had been robbed, the children she had left behind, and the husband she desperately missed.
And seeing Mary at the end of it all had been…everything.
“Ah, that’s difficult to explain. I know, you’ve been possessed before, but I’m unsure you’ve ever bonded…”
And so, Castiel decided Sam had given it to her.
“You’re here,” he said.
His eyes opened. Recognition dawned on him. And Castiel was looking at him, relieved. Dean started to move, to stand, and Castiel helped him to his feet. Dean met his ever-piercing gaze.
“If he doesn’t wake up, you can bargain with the reaper who will come to collect him,” said Crowley. “Unless, of course, that reaper is Death himself. Though, knowing his sense of humor, he’d give you an audience anyway.”
It was then he noticed the larger room. The walls were still white but there was glass dividing this room and the next, which was unoccupied and dark. Naomi was seated at a large desk. The mahogany gave life to an otherwise lifeless room. Before her were neat files and a slip of a paper, on which she had started taking notes. She was recording this conversation.
The skin there was soft and warm. Pulling away, Dean turned to face his mother. She was sitting quietly, silent tears running down her cheeks.
He was too engrossed and didn’t notice when Dean slipped under the covers, for when he looked over, Dean was sound asleep.
Some days, he forgot she was a woman. She was a flesh and blood woman who cried and bled. There was something superhuman about Jody. She had lost her husband and her son in the worst of ways, but she persevered. She was still sheriff and had taken up hunting. And she was a damn good hunter. And now, she was raising Alex and Claire.
“Now if you weren’t strong enough to heal him, why do you think you’ll be strong enough to possess him and heal him by way of possession?”
“She gave you an out,” said Crowley.
“You don’t need to say it,” said Castiel.
The list of things he did on impulse kept growing.
She reached for his hand and said, “Thank you.”
“Yes,” said Castiel.
Dean nodded. He was still looking at Castiel and his mom, who were still talking.
Dean laughed and pulled him up so that they were lying side-to-side, their bodies touching. Dean confessed he had wanted to do that for a long time. And Castiel confided in him, too. Told him he had wanted to touch him as he ran his hands along his ribs.
When Sam returned with coffee and donuts, Dean was still in the shower.
“You said you were staying.”
“Drive home. Tell my brother we lost another friend. Deal with what the stork left at my feet. Kill some monsters. And drink,” said Dean with all sincerity.
Castiel stared at her blankly.
He turned to face Castiel, who was still looking away.
Dean froze. He was holding a knife. It was going to go back into the duffel with the other weapons, but he set it aside, on the edge of the bed.
It had felt good to use some of that pent-up energy, to release some of that frustration. Fucking angels and demons and their damn Apocalypse. Fuck Zachariah and Ruby and all the others.
“Oh," he said quietly.
“Don’t tell me, you want to know what all the fuss is about?”
“Cas has pictures of us, pictures of Claire — you'll meet her."
She gestured for him to sit and took notes. He hadn’t noticed the chair before or that he was standing, but he took the seat anyway.
He said it before Jody could speak, and she turned to look at him, surprise evident.
Tonight, Dean found a book at the bottom of the duffle and he held it in his hands as he flipped through the pages. Once he reached the end, he turned to face Castiel. The seraph was sitting in the corner. Since they had finished their latest hunt, there was nothing more to investigate. Castiel he hadn’t brought a book, hoping for this exact moment.
“He’s going to hate all of us,” said Sam.
Other nights, Castiel would tell him about the world. The first seas, the first mammals, the early cities. He would tell him about heaven. The other angels in his garrison and all the ways in which he had failed. And on those nights, Dean would console him.
“My mission was to save him. I hadn’t planned on… falling from grace, turning my back on Heaven, or falling in love. But I did, and I would do it over again.”
“Finished?”
“Feathers, you can’t keep coming back here,” he said.
He didn’t have to hear Castiel excuse himself or his footsteps down the hall. He knew Castiel wouldn’t be far behind. These days, Dean was trying not to push him away, an olive branch. He wouldn’t talk, not right away. Castiel’s company would soften his edges, and eventually, he’d relent.
Today, that had all changed.
They walked out of the garage together and made their way to the library. Dean wanted to ask him to come back to his room, but he couldn’t find the words. If Castiel could hear his prayer, he wasn’t answering. They had made it to the library when Castiel stopped a few inches from the table. He looked down at the ground before turning back to face him.
Patience was still waiting for an answer and Jody was looking at him as if he had grown an extra appendage. If he were honest, if he were straightforward, if he didn’t mince his words, if he just said the truth, maybe she would understand. Or, at the very least, listen.
He could feel the tears welling up. He just wanted to get the words out. He wanted to tell someone. And the person he wanted to tell couldn’t hear.
Castiel waited until Sam had stepped out to pump gas before turning to Dean. Dean was looking out the window.
Walking into that lake had been harder. He hadn’t known then what was to come, but he’s possessed a human before. This part isn’t new. Some humans disappear. They hide in a part of their mind they make their own. Jimmy had been like that. Other humans formed a bond with the angel taking charge. For them, it’s a mutually beneficial relationship; purely transactional. The angel protects the vessel and in turn, the human plays host.
“I do, you know. I love you,” said Dean, against his neck.
“John was an obsessed bastard and he put all this weight on my shoulders, but it wasn’t for me to bear. I would've never —”
The next morning, after the funeral, Mary offered to drive Jody back to Sioux Falls. Jody accepted her offer. They were quickly becoming friends, Dean noted. They gathered around Baby and said their goodbyes. When Jody hugged him, she whispered, “Congratulations. Don’t lose him.”
They drove around to their room. When he turned off the car, Dean handed Castiel the keys. While getting out of the car, he opened the pack and lit a cigarette. He closed the door behind him and leaned against it. Castiel was still sitting in the passenger seat, watching him.
He had rebelled enough, with another hour away from Heaven, he would be placed on the critical list. A new batch of angels would be looking for him. If they found him and saw that he was not injured, or being held against his will, not only would they kill Dean, but he would be brought back up to Heaven to face Judgement. His wings would be torn from him, his Grace drained. Then, he’d be pushed from Heaven's gates, and he would fall.
“Alright, let’s get him to the spare room. I’ll get some supplies, try to get his clothes off.”
“I was given an ultimatum.”
Carefully balancing the flowers in one hand as he climbed the ladder leading to the roof, where pulled himself up onto the roof floor. When he stood up, Dean dusted himself off and looked around. When he finally turned, he saw Castiel standing with his back facing him. Dean felt his breath catch in his throat, the light breeze in the air swept at the back of Cas’s trench coat. He quietly walked a few feet to get closer to him.
There he was. After everything, the blue-eyed angel was still standing by his side. Dean couldn’t believe it. How could he? He wasn’t worth any of this, surely not the love and compassion Castiel had shown him.
Dean scooped Castiel up into his arms and made his way into the house calling out for his brother, “Saaaaaam!”
choice to choose you over Heaven. I’d do it again a million times over if I had to. The day I raised you from perdition is the day I fell in love with a human. I knew I wouldn’t last long in Heaven when you were down here…”
When they broke apart for air, they both smiled, Castiel giggled. Dean pressed a chaste kiss to the corner of Castiel’s mouth before he said, “turn around. Let me bandage you up and then we’ll rest.”
Before Sam could even answer, he doubled over with laughter, which earned him a brotherly punch to his shoulder. “Dude, you two are the most unfazed, dumb and blind, and clueless pair I have ever met.”
“Please, Cas…”
“Yeah, Sammy. I’ll be in soon.”
“Dean.”
Castiel had found Dean torn to pieces in Hell. There wasn’t one inch of him that was unmarked by the evilness that had consumed hell and all of it. Hell ran on agony, desperation, sadness, and nightmares that the worst of the worst could not handle. It was no place for Dean Winchester, and certainly no place for Castiel, the angel of the lord, angel of Thursday, all blue eyes and sweet innocence. He was sent down to Hell to put find Dean Winchester, put him back together, and pull him out of Hell. After he accomplished this task, he would go back to Heaven and retrieve his next task. There was only one thing stopping him. The green-eyed boy with sun-kissed freckles like constellations in the night sky dotting his face who stood in front of him.
Dean smiled, running his fingers over the neat script, loving the way Castiel’s letters looped together and realized that apart from the sigils Castiel often made with the blood from his own body, he had never seen Castiel write anything, least of all a note in cursive.
“We should have everything we need right here.”
Looking up, he smiled and whispered, “you son of a bitch,” before folding up the note and stuffing it in his pocket for safekeeping. If Castiel could make an effort, Dean would too.
“Cas…”
“Thanks, Sam. I’ll get it from here. I’ll call you if I need help.” Surprised, Sam stumbled back a step but did not argue with his brother. Instead, he nodded, “O..okay… I’ll just be in the study then.”
“Hey, Cas. I’ve got you, buddy.”
“Okay… what’s your suggestion then Dr. Phil?”
“Hey, Dean… I’m gonna head inside. It’s getting late and I have some research I still need to do.”
“Alright… everything okay?”
With Dean’s support, Castiel turned over, sighing in relief as the pressure was off of his sore back. Dean held in a gasp of pain as he took in the blood that was dripping down Cas’s back. With a tender hand, Dean gently ran his fingers along Cas’s spine, down to his tailbone. “Wanna tell me what happened?” Dean asked as he began to clean the wounds. Castiel hissed at the combination of the coldness and the stinging.
“It’s Cas, he was the one who saved me, brought me back. He’s hurt. He needs help.”
The very thought made Dean’s stomach clench in a painful manner. And before he could feel the bile rise in his throat, Dean grabbed the blue roses and headed into the Bunker. When Dean stepped into the Bunker he stood in the doorway at the top of the stairs, expecting something to be different but it wasn’t. The lights were still on and it still appeared empty and quiet. Dean made his way down the steps, calling out for Cas. When there was no answer, panic began to engulf his stomach and he felt the bile begin to rise in his throat again. “Cas,” Dean called out again, only he paused when he saw a note laying on the Map table.
Dean knew that Sam was being overly clingy, couldn’t blame the kid. Dean couldn’t say what he’d do if the roles were reversed and it was Sam that Dean had lost. With another sigh, Dean looked up in the sky just as he saw a bright light shoot across the sky. The light reminded him of Castiel, those eyes. How bright and blue they glowed for him.
“Yes, it is Sam… I’m freaking out over here because I don’t want to fuck this up… I don’t know how to do this, man.”
“I have no choice, Dean.”
“Dean,” Castiel said cutting Dean off and stepping closer, with only inches between them. “You still don’t think you deserve anything good in your life? It’s always been you, Dean. So…”
“No. Kiss me.”
Sam came running into the room, jaw dropped and confused when he saw Dean with a man cradled in his arms. “De… who is…”
“Just stay a little longer.”
“Oh… he was? When?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just a little bit ago. Look, Dean, I get it… I really do. I get you both are terrified that you going to make a mistake, that you’ll fuck this up and he will leave. But, Cas feels the same way. Actually… he thinks your afraid to be with him and that you're not sure that you want him or not. He’s confused.”
“Yes… no… yes… It’s complicated.”
On those nights he wondered about his angel, Castiel. The more he thought about the blue-eyed angel, his arm where he found a large handprint engraved into his skin. A mark left by his angel that he had come to cherish. Taking a sip of beer and twisting the black feather Castiel had left him between his thumb and index finger in the other hand. There was no contentment in Dean Winchester’s life. Sure, he was grateful to be alive. To be whole again. To be with his little brother. To share these quiet moments together. But when he woke up and stared up into the glowing blue eyes of Castiel, he realized exactly what had been missing in his life.
Dean was scared. Though he tried to hide it. Hide it in the way he rolled his shoulders. Hide it in the way he kept his stance, feet spread apart and bent slightly at the knees just in case he needed to physically defend himself… from what? Castiel? His angel… no… he would never…
Since pulling Castiel out of the Empty, Sam had been spending more and more time away with Eileen. Dean never said much about it because they had stopped the end of the world from happening. Things were better, life was calm and quiet and for the first time in Dean’s life, he felt ok, good even.
“I guess that’s a yes then?”
And so, Dean gently cupped Castiel’s face, fingers behind his ear, thumb on his cheek, and guided him in. Their lips met for the first time, and it was like sparks of fireworks dancing between them. It was everything Castiel imagined it would be and better. For Dean, he felt himself healing the wounds that Castiel couldn’t reach the first time.
“Your everything, Dean. You are something. It wasn’t my choice to save you, nor was it my choice to…. What’s wrong?” Castiel asked, watching Dean’s eyes shift from confused to sad…  “You… don’t think you deserved to be saved?”
“No, it wasn’t my choice to save you. But, the moment I laid eyes on you… how broken you were I knew I had to be the one to make you whole again. I guess my job still isn’t done yet. It was, however,
Hey y'all. I am finished with this story. I don't write a whole lot of Destiel but I had to write this. I hope y'all enjoyed it because I had so much fun writing it. <3
After Dean wrapped gauze around Castiel’s back and chest, holding it in place. Dean lay down, Castiel followed suit, resting his head on Dean’s chest. Their legs tangled together, and their fingers laced together. Every few seconds or so they would lean into each other and kiss. This was Heaven unlike anything else Castiel had experienced, and maybe in Dean, Castiel could heal himself as well.
Castiel was shocked, but a smile spread across his lips. Those six little words ‘
Ending the thought, Dean knocked on the door and took a step back waiting for the door to open. Sure enough, within seconds, the door swung open to reveal Sam standing there. “Dean, what are you doing here?”
After he had pieced Dean Winchester back together. He had left a mark on Dean’s body, claiming the human as his. When Dean’s eyes first opened in a silent
When Sam left, Dean placed his hand back over Castiel’s heart, it wasn’t just beating, it was pounding, and that made Dean’s own heart skip a beat. “Hey, it’s okay. Your safe here. Can you turn over so I can clean your wounds?”
CHAPTER ONE
Castiel was beautiful, battle scars and all. And, as Dean reached up and placed his hand over Castiel’s chest, right over his heart, those blue eyes fluttered open meeting Deans.
“Have you ever…” Dean questioned.
Most nights, Dean found himself outside, laying on the hood of his 1967 Chevy Impala staring up at the night sky. Some nights, like tonight, Sam Winchester, Dean’s little brother, would sit with them. Sam would hand Dean a beer, and they would sit quietly staring at the stars in the sky.
On the drive home, Dean’s mind had been racing. His first thought was that Cas had sought out Sam’s help, concerned that he was too afraid to actually love Cas back. The second thought was that Cas had felt just as lost and confused about taking the steps to an actual relationship with him. And the third thought occurred as he pulled up to the Bunker. Castiel may be in there, somewhere, prepared or not, to take things to the next level. Or perhaps the talk with Sam had done the complete opposite, it may have terrified him even further and decided that he wasn’t worth working for and would tell him that he wanted nothing to do with him.
“Dean…”
One week. Seven days. One hundred sixty-eight hours. Ten thousand and eighty minutes. Six hundred and four thousand – eight hundred seconds. One week. That was how long it had been since Dean Winchester last saw or spoke to Castiel, the angel of Thursday, who found him in hell, put him back together, and brought him back to life on Earth.
At the very moment Dean had stopped, Castiel had turned, a soft smile pulled at the corners of his mouth. “Hello, Dean.”
Hey y'all! So, kinda been busy with my new Wincest fic but I'm still gonna update this as well. Anyways, I really loved all the mush in this chapter, let me know how y'all liked it.
“Yeah. I like your lips too. I like your voice. I like your sense of humor. I like how hard-working and dedicated you are. I like that you never gave up on me, even now.”
On the ground in a dusty heap of dirt, clothing, and beautiful black feathers lay Castiel. Limp, cold, and bleeding. “Cas,” Dean shouted! Dean stumbled from the hood of his beloved car, and quickly made his way to Castiel’s side where he was pulling Cas into his arms. There was no response, his skin was cold, and the blood… there was so much blood coming from his back.
Dean turned on the car as Sam slid into the backseat, and the discussion was shelved. Dean turned on the radio but couldn’t settle on a station. He asked Cas to pick a tape, and Cas picked the tape Dean had made him.
“You may not, but I have faith.”
Well, he wasn’t sure Sam thought of it as
“Holy shit. You keep talking like that and I might come again. You know, I’m not as young as I used to be.”
“Mom, I’ve alive. You’re alive. We all have another chance. A chance to do this right.”
He was replaying Dean’s latest prayer.
And in that moment, Dean had felt such unadulterated rage. Who wore white to a death match? A fallen archangel hellbent on destruction, that’s who. And Dean didn’t have the heart to tell his brother he never wanted to see him wear white, not even on his wedding day. Not that he thought he had any say in the matter.
Castiel looked up and met his gaze.
“Who was driving?”
Castiel grinned.
Pulled from her reverie, she nodded, and opened it.
He passed Dean his mug, the one with the light and sweet coffee.
He hated Sam for his ability to keep cool. His anger burned just as hot, sometimes even hotter, but his anger wouldn’t burn down a forest. He could temper it. He knew how to keep calm and how to feign the courage he didn’t have.
Sam returned to find Dean asleep and Castiel looking out the window.
Dean put his hand on top of Castiel’s until he stilled, and let it rest there. He couldn’t say when this simple comfort had started to become commonplace between them, but it had. They sat in companionable silence for some time. Castiel stood up and gave Dean a hand.
He could feel his heartbeat as if it were his own, thumping in his chest. He could feel the blood rushing through the ventricles. This was a new sensation, of course, like so many of his experiences on earth. This didn’t seem daunting, not the way falling and failing had been.
“I – I don’t remember when I first read it, or where I got this copy, but I’ve read them several times, and I… I think you would enjoy them.”
They spent the day in companionable silence. Castiel read from the book Dean had left on his desk, facedown. They had an understanding. Dean would read a book, and if he thought Castiel would like it or worth discussing, he would leave it facedown, for Castiel. Once he’d finished reading it, they’d discuss it. Sam wasn’t privy to their book discussions, of course.
Dean moved closer and started taking off his jacket and the flannel shirt he was wearing. Mary watched, confused, but didn’t comment. At last, he pulled up the sleeve of his undershirt so she could see the mark there. Once again, he said, “He raised me from perdition.”
“Please,” interrupted Dean.
“I am.”
Dean nodded. There was more he could say, more he should say, but he didn’t want to open that can of worms. Castiel didn’t get the memo and put a hand on his thigh. Dean threw back his head. Angels, his mother always said. The angels were looking out for him, but he knew better than that. He knew it was just the one. Just the one angel with his hand on his thigh, rubbing small circles around his knee. Just the one angel that always managed to leave him open, exposed.
Castiel stiffened next to him.
“I’m sorry. I haven’t been around. I see, now, that I shouldn’t have left you,” he said.
“Correct, you couldn’t because you shouldn’t. And yet, you did. You continue to do whatever it is you want to do. And I need you to understand that is not your purpose.”
He let the tears fall and she wiped them away.
“Please, don’t make me beg,” said Dean. Regretting his word choice upon seeing the teasing smile Cas gave him in return.
“Dean asked me to read it,” said Castiel.
“At least we keep our end of the deals we make,” said Crowley.
Castiel was still reading the book he had started earlier, but Mary didn’t question it. What caught her eye, when she looked over, was the top drawer. Dean must’ve opened it earlier, when he took out the book and placed it on the desktop. He had known Castiel would follow him back to the room.
This time, there was no way he could sleep. At least, not tonight. And even if he did, this nightmare wouldn’t end when he opened his eyes.
He wasn’t going to talk, Castiel knew.
Perhaps, he had spent too much time on earth. He had spent too much time in this body. He had spent too much time with the Winchesters.
“How are you?”
What did the angel want with him anyway?
“I’m not questioning your bond; I’m questioning your ability. Need I remind you that you came to me for help, meaning you don’t think you can do this yourself, and thus, you need my assistance.”
“Yeah,” said Dean. He turned back to finish packing. And after a moment, he spoke.
Dean shook his head. He could feel a headache starting to form. They didn’t need more stories to go around about them.
“I asked her to stay in line, to fight who she really was,” she continued.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I — I didn’t want you to feel this way. I didn’t want it to be like this,” said Mary.
She gave the room a quick look-around and faced Dean.
“Moose, shut it.”
Dean had said it was best to sit across from someone if one were conversing. People relied on eye contact and body language to gauge what wasn’t being said. Claire had said he sat too still and it unnerved people, that it would be best to keep his hands preoccupied while he spoke.
Outside, the sun shifted across the sky until night fell.
He could handle losing mom. After all, he had lost her once before, but he couldn’t handle losing Cas. It was different when he though the angel was cold and unfeeling, but that hadn’t been true in a long time. Cas was his best friend, his confidant.
Dean would tell him about the men he met in alleys and behind closed doors, who only asked for silence. On those nights, he would cry and Castiel would console him.
He turned to face Castiel.
He circled around the King of Hell, who was presently torturing a lesser demon. The demon was writhing in pain and bleeding from deep gashes on his sternum.
“This body, it’s mine,” said Castiel when he slid into the passenger’s seat. They had stopped for gas. Dean was still distracted by his thoughts, but he didn’t need to think to pump gas. He’d been pumping gas since he was a child. It was instinctual, as were so many of the other things he had learned in childhood.
“I’m sorry, Jody. We can pick this back up, but I have to talk to my son,” she said, as she walked away.
He cut himself off. He rested his head on the arm on the steering wheel.
“My name is Naomi,” said the woman sitting behind the desk.
As Mary investigated the room, she took note of Dean’s carefully curated books, sorted by height on the ledge above his bed. Then, she looked over at the desk. There were no take out containers or empty cups. There were no empty plates or beer bottles. Just a few notebooks, stacked neatly one on top of the other. There were a few loose pages sticking out from one of the notebooks, but nothing was awry.
“I know,” said Castiel as he watched Dean rake the leaves.
His voice broke. Crowley, now concerned, stopped pacing entirely, and stared at the angel, waiting for him to finish.
Castiel nodded.
He pulled back. “Angel, take off the coat.”
It hurt so fucking much. And he ached.
Castiel didn’t comment. He had only seen a flash of light before their surroundings took shape. This reminded him of that dream. It seemed Dean enjoyed fishing. This pleased him. He rarely took pleasure in small things like this. Sure, there was the booze and the burgers. And before him, there had been more women. But he rarely allowed himself to enjoy life’s little treasures.
“That was more than a second,” said Castiel, opening the door and moving to the side, giving Dean room to walk through.
Dean started pacing again.
All these emotions washed over him; he could seldom name them. And though Cas had healed his superficial wounds, he had only managed to ease the pain in his chest. He hadn’t been able to heal that wound. It was much too deep.
“Honestly, me either.”
“I will always be able to find Dean. This won’t ever happen again,” he said.
“What? We’re all men,” said Dean. He sounded annoyed, too.
He’d deny it, of course, but Castiel understood now. He understood why Dean had tried to kill this part of himself. It was all he had of his mother, and she was gone, so he needed to bury this, too.
In the car, Dean fiddled with the car’s stereo. He didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t want Jody to ask invasive questions.
“That’s nice. She could come talk to me herself if she cared enough,” said Dean, bitterly. With the bottle in hand, he made his way out of the kitchen. Leaving Castiel and Sam in stunned silence.
He didn’t have it in him to cry, but he wanted to, desperately. Dry, heaving sobs that would leave him clutching Baby’s wheel with no direction. He’d lost him, his baby brother, his Sammy. The one he held, all bundled up, when their home — the only one they’d ever known — went up in flames. Sam, who grew up to be smarter and taller than he was, but just as stubborn. And what good had that done?
“The hell it matters! You’re not going to spend the rest of existence pining after a man that won’t have you because you possessed him! Does he… Does he even know you’re back?”
They were well on their way when he turned on the stereo again. Jody didn’t need to know he had taken the cassette from Castiel’s inner coat pocket. She didn’t need to know he had picked these songs, had arranged them just so.
“He’s in a coma,” he said, at long last.
Sam scoffed. “Dean, you can’t be serious? I live with you. I’ve known for years. And I get it, I get why you keep quiet. Cas is my friend, too,” said Sam.
“I — I’m sorry,” he said.
“He’s going to hate you, Cassie.”
“Yeah, I know, angel. I know. Kiss me,” said Dean, smiling.
“But Michael —“ he said.
“Wish me luck,” she said.
“Dean, please. There’s no need.”
Castiel looked up and searched his face. He noted his eyes were wet, but he wasn’t crying.
Closing his eyes, he hushed his thoughts and felt for something, anything. As he stilled, he could hear it, distantly. There was something softly thrumming in the background. Softer still than his heartbeat. It was faint, but steady.
This, this was unlike that.
Castiel took a deep breath. “You’re right.”
“Whole, and alive. Thank you,” he said, lowering his voice.
Possession implied ownership, but there was nothing here that wasn’t already his.
He needed…
He titled Dean’s chin and Dean leaned into the touch. He held the mug with both hands and brought it to his lips. He took another sip and closed his eyes.
“By the time the paramedics arrived, he had lost too much blood. I watched them put him on a stretcher. I had never been this powerless before,” he said.
“Heaven wants me to go back,” said Castiel.
“That’s alright,” said Dean. “It’s better this way, trust me.”
They were standing in a park, several yards from the entrance of the hospital. Night had fallen. The sidewalk was illuminated by a dim streetlight. Castiel sat on the bench a few feet away. Crowley sat next to him but kept his distance.
That very monster had shattered the driver’s side window. The window was a pain in the ass to replace, so he opted to do that first, but then reconsidered. He had to get his priorities in order. She hadn’t wanted to start, so he decided to pop the hood, and check her out. Even if the engine needed replacing, he had done it a hundred times before. Wasn’t anything he couldn’t do with his eyes closed.
Mary stood, her hands in her pockets, and didn’t say anything.
Jody nodded. “Alright then, let’s get back on the road.”
Mary was excited. She hadn’t seen this woman in 40 years but had called her, nonetheless. The woman — she wouldn’t say her name — was glad to hear from Mary and was willing to meet. Mary had put the phone back in her pocket, excitedly. She’d walked back into the kitchen, looking for Dean.
“How long have you and Castiel been together?”
After their sparring matches (or their fights), when Sam left (and he was always the one to leave), Dean would be left behind, all bloodied and bruised. But he’d clean up their mess, pay for damages, and bandage his own wounds.
“What the hell happened?”
“This is Castiel,” said Mary.
He just didn’t want to be alone.
It was a new day.
. And the pain in his chest was gone. Castiel had eased too.
“Dean, we should move,” said Castiel once the sun set.
He moved away before Jody could reach for him. And he didn’t get a good look at Patience’s face, but there was disbelief. Probably didn’t think he could love a man. Dean, certainly, hadn’t thought he could.
Patience eyed her quizzically.
Patience nodded.
but Castiel wasn’t too keen on the nickname, not that it mattered. The pack leader was dead, and the others reverted. If they ever encountered something like that again, he wouldn’t hesitate, and he wouldn’t make the same mistake.
Sam made quick friends with the twins: Max and Alicia Banes. They were witches and hunters, they explained. Their mother taught them everything they knew. She was a witch who hunted those who abused of their magic and raised her kids in the life. If only all the witches they encountered were like the Banes.
“Are you two…together?”
Dean laughed. “Yeah, emotions are fickle mistresses,” he said confidently.
“Dude,” said Sam, clearly annoyed.
Sam was still wearing his running shoes, but it was clear he hadn’t left.
“How do you manage?”
He opened the drawer and reached in. He picked the first picture and handed it to Mary. Their fingers brushed.
Castiel would, of course. By morning, he’d finish so they’d discuss it over breakfast or on the road. Sam would chime in if he knew what they were discussing, but Dean would just listen. He would listen to every word Castiel said.
When he spoke, Castiel’s voice was even, but there was a hint of sadness there. Dean could hear it. And as he thought on it, Castiel had lost a brother, too. Two, if you counted Lucifer. And though he had fallen, he was still an angel.
Dean knelt on the ground, bracing himself against the Impala.
“I —”
“Okay, man. Whatever you say,” said Sam, taking back the box and placing it on the empty seat next to him in the back.
“Cas, I — I didn’t mean to call,” he said.
She had hoped he would share her excitement.
He read and reread
“You’re not in my contacts,” said Castiel, matter of fact.
“I know. And I know you mean it, until something comes up. Until there’s another world-ending crisis and you decide to play my knight in shining armor. We’ve been through this.”
“You bonded?”
Whatever he was now, he was
“Who are you,” he asked.
“At the beginning. We’re right back where we started: I saved you and you freed me.”
Even when John had been around, Dean had cleaned up their messes. He’d been cleaning after John for decades, so why would Sam be any different? After all, it was Sam who took after their father. It was Sam who was most like John. Their single-minded determination carried them through life. And John had molded Dean into the perfect soldier, but not the perfect son. The perfect son wouldn’t have needed molding.
Dean had showered and was wearing a towel and little else. Dean had wrapped the towel around his hips. His hair was still wet and there were droplets on his shoulder. If Sam were up and moving about the same space, Dean would have dressed in the bathroom before coming out. But tonight, he hadn’t bothered.
Dean only knew that which he could observe, what he could see, or hear, or touch, or taste. And he knew, Michael had snapped Castiel. He had watched it happened and had smelled the blood in the air. And the second Michael had snapped his fingers, Castiel had ceased to be.
“Were you always into men?”
"Dean, why aren't there pictures of you and Sam when you were little?"
Dean nodded. “I really don’t. Driver chooses, but I’m making an exception.”
So much had happened since.
Sometime later, as Dean was finishing, Mary came by, with a backpack slung over her shoulder. She stood in the doorway.
I’ll be here. I love you; I trust you.
Castiel stared. Seconds before he had been sitting beside Dean in a hospital room. They had been holding hands. It was… a pleasant thought.
He wouldn’t break down in front of a teenager. He wouldn’t break down in front of Jody. He trusted Jody, but he didn’t want sympathy. He knew she understood.
There was a sincerity in her voice she couldn’t mask.
“Let me do that.”
“Cas…”
“Of course,” he said.
“I know.” He paused. “I thought it best to check on you.”
Jody kept her eyes on him, but Dean averted his gaze.
He had thrown an arm over his eyes. Castiel chuckled.
He took a deep breath. He wouldn’t cry. Not in front of her, not outside this house.
“Doing what, Dean? Reaching out to a friend? I’m allowed to have friends,” said Mary.
“Mom’s asking about you," said Sam, moving into the room and reaching for a beer next to his brother.
If only it were that easy.
“Can’t or won’t?”
He took a deep breath and said, “I’ve lost the love of my life. And there’s no getting him back. So, if you get a chance at normal, take it.”
Then, Cas offered his hand, and Dean took it. There was that electricity again. This time there was no cooling sensation, just warmth. It was almost ticklish. He rose to his feet and felt whole again.
He could hear his breathing, slow and steady. He could feel his breath. Inhale, exhale. It had been a long time since they were this close. And he took great comfort in their closeness. They had been this close once before; before the Fall. The night before it was all to end. It didn’t end, of course, but there was no way they could’ve known. And he wouldn’t trade that night for the world.
He had finished the coffee Castiel had brought him, but he was still holding the mug, keeping it close. Castiel stood in the doorway watching the Winchesters. He needed to talk to Dean, but he was trying to give him time. Time to speak to Mary, time to pull Sam aside, time to process last night’s conversation and this morning’s discovery.
“Luck,” said Castiel.
Soon, Dean found himself in Castiel’s lap. Relishing in the opportunity to do as he wished, Castiel ran his hands up and along Dean’s spine. He was tense. Kneading the muscle, Dean relaxed and melted into his touch. And when he started moaning, Castiel knew he would never tire of hearing Dean make those sounds.
She looked at Dean — the one in the picture. Her little boy. The one who hugged her whenever she was upset, the one who always reminded her she was loved. Her eyes started to water. And she started to speak but couldn’t bring herself to say anything.
“Yeah, but he’s not as strong as he once was, and he can’t fly. He hates — hated — that,” said Dean.
. He had been doing that for nearly a decade, and he could keep doing it for many more.
And seeing as how he was doing such piss-poor job of not thinking about it, he closed his eyes again. Stilling all thought. He felt that pulse again. It was warmer. And he latched onto the feeling and welcomed it.
“No, but I could be yours,” said Castiel.
Maybe he should tell Mary to leave, to come back in a bit. Give Dean some time before taking off, but she spoke before he could say anything.
He moved toward the tree and leaned against the trunk.
Dean was leaning against the door. He said, "Mom, after you died, I didn't talk for months. Not a single word. On a hunt, I met a boy like that. His father had died, and he couldn’t process it. He didn’t have the words, but he could draw. So, I had him draw for me.”
Jody turned back to look at Dean who was leaning against the Impala, his arms crossed over his chest. He had his eyes closed and his breaths were measured. She didn’t need to see his face to know he was crying.
“I — I couldn’t — I couldn’t bear,” he said before she cut him off.
This was like coming home.
He shook his head. “Doesn’t matter, it’s all the same with you: duty-bound. Dean said he wanted the quiet life. You chose to respect his wish. Thus, paying a visit to ask for help fighting the Civil War raging would put a dent in your relationship. You’d be disrespecting his wishes and those of his brother. And I know you’re not going to do that,” said Crowley.
Dean shook his head. “No, maybe — hell, I don’t know. I had one girlfriend in high school and two more after I got my GED. Dad and I were always on hunts, so I didn’t have time to socialize. And I didn’t go away to college like Sammy.”
He wiped his hands on his trousers. They were sweaty, and he didn’t sweat. The unease that had been growing was reaching a breaking point.
Mary watched Castiel, transfixed. She was unable to say anything.
Castiel was reading the book he had been reading earlier, and Dean slept peacefully next to him. Castiel would make sure he didn’t have any nightmares.
Dean wiped his eyes one last time.
She had wanted to be the one to mold them, not the one playing catch-up.
That was the source of all his problems, he knew. If he had just been an obedient angel, all of this could’ve been avoided. If he had just toed the line, they wouldn’t be in this conundrum.
They drove some more, until Dean needed to stop for gas again.
Jody turned back to look at Patience.
“Yes, of course. Sam doesn’t like the idea any more than you do, but…”
Dean shook his head. “You say, ‘of course,’ as if you don’t leave when I least expect. And I never know, if or when, you’re coming back. And I just…”
With the mugs of coffee in hand, he made his way back to their room. Dean was sitting up, leaning against the headboard.
Castiel nodded.
Castiel was different, and things with him were different. Though the angel came and went as he pleased, he would always answer Dean’s call. And that had never been true with John. Besides, Cas wasn’t disappointed in him — not if the fond smile was anything to go by.
Great.
After a few minutes had passed, Mary asked, “How long?”
He sighed.
“Yes, and you push me away,” said Castiel, rising to his feet.
As if answering his call, Castiel appeared.
Castiel was many things, and in this time, he was lost; adrift. He should’ve sought Dean’s guidance. The hunter came to him for answers, but the angel learned a thing or two from him as well. He kept his distance and honored Sam’s wish for him. It never got any easier.
Dean knew these entries by heart, so what would reading them once more accomplish? Castiel voiced his frustrations more than once but was met with resistance. Even though Sam had stopped reading them, Dean would insist. And so late at night, he would read in the car while Sam slept.
“Might as well have had a neon sign saying, ‘kill me.’ I befriended a vampire. We spent months killing monsters and searching for Cas. And when we found him, he looked like hell,” said Dean.
In the hallway, Jody and his mom were talking. She had introduced herself. Telling Mary how she had met the Winchesters, how she had started hunting, and fostered Alex and Claire. Mary nodded along, but her attention shifted when she saw Dean walking toward them.
This was different. This was very different.
Dean didn’t meet her gaze. He couldn’t. Instead, he was looking at his hands in his lap, but turned to meet Patience’s waiting eyes.
“Castiel, I’ll be asking the questions,” she said, ignoring his question and pointed look.
She smiled softly, but her tired eyes betrayed her.
Patience was left without a grandmother. And so, the cycle continued. John had dragged his sons into his war, and Dean had been a soldier a long, long time. He had been daddy’s blunt instrument. He had been Alastair’s star pupil in Hell. He was tired. Tired of losing, tired of forfeiting his dreams, of giving up his soul, of languishing in the dirt.
Dean watched him nervously. He couldn’t help but think of the Castiel he had met in 2014 whose vices outnumbered Dean’s own. Castiel took a drag, and Dean watched, mesmerized. One drag, then another. An angel of the Lord smoking a cigarette in front of a motel, surely that was one for the books.
And there was no accountability in Heaven.
Castiel looked apologetic but didn’t apologize.
Jody reached into her pocket and pulled out a business card. Handing it to Patience, she said, “If you ever need someone to talk to or some place to go, my door’s always open.”
And with Sammy gone, it might as well have been the end. And oh, he ached for the part of him now in hell.
He wiped the tears but kept his eyes closed. He couldn’t stop seeing Charlie’s blood on his hands, the very hands that went on to build her funeral pyre. She was better off without them. Knowing them had only brought about her demise.
He turned away and wiped the tears again.
She was waiting for him to say something, but he was having trouble speaking.
Castiel laughed, softly.
Dean threw his head back in ecstasy. His eyes were closed and his dark lashes fell on his flushed cheeks. Dean came with Cas’ lips wrapped around his cock as he stroked him to completion.
How could the father who let his son bleed in the backseat be the father who took his son to baseball games? How could the father who disappeared for weeks at a time be the father who never missed a birthday? How could the father who never answered a phone call be the one who kept in touch?
Besides, she didn’t know how to comfort her friend.
Besides, at the time, it had felt good.
Besides, it was easy to talk to them and they seemed to have a strong bond, not unlike the one he had with Sam.
Didn’t matter how many years had passed, he would always think back on that day. The silence that stretched between them. Who was he to challenge destiny? He had wondered what it would take to become that version of himself he met in the future, but now he had a better idea.
“Making out on the armchair was nice and all, but I have a memory foam mattress I’d rather ride you on.”
And though Castiel had always been larger than life, the archangels had been
Dean looked over and met Castiel’s gaze then quickly turned away. It felt like a betrayal to see Castiel sitting next to his mother. How was he supposed to win this argument with no back-up?
Dean quickly schooled his expression. He didn’t want to get into it tonight. He didn’t want to explain why he had been crying while leaning against the driver’s side door. He hadn’t finishing putting Baby back together and he couldn’t leave her like this. He needed her to be ready to rumble.
For Dean, Castiel was in a different echelon. He was an angel who had fallen from Heaven, and he had done so to stop Heaven from seeing its plan come to fruition. Cas had made his intentions clear long ago when they had tried to prevent Lucifer’s rising.
They were still parked on the side of the road. And though spending a few hours listening to Dean’s quiet sobs on the side of the road was no time at all to a being of light who was millions of years old, Castiel knew Dean wouldn’t be able to drive for much longer. And they would need to find a place to settle in for the night.
“I know, but… Do we have to rush? We’re always in a rush.”
Mary gasped but didn’t say anything more, and so Castiel pushed through.
Mary looked taken aback by that answer.
“You don’t think I tried that? You don’t — you don’t seriously think I would just leave him in that state?”
“You’re an Angel. Why don’t you just go in there and heal him?”
Castiel’s first words to him echoed his fears. He didn’t think he deserved it, and he hadn’t. Castiel had been acting on orders, and his orders were just a small part of Heaven’s grand plan. He and Sam were caught in the middle. Pawns in a game of chess they couldn’t understand from inside the chessboard.
“We can’t stay here,” said Castiel. “We have to get back.”
“Done,” he said.
He was so full of love. Did Mary know that?
You make me believe. And I know, you’ll disagree. You think you’re undeserving. You don’t think you can have this, but I’m telling you, you’re wrong.
“Dad says we should just get back to normal,” said Patience. She nodded and then added, “Maybe he’s right.”
“I haven’t been the same. Not since coming back. I’m not as strong, and I don’t know why. I was sitting there, blood dripping from my temples, watching the blood drip down his. I called emergency services, gave them our location, and told the operator what had happened. She assured me help would come.
Dean nodded and turned to face Castiel, who was saying goodbye to his mom.
“She died, too. I just — I just keep losing people. And it never gets easier. And it never hurts any less.”
When Dean looked up, he saw that all eyes were on the figure walking through the door.
“I don’t know if he loves — loved — me, or just, humanity in general,” said Dean.
Dean visibly relaxed and took a sip of his coffee. It was still too hot to drink quickly.
“Because I’m too young to be this old,” said Dean.
They both walked out of the car at the same time. While Dean pumped gas, Cas asked the clerk for a pack of menthols and beef jerky. Dean ate the jerky greedily but not before offering Cas a piece.
“Of course.”
“Did she ask you not to call?”
Patience was young; she was restless. She was too young to understand the sheer exhaustion Dean felt. And he didn’t want her to ever feel this way. He wanted her to stay far, far away.
Not even Hell had been this exhaustive.
“I may be out of line here,” she said, “but you don’t have to listen to him, if it’s not what you really want.”
The next morning, Castiel left the room early while Dean was still asleep. Sam would be on his run and Castiel would prepare coffee the way he knew Dean preferred — not the way he’d order his coffee, but the way Castiel would prepare his, from which Dean would sip until they switched cups.
Castiel reached for his hand before he could grab another bottle by the neck. Dean stilled at the contact.
His breathing was labored, but Jody just waited. He would speak again when he could, she would just have to wait.
“Crowley, it’s Dean,” said Castiel.
Dean laughed, relieved. Castiel couldn’t help but feel as if he had passed a test.
No one would disturb him. And so, he’d close his eyes and let the grief swallow him whole. He’d lost his mom and he’d lost his dad and he’d lost his brother. And all he had to show for himself and all he had left of this life was Baby. Sturdy and unyielding.
“I want this,” said Castiel.
He smiled softly at the angel by his side.
“Hello, Dean,” said Castiel when he heard his breathing change.
“Hi, Cas,” said Dean.
Dean slept next to him thoroughly spent.
“I — If I possess him, I can save him,” said Castiel.
They were in a motel. Sam had already showered and fallen asleep. His breathing was deep and slow. Castiel knew he would sleep soundly. Sam wasn’t plagued with nightmares, not the way Dean was.
“What makes you think I’ll let you leave,” asked Naomi.
It was dark and Mary was sitting in the library. Only the light from the table lamp illuminated the words in John’s journal. She flipped through the pages slowly. At this late hour, the words weren’t registering. She put her head in her hands and took a deep breath.
After Jody finished packing, and her bags were in the trunk, Sam offered her the passenger’s seat. She took it graciously. Sam didn’t want her sitting in the backseat, lost in her thoughts. They had all lost people, but this was sudden; unexpected. And she couldn’t shake it off. Sam knew sitting in the backseat would make it far too easy for Jody to get lost in her thoughts, and he wasn’t going to let that happen. Not if he could help it.
Dean took a deep breath and lost himself to the grief as the angel held his hand and tried his best to soothe and calm him. Dean let the grace wash over him as he let the tears fall. Castiel had seen him at his worst, so there was no need to hide this from him. And besides, Dean was much too aggrieved to care.
Castiel backed down. He would get the story out of him sooner or later, but he wasn’t going to try his luck tonight. He was still holding the keys and started walking towards the door. He stopped before it, not hearing Dean’s footsteps behind him.
He reached for Dean’s hand. Sam would be back soon. He was giving them time, that much was clear, but they didn’t have very long. And he needed to say this before he ran out of time.
“Thought he showered last night,” said Sam. He placed Dean and Castiel’s coffees on the table, along with the box of donuts, next to the book Castiel had been reading.
“Fuck, where’d you learn to do that? Never mind, don’t tell me,” said Dean.
He wiped the tears away. Don't make me say these things, went unspoken but not unheard.
Saving the world required sacrifice and he had sacrificed enough. He had sacrificed his youth, his soul, his peace of mind, his chance at happiness. He had tortured people in hell. He had seen the people he loves die time and time again.
“I was just… I was just trying to get a feel for hunting again,” she said, pulling away. Dean looked at the gravel.
“She took it well. I’ve come to understand that parents aren’t always the most forgiving, especially when their children turn out to be markedly different,” said Castiel.
“Yeah, yeah. That’s what I thought,” he said, reaching for another beer.
“I know you hate food, just — just try it,” said Dean proffering a bite. Cas leaned over and took the bite. He made a disgusted face while chewing and Dean laughed.
It started simply.
“John wasn’t concerned with Dean’s happiness and so Dean learned he shouldn’t be concerned with his.”
He knew Sam wouldn’t let anything happen to Mary. And he knew they could both handle themselves. If he wanted, he could join them, but he wouldn’t.
Castiel did as he was told, hanging it behind the door. When he turned, Dean was sitting at the foot of the bed, unlacing his boots. Castiel dropped to his knees before him.
Sensing the moment was passing, Castiel moved away. Then, Dean cleared his throat. He looked around the room. Mary was now sitting in the seat Castiel had occupied.
This was easier than he thought. Maybe, it could be easy.
Sam hadn’t returned from his morning run when Dean awoke.
Maybe the ground wasn’t his friend, but it was here, it was steady, and it was real. There were so few steady, real things in his life. He wasn’t going to toss them aside.
“Just pick something,” he said, not unkindly.
The words cut through. Crowley stood in place, transfixed, and turned to stare at him.
It comforted him, though he tried not to think of all the missing people; those they had lost along the way.
. In much the same way water would fill the container in which it had been poured, angels could occupy any vessel that would welcome them. Of course, not all vessels would survive possession, but the angel would be unharmed.
Dean raised his hands and Castiel tossed the keys. Dean caught them.
What else could she say?
Dean hated to pack in a rush. He wouldn’t want to forget anything, and they would be leaving this town come morning, so there would be no time. Better to do it now. And so, Castiel watched him work. Noticing the way his fingers rolled the shirts and jeans he was tucking away. Sometimes, Dean would find a book at the bottom of the duffle and flip through it until he found a passage he liked.
"Castiel saved me. He saved me from hell, he saved me from myself. I don't think there's anything I could ever do that could even come close to matching what Cas did for me that day.”
He took a seat at Dean’s desk and watched Dean work. Dean looked up and met his gaze. Blue eyes met wet green eyes. Dean wanted to speak, he wanted to tell Castiel what was on his mind, but he couldn’t. The words wouldn’t come.
“Hello, Dean,” said Castiel.
“More for me then,” he said.
Jody, sensing his thoughts, turned, and offered him a quiet smile. She was grateful for their company.
Castiel closed the journal.
“I sold my soul to save his life because that’s what dad asked me to do, that was his fucking dying wish. And then, I went to hell and I spent 4 months and 40 years being tortured into torturing souls."
Castiel shook his head.
Once upon a time, he had said he didn’t deserve to go to hell. Well, that wasn’t true anymore. There was nothing noble about killing, not monsters, not humans. It was just a lie he told himself and Sammy. It was just a lie to keep on moving.
Adam, who had paid the ultimate price for Dean’s recalcitrance.
Dean pulled him into a hug and Castiel wrapped his arms around the hunter.
Suddenly, he was overcome with emotion and wept. Here he was, a fallen Angel who had rejected his true purpose and chose to serve a different master.
“There’s no need to be afraid. He’s not here, and he’ll never be here,” said Castiel.
Most of all, he hated what he’d done to Sam. He’d beat him bloody with Sam’s fists. And with Sam’s voice, he had mocked and taunted him.
“Lucifer stabbed him in the back. And I watched him die. Again,” said Dean.
“Crowley,” said Castiel.
It hadn’t mattered that he died for Sam, that he had spent forty years in Hell so Sam wouldn’t have to suffer. It hadn’t mattered that he had spent his life protecting Sammy.
“Cas, are you God?”
It had been a gift and you didn’t return those.
“Mary found some sigils and needed help. She’s not familiar with Enochian since there were no angels on earth during her time as a hunter. I offered my assistance, as I’ve offered it to you many a time,” said Castiel.
And yet, he had to admit, she had been good for Dean. She had provided him with a home, a place where he would be loved.
“Why did you save him?”
Dean didn’t mince his words. He read smoothly, and Castiel let the words fill the space between them. Castiel knew Dean had been reading to Sam since they were young. And to this day, he read for fun. And when he read aloud, he was reading for Castiel’s pleasure. And oh, how he loved hearing him, loved seeing him with a book in his hands. He held it tenderly as if it held secrets. And maybe, it did.
Jody started rummaging through the tapes until she found a few she liked. She chuckled softly. “I’m surprised, not even the angel?”
But in that moment, he heard what he needed to hear. There was someone willing to pull him out of his nightmares. It was the only thing he had wanted, and he had been wanting it for as long as he could remember.
He didn’t ask.
What is and what should never be.
Castiel thought it was God who brought him back, for no one else would have the power. Not even the archangels, not that any of them would bring him back. For his part, Castiel was grateful. He was grateful to be back. Dean thought he could hear the
His voice broke on the last syllable.
“You’re here.”
Sam moved to excuse himself and Dean stopped him at the door.
“That is a difficult question to answer,” said Castiel.
“Oh,” said Jody.
“Oh, is that so?”
Castiel wasn’t surprised to see him cleaning. Dean did this often: whenever he was feeling unsure, whenever he was weighing his options. It brought him personal satisfaction, it killed time. It made him feel useful.
at the end of that statement, but he wouldn’t say anything to the effect.
She turned to face him, once again surprised.
They did not extrapolate.
He would never know because he could never ask.
She would see for herself; the world was different.
He turned away.
Castiel put his hand on Dean’s knee, squeezing softly.
And there it was again, that emotion. This time he recognized it: shame. Castiel shook his head in disgust and returned the cigarette.
“Everything we do leads to catastrophe,” said Crowley, deadpan.
“Mind control?”
He would drive Baby down some county road, same as always. He’d drive and drive until he couldn’t anymore. And then, he’d pull over to lie in the backseat. The clouds above would be indistinguishable from the night sky. And only then could Dean give in, give into the sadness, and the grief pouring out of him, a beacon.
“I’m sorry,” said Dean. “I push you away, especially when I’m desperate and want you near.”
She put her hands back in her pockets. “I took your father’s journal. I’ve been chasing some loose ends. I prayed to Castiel for assistance and he showed. I asked him to keep it between us, just until I was ready to face you and your brother,” she said.
“No, I don’t think so,” he said standing up.
“I am aware of the passage of time, yes,” said Castiel.
Castiel kept his hands in his lap and took a deep breath. He didn’t need to breathe, but he found that it helped. Then, with two fingers, he touched Dean’s forehead.
Cas spread Dean’s legs, exposing his pussy, already wet with arousal. The angel dropped to his knees, his desire to taste him was overwhelming. Dean was already soaking wet as Cas ran his tongue up, starting at the entrance, ending with a flick to his swollen clit.
Dean continued, “With you.”
Dean got up and grabbed some clothes and his dead man’s robe and headed to the kitchen. Sam followed him halfway before turning towards the bathroom.
“I’m not staring,” muttered Sam.
Dean looked over and smirked as he noticed the bulge in Sam’s pants. Sam’s face turned red as he tried to hide it.
With one hand he rubbed the cold lube all over his cock, and with the other he began to massage the outside of Dean’s ass. Slowly he pushed one finger in. Dean was slowly moving up and down on his finger and Cas’ dick. Sam put another finger in, scissoring them to open him up, and finally a third. When Dean was ready he pulled out and placed his cock at the entrance.
“She said to just deal with it. We can just hang out around the bunker until then. No hunting, I guess.”
Sam was close as well and he tightened his grip on Dean’s waist. Taking over he guided him up and down, each time he brought him down he grinded Dean against him, before lifting him back up again. Bringing him up his whole length to the tip before slamming him back down. Faster and harder than before. He let out a moan as well as he began to come. Dean let go of the chair and put his hands over Sammy’s, gripping tightly.
“Oh, hey Dean.”
“I’m not sure. I think so though. It will be different though, not just because I’ll be me again. I don’t know, I guess I’m nervous about it.”
Looking in the mirror he liked how he looked. The hunter wondered if they had a sister is this what she would look like? He could recognize the real him even still. He had the same green eyes, the same freckles spread across his nose and cheeks. His eyebrows raised the same way in curiosity. His smile was still his smile.
Sam came into the room, causing Dean to straighten up. He stopped, tablet in hand, looking at Dean on the bed and Cas standing besides him. He smiled quickly before letting his face drop.
The three stayed in bed for another moment. Savoring the moment in each other’s arms. Dean wanted this to last forever. He looked at his brother then at the angel. He was happy, truly happy.
The angel undid his pants and took out his thick cock, slicking his hand with his tongue, he rubbed his cock a few times, making sure it was nice and wet, before entering Dean’s warmth. Cas let out a breathy, soft moan as he slowly pushed in, inch by inch. Dean’s head rolled back, his eyes closing as his pussy was stretched.
“Now what?” Sam asked Rowena.
Not far away Dean sat on his own bed, sitting upright yet relaxed against the headboard. His pants were thrown on the floor next to the bed along with his boots.
As they walked, Dean took notice of the downright ancient medical equipment, and most of it seemed scarce. It wasn’t long until they reached where they kept Adam, and Dean stepped into the freezing room alone. He pulled back the sheet, seeing his too young baby brother’s grey form, looking too innocent, like he was simply sleeping if it wasn’t for the small array of scratches that decorated his face. Dean swallowed the lump in his throat and turned away from Adam’s body as he wiped at his face with his hand. One of their last chats, months ago, replayed in Dean’s mind. Adam had been telling him about helping this pack, his mate Castiel’s pack… his little brother had been trying to raise funds for their medical needs, was excited to share his knowledge with the doctors and nurses that welcomed him, and talked about how they tended to share, borrow and had to circulate certain equipment with other border sharing packs to the Styne’s… Dean could remember how animated and happy Adam had been about the progress, about the difference he was making… Dean was angry with himself now as he remembered that he had only been half interested in what Adam had gone on about because he had issues with a rival pack at the time that had been occupying his mind. The guilt was eating at him. The guilt that he had turned down every invite to come see him, until now, under the most heartbreaking circumstances...
Castiel looked down at his arm, inches from his wrist, the same arm that had been broken when he met Dean just over a year ago, and he knew his feelings for the Alpha had grown over that time… but he was confused nonetheless. He placed his hand where Dean had touched him, momentarily forgetting that Charlie was still quite literally next to him until she spoke.
Castiel had wondered how the spell had been broken. He nuzzled against Dean’s arm, once again deeply thankful to his love for never giving up on finding him. Dean hummed and kissed the top of his head.
Dean Winchester took pride in being able to provide a safe and well-to-do environment to his massive pack, which was basically the whole town in a quiet, quaint part of Ohio.
“What are you saying?” Dean asked, and panic started to hit him while oddly, his wolf seemed completely unaffected, and Dean’s eyes widened ever so slightly… His wolf, his Alpha was tranquil and placid… Nature. Bela was talking about this, while he believed in him and Bela, claiming Castiel made his wolf feel balanced… Dean looked up at Bela with his realization clear on his face.
Michael silently motioned for Castiel to follow him in the opposite direction. Castiel felt nauseous, and sweat was pouring down his brow as he tried to focus on following his brother. His vision blurred, and he felt his balance waver every few minutes. His insides throbbed, and pain started to course through every part of him. He doubled over as he wailed in agony.
he had to simply see the Alpha, why his wolf stirred and whined in desperation to just be touched or hugged by the very much unavailable Alpha… his findings had informed him that he had made a scent bond.
Castiel frowned. His collar from Adam had been a simple and honestly cheap olive green collar that had held no markings, but it had still meant the world to him. Castiel had no idea the Winchesters had some sort of fancy family crest collars…
“I um, I have to go to work.” Castiel whispered as the clock on the wall told him his shift started soon.
“Oh… well, when Adam would video chat with Dean in the past, I would speak to him as well. Adam had told him about my love and hope to be a—”
Bela smirked. “Dean, I wish you and Castiel luck. I think you make a beautiful family with Lily.”
Dean caressed the pearl. Castiel had cherished it,  had placed it on a small mantle he had made in their nest. The Alpha clenched his jaws as he remembered finding it. He and Castiel had spent their first mating season together and hadn’t left their nest in many moons. Both had been wrapped around the other tightly, and Castiel was luminous in the throes of his heat. The Omega had been demanding and sensual. He had been beyond any dream Dean had ever had, and excelled beyond any of his fantasies. They had mated repeatedly, and Castiel had been quite receptive to Dean using his tentacles on him in the most sinful ways. They had both been completely insatiable in their mating frenzy.
“Dean…” Castiel mumbled. He was a grumpy Omega when sleepy.
Both were so wrapped up in their passionate kiss that neither saw Charlie peeking out from her bedroom, sporting a massive grin, before she quickly went back into her room to not disturb them.
“I know it’s over and that you’ll be better off without that Alpha. He’ll probably demand money now so you better get a good lawyer, can’t have that Alpha ego get all your hard earned money.” Meg stated and it was clear she hadn’t heard his actual words.
“You are all I need. I’m pretty sure that's been obvious for quite some time now. You’re kinda stuck with me.” Meg would never admit any of it out loud, but having Jo’s love, her support and her acceptance from the moment they had met had sealed her fate.
An Alpha red ring started around Dean’s green iris. He could feel his wolf scratching at the surface to come forth and decimate them, make them suffer. How dare they feel so little for a child on the brink of life, its mama was clearly more than capable of caring for it. Adam had spoken highly of Castiel, of his intelligence and sweet nature. Hell, Dean himself had long and interesting conversations with Castiel; he remembered one in particular, in which Dean had been tasked by Bela to choose the flowers for their future wedding and surprisingly, Castiel had been quite knowledgeable… Adam had told him Castiel had hoped to one day a botanist… The Omega wasn’t some helpless and meaningless being just because he was without an Alpha… without Adam.
“That leaves our fearless leader,” Pam teased with a knowing smirk. “I don’t know what you already know about Dean, but he is a good man.”
Dean and Castiel were in the shallow waves of the beach. With the light diminishing, one could just make out Dean’s tentacles rolling about in the water while Castiel held on to him, his beautiful blue tail shimmering just below the water’s surface.
“Kevin said you needed me?” Balthazar asked, looking a bit confused as Jody closed the door behind them.
“What the fuck is that thing?!” Castiel and Michael spun around to find several of their MoL members holed up together by the side of the forest’s tree line. Many had injuries, and most of them were terrified. Castiel’s eyes widened as he realized these were mainly the researchers and medical staff, while the warriors and hunters were inside the bunker fighting.
She looked at him with utter sadness and Dean didn’t understand it. “You honestly think you claiming another Omega won’t change things? You already smell different—”
“Hey, are you sure you’re up for this,” Meg asked as they made their way towards the northern cliff.
He frowned and placed his hand over his stomach as the chilling sensation coursed through him.
“You um, you wanna explain all that?” Jody asked calmly.
“Cas, I love you.” Dean finally voiced as he clenched his jaw and swallowed, showing just how much these powerful words left him with a bared soul. Castiel could do nothing but smile through joy filled tears and immediately surged forward to kiss him deeply in response.
It was eerie, and the frantic bouts of wind swirling in every direction only served to obscure his vision as leaves, road dust, and pollen swirled around him. Dean marched on, and as he turned toward the curve of the road, he heard it. He stopped dead in his tracks, and tried to listen over his racing heart that thundered against his rib cage.
“What are you guys doing here,” he questioned, as he noticed their worried gazes.
humans. They were getting everyone out of the bunker, or attempting to.
“I’m so sorry, Alpha.I’m so sorry,” Castiel cried quietly, as his tears spilled down his cheeks. Dean cooed at him, making soft keening sounds. It wasn’t his fault. None of it was. “I couldn’t protect them-” The Omega’s voice broke as he took in a breath, and the Cecaelia’s tentacles squeezed in comfort. “We had two eggs…” the merman cried against his Alpha.
Even after all this time, seeing Dean so openly affectionate and loving with Lily, as if she was truly his own, made everything in Castiel bloom with love for the Alpha… Dean Winchester was such a good man. Loyal, humble, protective and loving. He was so full of love...
“Hello Sam” Castiel smiled and was relieved to have someone else here as he looked into the waiting room and saw Claire, Emma and Jo having some kind of heated conversation. He had no desire to go towards them.
“Bela! No one needs your barbaric and outdated views of Omegas.”
“Mmhmm.” The Omega murmured as he cuddled against Dean’s chest and was asleep in seconds.
“I love it, thank you.” Castiel beamed and turned back to the room as Pamela and Charlie shot Dean amused looks as they inspected the room.
Castiel made sure to focus on his weekends with Ellie and build back their relationship. Having her with him, sharing things and learning things together made him feel right in his heart. He couldn’t believe he had made such a horrific mistake in thinking he had time to catch up. She was growing so quickly, was ridiculously smart and dramatic in her ways that had him smiling and laughing more often than not at her antics. If he was meant to be without her father… he wouldn’t lose her too, he couldn’t.
She stopped short when she looked over at the old beige sofa. She had barely spent time in the living room since that fateful day, almost 4 years ago now, when Dean, her then Alpha and husband of 35 years, told her he wanted a divorce...that there was someone else…
“Yes Alpha.” Dean looked him over, the soft tone of his voice made him smile, his wolf pleased. As he moved to help Castiel out of the vehicle, his skin hummed, and Dean stopped for a moment to take in the meaning of the slight jolt. His wolf was being ridiculously content and he chalked it up to the physical contact with his
“No, he made Benny his second-in-command. Yet Sam is kinda like his second too. If you are going by official titles, it’s Benny Lafitte, but because of how much Dean considers Sam’s input as well, you could say that both Benny and Sam share the title of second. Sam is the Pack’s official physician, he’ll most likely be the one to examine you when we get back.” Pam added as Castiel nodded his understanding. “Benny is a unique man. Now, while Dean and Benny knew each other since they were pups, for a long time their lives led them down separate paths. He didn’t really resurface until Dean became Head Alpha and Benny washed up on his doorstep. Benny’s secretive past caused ripples for a short time between Dean and Sam. Not much is known really, since Benny is an extremely private Alpha and Dean isn’t one for gossip, but there are rumors of him being a ‘pirate’ of sorts in his past. That he was with—or even ran—a dangerous group of Alphas doing exports and imports, which is how he came to know so much about packs all over the world. But Benny has proven himself repeatedly over the years of his loyalty to Dean and that’s what counts. Honestly, it's been essential for Dean to have someone that knows so much about other packs. The few wars or ignorant rival packs that had decided to attempt an attack on the Winchester Pack… Well, any doubts about Benny were rather quickly squashed. He and Dean were fierce and wrathful in the battles and had saved each other more times than you’d think. That greatly placated Sam, but still. I honestly think there's a bit of jealousy from both men and it’s endearing, at least to me, that two grown-ass Alphas who clearly both care about their Head Alpha’s well being growl at each other instead of working together. That’s Alphas for you, acting like babies.” Pam laughed when Benny sighed in annoyance, clearly having heard everything and rolling his eyes. Castiel flushed and looked away from the Alpha.
was free from him. Safe, mind clear of ever knowing he had even existed… no traces of
“I’m sure you’re right. It's been five years, and the things I see in these flashbacks are just confusing. The visions never change.I suppose I should focus on the here and now and figure out my future.” As he spoke the words, it felt like a stone had formed in his stomach, and yet it felt painfully
Dean nodded. He did feel bad for interrupting, but he had reasons. “I need to uphold my honor and take my revenge. I cannot be fully present for my Omega and his needs until I release this wrath upon the ones responsible for hurting him and for slaughtering our offspring.”
“Of course. I don’t want to worry you, Alpha. The Styne Pack did have something kind of like that, only it was called a ‘provide.’ Alpha Ishim would select people to mate with Alphas or Omegas from other packs. He who decided who went with who,” Castiel supplied, which made Dean arch a brow.
Sam nodded his understanding, and studied his brother and his Omega. This hadn’t exactly been how he had hoped to meet his brother’s Omega. Dean had raved and gushed about Castiel while on their hunt after Mating Season. He had been excited about introducing Castiel to him, and to the clan and Elders. Then everything had gone horribly wrong. Sam’s heart ached for Dean. His brother looked so worried and confused as to how to help his mate.
Once he was dry and dressed in his favorite worn grey sleep pants, he made his way towards the bed when the sudden need to see and scent his pup became too strong to deny. He smiled to himself, calling Lily his own… She felt like she was… She was a Winchester and no one could say otherwise. Before he knew it, he was downstairs, making his way down the hall and through the ajar door into Lily’s nursery on stealthy bare feet.
Dean looked at Pam and Crowley before he said a quick “Excuse us,” and met Benny out into the hallway.
Dean was trying to keep his swirling emotions in check as he made his way into the kitchen to find Sam and Crowley arguing while Pam ate a piece of bacon from a large plate left on the counter with a side of blueberry pancakes.
“No, it is not ‘prudent’, yet we cannot ignore the Merfolk’s involvement in the slaughter. It was from ancient fear, hurt pride that was still raw after all this time, and that sea puffer fish needed another reason to attack us!” Rowena growled. The  Cecaelia Omega was even older than Henry, and their clan’s Sorceress. She was powerful and resourceful, fought fiercely for their kin, and had no tolerance for Alphas with wounded pride.
Sam frowned and kept his hazel eyes on his patient’s round form. “And she’s quieted down now?”
As Castiel took a step into the room, he was suddenly grasped roughly and shoved up against the wall with a large hand around his neck and all the Omega could see in the darkness of the room was glowing Alpha red eyes inches from his face. The loud warning growl reverberated off the walls of the empty room. The menacing sound sent his heart racing as a soft whimper slid up his throat unbidden.
Feeling bold, Castiel pressed a finger to Dean’s bowed lips to silence him, the touch gaining him the man’s undivided attention.
“Bela gave me her blessing to be with Dean,” Castiel heard himself blurt out. He quickly covered his face with his hands.
He had to thank Crowley at some point. The collar ceremony had always been a big deal, had always demanded an audience to welcome the new claimed Omega to the fold. And yet this was anything but tradition… This had been purely to save face. Nearly the whole pack would be attending the funeral tonight, and it wouldn’t be good for them to see Castiel with a bite mark and smelling like Dean but with no collar. Crowley making sure Bela also had one was a hell of a move… Dean had scented the hesitance mixed in with her joy and sadness… He loved her and he knew she was trying to accept his decision and Castiel’s presence, he just hoped them trying would be enough.
“This is Michael. He has been helping to take care of you,” Castiel introduced. The man, Michael, nodded his hello, yet kept a guarded distance and kept looking towards the Omega. Castiel turned back to look at the standing Alpha, his head tilted ever so slightly towards the flat of a door. Michael’s jaw clenched, and he hesitated as his pale grey eyes flickered back to Dean’s before returning to Castiel. A breath later, he moved and exited the tent. It was then that Dean noticed just how large the tent was. This was a permanent fixture, a year long habitat, and as he watched Michael leave, he saw there was a double function to the flap. There was a sheer one that covered the second that led to the other side, and Dean saw white. There was snow outside, and yet the room was warm and comfortable. He then noticed there was a stone hearth at the other side of the room.
The redheaded Omega nodded and left his bedroom. Sleep pulled at him and as Castiel settled himself comfortably on the bed, his mind turned blank and he surrendered to dreams of the massive wolf running through the forest.
“You saw my wolf form. I was out for a run, it helps me clear my head, and then I felt you… I felt Lily coming. I think our bond has been getting stronger. Before I knew it, I found you there in the clearing but Cain’s horses were spooked. They don’t really understand what I am, it's kinda why I don’t go out there, I scare them.” Dean reached out and caressed Lily’s head as she fed hungrily, both Alpha and Omega not worried about the baring moment.
“Yes Alpha, thank you.” Castiel carefully sat down in the chair as Pam stayed near and Crowley watched the proceedings.
“He’s a wonderful father,” Castiel said simply as he continued to video their playing.
Castiel was still trying to process this news. Lily could shift… She was beautiful, her coat was similar to Dean’s, with creams and browns mixed in, and her blue eyes were bright and filled with glee. Castiel lowered himself to the floor, and the pup bounced towards him, licking his face all over, tail wagging. His baby could shift… The Winchester bloodline was indeed powerful. As he cuddled her in his arms, her incredibly soft fur soothing him, he couldn’t keep the smile from his face. He looked up at Dean, who was sitting back on his haunches. The Dire Wolf was massive and his presence should have been terrifying, yet Castiel had never felt so happy and safe. He laughed as Dean puffed out his chest, obviously quite proud that Lily could shift. The Omega would definitely have his hands full now, with a pup that could run around on fours legs before she could even walk on two.
Even though he could still see himself, and what he was looking at in the mirror was hot. It wasn’t right. It wasn’t him. He didn’t look like how he should. He’s enjoyed these last few days but it wasn’t truly him. And as much as he loved the sex in this body, he was excited to continue what they began in his real body.
Dean closed his eyes and pressed his lips against Rowena’s. He was gentle, parting her lips with his tongue before sliding it in. She kissed him back, taking his kiss in deeper. Her eyes fluttered shut, letting the taste of Dean overwhelm her.
“No, just the look on your face.”
“I mean, we could with just us.”
Sammy helped Rowena get everything ready for the reversal spell. It was a potion that Dean would drink, not as simple as the witches curse. But it would get the job done, and that’s all that mattered for them.
“Dean, Sam. I’ve never been with another man, let alone two,” Cas said shyly.
Dean was already halfway to his room by the time he yelled back. “We’ll call Rowena in the morning. Right now, I don’t care. I need to sleep.”
“Fuck! Cas!”
“Shut up, Dean!”
Dean noticed Sam’s face, his furrowed brow and nervous expression. Holy shit, Sammy’s turned on by me. Dean felt a twinge between his legs and the sudden warmth and wetness.
Running his tongue just under the head of Sam’s cock, he took the tip into his mouth. Slowly swirling his tongue around it, letting it slide across the slit. Then slowly making his way down the length. Tongue moving side to side, swallowing as he went. Tasting every last inch before he reached the base. Mouth full, lips stretched wide. He stayed there at the base for a moment, before pulling back up. Dean repeated this a few more times, all while making sure he never stopped moving his hand on Cas’ cock.
Sam continued, “Dean, I think I know what the curse was. Look down.”
The hunter smirked, taking another drink, “You didn’t seem to think it was an issue last night.”
Sam raised an eyebrow. “Maintaining also includes brushing. I could help you if you wanted.”
Sam grabbed his legs and pushed them up onto the chair. Dean sat legs spread and vulnerable. Sammy marveled at Dean’s pussy. Refusing to think about the whole situation he brought his face to it, taking a deep breath before diving in.
“That would explain a lot,” interrupted Sam.
Sam sat on the edge of his bed, his cock in his hand, not sure if he should be doing this. He knew the image of his brother, who was suddenly a girl, would fill his mind.
Cas pounded into him harder. He played with Dean’s nipples with one hand, pinching, twisting and tugging on them. His other hand was positioned so that his thumb was pressed against his clit. He circled and pressed Dean’s throbbing clit, sending him over the edge more. Dean clenched around Cas, his pussy pulsating as he continued to come.
“Oh.” Dean said softly, looking at the hand print scorched into his skin.
Sam took Dean in deeper, sucking and swallowing as he made his way to the base. He closed his eyes as he pulled back up to the head, running his tongue over it. He did this several times slowly, enjoying the taste and the stretch of his lips. He began to work faster, he moved his hand to caress Dean’s balls, massaging them. With his other hand he placed it on Dean’s ass, grabbing it tightly.
Cas took the tablet from Dean, reading the same paragraph that he had just read. He mouthed the words silently to himself. His face furrowed the more he read.
Sorry for the long wait. I’ve been busy lately and haven’t had the time to sit down and write. I have several new chapters finished and will be uploading them this week.
******************************************************************
“Great, when’s she getting here?”
“Shit!” They both said in unison.
Sam gasped slightly as Dean began to run his tongue over the head, sucking as he did. Sam pushed his throbbing member deeper and deeper into Dean’s throat. Dean hit the base, he could feel Sam in the back of his throat.  Sam slowly pulled his cock out, then slammed back in.
Turning off the shower and wrapping a towel around his waist, old habits, Dean stepped out. He caught a look at himself in the mirror and admired himself. He was an attractive girl. The kind of girl he would have tried to pick up in a bar, or flirt his ass off if he was a waitress in a diner in the middle of nowhere. Someone he could give an amazing night to and then never saw again.
“Probably not. But I don’t care, not right now.”
“What? Dean, I don’t want to bother you, nor do I want anything to be an issue after Rowena cures you.”
“Who are you?” Sam said defensively standing up suddenly. Confused by what he was witnessing.
Cas walked over to where Sam and Dean were, still embraced together. Sam reached out and grabbed the angels hand pulling him closer before kissing Dean again.
Cas greeted the Winchester before letting him know the plan for the day. “Rowena called not long ago. She’ll be here around seven tonight. She just needs to get some supplies that we don’t have here.”
Dean let out a deep sigh, he knew this was coming. He prepared for the angel to tear into him.
Dean came hard, his legs shook, stomach rolled and his back arched. His eyes rolled back as he let out a muffled yell. Cas stood up, his cock already out and pants pulled down to his ankles. The angel quickly pushed his cock into Dean’s hole, stretching him out. Like Sam, Cas didn’t hold back.
Dean nodded and stood up letting Sam, who was now naked, sit down. Dean looked at him with a worried expression.
“Morning,” Dean said, his voice hoarse from sleep still.
Sam looked at him ashamed of what he was about to ask. “Dean, so did everything change?”
Sam nodded.
“I came in here to ask if you were feeling okay. You haven't come out in some time and we are getting worried. The potion can have an ill effect, making you feel a bit under the weather.”
A knock on the door stopped them. Dean called out telling Cas to come in. Cas stepped into the room, frozen for a moment at the scene before him. Dean stepped away from Sam and walked over to Cas. He touched the angel’s cheek, pulling him in to kiss him. He kissed Cas deeply with need. Cas felt his cock harden in his pants as Dean pressed his wet and naked body against him.
Pouring the contents of the bowl into a glass, Rowena handed it to Dean. The hunter took it and downed it in some gulp. It tasted sour, and he had trouble keeping it down, but he managed. Sam and Cas watched Dean, curious as to whether or not there would be any immediate effects. But there was none to be seen.
Sam cut him off, “Dean! I don’t…”
“I called Rowena and she’ll be here, but not for another two days,” spoke Sam.
Reaching down he grabbed Dean, pulling him upwards and towards him. Their faces collided, lips crashing into each other, kissing one another deeply. Cas was still standing there, hands at his sides, fingers curled under, head tilted to the side.
Dean reached for his belt, that was bucketed as tight as it would go out and began to undo it. Letting his pants drop, he wore oversized Scooby-Doo boxers under, Sam gave a half smile. Dean began to pull those down as well when Sam stopped him.
Dean sat across from Sam at the table in the library of the bunker. He had tried to find something of his that fit better on his new cursed body, but nothing fit right. His shirt cling to his chest, and his nipples hardened against the soft fabric from the cold air in the bunker.
Dean adjusted on the table. “Yeah yeah, let’s just get this over with. I want to be me again, dammit.”
“Let’s do it then,” stated Dean, ready to begin.
“Seriously, Dean. You look like a train wreck with that. I have no idea how someone could come out of the shower, with their hair looking like it hasn’t been washed in weeks.”
Cas blushed, “I’ve felt the same, for both of you.”
Dean pushed his hips back onto Cas’ cock sending Cas back onto Sam’s. Cas was helpless to the two hunters' rhythm. His fingers dug into Dean’s hips, his neatly trimmed nails digging into his skin. He moved his hips faster and harder, thrusting into Dean deeper and deeper. On the other side of him, Cas felt Sam keep up with the speed as his own orgasm built up.
Cas smiled at Dean, happy to have him back. “I’m glad you are back to normal, Dean.”
Dean thought about it a moment before replying, “Yeah, Sammy. I do. It will be different, I’ll be me again. But yeah, I hope so.”
Cas loved the way Dean tasted. He loved the moans he let out as his tongue moved, exploring every inch of Dean’s pussy. He slowly made his way down to the entrance, making sure no area was missed. He circled the entrance, teasing Dean before plunging his tongue into the tight hole. Swirling and moving in and out at the same time, Cas began to fuck Dean with his tongue.
“Sam, I know who this is. What happened to you, Dean?”
“I’m good, yeah. Just haven’t really had that much time to myself lately.”
Sam began to thrust into Dean, feeling his warmth squeeze his cock. He didn’t wait to build up a rhythm, instead Sam began hard and fast. Taking what was his, pounding into his brother’s tight pussy, making Dean scream out. Sam quickly muffled him with a kiss.
“I’m just going to leave,” the angel said.
“I can get used to this,” Dean said with a laugh.
What did matter was getting through this day and the next couple without any issues. Sex wasn’t an issue of course, he was Dean Winchester after all.  The issue was being stuck in the bunker and knowing the effects the curse has on Sam and Cas would end up causing issues after Rowena fixes things.
He couldn’t help but moan loudly. He gave up caring that Sam could probably hear him. And in the back of his mind, he hoped that Sam did. Ignoring how wrong that was he moved his hand faster and faster until it once again became too sensitive. He pushed past it and kept going. His pussy was wetter and wetter. His stomach curled within itself, trembling, his thighs shook, he felt like he had no control over his body.
“You good?” Sammy asked, his voice was low and quiet.
“Rowena, I thought that you weren’t going to be here until later tonight?” Castiel asked in a gruff, monotone voice.
Dean held onto the headboard tightly, his tits bouncing in Cas’ face. He moaned out in pleasure as he felt each cock sliding in and out, his pussier getting wetter and wetter. As Cas’ cock pulled out Sam’s slammed in. Over and over.
Dean got onto the bed, never letting go of Sam. Sam’s mouth moved down to Dean’s neck, his hands wandered down. Grabbing gently at his breast, pinching his nipples, before moving slow to the slick wetness between his legs. Dean gasped when his brother’s long fingers slid between his thighs and into him.
“Yeah, let’s go get some. Wanna head to the diner in town?” Sam asked.
It wasn’t the gay part of it. Was what they did gay? Kinda, maybe, no? Dean was still Dean, so maybe a little. But that wasn’t the issue. Dean knew he was bi, and had experimented with other guys in the past, never going all the way, but still, he knew he was into men as well.
Sam was already semi-hard, and had been since he entered into the room and saw Dean again. Cas on the other hand was trying hard to not let his body, his vessel, move blood to any part that didn’t need that much blood.
Soon Dean was ready to cum again, but he tried to hold it off, he wanted the three of them to cum together. Cas moaned he was close, Sam replied in a husky voice that he was too. Sam pounded into Dean’s ass fiercely, causing Cas to go over the edge.
“Sam, I know what sex is. I’m a celestial being, older than any human to have ever walked this Earth.”
Sam stayed down for as long as he could, only moving his face slightly to the side to catch his breath before continuing. He flicked Dean’s clit with the tip of his tongue, swirling around it one way then quickly in the opposite direction. Then he sucked on it a bit, tongue still swirling. Dean reached down and ran his fingers through Sam’s long hair, grabbing it in his fist, eyes closed shut as his legs shook.
The next morning Dean awoke in his bed. He felt different, yet normal at the same time. He adjusted his eyes as he opened them, taking a moment for them to become clear. He could feel his body, it wasn’t the same as it had been when he went to bed.
“So did I. It’s just. I never thought, well, I always wondered…”
Dean’s eyes fluttered open, crusted with sleep, he squeezed his eyes together and rubbed the dust of the night away. Yawning he sat up, not daring to look at the clock, knowing he slept in late.
“I know, Cas. I… I’m nervous Sam and I won’t ever be the same. What if he doesn’t truly want me when I’m me again?” Dean’s voice broke slightly.
Dean’s own guilt drowned his heart. “It wasn’t your fault.I wasn’t there to protect you and our-” His throat threatened to close on him as the emotions of his shared pain made it hard to swallow.
Challenges were only resolved in two ways: someone surrendered or died. Most Head Alphas would end the life of the challenger even if they surrendered, for fear of retaliation later. Doing so also showed the Head Alpha’s power, and was a warning to others that the repercussions for going against him were grave. In Castiel's own home pack, Head Alpha Ishim was particularly ruthless to anyone that opposed him, making examples out of the challenger’s whole family and taking the challenger’s Omegas as his own.
The once Head Omega smiled at him before she turned to find a place among the crowd. Castiel noticed just how soothing her scent had been, that her smile had been genuine, and he couldn’t stop the elated feeling inside of him. He still felt like he was the main reason she and Dean’s relationship had ended, but he couldn’t lie, he was incredibly happy that she complimented Lily. He watched as Bela moved through the crowd with a small following trailing after her. She placed herself near the front of the platform and watched Dean as he spoke. She had a fond smile on her lips, yet Castiel saw the tinge of sadness in her pretty features and his heart ached for her.
“Right? Sneaky bastards! They are damn smart and cunning. A buddy of mine had pissed one off once; can’t remember why, but the octopus had let my buddy’s whole day’s worth of catch back into the water. That little fucker had
Castiel held onto his briefcase like a lifeline as he waited to be called in for his interview. He tried to keep his legs from giggling from nervousness but wasn’t completely successful. This was the second major step in his plan, the first had been to give his resignation to Crowley and that hadn’t gone as well as he had hoped. Crowley had been less than professional and had told him point blank not to return crawling back when he couldn’t find a job. However as Castiel had walked out and away from the Omega Clinic, a heavy weight had lifted from him and it had been the first time in months since Dean had left that he had felt a spark of happiness in his path.
“Cas?! Talk to me, what's going on?” Charlie tried to get him to respond, helping him back to the bed.
A sudden fierce, sharp pain of longing struck him to his core. Tears filled his eyes as he leaned forward on the vanity.
“Good, and well, now that we have found each other, you will never have to worry about it happening,” Castiel stated with a soft smile. However, when Dean frowned, clearly confused by his statement, the Omega rushed to explain. “I’m not sure if you have healed enough to feel it…we are true mates. You are my intended.”
The entries stopped after day sixty-six, and there was an array of the symbols hastily scribbled all over the remaining empty pages. There was no information nor inclination as to what those symbols meant, but Dean assumed they somehow ‘protected’ against whatever monster had been tormenting the owner of the cabin. Why else would someone label every inch of their home with creepy symbols?
The Omega laid down in the grass and lifted Lily up in the air. Her tiny arms waved about, with the bright blue sky above her… She looked like an angel. Castiel loved her beyond words and he couldn’t keep his eyes from tearing up as he gently rocked her side to side through the air. She smiled, a first full gummy smile that made an emotional lump lodge in Castiel’s throat as he laughed watching her. Lily’s freckles had darkened under the sun’s rays and Castiel’s heart skipped a beat. She looked like Dean. It made his heart twist in confusion. The light brown hair that almost seemed blond, her freckles, her bowed mouth, the shape of her chin… these were dominant Winchester traits, he knew, the brothers all shared distinctive features that accompanied their bloodline and yet, as he watched Lily’s eyes start to droop against her will… her stubborn pout reminded him of Dean’s instead of Adam’s…
