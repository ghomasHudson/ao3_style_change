“It turns out I have to thank you, then,” Cas says politely. Meihui makes another high noise. Yàn just chuckles.
wants for this to happen, the Angels aren’t planning on bringing me back. Maybe I’m just not supposed to survive this.”
“When did you realize you were attracted to men?” Dean asks without thinking of it. That’s not really the question he wanted to ask, but he’s got a lack of inspiration right now.
Sam stays quiet after that. He can’t go against the Angel, since the guy would know these things better. The Grace listens to him since it’s a part of him. Sam shouting at Dean would only rile them up more. Finally, the hunter nods, agreeing that he
Dean nods proudly, remembering the few times he tried to practice his old program with his favorite pair of skates. Sure, he kept on failing at one point, but that was mostly because something in his head stopped him, rather than a failure in his abilities.
But Gilda came across this flyer to what looked like an amazing party, and when she begged Charlie to come along she thought it had been a good idea. Now, though, she’s not so sure about that anymore.
Sam doesn’t look up but his face does seem worried. His hands still, breath catches, and then he sighs.
completely different from when Cas does it. “You’ll never see him again, you do realize that, right?”
“Give me a moment,” he says in return, closing his eyes again. After a deep breath, he empties his mind like he’s always done when trying to talk to his brothers and sisters, and he forms out the message they’ve agreed on.
With a sigh, Castiel sees that her soul is already back in Heaven. With a touch of his fingers, he heals the damage the spell has brought to her, and then in just a matter of seconds he gets back to Heaven to find Charlie's soul, and grabbing it back down with him. She doesn't even have time to speak up, only barely arrived and then already on her way back down. In a very short time, Charlie suddenly jumps up in surprise.
“Will you hold me?” he asks Castiel, and the Angel is surprised at how vulnerable he sounds. Dean normally isn’t the one to ask for this, but who is Castiel to deny him? If Dean is feeling sad and low, Castiel shouldn’t question it, but help him. So he nods and opens up his arms, allowing for Dean to press up against him.
it because Dean practically panics every time the Angel tries to get close to that part Dean shouldn’t have.
Straight people should just get their shit together. It’s obvious, it’s there. They have no reason to hesitate like this.
“You know what, it’s too late to change what you did now, so we’re going to make the best of this opportunity!” Krissy says, pressing a hand on Emma’s shoulder. The blonde looks up in surprise, a little taken aback from Krissy’s smile. “I still think your father is a dweep, Emms, but he deserves a break from being lonely all the time.”
He’s a rather private person, and he doesn’t really like it when people read along on his screen. Charlie, while being a sweet girl, is also way too curious for Castiel’s good.
“What’s your name?” Lauren asks while she leads the woman through the park. A few people are staring at them which she wouldn’t blame them for. How ridiculous must they look?
“Remember what you said to me and Benny when we first got here? About the purity of this place?” Emma starts. Dean decides he’s gotten enough of it and quickens his pace, actively trying to get away from his place
And that’s how, twenty minutes later, Castiel finds himself biting down in a croissant while listening to some story Charlie manages to bring up from Comic Con about a guy dressed up as the slave version of Leia from Star Wars. Castiel only saw those movies once so he can only vaguely recall what that’s about.
“Okay, let’s not do this,” Tracy says while standing up again. She makes her way to the refrigerator and pulls out a bottle of beer, not even bothering to hand one to Sam too. He doesn’t mind, though.
As they get to the back of the computer, Dean passes his hand over the surface of the machine. At first all he feels is the touch of metal, but there’s something more he notices.
“Are you talking about the twins? I think you just went way overboard with the fertilizer, pal,” Dean counters dryly. Gabriel seems unimpressed by that accusation. For a moment, she closes her eyes, like she’s thinking, and then, suddenly, another voice appears behind him.
This should be the right time to call Dean, Castiel realizes, and he almost dreads having to explain what exactly happened.
Dean just wants to go down there. Wants to tell him that he’s here, that he understands now. That he feels the same thing Cas feels.
the Grace says. Dean can recognize it better now, even though the voices aren’t as strong as when they’re angry.
I'm not really happy with this chapter, mostly because I can't write smut for shit. Apologies for that, I just need to practice it a little more.
“Guys,” somebody calls out from a room nearby. Great, somebody else has a problem to add to the pile they already have. Gabriel sees how Lauren Porter comes walking in with her car keys in her hands, but looking a bit confused. “Who locked the garage? I can’t get out?”
“Yeah, uh, Dean Winchester,” he said as he offered the man his hand to shake. Castiel took it hesitantly, and he didn’t put much force in it. “I skate with your brother,” he added. Castiel nodded lightly, pulled his hand back, and frowned.
With another sigh leaving his mouth, Dean quickly opens up his messenger-app, since there's no way for Cas to text on a plane. He can see that Cas is online, so he starts up a new message.
Eventually, Dean gets out to prepare his stuff, pulling out a car battery from his trunk along some jumper cables, and making his way back inside. He passes along Cole on his path, and finds him just hanging up.
Dean doesn’t believe him. And he’s going to get cruched when they’ll get their answer from the Archangel.
“Don’t worry, I won’t do anything you don’t want to do,” Castiel assures him with a soft caress on his face. His other hand continues what it’s been doing, then, but after a few more seconds he stops again. He scrambles back a little bit so his hand has a better reach, and his eyes are stuck on Dean’s.
he knows. Angels know where he is, meaning that he’s an easy target the moment he steps out of the safe space of his room.
“Ah, Balthazar, right?” Dean asks, trying not to sound too much like a jerk. Balthazar is dressed in a black long-sleeved shirt and dark blue training pants. He’s wearing dark skates, as well, and he’s looking at Dean with a very unimpressed look.
“Burn marks, maybe? Don’t know, really,” the Officer says. “We pulled his cell phone records. He made two calls to the same number prior to the attack. Tried the number, but the line’s dead now. Probably a burner.”
“I’ve been… eh… trying summoning a few guys,” Sam says hesitantly. Dean looks back up at him, trying to find anything that would make that a little clearer. Sam understands, at least. “Other Angels… and Gods.”
“No, not yet,” Dean mutters back, spitting the blood away from his mouth and returning the punch and adding another one right after that. He ignores the pain in his own fist, instead turning back around to look for anything that might be useful as a weapon. Sadly, the only thing he can find are baby-stuff. Nothing sharp, in other words.
I feel like I'm almost finished writing the story. I'm not following a posting-day anymore. I've never really been good at those, after all.
“Yeah, I did. I must really like you,” he teases. Castiel blinks at him, his right hand holding on to the plushie he got.
“Not just the ladies,” Jimmy snickers, and Dean gives him a light swat on the head for that remark before taking his cellphone again.
During the whole day he had felt that something wasn’t right. He had been invited to eat with Garth’s pack – nothing strange happened there – and Sam had been ready to leave the town, much to Dean’s dismay, but then there was this deer killing, sudden attack by that stupid son of a bitch called Russ, discovery of Ragnarök, and eventually there was a showdown in the barn where Bess’ stephmother had finally been shot by Dean.
“Right, because that happens… never,” he says sarcastically. Next to him, Dean takes off his glasses and starts rubbing his eye. Then he turns towards his brother.
With a hand holding the sideboard, Dean puts his first foot on the ice. Much like he suspected, it’s extremely slippery. If he wasn’t holding himself up, he would surely have fallen on the ground.
Eventually, the class is over for them. While they go change back into their normal shoes, the teenagers already start preparing themselves for their lesson. Dean smirks as he thinks of what he's got prepared for them.
“He spoke of me? Oh, what did he tell you, don’t leave out any details!” she returns in a fake enthusiasm, trying to appear… well… her age. She can’t be much more than seventeen, right? Maybe eighteen at most. “Listen,
Dean nods, understanding too how the war changed his father back in the day. He can’t help but bite his lip upon seeing this woman crying like that in front of him. For some reason he’s starting to breathe deeper and louder, almost as if he’s trying to keep himself from crying as well. Cas notices, and without Beth seeing it he puts his hand upon Dean’s belly, comforting both Dean and the twins.
His last phone call with Cole had been twenty minutes ago, and the guy had been in Kit’s house already, apparently trying to convince Jemma to get out of there. Dean can’t really be concerned for the guy at the moment, what with dehydrating his husband at the exact moment.
At the bar, there’s a girl looking a little bit annoyed busy cleaning up the glasses. She picks up a glass, dries them off, and slams them a little harder than necessary back down on the shelve behind her. Sam wishes himself some courage before he lets out a long breath and walks forward.
“None so far. It could be a Wendigo that has travelled far, but it might as well be just a bear or something.”
“Why would you do that? It says in the letter that your father doesn’t want to hear anything from her ever again?” Krissy mutters as she pulls the letter from Emma’s hands. The blonde twenty-year-old just rolls her eyes, sighing loudly as if that’s the most ridiculous question ever asked.
“Of course, the Earth is born, humanity is created, then humanity kills itself and the Earth dies. It’s a continuous cycle that has been going on for an unspeakable amount of years. Perhaps if you were to ask that Horseman-friend of yours, he could give you the answers.”
It’s not like Dean will fall down without someone to help him keep his balance, but it probably just calms down Cas’ nerves a little bit, so Dean might just as well indulge him with this.
“Never seen you naked and wet and in the daylight,” Dean offers in return. He pushes himself upright again and shuffles towards Cas. When his face gets closer to the Angel’s, he already closes his eyes and hopes they will meet in the middle.
“I’m getting your tie right,” he tells him. Castiel suddenly blushes next to him. Once Dean is finished, Kristen looks down in confusion. She seems to want to ask for an explanation, but Dean simply shrugs.
“Yeah?” he asks, surprised by the softness of his voice. After all this time spent with Cas, it feels good again to just simply hang around with his little brother. He cares about Cas, a lot, but there’s still nothing Dean would put in front of his brother. That’s also why the pair has decided not to exaggerate on their time together. Castiel understands that the bond the brothers share is a rare one.
“I was wondering if you might want to give lessons in… you know, the skating that you just did?” she asks, and Dean’s eyes widen, not having expected that at all. Sure, he was aware that they had been watching him for the past three weeks, but that he might actually inspire somebody? That feels weird to say the least.
In the backseat, Kevin is seated between Lauren and Cas, and through the mirror Dean can tell that it’s quite awkward for them. He can’t help the laugh escaping from his lips. Cas looks like he’s trying his best to give Kevin all the space he needs by pushing himself completely to the window. Lauren seems intent to make Kevin uncomfortable by occasionally throwing her hair back and letting it fall on the Prophet’s shoulder.
“Showoff,” he mutters out, but then he scrapes his throat again. “I think I’m going to ask her tonight, but I need to practice my lines. Will you help me?”
Sam offers Dean a sympathetic look when the older hunter stares at the kitchen in defeat. It really sucks, though, because he’s spent almost a whole afternoon cleaning that room, only to have it trashed again by a witch with a tantrum.
“I just want to know what they are? Why do I have them?” she tries. Gabriel groans in annoyance and turns around. Then he nods towards her to follow him. Silently, she does.
But then he remembered the man sitting between him and Jimmy. The uneasy, socially awkward ice-skater who was dragged here against his will. He had been silent as well, but in fact so quiet that Dean had even forgotten he was there. So, while Jimmy was talking with Sam and Jess about the domestic life with children, Dean turned around to the quiet man next to him, and smiled at him.
Jonah’s hand in his own. A loud sob suddenly escapes his lips, and only then does he realize that he’s been crying. Damn these hormones. On the other side, Alan, too, holds out his hand, but instead on waiting for Dean, he takes his without asking. And like that, Dean Winchester is standing in the middle of Purgatory, holding the hands of the two hallucinations of his children with his third standing right in front of him.
"And that was Dirk, eighteen years old," someone calls out, and Dean knows that means the guy finished. This probably means it's Dean's turn, right?
“You had someone on your mind while you said all that?” Garth jokes, but Dean can see that he’s genuinely interested. At first, he thinks about lying; it’s not Garth’s business what he and Cas are doing together. But then, he finds no reason not to tell. If he’s serious about being with the Angel, his friends should know.
“Yes?” the woman asks. Castiel takes in her appearance; brown, wavy hair, brown eyes and sharp cheekbones. She’s wearing a black dress that seems more fitting for a party rather than to just lounge around at home.
“How about you show Cas what you guys got?” Dean then asks, and six faces look up in utter surprise, one of them even appearing horrified.
By the time that she’s been at Lauren’s for over a month, she has given up hope of ever finding her previous family again. And to make it even worse, she pretty much has a panic attack when she notices the blood on her bedsheet for the first time.
Jimmy turns around so fast Dean almost thinks he broke his neck in the process. His eyes are wide, expression panicked. Immediately he lifts up his hands in a stopping gesture.
Castiel just stares, a loud breath escaping through his nose. He realizes his hands are balled into fists. The urge to punch him in the face is just so strong.
“Who’s got a secret girlfriend?” Benny asks when he sits down next to Dorothy. Victor goes next to Jo, followed by Inias. At the end, Dean sits down as well, taking place next to Castiel since that’s the only free spot left.
“What, are you mad, now?” Dean asks in a sudden panic. Cas just shrugs, but doesn’t look up. Great, only one hour awake and he’s already managed to piss him off.
And yeah, we are now kind of following the season 10 storyline as much as it fits with the story. There'll be no Cole, though, because I have no idea how to write him into the story. Sorry for the Cole-fans.
Sam catches the second bottle Claire had with her. He barely manages to open the bottle before he has to dodge another strike coming from Ben. Hipster-demon now, too, falls down on his knees.
Cas sighs again and turns around, pulling away from Dean’s hold. Dean only notices then that his heart is beating at a fast rate. Is that fear he’s feeling? Is he actually scared for Cas’ choices here?
“In total there have been about twenty more cases slightly related to this one in America alone,” he reveals. “They don’t match completely, but they all share a common thing.”
“What? No way!” Castiel counters quickly, though unable to take his eyes off the beautiful handwriting Wind has. He noticed it on the other note as well, but this time there’s so much more written. The word ‘love’ bringing an extremely happy feeling into his stomach.
Sam sighs. “Not really,” he admits. Castiel turns away from the television and faces Sam, his whole posture indicating that he’s ready to listen to him. “He’s at the hospital. The doctors are keeping an eye on him, but yesterday they asked me to come over.”
, okay?” she says, as if that’s explanation enough. Then she gestures to the pillows on the ground. Jimmy sits down immediately, but Castiel hesitates a little longer. He really should get back to Dean before he comes looking for him.
Tracy nods lightly. Somehow, her hand finds Sam’s, and she squeezes his fingers. He looks back up at her again, can’t help but wondering what she’s actually trying to do.
It takes a while for him to realize that the piece is over, and his hears surprisingly lowers its speed. His fingers are shaking above the keys, and his longs long for the air he has hold back. With an effort he puts his hands down on his legs to stop the shaking, and then he remembers Sam.
did you even bring him here if he’s so untrustworthy?” Lauren almost shouts. Her hands slam loudly on the table, and her eyes bore deeply into Castiel’s as she stares him down angrily. It’s not the first time that Sam has seen her this way, but it’s safe to say that she scares him like this.
the sap here, in my opinion,” Castiel counters. Dean opens his mouth to throw something back, but he can’t figure out what to say. Instead, he kisses the Angel again while the song comes to an end. The hands that hold on to each other have their fingers entwined together, and they don’t let go when Dean pushes Castiel on the bed and comes to lean above him. Their lips don’t lose contact either, and somehow the song repeats in the background.
“Just, don’t keep it to yourself for too long, okay?” And then she finally lets go of him to grab her bag again, having prepared it earlier this morning. There’s an extra plastic bag where her presents are. Dean picks that one up since it’s the lightest (and everybody starts to have a fit if he even touches anything heavy) and together they once more make their way to the garage.
“Yeah, yeah, I mean, it wasn’t always easy, but yeah,” Sam adds to it. They don’t exactly sound sure about it, but still there’s a truth in their voice that tells Castiel that they mean it.
your penis,” Castiel mutters against his lips, and Dean can’t hold the laugh that comes out of his mouth. He presses the back of his arm against his eyes and turns his head away, unable to stop the chuckling. Castiel’s confused face makes it even better, and now he’s laughing hysterically. His stomach starts to hurt from it, and there are tears forming in his eyes.
“Hello, Castiel,” she greets him with a smile, and Castiel just nods, honestly a bit disappointed that it’s her who’s answering. Mostly he had hoped it would have been Gabriel, or maybe even Naomi since she’s got friends in high places and quite the ‘politician’. But no, instead it’s his own previous leader who has chosen humanity above eternal life. By then, Castiel hadn’t understood why somebody would do that. Now that he’s with Dean, he can understand the charm in having an end nearing with every day.
The girls take them to the library inside the school. It’s still early, so there aren’t many other students walking around in here. Sam takes a look around the archives, and eventually comes up with a book. He drops it down on the table so the two girls can read along.
Both Dean and Sam roll their eyes, but Castiel does receive a playful shove against his shoulder, and the phone is once again taken out of his hands, this time put back on the table, plugged right back into the recharger.
Obviously, his parents hadn’t been happy with him. They were too young to become grandparents, Dean wasn’t responsible enough yet to have a kid. There was the usual speech that he’d heard a million times. Lydia’s parents, on the other hand, never said much. They were probably silently disappointed with them.
“Shut up, Cas,” Dean interrupts him. He snatches the clothes out of his husband’s hand and quickly puts them on before Cas can get a real good look on his legs. So far he hasn’t noticed, but for Dean it’s all he can see whenever he’s looking into the mirror. That, next to, of course, the swell of his belly now that he’s reached the twelfth week of pregnancy.
“Um,” Garth chuckles shortly, scratches his nose and looks down. “I know this may sound a little crazy, but… maybe I could come back and hunt with you. I mean, with my werewolf mojo, we’d have an advantage.”
“Fine, but this conversation is not over, Cassie,” Jimmy says before disappearing again. The moment he’s gone, Cas lets out a long breath. He stares long at his skates, and neither really wants to start talking. Dean pokes him in the side then, indicating that they might as well continue skating as they were. Cas agrees silently.
His hands are gripping the wheel tightly, his foot pressing the acceleration pedal a bit too long. He passes by trees, fields with cows slowly eating their grass, a few farms. He knows he’s way above the speed limit, but right now he can’t really find himself to care much about it.
He’s not so sure about this time, though. Even as he’s pushed back down on the bed and people are starting to shout and run all around him, it somehow feels as if his final seconds are ticking just by him. There’s no pain, though. Not right now. It comes, and then it goes, but it doesn’t stay. He just had a wave of it a few minutes ago, but he’s not sure how long he has before the next one comes.
During the first three contestants, Dean has had enough self-control to keep his eyes on his phone instead of the teens that are currently performing. There's some applause from the crowd, but mostly it's the families that are the most enthusiastic. He tries not to listen when the points are being called out.
“Don’t worry, babe, you’re doing great, I’m sure of it,” Dean assures him, and Cas just lets out a groan.
“I think we broke him,” Jimmy instead says. Dean sits down next to Castiel, and then takes his hands into his own.
A crazy thought passes through his head, but he shakes it off right away. If Inias were Wind, he still wouldn’t have known Castiel is Jimmy, right? Unless he’s really that easy to figure out. To be fair, Castiel hasn’t been doing much effort in keeping his identity hidden, except for withholding the fact that he’s adopted. He figured long ago that that would just be too large of a revelation.
But he could also call them after Bobby. Robert? Is there a female variation for that? Or even after Ellen and Jo; they saved their life once, too. Jonah or Alan; that comes close, right?
He doesn’t look up, but he’s aware of the Horseman that has joined them in the room. The last time Castiel has seen him, he had been under the possession of endless souls and he was close to be killed by him.
“Sam Winchester! How nice of you to show up!” The Hipster demon says, clearly still unaffected by the exorcism broadcasted in Claire’s hand. All around her, the demons already start falling on their knees as they try to shield their ears away from the spoken words. The room is quickly filled with cries of agony.
“Thanks Cas,” Dean says. Then he climbs on the top bunk to put up the other part, finally revealing the poster of the first Star Wars movie. Castiel gives it a long look before shaking his head taking a deep breath.
“Excuse me? My husband lies there half-dead on the floor and all you can do is sigh?” Dean bites at him. Sam just holds up his hand in an apology.
The event starts at four thirty, meaning that Dean still has about three more hours to find the place. He’s been on the search for more than two hours now, and the urge to just book a cab and pay for it gets stronger by the minute. That means a lot since his memory of the ugly green Volkswagen yesterday wasn’t really the best one. The driver had been friendly enough, but when even Dean doesn’t feel safe in a car, it means something.
“They got sick during the pregnancy, might have suffered some weight loss, but they survived and recovered within days after the birth,” Metatron explains. Lauren nods. Sam lets out a relieved sigh. At least this means that Dean isn’t going to face a certain death at the end of this tunnel.
Dean bites his lip, feeling that the best thing right now is not to say anything. He turns his head to the side and stares out of the window, seeing that it’s raining.
“What’s going on?” Dean asks, realizing immediately that something happened. Cas turns around, face looking pale and shocked. “Babe?”
“The cure didn’t work, you idiot,” Dean retorts, casting one more look at Cas, who has fished out another bottle and downs it in one more go. Dean frowns, noticing how exasperated Cas looks as he drinks down the water. “Wait a minute.”
“God wants me dead, it’s out of my power,” Dean mutters out with a shrug. His eyes find Castiel for a moment, but his expression stays grim.
much longer to realize. With Sam, he’d been on a hunt, trying to find a monster that kidnapped four people in the last week. Dean remembers calling Cas shortly before going to bed, and then he just woke up here.
Castiel frowns again, not really wanting to give Metatron the satisfaction of giving him an answer. He doesn’t want to play along with his childish games, so he keeps his lips sealed tightly.
“I didn’t want sex with him,” Cas explains as if it wasn’t that big of a deal. Then he sighs again and moves his head around to stretch his neck. “I don’t feel sexual attraction, at least not easily. And I told him that when we started it, but when after a year I still didn’t feel anything, he got tired of waiting.”
“Claire, what happened to your dad… I’m sorry, okay? I really am,” Dean starts. He stops walking at last and turns towards her. “But there’s something you gotta know.”
Other than that I wish you all a Merry Christmas! It's insane how last year I was posting the final chapter of Being A Stark, and now there's already 4 finished stories in that verse!
A loud sigh escapes from Lauren’s lips when she receives the text from Sam that confirms that Dean is with them. It’s a major weight lifted off her shoulders knowing now that her friend is safe with them. Sam’s message had been short, though, so Lauren figures that he’s busy.
“C’mon, C, you won’t find him in here,” Sam jokes. Castiel groans but listens as he puts his feet out of the car. There’s a short walk to the carnival, which is filled with many people eating some cotton candy or corn dogs. There’s places where people shoot at ranges, places where kids can fish for ducks, and even a lot of food stalls or ice cream vendors.
Castiel turns to look back at Bobby for a moment, but now he can’t help but smile. The older man smiles back and squeezes his shoulder in reassurance.
Dorothy drops them off at their house, or at least as close as they can be while it’s still on her route. While she passed Sam’s and Castiel’s house without trouble, Jessica’s street isn’t at all near her house.
Once Dean is seated, another plate is pushed in front of him, and where he’d expected eggs, instead he finds two rashers of grilled bacon with grilled tomato on a slice of what seems like toast. It’s kind of weird for a breakfast, and it’s probably not enough for his hunger. Before he can manage to ask for anything to drink, a glass of apple juice is pushed in front of him. Surprisingly, Dean’s stomach isn’t turning around at the smell of the bacon.
Eventually, Charles returns while holding a glass of water. He hands it towards Castiel before handing him a plate with some cake as well.
“Yeah, mom… she loved helping out the boys,” Robin says, looking at Sam for a moment. “I guess that’s why I kept giving lessons after she passed.”
With just a soft promise against his ear, Azrael puts Kokabiel to sleep, and after that she’s off, leaving the safe space of Heaven again for the first time in thousands of years.
to know really, either. Dean hides his hands in the pocket of his pants, and looks down to the ground.
“I guess Jess’ll just have to sit on Sam’s lap,” Dean says as he passes them by with a playful smirk. Then he throws a quick wink at his brother, who storms up at him to slap him on the arm. As the two Winchesters start their usual bickering, the others start rolling their eyes.
“Cosplays always get a bit ruined at the end,” she points out. “But this is good stuff. This is the shit they use in movies. Remember Guardians of the Galaxy?”
“Dean, would you calm down please?” Castiel says from where he’s sitting, reading a magazine about the latest news in Missouri Valley. He doesn’t remove his eyes from the paper, though, which is probably why Dean shoots him an annoyed glare.
“Enough,” Sam breathes out, tired of talking. He knows he won’t be able to make Gabriel see that he has a plan. Not without revealing it to Rowena, and if he would do that she would surely bail and refuse to cooperate any more. With a tired movement, Sam raises his hand towards the sigil on the wall behind him. His body turns away a bit, revealing the drawing. He can only just catch Gabriel’s surprised look before a loud noise comes up, followed by a big white light.
“Hell,” the man says to him, and Dean could roll his eyes at him. He doesn’t even have any idea what Hell really is like. Slowly, Castiel gets him back up so that everybody is standing. Dean leans against the ladder, not steady on his feet yet. He looks around the room, trying to take in the place they’ve been thrown in.
“Last year, did my first serious competition. Didn’t win anything, but I didn’t end up too badly, either,” he says. Castiel recalls very well the happiness Dean had showed when he still ended up in the top ten. “And anyway, in came Castiel in a very bad mood. I started to ask him what happened with Amelia, and what became of the proposal. That’s how he learned about his brother plans, and I realized I had just met Jimmy’s twin brother.”
When his eyes meet Cas’ again, he gives him a light smile. Cas does the same, and Dean wishes for nothing more than to just reach out for him and hold on to him.
“Sir, we need to perform an emergency surgery, you need to leave the room,” one of the nurses says, but Castiel doesn’t know who. He tries to push away from them, but he wouldn’t succeed in it without hurting them. So, after a little while of struggling, he stops, giving Dean one last glance before letting himself being led out of the room.
“I’m just glad you’re here,” Dean says. He wiggles his nose a little bit, clearly uneasy with the oxygen-mask they’ve given him. Castiel smiles again through his tears. Then he leans forward and presses a small kiss on his lips, feeling Dean return it only softly.
Sam takes a moment to analyze what the girl said. Free will and Prophecy’s? This all sounds too much like business coming straight out of Heaven. Or at least the Heaven from a few years ago. He puts together the details to come to his conclusion.
Castiel then nods, making his way to get out of the car before Dean stops him again. He clears his throat and looks pointedly at Cas.
“You’ve been living on Tumblr for so long I fear you have just become it,” Dorothy jokes. Everybody laughs, including Charlie.
Cas helps him with it. They take off the bra – and Dean is glad that’s the last time he’ll ever have to wear that – and then they put the robe on. After removing Dean’s sweatpants, they wait with the underwear. Dean is not yet ready to lie back down.
“Hell yes,” he tells him. Castiel decides that Claire and Dean are little bit too much alike when it comes to this subject, so he just lets it go for now. Surely, he might get a better answer from Sam. “All right, so spill. What’s with the family reunion?”
here. Now, before I completely erase your mind, let me explain something to you. Yes, Dean Winchester is pregnant. Yes, Heaven still thinks Nephilim are abominations. No, father did not bring us back to get rid of it, but rather to make sure it’ll live until its twentieth birthday.”
“I think I’m going to keep looking,” Cas tells him gently. “I really need to know, Dean. I know you don’t understand, but it’s just something I have to do.”
“I would have declared you crazy had you told me the truth,” Lauren confesses. Sam can understand that. He never told Jessica the truth, or Amelia. But then again, maybe it’s good that Lauren knows. His previous method doesn’t seem to be working, anyway.
He re-reads his e-mail three times when he’s under the covers, constantly wondering if he didn’t just try something hopeless. Maybe Charlie was wrong, and maybe this guy didn’t want to have somebody to talk to. Maybe, that e-mail was added there without him wanting to. Maybe it was an accident. After all, anybody who
Dean shoots his husband a look of concern. He just doesn’t know what he can say to him; Cas lost his wings – permanently. He’ll age, he’ll get sick (even more than before), and eventually, he will die. Then the question will be; did Death give Cas a soul when he removed his Grace, or is Cas walking around soulless like Sam did? Probably not, right? Since Cas sleeps and eats like any normal person.
“Uh-huh, excuse me,” Dean mutters at him, leaving the official business over to Sam who gets right to it. Dean and Castiel both walk over to the two men, standing weirdly on the counter, trying to get the body on film. Without really thinking about it, Dean slaps Harry on his ass, causing the man to jump up in surprise. Cas looks at him angrily, but Dean just shrugs.
“I suppose that’s the best I can ask for in this situation.” He smiled and left the daisies on the counter. “Enjoy the flowers and I hope you feel better soon.”
“I’m thinking about checking in with some publishing companies, see what they’ve got. Probably will get stuck in slush piles, but it’s something. I’m not really into the idea of working at another bookstore.”
Dean laid down on his bed, phone pressed to his ear, and listened to his brother. Quiet, repetitive, comforting. He let the fall and rise of Sam’s tone lull him into a peaceful state, far from the rush and stress of his day.
The apartment was smaller, similar in affluence, but his own. He had picked the last apartment under the careful eye of his mother and while it was nice, it never felt like home.
ImpalaGuy: Well now I’m curious. If your largest fashion decision was a trench coat what else can I expect from you?
Son of a bitch. Charlie shook his hand. “And you too. It must be nice to have such a success to end the new year.”
ImpalaGuy: I dunno, I don’t go to the park often to look for attractive strangers with golden retrievers
Dean yawned as he walked through the bedroom doorway towards his computer desk. He could smell coffee from the kitchen, but there was no sign of Charlie. Either she was late coming in or she had already left for the day. More likely the former than the latter. He booted up his computer and padded into the kitchen. The sun’s rays blinked through the kitchen curtains and a steady breeze blew leaves and debris down the sidewalk. Dean poured his coffee and took a deep breath. Blessed be the automatic coffee maker.
Charlie came back and handed Kevin a large glass. “Trust me, Dean will get you right as rain. There’s a big, greasy breakfast in your future. New drinkers, never know where your limit is yet. You’re up Bobby and Krissy.” She turned towards Dean. “You and Sam wanna get in?”
"Hello Dean." Cas tries to see if he can pick up the song from the beat, but it's not anything he recognizes from Dean's cassette collection. "New music?"
“No. Well, technically yes. I said so much after that about building a community and creating spaces for engaging in literature. And it’s all gone.” He set off the treadmill and sped walk.
, Indy, those bad monster flicks from the 50’s. I've got so many VHS tapes they fight for room on my shelf with my books. There's just something about forgetting your life for about two hours and getting to live someone else's adventure that's exciting. Please tell me you've watched something I have, so we can talk about it. My roommate and brother have put up with a lot of discussions and I'm sure they’d love if if I'd share with someone else.
“Okay,” she pulled out a pack and lit a cigarette. “I thought you were bi, Cas. There’s a big difference between the two.”
“You do realize you can seperate the two parts of you: the business dick and the guy who isn’t a dick. Keep business guy around for all those deals and the other guy for your personal life.”
I don’t have a good excuse, nor one I can give you. Understand that it’s no reflection on you, but me. I wish I had been there with you. Difficult people can be hard to deal with, but that’s the problem with witty comebacks: they often hurt the inflictor more than the target. At least in the case when I do it and now, when you do it. Maybe it just means we’re more empathetic, but if we truly were we’d probably not employ them in the first place.
She snorted and rolled her eyes. “I told you: from the inside. Now, let’s get some of that caviar. There are only two pluses to these events: expensive food and schmoozing people. I want to be stuffed full of food I can’t normally buy and have more leverage coming my way by the end of the night.” She stepped close forward and bumped into a woman. “Sorry — oh hi, April.”
He sat down and loaded AOL, the accompanying voice-over played while he took his first sip. Page loaded, he browsed his inbox and found what he was looking for — a message from NYC418. Dean smiled and clicked.
NYC418: I’d nudged you away before I come so I could wrap our cocks together and jack us off quick and dirty
Charlie pulled her hair up in a ponytail and took over the register from Krissy with a tap on her shoulder. Krissy wiggled through the after school patrons towards Dean. She snatched the paper from him and scanned. “This is good. Plus, we’ve got the picketing Saturday, so this is going to be great exposure for us this week.”
The bell chimed and Krissy blustered over the threshold. “You would not believe what I just saw. Milton Books,
There’s really no excuse for why I didn’t show up last night. I saw you through the window and panicked. I couldn’t tell you I was the person you were looking for, especially when I know you don’t like me.
“Wait for me, you idiot.” Meg’s footsteps slapped beside him. “So they cut your interview down. It’s expected. They can’t make the big, scary, corporate guy look good next to the cute, small business owner. Who runs a
right now. Good to know. If you two could excuse us, we need to talk. I hear if you go into the kitchen you can pull the wishbone.” The kids ran off and he handed him a glass of wine. “You’re probably gonna want this.”
Dean’s keys clinked together as he unlocked the roll cage to his shop. It rattled as he pushed it up to open the main door. The bell chimed as he stepped inside.
“Yes, well there’s a difference between an occasional dick and consistently and continuously a dick. The new year has brought many epiphanies.”
A loud bang on the door. Krissy rushed from the counter. “I’m coming, Christ on a cracker.” She opened the door and Bobby lurched in, a small tree in tow. “It’s so small.”
She peeked in and waved at Krissy and Kevin. “Looks like you got a full house. I wasn’t even sure if you’d still be here or not. I called Charlie and she said you’d be here.”
“I’ve already told Bobby. I’ll be telling Krissy and Kevin after the holidays. I stopped putting in orders last week, so what we’ve got and the few shipments I have left will be it. I’ll announce to the public after the new year.” A tear fell on his hand. “God, I didn’t think I’d cry.”
, I did fight back would either of you help me or would I just be the crazy man yelling at the Milton Books down the block.”
each other.” She kissed his cheek. “Not that I haven’t loved what we’ve done, but it’s been six months Cas. Isn’t it about time we speed things up?”
Damn, that’s a downer. But, you’re better now (right?) and that’s what matters. Sucks the sales associate thought you were only in for your wife. There’s a little yarn shop not too far from where I live and at this point they all know me. And they’ve been super patient with my questions. Who knows, maybe you’ll warm up to them in no time.
“If you need any help let me know. I won’t be able to do much out here, but I’ll be coming in for the holidays if you need help then. And you can always call me if you need to unload. I’ve got your back.”
The mom and sales associate walked towards another bookshelf and left Dean alone. He wouldn’t get to do that anymore. Sometimes it was frustrating, especially when the parents swore on their lives hand to God they were right. But everything was worth it to see the kids get excited about reading. And they still would here, hopefully.
“Some. Mom let me put up decorations in my room and in our hallway. Not in the sitting room or public hallways where guests can see.”
In a flash Dean’s got the alpha in a head-lock and tosses his ass out the door. He locks the door and watches the alpha stumble to stand up. “Go the fuck home, man, or I will call the cops on your ass.”
“That’s an understatement.” He drank half his juice. “Here’s the thing. That whole ‘it’s not personal, it’s business’ bullshit is exactly that: bullshit. Because it might not be personal to you Mr. Top of the Chain, but it is to people like me. To my employees. We all got dicked over by your store and no witty phrase is gonna bring it back.” He set his glass down too fast, juice lept to the edges, one drop dribbled down the side. “So, here I am, not sure why you even want to be here.”
You wouldn’t happen to have any cookie recipes that you know work? I’ve tried a couple already and they haven’t worked. Before you make the joke: I’m sure some “user error” is at play. However, I’m tired of hearing the smoke alarm go off and I’m sure my neighbors would appreciate any help you can lend me.
“I’m,” He cleared his throat, “I’m not coming in.” He turned his head and coughed. “I don’t feel good, so I’m taking a sick day. I’m sorry for the late call and the inconvenience, but I just woke up.”
The dining room was warm, candles lit, table heavy. Jack grabbed the edge of his blazer. “I got the wishbone!”
He stepped into the grocery store and calmed. Paper turkeys hung from the ceiling and hurried customers sped past. So close to Thanksgiving, it’s a wonder he had not been shoved where he stood. He grabbed a basket and walked close to the edges. Mothers strode past, kids trailed behind or shrieked from the children’s seat.
“Well, I’m glad because there was one reason I waited to tell you. I put in a job offer here and I got accepted. I’ll be starting in January.”
“Yeah, but you won’t be moving furniture with anyone any time soon.” Gabe waggled his eyebrows. “If you want me to set you up, just let me know.”
He shrugged. “The general public doesn’t seem that interested in the lives of mega bookstore executives. They’re more interested in the discounts.”
ImpalaGuy: i’d probably move down so i could blow you, trail kisses from your neck down to your cock
“Not for nothing Cas, but that’s wishful thinking. Too many alphas still think a pretty scent is enough of a ‘yes.’” Dean scratches at his wrist. “I keep thinking about those kids. That was me and Sam, you know? Dad’d have us go down to the laundromat while he was at work on the weekends. Just me and Sammy, couple of vending machine sandwiches and comics while the machines ran. It’s why I’m so comfy here. Places like these were my second home.” Dean drums his fingers on the counter.
“Around the corner, Char.” He finished his thought and hit send.  He spun around in his chair to face Charlie as she turned the corner. Hair ruffled and scarf thrown over her shoulders, she flopped onto the couch. “And where were you last night? I thought you had a meeting with your copy editor this morning?”
I packed up what I would need in the short term and left with Honey. We’re fine, if you’re worried (and not too bad off as I’m able to get in contact with you.) I’ll have to go back to my apartment eventually, but I don’t want to right now. It’s going to be a mess to sort out my belongings and find a more permanent place to live then where I’m at now.
NYC418: It’s your decision to make. Do they have group therapy? Maybe that will help you make your choice.
I can’t believe all of you. I bought needles and yarn and now I’ve got a lumpy dishcloth. Not gonna lie, it feels weird as hell to knit. Can’t get the image of little old ladies out of my head. And those needles are slippery little fuckers. My book says that if I can manage the dishcloth I can make a scarf, which isn’t too wild it’s like a longer dishcloth, but it took so long to make the dishcloth. How do people make those sweaters?
“I’m working on it. Once I’ve got everything figured out, you’ll be the first to know. Should be able to give you the answer in a week or so. Just enjoy tonight.” He brushed crumbs off his face. “This is my favorite tradition.”
“He’s human! Take it easy and if you need to call out again tomorrow, do it. I’ll e-mail you the notes and we can get together to go over it. If any of the other execs want to see you they can schedule their own damn meeting. I’m not the secretary and I’ll put my foot down on that.”
God these two.”Yeah.I went in the over thirty chat room and we struck up a conversation. It was the end of January, Charlie was out with her DnD group, and I was lonely.” He paused. “Which, looking back, should’ve also been a sign. But he’s pretty cool, so we just kept talking.”
“It sounds nice, but I didn’t know you’d already made the decision of where we’d go for the holidays.”
“Once Claire gets back, hopefully. She’s at that stage where she devours everything she reads.” The man pulled the book from Jack’s hands and placed it on the counter. “I hope she never outgrows it.”
Dean gripped his plate. Here stands the guy who has put him through so much stress and anxiety, a juxtaposition of ‘Corporate Asshole’ and ‘Good with Kids’. “You can’t recreate that kind of experience in your superstores. They’re impersonal and void of care.”
“Um.” It wasn’t his place, but it would at least solve the mom’s problem. “I think the book you’re looking for is
Dean grabbed the paper from her and glanced over it. An op-ed, so no interview  — thank God — but he liked it. Cassie did ask him a few questions and spent some time observing the store. A skim through the article showed it and it made his stomach knot in nervousness, but also appreciation: the love he put into the store sparked off the page.  “Thanks. But shouldn’t you be at work? Nine to five and all that?”
“You’ll be at family Christmas, right Cas?” Claire held her hands out and took the clean dish from Castiel to dry.
She wasn’t wrong. It wouldn’t be so bad. “Yeah, I could do that. But I do need to find something soon. I don’t want to run into my savings.”
“It okay, there’s plenty to do while we wait for you to get hungry.” She stalked towards him and undid his tie. “After all, don’t you have coffee with dessert?”
I might have been too eager saying I loved New York in the fall. I do, but I think the holiday season is just as good (dare I say better). Perhaps, because it feels like we culturally put on rose colored glasses and put aside differences for about two months before tearing into each other again. That’s cynical and probably most directly influenced by my family, but the air of coziness and camradire the holidays bring about is entirely worth it. It’s also the only time of the year any home cooked meal makes its way into my home. I can’t say I’m the cook — and my baking is worse — but after takeout and restaurants the rest of the year, it’s nice to stay in and eat. Currently, my fridge has last night’s Thai and ketchup. Honey, however, is content the entire year until the holidays. Too much stimulation probably, but she’s a hyperactive mess. I love her dearly, but barking at four in the morning is terrible.
She laughed and sat the bowl down. She grabbed his hands and kissed him. “No, you had a very successful first week for your new superstore and I just landed a great new author. Luck just seems to be coming our way.”
“Ugh.” He dropped his head against the cool window. It had been two weeks since their New Year’s tryst. He was never going to let Meg and Gabe take him out again. Was this even a good idea? He was still involved with April, right?. He shouldn’t even be here. This was too much, too soon. He should have never even agreed to have sex in the first place. Even if things went well today,
Castiel crossed his arms. “Cookies. I asked the kids if they wanted to come over. They’re in the oven right now.”
It was his Mom’s — soft curtains and polished hardwood floors, walls packed tight with the latest bestsellers and classics: all different sizes, shapes, and colors. The window displays were themed for the beginning of the school year: apples, pencils, a bespectacled bookworm plush, a small schoolhouse which propped up Clifford and Beverly Cleary. The store lived and breathed Mary Winchester — just the way Dean liked it.
The boat was one of the most awkward things Castiel had the displeasure of owning. After his graduation, his parents decided a big splashy gift was in order and bought him a boat to sit at the docks next to the family boat. He rarely went out on it, but the kids loved it and he would do anything for them.
“I’m not. Back then I was a total jackass. I’m sure it was a major disappointment to have me show up when the person you wanted to show up didn’t?” Wait, did Dean tell him that. “Well, they at least didn’t show up while I was there or you would have made sure I’d left.”
Dean sat his water glass down and breathed. It wouldn’t help if he chased the guy and punched him in the face. Well, it would help the way he felt, but not his reputation for sure. This was a room of industry people, there was no room for public petty revenge. Private petty revenge could be arranged, but it would look terrible if what he did ever came to light, especially as a children’s bookstore owner. In. Out. In. Out. Maybe he should have waited until next week to start his meds, but he knew if he put it off any longer he wasn’t going to do it and then Charlie would be disappointed. Understanding, but disappointed.
Dean sat down and played with the petals on the flowers. “I’m thinking about it.” He turned to Bobby. “What would Mom do?”
Castiel sighed. “Yes, well so is Mother. She’s decided that monthly calls are important, especially now that I’ve gotten serious about marriage and the family I have long denied her.”
Gabe teased the bottle wrapper. “Why don’t you tell him you’re NYC418? What’s stopping you? You’re friends, right, so it shouldn’t be an issue. Not like when you were still at each other throats.”
“Are you going to eat all night?” Charlie slipped her arm around his and snatched a pig in a blanket from his plate. “You’ve got to at least talk to someone. We can make the circuit then get you out of here.”
“No.” He dropped the pen and leaned forward. “Your Mama wouldn’t be her sitting on her ass resigned herself to already losing her store. She’d be making plans on how to draw folks in while still providing the service she built her business. She wouldn’t even entertain the idea she would be losing her store.” He dropped his shoulders and leaned back. “I know it’s hurt losing your Mama, but she knew exactly what she was doing leaving this store with you. You’ve got the drive and fire. Don’t let this Milton Books bullshit drag you down. When it gets down to the dregs, then we panic. Until then, it’s business as usual.”
Cas laughed. “How about something lighter. Do you like pie? Because I hear the pie here is fantastic.”
“Doesn’t mean I don’t want to know what’s going on in your life. There’s always going to be room in my life for you.”
Job. I run a business and I’m not sure if my next move will be the best. Other people will be affected by my decision. I was confident before, but now I’m afraid that the people around me are biased, you know? Got any sage words of wisdom to share?
I get it about holidays. I’m a family guy, so I can’t get too cynical. You know those images of the family around the fire and everyone looks happy? That’s my family for the most part. Sure we can fight or whatever, but mostly we’re kidding around. My little brother and I have been rough housing for years. It just looks worse when you’re both over 6’. I’m glad you’re getting some home cooked meals. I don’t think it’s terrible you don’t have them throughout the year — some of us are busy and I’m sure you’re one of them — but there’s something about home cooked meals during the holidays that feels required. My oven and stove top are gonna have a work out in the next two months, but it’s gonna be so good. (And it will not end with a New Year’s resolution to lose weight. NY resolutions never work. Everyone puts in effort for about the first month and then they drop it. And the ads for it are so annoying. Yes, I know it’s a new year, but I’d rather make a new me in March so I can come out of hibernation like bears). I wish I could send some cookies your way. Or brownies. Fudge, mmm. I might need to go make a shopping list.
Bobby sat the pastry box down and took the ornament Kevin held out to him. “She’s a smooth talker. Might be good to chip-in her offer.”
“The kind of person who would hire kids and come spy on my shop so you can close us faster.” He stole the spoon back and set it on the serving plate. “And that is a garnish.”
He dropped the phone in his lap and nuzzled Honey close. The background buzzed with the sizzle of vegetables in a pan and the clank of metal on metal. Light piano tinkled into the commercials and flipped to upbeat pop for a car company.
“This looks great, Castiel.” His father walked down the stairs back to the main floor, his current wife on his arm. “I couldn’t be more proud.”
He slipped out of his bedroom and guided Honey along. He clipped her leash on and threw on a coat. He would come back later for his things.
That was cryptic. He picked up his book and balanced his plate on his lap. Tonight was a disappointment, at least for his social life. Where was NYC418?
April sighed and squeezed back. “You’re right, that we don’t really know each other. Just, don’t give up before you’ve given it your all, okay?”
He hooked the lights in the top corners and trailed remains down the edges. Krissy waved at him through the window and hurried inside, a swirl of chill and flurries behind her. “I always forget how cold the first snow is.” She scurried to the counter and sat down the goodies: coffee, hot chocolate, muffins, and cookies.
he’s been telling everything he’ll end our friendship. And I don’t want that to happen. I like his companionship.”
Claire raises an eyebrow. “I dunno, what about all the eye-fucking? I swear the only reason Bobby puts you both down on the same shift is because he’s secretly a softie.”
Cut to his interview. “Milton Books is here to provide discount books in a wide range of genres for a wide range of ages.”
Shrimp and pasta in creamy alfredo sauce, a basket of covered bread, a bottle of wine breathing on the table. Castiel frowned. “What’s all this?”
Dean grabbed Honey’s leash and bumped shoulders with Cas. He smiled and pecked Dean on the cheek. This, he could get used to.
Now he sat on the floor, the last of the items that needed to be packed around him. The radio dim in the background. The bookshelves would be picked up and hauled off to another store. Bobby promised to come by the next day to help him transfer the store sign to his apartment.
shop to be honest, but his mom’s. He could talk with other business owners or schmooze with people in children’s publishing, but being in charge of the day to the day operations still felt like he was taking over for his mom while she rested.
“Bobby is a softie, but that doesn’t mean he’s trying to secretly hook me and Dean up. It just means that he’ll call me or Dean up first if he’s got extra hours. He knows we both could use the money.”
He had his work colleagues - Meg would never forgive him if he didn’t include her - but he maintained relatively professional relationships with them. Except Meg, but he never had her over to his apartment and they always met in public spaces. One memorable night they ended up at her apartment, too trashed to even remember Castiel’s address, but he never went over again. His online friendship with ImpalaGuy was easier and no doubt one of the closest relationships he had outside of his family. Which was the crux of his problem.
. They’ll be loud and impersonal and after all of the brouhaha has died down people will come back to where they’ve always been: here, with us, providing quiet refuge from the city and service with personality.”
Dean side eyed him. “I’m not that picky about my pie.” He used his fork to point towards Cas’s slice. “Though I’m not sure about yours. Coconut’s pretty sweet.”
Dean’s squared off in front of a tall alpha man, a high school-aged boy is off to the side holding a younger kid. The stench of alpha in near rut is putrid. “Get out of here, this is a place of goddamn business.”
The heavy scent of Alpha rut and Omega heat is familiar in the Mating Washroom. Cas unpacks the new arrival and pulls out a bedding set: duvet, sheets, pillows, throw. And a pair of heat briefs. He sighs and tosses them in the “Undergarments” bin.
I’m glad to help you with Christmas traditions. Every family has their own thing, so you don’t have to make Christmas cookies. You could always make something else. Me, I’m a pie guy. I always make sure there’s variety for our holiday spreads. I think it’s great you’re getting the kiddos in the kitchen. They should be fine with rolling and cutting if they’re past the toddler stage. If you want the shapes to actually stay the shape you won’t want sugar cookies, but a more stiff cookie. I’ve got both kinds attached if you want to decide. I hope Honey likes the recipe. I’ll admit, I don’t have a dog, so I don’t know if these are any good. I passed the recipe on to my brother for his dog, but I didn’t hear any complaints from either of them, so I’d say they were good.
“More than likely. Mother refuses to admit it as she doesn’t want to have to go through the humiliation of another divorce. The first one made her look like a corporate trailblazer. The second will make everything she can’t keep a man.”
What’s up with Leap Year? I get it serves a purpose, but it catches you off guard, you know? Within the first two months of the new year when you’re still putting the old year on your checks — bam! An extra day that only comes every four years.  Everyone’s thrown off. At least with things like elections and the Olympics, they’re special events. We put time out of our schedule to participate. But no, leap day is not opt-in. We’ve all got to get through it. If there was some fanfare, I could get behind it, but it’s just a normal day. Waste of an extra day if you ask me.
He nudged her back onto her feet and walked off to begin observation. “I’m sure the piano that almost fell on you also feels like it’s had a terrible day, however, we are paid to get this store up and running, not falling over in our Milanos.”
“She went back home this year. We’re gonna spend New Year’s together.” Charlie squeezed into the armchair with Sam and stole a pinch of his cake. “It’s gonna be great. We’re getting the whole group together for a D and D sesh.”
The elevator doors pinged open and they lurched inside. He pressed his floor button and leaned against the back wall. April was cradled between his shoulder, arm, and the corner of the elevator. “I can’t wait until we have sex. Normally I don’t wait this long, but I have for you. You should feel special. God, I’ve bought three new vibrators because of you.”
“Of course.” He burrowed back under the covers and Honey whimpered from the floor. His stomach gurgled. The moon rose and he made sure his alarm was on before spreading out in the bed.
He pushed the boxes to the side, leaned the sign against the books. He stared out at the store for one long, final look. The pale yellow walls were marked with bright squares where poster used to hang. The dust clung to the corners of the shelves. The alcoves and cabinets behind the counter dreary without the plush and book displays. The floor a bit scuffed from so many pairs of shoes and from when the tables and chairs were shoved to make room during story time.
“I think I know just the book you’re looking for.” He scanned the bookshelf and pulled three books out. “It’s the Enchanted Forest Chronicles. The first book,
“We’ll get you in ship shape. I won’t say in no time, because it’s gonna take a lot of time. Hope you’re ready for the long haul, kid.”
Dean swallowed. “Yeah, I do.” He put the last book in the bag and glanced up at the register’s screen. “Fifty-seven twenty-three.”
“Castiel? What’s that smell?” April slipped into the kitchen, heels in her hands. “Hey there, Claire.”
He settled down in a quiet room and picked through his food. Billie’s house was nice: warm colors, comfy furniture, bookshelves full. He fidgeted in the armchair and popped a pig in a blanket in his mouth. In a hotel ballroom he might have been fine. A nice dining hall or a rented out restaurant, those were easy to slip out unnoticed and wait in the car for Charlie. These intimate parties at the author’s house were not only weird, but hard to leave. Only one entrance and exit and he had to pass so many people to get there, all wondering ‘Where are you going?,’ ‘Why are you leaving so soon?,’ or ‘Where’s Celeste?’.  Charlie was the people person. Him, well, a while ago maybe, but lately not so much. Kids, though, had no expectations and judgements about the way you lived your life. Sure they could be judgey, but there was no air of superiority.
He cringed. “No thank you. I’d hate for you to get it. I know you’re so busy at work.” He cleared his throat. “Could you get me a glass of water before you leave?”
I miss our conversations. I thought I would be okay with out of them, but turns out — surprise — they’re actually a big part of my day. I needed a break, talked things out with my roommate and my brother. Yeah, they know about you, but they’re the only ones. And, ah, they know all of it. Gotta have some people looking out for me and turn me in the right direction. It’s stupid cause I think I love you. But I can’t tell them that, because they’ll say I shouldn’t be, that you’re just someone I met online and have no clue who you really are. Which is true, but it hurts. I’d like to think after all this time I would know you enough, and myself, to make a good judgement call. But, I, uh, haven’t always been good with relationships. Lots of breakups behind me. Sorry about that. I guess this is me trying to be vulnerable. I’m never gonna send this, but sometimes you just have to do things to get it off your chest, right? I hope you’re doing okay, that you and Honey are safe, and you’re taking care of yourself. I know you always tell me to take care of myself, but sometimes I wonder if anyone has ever told you.
“I’m just passing through, but I heard about your store. If there’s anything I can do, let me know. Signings, protests, riots, you know I can deliver.”
“You know, if after all this time it’s a woman and not a guy your night’s officially in the shitter.”
“The Shop Around the Corner, ah Mary Winchester. She had fire that one.” His father sighed. “You should of seen her when she was pissed. God, she could have scared the devil back to Hell. Doesn’t her son run it now?”
“You’re kidding me? You could use the extra set of hands here. I’ve got a couple sick days that I’ve got aside for non-sick emergencies. I can handle a register. Call it — research. This is a children’s bookstore, I work in children’s publishing. How am I supposed to find out the latest trends and what the public wants if I never interact with them?”
Cas leaned back in his seat and watched Dean. He hadn’t spoken since the waitress placed his slice of pie down and he started to devour it. “What do you think?”
Cas resoundly ignores her in favor of watching Dean explain the movie he watched with Sam last weekend.
He watched her before he deposited the glass in the sink. He entered his bedroom where Honey dashed around his legs. “Not right now, sweetheart. It’s been a long night.” He pulled out his suitcase and threw whatever he thought he might need inside. He couldn’t stay here. It might be his, but it would forever be tainted by the time he spent dragging April around in a loveless relationship. He’d need to put it up on the market.
“The nanny should be out front soon to drop the children off with you. Are you sure you want to spend the day with them. You can do a lot with a Saturday,” said his father.
“No. I should go. I should never have let it get this far.” He turned to walk away and Meg gripped his shoulders.
He sighed. “ I— I don’t know what to do. I don’t think there’s anyway I can talk to you without setting you off.”
Gabe turned towards Cas. “Dean? As in ‘Shop Around the Corner’ Dean? Have you too been keeping me out of the loop?”
“Dean, there you are. Are you okay?” Charlie sat on the arm and snuck a piece of turkey off his plate and into her mouth.
“No problem, kid.” He leaned against the countertop. The cookies did look good. He snagged a snickerdoodle and bit off half.
Hell yeah, I’ve got loads of cookie recipes. Anything specific? Baking’s my favorite part about the holidays, but it’s better when you’re doing it with other people. My mom used to make Christmas cookies with me and my brother. Now I make them with my roommate, though she mostly spends her time sneaking the dough and putting on sprinkles. Do you want a recipe for dog biscuits for Honey? I actually have one that she might like.
He stepped outside the door and the bell chimed, too cheery for the somber moment. He locked up and lowered the roll cage. It rattled into place and he locked it. The empty windows gaped towards the sidewalk. He turned and walked away. He shoved his hands into his pockets and trudged against the flow of traffic and the wind.
Castiel opened his desk drawer and pulled out a stack of take out menus. “I never know when I’ll be here or not. It seemed best not to let the food go to waste.”
“It’s why we’re fighting back so hard. So far, so good. I don’t know what kind of ideas Charlie is filling your head with, but we’re not getting crazy or anything. Just making waves, staking claims. “
Late evening, the door slammed open and Honey burst into his room to join him on the bed. “Babe, are you in here? Honey, can you tell me where Castiel is? Bark twice if you’re with him.”
“One, it’s cold. Two, coconut is a summer flavor. I don’t make the arbitrary food rules, I just follow them.” He took another bite of his apricot pie. “Goddamn this is good.”
“Gee, ever thought about getting those mommy issues sorted out? I’ve got a friend whose cousin’s daughter is a psychologist.”
Kevin sat the box down on a chair and opened it. “We’ve got decorations.” He pulled out a strand of tinsel garland and wrapped it around his neck like a feather boa. “Thank God. I was done looking in storage. Dean, how did you even get that much junk back there? It’s already pretty small.”
“They never did. It was a rough patch for us, but we’ve kept in touch sense then and,” he rubbed the back of his neck, “I’m supposed to meet up with them today.” He scooted himself away from the table. “Hell, I’m nervous and I don’t know what to do. We’ve known each other for so long I'm afraid I’m gonna build it up and I’ll be disappointed when we finally meet. Is that weird?”
“No, I’m an organizer. I promise after the lights are up I don’t care how you decorate. Take some of your final stress out on the tree.”
He can barely handle his parents, but he doesn’t know how he’s going to survive with both Raphael and Michael joining them as well.
And Castiel hadn’t known what to say to that, so he had said nothing, instead. They were both still standing exactly where Gail left them, both of them unable to move to anywhere else. Castiel had caught the blush on Dean’s face.
Dean sits up a little in surprise. Did he just hear that correctly? Is Cas suggesting to resurrect everybody? Even though their bodies burned to the ground in a hunter’s funeral?
Oh, Garth has no idea. But, he’s heard of Cas. Dean can remember talking about him to the hunter a while ago, only then it had been more talks about frustration rather than praise. Cas was gone back then, then he was crazy, then he was brainwashed. Yeah, no, Garth has never really heard anything positive on the Angel.
“Great, thanks!” Dean says, and he holds out his hand towards the teenage boy. Yàn returns the gesture, and as they shake both share a small smile. “You might have saved my future relationship.”
Father Dalma starts speaking again, explaining the importance of the rings. Castiel doesn’t listen, though, instead paying all his attention to Dean. Their hands are still holding on to each other. Dean’s eyes are still wet with tears.
“I’m doing fine,” Dean says. He picks the robe from the bed and gives it a long look, not seeming too impressed about it. It’s the typical white piece of cloth with blue figures on it, with buttons at the sleeves to help undo it easier. The back is open, and Dean promises himself that, the moment it is on, he’ll stay in bed rather than to have everybody stare at his bare ass.
“Oh Dean,” Cas mumbles out, and then there’s the first tear escaping from his eye. Dean wants to ask what’s wrong, if Cas is in pain. But then Cas answers the question for him. “You’re dying.”
“So what are your ideas?” Dean asks. Cas sighs and pulls out a piece of paper from the table, handing it to Dean. The hunter frowns for a moment, and then takes a look.
“Where is your mother?” he asks. And then the anger is back, quickly followed by a sigh. Her voice is still shaky while she talks.
So that’s when they agree to split up; Sam goes to protect Russel Wellington. Lauren and Charlie go back to the bunker and go on their search for any goods in there. Sam doesn’t seem exactly thrilled about having to protect this piece of crap, but it would be against his nature not to do it. His hand finds Lauren’s on the table for a few short seconds, and then before anybody can think better of it, he kisses her lightly on the lips and gets up from his seat. He shortly waves them goodbye before he’s out.
“Who are you calling?” Dean asks when he sees her going through his contacts, and when she holds up her hand for him to shut up, he frowns.
Emma has this habit to ask question after question, and Dean almost didn’t catch it. She says there’s no music? But there’s music everywhere. That’s the whole damn problem!
Thinking about it made him shiver, and when he was thinking straight again, he noticed that Castiel was looking at him in a questioning stare.
“Ah, the Doc just came for a visit. I just needed to get out for a bit afterwards,” Dean says, walking forward along with Cas, back to where Balthazar is standing. The Angel looks annoyed enough, but wisely keeps his mouth shut.
Lauren just smiles gently before nodding gently and walking away again. Before she can get too far, Dean hands her the bag filled with Claire’s clothes, and then he nods towards the hallway with one short look at Claire, who is just staring at them some sort of strange bewilderment.
“Of course, C, you can tell me anything,” she says in assurance. They stop in their tracks, and Castiel takes a shaky breath. His teeth are buried in his lower lip as he tries to think how he’s going to say this. Jessica stays quiet as he tries to speak, though her eyebrows go together as an indication that she’s starting to worry about what he’s going to tell her.
“Uh,” Claire starts, reaching for her bag on the nightstand and fishing out a little book from it. “When I was living with my grandmother, she used to send me postcards. This is the last one,” she says while opening the book and taking out a postcard right before handing it to Sam.
“Ah, well, I would love to reveal all those secrets to you, but my classes only stop around ten, so you’ll have to wait for a while,” Jimmy says with a troubled expression. “Also, I would have to let my girlfriend know that I would get back home a little later, but it’s always nice to make new friends!”
“No, God no, that’s not what I meant.” He stood up. “It’s been recently been pointed out to me I’m prone to putting my foot in my mouth.”
Cas leans against the wall and watches Dean light up under the attention. The sun and surf have done him good: his skin golden, hair windswept and streaked with highlights, and, if possible, even more freckles trail his face and arms.
She rolled her eyes and turned towards the shelves. The phone behind the counter rang. “I got it.” He dashed behind and picked up on the third ring. “Shop Around the Corner, Dean speaking.”
“Is that what you’re going to focus on? Look, they’re still building. It’s going to take a couple of months before they open. We have the upper hand.”
He glared. “At this point, tolerate is what I can expect. I don’t think they’ll approve of anyone else I would choose.”
“Castiel,” she whispered in his ear, breath warm. She slipped her hand inside his suit jacket and she teased the buttons on his shirt. “We’re not that far away from our one-year anniversary. Do you have an surprises in store for me?”
“But, you’ve been hanging out with the guy for months, surely you’ve dropped a phrase or a hint or something.” Meg walked over to the fridge and pulled out three beers. “Said something only NYC418 would know? I can’t believe you haven’t spilled the beans.”
He groped his pillow closer to him and covered his face. Steps edged closer and April dropped onto the bed. “How long have you been home? I didn’t think I came back so late you’d already gone to bed.” She pulled the pillow off his face and he covered himself with his arms. “Did your day not go well?”
April trailed her fingers over Castiel’s shoulders as she walked past. “Good morning.” The scent of her shampoo lingered as she left for the kitchen. Castiel logged on to AOL and clicked on the new message in his inbox.
He flashed the cover of his book out towards the cafe floor. Maybe NYC418 couldn’t see it and didn’t want to come up to him in fear he would be the wrong person. Just another lonely person taking solace in a cafe where you could be around people without interacting with them. Maybe he got caught up in something and was late. He should have taken Charlie’s offer for her to accompany him. She worried that he’d get mugged or murdered. Fair, he only had months and months of conversations to backup the kind of person he thought NYC418 was. But he didn’t want his pseudo sister to crash his date, but she would’ve been good company. (God date, it wasn’t a date it was two internet people who had sex meeting up in real life.) He almost conceded that he’d let her come if she sat out of the way, but decided it would be too much hassle. He did agree he would check in with her so she knew everything was okay, or consequently wrong.
April giggled and leaned into him, dragging her hand down his chest. “That was such a good show. And I’m so glad we caught up with your brother afterwards. He sure know how to pour a heavy Manhattan.”
Dean scanned the shop floor. Books back on shelves, some scattered on the kid’s sized tables. The reading corner with the colorful rug and comfy pillows. Most importantly behind him, the small picture of his mom watching the daily operations. “I think I’ll fight.”
“Of course not! I’ve got plenty of room for all my girls!” she says, still laughing. Dean watches fondly as Kaia and Claire attempt to pull Patience and Alex into Donna’s lap, too.
He remembers years earlier, on his knees before Castiel, face bloody from Castiel’s fists, Castiel’s angel blade raised and ready to kill. Dean remembers telling Castiel he needed him, remembers how certainly he had known that he loved Castiel, how much he had wanted to say it but didn’t have the courage. Dean wishes bitterly he had found the courage when Castiel was still alive, when he could still do something about it. Dean draws a shaky breath and finally says it:
Dean stared out across the apartment, at the stack of boxes, knitting projects. The vase that held Cas’s flowers. “I’m not sure.”
Cas pawed around the countertop for the box cutter. It had to be somewhere. His fingers brushed against metal and it skittered across the counter top. There it was. He pulled it down and opened up two more boxes. Bath supplies and more books. He sighed. He knew he should have labeled them, but he didn’t have a Sharpie and now he was never going to find his kitchenware. Good thing pizza comes in a box and can be eaten with your hands.
She dropped her head into her hands, elbows on the table. “You couldn’t possible dream of it. Your the sweetest guy I’ve ever dated.”
The door squeaks open and Dean pushes his way through—basket in hand and Walkman at his side in his pocket. He rocks his head and drums a heavy beat against the thick, plastic basket handles. "Hey Cas."
He sighed. He’d been thinking about it too and only came to one conclusion. And he wasn’t sure what to do with it. “We’ve told each other things in our message I don’t think Dean would ever say to anyone outside of his family. In some cases, I don’t even know if his family knows. Sometimes it’s just easier to tell a stranger, you know? And I’m afraid if Dean knows it’s
He pet Honey most of the morning, resigned to the couch. After noon, he ventured back to his room and collapsed under the covers. He dozed through the afternoon, snatches of light from the window pierced his sleep sporadically.
“Might want to look into that again. Just a thought.” He patted his back and stepped away. “Dinner’s probably ready.”
Bobby stuck his head out the office door. “Don’t mind me, the guy doing the math who could give you an answer.”
“Ha! Proves what you know. These are Versace.” She looked down at his loafers and snorted. “I’d like to see you in a pair of my heels, but you can’t last five minutes.”
Dean walks up behind Claire and throws her sweater in her hands. “Finished, kiddo. Make sure not to be too rough on your clothes in the future, ‘kay?”
He opened the door the apartment and heard Charlie at her computer, the keys clacked as she typed up an editorial, an article, or her latest piece for a zine. Never satisfied with her day job, she picked a myriad of freelance pieces. Feminism, queer studies, gaming, whatever she could get her hands on. She glimpsed up from her computer and swirled in her chair. “Hey Dean, please tell me you got food.”
I don’t know why you didn’t show up last night. Maybe an emergency came up. Maybe you were late and we missed each other. Maybe you decided against it. Maybe you were nervous. It doesn’t matter. I get it. It just didn’t happen.
“I remember how hard Sam used to study. You could use the day, so take it. If it wigs you out so much you can come in for a couple of hours. Trust me, after finals you’ll be plenty busy.”
He’d already put it off for six weeks: the moment wasn’t right, she had a bad day, he had a bad day, or it was a good day and he didn’t want to ruin it. Every night he went to sleep and hadn’t broken up with her, his conscience danced around his mind, pleaded and bargained him to break up with her.
“What’s holding you back? We’ve been together for almost a year. Every other boyfriend I’ve had would’ve already had sex with me. I’ve got needs, Castiel, and you’re not fulfilling them.”
“Because I broke up with April and I actually don’t know if she’s still there.” He walked towards the sitting room and anticipated Gabe would follow him.
It must be the season for endings. Last night I had an epiphany. Maybe not so much an epiphany, but the requests and concerns of my friends and family finally made sense. My actions have been dour when it comes to relationships. At this point, we’ve been chipping away at what we originally wanted off the tables, but I find it harder each message to stand by those rules. And if I want to be honest, you need to know too because you were involved in a way. Last night I broke up with my girlfriend of almost a year. I had never been happy in the relationship as I only entered it to appease my parents. I know, desperate. But I thought I could go through with it for their sake. And at the beginning, it wasn’t hard. The woman was tolerable, sometimes a companion. We worked in the same sphere and had several similar interests, but it was never going to be enough to sustain our relationship. And then we had cybersex on New Year’s and I realized what I was missing, but I was still too scared to break up with her. It came to a head last night and it was quite the fallout.
I’m glad you feel better. I enjoy doing crossword puzzles in my spare time, or sudoku. I feel like you would enjoy a more hands on hobby than crosswords or sudoku. Since you enjoy baking (which I assume you would be if you’re involved enough to have famous cookies. I envy those who get to eat them, they sound delicious) knitting might be a good hobby for you. I know you dismissed it as a spite activity, but they’re similar. Patterns are like recipes. Plus, at the end of each hobby you produce something you can enjoy, though the knitting project could be long term joy while the baking product would be (delicious) short term pleasure. Just thought you might like my two cents.
“They were all smiles when I told them. They were more than happy for you to join me with my family.”
“C’mon, it wasn’t that bad. So you’re a bit of a dick. Everyone is over something at some point in your life.”
first in the presence of other faculty members. And Dean Heart-of-Gold Winchester did which means I win. Pay. Up.” Charlie thrust her hand under Gabe’s nose. He rolled his eyes but gave her a twenty.
Dean didn’t respond, and despite himself, Cas looked up. There was an indulgent smile on Dean’s face. “Learnin’ ‘bout bees, huh? You always did like ‘em.”
Huffing out a sigh, Dean finally turned and looked at Victor. All he saw in Vic’s soft brown eyes was kindness and understanding.
“You’re a fucking coward,” he told himself. Cas plopped on his couch and stared at the wall, ignoring the tears that burned his eyes as he heard Dean’s door open and close, but there was no knock on his own. He heard the throaty rumble of a pickup truck start up and fade away. “Fuck,” he mumbled, pressing the base of his hands against his eyes to stop the impending tears.
The tool fell to the floor with a loud clatter. “Cas?” Dean whispered. “What - am I -” he shook his head. “I’m dreaming. It’s one of the nightmares, I’m dreaming. I have to wake up - I have to -” Dean sat straight up in bed, soaked in sweat. A light switched on.
“Yeah. But he’s got another family. Wife and kid somewheres. I dunno. I ain’t seen him in a long long time and I hope it stays that way. Hate that guy. Every time he comes around he hits me or says something asshole-y. Loves his nicknames. Likes to call me anything but Dean - fag, fairy, I’ve even gotten slut a time or two. Such a fun guy. My mom calls him her sperm donor. Fuck John Winchester,” Dean said, raising his glass in a toast. “Lousy old drunk.” Dean looked at his beer glass. “Cas, don’t let me have any more beer, ‘k?” Dean shoved his glass away.
“You fucking bastard,” Dean muttered. “You’re playing me - making me choose one over the other.” He stood and crossed the floor, setting his mug down in the sink. “Just get the job done. Get it done so I can go get Cas, because - because -” Dean couldn’t get the words to form. “Just get it done,” he said again.
“Cas,” he chokes out, the words clogging his throat. He wants to scream for the angel, beg him to free him from this prison Michael has created in his mind.
The day after he cruelly tossed Cas from the bunker, Dean didn’t get out of bed. He didn’t sleep, but he didn’t get up. Dean stared at the wall. Rolled over and stared at the ceiling. Rolled again and stared at the other wall. His eyes burned from the insomnia. He tried to tell himself it was the only reason they burned. He sat on the floor and leaned against his bed, playing every sad song he owned on the record player while hiding his face in a pillow.
“Uh, yeah, what’s this all about?” The suspicious look had turned to concern. “The Beilers are my friends. Is this guy dangerous?”
, one of the only shows they could get both Ben and Claire to agree on, while Dean dozed off and on. He woke up when Cas announced he and Claire were heading home, and Dean spent the next thirty minutes getting Ben through a bedtime snack, teeth brushing, and pajamas.
Huffing, Sam pulled the bitchiest of bitchfaces. “You are so ridiculous,” he groused. Sam shoved back from the table and left the kitchen, leaving Dean to stare into space.
Thank you so much for reading, and thank you to the wonderful mods. I really enjoyed this challenge!!
Dean pushed through the doors, heading straight for the Impala. “We’ll go to the motel, pack up, and head up to Rushford. We can get Cas back and head back to Lebanon and take care of the Sam situation -”
Just down the hall, Dean saw Cas leading his class inside from the playground. He admired Cas’s outfit for a moment, again thinking to himself how well those pants fit. How well the entire ensemble fit. Cas looked so good in his prefered waistcoat and slacks look and Dean wondered if -
Cas was setting jars of honey in the sale cabinet when he caught the sound of an engine. It sounded familiar, and he listened as it came up the hill towards the house. He’d just made it to the porch steps when the sound rounded the bend and his heart jumped into his throat when he saw the car.
“Yeah, buddy, go for it. I’m going to get some groceries delivered since it looks like you might be here a bit.”
“Oh, my roommate. He’s a vegan and he’s been doing most of the cooking and I dunno. It’s good. I don’t really miss the meat. Although, when he gets stressed out, he apparently craves burgers and fuckin’ hell he can make a good burger. Juicy and delicious and seasoned just right, man oh man -” Aaron was staring at him with a little smile on his face, cheek resting in an open palm. “What?”
Dean’s hand shook around the stick in his hand, but he held it high. It had been surprisingly easy to get out of the castle, after a quick stop in Rowena’s lair to retrieve an invisibility draught. Still, fear nearly ate him alive as he drew closer to the King of Hellania’s encampment, heart pounding so hard he was sure they could hear it.
His cheeks flamed and he knew his blush must be dripping down his neck. “That obvious?” he asked gruffly.
Ach - doesn't really have a meaning, just kinda of a Ah or Oh kind of thing. Like Ach, Cas you're a gut helper would be like Oh, Cas, you're a good helper.
Time was so strange. Cas drifted in and out, never really asleep, or awake even, as his fever raged. Sometimes he woke chilled to the bone, shivering horribly in his nest of blankets. Other times, he woke sweaty and boiling, with Mary humming Beatles tunes as she bathed his brow.
“Oh, Cas. Don’t give up. He’s worth it. Just--be there for him. Love him. He’ll see, I know he will.”
After a great weekend watching Jess and Sam get married, going back to work Monday was the ultimate downer. As expected, work was terrible that morning. Tuesday was no better, and when lunch rolled around, all Dean wanted to do was get the hell out, so he left his food in the fridge and walked across the street to a sandwich shop. He ordered falafel on pita, not even really aware that he was ordering a vegan lunch.
“Not going anywhere, I promise.” Dean put the cool cloth back on his head. “And you’re not alone, Cas. You got me, my moms, Charlie, Sam, Jess, Kat. There’s a lot of people that love you. You’re not alone, Cas, I promise you. I’m gonna be right here. You’ll be ok, you’re just sick. I promise you’ll be ok.” Dean’s fingers were in his hair again. “Just sleep, buddy. Close your eyes and sleep.”
Dean looked up in surprise just in time to see Dorothy nod and pat Charlie’s shoulder. “If you ever change your mind, Red -”
Cas left the room, his and Claire’s inaudible voices traveling through Dean’s little house before being abruptly cut off by the much softer closing of his kitchen door. Whatever had been keeping Dean on his feet up until that point disappeared and he sat down on the closed toilet seat, all of his breath leaving him in a rush. He quickly replayed the scene in his mind half a dozen times, bewildered, confused, and more than a bit turned on.
“Ok, what did he do this time? You look like you’ve lost your best friend.” Mary flipped a chair backwards and sat down, thunking a heavy mug full of black coffee on the table top. Castiel considered playing dumb for a moment but let out a heavy sigh.
Silence reigned as they tidied and packed the motel room. Dean changed out of his suit and into jeans, a tee, and a flannel shirt. He carefully hung his Fed suit back on the hangers and slipped them into his garment bag.
So the first two chapters of this fic have been in my "unfinished business" folder since DCBB 2014. This was supposed to be my DCBB that year, but as has happened every year since I joined fandom, I failed to submit a finished DCBB and dropped out. This year, I started writing a DCBB but didn't like the story. I was going through that folder and found this and was like YES THIS but Tropefest. And now here we are.
Cas didn’t look convinced but didn’t say anything else. He finished with Dean’s suit and stepped into the bedroom, fetching Dean’s shoes from the floor. “These are nice,” he said, admiring the deep cherry toned leather before tucking them into the closet.
“I’m fine,” Dean said, stepping back into the room. Castiel caught him as his knees gave out, making a lie of his words.
The bunker trembles mightily and he shoots to his feet, heart pounding in his chest. The voice is soft and comes to him from far away.
“I’m just saying,” Charlie held her hands up, “maybe don’t go in there all Captain Kirk, phasers armed and ready. Maybe talk to him, feel him out. You can’t just show up and demand he come home. You get me?”
Cas leaned over the sink, bracing himself on the porcelain with his elbows locked and rigid. A hysterical feeling welled up inside him and he was struck with the sudden urge to cry. A fierce longing for the bunker and it’s occupants left him feeling nearly breathless, and he swiped at his wet eyes with his left hand.
Charlie showed up at the bunker about two weeks after Cas left, and an adventure happened involving a wicked witch and Dorothy - yes,
“That’s lovely,” Cas said, “where would you like to put it?” He stood and took the scotch tape Claire offered him.
Dean was leaning against the wall behind the table, watching Sam and Jess dance. They were staring into each other faces, smiling and looking starry eyed. Dean looked sad.
“Bartholomew. One of Naomi’s protégés. Definitely a ‘douche’ as you would say.” Cas crossed his arms. “So because I’m being hunted, you kicked me out of arguably one of the safest places on the planet.”
“Oh. Right, thanks. Maybe my blood sugar’s a little low.” Dean plucked one of his mother’s beautiful jelly doughnuts from the box, practically inhaling the pastry.
“I can’t believe you didn’t hear me come in. I wasn’t quiet.” He walked the bottle out to the kitchen, coming back with a hand towel as Dean sat up, holding perfectly still as Cas dabbed all the beer off his shirt. “I came to see if you wanted a snack or help getting ready for bed.”
Dean could barely breathe as Alastair stepped from the tent, surrounded by demons and an fearsome looking black dragon.
Cas pulled the blankets away to get up but was immediately stopped by a solid arm flopping over his midsection and the discomfort of a cast shoved against his back.
Her voice faded to a buzzing sound in his ears. Some type of gel was brushed along his forehead, patterns drawn across his bare chest. A rough voice chanted in a guttural language and the words made Dean's skin crawl as realized that he was strapped down, his ankles and wrists bound to a flat surface. Panic set in rapidly and he fought against the bonds.
And then that whole dance at Sam and Jess’s reception. Shit, he should have kissed him. The moment was perfect, the lighting was right, and even the damn words of the song -
“Well now, what do we have here? Owen, you’ve brought me a straggler!” A man with an impressive beard and straw hat peered down at Cas. “Got a name, son?”
“Oh Dean. Sweet, sweet boy. First thing you need to learn about demons,” Alastair sneered, drawing close until his lips were millimeters from Dean’s own. It took everything the prince had not to rear back in alarm. “Demons
“Dean, you broke your dominant arm. It’s ok to ask me to help. I don’t mind, especially after you cared for me when I had the flu.”
“How can you expect me to stay here when my home is under attack? If nothing else, I can help with the wounded!”
“I can do this. It’s just shaving. I got this.” Dean slathered his face in shaving cream and reached for the razor with his left hand. He eyed it suspiciously. “Be a man, Winchester,” he chided himself.
“We’re really lucky we moved here,” Claire said quietly. “A whole family, just waiting for us. I love it here, Uncle Cas.”
Dean continued to fight them, alternating between angry growls and frightened whimpers. His eyelids fluttered, fever bright green eyes staring unseeingly at Cas before rolling back in his head.
Grunting an affirmative, Dean continued staring at the coffee maker. “Ben was up barfing all night.”
“I know.” Cas’s eyes followed Sam’s to where Dean stood, wavering slightly as Lady Ellen and Captain Singer fussed over him. “He’s still rather weak, and needs a lot of rest. It was very close. Too close. He should be resting now.”
He felt a little stab of guilt as Cas gave him a friendly wave from the doorway, and he returned it quickly before escaping into his own classroom. Cas wanted to see Meg again. He wasn’t interested in Dean, therefore, Dean going on a date with Victor should be a non issue.
Laying on his side on the couch, Dean stared at the tv half focused, watching as Dr. Sexy charmed his patients...and Dean. “Fuckin’ love you, Doc. Come fix my arm.” He saluted the tv with his half-empty El Sol. He might’ve been a wee bit tipsy, despite Cas’s orders not to drink with his pain meds. But, it was Friday night, a four day weekend, and Lisa was keeping Ben for the weekend since they were going on a short trip. Dean was bored, maybe a bit lonely, and his arm wouldn’t stop throbbing, pain meds or not. He considered calling Cas, but Cas had spent most of the week looking after him. He deserved a night off.
Opening the door of the small bath, the delicious aroma of food threatened to knock him off his feet. “It smells wonderful,” Cas told Lydia as he walked back into the kitchen.
A short time later, Claire was happily toting a pile of stuffed animals over to Kat’s while Trixie carried her overnight bag and blanket, both girls running their mouths a mile a minute about the giant Hello Kitty unicorn statue they planned in their Minecraft Realm.
He wondered if they were serious, his mind flashing back to Meg telling him that Dean got around quite a bit. He wondered if Vic was just another notch in Dean’s belt.
“There’s a ritual,” Gabriel explained. “It can reverse a mating bond. But it’s high magic, and there’s no guarantee it’ll work, plus there’s a good chance he’ll die in the process.”
His whole arm ached. Six weeks in, two weeks post elbow surgery, and Dean was completely over it--over the pain, over the cast, over not being able to shower or play piano or do
Pushing down a little bubble of excitement, Cas smiled. “As I told you yesterday, I’m happy to help in anyway that I can.”
Then Cain winked at him as he made his way around the truck and ruined Cas’s briefly good mood. Cas waited for Dean to get settled in the middle spot and then stared sulkily out the window as Cain drove them into the city. Cain and Dean kept up pleasant conversation on the drive to the restaurant, and while Dean definitely tried to involve Cas in the discussion, Cain didn’t, and Cas wasn’t really interested anyway.
“Hey,” Cas said, settling beside him. He slid the coffee and cream over. Ellen definitely knew Dean well, because all Cas had ever seen him drink was black coffee. But, without really even looking, Dean dumped two sugars and three of the creamers into the mug. “Are you alright?” Cas asked softly.
Lydia smiled indulgently at her husband while Cas spread some of the chunky sauce on his sandwich. The condiment was quite spicy but complimented the sweet ham perfectly. He couldn’t help but think that Dean would enjoy it. “It’s delicious,” he told Jacob, and the man beamed his approval of Cas’s words.
Besides they still hadn’t talked about that weird moment in Dean’s bathroom earlier in the week. Dean kept waiting for it to happen again, but it hadn’t and Dean didn’t know how to initiate it without looking completely foolish or desperate, and despite that weird moment, he still didn’t believe Cas really felt the same as he did.
Sam pulled a face. “Who pissed in your pie?” he shot back. Dean gave him a Look. “Hey, I’m sorry. I know you’re hurting.”
“Yeah, well -” he smiled at Kali as he rubbed his large belly. “It happens. Anyway, we’ve prepared a pool with salt and other items that will hopefully draw the demon’s poison out of Dean.”
“Ooh, pay up, Milton,” Charlie giggled as her and Gabe walked into the room. “We have a love confession!”
It didn’t take them long to get home. Cas made sure Dean got into the house, carrying his work bag for him. He checked the thermostat and helped Dean out of his winter gear. “Dinner will be around five if that’s ok. Claire and I will bring everything over. I don’t want you to risk falling.”
“Oh Dean,” Cas breathed. He leaned forward and caught Dean’s lips with his own, the kiss sweet and full of promise. “The moment you are well,” he murmured, pressing their foreheads together.
“Sorry, kiddo. That had to go, too.” Gabriel must’ve seen the despair Dean felt written on his face. “Don’t be upset. Think about how much fun you two’ll have getting to mate all over again.”
The fingers holding his hand squeezed gently. “I’m here for you. I want you to know that, Cas. I’m always gonna be here for you.” Dean found a tissue from somewhere and wiped Cas’s tears from his face. He sat on the edge of the bed. “You’re my best friend. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for you. Ok?”
“I quit,” he told them, standing up. “Effective immediately. I fucking quit.” He tossed his stack of manila folders at Gordon, watching in satisfaction as they opened and sent papers flying. “You want my job, pal? All yours. Have fun.” Still chuckling, he grabbed his suit jacket off the back of his chair and tossed it over his shoulder. “Arrivederci assholes!”
“Yeah, our dad was driving Mom to the hospital in my baby and they slid into a snowdrift. I was actually born in the passenger seat.”
The morning of Sam and Jess’s wedding dawned bright and beautiful. Dean drove them to Lawrence in time to get photographed “helping” Sam get ready for his wedding. Then it was off to the church, and Cas slipped Dean a tissue when he started to cry a little at the vows.
Dean leaned back in the chair, watching as Cas packed the bowl full again. They passed it back and forth a few times. “I’m fucking starving,” Dean said dreamily. “Like, could eat a house. Fuck.”
“No, it’s not. It’s the demon’s fault. Which is why I have to go. They plan to bring war to Winchester and I won’t leave your brother alone to fight them.”
“Don’t, Cas. Ok. Just don’t.” They sat in silence. Dean sipped his coffee and stared at the couples dancing. Rufus spun Mary around and she threw her head back and laughed. “Everyone’s having a great time.”
The coffee maker finally finished and Dean snatched the pot and filled his mug, turning to fill Cas’s without thinking when he was done. “Well, barfing kid all night didn’t exactly leave me with an appetite this morning, and I was late dropping him off, so,” Dean shrugged. “I’ll live.”
“No, no, not even a little. But he might be in danger, and we’re trying to protect him. Is this him?” Dean unfolded the picture and showed them, aware of Charlie joining him.
“Daddy! Look, Claire can spell names in glitter!” Ben came barrelling down the stairs, a stack of pink, purple, and red hearts in his hands and a small cloud of glitter trailing after him.
No. No, Cas needed more. He wanted a lifetime with Dean. He just had no idea how to express those feelings without destroying the best friendship he’d ever had. A burning sensation filled his eyes and he blinked away tears. Was he really this foolish? Mourning a relationship that didn’t exist in the first place?
“Well, gentleman, this was an absolute delight. It was nice to spend some real time with you Cas. I can see why Dean values you so highly.”
Outside, Cas’s slightly improved mood slipped again as he found Cain with his arm around Dean, carefully escorting him to his ridiculous big red truck, although the quick once over Dean gave him suggested he definitely noticed the outfit. Cas smiled in victory.
Wandering down an elegant staircase dripping with lush green vines, he walked past the ornate pool that graced the center courtyard of the palace. Anna sat on a bench, in human form, her long red hair tumbling down her back. He could tell by her scent that she was also pregnant, although clearly not as far along as Gabriel, who seemed about to burst. An embroidery hoop rested in her hands.
“I was uh -” Cas scratched at his sweaty hair. “Named for an angel,” he finally said. “But a good friend,” there was that little pang in his chest again, “nicknamed me Cas and it stuck.”
“Uncle Cas, I can’t find my sneakers!” Claire’s irritated voice carried up the stairs and both men jumped.
“It is.” Dean let his eye slip shut again, sighing happily as he nuzzled into his pillow. He was snoring again in seconds.
Cas woke just after six am with a horrible headache. Which meant he was in the kitchen, getting himself some orange juice to chase some excedrin, when Dean’s door opened. He watched as Dean stepped out onto his porch, in bakery whites, and was about to step outside and offer a good morning.
“Aunt Jess,” Claire corrected him. “And Mary said I can call her Gramma and Ellen is Nonna.” Claire looked pleased by this turn of events. “So now I have two aunts, Aunt Jess and Aunt Jo, and Uncle Sam!”
Cas set the pot on the counter and plugged it in before walking into the living room. “You are very excited about this.”
Dean brandished a thermometer and slid it under Cas’s tongue. “Ok. Let’s take your temp and get you back in bed.” Whatever the thermometer said when it beeped, Dean didn’t like it, judging by the depth of his frown. “Cas, if you get much worse, I’m taking you to Bayview. You’re scaring the shit out me with this fever. 102.8 is way too fucking high.”
“It’s ok. I just - I care about you a lot, buddy,” Dean mumbled. He set the glass to the side and disappeared for a bit, returning with another cool washcloth. “Gotta get that fever down. Drink some more, dehydration sucks and ends up with you in the ER.”
“Aw, don’t get all embarrassed. Not your fault you’re hotter than hell.” Aaron took another big bite while staring at Dean, looking like maybe he wanted to take a bite of Dean instead.
“Sent a parchment, a list of his demands. If you are sent to him with your dowry by sunrise tomorrow, he’ll withdraw. Otherwise…” Sam trailed off. “I’m not giving in, though. You mean too much to me. He can’t have you. Not to mention he’s probably lying about withdrawing.”
For a moment, Cas was sure Dean would argue, but a look of resignation settled on his handsome face. “Yeah. I’m pretty beat. Come with me? I want to know what’s going on.”
Dean whimpered and tried to pull away, pressing closer to Castiel as he tried to escape the hot, salty water. The more Kali poured the water over Dean, the more he fought, struggling in Cas’s arms, barely conscious and terrified. His body shook, spasms running through his arms and legs as he fought Castiel.
“Dude, do not psychoanalyze me. I always hated when you did that shit.” Dean folded his arms over his chest and glared at Aaron. “I’m not one of your patients.”
Sir Benny stepped forward with a roll of parchment in his hand. “Received this when the army first showed up. This is their demands.”
“I’m real, I promise. And while we really don’t have the time to discuss these photos you were trying to hide from me, I assure you there is nothing off putting about them. Lucifer tormented me with much the same. Sometimes I thought…” Cas trails off for a moment and tugs Dean a little closer. “I know how you feel,” he whispers, pressing a kiss to Dean’s temple. “Oh, Dean. I feel the same way. I have for quite some time - maybe even since the first time I pulled you from Perdition.” Cas tilts Dean’s head up and smiles at him. “Ten years ago today, in fact.”
“No. You have to eat, I don’t care how you feel,” Charlie hissed. “Dig in, Handmaiden. You’re eating. I’ll feed you myself if I have to.”
Terrified that his expression was betraying just how much Dean was enjoying this sweet domestic moment, he tried to think of anything that would calm him down. He ran through half a dozen images, finally settling on Bobby in a teeny tiny Speedo.
The tension drained out of Lisa immediately. “Oh my god, thank you. I should’ve called.” Ben pushed past her into the house. “Is it ok if he stays for a couple of days?”
Leaving Victor protesting behind him, Dean slipped into the shirt and headed back downstairs. He needed a beer...or three.
Dean was starting to seriously develop feelings for Cas. And that was nothing short of dangerous. Yeah, they were great friends. They did everything together, shared food and rides to work, and lived next door to each other. And while that was great, and awesome, it was also potentially troublesome. Because if Dean ever got brave enough to admit to Cas that he hadn’t slept with anyone else since the day they’d met, if he admitted that he couldn’t think of anyone but Cas, if he finally manned up enough to tell Cas he loved him and it all went sideways -
Dean didn’t respond. He climbed back into bed and rolled onto his belly, burying his face in the pillow, squeezing his eyes closed tightly, wishing that Cas’s face would fade from his memory.
“Yeah.” Dean set his burger aside and reached across the table to grab Cas’s hand. “Thanks for staying with me,” he said, completely oblivious to the rush of butterflies he was setting off in Cas’s stomach. “You’re just--amazing, Cas. I can’t believe you just fell into my life like you did.”
“Things are set the way Lisa wants them, it seems,” Cas said. “With little regard to your feelings or wants. You want to be with Ben more, that much is clear. You mentioned this before, at Christmas.I think you need to tell Lisa this and perhaps revisit your arrangements.”
“Hmm.” Dean glanced over at Cas and immediately did a double take, because Cas was giving him the most intense look. “I uh--I’m fine with you doing it, since it’s a closer shave.”
Huffing a sigh, Sam shook his head. “If you’re this upset about him being gone, why did you ask him to leave in the first place? He could’ve stayed. He’d’ve been safe here.”
“Your mom came to take Claire to buy personal items, bless her. I wouldn’t even know where to start.”
Cas watched him go. How had he managed to find such kind people? He stared up at the sky for a moment.
“I don’t know what to call Dean. Gramma Mary said maybe I should call him Daddy, but I think she was just joking around and that’s weird. I don’t call you Daddy.”
“My mate - demon bit him over my bite - help -” he gasped, before collapsing to the floor and passing out cold.
“Hey, I’m fine,” Dean said, as Cas pushed the door open slightly. Dean lay back in a nest of pillows, light from the fire on the hearth lining the planes and angles of his beautiful face. Sam sat on the end of the bed, face buried in his hands.
Which is why he was standing in his bathroom glaring down at the razor laying innocuously on his sink.
“He will. He called for while you recovered from your flight. Dean wants you very much. Don’t concern yourself with that, Castiel.” She set the embroidery aside and reached for his hand, rubbing her soft fingers over his palm. “When is that last time you’ve eaten?”
“I imagine it does,” Cain answered as Cas came into the living room. He sat on Dean’s couch in grey tweed pants, and a fairly low cut burgundy v-neck sweater. His curly gray hair was loose around his shoulders. He offered Cas a far too friendly smile.
Cas unpacked their lunch on Dean’s desk, carefully opening containers and setting them in front of Dean. He pulled out a can of coke and opened it. Cas laid a folded napkin next to Dean’s lunch and put his silverware down.
“Oh god, he found the craft herpes,” Dean fake complained. “Let me see, little dude.” Ben thrust a huge pink heart into his hands. It was covered in glitter and sequins and right in the center in gold glitter, was Claire’s careful handwriting. The heart read
“Ok. I just -” she sighed, dropping down on the bed. “I just don’t want you to get hurt and I think there’s more riding on this for you than just keeping Cas safe.”
“One person did insist that I become a cop, but I didn’t listen to him,” Dean slurred, nearly knocking over his beer as he pulled Cas from his train of thought. “I keep worrying he’s just gonna show up. Sam didn’t invite him.”
Lydia returned a few moments later with two plates and her own mug. “I used to get those restless nights quite often.”
“Dean,” he whispered, as Dean pulled himself from the car. A redhead he didn’t know got out on the opposite side, shutting the door behind her.
At a meeting after lunch, Dean found it hard to concentrate on anything having to do with work. Between running into Aaron at lunch, and the ever present weight of one Castiel James Novak, he had no hope of staying focused on work.
Heed the tags, it gets a little non-con in the beginning. Only one chapter left and this one will be done! I CAN DO THIS. woohoo!!
There were no open tables inside, so Dean claimed a small table on the patio. Dean picked at his food, eyes downcast as he wondered what the hell was wrong with him.
“I’m sure you will,” Ellen smiled, sliding a mug across the bar. “No sugar, no cream, just the way he likes it.” She slid a little bowl full of single serve creamers towards Cas. “But since he doesn’t have to be tough all the time, here’s some creamer and there’s sugar on the table.”
Tension racheted up to eleven in that little bathroom, and Dean was utterly aware of how undressed he was, in nothing but his boxers and ratty grey bathrobe. He couldn’t look away from Cas’s blue gaze, his brain on autopilot and filing away every different hue in Cas’s eyes. He was so gorgeous and standing there just staring at Dean like that? He couldn’t help it--a rush of heat shot up his spine and Dean held his breath, not sure what was going to happen next.
“Well, Lyddie does the beekeeping ‘round here. She sells the honey and puts a little money in our pockets.”
Castiel ate the rest of his meal in silence, observing his hosts. Aaron appeared to be in his late thirties, and clearly unmarried judging by the lack of beard. Jacob was grey all over. Grey hair, grey beard, with deep crow's feet around his eyes that suggested a lifetime of laughing and smiling. He and Lydia both appeared to be in their sixties, although Lydia retained quite a bit of blond in her grey streaked hair.
Cas looked back at Dean, who’s eyes were still closed. His face was slack and the hold on his wrist was loose.
“Jealousy is probably not a good look on you,” he told himself, but that didn’t change the fact that he was damn near green with it.
“Yes, my husband had some business to attend to and couldn’t make it. He really would have liked to have been here. Jack’s friends are very important to him, but he’ll have to catch the next one,” Dean says warily. He doesn’t have to deal with homophobes often—most people are smart enough to keep their mouths shut when they see two big guys holding hands—but this is still Kansas, and he can never be completely certain. Mrs. Brown’s eyebrows knit in confusion.
Some time later, Sam emerges from the cabin and stands a respectful distance from Dean. Dean is only vaguely aware that he is no longer alone. He can barely think. He is simultaneously the raw nerve left behind by a severed limb and the dead limb itself. Dean’s grief ebbs slightly before it crashes back into him in a never-ending cycle. He doesn’t know how he’ll ever be able to move on from this vast painful nothing inside him in the shape of Castiel.
“And you’ve been wonderful mothers to the girls,” Castiel says, breaking his contemplative silence. “Who knows where they would be now—or even if they would be alive—without the two of you. You’ve given them love and a home and a life to be proud of. Claire…” he trails off. He doesn’t need to say anything else; everyone understands.
“Yes, because I’m old and sentimental and just love my family so much. But not enough that I want my thirty-year-old daughter sitting on me,” Jody says. Claire puts her hand to her chest in mock offense.
“And you, too, Donna. You’re just as much our mom as Jody is,” Dean adds. Donna’s smile is bright, her eyes squinching closed and deep dimples appearing on her cheeks.
He feels overwhelmed all of a sudden. His baby is growing up too fast, just like Claire grew up too fast. Sometimes, Dean wishes Jack were still as small as he was the first time he called him ‘mama.’
Dean is momentarily confused. Jack sounds so certain, but he’s looking right at Dean, like he’s expecting a response. Dean tries to fit Kelly into Jack’s request for apple juice and can’t quite make it work.
she says sarcastically. Dean bristles but before he can respond, a wave of golden light draws his attention.
“There you go, kiddo. Now go find Daddy or Sam so I can finish making dinner,” Dean says, nudging Jack towards the kitchen door. Jack toddles away, appeased now that he has his juice.
“Oh, he’s fine,” Mrs. Brown said, waving absently. “Lord knows there’s too many kids and too much sugar in this house for them all to be calm and follow rules. Anyway. Jack said his dad wouldn’t be able to come,” she said, sounding more questioning than Dean thought she had a right to be.
“That’s not true, Dean. Cas is dead because of Lucifer. Jack is just a newborn. He’s just a kid. We have to find him and keep him safe before the angels kill him,” Sam says patiently. Anger flashes through Dean. He turns to face his brother.
“I suppose we have you boys to thank for our girls. You brought them all to us. Sometimes, when they’re really annoying, I wish you hadn’t, but…” Jody says, smiling. Donna playfully slaps her shoulder.
“Cas is dead because of him,” Dean says quietly, eyes glued to the angel blade at Castiel’s side. Sam makes a noise of disapproval before pushing to his feet.
“Fine, I’ll sit on Donna’s lap. She won’t mind. Will you, Donna?” Claire asks, nudging Kaia over so she has space to sit. Donna laughs brightly.
“He’s two, Claire. And he sometimes uses his grace when he’s frustrated. So, forgive me if I want to prevent another mass lightbulb explosion,” Dean says, then realizes that Claire threatened to call Cas with her relationship troubles. “And you absolutely should not call Cas about Kaia. That man is oblivious when it comes to relationships.” Claire snorts.
Dean is aware that he has been kneeling next to Castiel’s body for a very long time. His knees hurt where they rest heavily on the gravel. Dean is also aware that he can’t really see. It’s dark and his eyes are blurred with tears and his newly shattered world is no longer shiny because
After a much longer pause than Dean is used to (Jack is a very talkative kid—he just doesn’t make a lot of sense most of the time), Jack finally says:
Dean turns his face to the sky. He thinks of praying, of playing the penitent, but the only person who ever answers his prayers is lying dead at his feet. Instead, Dean watches the pre-dawn grey creep across the darkness. He thinks of the millions of sunrises Castiel must have seen and wonders if any of them had ever looked as dull as this one.
“God, Jody,” Dean says finally, laughing a little. “You went and made us all cry.”  Jody smiles at him, so fond it almost breaks Dean’s heart.
“Happy Mother’s Day, Mama,” Jack says quietly, squeezing Dean’s shoulder. Dean smiles and reaches the hand not holding Cas’s up to rest over Jack’s hand.
There’s a long silence, punctuated by sniffling from more than one person around the fire. Donna pulls Jody against her shoulder, squeezing her tight and kissing her forehead.
Dean’s elation fizzles into something more manageable once he remembers that, oh yeah, he was in the middle of making dinner. And talking to his other kid on the phone. Hopefully, Claire isn’t too pissed that he literally dropped everything to tend to Jack.
Dean can’t stomach the pitying look on Sam’s face. He pinches the bridge of his nose before returning his attention to Castiel.
“Enough about me,” Jody says after a long moment of silence. “Happy Mother’s Day yourself, Dean,” she finishes. Dean feels his face heat, though it’s probably just the fire and not the overwhelming emotions he’s feeling.
Dean is marginally relieved. This is probably just a miscommunication borne of Jack’s refusal to adhere to social norms. Damn, Dean loves that kid.
“Mr. Winchester?” the young woman—Mrs. Brown—asks after greeting Jack enthusiastically. Dean nods and holds out his hand. The woman shakes his hand, flashing a small smile, and stands back to pull the door open wider, gesturing for him to come inside. Jack drops his hand like a hot potato and runs straight through the house to the back door. Dean can see an inflatable pool set up in the back yard. Shrieks and laughter come from the living room. There are enough streamers and balloons littering the house to have Dean wincing in sympathy for the eventual cleanup effort.
“Dean, I’ve been working with Lisa for quite a while now, especially since she’s Claire’s teacher. She’s a reasonable woman. I think you need to bring this up.”
There was a sharp rap on the back door. Dean sighed and went to answer it, his mood changing as he happily greeted the man on the other side.
“Dean,” Aaron said softly. “It wasn’t all your fault, you know? I know how you get and I know you’ve probably taken all the blame for us breaking up, but I left you. I was the one that wasn’t willing to work it out. Remember?”
Also I can no longer promise straight fluff. Dean still has some serious self esteem issues to work through with his sexual history (there isn't anything wrong with enjoying sleeping around, but he's beating himself up cause that what he do), and there's a little more that's going on with Cas's situation. But it won't be my usual agony angst fest. Promise.
“Thank you. I don’t mind coming over in the mornings to do this for you, but should you prefer to be independent, I’d suggest an electric razor. It’ll leave you slightly stubbly, but would allow you to do it by yourself.”
Castiel sat in the back of Becky and Jeremiah Yoder’s house, listening to Bishop Daniel Hostetler preach a sermon entirely in German. Grateful that his full understanding of every language on earth hadn’t departed with his grace, Cas soaked in the reverent service as the Bishop spoke about the importance of Baptism.
Charlie attacked her breakfast with gusto. Dean worked on his slowly, methodically, half eavesdropping on the guys sitting behind them.
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’s neck, breathing in his scent. He buried his face, trying very hard to fight back the second round of tears that were threatening. If this was the last time he’d get to have this, he wasn’t going to let his tears ruin the moment.
He sat on his couch for a while, wallowing in his misery. After a bit, Cas dragged himself up the stairs and through a shower, dressing perfunctorily after. Cas got in his Continental and drove a few blocks down Holabird to Sugar Mamas. Inside he ordered a cinnamon bun and a lavender London Fog, barely acknowledging Aaron and Jo’s cheerful greetings.
“You don’t have the right to keep him from defending his homeland. I’ll fly him there myself if that’s what it takes. We leave within the hour.” Chuck smiled and winked at Dean before turning and leaving the room.
The song ended and switched to something a little more upbeat and bouncy. Dean lifted his head from Cas’s shoulder and stared at him, looking a little dazed. He stared at Cas’s lips and licked his own.
“You will be. When this is over - you’ll mate him again when he’s strong. We can all smell it. You’re true.”
“Hospital.” Dean reached out and took his hand, gently untangling the IV line. “You scared the shit out of me. Your fever shot up and I couldn’t wake you, so I went downstairs to call Donna and ask her to come look at you. While I was downstairs, I hear this crash, come back up to find you passed out in the hallway. I called an ambulance. We’ve been here three hours and you just now woke up.” He rubbed his free hand over his eyes. “Man, when you get sick, you do it right.”
“I’ve got to get back to work. Hang in there, sweetie. And come talk to me anytime. I love you as much as I do him, Sam, and Jo. You’re one of mine now, kiddo. No matter what happens.” She ruffled his hair and he gave her a watery smile.
“We can get a sub, ok? Cas, you’re sick. It’s ok that you’re sick. Buddy,” Dean chuckled softly, “you’re wearing a sneaker and a dress shoe.”
“Yeah. Really don’t want to talk about it, though. I’ve got my Restaurant Management test today and I’m focused on that.”
Owen huffed and turned back to the truck as Castiel followed Jacob up a hill and into a sprawling farmhouse. “Lyddie, I’ve got a fellow that needs a meal.”
Dean blinks, afraid to speak. Michael has done this before, let him believe that Cas and Sam were there to pull him out. He was disappointed -
Cas forgot how breathing worked as Dean pulled infinitesimally away, just far enough that his face came into focus, a thousand freckles dancing across his nose.
man. I feel the Lord is telling me to watch over you. I might hear it from the Bishop, mind you, but I’ll make him see reason. Ain’t right to send a man with nothin’ back out into the cold world.” Jacob went back to tossing bales onto the wagon as if they weighed nothing while Cas stood beside him, lost in thought.
Mary appeared at his side with a glass of beer. “Don’t give up on my boy just yet,” she murmured. “You’re getting there. He’s a tough case to crack.” She kissed him on the cheek. “But you’re getting there.”
Timothy Cain was quickly becoming the bain of Cas’s existence. The man simply did not go away and Castiel hated the look that Dean got every time he was around. Fair enough that they had history, but did Dean have to look at Cain like he hung the fucking moon? And did Cain have to try and flirt his way into Cas’s pants every chance he got?!
“Don’t - please. He’s just - he makes these worlds and they play out like movies, at least until I figure it out -” Dean makes a grab for the photo and the other one - the wedding picture - falls from his hands.
Rumspringa - a time in Amish youth before Baptism when they're allowed to run wild. The idea is that experiencing the Englischer world will encourage them to return and be Baptized. During Rumspringa, many Amish youth cut their hair and buy cars.
Something was shifting between them. Castiel could feel it, like the ground was opening beneath them as he settled the check and held the passenger door for Dean to get into the Continental.
“Good, let’s go get some.” Standing, Dean followed Cas out of the room, turning to cast one last scathing look at Gabe, who giggled and winked.
“Now, I want you to rest,” Cas continued, tucking Dean back into bed. “You need to recover. Your body has been through a lot the last several days.” Cas smiled at him, reaching up to cup Dean’s cheek. He couldn’t help but lean into the warmth of Cas’s hand. “I have to go away for a while, but I’ll return -”
“Uh - Steve,” Cas murmured, giving the name on the credit card Dean had given him. “Where - where am I?”
“You’re a wonderful mother,” he told her at one point, sure that he must’ve been imagining the tears in her eyes.
“That would be--that would be amazing,” Dean said, feeling his eyes fill with tears. “Thank you Lisa.”
“Mmm.” Cas turned Dean’s head to the left and carefully dragged the razor over his cheek. “I can’t imagine it’s going to be easy to play piano.”
Some of those scenarios though - they’ve stuck with them. One of the memories on the floor is from one such fantasy. He and Cas, standing at the front of a church - Dean lifts the picture and holds it close to his heart. He wants that. He wants it so bad he can taste it.
“Fuck this,” he muttered, sitting up. He’d go home and sleep in his own bed and make his excuses to Dean in the morning.
A stop to look in the mirror had him trying to fix his hopeless hair but turning to admire the way his dark wash jeans hugged his ass. He slipped into the trench and added a bright red scarf. The whole look was on point, and Cas hoped Dean would notice.
“I was cold - I just needed somewhere to sleep. I’m sorry. I meant to get off before you left the rest stop. I must’ve been more tired than I thought.” He pulled his duffle close to his chest. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to -”
“Yes. Miss Hannah had some sample packs with a book about body changes. She gave it to me at school last week so I’m good for now but I don’t have anything else.”
“Are you warm enough? Your room feels a bit cold. Cold can make the break ache more.” Cas fussed around his room, pushing on all the windows to make sure they were fully shut.
Michael successfully put the kibosh on Dean’s last attempt to escape, so it’s quiet now all the damn time. Dean quit screaming a while ago. He’s been sitting in a corner of the bunker kitchen, on the floor with his back against the wall. Spread around him are memories, lots of memories, in the form of photographs.
“Dean, c’mon man. I’m sorry if I upset you. Really. And we did have fun tonight, right? We could at least be friends.” Victor appeared in the kitchen seconds behind Dean, taking the beer from his hands and sitting it on the counter. “Come on, look at me,” he cajoled, wrapping his fingers around Dean’s hand. “I said I was sorry and I am. C’mon, look at me,” he begged again.
Dean chuckled. “You really don’t like him. How come? He’s really a decent dude when you get to know him. He doesn’t mean anything by the flirting. I know it’s gotta be awkward to have a dude flirt with you when you’re straight and all.”
Dean flopped onto his back as Sam walked away. He covered his eyes with his forearm, trying to ignore how they burned.
a part of my family. I haven’t been the only one taking care of you this week, I hope you know. Mom, Ellen, Sam - they’ve all been at the house helping. The only reason Jess wasn’t around is the pregnancy. She can’t afford to get sick. Which is also why we’d only let Sam make deliveries and play gopher. But yeah, Cas, don’t ever doubt you’re part of my family. Ok?”
She nodded and left. Dean couldn’t help the bubble of excitement building in his chest. It was Monday. Maybe Lisa wouldn’t pick Ben up until Sunday evening, like she normally did when he had Ben on the weekend. Potentially a whole week with his kid? Damn right Dean was excited.
“I did. And you kinda were. But I wasn’t blameless either. I refused to meet you where you were, or even try to come to an understanding as to why you were working so much. A partnership is supposed to be exactly that - partners working together for a common goal. You worked too much, fine. But I wasn’t willing to work on us at all. We weren’t good for each other. It’s no one’s fault. And you still deserve to be happy and find someone. Ok?”
Dick’s visit couldn’t end soon enough. The man truly lived up to his name, and Dean felt sorry for Bobby. He was the store manager, after all, and all of that shit rolled onto him. Dean, as the assistant store manager, would be told later what needed to be fixed, but Bobby would never shift the blame. Bobby was the best boss Dean had ever had - he always stood between the Biggerson’s staff and the upper management.
“But it doesn’t make any sense! If this Bartholomew is really building an army, then we should be protecting Cas not pushing him away!”
Another man climbed up the stack of hay and glared down at Cas from under a Mac Trucks hat. “What the hell you doin’ on my load?”
Cas turned and started walking back towards the house. “That’s all I am to you, a tool. You live in a bunker full of important arcane information.” Cas stopped dead and spun to face Dean. “You fix it.” He pointed at Dean. “You broke it. You fix it. I’m done.” Cas turned and started walking again, stomping up the porch stairs.
“Yes, that’s a good idea.” Cas stood and reached for Dean’s coat, holding it so Dean could slide his arm into it as Cain worked on settling the check.
He turned to find Cas standing in the doorway, the sunlight limning the strong lines of his body, making him appear godlike, and denying Dean the view of his face.
“Please. We’ve all seen the way you two morons gaze at each other, spend all your time together, I mean really,” Gabe snorted, “it was just a matter of time.”
“Do you know what my IQ is?” Everyone stared at him blankly. “181. Fuckin’ 181. You know that makes me an actual, certified genius? Did you know I could’ve skipped seventh grade but I didn’t want to leave my friends? Like for real, I’m a fucking actual genius. And I’m sitting here, selling insurance policies at a job I hate, a job that has me terrified to take time off because I might get shitcanned. But really, why do I care if I get shitcanned? This is a fucking terrible job. I was top of my class at MIT. Did I ever tell you guys I went to MIT? I don’t even put it on my resume, and that’s a damn shame.”
“I’m sorry, Dean.” Cas squeezed his hand. “Sam says your father blessed our union before he passed.”
“We’ve added rock salt, essential oils, and herbs that will help suck the poison from him. You’ll have to hold him so that the bite is fully immersed,” Kali explained, stepping into the pool to assist Castiel.
“Meg, Ruby, Lilith, Brady,” Gadreel ticked their numbers off on his fingers. “We know of at least two dozen, but likely far more.”
(I am aware I misspelled "Bieler" in a few places. I'll catch that over the next few days and fix it.)
“Yeah. I dunno. I just -” he waved at Sam and Jess as he took a sip. “I’m happy for them.” He sighed and took another sip of coffee. “Looks like everyone’s got someone,” he muttered, staring down into the mug.
“Me too. He’s gonna be pissed if he’s not better by Thursday. Boy likes Thanksgiving dinner as much as I do.”
Dean yawned, staring blankly at the Cracker Barrel menu in his hand. Charlie was typing furiously on her phone, bright eyed and bushy tailed, having gotten a full eight hours while Dean worried, tossing and turning all night.
Every time he thought he was getting somewhere with Dean, there was an inevitable interruption. It was beyond frustrating.
“Cas, look, I shouldn’t have thrown you out of the bunker. But there’s things happening, and I didn’t have much choice.”
He was on what appeared to be the third floor of an ornate palace, done in elaborate tiles in rich jewel tones. A sparkling aquamarine pool danced in the light of late afternoon sunlight and leafy, hanging vines drooped everywhere. Below him, on the ground floor, a lady with long red hair walked arm in arm with a dark skinned man. Across from his room, he could see Gabriel through the glass, speaking with someone out of his sight.
“Yeah, well maybe you’re not.” Dean stared down at his coffee cup. “Maybe you’re just not there yet.”
Cas found himself on the floor of his bathroom with no idea how he’d gotten there. His head hurt, and he was laying with his cheek pressed to the toilet seat. “Gross,” he muttered, but utterly lacked the strength to raise his head.
The water was comfortably hot and smelled of the lavender, sage, rosemary, and tea tree they’d added. Cas waded into the water up his waist and gently lowered Dean, still cradling him in his arms. The second the water flowed over the ugly, blackened bite mark, Dean made a noise of distress.
“Shit, I hurt your feelings. I’m sorry, I definitely didn’t mean to be insulting. I was just…” Vic trailed off. “Everyone knows you’ve got it bad for Cas, but it didn’t seem to be goin’ anywhere and -”
“Rude.” Dean spared a glance at Charlie, leaning back in her chair with her arms crossed over her chest. “So am I wrong then? Do you not have the hots for one Castiel Novak?”
He was starting to feel wonderfully floaty and peaceful. “Can I try?” he asked, reaching for the pipe. Cas nodded and handed it over and Dean took a deep, long drag. He held the smoke in his lungs, thrilled to be able to do it without coughing. Then, Cas was at his lips again, expectant, waiting for Dean to exhale. So he did. Cas sucked it all down, holding it for a moment before let the smoke go.
Jacob waved him off. “Come, let’s get this hay out to the field and then we’ll head up to the house for lunch.” He leaned in closer and grinned. “My Lyddie’s making fried chicken today.”
“No? Not really. I mean--I wish I had more time with him. I kinda hate being a weekends only dad and conversely, sometimes I’d like a weekend off.” Dean sighed. “Does that make any sense at all?”
“Dean, I--” Cas took a deep breath. “I feel the same, I hope you know that.” Cas looked down at their joined hands, longing desperately to tell Dean just how much he valued his presence in his life. He was jolted back to that morning in Dean’s bathroom when he almost kissed him. What would have happened if Claire hadn’t interrupted him? Where would they be now?
“Yeah, just didn’t sleep great last night.” Dean didn’t want to tell Cas his sleep had been disturbed for a while now--the last time he’d slept really good, Cas had been in bed with him.
Dean screamed Cas’s name over and over, but he never came, he didn’t save him. Inky blackness began to replace the blinding white, and as Dean sunk back into unconsciousness, he sobbed Cas’s name one last time, even though he knew he’d been abandoned.
Something was rubbed into the bite on his shoulder and the world turned white hot. He screamed, the sound tearing itself from his already wrecked throat, sobbing, begging, praying for deliverance.
“You can call me Victor.” He claimed Dean’s mouth in a bruising kiss. Dean could barely breathe when Vic released his mouth, his heart pounding against his ribs. Vic slid down his body and popped Dean’s jeans open. “Gonna rock your world, sweetheart.”
“Hey. I just started another pot of coffee, you want some?” Sam asked pleasantly, setting Dean’s favorite mug on the table.
“Ok,” Dean nodded. He swallowed the rest of the doughnut, watching Cas move around the room. Fuck, but his ass looked amazing in those tailored black slacks. He needed to get out of Cas’s classroom asap. “I’m out. Gotta get some stuff together. See ya!” He made his escape, fully aware that Cas was watching him, probably wanted to say something, but the bell rang and the kids started heading into the school.
“Lydia Beiler.” She didn’t shake his hand and Cas felt a strange sense of satisfaction about that. “I’m going to go start a pot of coffee. Castiel, you can entertain your visitors in your rooms if you’d like.”
Dean whipped out his badge. “Agent Dean Lucas. This Steve, was he about my height, blue eyes, brown hair?”
Dean turned away from her, crossing his arms over his chest. “It’s complicated. Really fucking complicated.”
Dean sat at his desk, staring out the window as snow swirled in the air. Outside his door, he could hear the ruckus of the children getting ready to leave two hours early. He was waiting for Sam to come get him and Cas, since neither of their cars were fit for snow days. Sam always picked them up and took them home in his fancy hybrid SUV in bad weather.
En samevelaji coredazodizoda, en congamphlgh, en mononusa, ol aziazor elasa, ol aziazor elasa! - my righteous man, my soul, my heart, i love you, i love you!
It was like a dam broke and Dean shoved Cas’s coat from his shoulders. “This stupid black trench, so hot, Cas you don’t even know.” Cognizant of Dean’s arm, Cas pushed him up the stairs, leaving a trail of clothes in their wake. They shared increasingly filthy kisses on their journey up the stairs and by the time he carefully tumbled Dean onto his big bed, they’d managed to lose 90% of their clothes. Dean’s skin was hot enough to burn pressed against Cas’s own as he pulled him down on top of him with his left arm.
Something breaks in Dean and he forgets how embarrassed he is that Cas has seen what those pictures of memories - the real ones and the Michael-produced - hold. He throws himself into Cas’s arms and clings to him.
“Why not? It’s a nice, slow song so we don’t have to do anything special, just stand there and sway.”
Kissing Charlie softly on the cheek, Dorothy waved jauntily before turning to walk through the door.
The men at the table nodded their agreement, acceptance of the stranger in their midst made much easier by the bishop’s endorsement. They went back to their plates and conversations, while Castiel fell into an easy rapport with the bishop and Jacob.
“Yeah, and the pills ain’t doing shit. I just want to go home. Think we’ll have a snow day tomorrow?” he asked hopefully.
Ignoring the calls of friends as he navigated through lines of students on the way back to his class, Dean turned Charlie’s words over in his head. She’d said that they were both being ridiculous. Both. Not just Dean. Did that mean Cas had feelings for him too? But he wanted to see Meg again. He’d said that. The words came right out of his mouth.
“The beans are work intensive but worth it. Homemade cream of mushroom soup, homemade fried onions -” Dean’s stomach growled loudly and Cas cocked an eyebrow at him. “Skipped breakfast again?”
Dean parked his ‘67 Impala in one of the spots reserved for employees. He doubled checked to make sure his name badge was on straight and that his black polo shirt didn’t have the collar flipped.
“What? I don’t have it bad for Cas, what the fuck?” Dean sat straight up and scooched back against the headboard. “Who says I have it bad for Cas?”
“I would never, ever call you a disappointment.” Cain told Dean seriously, his voice warm and affectionate. “I might be disappointed that maybe you didn’t choose the path I would’ve chosen for you, but I am definitely not disappointed in you.”
Rolling onto his side, Cas curled into the fetal position, tugging his blankets close around him. He just wanted to go back to sleep and forget what he’d seen.
“Alright boys, let’s feast. Castiel, I know you despise me, but you’re just going to have to deal with me picking up the check,” Cain announced, pulling the door open and gesturing to a still gobsmacked Dean.
“You two are so loud the whole castle can hear you.” A short man with curly brown hair stepped into the room, a kind smile on his face. “Hello, Dean. I’m Castiel’s father. You can call me Chuck.”
Dean’s face is dry now, but the tear tracks remain, even if he can’t seem them. He knows they’re there. Some part of him knows he needs to just accept his fate and pray that Sam and Cas will get him out. It’s worse like this, however, and he feels like he’s going to lose his mind before they do. Before, it was easier. Michael created scenes, realities, let Dean think he was out even a time or two, but after the d’jinn incident, Dean’s pretty good at seeing holes in made up reality. He figured it out every time.
Dean just sort of collapses in on himself. He draws his knees up as tight as they’ll go and buries his face in his hands.
“Oh Cas,” Dean murmured. He wrapped a blanket around Cas’s shoulders. “How’d you get in here without me hearing? I was only in Claire’s room.”
“Uh, sorry to interrupt, fellas,” he gave them his most charming smile, “but did you say Steve Winchester?”
“I’m sorry. It’s just - I’ve been trying to ask since I met you. You’re pretty hot,” he blushed and chuckled self-consciously.
Sam and Cas made more amicable small talk as they headed out of school. Claire took Dean’s left hand and he smiled down at her. In the last several months, he’d come to love that little girl as much as he loved her uncle. Just one more reason he couldn’t let his feelings become known and risk the rejection and potential loss of Claire as well as Cas.
Even with all of that, and family traditions, not one person seemed the least bit put out that Sam and Dean weren’t cops. Cas wondered what his life would’ve been like without family members insisting that he join the Navy.
“But I promised Sam. I promised.” Cas shook his head. “I’ll have to leave him here. There’s no other choice. Even if he survives the ritual -”
“Thank you. There’s plenty, so please, eat all you want.” She motioned to a chair on the side of the long table, and Cas’s eyes took in the spread.
“Try impossible. I’m going to have to call in reinforcements for the upcoming concerts since my elbow is so fucked up, I’m probably going to a: need surgery, and b: wear this stupid thing until the end of February.”
Dean’s hands slipped off of Cas’s shoulders as Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’s neck, shuffling so that he was standing a little closer. Cas let his own hands slide off of Dean’s hips, wrapping his arms around Dean’s waist and pulling him close. Dean let his head fall onto Cas’s shoulder, and his awkward, rigid posture disappeared as he relaxed in Cas’s arms. He wondered if it felt as good to Dean as it did to him, just standing there moving to the music. Cas closed his eyes and turned his face, pressing his nose to Dean's soft hair and breathing in the scent of him.
“Hey--” Dean reached out with his left hand and grabbed Cas’s arm. “Number one, I didn’t say I wanted you to leave, and number two, I appreciate the hell out of you looking after me. Please don’t apologize, ok? I need you, dude. I can’t even shave without slicing up my face.”
shirt with a hole in one armpit. Vader was damn near invisible after a million and a half washings, but nothing Dean owned felt more like a hug than that stupid shirt.
“I will talk to him,” he told Charlie, “I swear I won’t just go in there and demand he come home. I won’t be that big of a dick.”
“I tried,” Castiel assured Captain Singer. “He was adamant that he be allowed to return. Dean insisted Sam would need him close by.”
Dean finished eating and set the tray aside. “I dunno. I look at my life and all I see is the money I’ve thrown at it over the years. Clothes, and a ridiculous house. Three cars, a boat I never even use. What the fuck am I doing?”
Kannscht du Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch schwetzer? - Can you speak Pennsylvania Dutch? (PA dutch is one of the names of the language the Amish speak. It's a mix of German and English and can be very confusing to both German and English speakers. It's also been verbally passed down and it can be very difficult to find accurate translations, something I found out the hard way writing this fic. I was lucky that the inspiration for Lydia Beiler was so kind and willing to help me with a lot of it!)
Not wanting to watch, but unable to look away, Cas quietly observed Victor and Dean’s embrace before they parted ways in the alley. He watched the Impala pull away before turning and heading back up to bed.
“I am actually low. I was going to hit the store tomorrow. I like your idea, and I’m happy to do the cooking.”
Nodding, Castiel pulled himself from the bed. He tugged on a pair of simple, loose pants laying across the bottom of the mattress before uncovering Dean and gently scooping him into his arms. Dean’s skin was hot against his own, the obvious effects of a high fever. He was clad in a plain white shift that clung to his sweat soaked skin. His limbs trembled violently.
They stumbled and pawed at each other’s clothes as they slowly made their way up the stairs. Vic lost his balance at the top, landing on Dean. He didn’t seem to care where they landed, too busy leaving a mark on Dean’s chest. Vic slid his hand under Dean’s shirt, and Dean gasped into his mouth when his fingers found a nipple.
“Dean are you still here?” The front door shut and the lock clicked in place. Keys skittered as they fell in the bowl next to the door.
He pulled the stopper from a whiskey bottle. “Yes, but she’s been moving herself in the last couple months.” He grabbed the glasses and paused. “Actually, she’s been doing it for almost six months now. Funny how much time pasts when you’re not as involved in the relationship as you thought.”
Meg snorted and choked on her coffee. “Jesus, Cas. You can’t joke like that when I’m in a precarious situation.”
“Keep telling yourself that, but you’ll have to make a decision soon. Before you know it she’ll be squealing whenever you past a jewelry store.”
NYC418: I don’t think I’ve experienced that, though I’ve stayed up for plenty of other reasons. Or just worked through the night.
“Because my parents nudged her my way. And as you and Gabe have put it so eloquently, when it comes to matters involving my parents I’m a dog avoiding a thwack on the nose with a newspaper.”
“Yeah, I wanna give this shop a chance. I know you and everyone else are concerned I’m gonna let it get to me, but it already has. If I don’t fight for it I’m always going to wonder if fighting would have kept the store open. If I fight I know I’ll have done everything in my power to keep the store open. And if we close, then we close. It’ll suck, a lot, but doing nothing guarantees the store’s closure.” Dean wet his lips. “I think it’s what my mom would have done. Fight for as long as she could and if it looked like it wasn’t going to work, make sure she could keep spreading her magic and love until the doors closed for the last time.” He snorted. “Jesus, I’m getting all sappy. Okay, I think that’s enough for one day. I’ll get the suggestions from Krissy and Kevin tomorrow. See what Charlie can do tonight.”
“Dean, listen. You’re just as good as your Mama. Don’t throw her up on a pedestal she didn’t ask for.” Bobby stood up and dragged his coat off the back. “You’re a good kid.
She patted his cheek. “I know, hun, but you never know. Anything, anything at all, you let me know.”
“My therapist is starting to think it’s been a significant amount of time. But the important thing is I want to change. And I think it’ll be for good.”
Castiel sighed and stared out the taxi window. The show had been April’s idea, but he didn’t mind indulging her. After the holidays, they rarely spent any time together, often missing each other in the morning. She still hadn’t sold her apartment, but spent most of her nights at his place. He should have corrected her back in September. He should have told her that he wasn’t comfortable living with her until they were married, but the sex embargo had almost been a breaking point in their relationship, so he didn’t want to poke the bear. It should have been his first clue.
Kevin backed up towards the counter. “I also need to talk about next Thursday. I’ve got a meeting with my advisor, so I won’t be able to come in at one. Is that okay?”
The bell chimed above the door leaving Dean alone. He sighed and stacked up the notebooks. He could put this off for another day. There was no reason to get it all done as fast as he could if it meant it wouldn’t be a solid plan. He bundled up in his coat and turned the lights off as he made his way to the entrance. He locked the door then pulled the gate down to lock it.
The barista called their names and Meg handed him his drink. Lots of chocolate. And peanut butter. “Well, you knew my parents have never been exactly warm.”
Claire glares down at him from her perch. Up above she’s like a judgy crow—long, blonde hair; shaved sides; and thick eyeliner. Her faint magnolia scent clashes with the way she presents herself and Cas can imagine her as a young girl—rejecting femininity, and later, her Omega presentation. “Whatever old man. Got a newspaper anywhere? Kaia and I thought about going to the movies tonight.”
He makes a half-hearted attempt to put the Scent-B-Gone bottle back on the shelf and bolts out of the door.
Okay, from anyone else Dean could accept that. But this was the guy who was currently pushing him towards closure. He snorted. “Yeah, I don’t think you’re gonna close your store any time soon. Thanks, but no thanks.”
Steve ushered the kids out the door and shut the balloons on the other side. The door opened again. “I’m glad that wasn’t the fish.” He bopped the balloons out the door and held tight to the string so they would follow. It was cute. And exactly the kind of interactions Dean knew they couldn’t replicate at Milton Books.
ImpalaGuy: No, it’s different than that. You just stay up running life scenarios in your mind and you realize shit and it’s hard to go back to sleep after an epiphany like that.
Do you ever do something and almost immediately regret it? I had that feeling tonight. I said something awful and hurtful to someone I barely know all because he insulted me. It’s irrational, but I still hold my parents opinion of me in high regard, so when I’m ever challenged over something they value in me I get incredibly defensive. I’m proud of my own achievements, I know I’m successful, but without their input it seems diminished. And their approval has turned me into an awful, achievement minded person. I’d like to apologize, but there is no way they would want to listen to me, that’s how bad I burned that bridge.
He turned around a corner and Golden Retriever bound towards him, leash dragged behind. “Where’s your owner?”
“Yeah, just let Krissy know. She should be able to cover for you and if not me and the old man will be here.” Dean shooed him off a final time and rested his hand on a low bookshelf.
But how would I get the withering comebacks to you in a timely fashion? Pigeon? IM? Morse Code? No, I think it’s safe to say for now, both of us have dug our graves and are settled in our caskets. Perhaps it will change in the future, I want it to change for me. I will promise you, the ability to dismiss someone with a witty zinger is not what it is all cracked up to be.
“Ok,” Cas muttered helplessly, settling back down in the bed. He rolled onto his left side to face Dean. Dean opened one green eye to peak at him and sent him a silly little grin.
“Alright.” Dean filled his spoon with some soup. The flavor burst across his tongue and he suddenly realized how hungry he really was. “Shit, Cas, this is great.”
“Nope,” Dean said, tossing a small version of the Impala in his box. “For the first time in a very long time, I feel like I know what I want. I’m getting out, Crowley. While I’m still young enough to change my life and get away from all of this.”
Dean lowered his head respectively. “I came on my own. No one needs to shed blood on my behalf. I’ve brought the gold and jewels of my dowry. Once we’re mated, Sam will give you the rest. Now, withdraw your troops. Send the dragons home.”
“That’s three words, but you’re right.” Aaron’s phone chimed and he looked at it, sighing as he read the message. “Dean, I have to go. It was really great to see you again.” He stood and Dean stood as well, not the least surprised when Aaron stepped around the table and pulled him into a hug.
>>Lisa says we can revisit the custody arrangement. She’s coming tomorrow to talk about it. Thanks for making me brave enough to ask.
“Yes ‘cause he says I can’t call him Mr. Novak at home, ‘cause it’s weird, so he said call him Uncle Cas like Claire does.”
Cas sighed and ran a hand through his hair, scratching along his horns. “I still don’t like it. Father is right, however. I have no right to deny you this.” He smiled at Dean. “But you’re flying with me.”
“It is delicious. I haven’t had a full meal in days.” Cas looked down at his empty plate. “I appreciate the kindness.”
“You wanted to talk, then talk. I’ve got chores to do and you can talk while I do them.” Using a knife, he cut a large piece of the black paper off the roll. “I have to wrap the hives. It’ll help the bees keep warm over the winter. I told Lydia I’d complete this task today, because it’s going to keep getting colder. The bees have to be protected.”
“Yeah, uh - ok.” Dean mumbled. “Make sure you get Kevin vegetarian. He’ll be back from Branson tonight.”
like a normal human being. Doc said his wrist was almost healed but his elbow had quite a ways to go.
He settled in at a table near the fireplace, in a soft, cozy armchair that he knew for a fact Dean had picked out. It was Cas’s favorite spot in Cas’s favorite coffee shop, but he was a million miles away and the ambiance was completely lost on him.
He finished his tea and wallowed in his misery, watching as the sunny cold January afternoon turned wet. Clouds rolled in and the sky opened up, dumping rain on his Continental. Sighing, he pulled out a few singles and left them on the table, throwing Aaron and Jo a weak smile and half hearted wave as he departed.
He got back to the table just as the waitress delivered their food, and Dean swallowed a wave of nausea.
Cas’s fingers trailed down his cheek, and Dean’s lips parted. “It is much smoother like this,” Cas murmured.
Cas’s grip on the bag tightened for a moment, but looking into Lydia’s kind brown eyes, he realized she truly meant him no harm and handed over the duffle.
“Ok.” Dean followed him back into the kitchen and sat his ass on the counter. “I want pie. Do we have pie? Fuck I love pie.”
“Daddy, Steve’s head went thump thump when he fell.” Ben looked so concerned and Dean had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing.
“Anytime,” she said, gently cupping his chin for a moment before turning and heading back to the kitchen.
Cas walked in, struggling with his ratty old trench and his messenger bag. “It’s snowing pretty hard and the kids got sent home early. I think it’s likely.”
At some point, Cas dropped off again, and woke to the smell of something burning and a string of cursing drifting up the stairs. He jumped out of bed and relieved himself before heading downstairs to find Dean glaring at a smoking pan, his normally clean stove covered in globs of pancake batter.
A short time later, Mary came to get Claire and they were off. Forgetting that Cain was at Dean’s, Cas let himself into Dean’s house through the backdoor. “Being a single father sucks,” he announced.
“That would be nice. She’s been wanting one.” Cas handed Claire’s book bag to Kat. “I already called out for tomorrow. I have a feeling I am going to be there awhile.”
“Sounds good.” Dean awkwardly picked up his fork with his left hand and stabbed a few pieces of pasta before realizing the grilled chicken was all one piece. He sighed. “Uh, Cas?” he asked, face flushing.
Dean shook his head. “Get in the car, Charlie, or I’ll leave you here.” He slid into the driver's seat and shut the door. Charlie got in as he started the car, arms crossed over her chest and a stormy look on her face. “We’re going to get him,” Dean told her firmly. “And I’ll talk to him, and listen to what he has to say, but I’m sure he’ll want to come back with us. Ok?”
As he said that, Dean went utterly rigid in Cas’s arms. Looking down at his beloved’s face, Cas almost dropped him in shock.
“It makes a lot of sense. I think you need to talk to Lisa. There has to be some sort of compromise you can reach that will allow you more time with your child.”
Trying everything he could not to have a massive breakdown right there in the middle of the parking lot, Cas caught sight of a truck carrying a load of baled hay, parked well out of the way of any streetlights. He could climb up and nestle down in the hay at least. Double checking to make sure no one was around, Cas quickly clambered up the side of the load, pleased to find a space just large enough for him to hunker down. Cut off from the wind, he found himself quite warm and comfortable, and in his utterly exhausted state, he quickly dropped into a deep sleep.
Dean bit his bottom lip. Fuck, how many times had he used that exact same reasoning to get someone into bed? Funny how it didn’t feel so good to be on the other end.
They were quiet as Cas drove them out of the city, quiet as he unlocked Dean’s door. He helped Dean out of his coat as the air between them grew inexplicably heavier. “I should go home,” Cas murmured.
Twenty minutes later he was picking Claire up from a harried Mary. “Would you mind going to Kat’s when we get home? Miss Jess is in labor and--”
“I’m sorry,” Cas said, helping Dean into his coat. “Can I take you out to lunch? My treat. Anywhere you want.”
“Ooh, what’s funny? Gotta be something good, since old Dean-o here looks about to explode!” He rubbed his hands together in gleeful anticipation.
“You shouldn’t be out of bed,” Cas shut the door behind him, his lips pulled into a frown. “You’re weak.”
Cas allowed Anna to settle him at the table and she fed him and Gadreel a hearty meal, while sending a messenger throughout the castle to rally the other dragons to the cause. In the end, Castiel would be leaving Anna and Gabriel behind to watch over Dean. The others were all coming with him.
Motivated by the idea of a hot lunch, Cas hopped up in the wagon, and he and Jacob spent the next hour dropping bales of hay around the pasture for the cows to eat.
Dean tucked Ben under a Creeper blanket. “Tomorrow, I’ll see if Uncle Sam can take us over to your house to get some more clothes for you.”
Standing, Crowley brushed nonexistent dust off of his flawless Armani. “Good luck, boy. Whatever it is you’re looking for, I do hope you find it.”
“I guess. Yeah. I dunno.” Fuck, he was sleepy. Dean was drifting further and further into Cas’s space. He lost track of time for a bit and when awareness came back around, he was stretched out on the couch, his head on a pillow in Cas’s lap. Gentle fingers were carding through his hair. Dean was warm, comfortable, and ridiculously content. At some point, Cas nudged him awake enough to swallow a pain pill and helped him up the stairs.
“Alright.” Lydia stood and cleaned up their dishes, taking them out to the sink. “Try and get some sleep, Castiel,” she said, resting a hand on his shoulder. “Morning will be here before you know it.” She kissed the top of his head and disappeared up the stairs.
“If you’re not happy, find what makes you happy. You deserve that much.” He stood on his tiptoes and kissed Dean on the cheek. “Be happy, Dean,” he smiled. Aaron turned on his heel and left, heading up the street, leaving Dean’s thoughts in turmoil.
Lisa was on the other side of the door. “Dean, I’m sorry, I have to take Steven to the hospital. He slipped on the ice and fell and says his head hurts--”
“I’ll help you.” More or less clean, Cas stepped forward and pulled Dean against his chest, resting his chin on Dean’s shoulder. “You can do anything you put your mind to, you know that? I’m so proud of you. You work so hard and you’re kicking ass in school.”
“Are you alright? You look a little pale.” Cas raised an eyebrow as he studied Dean. He held out a pink box from Mary’s bakery. “Doughnut?”
He passed the barn and headed up the hill towards the apiary, zipping his coat as he went. The bees were buzzing lazily around the hives, the cold snap in the air making them lethargic and sluggish. A roll of tar paper leaned up against one of the hives he’d already wrapped.
“Alright, well I’ve just about got lunch ready. Pull up an extra chair.” She smiled at Castiel. “Lydia Beiler.”
Victor grinned and grabbed Dean, wrapping him a bear hug that reminded him a lot of Benny for a second. Dean let himself be held for a moment. It felt nice, to have another man hug him. Yeah, Dean loved girls. He loved soft curves and pillowy boobs, he loved sweet smelling hair and red lips.
“I know,” Dean offered sincerely. “I do. And I am grateful. I swear. Just - this isn’t for me. I’m fooling myself into thinking I’m happy when I’m fucking miserable. I have to chase this dream now, while I’m still young enough to do it.”
A door clicked shut behind him, and Dean rolled onto his back, tears streaming down his face and dripping into his hair. Everything had happened so fast and now he was unmated once again. Despite Gabriel’s insistence that Cas still wanted him and all his talk of true mates, Dean couldn’t help but think of how weak Cas would undoubtedly see him now.
