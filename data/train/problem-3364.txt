“And you still didn’t kill me,” He said.
Dean?” His gaze was cold by the time he focused back on Dean. Even when looking at him from upside down Dean could tell how fragile Cas was in that moment, barely hanging on. “I don’t want you to make a joke of my advances.”
They reached Lebanon by mid-afternoon the next day.
He expected Cas to at least ask more questions, but all he did was tap at the picture with his fingernail, expression oddly taken aback.
The waitress, to her credit, hardly reacted. Her eyebrows gave the smallest jump, mouth parting just a breath, but the reaction wasn’t disgust. It wasn’t quiet resentment. It was just barely there surprise, sincere and kind in nature, smoothing over the wrinkles around her eyes.
Gentle thumbs traced the skin under his eyes, soft and warm where it left a trail of sparks down Dean’s cheekbones. There’s a wave that began to rise then, right in Dean’s stomach, clattering up his spine. Tears burned behind his eyelids and his body surged with emotion, all of it finally crashing when Cas said, “You’ve changed me, Dean. No matter how this ends, you have to remember that. For the both of us.”
It took minutes for Castiel’s naked body to finally register the cold nipping at its rib cage, searing down its sides. But once it did, it was all he could focus on, and getting somewhere warm was the only thing that mattered.
“No, no! That’s not what I meant,” Sam winced as Dean snickered, scowling until his face turned golden warm. “It’s uh, complicated I guess.”
He sounded genuine, terribly kind in that way he’d always been able to, and Dean felt something inside of him deflate. His hand tightened around the phone, a painful sort of terror making his fingers curl. He didn’t want to go.
“I already told you this is different. I know it is,” Dean said, eyes boring dead ahead as a car drove by with its bright lights on. “You just have to trust me.”
“Dean.”
Dean scrubbed at his eyes with the back of his hand, some part of him peeling to the surface, cracking with discomfort. There were a lot of things wrong. One of them being that Cas was in his passenger seat wearing track pants and slides, his jaw shadowed with facial hair, eyes tired and soft. He had his bandages off today, letting his face breathe, and his skin was just starting to get its color back.
Dean was quiet for a long moment, hands fumbling with the needle and stitching thread.
There was judgment in her voice, glaring and shrillful for a woman who sacrificed herself for the greater good. For
“Cut out?” Sam asked, and Dean could imagine he’d sound just as incredulous if he was able to get his breath back fast enough to speak. Sam turned to Dean. “What, like Anna?”
“There’s something wrong with him,” Dean said, only now realizing how breathless he was. “I mean he… his head is fried. His memories are screwed to hell,” Dean glanced towards the door again, drifting where he stood. His head wouldn’t stop pounding. “He doesn’t remember me, Sammy.”
“I’m an open book, man,” Dean rolled his eyes at the dubious look Cas gave him. Agitated, he let out a breath and said, “Whatever, look— it’s not possible, okay?”
“A good different, or a bad different?”
“I feel different.”
Dean watched him wordlessly, lips parting in awe at Cas's expression. It wasn’t everyday that Dean, now almost thirty-four years old, got to witness someone experience something as mundane as snow for the first time. And as someone who already struggled with keeping their eyes off of Cas, this was just downright humiliating, but Dean was almost at the point of not caring anymore.
“Seriously?” Dean asked, spinning around to glare at Sam. “Were you even listening to me just now?”
“Woah, there,” Dean pulled his hand out from the inside of his jacket, reaching for Cas’s thrashing body.
It calmed his nerves a little, to smile so genuinely. But the way Cas looked at him, watching carefully as lines formed in Dean’s cheeks, eyes wrinkling around the corners, had heat crawling up Dean’s ears.
Their shoulders brushed as they both settled, cloth to cloth, the heat extinguished, and Dean knew what he wanted— he just didn’t know how to ask for it. His moment of need had already passed, and it shouldn’t matter if Dean couldn’t feel Cas’s skin against his anymore. It shouldn’t matter that Cas wasn’t any closer than he was, and his warmth wasn’t a settled weight pressed to Dean’s back and strewn over his waist.
Dean pulled the sink drain and flicked the water from his arms, suddenly too irritated to wash dishes without Cas by his side. He dried himself off and made his way to the fridge for a beer, a phantom itch appearing at the base of his throat and the swell of his left shoulder where the press of a handprint used to be— not once, but twice.
had never stood a chance.
Jody sighed. “
And now they were alone, no Sam to bridge the gap. No Miracle to keep Dean sane or Eileen to make small talk. It was just Dean and his memories battling Cas’s empty head, a stretch of road in front of them and a plethora of ghosts at their back.
Dean looked at him from over his shoulder, unfazed. “What?”
Cas took his time ordering, eyes tracing down his menu with his teeth grazing his bottom lip, forehead creased with lines. There was a slouch in his posture, fingernails caked with dirt, but even then there was just too much about him that made Dean smile. A disheveled innocence that was adorable.
Dean flinched, eyes snapping upwards. “Cas—”
Something in Dean’s features finally shifted, an outcry of yearning making his anger look trifling in comparison.
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean said smugly, eyes filling with mirth when he caught Cas smiling behind his menu. “I’m taking your pie virginity, I get to be ridiculous.”
been, and the world won’t end if you put yourself before me for once.”
Rowena hummed thoughtfully. “
Dean’s brow pinched together with pain the longer he stood there hovering, limbs aching, not knowing what to say. He figured he’d gotten it down by now:
“Don’t worry about me,” Castiel said sharply, pushing past the topic as fast as possible. “How’s Sam?”
Starting from the bottom of Cas’s heel and working his way down, Dean managed to sew up two nasty cuts before speaking again.
“What I want is you safe,” Dean said, and he didn’t know any other way to explain it. Dean would give all of this up— the plan and the mission and the past, every second— if it meant knowing Cas would be safe.
Dean swallowed. He grabbed for the mess of cards at the center of the table and forced them into one neat stack, slapping them against the wooden top once before handing them over.
And so the lying began, and Dean didn’t even manage to last an hour before he was itching to get away.
“I remember the deal you made to save your brother,” Cas answered, effectively stealing the words from Dean’s mouth and turning his shock into panic. Cas gave him a pleading look, head shaking. “Don’t look at me like that. Please don’t look scared.”
“His name’s Cas, actually.”
When Sam didn’t say anything else, Dean finally turned to face him fully, eyes drawn with suspicion. He straightened his shoulders and stuffed a hand in his pocket, suddenly serious.
“Oh, yes, well,” Cas blew through a laugh, awkward as usual, dry with the delivery, but fuck if it didn’t make Dean smile. “I uh, I think it would be quite handy if I had a... lover to cut it for me.” Cas explained thoughtfully, head tilting to the side like a puppy, giving Dean a look that asked
“What do you use peanut butter for?”
“Uh huh,” Dean shook his head. “Look, I don’t know what’s giving you cold feet, but if there’s symptoms of something bigger here, we need to get a jump on whatever it is and get you help. Sam can—”
“I had my suspicions,” Cas said carefully, uncertain as to what Dean wanted to hear. He looked at Dean thoughtfully, the shadow of a smile breaching his eyes. “It’s only been a few days but, you want to know the thing I miss most about being an angel?”
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s said with sympathy. With a pair of hazel eyes drowned in unwavering guilt, but that didn’t make it better. It didn’t stop Dean’s heart from rising to his throat, burning up his insides.
Jack’s gaze never wavered. He was a kid with the world dancing in his fingertips, peeling in his palms, and he should have cracked under Dean’s harshness. But there was something simmering in his features, an inexplicable sense of calm that threw Dean completely.
“You will,” Dean said, and he hoped against everything that he wasn’t lying to Cas. “And hey— if not? We’ll go, you and me, anywhere you want. How’s that sound?”
But now Cas was there. Dean’s wish— he was
Dean jerked his head up towards the older woman leaning over the bar, notebook in hand. She was looking at Dean with her eyebrows raised over the rim of her glasses, bright yellow nails clicking at her pen.
In his other hand, a revolver appeared, slipping out of his holster smoothly. Lundy didn’t waste any time in pressing the barrel to Cas’s temple, jolting Dean up and out of his own body.
Dean felt something pierce his heart and unravel inside him, making itself at home, burrowing there deep.
“That’s not happening,” He snapped, and this time there’s no smile that accompanied him. There was nothing but Dean and the shake in his voice when he said, “I’ll tell him everything myself before I let him stay fucking brain dead, got it?”
Dean blinked up at him. He was only seconds away from mentioning how stupid Sam’s face looked upside down when he said, “Exactly.”
“Well, I…” Jack tilted his head, glancing towards Sam with uncertainty. Immediately, Sam gave him an encouraging nod, lips curling fondly, and Jack lit up from the inside out. “Yes,” He smiled, baring his teeth like a child. “I’m the claw machine.”
“Sam?” Dean choked out.
And yet none of that compared to the ache of loneliness that had lived in Dean during those four years without his brother.
Dean steeled himself, jaw tightening.
Things were different then. Things are different
“Cas!”
“A demon?” There was more confusion than fear in his voice, his reactions oddly controlled. Cas’s eyebrows rose curiously, lips parting
” Dean grabbed for his wrist, smiling all big and goofy and confusing Cas even more, his brow dipping further. “How many times do I have to say it? It’s okay.”
Castiel fumbled with the headphones looped around his neck, thumbs brushing over the padding on the inside. He reached for the Walkman tossed on the bed, bare legs scratching across soft sheets, and clicked one of the two latches on the side.
some idiotic plan that gets you killed instead of me, I will throw this fucking bowl in your face,” He growled, pinching the damned thing between two fingers and slamming it down onto the table. Cas didn’t even react to the milk that spilled out over his wrist. His eyes never left Dean’s. “No suicide missions, no demon deals. We find a safe solution, or there is no solution.
And then they were both at a loss, a memory drifting between them, silencing them. Dean could still feel the weight of Cas’s gaze, the nothingness that had been looking down at him in the crypt when Cas had beaten him to a bloody stain, angel blade in hand, heart somewhere else entirely.
Sam did his best to convince Dean to wake up Cas before they left, but the thought of seeing him had Dean itching with nerves, and he ended up leaving a note on the desk in his room and calling it a day. It wasn’t until Sam’s sulking lasted throughout the entire eight minutes of Boston’s
” Dean pursed his lips and let her breathe, giving her time. He couldn’t even be angry anymore; Claire deserved better than that. “
Cas was okay. He was alive. He hadn’t— he wasn’t—
“Dumb as shit? Yeah,” Dean gave him instead, grinning massively.
On the inside, Dean was on fire. Rightfully so. But on the outside, all he let escape was a single breath, a flash of relief that didn’t even begin to cover it.
Castiel met Dean’s eyes once he was finally standing on solid ground, confusion making his features tighten adorably when he asked, in complete seriousness, “Does that not sound the least bit outlandish to you?”
Dean heard more than he saw Eileen rise up on her toes and kiss Sam’s cheek. Sam melted into her gratefully, his free hand cupping the back of her elbow to hold her there for a moment longer, and Dean looked up at the ceiling, his mind bursting with colors.
“Then just go in and yank it out,” Dean yelled, his heart in his throat. “Forget the cat napping, and fight your way through!”
He remembered that home, however buried, was swept somewhere between leather seats and the silhouettes of two men beaming through the shadows.
“Dean made you,” Sam said simply, nodding at Cas with a tight lipped smile. “It’s kinda his thing.”
“I didn’t say that,” Dean shrugged. “But they always made your breath stink.”
“I’m referring to everything,” Dean shrugged. “But I’m guessing you don’t wanna take that deep of a plunge yet, so yeah. Let’s go with your Linda Blair level freak out.”
to calm down. She might be like he was, and not speak for even longer after that.
Just as Sam comes around the corner, Castiel has Dean’s head on his lap and strokes carefully over the other man’s cheek, since Dean couldn’t call him out for that right now. Sam falls to his knees next to them.
. If your health becomes affected by your choice to not consume what we give you, they will take you from the enclosure –”

the ivy.
Victor ruffles Dean’s hair. “Remember what it was like when you got here?”
They sat in silence, no noise passed between them, only the occasional hiss as Sam touched his shoulder for more blood. Dean closed his tired eyes. They had this small respite before chaos started again. He would savor it for all it was worth.
Sam sucked in a breath, running his hands over his face, “What do we do?” There was a beat of silence, hope wavering before Dean spoke.
. But only for a moment. Then everything goes back to neutral and expressionless as it looks back down at the flat thing in its hand. “… I know.”
Aside from a slight bowing of the legs, the skeletal scan already taken before they arrived has identified no physical deformities. In all aspects, 1-M-7 is an
“How long was I out?” Dean asks and rubs over his eyes. He feels so tired, even though he is sure he slept a lot, but that is what always happens when a Djinn feeds from you at the same time. Dean feels not only hurt, but weak as well. Seems like the Djinn got a lot of blood this time.
Once that is all finished, 1-M-7 returns to his camp under the trees. Castiel has not seen him since. After his first escape attempt, another camera was added in the back of the enclosure and focused on his tent. Eighteen days ago, 1-M-7 erected a new tent. This one is placed against the wall, though it does not cover the numerous markings tracking the number of days that he has been here. From what Castiel can tell, no one has investigated as to the purpose of the new tent. He has noticed, however, that 1-M-7 seems to be using it for storage. He is often bringing baskets or sticks inside.
Dean stared as the feathers caressed his arm and torso, the drag of them sending sparks down his skin. Dean raised a hand, ghosting over them. “Can I touch them?” Dean asked in a whisper.
Mother chooses when she believes is the best time to start the video. She starts it shortly after 1-M-7 has finished exploring the transition room. He seems surprised by the appearance of the screen, and even more startled when the video begins, which is to be expected. 1-M-7 approaches the screen, and it does not take him long to begin exhibiting
That’s when it hits him. He’s wearing these because the
The next thing Dean knows, he’s on the ground and one side of his face is stinging badly. His head is spinning, his mouth feels wet, and tears are already making his eyes go blurry. He wipes the back of his hand over his mouth, and it comes away with a streak of red. The hit was hard enough to split his lip.
Taking a shaky breath, Dean gathered his thoughts, “Things are too good right now Cas…” The angel tilted his head at him, questioning but not speaking so Dean continued, “Things are going right for once and I’m… I’m afraid that sooner or later, it’s all just gonna disappear.” Dean tried to think of more to say but he found that it was just that simple. He was afraid of losing all they’d fought for.
“I met one of the angels who fell. She seemed like she needed guidance and I… I wanted to help her— I
Dean had had about a million things rattling around in his mind.
Without another word, Patience joined the others. But it wasn’t until Jack’s eyes turned a crimson gold that Dean himself drew any closer, his heart nothing but a ceaseless drum as Jack pressed a hand to Castiel’s chest and drew in a labored breath, power pooling in the coat of his eyes.
” Sam dove forward and snatched the Impala’s keys from Dean’s pocket, succeeding before Dean’s vision could even try to catch up. He held them up in the air triumphantly, smirking, “—is that I’m driving.”
“Shut up.”
His hands trembled when he tore them off the wheel, eyebrows drawn into a confused furrow as he stared at Cas across the seat.
He just wasn’t sure there was anything he could do.
“Patience, sweetheart. The build up is important.” Dean teased, even going as far as winking at Cas with a charm he knew would be met with annoyance rather than infinite swooning.
Dean watched a shadow reach for him, and felt careful hands frame his jaw. Cas smiled at him, a flash of shocking white in the brittle dark, but with it came a silent tremor. A saddened curl to the shape of his bottom lip, and his eyes, which still crinkled no matter how he smiled, were just as mournful as they were fond.
Castiel tensed first and laughed second, dumbfounded. “I do not—”
Dean held his stomach desperately, trying to compose himself through gulps of air, but it was Cas reaching forward and carefully running his fingers through his hair that finally made Dean stop. It was almost funny how his laughter turned into dead silence, the situation much less amusing now that Cas was actually putting his words to use, touching Dean in a way that was unmistakably intimate.
Dean didn’t bother with an answer he didn't have. He forced movement into his limbs and fled to the sink, turning on the water with a jab of his hand. He pretended to care about the few dirty dishes taking up space, and eventually Sam left without another word, his footsteps lingering.
without death being as common as a winter cold.
It was impossible not to notice. Just like it was impossible not to hope, Dean’s heart jolting in his chest, eyebrows raising marginally the moment Castiel turned away.
“What place do you love the most?” Cas mumbled around a mouthful of Skittles, glancing up from their kitchen poker game to admire the way Dean looked at him through long eyelashes, barely even blinking.
The bunker got quiet shockingly fast and Dean started packing his duffel bag before he could talk himself out of it. Sam had found a possible Ghoul case in Texas, a ten-hour drive at the least if Dean really pushed it, and the two of them and Eileen were out on the road by sunrise the next day.
Dean forced the thought away, sobering up immediately at Cas’s words. He started the trek to his room, pushing past his door stoically to grab for the duffle under his bed.
“I, um,” Cas swallowed thickly, feet staggering back and forth. He didn’t know where to look, eyes darting between Dean and the opposite wall. “My shirt isn’t cooperating, as it seems.”
“Yeah, I know,” Sam scoffed, rolling his eyes. He brushed past Dean to step up to the woman at the front desk, nose pinched between his thumb and forefinger as he smiled grimly. “Hi, do you happen to have—”
“Just like with any angel who chooses to fall, Cas should still have a connection with his grace. A piece of it left behind,” Jack explained. The sleeves of his white-denim jacket were folded over the curve of his hands, just a little too big for him, and his fingers flocked to them for comfort, pulling and twisting every which way. “If I can tap into that source, I might be able to pull Cas’s grace out of the Empty and transfer it right back into him.”
” Cas admitted softly, searching, finding a feeling in his chest and latching on even if he didn’t understand it.
“Agents,” They both pulled away to stare at the chief of police with wide eyes, his posture awkwardly stiff. The man smiled at them politely, looking a little sorry to be interrupting. “What brings you here? S’ there something I don’t know about?”
“Cas!” He sat up and touched Cas on the shoulder. Dean wasn’t able to see his face, but his heart still dropped all the same when Castiel flinched violently, withdrawing.
Dean watched her silently after that, staring until his boots were clean and her fingers were red and she finally turned to him in the dark, her skin the same color of the moonlight pooling in around open blinds.
Cas nodded enthusiastically, a drop of shaving cream rolling off his cheek and onto his chest.
“Let’s hear it then,” He said, and Jack released a heavy breath, the height of his shoulders melting into something much more fragile.
Cas only smiled with his eyes this time, but somehow it burned just the same. “I know, Dean.”
They didn’t talk the rest of the way. Dean stared straight at the road and held himself together until they arrived at the nearest store. He parked crookedly in his hurry and got out without a word, scooping the keys up with him. The squeak of the passenger door opening was what finally made Dean stop short, eyes darting up.
“We’re about to pass Harvey County,” Sam said, and he flicked his eyes up to the rearview. His forehead wrinkled when he saw the look on Dean’s face. “Why?”
“Cas is gone, Dean.”
It was worth it, in the end. Dean’s heart might have been sinking towards his stomach, discomfort prickling his insides, but it was worth it just for the way Cas’s eyes seemed to soften.
“What are you planning?” He asked, unabashed judgment passing through his eyes as he watched Dean struggle for an answer.
Their eyes met, soft and meaningful, lingering in that god awful way it nearly always did. They were standing too close. That much was obvious, their chests nearly brushing, Dean’s boots just a breath away from Cas’s dress shoes.
“Back off, Smoothie King,” Dean slapped his brother away with a scowl.
He was the same Cas who spoke about the science of air balloons and microwavable meals as though he were talking about seeing stars implode. The same Cas who watched over Dean as he slept and rushed to the store to get pie if he saw the slightest frown on Dean’s face, the slightest indication of distress. The same Cas who disobeyed Heaven just to fight alongside him, who spent a year in Purgatory leading the Leviathans away just so that Dean could have a chance at living, at getting
It had always been there. Dean’s willingness to fight for himself, to accept that what he wanted was something— anything but this. Anything but a road with no ending and a family with no home and a long list of friends whose deaths still burn at the back of his eyelids every time he falls asleep. It’s only now, with his fate up in the air, his story being rewritten, that Dean was finally listening to any of it.
“That way you can figure out what place you love the most,” Dean said, maybe to add some sort of clarity, an excuse as to why he wanted this so badly, but Cas didn’t even react to the words.
His hand came back red, and he stumbled.
Dean thought he knew the answer.
“Because he’s Sam, and you’re
He looked at Dean like he was still the same Cas who made the mistake of falling in love.
cereal boxes, pulling Cas’s attention back to him. “Does this look like handling it to you? What’s with the cereal?”
“Yes, I’ve grown to like the sound of them. I found this in that drawer my first night here,” He gestured helpfully as he spoke, smiling tiredly but genuine. “I’m assuming it’s yours?”
In a half desperate attempt at getting somewhere, Sam began chanting Latin with a sharp tongue, forcing the syllables out fast and precise. It was a long shot and they both knew it, but Dean still couldn’t stop himself from crying out, “Sam!” when he saw his brother go flying backward into the wall, gun clattering to the ground as he gulped for air.
Dean nodded vaguely, eyes closing. That’s all he could do.
Tearing away from Cas and standing up hurt like a physical blow, but Dean’s panic was all-encompassing, whipping through him at a speed that was almost jarring.
“You’d think he was drinking battery acid with the way he spit that shit up.”
“Don’t be sorry,” Dean couldn’t look at him, his words nothing but a low grumble. “Just…”
“Oh,” He said, blinking in quick little ripples like a bird flapping its wings, his awareness zeroing in on his own eyes and the color within them. “That’s very kind of you, Dean.”
Sam was hugging him before he could pull away, loose and casual, trying not to make a big deal out of it, but Dean didn’t miss the severity behind it. They never hugged unless a Winchester death was waiting around the corner. That’s just the way it was, the way it had always been.
It’s Dean who had to pull away in the end. Not even for air or anything, but because Cas seemed to be a quick learner, and Dean was a little bit terrified of how good it felt just having Cas figure out how to press at the seam of Dean’s lips with his tongue, one of the hands at Dean’s chest slowly reaching down to find a hold on his waist.
Dean straightened as if caught, his arms stilling for the briefest moment before regaining their speed. Up down, up down— pain ease, pain ease. The point wasn't to make it hurt. The point was to feel the ache just enough to make Cas’s distance feel like a thumb prick in comparison; to make everything else seem irrelevant. But Dean had let his mind wander, and his mouth run, and Cas had managed to find his way back to Dean just like he always did.
It was somewhere between the smell of rain and the rush of adrenaline that the pain began.
And it was meant to be light hearted, but instead it just came out sad, Dean laughing painfully through it, for the sole reason that saying it any other way would have had him unraveling right then and there.
“Your alcohol tolerance is exceptional. It shouldn’t be difficult for you to—” Cas stopped when he saw the look on Dean’s face, lips parting with slow understanding. He shifted nervously. “Oh. Right. I won’t insist if it makes you uncomfortable.”
“I’ll be right back,” Sam insisted hastily, and just like that he was staggering away, making a direct beeline across the bar. He disappeared out the back door, the shadow of him swinging with the hinges.
question, answered.
“I wasn’t myself when I hurt you, Dean. There's still so much I haven't told you.” Castiel admitted, catching Dean’s gaze and dissecting it instantly, meeting it with a brush of reassurance.
Sam blew out a breath of air, mouth stretching into a thin line. “If that’s the case, he’s going to take forever to heal. How the hell are we gonna—”
All of Dean’s attention fell to his racing heart then, the drag of Cas's fingers over his scalp, down the back of his neck where he made Dean shiver and blush like a goddamn virgin. Cas was so gentle with it, with all of it. He touched Dean with a fondness that was unmatched, thought to be impossible.
It shouldn’t bother Dean, but there was a certain expectation now. A fake reality that had been bestowed upon him; a belief that once that door closed, once the dust settled and the lights dimmed, things between them could be as simple as holding each other in the dark.
He was human, and he was alive, and his name was Castiel. A name he couldn’t remember receiving, but felt right all the same.
Dean raised a stiff finger to the back of Sam’s head. “You take that back.”
“Small talk ain’t really your thing, buddy, but I’ll bite,” Dean straightened up, smiling to himself as he grounded out, “I’m doing fine Cas, how bout’ you?”
And it pulled at something in Sam’s winded chest, ripping at bone and muscle and broken strings. Rowena stilled for a moment, her breath even, and Sam could all but hear the way she was searching for him in the silence, wanting a sign that he was okay before she continued, “
It was Cas apologizing for not already knowing. It was Cas saying
Sam gave his brother a pained look, eyes closing briefly. “Don’t say that, man.”
“Hello,” He said, gruff and proper, his voice even deeper with disuse, and all Dean could think was that he looked just fine.
“Are you sure?” Sam asked, leaning in to make sure Eileen could see him speak. Or maybe just leaning in to lean in, pressing closer. “You got him?”
They shared matching smiles, and Dean finally found the heart to move away from Cas’s side, approaching her instead. He gripped her by the shoulder, wanting nothing more than to appear comforting.
way that Dean had never in his entire life fallen victim to.
“Sam’s fine, Cas. We’re both back at the bunker. Now can you tell me where you are? I’m coming to get you.”
“Well, fuck you, first of all.” Dean shrugged, yanking his plate back over with a scowl and shoveling a forkful of pie into his mouth carelessly.
“I think I know what you mean,” Cas nodded, thoughtful. “I have no memory of anything before waking up in that park. It’s all just… black. Far away. And even when I try to remember it— it’s not—” Castiel inhaled harshly. “It’s painful,” He said, voice thick and weighted, dragged in from a great distance. “I can make do with not knowing anyone or anything around me. It's not knowing myself that’s proven difficult.”
Dean didn’t even have to study the disappointed edge of her features to understand exactly what she meant. It was unsettling, to say the least. Trying to see Chuck in every pull of skin and stretch of teeth, half expecting his voice to come out instead of Jack’s, his essence boiling beneath borrowed skin.
Dean winced. “Cas doesn’t need me.”
Cas glared at him, though the heat of it simmered down almost instantly. It turned into a gradual pout, forehead wrinkling, bottom lip jutting outwards. Dean nearly smiled.
“The more I remember, the worse I get,” Castiel explained, stating it as if Dean should have figured it out by now, and that it didn’t make sense for his breath to seize the way it did. Cas’s lips cracked with a broken smile, and he said, “My life is indefinite, and my death is inevitable. Isn’t that something?” His voice split through a laugh. The hand at Dean’s wrist moved to his shirt, fingers curling. “Isn’t that just fucking
Sam shook his head. “What happened to going to the beach? Toes in the sand retirement, hanging it up for good. Don’t you still want that?”
“I'm going to continue sitting on your car now." Cas announced slowly, voice plain and dry, and a panicked laugh bubbled up from Dean's chest at the sight of Cas crawling back up the hood.
“I love you more than anything,” Castiel sighed, almost like it was a drag, the biggest nuisance in the world, but his eyes said differently. Dean knew differently. “Does that suffice?”
Dean picked up the unknown number with a frown, voice rough, “Who is this?”
Dean couldn’t accept that. He shook his head.
The world was managing without them, taking its own steps, and Dean didn’t feel guilty for wishing he could have this. Not anymore.
Dean still didn’t understand any of what happened that day.
“Alright, how bout’ we find the nearest diner and go to town on those new taste buds of yours, huh? How does that sound?” Dean asked, grinning over his shoulder as he started the car and turned back to check for traffic, hand gripping the top of the seat.
Even this version of Cas, the version where they were strangers, had Dean enamored by every move he made.
Dean thought he understood well enough. Although to Dean, it was hard to think of anything worse than forgetting his family.
“You must be very persuasive,” Cas said, handing the wallet back with his eyes lowered.
“You’re… I don’t know— you’re you,” Dean finished lamely before shaking his head, shoulders dropping. He didn’t know what he was saying. “You haven’t changed much. I thought maybe with all that happened with Metatron, with the angels… being human. I figured you’d be different.”
” Cas said, bewildered. “
Dean could feel weight in the silence that followed, uncertainty settling heavy in Sam’s eyes. Their fingers tangled together in the darkness, smooth as water, as warm as sun bathed sand, and Dean stared with a tightness spreading in his throat.
“What’s your favorite color?” Cas asked while Dean was working under the Impala, his voice somewhere close to Dean’s feet where he was twisting awkwardly just to look at Dean from underneath the car.
“Then that’s even more of a reason to get you the hell out of Dodge and fast. Tell me where you are.” Dean said, making sure to listen carefully even as he chucked a couple shirts and a pair of jeans into his bag, searching for underwear.
” Castiel started, “
“Maybe I should have just stayed at the bunker,” Eileen said, frowning. “I didn’t know you’d have to call someone.”
Dean weighed the moment carefully, fear gripping his insides. His vision narrowed.
“Like you said,” Cas fixed him with a knowing look. “There are some people who wouldn’t see Charlie like you do. They would view her as something less, something not meant to exist. But not you.” He shook his head and averted his eyes, quickly. It was disappointing at first, but Dean soon became thankful that Cas wasn’t looking right at him when he said, “you have this ability to make people feel loved, Dean. It’s rather extraordinary.”
“Good thing I showed up when I did then, huh?” Dean pushed himself up onto the counter beside the sink, swearing inelegantly when he knocked his ankle against the bottom. His feet started swinging before he could help it, a subtle left and right that had him bumping against Cas’s thigh. “I see you finally got your hands on the bumblebee bottoms,” He noticed innocently, before lowering his voice to say, “I knew I should’ve burned those things.”
Dean stamped down a sudden swarm of guilt, head spinning.
He heard
“Try and be quick. Humans aren’t meant to reside in the Empty, it’ll be difficult to keep you there. Oh, and also,” His lips pursed, a painful burst of words drawing back behind the tide, but Dean knew. Sam and Dean both did, and when they smiled at Jack, tight-lipped and brewing with unspoken emotion, Jack finally bit out, “Be careful.”
“Claire Novak,” Dean grinned. “Wannabe badass, full-time smartass— how’ve you been?”
And wasn’t that just fucking terrifying?
The woman gave Dean an odd look, unconvinced, but she nodded anyway. “Mmh, alright then,” She shrugged, and Dean watched as she disappeared back into the kitchen with a swing of her hips, whistling as she went.
Dean shrugged. “Alright, a beer then.”
more than he’s ever wanted anything, but Cas pulled away before Dean could think to make anything of the moment.
” Cas said after a stalled moment of nothing, Dean breathing shallowly on the other end. “
It wasn’t uncommon for Cas to leave out of nowhere. No explanation, no warning just- gone. But having Cas disappear on him right then, in that moment, when he’d been teetering on the edge of something dangerous, had Dean taking every single one of his feelings and guarding them back towards his chest.
” Cas said, impassioned, brimming with a word Dean didn’t dare think about, and the two fell into a heavy silence. Dean could hear the way his throat stuck as he swallowed, knuckles brushing over the outside of his thigh.
The grand reveal finally happened! Did any of you guess it right? So much happened in this chapter, and I got to write so many scenes that I desperately wanted to see in the show, especially that Sam and Dean talk about the future. It needed to happen, so fuck it- it DID happen. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.
Dean waited patiently for more; sat there with a hunched back and flitting eyes, needing Cas to give him
“I’ve always had plenty of things to have nightmares about. It’s just never really mattered until now.”
There was a ring, a distant hum, and then every lightbulb in the room was sent bursting into a shower of sparks.
One second, Castiel was floating. Stoking through fire and light and feather-black blood— and in the next, he found himself thrown back on a patch of grass that cut fresh pain into his elbows. He spun through distortion, a river thrashing in his stomach. It felt like years until his vision finally stopped rattling, and he stared up at a sky that hadn’t known he was coming.
Dean didn’t answer. He frowned as he typed out a response and pressed send, leaning back in his seat.
But other times…”
If Eileen felt any sense of sadness watching Castiel glance over at her as if it were the first time, she didn’t show it. Not even the state of Cas’s face seemed to faze her. She stayed smiling even when Cas shook her hand with a light bow, completely oblivious to the knowledge that he’d met Eileen months ago.
Chief Lundy hummed. “Dark-haired, sad lookin’ fella? Blue eyes?”
And for a brief moment, it was Cas again. Through and through.
Sam and Dean looked at each other from over the roof of the car, locking eyes simultaneously. Eileen stared wildly as they broke at the same time. Their laughter blended, knocking through the air in high and low, soft and ruthless, and it drifted through open windows down I-79 as the three of them sped their way towards Kansas soil.
“Nope, that’s my line. It’s time for you to man up.”
Dean slapped a five dollar bill into Cas’s hand, the sound of it crumbling loud in the quietness. He turned back around to finish folding up Cas’s clothes before the other could respond, missing the way Cas stared down at the money in slight offense, mouth opening in shock.
my best friend.”
Dean couldn’t help it. He knew he was grinning ear to ear. He raised a hand and brushed a finger over Cas’s stubbly cheek like he’d done in Purgatory, eyebrows raising in surprise at how much had grown in just a few days.
"Son of a-!" Dean growled as he pressed tensely against the brake, pulling off to the side of the road with hard eyes and gnarled lips.
He’d make two cups of coffee without a word and carry it to Dean with focused eyes and a wobbly stature that nearly had Dean going, “thanks, sweetheart” every time he took the mug from his hands.
“Dean,” Castiel slid his fingers up the length of Dean’s arm, cradling the man’s wrist with this look that tore Dean right open. He smiled, absolutely breathtaking and whispered, “Please.”
Dean couldn’t even be mad at him.
The bite in his voice echoed sharply in the walls of the garage. Cas didn’t flinch, but Dean thought he saw something crack in his features, guilt slithering in. Dean tried not to think about just how familiar that expression looked on him.
Sam snorted into the rim of his beer and curled back in his seat, laughing in that way he almost never did, indecent and boyish and loud, head tilted back and beer dripping down his chin. He leaned towards Dean while Eileen moved for Cas, her smile infectious enough to make Cas turn to her with a smile of his own when she touched his arm, even if he had no idea why Dean was suddenly glaring down at the table with his jaw set, blushing furiously.
He took a few deep, slow breaths. In and out, calmer after the first, shakier after the second. He leaned further against the door, wanting some fresh air, but the force of it was brutally cold and he ended up wincing at the pain of it before quickly rolling the windows back up.
thinking about him, never stopped praying to empty rooms and pushing through random bursts of anger that came and left without reason, all the hate and love and
“I’m too late.”
“He’s not an angel anymore.”
He gave Sam the jar of lamb's blood, handing it over without looking at him, and Sam moved quickly, unscrewing the lid to pour a generous amount into the bowl on the table. The red pooled in around shards of bone and crystal Dean didn’t recognize, and he peered into the bowl with his breath held, the smell of salt and vinegar making his nose itch.
“Eager much?”
“For starters, yeah.”
It’s obvious Cas was lost to Dean’s voice, his fingers curled vehemently into the bedding, but there wasn’t much else he could do but nod painfully and say, “Yes, I understand.”
Dean stiffened, head shaking as he blurted, “You can’t bring Claire.”
There was that honesty again, the same chest woven pain from last night that Dean had been forced to squint at in the darkness.
It wasn’t until Miracle finally broke free and started licking at the wound on Cas’s face that Dean stepped in. He pushed Miracle to the side with a light scold and patted at his backside until he eventually trotted over to Sam and Eileen, his tail never falling still.
missed you, and you finally came back only to take off again the second we turned our backs because you don’t know how to look us in the eyes anymore.”
“Woah, hey! Watch the head, alright? I ain’t a jungle gym,” He laughed, but he adjusted his arms to hold her tighter anyway, hardly even noticing the way the bunker’s lights seemed to glare in his peripheral.
“Jack?” The silence became impossibly tighter, Dean’s voice only highlighting the vastness of it. He dropped his head, eyebrows pinching. “Kid, if there was ever a chance for you to fix things— and I mean
It was almost funny how fast everything lurched to a stand still, Dean staring at Sam as if he’d just been slapped. Sam was too shocked to do anything but stare back, mouth cracked open, but there was a timorous edge that seemed to crash over him like a freezing wave, slithering in to send his expression melting.
“I most certainly do get embarrassed,” He frowned. Then, offhandedly, “
“Just… different,” Cas frowned down at the bedding, his voice nothing but a low rumble. His hair was dripping over his forehead now, flared out over the shell of his ears, and Dean fought against the glaring urge to fix it.
It’s not a threat. It’s an agreement, a promise that was sealed the moment Cas bent forward and kissed Dean sweetly, the hint of a smile still tugging at the corners of his mouth.
Sam rounded the hospital room door with suspicion, features pulled down in a way that told Dean he was trying very hard not to show what he was thinking. He peered through the tiny window at the top of the door, determined not to react, but it was impossible to miss the way his face bloomed with relief, eyes widening just a fraction.
He was already half asleep by the time Dean made it out the door.
Dean didn’t even have time to think before he was scrambling forward on shaky knees, choking back tears. He picked up the overshirt with trembling hands. His thumb brushed over the patch of dry blood at the shoulder, the color distorted with age now, cemented into the stitching of the fabric almost like a brand.
“Jesus,” Dean scrubbed a hand down his face. “Cas, did you even read the note I left you?”
The lie tasted vile on Dean’s tongue. It surfaced as a pounding in his head and a stone in his ribcage, a pressure that refused to let Dean forget about the quiet corner he’d learned to drift towards when the going got too tough, or the alcohol worked too well. The place in Dean’s mind where retirement was inevitable and the guilt of leaving the life wasn’t enough to stop him. The place where Dean got to sleep in and kick back and kiss Cas and
“We were working a case together in Dodge City when I took this,” He said.
“This,” He took Cas’s hand again, and guided him until he was cradling Dean’s face, trapping in the man’s heated blush with his palm. “All of it. Everything.”
“Yeah, well,” Dean’s smile was mangled. The sound of stretch tape pierced the air as Dean secured the wrappings, making sure to stay clear of his eye and hairline. “You
discovery before locking it all away. The questions, the dreaded
It’s the way Sam said it, with his voice scraped raw and his jaw locked tight that made the knot in Dean’s chest slowly begin to unravel, splintering outwards and shriveling up. Reality settled high on his shoulders, washing the anger away, and Dean’s eyes drifted to the motionless body across the room.
Cas looked close to refusing him, a mischievous smile pulling at the seam of his lips, but there was really no debate. Cas handed a few pieces to Dean, fingers brushing over the palm of his hand.
“Why?”
And maybe it was the darkness that was making him brave, or it was the finality, the impending doom hanging over them, but Dean placed a shaky hand over Castiel’s cheek and didn’t think about whether a star would implode as a result.
And so it was nothing.
“It means there’s a reason why no angel has ever attempted what Cas did,” Jack stood up abruptly, his tone reshaping. He looked between the both of them. “It means we do the plan. Now. You two need to go into the Empty and find Castiel’s grace before it’s too late.”
that, and more than anything he wanted it with Cas.
“Well, we’re almost out, and I’m going on a supply run,” Dean thought the implication was plenty clear enough, but when Cas didn’t respond, his confusion loud even through speaker phone, Dean strapped himself in and said, “I… was thinking you could come with me? Only if you want to, obviously.”
“If we don’t do this now, Cas
He just looked like a broken son.
“I’ve been feeling better, man, don’t worry. Besides, the booze will help,” He said, slapping the leather seat with a grin.
But when Cas reached out a hand to Dean’s shoulder, the first time in his eyes but the millionth time for Dean— Dean thought he might just unravel anyway. It would be easy with the way Cas was looking at him, easy with how Dean’s heart chose to sky-rocket into the stratosphere and how fast the warmth behind his eyelids became painful to keep at bay.
“Excuse me, Dean,” Cas mumbled to his right, reaching over the kitchen sink and Dean’s soap-soaked arms to grab at a towel.
“A couple of years now. Give or take,” Eileen said, her vagueness making Sam stifle a laugh.
“Thank you,” Cas said, the words shaping into a whisper. Cas’s grip on Dean tightened, trembling with sincerity. “For the scarf but— but for everything else too. For coming after me and being with me while I’m… like this. You didn’t have to. You and Sam don’t owe me anything and yet you’re here. Thank you.”
“I’m afraid of losing everybody.” Dean insisted.
“Believe me, it’s not that easy,” He said.
It made Dean miss the days when he thought he didn’t deserve something more. Something like what Sam and Eileen had, because at least then he didn’t risk having his joy for them swallowed by a selfish need to have the same thing.
Until it wasn’t. Until the symbol behind it became one of betrayal rather than loyalty. Until the world turned dark and the Apocalypse reared high and Dean couldn’t even wear it without it burning a hole straight through his chest.
“Blue,” He shrugged.
There was a time when doing this— praying, falling to his knees with desperation dragging him to the floor— was less preferable than anything Dean could imagine.
Then, almost tactical, Cas let out a breath, and the warmth of it fanned out across Dean's lips, leaving the skin warm and buzzing, his heart stuttering in place.
Eileen frowned, and slowly dropped her hand.
Dean stared at him, open-mouthed and glassy, feeling close to tipping over one edge or another.
He hovered next to the bed, uncertain. “You, uh— you doing okay?”
Sam blinked at him, mouth ajar. “It’s been a week, Dean.”
It’s his only thought. His only anything.
He didn’t know if he could do this without Sam. He’d never even tried to. All Dean knew was that it felt like Sam was trying to leave him all over again, and someone should be screaming, Dean thought. Someone should be breaking shit or throwing punches, but maybe things really
Eileen stepped in beside Dean, smiling gently.
changed, because what inevitably came was an embrace that Dean didn’t think either of them had been ready for.
It was his own voice that rang back to him, and with it came a drilling silence that made the bruise at Dean’s temple pulse with pain. Wetness seeped into his eyes, clumping in his lashes and sliding past his nose where it bubbled at his lips, gurgled in his throat. Dean blinked through it and brushed the sensation away with a shaky palm.
Dean let those words wash over him, vague and distant, muffled with painstaking refusal. He allowed it, but only for a second, and then he was looking at Sam frantically, searching his gaze.
It hurt just to look at him, even now. Alive and present but terse and doubtful, his essence oozing power while his body drowned in clothing. Jack had become something unfathomable, a child whose blood could send the Earth quaking, whose mind and body and soul didn’t align, and Sam didn’t know how to talk to him. How to look at him without instantly wanting to break apart.
He didn’t think about any of it.
Sam pulled the front door closed and checked the lock, duffel bag bumping against his hip as he moved. He came up behind Cas with an amused smile, clapping a hand on his shoulder to get him to start making his way down.
Dean wanted to punch the kid in the goddamn face. Maybe give him a bloody nose that he’d whisk away with a wave of his hand— whatever. Dean still thought it’d be satisfying enough. He deserved it. But Dean also wanted to hug the fucking guy, to see Jack with his own two eyes and have them all together again.
“Cas’s shirt was off.”
“That won’t be an issue,” Dean interrupted, voice hard. He couldn’t explain any further than that, not with Cas there, but Patience seemed to understand well enough. She gave Dean a small nod, even managing a smile when he said, “You can do this, kid. You’re ready. And, hey, if it doesn’t work out? We’ll still take you out for ice cream or somethin’, no hard feelings.”
Jack looked like anything but God at that moment. There was power in the way in which he breathed, deep and raged, sorrow filling in the cracks, but everything else was strikingly human. The shake in his hands was back, and the shine in his eyes was unmistakable.
He only raised his head when he heard the crackling of distant music, the rift of a guitar solo that made his chest kick with confusion and excitement all at once. Dean looked at Cas from across the room, hand hovering over the door knob.
They were supposed to be waiting for Cas to get better, for the after-effects of the connection to fade and for Dean’s presence to heal what had broken, but Castiel was right. Something was different. Something was
Slowly, Dean circled his arms around Castiel’s waist, pressing his forehead to the back of his hair, and he felt Cas shutter around him. There was a heartbeat pounding away against Dean’s palm, right at the center of Cas’s abdomen, and when Cas reached down to cover Dean’s hand with his own, sliding their fingers together, it was Dean’s turn to flush and burst apart, emotion rendering him useless.
Dean knew he did. Cas knew that Dean knew he did.
“With Cas,” Sam persisted. “You’ve told me almost nothing about what happened with you two when Billie cornered you. All I know is that—”
Cas hadn’t been able to say anything before Sam was returning from the restroom, sliding back into the booth alongside Dean. But Dean had looked at Cas and understood perfectly what it meant when the angel stashed the tape in his trench coat with a hidden smile, his head bowed shyly.
“Guess that means you like me too,” Dean said dumbly, blinking and blinking and
Cas hesitated. “Are you sure that’s a good idea?”
“Turn around,” He made a twirling motion with his finger, ignoring the gradual rise of panic building behind his rib cage.
“This is different,” Dean said sharply, ignoring the sobering look that overtook Sam’s features, confidence wavering. “He didn’t lose his memories the last time he came back from the Empty. He was practically fully charged, wings and everything. Now he’s…”
“There’s been a change of plans,” Sam frowned, voice low like he was expecting to be scolded, but Eileen barely reacted.
what he was doing, how crazy this all was and how there wasn’t a chance in the world that Dean would deny him anything.
Castiel slowly slid off the plastic wrapped seat, his face a blatant mix of pain and embarrassment. His body looked like it was mangled to hell with the way Cas was standing; back hunched over, arms curled into his chest like he’d just been assaulted.
“I wouldn’t know. We’re not supposed to talk about it, remember?” He threw Sam a pointed look from over his shoulder, the entire left side of his face glowing as he peered inside the fridge.
Dean looked at Castiel, voice soft, “You want me to give you a counting start, or…”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean snatched them up and pushed them over the bridge of his nose before he could think better of it, and the relief was overwhelming. He slumped against the Impala.
Castiel sat up in his hospital bed with a start, their arrival just violent enough to startle him. His fingers clutched at the bedding nervously, gaze uncertain as he gingerly pulled the comforter up to his chin.
It didn’t seem to fully hit Cas until he spoke the words aloud, and then he was looking at Dean with a newfound light, a fervor that hadn’t been there before. Happiness rose in his face like beacons of color, his scar stretching to accommodate, and Dean felt his eyes fill with tears.
“I don’t want to risk, um, how do you humans put it? ‘Killing the mood’?” Cas made quotations with his fingers and everything, the sarcasm in it forcing a smile out of Dean. Adorable. Cas was fucking adorable. “But, I’m very curious why it was now of all times that you decided to pursue me.”
and you—” He drawled himself back, shaking from the effort to stay standing. “Not without
“Your desires,” Dean repeated slowly, looking Castiel dead in the eye. Cas mostly remained calm, but damn did human Cas blush easily, the color spreading like wildfire. “Do you… I mean I’m sure you do
“I figured you pity me enough as it is. Why make it worse?”
All three of them climbed out of the car with matching groans and aching backs, Cas still half asleep as he shuffled towards the bunker door in a pair of flip flops Dean had pulled out from under the weapons bed with Sam laughing in his ear.
It wasn’t intentional. It wasn’t planned. Dean had been doing his damndest to not even think about the kid. But after waking up trembling in a mask of his own sweat, the sight of black tar and charred Earth still running havoc down the skin of his eyelids, Dean didn't even need hope to pull himself out of bed and stagger towards his nightstand.
“Since Jessica, man. Since forever. I’ve tried, sure, but it was always me just trying to move on. It was never something I actually wanted,” He reasoned. Dean almost had the nerve to argue with him, but Sam smiled before he could get the chance, stopping Dean in an instant. “My freedom from Chuck is still helping people, helping other hunters. I’m not ready to give that up.”
rather than
“I mean I—” Cas faltered, frustration brimming in his eyes. “I get memories, Dean. But they’re more feelings than memories really, recollections without context. Flashes of before that— that come and go, sometimes so fast I don’t even realize it. But it’s all so hard to comprehend and I don’t understand it.”
It had been over an hour since Cas had abandoned his seat belt to lay down in the backseat of the Impala, and even longer since he’d spoken a word.
“I’m not eating Frosted Flakes. Your joke is irrelevant,” He said flatly, shoveling in another spoonful without pause. Slowly, Dean came to a stop in the middle of the kitchen, slippers and all.
It was nothing but four walls and a roof that protected him and sheltered him but never
“I don’t wanna hear it.”
“No, it’s because you feel guilty,” Sam corrected, fixing Jack with a look that had him bristling as if caught, his eyes flickering.
“Damn it, Cas. Are you hearing yourself? There’s a war on, and it’s on you,” Dean gritted. “You said you lost your grace, right? That means you’re human. That means you bleed and you eat and you sleep— all the things you never had to worry about before!”
“That’s supposed to be my job,” Cas let out something similar to a laugh, but without the amusement. Without the joy, the sound of it sucking all the air out of the room. “Without my grace I’m not much use to you and Sam, am I?”
Dean wanted to heave, an ocean swirling in his lungs.
” and collapsed as if his knees had been kicked out from beneath him.
His entire body softened, lungs giving in, and he squeezed the angel’s hand. Castiel lit up at Dean's acceptance, cheeks flushing red, and Dean smiled fondly as he was helped up and onto the car, the lingering warmth of Cas’s hands suddenly more exciting than terrifying.
Dean’s eyes shot open, mouth gaping awkwardly. There was a painful stretch of silence before Dean asked, “You busy?”
At first, it registered slowly; like molten rock spilling into his ears, warming his core from the inside.
but damn it if his heart didn’t give an undignified flip first.
“That’s… actually delicious.”
Dean laughed into the curve of Cas’s cheek, drawing him closer by slinging an arm around the back of his neck. It was bizarre how easy it was for him to accept this, fall into this dream come true as though he’d been living his truth since day one, but Dean took it in stride.
But the more that Castiel scrolls through his lesson, the more that it stresses that opinionated and vocal Sapien Sympathizers do not do well in their chosen careers. They will be passed over for promotions, assigned lackluster projects, and are otherwise seen as
The library is empty and Castiel can’t find anyone in the kitchen either. Just as he walks back to the entrance to look for Dean in the garage, he hears a little click.
That alone means that he’s not going to eat any of the
“Yeah but, Dean is not. He… he fell asleep, can’t wake up on his own and he is not the only one, almost the whole town is asleep.” Sam stammers and Castiel feels the same pain Sam does. Castiel presses his fingers against Dean’s forehead, trying to get him to wake up, but Dean doesn’t react at all.
However, he is not holding out any hope that 1-M-7 and F-3 will mate when they are older. This is still better than nothing.
Dean exhaled slowly as he pondered. “Well whatever, we should get moving. And —” he grabbed his bag out of Cas’s hand, “— we’ll be needing flashlights.”
. Dean huffs loudly and crosses his arms, settling in the corner and facing the
He could tell Cas how absolutely badass he was in his trueform, how beautiful. He could tell him how his wings burned like starlight and how his voice was music to Dean’s ears when he was gentle with him. He could ask about their connection… and about the kiss.
“How!?” Dean nearly screamed as he jumped at the shadows that seemed to be crawling towards him, their hands stretching out to him.
“Mother Nature’s a bitch,” Dean muttered before taking a mouthful of turkey sandwich he’d squished into his bag.
Cas paused for a moment once Dean was completely freed, showing the same admiration Dean had shown him, but to Dean’s surprise Cas leaned forward and Dean gasped as Cas’s hands were suddenly brushing down his stomach to his groin and his thighs.

itchy if you touch it. He kinda knows the good plants too, like the white flower with a yellow middle that Dean has seen the grown-ups boil into a calming tea, or mash into a paste to put on swelling and make it better.
His reflection sighed and Dean felt the breeze wash over the chapel, making the wind howl. “

“Hey it’s okay. Of course I will always know the real you, how could I not?” Dean promises and he smiles at his angel. Castiel takes a deep breath but nods, he seems really upset about this.
Most notably, it has been documented that there is a significant difference in habits from what has been observed of the specimens in their home environment versus in captivity, including a difference in tribe hierarchies. To Castiel’s understanding, many also exhibit the characteristics of being traumatized.
looking forward to the day he would get to see where everything came from in person.
don’t like being separated, so both have gotten better about bothering him.
There are maps in his family tree drawn on rolls of hide with charcoal. Dean wants to do enough exploring when he grows up to have to make a whole new map to include all the new land that he’ll find. He wants to go
With a clatter loud enough to be heard across the clearing, the rolls of ladders are kicked over the edge of the up-down place. Sam gasps excitedly as they unroll down, down, down until they’re touching the ground. Dean still isn’t close enough to see, but it’s not long before hunters start climbing into view with their empty pack frames on their backs.
“Oh there they are.” Rowena says and she walks over to them. She shoves the poppy seeds aside until a face turns up. She grins and then nods.
“Hey,” Dean poked him in the chest, “One, no moping after sex, that’s a rule. Two, being mind controlled by a witch does not count as you hurting me. I know it’ll take a while for you to not feel guilty about that Cas, but trust me, I do not blame you for what happened. You understand that?” Cas nodded solemnly, averting his eyes. “Hey,” Dean said again, leaning up to peck Cas softly on the lips, “And never think you have to hide your angel side from me. It’s a part of you, and I want to love every part of you, inside and out,” Dean winked and waggled his eyebrows. Cas’s smile returned and Dean couldn’t help planting another kiss to his lips. “And one more thing,” Dean booped Cas on the nose, “I want to see more of those wings, got me?”
Sam lives through the aftermath, and the heart break that comes with it.
Every so often, he’ll pull the blanket down to watch what everyone is doing. Or sometimes he just glares up at the

He refrains from glancing back over his shoulder as he leaves the room. The Aetherian who led him here tilts her head in a gesture for him to continue to follow her. She starts walking without waiting for him to acknowledge the direction. Without her attention on him, Castiel takes a moment to linger and stare at 1-M-7’s name on the panel. He sighs softly to himself and turns to follow her.
The ivy pushes apart a little and Dean’s heart jumps right into his throat. He feels Rufus’s grip on his shoulder go tight as a girl around the same height as Dean, probably around his age too, slowly steps out of the room.  Her curly dark is like a cloud around her head, just as dark as her skin. The girl’s chest is covered in a single strip of cloth that is tied in the center of her chest with a fancy looking knot. Other than that, she’s wearing a simple drawstring skirt that goes down to her knees, but it doesn’t have anything fancy to it.
Dean waves back, “Till next time.”
There is no rhyme or reason to the lines. Why would 1-M-7 make them? Castiel scans over them quickly. At first glance, he counts two-hundred-four marks. It takes him a moment to realize, with a start, that the number of marks number the same amount of days since 1-M-7 was collected. This is
Sam flinches awake with a squeal, eyes flying open. Dean would’ve laughed if he wasn’t so relieved. “What the fuck!” Sam cries out, and oh how glad Dean is to hear his voice.
It gets weirder the more Dean thinks about it. Why did Cas have to stand with his back to the clear wall where all the other
“You cannot leave.” Castiel intoned once more, diction surprisingly clear for a being that was seventy percent scales.
Dean shook, the adrenaline draining from him, revealing the burn of his muscles. He was hot, his breath clouding and stinging his frozen cheeks. A hand on his shoulder urged him onward, and with feet of led he tread forward, letting the hand guide him through the wooden maze of houses. Barely able to focus his buzzing mind, Dean hardly registered the change of scenery.
supposed to mean?”
It was pure madness. He knew this…he couldn’t stop now. He was so close to the edge of something that there was no going back from it. The weight of the knife in his hand dug into his palm, magnified by the fear that he’d have to use it on something other than gutting fish. He’d been in fights in his days, cracked plenty of skulls, but he’d never felt this sure that he was walking towards danger in his life.
To be fair to Dick, Dean has also kinda fought with May too. She just... She
“Then lets get him in the cage.” Lisa says and Castiel isn’t fast enough. Dean already has him, both hands around Castiel’s wrists. Castiel doesn’t even defend himself, why would he?

“Teleporting,” Dean repeated, “Never tried that before.”

But, if there’s a small chance that they’re going to spend the night there, Dean doesn’t feel comfortable staying out where they can see him. He doesn’t want to go into the tent and sleep next to a stranger, so that only leaves him one option. And that’s why, with a huff, he takes the bowl and blanket with him as he shuffles back across the field in the dark. Trees are safety, and that’s where he plans to spend the night – far out of sight of the

sound good. Dean’s stomach rumbles quietly and he shifts to put a hand over it, only to pull it away again because he doesn’t like the feel of the soft fabric. He did have breakfast, but he doesn’t know how long ago that was. Even though he could see the sky from this room, he couldn’t see the placement of the sun to figure out the time of day. It’s still bright out, but where do the
Castiel’s voice struck odd chords in him. It had the power to reduce his insides to a chittering puddle of goo or draw goosebumps to his skin. It was as formidable as it was graceful. He’d nearly forgotten about the ‘incident’ once he’d seen Castiel with his own eyes, but as he waded back to his boat the night, he nearly crashed into the rocks churned within.
on the other side.
The square of light from the hole in the middle of the ceiling shifts across the grass, and that’s the only way Dean has of knowing how long he’s been in here. He watches the square for a long time before getting up. He moves under the hole and looks up, shading his eyes. It’s just a short empty space that opens to clear blue above it.
Satisfied with the stick that he has in his hand, Dean stands up. “I’m gonna go dig some holes and plant some seeds now.” He’s done with this conversation now. If they want to ask him more questions, they can do it out in the field while he’s working.

The sky.
There has been nothing but friction between 1-M-7 and the next youngest male, 1-M-5. Castiel has tracked each altercation that has occurred between them, and each one seems to have 1-M-5 attempting to exert some form of control over 1-M-7. Despite his young age, 1-M-7 is admirable in his refusal to be pushed around. He stands up for himself, even if doing so ends up causing a fight between them.
The door slides shut behind them and locks itself once the sensors have confirmed no one else remains inside. It will unlock upon their return, acknowledging the weight of someone on the landing pad and recognizing them by the identity chips implanted in their wrists at birth.
! A name. Hah! Dean finally has a name! He repeats it to himself a few times. It’s definitely weird to say, and his tongue doesn’t really want to work right for part of it. He gets the first half right, but the rest comes out wrong. The kid keeps correcting him, but Dean gives up and figures he can stick to the first half for now. Like how Sammy’s full name isn’t Sam, but actually Samuel, named for
“Sorry agents, I think one of your buddies is here. Not sure why there's three of ya but I'm sure it was just a mix up.”
Sam’s face fell as he stared down at the corpse, the woman’s hair splayed out on the wooden table she lay on. Her body lay curled around a smaller bundle, a thin linen dress covering her slightly ballooning from the breeze and the bloating. Although the process of decomposition had obviously taken hold, her skin green and thin, no worms or maggots were present, her form left mostly untouched.

Dean whimpers quietly to himself, and the tears start all over again. He presses his knuckles into his eyes and tries not to think. If he sleeps, maybe he’ll wake up in his
To start, Dean takes the other flap from Frank’s tent and pulls that back. There’s a string attached to the corner that he uses to tie to a loop in the side of the tent. Frank usually hates having it fully open like this, but it has to be like that right now, or Dean is only seeing half of what they’re needing to do. When he’s done, he drops down to sit cross-legged in front of the tent.
“Enough,” Dean swallowed, “We’ll make it enough.”
Dean doesn’t exactly say ‘no’, but he also doesn’t say ‘yes’ either. If anyone wants to help him, they can. Chances are he’s going to end up growing a lot more food than he’s going to eat by himself, and he’s not against sharing it with the tribe. It’ll definitely take away from how many supplies the

draws Castiel’s attention to two more students approaching them. He recognizes the touch and looks over to find Anna, a red-headed and auburn-winged female, and a younger male. Their age group is anyone within a five-sol cycle period, and Samandriel is the youngest amongst them.
When he reaches it, his fingers bump against something that he can’t really see. Dean frowns and presses both hands to it, feeling along the wall. Is this made of the same thing as the see-through bridge? It’s a see-through
“So, when I visit Dean, you have to…” Sam starts, but Castiel is already shaking his head. Sam had already thought that Castiel would want to visit Dean’s dreams and… yeah maybe that actually is a good idea.
“Hey!” He calls out to the child, getting its attention again. “Will I get my stuff back?”
Dean said nothing, his mind unable to find a good excuse because there was none. He worked his mouth, trying to form words until he finally clenched his jaw, forcing it to work, “Give him another chance Sammy, please...” Sam’s shoulders sagged and his face fell. “Before you start coming up with ways to kill the best friend I’ve ever had.”
The empty log is half collapsed, but there’s space at one end. Space enough for Sammy. Dean grabs him by the shoulders and shoves him inside. The bark is rough and it scrapes Sam’s skin. He cries harder, tries fighting, but Dean hushes him and pushes him in further. Next is the basket. There’s not enough room for him, he’s too big, but Dean squishes the woven basket in after Sam to help hide him more.
“Cas?” Dean asks and his voice is so soft. Castiel puts his hands on Dean’s thighs, his wings open a bit, but both of them don’t really care about that. Another door opens somewhere and destroys the little bubble. Castiel gets up again and takes a few steps back.
Castiel’s lips parted and kept going well past where Dean had thought his actual lips had ended. Not only did the line of his lips widened, but his lower jaw looked to disconnect entirely.
Dean looks up to see Castiel standing in the doorway. For the first time since Castiel saw that Dean is awake, the angel looks worried.
Over the last several days, Dean has been taking things back to his own private camp. Rowena gave him some blankets she wove a long time ago, and Dean put found sticks or used a rock to break off a few thin, low hanging branches from the trees to build himself a lean-to among the roots where he spent his first night here. The branches and sticks are tied together with vines that he’s pulled down off the wall. It’s his own version of a camp, and it’s not pretty, but it’s

The days following Dean’s excursion to the lone island were filled with more research and books than he’d cracked in years. It took some digging and a few creative internet searches, but as far as Dean could tell that thing- ‘Castiel,’ was something called a Naga. How much of the bullshit he pulled up on his browser was true, he didn’t know.
child made.
“You think it could be there?” Sam wants to know, because there seems nothing really special about that place, but Rowena nods.
Okay, so those are more recognizable. The numbers, yes. The letter, Dean isn’t really sure. Sounds familiar, but he can’t honestly say if he knows it or not. Either way… “That’s not my name.”
and Balthazar’s golden wings, speckled with shots of white, shuffle against his back.
“Yeah… his dream isn’t from Morpheus, it’s from Phobetor.” Gabriel says and Sam groans. He had already guessed that. Even though Castiel isn’t sleeping for long, he already looks more ill than Dean. Maybe Phobetor eats faster, from the horror Castiel has to see.
“I couldn’t find anything at the police station, but something seems off. Djinns wouldn’t just leave their victims at home, they need to drink from them.” Castiel says and Dean nods while he starts the car. He remembers when he was back in that old barn, hung up and exposed. He shudders a bit and tries to act normal, when Sam watches him.
to take him away, because that always happens anytime Dick hits him or he hits first.
Castiel sighs as he feels his pulse return to its natural pace and the pain and darkness fade from him. For a second Dean’s grace stays, enveloping him like a blanket of sunlight. It’s one last assurance before it’s ripped away, the cold of the room washing away his remaining awe. Cas gasps, staring wildly as he gulps in deep breaths of air.
that they will want to avoid.
Castiel’s tail burrowed in the dirt much like one would dig in with their heel to focus themselves. “It is, how your kind would say- magic? Many creatures have this ability; only a few have lost their Tongues to time, humans being one of them. Long ago your people had the Gift as well, but it was lost.”
May has a wide, flat piece of wood held in her hand. She arranges herself until the fingers of her right hand can move over the strings along the long piece. With the wood, she starts tapping and plucking at the strings. It makes a plinking, trembling sound, and it’s nothing like Dean has ever heard before. He sits up straighter, watching as Lily starts playing her instrument too.
The angel drew closer, banking to head straight for Dean’s direction. He was impossibly fast, filling Dean’s view before he had time to blink. Castiel met his eyes as he passed overhead, gaze magnified by the eyes sparkling amongst his wings. It only lasted a millisecond, but it was long enough for Dean to flash his friend a smile.
“You’re using a lot of big words I don’t know.” Dean shrugs and leans forward.
might stop him then, but at least he’ll know. Not trying is worse than not knowing, and he’ll never forgive himself if he doesn’t use all the escape options that he has.
The moment Dean touched Cas was like a splash of warm water on a cold day. His mind basked in the lapping of warmth around it, relaxing in the enticing pull of its tide. He let it pull him in, into the galactic swirl of emotions, thoughts, and memories. All these things wove together, surrounding and welcoming him. It was strange, the first time Dean had been this close he’d been forced to resist this, the gravity of Cas’s conscious, but now he could see the event horizon, the great unknown. Willingly, he fell in. It was dark at first but not for long. A sphere glowed bright and blue in the center. Strands of it extended away to create the quilted pattern of the galaxy. But out of the ball of blue, Dean saw one difference. In the center of the sphere glowing brightly and woven extensively with the infinite pattern was a single golden strand.
He does not look up from his PADD, but he does shake his head slightly. Just enough for 1-M-7 to get an answer, but possibly not enough to be noticed on the cameras.
Dean chuckled, “I remember when you used to borrow my clothes for school. It wasn’t until, what, Junior year that you finally needed your own.”
Castiel glances away from her PADD to look at the enclosure proper. It is separated by a wall from the room where 1-M-7 is resting. Since the enclosure is a wedge within the dome, it is wider at one end and narrows towards the center of the facility. The wide end has several rows of trees to obscure the stark white walls. Flowers are scattered throughout the grass field, long stalks waving in the simulated breeze. Vines and creeping ivy crawl up the other two walls, and the fourth at the center of the facility is covered in rocks. A waterfall spills over them and into a large pool, filling that end of the enclosure.
“No one's been here in years Sammy.” Dean cautiously walked up to one of the houses, creaking open a door. The knob fell off with a snap.
“I’m s-sorry. I was so stupid, of course this was too good to be true.” Dean whispers and wipes over his face. The tears don’t stop and it gets worse, when Castiel takes a step back, at least he still stays close.
The room exploded. All sound suddenly too loud and too soft. Sam and Dean were thrown to the ground, a wave of nebulous energy washing  over them, drowning the room in a white glow as wave upon wave crashed down. Dean forced his eyes open. He watched, even though he didn’t fully comprehend what he was seeing.
Dean! It had been a close call, and Dean had still gotten seriously injured. A lump formed in Sam’s throat as he remembered it — seeing Dean, dangling, helpless. It could’ve been
“For you at least,” Cas’s lip quirked up in the hint of a smirk.
Castiel settled closer to the ground, holding the fruit in his upturned palms with a critical eye. First, he sniffed it, with his ‘human’ nose, then he scented it. Only after doing both a handful of times did Castiel finally lower his tongue down and flick the forked tips of his tongue against the orange’s flesh.
Ellen glances at Cas, and then at Dean, frowning. “What’s an x-ray?”
“This where we’re staying?” he asked. The skeletal remains of the house weren’t by any means comfortable, but it looked more sturdy than some of the others he had glanced in his mindless trek here.
like that before. That means it’s not
“No one?” Sam whispered, as if the fog around them were some sleeping beast. “But there's supposed to be people living here. They can't just all disappear.”
And that’s when it occurs to him. “You’re not allowed to talk to me, are you?”
Dean stays stubbornly quiet and he definitely doesn’t move.
They checked the whole town right after Dean and Castiel woke up and Dean was relieved that everyone woke up again. Only the nurse went missing, but Dean knows now, that she was Morpheus.
Following the wall, Dean breaks out of the trees again and follows the ivy. It leads him towards a grouping of tents around a smoking fire, and he turns away from that. The far wall is all stones stacked up and up and up, all the way to the top of the wall almost in line with where the

If Dean doesn’t wake up, Castiel wouldn’t want to either.
“Finally,” Dean muttered as a trodden path became visible. Castiel paused, pursing his lips and looking around at the surrounding brush. “Is something wrong?” Dean asked.
What do the others think about this? Dean fights against his gut reaction that wants him to run back to under the cover of the trees where he can hide out in the safe space of his own personal camp. Instead, he looks around, checking to see if anyone else is as freaked out as both him and Frank.
He watches her for a while, captivated by this different process. What’s that string made of? It looks very different from the plant fibers or leather from hide that his people use.
Dean doesn’t know how often they had this talk, but Castiel seems to ignore his rules for personal space more often again. There was a time when Castiel did step back, but now they are just staring again. Dean can’t help but look down to Castiel’s lips, just for a tiny second and he doesn’t even realize that he is licking his own lips.
Every new glance up has Dean getting more and more angrier with himself. It’s dumb. He hates Cas, like he hates all the

His head lolled, forehead slamming against the steering column on his way down.
Dean groans as he walks away. He doesn’t like wearing it the way Bill showed him. The loincloth they’re having him wear now is just a long strip of fabric hooked over the front and back of a knotted belt. It’s not
His brother draws him in for a bone-crushing hug. Dean feels the air squeezed out of his body as he reluctantly hugs back and groans.
A shock coursed through Dean’s spine, tensing his muscles unwillingly and stiffening his body. Dean knew these spells were only a fraction of what they could be at full power, but they sure were doing a good job of stealing precious time.
“Are you okay?” Bill’s hand brushes lightly over Dean’s shoulder but doesn’t grab him to pull him up.
Dean stepped into a clearing at the base of the hill, and immediately he knew he’d made a mistake.
“Take that one first,” she slowly lowered her finger and pointed it straight at Dean, “I’ll make the other one watch.”
Sam steps on the creaking board again, giggling in delight at the sound. He rocks back and forth on it, chubby hand flailing happily. Dean pulls a piece of charcoal from the pouch at his hip and crouches to draw a large X symbol in the center of the board. It’ll warn others that it’s getting old and to keep an eye on it. Eventually, it will be replaced.
“Dean.”
“What do you want here?” Fake-Castiel asks and Dean takes a chair from the wall and walks up to the cage. He slowly sits down and just watches Fake-Castiel for a moment. He seems so real.
again, because he loved all of Cas and he felt he was being deprived of a vital part of him. The drag of feathers and soft touch of clawed fingers were all he could think of some nights, combined with those blue eyes and powerful body. He wondered if Cas heard him then, but if he did, he never mentioned.
always warned that he shouldn’t swim after eating. He’s only explored half of the bottom of the pool so far, despite Ellen and Rowena not liking it when he dives out of sight. Dean doesn’t understand their worry. He’s a great swimmer, and he can hold his breath for a really long time.
Dean hasn’t checked the

She stands up to dust the dirt from her clothing. Her smile is sweet when she meets Dean’s eyes. “Yes, but I travelled with many others from across the sea.”
The brown bottle sitting half-empty to his right in the squat cabin was a scarlet letter. Even though Sam wasn’t there, he’d known. Dean frowned, scowling into the phone as he snatched it from his shoulder. “What are you, my mom?” He regretted it as soon as he said it. There were some subjects they didn’t talk about, and Mom’s death was one of them.
“That was an x-ray.”
“But we will already be passing by the corals. It will be of no hindrance to us to help him.”

Translations:
Castiel closes the hotel door with a sigh of relief. It’s almost 3 am now and all he wants to do is sleep. Not even bothering to kick off his boots he flops down onto the bed, sinking his face into the pillow with a happy sigh. He’ll regret it in the morning when his teeth feel fuzzy and his face is grimy with sweat, but for now, this is the best feeling in the world.
and reach out to her.
Bill looks at Dean steadily, one hand coming up to scratch idly at his beard. Eventually, he shrugs and looks down at the braiding again. “Yeah, okay. We don’t have to talk about it right now. But, if you do want to later on, I’m here for you, okay? A lot of us are here for you, if you need us.”

“Look, I’m not…here to try and kill you or anything. I just- I had to know what I saw. I had to know I wasn’t batshit.” Dean exhaled a shaking breath, chancing getting his legs under him to at least get to his knees. He doubted he could outrun how fast this thing could- slither? But it made him feel better to have the option of running away.
It will be difficult, however. Every time he looks down at 1-M-7 and finds him staring up with anger and hatred on his face, all Castiel can feel is a sense of pity – a desire to
They stood for several minutes, doing nothing but watching and observing. Dean could still feel Cas’s contentment, swirling about his head like koi in a pond but there was also a nagging soreness polluting it. It was faint but Dean didn’t want to pry. They’d established early on that just because they could feel each others thoughts didn't mean they were comfortable being discussed. They were politely acknowledged and brought up when appropriate, but some things were best left to be figured out on their own. There still needed to be some privacy.

Naomi blinks at him slowly, her ear-wings flicking up and forward to indicate her surprise. Understandably so. It is unusual for Castiel to call her such an intimate term like
Sam paused, he knew this was the final ingredient, the last element before all that was left were words. Words that would seal Cas away, words that would break his heart, words that had to be spoken. Sam closed his eyes, crushing the lavender in his hands, “For Dean and for Cas.” The petals and leaves floated down like feathers, resting atop the shining liquid before they were dragged under, drowning in red. Sam’s lip quivered as he let the petals fall and reached with a shaky hand to the note on the ground. After this it was final, after this… Dean and Cas would be gone, there was no going back.
“No idea,” Sam shrugged.
The fish panic, as he knew they would, but with a practiced stroke of his blade, he slices the slowest of the group, downing three and swerving sharply. He lashes out with his tail, swinging as hard as he can as he turns. He feels several more fish against his fin, stunned by the blow and races after the rest of the group, teeth bared and claws outstretched. He snags one on his foreclaw and quickly bites its spine to end its wriggling.
“How long do you think the wards will last?” Dean asked after a minute of the calming silence. Sam looked up at the bloody symbols on the walls. He could already see the red sizzling, an orange glow slowly eating it away.
, though.
Yeah, he does, but he’s not going to say that out loud. Dean loved the river by the village. It was sluggish and not very deep, but the water was clear. He liked ducking down until his feet touched the bottom, and then he could drift in the current and watch all the fish that swam around him. They always ended up right in the fishing nets, but it was always nice to watch. Sometimes he would try to catch them with his hands, but they were so fast and slippery, and he never could get a good grip.

“Okay,” Dean let out a shaky breath, “And Cas… are you completely you right now?”
The hairs on his neck stand on end as he feels a presence by the side of the bed. That’s it.
The rock shelf delves deeper into the trench wall, opening up into a large cave system. Dean stares in awe as the rock hollows out into a long stretch of shimmering green crystal. The crystals are smooth, with cracks and vertical refractions of light embedded deep in their emerald depths, forming the walls and reflecting off his rough grey skin. Below him, Dean spots the misty surface of a brine pool and the smoke of vents billowing up to heat the cavern. It warms him from head to tail and sends a pleasant shiver through his body.

, they do not wish to have caused disease and destruction to it like they did their home world. Its destruction can be laid squarely on their shoulders, not that anyone will ever truly admit it. But Castiel has read the historical records, and he knows that they killed it. They polluted the world until it started to kill them back, forcing them to leave or risk dying with it.
Dean squinted through the windows while Sam tried the door. “It's locked.”
Instead of giving Dean the answer he wants, the child backs away from the clear wall. It drops back into another stupid crouch on the other side of the passage again, quiet, like a
Dean’s mind whirls until he finally comes up with an excuse,
“Cas,” Sam said after a minute, “I know the priority is dealing with the veils. But I am keeping an eye out for anything that might help with your deal, too. So’s Rowena, for that matter, but I think you already knew that.”
Victor snorts a laugh, but Rufus is the one who answers. “Our ancestors came from a different tribe entirely. Your tribes -” He pauses and gestures at everyone else around the fire. “- started from the mountains and spread out. But ours first crossed the great plans a long time ago and joined up with the tribe that your people came from. There are lots of people in our tribe that look like us, or lighter but still darker than you.”
Dean slowly shook his head, brushing it against the dusty floor. Sam hummed quietly, his point proven, “I’m trying to think of all the possibilities Dean… the fact we may not get Cas back is one of them.”
“Weirdo,” Dean grumbled under his breath, eager to cast off and distance himself from the man as fast as possible. He reminded him of a moray eel.
Even though Dean is the one who picked her, as if he was ready to go without any issues, Rowena still has to sorta drag him after the
“No.”
“Fuck!” He threw off his blankets, casting the sodden sheets to the ground to deal with later. For the fourth night in a row, he threw himself in the shower under a cold blast, hissing as the frigid water bit hard and chased away the magma within.
But despite the fire, he continued to crawl through the burning timber. His whole body screamed but he pushed through. His arms began to shake.
“Please have something, please have something,” he murmured as he scanned the cabinet. The bottles were conveniently labeled in an old fashion script. “Lady ferns, poppies, sage, eucalyptus oil....” Sam ran his finger along the aisle, letting out a triumphant sigh of relief as he recognized the medicinal plants. He snatched up a handful and turned to run back to the house.
“I like this ‘sheep.’” Castiel announced, licking a trail of blood from the corner of now ‘normal’ lips.

step on him. She’s way taller than any of the grown-ups, and she’s got some wicked looking talons poking out the coverings she’s wearing over her whole body.
For the entire walk, the Aetherian leading him does not say a word. She merely guides Castiel to a specific door and inputs information into the panel. It lights up with 1-M-7’s designation and the door slides open. It is the same calming room that 1-M-7 is always brought to, though Castiel has not seen it from this side before. He knows it almost intimately from the other side of the quartz glass that usually divides him from 1-M-7.
That means that Dean has been on his best behaviour, more or less. Sure, every few moons or so his patience with Dick or May or anything about this place runs out. Things reach some kind of breaking point, and Dean will end up in the Alone Room. It’s like how
Castiel presses to fingers against Dean’s forehead and he is relieved when he feels that Dean is alive and his soul immediately responds to Castiel’s touch. He can’t wake him up and he feels a dark energy in Dean, but Castiel is just so glad that he had found him.
“I will stay here.” Gabriel says and Sam wants to disagree with him, but then he sees the look on Gabriel’s face. He had just gotten his brother back and now Castiel is the one who is on the verge of dying.
The blanket isn’t as soft as the clothes, probably because it’s well used. It’s still made of the fabric that Dean isn’t used to, but he likes it better than the clothes. They had a few blankets like this back in his family tree.
Oh, right! He almost forgot about that. “The painting moved and talked.”
Zoologists like his mother come and go constantly, and the bridges are open to the public to come and view the specimens at their leisure. Really, the only thing that sets the researchers apart from the public are their outfits. His mother and her co-workers wear primarily white clothing, and they always wear pants in case they need to go into the enclosures for one reason or another. The majority of the public wear robed bottoms of some sort, and shirts are entirely optional.
Usually, Castiel is there to see it happen, but he has appreciated the notifications for whenever he chooses to take his lesson at home. On those days, Castiel transfers his lesson to his PADD and flies across the city to check on 1-M-7 where he has been isolated in the calming room again. He may be the only one who unofficially identifies this one room as belonging to 1-M-7 now, but the workers do seem to put him in the same room every time.

However, he did not expect to be awoken in the middle of the night by his PADD quite literally
