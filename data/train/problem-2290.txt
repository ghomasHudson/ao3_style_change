John narrowly avoided squeezing them hard as his fist tightened reflexively. He reined his anger in just in time, and gritted out more words as he stroked Sherlock's velvety shaft. "And...this?"
John hesitated, considering what sort of answer to give as he sipped his bitter coffee, glancing at the window as if to find divine inspiration in the grim, melancholy skyline. He nibbled his bottom lip, about to reply, when Jason piped up. With his ridiculous spiked hair, puce chinos, and a generally obnoxious and superior demeanour, John could barely tolerate Jason at the best of times. He was a sexist pig and naturally thought he was God's gift to women.
"And you're upset because...?" John was stalling, and he knew it. He wasn't sure what Sherlock had heard, or what he thought he'd heard, so he would reserve judgement until the man gave him a little more information.
it from the storeroom. No one was using it. It very likely would have got binned if I hadn't rescued it."
A stuttered, sharp groan forced itself from John's mouth, and his eyes squeezed shut instinctively. His slick left hand anchored itself upon Sherlock's firm pectoral, whilst the other automatically snaked between his own legs, massaging his prick conscientiously.
With a taut twitch in return, Sherlock swallowed and dropped his hands to the bed beneath him to grip absentmindedly, “No,” he breathed. “I
Sherlock gasped, surprised, but his lips closed around the base of the plug without a protest and John held it there for a few seconds before letting go, chuckling breathlessly when Sherlock kept it inside, panting laboriously through his nose as John kept thrusting into him.
Three feet away, on the other side of the wall, Sherlock smirked into his pillow as he heard the tell-tale squeaks of Molly's mattress as she came down from her climax.
“It involves penises.”
Sherlock paused with a jerk and a shiver, “
me masturbate?”
“Piss off!”
"You're an idiot, Sherlock," he murmured, aggressively fondling between the detective's legs."...I can't wait to...tell you how wrong you are."
“Not that I’ve been aware of, no – You merely turn over and embrace me. Perhaps murmur a little but it’s incoherent and muffled by my hair most of the time,” Sherlock told him, blatantly enjoying the touches by the way he inched closer and pressed his forehead to John’s neck, tickling him with silky, warm ringlets.
," John grimaced. "New rule...no talking about your brother in the bedroom." He grasped Sherlock's swollen pink shaft and weighed it, feeling it twitch. "You could do some damage with this."
"The opposite of us, then," Greg chuckled.
"What?"
“You’re a brilliant army doctor, infinitely brave, what could you possibly need ‘psyching up’ for?”
He dripped again at the unrestrained, breathy groan that rewarded him; he quickly palmed himself with one hand to ease the impatient ache of his cock. Planting his hands once more upon John’s scapulae, thumbing them a little too deeply, and rocking himself against the frictionless, oily plumpness of John’s buttocks, he spoke up with a torn, demanding growl.
"I don't know what we'll do with all this, Sherl. Not like you can eat it all in one day- and no, that wasn't a challenge don't go setting about trying to prove that a human being
The detective sat up on the sofa, coughing suddenly on a sharp intake of breath. He squirmed a bit as he pulled his legs up underneath himself and turned to face his flatmate. “What do I have to do to get your penis inside me?”
Greg let out a snigger and shook his head, sharing a grin with the doctor.
clear?"
Perhaps she would have an insight into John's psyche that Sherlock couldn't quite penetrate. The detective huffed at his own thoughts, swanning into his bedroom and pulling on his favourite black trousers and his plum shirt. John had always reacted when Sherlock wore this shirt, in a multitude of ways. If he wore it now, perhaps he could comfort himself with the knowledge the doctor found him semi-attractive. It wasn't much, and didn't comfort him in the way he needed, but it was better than nothing.
"I don't see what was so funny about it." Sherlock snapped, wanting to jerk his leg away from John but relishing the physical contact too much to take the high road. Everything was much too loud in the small pub, he was bored, and he just wanted to go home and get off with John. "What's so hysterical about snowballing? Mycroft and I used to play snowballing all the time when we were younger."
as well."
," John whispered, shaking his head, and grabbed the taller man's cool, angular face, directing it forcefully against his own pursed mouth, sighing gratefully at the contact.
Sherlock swallowed, averting his eyes, as small, strong, knowledgeable fingers traversed his nipples. The hateful sun still beat hot and bright through the window and Sherlock gritted his teeth as the tired daylight star made his eyes water, his cheeks tingle with heat, and his confidence shrink with every second that it tainted him.
John's cock was finally responding. Sherlock could feel it fattening up against his thigh but John wasn't moving to give himself more stimulus, didn't start rubbing himself against Sherlock. He seemed to be ignoring it. Overcome, Sherlock huffed a hot, silent laugh against John's mouth.
John quickly undid his jeans and tugged them down, letting his cock, blood red and hard, spring free. Sherlock swallowed a sudden inundation of saliva at the sight, and did his best to resist wrestling John to the floor, wolfing the smaller man down and gulping and gobbling with zero elegance until John rewarded his throat with a hot gush of liquid pleasure. John didn’t give him the chance to enact his fantasy, though. He’d already waited long enough for his orgasm and it seemed he was too excited and couldn’t wait another minute. He started stroking his cock at a fast pace, hips urging upward and breaths stuttering and labored.
"Thank you." He ducked around her and jogged up the stairs to the flat, the two largest suitcases in his hands, leaving John staring awkwardly at a cheekily grinning Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock froze. "What?"
Sherlock hastily put his underwear and trousers back on- wriggling about under the sheet to manage it- before settling himself astride John's bare, muscled legs on the lilo, hoping the inflatable would be able to take their combined weights. He was hesitant to ask his next question, conscious of John's request that he didn't 'sub-plot' during an act of intimacy. But it had to be done. "Have you ever been penetrated?"
"I should have known not getting off for one day would have made you so randy."
Sherlock squirmed, refusing to let himself be aroused by John's low, joking voice. "John-"
"If you want..."
John moaned but dutifully opened the phone with his left hand and saw who was calling. Sherlock listened to him talk, obviously to Mrs Hudson, and was startled when John slapped him on the arse.
Sherlock chewed the inside of his mouth with a blatantly disdainful expression on his face and tweaked John's thigh warningly when Mrs. Watson seemed ready to embark on an excruciatingly boring monologue about the goats she used to have when she lived in Devon. John shot Sherlock a look, clearly telling him to behave, and as soon as Sherlock heard the words "Of course, they were all nice goats, but Blythe was my favourite" he opened his mouth.
Just as Sherlock's leg muscles began to tense and quake threateningly, John pulled back, biting his bottom lip in muted glee at Sherlock's choked off, agonized moan. Hot sweat was actually making sweet, sumptuous webs of Sherlock's eyelashes now, and his breaths were heavy and rasping enough to make any general practitioner concerned.
"We need to talk."
"I thought it'd be easy," Sherlock muttered in a broken baritone voice, his tongue continuously running  over his scarlet, seeping upper lip. "I...hurt...a lot," he confessed with an imperfect smile stained with shocking red blood.
Sherlock frowned, eyes flicking between each of John's own, trying to understand. It didn't make sense. John had watched some of those videos upwards of twenty times. He'd even saved a few in special, password protected folders on his laptop. Sherlock had spent
Seizing one of John’s hands, Sherlock yanked it from where it was clinging to his hip and tugged it under his trembling, shifting body to where he was soaking the covers in pre-ejaculate, his penis hard and scorching hot, “
Sherlock pulled John into a quick kiss, not relishing the idea of more networking with his boorish friends, but ready to do so...for John. He was certain that the mingled sweat and lovebites he was wearing would be more than sufficient as chainmail.
"John, stop,
"It's just...I'd like one," Sherlock uttered in a seemingly random non-sequitur, causing John to turn and frown questioningly at him, just as Sherlock averted his eyes self-consciously, his strong, white knuckles clenching distractedly.
All rational thought splintered at the scrape of John's teeth over Sherlock's skin.
Sherlock could hear the heart monitor attached to him start to get faster, broadcasting his distress, and the door opened, John quickly striding in with a worried look on his face.
"I...it's just," Sherlock muttered, mindless. "That might make me come," he admitted throatily, before suffering a full-body shiver.
"I want to remember everything," came the slightly-choked answer and Sherlock winced as he realised, a few seconds later, that his brain-to-vocal chords filter was functioning even more poorly than usual.
His cock, gripped in his hand, pulsed, adrenaline surging through his veins. A thin string of pre-come welled from the tip, dribbling along his fingers as he held his breath, heart in his throat, watching John writhe.
When he had no reply, he grimaced sulkily and yanked the duvet up over his head, cocooning himself into a grumpy, chilly lump under the covers.
As he lowered, Sherlock gave a low, gravelly and excessively unrestrained grunt, wriggling at having John almost entirely against him, “You like it
Still silence. A sudden, angry car horn pierced the humid air, and encouraged the first nagging prods of a migraine in John’s skull.
"...F...
Sherlock swallowed nervously, nodding. "I'll just...just go put them on in the loo..." He started edging towards the door but John stopped him, crawling to the edge of the bed.
But, as Sherlock arched, mouth open, pupils blown wide, cheeks flushed and cock hard, John was comforted that if he himself was a sadist, his chosen love was most assuredly a masochist.
"I'm not mad at you, you crazy git."
"Sherlock-"
Sherlock sighed tremulously, eyes fluttering closed, when John kissed him again, moving his lips against Sherlock's, a low moan reverberating through his chest and vibrating against Sherlock's lips. He'd barely allowed himself to fantasize how it would feel to kiss John, how those usually chapped lips would feel gliding against his, warm and alluring. Now he'd had it, though, he didn't think he'd ever not want John kissing him. Sherlock pulled back sharply.
"And yet here you are," John replied softly, allowing himself to finally give in and get comfortable. He wriggled his hips back slightly, before freezing. "...You're not naked are you?"
"Sherlock," she said gently. "It's not that easy to admit you love someone, not when it means so much."
to Sherlock. "Um...
"Fuck it all," he muttered under his breath.
"…'Mazing," John sighed, chest forcing out a few, overwhelmed exhales. He sighed, laying back heavily and gazing groggily up at the clear night sky. "Just...been fucked." he grinned. "S'good." He grabbed at Shaun, seeking his mouth for another kiss.
"Imagine what these would look like wet." He teased.
"But it's good that I lasted, right? That's what partners want in bed, I was led to understand?"
John was trying his best to be conscious of Sherlock's reactions, but it took a heavy thigh in the face to cause him to pull away with a sore cheek and a little giggle. Shakily, John pulled away and collapsed on the damp bed, face-to-face with Sherlock, licking his thin lips.
He gritted his teeth as he crossed the room, stepped over the coffee table, and vaulted, with force and no remorse, onto Sherlock's crotch, his knees splaying to either side of his detective's hips, hands spreading possessively on his partner's pale, taut pectorals. Sherlock gasped hard, his beautiful features crinkling as his doctor writhed on him unexpectedly.
known better. He had still wanted to come, though. Idiot.
"Might be important." John strained to reach his phone.
"Buy an electric blanket." Sherlock replied sourly, closing his eyes and willing himself to go to sleep and stop concentrating on the pulsing need between his legs. This wasn't like him.
"Can't wait till Anderson sees it," he muttered into Sherlock's ear, huffing with laughter.
John couldn't hold back a pained furrow of his brow and a greedy, insistent throb of his prick as he heard one of the nameless guys on screen screech in orgasm. "It's not...you don't have to-"
...dozens...deadly," he panted, frowning in annoyance as he tried valiantly to text back with minimal typos.
"Needed that then?" asked the Detective Inspector playfully.
"Not really, love." John giggled, rubbing his thigh comfortingly. "Here." He offered Sherlock one of his hands which Sherlock gripped tightly.
"Can I have your fingers first." Sherlock murmured, not even bothering to make the sentence a question. John grinned, accepting he'd have to do all the work, and let his "of course" go unspoken. He slicked his fingers up and teased at the entrance to Sherlock's body, wincing at the red, slightly puffy way his entrance looked. He kept his movements to a bare minimum.
Mycroft was about to expound his directions, when Sherlock's phone beeped, and the detective's face flinched with the briefest, yet telling pang of nervousness. Mycroft smirked, watching smugly as his little brother blushed and thumbed through the message that was undoubtedly from John.
Stars exploded behind his eyelids as John's dick grazed along his prostate, making his cock jerk frantically and leak out a stream of pre-come which spooled down onto John's stomach.
"Are you still on about that?" Shaun asked incredulously. "John...that was ages ago. Come on. I was a different person.
"Yes, John, yes! Like that!" Sherlock beamed, beginning to pump rhythmically into John with shallow, breathy, indescribably-erotic noises. He threw his head back upon the previously-pristine pillow, now impregnated with the sweet musk of his own perspiration, his wet curls swirling hypnotically as he rocked his head in pleasure, like dark seaweed tendrils in a low tide.
"...I...I'm...g-gonna..." Sherlock panted gracelessly, the exertion burning in his muscles, and his imminent climax a wildfire in his blood.
"Jesus." John growled, tightening his grip on the binoculars until his fingers hurt.
." Sherlock rumbled. "I like it. You can tell we're naked and in bed..." He trailed off, eyes raking over the picture again, committing it to memory.
"Every time I see them I can't help but imagine how they'd looked wrapped around my waist while I fuck you."
"Didn't know a bit of dick would turn you into such a little cock slut, Watson." He licked his lips, smirking. "But sorry, not today. I've already just finished with Jones."
"I know for a fact you're not patient enough to drag out foreplay." John groaned, twitching at the sensations that long, pale fingertips were inducing. Sherlock's head snapped up, offended, and he gave John a glare.
He was surprised when he was approached with Shaun's customary cheeky grin and knowing, smiling eyes an hour later. It would seem that Shaun himself hadn't gotten off from his encounter with Wilkins and he was obviously looking for John to help him out.
John let out a small grating noise every time Sherlock's short nails dragged pleasure through his scalp, hardly having been aware that it was even something he enjoyed. He rolled his hips very slightly across Sherlock's crotch in a ghost of penetration. "...What I
He heard Sherlock shift on the bed, obviously mulling things over and dissecting everything John had just said, trying no doubt to find hidden meanings in every sentence.
"Five minutes, just five minutes," John insisted sharply, his frustration at Shaun's continued reluctance to share intimacy almost at a breaking point.
"W-..um...where do you want me?" Sherlock asked, the pink flush on his sharp cheekbones spreading down his pale throat and decorating his lean clavicles. John's gaze flicked behind Sherlock.
. He keeps going on about having these new experiences with me that he's never known before. When they run out, I don't see what more he'd need from me. In
"Because we've been in that hotel room for almost 48 hours." John had explained this earlier, in their room as he'd bullied Sherlock into getting dressed. "We need fresh air. Sunshine. Remember that, Sherlock? Vitamin D."
It wasn't helping.
Sherlock flushed abruptly, flicking grey-green eyes to his doctor. “……Depends who they’re with, I suppose.”
"Eat up, Sherlock. Then we can...talk."
"Want us to...come together," the brunette murmured, starting to pump his hips a little faster, his inhales strained and his exhales fierce as he neared his own climax.
Hence this, his clandestine visit. Sherlock closed his eyes, losing himself in the tingling sensations he was provoking in his own body. The fabric of his pyjamas rubbed distractingly over the head of his cock with each motion of his hand, brushing along the sensitive skin and making Sherlock shudder in increasing desire. He nibbled on his plump bottom lip, grimacing in pleasure, eyes still tightly closed. It was a risk he was well aware of- John could wake at any moment and catch Sherlock unaware- but he couldn't resist as his strong fingers continued to tease and tug on his tumescent shaft. Sherlock's staggered inhales, growing heavier the faster he moved his hand, tasted of John's sweet, sleeping, nocturnal, delicious, irresistible scent...Sherlock choked down a lustful growl as the sexual adjectives regarding his doctor- of which he had many- began to spin and mount into lascivious stacks and engage in vivid, flesh-coloured orgies in his Mind Palace.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the sight. John stood beneath the warm spray of their shower, his head thrown back and eyes closed. The water sluiced down his skin in fascinating rivulets- down his neck, across his chest, teasing the edge of one dark, pebbled nipple, and trickling down his stomach and right on over his obviously hard, very red, throbbing cock, over which he was working his hand at a steady but feverish pace.
“Well, if I’m gonna be heartlessly dumped by someone I wasn’t even seeing, I’m going to demand a goodbye kiss.”
"I thought I might get lucky, that's all. A proper kiss. But this is fine. And lovely. I know you don't go in for all that stuff."
"Yes, of course...I was just…surprised. Let me try again."
"......Can we...can we go to bed so I can lay you down?" Sherlock asked, in a rapid, gasping request. John nodded, whining at the loss when Sherlock gently, reluctantly, removed his fingers. John skittered ungracefully off Sherlock’s lap onto wobbly legs. They staggered to Sherlock's bedroom; John threw himself onto the unmade bed and unceremoniously shoved two fingers into his own arse. Sherlock stared unabashedly at the sight: John fucking himself greedily with his fingers, hips urging up at the sensations, cock more than half hard already and twitching into full rigidity. It was a lovely sight and Sherlock made sure to commit it to memory, frame it, and hang the picture in his hall dedicated purely to John.
"Come on, love. Want to see you come. Come on, Sherlock."
"I already texted Mrs. Hudson when you were faffing around with the pineapple. She's happy to keep half of them in her freezer." Sherlock cleared his throat, fidgeting, before taking John's hand and, without a word, led him to their bedroom. John, bemused, allowed himself to be towed down the hall, watching as Sherlock gnawed nervously upon his bottom lip, ran a frantic hand through his black curls.
it, get him out of here first.”
Sherlock's arse rippled around him, hot and slick and John felt his orgasm rising up sharply, way too soon. But there was nothing he could do to stop it. He gasped, gave a handful more thrusts, and sank as deep into Sherlock as he could, his testicles mashed against Sherlock's arse as he came.
The man grinned. "Didn't say that." Sherlock watched, with a quickly beating heart, as the man's hand slipped down the front of his pants, fondling his flaccid cock and rolling his testicles, which shrank in his grip, in his fingers. "These'd fry up pretty sweet and tasty. Keep you alive for it and let you have a taste."
"But he's had his mouth on me. His fingers inside me. Surely if it was all so new, he'd definitely balk at giving a blowjob?"
"Sherlock!" John recovered first, face red both in second-hand embarrassment for Molly and oxygen deprivation.
"So how'd it happen? The two of you, I mean." She asked, going back to the original topic, curiosity lighting up her features as she glanced between Sherlock and John. "I- I mean, you don't have to tell me if you don't want. Obviously. It's just…well, everyone thought you'd been together for ages but Sherlock made it sound as if…" She trailed off, not wanting to revisit last night's conversation with Sherlock.
He spun the short army doctor around and dragged his trousers down to his thighs. John didn't even hesitate, bracing his hands against the wall and pushing his arse out naughtily.
Sensing John’s discomfort, Sherlock obeyed John’s silent order, yet did so with his mouth rather than his fingers. The eruption of wet heat, as Sherlock ducked down to take John’s nipple into his mouth, was almost overwhelmingly powerful, but then Sherlock rolled his hips and the hot, grinding friction between them overrode everything for several blinding moments.
John needed sex. Lots and lots of sex. If he wasn't having it, then he was thinking of it, and John's thinking of sex led to him wanking...and wanking led him to wanting sex. It was a cycle, one Sherlock had observed the entire time he and John had been flatmates. John had always been in the pursuit of women he wanted to sleep with.
lowered the zip of his jeans.
"I only practised with my fingers...practised having something deep in my throat." Sherlock said casually, his grey-green eyes fiendish, and his blush a wonderful pink rash across his sharp cheekbones. He nuzzled at the base of John's shaft, inhaling deeply, taking in all the information he garnered from mere scent, like a blind, hungry dog.
John was more than willing to oblige. He snapped his hips, seating himself deeper into Sherlock's arse. His moan echoed Sherlock's, pleasure searing through his pelvis and tingling up his spine.
"Babe?" John clamped a hand to his mouth as if he could retract the pet name he'd unconsciously uttered. Hearing no scathing retort- for which he was thankful- he knocked again, his face flushed. "Sherlock?"
"…..John!…..You just kissed me!"
“I don’t expect anything, no,” Sherlock huffed as he turned the bedside lamp off, pitching the room into sudden darkness. The bed dipped and bounced as he got into it, the warm gust of air signalling his slumping body, and John vaguely caught sight of Sherlock’s black curls as he turned onto his side to face him. “You’re always getting me things anyway. I thought I should repay the favour.” His tone was light-hearted and low, rumbling in the space between them.
"Whatever you want."
John had dealt with the injury as professionally as he could, but despite hearing all kinds of horror stories in medical school, he'd never expected to experience a self-pleasuring penetration so...bizarre. To be honest, he had better things to do. Unwanted, the memory of gathering hot, red slippery handfuls of intestines in his fingers and trying to gently yet forcefully re-insert them into an unnaturally-pale abdomen where they belonged assaulted him. John could almost feel himself gritting his teeth again and trying to focus through the pulse of terrifying adrenaline and panicked tears.
“Still, the formality would be nice. You know, just once in a while.”
"Mrs - " He managed, before the door opened sharply in his face, his diminutive landlady looking up at him expectantly, wearing a flattering mauve dress, and a dubious expression, tainted with the faintest of smiles. Sherlock glanced back at the front door, not needing to falsify his breathlessness and panic. "Mrs. Hudson... Rufus Shinra's on his way. Mob boss. I need cover. Just temporarily."
"It's been six months," the detective interrupted bitterly, still panting, but not as heavily. "...Do you
“What?” she asked, her own pulse beginning to race in contagious panic. Sherlock stood momentously tall, and took as deep a breath as his speeding heart and electric terror would allow. Several pairs of eyes stared at him expectantly in the otherwise peaceful summer morning.
, Sherlock. Then just drink to..." John gesticulated in frustration as he tried to think of something, "...Our engagement," he suggested, pointing at the naff cracker ring on the taller man's finger.
"Good morning," Sherlock murmured in his hypnotic baritone. "I don't believe we've met." He didn't miss the reflexive, nervous swallow of the other man, and the unnaturally rapid blinks of his eyes. He watched the flicker of Jason's eyes to John, telling and obvious to Sherlock's in its implications, then smirked triumphantly.
"No." John interrupted, giving him a stern look. "No- to all of that, Sherlock."
"Oh, Sherlock, you
Sherlock's hand tightened exponentially on John's, and his swallow was obvious, and the bob of his white throat was eyed by both of the men beside him. An ugly grimace finally relented and commandeered his delicate, masculine features. "I'll tell you what John wants. He wants the delight of your total and permanent absence from his life. And if you ever attempt, in any way, to contact him again, I will personally cut off your stagnant testicles with a rusty scalpel, fry them in garlic, and make you eat them. Do I make myself
"Ch-christ, Sherlock! Stop!" John panted, suffering in the most spectacular way possible, hips still thrusting into the air as Sherlock continued tracing his name over and over against John's prostate. "Too much." He wheezed. "It's too much."
"Come on. God…want it." Shaun pushed back again, spreading his legs. "Fuck me like this."
A ferocious, yet choked symphony of growls and hitched gasps had greeted John for the last ten minutes, but now he had to pull back, with a frustrated, wordless noise from his detective, who was stroking himself slowly and intensely, his large fist glistening with pre-come, his veins pulsing prominently.
Shaun's face betrayed a brief flicker of emotion, but it quickly regained its impassiveness. "I don't...’love’ you. And now we can't...do what we were doing."
"You don't believe in love?" John lowered the towel to cover his penis, suddenly no longer in the mood. Something horrible and choking rose up through his throat, constricting his chest, as he waited for Sherlock's answer.
His eyes slid almost shut, his mouth falling open in a soundless cry of pleasure.
The third was a natural rush of concern, as he stepped backwards, whilst eyeing the damage Shaun had sustained. "...You…you should be able to set that yourself."
. He's a very nice size now. Sometimes more than I can handle." Sherlock said jovially and Mrs. Watson laughed.
"Oh, lord." Sherlock heard John sigh as he waved back at his parents, faked a cheery smile, and started threading their way over to the table.
," he hissed, before delving back inside Sherlock's arse, flicking his tongue in and out in quick, rapid bursts. Sherlock gasped, high-pitched, grunting, his hand squeezing around his cock but he seemed physically incapable of stroking himself, distracted as John pleasured him.
"Gay? No, I don't think he is. We haven't fully discussed it yet but I think he's bisexual. Sexuality is so fluid and changing anyway, there shouldn't be a box for one person or the other to have to squash themselves in."
"For what?" John placed his hand over Sherlock's and gave it a squeeze. "None of this is your fault." He tugged at Sherlock's hand until he rose up on his knees and let John kiss him. Sherlock sighed into the kiss, but pulled back prematurely.
"Where's Sherlock?" John grated out the words from a dry, scratchy throat.
Sherlock had once scoffed, near the beginning of their acquaintance. “
"Um. Right. O-ok." John cleared his throat. "If that's what you want-"
"Mm...why don't you...take over," John grinned clownishly, bright-eyed and red-faced as he rolled them once more, spreading his own legs, hauling the taller man down upon him roughly, and chuckling at the dizzy expression it garnered from Sherlock.
“How about I ask
"Then stop coddling me and let me suck your cock!"
Sherlock stared up at John for a few seconds before pushing him away and racing for his wardrobe.
"Hurry." Sherlock tossed his head back, extending the line of his throat, knowing how he looked- John cursed, shoving a slickened finger into Sherlock's arse wholly without grace.
Almost an hour later, John was amending his previous assumption.
"Fuck, Sherlock…Let’s…take this to the bedroom. Need to...lie down." He admitted, grimacing as if the admission were something shameful. Sherlock sprang up from his crouch, giving John's cock a lingering stroke. "After you." He murmured and John, feeling a bit like a tit with his cock hanging out of the fly of his jeans, hobbled down the hall, Sherlock hot on his heels.
"Oh...
Sherlock, ducking his head to hide his blush, extended a hand to John's and gave it a passionate squeeze, before intertwining their admittedly mis-matched fingers in the dim heat which enveloped them in their sweet, dark cocoon, in their bed in their flat in Central London.
"Then why do they even bother making them?" Sherlock groused, only to pause, staring at the strip of paper. "To my darling consulting detective whose arse...makes my mouth water." Sherlock blushed and glanced across at John. “You-“
John blinked at the back of his friend's head, frowning in bemusement, and only became annoyed when he realised that they weren't on a case, and weren't even out of the flat. Sherlock had seemingly just decided to join John in his bed without permission. Not that John would give him that permission. John reached for his plain bedside lamp and switched it on, bathing them in a soft, weak light that was thankfully soothing, rather than eye-watering. He scrubbed his eyes roughly and then glanced around at his clock, which blandly displayed 11pm on the dot.
His lips were motionless as he openly gawped, face reddening further in reaction, “
A hefty sigh from the detective.
"How about...here?" John asked, fingers tracing above Sherlock's patch of dark, curly hair around his now soft cock. "Would that be ok?"
"Yeah...yeah…it's fine. You're great, love." John babbled, frantically stroking at his cock, expecting to feel Sherlock tense at any second, coming with a tiny, broken cry-
Indisposed in my room. Hurry up. – SH
An impish expression rippled across Sherlock’s face, so he hid it into John’s shoulder for a few seconds, and darted his gaze around the room in nervous anticipation, “And
"How in hell did you get all that?" Lestrade asked. "I only sent you a few pictures-"
"No problem," Sherlock croaked deliriously, broad chest heaving, dewdrops of sweat shining on his collarbone, his upper lip, his forehead.
"Get the lube." Sherlock commanded. "Get yourself ready."
"I want you to be hard," Sherlock said suddenly, awkwardly swiping his tongue across his plump bottom lip. "I want us to do it properly. Like real people."
Mrs Hudson sighed and gave him a soft, knowing smile. A mothering smile.
"Hey! Fairies! I'm talking to you."
at the state of you," John told him with some fondness. "Is it okay if I undress you?"
Sherlock winced, shooing John's hand away from his very over-sensitised shaft. "I wanted to have sex with you." he said simply, glancing around the room and biting the inside of his mouth as his brow crinkled. "I ruined it."
Sherlock was flushing over some of the more ribald comments- one man going so far as to ask John if Sherlock's arse was as tight as it looked- when Shaun snorted. "Go ahead and take the little princess home, John. But when he can't take your cock, my offer still stands."
Before anyone knew it, the detective was sprinting down the sumptuous hallway, bellowing over his shoulder. "Run, John!"
"Do you really want it to be over quickly?" The taller man asked in a voice as deep and dark and inflammatory as a lungful of coal. "I can make it last as long as you need. Or...as long as I want."
"Didn't it hurt?" John asked cautiously, though a small, dark part of his psyche goaded him by letting him know, like a vindictive little gremlin at the back of his brain, that he was more than happy to fuck Sherlock's throat raw if his lover were amenable to the idea. Sherlock shrugged.
"I trust you. Do whatever you want." John agreed and Sherlock hummed, staring at John's stretched out body, speculative. His hands hovered over the bared skin as if he didn't know what part of John's body to touch first. John laughed self-consciously as Sherlock's semi-ministrations caused his cock to pulse visibly.
And it was fine, he thought, nodding and forcing a smile as Shaun slipped past him, giving John a parting smile. It was really fine. They were just fucking. They'd always been fucking. Just a way to get off. Nice and uncomplicated.
“And neither will you, presumably. Tired, yeah? Knees weak? Heart still racing a bit? We can give the case a pass, if you're not feeling up to it?"
"You know that....there's no..." Sherlock paused to spit out a choking coagulation of saliva and vibrant blood, before inhaling bravely. "There's absolutely no proof that eating human flesh...prolongs life." Shuddering, he fought back another gagging mouthful of blood as he was kicked viciously in the side.
John gave out a splutter just as Greg choked on his own tongue, and the atmosphere around them was suddenly so thick with awkwardness that John could hardly take a breath.
Lestrade chuckled, a bit uncomfortable because it was Sherlock but willing to share the joke all the same. Sherlock pursed his lips, spinning away from the two men, disgruntled.
This telling pronouncement was met with winks and nudges and Shaun, looking cocky, sidled closer to Sherlock.
"Yeah but...you've been...getting off w'others. Haven't you?" John picked at him, wriggling his hips when Shaun scissored his fingers. He wanted him to touch his prostate again- not sure if he liked it or not- but Shaun didn't.
"Mm. Yes, I did but that doesn't necessarily mean I meant...sexually."
Her face was actually stinging with embarrassment, and she felt nothing but relief when Sherlock stopped eyeing her knowingly, and abruptly tidied himself up, getting down to business.
"What are you talking about?"
"But you'll-"
"Is that what we are?" All the lovely, lazy lassitude was gone from Sherlock's face, leaving behind a fragile sharpness that made John regret ever bringing it up. "Are we just...just...fuck buddies? Someone you can have a quick one-off with and not worry about entanglements?"
"Wait, wait, wait!" He hissed and John immediately stopped, dropping the belt, his hands smoothing over the welts on Shaun's body.
"Seriously, Sherlock, just let it go. Come back to bed." He grasped his hand, tugging Sherlock down the hall. "You haven't come yet, darling. I'll make you feel
Without further ado, the taller man threw himself on the bed and kicked off the rest of his clothes with minimal decorum. Feeble amber streetlamps shed just enough maudlin yellow light to illuminate the room.
In the end, John chose for him- unzipping his fly and taking himself in hand, pulling Sherlock closer and kissing him as his hand worked frantically at his cock. The kiss was sloppy, wet, delicious. Loathe as he was to break it, Sherlock pulled back, his eyes hazy and deepened to a satisfied deep-green.
big of a knife, Sherlock!" John darted forward, taking away the bloody Japanese
"That or one of your experiments blew up and now your eyebrows are singed away."
," John keened, barely allowing Sherlock a second to recover as he snuggled in close, spreading the detective's weak and trembling arms and settling in for a fierce kiss.
"Course I'm all right. Bloody...fantastic." Shaun sighed, relaxing against John for a few seconds, then heaved another sigh and rolled away. "Need to get cleaned up. Have to make it back to my bunk before inspection."
Sherlock gave John a shy look from beneath his eyelashes. "Great?"
Sherlock and John began casually walking away, not looking back, when a sudden shout rang out behind them.
Sherlock grimaced and huffed, “John, listen…you…I mean,
No amount of distraction, or drugs, or determination to put mind over matter, could change the fact that, quite simply, Sherlock was a man, and he had needs.
Pen. – SH
Sherlock was studying.
"Watson." Shaun looked surprised. "Wasn't expecting to see you here. Weren't you taking McMinn's shift today?"
John didn't know what to say, torn between outright rejecting him for a deed that might emotionally scar him even more, and grudgingly accepting. He felt Sherlock's large, cool hands slowly, so slowly, pull his own towards his crotch.
John smirked, snapping the batteries into place with promising clicks. "You won't die, Sherlock. People don't die from not having an orgasm. You should just be grateful I've relented."
John picked up the pace of the toy, moving it faster over the slick length of Sherlock's cock, thrusting lightly into Sherlock's mouth, his cock tingling with the pressure. "
Something was wrong. John could tell, the knowledge filtering through his brain and leaving his chest tight.
Sherlock thought quickly. "On my face. My shirt." These were the two most obvious choices. Easily recognized. Everyone would know, when they got back to the table, what the stains were.
John, stretched out on the bed, just laughed, enjoying the view of Sherlock, pale and nude, rifling through his wardrobe.
He hissed as John began enthusiastically lapping at his entrance, the doctors' hands kneading eagerly at the tight muscles of Sherlock's backside. He still, though, couldn't quite dissipate the anxiety that he sensed still dwelt inside John, and he grimaced as he felt his erection starting to flag once again.
"Don't know why you did that." He said, smiling as he carefully dabbed at the raw, open place. "You could have just...let it out, Sherlock. No one would have heard you."
"No offense, John, it's all in good fun. It's just...well, after having so many women, you'd naturally go for a bit of a ladyboy."
"Return the favour?" the doctor asked ambiguously, dark eyes twinkling.
"Spare me your drunken platitudes." He said as soon as he sensed John's footsteps entering the living room. If they were going to fight, it was best to start off being prickly and mean instead of soft and embarrassed.
The ride to the museum where the exhibit was being held was silent but filled with excited tension. Sherlock was so wound up and eager he couldn't sit still. He absently drummed his fingers on the side of his seat as if urging the cab faster. He shot John happy smiles and fidgeted, twisting around in his seat to look at the passing city as if he were a tourist. John captured Sherlock's drumming fingers with his own and gave him a patient smile but didn't reprimand him or tell him to calm down. Ever since they'd heard that Gunther von Hagens was coming to London, it'd been all Sherlock could talk about. John knew more about von Hagens and his techniques and his exhibits than anyone else, just from listening to Sherlock rhapsodize about him.
He pulled the trigger.
John ran the back of his hand across his forehead, blowing out a sharp exhale and squinting his eyes at the setting sun, which was an eye-watering, dizzyingly hot fireball. The occasional gusts of air that swirled around him were warm and offered little respite as he and Sherlock entered the ornate gates of the park.
Mrs Hudson cleared her throat and brought one of the china cups to her lips.
Sherlock nodded, glancing down to where John was still hard.
"Okay. I'm....alright," Sherlock announced in a fragile yet deep voice, his eyes concentrated on the soft, wet target between John's legs. He applied lubricant to his cock and then nudged forward a few awkward centimetres on his knees, pressing his eager, swollen tip to John's entrance, huffing a couple of grounding breaths before easing forward. John took a deep breath and tensed when the head of Sherlock's cock popped past the first ring of his muscles and Sherlock froze, tensing himself and gripping John tightly.
“We’re not a couple!”
-" John shouted which Sherlock immediately obeyed, pistoning his hand faster and rotating his wrist a bit, searching...
“Y-es.” The hesitation was absolutely microscopic but John picked it up nevertheless.
Comments and kudos make me very, very happy :D
. Happy? I drank. Hooray.”
worked. Nor has gentle persuasion, aggressive persuasion, begging... I fear I'm running out of options."
Sherlock didn't respond, only lifting his hips to slowly sink his cock into John, provoking a curse and shudder from the former soldier. "I said fuck. Yourself. On my cock, John." Sherlock rumbled, grasping his hips and pulling him down onto his cock. Hard. John saw stars.
"Oh. Sorry about that." He cleared his throat awkwardly, wondering if he should leave or-
With the pen. – SH
Sherlock obliged, bending his leg at the knee and raising it, giving John more room to insinuate himself between his legs. It left Sherlock feeling ridiculously exposed, especially considering that now since he had come, he was becoming more aware of how silly he must look- sweaty, covered in his own come.
Slightly irked that he could coax no further movement or any sound whatsoever from the detective, who was barely reciprocating, John broke the rather one-sided kiss. He moved back only far enough to be able to focus on Sherlock’s blush-stained face, his embarrassment painted like exquisite red ink on virgin porcelain.
"John," he began in a trembly baritone, before stopping, literally not knowing what he wanted to express.
“Turn away, please.”
Sherlock’s thighs violently shook, and he whimpered through gritted teeth, shooting a glare over his shoulder that looked highly and wantonly erotic, “
"What do you want, love?" John asked, breaking into Sherlock's embarrassingly maudlin thoughts. John toyed with Sherlock's belt, each movement making something low and hot thud in arousal in Sherlock's abdomen. "What do you want?"
Mycroft rolled his eyes, and sighed dramatically, before deigning to respond. They both bounced inelegantly as the car pulled away, swerving rather awkwardly out of the path of a particularly egregious taxi.  "How am I ashamed by you? Let me count the ways," Mycroft uttered irritably.
He undid the latch quickly, but Sherlock roughly shoved the window open with a bang before he could make any further move.
Sherlock jerked so hard against his restraints he knew he would have bruises later. At the moment, he couldn't be bothered to care.
Sherlock smiled, his eyes going slanted and he glanced down at John's lips. "I'd like to indulge you...if you're amenable."
"I haven't poked anywhere Molly hasn't given me permission to," Sherlock retorted, ruffling his wet curls once more, unaware he'd said the most suggestive thing yet. "Molly...I need to dry off."
"What do you think you're do-
you a fair bit. And I fancied staying home. I didn't know you were going to be such a grump."
"Why?... why you gay?" John managed, eyes bleary as he frowned upwards at the Irishman, who was, increasingly impatiently, working him open, making little noises of satisfaction and urgent need.
He slowly moved the barrel of the gun in and out of Shaun's mouth, teasing him with it, withdrawing it completely and watching his tongue snake out and lick the end. John's cock strained, swollen and aching, inside the constraints of his coarse uniform. It gave a massive throb when Shaun narrowed the tip of his tongue like a lizard and prodded it against the hollow metal barrel filthily. He grinned, before murmuring dramatically.
..." John moaned, bucking into Sherlock's body reflexively, his body fighting against his desire to keep this slow and gentle. John managed to gain control of himself with another shudder and leaned down to mouth against Sherlock's neck as he moved his hips in a ceaseless, steady rhythm, rocking into Sherlock again and again.
"Oh, John," Sherlock leaned closer, clenching his fingers in the duvet to keep himself from touching. John didn't bother to mask the sloppy, gulping sounds that accompanied a real blow-job, and Sherlock stared even more fervently, his expression bordering on wild, and his body reacting in a very enthusiastic, revealing way.
"My brother. Edward. You're the one who put him in jail last year. All because of you."
"No." Sherlock lied. "I...hardly notice it. It's just my body, John. It's become used to regular orgasms, for the release. But I'm in control of myself. I...am perfectly fine."
The displays were severely sparse, the complete opposite of what John was used to when he went clothes shopping, usually in a busy shopping centre. He wouldn't have known what to do with any of it, but Sherlock strode around, looking at things with a critical eye while John pretended he wasn't feeling massively out of place.
"Feeling better?"
A collective, stifled chorus of gasps, screams, and groans swelled into the air as John winced and shook his left hand, wiping away the scarlet blood smeared across his knuckles with a grimace.
Sherlock cocked his head as if he were studying something under his scope.
"Sherlock?" he whispered croakily. "You...okay?"
His body felt as if it weren't his own. Even more so since, a few days ago, the staff had decided he would be able to walk himself to the loo and back. When his leg had gone out from under him, suddenly and unexpectedly, John had been shocked. After the battery of tests, trying to determine the cause of his limp, it was found out...nothing. Psychosomatic. John sighed. Great.
"Oh John," Sherlock whispered, breathing heavily. "Oh John that was perfect. That was beautiful."
to see him naked. He'd said as much earlier.
There was a tremulous, palpable silence, and the squirt of cheap commercial coffee dousing John's paper cup was almost deafening in the long, excruciating twenty seconds that it took to fill it up. The rain outside had long ceased, but the room was drenched in a faintly damp, grey, and thoroughly dispiriting atmosphere.
John was suspicious. "For what?"
Once, John had even resorted to paging Sherlock over the intercom as if he were a wayward child. Sherlock had arrived at the appropriate till with his arms full of avocados, beanie babies, and cool whip, insisting they were all essential for his new experiment and pouting until John bought them for him.
"John!" Sherlock writhed, spreading his legs wider as if that would help John and the doctor grinned before delving his tongue past the first ring of muscles. Sherlock cried out, entire body spasming in a paradox of surprise and pleasure.
"Christ." John shut his eyes in irritation, beyond annoyed with the interrogation-
Sherlock squirmed. He shrugged.
"Here." He handed Sherlock the loofah, smirking.
Despite everything, Sherlock couldn't help but sneer at the appearance of a cheap plastic spork, obviously procured from KFC, that his tormentor was dabbing into the meaty mush, preparing to feed him.
The one in the living room. - SH
“Ignore her. Stay here?" the taller man asked, his sweet smile tainted with the garish purple bruises decorating his face.
"What does that even mean?"
"Old army friend. Got an email from him a few days ago. We're supposed to meet up. A bunch of us. For drinks." John shuddered, a full-body tremor, his cock incredibly sensitive.
"N-no! I want it! Don't be ridiculous." He wrapped himself around John, laying his head on his chest and sagging against him. "Tell me.”
"Sherl…
He slid back into the bed, which seemed oddly-shadowed now the curtain encompassed it. He leaned forward and kissed the tip of Sherlock's nose, nuzzling it with his own, before speaking softly against his mouth.
"Course I'm here. I was just out in the hall talking to your brother. He's got some questions for you, of course, since you were out on his assignment." John's voice was clipped, betraying his anger which he was obviously trying to stifle since Sherlock was still in hospital and hooked to IV's and multiple machines.
"...I thought it went well...why would you say that? Did it not go well?"
Sherlock emitted a throttled, harsh noise that John didn’t think he’d ever heard before. The detective’s strong thighs reflexively tightened around John’s head, before easing back.
"Is it loaded?" Shaun asked, on all fours on a sand-dusted canvas, his short dark hair scraping audibly against the sharp plastic. He bit back a breathless laugh as John bit down hard on his backside, kneading his fingers just a little
After Sherlock had wiped himself free of his imaginary semen, he tossed the dry tissue in the bin and disengaged from John, reaching for his phone and feeling irrationally resentful as John started waxing lyrical behind him.
John followed him, taking one of Sherlock's hands and kissing the back of it, in a move that baffled the detective a little, but that he enjoyed nevertheless.
It matters, John thought. It matters a whole fucking lot, you wanker. "Condoms or we're through. And no more kissing either."
She felt like an idiot for having made the fantasy...but luckily no one but herself would know about it. Maybe, after John and Sherlock settled down, she'd power up her laptop and scroll through her usual porn websites, get herself off to much safer material than what was going on next door.
“Anything.” John smiled, eyes tracing Sherlock’s still come-covered face. “What’s going through that gorgeous brain of yours?”
“Don’t misunderstand, you
"Duly noted," he grinned. "I ordered it online for your birthday…but there was a problem with stock for a while…I tried again, it should be here in the next few days."
“Would have thought woodlice were a bit pedestrian for you,” John commented lightly, glancing up at his petulant flatmate. “Surely you were pulling them apart as a five-year-old in the garden. Come to think of it, most five-year-olds probably were.”
"You did that to yourself too, Sherlock. I've already looked at it and it's not bad. It'll just be a bit tender for a few days. Or it will be if you
“Isn’t that a…
John felt his mouth go dry, blinking a few times before leaning forward. He ran a stripe with the flat of his tongue over Sherlock's cock, humming at the salty taste clinging to the throbbing muscle before suckling at the head. He couldn't believe the amount of pre-come Sherlock had produced - the man must have really been chasing his orgasm. He heard Sherlock gasp and before he could take another breath, John reached up with his hand and ran his thumb over Sherlock's quivering hole, letting his lips curl around his cock and take him a little deeper into his mouth.
.' Surely that was a regular article in the women's magazines she seemed adamant on purchasing (and collecting. The earliest ones he'd seen in the huge stack in her front room, dated 2008, had exactly the same front cover headlines as all the subsequent ones.) Being able to please the potential father of your future offspring seemed to be a recurring feature.
"You mean…um...
"Probably just needs a good fucking. Top or bottom, though? C'mon, any takers? That fairy he dates may have said he fucks John but I've seen pictures of him. That Sherlock fag looks so slutty I bet he rolls right over and begs John to fuck him, like a dog. Fucking disgusting."
"Oh. Oh well...I- I guess it was n-normal. Nothing...extraordinary." Molly stuttered and John, never one to deny Sherlock, pressed a pad and pen into his hand.
"I get your arse every other day.
understand?"
"I've owned various toys since I was a teenager." Sherlock said, opening his eyes to watch John caress and fondle his toy with undisguised lust. "It's always been...difficult- almost impossible- for me to reach orgasm on my own. I quickly realized I needed either the aid of someone else or, since I detest most people, the aid of a toy. I've had multiple ones throughout the years…but I bought that one months ago, shortly before we started having sex, because I thought it would help me...acclimatize myself to being penetrated regularly."
"So I can do incredibly naughty things to you."
The tell-tale click of an empty chamber was almost as shocking to both men as the explosive bang of a fatally-loaded one would have been. Shaun grated out an animalistic, hoarse scream, his hips locked and his arms trembling violently as he climaxed. He clenched tightly around John's cock, shuddering, and John wasn't far behind, coming with a muffled cry against Shaun's shoulder.
"Why?"
"Well for that, I'm not talking about that."
The bright dawn painted Sherlock's body in yellow light, revealing the creamy smoothness of his skin, sprinkled with a smattering of fine, pale hair. The alluring curve of his side and hip where the sheets had fallen low, his legs splayed, one knee crooked and slung over John. His hair glinted with auburn highlights in the sun, the tousled curls almost artfully arranged and begging John to plunge his fingers through them.
John sat back and, biting his bottom lip as he knelt above Sherlock's knees, took hold of his own hard cock. He immediately started a forceful rhythm of mindless, animalistic thrusts into his own fist, exuding constant, shaky groans.
Sherlock was about to demand that John stay and comfort him, but he startled and stared when Greg's hand landed on his arm, and the DI began to mollify him instead. "Sit down Sherlock, let's chat."
Sherlock reacted with a garbled groan of pleasure and shock, jolting at the feeling, “
"Oh. Yes, please, John." Sherlock breathed, heart starting up a fast tempo at the idea. "Now?" He asked, starting to drop to his knees but John grabbed him, standing and giving him a shove in the direction of the living room.
“At least move then, you great lump,” John chuckled.
"How far would you go to protect me?" John asked out of the blue, gnawing on his thin bottom lip.
"How long into the relationship was it before he shagged you?"
John stripped on the periphery of the communal barracks shower room, brazenly shedding his clothes and neatly folding them so they wouldn't touch the ground. The soldiers' shower room smelled like piss and looked even worse. They were more likely to get even dirtier attempting their ablutions (or, worse, catch cholera), but there weren't other choices for getting clean and John was sticky and exhausted. He just wanted the soothing sensation of cool water on his dehydrated, sunburnt skin.
John made a noise of agreement, taking it as a personal insult that Sherlock was more interested in the case than him sucking his cock. It should be the other way around.
"Yeah." John groaned, gasping when Sherlock repeated the movement again and again, cock starting to leak at the tip. "Add a-another."
"I'm ready," he murmured, blinking away a rogue, stinging bead of sweat as it burned down from his hairline.
dumped,” the detective said flatly.
John surged forward, fervently kissing Sherlock and he moaned into John's mouth. They hadn't kissed like this in the past three weeks. Little pecks, a few longer kisses, but nothing...nothing like this. Sherlock's eyes rolled back in his head when John's tongue invaded his mouth and he clutched John's body to him, rutting against his hip. Sherlock's pyjama bottoms were becoming unpleasantly sticky as more and more precome spooled from his tip, but he didn't dare attempt to remove or even adjust them lest he distracted John and snapped him out of the glorious, deep, penetrating snog he was receiving. He couldn't, however, restrain the small, breathless exhales that were noisily exposing his true desperation in the otherwise-silent pre-dawn gloom.
"Don't be angry with me." Sherlock pleaded and John sighed again, brushing his thumb along Sherlock's severely-bruised cheekbone delicately.
Sherlock moaned. "I'm...I'm in you," he gasped, hips jerking slightly. "I'm inside of you and it feels...
"Oh! Oh, you're getting married!" She cried happily, eyes watering and flicking between the pair of them. She wrung her hands before they strayed to clench against her chest.
He winced as he got out of the cab, trying to hide from Sherlock just how dodgy his leg had gotten. It was psychosomatic- all in his head- the panic attack he'd had the previous day bringing Afghanistan, and therefore his injury, rushing back. His leg buckled, threatened to fold, and John passed it off as pausing in front of the door, staring up at the hotel speculatively.
John’s grip on Sherlock’s heat-damp hand tightened minutely. “Oh…wow, Sherlock…”
Tuning out the rest of John's well-known and oft-recited speech, Sherlock glanced down to where John's smaller but undeniably strong fingers gripped his slim hips and he swallowed at the pressure which was being exerted on the ghosts of bruises which the same army doctor had created time after time in the past during less angry, but equally-heated encounters.
fine…”
Panting only slightly, John tossed Sherlock one of the flannels, the cloth smacking wetly onto his pale skin. Sherlock, his eyes closed, didn't even flinch.
have a hair fetish, don't you?" Sherlock asked, watching John. John eyed the thick, white, rapidly-drying liquid which was congealing in the dark locks.
“You’re an idiot.” Sherlock yanked the sheet music from her hands and flounced over to the sofa, promptly throwing himself down, covering his face with the scribbled papers, and folding his arms resolutely. “By the way, don’t move that bowl, there’s a poison-dart frog underneath it,” came his muffled instruction. “
"Don't be daft." Sherlock cut off John's nervous rambling. "Of course I want to spend the next ten years with you."
Sherlock smirked, settling back, not looking the least bit repentant. "Fun, was it?"
"...Get off again?" Sherlock asked, preparing to take a new, heated inhale, but was briefly interrupted by a cool, collected drip of John's semen upon his bottom lip. Ingesting it surreptitiously, he spoke again. "...Um...John, you just came? You probably can't do it again so soon."
"Yes...
John laughed into the wet kiss and met him with his own erection, hissing raggedly at the sensation, "
. Come here." He said brusquely, grabbing John's hand and towing him quickly away from the throng of people. John stumbled, spilling his fancy drink. "Sherlock! What-?"
"Pardon me for not trying to stick my cock in everything that has a pulse unlike some people." Sherlock hissed, keeping his eyes focused on the screen, bringing up random websites in order to look busy.
“I look half naked and ridiculously out of place beside someone who’s still
“…You are, in a way. I’ve never kissed a man before.” John met his glance briefly and continued. “I’ve, you know, used…hands a couple of times. But kissing seemed a bit too…”
“Oh, it was fine dears, fine. I’ve bought far too much food from the little farm shops there, I got you both a few things. I’ll pop by this evening with them. Oh, this is yours,” she smiled, handing John the innocuously-branded white, heavy parcel.
, I'm...I'm-...
Sherlock opened his mouth, but found he didn’t quite have anything to say to that. Huffily re-adjusting himself on the bench, he glared at the trudging, weary-hyper hordes of tourists filing past, before speaking up again quietly. “If you say ‘thank you,’ it kills a fairy.”
He'd always been attracted to Sherlock, ever since the first day they'd met- and every other encounter since then had made John addicted to the person that was Sherlock Holmes. It wasn't just Sherlock's body and face he adored, but his mind. His wit. His personality. John had fallen for it all- and hard- but he'd always thought...well, that nothing would come of it.
"We're not supposed to be in here together." Sherlock whispered shakily, staring down at his dominating boyfriend with wide eyes.
is a plasticised baboon liver."
"I want you to
, John." Sherlock scoffed. "I
"I know what you meant." John growled, irritated, and set back to work sucking Sherlock's cock. Only...the wanker
"No...It's...please..." John could feel his throat closing up, panic swamping him as he tried to understand that it had been a dream. A useless, idiotic dream. "It's not...It was real. I know it-"
Sherlock optimistically pushed another two fingers at his entrance, wincing a bit before they too were engulfed, and he exhaled loudly at the pressure, struggling to keep his body from rejecting the intrusion, closing his eyes as he imagined the stiff cock that would soon be replacing them.
"It's not vindictive." He murmured softly. "I just… Christ, Sherlock what were you thinking?"
. Just put them on and come here and kiss me." John yanked down his own boxers and kicked away the duvet, pushing his laptop to the floor with a dull 'clunk.'
As it was, he yelped under his breath, both hands instinctively cupping the back of John's head and kneading as his hips began to writhe inadvertently but sensually. His thighs came up, bracketing John's body between them as John lowered his mouth the rest of the way down, until his nose was almost flush with the dark brown curls surrounding Sherlock's cock.
He leaned down, snatching his phone and thumbed another text to his infuriating landlady.
“Fuck, she’ll probably be straight up here,” John muttered, getting off of Sherlock’s lap and chucking a cushion in the direction of his detective’s crotch. “Don’t tell her anything yet. And don’t embarrass me.”
Sherlock's eyes fluttered open, his cheeks flushed a very becoming pink from his orgasm, and John couldn't help grinning. "John." Sherlock heaved in a sumptuous, breathless voice, his pale chest expanding and deflating with a rapid rhythm. "That was the best sex I've ever had."
"Those men wouldn't have bothered us if I hadn't been involved."
The detective appeared to short-circuit slightly, eyes unfocussing and lips parting minutely. It tended to happen when he was overwhelmed by conflicting data and his own corresponding reactions.
Sherlock snorted and then chuckled deeply, “I suppose it
“Just what?” John prompted gently.
John sealed their lips together and Sherlock hummed, arching against John's body, trying to get closer which was impossible. He made a valiant effort. He thrust against John, rubbing his cock against his doctor’s hip.
And John doubtlessly wouldn't ravage Sherlock if he kept his trousers on.
"Fuck- fuck,
"...Yes!" Sherlock suddenly exclaimed, rather loudly, sounding very pleased with himself. "I saw this in a porn!"
arse. Seriously," he cooed.
Sherlock felt John chuckle into the kiss, his lips curving up even as he kissed him. Sherlock, feeling shaky, strained up, wanting more. Impulsively, he stuck his tongue out, without grace or finesse, against John's closed lips and John made a surprised noise, pulling away. Sherlock's hands slipped from around his neck.
John, frustrated and angry, was knuckling his eyes sleepily when Sherlock, looking fresh as a daisy, but nowhere near as happy, appeared in the doorway and chucked his own mobile onto John's lap.
think with either, John,” Sherlock said, his indifferent tone and blank stare revealing nothing about whether John’s almost-insult had penetrated his stubborn psyche.
He eased the gun from Shaun's mouth and Shaun's panted breaths were suddenly loud in the otherwise silent room.
"After." Sherlock licked his dry lips. "I want...this first."
!" Mrs. Watson cried, holding out her hands and pulling John into a crushing, motherly hug. She was a short woman, plump, with curly blonde hair shot with grey. Nicely done make-up concealed her age but her lips were thin, just like John's. And, also just like John's, seemed to always be smiling.
"Take a wild guess." John grunted back, skilfully working his hand over Sherlock's soft shaft. Chuckling softly, he hoped the fucker on the other side of the door realised now that they'd constructed their booths too well. No gaps under, or over, the walls. A completely sealed and now locked room.
John clenched his teeth hard, forehead distorted by anguished crinkles, and as Sherlock's blood-hot release flooded inside him, he struggled on the absolute brink of his own orgasm, body juddering in need. "Sherl...Sherl...more...
He opened his eyes, staring at John's sleeping form laid out on the bed, still and quiet and unaware of what Sherlock was doing. For how much longer? How much time did he have before John woke? He had to finish this- now- before John came awake.
Sherlock's eyes flicked around John's face, trying to pick up clues as to how he was supposed to follow through with that suggestion. What would that entail? What did John expect? What did he himself expect? Sherlock finally reached the conclusion that they should probably both be naked and plucked at his clothes, tossing them to the side before devoting himself to gently removing John's towel and helping him slide backward on the bed, resting his head against the pillows.
? Sherlock couldn't believe his luck, some part of his distracted brain asking whether John actually meant what he was saying, or was just expressing the most efficient phrases in order to dump someone quickly and with minimal fuss.
“Funny?” Sherlock repeated and his nose brushed against John’s for one, small, fleeting moment. The detective continued his kneading of John’s taut muscles regardless of John’s words or their close proximity. He was oddly skilled and though some of his digging, working digits made John’s arm and shoulder twinge, it left pleasantly tingly warmth behind. “Funny how?”
Sherlock was flushed, his hands knotted in the sheets as he watched John ride out the last waves of his climax. John's eyes dropped to his groin, expecting to find Sherlock's prick hard, looking forward to maybe being allowed to help him get himself off.
Sherlock offered the doe-eyed, innocent look that he had perfected when he was a child, and which still seemed to work, at least on his doctor.
, please let me…I can’t…” John managed in a croaky voice, eyes closed, his soaked ash-brown hair now the colour of wet sand. There was an audible scrape as the doctors’ fingernails raked into the sheets. The detective could see the faint, frantic pulse in the veins of John’s knuckles, and it thrilled him.
John bit his bottom lip and halted for a second, gasping inelegantly, his eyes still tightly closed. "Don't want to come too soon." He admitted, panting. A stab of envy went through Sherlock's chest at John's self-control and he glared up at the other man, trying to read what was doing through his mind from the little twitches in his face.
The park was at almost peak capacity, too, with numerous groups of people lounging about, sunbathing, picnicking on the browning grass - families, couples, groups of students, a few solitary people clutching books or kindles (and that was just in the immediate vicinity. The park was huge). People were traversing the terrain, dogs running around, children splashing in the fountain and screaming with youthful joy.  And John was letting them all know, in a very obvious way, that he and Sherlock were together.
He heard John's heavy tread on the stairs and curled tighter, pulling his dressing gown around himself and wishing he were invisible.
“What…does that mean?” Sherlock muttered as he glanced down with a twitch of his thighs. He flicked his eyes to where John’s fingers were and John noticed that his shaft throbbed and engorged further in interest.
Shaun licked his lips, staring at Sherlock before his eyes strayed to John. "Maybe I was a bit wrong about your boyfriend, John. Seems like he's just as freaky as you used to be."
No response.
"You won't be satisfied with that princess for long." Shaun whispered, aware they had an audience, jerking his head towards the direction Sherlock had gone. "That little pillow queen probably barely knows what to do with your cock, much less where to stick it."
"Oh- F-!" John squeezed Sherlock's hand with surprising strength as he climaxed. Sherlock watched, fascinated, as John’s cock spurted come in much more watery stripes than before, but still in larger-than-normal quantities. He licked his lips.
"What?" John dragged his eyes away from where he'd been staring vaguely at Sherlock's bare chest and frowned at him. "What'd you say?"
"Here. Just let me..." John swiped at his skin with paper from the stall and Sherlock let him clean him up, feeling an odd sort of tenderness at the clinical action.
think is happening here? You said that I need to understand it. Understand
"Oh god." John breathed, visibly trembling, cock so hard it was almost purple and stretched against his stomach. "Yes. Fine, yes. Just-" Sherlock gave a greedy thrust into John and he cried out, a desperate wail as he began bouncing on Sherlock's cock again. Sherlock heard the noises from the other couple falter.
His doctor emitted a small, aborted groan as Sherlock's skilled fingers left the vicinity of his own body. "Um…Sherlock..." he huffed with a short laugh, tugging demonstratively at the tight silk ties binding his wrists. "It's getting pretty hard."
“…I love you, you know,” Sherlock mumbled in such a low, vibrating baritone that for a moment, John wasn’t sure he’d heard what he had, especially when Sherlock’s hand moved down to pat his back and move away again.
“It wouldn’t be the first time, dear.”
"If I leave now and purchase more pineapple and ingest enough of it, I should perhaps be ready for you in 24 hours." Sherlock explained eagerly, still trembly and tripping over the recently-acquired fulgurite that he had left on the bedroom floor, and fell heavily, staggering against the wardrobe door. Unfazed, Sherlock pulled it open and rummaged frantically through his clothes.
John paused, obviously surprised, but gave Sherlock an open, pleased smile. "Good. I hope I never do anything to break that." He cleared his throat and looked away, eyes dropping to the toy he still held. He gave Sherlock a wicked grin, plucking up the lube and poured it into the opening of the toy. Sherlock watched with morbid fascination, his mouth going dry and his cock flexed in eagerness.
"…Pity's sake, Sherlock," John uttered without vitriol, leaning out of the bed and rummaging in the pile of old envelopes, letters, sheet music and printed emails, attempting to scoop it up. One card that was edged in gold-embossing caught his eye, and he swore quietly as he remembered its origin.
Sherlock, glancing back at John, halted his empty trolley in barely-restrained irritation, practically baring his teeth at his partner. "John! Not now! We need the pineapples. We don't have time to waste on your airy-fairy browsing habit."
"John, you're perfect," he whispered through heart-shaped lips.
"Anything in particular?" Sherlock asked, swivelling around and fixing John with his penetrating gaze. John decided, not for the first time in any of his communications with Sherlock, to be utterly and totally frank.
," Sherlock groaned, collapsing back onto the sofa, gasping wheezily, his bright, grey-green eyes staring at something beyond the ceiling. John grinned, getting up on sore legs and pecking him on the cheek.
