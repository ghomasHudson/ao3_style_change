The medical bay door opens and Gabriel checks if Lilith is in the main area before Dean gestures to the office door. Gabriel holds up a crowbar left by one of the inmates that had been asked to fix a cabinet there. Dean takes the crowbar from him and goes straight for the open office, peeking in to see Lilith just as she brings Adam into a chokehold.
"Is it? Funny," Cas says, distracted, and he quickly leaves the office without regarding Dean again.
There, he sees Ishim with some other inmates watching a rerun of a football game from about 6 years ago, if Dean could hazard a guess. There’s some Hispanic inmates at one side talking in Spanish, too fast for Dean to pick out even the simplest of words, and one Chinese guy sitting and reading a magazine, one leg propped on the chair.
Castiel and Dean meet up with Meg and Balthazar backstage to approve models, or to switch some of them out for different outfits. Castiel restyles some and picks out accessories and it's like magic to Dean, watching him work. It doesn't take long for Charlie to find them and she gushes about all the ready-to-wear collections that she is "so gonna buy once they're in stock".
"Dean's cooking is awesome," Sam says, gesturing as he speaks. "One time Dad forgot it was my birthday and Dean didn't have time to go buy a proper cake so he made one and it was amazing. I mean, I know it's technically baking, but still."
“No, I understand,” Castiel replies. “I was fearful my first few times flying, but you’ll get used to it. If it helps, you can hold my hand. Kevin comes along sometimes and he’s scared of flying too so I let him.”
Zachariah fixes Meg with a severe stare, thinking about if the Dalí robbers could really do anything to Meg before tonight. He determines that underestimating them is too great a gamble, ordering, "Someone get transport to transfer her to the court!"
Ketch raises a tired eyebrow at her. "You're certain this will work? You and I both know that underestimating their preparedness has been nothing but detrimental to us."
“Thank you,” Castiel says dryly. He changes the subject, questioning, “It’s Valentine’s Day, don’t you have a date or something to get to?”
Dean doesn’t freak out meeting the A-list actor, surprisingly enough, and he doesn’t lose his shit when he gets complimented on the full Ralph Lauren suit that Castiel loaned him from the company’s storage. He doesn’t even spaz out in the limousine ride to the venue with the celebrity in question sitting right across from them.
Cas nods in approval and adds, “Cancel that meeting with Toni Bevell this Friday, I don’t want to see her.”
"Cas, Cas! Wait!" Dean calls out, pulling Cas back by his arm before he can walk down the hall to where the office holding Bevell is at. Cas turns around to face him, murder in his eyes, and Dean cups his face in hopes that it offers some semblance of calm. "Cas, listen to me. We're leaving this afternoon. We are so close. She's not important."
Angeles frowns and reconsiders, peering into a room. "I think I believe in Him... I suppose I'm not sure how much He believes in us."
"Enough times to warrant his termination," Cas answers. "Check if the money I sent to Cole Trenton went through."
For now, though, Dean heads to dinner. Michael’s apparently been spending his evenings at the medical bay with Adam and Anael takes her dinner to the surveillance bubble to eat with Hannah. Cas tends to stay in the chapel because he doesn’t want to remember the worse parts of prison. Gabriel and Dean sit with Alfie who’s actually a good kid. In the back of Dean’s mind, he thinks Alfie would have made a nice addition to their family.
Dad refused to give me dinner yesterday because I didn't come home before 6 (I was distracted texting Cas and missed the bus) so Crowley got me to sneak out my window and took me out to eat with his mom. I love Rowena, man. She's awesome. And Dad's dinner sounded like crap anyway, he just heated up leftover pizza from last night. Leftovers are good, don't get me wrong, but it could be better...
In an attempt to stop Dean and Cas from being alone in the same room, Sam sets out to find them, eventually locating them in the kitchen. He stands at the doorway for a few seconds to make sure they weren't talking about anything incriminating. They're just talking about Dean and his cooking hobby, so Sam comes in with a wide grin. "Hey."
"While we wait, let's get the icing ready," Dean suggests, opening the fridge. He'd gotten started on it beforehand so all Cas and he had left to do was just put it into piping bags.
"Sam?" John slurs, knocking over a book on the mantel to stumble over. Sam grimaces as the book lands with a loud thud on the wooden floorboards. "Where're you?"
"Hello, Charlie!" Bela's bright voice greets them as her heels click down the pavement, Crowley following close behind. Dean guesses Cas invited them to the party. too. She kisses Charlie on both cheeks and simply hugs Dean. "And you, of course. Hi, Dean."
Adam appears in the middle of a white hallway. He looks around, trying to find his way around, but the doors all look the same.
"France. The director of the Paris branch of NOVAK, Cassie Robinson, is going to be on leave for a month regarding a family problem so I offered to oversee the business there in her absence," Cas answers and Dean's jaw drops.
Ultimately, Castiel asked Dean, Gabriel, Meg, Balthazar, Rowena, Kevin and Pamela to go to Fashion Week with him, along with a small team of makeup artists of Gabriel’s selection and a handful of NOVAK’s own models that will walk the runway with the event’s designated models. Anna Milton, one of NOVAK’s models and a childhood friend of Castiel and Gabriel, is coming along. Apparently, all three grew up in the same foster care system and Castiel used to design and make clothes for her when he was bored while Gabriel did makeup for her. Some other NOVAK employees would be in attendance but not in Castiel’s party, like writers or photographers. Charlie was going on her own as well but promised to meet up with them.
Rome alerted Castiel that Windom was trying to call Kansas when Meg and London brought the surgeons in. Since Dean was busy monitoring gold production in place of Crowley, Castiel answered instead to find out that the nurse was the inspector in charge of their case, Sam Winchester, Kansas's brother. Castiel sends Salem to tell Kansas not to come up as Sam is here. While a part of Castiel thought that, maybe, Kansas might have liked to see his long-lost brother, it would be risky. Yes, he could wear a mask and even speak since his voice is modified in the calls, but it's his brother. Who knows what freaky little detail would give it all away?
“Obviously. You and Pax came out of nowhere,” Sam says. His lighthearted tone from earlier has been lost, much to Dean’s remorse. It’s now flat and like he’s just waiting for the conversation to end so he can get a drink. “Look, give it time, okay? He’ll come round.”
“I’m just taking a walk around, getting acquainted. There aren’t really any inmates who know the chapel’s open again so I’m basking in the peace,” Cas says. Rufus chuckles as if he gets what Cas means. “Are you the only one working here?”
"I'm good," Gabriel assures as Rowena finishes up the bandaging. "But can I just stick to guard duty for now?"
"Why would you ask someone else to get it for you?" Dean mutters in irritation. "Fucking dick. If you wanna steal a phone, do it yourself." Angeles furrows his eyebrows, drawing thin lines between them as he cocks his head with the thought of what Dean's trying to do. Dean holds the phone out in his open palm, saying, "You want it? Take it."
"Got it," Dean assures. Michael unlocks the door and announces their arrival, joining Gabriel in the kitchen. Cas comes out of his room and smiles, pulling Dean into a hug.
Jack ambles over clumsily to stand next to Kelly's chair, still looking at Castiel. Castiel answers, "I've told more people. I told my best friend, and Dean's brother and his fiancé. I told someone I only met for the first time that day and it felt so..." Castiel finds more accurate words. "For once, the words didn't feel like a weight. It felt liberating when I told that person."
Cas gives Dean a hug as he promises that he will, and they spend the next hour on the phone with Sam talking about the proposal and Eileen crying about it until Sam has to go for the night. Dean can't stop smiling for the rest of the night until they find their way to Cas's room.
"See ya." Dean waves and Sam leaves the office, already taking out his phone. Dean turns back to look at Cas and says, "God. I'm having a headache just from hearing all that."
Roman nods once. “Appreciate the honesty. I’m inclined to admit that your heists impressed me, so I’m also inclined to overlook this breakout attempt. Do what you want but if you get caught by Intel, you get caught. I’m not involved. Are we clear?”
Anael answers, “Brings in new and SHU-released inmates since SHU’s a different block. Only other transports would be an ambulance but that comes from Washington County Memorial Hospital. On-site, you just have that bus.”
Dean nods again and after Adam finally leaves, Dean heads back to the NOVAK building. When he returns, Cas has his coffee order waiting for him and he doesn’t ask how it goes. Instead, he asks, “Are you ready for work?”
Dean sighs, exasperated, and says, "Yeah, but the whole world saw her almost kill a ‘civilian’ and they just found out three of us got shot, two of which were public. We’re
Cas is different. Cas is good. Cas is like a breath of fresh air after walking through thick fog. Dean likes him a lot.
Dean wakes up first the next morning, groaning as he cracks his back. They fell asleep on the couch and Dean sighs in relief when he realizes that in his slumber, Sam rolled right over the remote, turning the TV off. At least it didn’t keep playing all night long. He clears the pizza boxes and folds up the empty cardboard boxes, putting them neatly by the side of the door.
"That's on them. Who asked them to hijack the Bank of America and kidnap the president's son?" Zachariah challenges.
“Emily Blunt? Holy shit,” Dean practically gasps, trailing behind Castiel in awe as he unlocks his office door. Castiel flashes him a smile.
Rowena wrings her hands together with stress. “I don’t know, something about ballistics, tracing his pistol… Putting his name out to any bounty hunter who would sell him out.” She watches the way Cas fidgets next to her and Dean being completely still, deep in thought. Hesitantly, Rowena says, “I don’t mean to rush you, but I need to know if you will help me save my boy… I can’t do it alone.”
Charlie finds them again and she, Kevin, Gabriel, Meg, and Dean pile into Castiel's hotel room to keep him company while he tries to finish the last dress. Meg helps sew with him and Gabriel, Kevin, Charlie, and Dean talk about anything and everything entertaining that comes to mind to keep up the morale.
As the waitress walks away, we see Michael sitting across from Adam with a smile of his own. Adam grabs the fork and starts eating.
That was like 3 hours ago. I just apologised and he’s awake at 5:30 in the morning??? He said he didn’t like how we left things so he couldn’t sleep.
Dean doesn't bother looking to see who it is until he says, "We don't need to make a big deal of what happened."
Angeles grits his teeth, annoyed as he enters after Dean. "I'm not asking you to test it. I'm telling you to be careful. Confidence is going to kill us all."
Roman’s eyes narrow. “Make no mistake, Winchester, you’re only here because I have questions.” He leans across the table and folds his arms, his expression twisting into one with a grievance. “You either answer my questions or you get the hell out of my office right now.”
Gabriel knew why Michael and especially Adam were so against the plan from the beginning — Michael had barely survived his time here between spending almost half the time in solitary confinement and cocaine or heroin. He’d seen it himself, it’s why he instantly agreed to come along when he heard that Michael would be going. If Adam wasn’t going to be there, then Gabriel would volunteer to look out for him.
"Me too," Dean agrees happily, proud that Cas liked his work. "You think maybe one day I could get promoted to be a designer for NOVAK?"
Michael nods and shuts the door behind him, turning the lock on it so nobody can interrupt them. Now alone, Michael asks, “What are you doing here?”
i don’t care if this motherfucker is on the swim team and i don’t care if he’s the captain, if he puts another rescued snail in my locker because it was lonely, I’m gonna dump shit into his pool
Cas has never run faster in his life, not even to get away after a heist. He finds himself at the office soon enough and Crowley and Jo step aside so Cas can take his place by Dean on their gurney. Dean had dried blood on his hands but by the reddened cloth in Jo's hands, she'd likely been cleaning him up before Cas arrived. Cas takes the cloth from her when she offers it and gently wipes the blood off his fingers.
"Better, thank you," Castiel grasps for breath. "I'm going to let Dean know we have her. Can you manage?"
Sam blinks once, then twice, then the corners of his lips turn up into a bright grin. "You shitting me?"
"Yeah right," Dean says sarcastically, still smiling like a fool. "Come on, admit it. Dean Winchester is a genius."
By Gabriel’s request, Dean headed down to see Cas after having his dinner — granted, Dean was so excited to finally have a pocket of time to see Cas that he'd practically shoved the half-cooked dinner down his mouth so he could leave as soon as possible. Cas didn't have to know that.
I was at Cas’s place for a date and then Sam texted to say John saw him kissing a boy at the Roadhouse and he was scared to go home. Chuck let Cas invite him over and said we could spend the night but Cas and I can’t share a bed.
At 9:30, Dean texts Cas again, feeling the need to justify himself. Dean had the thought that talking about it may not be something either of them wants to do, at least not this soon, but he knew they were professional enough and Dean owed Cas an explanation for his absence. He hasn't been a good personal assistant for the first half of the week.
"My stitches are coming out," Castiel answers quietly, tipping the edge of an office door open with his boot and checking -- empty. They seal the room with zip-ties. "I'll be fine."
“Doesn’t matter if he didn’t ask me. He already hurt me when he decided you were expendable enough to bring on the mission,” Adam refutes. Michael doesn’t argue that point — he’d been aware that the last time Adam and Dean met, Adam had told him not to involve him or Michael in anything anymore because they’d agreed that they wanted to live a peaceful life in Detroit. Dean had complied until Crowley got on death row.
Dean runs a hand over his face, wiping the wetness off on his jeans. “But that’s just it, Sam. I don’t want to break up with him but I don’t want this to be some secret anymore. I can’t even hold my boyfriend’s hand when we’re not at his place or mine! I know this is hard for him, I told him he has all the time he needs, but fuck John, I am not hiding for him.”
In Dean and Gabriel’s cell, the two are slipping out as Lilith makes her way down the hallways, a mission clear in her stride. The two men end up going down the same hallways as Lilith does, if only a little behind. Anael’s gaze follows Lilith as she enters the medical bay quietly.
Kansas opens the door and walks right out, seeing Naomi arriving just in time to see him. Every rifle in the vicinity is pointed right at him.
, more like) if he’s as unstable as Missouri makes him out to be. He wonders if he has a bad habit — smoking, drinking, drugs, what?
"No. You're lying. Michael isn't..." Adam trails off and Mick realises he's on the edge of hyperventilating. "No, he can't --"
John raises his hands slightly like he’s defending himself from an onslaught. “No, Dean, this is wanting what's best for you! If you want any kind of success, it's better to just keep this under wraps —“
I took Cas with me and Sam to watch us set off fireworks. The earplugs were a good idea so I’ll save it for the next time we do this.
Now, Adam sits at the small desk, wrists bruised purple and dull red from the handcuffs. He looks tired, dark rings under his eyes after going through a whole day without a second of sleep. He's black and blue from the hits and there's a trail of dried blood on his chin. Mick knows Ketch and Naomi are going too far.
"I think that's why we worked so well," Dean ponders with a smile, bumping Cas's shoulder with his own.
“You know, if you want to meet her that badly, I could arrange lunch or dinner with her and you could invite your brother,” Castiel offers. He pulls out a folder from one of his drawers and Dean sits in the chair on the opposite end of the desk. "It wouldn't be much trouble, but I don't guarantee her free time."
When it's time, Dean orders for the doors to be opened, seeing the motorcycles beginning to approach the bank. Salem opens them and Angeles, Crowley, London and himself start shooting to give them cover. The SWAT officers try to stop them but they're too fast, passing them too quickly, and before long, two motorcycles have crossed into the bank. Sam disappears into the tent, presumably to give orders, and before he comes back out, one of the SWAT officers shoots their lucky shot.
Adam looks impressed — Michael has never been very good at things like this, evidently, but it's obvious to Dean that he tried his best for Adam.
She presses her lips together, thinking, then she says, “You should talk to Dean, maybe you two can get an idea running. You know which cell he’s in. Oh, and his name in here is his Italian one, Dino De Luca. He’s staying under the radar.”
Cas has been acting a little bit off since meeting that jackass at the Paris church and Dean’s sure the interaction might be stirring up some old feelings so he’d tried his best to make Cas feel better when they were back in LA — during lunch, he’d asked Charlie to talk about her girlfriend so Cas could see that being gay isn’t a bad thing at all and that he wasn’t alone, and then he’d bought Cas a pair of Doc Martens from its Pride collection, black leather lace-up boots with a small rainbow flag near the heel. He told him he didn’t have to wear it if he didn’t want to, he just thought they were nice shoes.
Castiel scoffs. "Who isn't? If you're working for someone, you're hoping to use their name to get you a better job somewhere else. He's been allowed to use me since I hired him. Unless you have anything incriminating to tell me about Dean, we'll be leaving."
Eventually, Charlie and Kevin have to get back to work and Dean listens to some Led Zeppelin to get his mind off of the meeting happening next to him. What he'd give to be a fly in that room.
Gabriel rolls his eyes, but it’s obvious there’s no real malice beneath the expression, before he leans forward, slapping on an ironically enchanted look as he gazes at Dean through half-lidded eyes. “I bet you say that to all the boys, Dean.”
After over an hour has passed and they haven't gotten close to finding her, Jess grabs the blueprints of the Factory and starts looking for anywhere they haven't been. When that doesn't work, she starts looking for anywhere a secret room could be installed.
Dean goes through his notebook for a few moments before he says, reading off of the page, "Roman Polanski wants a suit for a private event but I'm sure you don't want that."
“No,” Adam replies. “Didn’t know how he would take it and he spends more time at his job than with us, so I never found the right time to tell him.” He looks down at his feet, shifty, and then glances back up at Dean, “Dad said he talked to you guys, that’s why I thought I should find you.”
Kevin laughs, shaking his head, “That’s the life of a fashion titan’s personal assistant. Well, if you need any help, my office is down four levels from here.”
Maybe it's a joke in poor taste or tensions were high after Kansas's kind-of-power show, but then one of the hostages turns to them, raising their gun. Albeit fake, perhaps the hostage had forgotten it had no bullets, but he aimed it at them. "He could have killed me?"
“Oh, yeah!” Sam recognizes, causing Dean to throw up his hands in mock exasperation. Sam only remembers movies and TV shows by specific actors and characters which annoyed Dean slightly, but it’s also one of Sam’s quirks. “I love Emily Blunt.”
"Dean," Cas says, so gentle like his name was the most precious thing in the world. "I don't know what I could say or do to convince you, and I don't know any words that could do justice to what I feel... I gave up everything I had for you. I challenged Heaven -- I have died for you."
Gabriel comes through the door and says, “Winchester, hands off of my baby bro. Not even first base.”
Mick says, slipping his arm under Dean's so he can redirect him to the partition, "I'll take him to interrogation from here." The officer gives Dean up without argument and Mick leads him to the table, sitting him down across from Adam. Alone, Mick says, "You two can speak, but quietly and unnoticeable. I don't know how long you have until Ketch or Naomi return from outside."
Anael says, and at this point, it’s just rubbing salt on the wound, “And Crowley’s gonna be in the SHU until our third day here.”
Castiel wears the shoes Dean bought for him, the ones with the rainbow flag near the heel, and the bird cufflinks he gave him for Christmas. They're practically unnoticeable but Dean will know he wore them and that's all he really cares about.
Craning her neck, she could see into the tent a little bit. It's crowded with people, screens, desks but the one thing that catches her eye -- a second's glimpse between partitions of blue eyes and blonde hair that she knows as Sam's half-brother. Adam looked terrible like he was close to breaking down at any moment. She wished she could talk to him but she can't go into the tent.
He did call but Dean had felt too awful to pick up so Sam did; Cas gave him excessive advice on caring for a hungover Dean, and Dean regretted not picking up. Hearing Cas’s voice would have cured his hangover right away.
He hears Jess's voice by his ear from the radio hooked to his shoulder, broadcasted to all the other Dalís, saying desperately, "
Castiel compliments as he looks Dean up and down, though there lies a joking tone in his voice, “Well, you do look good in Westwood.”
"Dean," Michael tries. He'd never been very good at the emotional side of, well, anything. When he realised he liked Adam as more than a friend, he didn't even know he liked Adam until he had a crisis. And then with asking Adam to be his boyfriend, he barely knew how to go about that and Adam had to finish his question for him. When it came to emotional things, Michael had no clue; Adam has always been his guide. But he felt like he should say something. "Adam didn't know how John would react. He never told him partially because of that uncertainty, but it was because he thought he didn't owe John anything. Sure, John tried to raise him, but he didn't owe him anything. Neither do you."
Dean could recognize that dress in his sleep with all the nights he's worked overtime to help Cas with the collection. Cas decided to go for a darker colour palette than he normally worked with and most of the pieces in the collection were going to be black with bits of bright colours. The first dress to walk out is black with pirate sleeves and the fabric tied into a big bow at the neckline. The bottom of the dress travelling up one side and over the sleeves and chest are pink, white, and red flowers. It's one of Dean's favourite pieces from the collection, one of the ones Cas spent the most time perfecting late into the night, one of the pieces he insisted on doing himself.
He pretends to read her name tag and says, “You see, Dorothy, I want to buy a ring for my boyfriend but I’ve got no idea what kind of ring would suit him. I was thinking about something gold with a little silver. Or maybe something completely black? I don’t know.”
Dean looks down at his beer bottle, opened but not touched yet, thinking about all the possibilities now that he knows Michael is firmly on their side.
"Angeles and Dallas, with me," Dean commands. "The rest of you, get them to the main hall." As they start to move the now-hostages, Dean activates his earpiece and says, "Hello? Vegas, London?"
"We've been over this. The same trick won't work twice. Plus, Orlando and Florence won't be able to help us this time so moot point. Not enough people to pull off a hijack like before," Dean says from the front of the room.
Cas guides her to the couch to sit and he settles next to her. “Alright, calm down. Everything’s going to be fine.”
Dean catches Crowley in the bathroom early, before anyone else is there. It’s not hard to realise that Crowley would be there — he hated crowds and typically woke up earlier than most people. At least, he was always one of the first to get up when they studied for heists. Plus, with how dirty the bathrooms get and how long the line will go when the clock hits 8, Crowley would be a fool to not beat the queue.
"And you snatched £26.5 million," Gabriel says, remembering when Michael told him about the heist back when they shared a prison cell. "Simpler times, buddy." Michael only hums in agreement until the phone rings and Cas jumps up, pressing the green button to pick up.
Castiel was finally out and free and as it appears, it wasn’t as scary as he remembered it to be. After practising with friends and family, the words had finally grown comfortable in his mouth and in his heart.
Meg looks over the book spines, some filled with gold paper and some still awaiting their sheets, and thinks about the 17,000 diamonds upstairs, and she smiles. Quietly, she says, "I hope you like it, Bela. It was all for you."
far a cry to think that?" He grins at the way Castiel recovers from that, finally settling on a shirt to wear and gesturing to him to turn away. He does and says with his back facing Castiel, "Anyway, yes, he's coming. I just wanted to see if you would ask about him and you sure did not disappoint."
They enter the elevator and Dean presses for the ground floor. As the doors slide shut, Castiel says, “I think Gabriel emailed the writers a very vulgar letter, but I don’t know. I do know that he was adamant that true love wasn’t real.”
Crowley gives a disclaimer, "In view of possible minor audiences of this interview, and respect for our fallen friends, we won't be opening them."
It was the last piece of advice Bobby had given to Dean, one of many tidbits of wisdom he’d imparted onto Dean before he passed away, finding his demise in a heist gone wrong. Ellen has spent so much time with Sam and Jo, providing comfort however she could. Raising three kids on her own is no easy feat, especially when all of them had a trauma of some kind.
"Have fun," Michael nods, giving Cas a side-hug before putting out the cigarette under his shoe, walking back to the car.
Castiel draws in a deep breath, lets it stay in his lungs until it crawls out of his mouth, and tries again, “My name is Castiel James Novak. I was born in September 1985. I have an elder brother of four years named Gabriel and my parents have been dead since before I could remember.”
Dean and Cas take over guard duty and Dean sends Sam and Charlie to begin moving the printed rolls of money to the tunnel in preparation for their escape. The tunnel is pretty far along by now but it would be completed in significantly fewer hours if Adam was digging from the other side. Dean couldn't fix the phone, the cords too damaged by Abaddon to be repairable (at least, with the tools they had on hand) and Dean is unbelievably thankful that he had prepared for this situation with Adam beforehand.
"They track slime all over my locker but at least they're cute," Dean says. "Just... let's bring them straight to the garden next time, alright? I think three snails is enough."
Dean stands and puts on the coat as if accepting a challenge.  He sits down to eat his pancakes, now wearing the coat.
“Oh, stop it,” Castiel rolls his eyes, walking faster ahead of Dean. Dean laughs and runs to catch up with him. “If you’re going to make a big deal out of it, you’re more than welcome to fuck off.”
When Sam and Eileen split off to the spare room in the apartment that Dean furnished with his first NOVAK paycheck and Dean retired to his own room, he can't stop thinking about Castiel and the way he moves in his tan trench coats.
A sharp laugh bursts from her and she lunges out, reaching for the radio clipped to Michael’s shoulder. Pulling at it, she grabs Michael’s arm and uses the momentum to turn him so she can wrap the wire around his neck. She tugs on the radio and the other end of the wire and Michael chokes, pulling at it to give himself leeway to breathe.
not the rule in the Impala, but he's ridiculously happy tonight. It all felt right. He looks up at the sky and closes his eyes in silent prayer. There are no words that run through his mind, no actual plea to God, but it's a fleeting moment of hope.
Castiel stares at him, a glint of charm in his blue eyes as a slow smile starts on his face. “You’re not cute, Dean.”
“Hey, babe,” Michael smiles softly, leaning over to press a quick kiss to Adam’s lips. “Yeah, it’s not that important.”
“You and I are gonna go on a fake heist. We’ll get caught, thrown in jail,” Dean explains. “The warden of Potosi, thank my lucky fucking stars, he owes me a bunch of favours. Back when I was collecting debts for the first heist, I was helping him do a whole bunch of things because I wanted to use my favours to get artillery from him. I found a better guy so I never spent the favours. Well, now I can. One of the favours will be him hiring Michael and Anael as COs. Second favour will be you and I in the same cell.”
“Nah, you have the right to your own secrets, brother or not,” Dean says, waving a hand dismissively as he takes the seat next to Michael. “How’d you know him?”
"Yeah, if she knows about it!" Sam spluttered, though he follows Dean through and starts looking for white sage. They wanted to get Michael out of hell and then bind him so they can try to get him out of Adam and back to Heaven. Their version of doing Adam justice, by trying to get that Archangel out of his body so he can at least attempt to move on and have a normal life.
"That means a negotiator is going to come. Hopefully Interior comes," Dean says, standing once he's sure Salem will be fine. He walks over to the governor's desk and picks up the phone, connecting him to Adam. "Windom, they're setting up camp."
“People do tell me I take after my mom,” Adam jokes. It warrants a small laugh from Dean. “Seriously. I don’t care if we just met last week. You know, you’re my brother now. Family means something.”
"I think any of these are fine. But for a show, I think McCartney, Theallet or Max Mara would be the better options," Dean suggests, pointing out each outfit as he lists the designers. "I think the Dior would be good too, with or without the coat."
Michael taught me how to read people. People like to call it our Sherlock party trick. I’m not always accurate but I’m getting there.
"For thinking for even a second that you were evil... Because as I've come to realise, you just want to start over again. And I thought that's what I was helping people do in this job, but I've been living a lie," Sam says. "I mean, everything we've been doing over original notes?"
Dean explains, in a desperate attempt to get him to understand his reasoning and never be a bad guy in his little brother's eyes, "Sammy, this plan... I'm fucked. Alright? It's been going wrong since yesterday. I'm not 'using my intelligence' to fuck around with America. I'm doing this because we need it, and we haven't run away yet because we
The remainder of the trip -- just a few minutes -- is mostly quiet, with Sam whispering excitedly with Cas, Michael driving silently and Dean just staring at Cas, smiling. Once they reach school, Michael gives Cas a firm pat on his shoulder before letting him go. Sam runs up to catch up with him -- Dean still doesn’t know if it’s cute that Sam’s taller than Cas despite being a year younger, or if it’s unfair that Sam’s taller than Dean despite being a year younger. When Dean gets his bag strap over his shoulder, Michael turns back in the driver’s seat and says to him, “If you hurt Castiel and break his heart, I will put the fear of God in you.”
As she raises it to a window, Naomi quickly walks in, slamming the office door behind her. "Jesus, what the hell is wrong with you? Put that down right now."
"How did you do it?" Cas asks, pulling away to give Dean a once-over, assessing any damage. "You had a life sentence. Did you make a deal with that FBI agent—"
When it's almost 10 PM, Dick Roman and Chuck Shurley walk out with their lawyers, followed by Sam who gestures to Dean to come in. Dean goes in, almost exploding with anticipation, "So, how did it go?"
Inias bites his lip before continuing, "She intends to steal ownership of NOVAK and she's conspiring with an art director from Vogue and the creative director from Marie Claire, Naomi Intel. I believe the Vogue director is called Hannah."
"We're not here to hurt the financial situations of the citizens... That would defeat the purpose of what we wanted to do for ourselves," Crowley explains. "So we left their money alone and borrowed the bank's machines to print our own. This way, nobody is affected. All we're doing here is printing paper." Crowley still doesn't say a word on if they touched the gold reserves as Dean wanted to keep it that way.
Meg still absolutely refuses to even be in the same room as him. She has nothing against Cas at all which Dean thinks is pretty ridiculous since he’s the one who pulled the plug on her. Dean chalks it up to how they’ve been friends for years and she knows Cas was trying to get his event in order. Dean just happened to be in the line of fire. Balthazar assures him that she’ll get over it at some point in her life. He doesn’t give him an estimation. Charlie does apologize for encouraging him to take the runway from Meg though. Kevin says that’s just how life is in the fashion industry; You’re inevitably gonna have to walk over your friends to get to a higher stage — the only thing you can control is whether you’re going to do it in Manolo Blahniks or Jimmy Choos.
“I gather you missed me,” Cas says, teasing, once Gabriel leaves them to say hi to his other friends.
Michael sits across from him and asks again, "Dean, what happened? What are you doing in Lenox Hill?"
"I know, and I have a way to take care of that. We can get the gold out without even opening the vault door," Dean says. That grabs the thief's attention and he continues to convince him, "You'll get out with a few thousand kilograms of gold and hundreds of thousands in bills if you join me. I promise you won't get caught. Are you in?"
More importantly, it's also the day that Dean trashed the note with John's phone number on it. At 8 years and 1 day old, Dean promised not to hang the rest of his life on John, or any person who wouldn't give him the time of day.
Adam’s speech abruptly cuts off and Michael is suddenly the one sitting in front of the cake. His hand slams down on the table in shock at the suddenness and he steadies himself, trying to get his bearings.
“Interesting. Wings caved and finally got a P.A.,” Crowley says, amused. Dean wonders why he calls Castiel ‘Wings’. “Did he say this was a test?”
Castiel nods and once Bela turns away to talk to Pamela and Missouri, he downs his glass of champagne hoping to turn the liquid to courage.
“With all the work you’ve done for me, it’s the least I can do,” Castiel interrupts. “Italian and French designs will be exquisite so getting the clothes right from there will be the best choice. Come on.”
Cas huffs a quiet laugh and runs a finger over the curve of Chevy's shell. "Do you think I can see your car sometime?"
It was so simple, actually. Dad doesn’t know, and I’m sitting at my desk, and Dean’s still in my bed, and this is it. It was so easy.
Castiel glances up at him and look him over; Dean tried to dress more professionally today, in an unconscious attempt to look more presentable on what is undoubtedly one of Castiel’s most stressful days at the office. He’s in an Anthony Squires navy black archer sport coat that Missouri snuck him from the company’s storage, with a regular black turtleneck underneath that he got from some retail shop he doesn’t remember the name of and dark blue Levi’s jeans. Not that the outfit is extraordinarily professional, but at least it’s a step up from regular Instagram fashionista.
Dean catches Gadreel looking Sam's way in between photos and he knows Castiel is watching him too, but he's sure Gadreel is just getting a dose of eye candy. It doesn't mean that it doesn't annoy Dean.
Angeles sits in that for moments and says, maybe in a gesture of sympathy, "I have a brother too. Older."
"Hey, back off, okay?" Dean laughs, mouthing 'thank you' to a woman who holds the NOVAK door open for him to walk through. "The pay's getting good and my life is expensive. I need this job
to me? Just let me talk. For once in your life, you don't get to control the conversation," Sam disrupts rudely, making John shut up. It just seems like whenever Sam gets angry, people listen. Maybe it's because of how rare it was that he got angry. He has impressive temper control but it probably comes with being a lawyer. "I can tolerate a lot of things, okay? I am willing to take a lot of shit, but what I won’t stand for is you thinking you have a say in who Dean dates. If you approved of Eileen without even meeting her, then I don’t see why Cas should be any different."
Alone, Lilith starts, “Alastair doesn’t want to work with me anymore and I have too much supply to just stop, so you’re going to sell it for me.” Instantly, Dean says no, and she doesn’t take it well. “I know you and Michael have something going on, and I know his husband’s upstairs fixing him. You help me get rid of my stash or I go up there and kill them both. They will never see me coming.”
They don’t talk for the rest of the ride, but Dean feels the awkwardness when the chauffeur shoots him a look in the tiny mirror. Dean doesn’t have an answer to any of the questions in his eyes. Cas’s gaze stays out of the window.
“I’m not buying it!” Michael cuts over impatiently. “He’s trying to make me smuggle his supply into the prison instead of Lilith.”
“If she knows I’m here, she’ll stop at nothing to kill me,” Michael explains, letting the mattress fall back onto the metal bed frame. Anael, Gabriel and Dean all regard him with wide eyes, and Michael continues, “Why do you think I never told Adam I have a sister? She’s fucking crazy. She thinks it’s some God-given mission to kill me. That’s why I ran off and dropped my last name.”
“Hey, you did the right thing. He shouldn’t have been talking to them like that,” Sam assures. “But if you feel this bad about it, then you could try to undo the damage, do something good. What could you do?”
Dinner goes better than Dean anticipated; mostly because things tend to go bad where Dean's involved. I.E., dinner on Friday. But Cas talks more, no longer having any inhibitions now that they're officially on a date. He answers Dean's questions with an ease that wasn't there before, and he fires back at his flirtations with his own. It's a new side to Cas, a side Dean just knows the world would love, and he can't imagine why he'd ever want to hide this. Cas is so great.
But all you have to know is that he was so happy today. If we didn’t have to go home, I would never have, just so he could always be this happy.
“Oh, nothing major. I wanted to show him some new merchandising,” Missouri says. “It can wait, I assume he’s busy with celebrity pieces right now. How is he holding up?”
Friday dinner with John is quickly forgotten and replaced with memories of the time Dean attempted to ask him on a date but landed on dinner instead. The fact that this time, it is really a date and both of them thought it.
“I love you.” Cas smiles, leaning forward to press a quick kiss to Dean’s lips before he rounds the corner of the desk. “The good news is that we have tonight to ourselves at Bus Toque.”
Castiel clicks his tongue, leaning back against Bela. "She does not like me. Idolise, perhaps. But no more than that."
"Those are really beautiful designs but go and sleep," Cas finally says. When Dean continues, he sighs and adds, "Can I at least see your designs if you're going to join me?" He relents and passes the book over and Cas flips through all the drafts. He has many creative variations of a wedding dress for Eileen and some suit designs for Sam.
Cas picks up a colour pencil and shades in an ombré dress in light pinks and oranges. "I'll be in bed by 1."
“Meg!” Anael calls out, walking over to her. She’s still in her CO uniform, though she has a fashionable maroon coat over it, her red hair flowing behind her. “It’s good to see you.”
Gabriel frowns in a way that's meant to be sympathetic, and says, "It's not about that, Dean-o. My brother isn't into guys, he told me himself. Just trying to save you some time and some heartbreak." Dean is slapped with the reminder that Castiel still hasn't told Gabriel that he's gay and he mentally slaps himself again for being so cavalier about it. Before Dean can come up with something else to say, Gabriel turns to Meg and continues, "Didn't that model say he thought Dean was hot?"
Dean’s hands itch to reach out to Cas, pull him close and kiss him, but with the cameras watching, it’s simply not possible without losing their cover to Naomi. He stays where he is, one row behind Cas, and settles for resting a hand on his shoulder. “What would I do without you?”
Impulsively, she presses a quick kiss to Bela's lips before pulling away, startled by her own actions. Bela stares at her before she cradles Meg's face to kiss her again. Meg's heart goes a thousand miles a second, having Bela so close to her. Though they would be leaving for the heist any day now, it was still exhilarating to feel like they had time.
!” Cas says, appalled, before he laughs it off. “You’re so cheesy. ‘Too good to be true, I have to exorcise you’. Don’t you think holy water would be counterproductive in exorcising angels?”
"What if they don't send their superior and we just get an inspector?" Angeles follows up, closing up his own police jacket as Dallas and Berlin herd truck drivers, now in the same red coveralls as them, into the back of the truck with the weaponry.
Sorry I couldn't make it today and most of the week. I'm not trying to avoid you, I guess I just didn't know what to say. You've gone from being my boss to my boyfriend and then not, I guess at some point the employer status was just forgotten. But I will be back on Friday like I told you.
Meg leans in closer to Dean, pressing the barrel closer as she says, "Rome is dead, Angeles got shot and Abaddon is stalking us around the bank. Angeles needs a hospital, he's in no condition to play hide and seek with Abaddon."
"Never compare spaghetti to musicals again," Cas sighs. Once they're seated, Dean starts eating happily, talking about how Cas did such a great job with the spaghetti and that with practice, he'll be as good a chef as he is. It sends a fluttering feeling into Cas's chest and he can't help but eventually agree that he did well.
"A lot has happened," Castiel says, taking a seat on the couch in Kelly's office. Quiet babbling from behind Kelly's desk makes Castiel frown in confusion.
Dean had called John after Cas said yes to a date, and he is a little sheepish to admit that he anticipated a "Leave a message at the tone" or a "The number you are calling has been disconnected". John actually answers this time, and they agree to lunch at Dean's place — Sam's idea; in the event that one of them ends up just losing it, at least they won't make a scene.
Since Meg and he remembered that she threatened to kill Angeles once she was free, Dean can't stand Angeles being alone for even one second, especially with how he's recovering from a bullet to the shoulder. Nobody argued to take over when Dean said he would guard Angeles -- maybe they knew why he cared so much, but it's hardly important now, and Dean had bigger things to worry about than them knowing that Angeles may mean more to him than he thought.
“And make sure we have Pier 59 at 8 AM tomorrow. “Remind Charlie I need to see a few of those satchels that Marc Jacobs is planning to do for Fashion Week,” Castiel says. “I’m supposed to make jackets that match. And then tell Bela I’ll take Crowley if she isn’t available.”
Dean nods, trying to organise his thoughts. “Okay. Gabriel and I will join Crowley in kitchen duty, I’ll start setting up a hijack with Dorothy and Meg. John’s gone, so that’s one less thing to think about. Try to keep Alastair away from Michael, Lilith is a big enough problem for him. I’ll let Cas know about all this, someone tell Michael and Adam.”
“Man, I don’t know. Novak said to stick close to him when we’re there since I’m new. But he said we’ll check in with his personal clients so I might get to meet some celebrities. I’ll let you know if I do,” Dean says excitedly. “I can’t wait for this LA trip. I’ve never been to LA.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel smiles wearily, sitting down in his chair. “I spent the past three weeks trying to come up with something that remotely fits the theme. I’m glad to see that these will work.”
"Dean? Are you okay?" Adam asks, worried. "Did something happen to Sam?" At the silence, he tries again. "Castiel?" That gets Dean's jaw working with a million silent thoughts and Michael knows Adam's guessed right. "Talk to me, come on."
, Dean thinks, shaking his head as he scribbles over a design for Eileen's dress and flips to a new empty page to start another draft. Cas goes through Dean's closet to help him pick clothes out for France. Cas has a small apartment in France that he stays at when he's in France for longer than a week (and he rents it out when he's not using it), so he assures Dean that he won't need to bring that many sets of clothing. A month's worth of clothes will be a nightmare to pack.
Contrary to popular belief, Sam doesn't learn a lot about pulling off a perfect crime from catching good criminals. He knows where they go wrong, he knows what they could do to fix their mistakes, but actually doing the crime is a different conversation. Hypothetically, he could go over Dean's plan for the Bank of America and come up with a list of things he should have done differently or do away with, or do in addition. But doing it is another matter, it's complex.
"Put this on," Jody instructs, holding out a small microphone to him. Sam sticks it to the back of a pair of false glasses, hoping that it's good enough.
He can practically hear Sam thinking, hesitating, debating, second-guessing again and again. Zachariah's voice is faint in the background when he says, "We're not giving them a surgeon. Tell him that his precious Los Angeles can bleed out. That's how criminals pay their debts."
Ketch nods in agreement and walks out of the tent with Naomi to inform the CO19 that there's been a change in plan. Mick rushes to find the phone booth, only to get stopped by Ketch. Ketch frowns, asking, "Where are you going?"
"Unless I die," Dean says. "Then Cas will take the lead. You'll be in good hands! Cas has had countless successful jewel heists. He knows this kind of heist inside and out. I've got no doubt that this will be yet another one he can add to his record." Satisfied with the answer, Meg nods and leaves the kitchen.
"Before. I'll get him out as soon as I can. He's my brother, I can't leave him in that tent," Dean assures. "I just need your help to keep Detroit busy until I come up with a plan. Let him make more diamonds, anything."
"Why, Crowley, I don't work in the Pentagon, do I? How should I know? We'll have to wait and see," Bela says, walking over to see the sketches as well. She picks up one of them and says, "I love this one. Please tell me you're going to approve it. Who designed this? Doesn't look like Bal or Meg's style."
He goes down the hall to his own room and knocks before opening the door, seeing his own body staring back at him. Okay, what the hell? “Sam?”
“Well, a favour’s a favour. Two left,” Roman says, resigned. “I have one more question; You’re trying to bust Crowley out of death row, aren’t you?”
Cas and I went on a date today, I just came back from it an hour ago. Well, I count it as a date. Don’t know about him. Cas dragged me into the library and we went to the fiction section and he started to read badly written erotica in the weirdest accents ever (kinda sexy). I couldn’t stop laughing and he kept shushing me but he’s too funny. The memory of him saying “the dog-ugliest creep looked like Jake Gyllenhaal” like an offended Russian...
"Why should we give it?" Zachariah frowns, walking closer to debate. "All they've done is inconvenience us. It's time they paid the price and learned that they can't get away with everything."
Angeles stares at him until the doors open and he walks straight to the office. Dean rolls his eyes and follows. The door opens and one of the hostages there, the one who asked for an inhaler, recoils from the coat rack. Angeles narrows his eyes at him and asks, "Zeddmore, can I talk to you outside?"
"I don't have a costume," Cas mumbles, and Dean takes a deerstalker out of his bag along with a plastic pipe. He puts the deerstalker on Cas's head and motions for him to open his mouth so he can put the pipe there.
Sam shoots Dean a knowing look and says, “No, it’s fine. Eileen and I wanted to have fast food tonight. Dean, we’ll see you at home.” With that, Sam and Eileen say their goodbyes, leaving the office and leaving Dean and Castiel alone.
“I’m sorry,” Michael apologises sincerely, finally looking back up and running a thumb over the back of Adam’s hand. “Adam, please don’t be mad. I didn’t want you to do anything impulsive but I guess I should have known you’d come in after me. I just never wanted you to know what it’s like in a place like this.”
"Sam, hey!" Jessica replies. He can hear the TV, some reality show playing in the background. "I was about to get started on dinner."
They don't have a chance at securing their position in the Factory for a long time, Dean knows it. Cas knows it, Meg knows it, they all do. Which is why this time, Dean took out them acting like they had a failed exit. The same tricks wouldn't work twice.
“What’s worse than his sister and my dad being here?” Dean asks, brain working a thousand miles a second trying to think about how to ration his remaining three favours with Roman without wasting them all on Lilith and John.
You know, it’s funny. I used to be in such a hurry all the time. I wanted to get as much done in my life as fast as I could because I was afraid I would run out of time. But now that I’m here, I think I hurried for nothing; I got to feel everything I ever wanted to anyway. There was no rush after all.
“You delivering books?” Ketch asks, ignoring Ash’s question as he looks over the stacks of books around the five of them.
The SWAT team officer in charge, Victor Henriksen, asks, "Inspector, a sniper says he has a clear shot of the one with the rifle."
They both drank more champagne than they should, and the cab driver is a little hesitant to pick them up like this but decides that he’s probably not getting any other business at this late an hour. Possibly also because Cas offers to pay ten times his rate.
She locates John’s name and marks him down, saying, “Alright, you’re going back to C block, cell 262.” At least his cell isn’t that close to Dean and Gabriel’s. It should make it a little easier to keep them separate. She gestures to him to follow her and she walks him to his cell where his cellmate isn’t there. On the sheet, it’d said he was with someone called Virgil.
"What are you doing here?" Dean asks as Anael gets them out the other end of the audience and looking around to find a rendezvous point.
Dean groans dramatically, looking up at the sky for a moment before looking back at Castiel, “Sam signed the permission slip. Can I
Dean had forgotten what it’s like to be on the receiving end of Cas’s coldness and the reliving of it is unwelcome. He nods, saying quietly, “Sorry, Cas.” Cas exhales loudly through his nose, something sharp and agitated, and Dean adds, “You’re right, this is just all wrong to me.”
“I know, you have quite the reputation on Twitter,” Mick says, waving his phone slightly. “You’re pretty popular.”
Dean had John’s phone number on a folded note that he kept hidden in his pillowcase. He never told Bobby or Ellen about it. Every once in a while, when both Bobby and Ellen were out to do groceries or work, he’d use the landline and leave a voicemail for John, asking him when he’d come back. The first time, he’d actually gotten a reply back.
Sam clenches his jaw like he has something to say, but he shakes his head, “You’re tired, I’m tired. Whatever. Forget it.” Dean tries to apologize again but Sam changes the topic again, “What did he think about you and Pax?”
Dean hides the phone in the bedpost again just as Gabriel blinks himself awake, the morning alarm waking them up. “Morning, Gabe.”
Anael nods, seemingly in understanding until she says, “If you’re gonna keep John out until you leave, then you’ve gotta do the same for Michael and the Hand of God to keep the peace and I know you don’t have enough favours to spare for that, so Johnny’s staying.”
They're greeted with the sight of gold, glinting in thin white light above them, lined up beautifully on stainless steel shelves.
A part of Castiel wished that Gabriel was in the same prison he got sent to but of course, his luck simply isn’t good enough for his brother to be there. He knows Gabriel’s sentence ends in two years and he desperately hopes he’s doing well.
Benny gives him a grin over his shoulder, replying, "It's been good to know you, brother. The end of the line's always been here for me."
I love you and I hope you smile when you see this. You’re my favourite person in the whole world and I don’t know what I would do without you.
Cas walks out of the kitchen, gesturing to Gabriel to clear the table to make space for the pie. Gabriel obliges, shifting plates and cutlery around. Cas asks into the phone, rolling his eyes, “What are you talking about?”
Adam comes through the partition, holding out his phone, "Your girlfriend called me. I think you didn't answer your phone so she assumed..."
Dean had been forced by Castiel to wear the jacquard tuxedo set with maiolica print from Dolce & Gabbana along with the black Manolo Blahniks. Castiel dons a light mohair single-breasted Prada suit. The runway is soon set-up and other Fashion Week guests pile in — models, press, assistant buyers like Charlie, some A-list celebrities. Dean has to catch himself staring when Cara Delevingne walks past, laughing at a joke someone said to her.
?” He huffs a bitter laugh and Meg’s eyes follow his, wide and angry. He leans in a little bit and asks, “Was it the whole year?"
Dean wakes up suddenly, grabbing onto Cas's hand. "Wait. It's probably Sam. And you're looking like this in my apartment."
They end up with Dean being pressed up against the fridge and Cas hovering right in front. There is a small magnet that Dean can't identify pressing into his back when Cas kisses him. It's slow and it's sweet, and Dean drinks him in. Tries to breathe in as much of Cas as he can, feel the light stubble on his jaw, and the gentle pull of his hands. Dean's used to kissing hard and fast. He's used to kissing like there's something after.
Cas insists that Dean take a rest from the wedding outfits, just for one night, and Dean just can't say no to that face so he caves. Cas has a new season of
“Because you’re crazy! You’re trying to kill me!” Michael says, strained, releasing his grip on the wire and instead, reaching for Lilith. He grabs the back of her uniform and bends, pulling her over his shoulder and slamming her onto the ground.
Benny says encouragingly, wiping his hands clean with a cloth, “I’ll bet you can do it.” He glances back into the kitchen and does a waving motion, pointing at his watch and holding up five fingers, blinking his hand twice. “Come on, catch me up. What’ve you been up to?”
Lucifer SNAPS his fingers and a woman -- BETTY -- chained up, materialises. Sam and Dean are confused.
“This is so awesome,” Eileen says, looking around the studio. Light equipment and cameras were set up long before Castiel arrived — the main photographer, Gadreel, obviously learned his lesson from the time Castiel almost fired him for being unprepared.
The photoshoot is directed by Hannah Johnson, a photographer and art director from Vogue Magazine. Standing about Bela's height with warm blue eyes and brown hair cropped to her shoulders, Hannah seems like a pleasant person. As it turns out, she's a fan of Castiel's work, insisting on getting numerous more solo shots of him than Bela that Castiel had to ask her multiple times to photograph Bela as well. Pamela and Bela's PR stand together at the side, discussing quietly.
"You know idiots like that are everywhere. Fighting won't help anything especially if you get us banned from every restaurant in Palermo," Cas says, hanging onto Dean's arm so they can walk closely. "If you get arrested, we'll have to run again and I've already gotten used to life here."
"I'll apologise later, okay? I swear," Dean says. "Listen, I need to go update Adam and Jess, they've gotta be worried."
She pulls the shiv out and then shoves it back in, making Michael grit his teeth as he tries not to look too vulnerable. Irritated with the suppressed reaction, Lilith has always been sadistic, so she twists.
I have this condition called rheumatic heart disease, it started from the fever. It’ll destroy my heart at some point.
He scrambles all over his desk, trying to find the notebooks. Once he retrieves it, he grabs a pen and starts scribbling down memos. When it’s all noted down, he picks up the phone and goes through the company’s database, finding the number for Margot Robbie’s agent.
Anael grabs Dean’s arm and drags him to a corner of the cell to talk in private. Once they’re alone, Michael and Gabriel at the other side of it, she says in a hushed voice, “We’re not trying to break everyone out.
Thankfully, it doesn't take very long to find Naomi who has just walked out of her office. Meg calls out, "Will Miranda Priestley stop walking?"
Dean nods and then Cas retreats into his office, where Dean is sure that he wishes he had the building renovated after he acquired it to have the glass walls switched to opaque ones. The next half an hour where Cas is busy figuring out some paperwork in his office and Dean is organising events and answering calls, it consists also of them looking over the top of the papers and laptops to look at each other, glancing away when they get caught.
Sam catches his eye and says, "Obviously, Rowena isn't happy that we broke in. Okay, look, don't panic. Maybe Cas knows how to put us back into our bodies --"
Dean's heart skips a beat then and everything seemed to go in slow motion, the way the bullet cuts through the air. Thankfully, it merely hits the vase next to Angeles because she hadn't had the chance to aim accurately, but the glass rains down on Angeles when it shatters. Angeles yells in pain when glass cuts him where the coveralls and mask aren't covering him, and Dean takes the butt of his rifle and slams it to the side of Abaddon's head with as much force as he can use.
The rain looks like thousands of tiny Swarovski crystals, illuminated by roadside lamps and passing cars in the deep night. Castiel instantly moves to shield himself from the raindrops until Dean raises an arm to pull down his, and Castiel lets the rain kiss his skin. There's tinny music playing from a car parked across the street, something rock that Dean's sure Castiel doesn't recognize, but he does.
Michael straightens up at Gabriel’s concerned stare, unwilling to look any weaker than he already does. “
Gabriel leans across the table, lifting his fork as he talks. “What if Crowley’s in a different block from us?”
"Loved it. She sent me a photo and everything." Dean grins. "Look Cas, if you don't put on a shirt soon, I'm gonna show you how much I love you."
Cas smiles, troubles draining away at how Dean's face lights up when he's planning dinner, and he says, "I can't wait."
Eileen comes into play, where once Cas voiced his concern for the inability to pick the locks, Dean called her. They'd met Eileen Leahy in Palermo after she helped Dean in a fight, both with the actual fight and getting away afterwards. They kept in contact with her and found out that she's like Benny, an expert in industrial systems, plus an excellent key forger.
So, when Cas kissed him in the cab and for the first time, Dean kissed back with his heart fully there and his mind fully Cas’s, it surprised him, because it felt like it was right. It didn’t feel the way he kissed Cassie Robinson from fashion school like he was holding her back. Or the way it felt when he kissed Benny Lafitte from Chemistry like he wasn’t enough for him. Or when he kissed Lee Webb from South Dakota, like he was cheating him out of something better. No, when he kissed Cas, it felt like
"Sorry, ma'am," Dean mutters, looking up at Adam. "I didn't know my brother was here. We haven't seen each other in a while."
Sam stands up abruptly, inhaling sharply and burying his face in his hands through shuddering breaths. Adam exhales heavily, saying, "I can call him."
Dean chooses not to say anything. He's already playing the 'I don't know Sam's my brother' card and he isn't sure if pretending he doesn't know Adam either would be more or less help for them. Naomi scoffs in annoyance but mutters, "The medics just
Crowley nods, though his lack of certainty is unsettling. “And you are sure he will no longer harass you?” Dean hums to affirm it. “Do you have a plan?”
Alright, it’s the 7th right now but I don’t think I need to make a new entry for this so I’ll just add on.
"No, but when have I ever been able to?" Angeles replies, taking the cigarette that Dean offers him. Dean can't remember at what point in the three months of knowing one another that they got into the habit of sharing their smokes, but it stuck and neither of them was itching to be rid of the routine. "What's on your mind?"
Instead, Charlie insists on taking Dean out to a non-private showroom for Canali. It's a little odd because Canali is a menswear brand, but Charlie says that she hasn't been to a showroom in a while and wanted to take some friends out to visit one. Friends meaning Dean, and Missouri, mostly because everyone else who would be interested is busy with fall collections of their respective brands.
Cas looks a little hesitant but he wipes it off his face before Dean can notice and ask after it. He says, flashing Dean a smile, "We could. I'd love to get an apartment with you someday."
"I'm sure," Castiel nods. Dean yields and, without the man staring at them, kisses his forehead before he walks off, separating at the entrance of the church. Castiel turns to look back at the altar.
They check in on Balthazar's family every three months to make sure all is well. They're getting by fine with his cut of the money and gold, thankfully. The Dalís all agreed that they would meet once a year to ensure they are all safe and well. They'd gotten the first year out of the way and their second meet-up was in two months at Meg's mansion in Madrid, Spain.
Dean’s Twitter account has blown up, surpassing two million followers since his and Cas’s return to New York City. It’s a bit daunting but as it turns out, he just needs to post pictures of himself and his outfits and it’s enough for them. Apparently, they think he’s supermodel material. At most, they like hearing updates about Cas — of course, only the updates that are allowed like what coffee order he likes.
Dean subconsciously adjusts his posture so it's a little more Sam, a little less Dean. "What do you mean?"
There's a knock on the door a little after that and Cas packs up his things, waves goodbye to the Winchester-Novak snails, hugs Sam, and kisses Dean goodnight. It's Gabriel at the door instead of Michael and he takes the lollipop out of his mouth to greet Dean. "Hey, Dean-o. Have a good time, Cas?"
"I don't trust him," John says flatly. "I don't think Adam should hang around a guy like that Chuck Shurley. Or Michael."
Dean leans in, unconscious decision to be closer to Castiel, and teases, "Why? Scared that people will think your assistant looks way hotter?"
"You already know! Just accept it, Sam," Adam snaps, finally at his limits about his capture. "This is illegal, you keeping me here."
"Anything can happen," Salem says. A little timidly, Dean notices, but there isn't any time to switch her out for someone more suitable for their first "face-off" with the police as Adam lets them know that there's one minute left before the cops arrive.
"Correct," Cas affirms. "Once you remind them to be there, you may go for lunch, there isn't much else to do."
It seemed like things were finally looking up. Dean picked out a name for himself, Kansas, and Dean Winchester was long forgotten.
Dean opens his mouth, thinking he should say something, and Cas abruptly stands up, grabbing his Prada coat. "I'm leaving now."
They split the spaghetti evenly in the two bowls and then Dean pours the sauce and mincemeat. Once it's done, Dean gives Cas a lopsided smile. "Look at that, we made pasta. You don't completely suck in the kitchen."
I won't' sugarcoat it. Dad said you weren't responsible enough. I think he's still peeved about you talking him out of going with Castiel on his trip. I don't agree, but that's what he thinks.
Afterwards, he calls Dick Roman, who readily agrees and says Chuck will come along. When 7 rolls around, the Leviathan CEO and creative director of Heaven magazine walk in. For once, Dean agrees with John. Chuck's a son of a bitch.
Roman exhales loudly through his nose, clearly annoyed by the situation. “Well, I can’t have her running around stabbing her coworkers.”
He stepped in to handle the phones' connections in Jess and Adam's absences. He'll do what Jess did when she was around, bringing the phones on a walk around the city while the call happened so they can't pinpoint the phone's location. He won't be doing surveillance for them but Cas liked it this way. He was already doing more than enough for them with the phones and Rowena wasn't eager to put him in the line of danger.
"Eileen says airplane food may not be the best and honestly, I hate it, so I don't wanna eat the in-flight food. Castiel offered to take us out for lunch, is that okay? I can just go with him alone," Sam replies. There is a suggestive lilt to Sam's voice that Dean knows is there because he's poking fun at Dean's stupid crush on Castiel.
“Of course,” London says, turning around and leaning against the vanity to look at Anael. “Are you getting cold feet now?”
He passes by the arrival hall and sees paparazzi so he slows and squints, trying to make out who it is.
Cas is understanding in his own way — he stills gets him coffee while Dean buys him his, and he may still rattle off orders the moment he comes through the silver elevator doors but at least he doesn't think to mention John again.
Take care of Chevy and Clarence for us. Stand up to your father. Never lose your capacity for kindness. Keep finding the humour in things. Believe there is good in the world. Know that your brother is here. You have never been alone, and you will never be again. Nobody is ever truly gone. The good things will always be here waiting for you.
"Now, I don't have photos but I know someone who does and they can get them to me before you can call security. The pictures will be with Lucian before I'm out of the building. Your face in that costume will be on the front cover of Dark Angel before Castiel gets kicked out of NOVAK." Meg smiles sweetly, crossing one leg on the table. "You fuck with my boss, you fuck with me."
Sam insists, "Kansas might not even be in the bank! Look, I'll go. If they catch me, we'll send someone else as a nurse. They won't believe that we'd send two fake nurses in a row. Are we agreeable? We don't have time for a debate." Zachariah eventually gives up arguing and agrees while Donna goes to get him nurse attire to change into.
They're staying in the bank, and they're going to act like everything is just fine. If people want to enter the building, they'll let them in, and they'll let one out irregularly so it doesn't seem out of the ordinary. Dean wants at least 50 hostages at all times. They need a bargaining chip, the same way they had the state secrets, Frank Devereaux and Jack Kline in the first one, so Dean searched long and hard to find their ultimate chess piece. Obviously, some jewel shop won't have state secrets or a governor. But a royal family relative?
"Dean," Crowley calls, breaks him out of his trance. Cas turns away to pick out a rifle. "Sam says most of the hostages are in the main lobby. Do you want us to fetch the rest or hold off for now?"
Abaddon goes to the door's controls and looks over the Dalís, a proud look on her face like her kid just graduated school. "Look at you all. So full of hate. I spared your friend!" Unconvinced, their hands all edge to their guns, and Abaddon adds, "But I did promise death on two of you." She raises her gun before anyone else can.
"Correct. Kansas sends his apologies. He's busy," Castiel replies. With Crowley up here, Kansas has taken over his duties of managing the gold. Castiel knows Kansas has been itching to get his hands on the gold, so he's sure he's revelling in his temporary position there. It's better if he and Kansas are stationed at different places anyway after last night. Distance is better. Sam looks irritated at Kansas slipping out of his fingers again but says nothing in response to that. Castiel orders, "Vegas, search him."
In an attempt to take some edge off between them, Gabriel cuts in, “Look, are you and Adam good to go?”
In the camera, she makes some comment to one of the inmates that he can’t make out since the footage has no audio, but the inmate scoffs at her. Michael puts the list back into the drawer, trying to think of what to do.
Dean gets his supplies and goes to the main bathroom, wanting to take a morning shower — it’s gross, to say the least. Even with multiple bathrooms all around, it’s still crowded and some aren’t even dressed modestly. Dean ends up deciding to forgo the shower and just brush his teeth in his cell.
“I’m on a job right now but I’ll call you back.” Dean had been excited about it until the rest of the message played. “Leave a message after the tone.”
“Adam and Michael,” Dean starts. Given that Michael’s no longer in the prison and therefore effectively excluded from the plan, Cas guesses that Dean is starting with the least critical problem first. “It’s my fault this happened to Michael, I should have used one of my favours to get Lilith out of here before anything happened and now Adam’s so close to hating me for not doing that. Sam’s gonna be really mad when he realises what we’ve done.”
“Dean broke up with me,” Cas sighs shakily. Bela turns to look at him and takes in the sight; his hair is dishevelled and his face, tired. He’s wearing a white button-up that only has the bottom three buttons done and black slacks. He looks like he’d been crying for a while.
Dean's leg bounces in its place as each design walks out. It just doesn't help that the workmanship is so botched because Cas fucking loves impeccable work which is why he does the most intricate pieces himself. By the time the collection's done walking and the first model comes back out again, Dean knows Cas's brain has fizzled out when he grabs his hand and rushes out of the hall.
“So I take it you had fun, then?” Cas takes the Cartier bag from him and peeks inside, walking with Dean back to their shared office space. He takes out the box. Dean shuts the door behind them as Cas puts the bag down on the desk, opening the box to look at the bracelet. It’s one of the cheapest ones in the store. Astoundingly enough, since it costs $2,240. It is made of 18K rose gold, two small rings interlocked and held with a chain; simple but elegant. Cas smiles.
Abaddon shuts the electrical box after cutting off the cameras and landline. They were not difficult to find, which is their own stupid mistake. Now they've lost their eye in the sky. Entirely blind and deaf to her whereabouts. Now, they're the ones trapped in the bank. Who's laughing now?
I apologize for leaving snails in your locker. It’s the only one I can slip a snail into that’s near the pool. Mine is too far away.
Dean sits down next to him. "Sounds good. Michael was saying it'll hurt his rep with the dumbasses."
"She was going to kill my brother, the nurse," Dean explains. "If that happened, his husband will kill me, my husband
It's about five minutes later when he hears the doors to the indoor pool open, the sound echoing through. Cas walks in, looking around until he spots Dean and his mouth falls open. "You're Locker 275?"
" the president says, but Castiel feels numb yet overly sensitive all over. He wonders if Dean is watching the news right now, what he thinks of it. He wonders if everyone he knows is watching. They must be.
The go up the stairs and fall silent as an inmate walks down past them. Once he’s gone, she says, “Me, Dean, Gabriel, Michael, Adam and Cas are here. Your mother asked for our help to get you off of death row. We couldn’t say no.”
shirt and smelling it. He smiles at the clean smell and says, “If I meet her, I’m gonna see if I can befriend her. Do you think she’ll let me meet John Krasinski?”
Cas nods, unable to find something to say, and sips at his coffee. He closes his eyes to savour the heat in his mouth, feeling it warm him up.
you can free him and I'll go back in quietly. Don't forget that you're asking me to sell out the robbers and you said the one who let me out is my brother too. You want me to turn on my brother? You'll have to let this one go."
Meg uses the tip of her boot to push her office door open, holding out an arm to tell her to go in. "And you're the one who wants to royally fuck over my boss. We should talk."
I went to bed after he left. I have History tomorrow, so maybe I’ll get to see Dean again. After he left and I was alone in the house again, it felt like... Do I even have a word?
Castiel really did try to remember what Gabriel said. In fact, it’s one of the most stand-out memories he has of his childhood. But he couldn’t.
Castiel blinks himself awake and stares blearily into the darkness, seeing the silhouette of Rome -- Balthazar Freely -- in the doorway against the hallway light. He mumbles, rubbing his eyes, "It's late, what do you want?"
Sam stifles a laugh and the two put the items down on the map table to await the souls from Hell and the Veil.
Yes, Gabriel. I'm well aware of the pride you take in fetching Castiel from school... Despite how mundane the task...
There, she looks in the windows of every room until she finally sees Michael in room 3. Quietly, Anael opens the door. “Michael? What did Alastair say?”
“It’s not a yes,” Dean says the moment he catches Cas’s eyes — he’s not angry or upset, he just looks… defeated and tired. “But it’s not a no, either. Ro, you gotta give me a minute to think about it.”
“Well, I certainly refuse to die alone, at least,” Bela says, like the idea itself was absurd. "If I die, I die with friends."
Dean answers, foot-tapping in anxiousness of every second lost, "Angeles got shot in his shoulder. He's losing a lot of blood, none of us... Please. We need a surgeon." Sam tells him to give him a second and he listens to his debate with Colonel Zachariah Adler, straining his ears to pick up every word of it. The tide gets pulled further away from their shore with Sam losing out on authority and Dean's heart beats louder and louder in his ears.

Berlin is also missing this morning, down in the basement to begin work to obtain the gold bars. Gold bars on their own are too heavy, so Dean's plan was to melt them down into gold grains instead. Easier to transport and smuggle out now that they're way lighter and smaller. The vault with the gold bars has a security measure where the moment someone touches the door, the vault will fill up with water at 7,500 litres per minute, which means that it will be completely full in sixteen minutes. When they open the door, they're dead. Dean's plan is to not open the door at all.
, who apologized for living when he was 15 years old. Gabriel was terrified. Castiel promised to stop drinking, but when that friend of his never showed his face again, Gabriel knew he lied.
“That’s good,” Kelly Kline smiles. It’s a relaxing sight, in a different way from Dean’s. “Did you make any friends?”
Dean folds his arms over the top of the bench, watching Cas clean up the altar. “I keep thinking you’d look really good in a CO uniform. That blue would really make your eyes pop.”
"Well, he's a cop," Dean shrugs. Angeles gives him a flat look but doesn't argue Dean's point. The matter dropped, Dean says, turning to go down the stairs, "When he called, he didn't say who got shot, just that it was a man. I thought you got shot and it... felt like shit."
He thinks, reaches for anything else to pray for. "Would you be angry with me if I stopped attending church for good? I will always be loyal to you, but I fear... Well, I fear a lot of things, actually. But I pray that it is within your understanding that some of your followers may be misguided in some aspects. But I am loyal to you still, and I do not need to be in a cathedral to love you." A moment passes before he sees Dean beginning to make his way back, so he mumbles a quick thank you and Amen before his hands fall away to his sides.
Five months after, Palermo still feels just as lonely even with Sam and Jess to keep Cas company. He still missed Dean just as much. He'd had a message passed on to him from Alfie a month after, when the kid had been released, from Dean — that he would be back to him as soon as possible and to not visit him for his own safety.
"In and out with me, come on," Dean says once they're out in the hallway. Since everyone's inside (most importantly, all the reporters and camerapeople are inside), Dean has no hesitation when he cradles Cas's face in his hands. "Breathe, babe." Cas follows Dean, his eyes focused solely on him as they breathe in unison. Dean gives him a small smile. "Better?"
Castiel says sarcastically, "Well, it's not as if I have a choice, you are my personal assistant." He does end up laughing softly, though, adding, "But you're welcome."
"I think this is their attempt to save themselves after the whole Jack Kline dilemma," Rome says. "We just need to strike back with something bigger. Prove it's not true or sell them as assholes again."
Dean presses a quick kiss to his lips before pulling away. Sam pulls out some candy and chocolates from his bag as Dean explains, "After the op, you'll have to rest so you won't be able to go to Halloween, so I thought we could bring Halloween to you."
Naomi glares at her like she's killed her family and Meg fucking loves it. Putting Naomi in her place, Meg is on top of the world. She finally relents, angry, "Fine." She takes her phone out of her handbag and types into it, showing Meg a text sent to both the other women reading 'It's off.'
But this is ridiculous and sad and pathetic because Cas is being such a dick about everything but Dean can't stop thinking about him. This has to be a new record or something for how stupid Dean can be. It's almost like Dean's in a romantic comedy except there's nothing romantic about it and the only joke is him and his infatuation with Cas.
"A chance, that's good." Adam nods as if trying to convince himself. "Can you please call them and ask who got shot? Please, Mick."
Rowena immediately leans over to pull Sam into a comforting hug and Violet and Michael are respectfully silent to give them space.
“Okay,” Dean nods, taking it in. His desk is pretty spacious but he suspects that it’ll be overflowing soon enough. “How accurate would you say
Charlie wears an Oscar de la Renta outfit, a sleeveless navy gold chain-embroidered chiffon blouse with matching pants, hammered hoop earrings, and ruby asymmetric sandals. Missouri has a Jibri swing coat on, gold hoop earrings, black suede ankle boots by Manolo Blahnik and a simple black dress. Dean went with an outfit that he’ll return to the storage closet once he’s done and cleaned it, full YSL; a tailored jacket with a notched lapel and pants, both in Jardin noir jacquard, a white cotton poplin shirt, a short silk scarf, and tortoiseshell oxfords.
Cas, though? Cas has been quiet. Dean hasn’t seen him since the Michael and Lilith incident. To be fair, Dean had been promptly sent back to his cell by Adam after Michael was confirmed stable. Gabriel came back about an hour after and told him about his history with Michael. At least now, Dean understood a little better.
"Dean!" Cas protests but Gabriel manages to get him back into the prison so he can leave and Dean looks back at the door. Knowing how many cops are out there is a bit intimidating but he's walked right into a cop tent before and he'd been fearless. He just needs to be Kansas one more time.
i convinced him to watch spirited away, i know you like that movie so we're gonna watch that tonight
“Okay, Castiel,” Dean replies. "What the hell did you do that for? What were you gonna do? What do you think Gabe's gonna do? He'll bring you back to life and kill you if he heard you did that."
I hope Cas is having a happy Halloween, trick and treating and all. I know he wanted to celebrate it.
"No, no," Dean quickly says, walking over to take the jacket back out. He runs it over with his finger, feeling the material under his skin. Cas watches him carefully, in a way that he would never have months ago, and it almost hits Dean like a truck, the realization that it is now all different. Cas apologizes, and Dean is designing for his brother's wedding, and he is ready to begin to move on. "If you like it, you can have it. Or you can give it to Anna. Or Jo, you know, she kinda likes Chanel."
?" When Dean doesn't answer, Sam can't help but chuckle. "He probably just told you a thousand reasons why he loves you and you're jealous that he and I talk about
“One of them’s actually killed someone before and he sure as shit didn’t get thrown in jail for that. The other one’s a practising doctor who knows every chemical like the back of his hand. Pick your poison,” Dean says. “And they’re my family too, you know. When I get a plan in motion, you better follow it. You go off-book and get Michael killed, I’ll return the favour.”
While Angeles and Dean change into the police uniforms, Angeles asks, "Are you sure this will work?"
“Now?” Dean asks, still rubbing sleep from his eyes. He squints against the stream of sunlight coming through a crack in his curtains. It’s way too early.
Adam almost crumbles to his knees when he sees someone in a Dalí mask walk up to the window, phone held to his ear as he looks down at him. It might be Dean but he knows it could be Detroit -- Dean told him that Detroit could answer the cop phone too since their voices were the most similar with the modulator. Regardless, Adam felt so relieved but it doesn't last long when he recalls why they brought him out to stand in front of the Factory.
Dean nods, taking his beer bottle, "I know, I just didn't feel like going back to my room so soon. Is that okay?"
It hurts to see Dean be so torn up about his identity and to have his insecurity about all his relationships laid out in the open without knowing how best to help him. At the very least, he’s secure about the fact that they will be back in Palermo by tomorrow evening, more or less, and they’ll have all the time in the world to deal with Dean’s personal problems.
"No," Adam says. It's admirable how full of determination Adam was to keep his fellow robbers safe but Ketch knew he could break him if he had time. It just needs to be before Kansas finds out about Adam's detainment and comes up with a plan to get him out. Ketch had already gone off-book for it. He arrested him without a warrant and dragged him back to the tent as quietly as he could so Adam's arrest wouldn't be all over the media and they would have time. He could get kicked off the force if this is discovered but this also means he gets to do whatever the hell he wants to do to Adam.
