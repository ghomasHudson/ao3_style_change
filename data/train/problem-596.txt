John thinks, turning to face her.
“Hang on,”  A voice in the background.  “Did I just hear what I think I heard?”  Lestrade’s face appears behind Rosie, squinting at the small screen.  “Oh my

He smiles warmly, nods.  “All right,” And we quietly finish our meals.
“Always love having her here, you know that.  Any time.” We say our goodbyes and head back out to the idling cab.
Eight minutes of silence.  John has begun to let his mind drift into
Rosie makes herself known about a half hour later with a shrill squeal and a screeched “Dad!  Daddy!”  The three adults in the house have settled on the sofas in front of the softly crackling fireplace, and the sound of ripping paper can be heard over the second floor banister.  A moment later a series of freshly unwrapped plush toys make their way down the slide, followed by a mop of blonde curls.  When Rosie sees the mountain of gifts waiting beneath the tree, she turns to them, wide eyed.
He doesn’t like it at all.
Sherlock’s heart nearly stops dead in his chest.  He reminds himself to breathe.
).  She didn’t.
The silence that follows is stifling, John’s confidence slowly beginning to crumble into the depths of Sherlock’s studious gaze.  He’s been listening intently, standing stock still, hands grasping John’s hips with an increasing intensity as the moment drags on for an impossibly long time, the two of them staring at each other unabashedly.
“Hello?  Ben?” Ah.  Got her. Hypothesis confirmed.  Four wide eyes on me and a long, stunned silence.
“Oh my god,” John breathes out, entirely spellbound, gaze fixed on the ethereal being hovering above him.
“My God,” He says with a smirk.  “California has changed you.”
John had smiled flatly, demeanor cold as ice, breath smelling of whiskey—and claimed he wouldn’t be watching it,
“I believe that she requires our assistance,”  Though I’m still unsure why she hadn’t revealed herself from the start.  “This location was chosen deliberately—close enough to Hal’s pub of choice to keep an eye on him, but removed enough to not raise much suspicion.  Believable as a holiday destination—a quaint cottage amongst the trees,” I suspect she presumed that Henry would be sent to our residence at some point, and therefore the location would be revealed to our suspect.  I’ve read and reread each of her eight increasingly desperate emails from the last eleven months. Now that I know the voice behind the words, I can see that her concern is sincere. Whatever Hal is up to, it has affected her directly.
“I’ve never had this,” He whispers, his fingers tracing the curves of my ribcage.  “It’s never been like this for me, not even close.”
The second time I wake, it’s to John softly brushing curls from my forehead.  I look down at him and he peers back into my eyes.
“Would you like it to be?”  Sherlock responds, stepping into the room and leaning against the wall.
“We were asking what on Earth brought the two of you all the way from London to our humble little town.  John claims you’re on holiday, but surely that can’t be the whole of it. So? Are you on a case or not?”  I roll my eyes. Time to set aside my inner turmoil and play the part I’ve come here to portray.

“Mycroft is paying—”
The train pulls away from the station and it feels as if we’re being launched into a future unknown—hand in hand, eyes locked and hearts full.  John leans against me, rests his head on my shoulder.
I stare intently at the screen where it rests in my shaky hand.  Watch the three tiny dots appear, disappear, appear. I’m unsurprised that he’s struggling to respond.  I didn’t expect this to be easy. The last time we saw one another we certainly couldn’t find the words, and it’s only gotten worse in the months of near silence that followed.
all of this. He bloody well knows.  He gathers his wits enough to snap his mouth shut and take a deep breath, nostrils flaring—preparing to argue the point.  She doesn’t know what she’s talking about.  He is well aware of what Sherlock has done for him, knows how much the man has forgiven of him over the years, knows that he loves him, even, and Rosie too—but all that is beside the point.
He pulls up the Wikipedia page.  Beaches and fisherman and tourists.  Pubs and cafés and holiday houses.  The setting of a terrible eighties comedy film that Sherlock found on YouTube and scoffed at for four minutes before closing the tab.
“Only because she
“All right,” I say quietly, swallowing around the lump in my throat.  I don’t trust myself to say more.
A jolt of panic, head jerking toward the window when the unmistakable sound of tires on gravel accosts my ears.  John abruptly sits up, retracting his hand and glancing at me with wide eyes. We both freeze, staring for a long moment until my phone pings where it sits at my side.  I scrabble to pick it up, hastily unlocking the screen, stomach lurching uneasily when I see the contents.

“We are.  Of course we are,”  John can’t meet his eyes.  He wants to understand, needs further explanation.  He wants to know why removing himself from the equation was Sherlock’s grand solution.  “I’m sorry, John,”  Is all he says.
“Suppose you’ll be happy to get back home tomorrow.  Surely this is getting to be a bit much,”  She smiles a self-deprecating smile.  It is a bit much.  His shoulder is furious with him for sleeping on an inexcusably stiff sofa for four nights in a row, Harry’s flat is constantly freezing and they’ve hardly left it, he’s tired of eating subpar takeaway and Pot Noodle, tired of bickering with his sister, and he misses his enigmatic bastard of a best friend.  But—but.  That isn’t what she needs to hear right now.  And it isn’t the whole of it, anyway.  It’s complicated.  Always is, with them.
We’ve managed to relocate to the bedroom—jeans, t-shirts, pants forming a trail across the floor.  No damnable fabric separates us now—no barriers between us, only skin. John has broken free of my lips long enough to retrieve a bottle of lubricant from his luggage, causing my heart to skitter across the room in anticipation.  We’re really doing this—we’ve made it here at last. I lie on my stomach, watching as he crawls into bed beside me, kneeling over me and setting the small bottle on the bedside table. His eyes roam over my body, then his hands do the same.  Palms brushing firmly across my back, then lower—sweeping over my skin, mapping each crease, each curve—each part of me that he hasn’t allowed himself to seek. I close my eyes, basking in this profound intimacy—allowing myself to feel it, to give myself over to him completely.
“Well, I only want to be sure that we’re on the same page.  There are a few things that aren’t clear to me, and I’d like to know where you stand.  And, Sherlock—whatever you decide, I’m fine with,” He hesitates, wanting to be clear.  “More than fine.  I’m—all of this has been—“ He huffs, exasperated with his own lack of eloquence.  But Sherlock nods, the corner of his mouth lifting slightly.

Saliva pools on Sherlock’s tongue.
Molly pleads, glaring at Greg’s baffled expression and disheveled grey hair, a fond smirk threatening to shatter her illusion of disapproval.  They all look up abruptly at a sudden movement on the loft, gazing in amusement as Sherlock spirals elegantly down the slide, leaping off the end with a flourish and scooping Rosie up into his arms.
“How’d you manage that, then?”
We spend the afternoon hanging about the house, chatting about our recent case, the trip they’re planning in Leicester this weekend, what restaurants we’d like to visit while we’re in town.
I'm SURE you're all aware, but in case you're not: John (Martin) looks
“Sorry?”
We avoid the guided tours—obviously—and set off to learn on our own what life was like in fourteenth century Wales.  We share a roll from the bakery and watch a combat reenactment until John rolls his eyes and insists we move on. We laugh and laugh, deducing tourists and staff alike, putting stories to the nameless figures that surround us.
John holds his breath as Sherlock stares back steadily, pale irises nearly eclipsed by pupils blown wide.  He nods once, swallowing thickly, then slowly begins to unbutton his shirt—never breaking their gaze as he slips each tiny white disc free and drops the grass-stained, wrinkled fabric carelessly to the floor.  He kicks off shoes and socks, hesitating briefly—then unfastens his trousers, stepping out of them quickly and standing before John in nothing but his posh black pants.
“Yes,”  She doesn’t meet his eyes, now glancing out the window at the vineyards, the rolling green hills.  “For a long time I’d hoped—thought perhaps I could locate her, or that you would. I’d hoped you’d come sooner, but I don’t blame you for that.  I went about it all wrong. I see that now,”
He glares.  “Look mate, are you going to go sift through that ash or not?”  I roll my eyes, pull my gloves on, and get to work.
I think.  Barriers breached.  He tentatively begins to tug my shirt from where it’s tucked into my trousers.  “All right?” He asks, searching my face for permission. I nod. Once he’s pulled my shirt from its confines, he begins to slowly unfasten buttons, watching me for signs of protest.  I have none. The fabric hanging loosely from my shoulders now, his eyes roam over this new expanse of flesh he suddenly has access to. Meeting my eyes again, he carefully runs his palms across my pectorals, down my sides.  I shiver violently, my skin buzzing beneath his fingertips. He registers this and snakes his arms around my waist, pulls our bodies close. I let my forehead drop to his shoulder, slide my hands up his back, feeling for the scar that he’s hidden from me for all these years.  I map it with the pads of my fingers, think of how we’d never have found each other at all if he hadn’t been given this scar. A series of random events led him to the lab that day. Both of us existing in a grey, miserable haze until we unexpectedly found one another and learned that life could have colour.

“I love you,” He says.  Oh, John.  Did I say all that aloud?  No, no he’s only reading my mind again.  Searching my face and seeing my thoughts there.  Scrolling across my cheekbones like a neon marquee.  “Today was perfect,” He says, too.  I reach for his hand, press his knuckles to my lips.  Kiss each pad of his fingers. He watches me carefully, reading the waves of emotion that roll off of me whenever I’m with him—impossible to contain.  A smile.  His hand on my cheek.
“Thank you,”  He says quietly.  “For the lasagne and for everything else,”  Sherlock will know what he means.  He knows where John’s thoughts tend to go when they speak of these things.  John turns his head to meet warm grey eyes, lingering for a moment before leaning in to kiss those lips with slow, gentle purpose.  “Come on,”  He whispers, then stands with a bit of effort, extending a hand to pull Sherlock up after him.  He raises an eyebrow at Rosie, who ambles around the corner just as they rise.  “You’re both in need of a bath.  You first, kid,”  She wrinkles her nose and begins to protest when John reaches out and lifts up a long blonde curl coated in dried pink paint.  The evidence is damning, and she concedes with a glare, shuffling through their flamboyant front door and heading for the stairs.

For all his eccentricities, Sherlock is fairly predictable in his demeanor.  John knows what the man looks like when he’s deep in the halls of his mind palace.  Knows when he’s starving and simply unwilling to admit it, when a black mood is upon him and he’s lost to himself and to everyone else.  Knows how he looks in sleep.  But this is new.
“Oh,”  He lets his eyes fall closed and imagines Sherlock is beside him, whispering against his skin, lips pressed to the shell of his ear—a scenario that’s suddenly within their realm of possibility.  John shivers.  Ninety hours since they’ve spoken and now they remain silent for a small eternity, listening to each other breathe.  In, out.  Sherlock seems to be waiting, giving John a moment to collect himself.  So he tries valiantly—takes a deep breath, aims for levity.  “Thought we’d been speaking this whole time.”
“I should call Rosie,” He whispers, lips lightly brushing my neck.  Yes, he should. We’re on our fourth day here and he hasn’t spoken to her once.  I have failed—until now—to consider the sacrifice he’s made to be here with me. He’s an incredible father, and they’re very close.  He must miss her immensely. “Don’t want to move,” I smile against his shoulder. Neither do I.
His hands slide back to the nape of John’s neck, pause for a lingering second, then pull him in.  John goes easily, happily, moulding himself against Sherlock’s chest—wishing he could sink entirely into him, be

Three dots, another ping.
“Ah—yes.  Bit closer to your place actually.  Chiswick.  Sherlock bought—“
Sherlock leans up, supporting himself on both forearms, and presses a kiss to John’s mouth, lingering only for a moment.  He smirks at the surprised and pleased look he leaves behind.
less chaotic energy overall—221 has become a veritable oasis.  Inspections have been passed, permits have been obtained, and as of an hour ago, John has hired his old friend, boss and (briefly) lover Sarah Sawyer on as house manager and medical expert extraordinaire.  She’d been looking for a career change and he’d been looking for a competent human being to relieve him of the many duties he’d taken on in the last three months to pull the place together.  Frankly, he’s exhausted.  And now
“I do as well, John,” He’s perfect. “I want everything.”
“Not sure what you mean,” John says casually, pressing his lips to my cheek and wandering off toward the living room.  The smile that spreads across Molly’s face is genuine, albeit quite smug.
Lovely.  I wonder how long it’ll be before Hal shows up
John comes like a raging tempest, back arching, head thrown back in a startled shout over Sherlock’s shoulder, warm semen spreading under Sherlock’s steady palm.  He shudders and shakes and grabs for Sherlock’s hands as he falls back into him and allows himself to be held.
“John, hi,”  She narrows her eyes slightly.  “Been awhile.”
“Oh yes,”  Molly agrees, sounding a bit conspiratorial.  She waves a hand toward the tree.  “So are we going to decorate this thing, or what?”
I pull him in tighter, press my lips to his temple.  “Idiot,” I say, quietly.
“I told you, he got held up at the Yard.  Apparently whatever this case is, it’s a real head scratcher.”
Last night really happened.  It really, really did, even if John can hardly wrap his sluggish, hungover mind around it.  They’d hardly spoken, during or after, and he can’t help but feel a looming sense of dread about what was, without question, one of the single best moments of his life.
John is staring at me intently, looking a bit uncertain.  Need to get it together. I stop the bouncing and the rapping.  Will my muscles to release their tension, if only a bit. “All fine.”  A hand on his upper back. “Shall we get some more chips?”
I don’t read the others.  I open his contacts, see that my name is still among them.  Replace my old number with the new one Mycroft set me up with.  Hand it back.
“What are you telling me, John?”  I turn toward him, tucking my legs up under myself, mirroring his position on the bed.  Again, he sighs.
“Does it change anything for you?”  I ask. I want to know. I want to know if he wants things to change—if such a small thing is enough to shift our relationship into uncharted territory.

“So?”  Someone asks loudly.  I realize with a start that all eyes are on me.
“Tired of listening to them talk war?”  Danny asks, a knowing look on his face. “I’ve had to accept that I’ll never understand.  It’s a big part of his life that I wasn’t there for. Not easy to come to terms with,” He’s right, it isn’t.  I’ve always been sorry that John and I met so late in life. He has a layered past—so many experiences—so many

It doesn’t work.  “What about Kenneth?” She’s uncomfortable, defensive.  Runs a hand through her short black curls.
“Sherlock—”  John begins, immediately cutting himself off.  He turns toward me, dislodging Rosie slightly. She stirs.  Doesn’t wake up. “I—” He sighs. “I just want you to know that I have no expectations about anything at all.  Nothing has to change if you don’t want it to.” Do I want it to? I don’t know entirely what I want. I know that I want him in some capacity—we already consider each other family—we spend every day together.  We’re closer to each other than to anyone else in our lives. Could we be a proper couple? Is that ever going to be an option for us?
the only one who seems to question it,”  He turns his head toward me, removes his sunglasses, narrows his eyes.  “And it isn’t as if I’ve never had to work for a living, idiot,” I add for good measure.  “You know full well I was cut off for years during the drugs phase,” Not entirely sure I've managed to come across as anything but a privileged wanker, but at least I’ve said my piece.  He continues to stare for an uncomfortably long moment, then abruptly stands, suddenly hovering right in front of me. Hands on my cheeks, he presses his lips to my forehead—sending my stomach through the floor and my heart spinning wildly into the ether—then drops back down in his seat, reaching for a menu.
Harriet Watson’s flat is appallingly small, but fairly tidy—a space that’s been hard-won and barely held on to.  Perhaps she’d agree to allow John to remain within its walls, to keep a weather eye on him, if Mycroft covered a year’s rent.  He suspects, though, that she’d be offended by such an offer—just as stubborn and irrationally independent as her brother has proven to be.  Perhaps not, then.
“I want you,” He breathes, blue eyes vulnerable and searching.  Oh,
Back in control, I rip his shirt off over his head.  My fingers dance across his body, twist his nipples, lick his chest

“Right, of course.  Let’s go, then.” As Lestrade turns away, I look back at John.

“This one,”  He declares, tugging at its twine until it emerges from the cluster of aromatic green.  He drags it free, standing over it proudly, hands on hips.  When he glances up, their eyes lock—Sherlock is dazzling and brilliant in the winter sun—and John’s a goner.  He knows full well he won’t be winning any battles today.
When I approach the others, John automatically wraps an arm around my waist, bringing me into their circle.  Mrs. Hudson watches this casually affectionate gesture and grins up at me. She still hasn’t quite calmed down about our relationship—providing a steady stream of smug smiles and inappropriate questions each time I see her.  I wonder if she’s asked John which of us bottoms, or if it’s only me who’s had the privilege of stammering through a response to that particular question. She never gets answers, but she keeps on asking. Still, it’s nice to be so wholly accepted, I suppose.  She only wants the best for us.
“Oh, you know how it is with siblings,” She muses, shuffling around the kitchen, preparing tea.  “She’s a right pain in my arse, but I’ll miss her when she’s dead. Which may not be too far off, mind.”  She tilts her head and gives us a pointed look. “Old age, you know.”
And he grins and asks our guests how they spent Halloween.

He links our hands together and peers up into my eyes.  “They’re completely lovely,” He says. “All of this--I’m so glad we came.”
Now that we’ve somehow made it through—to a point where we’re comfortable with physical contact and have officially chosen to be together—do I want more?  Am I actually interested in attempting a sexual relationship with John? Unclear. Still not convinced that it would be a good idea. While I’m certainly intrigued by the thought, I’m not sure we’d survive if the outcome were unfavourable.  What if we aren’t compatible? What if John really is
"It is,
What does that mean?  We haven’t discussed it.  If I’m being honest, I’m ready for anything—anything at all, whatever he can give me.
The darkness has been replaced by morning light.  Yellow beams stream through the small window of the upstairs bedroom, illuminating the lines on John’s face.  Highlighting the worry there. Don’t be worried, John. You know this is just how I am.
“Shall I open them?”  Not entirely sure what is going on here.  He nods, looking a bit wary. I tear open the envelope dated
“Talk to me,”  She demands, handing him a steaming mug and dropping down into the armchair beside the couch.  The look he gives her is brief, but glutted with the sort of concentrated disdain that no doubt serves as a proper warning for anyone who’s dared to get in his way.  She glares right back, truly unmoved by her brother’s attempts at intimidation.  “Go on then.”
A few months back, he’d found some footage from a birthday video they’d filmed for John that first year he’d come into Sherlock’s life—a few minutes of Sherlock being an absolute dick on film.  Greg had brought it to John’s flat along with a few other odds and ends, mostly as an excuse to see for himself that John was still alive and going through the motions.
They’re quiet.  John’s breathing slowly evens out, his fingers now trace abstract patterns over the backs of Sherlock’s hands.  Sherlock wants to see him.  He wants to peer into those bottomless blue eyes and see exactly how he feels about what just happened, to see where he stands.
“Of course not.”
“Sleep all right?”  John asks, handing me a coffee and taking a seat at the little table.  I join them, wondering if it’s too soon to begin questioning Henry about the inscrutable Hal.
“Ah—what?”  It goes without saying that his brows are now raised in amused confusion.  He has grown quite used to these random outbursts from the mind of Sherlock Holmes.

Pulling two mugs from the cupboard, he prepares their tea, already habit again, after hardly any time at all.  He dumps two spoonfuls of sugar into Sherlock’s, stirring for longer than is strictly necessary—stalling, he realizes—then summons whatever Captain he’s got left in him and shuffles back down the hall to the bedroom.
He leans in, presses his mouth to John’s, softly and swiftly.
“I know,”  A wink. I roll my eyes, though I quite admire the confidence.  Seems he’s perked up since we saw him last. “Been chatting with my man, I hear.  You’ve got him on edge,” Ah yes. Naturally, Adam wasted no time texting Ben about our impromptu interrogation.  “He’s worried he spilled a little too much information about our girl. Says you ambushed him,” He directs this at me, though his tone is lighthearted—teasing, not accusatory.

John laughs.  Laughs!  Giggles breathily and shakes his head but nevertheless shifts and shimmies until he’s sitting slumped against Sherlock’s body, one arm pressed firmly against the curve of Sherlock’s arse and his chin coming to rest on the curve of his hip as he peers at Sherlock in expectant amusement.  Sherlock rolls his eyes but cannot for the life of him prevent the small, secret smile that only John can summon to his lips.

We walk side by side through the lobby, my hand protectively placed on the small of John’s back, and he glances at me as we stride toward the doors.  Concern lurks deep, in the pools of his eyes. It hides behind affection, but it’s there nevertheless. He had seen the root of my panic earlier, kneeling on the ground surrounded by the skeletons of cars.  Saw right through the gasping breaths—the wild eyes and flailing limbs—to the one fear that threatened to choke me:
—and no amount of probing with fingers could have prepared me for the way that this feels—for this particular blend of physical sensation and staggering emotion.  I grab for his arms and pull him back against me, into my lap where we kneel on our bed. He drops his head back against my shoulder, panting, and kisses my jaw. I wrap my arms around his waist and turn my head to meet his lips.  Softly, lightly.
“Lovely, really,” Mrs. Hudson agrees with a nod.  Well, this conversation is stimulating. “What have you two got planned for the holidays?”
“The coat,”  Greg thinks back, pondering whether he had a single clue that Molly had somehow ended up with it.  They’ve only lived together for a month, and they’d spent most of their time at his flat before they’d gotten their own place.  He hadn’t known, no.  She must’ve taken it from the morgue that day and secreted it away somewhere.
Sherlock’s outstretched hand lands in strands of soft golden hair, long fingers gliding their way through it and down, eventually winding their way around to the warm skin at the back of John’s neck.  John just looks and waits, takes it all in stride, the press of his chin against Sherlock’s hip making this all feel very, very real.

“Dr. Watson,”  he says firmly, in his most commanding tone.  John shifts immediately, first looking over his shoulder and then sitting up abruptly and swinging his feet around to the floor.  He looks Mycroft up and down and then exhales, sinking back into the relatively new, practical green sofa where he sits.
Neither of them has said a word.

I had put my heart on the line, and he had made me feel as though I’d irreparably damaged our relationship by doing so.  I can wrap my conflicted head around his initial rage—I, too, am prone to harsh reactions that I later regret—but why did it take so long for him to come around?  To be willing to even speak to me about this? Why did I have to invite him to accompany me across the world, to trigger this conversation?
“Did you know?”  He asks, voice light, simply curious.  Greg looks at him.  “The—gift she gave me at Christmas—Molly—did you know she had it all this time?”

“Let’s sit, John,” I slide back into the booth.  He hesitates, but does the same. “How have you been?  And Rosie?”
Sherlock sits in his own chair, barely a foot away, watching John.
“Moroccan,”  Sherlock supplies, stepping up beside John.  “I bought it to match the bath.  Have always had a fondness for Berber textiles,”  John can’t think of a less likely thing to come out of Sherlock’s mouth.  He glances up at the man—always full of surprises.  “I thought you’d like it.”

“And you’re idiotic, for a genius,” He smiles, shrugs.  “Never going to be bored with you, am I?”
After breakfast, the three of them meander down Baker Street toward the park.  Rosie bolts ahead the moment she spots her favourite slide—she’s becoming more terrifyingly independent each day.  John takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly, stopping himself from shouting after her.  He’s trying to let go, a bit—to hover less, to teach her how to make her way in the world without one of them always holding her hand.  Sherlock is better at guiding without smothering, though he still frets.  He clearly believes that he hides it well, but John sees how he worries about her.  They don’t live a particularly conventional life, and they both fear the day that someone decides to use their daughter against them.

is where he’d disappeared to.  John had conjured wild ideas of dangerous cases abroad and had to do some real soul searching in order to stay calm, despite being left out.  Apparently, Sherlock was twenty minutes away the entire time.  “I had wanted it all to be a surprise—clearly not my finest idea,”  He shoots John an apologetic look that he returns with a small smile.  Sherlock couldn’t have possibly foreseen John’s initial misunderstanding.  Water under the bridge, at this point.  “Nevertheless, I’d hoped that the cottage would be ready when—when we needed it,”  John finds himself reaching out, grasping Sherlock’s arm reassuringly.  They

“Yes, well,”  He mutters, feigning nonchalance.  “It was time.”

And I’ll do whatever I can to be there for him.
John says Lestrade will be stuck at the Yard until seven, and will head over after.  I suspect he’s already well aware of the change in our relationship. He gave me one too many knowing glances on Thursday, and likely witnessed my attempts at comforting John after speaking with Ajay as well.  He’ll be supportive. He’s always gone out of his way to show that he’s a friend to us both.
“God, who is this woman?  What makes a person choose this as their life?”  I look at him, scowling at the images of the true Mary.  Rosamund. She was probably bored. I choose not to point out that the two of us have lived similarly reckless lives.  “I’ve seen enough, this isn’t helping anything,” He yanks the drive from its port and holds it out to me. “Here, all yours.”
Now he stares at John, chest heaving, curls windswept where they tumble over his forehead, eyes bright and expectant.  John stares back candidly, heart absolutely roaring, and allows Sherlock to see everything—to see exactly how he feels, to see exactly how his insides are lit like a bloody galactic nucleus.  He wouldn’t have a clue what that meant, having deemed all knowledge of the cosmos beneath him, but the simile fits the scale of John’s feelings.
John stares and stares and stares and stares.  He opens his mouth and closes it twice without a word.  He clears his throat, parts his lips a third time, then gives up on trying to form a proper sentence, shakes his head and smiles.  “Tonight?” He asks quietly.  The relief Sherlock feels would send him to his knees, were he not curled up on the couch, pinned in place by the weight of John’s gaze and the press of John’s chin.  John is asking for clarification.  He is asking what Sherlock
They tend to take fewer cases these days.  John stopped accepting shifts at the clinic last year in order to spend more time with Rosie and to be more available for Sherlock.  He was growing rather weary of the white walls and antiseptic scent that he could never seem to shake, anyway.  So when it had finally occurred to him that he spent every minute of every day wishing he were with them, he put in his notice immediately.
Or a sex life.  Ah, well.
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” This comes out rather more gently than he’d intended.  Cringing inwardly at the thought that Sherlock may think he’s coddling, John clears his throat and continues, his tone firm.  “We make assumptions about each other, Sherlock—always have, really.  It’s caused us a world of pain—
“Go on, then,”  Sherlock encourages, his smile infectious, grey eyes alight with the glow of the fire.  John leans against his side, pillows his head on his shoulder as Sherlock's arm slides around his back.  They silently watch their daughter experience this—her unbridled excitement and recurrent surprise.  He remembers, vaguely, what Christmas morning felt like as a child.  The thrill of it.  But he and Harry had never had anything quite like this.  Sherlock is the one who has given her this.
“That’s nice to hear.  John has made a lot of progress,” She nods at him.  “Your return has been quite a shock, it seems. A shock and a relief.”  Obviously. I nod again, unsure how to respond to such a statement. “He’s mentioned that you’ve been through a shock of your own.  Are you interested in pursuing therapy?” Ah.
“Have you got swim trunks?”  John shouts from the bedroom.  I look up at him from where I lie on the couch—he’s sat on the bed, neatly folding a few items of our clothing and packing them into a small duffel bag.
“We’ve been here before,” He’s surveying the place, recognizing the light pink walls, the dark wooden beams across the ceiling.
Sherlock wants to touch.  He wants to
“And what do you want with Jones?” Brow furrowed.
Then Sherlock, everywhere, all at once.  Pulling him in,
“Hello, love,”  John is beaming, “How’s it going?”
Sherlock says nothing, but his eyes rake over John’s form—memorizing him, perhaps, or deducing what he can from this unfamiliar expanse of flesh.  John stares right back.  When finally their gazes lock, Sherlock steps forward, palms gliding over the hard muscle of John’s biceps, across strong shoulders and up his neck.  He threads fingers through silver hair and carefully reclaims their connection, lips gently meeting John’s at last.  The kiss is chaste—a far cry from the desperate, fumbling embrace they’d shared in the garden.  This is a delicate affirmation, a soft reassurance.
“Positive they did.  One of her
Oh, sorry.  Thought you'd asked how many times I used the word 'bloody' in this chapter.
He whispers, his lips now on my cheek.  How to explain? Not too much, never too much.  Perhaps not enough. I lift my head, meet his mouth.  A slow kiss, deep, raw. An unfiltered response—
Whatever it is, Sherlock (selfishly) loves it.  The absence is something he’d longed for but didn’t quite know how to name—the crumbling of a wall he didn’t recall ever erecting, the tearing down of a veil he’d never meant to put there in the first place.
is what he means.  John loves the place, too, but he’s chosen it for Sherlock.  He wants to stand in the middle of a tropical oasis in the centre of London in the dead of winter and exchange their vows.  He wanted a place as extraordinary and memorable as his chosen spouse, and he’s found it.
Once we’re outside, standing amongst the smokers and the few passersby, John turns to me—his eyes roaming carefully over my face as though he’s attempting to memorize it—then locking on mine once more.  He inhales deeply, takes my hand again. Immediately, my heart begins to race. What is this? “Come on,” He leads me down the street toward our car, parked two blocks down, stopping on the pavement outside the passenger side door.  His eyes bore into mine, and he hesitates before speaking. My stomach drops, dreading what’s coming. “I need to say something. I—” He stops, glancing back the way we came. I follow his gaze, just in time to see Henry jogging after us.  He’s been calling our names. He catches up a moment later.
Is this goodbye, then?  Nice knowing you, I’m fucking off to America?”  He’s upset. Why?
“Case?”
“Of course it’s all right,”  He stands up, pulling John along with him.  “She can hardly pronounce my name anyway,”  He drops one of John’s hands, cupping the back of his head instead and pressing soft lips to his temple.  “Embarrassing, really,”  He says quietly against John’s skin, lingering for a long moment, fingers gliding up through his silver hair.  John shivers, involuntarily leaning into the touch.  “Come on,”  Pulling back abruptly, Sherlock whips out his mobile.  “I’ll call the movers, shall I?  We can spend the day at the cottage,”  John grins through the whiplash he’s surely gotten from Sherlock’s rapidly shifting moods.
John has read and folded and unfolded and reread the letter four (or was it fourteen?) times, with shaking fingers and tear-streaked cheeks, by the time his train has pulled into the station.
Sherlock wakes gradually, feeling more than a bit disoriented—and warm.  Very warm.  Safe.  Cosy.  Well-rested.
Above the worktop are two rows of open shelving, spanning the back wall on either side of the wide window that looks out at a cluster of birch trees.  In the centre of the room sits a massive steel desk and an old leather-upholstered shop stool.  John notes the wheels and can easily imagine Sherlock whizzing across the room from the desk to the sink, possibly because he’s managed to set himself on fire (again).
He’d intended to do so over dinner.  He’d reserved a private table on a lovely rooftop terrace with a staggering view of the sparkling London night.  He’d wanted to climb up, up, up, up and stare down at their city—this time with John right there by his side, within his reach, and absolutely no inclination to take any (literal) leaps.  No toeing the line between solid ground and open air.  No need to fall anywhere but (finally, officially) into each other's arms (well, he can hope).  He’d chosen that specific location for its absurd prices and pretentious menu.  He’d requested a candle.
.  Oh, John.  You were right about me.  Human after all. But I did tell a lie.
John, naturally, had assumed it was for a case.  He hadn’t once questioned the sudden departure from their everyday London life.  He doesn’t question much these days, does not say much at all.  He hadn’t uttered a word about the four hour train ride, the rented Jeep waiting for them at the station, the tiny cliffside cottage they pull up to now, overlooking lapping waves and endless sea.  A case, always a case.  But not this time.
“I’m not going to off myself, you know,”  He says, bluntly.  “I want to.  Christ—”  He shakes his head, looks down again.  “But I won’t.  They all think I’m about to go blow my bloody head off.  Mycroft took my gun, first thing.  Thinks I haven’t noticed, that I haven’t checked whether it’s still there now that I’ve got no one to protect,”  The tears are back, but he gives Greg a wry smile.  “I’ve got this feeling, Greg—can’t explain it.  Just—feels like something’s coming that I need to be around for,”  He stands up straight, tucks his hands back in his pockets.  “Guess we’ll see,”  He says, as he shoulders his way out the door.
“You’ve got questions.  Go on, then,” Straight to the point.  I’ve always liked that about her, despite her incessant need to play games.
The expression reminds her of Sherlock.  Of course it does.  Reminds her of that day, of his cool façade as he’d strode into the morgue, hair matted red and abnormally pale face dripping with someone else’s blood.  She’d been furious, absolutely irate with him.  He had charmed her into assisting by claiming that she’d mattered, that she’d
It’s not an overly-large space, likely not the master bedroom, but it’s spacious enough despite the king size bed that resides against the wall to the right.  The bed is beautiful—a sturdy wooden frame, minimalistic, but with a bit of an art deco feel to the curve of the headboard.  It looks to be antique, but with all stain and varnish stripped away—treated with only oil, giving it a natural, unsullied look.  It’s neatly made with charcoal linens and a vaguely familiar green plaid blanket draped across the foot of the bed that Sherlock must have brought from his room at Baker Street.
He traces the shell of an ear with the tip of his nose.  “—get the hell out of here?”  John snorts, well aware that Sherlock is only present at this party because he’d demanded it.  Feeling nearly giddy, and more than a bit unsteady, he steps back, taking Sherlock’s hand and all but dragging him through the horde and out the door, snatching their coats from the rack on the way.
“What about the two of you?”  He says suddenly—cutting Hal off mid-sentence—the first words he’s spoken all night.  “Tell us your story,” Hal looks briefly mutinous, but recovers quickly, agreeing enthusiastically and giving us the spotlight.
“It's never been like this for me, Sherlock.  I didn’t know that it
difficult for you,” I glare.  He furrows his brow, turns to John.  “Your friend Mr. Collins is backed by some of the most powerful men in the world.  It isn’t difficult for these men to make someone’s entire existence impossible to trace.  Mr. Collins is essentially a ghost,” He sighs, turning to me once more. “Don’t try to
John feels the weight of a familiar gaze and turns to find Sherlock watching him carefully as he encounters their new home for the first time.  Rosie stands at his side, silently looking around, eyes wide—gaze halting on a patch of bright English bluebells growing beneath a window to their left.  John meets Sherlock’s eye and gives him a small smile.
“Oh?  Didn’t want to use the stack of hay that came with it?”
But he’s trying, for Sherlock.  He’s living, now, for Sherlock.  He broke off his feeble bloody engagement for Sherlock, yet still hasn’t found the words to tell the man why.
So he’ll push, a bit.  Only a bit.
At John’s insistence, we stop at a diner for lunch.  I don’t eat, can’t stomach it now. Knee bouncing, knuckles rapping against the laminate tabletop.  A temporary dead end, a momentary lull. Nothing to do but wait. Hateful.
The space is narrow, a mere two metres wide, but immediately it feels—familiar, almost—as if he’s just strolled into something he hadn’t even known he’d needed.  The window on the wall adjacent to the door is one of the four on the front of the cottage, letting in a soft glow of orange light as the sun sinks behind the wall of trees that make up the front garden.  To the right, an antique desk, fitting the space perfectly, as though it’s been there from the start.  To the left, the built-in bookshelves that Sherlock had mentioned when he’d first told John that this place was for him, too.  For
They touch, now.  Beyond Sherlock’s general lack of regard for personal space, they touch.  They touch with affection—a hand on the small of John’s back as they stride, side by side, into a restaurant for a not-date dinner.  A squeeze to Sherlock’s shoulder as John hovers behind him to read the details of a case.  Warm breath against skin.  Fingers brushing unnecessarily but reassuringly nonetheless.  Sherlock takes every opportunity to put his hands on John.
“Well, I—it’s—what do we do now, John?”  That voice.  Low, serious.  Concerned, maybe even terrified.  John can only smile.  It seems he’s forgotten how to do much else.
you could say that will change anything between us,” He leans down to press his lips to my forehead, whispers, “You can tell me anything.  You have me completely, and nothing will change that.”
to remember.  She wants to hold onto the memory of that enigmatic man who brought so much to their rather humdrum lives.  But she understands why John can’t, just now.
“Nothing, as far as I know.  I did this for him once before.  When we first got together. Asked some lady he had pointed out if I could crash on her couch, made coffee in the morning.  She drank it—a lot of it—and I left. Saw her at the Rainbow that same night. She was fine,” He furrows his brow, thinking.  Seemingly trying to recall any details he may have omitted. “Left town about a month later, I think. Nothing weird about that.  Nobody stays here long.” I stare disbelievingly back at him, feeling a subtle rage begin to flow through me, simmering beneath the surface of my skin.
“Coffee,”  John says, nudging Sherlock gently where he stands leaning against the worktop, still quiet and bleary-eyed.  The sun is only just beginning to rise, sending scattered squares of colour over the hardwood floors through the stained-glass windows.  Sherlock accepts the mug with a quirk of his lips, sips it gratefully.
“Glad you could make it,” His hand shifts to my elbow.  “Hope you don’t mind that I tracked down your mobile number—you ran off last night before I had a chance to say goodbye.”
“Come on in,” Maude says without batting an eye as she rounds the corner and spots me lurking near the dressing room.  “This won’t take long,” I follow her into the small room, walls lined with mirrors, countertops full of makeup and an absurd number of wigs.  My eyes roam over the racks of clothing shoved against the back wall. “Every Saturday,” She says with a smirk, saving me from inquiring about how often she performs.  “Thinking of retiring, though. Been doing this for too damn long,” She rolls her eyes as she yanks the wig from her (bald) head. “Ben,” She says, shaking my hand. I nod.
“A murder-suicide last week,” Molly responds, sounding bored.  “A well-known game show host who dropped dead while filming two nights ago.  Only a heart attack. Nothing that would interest the two of you,” She sighs.  Molly isn’t quite so committed to her work, these days. Since she and Lestrade got together, she’s settled down quite a bit—spending more time at home, caring for their various pets (and often for Rosie as well).  I can tell that she wants children of her own. Seems to be an ongoing point of contention between the two of them.  Lestrade doesn’t have much choice but to spend most of his time at the Yard—and as a man of duty, I imagine he doesn’t want to have children that he isn’t able to be present for.  I can sense the guilt that plagues John each time we leave Rosie behind. I know how it affects him. I believe that he justifies the amount of time spent away from her by reminding himself that we’re doing good in the world.  I certainly don’t judge him for it. Rosie is very loved. But I do worry sometimes that my presence is taking away from their time together.
“Sherlock,” John startles me out of my anxiety-fueled daze when he strolls into the kitchen, mobile held out in front of him.  “Here he is,” He grins at Rosie, leaning against my side and tilting the phone to include me. She’s beaming, bouncing around, blonde curls untamed as ever.
I shrug a shoulder.  “I’ve never been. Somewhere new—together—sounds rather appealing.  Don’t you think?” He nods, shuffles closer. I pull him in, tuck his head under my chin.  “I’ve always traveled alone,” I add, quietly. His grip tightens around my waist, soft lips against my chest.
) my phone vibrates.
“I suppose tomorrow morning, if you like,” He looks doubtful.  Why does he look doubtful?
But he doesn’t mind it, really.  There’s always something to look at.
“I assure you, John, that the purchases you’ve mentioned were all entirely selfish endeavors.  After all, I, too, reside in the aforementioned house.  Anyway, look what it’s gotten me.  Now I have you,”  He swoops down to kiss John swiftly, immediately pulling back and snatching up the discarded jumper.  He holds it up to John’s chest, nods to himself, and tosses it back into the trolley.
When John stops wheezing and clutching his stomach, he goes down to help Mrs. Hudson carry her baked goods up the stairs.  She’s outdone herself this time, making enough mince pies to feed an army, as well as a perfect hemisphere of Christmas pudding.  Now we all sit with drinks in hand, chatting easily about Molly’s engagement and the plans they’ve made so far for the wedding. I wonder if it’s odd for John to talk about this.  I wonder, sometimes, if he feels any sort of loss when he thinks of his wedding that never was.
as anything.  Can’t exactly put that man in a box, can you?”  She pulls the plaid blanket from the back of her chair and tucks it around herself.  “Are you surprised he told you?”
anything.  Only that he’s some sort of mad scientist—a chemist, I think—summoned here from England.  No idea what for,” Ben watches me carefully. I try not to betray the surge of excitement coursing through me.  A chemist, really?
Hesitantly breaking their gaze, John looks, only now noticing a single book standing neatly on a shelf at eye level.  He takes the few steps to reach it, holding it delicately in his hands and studying its cover.
(See the end of the chapter for
He does.  Beneath the crinkled wrapping paper is a simple wooden box.  “Oh,” He says, clearly recognizing it. When he flips open the lid, I see that it’s filled with tattered and stained index cards, each covered in the same tidy, looping handwriting.  “Mum’s recipes.”
“First time for everything,”  John mumbles, scowling and taking another sip of his still-too-hot coffee.  I watch him cringe once again. Why? The temperature? Or the
“Yes, well there is that,”  He doesn’t take his eyes off of the grate.  “I am entirely out of my depth.  Another of several reasons I’m rather fearful of altering the balance we’ve struck,”  John can count on one hand the number of times Sherlock has admitted to being afraid.  “But I’m certainly not opposed,”  Oh.
“Not really, no.  Kind of wanted to spend it at home.  The year we did that was the best Christmas of my life,” He pauses, smirks.  “Despite your being in love with Irene Adler at the time.”
My eyes flicker between them, narrowing slightly.  “Oh, for God’s sake,” Mycroft huffs. “We’re family now.  We were discussing exactly that.” Odd. But true, I suppose.
I switch off my mobile.  Molly again. She’s called three times since our little video chat reveal on Tuesday.  She wants to know what’s transpired between John and me that’s given him cause to unabashedly plant his lips on my cheek.  I’m not sure what to tell her. Not sure if she’s aware of everything that happened between us ten weeks ago—I certainly never mentioned it.  She must have wondered why we stopped speaking. Likely figured it out for herself—she’s known how I feel about John for many years.
“What is it?”  There’s that concern again.  A new fixture on his face.
asked those questions, but he’d given it up, deciding that Sherlock was only attempting to drive him mad.  Once the man had collapsed into his lap and fallen asleep, he’d forgotten the obnoxious intrusion of bony feet entirely.  “I wanted to—begin a conversation.  To tell you about this—the house—but also…”  He trails off, sighing and turning against the wall so that they’re face to face at last.  “John, I—”
I now sit in the waiting room, browsing an article on my phone about the supposed normality of one’s partner accompanying them to therapy.  I feel odd about it, but it’s clearly important to him. He’s gone in first--no doubt they’ve got a lot to catch up on--and we’ve decided I’ll join for a bit at the end of the session.
After that damning phone call, he had headed straight for his flat—not to pack a bag, but to retrieve his trusty handgun.  And the rest, as they say, is history.
John fights his way out of what is doubtlessly the most intense fog of arousal he’s experienced in his life, wanting desperately to get this right and to remember every second of it.  In this moment he can’t be certain that the two of them aren’t one entity—he cannot be sure that they aren’t fused together inextricably on a molecular level, bound to each other in some way that John had not previously realized two human beings could be.  He can feel every part of Sherlock as though it were a part of himself—the savage beat of their synchronized hearts a constant thrumming presence in his ears, body, scattered mind.
Sherlock sighs, still unmoving, still basically unresponsive.  John continues, smiling slightly down at him as he begins to doze and trusting that stillness is the best he can hope for—that in some small way this experiment has been a success.
You’ve got no earthly idea what you’re doing—that must be
Frankly, he’s terrified.
“Comfortable couch you’ve got there,”  Henry responds with a nod. Then hesitates for a moment before continuing.  “He’s not all bad, you know,” It seems they’ve already resolved last night’s drama, then.  Unfortunate. He won’t tell us anything if he’s feeling loyal to the man.
I continue to remind myself that it’s only been a week.  We had our first kiss only
“There was a man,”  He finally says, gaze distant, mind apparently stuck in the past.  “A workman.  With Mrs. Hudson, when I—I’d left him in the lab, had gone to check on her—thought she’d—”  He cuts himself off, looking a bit devastated.  Greg has completely lost the thread of this conversation, but does his level best to listen.  “What do you remember of that day?”  John asks, meeting his eye at last.  “Was there anyone—someone who didn’t belong?”  His mind immediately goes to Huxley.  He
“I’m—leaving,”  Her heart sinks.  Somewhere deep down, she’d known this was coming.  “Leaving Baker Street, but not London.  A new flat, that’s all.  Something different—I—it’s for the best,”  His eyes are pleading, begging her to understand.  She does.  Of course she does.  She nods.
“Too soon?”  He asks, voice a bit nervous.  What does that mean? He knows that he’s allowed to touch me—however he likes,
“Henry,” John nods in greeting as we approach.  Hal slides into the booth next to Henry, and I follow, keeping a fair amount of distance between us.  When John drops down to my right, his shoulder bumps mine, and we share a brief glance. He smiles. Leans in slightly and doesn’t move away when I reach for my pint and our arms brush.  My heart leaps lightly at the contact. I’ve told myself that I’ll need to get used to it—that even if we’re going to be subtle about this, we’ll likely end up in these scenarios—closer than we’ve ever really been, regularly invading one another's personal space.
“Yeah, fine,”  He nods, eyes flicking toward the barkeep who’s just approached, eyeing John with wide eyes and a raised brow.  “Aoife,”  He smiles at her hesitantly.
—and John feels bloody buoyant without the weight of it.
“I didn’t—it wasn’t—?”
“My life is not your responsibility, Mycroft!”  John shouts, rising to his feet.  Greg sits frozen in place, watching helplessly as he begins to pace.  “You may have kept your brother under constant scrutiny, but if I want to fuck off of the planet, you aren’t going to stop me.  By the way, you couldn’t fucking stop him, either—”  He suddenly halts, a ragged sob escaping from deep within his chest.  He puts both hands on the back of a chair, hanging his head and trying to breathe—doing more gasping than anything.  Greg can clearly see the tears falling in kind, now.  Christ, this is awful.  This entire bloody situation is absolutely hopeless.  “His life was worth more than mine will ever be,”  He says shakily, eyes closed tight.  “I’m nothing without him—not anymore.  Wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for him.  And now you’re telling me—what?  That I need to continue on with this pathetic existence because of the sacrifice he’s made?  He made the wrong choice,”  His tone is crisp, now.  Cold and sure.  Greg tries not to take it too personally.  After all,
“Yes, John,”  I sigh. I’m exhausted.  We’d hardly slept last night, and this conversation is wearing me thin.   I don’t want to think about it anymore. Don’t want to hold onto any bitterness over this bloody case—over a woman who’s had no real significance in my life.  I can’t blame John for misinterpreting things. I had never bothered to correct him—and we’ve shared enough blunt words for now.
“All right.”
And my hand resumes its place on his back as we head through the door.
John clearly hasn’t thought this through to the end.  As much as he’s been imagining this moment, he hadn’t considered the possibility that he’d get no response whatsoever.  He’d expected an easy, if not especially enthusiastic,
"I should go," he says quietly, eyes still cast downward.  "I have
“You don’t, actually,”  He says, returning to his book.  “It quite suits you,” I stare at him for a moment, waiting for him to continue, to turn the compliment into a jab of some sort.  But he doesn’t. He doesn’t even look up again.
Sherlock can feel John’s boundless blue gaze on him, can feel the jut of his chin pressed against his sternum as John peers up at his inscrutable face.  He can feel the ceaseless sweep of John’s thumb against his skin, the wild, flailing thud of his own heart behind his ribs, the line of warmth that remains, still—cloaking him, keeping him here.  Right here.
now—they have a
Eventually, we break apart, John grinning at me as he reaches for his mobile.  He rings Greg—a video call—and I watch his face light up when Rosie’s pink cheeks and mop of blonde curls appear on the screen.
He whispers against my skin, lightly kisses my cheek.  “I want you,”   Desperation in his hushed voice, and suddenly I fail to breathe.  Heart lodged in my throat, flesh humming—each individual nerve on high alert.  “I want you.  Right now,”   I feel as though I’m melting under the heat of him.  Picture my bones in a puddle on the floor, having seeped out through my pores and leaving me lifeless, ruined.  He’s surrounding me—molded around my body and invading my mind. I can feel his erection growing, pressing heavily against my stomach, unrelenting.  My mind whirls, trying to catch up with this overwhelming input of sensation. His tone is confident, sure. He wants this. Wants
“Hi,”  He breathes, watching as Sherlock’s eyes search his own, one corner of his beautiful bloody mouth tugging upward sheepishly.  John feels his heart rate rise to a gallop as they lie watching one another, silently reliving what they’d shared the night before.
Sounds about right.  Nothing about Mycroft Holmes has ever made much sense to Greg.  While Sherlock was certainly a posh wanker, his brother takes it to another level entirely.  “I don’t know why he’s bothering with any of it.  We were never friends—why take an interest in my wellbeing now that—now that he’s dead?”  He chokes on those final words.  Almost said his name.  God forbid.
“He’s not saying a word, Boss.  It’s like he’s retreated into his own head.  Seems well practiced at the art of interrogation evasion,” She glances over, eyes roaming over John and I briefly.  And then: “Nice to see you boys together again. Knew something as tedious as death couldn’t part the two of you.” My eyes widen of their own accord and John makes a small sound of surprise as she smirks back at us.  “Don’t look so shocked, I’ve learnt my lesson. You’re a posh wanker, but you’re not entirely full of shit. Who knew?” And with that, she stalks off, back where she came from.
hesitant.  He is unsure, always.  But here they are.

John feels his mobile vibrate in his pocket and tears his gaze from Sherlock’s lips to glance at the screen.
to be anything but angry with him.  At the time, I wasn’t ready to confront my own demons—my idiotic, irrational insecurities—and the certainty he had shown me that day had caused me to shut right down.  He knew what we could become, and I couldn’t face it. Walls up, distance in place. Outrage where there should have been warmth. And God forbid I actually consider his words—set aside the preconceived notions I had adopted long ago and reconsider our dynamic, our connection.  It took the thought of losing him—
It had been what caused John to crumble in that moment.  The mention of this, of a
The first thing John notices upon entering Sherlock’s room is that it already looks a bit—well,

hovering, his face a picture of earnest expectancy.  A real question, then.  John’s expression softens.
Who could have guessed he’d find a way to look at home here, of all places?  No doubt sensing my lingering gaze, he shoots me a quick grin before returning his eyes to the winding road ahead.
I wish that things were so simple for John and myself.  We’ve never known how to define what we are to one another, and while we connect deeply on one level, we seem to clash spectacularly on another.  It’s been a source of misdirected anger for John, and self-hatred for me. I will readily admit that he’s everything to me. I just don’t know what that means for us, or if the feeling is mutual.  But I know that he cares.
“Yes, by the way,”  Sherlock mutters quietly, turning to trail a series of feather-light kisses up John’s neck, stopping to rumble directly into his ear.  "Obviously, yes.”
“Welcome!”  Adam shouts, his tanned chest on full display as his linen button-down flaps in the breeze.  He looks like a posterboy for California surf culture—a wave of blonde hair and a smile of white teeth.  Ben grins, following him down the front steps, his bald head and brown skin perfectly complementing Adam’s All-American image.  This is the first we’ve seen them in the light of day—they are truly a handsome couple. I realize I’m staring when John places a hand on the small of my back, shaking me back to the present.  I certainly didn’t expect to be so captivated by the two of them. I suppose the only other homosexual couple I’ve spent any amount of time with is Mycroft and Lestrade. And they're, well—this is just—different.  I wonder, now, how John and I look to the outside world. I’ve always thought we fit together rather perfectly. I have a drawer full of newspaper clippings—blurry black and white photos of us, side by side, false smiles in place—to prove it.
“Oh my
“Anything interesting at the morgue lately?”  John asks Molly, ignoring Lestrade entirely. God, I love him.  Should I tell him that? No. It’s really not the time. And anyway, he already knows.  I make a face at Rosie, who’s been watching me push my french toast around the plate. She giggles—brushes back a few stray blonde curls—and takes a miniscule bite of bacon.
.”  He smiles.
Silence fills the small office.  John still stands, both hands clutching the back of the chair.  He looks up to meet Greg's eyes, expression fierce.
“Two more days?”
It takes but a moment for Sherlock to tip over the edge, spilling between them with a drawn out shout and pulling John along after him with clever fingers.  When his vision restores itself and his body feels capable of motion once more, John opens his eyes to find Sherlock sound asleep beside him.  Grinning at the rare sight, he tidies them both with last night’s discarded t-shirt and curls up against his chest, pulling the green plaid blanket up over their sated bodies.

“What the hell was that, Molls?”  Greg closes the door behind their fleeing dinner guest and gazes incredulously at the gentle and thoughtful and beautiful and
“Starving,”  He laughs, brushing away the crumbs.  This single-word explanation conjures a memory from long ago.  Our first night as flatmates—inviting him along on a case—expecting, perhaps, repulsion and shock.  Expecting the disdain that I am usually confronted with when someone learns of my passion for murder and intrigue.  I had wanted to be wrong. I’d seen something in him the moment he’d walked into the lab with Stamford—knew immediately that I wanted to learn as much about the man as I could possibly find out.  We’d been hesitant to leave each other’s presence that night, so I’d asked him to dinner—a move so out of character for me that I’d wondered if madness was finally creeping in. But he’d agreed, without hesitation.
This comes out as a deafening roar, Ajay attempting to stand but hindered by his shackled limbs. “She
“Sherlock Holmes.  I’ve been told you’d be awaiting my arrival,” I say, meeting her—his?  their? Perhaps I should ask—eyes for the first time. Nearly as tall as I am, voice deep, accent seemingly Californian.  “How shall I refer to you?”

How has he managed to keep
My hands scrabble in the bedsheets as I struggle to remain on my side.  His steady drive is pushing me down, down, into the sheets, and eventually I roll.  He doesn’t miss a beat, on top of me now, thrusting and slamming and
“It’s in London, of course.  I haven’t gone completely mad.  Chiswick, actually.  We can go see it today if you’d like,”  John shakes his head, staring unseeingly at his feet.  What is
horrible.  Far too intimate and uncomfortable for all involved.  He’d failed to convince their parents to even bother to attend the ridiculous charade, and two of the five attendees—Ms. Hooper and himself—were well aware that it was all a sham for the benefit of the other three.  And on top of all that, there were swarms of persistent press stalking the pavement outside the chapel, shouting questions in their faces about what a fraud Sherlock Holmes had been, and following Dr. Watson all the way back to Baker Street.  Sherlock’s absence was certainly felt by all.
John looks entirely at home sitting in my parents’ kitchen, happily eating a scone and looking around the room.  His eyes rove over the pink painted walls, the natural wood accents. Thoughtfully arranged art and souvenirs from their years together.  I think now of the pub John’s family once owned, filled with treasures from the people who passed through. He, too, was raised with an appreciation for objects with spirit, with meaning behind their existence.  Carefully collected to remind us of our past encounters and experiences. I recall John’s stolen journal of case notes and grocery lists, tucked beneath a loose floorboard in what’s now
“Breakfast?”  He rumbles into John’s ear, feeling his compact body shake slightly as he laughs in response.
“Sherlock—”  John sounds wrecked.  They’ve not found their way here yet—talked about it, sure.  Vaguely.  Sherlock quickly made his interest in exploring the depths of his body known.  But this is—
Thanks to everyone who has been reading along, and double thanks to those who've given input and sweet comments.
It feels a bit reckless to ask this of him now.  It also feels somehow more possible than ever.  He knows that Sherlock prefers to text—it’s easier for him to say what he means when there’s a digital buffer between them—but they’ve hardly done so in the past months.  Have had no need.  Have had no space, really.  But something about the prospect of six days apart has apparently allowed Sherlock to be more forthcoming—and the least John can do is reciprocate with his own brand of candor.
Sherlock strides toward the doorway, but pauses with his hand on the knob.  He takes a step back toward John, grasping his face in his hands and kissing him deeply but briefly.  “I love you, too,” He says, disappearing into the hall.
My name is called at precisely ten o’clock.  I find myself seated in a brown leather wingback, across from a man in his early fifties with kind eyes.  His greying brown waves are not unlike my own. We sit in our matching armchairs, in this room with white walls, and it doesn’t feel stark--nor impersonal, as I’d expected.  He’s brought objects from his past lives in, carrying with them an undeniable warmth. Reminders. A small hand-carved totem pole on the side board, a salt-tanned seal pelt on the wall.  An intricately drawn map of New York city, done in pen and ink. On the table beside his chair sits a wheel thrown speckled mug. He clearly favours objects made not by machine, but forged by hand.  An admirable collection.
And now here he stands, unmasking himself—crossing a line he’s never crossed before because he
John has gotten good at this, with time.  He’s found that he loves it.  Loves this intimacy, this connection, the feel of Sherlock thickening against his tongue, the taste of him, all of it.  This is an act of devotion, for him.  He worships with wandering fingers and the slow, steady drag of his lips.  He writes scriptures with his tongue and swallows Sherlock’s sins.
I groan, tossing my mobile to John where he lies sprawled on the other end of the couch flipping through channels on the telly.  He reads it, looking up at me with a smirk.
I reach up, grab his face, pull our mouths together into an ardent kiss, pouring all the affection I feel for him into it.  Slide my tongue against his lower lip, then bite down, gently. He huffs a laugh and leans up, kisses my brow, then breaks away.  “You should also know, I’m not opposed to trying more of that sort of thing. I, ah—want to try all of it, with you.”
Once they’ve devoured one another like two starving men—once they’ve breathed their truths into each others’ mouths and have paused to stand panting into each others’ necks, John speaks into the thick silence that hangs heavy around them.
“We’ll make it work,”  He says, effectively cutting me off.  He’s clearly seen the concern written all over my face.  “It’s lovely, isn’t it?” It really is.
“I love you,”  He says, quietly, blue eyes boring into mine.  I can’t find it in me to formulate a response, so I grab his hand.  We haven’t been at all demonstrative outside of the flat in our weeks together.  I’d assumed he wasn’t open to public displays of affection. Wrong again. Must stop making assumptions, when it comes to John.  “And I love
“Don’t,”  Harry lets her mouth snap shut.  His tone is dangerous, startlingly so.  She hasn’t actually ever tried to speak to him about Holmes.  When the two of them were living their little crime-fighting life together, she and John hardly saw one another at all.  After his death, they’d spent a few awkward, unproductive afternoons in each others’ presence, but at the time John hadn't been able to even hear the man’s name spoken aloud without curling up into his impenetrable shell, and Harry hadn’t had the heart to push him.  But
I pull off with a
“Woke up to the smell of bacon and wondered if I was having a stroke.” He sits down at the table, eyebrows raised in amusement.
In reality, he almost certainly looks hesitant, unsure of this unprecedented leap he’s about to take.  Is taking.  Has just now taken.
I begrudgingly mentioned Eurus and her stupid grenade only because they DID redo the flat once already and it felt necessary to acknowledge that.  But nothing about any of that ever made an ounce of sense to me, and I refuse to ever watch it again, so if it doesn't make sense just pretend it does and never tell me otherwise.  <3
“I know,”  He shifts his body slightly, turning toward me to lie on his side, but still peering up at my face.  He smooths his palm over my stomach—just below my waistline. My heart races dangerously—entire body tensing, skin buzzing as my erection continues to fill, straining against the bloody tight jeans that now define my wardrobe.  Just like that, then? He’s ready to dive head first into this uncharted realm of our relationship that he’s been so apprehensive about? He holds my gaze, watching my reactions as he slowly undoes the button and begins to slide down the zip—I swallow, mind frantically trying to catch up with what’s happening—what’s
My eyes fly open abruptly as John climbs on top of me—his favourite way to wake me when he’s excited about something—or when he wants to get laid.  I squint up at him, the morning light accosting my eyes. He’s beaming down at me, straddling my hips, hands firmly planted on my chest.
Molly hasn’t seen him at all.
Carefully, he begins to move his hips.  A deliberate, lingering grind against my own.  Shallow, delayed thrusts. It’s
John is pulled from his reverie when Sherlock shifts, dislodging his hand from where it still rests on the back of his neck and turning to face him.  He immediately moves closer, dropping his head and tucking his face into the crook of John’s shoulder, sighing dramatically.
“No,” He laughs, hurrying to elaborate.  “I mean—no, I don’t bloody understand—I never have, Sherlock.  I never thought this was even on the table,” He deliberately leans further into Sherlock’s body where they’re pressed so close together.  Squeezes Sherlock’s ankle where his palm now rests.  “I’ve been waiting for you to speak up.  You’ve surprised me, these last few weeks.”
“Do you know, John, that from the very start, you’ve always surprised me?”  His voice is low, private.  A secret.  John looks at him, thinks this over.
“I’m sorry,”  John blurts, before he can stop himself.  He can’t have this conversation again, especially not now that his defenses have crumbled—not now that he’s experienced a version of Sherlock that is comfortable being close to him.  It was too painful the first time they’d gone through it, and it had taken John nearly a year to get back to this point—for things to be
“A gift, obviously,”  She nods at John and Greg raises his brows but hands it to the man, who looks more exhausted with each second he remains trapped in their entryway.  “You don’t need to—just open it at home, John.  And I—I’m sorry if I—well, Happy Christmas, anyway,”  She leans in to kiss his cheek—tries not to react when he flinches slightly, then steps away from the door.
I sip the baiju, neat, that I’ve ordered from the overly friendly barman.  John has been talked into trying one of their house cocktails. His face scrunches up when he tries it, “Bit sweet, that,” but he drinks it anyway.  Of course he does.

A variety of material—remnants of fabric (both natural and synthetic), clear human remains, as well as something (leather?) that seems to have curled up and shrunk down, but not quite disappeared.  Lestrade mentioned they’d taken some jewelry found within the pile of ash to the lab—along with her remaining foot—to run tests.
When he wakes, hours later, John is gone.
“Your fault,” He whispers back, tilting his head up to meet Sherlock’s eyes and grinning helplessly at what he sees there.  That playful glint is something John has rarely seen directed at him in recent years.  At some point it had been replaced by barely concealed uncertainty, carefully guarded doubt—and probably a bit of boredom.
Something
Sobbing, now.  Folded up and chest heaving.  John hasn’t tried to console me, but he hasn’t moved his hand.
to die.”
Sherlock’s lips are so soft, so careful against his own.  His tremulous breaths spill secrets he’s not yet dared to speak aloud.  His delicate fingers loosen their grip on John’s shirt and make their way to his cheeks, cradling his face as he moves in again, seeking out John’s willing mouth.
I move to the couch and sink down into it.  He hesitates, then sits down beside me. “How long?” I breathe.  I know that it’s not something one can accurately predict. I know that he doesn’t have an answer.
“Ask away,” he smiles warmly, encouragingly.  Greg
“No?  Had you two split, then?  I hadn’t heard,” Lestrade says distractedly, glancing around as Donovan strides toward us.
“Daddy, did you know that the bath is
My most prominent thought as I glance around the room is that I cannot see John in this place at all.  I see none of his abundant compassion in these beige walls or faux wood floors. The stiff grey couch and the wallpaper behind it speak not of the man at my side.  Neither the armchair in the corner nor the rug on the floor show an ounce of his warmth.

“Don’t mind Adam,” The shorter of the two says, rolling his eyes.  “He’s bitter that our other friends bailed. They said they refuse to celebrate a country that they’re embarrassed to live in,”  Ah. “I’m Danny.”
“Not yet.”
“Eat,” My mother says sharply, as she slams a plate of scones down in front of me.  “Look at you, you’re just like your father. A bloody walking tree branch.”
He gives me one more long look, searching, reassuring.  Presses his mouth to my throat, slides a hand up to grip my shoulder, and pushes—slowly,
Writing sex scenes from inside Sherlock's mind is such a damn challenge.  I cannot accept that he would
Sherlock waits.  Presses his mouth to John’s shoulder and waits, as he gradually sinks back down.
He unlaces our fingers, lays my hand palm-up on his thigh.  “You’re talking about yourself,” Looking down, he traces shapes on my palm with the pads of his fingers.  “You mean that I couldn’t see who you really were either, before.” I say nothing, watching the movement of his fingertips on my skin.  “You’re right about that. I like to think I saw more than most. But I never could have imagined this.” He looks up at me then.
He would love to put this entire mess on the smirking, smug, ugly idiot leaning back with arms crossed on the other end of their table in this bustling bloody pub.
John is perched on the couch, video chatting with Rosie.  I hear their cheerful voices and mingled laughter as I prepare breakfast, smiling to myself each time they burst into giggles.  We woke up this morning tangled up in each other, having fallen asleep curled up together and holding on tight. His words have been rattling around my brain since the moment they slipped from his lips—causing scattered dreams of our mouths meeting at last—of my hands against his skin—and waking thoughts of what comes next.
He sighs.  “The man in the bag.  He was MI6. We suspect he was involved in some questionable activity, drawing the attention of foreign agencies.  It seems that he was approached--asked to become a double agent. He refused, and he ended up padlocked in a bag,” He pauses, looks down his nose at me.  “You wouldn’t have found anything, because there is nothing to find. All that would come of your involvement in this case, would be you landing yourself in a bag of your own.”
He shrugs one shoulder.  “You don’t have to say anything.  We can talk about it when you’re ready to,” A pause.  “I see Ella today, at eleven. You could come, make an appointment with someone,” Therapy?  Not my area. Telling my secrets to a stranger in a room with white walls. Could I do that?  “I could have her recommend someone for you. She knows all about you, obviously,” A thoughtful pause.  “This will be our first session since your return, though. Should be interesting.”
“This is the best thing you’ve ever done,”  He grins.  “But yeah, I’m going.  Keep in touch—I mean it, Harry.  Come visit us in London in a couple months.  It’ll be spring by the time you’re out of here so you won’t have to freeze your arse off on the sofa.”
John holds his breath.  He’d gone into this conversation planning to be bold—for once in his bloody life—and to learn where he stands.  But he still feels like his heart might stop dead in his chest.
If John can set aside his hang-ups for this case, then I can certainly try as well.  I am adept at playing a role, after all—and that’s all this is, in the end.
“These things take—time.  How long have you—”
“I didn’t know,”  He breathes, a plume of fog slipping from his lips and disappearing into the air between them.  “Sherlock, if I’d thought for a second that you—that we—things would have been—”
“You’re a soldier, what’s the difference?” At this, John’s head snaps up, eyes boring through Ajay with an intensity few witness in a lifetime.  He opens his mouth to speak, then abruptly turns around, walks straight out the door and slams it shut with a thunderous crack, the sound reverberating through the room leaving Ajay looking stunned.
“You don’t mind?”
“No, I—”
“Got a bit carried away,” Molly laughs, picking up some sort of furry creature clearly made by Rosie and handing it to me.  “She’s very creative, you know,” This is directed at John, who grins.
“You’re perceptive, for an idiot,” Reads me like a book, more like.  I’ve been rapidly preparing apologies and wondering if I’d gone too far without asking permission.
Actually happy.  Bloody euphoric, just standing here making tea.  They’re about to sit down and attempt to outline their blooming relationship—a conversation he’s never really had with anyone.  Not even his spurious wife.  This thing between them should be acknowledged as the rare and precious gift that it is.
on Sherlock—”  John nods, head dropping slightly.  Mycroft sighs. “Stay together, whatever you do.  There is—someone—” A pause. He glances at me, before returning his eyes to John.  “A possible source of information. I’ll look into it and be in touch,” Another nod from John.  What is this, then? It’s like they’re having an entirely separate conversation— a secret language that I’m not privy to.  He’s given me
The shower feels incredible.  We stand together under the hot cascade, letting it wash away all lingering remnants of our lust.  Muscles melt under heat and John’s hands. Our mouths meet, fingers firmly roam, as we wordlessly bask in each other’s proximity.

Sighing, he drags himself from chair to uncomfortable bloody couch, layering Harry’s plaid blanket on top of his grandmother’s old quilt and settling in for a few hours of restless slumber.  Not a minute has passed when his mobile vibrates on the cushion just beside his head.
are crossed, and it’s all been made official at last.
When we land at San Francisco International at nine o’clock the next morning, we’re immediately ushered into a sleek black car.  I half expect to find my meddlesome brother inside, waiting to whisk us away, back to London where we belong. But when we climb in, we’re alone—the driver hidden away behind a partition.  John and I exchange a look, his eyebrows raised.
Sherlock is silent, as John knew he would be, for nearly ten minutes before the three little dots appear on the screen.  He’s been thinking about this all evening, since his botched conversation with Harry at dinner.  He’s been thinking about Clara and how complicated relationships can be and how little he and Sherlock actually know about each others’ pasts.  Sherlock couldn’t have deduced that John spent eleven really quite pleasant months in uni with a girl he’d thought he’d marry someday.  Or that three years later he’d fallen so hard for his superior officer that he’d begun to question everything he'd ever thought to be true about himself.  There was so much between them—a deep, hard-earned trust and a bond forged by shared traumas and tragedies.  The transition had been natural and easy and had lasted longer than any of John’s other attempts at love.
They’ve hardly a need to speak at all anymore, as in sync as they’ve become.  Their life has become a practiced dance.  The most interesting thing that’s happened in months was Sherlock stabbing him in the side with his toes.  And, incidentally, what followed had been the most physical contact John has had with an adult member of the human race in, well, years.  Nearly four years, if we’re being honest—
“What’s on your mind, exactly?” He opts for a direct approach, watching as Sherlock sighs, setting the barely-touched tea back down and moving to lean against the worktop beside him. His eyes roam over the home that’s slowly becoming very much
“Ah—nope,” John chimes in.  “What is that, then—Thursday?  We’ve got nothing on,” He glances back at me for confirmation.  Obviously we’ve got nothing on. We hardly know what we’re even doing here.  I nod. Ben grins.
Where?  A new flat?  Is it nearby?”
Ruth remembers Linda Elizabeth Murphy as a bright and welcome presence in her life.  A beautiful young woman with a wide smile and impeccable taste in fashion. She and Kenneth met at a church picnic, and he was positively smitten from that day forward.  Ruth watched from the sidelines as they dated, fell in love. Linda treated her as a sister—took her shopping, to the cinema. Gave her friendship, warmth—and hope. Something she'd been lacking.
Sherlock studies the first—a simple white envelope, all business, no frills.  Lined with a standard blue security pattern that can be glimpsed through the thin white paper.  John can see the moment he deduces what’s inside.

We eat.  The atmosphere remains lively, everyone chatting animatedly and shouting across the table to pass the potatoes.  It’s mesmerising. I look around at the people I’ve chosen as my family (and one who was assigned at birth) and think that my life feels full, nearly completely whole.  When my eyes land on my brother, sitting on my left, he’s watching me. The look in his eyes and the slight smile on his face say
Mr. and Mrs. Holmes arrive just after lunch.  Rosie is elated to see them, and even more so when they shower her with another flood of presents.

No, there is not an ounce of my John in these cookie cutter walls.  This is, in fact, the cheap facade of a woman trying to hide behind a half-formed persona and an unassuming life.  Desperately aspiring to be forgettable. Maybe we’ll find something here after all.
We rub up against one another, an unhurried, languid hump.  My hands roam as my pelvis rocks, each small thrust planting a bloom of heat within my gut.  Sprouting and growing, vining ever upward to snake around my ribcage and suffocate my heart.
“You thought that you’d make a decision like this without asking how I felt about it?  I know that you don’t—you don’t
“You know my name.  How?” Ajay directs this question at me.
I wake up to an empty bed.  A rare occurrence—John is nearly always there.  Thrown off by his absence, I rise, grabbing a dressing gown on my way out the door.  The flat smells of coffee and bacon, and I find John standing in front of the stove, scrambling eggs in a frying pan.  I walk up behind him and envelop him in my arms. “Hi,” He says, leaning back against my chest as I press my lips to his temple.

He pulls away, slowly, his warm hands on my forearms now.  Stares. He's doubting his own sense of reality. I don't know how to make this more real, John, for either of us.
His half-hearted attempts at convincing John to accompany him to dinner tonight were met with extreme skepticism and a firm denial.  And now, Chinese.
"Where is it?"
“It’s—I regret that I ever said it,”  I try to ignore the sinking feeling in my gut and my heart trying to break free from my ribcage.  I feel raw, and a bit lost. He shakes his head, looks down.
“Just under a year,”  Just after they’d lost her.  John watches Sherlock instantly do the mental math, his face a complicated mixture of grief and affection.  “I’d wanted to—you know.  Memorialize her—somehow.  For you.  And I thought—well in the end, it was your idea, really.  Even if you didn’t know what I’d been up to.  When you told me your plans for Baker Street it just—”  Sherlock has turned his head away, staring off at the fading fire in the grate.  “—clicked.  Sherlock,”  John reaches for his wrist.  Feels a racing heartbeat beneath his fingertips.
“You haven’t—”  Fingertips placed gently on John’s jaw guide him to meet Sherlock’s eyes at last.  He sighs, seeing immense concern in those sharp grey orbs.  “You haven’t failed, Sherlock.  You haven’t failed us in any way.  This is—me.  This is one of the lovely lasting effects of trauma.  We’ve talked about it, you know that it’s never going to leave me entirely.  I’ve forgiven you, and I don’t really even think about it anymore—but the fact that you’d gone and planned all of this without involving me at all—”  He pauses, trying his damndest not to sound accusatory.  “Irrational as it may be, it hadn’t even occurred to me that you were trying to plan a future for us.  I thought that you were going off on your own because you felt that you had to,”  John swallows, hoping that this explanation isn’t cruel.  “Again.”
Ben had said, the night we met.  It’s hard to believe that we’ve only been here for one week.  John and I have come so far.
“Petting my hair.  You like this.” I roll onto my back, look up at him.  His fingers continue to pull gently through curls.

It’s now approaching four o’clock and John is perusing my emails for a good case, while I roam around the house anxiously.  Unsure what’s got me so on edge, I lie down on the couch and assume my thinking position. Once upon a time I’d be abusing nicotine patches and shooting the walls while I’m in this state.  Now I just flutter from couch to kitchen, chair to bedroom, driving John mad with my restlessness.
When John looks up at him, something unmistakable passes between them.  An acknowledgement, he thinks, that things could change between them—
“And to lunch?”  She asks, turning—distracted—as Molly appears at her side.
A proper date.  An overpriced, candlelit, intimate and undeniable date.  And a do-over, he’d supposed.  A new, positive memory to attach to the tops of tall buildings, hopefully overwriting the old.  Just the two of them on top of the world, with nowhere to hide from whatever it is that’s between them.
“No word from my men on the scene.  Local police should be arriving shortly, and I’ve dispatched a team as well.  Did you see anything?”

how I just took you apart.”
She had gotten into the second car and taken off in the other direction, while the first went back the way we’d come.  A solid enough plan, when dealing with idiots. These men have the means to do whatever is necessary to take her down, and yet they’ve resorted to following her in circles and being fooled by the oldest trick in the book.  No doubt, she has shown her superior intellect over the last two years—made it clear that she’s got some sort of failsafe in place. It’s why they went after Isla—her lover, her heart—and continue to keep their distance. They’re playing the long game.
I’m sorry (I’m not actually, at all).  Have just accepted that they can’t take their hands off each other and have used it as an opportunity to practice writing about sex in a candid way while trying to maintain the emotion.  Did I succeed?  No idea.  Didn’t plan for three chapters of smut in a row but here we are.
“It’s fine, Sherlock.  All fine. I didn’t mean to send you spiraling into the abyss,” Evidently my thoughts are--yet again--plastered across my face for John to read freely.  He sighs. “I need to be better about keeping my head in the present. I have everything I’ve ever bloody wanted and I keep bringing up useless details from the past.”
Before she has a chance to think it through, Molly has taken the few steps toward him, wrapped her arms around his middle and squeezed.  All of the guilt she’s been able to suppress for all this time is now bubbling unbidden to the surface when confronted with this miserable man.  She could tell him.  She could just
I’ve made no progress in two days, and I’m beginning to wonder if this is entirely hopeless after all.  What was I thinking, taking a case with no data? No defined crime? I suppose my sole thought on the matter was that I’d like to get out of London—preferably with John at my side.  Mission accomplished—but I hadn’t planned on having no useful information to speak of, a week into the trip. All we’ve got to show for our time here is a test tube of psychedelic coffee and an insufferable bloody narcissist who won’t stop texting me.
John allows himself to be menouvred toward the bed, lets Sherlock push him down to sit on the edge and says nothing at all when he crawls across the duvet to sit cross-legged behind him.  John’s slightly tan and firmly muscled arms break out in gooseflesh the moment Sherlock’s hands dig tenderly into the space between his shoulder blades.
This was going to be longer / more elaborate but I decided to switch POVs and continue on in the next chapter!  So here's a bit of a short, rambly one.  (:

“You’ve gone and found yourself a proper laboratory,”  He breathes, his grin growing painfully wide as he takes it all in.  “This is incredible, Sherlock, really,”  He tightens his grip on Sherlock’s hand, feeling that familiar wave of affection and gratitude so often triggered by the man’s actions these days.  While this is surely in part a selfish endeavor, it is also a secluded space where Sherlock can do whatever he damn well pleases—stockpile this very
John cries out when he comes, shouting my name, and we fall forward into the soft linen below.  I’m completely gone—drilling furiously into his body—over and over as I sob and moan against his neck.  He calls out again and again as I hump him forcefully, clinging to him tightly as I drown in a sea of lust and lechery.  I feel the pleasure building dangerously with each wild thrust—and when my body goes still, my cries echo through our room as I violently erupt deep inside him.  My hips slam upward once, twice, again, again—emptying me out, filling him up. I melt into him completely, covering his body where he lies beneath me—and we slowly sink into a deadened daze.
“No, Harry.”
I groan.  Henry wasn’t lying when he’d referred to Hal as
“As if I have a choice!”  He shouts, jumping abruptly to his feet.  I feel John stand up straighter, shifting forward slightly, ready to defend me if it comes to that.  “I wish I had never met him, but here we are,” He throws his hands carelessly up in the air, lets them fall to his sides.  “He isn’t someone you say no to. He—” He cuts himself off, eyes darting between John and I. “I’m fucked now, though,” Panic in his eyes.  “You were supposed to drink it.
Molly hisses, shoving him none-too-gently through the door.  “Rosie is right there.”
John had stepped into his own room several times throughout the day, circling the empty space but always coming up short on ways to fill it.  He had left his old bed at Baker Street.  He isn’t sure what sleeping arrangements they’ll decide on for the future—it’s really up to Sherlock whether they retain their own space or share one—but either way, John wants a new bed.
“I didn’t spend a penny,” She says quickly.  “Just open it.”
“Well actually,” John closes the laptop and sets it aside.  “Greg mentioned he might have something for you. A new one that’s got them stumped.  He can tell you about it tonight.”
He hisses, meeting her eye for a fleeting moment, then staring determinedly back at the wall, brown furrowed.  Upset with himself for responding at all, then.

A long pause. “I wasn’t, actually,” At this, he rolls over in my arms.  Places a hand right over my thundering heart and peers up at me. “Sherlock, tell me what you want.  What you want this to be.” This impossible question again.
Now John breathes quietly beside him, his face
The cab stops outside a small restaurant and John disappears inside.  He emerges a few minutes later with three steaming boxes of Thai. All my favourites.  He must’ve ordered on his phone at some point—thoughtful, as ever. I haven’t eaten in days.
When I walk into the flat, Mycroft stands immediately.  Nods, solemnly. Something--off--about this.
Sherlock wants to turn his body, to curl into John, to pull him close, closer.  To bury his face in the dip of his neck and breathe and breathe.
“Oh?  What
Ah, piss.  He’s forgotten to follow up with that witness in the bloody Bigsby case.  The oldendayser.  What was his name—Wilson?  Williams?  Greg shuffles papers around on his desk in search of the right case file.  Christ, he’s behind.  Absolutely overwhelmed, and he barely slept last night.  He glances at his watch.  Only half six—perhaps he should have another coffee.  This job has gotten a lot more difficult since Sherlock bloody Holmes decided to leap off of a goddamn rooftop—he can’t remember a time when he had to work this hard just to barely stay afloat.
“Mycroft,” I snarl.  “Does Lestrade require anything from you?”
John is wrapped around my side, warm and snug, gently brushing through my curls with his fingers.  I feel his breath on my neck, his head on my shoulder.
“John,” I watch him slowly crawl out of the daze he’s been in for the last hour—head almost literally in the clouds.  He turns to look at me, giving me a quick smile.
I drop my luggage on the floor in the tiny bedroom, too exhausted to deal with it just yet.  Pull off my jacket and toss it on the pile. Kick off my shoes and lie back on the bed. The windows are open, a light breeze blowing cool air into the room.  I ponder the journey we’ve just taken. So far from home, so out of our element. What will come next? I think of John, following me here blindly. Willing to put his life on hold for this.  Will it be worth it? What’s in it for him, really? Financial gain, I suppose. But I know that isn’t why he’s here.
I rise from the booth, throwing a fiver on the table to cover the tea I haven’t touched, when the door clangs open, and there he stands.  Our eyes meet, and after a moment of hesitation, he marches across the restaurant.
Dr. Joel Fleischman is from Northern Exposure (a brilliant american show from the 90s that I grew up with and is forever ingrained in my brain) and is also Sherlock's therapist in one of my other stories.  He's a cute New York Jew who spent some time in Alaska.  It doesn't make sense to throw him into this world, but he's who I pictured sitting across from Sherlock in a leather wingback, helping him through life's mysteries (and John's) so here we are.  <3
He gives me a long look, then sighs, drops his head.  “Sherlock,” Looks back up at me. “You’re not going to lose me.  And are things really any different than they were before?” His eyes are fierce, willing me to listen.   I hear you, John. “I
“Neither do I,”  He whispers—because he knows what Sherlock means.  He isn’t speaking of physical inexperience (although that seems to be true as well)—neither of them quite know how to navigate this uncharted realm.  It’s never

“Nice to have options, is all.  Suppose you could just go in your pants,”  He retreats back to the bedroom to finish packing.  I swallow, mind now filled with anxiety over the eventual inevitability of stripping down to my pants in front of John.  I want him to see me—want him to see
and rearranging my things into utter chaos.  It gets stuck in my head constantly.  You’re infuriatingly difficult to ignore.”
I’m pulled back to the present by John’s hand on my back.  I’m standing at the worktop, knife in hand, half-chopped parsnips in front of me.  I glance over at him and smile. He’s wearing a bright red apron—God only knows where that came from—and he looks like a picture of cosy domesticity.
“Idiot,”  I scowl. If this is the reason he’d rejected my many invitations, then he really is an imbecile.  If he’d only listened to my reasoning, they could have been here with me all these years. “There has never been a time when I didn’t want you here,”  In fact, it’s continued to be nearly unbearable, living here without him—to watch the two of them walk out the door each night, headed for their own home.  After all these years, I still miss them fiercely once they go. I grab his wrist, look at him intently, try to convey everything that I don’t have the words for yet.  “Just come back, John.”
The next room they attempt to explore is the second-floor loo, and they are immediately pushed back out the door by their full-bladdered progeny.  Now they lean side by side against the wall, staring out over the banister at the spectrum of light shining through stained glass windows, dousing the whole cottage in luminous colour as the sun begins to set.
It feels like relief, lying here with him.  Immense relief and a temporary tonic for our seemingly immutable doubt.
dog.”
“Really?  You think someone drugged her?”
Another nod.  “Any guesses on what’s going on there?”
“Bastard,”  John says to the empty room, grin still firmly in place.  He turns, meaning to head back out and find the man in question, when his gaze halts on what appears to be a small, modern safe on the wall beside the door.  Curious, he tugs on the handle, surprised when it swings open.  A gun safe—meant to hold a single firearm.  Unbelievable.  Sherlock must have had it installed, solving yet another conundrum John has been ignoring for far too long.  He’s been making do with the top shelf of his wardrobe since Rosie came into the picture, unwilling to keep his Sig downstairs while they sleep.  He’s known it was a temporary solution, not a viable option as Rosie grows.  Apparently, Sherlock has thought of everything.
“Who’re you texting?”  John jumps, glancing up at his wreck of a sister where she sits in a wobbly wooden chair, sprained and swollen ankle propped up on its neighbor.  She’s scowling at him outright, not bothering to hide her displeasure at his presence.
I’ve considered her
The day has gotten away from us--it’s nearly six.  We skipped lunch, John is ravenous, and we’ve got nothing in.  He’s still stomping around the kitchen, slamming cupboard doors when I suggest we go out.
“Good,” I look down at him now--study this face that I love and think of how far he’s come, how much he’s grown.  Feeling hopeful, I smile. “It’ll be good.”
to die.  That he did it to spare
I consider informing the local police that we’ve found a current address.  We aren’t armed, and if we find Jones, we’ll be taking a considerable risk by confronting him.  I dismiss the idea quickly, however--he’ll surely run. They’ll come rolling in, sirens blaring.  He’ll be warned by his mates and we’ll lose the man for good. We have one chance to catch the idiot before he skips town, and we’re going to take it.  We’ll just have to keep our guard up.
so much before—not even close.  There’s never been so much at stake, for either of them.  John stares up into mesmeric eyes, tears making their escape at last, tracing a crooked path across his cheeks.  “Just—”  He reaches up, taking Sherlock’s face in his hands.  “Come here,”  He allows John to pull him downward, collapsing against his chest.
“You know what it is, then?”  He begins to carefully unwrap the package, setting the paper on the worktop.  I nod. I thought my brother might take it upon himself to do this. Surprised that it took him this long, really.  John holds in his hands a black plastic box. “Oh, God. Wow, Mycroft,” He breathes—unlatches it and flips open the lid.  Inside is a Sig Sauer P226—John’s gun. But this one has never seen the bottom of a lake. The box also contains all necessary certifications for him to legally own the firearm.  I’m not convinced that having a record of ownership is the best idea for us, but I suppose Mycroft is thinking of a time when he’ll no longer be there to bail us out. My heart sinks, a bit.  Mrs. Hudson once said that her sister is a pain in her arse, but she’ll miss her when she’s gone. I know that will be true for me as well. I’ve grown to care for my brother.
“But--I didn't want to say--John?  She’s dead?”
“I thought it would be nice,” Mummy says in a pale impersonation of innocence as she sets a plate in front of John.  “All of us together.”
"John," I begin.  It feels important, to say his name.  "I'm sorry." He just continues to stare.  I hope he can hear me. I hope I can get through.  "He was going to kill you," I blurt it out quickly.  It sounds more like a sob than coherent speech. I didn't prepare any words.  I should have. "You, Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson. He was going to kill you all unless I jumped."  The words feel weak. They hold no weight here; too much time has passed. John’s eyes are wide, but he says nothing.  I tell him about the snipers, Moriarty's final words, the way he shook my hand and then blew himself away. I tell him I spent all this time picking apart his bloody network.  Tearing down the spider's web one strand at a time. I don't tell him where I've been. I don't tell him how I've changed. "I've missed you."
“Live here, John.  Come back,” This comes out low, hesitant.  I’m expecting the worst.
The flurry of emotion that plays over his face would be comical if it weren’t so thoroughly heartbreaking.  Mycroft is not without compassion—sentiment may not be his area of expertise, but he can appreciate the magnitude of this loss for a man like John Watson, who wears his heart on his proverbial sleeve.  He watches John swallow several times in a clear attempt to rein in his emotions and get control of his voice before speaking.
and gone back to him,”  She never did meet Mary.  She’d have hated her, too.
“Lovely,”  John says, a bit exasperated but fighting a smile.  It is quite...striking.  The vibrancy brings out the inlaid squares and floral carvings, standing out boldly against the dark stone wall.  No doubt Rosie loves it, and if he’s honest, it rather suits the three of them better than the sad, faded blue that lies underneath.  It’ll serve as a warning for anyone who pays them a visit:
By the time Christmas Eve is upon them, John is nearly giddy with eagerness at finally being allowed to give Sherlock the gift he’s been plotting, in secret, for bloody
we go back ages—met him in London through Jim.  He supplied me with certain—substances,” She pauses.  Glances at John, then back to meet my eye. “The very substances I used to incapacitate you, once upon a time.  You remember,” Vague memories of waking disoriented, in my own bed, flicker across my mind’s eye. Calling out for John.  She’d injected me with something—apparently the creation of a young Silas Moran—and made her escape. “He was only a student then—bright eyed and eager to impress.  He’d quickly caught Jim’s eye—in more ways than one. They were a precious little pair, for a while. I was unaware of the changes Jim had inspired in him. Though I shouldn’t have been surprised,”  She sighs, glances down at the floor. Crosses one ankle in front of the other. “I was playing for the wrong side,” At this, she looks up, meets my eye. Regret swims, unconcealed, in the bright grey pools of her irises.
“You’re awfully bossy,” John replies, but doesn’t stop.  His warm, solid palm travels over Sherlock’s back, up his neck and into his curls, then back down again.  Sherlock tries not to visibly melt, fairly certain he’s failed when he wraps both arms around John’s waist and leans into him completely.  He’s allowed this, now.  Even in public, evidently.  John has been much less concerned with personal space since he’s returned home.  They hug, sometimes, though until tonight Sherlock has always let John be the one to initiate contact.  They sit closer than they’d ever done before, preferring the sofa to their chairs so that they can lean on one another.  They don’t discuss it, obviously.  It’s fine.  This is just how it is, now.  This is simply how they communicate to one another that they’d rather never again be apart.
John glances around the garden and spots Rosie, who has drifted over to a small wooden greenhouse that appears to have been constructed from a hodgepodge of old windows.  There are flowers
“Oh—uh, what’s it been, eleven years?”  He meets my eyes again. Another plea.
is what he’d said.
I wake up in a bit of a daze, face tucked beneath John’s chin.   Must have drifted off quickly. I press my lips to his skin before rolling over, squinting against the sun that still shines through the windows in our room.  I had heard the tell-tale ping of my mobile—I’m certain that’s what woke me. Leaning over the side of the bed, I dig it out of my jeans pocket. One new text message from the very same number that had welcomed us to California one week ago.
“Why do you ask that?”  I know why she asked.
The week seems to roll by on a wave of tinsel and laughter and holiday movies on the telly and late-night gift wrapping and homemade sweets.  Not to mention a rather memorable case involving a spouse-killer they’d tracked down, only to find him dead of exposure in his own back garden.  John had chosen to title it
“John.  Have a seat,”  He gestures unnecessarily at the chairs facing his desk.  John ignores him, glaring intently, expression expectant.  Greg sighs.  “Did I know
"We?"
We move together—familiar friction—under blue linen.  We come together—with quiet moans, muffled by each other’s skin.  We hold one another—comfortable, content. And when at last I pull back to look at him, his cheeks are wet with silent tears, but he’s beaming back at me.  Oh, John.
“Nothing to concern yourself with, Mummy.  Sherlock’s just asked me for a
He roars, chest heaving as he seems to struggle to breathe.  Mycroft is more than a bit taken aback by this sudden outburst.  He takes a moment to school his features, to bury the surprise that is no doubt currently on display.  Is this not a positive thing?  Should John not be glad to know that Sherlock placed such value on his life?
For a fleeting moment he was certain that Sherlock was going to kiss him.  But this is nice, too.
I take a slight step back, reach down and wrap my fingers around his shaft.  He gasps at the contact, looks up at me with wide eyes as I begin to firmly stroke.
He’s always loved it, since he was young.
John jumps when his mobile vibrates again in his hand.  He’s been staring at the same green square on Harry’s blanket for god knows how long, mind at an absolute standstill, thoughts seemingly suspended in a brain that’s turned to jelly as he tries to wrap his head around what he’s just read and what it means for him.  What it means for them.
“Yes, well,”  I shrug. “I’m not exactly known for subtlety,”  He grins.
But when he sees Sherlock in action as the extraordinary parent and unwaveringly dependable friend that he has become, he could weep with gratitude over being allowed to keep him in his life.  For whatever unfathomable reason, Sherlock had decided that John was worth the trouble of growing up, evolving together and working through their shared demons.  And for that, John regularly counts his lucky stars.
“It hasn’t happened like this before.”
“We’re good,”  John can only smile at her clumsy attempts at sisterly concern.  “We’re—impossibly—good,”  She smirks, turning on her seat to face him.
Not much, as it turns out.  Apparently Hal moved to town about two and a half years ago, irking everyone almost immediately with his inflated sense of entitlement and inability to shut up.  He seems to spend his days up in Monte Rio and his nights at the Rainbow, getting sozzled on whiskey. Hugo confirmed that he’s mentioned he’s a chemist—our biggest lead thus far.  He’d also commented on the fact that Henry is not the first
He imagines, now, a long, lean body in front of him.  Can almost feel the line of a bony spine against his chest, the warmth that would radiate from his skin, the slow beat of a living heart.  John thinks of how it would feel to wrap his arms around that slim torso, to run a palm over his pale expanse of stomach, sliding up to rest along a prominent ribcage.  He never did manage to embrace the man—perhaps his greatest regret.  He’s certain, now, that if he had, he wouldn’t have needed to find the words.  Sherlock would have felt it.
John awakens with a start, inhaling deeply and gradually taking in his surroundings.  Still on the couch.  Right.  He hadn’t wanted to wake Sherlock, and clearly he’d eventually surrendered to sleep himself.  He’s slipped down, half lying on his side with his head propped up, both arms wrapped tightly around the too-thin chest of the man he’s effectively spooning.
“I’d also like to tell people we’re together.  What do you think?” I consider the question. I’m not one for formal announcements, but of course I want the people in our lives to know that John and I have finally gotten to this place.  It’s a point of pride, for me.
conversation—and John hasn’t allowed himself to think much about the practicality of it all since.
John peers silently back at me, his face a picture of unconditional acceptance.  He scoots back against the headboard, reaches for my wrist and guides me to lie with my head in his lap, fingers carding gently through my hair.  He looks down at my hesitant face, brushes a curl aside.
“Sorry,”  He mumbles, feeling unbearably awkward.  Sherlock just stares at him, his gaze piercing as ever, as though he can see straight through the ramshackle armour John has slapped over his fractured heart.
Why can’t he just ask if he so desperately wants to know?
Greg Lestrade has entered the chat.
“I know, John.  For me, as well,” John exhales slowly, wanting nothing more than to pull the sentimental sod into his lap and snog him stupid—but they really ought to get through this first.
It’s nearing three o’clock when John grabs my arm and begins to tug me away from the hordes, toward the mostly-dormant gardens that lie on the edge of the village.  He leads the way along winding footpaths, through the barren plant beds, heading straight for a small white shed peeking out near the forest beyond.
And nothing else.  Bit creepy. But we’ve been given a
, and nobody mentions ammo/amo.  Soooo no one has any reason to question any of it and Mary takes the blame to the grave.  Vivian can go on living her life in the cottage she bought with her betrayal.
"What life?  I've been away."  More snark. A confidence I don’t feel.  Something brewing in my gut, now. Dread?  "Where's he going to be tonight?"
“Yes, John.  It’s quite a complicated mess, but my brother did not
He stares up at a water stain on the ceiling, imagines himself up there looking down at the two of them, lying close like this, not speaking, not acknowledging the warmth that begs to flow between them, the fact that this one point of contact—shoulder to shoulder—isn’t really enough.
John is staring into a vast expanse of water, as I was a moment ago.  Eyes cast out toward the boats on the lake. People going about their lives, unaware that I'm about to shatter his.  Letting the days go by. He's about nine meters in front of me, sitting still and silent. I wonder what he's thinking.  I wonder how he's spent these years. Has he thought of me, much? Has he clung to our connection, as I have? Likely not.  To him, I am dead. Unreachable, in a rather permanent way. I am not incapable of empathy; threw out the notion of sociopathy long ago.  And I've thought about how I'd feel if he'd been the one to leave this world. I'd be lost. Is he lost?
He’d gone completely silent late yesterday morning after the admission that there was a letter.  John had assumed he’d regretted confessing that he’d done something so bloody sentimental and that perhaps John was pushing him a bit too hard to talk.  He’d sent out a few more (casual) texts throughout the day and received no response, so he’d let it be.
John tightens his grip, stroking downward with each of Sherlock's increasingly desperate thrusts, slides his other hand up to grip his shoulder, seeking whatever leverage he can manage.  He slams his hips upward, twisting his fingers and holding on, watching the unearthly moment that Sherlock comes entirely undone.  Throwing his head back and arching forward, long fingers gripping convulsively against John’s neck, Sherlock comes with a stunned, shuddering gasp.  John is dazed, breathless as the body around him tenses, all space left between them evaporating in an instant, contracting and pulling him quickly to his own euphoric end.  Burying his face against warm, salty skin, John muffles the startled shout that escapes him, feeling it turn immediately into a sob as he clutches and clings to the man still trembling in his arms.
anyone.  But my heart—and the rest of my body—only wanted to make up for lost time.  Wanted to show him exactly how much he is loved. So I let him have me.
“Molly,”  He nods, trying for a smile.  She swallows.  He’s nearly unrecognizable.  She’d heard he’d grown a beard and has clearly kept it for all these months.  It’s grown in—thick and full and fairly long, actually, but neatly trimmed.  It suits him, really.  He looks handsome, almost dashing, at first glance.  But upon closer inspection, it seems the beard is only there to mask terribly sunken, weary features—the circles etched under his eyes paint a picture of many sleepless nights.  His face is more sallow and much thinner than she’s ever seen it, and despite the fact that his entire demeanor radiates a deep-seated ennui, something about him looks more youthful, boyish.  Perhaps he simply looks lost.
“Hardly,”  She scoffs, though a sliver of unease shows in her guarded expression.  “I didn’t have a choice, John.”
We wake up abruptly to a piercing beep from the bedside table.  John groans and flops over to slam his hand against the snooze button.  I’ve got my phone out already, tapping away, pulling up the news story on Mary’s death that was planned for release this morning.  John pulls the covers over his head. “Anything interesting?” This comes out as a muffled grumble to my left.
“Can hear you thinking,”  He rumbles, voice deep from sleep, eyes still shut tight.  I grin, slide closer. Press my mouth to his chest, his throat.  Let my tongue linger on the warm skin of his neck, caress his pulse point with my lips.  He loves this. Tips his head back and sighs.
“I’m sorry—I wanted to say—sorry—”  He’s a bit out of breath. “For him.  He’s such an asshole,” He takes a moment to breathe, looking between the two of us.  “Is there any way—I know you don’t really know me—but is there any way I can crash on your couch?”  John and I exchange a confused look. “I live with him,” He shakes his head. “Biggest mistake I ever made.  I can’t stay there tonight.”
I strip down to my pants, John watching me for a moment and then doing the same.  Flip the covers back and crawl into bed, side by side. I slide an arm around his waist, hand flat against his stomach—tug him toward me until he’s spooned against my chest.  Hook my chin over his shoulder and press my lips to his cheek. He sighs.
Molly breaks free of the unpleasant memory to find John staring silently down at the table, seemingly still deciding on how to respond.
, as Mrs. H. would say.
I take his hand, and we walk in silence along the moonlit beach, back to our temporary dwelling.  It seems that everyone has gone to sleep—we enter to find a quiet, empty space. Our bag lies outside of a closed door in the hallway, so we push through to our room.  Modest. Clean. I immediately strip to my pants—all prior insecurities dead and buried—throwing my sandy clothes in a pile on the floor and crawling beneath the green plaid duvet.  John watches me, saying nothing—then, slowly, he does the same.
“Uncertain.”
But instead she just watches him fidgeting on the threshold, eyes surely wide and words snagged painfully in her throat.
“Suppose we owe Molly a thank you card,”  John huffs as they begin to stroll through the empty streets of London toward Baker Street.
"I'll see you again, right?  I'll see you soon?" I'm not going anywhere, John.  Not again. Not ever.
They’d spent the last four days on a particularly gruesome case—a string of murders that left John emotionally exhausted and brought his faith in humanity down to an all time low.  He's still a bit out of sorts today.  Sherlock, however, was as enthusiastic as ever—refusing sleep and sustenance and bouncing off the bloody walls, brilliance seeping from every pore.  He’d solved the case late yesterday afternoon, and they’d gone straight from the Yard to Molly and Greg’s flat to pick up Rosie—then home.
“What’re you going to do with the Baker Street flats?” Greg asks through a mouthful of Som Tum.  John glances at Sherlock, feeling his stomach flutter a bit.  They haven’t talked about this at all—he’s been hesitant to bring it up, knowing full well that it’s a difficult topic.  Trust Greg to toss it out there without a second thought.  Sherlock meets John’s slightly panicked gaze briefly before glaring down at his barely touched Pad Thai.  The air around them grows uncomfortably quiet, and John is about to clumsily change the subject when Sherlock looks at him again and then clears his throat.
Pints in hand, we follow Hal back to what appears to be his regular table, behind the rope.  There’s only one other man there tonight—a thin twenty-something with wavy dark brown hair. I recognize him from yesterday, as he was seated on John’s right, looking just as sullen as he does tonight.
“Irrelevant, John.  She left it to
“Bloody brilliant,” Oh, John.  I’ll never tire of your praises.  I look over my shoulder and we share a grin.
He pulls me closer.  Kisses me quick. “It was
I feel my rhythm begin to falter—nearly there, can’t hold out much longer—John beneath me in a constant breathy moan.  Teeth against his shoulder, bite down (soft, not hard)—still, he tenses, goes rigid, cries out as he comes. His body spasming beneath me, around me.  A new intensity of pressure, inescapable, surrounds me. I gasp, push in hard—
“Okay, yeah,”  He agrees rather quickly, and I wonder if perhaps his doctorly side is concerned for this young person who’s found himself in a questionable situation.  Henry nods his thanks, looking immensely relieved, and the three of us climb into the car.
He says nothing, but stands up straight, follows her to her sorry excuse for a car and gets in.  The drive is blessedly short—ten minutes of uncomfortable quiet, weaving through the nearly empty streets—and once they reach Harry’s flat he walks straight to the sofa and sinks right in.  As she sets the kettle to boil, rummaging through cupboards for some non-caffeinated tea, Harry resolves to make him speak.  She’s been a shit sister these past months—caught up in her own dramas and spending her days at the café trying to make enough bloody money to afford this pitiful flat.  She texts him every now and then, but she’s been stubbornly telling herself that he’s
a man to spare his life almost immediately after.  He’d been stunned, really, that someone had taken to his abrasive brother so easily—tentatively grateful and more than a bit suspicious.  But now, here they are.  It was Sherlock’s turn, apparently, to do the saving.  And the responsibility to preserve the life of his brother’s rescuee falls, predictably, on Mycroft.
I think, pacing the living room floor—as I’ve been doing for the last hour and a half.  Should have brought something—anything—to distract me from this useless bloody case in this boring bloody country.  We’ve been cooped up in the cottage for
“Likely because his name is in it.  Clearly didn’t consider that she may have also written it down—assuming he’s one of the men in her book.”
“What is this, a bloody riddle, Mycroft?  Why are you here?”  He sits up straight now, hands clasped between his knees, clear blue eyes alert, expectant.  “Why are you at my

on the blog.  This had sparked a flood of very rude commentary from Sherlock that had led to him pinned down on the bed with John’s full weight on top of him, silenced with a rather vigorous kiss.  He hadn’t had much to say about mediocre writing abilities and positively hateful puns after that.
“Play with my hair.”
mentioned her, not twenty minutes ago, and he’d be happy to give them a prod in the right direction.
They find themselves blissfully alone once the last of their cheerful guests has shut the door behind them.  Rosie has been fast asleep upstairs for hours, having exhausted herself immediately after dinner.  John sits in his chair, staring at the framed photo that Molly had given him only an hour ago.  He stares at his own face, looking lighter and more free than even he realized he was capable of.  He stares at his daughter, perched between them, a moment of surprised glee frozen forever on her face, wild blonde curls framing that toothy grin.  And Sherlock, who isn’t acknowledging the camera at all.  He’s looking at John, and written in his expression are all the things that John can only hope show through in himself.  He thinks that they do.  After last night, he believes that they do—he believes that Sherlock, at least, can see them.
Sherlock finds himself in a similar state of shock at the implication of John’s words.  “I—“ He sits up, dislodging John but sliding close immediately, hesitating for only a moment before carefully taking his hand.
“Hi,” He almost whispers, clearing his throat and setting both mugs on the bedside table beside the digital alarm clock he’d bought Sherlock in their previous life together.  He’s already made up his mind to be bold, so he hesitates for only a moment before slipping beneath the duvet and resuming his spot at Sherlock’s side.
“I’m hesitant to answer that, John.”
comes to mind.
“So that’s what we’ll do then.  Protect each other. But Sherlock,” His voice is serious now.  Wants to be heard. “If you need to leave again, take me with you.”
Rosie, John.  She’s a child, she’ll adapt,”  John can no longer tamp down the frustration that’s been building, churning, rolling wildly in his gut.  Does he actually believe that having her own bloody room will make up for the absence of one of the people she loves most in the world?  He finds himself shoving the chair back and standing, fists clenched tightly at his sides.  He’s falling into old habits—mustn’t overreact—mustn’t walk away.
We stop for a late lunch at a small café, sharing a bacon and brie toastie and a bowl of Welsh cawl.  We come across a man playing a melancholy tune on his violin, and I feel a sharp pang of regret that I’ve yet to pick up mine.  We listen until the song is finished, nod in appreciation. We leave him a tenner in the open case at his feet and carry on down the pavement, hand in hand.
“So have I,”  John whispers, fighting the persistent prickle of tears.  “I love you,”  He watches as something shifts in Sherlock’s eyes, a spark of determination abruptly making itself known.  And he’s surprised, then, when he finds himself lying flat on his back, Sherlock hovering over him, two bony knees straddling his thighs.
“Thank you,”  I respond. “For everything,”  She knows what I mean. She knows the role that she played in preserving John’s life and allowing me to disappear when I needed to.  A true friend and ally, and I’d likely have none of this without her. We share a final smile before she flounces out the door, dragging Tom along behind her.
“I did consider it,”  He responds, scooping Rosie up and dropping her on the bed.  “But it wouldn’t have had quite the right bounce,”  She takes that statement as the invitation it is and jumps around, holding onto both of Sherlock’s hands—both of them giggling like fools.
He flips me over suddenly, unceremoniously.  Slides right up behind, chest to my back, erection hot and heavy against my cheeks.  My breathing is strained, anticipation throbbing through my veins. I can feel him behind me, pulling his pyjamas down around his thighs, his hand sliding along his own shaft, slick with lube.  Preparing. For what, exactly?
than anything)—John has never suggested she refer to him as something else.  He’s thought about it many times, but always ends up assuming Sherlock would be uncomfortable being called
“I only wanted you to see things from her perspective.  I’d hoped you would understand that I do want this—all of it, everything—it was clear to her that I always have.  I
beyond your control,” His palm smoothes firmly across my upper back.  Back, forth. “But you’ll learn to be okay with that—it will just take time to feel safe again.”
He heads for said bar, off to the left.  Not a soul seated on the row of worn leather stools.  No sign of John.  He takes a seat, glancing at his watch.  7:13.  Greg is late.  John is later.
“Grateful, I suppose.  Not sure why she—gave it to me, or—had it in the first place.  But,”  He shrugs.  Doesn’t say another word about it.
“I love you,” He says again, because he does and he can.
“I suppose I—I’m sorry—“  Sherlock’s brow is still charmingly furrowed.  He obviously doesn’t understand this reaction.  John sighs.  “I thought it would be—good.”
10k words!  Thought this entire story would end up being half that.
“And the rest of it?  Everything that romantic relationships generally consist of?  Do you want that?”
that have been rattling around in there since Sherlock’s implausible fall.  He doesn’t force himself to let go of every odd action, every dodged question and vague response that Molly has given him in the year that followed.  He doesn’t brush off Mycroft Holmes’ nearly nonsensical explanations and assurances—the claims that Sherlock did this for them, for him.  For John.
“I was waiting for you,” He breathes, after what feels like an age, against Sherlock’s swollen lips.  His chest rises and falls rapidly.  His palm strokes slowly down Sherlock’s bony spine.  “I never thought—I guess I needed to hear it from you.”
Molly is telling John and Mrs. Hudson about a body that recently came into the morgue, wearing two pairs of pants.  “Just give me one good reason,” Molly breathes out between giggles, “Why a person would need to wear two pairs of pants.”
“No,” I hope this is the answer she’s looking for.  “Ms. Jones—Ruth—my name is Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. John Watson.  We’re detectives, working on a case involving your brother. We could use your help locating him.”
“Sherlock,” A whisper.  He knows I’m awake. Either I’m slipping or he’s getting more observant.  Likely the latter. I hum. “We should get tested,” Oh. Not what I was expecting to wake up to.  He brushes a curl off of my forehead. “There are things I’d like to do—“ His hand slips under my shirt, slides lightly up my chest to tease a nipple.  I moan, quietly. “And we’ve already been a bit reckless,” True enough, although I’m confident that I’m clean, and surely John has been screened recently, responsible doctor that he is.
John thinks.
“You—what?”
He’s giggling now, shaking his head.  “You’re an idiot.” I smirk. An idiot indeed.  My phone rattles dramatically against the metal table.  I swoop it up, put it on speakerphone.
All that aside, John is certain that he'd poured every last bit of adoration he feels for the man into the connection they’d found last night.  But this is new for Sherlock.  Intimacy.  All of it.  Not his area, and all that.
“John!” This comes out as a startled squeak.  “It’s good to see you--yes, yes it’s been far too long.”  John asks what she’s been up to, and when they begin to chat about Molly’s new boyfriend, I take my leave.
“Stop,”  Sherlock holds up a hand, unnecessarily.  That baritone alone will stop John in his tracks—a power John’s own voice seems to have over Sherlock as well, which has proven rather useful.  “John—that isn’t—“  He cuts himself off and sighs, watching John intently.  “I—bought a house.  I wanted to tell you last night.  But instead I—anyway, I’ve purchased a home.”  He rattles this off so quickly, it’s difficult to soak it all in.
"Where is what?"
We part, and I watch him walk away.  He looks back, just a quick glance. Questioning reality, still.  I'm really here, John. Once he's out of sight, I sink back down onto the bench.  My eyes go to the water, barely seeing it, and I sit. Think. Still and silent.
(See the end of the chapter for
Everything about it had felt utterly right.  It had felt simultaneously impossible and long overdue.  It had felt comfortable and nearly petrifying all at once.
Completely last-minute.  He’d gotten the call from her sponsor at four in the morning letting him know that she was being released from hospital but will need further care.  A concussion and a sprained ankle—both the results of an inconvenient seizure.  Withdrawal.  She’s trying to quit on her own again, evidently, without proper detox and rehabilitation.  Another lesson she refuses to learn.  But it could’ve been much, much worse.  Could still
My mind is reeling, body buzzing, as I try to sort through all that I feel.  Overwhelmed and overflowing. Deeply in love with this perfect man. My perfect match.  I let my mind spin out, committing each moment to memory, never to be forgotten—as I sink slowly into a haze of blissful contentment.
Body aching, vibrating with the need to get closer, John finds himself drawn instantly back into Sherlock’s orbit, arms circling his waist as they each melt into this moment—gradually letting one another in as the kiss grows wild, unfettered, Sherlock gasping as he backs toward the bed, dropping down onto charcoal linens and pulling John along with him.  After a moment’s hesitation, John crawls up to straddle lithe, muscular thighs—settling into Sherlock’s lap, twisting fingers into familiar curls and letting himself get lost once more.
I rise from a light doze some time later.  We haven’t moved from our embrace. John is awake, one palm running slowly up and down my spine, the other still holding my body to his.  Comforting. I glance up at him from where my head rests on his chest; his face is contemplative, his mind far away. When our eyes meet, he presses his lips to my forehead.  “Hi,” He breathes. I tighten my arms around his waist.
“Home,” I grab his hand and stride straight into the elevator.  We ride silently down, down, then walk purposefully out the doors to our idling car at the kerb.  “Baker Street,” I say swiftly to the driver, squeezing John’s hand that I’ve yet to let go.
We find Henry in the kitchen, sitting at the table sipping a cup of coffee and scrolling through his phone.
When he wakes for the second time this morning, John finds himself entirely enveloped by two long arms, his own tucked up comfortably between his chest and Sherlock’s.  He’s not sure he’s ever felt quite so small, even after years of Sherlock towering over him—he’s always felt that
“Sherlock,”  My shoe catches on the threshold and I stumble through the door to the flat.  Slide my Belstaff down my arms, down down, to the floor. “Sherlock, you need to go to bed.”  Do I? Maybe I do. “Sherlock.”
“Oh, God, turn that off.  I sound like such a bloody wanker,” John groans as I snap the telly off, smirking back at him.
for Harry, and in the end it was Harry who’d left her behind.
But from the absolute bloody start, John’s instincts have screamed to protect this man at all costs.  To comfort him in whatever way he’ll accept.  To
The white SUV had relented once we’d reached the town centre, no doubt returning to their previous position, awaiting Irene’s departure.  She’s planned for it. There’s another identical black car waiting at our cottage when we arrive.
I do my best to project an aura that clearly says
“This is mad,” We’re perched on plush white seats, each on one side of the aisle, in the private plane that’s supposedly taking us to San Francisco.  John’s got his chair reclined and is sprawled out, staring dazedly out the window at the clouds below. “Completely bloody barmy.” I ignore him, turning the page of the medical text I brought along to entertain myself.
Hearing him voice his love of the work never fails to make my heart go tender, to melt right through the gaps in my ribcage.  I can’t help but think of a time before John, when it was all I had to keep me moving forward. A time when I was alone—despised by those around me—used for my mind and then turned away from once the puzzle was solved.  To have found a man who not only appreciates what I do, but also who am—who is a valuable contribution to the work, and even more so to every other facet of my life—someone I can trust with my heart, trust with everything—”John.”
I smile.
She’d asked for my number (
Eventually, there’s a lull in the conversation, and John looks over at me.
Clothed—obviously—but still.
after all.  I think it’s clear that whatever he’s up to at the Grove has to do with exactly that.  I watch him for a moment, looking lovely as ever behind the wheel as we drive along the coast back to our cottage.  We’d left shortly after breakfast, with thank yous and promises to attend tomorrow evening’s drag show.
failing to grasp, John, is that
“How’ve you been?”  I ask. This something we do now.  Inquire about one another’s wellbeing.
"You always know."
“No,” He says, finally—then stands up and walks right out the door.
“You still may be.  But there is indeed bacon.”  I set a plate down in front of him and move to retrieve the toast.  Pour him a coffee, and we eat.
Wrapping Sherlock up in his arms and settling in for a mid-morning kip, John tucks his face into wayward curls and traces figure eights over the scars on his skin.
Hour after tedious hour of questioning six of the men on her client list, and nothing.  Four of them had alibis—confirmed (eventually) by the Met. Two of them were imbeciles, albeit wealthy ones.  They brought in their lawyers and were quickly released. They didn’t have the competence to pull it off anyway, that was immediately clear.
“All right?”  John mutters from somewhere above Sherlock’s right ear.  He only grumbles in response, turning away from glaring at Anderson to press his forehead more firmly into John’s (warm, safe) chest.  He’s currently hunched over in the booth they’ve been sharing for the duration of this insufferable gathering John has dragged him to (someone’s birthday?—something like that) and he realizes belatedly that one hand is clutching at John’s thigh and the other has wound its way around to grasp at the small of his back.  He must look like a pathetic, clinging child.  He
"All right," I'm sinking.  I don't want to part. I just got you back, John.
She’s unimpressed, determined to push this.  God, he needs another drink.  Draining the last dregs of his pint, John sets the glass on the bar, watching (stalling) as the barman slowly makes his way through the shouted orders of the cluster of Yarders gathered to his right.  The man spots his empty glass, they exchange a nod and a fresh pint appears at John’s elbow.  He turns back to Molly, who’s waiting expectantly for a response.  He lets out a resigned sigh.
When I open my eyes, John has slid off of me, lying pressed against my side.  He’s got his head propped up with one arm, looking down at my chest as he traces a looping figure eight around my nipples.  I shiver, bring my hand up to rub across his back, kneading into muscle as he quietly sighs. “Before you silently work yourself up into a tizzy wondering if you crossed a line, you should know that I
As always, comments are so appreciated.  Thanks to everyone who's been reading along.
“What do you take for them?”
I watch all of this unfold with a smug sense of glee.  My mother is a complicated woman. She’s much like Mycroft in her cold set of beliefs and general mistrust of all living creatures--but with a warmer interior.  She can’t help but question John’s motives when it comes to her frigid, unyielding youngest son; it’s in her nature after all. But I can see he’s already found his way through her walls.  He does that, my John.
“I don’t know, Mr. Holmes,”  She’s nearly whispering—is right there with him, then.  Has run out of options.  “What
