The black tie looped around the younger man's bare fingers and he couldn't help it when his legs parted to accommodate his lover. His body began to open up like a flower from the aftermath of a storm, the feeling of being so thirsty for sex and pleasure that he couldn't conceal his matched lust. And when Castiel tried to caress Dean's neck afterwards, the younger man collected those graceful hands and pried the black leather gloves away with his bare teeth, finger after finger with their eyes still latched onto each other.
Then the crunch of snow behind him and he was so confused, afraid, anxious, exhilarated at the same time, when Dean turned around and highlighted Castiel slowly closing the distance between them, he couldn't will his mind to work. Nothing seemed to be operating inside of his body but eyes that locked with blue ones and the hammering away of his heart until it probably died inside of his chest. Because from the moment the older man stepped into the heart illuminated on the snow, Dean felt that storm shift around them until they were standing in the eye and the entire world was placed on mute.
His lips trembled as he kept reading the text over and over again. And when the hot tears leaked down his cheeks, Castiel locked his phone and pressed it to his chest.
What seemed like a different situation all together to Castiel, proved to be quite similar to his own worries about Dean because he realized how broken everyone was inside.
Emerald eyes pinched from a smile gradually filled with adoration when Dean tapped into Cas' gallery and discovered that there was an album with his name as the title. 49 pictures piqued his interest and sliding into the chair beside Cas, he tapped into the album and immediately marveled over the collection ranging from his sleeping face, to him nestled into the chair in the game room. There were also stills of the back of his head in the Impala and one with him sitting cross legged on the floor cleaning his gun.
"Okay," Castiel blinked, utterly confused.
The drunk conversation hurt the most and still left an ache, the events that unfolded on Boxing Day after he pried the glass away from Dean because he couldn't simmer down his own disappointments in himself. He couldn't run upstairs, retrieve the ring and propose to the man he loved in front of everyone because he felt like it wasn't the right time. Castiel sobbed hoarsely in the backseat of the car, wishing that he could have wound back time and never made the decision to leave Dean's side because no client was ever more important than the man he loved.
Dean:
After a while when he was certain that he was too weak and too exposed, he went towards the window and his fingers lightly touched the blinds. Then as the sound of the piano died down, and the stillness of the night returned, Castiel tried so hard to find fascination and beauty in the fountain spurting up water from the tips of the unicorns' horns.
"Dean," Cas interrupted, realizing that if they continued down that path, then a few tears would be shed. "After we talked last night and I voiced my fears, I believe that we are on the same page now. Can we please stay away from addressing the past and focus on what we have right here?"
"I'm not jealous," Dean lied whilst avoiding eye contact, "I'm…just…you know," he scratched the back of his neck nervously. "I want to make this work, okay? I really do. But I've never done something like this before. Dammit, I've never even done this with a woman."
"I know a bit of how it feels, Dean. Believe me, I do."
"Yeah, but I'm a good judge of a man's cock even without seeing it out of his pants. And you my friend," she plopped onto the couch smiling, "you're packing. Then again, it's the nerdy ones that always have something yummy to hide. A wild rodeo side, a Christian Grey. Are you a Christian Grey?"
Really and truly, all the information did was justify my belief that Dean needed to be loved and convinced that he was worth it. And I was actually willing to do that after our in-depth conversations on Friday because the man was phenomenal and open and honest. When intoxicated, anyone could be both of those things. But if Ruby was indeed correct and he really was living with a non-existent sex life, then the two of us had more than a lot in common. The last time I slept with a woman was two years prior and that didn’t even count as an experience because April kept calling out me Zac Efron all the way through it.
“You do?” Charlie could only display the most intense fascination by such news. “What was it like?”
"Look at you looking all rolled over and eaten," Benny's wide grin was suggestive of so much mischief that his friend shoved him playfully away before the two of them laughed heartily. "Who would believe that we would be riding those Novaks together? Balth is so damn fine in bed that he leaves me weak and I'm betting it's the same for you and Cas. He probably rides you like a unicorn until you're sore. You ever use those lube coated condoms that come in those packets? Remind me to give you a couple we brought back from France."
At first, when Cas flipped on the light, he was unsure of whether the setting before him was an illusion or he was stepping into reality. And his small gasp filled the silence immediately, his heart swelling, and his eyes widening from the surprise that couldn't quite be processed all at once.
It couldn't be them because they were more than happy at that point but maybe there were things he wasn't privy to as yet. Maybe Castiel ran into a problem and couldn't discuss it with him because Ellen served as a better audience and she exceeded him in years. Dean frowned deeply, cast his eyes to the clipboard and sighed because he suddenly decided that the age gap would always place him at a disadvantage in certain areas. There were things Castiel would be involved in that he may never be able to participate in such as the older man's job or the affairs of the estate.
"Why don't you enlighten me what I'm clearly
Just as he was reaching for his car door though, Dean spotted a familiar face idling by the newspapers rack outside the store. Frowning deeply, the young man who he crossed paths with at the orphanage was perusing the content as if he was famished for news. In fact, his lips moved a little as if reading word for word and then he directed his stare into the distance, his countenance pensive.
“Cas…” Dean whispered.
"One thing you must be conscious of though," Castiel said softly, fixing the scarf around Dean's neck and resting their foreheads together, "is that without the struggles, some may resort to quite a relaxed life where they depend on others to support them. I'm not saying that they do not deserve assistance, but I've seen the mentality become ignorance when Balthazar and I upheld our feeding program. We…were so passionate about providing assistance any opportunity we got, but after some time…" he studied how green eyes softened, "we noticed that the parents stopped caring and they handed over the reins to us to tend to their children whilst
“So, you and Cas got together as yet?” she teased Dean openly, hugging a mug of cocoa and smirking. “And I’m talking about being more than friends. You know, like kissing on the lips and so much more.”
How as it possible?
“Dean!” Cas cried hoarsely, literally feeling his heart break into a million more pieces. “Please don’t say that.”
. I don't want anyone to have you."
“You a fed now, huh,” Dean was too impressed to conceal it and reaching out, he clipped the badge from his friend’s pocket and studied the credentials with a smile.
There was so much of a struggle happening in every single action; whether it was the slight tremble of Dean’s fingers, or the shifty eyes. Whether it was the light, breathless tone and the overly chatty mood to somehow serve as a distraction from reality. And whilst he wasn’t equipped with enough as Annalise over the years, Castiel was learning that Dean could be the most amazing warrior he ever met in his entire life.
“Well that was quick,” Dean whispered to Castiel and smiled. “Thought it would be much worse.”
“We both spent a considerable amount of time in cruel orphanages,” Castiel said softly, listening to the rain and trying to see through the haze as the loch was blurred before them. “My mother was taken in by the nuns when she was in labor and died shortly after giving birth to me. That’s as much as I will ever know but I guess that my childhood is just a blur which suits me. The rest of my life came as more than a struggle but it was so worth it.”
“Alright, so get this,” clearing his throat, he swirled the pink and white straw around in the smoothie and avoided making eye contact with either of them, “you two have no idea how terrified I am right now about being a dad. Like suppose I screw this up big time?”
"It is," Cas inhaled deeply and after resting the book upon the table, he leaned forward and gave all his attention to Dean. "You seem so…in control of yourself since I've come back. You've always been in tune with your feelings but now, you're not hesitant in speaking about how you feel. If something is bothering you, you come to me and you talk to me about what it is. And when we went one step further in the lake…"
"Come on. You're my best friend. I know that you still love him, Cas. I really do. And I know that you want to patch up things as much as he does—"
The revealing of the Elsa and Anna colorful windmills unearthed squeals that lasted throughout the house after they sprang up and chased each other. John, on his way in from the kitchen, sidestepped the two of them hustling to the closed backdoor and he laughed gaily.
"It is!" Dean doubled over onto the steering wheel and laughed until his eyes leaked tears. And then after he cast a look at Cas, the other man chuckled, shaking his head.
"If you're asking me if I feel physically attracted to you, then yes, Dean. I most certainly do," Cas admitted boldly. "And since I have been losing my powers, there are certain ways I feel about you that are new to me. Weak in the knees," Cas shook his head. "It is an ultimate truth."
“Of what?” Castiel’s held Dean’s hands softly between his and didn’t let go and it was such a tender gesture that all the uneasiness from the conversation drifted away. With his cheek resting on the other man’s right shoulder, their shadows merged under the stars in the most comforting way ever.
Wrapping his arm around Dean, Cas tugged him nearer and pressed a kiss onto the other man’s right cheek.
"Will you give Mala another try?" Cas hugged Dean tighter as they swayed a little on the spot. They fitted so perfectly together. "At least try for Sam. He deserves it after accepting the harsh reality of his best friend and his brother falling in love with each other."
Claire had lost her parents and so did Dean. Claire had been pushed into hunting for her father then her mother and so did Dean. She hated affection. Dean stiffened whenever Cas hugged him. Dean hated stuffed animals just like she did. And sometimes, maybe even more now as she sat next to him, Castiel dreamed about another path in life where he could have been in a female vessel and maybe they could have a child like Claire.
“Cas, if I met you at seventeen, I’d probably have the hugest crush on you. You were…” Dean gazed at the younger version of the man standing by his side and abundantly admired the softest features on a handsome face of an obviously awkward nerd.
He had a mini hall of fame over his bed with a poster of Helen Shapiro, The Ronettes, The Supremes, Paul Anka, Prince, the famous Freddie Mercury. But the most beautiful part of it all was the roof that was studded with all shapes of stars and barely glowing yellow in the faint light.
"It is a big deal when you single him out. You glue your eyes to his. And then now, you're looking for him out there with this hopeful expression on your face. It's funny," Sam wouldn't give up as he chased Dean through the garden heavy with smells of flowers.
"Certainly," Castiel allowed himself to be led away, without even throwing another glance at Dean who was left staring, obviously deeply affected and speechless.
Dean sighed because his friend was capable of coming up with the most creative things. “Let me guess. A cute smol teddy bear that loves hugs?”
When Dean helped himself to Castiel’s towel and proceeded to pat away the wetness from his arms, those green eyes narrowed at the orange boxers because he couldn’t quite shake the guilty intentions prior of forcing him to literally behold what was available.
"I feel like New Years' Eve is supposed to be all about sparkles and fireworks and food," Charlie said to Sam on the 31
you down there, so that I don't have to keep imagining what you look like. And I get the feeling that when the time comes, I'm not going to be able to control myself because the things I want to do to you…”
"Maybe you're just as bad as they say you are."
"Dean.." A mewling sound escaped from between Cas' lips.
She sighed, acknowledging the unfortunate occurrence. "It was tragic, Castiel. He was on his way to a birthday party and when the car hit a hydrant from swerving away from another car, he came out just fine. He went to the party, had a good time, came home, ate his dinner, went to bed. And then it was like a week after," her eyes were soft with tears as she looked at him, "he started complaining about these awful headaches. When we took him to the doctor, we found out that he was suffering from head trauma."
Dean’s green eyes sparkled and he chuckled, whilst his fingers played with the strands behind Castiel’s neck. “No. I’ve never wanted to be King. I don’t want to force that kind of pressure on any child of mine and I don’t care about procreation because there are plenty of babies out there who are alone and in orphanages and are hoping so much to have a home.
whilst questioning interesting persons for articles.
Now though, the setting seemed so changed, the air felt heavier now that the CEO was actually inside his bat cave. It was like the monster had returned and I was the prey. You know what it feels like, right? To just play around and enjoy the thrill when the cat was away and then afterwards, it was all about looking busy and being respectful and getting the job done.
The last time he had been up there, Naomi had informed Castiel of the absolute necessity in finding an arch angel that could power up Heaven. Without an arch angel, or Jack, and from the thought of Jack, Castiel's chest ached, there could be no continuation of a very powerful concept that had existed before God created the first two humans. Now, there were close to five angels remaining, the rest were lost and wandering the earth, definitely absent of grace. And their only hope was Michael who had become lost in the wind.
"Yeah, I know that. But they want proof of income and a few more things but we can do this."
“Yes.” Cas nodded and as they were confronted with a view of the ocean a few feet away, the waves lapping onto the sand, the older man stopped breathing. “This is quite beautiful, Dean. You’re very thoughtful about first dates, aren’t you?”
The two of them snorted as they ascended the stone steps covered in red carpet that dulled the sounds of their shoes.
Evidently Cas was growing quite comfortable with the idea of screwing with his mind. Never had he even imagined that the other man could contribute so much sensational vocabulary into their conversation. It was something that Dean obviously had not anticipated and he…favored the change. He welcomed it and wondered if Cas stimulating string of words could get such a rise out of him, then how the hell would they survive in bed?
"Dude, I'm not. I'm just saying…" Dean sighed. "Look, forget it." Curling up on the chair, he scowled at the window.
“And why am I biased? Hmm?”
"I told you nothing would come out of it. Why would you bring it up?" he asked in dismay. "Now I'm not going to hear the last of it until I spill every goddamn thing there is to know."
"And I've always asked you to come to me the moment you reach that point," Rowena softened her gaze. "I don't care what the time is, you call me. I'm going to drop whatever I'm doing to come to you."
"Of course, I want you to," Castiel said softly, caressing Dean's right cheek with cupped fingers. "All I'll keep daydreaming about is our intimate moments and hopefully, I might be able to concentrate on those numbers. Sweetheart, it's not like I'm leaving you to…go to Canada or London or Australia. Please do not be upset about this, hmm?"
Well after spending most of his life believing that he may have never been able to grant his heart the pleasures of becoming one with another…finally the moment arrived. Not only was he contented in more ways than one, but he was also elated and excited and nervous and anxious about their future together.
“What about Castiel?” Donna frowned at her wife. “Doesn’t miss a dinner,” this she directed at Dean who avoided Claire’s grin like the plague. “Always good with conversation. I bet the two of them talk lots. Castiel always brought up the best topics.”
“But you’ve got to admit that you hate my father.”
Bouncing on the bed like a child, Charlie seemed a lot more excited for him therefore suggesting that she probably thought it was long overdue that he would make out with anyone at all by the age of sixteen.
Castiel chuckled, trying hard not to look at the two women across the table. “Okay, so Austen then.”
Ruby, at first was confused. “Who?”
“Oh, it will be. You just have to give it some time to happen. Might I add too that mother would be most delighted to discover that her most perfect son is actually bisexual?”
all the time. You…actually got this," Dean hugged the instrument and stared, "all the way to…Taylor…and got her to sign it. Okay, I think I'm hyperventilating," he doubled over and tried to breathe, "she touched…my freaking guitar. Taylor touched my…guitar. Son of a bitch, I can't feel my legs."
"Think you can come for me again?" Dean dared to ask, blindly thrusting as he neared the edge again. "Cas? Can you…"
Standing in the sun, waiting on Lisa who disappeared into the boutique and suddenly deciding that they would get inked up. Fishing together by the pond and both of them barbequing their catches with extra sauce and pepper. Wildly screaming in the night behind Benny as both of them raced down the highway on a borrowed Harley and ended up on the outskirts of the town.
But when he joined the group of spectators in front of Saint John’s Cathedral, nothing miraculous happened. There weren’t the spread of a rainbow and a colorful mirage cast on the scene to prep for the most amazing moment to come when the two of them collided.
“Fist to nose,” Donna dramatized the punches, throwing them dramatically with a humored expression on her round face, “one after the other until John stepped in and finished them off. And from then Mary and Cas became the best of friends because they started to pair up to become the unbeatable top two.”
Maybe it was the difference of knowing and not knowing, of reflexively acting a certain way and then never believing that he ever craved that kind of nearness from someone else. Because sure, he wasn’t exactly the affectionate type but neither was he a stone that didn’t require some kind of human contact.
“What did you take?” I repeated, stressing on my words and worried that this was so crucial, it couldn’t be something good. “Dean, answer me—”
Throughout the three days though, Charlie had no time to spare based on her job and balancing the orphanage’s demands as well. Therefore, Dean was left to silently process everything whilst trying with great pains to distract himself from dabbling in a lot of overthinking. But it wasn’t as if she didn’t present the opportunity for them to have any kind of conversation. They both could pick up the phone and call, which she did every night after returning to Saint Anne’s and there were messaging platforms to speak about anything.
And why not? When the grating truth between the plea of
At first, his brother was obviously shocked. And so was Cas. Both of them stared at him, knowing well enough that Dean was trying his best to conceal the fact that he had been crying for at least half an hour.
I could feel the blood rushing through my body when I fled. Tears clouded my vision, and I was filled with weakness despite my brother’s lamentations that it was a sign of strength.
so special? All of the doubts the younger man would have voiced in Castiel's office a few days ago came to light in the reverse, only difference was that this time, Castiel wasn't asking why he was worthy of Dean's love and tenderness. He was fighting with the fear of being completely inadequate, of never being able to stay spritely and energetic for too long because he would grow old faster than Dean. He would slow down perhaps later than sooner but he
They kissed each other deeply until Castiel was back on the soft blankets and Dean on top of him and then everything else happened so beautifully.
What had he done to them? Had he done the ultimate wrong that would never be fixed by implying that they jump the gun? Sex. Was that it? But then he stood there and he suddenly realized that maybe the problem was him. Maybe Cas was the one who couldn't fantasize about them becoming intimate because Dean was a simple man; he was a human. He wasn't meaningful enough for Cas to consider in a sexual way and maybe Cas couldn't fantasize. Maybe that's what being an angel was like. Sex wasn't ever a big deal.
He tried to search his face, wondering if they were cracking instead of blooming.
“Then by all means you do that,” Dean, completely impressed that he would not have to pressure either of them to take the lead, sat back and folded his arms. “And go easy on your dad,” he sent her a pleading look, “he’s a pretty nice guy.”
"The dance," Dean gestured with his thumb towards the interior of the palace. "We get to choose someone that's…special to dance with. It's Jenny's Market. I'm pretty certain you wouldn't mind because I'm going to show you the steps. All you have to do is follow my lead."
“Will you do it?” Castiel wrung his gloved hands and pleaded with Dean as the shoveling paused again and their eyes met. “For me? You are aware of how much this means to me. And I am most obviously in your debt if you—”
“But why are you nervous? Dean has no intentions of bolting on you like he did with the others. He’s the one who chased you and I don’t think for a second that my brother would ever hurt you. And speaking of my brother,” the sound of loud cheers emanating from outside the cathedral was so phenomenal, “here he comes.”
“I’m quite contented at the moment with good company and the movie. In fact, between you and me, Wuthering Heights has never been my ultimate favorite,” Castiel chuckled softly as his blue eyes reflected the movie. “Do you share the same view?”
“And he matters very much to me,” Castiel said with a nod.
By the time he completed the short demonstration, addressing an invisible character by his side that he told them only he could see and unearthing giggles and smiles, the kids were eager to read the story. And Charlie was a little too thrilled to find them enthusiast about literature that she wondered if he could perhaps entertain guest appearances after she introduced books they were to study and analyze.
“Why?” Dean sipped some of the orange juice and weakly picked up the snack. “You can’t face the fact that it will happen eventually?”
His face contorted from the wave of emotions coursing through his body, from dying inside.
Lowering his eyes, arms forming a triangle upon the table, the older man didn’t provide a response immediately. Instead, he allowed the peaceful seconds to be consumed with so much unfolding between the two of them. It wasn’t magical alone. It was ethereal and thrilling and frightening all at the same time. For him also, it was a level of uncertainty matched to trying something new and not knowing where it was going to lead them.
Sighing, the older man nodded, chewed on his lips with lowered eyes and carefully reached out to pluck a Gillette razor from the shelf. He fixed the price tag that was lopsided and seemed to be pondering on something for a few seconds. Throughout this internal process of untangling his thoughts though, Dean studied Castiel's face and for the first time, he realized how the other man's features were beyond handsome. He didn't entertain a scruff, but the hints of black tinged with grey covered small patches on his jaw.
"I did. And I didn't even realize how gay I sounded until afterwards when I was like wait…maybe I sounded totally jealous."
His hand wove its way around Cas' waist and they walked towards the short line awaiting the ride. To any bystander, they appeared to be simply…comfortable with each other. Sam, from a distance pinpointed his brother first and as he gazed at him, he saw nothing but a softness that never really had been revealed for so many years. Dean was…defeated by love. His wild spirit had been calmed and now he looked in the simplest definition as…happy.
Dean’s suspicions were highlighted when the older man missed dinner the night after and then the following night, he excused himself because of a meeting with a client that lasted past the hour of six. Never did those excuses ever serve as such importance to miss the company of even John or Ellen or Bobby. And it was all too obvious why to him but never quite certain to them why the chair remained empty and the path untrodden day after day.
"I toast to that entire speech," Sam lifted his glass and beamed at his wife who smiled warmly in his direction before she jerked her chin at Castiel who was sitting not too far from her and appearing rather wounded.
The Prince snorted, glanced away and his body shook from trying to contain a bout of giggles. “Yeah, it was the same with all of my exes.”
Castiel tilted his head, eyes lowered onto the floor and he licked his lips slowly before sighing. "Okay."
Castiel swallowed hard and tethered on the precipice. “Impala.”
“Man, I don’t know at all.”
How could she come into the house and literally defame his character after being absent for over five years?
She never needed to take notes during their sessions. They had been acquainted for close to twenty years. And even though she had been seeing him for so long, Rowena still needed to retrack, and to make some mental adjustments during every session.
When Dean was four, he was described as a quiet child who loved to laugh and chase butterflies in the palace grounds. Until one day, his father walked in on him dusting his eyelids with Mary's gold eyeshadow, a string of her finest pearls around his neck.
After turning around though and considering the woman who was armed and couldn’t appear dangerous to Dean more than what her intentions were in the moment, the hunter nodded. And when he did, Castiel considered him with abundant worry because he could not decipher what it was. No matter how hard he tried to read Dean’s mind, he could not penetrate the walls.
you?” Castiel’s gravelly voice was so soothing to the other man’s ears. “When you’ve just opened up your heart to me? That’s not worthy of punishment.”
"The Castiel Gift Center—"
“I’ll catch you,” Mrs. Hatchett pointed her finger accusingly, “believe me, I will. I smell a rat and it will only be time before the carcass is revealed. And when I find it, Castiel,” collecting the files, she moved to the door, “you’ll owe me all the information you have on Bill Gates working for E.T.”
"I know you are," Jody patted Dean's back affectionately. "But don't wait too long to patch things up properly. And after all the bad things both of you have done, you're still here. You got to look at it that way. It's been ten years, Dean. There's nothing about you Cas doesn't know and vice versa."
“If you pay it tomorrow, will the light come back on by the afternoon?” Castiel sounded so hopeful, he wished that something could be done.
From the beautiful arch guiding guests into the gazebo made of blue, green and gold balloons and woven together with gold ribbons. To the rows of chairs decorated in white with blue and green bows tied to the backs. Then there was the buffet consisting of peanut butter sandwiches and burgers. The fine Merlot. The cases of beer. And the main attraction, the Impala with a blue bow pinned on her nose and a green bow tied onto her trunk.
“Screw you.”
"I'll definitely have a go at it," Dean said softly, handing over an apple to the ten year old who clung to his arm as if she was desperate for a friend. "Actually I'm not a teacher as yet. But I'm on my way to becoming one."
"No. I wouldn't."
No one could have formulated any response because it was evident that John was furious, but Ellen being strong and also summoned by the two men, rose up and followed. Which left the three young people to throw glances at each other, Dean painfully feeling Castiel's absence after settling into his lover's arms and now having no arms to comfort him. Sam though, was always the playful one and quietly rising up from his chair, he snuck toward the backdoor on the tips of his toes and rested his ear upon the glass.
Immediately Castiel took his gloved right hand, smiling warmly and realizing that maybe love to Dean had always been something that he thought was never deserving. Until he completely cracked from the heavy weight of jealousy and was forced to embrace the generous affections another man could shower upon him and had been consistently achieving over the many years they were friends.
"I go commando during summer…"
“You could wear a potato sack and he’d still look at you like you’re a billion dollars. But because of formality,” she neatly fixed the jacket on a hanger and laid it on the bed, “you have to go with the suit.” When Castiel groaned, she chuckled. “Dude, you kick ass in suits. You ooze sex appeal and if you keep your hair just as it is, you’ll look like one of those dashing guys who can weaken anyone’s knees.”
“You’re dreaming of her, aren’t you?” she lashed my arm and scowled, “that’s it then. I’m going to walk up to IT, lock the door and get my answers. Kevin will be a smiling fucker tomorrow.”
“You telling me that we’re going to ditch the suits later, Cas?” Dean stepped closer and smiled as Castiel’s chest heaved. “Because I don’t mind at all if that happens. At least looking forward to it would give me a lot of strength to make it through the prom.”
or having his head rubbed into the dirt or pushed into a toilet because he was soft and too pretty to be straight.
"You said…that whenever I looked at you, you just…what was it, Cas?" Dean asked in a softer tone.
He would have preferred to leave but Dean realized that no matter what, he really needed to see Castiel more than anything else and he would wait. But whilst doing so, it meant that he would have to suffer in the company of a woman he wronged many years ago.
"Yeah, well you do that. Wish you luck, man," his voice hoarsened until John turned to stare at the two of them with a worried expression. "Load the gun and keep firing at me, right?"
Every so often, Dean could hear the pulsating sounds of music drifting across the distance. Someone was having a party. And even though the world was alive around them, when he sat beside the love of his life, nothing else mattered.
you’re in love?”
"Cas is…uh…gone," his voice cracked, just as his heart was cracking into a million pieces when he could have been allowed to feel whole again. He should have it all, should have been so happy too, but he wasn't lucky. "Sam, he's gone. The…Empty…took him. He…" staring at his brother like a deer in the headlights, Dean swallowed, "…sacrificed himself for me. It all happened so fast and I—"
"You're an angel," she said weakly, patting his arm fondly and displaying lines on her young face from fatigue. "I could tell from your eyes that you've got a good heart. And now that I met a man like you, I know that good men exist. My husband," her face changed into a grimace when he turned off the kettle, "is a monster. He works down at the mills and spends his money on alcohol."
"It's not deep. It's shallow where I am. Cas, come on," Dean pouted.
Without tearing his eyes away from Castiel, the Prince allowed himself to be captured by the flashes of cameras. The questions still followed. Many questions trying to pry the truth from him. Whether he was in love with someone else. Whether he could publicly announce his disengagement from the Princess.
“You…tease. You…handsome and wonderful man,” Castiel’s eyes fluttered close when the Prince brushed their noses together affectionately. He could almost instantaneously feel the pull between them strengthen. “Christ, you smell so good.”
“Watch out, Dean,” Sam said as the intro to the movie began to roll out on the screen, “Cas might fall head over heels in love with Daniel Radcliffe.” He adjusted the position of the television a little more and then hopped onto his bed that contained at least five pillows of assorted sizes.
“They’ll be married soon,” he said confidently, tugging at the collar of his black and red plaid shirt. The sleeves strained from well-formed biceps that were acquired from a good enough dedication to weight-lifting after two severe breakups. That was another story for another time though. “You wait and see. I’ll give it about five months. Seven tops. Knowing Sammy, he’ll buy the ring next month.”
Four months and three days. That’s how long I was working for the GENTS Magazine as an intern, fresh out of college and hoping to snag a permanent job in the collapsing economy. Because being equipped with a Degree in Business Management didn’t secure your future with a promising position. You had to work your butt off to prove your worth. And there I was at 6.45pm on a Friday night, going through a list of customers who were still pending payments on subscriptions.
The first two were compliments of Ruby, to which he didn't include her name as the tour guide. And the last one didn't include anyone else whilst a group of teenagers kept calling him Clark Kent and laughingly asking where he hid his cape.
. But far enough that I can still feel...
The kind of eyes that spoke volumes from years of being alone and fighting from the many injustices and awful prejudices linked from his parents, to his failed marriage and then nothing except being in his own company without anyone ever loving him back.
Throughout half the evening, the older man comfortably sandwiched himself between his brother and Charlie and carried on a conversation that was too entertaining to include chuckles and good humor. This left Dean in the company of Ellen, Donna and Jody as Bobby sought out John and whilst his nanny could offer as much comfort as any else could, his dampened spirits soon returned with great force. His mood altered tremendously and trying to conceal such disappointment from being excluded was far too much.
“Busted,” he tugged Castiel closer and winked at the most famous BBC reporter, “hi, Peggy,” Dean was breathless from a rush of nervousness, “I guess you can stop bombarding me with questions about my relationship status now.”
"Thing is…love ain't supposed to be easy," Dean said with certainty. They were almost there, and it was just around midday. "You've seen just how complicated things were between me and Cas. But we pulled through. Why? Because no matter what, at the end of the day, I'd rather have him. Now Sam probably acted just as Jody and Donna."
Castiel quickly closed the laptop and pushed it onto the oak table. After collecting the bottle of wine, he sat back. Squeezing his eyes shut, he tried to evaporate the thoughts fighting inside his head. Trying to chase away the lyrics. Hating himself for even listening to the song because it was clearer now that Dean's intent had been substantial.
“Oh, you sly dog,” Dean sat up straighter now and stared in disbelief at his brother. “The blonde with the dragon tattoo?”
“Hi!” he settled onto the sofa and rested the bowl of vegetable soup on the coffee table. “Forgive me but I managed to dump myself too.”
Instead, he sat stiffly in one attitude for a prolonged minute whilst she offered him a scone. Then he nibbled on it and voiced his judgement on the truth in her earlier words about its quality. Mary admitted that the recipe had been passed down from her grandmother.
“Like you care how I feel about this.” Dean’s eyes glistened from holding back tears that would not stay away.
“I’m talking about Cas,” John chuckled when green eyes widened in his direction and the bag of flour was carefully rested onto the counter. “Don’t look so surprised that I should know about you two secretly going around behind my damn back. I saw you in church today. Can't keep your hands off of him, can you? Well, I always knew.”
By the time Cas digested what was occurring around them both, his shoes landed in the soften ss of lush grass. There was the sound of lapping waves and upon turning to face the spectacular view, Cas marveled over the familiarity of every single thing. Even the fishermen casting their nets as the orange sun sunk lower behind the hills. And the presence of small boats slicing through the surface of Loch Laggan that looked like glass. Even the rolling grasslands couldn't free the thought of slipping off his shoes and running around the expansive fields.
Gently their lips met at first, like a chaste kiss and then after studying each other's eyes and blinking slowly, they both initiated a deeper connection that was blissful and beautiful. Every single time he kissed Castiel, Dean couldn't believe how the moment felt like he was experiencing an incredible high for the first time. He could remember how the older man tasted the night prior like wine, and in the shower like minty toothpaste. But he was granted now with the opportunity of knowing what coffee could contribute when touched by those soft and daring lips.
Good God. Were all London men so deranged like the few that had left prior?
Meg was a wonderful conversationalist. Everyone seemed to like her. And then when people started to acquaint him with the likes of the man in the newspaper, Castiel didn't flinch. He had long now gotten past that bit of publicity that was uncalled for. And it wasn't going to force him to live out his days in London as a figure behind a pair of awfully large sunglasses.
for the rest of my life. The orgies, the skinny dipping with her cousin, the quick make out session in the shed down by the lake? I'm not stupid, man."
What all of that seemed to amount to was that in desperate times, when he took those desperate measures,
“Yup, so even if he’s into you, and he loves you like so, so much, when he gets to that moment, it could go back to the bad experience he had. Our minds are so screwed up sometimes, it remembers things and turns the experiences onto us. One of my friends has this serious problem of not reacting at all because he was bitten constantly by a girl who went down on him. And he just associated a blowjob with getting hurt. Shut up, Kevin,” Charlie scowled as her friend mimicked by chewing on his spoon with a widened grin. “None of this is funny, especially when you’re the one who finds yourself in that situation.”
That small smile melted the Castiel’s heart and he sighed. His chest heaved uncontrollably. “In every lifetime,” he whispered. “I’ll always be yours, Dean. I’ll take you any way you are, for as long as I can have you.”
"You mean to tell me, it wasn't happening before?” he settled his gaze onto the window and studied Castiel intimately embraced in his son’s arms. “Well, I’ll be damned. And all this time I thought it was just a lovers' quarrel.”
“Cas… please..” Dean begged because he needed some kind of touch from the other man, some kind of raw friction that would drive him crazy. “Whatever you want, take it. You don’t have to ask. Just...take it all.”
Michael continuously lamented on how he could save Heaven but Chuck had to relinquish some of the power to him. Over and over again their voices droned on inside Castiel's head and yet, he still kept breaking inside.
“So you think that he will touch and go,” Sam leaned back in his chair and considered Cas who had stopped crying. “Like a one-night stand then.”
“One might think that the flu has changed your character severely for you to refer to me by my surname. Might I ask why the sudden change?” Although warmed by the temperature in the house, Castiel felt somewhat nervous and uncertain of himself as he dragged his chair closer to the side of the bed.
They swayed a little on the spot and the Prince buried his face into Castiel’s hair whilst he lowered their entwined hands. He waited on permission to touch Castiel where he was already aching and hard. And when Castiel guided their hands below his waist, Dean held him tighter as he grew weaker.
Sam sighed again. “I believe you. I just wish that he knew you still love him. He’s locked himself away. He never comes out only when forced by mom to have tea with her. And when I look into his eyes, I don’t see my brother in there anymore. I see pain. Like if he’s holding his breath.”
impressive," Dean scoffed and folded his fingers, studying them whilst the air between them grew warmer and uncomfortable. "I'm just an ordinary dude who wants world peace."
“You were the one who kept telling me to always keep fighting,” Dean whispered, impressed by the coincidence. “Jesus. It’s like…I was sitting on the chair debating on what the hell to get and then those three words just came to me. It’s been my life quo for years now, especially after being wrecked by two shitty romances. Man, this is just…”
"Look, it's not like you two don't know how it is, okay? I'm going through this phase that I've never experience before."
"Because you refuse to confide in me!"
ask about it,” Dean added gruffly, wondering why his anger flared a little like the flames licking the logs when such a thing never happened so quickly before between them.
"Gone home to handle something," avoiding their eyes, he settled on a portion of beans, potato and ham and lowered himself slowly onto a chair by the table. "Dude, I need to get out of this house for
Or never getting to touch each other every second of every day, or driving all the way to Hampshire, aching to kiss, but holding back because of the two other passengers in the backseat.
Castiel’s blue eyes widened and his smile stretched from ear to ear. “Ah, the question I was waiting for. It appears that Jo made a very bad financial decision and needed my advice. I, of course, gave my opinions free of charge like the kind hearted man I am.”
"Hmm," Cas seemed to ponder on the possibility as a smile played on his lips. "You did agree that we should take it slow. Two kisses in less than 24 hours?"
"Wow, uh…very…thoughtful of Terry to be so generous in his details," Dean swallowed but managed a smile, because if there was one thing that terrified him, it was the actuality of pushing a little further with Castiel and then because of being inexperienced, failing along the way.
“Marriage is a big leap but don’t you ever want to…you know,
They nodded at him, offered a smile and then turned themselves into flies on the wall.
. I am not going to stand underneath your window and call out or sing to you. Disappointing but the truth."
But then there was the dying need to say something, because he wanted so much more in that moment and because he couldn’t really control his weakened state, Dean handed over control to his heart.
"Meaning?" Cas was confused.
“I get you,” Dean rolled his eyes after John turned away and laughed at Ellen who in turn, slowly approached the pair by the door, clearly thrilled. “What I was going to say, is that we’re officially a couple. I mean it took some time for me to figure it out but we’re getting somewhere.”
But he left the other man in a state that was far worse than death.
"And I mean, like really going at it. I'm talking…buttons popping, hair being yanked, panting…" Dean draped his shirt on top of Cas' black shirt and he unbuckled his belt. "We have our cups of tea in the morning on that table, dammit."
, okay?”
"I should."
“It’s Dean, isn’t it?” he decided to leap ahead, because Castiel’s aura was electric and unsettled from fearing the truth and voicing all of it. “It’s always been him. I can tell that he means the world to you. But I wasn’t sure how much until I started thinking about why the Empty would want to take your happiness away and what that would mean. You’d be devastated without Dean. Just as he was devastated when you died, and it all makes sense now.” Sitting up a little straighter, Jack considered blue eyes that leaked tears. “Cas, are you in love with Dean?”
"Couple years ago. Maybe…eight years back. I think Sam knew before I did…about my feelings for Cas, I mean. But at the time, he was only trying to look out for me. Just like Jody and Donna are looking out for you. Claire, you know that the lives we live aren't exactly peachy. And I get that you love this girl…Amy, right?"
Dean on the other hand, stared back in awe. "Don't make me show you. Cause I can drop my pants and show you exactly what the hell you're doing to me –"
"I feel so…overwhelmed?" trying to breathe and realizing that his lungs didn't comply, Dean stared into blue eyes. "I don't know how to do this."
"I mean, all I want is for you and Cas to sort things out," Sam raked back his locks, "Are you okay though? How are things going with you? I know that we haven't really been…talking much about it. But I keep thinking that you'll talk to me when you're ready."
“My fucked up morning just turned brighter,” he said before turning to his Executive Assistant who was obviously drowning from an abundance of feelings. “Ruby. Missed me?”
Getting into the car, I started the engine and drove away. I never looked back because it was like staring into the wilder side of life, a place I never walked before. But I wanted to go there with him. I wanted to risk everything and open myself up to someone who was a stranger, so easily. That it scared me.
"You were sleeping, remember?" chuckling a little, the younger man picked up the cherry and plucked it into his mouth before chewing.
“I am just going to make myself a cup of tea,” Castiel said softly, his countenance weakening after pleading with Sam to divert from the topic. And handing over the baby to his father, he spared a bashful look at Dean, then stepped out of the room without another word.
“Migraine?” I tried, although flight mode was growing stronger and the urge to drink in every inch of his crisp black shirt. He had just decided to yank off his tie and force two buttons undone. And the black jersey or vest underneath was so contrasting to smooth, perfect skin just below his neck that I couldn’t deny how sexiness oozed from every inch of this man.
"He couldn't get it up and we didn't sleep together because he kept talking about this person. This guy. Cas. Over and over again, he kept telling me that he loves Cas. And Cas is his life. And Cas this and Cas that," Amanda sighed. "Then he fell asleep crying over someone who I thought was a woman. Next morning, when he told me that Cas was actually a dude, I really felt bad because I'm honestly telling you, this guy," she gestured at Dean by her side, "is so in love with Cas, he couldn't even give it up for one night out of guilty pleasure. And you know how most guys are. They jump into it. I mean look at me, I'm hot as fuck but Dean never even touched me."
Very soon, the three entertained an intense discussion on the satisfaction gained by the households that already received their hampers. The other ones were yet to be delivered in hopes of the same contentment and as soon as Dorothy gathered up the sufficient produce then Charlie and the rest of the church group would recommence packing the baskets.
John was left to scrutinize Dean’s face, and after noting that his son seemed clearly affected by his best friend’s decision, he sighed and could only comply since Castiel was not a man to be easily persuaded. Anyone in that moment could decipher that something was amiss between the two but since neither party cared to offer any hints to whatever was the matter, nothing could be done to address it.
"You told me that we shouldn’t stay in your bedroom for too long because we'd end up ripping each other's clothes off…"
“Thanks. Coming from you, it carries more worth than I thought it would. What were you doing so late at work anyway? Don’t you get off at 5?” eyebrows knitting, he reached for the bottle and poured himself a finger. Screwing the cork back on, he studied my eyes, soft crinkles appearing at the corners of his own and he frowned deeper when I sighed. “What’s up? Talk to me, man.”
He swallowed his pride. "I don't know what to do."
“Honey, what happened?” she was immediately available for him to rant and would always be there if he needed to.
Dean's interest was piqued. "Oh yeah? Where's it?"
"That's because people were tipped off, paid lots of pounds to destroy whatever evidence they had."
“Good,” John nodded. “You’re smart. The next time you see him, end it forever or else I will end if for you. Most of all him. You see, he has this brain disease that lessens his worth of a man. I would hate for something to happen that would push him over the edge.”
"Like me," Castiel pursed his lips, and folded his arms.
“Yeah, I’m taking them,” Dean sighed. “I’m in Airplane Mode. Have been for a week now. You know, I disappear sometimes. I draw blanks and go under the radar. Right now, I feel like I’m sailing among the stars.”
Cas took a tentative step towards him, and yet, he dared not touch the other man. Sometimes when Dean was in a furious mood, Cas really couldn’t reach him. No one could. Talking to him would probably unearth an outburst that would end up in the exchange of heated words; something he never wanted to happen easily between the two of them. Now that Dean’s most prized possession was stolen in the wind by the shifter, he had shifted into a scary monster himself. And it took every ounce of energy within Cas’ soul to keep a considerable distance away from Dean.
“I get that. But after all these years, I’ve taken to my whiskey like an escape I crave for when my mind just wouldn’t shut up.”
very appreciative, I’ve known for a long time that I’m very much not interested in women sexually.”
From the moment Castiel showed up on the back porch to greet him, the younger man pushed him against the wall and crushed their lips together. Searching, delving deeper with his tongue and unearthing a moan that was sinful at a little past one in the day; the two of them allowed their hands to roam, whilst Dean's own raked up under the older man's red wool sweater and he savored those taunt muscles. He really thought of Castiel’s body like a drug that could become so intoxicating, at times his mind, his hands craved to touch.
“Both.” He nodded after studying the half-eaten meal on his lap. The way his tone just dulled seemed to suggest that he was far too much occupied with other thoughts that were heavier than accustomed to. He stuck his fork into the lettuce. “You hanging in there though?”
“You can
“Most times, that’s you.”
When his words died away, Dean chuckled because there wasn’t a hint of discomfort but mostly intrigue. “Of course, Cas. That’s what being in love with someone leads to eventually, right?”
After returning to the house and tucking John under a blanket as the game blared on the television, Dean skipped up the steps and plopped onto his bed. But he only remained there for a few seconds before springing up and rushing to the window. Parting the blue blinds, his eyes trailed the path between the Winchester’s house and the Novak estate and guiltily, he sought out a moving figure.
He was forty-five years old, very much independent, composed and sophisticated. He was needy, very much clingy though and desperate for attention at times, which Dean embraced because he was exactly the same, but he also at times wished that one of them was the complete opposite. Being so reliant on each other pulled both of them down under sometimes because they just couldn't stay afloat and it didn't terrify Dean, but he just felt like it might be detrimental. Like after taking a long shower and collapsing onto his bed, after opening WhatsApp, he noticed the ONLINE status again, the anticipation of just sending that message but he didn't.
“Believe me, I don’t need convincing on that,” Castiel hummed when Dean tugged down his shirt and started sucking on his left shoulder. “I think that in all honesty, so far you’ve proven to me that being loved by a man like you, is by far the most amazing experience ever. I will never be the same again. Especially after you keep sucking on me like I’m a damn lollipop.”
“Exactly,” Castiel pressed a chaste kiss onto Dean’s forehead. “Also, I cannot deny that sex plays a significant part in being your lover. But…” he kissed Dean’s lips whilst he chuckled, “it is not substantial as compared to everything else that encompasses how beautiful you are to me. I love the depth of your heart, Dean. You’ve proven to me that love has no bounds by keeping your promise after we parted a little over three months ago. It’s something that I will never forget. And believe me, whenever you’re ready for us to go all the way as you keeping teasing me constantly, I’m not going to leave you afterwards.”
Immediately snapping a copy of ‘Wuthering Heights’ close, Castiel sprang up by reflex. And was just in time to witness no other than King John buried inside a coat of white fur and blue velvet coming into the living room.
how I am. I’m not going to chase after a skirt. I haven’t done it for years and what makes you think that
"You didn't want to see him," Rowena said, studying his profile by the window. Dean was evidently filled with so many emotions at that point, she needed to empty them out so that he could start healing again. "Why?"
Green eyes peeped out from under his folded arms. Dean blinked up at his brother. Then slowly, he pried the sandwich from Sam's grasp and he nibbled on it.
“Man,” he pinched his nose and leaned onto the wall, a hand tucked into his pants’ pocket, “I just might have to do that with the way I’m feeling. All I want to do is forget.”
"You're not an unworthy, egotistical American," Dean was breathless, completely riding out a high. "You're…" he clutched his sides, chest heaving, "adorable and beautiful. You're amazing. And…completely –"
“You’re not gay, neither am I but I’m a hell of a lot gay when it comes to you. And I’d get it if you’re not in this for a lot more than just talking because why would you be into me anyway, right?” Dean chuckled to himself, feeling how his throat burned and he shook his head. “Why would a dude as awesome as you…want to jump out of his comfort zone to even
"You're not dead to me, Cas."
“So, Benny is okay with you and me? Don’t get me wrong but he doesn’t seem to like me at all.”
“I promise that when that time comes…when we finally get to go all the way, I’ll make up for all the bad experiences you’ve had. I’ll show you how amazing it is when a man makes love to you. And you’ll never ever leave me because you’ll always want more.”
"I need boxers," Sam's lanky form was quite visible above the many racks of clothing. He raked his fingers through silky hair and quickly narrowed his eyes at his best friend's smiling face. "You okay there, bro?"
, huh?” The boldness was too severe to misplace, but reliant on his growing suspicion that her visit was anything but to present an abundance of mockery.
Castiel started to grind his definite bulge over Dean’s arse whilst caressing the smooth skin climbing across that glorious arched back. And he willingly let his hand wander over Dean’s body, almost as if he was trying to search for every single inch because he craved to know those places. His hands found Dean’s nipples and played with them, and he twisted very gently, rubbing with the tips of his fingers and gradually squeezing until…
When they did come face to face again though, Cas was sitting in the kitchen trying to take measured sips from a blend of honey and ginger tea. Although he tried, he couldn't calm his nerves. And he began to really question the state of his grace because there were emotions that he felt stronger now. And maybe loving Dean had opened up that side of his celestial existence and in that moment, when Dean showed up in the doorway, Cas stopped breathing.
Pulling back the covers, Cas climbed in and tucked himself under the blanket. But those blue eyes never left Dean's green ones. In fact, Cas kept gazing at the other man intently, trying to draw him closer and quite aware of the effect he had on the hunter.
The silence that stretched on between them was filled with a heaviness. Of guilt, maybe. Of mocking his brother. Sam was slowly beginning to realize that after all this time, maybe he had always read Dean's feelings wrong. Maybe Dean wasn't being a jerk because he refused to accept his feelings. Maybe his brother had already grown to accept himself, and was afraid to expose his vulnerability to Cas and himself.
between us again. It reached a point where I lowered my eyes onto my lap and started to give in to playing stupidly with my fingers. Twisting them, studying the shape of my thumbs, wondering what the lines on my palms meant.
He felt him because he
“Now no one talks to my brother like that,” Benny stepped forward and planted himself between Lisa, Clarke and then Dean. Folding his arms, he was taller, scruffier and intimidating enough to force the former pair to back away just enough. “The only thing that’s ending now is this ridiculous confrontation happening right here.”
"A bit. As I become more human, there are certain things that are quite uncomfortable."
"Also the silence. Listen to it—"
Cas felt like everything was justified.
"Like the one time you told me to take Shirley to the milkshake parlor," Dean shook his head and remembered the old days. "Damn that was a horrible date."
"Yes," Castiel nodded. He tried the cocktail again and inhaled deeply. "I was pulled back into Heaven to be disciplined because of my feelings for you."
Swallowing hard, eyes fluttering close as he tried to gather composure, Dean inhaled deeply because had he blurted out a reply, then everything would sound triple times worse. “He was never my boyfriend. I never had one of those.”
Green eyes blinked slowly and the younger man stared at the screen because he couldn’t comply. “I’m just done.”
"I don't…want…anyone else," Dean's voice cracked and he stared back with tears filling his eyes, "okay? I just want you because you make me happy and it's like…I've been holding my breath for so long, wondering what my definition of happiness is. I kept thinking maybe it had to do with my studies and my job, and being normal. But it's not that. It was never that. It's always been…saying it, admitting it. That you…
As he made his way down the many hallways in the fifty-level building though, it dawned upon Castiel that he really needed a new pair of shoes. Long walks weren’t a usual thing but the soles of his current ones were worn out. What he also detested was the extremely cold atmosphere of the upper levels of the building. Frigid until his bones ached and toes turned into icicles and by the time Castiel left the elevator on the fiftieth floor, he couldn’t feel his fingers.
"Just means that he loves you, Dean. Dorothy does the same thing to me, actually. If I cut my finger, she complains about sharpening the knife too much. If I burn the toast, she takes it upon herself for distracting me. It's always like that because they're just soft for us and maybe it could get annoying at times, but I don't let it bother me."
"Maybe…who knows. Truth is…I want you to myself after what just happened between us," said the older man, rubbing his wet cheeks onto Dean's hair. "I wanted to hold you without an audience around us, to smell you, overwhelm myself by you and sink my mind into the actuality that we're now…"
By the time they were back in the car, in their dry clothes without their boxers though, the silence between them was peaceful. It contained so much love. Literally every second spent inside the car, gazing out at the glassy surface of the lake, they both realized that they had done something that had slowly fixed their pieces back together. And it wasn't just the sex. No. It was so much more for Cas.
“Guys!” came Claire’s shrilling voice from downstairs, “I don’t like to be kept waiting, okay? Stop making out and come down now!”
“I’m not,” he protested in a heavy whisper whilst Castiel strategically stretched out on the grass directly opposite the younger man, and those green eyes carefully scrutinized the woman settled by his side. “I’m just wondering who the hell she is and why she’s here.”
If he could have seen her now. Hanna. He would possibly flare up, spittle flying. But then his glasses would fog up from the fumes of his rage. And she would escape, slithering away like the snake she was.
It sounded so simple.
"It's my major actually," Dean offered a shrug and a lopsided grin and feeling all too flustered from his actions being embraced as humorous, he sighed. "So, you got the message loud and clear then? Or do you need me to draw a picture…"
“Yeah,” Dean sighed and shrugged because it was like one heavy weight after another resting on his chest and deserving to be lifted off, “so you’re not mad at me for laying back on the truth…”
“How was it?” Ruby sounded too pleased for him to disconnect the call and blame the network’s faulty signal.
"You forced my hand!" Cas returned heatedly, fists clenching. "Did you expect me to stick around so that you could constantly use me as your punching bag?"
“Is that all?” Sam teased, signaling the waitress. “I mean, you must be past the hugging stage at this point.”
complement each other."
"Fuck," breathed Dean, gasping from the raw contact and rolling his hips forward. "Cas, suppose someone…finds us?"
"I did," Dean offered a constipated look, spreading out his arms. "I said thanks, didn't I?"
"I know," the angel said softly, lightly caressing the other man's face. "You have nothing to feel guilty for. I check up on her and Ben once and awhile. Just because I know that you still care." When Dean stared at him in awe, Cas smiled. "They're doing just fine. She's happy. She's married now and very contented."
“It was…phenomenal.”
Cas could feel all of the hunter behind him. "My heart screaming?"
"Sweetheart," she squeezed his hands between her soft ones, imploring the depth of her words to come, "it matters when your eyes sparkle when you look at him. I want that sparkle to always be there."
Meg sighed. "Alright, Clarence. Be like that."
"Dean, it's not a puppy," Cas frowned. But Dean sounded so domestic. Almost as if they were already a couple and the idea of welcoming a pet into their lives wasn't quite going to cut it.
― Edward Ferrars,
"You're not a failure, Cas."
“Cool,” Dean swallowed and tried to search for something else to say but he was indeed backed into a corner. And very much overwhelmed still, after their dance and the feel of their bodies reacting to each other. “Good night then…” he suddenly heard himself saying, reaching for the lamp next to him, Dean turned it off and left them with the soft glow of the hall light through the slices of space between the roof and walls and the warm yellow from the lamppost outside his window.
“Please God, save me from this hellish demon,” he whispered in prayer.
expecting the arrival of the older man and tucking into bed with the copy of Seventeen, he was just contemplating on where to paste the full-page photo of Taylor Swift when soft knocks sounded on the door.
Castiel sighed though as the soft instrumental music drifted from the speakers above them and the air smelled tangy from the oranges. "Why is it that men can persistently hit on a woman, until they get a satisfactory response…and you're quick to shake me off despite your claims that you're highly interested in me?"
"You sit your damn self down before I tan your hide," Donna scolded immediately. "It's too early. We haven't even cut the cake as yet."
"You ever give a…woman your number and she never texted or called?" he asked the man by his side.
“Kiss and makeup,” the Empty said smiling, swelling with pride as if things happened its way and Billie was the unfortunate one. “And don’t die during this war, Clarence. I don’t want to see you ever again.” And just like that, the room was spared one and after Billie realized that she was pressured to say something in return, she sighed.
“Yeah,” he made quite a mistake by allowing his eyes to wander to the Novak’s estate and when Charlie highlighted the reflexive scrutiny, she instantly settled on the substance of their discussion. “I’m not even sure that I’ll ever get married or have kids because I don’t think that I’m cut out for that.”
"See, the two of you are already a couple, so, it wouldn't be a double date exactly. Plus, I need to at least give her a heads up that my brother and my best friend are together before I invite her anywhere."
Dean never did anyone anything wrong to deserve such punishments. He was so good to everyone, like an angel with such a huge heart, loved children, wanted to become a teacher, he never skipped church on Sundays, had wanted to rejoin the Bible Club and choir, maintained his visits to the villagers and had conversations with them. He learned about their lives and tried to help in any way he could, wasn't even finished with his degree…
They sat there in solace for a while, admiring the light afternoon wind playing with the curtains. The whispers in the trees and the dance of the weeds like a thick carpet leading back to the castle. The soft lapping of the water on the edge of the river. And the pealing of a bell somewhere in the distance.
Fingers entwined, Dean pressed in a little more, trying to allow his body the sense of touch…to determine whether he was capable of physically reacting to the other man. "It's like you just…turned on something inside of me…you're driving me crazier now that I can…feel you."
It was a gesture that didn't quite go unnoticed by Dean, whose eyes flicked to the angel's kissable mouth and suddenly, he was hard in his pants. Suddenly, he realized that there was this aggressive streak that originated from a fire burning within him to literally crawl across the map table. To grab Cas' beautiful face containing his blue, ocean eyes and to crush their lips together.
Castiel’s heart was melting from the younger Winchester’s disbelief in his ability to tend to his baby. When he considered the two brothers across the table, he detected nothing but honesty and love and it was something that he related to with his own brothers but between Sam and Dean, there was something more; something, perhaps deeper than he would ever understand.
"Thank you for checking up on them," he finally said, never wanting to let go of the one person who would go above and beyond to ensure that he was happy. "That means the world to me."
The heat escaping through Dean's pores was sensational and it dizzied Castiel's head when the Prince turned him just a little. But enough so that they were looking into each other's eyes. And Castiel remembered gazing into those eyes and becoming amazed by the swirls of different emerald shades, by the way Dean's thick eyelashes fluttered and his hair.
Blue eyes turned to stare at the Prince in awe. "Do you really?"
"Geez, don't be nervous. Actually, that's why I came with the car," Sam cleared his throat and affectionately patted the other man on his back. "I thought you would be. So, I came to personally assure you along the way that my mother is the softest, kindest woman you will ever meet."
“Dean…”
find anything wrong with this?" Dean pulled away to connect their eyes. "Don’t you get it? I'm…saying that I'm…that I have feelings…for…Cas."
"Fine, Dean," Castiel said softly, and he swallowed before inhaling, then casting his stare out of the window. "Have it your way. I wish not to sour the mood between us since it seems like I am always the spoilsport."
Castiel:
And now, Dean’s pillow was wet, so wet, that he tossed it onto the floor, curled up in a ball and he did the one thing he was always good at.
The angel's chest heaved. "I do."
"And that's really why you keep drinking whisky and hoping," Amanda said. "I just don't understand how he could be so selfish to not even give you a chance to explain. Like who does that? He must have been hurt even before he ran away. Or he probably lied to you about how he felt. Like, he really never loved you because if he did, he wouldn't have left and never come back."
But London.
“Well, I don’t agree because I feel it’s unfair that we can’t control who we fall for and then when it happens, we’re mostly left disappointed. And besides,” Dean studied Castiel’s fingers idly playing with the blanket next to his elbow, “it’s not like you’re in love to feel bad about it, are you?”
Only in the newspapers business, Castiel was one of the 'Lead Journalists' which basically gifted him with his own office, printer and laptop. A decent view of New York Central Park. A bookcase crammed with magazines, Readers Digest, The Economist and newspapers from around the globe. And on his polished wooden desk, there was an antique lantern he had bought from a shop in Maine, three pens lined up with precision: red, blue and black.
"Because all these years, so many distractions from Heaven and Hell were keeping us apart," Cas contributed. He sipped on his beer and bit his lips.
Inexperienced and very much a little embarrassed that he could not relate to his friend's stories, the only other choice was to listen to the elaborated details of what
“I’m such a big kid,” Dean plopped down onto the soft mattress and tugged the blankets around him with a wide smile. “You know, when we were younger, Sam and I had sleepovers inside each other’s rooms and we would imagine that we were somewhere far away. We read scary stories and used flashlights and sometimes we would creep around Westfordshire and it would feel like an adventure.”
Cas laughed, his hair tussled and his blue eyes on fire.
“More along the lines of ‘think before you act, Dean’,” he tried to mimic his father’s deep voice, “and ‘don’t you dare screw this up with Cas because I knew Cas before you were even born’. So, yeah, that pretty much hit me deeper than him talking about sex. Which I don’t mind because I don’t want my dad talking to me about sex. He tried when I was like thirteen and failed until Ellen had to take over. Not sure I ever want to remember him referencing sticking a nozzle into a car to describe the whole act…” Dean smiled at Castiel doubling over in laughter, “Man, it was so funny, Sammy told me years after that he heard the whole conversation and wanted to know if babies came from cars.”
By then, Meg and Castiel were leaning into every word. Both of them were holding their breaths.
“I like her. She’s…” when Dean sighed, Cas stared back incredulously, “…hey, I work in a supermarket with drones that don’t know the
"Thanks," Amanda brushed a few strands of blonde hair behind an ear and nodded. "I wish you luck with whoever that someone is. A guy with your looks shouldn't be chasing anyone. They should be chasing you."
“Damn,” he said before zipping his mouth shut. Dean picked up his beer, drank long and hard and then settled the bottle onto the table. “They always say that the polished ones got a ton of secrets, freak in the sheets and all too. So I’ve got to keep asking, because I’m getting real interested in you—”
“Deprived of sex, huh?” Dean latched onto the mention of that and smiled in good humor. Teasing Castiel was enlightening every single evening after dinner. “Guess both of us are sailing on the same boat then.”
"She never got too close to anyone," Jenny Jenkins frowned whilst sorting through many flattened boxes labelled and ready for the factory belt. "She always had her walls up and I kept asking her to at least go out with the others. Have a few drinks with them but Kelly never did. She was more invested in pushing people away than forming a bond, you know?"
"I've heard worst. Cupcake. Apple. Hitler. Donald…"
“Cas, he’s so dreamy and genuine, I’m always good at judging people and Sam’s never said a bad thing about his brother. Okay, so maybe he hangs out with a gang of dicks but that doesn’t mean that he’s one.”
"I screwed up, alright?" The older Winchester raised his voice, slammed the glass down on the table and rose up weakly. "I pushed aside every damn thing that he's ever done for me, all the times he's helped me heal myself, how he saved my life. And I abused him with every single hurtful thing I could find inside of me. Because why? Because I'm so freaking weak, I can't even love myself so how in the world could I love another person? How could I make a relationship work when I don't even have friends or I've never been able to make any other relationship last in my life?"
with a guy.”
When Dean’s exams were over in a matter of four days, he was sitting in the living room facing the comfortable fire when a few hurried knocks sounded on the front door. Frowning, he rose up and discovered that no other than Charlie rushed in, eager to present good news and somehow trying to hold back enough to ask after his health and exams.
The worst part of it all was Castiel taking Jo into his library when he was never fortunate enough or privileged. He asked her to borrow his books, in fact, he
“I’m so tired all of a sudden,” Jess said quietly, handing over the baby to his father that was staring wide-eyed at everyone.  “I think I’ll get the twins to bed early. You men have a good one. And remember Sam, don’t stick your nose into something that doesn’t involve you.”
so…what do you mean by different?”
If he could just take back his statements, rewind time and pluck those ignorant lines out of the air, then maybe such a foolish display would never have happened.
"Oh! How about ghost stories?" Charlie piped up and again, she tugged her friend back into the present because he was sailing somewhere in the ocean alone and saddened. "How about we pretend we're around a campfire?"
. Equal roles. I like it. And it’s better that way too because then things get a lot spicy when you fight each other for the top.”
When he answered the call though, Castiel wasn’t prepared for who was on the other end. And after their brief greeting and Annalise asking if he could spare her some time to talk, he wandered towards the window seat. But although the view beyond the panes was breathtaking with the sky splashed pink and orange, he couldn’t even find the beauty.
“Are you sure that you aren’t a Prince?” I asked in a soft tone. “I don’t even want to know what it costs to rent a room in there. I’ve never been in a place like that so it’s nice to know that my boss is a wealthy celebrity.”
I took his hand and shook it. “I’m Castiel Novak. It’s an honor to meet you.” I’m shaking a celebrity’s hand! Do not hyperventilate.
"I can't live without you," Castiel's voice was reduced to a throaty quality and he nuzzled his face deeper into the scent of Irish Spring. "When I'm away from you all I can feel is an emptiness that is so painful. When you were lying in that hospital…motionless…I thought I was going to lose you and every single part of me started to die because there is no me without you, Dean."
“Why are you so upset?” Castiel smiled, clearly humored by the reaction. “It’s all for fun. There’s no harm in that and you’ve never believed in any of it before so why would your feathers be ruffled now?”
"You acted just as any sibling would. In fact, as I think about it, my brother Gabriel did the same thing when I was going to marry my ex-wife. He warned me that she was bad news and that she was reckless and wouldn't settle for contentment with someone like me. And he did it because he loves me. Also, he was right."
"Do you?" the older man croaked, his fists balled and heart hammering until he was weakened. "Do you really
“Screw you,” Dean held onto the doorframe and studied the two faces of Sam. “I’m not a lightweight.” Then entering the washroom, he slowly approached the urinal, chuckling to himself. “I could do twelve beers and it wouldn’t do nothing.” Dean smiled at the tiled green walls and studied the graffiti. “Well, good for you, Susie,” he said after reading
Then he walked to his neatly made bed and did as Cas told him because it wasn’t like the other requests. Cas never wanted to do weird stuff like other men, he was always one of the normal ones, quiet and normal. Dean had done so much weird stuff with those demented other clients, but Cas was always a comforting highlight of his work and he was always happy to see him. Yeah, you could just hear his heart screaming that this guy, quiet and yet demanding, was something special.
After his mobile began to chirp, he welcomed the distraction from staring at a brick wall of an article.
“So, it will only happen when you’re happy?” Jack awkwardly considered Castiel as a light wind swept up soft tendrils of his hair. “The deal with the Empty, I mean.”
Castiel welcomed the pleading green orbs and sighed. The table fell silent, awaiting his verdict. “In all honesty, based on my limited experience, I have no choice but to disagree but I will admit that there is something about your kiss that always blows my mind.”
Dean couldn’t deny that an abundance of distractions turned up during the week, and quite enough to heighten the belief that life in Littleton could be quite eventful although most people thought otherwise.
"But you had sex with Anna," Cas said in flat tone as he avoided eye contact and chewed on his steak. "And everything was functioning just fine with her vessel."
as Ellen loved to tease, this wasn’t the motive. Instead, he wandered the aisles and after failing to locate the redhead, was about to reach for a copy of Seventeen when a tiny hand covered in all sorts of rings snatched it before he did.
But suddenly after discovering that the older boy showed a reasonable amount of interest in him, Castiel still couldn’t shake the sense of paranoia from developing. He felt unworthy, almost like an undeserving toy that Dean probably picked up to play with and would then discard of soon enough.
Collecting her photo book from the pink satchel, Charlie avoided his protests about being contagious and settled on the bed next to him. From there, the two of them assessed the very neat scrawls of her quotes that mainly focused on love but there was an underlying theme which piqued Dean’s interests.
Very soon though, the sky burst with the promised rains and the windows clouded for quite a while. Thunder accompanied the streaks of lightening, and although Dean seldom contributed to the conversation, he only wished for the weather to settle enough so that they could leave.
"Cas, come on," Dean was blushing so deeply, he evidently caused the angel to adore him a little more, if that was even possible. "You know what I mean…"
"Dude, if he's told you about his obsession over that, then he really must love you. Come," Sam gestured for the other man to follow him.
“Well I’ve purchased your gift two months ago and it has been well hidden in the bunker since then, so maybe I might add another if I find something. I need to buy something for Sam…”
After the five of them ended up in a generous conversation focused on many topics that flowed effortlessly, the rest of the room entertained themselves with the abundance of drinks and food. And no matter how distracting everything around them proved to be, there was one thing that kept bringing them back together over and over again.
“If I ask the same thing that I did before, you think that you can give me an answer now?” when the older man refrained from providing a reply, Dean’s chest pained from the absence of words. “Cas, we talk about everything. There’s nothing that you can’t tell me, no matter how painful, or terrible or hurtful it is. I’ll always rely on you to know the truth about things.”
“Hi, Ketch, all’s well?” Dean bumped fists with the man as if they were long time partners in crime.
“Believe me, it is
Wherever Sam received his information from, perhaps the person had the misfortune of listening to gossip because Castiel never mentioned anything pertaining to such a subject. Had he been smitten over anyone, then wouldn’t Dean be the first to become aware of it? Perhaps when you resided in a place such as New Hampshire, conversations grew dull after a while and could only become interesting if one tended to partake in an abundance of lies.
"Listen to me," Mary said softly, lifting his chin. "I'm not going to ask you if he loves you again because I think to more than fifty people in the room and a large amount of England, by now we're all convinced that there's something happening between the two of you. But Dean, if he doesn't want to entertain your feelings, and he shuns you, then you need to step back. I don't want you chasing after a man, risking everything you have already, to have your heart broken. You've always deserved to live the best fairytale when it comes to love." She patted his face and smiled.
"Cas! Are you…" staring, bewildered… "Are you sure?"
"Huh?" Dean's eyes widened.
Castiel was sinking into a softness that he wished not to experience. A look in Dean's eyes? What look? He fought against his mind to admit that he loved Dean's eyes but his heart won.
The hunter smiled as his chest swelled. “Likewise, Cas.”
“Your Majesty,” Castiel met Sam’s eyes by the window.
"Cas, what are you talking about, man?" Dean frowned, his throat closing up from the choice of words that began to scratch upon his skin, causing him to worry immensely. "So far, you've given me more than I've ever dreamt about. There's nothing else that I want right now except you."
"You best be sure of that once finals roll around because I'm going to scrape off the slackers and toss them out the door." And returning to writing neatly on the board about promotion preps, she continued in a brisk manner until midday. “As a matter of fact, Dean, I’m going to lay a paper on you just for your insolence. Write me a marketing proposal on any event that
“Huh?” Dean stared back, wondering why his brain felt like he was running on overdrive.
"Right, and when's the wedding?" Donna, hands planted on her hips smiled around. "Give us a heads up when you can. Peachy. Very peachy." She scooped baby Dean into her arms and he screamed from delight after being lifted high in the air.
“I’m really going to miss it,” she seemed saddened, hands resting on her lap. Their eyes met. “By now I guess you’ve heard of the wedding being called off.”
Although he wished not to dwell on those thoughts, Dean wondered if Castiel was relaxed enough to allow his hand to wander. If his hands
"But he was stealing from the freaking collection basket. That should count as a criminal charge that sticks and what the hell happened to the pig who squealed in the first place? This mysterious person we don't know about. You mean to tell me that whoever it is couldn't make it substantial enough to stitch the bastard up good?"
Dean’s laughter into the crook of Castiel’s shoulder was musical. “I’m sorry but that’s the way I am. I like tasting you and marking you because when I look at you, I want to be reminded that this wasn’t a dream inside my head. And that I have you and I can keep having you just as you’ll keep having me.”
"Corentyne River, South America," he said in greeting, his voice reminding Sam of Dean's top five things he loved about the guy. "If you look closely, you can see the fatigued fisherman casting his net several times in attempt to catch catfish. I've been sitting here for over an hour and he still hasn't filled his cooler."
I don’t like you. I don’t like you. You’re taller by like three inches and irritable and annoying and grumpy and badly in need of sex. Or! Perhaps you should learn about the wonders of using your hands on yourself because reaching a climax is so relieving. To you it might seem beneath you to touch yourself, but I think that you’re badly in need of release.
How immature would that be to reveal an inclination towards the older man arising from physical awakenings of soft kisses on his neck?
"Huh?" Dean stared, immediately growing cold after collecting the phone.
"You're toying with me. I get it now. How could I be so stupid?" Castiel laughed bitterly and felt his heart crack in many places. "You're only doing this, trying to wind me up, to help you fuel your hatred towards your family. Your father."
It wasn’t until the two of them ran into engine problems and stalled at a gas station, when he groaned from the four hours delay. And after he and Sam sat down to munch on beef jerky and slices of pies, the afternoon welcomed them on a highway bordered by snow.
“Soon,” Dean smiled ear to ear and sent a cheerful wave at the crowds gathered behind them. “Hey, listen, if I forget any part of my vows—”
to date her, Cas. I’m asking you as your best friend
“But procreation, Dean,” Castiel’s eyes implored understanding, “don’t you want that with someone? Don’t you want to produce an heir to the throne?”
"In what context? Generally, or in regards to us?"
“Please talk to me,” Cas pleaded, rising from the chair and approaching the other man. He perched himself on the edge of the table, immediately in front of Dean’s form. “Let me in.”
"No," Dean collected his phone and keys from the table. "I was kind of hoping that I could take you for a drive. There's this place that I found that has a fantastic view. You're going to love it. And to be honest, this place is kind of getting to me. It's too dark and I'm feeling claustrophobic."
Who was the lucky woman? And he hated that he felt so damn calm so fast as the medication kicked into overdrive.
me that well to ascertain that I'm special, right? We're just strangers crossing paths."
“Opinion biased much?” she raised her eyebrows and the two of them studied each other intently, then after turning to look at Castiel directly, the bluntness was delivered. “I can’t believe for one second that you didn’t know mom was pregnant with me. How can that even happen after the two of you were married and obviously around each other?”
"I intend to do no such thing."
"Dean, dad's gone now," Sam reminded his brother in a tone that reflected pain. "His opinion about you doesn't matter anymore than should be necessary. He was acting like any parent would. Defensive. I remember when he used to taunt you about your interest in playing the guitar and piano. Or when you were obsessed over Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing. But we're living our lives now. He's not here. And there's no one to judge you but yourself."
"Yeah, just the awkward kid who had a crush on you. What happened at that bonfire…tore us apart in ways that I can never forgive myself for and it's good to see you after all these years so that I can tell you that truly, I'm sorry. I really am, Dean."
," Castiel sighed. "It wasn't. It couldn't be."
kind of conversation at lunch,” Castiel could literally feel the warmth creep up his neck and onto his face. Then it suddenly dawned upon him that maybe Gabriel and Ruby were two peas in a pod. “By all means, let’s examine my sex life.”
London was bitter cold already and he detested that a longtime hatred towards the sun was now a daunting feeling; the ball of orange wasn't in sight and it was barely after lunch.
“Here I am sitting all alone, falling in love with him and he thinks that I don’t feel the same way, huh?” Dean leaned into Ellen’s shoulder and she pressed a kiss onto his cheek. “Can life ever be fair? I keep thinking about the age difference too. He’s twenty years older than me which means when I’m barely sixty, he’ll be eighty-five and it sucks because I was born a little too late.”
“Fuck,” Ruby stared at the smudged words as if an alien was forming on the desk.
Dean was holding his breath as he kept reading the words over and over again. As he tried to find the part that didn’t hurt the most between Cas’ words. But every single line stabbed him in his gut because maybe being distant at times provided Cas with enough room to doubt his worth.
"No, I just –"
Blue eyes lowered and Castiel shook his head as he swallowed. “No, Dean. After so much time, I’m absolutely certain that I’m attracted to you as more than just a man admiring another as a friend. Can you spare me from elaborating?” he offered Dean a conflicted look that was entirely adorable to the younger man, “I wish not to make you uncomfortable and I’d save myself the embarrassment.”
"Aww! Like a kitty?" her green eyes widened and became sparkly and despite her decision to avoid becoming too invasive, she wished to learn more.
Just as the afternoon was fading a little more, the car nosed its way down a narrow road that gradually opened out on both sides by expansive lawns. Lawns that were lush and green and beautiful. Then after the large wrought iron gates slid open, Castiel suddenly sat up and couldn't believe his eyes.
“Sure,” he reached out and softly caressed her pink streak that always suggested that she was rebellious enough to deviate from the norm of society. “Anything you want to know, I’m here for you, man. You know that.”
“Then let’s try hard to restrain ourselves,” Dean captured Castiel’s shoulders in his grasp and tugged him in. “Come here, I want to feel you inside your work attire. Have I ever told you how beautiful you look in long sleeves and tailored pants?”
Brooke on the other hand had stayed in touch because she was the kind of woman who could smell a heartbroken man a mile away like Amanda. And she felt that it was her duty to fix him by constantly checking up on how he was doing and if he wanted to hang out.
The King’s smile widened miraculously and he chuckled. “That’s like asking me to choose between my right or left hand to amputate! I think that I’ve watched each one obsessively and I’m not ashamed to admit it. Norris can fight the fight whilst the Hoff has the style. What about you?”
"No, Dean," Cas provided in a softer tone, "the only thing I excelled in was loving and protecting you at all costs. And if I must continue doing that without being an angel, then I don't care. Why are you so against the idea of being my boyfriend?"
with those and for the most part of it, I think he would be grateful if I just gave him a box of teabags but, I can’t do that because this Christmas is more special than any other one for us.”
“Just so you know, I
“It’s overrated,” Rowena said with a dulled look.
Immediately he straightened up and cleared his throat. And the one thing Castiel remembered experiencing in that moment was nervousness. Quite unlike any other in his career. Because he never was afraid to ask questions. He had interviewed snobbish businessmen, and hammered sex offenders without remorse. But now, Dean's gaze locked on him was more than unnerving.
"Cas—" Dean sounded so softer now, almost apologetic. "That's not what I meant."
"But you saw behind Sam's façade."
. I guess he’s just too fatigued from yesterday.”
stand a chance when he really wasn't so special after all. Psychotic, obviously, but if Dean continued to think that way about every single person he thought as a potential love interest, then he would end up turning his fears into the truth like Lisa all over again. And Lisa was very much sweet and respectable until she tied him up, and left him shackled to her bed wearing nothing but a pair of red lace panties for her roommate to see.
Dean, in front of my eyes, I swear to the moon, leans in so close to Cass, and he says something that causes Cass to blush so deep, I never thought it was possible for his face to turn that color. Then doing that playful giggle that is only given to chicks he flirts with, Dean literally claps Cass on his ass and heads my way where I’m hiding.
"Oh, Dean…"
"Done what?" Cas asked, frowning now.
Maybe he wasn’t ashamed of his desires, at least dreaming of touching Dean wasn’t wrong. Castiel didn’t believe he was ready to go there with anymore for a long time maybe but at least he could have enough room to wonder and hope and fantasize. And because his dreams were so sexual in nature, the next morning when his alarm sounded at six thirty, Castiel woke up after a long time very hard inside his pants and therefore very contented as he hopped into the shower and used Dean’s imagined hands on himself instead of John Travolta’s.
“Because I’ve seen him hold onto one relationship and everything else has been impulsive and none of them has lasted longer than two days,” Cas couldn’t quite elaborate due to the fact that he felt doubts rather deeper than any explanation would provide.
As he pulled up in front of the Burger Palace, Sam got out and smiled to himself. No wonder love was oftentimes described as a tragedy in most literature. His brother was the perfect example of the effects of a brutal love hitting him so hard like a hurricane, all his walls had been knocked down and now he was simply swimming in the pangs of warmth. Of having nothing to burden him down. No expectations. Nothing.
“He’s a
“Because I’ve never done it before?” Castiel’s intention wasn’t to sound too offended but Dean read a little too much between the question.
By the time he was tucked in bed with the BBC news on the television, Castiel had made up his mind. But then when the Top Stories were brushed through one by one, his interest was piqued further by the mention of a new scandal from the Royal Family.
“What the hell is this?” he suddenly considered the pile of files stacked next to my laptop and scowled. “Are these…” after picking up one of the folders, he parted it to reveal the contents, “…subscriptions? Why are you two handling subscriptions?”
And sinking into the chair by the window afterwards, Dean listened to the rain and he stared through the haze of it, feeling cold, and stunned.
“Dean,” he said softly, and he bit his lips to hold back the tears.
Dean’s laughter was so musical, low and contained inside his throat. “Ass reference so not helping right now, love. I’ll be downstairs at five. Cheers then.” And with a small wave, the Prince ducked into The Hub.
Immediately, Castiel melted into Dean’s arms, burying his face deeper into the other man’s neck and never wanting to let go.
“Are you gay?” Jo suddenly asked whilst considering the side of his face and brushing her knuckles over a light stubble.
“Brother,” Lee couldn’t contain his excitement as he tugged the two of them away into a corner and faced Dean with mild fascination, “I wasn’t expecting this at all. Not that I’m judging you. Of course, I’d never judge you. But this is such a shocker to me that you’d actually end up with a guy and not just any guy. He looks…” after considering Castiel again, who was entertaining a conversation with the cashier in hushed tones, Lee shook his head, “like a fucking Prince. He’s got to be filthy rich judging from his damn coat and shoes. My friend, you hit the fucking jackpot.”
“Yes,” Castiel nodded and never diverted his probing gaze, “you
He scrutinized the view of Central Park behind his desk through the wall of glass and felt contented that the weather was still rainy. He loved rainy weather. Bleak weather. Anything except the sun.
But the silence was there again. It always creeped up like an inky blackness between them and tried to choke him slowly. And it was like losing all hope all over again. Of running into an alleyway and hitting a brick wall. He was fucking frightened. Dean couldn't believe it. He chopped off vampires' heads, raided nests. He fought werewolves and a shitload of monsters. And now he was afraid to say something. Anything.
“Dammit!” he kept pacing the space where Baby had been parked, emerald eyes flashing everywhere. “One of us should have waited in the car! Son of a bitch!”
Castiel was too impressed by the older boy latching onto the quote. Apparently National Geographic magazines were the tip of the iceberg. “Wow, so you
I didn’t understand what was happening between us because his lack of communication was bruising me and sending out alarms that my mind couldn’t really process.
Both of them turned to stare at Dean, eagerly awaiting an answer that perhaps seemed to be stalled by a refusal to contribute. And not a word was offered within two minutes, so Claire directed a smug look at Charlie.
Impressed, Dean nodded whilst unconsciously staring up at the ceiling. Arms folded behind his head; he couldn’t imagine a life much better than the one he was experiencing.
Dean waited, admiring the other man's profile as the setting sun touched his hair. "What?"
Dean, unaware of it, began drifting towards the man standing by the pull up banner advertising a new brand of vitamins that were supposed to make your hair grow faster. He couldn’t understand why he was drawing closer, why a small smile tugged at his lips, why his chest was filled with a variety of butterflies, but he continued as if not in control of his body. And after those pools of blue were so close, after Dean realized that he was instantly drowning in them, a warmth buried deep inside his gut becoming too beautiful, he blinked slowly.
“Beauty and the Beast. I feel like I have so much in common with the beast because being bipolar makes me feel like I’m not worth it and I’m ugly. Then I have this huge library and I live inside a huge castle all alone like he does. And you basically came to me from another realm and I wanted to trap you by forcing you to stay.”
“And so we begin,” a man who slightly resembled Richard Gere presented himself in front of the room and smiled. “Hopefully this remote works…” he pointed the slim device at the projector and the slide changed. “Fantastic! Alright, welcome to the annual conference on environmental protection hosted by the…”
Dean smiled warmly. “Jody and the brood got settled in?”
"Did you eat?" there was the sound of china clinking on Cas' end.
“Mmhmm, I…remember you,” Castiel swallowed hard when the front of his pants was touched tenderly and then the sound of the zipper being undone sliced in the room like the warning sound to a disaster. “I miss you too.”
Dean did the same. He shrugged. "She was planning our wedding too. Had this scrap book she started with all these notes on what cake we should get and finger foods, and champagne. You name it."
After two rings, Dean answered and his groggy tone suggested that he was really affected by a cluster of emotions. “Wish I was there with you, Cas,” he said softly, “I left at lunch and came right home. Slept like two hours, drank a few beers and then napped again.”
Castiel was relentless, that much was obvious from the intense gaze, delving past disarming to completely controlling. From there, his hands sought out the younger man’s shoulders, pinning him like the most beautiful butterfly for those blue eyes alone to drown in. And he arched himself inwards, rolling their hips together before completely clinging to composure and marveling over how he was reacting.
"Hey watch your mouth!" Jody tugged on her arm.
“If you’re thinking that we slept together, then we didn’t!” she said quickly, springing off the bed and leaping towards the door to press it close. The two of them stared at each other. “Listen, okay?” she tried to gather his hand into hers but Dean pulled away as if he had been burnt. “My name’s Amanda,” she said holding her hands up defensively. “Shit, I don’t expect you to remember what happened last night because you were wasted but before you head out thinking you did the worst thing ever, I just want you to know that we didn’t have sex.”
“Man, I’ve never been to one but Sammy has,” Dean sighed as the rain lightened but thunder rolled above them. “I need to go out more, you know, like old times when I was in high school. We used to spend a lot of time at that place down in High Street. Think it’s still there. And I used to watch Sammy get into fights over pools and darts and had to fetch him home after he got too high to have a conversation with anyone. Wouldn’t say that it was the good old days because it wasn’t my kind of place but the best part was just hanging out and chilling and being away from school and all the drama.”
"You forget that I am also Queen and I hold an equal amount of power as your father," Mary reminded him in a certain tone. "If there is anything that you want, and your heart desires it, I will always keep fighting for you. I've always told you, Dean, that your beliefs are justified by how pure your heart is. There is no shame in wanting to fall in love with someone before you marry them."
“He didn’t need to say it. I said enough to frighten him into declining the offer,” Castiel sighed and studied his splayed fingers.
“That’s easy for you to say. You’re the one who looked after me since I was a baby. At least you know plenty about changing diapers and burping and…you’re a natural with kids.”
Slipping the gold band onto the King’s finger, Castiel swallowed and maintained their gaze. “I love you too.”
“Yes?” Castiel said softly, his voice barely a whisper, “I’m here for as long as you want me to be but you need to relax. You need to--”
"You okay? You look pasty. Do you want to sit down?"
. Can you imagine?” Sam seemed more enthusiastic about it. “Everything he has ever wanted; he can get now. And that includes you, you lucky bastard.”
Castiel couldn't contain himself, he simply used his voice through every thrust until his eyes were filled with tears. Until he buried his face into Dean's neck and bit down hard, choking on his body's anticipated climax. Over and over again they rocked into each other, experiencing a very new position that was entirely strategic and intimate.
“Come here,” Dean didn’t await a response but shifted closer, wrapped an arm around the other man and tugged him in. “Don’t feel like that. If there’s one person who thinks you’re worthy and warm inside, it’s me. And you shouldn’t blame yourself for what happened between you and Claire. The part that hurts the most is that Claire is in denial. I think she loves you and wants to give you a second chance but she’s scared.”
He discovered after their well spent afternoon though, that Sam’s idea of a good time, just like the old days, was knocking a few beers at a prestige club called The Boardroom, dimly lit and entertaining an elite crowd. Now this wouldn’t have come as a surprise to him if he honestly tugged his heart out of a pit of feels and latched onto his brother’s intentions.
"No," Rowena remembered what was revealed to her in their last session. "He never said such a thing. He perhaps revealed that he is not attracted to you sexually but he never said that doesn't want you in his life."
He wasn't.
"Flowers," Claire cut him off, staring, "preferably carnations that are light red or white because those are his favorite. And chocolates! Get him Reese's cups because he likes peanut butter. Dean, you're such a—"
"Shouldn't have mixed wine with whisky. Come on, you big baby" Dean draped an arm around the tired bundle and pushed open the door behind him, then slowly they both managed to assist each other out of the Impala. "Cas, you got to walk, okay? I'm not so strong to do it on my own."
real," Jess drew nearer in all smiles, still wearing a pink apron with bright yellow sunflowers printed on the front. And jerking her chin at the two young people, she silently assured them that the trio would be tended to. "You two can go do all the gossiping you want without looking after my soccer team."
“BBC is on and Princess Annalise is in the goddamn headlines,” she squished him into a hug. “Let’s wait and see.” After sometime though, she pressed a kiss onto his cheek. “It will be alright, Cassie Cas. It will get better.”
“Names?”
"As a matter of fact, I am!"
"No!" Castiel cried into the younger man's neck, pushing himself into the warmth they were creating and perhaps riding on a wave of sadness and frustration. "I'm…utterly conflicted right now and I hate the bad conversations and the glares and holding my breath and feeling like I'm failing and—"
"Yeah?" Dean smiled before reaching for the curl of tendrils behind the other man's right ear. "I thought so too."
“That’s just…no way,” Dean shook his head and turned up two matching cards again and this time, Charlie huffed out an impatient sigh. “I don’t buy that at all. It’s the other way around. What the hell is there to worship about
For a long time after, whilst they tried to catch their breath, neither of them said a word. The sky burst outside and the rains came down, thundering onto the roof. The blinds flapped wildly and the bright full moon suddenly looked like a white smudge through the haze of the rain. And still they remained as they were.
“I wonder what Jo thinks of me,” Dean asked suddenly after reaching into the night and tugging at things that could never settle. He blinked slowly and gazed at the lights in the windows of Castiel’s estate. “I was so young and stupid back then, you know?”
"Puppies and cats and Taylor Swift," Ellen said comfortably fixing a blanket around her lap.
"Claire and Kaia?" Dean forked up a cut of ham and pushed it into his mouth then savored the honey taste. Had to be compliments of Ellen who always prepared the best turkey and ham on every occasion.
“First thing I did when I picked up the guitar was that, you know, dabbling around with some songs I remembered. And yeah, I keep going back to my girl Swift, but there’s one song that I really want to play for him. And I hope I get a chance to because it explains so much. By the way, I want to show you something. Come on.”
Dean was aching to be released from the restraints of his jeans and after feeling how long and thick Cas felt inside his goddamn pants, possibly more generously gifted than he was, he wanted to hold him. He wanted to unzip the other man’s pants and feel him between his eager fingers. Most of all, he wanted to see him for the first time and marvel over how perfect he was.
Castiel had been holding his breath for so long that when he finally realized how being deprived of oxygen dizzied his mind, he sucked in enough air to burn his lungs. "I am not proud of myself but the one thing I've been most prideful of is you."
His lips twitched as he stuck the plastic fork into the salad, spearing a carrot and some lettuce. “Thanks. Bring a pack in as well as your lunch and keep me company then.”
“I said too much, didn’t I?” the older man finally managed to ask from behind.
In case you’re wondering, me, Castiel Novak, was assigned as Ruby’s assistant.
"These most definitely must be Dean's collection," Castiel ran his fingers lightly over the spines of Disney movies ranging from Snow White to Frozen 2.
"After meeting your moms, I got the feeling like they didn't approve."
“I’m just helping out…well, Sally. She…” the last thing I wanted was trouble but apparently someone crossed the line. Judging from his demeanor, someone also would pay. “I help out from time to time,” I continued after a long sigh and felt my fingers tremble around my mouse. “She asks and I…well, I don’t have a problem because—”
“I can’t just walk up to him and do it, dammit. I need to think things through and I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about what all of this means.”
remember that we scan all of his documents and store them, right? Or are you still caught up on who I’m screwing…”
“Anyone in their right mind would find you attractive and well-suited!” Castiel leaned in and lowered his voice as if afraid of rousing attention from the older Winchester and Bobby. “Needless to say, my dearest Dean, Charlie would be a fool to dismiss the notion.”
The moans that escaped from within his throat were hoarse and eventually turned into definite cries from pleasure that filled the space like music. And Castiel couldn't keep his hands off of him, fingers digging into Dean's hips to bring them closer together, so close that tears burned the older man's eyes. Tears from contentment and pleasure that forced Castiel to rise up from the bed and collect Dean into his arms and with their legs wrapped around each other, they moved until the creaking of the bed became melodic. Until they buried their faces into each other's necks and tried to muffle their moans when bliss took on the form of release over and over again.
Settling into the chair, he held up the phone between his hands and stared at it for a long time. Until…
“So, you can’t tell Dean how you feel? How fair is that? We have to stop this from happening,” Jack slid off the nose of the car and faced Castiel who could only provide lowered eyes. “Let me talk to Billie about it. She’ll know what to do. Or even better, I can talk to the Empty. We’re working together to defeat Chuck. So, there
“Do you like it?”
Probably it was surprising to Cas but his blue eyes merely reflected barely a flicker of disbelief and a lot of love. And when the hunter inched away whilst still keeping his arms wrapped around Cas' neck, the energy between them still was on fire from the lingering sensation of having finally crossed that line. Of finally breaking the tension by just letting go.
He instantly felt sturdy arms wrap around his waist from behind, hands that were always willing to protect him, forming a ring around his body until his head rose once again and he could breathe. It was reminiscent of when he first brushed their lips together, feeling the sparks between them and coming alive again as if being reborn and maybe the premise of their relationship was always supposed to lead to that moment. When he would suddenly realize that they were meant to be more than friends, and lovers and everything else because he trusted Castiel so much.
“I don’t want you to fall or…lose your grace,” Dean admitted softly. He couldn’t stop gazing at Cas. “Not for me.”
“That’s just the beginning of that fantasy,” Castiel admitted with his back towards the other man.
Dean pulled open the doors to the cabinet where they stored their medicinal supplies. And his fingers lightly brushed the bottle of Prozac that had Sam's name on the label. Then the Xanax. Then the bottle of Advil gel caps.
"So, you think that it's fair."
"You never have to," Castiel tilted his head and smiled. "Even your breasts seem to think the same. One of them almost waved at me a few minutes ago."
He couldn't wait until they were both standing at the altar, exchanging vows and finally being legally married as Mr. and Mr. Winchester…
The pair in the backseat huddled together, and because they quickly understood the magnitude of the scene unfolding, neither uttered a word but held their breaths. Dean though, stared ahead and blinked quickly through his tears that trailed down his face in the shadowed car and swallowing hard, he couldn't look at him because then he would start crying a river.
"Yes.” Castiel nodded, entwining their fingers. “Now I understand why some women rush to have a baby with their lover. Because they simply wish to tie him down, to keep him tethered to their soul forever so that he needs to come back to them. Rita Coolidge elaborated perfectly on my feelings for you when she sang about being the
Most songs reminded him of Dean. The long winding highway reminded him of Journey's song 'Faithfully' and although they had always been meeting each other halfway over the years, now it felt as if he had melted into Dean's existence. Funny enough though, it wasn't completely physical, but it was more like watching a teabag sink into boiling water and the golden color swirl around until the opaqueness was completely overwhelmed. Their love was the teabag in the analogy. The boiling water was the wars and the universe and the chaos.
actually kept searching the entire town for baby growing trees. It was so funny to tease you. Dean I…” Castiel rested his chin on the younger man’s head and smiled as the car nosed its way through the rain, “I have grown to adore you so much over the years. Your companionship means so much to me that I cannot ever live without it.”
Dean lowered his head and with lips bitten, he inhaled deeply.
The reaction unearthed from his older brother was a cautious look. Almost as if Dean was warning him to back off. Not because Dean would throw them onto the ground for a fight. But because the subject was too heavy to broach.
"Borrow him for as long as you want," Jess winked at the older man whilst the others tried to grab at Dean's feet when he stood up, their hands weaving around like snakes. "And take your time."
“Cas?” the hunter stopped moving, and resting their foreheads together, he stared into blue eyes that were suddenly wet from tears. “What’s wrong?”
“That’s Whiskers,” Ruby said eyeing how soft Dean became. “Cas brought her here from New York. She’s the love of his life. So, get used to it.”
“Do you love him?” aunt Marge asked in earnest when the fire in the hearth was low. “Dean. Do you love him?”
Was it alright for him this time? Would he be a burden? Would Dean prefer his own space? All of these questions Castiel asked silently and received the most surprising answer.
“He didn’t want to be with me,” Dean said although tears burned his eyes. He held the bouquet between his thighs and the scent brought on a slight migraine. “I tried so hard to make him stay but he didn’t want to.”
? Inside the depth of water that seemed so inviting because someone else, someone
"And you, your Highness," lacing his fingers together, he tried to take measured breaths. Come on. Keep the calm. The discussion could lead to Dean but that doesn't mean that he couldn't absorb the beauty of the room or the actuality of the invitation.
“And you’re
. What do you want me to do, Dean? Act as if I don't love you enough to worry?"
“Yeah, why?” Dean considered him as the ocean roared all around them.
“You can’t give up, okay?” when he refused to answer me but stayed on the line, I took that as my opportunity to instill some kind of assurance about his well-being. “Life is never easy, and everyone has their own battles to fight. But it doesn’t mean that you can’t cope with yours. You’re so strong and so brave. You’ve come this far, haven’t you? There are people who just never had the faith to keep living through every minute. They needed an anchor and I can be that for you. It doesn’t mean that I have to be there physically but whenever you feel like you’re falling, then I’m just a phone call away.”
"Where the hell do we begin and end?" Sam continued reading. "I'll tell you where," he pointed a finger at Cas. "You began in hell and you ended last week. The way I see it, it was like witnessing a break up between a married couple. For ages I've been getting comfortable with the idea of you two marrying each other and riding into the sunset, me of course, in the backseat. But—"
When she said it, and he finally heard it, the entirety of the truth stunned Dean because he hadn't given it much thought up to that point.
"I think what Castiel's problem is, relates to much more than a simple case of not wanting to look for someone. I think he's the type that needs to be chased by someone. Harassed repeatedly. A major flirt to begin with. England might be a good idea. I've heard that European women are quite bold. They know what they want. They waste no time in respectfully going after what they want. And you, my brother…would be—"
