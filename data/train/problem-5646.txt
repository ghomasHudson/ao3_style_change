What he would give to not be ignored.
“Oh but it is.” A new voice pipes up from the hospital room door and both Tony and the obstetrician look up.
He nods. Something lightens in him when the look of Steve’s face vanishes and is replaced with a look of complete awe.
There was silence. The loud sort of silence that pressed in on you. The kind that spoke volumes and made it clear that there was more going on than a simple question.
“Why not? Everyone of you is here except for him and Namor.”
What if someone gets
“I...I don’t know.” Tony said quietly, sitting back up slowly and suddenly feeling his eyes begin to burn. His head was spinning and he felt really sick suddenly. The world felt like it was going underwater.
“Oh yeah.” Tony scoffed, feeling giddy at the prospect of turning down the offer, no matter how tempted he was. “How high?”
The truck parked up and soon enough the door swung open. Out stepped a large man with multiple tattoos and piercings and a large smirk on his face. The air around him stank of tobacco and Tony nearly threw up from the stench. God.
“A bit more. There we-sir, you’re very tense-“
But Steve was awake. He was
“Let me.” Steve immediately said, stepping forward and reaching out to take Tony’s wrist and inspect it.
A sneer spread across Tony’s face. “You wanted me for the thrill. Let’s be real, our entire time together was only because you got a rush from that. I bet every moment was fun for you, watching your pet vampire run wild down a few alleys.”
"Have you spoken to Steve?" Carol urged, putting her hand on his shoulder like she could see how close he was to breaking. "Should I call him?"
“I’m sorry.” Norman said sincerely, unlocking the door and holding it open. “I know this must be all so...unsettling for you. When I proposed the idea to Ty, I hadn't been sure. But I'm pleased it worked in making Whitney calm down.”
Tony looked at the piece of paper.
“Nay,” grinned Thor. “Rules are rules. Go.”
“That's my AI.... Good, it's done.” Stark quickly put the terminal back together, while Steve wondered what an AI was. Tony stood up and fished two stubby things with loops out of his pocket and handed one to Steve. He watched Tony put the loop around his ear so that the stubby thing was sitting snug against it and moved to copy him.
"Knew what? That Hydra might go for the lab instead of Corbin? That was always a possibility."
Not a good sign.
Tony turned back to Steve.
It was fun watching Steve trying to wrap his brain around that concept. He was trying to do that stoic face thing, but Tony had grown so familiar with it in the last week or so, he could see the little tell tale twitches that betrayed the internal struggle going on. He smirked at Steve and that made his face twitch worse. Then Tony figured he should ask now that Steve was still off balance. His chances of an actual answer might be better that way, dick move that it might be.
“It wasn’t actually alive.” He sounded sullen.
“Right,” said Pepper decisively. “Time to go back to work. Sam, why don't you come with me, R&D wants to pick your brain about the redesign of the Falcon wings.”
“What the hell?!” Steve was appalled. He popped back onto one elbow and looked down at Tony who stared back, obviously surprised at his sudden outburst.
"I don't think I've ever been kissed like that before," he blurted. Tony's step faltered for a moment. And he sounded surprised when he answered: "Me, neither."
and whatever else you think might possibly help and Clint, fire up the quinjet for a medevac. Tony's dying."
Tony threw him a derisive look, before jumping onto his own horse. Which one could only do when not unduly burdened by chain mail, like Steve and Percival.
"And you chose not to tell me." Tony's anger was flat and cold.
"Captain Rogers was very excited to find out that the skating rink still existed. Ms. Romanov insisted they go immediately."
Tony wanted to protest. He felt like a protest was in order, but he really couldn’t think of anything wrong with that idea. Except that he wasn’t going to be the only one with his dick out in this car. He slid his hands to the front of Steve’s pants and fumbled for the button, sorely distracted by the fact that Steve had his hands down Tony’s boxers by now and was shoving them out of the way, one handed. The elastic waistband snapped painfully, yet still somehow tantalizingly, under Tony’s balls. He bit back a curse. By the time he managed to push Steve’s pants down his ass, Steve was already sliding his hand lightly up and down Tony’s cock. He was obviously trying to make it it last longer than 30 seconds and Tony sincerely hoped he wouldn’t disappoint him. He was afraid that at this point he might be able to come from just looking at Steve.  Especially now that he had Steve’s cock in his hand, the familiar feel of it causing a pang in his chest. Steve hissed a sharp breath when Tony started working him, and he faltered for a second, but then he took Tony a little firmer in hand.
Tony expected Rogers to just salute and go sacrifice his lovely hair and his miles of creamy skin for Freedom and the American Way, but the man spoke as he stood up.
. Right. Creaking bed and Steve was not a little loud. Tony almost cracked up again, but everything felt just too good and Steve was covered with a slight sheen of sweat that he wanted to lick off, but couldn’t, because he was on this runaway train and there was no stopping until Tony felt his balls pull tight and then the tingling at the bottom of his spine exploded and his vision went a little gray at the edges. He was pretty he sure he shouted... something.
The man flickered again and for a second Tony thought he saw someone, something, much darker in his place. Something with leathery wings. Something that was licking its lips with an obscenely large and narrow tongue. Tony was grateful for the mask covering his face, because he was sure his eyes had bugged out. What the hell was he up against here?
Sam started laughing at him. "I know, man. I know who you are. I am just messing with you. I'd love for you to take a look at the wings. They're a little temperamental, actually." And with that Sam was Tony's new best friend. He happily trotted off to his workshop with his prize, breakfast forgotten.
“Steve.” He held out the kittens again. “I thought you wanted these.”
Both men spun around and Tony smiled at the sight of Steve in his full Captain America get up striding into the workshop. He must have just returned from his visit to the Children's Hospital, one of the many charities Steve was involved in. It was a good thing Tony had Jarvis quietly screen Steve's calls, or he'd be volunteering for 5 year olds' birthday parties too and Tony would never see him again. Steve was sporting a lopsided smile and his eyes were twinkling behind the cowl. Tony grinned back.
"I think I saw your kittens down there."
“And now?”
I am up for anything.”
Tony eventually comes back and throws himself on the couch with his feet on the armrest. He cracks open a copy of Wicked. Steve stifles a snort and Tony glares at him.
Next he called the caretaker of Howard's Bring-Captain-America-Home-Yay! trust fund. Tony had never met the man, for obvious reasons that involved Daddy Issues, but he disliked the guy at first sight nonetheless, when he finally deigned to make himself available. First of all, Tony had to resort to threats of dire financial repercussions before the man came on the screen. Second of all, his combover was worse than Donald Trump's. It took a few minutes before he'd managed to explain to Tony that the yearly expedition to search for Cap was combined with an Armed Forces polar training exercise. That in fact, the fund just shoved a whole lot of money at said Forces and left everything up to them.
“Okay. This is the plan. We’ll get going here in a minute and then we’ll take the bike to Stark Manor. I need to be there tonight, because I am hosting the traditional Midwinter Celebrations. It’s a big official event for prominent members of the wizarding community. I’ve just told Jarvis you’re coming too.”
"Captain Rogers left the tower around 10.30 pm, Sir," provided J.A.R.V.I.S. upon request.
Unable to decide between laughing derisively or cursing indignantly, Tony ended up with a indelicate splutter. Steve smiled at him, an actual smile this time, and turned to Sam. "I think you're safe letting him look at them. I heard he did good work on the helicarriers."
But Tony doesn't go by.
Tony realized that it might have been a tad naive to think that all that was expected of him holiday-wise was to import Russian vodka and show up for dinner on the 25th. Honestly, that had seemed doable, even for him. And so he remembered agreeing to that. But he did not remember agreeing to anything else and certainly not something as patently ridiculous as going skating at Rockefeller Center. Honestly, who even did that?
Unlike Steve’s, who was leaking abundantly, Tony’s cock was a little dry. Which was okay at first, because it stopped him from setting the world record for fastest hand job, but it became a little uncomfortable after a couple of minutes. Tony’s arms were pretty much trapped and for a few moment that was a conundrum. Then Steve took his hand from Tony’s dick and brought it next to Tony’s head.
Never mind.
“God, I’m sorry, Steve.” The words tasted trite on his tongue.
Abdel had no answer to that, obviously, and glanced at his wife for help. Yamilla raised an eyebrow and made some 'get on with it' motions with her hands. The lady was getting a little impatient. Tony was about to rub it in a little more, to expound on his feelings of being left out, figuring he could at least get the promise of a blow job out of it, but before he could speak, Steve yanked on his hand. The stunned look had finally gone. He was glaring at Tony pretty impressively now and jerked his head towards the exit. Fun times were over, apparently. Tony sighed.
“No, no,” Tony said. “Wouldn’t have worked. Can’t have a matching set, that'd be too much.  This works. It does.” He stood himself next to Steve to invite comparison. Their robes were very different, even Steve could see that. But the hue in Tony’s robes matched a thread in the fabric of Steve’s and somehow the contrasting designs were okay when seen together. The tailors must have seen the same thing, because they muttered and grumbled a bit, but no scissors were thrown down in disgust and then Tony and Entwhistle left to do whatever they had agreed to do and Steve suffered through another half an hour of non-adjustments. All he wanted to do when Thistlethwaite finally left with a vaguely satisfied grumble, was flop on a couch and put his feet up. He kind of figured that was out of the question.
, and jumped out of the cab to shake the limo driver's hand. Steve followed behind.
“Did you check if Molly successfully got our daughter down for the night?”
“No.”
Steve groaned silently in frustration. There was just no reasoning with these people. Concepts like fairness and compassion were so twisted here that Steve barely recognized them. He was now regretting not immediately heeding the hermit's command. He could have been -
"That woman is a menace."
"It's legal, if that's what you’re asking." Tony made a face. "Most conservative Christians still have a conniption about it, but we could get married in New York and New Hampshire right now, if you want."
Tony blinked. The com in his ear spoke.
Steve will move on. Steve will find someone who makes him smile. He’ll keep going, will keep being-being
Tony shakes his head again. He turns back towards the mansion.
“I don’t.”
“It won’t be for too long. I’ll be quick, I promise.” Tony winked, picking up his phone and waving it. “I’m only a call away.”
Steve raised his brow.
“Don’t. You’ll ruin it.” Tony said, darting his eyes over Steve’s hair carefully. It still looked okay thankfully.
“You mean bonding?”
“I-“ A sharp fuzzy noise that sounded like a choked laugh made its way through the speakers. “I can’t tell you that.”
Tony had always claimed to be a futurist. It was just how he was. What he was known for. What he did.
“As a matter of fact, yes.” Steve smiled tightly and reached for his belt where his gun lay. “Now are you gonna do as you’re told or are we gonna have a problem?”
“What happened? Are you still hurt? Why are you in this armor? And why the hell are you on another planet?” A sudden burst of anger flooded Steve’s body. “Did you come here on your own!?”
The Avengers began living with him shortly after that. And had seemed to make themselves pretty comfortable.
Ten minutes later, the door creaked open and a familiar face walked out.
“If you need blood, you know I’m here. I can give you everything you need, my dear.” She repeated, and as always, tilted her neck to expose the pale, smooth expanse of skin. It was unmarked as Zeke had never had to mark her-she was a born vampire, a pure-blood. She had never needed the bite of another.
“You don’t like those do you?”
“Tony, look at you. You can’t go on like this. You’re going to have a complete breakdown.” Pepper says but Tony can see the hatred in her eyes. Happy is gone of course and Tony should’ve known better than to think Pepper would accept him so soon after. Happy’s death was his fault. So was Steve’s. And now he hates himself as much as Pepper probably does-maybe even more so.
“What are you trying to say?” Tony growled, only Steve had a calculating look on his face.
“Ironman is not on the cards here.” Tony said flatly, starting to accept that this was a waste of his time. This joker was clearly not fussed about his company so there was no point. Unless he could try tactic B.
He scowled and yanked a napkin from the end of the bar, dabbing at his sleeve harshly.
“Ah Anthony! Perfect timing, I’d like you to meet someone. Come, come!” Zeke burst into his room, eyes wide with delight and expression fully smug. He didn’t waste time, clapping his hands for Tony to follow him into the main hall.
Zeke’s voice suddenly boomed and the entire room froze. The crowd went silent, and no one even dared to breathe.
“Thanks Tony.” Steve replied and when Tony looked up at him in surprise, Steve nodded ever so slightly. Tony felt his lips form a small smile in response before nodding back.
"It's not your fault. I get it, trust me." Tony laughed and shook his head tiredly. "You can't be liked by everyone."
His armor was in the corner. Just opposite Steve’s Captain America chain mail. Tony stepped forward and stared at his reflection in the metal.
The sound of his shield slipping off jolted him out of his thoughts. A loud clang of metal made him jump about five feet and he swore as he turned. The stress was getting to him, and the last thing he needed to do was get clumsier. Had he seriously not engaged his shield into the straps-
and tried to stop tapping the desk. He hadn’t even noticed he was doing that.
“Confirm target?”
“Anthony, forgive me. I know you were caught by surprise. If only I’d had time to warn you.” Zeke explained tiredly, as if he hadn’t spoken to Tiberius Stone for weeks and they weren't talking about signing Tony's life away.
His feet connected with the lamp-post and before he could help it, he looked back at Steve with a grin.
“Umm...what?”
“Indeed, Captain. There are air particles. A good sign but-“ His eyes darted across the ground, growing more and more concerned. “No food. Or life signs.”
“How’re you feeling?”
Steve gives him a weary glance before sighing and shaking his head. Strands of blond fall and Tony desperately wants to touch them, and feel him closer. He knows it’s what he’s missed most of all.
But he couldn’t help him now. Nothing would. This was it. This was the end of the line.
He sucked in a breath. The tape wrapped gently around his waist and was held for long enough for the initial cool feeling of the plastic to disappear. Tony let out a sigh of relief.
With a smile, Tyler clapped a hand on his shoulder and nodded. “Excellent. That’s the spirit Stark.”
Slowly he looked up and met Fury’s calm, almost hidden expression. The man was like a Sphinx.
That bunker had quickly become his home. It provided protection from the three blazing suns that rose each day and disappeared each night.
it was a long time ago, but thoughts like that were what made Tony worry a little. It made his fingers itch for a drink afterwards, after all-
“Don’t be shy Anthony.” Zeke huffed around a yawn. “We’re all monsters at heart. There’s nothing special there.”
Steve pressed his hand to the scanner and then, rather than stepping through, he took their joint hands and pressed Tony's palm flat against the scanner.
Tony found himself smiling. He actually liked Tyler. He wasn’t a complete asshole like Ben or Trish and actually treated him pretty decently. Small mercies that he was the boss.
“What is this?” Steve says in a dangerously quiet tone because this is a complete disaster if everything he’s allowing Reed to do is leading up to yet another weapon.
“Stand up.”
"I remember that. I could've eaten a horse that day."
Tony Stark was Iron man.
But there are some days where things almost seem...hopeful. That maybe they’ll get by. Maybe they’ll survive the incursions and this will all be a thing in the past.
“You’re kidding.” Clint blinked and then shook his head slowly like he was speaking to a child. “You honestly don’t know.”
“You’re welcome. Anytime.” Steve sniffs and gives him a tired smile that borders on desperate. His lips shake. “You need help Tony. Please, let us help you-“
“Tony...I’m so sorry.”
Hadn’t listened. Had gone too far. Tony feels a shiver run down his spine.
“It’s fine. I always figured you had a thing for quick-wit.”
“Silence, silence! That was not an invitation for you all to start speaking!” Zeke ordered and once again, the crowd went quiet. But the excitement was palpable.
Then the storm hit. Dozens of baby tsums, Cap and Iron, poked their heads up and chirped. They kept chirping and peeping and some even tried to swim through the sea of balls towards Steve to do something. Tony figured they wanted to save the little Iron-tsum who was still peeping softly and spinning around frantically in Steve’s palm.
“C’mon.” Steve clapped his shoulder and nodded. “Let’s get you back to-“
“Is it a full moon soon?” Tony tilted his head and Steve sighed, spinning the ball in his hand.
“Forget it. He-“
“You caught me off guard last time. Called me a puppy.” Steve remarked, narrowing his eyes and smiling a little. His scent thrummed pleasantly though and somehow Tony found himself smiling.
It didn’t do anything though and when Steve managed to step out of the ball pit and start climbing out, Tony saw the worst thing imaginable.
“Tony stop, you’re not pregnant!”
(That had hurt so much. He’d cried out so much from the sting of his injuries. He’d so desperately wanted someone with him-)
The woman didn't say anything else. Instead she glanced at him and bit her lip. Then she turned and quickly left.
Swallowing, Tony looks down at his shaking palms and stares.
After taking a swig of his drink, Steve put the bottle down and eyed Tony carefully. “Hey.”
With a soft smile, rested his chin on his fist and used his other hand to beckon Tony closer. With a frown, Tony did and then-
“I’m not your mate!”
Steve laughed, a loud chiming sound that didn’t fit the beast that was his body. “This ones’ all me. I’ve been told my fashion sense needs work.”
“You need to eat. You need the energy.” Steve murmured to himself, taking several of the plain boiled vegetables and putting it in another bowl, this time placing it directly in front of Tony. He’d already blitzed some fruits and so he quickly poured out the blueberry smoothie he’d made, placing that in front of Tony too.
The elevator took him up to the main floor. The small screen beside the button also said training area, but Tony didn’t pay much attention to it. He just needed the walk.
“I know what you meant. And no Stark, you are not bait. I don’t know where you got that stupid idea from. We don’t go using Avengers as bait. Or anyone for that matter.” When Tony opened his mouth, Fury let go of the pen and leaned back, looking Tony in the eye. Realization set in and Fury frowned liked he’d just seen a giraffe walk on two legs.
"Bucky?"
"Um.... I'm afraid I don't have that knowledge at the ready, sir."
He feels a damp breath on his ear.
Two hours later he is still watching the goats. They have lazily meandered first to one corner of their enclosure, then to another, never giving the impression that they are moving as a group, yet they all seem to choose to stay within some unspecified distance from each other. None of them wander off alone for too long, and if one does, the whole group will eventually gravitate that way. Steve feels calm in a way he can't remember feeling in forever. It is different from the inertia, this feels almost meditative. When hunger finally drives him back inside, he is surprised to find himself smiling.
Tony burst out into a high pitched laughter, making Steve jerk back in shock. He didn’t care, he knew he looked a little hysterical, doubled over and holding his stomach, but who gave a shit?
It was easier said than done. Impulse took over like a flashfire.
Steve took a deep breathe and closed his eyes, focusing on the feeling of the wind in the face and the cool metal of the armor on his side. Something else registered too, as it usually did when he was this close. The soft bittersweet scent of coffee and the slight tang of metal. Underlying an overall scent of some very clean smelling aftershave.
There’s pity in Steve’s voice. The words hurt more than any blow he’s ever faced.
"Yeah but why take a chance?" Tony shrugged tiredly and folded his arms, dropping the smile. "I'm a liability."
Steve looked up at him sharply with wide eyes, not looking like he was breathing.
Still, he misses Steve. He misses his voice and his smile and his perfect hair and kind heart and the crinkle around his eyes every time he found something he liked in this century. He’d always enjoyed being the one to introduce him to all those things.
“Tony...” Steve groaned and threw his head back when Tony began to suck a mark near the hollow of his throat. His mouth parted and his eyes closed, his whole facade abandoned by the sensations and that was good-perfect, even because there was no way Tony was losing-
Steve raised his brow and stayed firm. “And what price do you have in mind?”
“Fine.” Steve said calmly and took out his water bottle before slamming the fridge door a little too hard. Without saying a word, he snagged a banana from the fruit bowl and then paused. Then he took a few more and an apple for good measure.
“Tony.” He pleaded, waiting for him to look up. “It is a problem. It’s a problem because you’ve become my mate. I bonded you that night. The mark is permanent.”
It all felt so strange. Slowly, the footsteps dropped off until there was just one pair left.
The Cap-tsum chirped loudly and like a blessing, the babies all started to chirp excitedly again, no longer whimpering and crying. Emboldened, Tony carried the Cap-tsum out and stepped out of the green net to find Steve kneeling by a green triangle.
"I know what it says!" Tony growled and snatched the tablet out of Ben's hands before he could start digging through any more of his notifications. He knew Steve was calling him back to the office. He also knew Ben was likely to make a big deal out of it. Something along the lines of-
Steve was gaping at him. His eyes were huge and so so wide.
"Who's we?" Tony asked and instantly wished he hadn't. Carol had a wounded look in her eyes.
“Send me a contract. I’ll look at it as soon as I get it.”
For a moment, she didn't say anything. But then her brown eyes sought his and they were full of sorrow.
Steve doubled over and burst out in laughter.
The Illuminati join Steve in waiting on the landing deck. They’re clearly not as eager as Steve is, but still they come. Some of the Avengers are present too. It almost feels like a reunion.
“Stark, say something. What’re you thinking?”
Steve was staring at him with a frown. He wasn’t saying anything, but his eyes darted over Tony’s face rapidly.
He had Tony back. But the damage...
“You told me you need blood to survive but it doesn’t need to be human. So I was thinking, why don’t you try with me?”
Throwing one last look at the dark alley, Tony nodded once and stepped out with Steve onto the street.
“What’s happened? Is it Steven? I swear if that kid has done somethin’, I’ll get my frame and smack ‘im myself! He’s so thick-headed sometimes.”
“I’m yours.”
A hand caught his elbow gently and instantly he turned and looked up at Steve. He looked perfectly stoic but Tony could see the cogs turning in the background.
“You can’t leave on your own. It’s a four hour journey back and you haven’t got any of your chauffeurs nearby.”
“This isn’t about your ego. You need to keep things going for the sake of your employees. So what if I tailored my offer to that?”
“Steve, answer me.” And of course, there was nothing.
“Sorry, Cap. It’s better this way, trust me. You'll thank me one day.” Iron man croaked through the speakers and took off to the sky, not offering Steve a ride back like he normally would.
The hands pressed his head forward into the man’s neck. And Tony’s hind-brain took over.
“A born vampire. They don’t need blood to survive but they use it to gain strength. And that strength helps them rule. They also have the ability to bond vampires to them.”
But Steve was frozen. He couldn’t move. He could barely breathe.
“So are you.” Tony croaked and swallowed, eyeing the empty space in Steve’s bed. “I’m doing this for you.”
Tony went quiet. Slowly, Steve released him and watched him turn, already mourning the loss of contact. He'd probably lost his chance. It was too late.
There was so much he wanted to do. And so little he could do.
alone Tony.” Rogers says with such intensity it shakes through Tony’s core. “You have me and the team and Rhodey and Pepper. We could never leave you alone, you’re not alone.”
“You’re doing so well. So well.” Steve murmured. Tony groaned again and choked back a sob. “So well, Tony.”
It had scared him. And had served as a reminder that he was truly running out of time and options.
“Sounds exhausting. That’s a lot of trouble to go through for one person.” Tony breathed, going back to spinning the ball. Steve bit his lip to hide a laugh.
Carefully, he slots his hands under Tony shoulders and knees and lifts him up, holding him close as he stands on legs that shake. Tony’s head falls back against his arm. His tears shine brighter under the natural light.
Tony has never wanted to show his hands but he has never had a permanent partner in front of Steve either. He hovered around Steve initially and kept asking about his past before the ice. Steve had been too blind to see it but half of those questions-hell, half of those
Somethings wrong, he knows. His body shouldn’t be this shaky. He shouldn’t feel so panicked and it shouldn't hurt this much.
“Yes my lord.”
“What about resources? Stark industries offers a huge research and development team which everyone knows is-“
“So why would you pick me? If you’re my alpha, that means you must’ve chosen me. Why would Captain America choose me?”
“That’s just how he speaks. Don’t worry about him.” Peter swung down from a traffic light, balancing easily on his back legs. Strangely enough, Tony liked the red and blue uniform he wore. But maybe that preference had something to do with Steve.
Three pairs of eyes rounded on him. He shuddered and let his hand fall.
Tony thought as he looked at Robinson, who was trying to duck under the giant robot.
“Great. Thanks Tones.” He said and stood up, but not before clapping a hand on Tony’s shoulder once again. Then he turned and got lost in the crowd.
“Oh, you’ll find that I can, Stark.” Fury smirked and suddenly pulled out a folder from under the table. He slid it across and waited with a knowing smile as Tony frowned and picked it up and opened it. When Tony read it, he paused.
“Okay, so-“ Tony holds out his hands as they follow him into his penthouse. “I only sleep with one of you. I can’t sleep with both of you, otherwise this wouldn’t be the problem we're having.”
Tony had signed anyway.
“Why did you save me?” Because it still didn’t make sense. Tony being there in his suit and screaming his name as he fell from the skyline. Tony shouldn’t have been there. He should’ve been handling registration.
Steve’s eyes darken. “Yes, he did.”
“Whatever. Just stay out of my way before this traitor teaches you a lesson you won’t forget.” Tony growled and felt his anger flare when Ben just laughed and turned on his heel, not bothering to look back as he reached the steel door.
“Come with me. I’ll get this sorted for you.” He said and before Tony could answer, scooped his arms under Tony's legs and picked him up in one go.
“Welcome, Stark. This is our research and development team. These are the brightest and wisest young men and women I have ever had the pleasure of working with. And they are going to be your new team.”
His lungs expanded. His pupils sought the dark sky. He tilted his head back and breathed. For once, he was alive.
“Go wait in the limo, Tones. Don’t fuck it up now. I’ll bring him to you when we’ve dealt with all the formalities here.”
"You have plans?" Steve’s smile threatened to split his face.
come over and help out! I’m on a family vacation, for Merlin’s sake. I am on a cruise ship in a Norwegian Fjord on my way to see the Northern lights. My parents would kill me if I left, even if I knew how to get off this ship. And, no, I don’t want to get off this ship!”
"You don't think one turkey is enough? Not even if we get like a twenty pounder?"
"Not my fault if everyone else is wrong." Steve said softly, but deadly serious. Tony had no answer. He wanted to avert his eyes, but found that he couldn't. He was at once highly uncomfortable, yet completely elated. Steve's closeness charged the air Tony was trying, but somehow failing, to breathe. Then Steve leaned in. Tony should have pushed him away. He should have insisted that Steve was delusional and that he should come to his senses. But apparently Tony had lost his senses as well, because he did none of that and instead parted his lips under Steve's and welcomed the exploring tongue. Warmth washed through him and before he realized what he was doing, he had stepped closer and was being wrapped in Steve's arms. Despite the discomfort of being pressed against chain mail, and despite the fears he'd been struggling with not even ten minutes ago Tony knew what Steve had meant about comfort. Somehow, everything was right in the world right now. Never better. The feeling lingered when Steve broke the kiss and leaned back to look at him, and Tony was inexplicably still out of witty comebacks.
on the other side of the wall.
The rest of the world probably just thought he was paranoid, walking through the grey corridors with a bodyguard at his shoulder, their shoes squeaking on the linoleum. That was the upside of being stupidly rich and a well known douchebag, though, being a little more douchey than usual didn't faze people. He left Steve by the door and slipped inside. As he kissed Aunt Peggy’s cheek, he was a little relieved that she still recognized him. He knew she'd forget that he'd been here within hours, or maybe she was down to minutes now. Eventually, she'd forget him altogether, but that was something he refused to think about right now.
Tony had to think on that one. "Uh..... 1979?"
Then he turned to Bors.
The sooner this day was over, the better.
“As if you didn’t know! As if you’ve not let everyone know how fucking poor my muggle-”
"Hey! I was reading that!"
"No! I mean..." Steve was blushing furiously now and Tony felt a little bit evil. A tiny little bit, really, pretty much negligible. "I mean, there are straps on the chaps too."
Tony laid awake a while listening for the sound of the front door opening and closing. If it happened, he didn’t hear it, though.
A fresh wave of tears followed. And a tale of how she'd been arguing with her elderly neighbor whose goat kept getting into her vegetable yard and eating the lettuce and how the man had keeled over and died in the middle of a tirade. His wife had accused her of hexing him and that had been that.
gay Steve was, had they reconsidered. On the condition that he would do solo missions only and keep his identity a secret. Steve was so very, very sick and tired of being a secret. He was almost hoping Tony would blab it all over the news. But so far he hadn't heard a thing from Tony. Or even about Tony, who was usually in the news much more frequently than he had been in the month since he had last seen him.
“Okay. So. The next part isn’t going to be very pleasant.” Tony looked a little grim. “We’ll have to stand hereabouts for a couple of hours in a receiving line, shaking hands. Then there’ll be dancing and food though, so that’s not usually as bad.”
“Same here! You’d think it’d be simple. Just some ground beef and salt on a griddle, what could go wrong?”
"You did? For what?"
He left his old house near midnight, approximately 5 hours after the stereo had been fixed. He whistled as he weaved a little unsteadily along the canal. The night was still warm and a little moist, with the almost full moon shining through the thin shroud of clouds, creating a silver halo. It was pretty and peaceful. He cast a cursory glance down the alley next to Cafe De Wijnhaven as he passed it. Then he stopped whistling and looked again. There had been a flash of white near the cellar doors. He didn’t see it now, but he could have sworn it was a cat. He was almost positive it had to have been Steve-the-cat, the elusive sibling of the gang at home. He hadn’t tried to catch Steve in months, he realized a little guiltily. Maybe he should get a trap and some food and try it that way, tomorrow.
“Yeah, alright,” Tony said to Rhodes, inclining his head in Steve’s direction. “In the meantime, there’s your client.” He motioned for Rhodes to follow him down the hall.
“Okay, so your water pressure is enviable,” he conceded, “but your tower is fucking freezing.”
“Okay. You get some sleep. Get your bedroll and put it next to mine. I want to keep an eye on you. Oh, don't forget to cover up the charcoal first. I am going to wake Percival for the next watch.”
"I'm not hurt." He took a ragged breath. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean-"
Tony retreated to the altar and watched the fight. As unnerving as the thing was, watching Steve fight was like poetry in motion. Usually when they fought, Tony was too busy fighting alongside to really pay attention. The man was fucking beautiful and Tony felt a familiar tightening in his lower abdomen. He swallowed. No. Nonono. This was not on. This was so not on. He and Steve were BFFs now, at least while they were stuck here together, and Tony wasn't going to fuck that up by adding lust to the mix. They really didn't need that kind of complication at the best of times and these were so not the best of times. He told himself that, intellectually, he could admire Steve's deadly grace, but there was absolutely no need at all to follow that up with wondering how that would translate in the sack. No need. At. All. And the fact that the man was a virgin was irrelevant too. That was Steve's business and not Tony's concern. At
he can still feel. Every fistful of his hair, every curl of his tongue...
Tony always smiled and said hello. Steve only ever said
But Tony felt another urge take him. Slowly, he nuzzled the place on this man’s neck, pressing a small kiss to the place where his blood rushed. He heard a sharp intake of breath and the hands around him tightened fractionally.
“Sir.” Norman said and paused, inspecting the crowd of young vampires. “If that’s the case, we still need someone to guard that area. Someone to lay down the family scent and do as they’re told. And someone who knows the Manhattan routes.”
“You can
It definitely beat being woken in the communal sleeping quarters.
His words slip and he blinks blearily, feeling something cold on his cheeks. It’s hard to tell for sure, he can barely feel his toes.
Suddenly the armor's lights seem to dim. Tony’s head tilts down, just a fraction.
“Would you believe me if I said I feel that way about you?”
And make Tony his mate. Permanently.
The meeting room is in complete disarray. The long wooden table is in two pieces, and the chairs are backed away against the wall littered with indents. In the center stands Strange, and for once, he’s the one being held back.
“I’M NOT STAYING HERE! HE CAN’T MAKE ME!”
What had happened next was something Tony would never forget.
He didn’t care what anyone thought. This was
“Anyway I’ll leave you to it. You’ve got your rounds to make and I need to see what’s taking the police so long. I’ll see you around.”
He was pretty sure he'd knock someone out if he did. Or completely break.
Tonight he decided he’d play it more safe. Start with the alley he’d not reached last time and end with the one he had. That way he’d lower his chances of a repeat performance.
He once again chose a spot, took position and waited. It took a little longer, but this time a male human appeared and thankfully, Tony was able to strike fast enough for the human to pass out before doing anything. It was strange how some humans reacted to his bite. More often than not, they’d almost look like they were falling asleep but occasionally some would scream. It was impossible to predict which but maybe blood type had something to do with it.
“It’s spread right across. I didn’t know.” Steve’s voice was hushed, almost as if he’d learned a precious secret.
And maybe something else.
“Prove it.” Steve suddenly said and met his gaze head on with barely contained rage even with being incapacitated in a hospital bed. Whether he was angry at the situation or him was a complete mystery but Tony wasn’t going to comment. Instead, he barked out a laugh at the imagery.
“You’re the Captain.
Tony’s face was full of agony as he shifted his hazy gaze on Steve.
“Once you finish, I’ll call the team down. They want to see you.”
He felt tired. Even though he’d had no doubts that his meeting with the AXO head wouldn’t work out, he’d still held out for a hope. Futurist belief and all that.
“Oh yeah. A hand would be great.” Tony replied, feeling his eyes burn. The street-lights blurred in front him with each blink.
“We’re not done here. We have so much to talk about. I'm so angry with you, I can't even begin to explain it.” Steve continued to say and without opening his eyes, Tony nodded again, feeling his heart sink.
At three on the dot, Tony heard a knock on his bedroom door. He’d finished drying his hair from the shower and was just putting on his comfiest black wife-beater and jeans when Steve walked in wearing a shield hoodie and some perfect looking jeans of his own. Tony kept his eyes fixed firmly above Steve’s waist.
His gaze was calculating. He seemed to always come back to Tony.
“It’s a significant portion, correct?”
“You will be on the same schedule as the rest of your men. Your little group of traitors. I don’t expect to see you step even an inch out of line.”
“Stop it.”
It had all been for nought though. After a particularly bad night that he barely remembered, he vaguely recalled waking up and turning to see the mark on his wrist disappear. That had solidified it for him. He had to change.
After his memories had come back and he’d confronted Tony, he’d considered having the picture destroyed. He just couldn't bring himself to do it.
“Sam, enough.” Ben said calmly and placed a hand on Sam’s shoulder, as if to give him strength. “We’re not, you know that.”
Almost tentatively, Steve spoke.
“But how can a Cap-tsum have a baby Iron-tsum?” Tony tilted his head and pursed his lips. “And why do they look like-oh.”
Tony felt his eyes burn. If he had his shades this wouldn’t have been a problem. But here, in front of these men, mocking him and reminding him of his shortcomings, just minutes after he’d made the decision to move on from Steve-
"What do you want from me Steve?" Tony sighed tiredly and felt his eyes close under the helmet. "I put on the suit. Just like you asked."
“What. The. HELL MUTT!” Tony gasped, shaking his fist at him with rage. “Stop doing that!”
Pierce guided him through the crowd, occasionally bumping shoulders and saying quick hellos. Though he greeted a large number of politicians, he still managed to steer clear from the area Steve had last been in, and while it was completely unintentional, Tony was immensely grateful.
“J-Jarvis, just-“
“Then what are you waiting for? Do it.”
Wordlessly, Grant reached for his neck and plucked at the chain there. With shaky fingers, he reached the tags and pulled them out in offering, unsure as to why he felt so comfortable doing it. Something about this Steve made him relax, almost instinctively.
He had tried for humour. But the minute Tony stopped speaking, he completely broke, tears streaming down his face. He curled up around the bag like it was a lifeline and didn’t register Steve getting up sharply.
“...It’s alright pet. Some nights are such. You are doing well.” Zeke soothed and reached out to brush Tony’s hair out of his eyes. “I’m proud of you for following your instincts. Returning to the cavern is always safer.”
“I could have called anyone to this evening. But I chose you.”
“We’re so lucky.” Steve continues, struggling to keep his emotions in check. “I’m going to protect him. He’s going to be the happiest omega. I’m going to protect both of you. Keep you both safe so that he can grow up to be like you.”
“You were the one who found me. I owe you my thanks.” Tony said quietly, dipping his chin in the arachnid’s direction politely. It was hard to read an arachnids’ thoughts but he thought Peter’s eyes seemed brighter.
“Why am I-why am I here?” Steve mouths the words again and shakes his head. “
“Granted J.”
Steve sounds nervous as he says it, and Tony can’t help but love the man even more. Steve is so thoughtful, and even now, he’s trying his best to make Tony comfortable. It’s a blessing Tony didn’t know he had.
“Hey JARVIS, open up new messages.”
She wasn’t looking at either of them so that was a hint in itself.
Tony didn’t want to admit that he’d enjoyed the idea of Steve coming from far to meet him.
” Tony says, feeling completely stunned and tries to push himself up on the bed even though the obstetrician immediately stops him. “Is that you?”
“Do you want to dance after this?”
him to use it.
“You must stay here pet. I need you to keep things calm in the cavern.” Zeke snickered to himself, and reached out to stroke Tony’s hair again but Tony wasn’t ready to give in.
In front of him, Sharon’s eyes lit up. She smiled broadly and with such happiness and joy that Tony couldn’t help but feel immensely guilty for the horrible ache of jealousy. But of course, he couldn’t stamp out the overwhelming sadness.
Noting the closeness, Steve looked up and met Tony’s eyes. Then he raked over Tony carefully and his gaze softened and his lips quirked up.
“Thanks. I guess.”
“Tony. Breathe.” It sounded soft but the command was clear.
“Steve.” Tony groaned, pressing his head up to his hand and leaned back in the chair. They’d been through this already. “He didn’t do anything and besides, he’s in research. That’s basically the equivalent of a civilian. He was scared.”
Tony leaned back and rolled his eyes, folding his arms as he did. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Far as I’m concerned, there isn’t anything special here. And I don’t see that changing any time soon.”
“What?”
“Sure. I don’t forget these things.” He said, showing Steve an easy smile. See? He was fine. He wasn’t pathetic and he didn’t need to worry because-
“I know. But the thought did cross my mind. Why wouldn’t you try? Anyone else would. And if I were to ever have kids, well-“ Tony laughed bitterly at that. “Let’s just say I wouldn’t have much to contribute anymore. Becoming pregnant would probably kill me and any kids I made would probably-“
“Whitney. Are you feeling...better?” He decided to go for the polite route. It would be best not to rock the boat, especially with these encounters he’d been having outside.
Like he’d said before. Some things never changed.
As he walks through the mansion, he sees the picture of the original team standing tall. The glass is cracked and faded on the floor and feeling sick to his stomach, Tony bends over and picks it up, not even flinching when the broken glass cuts his hands. He still hasn’t healed the bruises around his neck. It serves as a reminder for what he needs to do. A noose around the neck of a ghost.
They were here. They were together. It would be enough.
Rubbing the bridge of his nose, he gave it one final go, even though he already knew what the answer would be. “So I guess that’s a no on dinner?”
“Thank you for saving me.”
“I like you more than I dislike the press.”
“So I mentioned that I’ve booked a room for us at a hotel nearby. I was thinking that when we get there, we can relax for a bit, maybe talk for a while?”
For a moment, Tony forgot everything else.
“And which freak show did you crawl out of?” Tony coughed, gesturing at the pentagram and stripes. That was right, he wasn’t the one who needed to be embarrassed.
It was all lies anyway. They were damaged beyond repair. Steve was his boss now. Their previous relationship was gone.
“Tony, stay with me-“
“Ah now that would be giving it all away! Where’s the fun in that?”
His throat closes and he swallows. There’s a low sound coming from somewhere, a moan that sounds like a wounded animal and suddenly Tony realizes he’s the one causing it.
He was burrowed in the scent. His nose pressed against warm skin that pulsed with life. He frowned a little but didn’t move, feeling a hand brush his hair back gently.
Steve’s eyes narrowed as he watched the sun’s final moments. “No. Never.”
Sam and Carol are worried. He's pretty sure Maria is too. She's one of the few that doesn't lift her nose at him when he walks. The Avengers are the same too.
The view of their wedding rings next to Steve’s tags appeared before him. The tears began to well up once again.
He let out a mighty cry and screamed;
Steve still couldn’t understand. How could Tony and so many others possibly believe this was the right thing. How could he truly think that when Goliath had-
He doesn’t hear anything else. All he knows is that everything is starting to go black and he feels alone and tired and afraid and his body feels numb and unlike anything he’s ever felt before.
Tony nodded, licking his lips a little. “That's it.” He had so many thoughts right now, he couldn’t even begin to parse them out. But he did have some ideas.
“What kind of projects does Fury make you do?”
Tony grit his teeth and shook his head. "This wasn't the deal. You said I was an agent-"
He could barely feel Norman’s arm around his neck anymore. Everything was going numb.
“Right. I’d...Okay.” Tony replied quietly and suddenly let a laugh escape, feeling astounded at the whole situation. He’d been ready to leave Steve. Or not ready but accepting. Resigned to his fate.
“He’s okay for now. Not unstable but definitely not where I would like him to be. I’m ordering set meals. Lots of foods containing iron and lots of fluids. I can tell just by looking at him that he’s not eating, so I’m gonna order weekly bloods tests until he’s back on track.”
This time they took a sleek looking plane to the Helicarrier. Inside were private seats and tables and a very polite crew. On one of the tables, Tony noticed a black briefcase.
His lips twitched into a smile and his eyes lit up as he sat down on the couch and opened the letter. It really was for him.
“C’mon. It’ll be fun.”
A knock on the door pulled them out of their moment. Tony’s lawyer opened it and nodded at the pair, though his eyes lingered on their joint hands.
“Damnit look at me, Tony!” Steve growled, pulling him back with a hand around his arm. “Why the hell haven’t you seen someone yet!? Where’s the rest of your team!? Why have you left them!?" Steve shook him angrily and that was it. Something in him finally snapped.
This was it’s mate. The soft sleepy Iron-tsum was pregnant and was having lots of babies. This was their home. And the young medium sized Cap-tsum was the father. He was trying to protect them.
“Yeah, like I said. I don’t have a mark.” Tony said softly and with trembling lips, bent down to pick up his pants, feeling like he was going to break. Only then-
“Sorry. Sometimes it-I-glitch. And about earlier, I didn’t think it was right. You know, things left dead and buried and all that.”
I can’t just sell you to someone else.” Steve said quietly but his tone was firm. He stared Tony down and didn’t look away.
“You know I have clothes right?”
“Who says I don’t own it anymore?” Steve breathed and suddenly Steve pulled him back up until his back was pressed against Steve’s chest in the reflection.
“Ha. Thanks.” Tony smiled tiredly, pulling his hands away. He let them settle in his lap and stared at them uselessly. They were shaking. His hands were
His eyes didn’t sting anymore.
"Oh? But I seem to remember you had more tasks to do Stark." Ben smirked and held out a hand to the side where Sam came along and handed him Tony's tablet, looking equally smug.
He hadn’t expected her face to drop that much.
Pushing off the ground, Tony leaped into the air, bypassing all of Avengers. He timed his landing perfectly, descending with a hard
“Yes.” The medic smiled gently. “It’s hard. I get it, my mate had an accident a few years ago. I couldn’t even stand up that day.”
) where he feels adrift and lost in the emptiness, he gets up from his bed, leaves the room without a sound and finds his suit. The Helicarrier continues to roar as he takes his suit and leaves.
“Read it. Get back to me.” Fury finished succinctly and left via the elevator, faster than Tony could’ve called for his suit, and leaving Tony with the strange invitation in his hands.
It was just him and Zeke now. Frankly, Tony didn’t give a shit what Zeke had to say.
As quickly as the smile appeared it vanished from Ben’s face. Instead, he was now glaring at Tony with an equally angry expression.
He imagines Steve’s probably found a replacement for him now.  Someone else to call
No. He didn’t see any indication. Nothing at all-
Steve was frowning at Tony again, only this time the skin around his eyes looked tight and his lips were down turned.
Something had broken. Whatever had just happened, it had taken whatever small flame they’d had and snuffed it out, swift and subtle.
it was just that he didn’t want anyone to realize just how disillusioned he’d been. If he kept standing there and staring at Steve, someone would eventually notice the red eyes and put two and two together.
"Come." Steve murmured, looking away as he led Tony to the dance floor. They received many stares as they approached but Steve stared right back with his chin held high and somehow that did the trick. No one stared too hard after that.
“You look like the cat that got the canary.”
"Tony, I was thinking..." Steve sat up and swung his legs over the side of the weird bed. Now Tony really looked at him. He pulled his t-shirt down where it had ridden up his front. "I was thinking... Let's learn to dance today."
Steve woke up in the morning and noticed he had slipped sideways down the wall onto the bed. He wondered briefly if Tony had slipped down with him and had slept draped over his side and he'd missed it. He'd never know, because Tony was gone now and it wasn't like he'd ever ask him. He blinked in the bright morning light and scrambled out of the bed. Things looking different in the morning wasn't a good thing in this case. There were so many problems they hadn't addressed yet. He decided to leave his chain mail in the heap were it was, knowing he'd pay for that later. There was no such thing as rust free steel here and mail needed a ridiculous amount of care. But he needed to find Tony first. Apparently the need to have the man within sight at all times hadn't worn off yet after ten hours or so. That, and they needed to start planning. Fair enough. He knew exactly where Tony would be anyway.
days! It's never been three days before."
He'd just started to describe the glowy blue sphere when the door to the courtyard swung open and the twins came in with a bowl of freshly picked blackberries. Tony felt like cheering. Actual food! He snagged almost half the berries while the twins served themselves gruel and bickered over who had kitchen clean up duty today. Steve raised an eyebrow at Tony and Tony put a handful of the berries back. He manfully refrained from sticking his tongue out at Steve. The door opened again and in came Percival with two large buckets brimming with water, followed by Florrie who gave him a cackling smack on his ass for his trouble. Tony was impressed. The well at this castle was brackish, the sea being as close as it was, and the nearest fresh water was a good mile away. Iron Man had been on water duty mostly, but Iron Man was- Yeah, water was going to be a problem soon.
“Really? Carrying dudes? Like, on the battlefield in WWII?” Her eyebrow rose quizzically, as if she might be calling bullshit on her own question, but for sure on any answer to it.
"Fetch me? Wait, what was the message?"
.... Slight miscalculation. He tried sending a current through the armor, but that didn't seem to affect Squiddly Diddly at all. He needed to maneuver himself so he could use the repulsors.
"Probably..."
"I am sure Lancelot will like you well enough once he gets to know you. You gave him no chance to get acquainted before you beat him in battle."
Tony couldn’t see Steve’s face. The side that was turned towards him was shrouded in shadow and a glint of his eye was all he could make out. He wanted to reach out and slide his hand along Steve’s jaw, draw him into an embrace, maybe. But that wouldn’t be a good idea. He settled for placing his hand on top of Steve’s, thinking that might be accepted by the other man. The skin was dry and rough under his fingers and when Steve’s hand twitched under his own, he gave it a quick squeeze and let go.
“Hello Tony. I just came by to ask you if I could help you move your stuff or something. It’s almost the end of the month and I gave notice at my place for the first, so I am going to need to move in soon.”
“First of all, the continuity-elasticity limit is a
It was much darker outside the windows of the workshop when he finally dragged himself away.
He had a feeling he'd miss Tony, though. He'd miss the wicked sense of humor and the... touching. But that wasn't real. Steve had had to remind himself of that multiple times yesterday. It wasn't real... But fuck if he couldn't enjoy it while it lasted. His councilor on base had called him touch-starved, well... Tony was fixing that, all by himself.
"Oh, fuck you, Rogers. No. Actually, fuck
Steve tries real hard not to move his hips, he knows that isn't done, he remembers that. But Tony grabs his other hand and guides it this head too and now both his hands are winding through the strands of hair and cupping Tony's head and it's perfect for guiding the pace, for drawing Tony into his crotch. When Tony starts pulling his hips forward, though, he can't help it any longer. He starts fucking Tony's face, his own incredible need driving him towards the inevitable. It's like a vision, Tony's head cradled in his hands, Tony's lips tight around his cock and he himself driving himself down Tony's throat. His panting breaths are loud in his ears and it isn't long before he can start feeling the orgasm building at the bottom of his spine. Tony's hands are on Steve's ass, cupping and gripping and it's so, so good.
Steve glances at Tony, who is looking back at him, sporting a tiny smile.
Walking back home long after midnight, Tony’s heart felt full to bursting. The afterglow of spending the evening with friends, the warm summer night and the moonlit streets were enough to cause that, but when Steve’s fingers wove themselves in between his own, he couldn’t remember ever being this happy.
“Thank you, Jarvis.”
"Sir Stephen, you must make haste and continue your journey to Castle Corbenic. Your traveling companions have not managed to lift the curse on this land, and you are much needed." She gestured around her, and in the light of day it was obvious something was wrong here. The grass was dead as far as the eyes could see and there was no sign of life. It was eerily silent, just the wind rustling in the grass, and the waves crashing in the distance with not even the cries of seagulls to break the monotony.
Tony frowned for a moment. “He literally said... What is, and always will be, my greatest creation... is you. Those were the actual words. It's not like I didn't rewatch that about five hundred times. What is wrong with that? Even if it wasn't to my face, it's the nicest thing he ever said to me.”
He ignored Steve’s pleading eyes and Pepper’s glare, gave them a jaunty wave and stalked out.
“You should have used my detangler.”
“It’s okay, Stevie,” he heard the other man whisper, “It’s over. It’s all over, now. We can start new.”
“Can you make it bigger?” He asked, curious.
Steve questions his own sanity anew when the man turns around to walk back to the trailer, but then he gets distracted by the shape of his ass in the cargo shorts as he climbs into it. The radio turns off. Goat Man returns just a few moments later with a laundry sack over his shoulder and a roll of what Steve presumes are clean clothes in the other hand. He jumps down gracefully and closes and locks the trailer door.
Tony was waiting for him at the stairs.
"I think this ended very well," said Steve, "I'd like to say Sir Percival and I had it in hand, but I don't think that was true." Percival nodded.
“They need it,” nodded Thor. “And it’ll be a good excuse not to let him go back out tonight, if his clothes are hanging on the line.” They didn’t have a dryer, so one of the hallways was strung with laundry lines. In weeks like this, when they had to keep the windows closed it was a slow, slightly musty smelling process, but everything got dry eventually. But it took at least half a day. It used to take longer, though, before Tony had turbo charged the spin cycle of their washer.
Tony sat nursing his coffee while Steve ate. And ate some more. And more still. Wow. Gotta love a man with a good appetite. Good thing he could afford to feed him. And clothe him, the man needed clothes that fit. Not that Tony didn't appreciate the way his own T-shirt was stretched delectably across those super serious pecs and deltoids, but the shirt was probably ruined and it being a vintage AC/DC, that was kind of a shame. Which kind of made him wonder what kind of clothes he needed. Which led to the question what Steve was going to do now. What were his options? He waited until Steve started chewing a little slower.
“Yeah, well, what can you do? I don't play well with others. Just ask Fury.”
A couple of days later all visible ice had melted from Cap's body, although JARVIS assured him the process wasn't done yet, because internally, the body was still frozen. And what a body it was! Cap was a beautiful man. Really, the pictures hadn't done him justice, what with the strong jaw and the chiseled cheekbones. And he had been flawlessly preserved by the ice. There wasn't a blemish on him, not even the slightest sign of freezer burn, even though his outfit was much the worse for wear. Tony could just feel himself basking already in the reflected glory of presenting the public with their fallen hero. Maybe even Dad would have been proud. Tony snorted. Yeah, right. Still, he must have stood there for quite a while, in the little room, just staring at this beautiful stranger who used to be his childhood hero.
“I am completely lacking in the sartorial graces and too stubborn to let my husband pick my robes, I am of the false opinion that none of you care what I wear, but the truth is none of you would dare to criticize me anyway and at least I am comfortable.”
Hope, the fickle bitch, flared up like fireworks on the fourth of July. The more Steve grilled the man, who was a little taken aback by this sudden interest, the more he was convinced this could only be Iron Man.
Tony rushed back with the paper towels and the tub and handed the former to Steve, who started to painstakingly wipe off little muzzles and tiny paws. The kittens squealed and squirmed in protest, but they were held firmly, yet gently, in the big hands. The whole picture did a funny thing to Tony’s innards. He tore his eyes away and looked for something with which to fill the makeshift litter box. He settled on some of the less relevant articles he had photocopied for his research and started tearing them into little pieces. Steve set the kittens down and they started curiously exploring their new digs.
"Well, it's nice to see you married him for love and not his money, dear," Vanessa sounded all motherly now, "Let's get you guys dancing together again. Vincent!" She clapped her hands. "
"Kind of. Mostly. It can be helpful though. Like now."
"Hey," he answered, eloquently. His fingers twitched a little and he felt Steve fractionally push his face into hand in response, as if it had been a caress. Which made him want to slide his hand along the jaw in wonder. He stopped himself just in time.
“It’s alright,” he hurried to say. “I’m over here. I’m not dead.” And then he wanted to bite off his tongue. Way to jump into a puddle of shit with both feet. Steve’s head whipped around and then he just… froze.
“I see. It's obvious what Del and you two would be getting out of that particular scenario, but what is in it for me? Am I supposed to just go get a cup of coffee while she fucks my husband, since pussy doesn't do it for me? ”
We need to still watch
“You have no idea how rare that attitude is, do you?” Steve said softly. “I can’t remember the last time someone treated me like a person and not like a nuisance. Or an opportunity. It’s a little scary, actually. I’m not sure I remember how to be a person.”
Shit. Tony whirled around. He’d left his bedroom door open and all four young adult cats were excitedly exploring the kitchen. Thor was batting at the water that came out of the dripping faucet. Brucie was standing under said faucet and ducked his head every time a drop hit him between the ears, but he didn’t move away. Sometimes Tony thought his rainy ordeal might have caused just a smidgen of brain damage, because he seemed to make even poorer life choices that the other ones. Clint, of course, was stalking something on top of the kitchen cupboards and Tasha… Holy fuck, Tasha had already managed to catch a mouse! She was beaming with pride as she deposited it at Tony’s feet and Tony couldn’t help but smile proudly too. God he hated to have to lock them back up in his tiny room.
"Tony," Bruce interjected gently, "We want to cook. Cooking is nice. It's comforting. It smells good. It's fun."
Tony looked back at Steve. Steve smiled at him.
“I… yeah. Next time, okay?” Steve shoved his other hand in his pocket and hunched miserably.
"Yeah, that was the part that Nat and I didn't get. You know Hydra infiltrated Porter's lab personnel and tried to steal the serum prototype samples while Porter was away on vacation, right?" Clint paused as he took in Tony's face. "You didn't know." His voice was flat. "Okay then. Well, Nat was on site. Played a pretty lab technician. Thwarted their attempts to crack the safe Tuesday night, took a few prisoners, got the distinct impression that this whole circus..." Clint waved his hands around to encompass the ship and the milling people in various costumes, "was only to get Porter out of the way. Yet, you didn't come home after the lab raid went down. So we decided to come see for ourselves what was up. We quietly borrowed a quinjet, and, hey presto, here we are. Dude, I don't know why the fuck
He hadn't even noticed he had started to lower his head, when a full body shiver went through Tony, and not in an excited kind of way. His breath started to wheeze and Steve threw himself off Tony with alacrity. Jesus, of all the stupid things he'd done... he was way too heavy to lie on top of Tony like that.
“Did you collapse before or after the 21st last year?” he whispered to Tony.
and yet-"
"You don't want to know. Trust me." Tony placed his hands on both men's backs and started pushing them out of the workshop. Beers were obviously in order or these guys would remain good little soldiers for another couple of hours and that would be boring.
"Is that an order, O Captain my Captain?"
Natasha opened her mouth to speak again, when Steve didn’t answer. Tony shook his head at her silently, mouthing ‘no’. She shut it and started working the trimmer over his ears.
Steve felt a blush creep up his cheeks.
How I have always reacted, of course, you fucking imbecile! And you have every single file on me as Captain America. What did you think I'd do? Stick up my hands and surrender? Wet my pants?"
"I don't think we have to worry about the ceiling height in the tower, " said Steve. "Let's go with the Noble Fir. How about that one?" He pointed to a tree that looked identical to all the other trees as far as Tony was concerned at this particular point in time, so Tony nodded silently. Whatever. He shoved his hands back in his pockets to stop himself from touching his nose in wonder.
Five of the women chose the convent. He knew it was useless to try and convince them that they shouldn't be ashamed and feel obligated to hide away from the world, unless he could convince the rest of the world to see it that way too, but he still felt like he'd failed them. He hoped the nuns had more compassion than these so called knights. He assigned Gawaine and Lancelot to escort this group of women. And after a brief argument it turned out that Gawaine and Lancelot did take orders from Steve after all.
He felt like he should know who Whiplash was. If the ugly motherfucker knew how to make an arc reactor there had to be a connection to himself. Or maybe to Howard. He tried matching the details of the design that he had in his gauntlet to his own and previous incarnations of it. Which was difficult while it flight and away from his mainframe And then he couldn't help thinking of Steve outing himself as Captain America and the media circus that was going to cause and, oh fuck, Pepper was going to be really upset this time.
“I’ll put him in your room now, okay?” said Bruce. “That’s where all the amenities are.”
But he'd wanted Tony too and Tony, lord help him, wanted Steve. Wanted all of him. He wanted the looks, the smiles, the dry humor, the fond exasperation, the yelling, the blushes. He wanted the casual touches, the not so casual ones. He wanted Steve's arm around his shoulders during the day and Steve's hand around his dick at night. Or day. Anytime was a good time for that, really.
. Not so much an offer, per se. I'm hoping you will agree to something we would find mutually beneficial.”
“Why the fuck
Tony hadn’t expected to ever have to feel grateful for that episode, but there he was. The best thing was that his roommates had all decided to do Christmas and New Year’s in New York and for three weeks the mansion had been full of warmth and laughter and booze and bickering and it had pulled Tony through the holiday season without feeling like Scrooge pre-Christmas Carol.
“I am going to sleep in Bruce’s bed. He went to Leiden for the weekend. You take my bed.” He’d just wash both sets of sheets tomorrow.
Which begged the question of how the hell Tony ended up getting into these situations? And more importantly, how was he going to get out of this particular one with both their souls intact and without shitting himself?
"Alright, everyone! Let's take a twenty minute water break and then we'll reconvene to go over all we've learned today!" Antonio called out after clapping his hands. Steve would have happily dunked his head in the water cooler right there and then to gather his wits, but they had their contacts to worry about. He made his way over to the cooler with Tony, staying close behind him until he could get his erection under control. The other couple wasn't at the cooler.
"Which was in another country. This was faster."
“Funny, and by the way, I wasn’t talking about Steve. I was talking about the kittens.”
“I know. The nurse told me. You spent all day every day by my bed while I was in that coma and everyday since, but
"That's even less than a penny per thought."
“Stark...”
The room was filling up now. Mostly press, from what he could see. Steve’s story had gotten a lot of coverage when he had first disappeared and had supposedly been kidnapped. Tony himself had been followed by reporters ever since he’d arrived back in the States, thanks to the fucking Times article. And then, somehow, someone had put two and two together and the press had exploded with headlines of the ‘The Lost Heir And The Lost Soldier’ and “America’s Prodigal Sons Return” and ‘Mysterious Savior Revealed!’ variety. It was a total pain in the ass. With her deadly efficiency, Pepper had been fending off reporters, the woman was truly worth her weight in gold, but it had barely calmed speculations at all.
“That's what I figured.” Steve's expression had gone a little flat. Why? Did he
“That doesn't mean I didn't
He'd never admit it, but after that, Steve's voice in his ear during missions became a source of comfort.
Steve hated him. Hated how the star Ravenclaw student gracefully slid into a chair, without even looking at Steve and how he handled his cutlery with impeccable pure bred manners. Hated how he always had something snide to say, how he argued with professors (and often won), how he was beautiful and brilliant and brittle and caustic. But most of all, Steve hated how he himself became completely tongue tied around Tony Stark. He knew he stuttered like a yokel when Tony was present, and that that nine times out of ten he ended up beet red for no good reason. When Tony wasn’t around Steve was the charming and popular captain of the Gryffindor quidditch team, but when Tony was there, he was pulled in so many different directions that he ended up acting like a bumbling idiot, reinforcing Tony’s already low opinion of him.
“You up for it, Steve?” The whisper is rough, as the back of Tony's hand lightly brushes the pajama pants tenting over Steve's straining erection. “Is that for me?”
“So what do your robes say?”
stuff. I think we should invent an anti-gravity chairlift for this place."
In the end, Tony wrapped himself deliberately in the whips, praying nothing would short circuit, immobilizing Whiplash unless he chose to let go, which he didn't, and that gave Steve the opportunity to pound the guy into a pulp. They stood over his unmoving body for several seconds, both breathing warily, waiting to see if he would twitch. Tony rolled him over with his boot. Broken neck. Good thing this asshole wouldn’t be bothering them again, but bad that he couldn’t ask him any questions. He reached down and ripped the chestplate with the broken arc reactor of the guys chest. That was the moment the reporters had apparently figured it was plenty safe now and a whole herd of them came charging through one of the gates, ignoring any and all security personnel that were trying to hold them back. Steve looked at Tony, a flash of panic in his eyes.
." That made Steve laugh and Tony, encouraged, continued: "Can we go do the manly thing now and fuck our feelings away?"
Then it turned into a blur of Rhodey going "Never mind!" And Steve apologizing profusely for Tony's lack of discretion and Tony cackling like a maniac, muffled by Steve's hand.
“I’m so sorry, Buttercup. I’ll make sure to use only manly nicknames for you.”
' that his heart had sung triumphantly, that had been the most significant aspect of the experience. Steve wanted Tony to be his and Tony would be treating him like one big, giant joke, and he would drag out Steve's fantasies for all to see and ridicule.
Steve shaded his eyes while craning his neck to look at the top gallery of the Colosseum. A little rough around the edges after 2000 years, of course, and not accessible to the public, but he doubted Hydra would abide by those rules. They'd discussed the day's program in the touring car, or school bus, as Tony insisted on calling it. He'd been very not pleased with the milling around while waiting for transport, said transport, the tour group, the tour group leader, the lack of regular caffeine stops and a whole lot more. Spoiled little rich boy. Steve had finally elbowed him and told him he was being an ass. Tony had actually looked embarrassed and mumbled something about regressing occasionally. That didn't seem like a welcome topic, so they'd tried to figure out what Hydra would do now that they were off the boat. They agreed a kidnapping was most likely, to force Corbin to work for them. "I'd say there's about a 70% percent chance they go for Corbin, 25% for us both and 5% that I am the target," Steve had said and Tony had agreed, give or take a few percent. So far they'd stuck to the tour group like glue and hadn't seen anything or anybody suspicious.
“No, Tony. You’ve done enough for me. I can never pay you back as it is. I knew when I shaved the beard that my time was up. Even if I wish we’d had longer…”
This was fucking useless. Tony fired his repulsors and got the hell out while his teammates dissolved into laughter.
"No, I'm Tony." Who or what the fuck was Bucky?
Tony’s brow creased in frustration.
“I’m already wet, it doesn’t matter. I-”
“My husband, King Urien, didn't like what I was doing, and he chose to express that displeasure thus.”
“Great. Tell him he is an ass and I will take his throne from him one day.”
“I used the spell McGonagall taught us.” Steve insisted.
As they came running across the deck, it was obvious what was wrong. Next to the ship a serpent had come rearing out of the water. It was twice as large and twice as pissed as the one they had dispatched yesterday, and Tony wondered for a fleeting second if this was mommy serpent. It was ugly and vicious and it smelled like briny death.
"Sorry," he manages. For the sneaking and the assuming and the embarrassingly bad Spanish.
little conversation about withholding information when I get back, I know that much.” A potential Hydra spotting demanded that Tony keep his wits about him, though.
"What is he seeing?" Tony didn't really care. The curiosity he felt about what could make Steve look so happy didn't compare to the rapidly rising dread that something was very, very wrong here. He needed to figure out what the hell was going on and the nasty cassocked bastard hadn't spontaneously started monologuing. Yet. Tony still had hope he could goad him into it.
“Tony?” Steve called from his room. “I think they’re done.”
“I developed this sudden craving for casseroles. I don't know why,” Steve deadpans.
"Mr. Stark. You think you're the only superhero in the world?"
After collecting his duffel bag from his hotel room, he went to the bank. He withdrew a truly stunning amount of cash and wondered if he would ever get so used to living in the twenty-first century that $10 was not going to seem like a lot of money. Then he went to see a dealer and spent a few hours there before dropping an insane amount of money on a motorcycle and a helmet with a tinted visor. He started driving west just as the sun was starting to get that late afternoon golden glow.
"Sorry about that. Maybe we shouldn't have tried to squeeze 70 years into 17 hours."
“Have you done this with a guy before?”
“Because you’re a fucking shark too, Steve! You need to get that into your head. Stop acting like a minnow. Stop letting us intimidate you. Besides, he knew I’d boot you in the arse if you weren’t getting the message. Which I will do with much aplomb if you don’t get your arse over there in thirty seconds.”
"I could have, but that would not have been half as entertaining."
When he finally stood in front of Steve, his heart was beating in his throat and his palms were sweaty and he just stood there for a second, struck dumb by the blue of Steve’s eyes. What he wanted to do was kiss him and hug him and never let go. With the reporters crowding behind him, he had to settle for shaking Steve’s hand firmly and squeezing his shoulder, briefly, while they traded stilted pleasantries. It was woefully inadequate. When Bucky stepped up and wrapped Steve in a bear hug, Tony had to suppress a snarl at the unfairness of it all. Especially when Steve closed his eyes and just kind of collapsed against his friend, barely staying upright as he clutched fistfuls of the ugly mall cop uniform. Tony thought he heard a choked off sob. He knew he was standing too close, crowding Bucky’s back, but he couldn’t make himself back up as he clenched his fingers into impotent fists.
Tony's stomach swooped and his face flushed. Steve surely hadn't meant that as the plea Tony was hearing, but he couldn't help hearing it that way. Not while Steve was looking at him with that intensity. And maybe he
“...And congratulations.”
It was Thursday evening and everybody was home. Nobody wanted go out in this weather, of course, but also, Bruce was making vegetable lasagna for dinner and nobody in their right mind would miss
“Hey Nat.” He wondered if he sounded as flat as he felt.
"I believe you. I noticed he has remarkably strong opinions at times." She paused. "So did Nick, much to his chagrin."
“Dunno. Haven’t tried it. Right now I just feel a kind of pull in my belly and I am really tired. I’m gonna wait a bit and see if I can beat this thing.”
"I see. Valuable life lessons, all. Are we handing these out to disadvantaged children at an orphanage?"
say about unilateral decisions?”
Before Steve could voice his serious misgivings, Jarvis announced the first guests and Tony pulled Steve next to him. If Steve had expected an outcry at the break in tradition, he was sorely mistaken. They were minutely raised eyebrows, little creases of disapproval around delicately painted lips and many, so many inquiries about where the Rogers family originally hailed from.
Oh. Way to put your foot in it, Steve. Compound the grief with trauma, why don't you? He scrambled for something to say.
He finally settles on: “She's not.”
And part of it, to be honest, was just that he plain felt sorry for himself. Poor Tony, all alone so far from home, finally finding someone he thinks he can love and then fate sweeps him away. It wasn’t exactly Dying Young, but it still sucked. At the same time, he was wondering why the hell he was so hung up on a guy he’d seen four times. He went back and forth between feeling sorry for himself and feeling stupid for feeling sorry for himself, until he finally figured that he’d never know if he was just projecting or that there really was something between him and Steve. But what he did know was that some people you fucked and you knew deep down it’d never amount to anything and some people you slept with and it was full of hope and potential, even if you didn’t really know the person yet. So after that he could go back to just feeling sorry for himself.
A small redheaded woman slid into the booth opposite of Steve. He was just about to take a bite of his toast, but he lowered it back down as he looked at her.
"Indeed," said Steve, "Quite the silver fox."
“Speaking of. Bruce is visiting on Saturday Wanna come out for drinks?”
the paparazzi involved. Besides, the government has multiple agencies funded by my tax dollars that employ people specifically trained for this kind of work!”
There were going to be four people in his tower at Christmas? Tony must have looked a little poleaxed, because suddenly Steve turned to him. "Oh. That is, of course, if it is alright with you that we do Christmas here, Tony. I guess we should have asked first, maybe." Steve really was a decent guy. Old fashioned manners and all that.
"How do you know?" Percival seemed genuinely curious.
“I see. And now I see why he’s wearing Thistlethwaite, while you stuck with that dandy.”
“Port city?” Steve perked up.
Good. This meant he was back to suffering from a case of good old fashioned lust. Which was a relief, honestly, wanting to make cow eyes at Steve in the moonlight last night had been hugely uncomfortable. This was more familiar territory, if a little inconvenient and distracting when chasing down evil doers. He looked up at the man striding next to him and when he caught Steve's eye, they both smiled. Tony's mouth went a little dry. Really fucking inconvenient and distracting, but what were you going to do? Besides the obvious. Which wasn't going to happen.
This time it was much, much worse though. It had taken him a few weeks to even learn the language, for starters, because for all that it was supposed to be English, it really wasn't English that he recognized as such. He'd wandered around for a few weeks, trading manual labor for food and board while he was getting his bearings. Said food was another thing. No potatoes or tomatoes, no rice, no tea, no spices, it was weird. When he'd ended up at King Arthur's court he'd decided to stay put for a while. His prowess with his shield earned him a place between the knights, and since he had no clue where else to go, it was as good a place as any. But if he was making any effort to fit in, it was half hearted at best.
Steve moans.
That, at least, proves Steve hasn't taken complete leave of his senses.
"Really? Tony, they are harmless!"
"Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Well, we don't know if these people were random visitors or even spectators, or if they are actually government employees, do we?"
Steve looked back at him, a small smile on his lips. "Twenty two hours and thirty seven minutes."
back to the cabin, shall we?” Stark was laughing at Steve, obviously proud of his accomplishments and apparently used to JARVIS being less than deferential. He started walking away, distractedly yammering sotto voce at JARVIS, but when Steve didn't immediately follow, Stark reached back and snagged his hand. Steve felt his face heat and even if that had mostly subsided by the time they reached their cabin, he still felt slightly drunk and off-kilter when they got there. And so very, very conscious of all the calluses and scrapes on Stark's hand and how warm and solid it felt in his own.
It was almost 2 am when J.A.R.V.I.S. announced Steve's return. Tony hoofed it up the stairs and arrived in the kitchen at the same time as Steve. Looking Steve up and down he decided that whatever Steve had gone to do it hadn't been a happy thing. He breathed a little sigh of relief that Steve apparently hadn't gone and gotten laid or anything, but then told himself off for being that petty. Not that it would shock anyone that he was petty. Still, he could strive to be a better than that.
“Will do.”
Tony suppressed a shiver.
"You people...." Tony offered calmly.
Goat Man is squatting by a heap of electrical cords and Steve can only see his back. The old grey t-shirt is wet between the shoulder blades and the size of the dark pit stains is impressive. Short damp strands of dark brown hair stick to the back his neck. The cargo shorts are pulled tight around his ass by his position and Steve swallows hard at the way they dip down in the back showing a strip of black underwear and a sliver of moist tan skin where the t-shirt got rucked up and sticks to the man's trim, muscled back. Steve wants to touch that skin, knowing it will be sticky and he should find that gross, but he doesn't. He wants to slide his hands over that ass, too. This freaks him out, because he can't remember the last time he wanted to touch anyone that way. It was before, no
He started by making a point of saying 'my husband and I' wherever he could fit it in. Then he followed up by running everything by Del. "The atrium pool is quite nice, isn't it, Del?" "We weren't very impressed with the breakfast buffet, were we, Del? Were your eggs any good, doll? The breakfast burrito was kind of dry, wasn't it?" Steve looked at him a little oddly first, but then played along quite happily. When Tony took his hand and interlaced their fingers in the space between their plates, he gave Tony a smile. He hadn't smiled since the scene at the pool that morning and it made Tony lose his train of thought for half a minute. Thirty glorious seconds in which he smiled dumbly at Steve and hoped to god the guy had not noticed how sweaty Tony's palms had gotten all of a sudden. The senior contingent was a little taken aback at this sudden turn of events, but to give them credit most of them took the fucking hint and made an effort to be more gracious by including Steve.
"Aren't you tired?"
"If you turn around now and tell me you're sorry, but you're really straight, I am going to castrate you." Tony said. Steve didn't answer, wasn't even sure if he was able to articulate one, but pushed his erection against Tony's hip, making both of them groan.
“Because this is what my husband caught me doing.” She held out her left palm and suddenly a little green flame was dancing above it. Tony sucked in a quick breath. Actual magic! He didn't like magic, it fucked up perfectly good science and that was just wrong, because science was the best and should always win, but this was hardly Loki-level stuff.
“I heard you, I just don’t know what you’re talking about. Yes, my dad started Stark Industries, and I inherited it, but I’m not lost. I’m right here.”
dance with the instructor. Who danced so much better than Steve, it was no wonder he was enjoying himself, but common sense and Steve's feelings had apparently had a recent falling out and weren't on speaking terms.
“Jesus, Tony, will you shut up and fuck me already?!”
Steve shrugged and turned on his heel. His ass looked mighty fine in leather, as he walked away though. Tony wondered if he'd ever get to touch it again.
“Why’d you use Bruce for this? Why not yourself?”
“Sir has been told on many occasions that, no matter how well he thinks he sings while intoxicated, this is not factually true.”
“Stark, behave. Try not to antagonize your partner before we even start. Rogers, please take a seat.”
It was tiring. The crowds and the noise and the dazzling lights, they were pounding his senses. A persistent little headache throbbed behind his right eye and he needed to get out, if only for a bit. He made his excuses and went to catch his breath in a dark and cool hallway. He leant his back against a wall and rested his head on the cold marble. What the hell was he even doing here? He was so out of his element, it had gone beyond funny. He briefly considered leaving, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t leave Tony in there by himself. No doubt Tony would be fine without him, he’d done this before. Alone and in bad health. But Steve didn’t want Tony to be alone and he didn’t want him to be fine without Steve, especially if he didn’t have to. So Steve was going to take a couple of deep breaths and then he’d jump back into the fray.
The next day is Saturday and the goats are still there. Steve watches them silently while he drinks his morning coffee, Gwenna laying by his feet. None of the goats are close, so she doesn't feel the need to defend her house. It is kind of peaceful to watch the animals' aimless wandering as they search out the next shrub to eat. There is a cluster of them a couple hundred yards away, around what looks to be the beat up kiddie pool Steve spotted yesterday. Apparently that is how they get their water. He thinks he sees a tan man with black hair on the other side of the cluster, but the goats kind of block the view.
And it wasn't like he didn't want to, because honestly, he kind of did, right now, but he sure as hell didn't want Steve to think that he did. Because, really, all this friendliness and the sharing and, oh, let's not forget the waking up this morning draped all over a Steve who actually smiled in his sleep, all this had to be just a byproduct of being the only two sane people in a world full of crazy, right? But maybe, Tony thought, maybe they could use this experience to move beyond their endless bitch fests when they got back and build something more solid. Tony would like that. A lot.
Steve looked up sharply. "You're really going to build bombs?"
“Sure. Lemme get my tools. Have Thor pull it out from the wall.”
Tony turned his attention back to Steve. “That. And Fury's message implied Black Widow thought Hydra might show up around now. Although I have no clue why she would be involved in this. Me and Fury are going to have a
"JARVIS, lift the face plate or I swear to god I’ll rip it off!" The whole helmet retracted.
“So, listen Stark,” Fury began, “I have some stuff to tell you about your imminent death and your father…”
do you think we are?"
Clint hung up and Tony slid down the wall until he could drop his head onto his knees.
"I... Yes. It is."
"You sure?" Clint piped up again, "I'm not getting any lovey dovey vibes from them right now."
“It’s… yeah, it’s enough.  But I like living with you guys.”
“Bring Steve to the kitchen when he’s done,” she said, “I am going to cut his hair.”
"Wait here a sec," said Steve, while Tony dragged in a big gulp of air at the end of that overly long sentence. He came back five minutes later with two Santa hats.
