Cas looked at Dean with an urgent look on his face and pressed on. “You know, all of this is my fault. If I didn’t… If I wasn’t… I should have found a way to love her the way she deserves. I just… The moment I saw Mia’s face for the first time on an ultrasound, that I had made my wife go to, I was lost. I couldn’t go back. I needed to keep this farce up, to meet my daughter alive and healthy, even if that means, that the house is dark all day and that Mia is afraid to laugh.”
“Uh, Cas?” Dean started and didn’t know how to continue at first. “Does your mom have brown hair, usually tied into a strict bun, wears a grey suit and does your dad look like an almost bald businessman?”
Dean should probably tell him that normal babies could even understand when you told them you loved them, but maybe he should keep him in the illusion that their daughter was perfectly normal. Which she probably was. For a Nephilim.
Crouching behind a pile of old cupboards and stuff, Dean noticed his boss, who sat on a chair about 30 feet away from him and was surrounded by angels with big, impressive looking guns. The omega searched for his gang mates for a second until he found a few unconscious on the floor and a few being held hostage by other angels.
"Can I- can I call you Cas?" Dean asked, feeling slightly flustered. "You know, Castiel is kind of a mouthful." He felt Cas nodd and suddenly noticed that they were still in an awkward position, even if held loosely.
“Can you take her for a short moment? I need to adjust the car seat,” Cas said and put the seat on the ground.
“By the way,” she said and brought him back to the moment. “His name was Dick and he married one of the two girls a week ago.” Her grin seemed a little bit pained but it didn’t look like she still loved him. That was good.
As Cas handed the papers to one of Zack’s assistants, his uncle stepped self-assured in front of him and opened his arms. “Fellow angels and fellow demons. I’d like for you to welcome your new future leader, my nephew, Castiel Novak!” A few demons and all of the angels applauded hesitantly, and Dean shifted his weight more onto his healthy leg.
„Dean, you know I don’t require sleep.“ The angel said it in such a deadpan and irritated voice that the hunter had to suppress his laughter and saw Sammy doing the same through the back-mirror.
“Yes, but it wouldn’t make sense, because I should have felt the conceiving of a Nephilim back then, even in my closed of state.” The angel frowned and Dean’s heart melted at seeing his best friend question his disappearing angel abilities.
"What if I can buy myself out?" he suggested and earned himself a pair of raised eyebrows and a look that said 'this better be good'.
The omega was the first to moan this time, as their tounges touched and he could taste his soon to be mate properly. He needed more.
“Well, that person, he or she just stared at me, but her eyes were glowing bluish white. Or his. I drew a picture.” He pointed at the door of the room, but as none of the Winchesters reacted, he continued. “Also, there were wings. Like, they were more like shadows and not white and shiny, but I swear I saw them.”
That was not anything near the things Dean had imagined. How could this guy be the reason for the illness of his wife? Did he, like, shoot her or something? But no, this was Cas they were talking about. Sweet, innocent Cas, who loved bees and cheeseburgers.
In the end, everything comes tumbling down at the Winchesters as usual, so, who will survive? And who will feel the urge to sacrifice themselves in a true Winchester manner?
Dean knew that their mom was unconscious and that the monsters had personally promised to kill her, but damn did his younger brother's decision leave him in a tight spot for now as he was now alone in a room with four hungry werewolves.
“Okay, so, I mean, what about your wife?” Cas asked. Dean was glad, that there was the car between them because he still wasn’t comfortable to admit this information about himself to other men. Especially if they were the most attractive man existing, with shining blue eyes, dark, messy hair and pink lips.
Then, in the middle of a field, close to the borders of South Dakota, Minnesota and probably Iowa, in the light of a late September morning, their lips met silently.
“I’m sorry to disagree with you, in this case, Dean, but I have seen a lot worse in this kind of store.” The way he said “store” indicated, that he had already spent too much time on earth with them and Dean almost chuckled.
“Yeah, I think he will manage the thing with the caring for a baby and stuff, even if he’ll probably need a little help in the beginning,” the older hunter voiced feeling a kind of proud feeling talking like this about the angel. “What I am very certain about is, that he will put everything on his priority list below her when it comes to protecting, even us.”
It seemed pretty stupid now that they had just kissed, but that hadn't been Deans original intention when he wet in here. Cas still turned around and looked at him through the mirror as if to say that he could tell him anything. Well, he probably didn't know the stigma spun around the last spoken sentence, which was probably good.
"I will think about it, Sammy." The older Winchester knew Sam was right but didn't want to admit it.
‘Dean,’ a voice spoke up in his mind, and he really should get used to that. ‘Is Crowley a good man? Do you trust him?’ Their eyes met through the room, and Dean felt a sting of annoyance because his brain didn’t seem to have anything else to do but to think that his mate looked kind of badass and adorable at the same time.
“All right”, Mary sighed heavily but with a soft smile on her lips. “I suppose there is nothing we can do today but shower and sleep and, most importantly, sticking together. I can take the sofa.”
“Hey, hey,” Sam said, stretching out his arms as if to protect the two from each other. “Dean, calm down. Cas, tell us what you know.”
It was strangely easy to live with Jo. She was an easy woman with not many complaints about Deans behavior. At first, he had tried to hide it from her, but beside from cooking spaghetti and doing his one colored laundry, he had no idea how to have a normal life.
Feeling, that his legs were falling asleep, the older hunter got up and earned two questionable looks from his brother and his angel, who were comforting Glynn the best they could while she waited for the next contraction.
"You really think I would bring my only leverage here? You know I would never trust you that much, don't ya?" Of course, he knew. There was a reason he was the King.
There was a sudden crashing sound, as a large piece of the ceiling crashed into the war room table and broke its glass in a half. That reminded the hunter of the fact, that they should also long been squashed between bunker parts and he looked firstly up and then around to find not only the cement above them relatively intact but also an angel with outstretched hands holding it together with telekinetic force.
He looked back in Cas face and saw it split by a very gummy grin. The burgers had arrived during Deans explanation and he dug into his to avoid Cas gaze, that most certainly still lingered on him. He had a blush creep up his neck and his heart beating fast at the thoughts that the look on Cas face provided him with.
Dean was completely taken aback. Never in his life, he would have imagined meeting this woman to day in this bar, who somehow had exactly the same wishes as him. He wanted children; he wanted to settle down. He wanted it pretty bad.
“Get up,” a quiet but clear voice commanded from above him. Suddenly his limbs moved as if without his consent, and everything inside of him tingled from the alpha voice the other had used.
At that, Cas looked a little bit surprised and then strangely disappointed. “Dinner sounds great, but,” he trailed off.
Changing into their FBI suits in the car became more and more a challenge with age, but they didn’t have time to waste. As they entered the building, that was probably made for communal activities, a nice young lady at the entrance told them where to go. At the sight of her cleavage Dean thought of sheep. A lot of sheep.
“Yeah, I thought, I could…” Dean started but was directly interrupted by the angel. He had an unusually urgent look on his face as if he wanted to make the other agree with him on something, at the best very fast.
“Dean, are you all right?” a worried Cas asked after he had turned around from the other of his kind.
“Breathe,” he said, thinking back at all the times there had been a birth in Dr. Sexy M.D. “You have to breathe, in and out, that’s right.” Her eyes looked into his, but she seemed to be in a kid of pain-delirium and it seemed as if she couldn’t really focus.
Ten minutes before they agreed to meet in front of Dean's car, Dean emerged from his house and saw that Cas was already standing there. He had a baby seat in one arm and Mia on the other. And he was still gorgeous, his hair standing out in every direction but in a sexy way and his blue tie matching his eyes.
Glynn was at the end of her strengths now Dean noticed as he forced his attention back to her. Her eyes slowly closed and her breath seemed to slow down, even if she needed to push. She really needed to push, or both of them, mother and child would die.
“A little practice could help me, actually, I think,” Dean said and looked up at Cas bending over the backseat of his Baby. Oh boy.
And who was also quite pregnant. Dean couldn’t say how far, because he normally didn’t talk to too many pregnant women, but it looked like about two-thirds through.
"It- it's Dean." Graceful way to start, Dean. His brother raised his brows and seemed to amuse himself way too much.
“Hey, Sammy,” Dean tried to stage whisper, looking down at his already sleeping daughter. “You know what date it is?”
Before anyone could respond they were interrupted by a cry, even louder than before. In an instant, all three men were bent over the small looking woman with the huge stomach and held her hand as well as rubbed her back.
Dean wondered again, why he bonded so easily with the redhead next door, as he approached the Novak’s porch. He felt as nervous, as the day he asked Bela Talbot to be his prom date.
“Okay, let me find some spare blankets then.” Sammy grinned at Dean suggestively, and the latter felt his face heat up despite his usually good self-control. He opened his mouth to protest, but Cas had already sat down on the only bed in the room and held out his arms to take their daughter from Dean. Her eyes were already closing, which was no wonder regarding the day she had had. To be honest, Dean had expected more sleeping and also more feeding, but then again, she wasn't entirely human, was she?
“I want what he would have wanted! I want all Nephilim dead, because they are abominations!” He almost screamed the words out, and the older Winchester wondered why his attitude was so different to the one of the other angels they had met eight months prior.
"Had your second told you," Zack addressed a confused looking Crowley, "that he had gotten himself a little mate just recently? I couldn't believe it either when I heard it's my beloved nephew here. I've always had big plans for him."
“Dean, I don’t know, if you know this, but a student teacher relationship is something illegal,” He deadpanned and Deans grin grew wider. “Besides, I’m not interested.”
They had prepared this one nicely; it should go like clockwork. Two other men and one woman were behind Dean with guns, and one guy was waiting in the car with a running engine. The Winchester was the one to turn towards the cashier like most of the times and make sure he didn’t pull a gun or press an emergency button.
“Dean Winchester,” a sudden bodyless voice rang in the addressed ears. “Give us the child and we leave the rest of you alone.”
"Wow, that's awesome, Sammy," Dean uttered, his own problems forgotten for a second. His brother would really make it, he would really get the life he deserved. A Family, pups. A quiet life.
“Yeah,” Dean said, already getting nervous about his following talk with Cas. He tried to think of an excuse to go over as early as this evening but he did not want to disrupt anything.
He tried to sit up but grabbed something soft as he wanted to push himself up with his hands. Turning his head to the side confirmed, that Cas was lying next to him, but apparently not conscious and for a second, he almost panicked. Then he remembered.
The angel’s lips were chapped but soft and Dean would have receded after a chaste kiss if it hadn’t been for the other, who put a hand to his neck and drew him closer.
He realized, that no matter what, they would love the hell out of the little girl if she wanted it or not. She was already part of the family and every person on this table would probably hold their hand in the flames for her if not worse.
“I can sense one human and one angel, but as you know my abilities are not that good right now,” Cas denoted with a hint of sadness in his voice. “If we get in from the backdoor and not though the destroyed front door, they should not see us immediately.”
“What the hell,” Dean whispered and lowered his gun by an inch. He mimed Sam to search the church, but even if there still was something here, it must have heard them by now.
"Crowley," Dean exclaimed loudly after entering the big loft above the diner, what made everybody stare at him. He just needed to pretend that nothing could affect him to keep his place in the gang.
They had found mysterious deaths in a small town in Michigan called Greenville. With no other hunter available in this area at that time, the Winchesters jumped in the Impala and rode of. Well, they probably didn’t jump, and Dean’s frown could probably be seen till Canada, but he liked to change the colour of the events a little, when he wrote them down in their Men-of-Letters/Hunters-diary.
“Why didn’t he know about the other angels?” the older Winchester asked as Cas finally shifted his weight back onto his heels to get up and he could breathe normally again. He had almost given in to the urge to lean in and take a deep intake of that scent he could never get out of his brain, but he could sustain. Barely.
But the best thing was the big, green garden, that was reachable through the glass doors and the veranda that led there. They went upstairs to verify that they had four bedrooms, two for the kids they wanted to have and one additional for each of them.
“’And in the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents’,” Sam recited what was written underneath the picture.
"The amount of recorded true mates has gone down over the centuries, and it is to be warned to believe and omega, yeah, whatever." There was a long silence afterwards, in which Deans panic slowly started to increase. This was precisely what had happened. But it sounded as if Castiel had no other choice but to get mated to him and that was a fate, nobody should be burdened with. Hell, what happened to free will after all?
They tried to source out every hunt possible, because they couldn’t afford to be short on a man when shit came down around them.
“She is very lucky, having you as her parents”, she said, and all of the sorrow of not having been able to raise her own children seemed to resonate in her voice. But then again, it could also be the sorrow of seeing another child’s life beginning in a hunter family, which rarely turned out well.
“She needs to push now,” Sam uttered loudly over the rumbling sound of the earthquake-like movements around them.
“Well, this woman and the other guy in that ch-“ The hunter stopped. The other really didn’t know. Something was going absolutely wrong in heaven, or this guy was just an idiot.
Of course, even though the older hunter had been away for more than ten minutes, nobody had even moved towards the door to close it. Typical.
"His name's Zachariah. Tried to turn Crowley and the others into mousse because of that thing but I beat him to it." There was a hint of bitter humour to the omegas voice and he wasn't able to look into his alphas eyes. The alphas. Whatever. Telling somebody you had been injured in a car crash when almost all of their family had died in one was bad enough, but stating it was actually your fault...
“There was a lady a few days ago who asked the same questions. Do you know her?” an elderly man at the local bar asked, and Sams's eyes snapped up from the investigator's block he had been scribbling on.
Before Dean could even do so much as blink after that, the unknown angel had an angel blade in his chest and was glowing like a streetlamp out of his eyes and mouth. Then it was suddenly very dark and silent for a second.
Even if her family was beyond normal, she loved it with every beat of her heart. What if her elderly sister had dark hair and blue eyes while her brother had brown eyes and she green ones and they both had sand-colored hair. She still was the greatest older sister one could ever imagine, reading books to Mary because she was not so fast at that and playing family with them.
The alpha got up slowly as if to not scare a wild animal and lowered his face towards Deans. For a second the omega thought he would kiss him and was kind of glad he didn't because he wouldn't have known what to do then.
He dug right in, both hands on the other man’s cheeks, feeling his stubble scratch at his palms. Even though the blue-eyed man’s lips were chapped most of the time, they felt even softer than Dean had imagined. And Dean had imagined a lot.
As soon as the woman gave him the address, scribbled neatly on a piece of paper, the omega tried to bolt out of the shop. Outside he needed a few attempts to type the address in his phone since his hands were shaking badly. Maybe he should have brought his gun.
“Yeah,” the older hunter smiled a little bit but didn’t want to let the younger of the hook just like that. “But what exactly do you mean.”
The end of her sentence came out in a rush but Dean got her point. This was not the place to think about his weird relationship life, but to support his wife who was in great pain and fought like a warrior. That’s how he had to view it, he decided. As a battle for the sake of his children and Dean was an excellent fighter.
They followed the plan nonetheless and send the guy home after he had forgotten them. Then they decided to take shifts watching the flat, until they would meet up with Glynn the next morning to let her in on the supernatural world. The only things that happened in these few hours were, that the roommate returned from work and Dean drove himself crazy with his own thoughts.
Once arrived next to Sam at the parking lot, the angel in his head piped up again. “Wait, Dean, if we are really dealing with angels, we should better make me invisible,” Cas said and the hunter got a glimpse of him in front of an open book in the diner. Did he get that one from Dean’s mind or…? “Though if they are really angels, they probably already know.”
Sorry for the short chapter, humans, but those guys are up to something, and I felt like cutting the chapter here :D
Dean nodded in the Phone. “Yeah, now that you say it, I was too much occupied with worrying about Cas loading all this shit on his shoulders to think about his wife. Do you think it’s possible to help her?” He started to feel a little bit guilty for not having thought about that earlier. If she never got out of her room and always wanted silence and the darkness Dean had seen when he came for Cas on Saturday, she was probably also living a shitty life.
“I told her she should try to be quiet here because we don't want to be found, but I don't know how much of that she really understood. She seems to communicate in emotions rather than concepts.”
Thinking back at his life until now there had probably only been one thing that he ever did right and that was building a life with Jo. And even that had been done in a way, that kept Dean awake at night because he thought about how she could have a better life and would presumably leave him one day as well.
They packed their things and headed out three hours later. Believing in extra-terrestrial beings, Glynn always had her dearest possessions packed and Dean should be glad for it, but it was still a little bit weird. People who didn’t have a prove of the supernatural should life a completely ordinary live, occasionally get saved by hunters and definitely shouldn’t worry about stuff they couldn’t change anyways.
“Yeah, actually, I don't know, yeah. She said she was working for the newspapers.” He looked down at his empty beer mug, and Dean ordered him another with a wink of his hand.
“So here is the thing. The babies came out two days ago, and I want you to meet William,” he lowered her down so she could touch his head briefly and she tried to repeat “Billam” at what every-body chuckled, “and Mary.” He also lowered her to the small baby bed in which normally both of the small humans slept and that was now only inhabited by the baby girl. Mia’s small hands gripped the cloth of the yellow blanket to see better and Dean could see a smile tugging at her lips.
“Dean,” Jo’s voice startled him out of his thoughts. “Relax,” she said with a calmness that was so typical for her. She would probably even peacefully go into death, possibly giving her life for others if the chance was given to her.
In a very weak moment, he had even tried to call Cas, but the other had just declined and written a short message. 'I'm sorry, Dean, I can't talk right now.' Well, way to go Winchester.
“Since she,” Cas started and seemed to be looking for the right expression, “exited the womb, I can understand what she wants to say a lot better. I told her about her wonderful family, how much she is loved, and she asked me kind of why she can’t communicate with you two the way she does with me. So, I told her, she can show it with her face and her earthly powers and she did.”
Cas just bluntly said: “No, I’m very sure you are not,” and Dean almost chuckled. But it was not the time, nor was he a man to chuckle. They needed to concentrate. They needed to think about how to raise the most wanted kid on earth, heavens and what else there was. They needed to overcome their problems and find some short-timed peace.
“What means what?” Dean was now wholly confused. He had been determined to go, but this weird, attractive stranger seemed to know something he didn't possess the knowledge of that was affecting him.
Cas nodded in resignation. „Alright,“ he said, bunched up his coat and used it as a pillow against the window. And if Deans eyes closed after their daughter had fallen asleep and he sunk onto his angel's shoulder, not even Sam was going to mention it.
But he couldn’t let this happen. Cas deserved something way better, he deserved to be happy, whatever way that was and Dean was poison. Everybody around him died and/or lost everything they had.
The older Winchester frowned and looked down at the guy’s face. He didn’t seem to be older than twenty-five and the bleeding nose Sam had caused suited him well. He supposedly had wanted to harm the mother of his child and probably his child as while, what made boiling hot anger coil in Deans stomach.
The arrival of Jody and the girls is celebrated and things don't tend to stay as happy and calm as one wished.
The sound of his brother clearing his throat was what got Dean out of his trance. He hadn't even noticed he had been staring at his own door until now.
They kept on talking about Sam’s life until Dean thought it was time to check on his pregnant wife and go to bed. Since she was pregnant and had to stay mostly at home for the last months, they were both a little bit on the edge, feeling that it was getting serious now.
By now they had told Glynn about the very probable possibility, that she wouldn’t survive the birth and never see her daughter by herself.
“If we want to do this, we need to get rid of the other passenger, my dear,” the witch said and for a split-second Dean wanted to get all defensive, but then he understood. He licked his lips and looked over at his seemingly calm brother.
“Well, becoming a dad.” The sentence didn’t seem to end there so Dean waited. “Together… with Cas.” Ah, cat’s out.
Not only wasn’t this a promise somebody intended on keeping but there was also no way, that Dean would ever give up his unborn child for anything. She was already a Winchester, dammit!
He said the last part very quiet and Dean had to admit there was this constant nagging feeling in him as well to get closer to the other. So, he just nodded and tried to straighten up a little more. One could at least scratch together the last bit of dignity there still was.
It started to get hard to keep a steady, demanding voice, but he wouldn't be Dean Winchester if he couldn't manage that.
That way, Dean told the alpha everything about his family he thought was save to be known. The death of his mother in a house fire when he had been four, the time he had to act as a mother and father to Sam since their dad had started to drown himself in alcohol and shady business. When Cas asked how he ended up robbing fuel stations, Dean just said he needed to pay for Sam's college. It was not as if there wasn't a part in himself that enjoyed what he did, but he somehow didn't want the other to know.
Cas crocked his head. “Dean, you have to know that I would never act like your body is my real vessel. I can stay in the background, even shut off from all outer influences if you want.”
“Cas, can you… you know, go somewhere for a second?” the older hunter thought while picturing the diner he had seen the angel in before.
The relative small room inhabited fifteen people, who were currently sitting in a chair circle. In the middle of them, there was a collage of what Dean could only just identify as creatures from above. One specific, very bad drawing of a four-winged creature caught the hunters eye immediately. With the strict clothing of a tie and white shirt, it reminded him a little bit of Cas, but it probably resembled also every other angel.
"Am fine. You remember Jess? I introduced you two last time you visited." Dean nodded even if his brother couldn't see him. "Well it's getting pretty serious, and I plan on asking her to marry me."
After Cas had slept over last week, he had immediately called Hannah, Hael’s sister as Dean had finally found out. He had known, that the families were very religious, but those names were still kind of weird.
“Okay, whatever you do, do it fast,” Dean could hear his concerned brother’s voice, closer, than he had expected.
Dean thought about getting out and holding the door for him, but he abandoned the idea pretty fast. After all, everybody on school ground seemed to know him and Dean didn’t want to embarrass him this way.
It was getting rather late, and as Dean seated himself behind the driver, as far as possible from the other passengers, he watched the sun go down above the fields and occasional houses. It would be nice if the fire under his skin wouldn't be driving him mad.
Jo didn’t, and Dean could not suppress the feeling, that she was a little bit relieved to have someone to talk to. Even if it was a stranger in a crappy bar, that she knew less than twenty minutes.
“So, that’s why you want to touch her stomach to check, if the baby is supernatural?” the hunter asked and prayed to Chuck, that it would just be a regular kid and the girl was crazy. “All right.”
I could hold against him. And I’m sorry about what I have to say next,” he said and seemed to ready himself for what was about to come by taking a deep breath. Dean knew he would have started shooting before the signing if Cas hadn’t stopped him through their bond and he still really wanted to. Action, not talking, but that obviously wasn’t his mate’s style.
“Please take my uncle outside,” Dean heard Cas utter towards two men behind him, and they obliged immediately. Zachariah, of course, didn’t leave without a protest, but as soon as he was gone, a noticeable amount of tension left the room.
The alpha in front of Dean started to slowly put all the money from the cash box into a bag after having opened it while looking way too relaxed for a guy being robbed.
“Everything seems to be all right,” the doctor said in a softer tone and startled all three present Winchesters, who were staring in trance at the monitor. Monster, yes. Self-doubt: all the time. Dying and loosing each other: daily routine. But seeing a tiny human being, that would soon be included in their family on a screen left them all completely speechless.
"How are you feeling?" Cas asked, brow furrowed. Dean motioned for him to sit down in the armchair. He suddenly really wanted to give the other a blanket or a pillow so he could rub his scent all over those and Dean never had to let it go again.
“Oh, he told me to watch the woman, as I did and let him take over, when the time has come. Do you think I’m some kind of prophet or something?” he asked, and the brothers lifted their eyebrows.
"Keep me updated," Sam hastily fit in before Dean ended the phone call and stared at the device for some time. Maybe he should at least talk to Cas. Maybe he just wanted to hear that deep voice again.
"That- that is what you caught from that?" The others scent started to smell more and more like frustration, and everything in Dean screamed at him to do anything to please his alpha. Wait, his alpha? Where had that come from?
“Cas, you are dripping wet, you can’t go in with Sam without raising suspicions,” Dean hissed towards the angel next to him and the other two raised their eyebrows.
Anna, blunt as she was asked when the first babies would pop out as soon as everybody sat on the table, which made the soon to be wedded couple turn a quite dark shade of pink. Dean chuckled at that until Anna turned to him and his mate and asked them to spend their next rut/heat at Dean's place because she couldn't stand that.
“All right, all right,” the older hunter tried to reassure her, but it was a lost cause, what meant they had to be quick. Sam wetted a towel and Dean wrapped the squealing infant in it as if it was his everyday job. Maybe he was slowly getting a hang on anything.
Cas face broke into a wide smile immediately, and the hunter decided to drop his forehead to the other’s neck so that he didn't see his face actually reddening as he felt it did. This had never happened to him with any girl before as he tended to be very confident there. Or at least he pretended to be.
What happened next was kind of what Dean had expected and kind of not. He instinctively bared his throat as what his brain claimed as his alpha lowered his nose towards it.
“I am saying,” Sam took a deep intake and made himself smaller, or at least tried, that Sasquatch, “that I think, Cas feelings for you have started to go beyond friendship. And I’m not implying something.” He raised his hands as if to hold Dean of if necessary, or maybe as if to surrender. “I just think you should probably talk to him, especially regarding your upcoming parenthood together and regarding that he will stay here for longer times now and…”
“You want to appeal to paragraph forty-nine,” Crowley exclaimed before anybody else could say anything. “If the current leader is too weak or mentally compromised to lead…” He left the last words hanging in the air, but even Dean got what he was saying. Cas could get rid of his uncle for good.
So, when they had sex for the first time, with someone they both weren’t really attracted towards, there was a lot of laughter and a video on the laptop for Dean. He promised Jo to prepare himself beforehand the next time and they went to bed in Deans motel room.
He got a permanent marker from the car and with the help of Cas drew fast but efficient the Enochian sigil. He also scribbled another one, because Cas wasn’t sure how powerful the angels could have been and he had only used the first one when he had been human for a while. The reminder of that brought up a wave of guilt, that Dean had thought to be over with and he swallowed it down quickly.
"You have to stop saying please, or I don't know how to control my inner alpha anymore," he growled, and Dean felt himself slick even more.
“I understand, that you want a paternity test, but after you have seen the outcome, you will have to admit, that you are in this with me.” She eyed Cas, who was again standing next to Dean and had a look of concentration on his face.
“I didn’t know that you were that stupid, Dean Winchester. Did you really think, that angels showing themselves to humans wasn’t a trap for the most famous hunters these days?” He let the word “famous” sound as if it was poison and Dean could only roll his eyes.
“You know, I mean you don’t know, because I never told you about it, but my own mother was not very… motherly herself,” Glynn continued, and Dean dried his hands with a towel laying around. He was normally very good at faking interest in people’s life stories, after all it was part of the job, but this time he really wanted to hear what his opponent had to say. Maybe he could tell it to their daughter one day if her mother couldn’t do it herself.
The omega arrived at a narrow two-storey building in a row of similar ones. He found the call button with the name Novak on it, a detail the lady had explained to him as well, and rang it. There had been only a few times in his life when Dean had been this nervous.
As the other didn’t pull back after an appropriate time for a man-hug, the hunter allowed himself to take a deep intake of that scent he had thought about earlier. It was just as astonishing, as he remembered it, some kind of honey like smell but triggering the same feelings you get when you stand in the woods after a heavy summer rain.
At that, Cas turned his surprised face to look right into Dean’s eyes. “Yes,” he said and a warm little smile spread across his face and lit it up from the sadness about his wife. Castiel’s wife, Dean thought. He also registered, that their faces were now only about ten centimeters apart and his breath hitched in his throat despite everything.
Alex held one up with a purple vampire bat printed on the front, that said: “Getting teeth sucks”. They even had found one with an AC/DC logo on the front and it almost made Dean’s eyes water a little bit.
Dean thought that the wailing of an infant had awoken him for the second time this night, but the sound was a lot more distant that it should be. Opening his eyes, he saw first that Cas had closed his and was facing him and that this daughter between them was wide awake.
When the evening arrived, Dean looked at the watch of his phone like every five minutes, but the time had to come, that he told Cas some kind of excuse, something about having some paperwork to do and he guided his mate out to his car. The good-bye-kiss lasted longer than it probably was socially acceptable and Cas looked at him questionably, but he just winked and wished him a good night’s sleep. Then he went upstairs and stared after the beige car, disappearing into the night.
For the last three months, he had had a solid job as a mechanic in a garage and was still living in a motel room. As if something inside him told him to be always on the edge and ready to leave. He wondered if this was because of the fact that he had never in his life lived somewhere longer than two years and he had been a toddler back then. His dad's job as a militarian meant that they had to change their place of residence every few months and that left Dean apparently in the opinion that he had to keep up with this tradition.
Was Sam right? Were Dean’s weird, blubbering feelings, that often made his chest tight, and sometimes his pants, actually required?
Well, all right, they had three duffel bags with clothing for three and weapons for twenty people with them, but for some reason, there was nothing to take care of a baby in his beloved Impala.
“It’s not your fault that your wife is in this state, she probably got depressions from the pregnancy and the outer circumstances and these are very serious. What I’m trying to say is, that you really could not have done a lot different, I mean you both decided to marry and being gay is really not your fault nor could you have foreseen it that well if everybody always tried to press you into a certain character. So, the ones to blame here are definitely your family members and Sam said you two should consider a doctor but also find somebody your wife trusted before you married, maybe a family member or a friend.”
There, in the cone of an old industrial light stood the angels, almost twice as much as them and they probably also had people outside.
Cas looked up at him then, and a barely visible smile played at his mouth, accompanied by a deep, worried crease in his forehead.
And smiled. She smiled one of those big, gummy smiles where you could actually see that there were no teeth in her mouth yet. Whatever Cas had said, it had probably been something about the hunter, who felt very stupid right now at his jealousy.
Nonetheless the hunter tried to sit up, realizing that he was laying in his motel bed and Sam was not in the room. “What- what happened,” he asked out loud and rubbed his hand over his face. Man, he stank like booze and old bar.
When he looked at his brother again, the other had lifted his eyebrows as if to ask if everything was all right. Dean rolled his eyes and then got out a pen and a paper. “Just dictate me what you want to say,” he thought, this time silently and the problem seemed to be kind of solved.
White-hot blinding pain shot through it as the werewolf now stomped on it, breaking it in half. Dean was good at masking his feelings but not that good, and he let out a high pitched scream.
“Okaaay,” his brother said in a long manner to leave room for explanations. As this didn’t happen, he continued: “Well, anyways, he went to meet her to talk about it, but she wasn’t in her flat and none of her friends has an idea where she is.”
The big package held a bathing tube and diaper changing mat they didn’t have time to buy yet. They made Glynn take off the wrapping paper, but Dean was still excited since it felt like the Christmas they never celebrated. When it came up in a few months they should really make a feast out of it, no child should grow up without traditions like that.
Dean took a step back, to decide if his stressed and sleep-deprived brain had just imagined the sound or if there was really somebody requesting him or his wife at that time of the day. Before he could fall in his downward spiral again he opened the door with a little bit more momentum than necessary.
Dean only knew, that there was a button for that since they had inspected the warehouse two weeks ago to search for any emergency exits, and/or possibilities for a trap.
“Yeah.” Sam looked up and blew his ridiculously long hair out of his face. “It’s the witness I interviewed today. Jim Walter.”
"Yeah, I'm fine," the omega answered automatically and earned a scolding look from his brother. "I mean, I'm in a hospital."
Tuesday came slowly, but Tuesday came and the morning of the day Dean felt as nervous as a teenager on his first day.
In only a split second, Cas had lifted his arms and pulled the other awkwardly into what he assumed was an I’m-glad-that-you-are-alive-hug.
“It’s perfect,” Jo laughed with a tear in her eye, gently bouncing William in her arms who fell asleep after being fed. She had complained about the weird hormones, that still hadn’t left her body, but the doctors had said that it was completely natural this way. That didn’t mean she had to like it, though.
It was as if somebody had flipped a switch. Being gentle at first, Dean found himself unable to hold back any of the bottled up tension after a few seconds.
"Cas," he started but had to make the other look into his eyes again first, by framing his face with a hand. "Have you ever knotted somebody before?" At the shaking of his head and the way he bit his lips, Dean had to lean forward for a second and bury his face into the other's neck. He took a deep breath of that intoxicating scent and grinned up towards his alpha.
If Cas had been raised in the family business like Sam and Dean had, he would have probably become the head of the gang one day. There was an unspoken arrangement within the Hell's demons, that as soon as Crowley deceased or disappeared, his second, Dean Winchester would step into his place. What meant that their first meeting would have gone a lot different. What meant, that that thing in the warehouse would not have ended well for the demons at all.
That didn’t mean, that Dean liked it of course. It was a chilly night in the end of October, barely above freezing temperature and Dean didn’t really take a warmer jacket than the usual leather.
Dean tried to remember how to talk until the guy came to a halt right in front of him and adjusted the little girl on his hip. She had even darker hair than her dad and little pink hair clasps in it. She was fast asleep and Dean had to suppress a sound adoration at the sight of her cute little face.
“They are sons of bitches.” “Or daughters of bitches,” Sam supplied helpfully but Dean had already turned around again to find somebody who worked here. They had to find and gank this evil bastard fast so Dean could get back to the bunker and to worrying about a certain stubborn angel.
Everybody shook hands and Dean placed Cas and Mia on Jo’s side of the couch, while he occupied armchair on her other side.
“I sensed her grace when I was sitting close to Glynn in the car,” the angel stated and took a step forward, still two metres too far away to accidentally clap on the shoulder. “I showed her, that I was there and… she seemed to be happy. She showed me the feeling of being save as if she wanted me to know that she trusted me. Trusted us.”
They bought a new bed for Mia because she had been growing out of the old one anyways and then carried Cas bed and other furniture over with the help of Sam and Charlie from the other side of the road. Dean also took his new housemates to the home-improvement market and while both men flirted shamelessly with each other, the small girl decided with the point of her finger on turquoise walls and a light purple carpet.
“I am searching for Cas- Castiel. He normally works here, maybe you can tell me when is his next shift?” Wow, that even sounded creepy in Deans ears. “I mean, I’m not a creep or something, just looking for a friend who went missing.” Now her eyebrows were disappearing underneath her fringes. Great.
He got quieter the more he said, but she probably understood as she raised her eyebrows. Before Dean could elaborate, though, there was a wail from inside of the car.
Living with Cas inside his mind turned out to be rather easy than weird. Of course, there were still moments, when Dean used the toilet or showered and very, very strongly tried not to think of Cas or picture him in any form. He didn’t dare to masturbate, what was really getting onto him the first two weeks but then he stopped caring.
Dean really had needed this, because he calmed down immediately, even though he yearned for more. They send each other weak smiles and exited the car.
Without the useless verbal confirmations of the other's wellbeing, Sam got straight to the point, reading the older Winchesters expression correctly.
"Shouldn't you rather be concerned if I dated him?" Dean asked because he didn't know what else to say. How much had Cas told her about him? "I'm not exactly the best person to... date," he concluded awkwardly.
One and a half month after the incident with the witch, a rather big hunt came up, which Dean and Sam wanted to investigate themselves, because it sounded fishingly like winged assholes. It was possible, that the research from before was related to this case and they didn’t want to risk sending anybody else there.
“Thank you,” he whispered to an exhausted but contend looking Jo. This would have never been possible without her, and he was eternally grateful for whatever made her stick with him.
“We are.” Dean thought, fuck it, and laid his hand on the angel’s and Sammy made gagging noises in the corner.
“No, I mean, of course, I think she needs a doctor”, Sam started in his lawyer voice again. “But first and foremost, I think she needs somebody who she had trusted before all of this had happened. I mean right now she kind of sees all the bad in her life in Castiel, so maybe we can ask him if he knows a friend or a family member else than him who she was close to in the past.”
He changed his mind, when the lady actually turned around to him, murmured “Castiel” and then attacked them with her very own angel blade. The bloodlust and rage in her eyes was something Dean would never forget but knowing the extent of his angel’s enemies was something he didn’t want to miss.
Dean nodded towards his angel and sighted. She needed to know. How old was the girl actually? She didn’t look older than twenty-six and she was going to die soon.
'They came into our house and threatened to get full custody for Anna if I didn't come with them to this meeting. They said they have people everywhere.' Cas eyes were wide with fear, and the omega really didn't like to see him in this situation. Or, like, in any kind of dangerous situation.
Okay, maybe Sam was the crazy one. “Yeah, see you,” Dean said as he walked away and left his baffled brother on the street.
“Actually, I am,” de dark-haired man said. “But it’s going to be alright after I told you my story.”
Entering the war room and seeing the people who were embracing each other made Dean widen his grin even more. Maybe the prospect of having a baby soon changed him, but he was happy to see the others and wanted to actually show this to them.
The happy smile, Cas sent his way made his heart flutter in a strange way. He opened the car and after Cas tried to coordinate the kid and the car seat in his arms for a few moments, he turned helplessly towards Dean. The girl was awake but still a little bit fussy, probably because she just got up.
Dean decided on showing that immediately, as he gracefully swept away the blanket, sitting down on the bed and pulling Cas after him.
“About that, ” Dean interrupted him, and after a short moment of thinking, covered their daughter’s ears. “What the hell, ” he whispered.
“Sorry for ruining the mood,” Cas started and Dean couldn’t believe his ears. This guy apologized for having a sick wife, how sick was that.
“What’s wrong?” His hair was so trousled that his older brother wanted to laugh, but they didn't have time for that.
Also, I know that Cas car is actually jubilee gold and not beige, but Dean sometimes isn't that accurate.
"Wait, Dean," the alpha said again and apparently tried to stop him by holding onto his arm. That was the worst idea he could have had however because only seconds later he was pressed face first to the side of the next building, where the security cameras couldn't reach them anymore and had a knife to his throat.
Dean had a dream. It kind of was a happy dream, where he lived the picket-fenced apple-pie live he had never dared to wish for, where he was content in a way maybe his brother deserved it but he didn't.
“Dean,” the alpha whispered, reflecting the desperation Dean felt roaring through himself. He eyed the button to call the nurse but seemed to refrain from reaching over the other.
After Sam had found a preservation spell, he had been looking through a few months ago, Cas laid down next to Dean and let his blue, shining grace float out of his body and into the one next to him.
“I don’t know, Sam. Something like that never happened. A Nephilim, angels, and demons in the same placer were the latter combine their forces? I never heard of a case like this.”
“You alright?” Dean asked when he collected them and their bags. The angel just nodded and hoisted their daughter's car seat onto his arm. Skylar would soon be hungry again, and the older hunter felt similar. On the other hand, he longed for the bed that would await him after nearly fourteen hours on the road. He stretched his back as soon as he dropped their duffel bags on one of the beds and wished he was twenty again.
Suddenly Dean felt like a teenager wanting to ask ‘do you really think so?’ but refrained from it. His brother didn’t have a lot of experience, but he was a logical thinking man and wouldn’t raise Deans hopes up if he didn’t have any indications for his theory.
Maybe Sam looked over at them and then turned away, a slightly disgusted but also smug smile on his face. Maybe all of heaven and hell and purgatory and whatever else there was, was after them, but right now Dean didn’t care at all.
“What do you want,” Dean asked from the floor with confidence he was not feeling. He felt warm liquid dropping down his neck and concluded that he probably also hit his head.
“She was all right, when she was in the flat, right?” Dean asked and dropped himself into the front seat of his Baby. “Everybody probably thinks she’s crazy anyways, so why bother. If she talks about the angels and stuff and what she might have seen, nobody will believe her.”
The meeting was set to two nights from now onwards and to another warehouse, this time without interior. Since the last one burned down because of Dean's explosions they had to move to less homey and more abandoned locations.
Of course, his little brother would ask this. During the last ten years, Dean hadn’t called once when he wasn’t in trouble. Either he needed Sam to get him out of arrest, or he was so drunk and lonely, that he longed for the voice of the only person who kinda somehow liked him.
"Couch," Dean pressed out at the questioning look of his brother, trying and failing not to show his pain. The doctors had advised him to stay another week, but every minute in that hospital just felt suffocating. With a groan, Dean was lowered to the black couch in the middle of his room on which he promptly laid down and closed his eyes. Who could have guessed that walking could be so hard?
"So, you want me to believe you're in possession of a drug, that makes people stronger and smarter with almost no side effects, except for addiction of course, but which nobody has seen for the last seven years?" Crowley asked in his exaggerating, dramatic way to which Dean just shrugged.
Dean shuddered involuntarily at that thought, both at the fear that scene would have brought to him but also at the arousal. Damn omega hormones.
He limped inside and noticed immediately, not only from a look but also from the smell that Cas wasn’t here. Damn, why couldn’t things be easy for once? After a few seconds of contemplating his options, Dean approached a short, brunette woman, who was currently stacking away snacks.
'Do you trust me?' Castiel asked through their bond, and Dean felt a calmness display not only in himself but also on the other's face. The omega just nodded shortly, and Cas turned his attention back to his uncle.
"He is an alpha, even if he doesn't seem like it, who has been rejected by his omega mate and had to spend his rut with the knowledge that he would probably never be with him. He has been sobbing and screaming your name in pain, not in arousal the last few days."
As Sam looked at him expectantly he closed his laptop hastily. “Eh yeah, Cas says, that angels do leave traces or something, but only if they want to.”
Sam went out to pay, what, apparently, signalized the angel in his head, that Dean was okay to talk.
“You’ll make sure I don't roll onto her?” he asked the angel while pulling his boots of. Despite having just lost what had been their home for the last years, the situation felt quite domestic.
Dean heard Cas chuckle and looked up again. Damn, if it weren’t for those blue eyes, Dean thought. But he would have fallen in love anyway.
"I let you guys talk," Anna stated with a pointedly look at Dean and all but stalked into the house. Cas cleared his throat awkwardly.
He had done this quite a lot in his past. He went to a bar, ordered a few drinks and ended up in someone else’s bed. His ongoing age didn’t mean he wasn’t attractive anymore, on the contrary; he seemed to become more handsome with every passing year. But something was off today. Something inside of him didn’t want to screw around anymore.
They didn’t try to expect too much and after the first failure in the first month, they just tried again.
Dean just had to smile. Castiel. Castiel had this mischievous look on his face as if he knew what Dean had been thinking. And Dean didn’t mind at all.
Dean only nodded but it seemed to be enough for the other. The older Winchester took out his phone and texted a short message to his brother saying something like: You need to come over to the flat.
“No,” Cas said, and it was silent for a moment again. “But what I wanted to say, before Dean interrupted me,” now he was only looking at Sam, “was, that women, who bear a Nephilim, have “weird little pains” beforehand and that that’s an indication for their death.” Air quotes and all.
As the bus arrived, Dean could already see from afar, that the driver was the same as the night he met Cas. How was that even possible. Bobby, as he had introduced himself last time just rose his eyebrows as the doors slid open. Dean smiled a little at the other's gruff face and got seated right behind him. He had to admit that taking the bus was not as bad as he had always phrased it, but he would really rather take his car. Which was located at a back alley close to the diner according to Crowley. Which he couldn't drive anyway because of his leg.
Dean’s breathing stilled and he reminded himself to hug back discreetly and not to either stand there utterly dumbstruck or squeeze the life out of his angel.
Having successfully changed the topic, Dean listened to Sam and Cas making a plan how to protect the woman and the child and how much to tell her about all of this. After all it was her child as well and there was a great chance of her ending up dead because of it. He leaned back and let the sense of work and battel overcome his insecurities; they would be coming sooner or later and the hunters needed to be ready.
“Okay,” Glynn nodded and Cas approached her carefully. “Don’t worry, it wont hurt,” the angel said, what she apparently hadn’t thought about, because now she looked more terrified than before.
Dean stepped out of the car and told the others what to do while they loaded about thirty bags and five packages of diapers into the vehicle. It was going to be a little bit cozy from now on but there was no need to stop for supplies for a while.
"Nothing, it's just-" To hell with it. "I met this guy, Castiel, but I call him Cas for short, he says we're 'True Mates' or something like that, because he could smell me through my scent blockers and he smells like heaven, but that can't be because, ya know, I'm- I'm not a mating type of person, true or not and I just thought, since you know everything about everything, ya know..."
“Okay,” Dean stated out loud and shook his head to get rid of his last thought. “Sam, do you remember what this thing on Cas’ stomach looks like?” The bewildered look on his brother’s face indicated a no, at what the older Winchester mumbled: “I will do it myself then.”
"How- how do you want me to..." he trailed off, turning slightly red again. "I mean, I'm gonna need to bit you and kn- knot you at the same time." Dean's eyes opened wide even if he hadn't meant to.
“Okay,” said Cas after he chewed a bite of his burger and cleared his mouth. “So, you two are more like partners in parenthood than romantically involved partners.”
“Sam, can you head to the next Walmart you see?” the older hunter whispered towards his brother to not wake the little baby girl up. Sam nodded and half an hour later Baby was standing in the parking lot of the South Sioux City Walmart, the occupants discussing who should go inside and who should stay in the car to be more mobile.
“No, you can’t,” Zack all but screamed out, all of his previous calm demeanour gone at the foresight of his failure.
“Because you’re an angel,” she said unsure and it sounded more like a statement than a question. “What else is there? Only angels, or…?”
The end of the sentence was almost unheard by the Winchester, because he had turned away, ducked through the entrance and shut the door forcefully behind himself.
“I should probably wash my teeth”, Dean mumbled and turned towards the sink even though Sammy would probably not even expect him to. “I actually wanted to talk to you”, he said to his own mirror image. “In private.”
“The contractions are about five minutes apart. We don’t have much time.” He didn’t say it but Dean could hear it.
"Hello Dean," Cas greeted him in his gruff voice, and a little bit of tension left the omega's shoulders.
"That's good," he exclaimed sounding like a happy puppy. "When will you meet him again?" His little brother, always the optimist.
I’m sorry, I needed to change the last part of chapter 7 of the first work of this series because some details were missing. I hope you don’t mind, it’s about the angels being involved in the conception of Skylar and because an angel reveals to Dean, that they tricked all parties into “producing” her.
His volume increased during his speech, but Dean knew he was just a colourful guy. If he ever found out, that the omega had him saved as 'Drama Queen' in his phone, he would never hear the end of it.
“Gwdsnmw,” the guy tried to mumble and Sam let him go a little bit. The moment Dean decided to kick him in the face, Cas appeared and the hunter changed it to an annoyed “What?”
"It's just me," he whispered, deciding they had talked enough and pulling the other down into a passionate kiss. But Cas wouldn't have it.
After he rang the bell, Dean waited almost two minutes, until a very sleepy looking Cas opened the door and blinked at him. Through the small gap above the dark-haired man, a very dark and colorless living room was visible, even though it was still bright and sunny outside. Dean tried to explain it with the fact, that Cas had obviously been sleeping before he opened the door, but this room didn’t look friendly or appropriate for a child in any way.
Flirt with him, Dean thought, I can do that. If you believed certain guys and some woman, he was very good at that.
"Hi, Cas, I hope you're not allergic to pasta." The alpha just chuckled, and Dean could be wrong, but he thought he heard a little nervousness in that.
It was only when he closed the door to his apartment that Dean noticed, he hadn't really stopped smiling since. Cas had driven him home in his horrible beige 1978 Lincoln Continental, but only after insisting on the other having dinner with them. Anna had grinned at them the whole time what had resulted in Dean blushing tremendously and Cas grabbing his hand under the table.
“I know, that it’s… weird,” Glynn started again. “But if I die, I know, that you are here to protect our daughter and I know, that she will grow up with more love than any child can ever comprehend.”
"Damn, Cas," Dean moaned in the alpha's mouth without thinking about it. This erected a chuckle from Cas which died down when he looked into Dean's eyes.
At that the angel lowered his gaze to his lap and Dean wanted to kick his brother for pointing out the shrinking powers of his… friend.
Dean almost grinned for a second at how adorable the other was and how much he didn't fit the (very outdated) cliché of a strong, self-confident alpha. But Dean didn't fit the omega clichés as well, so who cared.
“My family is very religious,” Cas finally started after a while. “You probably already noticed my weird name; it’s actually from an angel.” That made sense, Dean thought.
Dean noticed Cas hands shaking a little as he lowered himself down again, but his worries got clouded ower fast by the delicious scent in the room and the way their erections were only separated by two layers of boxers.
They sat down at the table after Dean had hung Cas jacket and at first ate in silence. It kind of was comfortable, and kind of wasn't since Dean knew he had something to ask for and didn't know how.
Cas eyes narrowed first in irritation and then opened wide. Food completely forgotten, he blinked a few times unbelievingly and Dean would think of it as funny if there wasn't so much at stake.
Despite the pain, the hunter managed to get up, haul himself across the room and grab the gun he had dropped at the beginning of the fight. He then shot every werewolf that started to hurl itself back at him, which made three more dead werewolves. The younger one had run out of the door.
It was five months later, when Sam burst into the kitchen with his laptop having his eyebrows knitted tightly together. They hadn’t had a long break, but Dean still managed to show the angels some of his favourite shows, for example Dr. Sexy, and right now he was showing him how to cook the perfect pasta between two hunts.
“I never heard yourself call Sam ‘tiny’, Dean,” Cas suddenly said in a way to straight voice, what made everyone in the room giggle.
As if Dean didn’t secretly wish for this to happen all his life, but he knew he could never have it, because of all the monster hunting and so on.
“I, err, settled Glynn into one of the spare bedrooms we had cleared for these occasions.” He stopped for a second, probably thinking about the fact, that none of them would ever have thought of a situation like this. At least Dean did. “Well, whatever, she was very exhausted and asked for us to wake her for dinner.”
The words rung in Dean’s ears as if somebody had whacked a Chinese gong right next to his ears. Cas wanted to leave. Cas had offered to do the same as Dean had but it seemed so much bigger in the hunter’s eyes. The angel had given enough for the Winchesters, having earned himself a special place in the family, but what was that worth if he wasn’t here to live it.
“He actually can,” the man who had handed over the briefcase spoke up, and Zack turned to him in an overly dramatic gesture. “If he has the medical records…” Cas opened his jacket and got out a stack of papers and handed them over with an unchanging expression. What the fuck was just happening.
“Yeah, I've just been to the werewolf hideout, which I came here for. But you know that I can handle myself, don't you?”
Dean almost spilled the beer he had tried to take a gulp out just now. Maybe, if he would have had less control over his facial features, he would have turned red, but he normally knew how to contain himself in front of his brother. Or he thought he did.
The older hunter had the suspicion, that Cas had only been speaking aloud because there were other people around since he had been able to communicate with their daughter when she had still been in the womb.
He reeled back and tried to put as much distance between the two of them as possible in the small hospital room. Pressed to the far wall, Cas stared wide-eyed at Dean.
“So, you are the famous, mysterious Castiel,” Jo said and added, much to Dean’s embarrassment: “Dean talks a lot about you. I’m sorry I couldn’t meet you earlier.” The blond-haired man knew about his wife’s bluntness but looked almost as shocked as Cas looked surprised.
"Remember that thing that was going down tonight in the old warehouse with the guys from Heaven's angels, where I said you didn't have to come? Well, you need to come here right now. I send you the locations." Dean heard the sound of a phone call ending and took a deep breath. Well, he had to go now, didn't he?
There was a little voice in the back of the hunters head telling him that his brother and their daughter were in the other room, but the way Cas grabbed the lapels of his leather jacket and basically crushed their chests together erased that thought fast. How he even could breathe when he felt the other’s soft hair under his hands was beyond him. The angel let out a quiet whimper at that and Dean had to break away.
The first one to answer was the pregnant woman. “Fine,” she laughed weakly and looked up at him as if they shared a joke. She seemed to have picked up a few perks of the Winchesters in the last months and it was funny in a kind of sad way.
“Three victims, all of them have partly missing organs, two men and one woman, age between twenty and forty,” he droned out the information. “The weird thing is: The bodies have not been opened before the obduction and the victims just died in their sleep or at dinner table. So, I assumed witch, because-”
“It’s from Hael,” Cas said after a suspenseful moment of his eyes flitting over the page. “She says she is sorry.” At the last words, his voice broke, but Dean still wasn’t sure if he should embrace him or not. Jo seemed to excuse herself to the kitchen after putting the twins in their shared crib, but neither man seemed to really have heard her.
The two hunters, the angel and the alien lady arrive at the bunker. Being concerned about the baby, they decide to see a doctor and make an ultrasound.
Still, there was this dread hanging over them, that Cas surely felt even if Dean tried to hide it from him, the ultimatum that was this evening, where the omega would either die or end his old life and start a new one. He didn’t even dare to hope for the latter, because if he did if he looked into the hopeful eyes of the other for one second too long, there was no coming back from the disappointment that was unavoidably to follow.
With the woman that was carrying the child, that had something from Dean as well as from Cas they had agreed to meet the next day again. Her roommate wasn’t coming back until very early in the morning and they still had to solve the case that drove them to this town. They also really wanted to talk it out with the younger Winchester, to make a plan what to tell the alien lady and what not to tell her.
She looked a bit irritated at the three men standing a little bit at the door, seeming to scan the room for possible dangers.
He looked firstly at Cas, who just shrugged and then, as realization drew to him, down at his daughter. She smiled. She was not even half an hour old and smiled up at Dean as if throwing demons through the air was not terrifying and dangerous, but fun.
"Well you hit your head pretty hard and had a concussion which resulted in twenty stitches around here," Sammy said and motioned something on his own head. The older brother groaned. That meant they had shaved the back of his head and he had to run around like an idiot for weeks.
“I’m not reading your mind, Dean.” Was there a hint of exhaustion in his voice? “You are just sometimes screaming your thoughts at me and then it is impossible to not not listen.” Screaming? Dean was not screaming! Not now, not ever.
“Their combined energies seem to be very strong,” Sam observed the obvious. “Do you think they have some kind of… aid?”
“Do you know what happens when you bite an infant?” the younger werewolf asked almost casually, and Dean lurched for his throat, caution thrown to the wind as usually. The knife connected with the younger werewolf’s skin the moment someone slammed into Dean from his right. How many of these stupid monsters were there?
“Can I help you?” Dean asked because there was no way the other could have recognised him since he had been disguised and always wore scent blockers-
"You didn't?" It was visible that it took a lot of effort for the alpha to lift his head and look into his mates eyes. Damn, they really were mates. Dean shook his head and tried something else: Can you hear this?
“Well, I think you're mother is a very understanding woman regarding the supernatural, so I think we should tell her the truth about Skylar.” Cas knit his brows together, half confused, half concentrated looking. “About us, I'm not familiar with her maybe outdated opinion on “same-sex” relationships and how much you are willing to risk her approval, but I would like to tell her. She has always been nice to me.” Dean didn't want to think about how he had made the air quotes at “same-sex” and not at “relationship” because he had seriously been expecting a gay panic all day long, but it didn't come.
“How… When…?” he tried to ask, but it seemed as if the softness, that had creeped into Cas eyes took him by surprise.
“I don’t know, Dean, I only checked on your viral functions every now and then until your brother called ten minutes ago,” Cas voiced, what made the older Winchester search for his phone. Seven missed calls from Sammy. Great.
With a sob, Dean got to his knees, grinned shortly at his brother who was covering up Glynn’s body and scooted over towards a bloody and completely wet angel.
"What do I smell like?" Dean asked quietly as the other didn't say anything for some time. They almost touched were Cas face was buried in the side of Dean's neck where his scent glands were located.
And then Dean couldn’t concentrate on it anymore, because Cas closed the door and now stood very close to him, lightly touching him, chest to chest on the side that wasn’t carrying Mia.
She seemed to be talking herself into a rage, and Dean had to admit he was afraid to stop her even if she was talking too loud and too fast. Staring at the barrel of a gun, no problem, but angry teenage girls? Scary as hell.
“Sorry Dean,” Cas said out loud and Sam lifted his eyebrows. Then Dean was suddenly in charge again.
“Sexual- sexual partners?” Dean asked, half choking and looking over to Cas who seemed a little bit pale.
With that Cas turned his face into the morning sun, probably enjoying its heat. It was a beautiful day, the older hunter had to admit, but it would be nothing without his family around him. Speaking of.
Dean hit the ground pretty hard again and tried to turn around as he heard a gravelly voice growling: “Nobody. Nobody calls my daughter an abomination.”
The alpha named Castiel caught up with him as soon as he left the shop and he had to admit that a tiny part of him would have been disappointed if he hadn't.
After he had told the driver the station he needed to get off, the man just shook his head and got back behind the wheel. He apparently thought Dean wouldn't have made it. He had to admit, that there was maybe a tiny hint of truth in that.
This is my family, Dean thought, as the urge to protect overcame him. He looked into the back mirror and saw Cas smiling slightly at him, as if to say: See, we can make it. But the hunter didn’t dare to believe him.
After he had stumbled towards Dean and opened the window, he reached out with his hand, probably to help the other man in but then stopped.
“Wow, I heard the back pain is a son of a bitch at that time,” Claire chimed in and Dean glared at her for the use of language, but was cut off his thoughts by Sam stepping in.
“Do you think it was an angel?” Sam asked Cas and it made sense to Dean. Why hadn’t he thought about that? The angel on their side nodded. “Could be possible, maybe they use humans now to travel in disguise from the Nephilim and us.”
Dean could hear Cas taking a deep breath, looking anywhere but in the taller man’s eyes. That was weird.
"I- need to go," Dean mumbled and turned around, just to remember that he still held the scrunched-up magazine. He took a short breath and walked over to the cash register to pay for it. Of course, he added some beef jerky and some mints; he didn't want to be viewed as a creep.
The kiss was only chaste, but after a few seconds, both men started to grin as if they had tasted the best thing in the world. “Okay,” Dean said as they leaned their foreheads together and then looked over at the present part of their weird family.
“All right, I will go out and check the wards,” the gravelly voice of the angel in the room piped up and the older Winchester wished he would stay and watch him cook food as he often had done in the last months.
She seemed frightened at first, like everybody, except for the Winchesters maybe, at the prospect of death. After that she told them, she accepted it and if it was like this, she at least died for a good purpose, knowing her child in protective and competent hands. The older hunter almost frowned at that.
“It’s Cas,” he told them stepping closer and turning the phone to speaker. The smile on the faces of most of his family made him understand, that they really accepted the dark-haired man as part of Dean and therefore part of the clan.
As his eyes averted to the darkness of his room, he saw a big cut in the raw cement of his wall, that continued over the ceiling and down the opposite wall. The protection sigils of the room were broken.
Without further words they agreed on Dean going around the house to climb over the fence, Sam to duck into the shadows of the bushes and for Cas to go up to the flat to protect the door.
"Wait, wait, wait, why would you need a deal with Crowley to get out? You don't owe him anything." Dean just looked at his ceiling for a second. "And, I mean, it's your decision, but don't you think Cas would tell you if he didn't want the whole mate thing since it's probably either in or out with true mates." Dean had no time to laugh at his brother's word choice.
Dean looked back over his shoulder at Cas and tried to see him through the eyes of his family, but he failed the moment these blue eyes flickered to him. There were crinkles forming around them as the dark-haired man smiled softly at him and Dean's heart began to stutter in his chest.
"Bedroom," he whispered against the other's lips, and since Cas didn't know where exactly that was, he took his hand and pulled him there while steadying himself on various furniture. When he saw his bed, he had nearly made before, he felt the nervousness rise again, but only until he heard his alpha gulp behind him. Right,
“Dean,” it was Jo an she sounded shaken and weirdly calm at the same time. “I got up to get a glass of water and well, you know, at first I thought I peed myself, but… erm, the water broke. I don’t know what you are doing right now, but you should probably come over again.”
Dean knew there wasn't a healthy way to avoid his next heat with Cas around, but they had already stocked up on birth control, and he would be a liar if he said he wasn't at least a bit excited.
“Dean,” he started and why did the hunter feel a little bit warmer at mention of his name by a certain gravelly voice? “I am sorry that I didn’t ‘drop by’ today, but you seemed to be occupied, so I didn’t want to disturb you.”
His mother cleared her throat. When Dean looked up so hastily, he was afraid to have strained something in his neck, she had an expectant look on her face.
They had nothing, Dean realized, as he was riding in the backseat of his favorite car, heading north.
“Eh, okay, Cas, I’m sorry, I have to go the babies are coming,” he stumbled, sporting a grin he found himself unable to remove from his face.
"What did you do then?" the voice at the other end asked and Dean really wanted to inform him, that it was still not the point.
They stopped at Dean’s favorite Burger Restaurant chain and Dean was happy to finally talk again after a drive in tickling silence. He asked Cas about his favorite food and what Mia liked to eat, at what the slightly smaller man only laughed and Mia brabbled something that sounded like ‘potatoes’ or something. They got a booth by the windows and the blond-haired waitress provided them with a highchair and menus.
He saw one chance for Sammy to get out and took it. The knife he had just dropped was lying next to his left foot, with which he kicked it forcefully. This got him a claw in his shoulder, but he could see Sam taking the knife, ramming it into the werewolf in front of him and running out of the door before the body had even dropped.
They found the werewolves first, a whole pack operating from a cabin in near the lakes, where the townsfolk had stopped going out of fear of being abducted. One of them even told them that they had tried to burn it down, but no one from that mission had returned.
“Cas, you don’t have to answer that,” Dean supplied fast after a moment of silence, even though he really wanted to know.
"You know that it's not that easy," the demon leader started after a few seconds of shock, having found his slimy bargaining voice again. "Even though you have proven yourself very useful in the past few years, you and I had a deal." Dean knew the deal by heart, but of course, the King of Hell had to repeat it. "For your father's debts, you were willing to put yourself into my services if your brother got out. And I have held onto my part. I haven't even thought of that moose in over five years."
“It’s quite an uncommon knowledge among the angels, but I once worked with a guy, who did a few researches about Nephilim,” he started and Dean knitted his brows together. What guy? “He discovered a very old report, similar to the one we found and investigated some time ago.”
Coming to his senses at the thought that this wasn’t one of his daydreams in the auto shop, he tried to reel back to apologize and to wave it off as a heated accident. But he didn’t get that far.
Upon arriving at the giant, abandoned building, Dean parked his car in a hidden side street, but not too far away for if they suddenly had to bail.
Dean frowned at that. He still hadn’t wrapped his mind around the fact, that he was going to have a kid, least of all, that it was going to be supernatural, Cas related or not.
"Where the hell have you been," the beta started, and then shook his head. "Nevermind, I don't care. The better question is, why I had three different people tell me separately that Dean Winchester presented his pretty little ass in the middle of an important heist."
“Agent, can I talk to you for a minute?” Dean asked between clenched teeth and Glynn frowned. Cas send half of a smile in her direction and followed his friend a few meters back into the ‘corridor’. Dean almost smiled at adding the mental quotation marks just for the angel.
“Are you finding, what you are looking for?” a dark, gravelly voice suddenly asked from behind him, and Dean could have sworn his heart had just stopped for a second, only to return to its work at double speed.
“Well, Dean, I haven’t heard you ramble like this since you were a teen and wanted me to know that you liked John Travolta more than Olivia Newton-John, so it must be serious.” Dean could clearly hear him grin through his voice. “why don’t you just do what you always do?”
After they had registered and had the first examination, they had to wait for the contractions to get closer and more powerful. While he tried to help his wife through the worst of the pain, Dean’s panicking mind found a new direction to pace in.
“How did… how did this happen so fast, I mean in, well, movies and series and stuff births normally go on for hours,” the older hunter rambled.
“Love me like you love your brother.” It was not a question, just a statement, probably not even meant to be heard.
Maybe he shouldn’t think of people like this, but he had seen so many stupid and mean people that he thought of himself as average. Even if he was working for a man, who called himself the King of Hell, robbing fuel stations for him. At least he had never killed anybody.
Apparently, Cas had taken them to the bunker, and they had laid Dean down on the war room table. And apparently, they had discussed for two minutes, until they had decided, that they couldn’t save the older Winchester directly this time and needed more time to do it.
Feeling the familiar adrenaline mixed with jolts of panic sweep through his system, Dean was at the door in no time and ran into his similar shaken little brother when he opened it.
“The Winchesters they are still-“ It was quiet for a second. Then Sam came to his feet and mimed Dean to get back from the door just about in time for a woman in a grey suit and a pale blue shirt to rip it open. “Speak of the devil,” she said and grinned.
Dean could feel a smile growing on his face, despite the previous, serious conversation. This sounded exactly like a date. He never, ever wanted to mention something like this, but his mouth was faster: “Nice, only you and me alone, going for lunch.” Sometimes, Dean thought, sometimes he deserved to be punished for his reckless talking.
"I- I know." Dean suddenly felt stupid with the magazine still in his hands and his high-school-dropout knowledge.
"What guy?" Sammy asked and he had this suspicious look on his face he got when they talked about Dean's shady work. It was silent for a second as Dean looked around the loft-like flat with its bare walls.
"I- told him I needed time to think. And then I went home to talk to my brother, who I thought could help me with this, but apparently, he can't." He knew he was being unfair, but he felt himself starting to panic a little.
Suddenly surprisingly strong hands grasped into the collar of the leather jacket he had hastily thrown over his pajamas and dragged him closer again.
Eight months into their pregnancy, Dean couldn’t await the day he would meet his babies any longer. He felt bad for Jo, who had all the pain and uncomfortableness of carrying them around and tried to help her as much as he could. They knew it would be so much more work from the moment they were finally parents, but it was a time they wanted to reach badly.
The older hunter managed to shoot two bullets before one of the heart eaters was onto him, and he had to drop his gun to hit them in the face. Only when the werewolf lifted their head, Dean noticed that it was evidently a woman but what did that matter anyway now. She dug her claws in his shoulders as smashed him into the nightstand his phone had been on.
The momentum of his hurried walk made him almost faceplant into a head of dark, messy bed hair. Drawing in a sharp breath while finding stability in clutching to the other's sleeve with his unoccupied hand, Dean knew before the man turned who he had run into.
Their perfect family. It was not like in the movies or commercials: Two parents, two and a half children, bound together by blood.
"That means if that were true, you would have been the reason for this awful, long heat," Dean said as realisation swapped over him like a big wave, and he regretted saying the words out loud, the moment he was finished speaking. Damn him, and his first act then think scheme.
He couldn't see the face of the child nor could he make out where they were, but there was this all prominent feeling of completeness surrounding them, that Dean had never felt in his real life before.
"Yes, just you, my true mate, I plan to spend the rest of my life with," he stated, just like that and Dean felt pure euphoria mix with dread in his stomach. The other couldn't really mean that, could he?
“She seems to have a good survival instinct,” Cas voiced quietly from Dean’s other side and when the hunter turned he noticed the others smile and lost himself without noticing in sky blue eyes. Damn being a dad already made him soft and the baby was not even born yet.
Their lips met for a second time and Dean could feel warmness explode in his chest at the taste and smell of Cas face that was suddenly closer than it had ever been. Between kissing those soft lips, he drunk in the air around his counterpart greedily not wanting to ever forget any second of this moment ever.
“Well, I’m bored.” He laughed. Probably this would help him forget his own stupid problems. “And it’s not your fault, that the first guy you ask is more a five than a four.”
Then it hit him. He had just been thinking about how they would sell this car because Dean still had his Impala, that wasn’t perfect for the kids but was otherwise just awesome. How had he come to think of a future with this guy he met yesterday?
“So, my family is friends with this other family since… ever, or something and they always sit together in church and stuff. Therefore, naturally, their oldest son married my only sister when I was only eleven years old, what merged our families officially.”
“No sacrifices,” Dean interrupted him. “We already lost Sky’s mother tonight, we don’t need to lose anybody else.” The girl wrapped up in the hunters jacked seemed to look up at her new nickname, her expression pleased.
“Sad?” a tiny voice in his arms asked, accompanied by a small hand on his face. He smiled down at Cas daughter and said: “Yeah, I’m fine.” I’m just worried about your parents. And guilty for thinking of your mom as a problem, even if only for a few seconds.
So, asking Jo, Sam and Jess, if it was okay, that he brought another neighbor to their weekly gatherings/sport-on-TV-watching sessions on Saturdays was only the first step in his plan. Normally, Charlie would come as well, but she caught a bad virus and lay at home in her bed.
Dean didn’t know, what Cas heard of that, because the angel didn’t utter a word for the whole drive, but the Winchester was nonetheless very relieved, when they arrived in the small city.
“Yeah, well, I spoke to the victim and guess where Kate Mitchell found him,” His brother asked but it was clearly rhetorical. “He was laying in front of her flat.”
“She is beautiful,” Dean told Jo, who was preparing herself to be torn apart for a second time. He slowly lowered her tiny body wrapped in blankets down to his wife’s eye level, who smiled sleepily at her slowly calming down daughter. Then her face was split in pain again, and Dean hurried to his feet to watch the birth of his second kid.
As the older Winchester with the help of his brother tried to rub the blood and other dried fluids of her though, he didn’t seem able to work fast enough, due to the fact, that she was so tiny and fragile and he didn’t want to break her. They still managed to get most of the dirt off her and as soon as she was dry, Dean wrapped her in a diaper with the help of his brother like a pro.
Dean promised to be back at the high school when Cas was finished and drove off fast after that. He didn’t want to get into the turmoil, that high school students usually caused.
Benny stopped as requested, and Dean stumbled out of the car, even if it got him weird looks from his teammates.
“Here you go,” Glynn said at setting two cups in front of the hunters. No wait, Cas was… ah, whatever. “Any progress?” The content of the tea cups smelled weird, but they took it anyways; Cas even nipped on his.
“If you don’t give her willingly,” the voice whispered because of course, you could hear magical-in-head sounds, no matter what noise there was else, “We will have to come and get her.”
In the end, he left his hand where it was, after a while even turned it around to intervene their fingers and looked over to the other with the hint of a smile on his face. Cas looked back with blazing bright blue eyes and Dean lost himself in them until his brother cleared his throat loudly.
Their first time was very strange. They had talked about alternative fertilization methods but decided it would be easier to just have sex. And Dean had been having sex with women before, not many but there actually had been a time before college, where he had thought he was straight. He always thought that the strict, military education by his father had made him want to be as expected, but he realized he simply wasn’t.
“Well, it was weird, I knew something was not like in the romantic Hollywood movies, but I didn’t have anything to compare it to.”
The house was absolutely perfect, and they bought it right away, with a little help from Sam and the bank. Jo got a new job as a secretary because she didn’t want to just sit around until the date of birth and Dean found himself an opportunity to be more than an overqualified mechanic.
A cold, unpleasant shudder ran down Dean's back at those words, and he could recognize, that Cas looked just as mortified. Dean shouldn't have made him mate him, he shouldn't have...
“Dean, I can already hear you panic over the phone,” Sam said with his bitchface voice. “Relax, I saw how he looks at you. He likes you.”
Cas had a distant smile playing around his lips and a look of proudness on his face as if being given such an important and human task was something immensely honorable. Oh, how Dean loved this stupid, clumsy, kind of naive guy.
The backyard they entered through a big glass door, was almost bigger than Dean's entire flat and had an unmowed lawn, framed by a wide variety of flowers. There was a bench on the terrace to their right on which they seated themselves, and Dean couldn't stop feeling like a child who had done something wrong.
"Dean, oh. Hello Dean," Cas stammered as if he hadn't expected for the other to call. He had his rights, Dean thought since it had already been five days. "Are you alright, Dean?"
Dean felt the tears sting in his eyes but cleared his throat to get rid of them. He could mourn when he was alone in his bedroom, but for now he had to be the strong one. He looked up at Glynn from where he had been fidgeting with the knife. Or maybe she was the strong one.
Castiel nodded. “I work at a high school, four miles from here,” he said and Dean had twenty new questions immediately. “I would ride the bike, but I have to get Mia to her childminder beforehand.”
His brother seemed to want to say something, but the older Winchester already turned around and headed off. He hoped the others knew which life was to protect over all of theirs, even if they wouldn’t protect their own.
“Do you remember which state Mom was in the last time she called?” Dean said and sensed the usual emotions wash over him, he felt when he was thinking about Mary. He had forgiven her, yes. But that didn’t mean she had gotten back to being that unreachable, idealistic image of a mother she had been before she came back.
“All right, we need to lay these two stones on his eyes and… just recite these four liners to reverse the preservation spell.” Shit, we are witches ourselves, Dean thought. How did we end up here.
As they arrived in Montrose, Colorado, the second time, they firstly checked into the Black Canyon motel. The owner didn’t seem to remember them and Dean liked the feeling of a little consistence in his life.
“We got engaged when we were only twenty and married at the age of 23. The wedding night was a catastrophe. I couldn’t do it.” Cas was actually blinking tears away.
They sat down, ordered and Cas started to fiddle with his fingers. At that sight, Dean felt his heart sink and all he wanted at this moment was to comfort the other man. But he also wanted to hear the story so he sat back and waited, trying not to pressure Cas.
Finally, they reached her flatmate. “Glynn, ah yes, she was here only ten minutes ago. Why, is she in trouble?” a very chirpy girl asked over the phone.
Dean nodded, turned around and tried to walk straight back to his house. Had Cas done this on purpose? Was he somehow flirting with Dean?
“Hey, buddy,” the older hunter said and smiled a little. On the one hand, because he wanted to hide his facial expressions, showing off his earlier thoughts, on the other hand, because he really,
Before he could answer, he felt an energy flow through him, similar to the one he sensed when he was healed by an angel. In an instant he stopped shivering and felt as if he was on a sunny summer day outside the bunker. Dean let out a breathless laugh.
“Of course, you can stay,” Dean murmured in the others slightly curly hair. “You are always welcome here, no matter what Cas, you hear me?” He leaned back to make sure, that Cas nodded and saw Mia looking up at him with watery eyes. Damn her puppy eyes were almost as good as Sammy’s.
Her laugh sounded a bit bitter with the tears in her eyes, and Dean’s sympathy for her grew immensely. Siblings love was never easy, especially when parents came between them.
“One of the watchers?” Dean asked out loud. “Is this in the bible?” The hunter could as well see is brother shake his head as he could feel his angel do the same. The angel.
That was the moment they both heard the cracking of the ceiling and, in a simultaneous manner lifted their gazes to the origin of the sound. Large cracks wove their paths through the cement and Dean could feel rather than see, that some of the stone was already trickling down on them like dust.
The moment Dean saw his little brother, he hugged him hart, thanking him over and over for the role he had played in convincing him. Not that he would ever admit that to anybody else.
"You- you want to mate?" Of course, he was confused, considering that Dean hadn't shown any interest in a relationship with him until yesterday. He also noticed how Cas started to turn a little pink around the nose as if he was embarrassed and Dean needed a second to realise the reason. Mating included sex. At least one thing the omega understood.
