I think I did really well.  I was nervous and botched the first few sets of moves, but after that, after I brushed off the initial jitters of being watched and judged, I showed those people I’m not someone to be messed with.  I’m pleased with what I did down there.
The second my foot hits the ground outside the train, the ground that belongs to District 9, the crushing weight lifts from my shoulders.  It’s like I can breathe properly again for the first time in days.  It’s like I can breathe freely.  I take in the air, the hot but blissfully fresh and clean air, and my lungs stop burning.  In the distance, I hear birds.  Real birds.  Natural birds that live here, untouched by humanity, not manufactured by Gamemakers.  Their carefree singing is so charming that for a moment, I have to close my eyes, relish the sound of their songs, feel the warm breeze on my skin, let all of the wonderful sensations of home really begin to sink in.
Well, Cas was taking it easy, and Dean was only portraying that exterior. Inside Dean’s mind was a cluster of anxiety and one single thing he wanted to talk to Cas about, something that came to him during their walk the previous day. He wanted to hear Cas’ thoughts on the matter, his opinions, but for some reason he was so afraid of bringing it up that he couldn’t get himself to speak. Instead he just gazed at Cas, watching with reverence and admiration as Cas closed his eyes and soaked up the sunlight, until he eventually worked up the courage to open his mouth.
Dean started to smile at the simple but lovely little train of thought, but an unexpected yawn interrupted him. Seven in the morning was still far too early for him, but Cas was miserable, and of course Dean wanted to help him in any way he could, regardless of the ungodly hour. “Just stay put. I’ll be right back,” he said through the end of his yawn, shuffling toward the door in his ridiculous bunny slippers.
“Man, I feel like it’s been forever since I’ve seen you!”  Cresh chuckles.  He’s coming back, tossing the fallen containers aside to reach me.  I don’t have time to think.  I grab one with shaking hands and hurl it at his chest, try to scramble away before he can get me and hurt me and kill me like he’s wanted to since the beginning.
There was a brief pause in the conversation as Sam glanced down at the corner of his laptop screen to check the time. “Almost ten,” he replied a moment later, pushing his chair back ever so slightly so he could turn to look at Dean. “Rough night? You still look tired.”
Dean glances over his shoulder to where Cas is watching him with eyes that catch the light of the lantern hanging from the peg above Sam’s head. “It’s alright, Sam. There’s no need to rush.”
cleaning up this mess alone. I may let it slide at home, but not here. You get the hack saw and I’ll get the garbage bags.”
There are creeping vines and all sorts of long, stringy plants hanging from the ceiling, along with about half a million potted plants lining the walls and shelves. At this point, Cas might as well be living outdoors. Hell, the house is basically over run by plants both inside
Dean frowns and squeezes the steering wheel. “I
, I never would have tried to save you. I normally don’t when someone is that close to death. You were almost too far gone for the change. I was planning on giving you a merciful ending, quick and painless.”
He nods and shifts on his claws, forcing his tail not to twitch wildly behind him and give away his nerves. “I –” He clears his throat. “I wanted to talk to you.”
Should he find it worrying that they’re not even a half hour into the movie and Dean is already asleep? Castiel had picked this movie not because he wanted to see it, but because he knew Dean would enjoy it and it seemed like a good idea for their first official date. Of course, Castiel had
.” He groans loudly and Dean can hear something bang about on the other end of the line. “Where do we keep the brain bleach? I need the whole bottle.”
“You spoke the truth.”
“Yeah, Sam and Jess are waiting upstairs to meet you.” Dean explains with a shrug. “They made supper.”
“Enough!” The dragon hisses, stomping its paws and digging its claws into the hard dirt of the tunnel floor. Before Dean can say otherwise, the light from the glowing design covering the dragon intensifies.
The cave is set in the rock face at the valley’s end, exactly where the mayor said it would be. Dean dismounts and leaves his horse tied to a tree well back from the cave. When on the road, she is his only companion. He won’t risk her being hurt. If any dangers comes to her, she knows that if she pulls hard enough, the knot in her reins will come undone and she’ll be able to flee.
For the first time in his life, Dean is actually grateful for the louder-than-necessary previews. If Sam or Charlie had heard that, they’d never let him live it down. He knows he’s blushing. He can feel it burn across his cheeks and into his ears and everything. Cas probably can’t see it, but Dean squeezes his hand and leans into Cas’s side. He’ll show Cas just how much that means to him later when they’re working on their ‘project’.
She nods and disappears only to come back a few minutes later. “That’s the only time I can find record of him sending a message to it. Do you want me to track it?”
This, at least, seems to catch their attention. Cas nods and gestures towards the cave. The children laugh and run ahead while Cas walks sedately with Dean. This time he gets to see the cavern where they live. A stream of cool water cuts through one side of it and tents of rough cloth are strung between poles of stone, shading beds of hay wrapped in thin blankets from the orbs of light, almost as bright as the sun, that are nestled between the stalactites above their heads.
Fuck. Fucking
Cas’s knowledge was severely lacking in other areas.
“You’re a hunter.” Cas tilts his head and raises an eyebrow. “You know what I am. You hunted my kind to the brink of extinction.” He leans in closer and smiles, his own fangs descending over his teeth. “Go ahead, Dean Winchester. Tell me what we are.”
When he’s done, Cas stands up as cool and collected as always and knocks on the door again. Dean bangs his knee on the side table getting up and he tries hard not to act like it’s stinging like a bitch when he answers the door. Just like before, Cas holds the journal out to him.
Dean’s favourite parts of those days are the games. He misses his nieces and nephews and these orphans are a good substitute. Their laughter is just as infectious and Dean goes to sleep each night in Cas’s offered bed exhausted from their endless energy. Cas never joins him, but he is always there with his bright, ageless eyes when Dean wakes.
“What do we have to lose?” Sam asks, crunching a bone between his teeth so he can suck at the marrow. “Do you really think he’s just going to eat us?”
As they finally turn towards home, Castiel doesn’t like the bitter taste of worry twisting on the back of his tongue. There is doubt about the safety of his clan. It sits at the back of his mind, overshadowed by the untrustworthy eyes of the young king’s chief counsellor. He had seemed far too eager for Castiel and his team to leave the keep.
Dean accepts the bag and pours a few of the coins into his hand. They’re lucky that his fee has never been high. All he needs is enough to cover his room and board until the hunt is complete, but everyone always pay more than he asks. For Dean, hunting dragons is about the thrill and the good of the people. The profit he makes from it is purely a bonus. This particular job, however, leaves a sour taste in his mouth and it has yet to begin.

“Yeah, that guy!”
He can satisfy his frustrations with exploring the island and flying to the mainland to investigate the edges of the mountains. Dean is stuck here, hiding in the mud hut and being forced to watch males and females alike come to proposition Cas. Every time someone knocks on the edge of the hut, Dean's stomach twists and he feels like he's going to throw up. He has to bite down on his tongue to keep from speaking out during moments like these.
“Ass.” Dean hisses under his breath when he's certain he won't be heard.
Dean bares his fangs in a hiss, his pride stinging, and Cas crouches to be at his level. “I don’t mean it as an insult. It’s merely a fact, Dean. You’ve done well to survive on your own, but if you come with me, you’ll be able to do more than just that.” His eyes are almost shining in the dark. “You’ll be able to
When they’re finally both spent, Cas trembling finely under him and his hips still twitching, Dean gathers him to his chest. He kicks his boots off and fits himself to Cas’s back, spreading his hands over his stomach again. Cas tugs one of the sheets up to cover them before he finally relaxes, a soft, happy sigh tickling over the arm Dean has under his head.
know. But there’s something about the fact that Cas is in love with someone and has never told him that’s digging into the back of his brain. It’s like an itch that Dean can’t scratch physically, but maybe if he just saw a
With how his emotions just got twisted around right now, Dean can maybe be forgiven for his pouting and how he turns away from Cas. “I’m mad at you. I don’t think I want to kiss you anymore.”
Yup. His voice is even better without speaker static. Dean swallows and his face is starting to hurt from how hard he's smiling. “Hey, Cas. Was it a – did you have a good flight?”
Dean stands to the side of the concession counter trying for an air of indifference when really he’s nervously twisting his bracelet around his wrist. It took him

“Actually, we prefer to be called
There’s always a different feeling to a room when Dean is in it - different from the feeling of another presence. It disappears now and Castiel glances over to his shoulder to confirm that Dean has left. He settles back into the bed and stares at the wall, his mind to alive with thought for him to sleep just yet.
“He didn’t do anything!” Sam’s voice rings out behind him.
nest! Go away!”
this good before and something a lot like dread is starting to creep into his chest.
they’re in a coma.
“So…” Cas clears his throat and Dean looks up from trying to fish the keys out of his pocket. “This is Baby?” He gestures at the freshly washed Impala – cleaned up nice, just for Cas. “She looks better in person.”

He can feel a blush heat his cheeks and it’s all he can do not to duck his head to try and hide it. “Does that mean you’ll help me to help the dragons?”
“Goddammit, Sam.” He groans. “Can we
He swallows his fears and waits until all the children are asleep before he sneaks from their tents to Cas’s private cave. Before he can even announce his presence, Cas’s voice calls out to him. “Come in, Dean.”
He gets only a few feet from the mouth of the mud hut when another Dragon intercepts him. She stands almost head and shoulders above Castiel, her skin darker than anything Dean has ever seen before. He doesn't even know what breed of Dragon she is.
did you turn me?”
Gargoyle is crouched and gripping the stone between its feet. Instead of snarling and showing a mouthful of sharp teeth, this one is staring out toward the city, almost like its watching over everything.
“You want to try something to help, Cas?”
By the time they have him fully undressed, Cas’s erection has unsheathed and Dean has tried very hard not to be awed by the differences between them in both size and shape. He chooses instead to occupy his thoughts with Cas’s mouth, kissing him down into the sheets. Cas’s claws press in at his hip, the strength in his hands guiding Dean to move against him in a slow and gratifying roll of their bodies. His tail lays between their legs and Dean straddles it, Cas’s legs falling open on either side of him.
To be completely honest, Dean is fairly certain his current situation can be blamed on his brother. After this curse, Sam never should have left him. It’s all well and good that he went to go find a
Cas gives him an odd look and the light flashes in his eyes again. “I can see more than just your physical form, Dean. Every creature has a soul light. Some shine brighter than others and the brighter the soul, the greater the good within the person.” His tail curls behind him as he smiles. “And you are very bright.”
“I’m not paying this!” The man exclaims, shoving his way out of the booth. His face is bright red and Castiel steps back, frowning in confusion as the man gestures wildly and speaks loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear. “The food was disgusting and the service was terrible! I’m not giving you a cent and I’m
The answer is waiting for him the moment he walks through the door. One of the technical analysts, a bright young woman with red hair (Castiel is almost positive that her first name is

Dean is most definitely in love with Cas.
This feels different than before. This is something Dean
A lump rises in Castiel’s throat and he swallows around it, panic starting to balloon behind his ribs. Dean isn’t supposed to

Cas squeezes back and hums again. “Thank you, Dean.”
Tonight, with the laptop balanced on his knees in the bathroom, Castiel looks up the dine-and-dasher from this afternoon. And the facts were these…
The warrant is easy enough to obtain for Mr. Keltainen’s company files. Dean doesn’t float off very far while Castiel stays lon enough to open the system for the technical division to access it remotely. He doesn’t need to be here for the rest of it, having only driven over with a few others who will be doing interviews. His job is to return to the station and wait for a data report.
“Ah,” Ellie says, relaxing. Her hands move again. “How old is she?”
“For your well-being, I suggest amputation of the arm and partial amputation of the shoulder joint. After that, Mrs. Bradbury has said she feels like she can make you something better, Mr. Novak.” He speaks haltingly, seemingly too aware of the combined 500 pounds of muscle in this room.
Cas wins by about fifty points, which Dean doesn’t really mind. Cas finally seems lighter, just a little bit, so he fights against the part of him that wants to be a sore loser. It’s not easy.
“Once you’re finished, uh, that, would you want to see Jack Nicholson do his thing?” He gestures to the book. Cas looks confused. “We could watch it in the Dean Cave, pop a little popcorn.”
), is waiting for him at the door with a sheaf of papers.
There is no one else that Dean would trust to command their crew in his stead. He watches Sam march off across the decks before he runs a hand over his chest to smooth out the wrinkles in his shirt. Dean adjusts the belt hanging on his hips before he ducks inside. He hangs the key on a hook next to the door after turning the lock and laying a plank across the doors as an extra precaution – just in case. It’s been a long time – too long – since he’s had his fun. The last thing he wants now is to be interrupted.
It was silly to get his hopes up like that. The moment they land on the island, a gentle mist settling across it thanks to the waterfall far above them, the Dragons stop and stare. Dean can't hear their whispers, but he can feel the burn of their eyes as they pass over his arms and their thin, deformed membrane.
“How do you know for sure if you don’t try?”
Dean frowns down at the book and tries really hard to ignore the way his stomach is sinking right now. “Seriously?
“It's not a no.” Cas leans back in the bed again, stretching his legs out.
The flap over the mail slot creaks behind him and Cas’s voice comes through, only muffled by the flap on the inside and under Dean’s back. “Before you reach the point where you’re too embarrassed to ever talkme again, I would just like to say that there
“North tower. They’re fucking
“Get back to the cavern!” The dragon hisses, gesturing sharply with one hand.
Getting on that plane and flying across the country was quite possibly the most nerve-wracking thing Castiel has ever done. Even more so than when he realized he was falling for his online friend and confessed his feelings. That had been a harrowing day and required practically every ounce of his courage to send the message he’d been writing and building on for
Dean wonders who the author is and flips to the first page again, before the writing even starts. The only thing there is a; “If found, please return to…” box with Cas’s name written in it. Dean’s heart just about stops when he reads over Cas’s name a half dozen times or more, written in the same neat script as the rest of the book he’s been reading.
“Yes, but remember, we’re only doing this because he deserves it.” That is his code and they must stick to it.
Dean knows what he’s supposed to do. He’s supposed to close the book, put it back on the shelf and completely forget about it. At no point is he ever going to mention it and Cas can
“Iron Man, duh.” She shrugs and grins at him. “You’re wound tighter than C3PO’s golden ass. You need to chill the hell out before Cas gets here.”
job to be teaching Sam how to fly since their parents are gone. But he can't and it's not fair.
There has been no request for money and it’s been almost more than a week and that’s highly irregular. In fact, Castiel thinks that’s
weird. This might be about more than just money. He resolves to get started with looking into John’s business dealings in the morning. Maybe Dean can help him out with that too.
As they drive home afterwards, Dean gives Castiel a curious, almost excited, look. “So, is it a go? Are we gonna get this guy?”
“We don’t charge family.” Castiel picks up Sam’s hat and hands it to him. “Stay safe. We’ll see you tonight.”
“No, Sam, I'm serious. What if he doesn't like me in person?” Dean runs a hand through his hair and turns around at the wall to pace away from the baggage carousels. “What if I breathe too loudly or I fart too much or –
Taking a deep breath, Dean holds out his hand. “You just saved my life. The least I can do is tell you my name. It’s Dean, by the way. Dean Winchester. And this is my brother, Sam. We’re cops.”
Right before his eyes, as Sam crouches to tie the laces on his shoes, Dean’s form disintegrates into the dust motes in the sunlight through the window. Castiel can feel the sting of tears behind his eyes and it’s getting hard to breathe. Dean just - but he
After a brief chat with the building manager, Dean is not at all happy to hear that it could take anywhere between thirty and sixty minutes for a repairman to be dispatched to get them out. At this point, a fire crew would be better and Dean contemplates calling Sam at the library to get him to call in a tip or something because this isn't going to be fun.

But it’s eleven before he has to use one. Maybe he’s supposed to comfort himself that she wasn’t human, but she looked it, long mouse-colored hair and mud-colored eyes. Nothing special to look at until he pulls the trigger. The bullet hits home and she goes the floor.

Dean pulls himself to his feet. He knew this had to happen eventually. He thought he had prepared himself for it, so he doesn’t understand why he feels like he might cry.
“Oh?”
“Is this seat taken?”
Cas looks at him, and then away. “I’m transsecondary.”

“It’s not you,” Cas says. He smiles wryly. “It’s me.”
They spend awhile wandering downtown, walking through the state Capitol grounds, peeking in to little shops and picking up a couple of souvenirs. Dean buys a few shot glasses for his collection and Cas keeps smiling at the art he found of the bat colony that lives under the main street bridge. Dean teases him about it but doesn’t mean it.
“I know that I’ve been very privileged.”
and i was finally in on the joke.
Dean almost goes to his knees. He would’ve if Cas asked, right in the produce section. But Cas only told him to wait, so he does.
And my share of time has been nothing

and the waiter is giving Dean a look. The dom mark on his eye is big, the kind certain types of doms brag about, and without turning off his customer service persona, it seems like he’s sneering.
Dean has been in Cas’s house alone plenty of times. Cas’s little boneheaded kitten even scampers up to say hello, but it doesn’t feel like almost-home the way it usually does. Dean realizes he’s taking careful, quiet steps across the living room without knowing why. He rolls his eyes at himself and walks normally down the hall to Cas’s bedroom.
“Cool?” Dean says.
“Sounds like another young person we know,” Cas says. Dean catches his gaze for a second, then nods, exhaling steadily.
The second all three of them left the building for the last time there’s a “beep” of their SHIELD buzzers deactivating. Sam and Dean yell in happiness, and Dean slings a casual arm around Cas’ shoulder and swings him around. He is careful of the stitches, but he lets the arm sit there until they get to Dean’s new civilian car.
“You never know. Hell, I’ve forgotten worse. What were you saying, Cas?”
“Near Grafton,” Cas says. “It’s just a little park in the backyard of a restaurant. I’ve heard good things.”
“If you got nothin’ else to do,” he says, scratching the back of his hand. “I wouldn’t say no to some help.”
They never thought Captain America would need a thing like their asset. Therefore, their asset stopped fighting, mouth slack and gaping. Dean Winchester, the start and the end of it all. Naomi would’ve been furious.
he thinks, watching Cas sit perfectly still next to him. He turns his eyes back to the road.
“Will you joining us for scampi tonight?” Dean says after a pause. Castiel wants to say yes with every mutated and broken molecule in this body. He wants to sit at the table and stare at Dean when he’s eating ice cream, and he wants to laugh with Jack, and he wants to talk to Sam like everything is normal and not on the precipice of disaster.
“Awesome. Ten dollars square,” Ellie says, and Cas hands her a twenty. She rings it up, humming under her breath to the tinny noise of the radio. Cas looks out the window, to where Jack is in line at the corn dog place across the mini-mall. Jack sees him look and waves a corn dog at him, smiling.
Dean picked that moment to walk over with two free overflowing-with-butter bags of popcorn and a bag of Swedish Berries. Charmingly, his mouth was already filled with a combination of the two.
Dean takes a peek at his watch as he shakes out his numb leg. It’s just past midnight. They’ll get home around 1-ish. The world is spinning a little bit and he shakes his head to clear the fuzzies. He doesn’t know if he’ll even be able to sleep tonight. He remembers telling Jack that sometimes you get so sleepy that you’re not even tired. You want something so bad and you can’t even let yourself have it.
“I saw a movie,” Cas says, looking uncomfortable at the prospect. “Focused around the subject. I feel like it would be an enriching experience.”
He’s been looking at Cas like he’s starving for the last thirteen years. He knows this. There’s a giant, invisible animal that waits between them, and Dean is afraid to move because it might rip his throat out. Dean is a friggin’ scarecrow held together with duct tape and bad whiskey. If Cas knew—
“I wonder,” Cas says as he reaches for Dean’s collar to adjust it. It doesn’t need adjusting, but he is sentimental. “I hear Sam is quite the bad influence.”
They stand in silence.
Cas still hasn’t moved.
Castiel’s metal fist tightens when something slams into his door. “I don’t know, Dean,” he bites out. The SWAT agents are at the front door, waiting for some signal. Castiel will not give it to them willingly.
Castiel shrugs. He rather not say that he can hear every person’s heartbeat for a quarter mile. Dean might have some strange issue with that knowledge.
“Like,” Dean casts around for something not-insane. “Like dinner. You still want fried chicken?”
, Castiel thinks. The last tracking chip drops into the water with a plink, and he watches as it sinks to the bottom of the bath, light still on and flashing irregularly. Through the hazy bathwater, it looks like a searchlight.
Cas let go of everything at once.
Blood drips into the murky water below him as Castiel works the tracking chip off the grey bone of his rib. He wrenches it off and presses hard against the incision as the chip hits the bottom of the tub with a
“No, you wouldn’t, because you’re a good guy. I just don’t want you to ever regret it,” Dean says, putting his hands on Cas’ face and wiping Cas’ tears away with his thumbs.
Would Chuck even let him give up like that, write himself out of the story? Dean thunks his head back against the headrest. Probably not. He’d probably raze his fields and dry out the rivers and send locusts to eat all the rest. It is Chuck after all.
The sweats and delirium start to set in after he leaves the library. Full bodied types of sweats and shakes, like he got sick from one of the kids at the shop back in the day. In those days, Dean would bury him in blankets and complain at the stove, stirring whatever they had left into a watery soup and holding him hostage until he would try a few hesitant sips.
“Ready,” Cas says gently, and the answering smile could power Cas through a hundred more years of solitude. He gets in gingerly, to not bump the stitches. Dean gets into the front and revs the Impala’s engine several times before peeling out of the parking lot.
“Oh,” Dean averts his eyes, slapping his hands together. “My turn. Got it.”
“Romantically, doofus. I’m in love with you.” Dean says, as soft as he can make it. He thinks he can hear as the elephant finally walks away to torture some other innocent souls.
He stumbles to the bathroom. He hastily strips himself of all his clothes and piles them onto the bathroom counter, steps into the tub and briefly blasts himself with cold water from an unused showerhead. He grimaces as murky water circles the drain, but all he needs to be is mostly clean before - before doing this.
“I apologize,” Cas started, and Dean grabbed his arm before he finished.
“Figures,” Dean says. “Beautiful lake like that, course it’d find a way to kill your ass.”
“Jesus, Cas. I knew you meant it romantically,” Dean says, wanting to put his hands on his face. “I’ve been too chicken to say anything about it.”
Castiel pauses. His brain is still going a little haywire. “Dean?”
“I’m fine. Thank you,” Cas hums. He pauses, and leans in a little bit, like it’s a secret. “Jack showed me how to make instant ramen last night.”
“Exceedingly,” Cas says. There’s a beat as they look at one another. He squints, trying to decipher her amused expression. “What?”
Dean is in the kitchen, trying with all his might to force a rubber spatula through a thick mass of frozen cream cheese. Their dessert for tonight is cheesecake brownies, which Sam immediately proclaimed as “disgusting” and Jack had christened as “awesome.” Cas had deemed himself neutral and had selflessly volunteered to help Dean make them after Dean raised his eyebrows and sighed pointedly.
And during the surgery, Dean is parked on a stool next to him, humming in his ear the whole time because Cas’ body metabolizes anesthetic like crazy and he needs a distraction. He hums Yankee Doodle Dandy and Amazing Grace and Elvis. His broad shoulders block out the light of the surgery room and the bustle of the doctors, shrinking the operating room to just the two of them. Dean has a gift for that.
There’s a snap of a twig behind the pair of them. When Castiel peels open his eyes, the fawn-colored bunny winks one of its intelligent eyes at him. Castiel places his chin onto Dean’s shoulder and nods back. And then it is gone.
On Cas’ part, he had always loved Dean Winchester. He was never going to say it until he did. Then he died.
As soon as they’re free, Dean grabs Cas’ face like he wanted, right between his palms, and kisses him.
After everything’s been torn and sewn and cauterized 一 after all the fighting, and the disappearing, and Cas getting all of his trigger words dragged out of his skull one by one一 all of them retire officially.
“Alright,” Cas says. There’s only silence in the kitchen as the bunker’s old oven pops and shakes as it warms up.
“Half off of what?” Cas says, squinting.
“To the end-,” Dean had sputtered. His teeth are red, red, red. “To the end of it all, Cas. Past that.”
Dean sputters for a second, carefully placing his goods on the table and crossing his arms tight across his chest.  “No, I’m not.”
So he doesn’t. And he grabs for the bowl and smiles routinely when Cas pulls it away. And when he presses his face into Cas’ shoulder, Cas lets him, the rhythmic sound of stirring the only sound in the room.
Once a strategist, always a strategist. His captain would have been proud, if unsurprised.
Cas’ shoulders stiffen. Then slowly, slowly, he relaxes and turns to look at him, considering.
Dean’s eyes want to roll back in his head. Jesus
“Castiel Novak, I presume?” Crowley looks up with a trace of humour in his eyes as he writes something down. Cas squints at him. Who else would it be?
“I would enjoy that, Dean,” Cas says, smiling. He shifts his shoulders, and discomfort flashing across his face for a second.  Dean, idiot that he is, wants to sit on the ottoman across from him and lean into his space and get his hands on that deltoid.
“I’m sorry, I—” Cas says at last, and Dean shakes his head. He comes over and grasps his shoulder, firm.
Jack calls eventually because he and Sam came home two hours ago and Cas and Dean are still nowhere to be found. Their Blizzards, Jack adds sorrowfully, are completely melted.
“No problem, kid. Help me put away these meats, hey?” Dean says, sliding the styrofoam packages out of the bag and handing them one by one to Jack, who quickly stacks them in the fridge. “Potatoes, huh? Maybe baked potatoes? SuperBowl theme?”
“Not hurting you,” Cas says finally, looking toward the sky. They both sit in silence for a second, soaking in the sound.
“Counting on it,” Dean says, and winks, feeling brave. Cas rolls his eyes good-naturedly and returns to his book. Dean slaps the edge of the doorframe and scurries to the kitchen, where Sam is waiting. He is obviously researching something, with his entire life spread out in front of him
Cas usually woke up chilled. It was November. The air outside was getting colder by the day, and the air inside the underground bunker was having a difficult time retaining the heat from its ancient furnace. A constant coolness always seemed to hang overhead, chilling everyone to the bone, and yet Dean, the madman, still claimed he couldn’t sleep without a fan running and blowing cool air all over them. It was no wonder Cas was always freezing when he woke up.
“Hey there, best friend.”
“Do you know where everyone is today?”  I ask as she snaps off a handful and tosses them into my burlap sack.  I’m fairly certain I know the answer to the question, but I’m curious to see if she has an opinion.
“That’s for ignoring me,”  he says.  When he lowers his punch and slugs me in the gut, my knees almost give out from underneath me.  “And that was just for fun.”
I plunge to my knees at the edge of the gurgling stream.  I scrub the blood off my right hand, scoop a handful of cold water and rinse the blood from my neck, my face, my nose and mouth.  My nose has stopped bleeding, thankfully, so my mouth is free of that metallic tang, but the cuts from the knife still ooze.  It’s as good as I’m going to get.
“Only a few more minutes until we’re back home,”  Bobby says, letting himself into the room.  I don’t mind, though.  After all the effort he went through to help keep us alive, he can do whatever he wants.  “How are you boys feeling?”
I can hear Cas saying my name, can hear Bobby letting go of another sigh, but I don’t stop.  I need to be alone.  I storm into my room and slam the door shut so forcefully that it rattles my bones, and even that isn’t enough to appease my blinding indignation.
Dean laughed again, though much softer this time. He turned onto his side—the whole mattress rocked and about made Cas want to throw up—and lightly brushed a few stray strands of damp hair away from Cas’ forehead. “I know. Fevers suck,” he sympathized. The amusement in his voice was gone, replaced with pure commiseration and solace. “I wish I could tell you there was an easy fix, but there’s really not. You just gotta rest up and drink a lot of fluids. It’ll go away on its own eventually.”
Ripping Cas from his thoughts, Dean patted Cas’ hand. “What do you say we go check on him?” he offered. “Then we can look online for some houses for sale. If you want, anyway.”
“Of course,” Dean said. Without even thinking, he lifted his arm and wrapped it around Cas’ shoulders, pulling him closer still. “You know I’d do anything for you.”
I throw each and every one of my pillows against the wall, across the room, anywhere.  I hate the Capitol for creating the Hunger Games.  I hate the Capitol for coming up with the Quarter Quells.  I hate the Capitol for putting us through so much torture, so much agony, all for their entertainment.
When Cas nodded, thoughtfully humming his appreciation, Dean took that as an invitation to release him from his grasp and take a step back. “Now,” Dean started with a deep breath, giving Cas’ shoulder a soft squeeze, “how about I get you that drink I promised?”
This can’t be happening.  “
It takes a moment for the ringing in my ears to subside.  Then I hear his frantic, worried voice as he asks me what happened, if I’m okay.  He reaches out to touch the cuts on my face that feel crusted with dried blood, but I’m far from troubled about my injuries right now.  All I can concentrate on is how elated I am that he’s okay.
Still, I can’t swallow the fear swelling inside of me.  Anything could happen once I leave the safety of the foliage.  Anything.  But I know I can’t back down, no matter how terrified I am.  If I don’t get that medicine, Cas is going to die.  Plain and simple.  And I can’t die out there, either.  I’m his last hope.  If I die, he dies, and I can’t let that happen.  I made a promise.  I have to get that medicine and stay alive for his sake.
Charlie falls silent, her usual cheery expression vanishing without a trace.  “How many times?”  she finally asks, her voice so soft it’s nearly carried away by the summery breeze.
I’m starting to get frustrated and panicky.  I’ve been here for too long.  Someone is bound to come running soon, and I still haven’t found a container of medicine.  Not even something as simple as painkillers, let alone the antivenom I specifically came here for.  Dread courses through me when I think about the possibility of the Gamemakers and Claudius lying to get me to come here and encounter another tribute, but the next container I open up holds a bottle of pills.  Now I find the painkillers.  So where’s that antivenom?
I fight to keep myself awake and conscious as I move my right arm back toward the pocket on my leg.  I stare Cresh down the entire time I do so.
“You’re looking a little sweaty there, Dean.  Need some help?”
It’s still just barely past dawn when I leave the hollow and get my bearings.  Golden rays of the rising sun pierce through the canopy and awaken the rainforest around me, bringing forward a new day.  If I’m quick, maybe I can beat some of the other tributes to the Cornucopia and get the supplies I need before they arrive.  It’s early.  It’s possible that most of them were still sleeping or far away from the glade the Games first began in when Claudius made his announcement.  With that in mind to fuel my determination, I start speed walking.
Cas’ face flashes on the screen next; everyone quiets down in an instant.  “And Castiel Novak, from District Nine, with a score of…”
Panic overwhelms me.  Everything is happening so fast.  Cresh is still writhing on the ground, my switchblade protruding from his stomach, and I hear pounding footsteps approaching.  My left hand is still pinned to the earth.  I can’t move it, can’t get away from the scene before the other boy from District 1 finds me.
This year, much to my horror, only males are going to be reaped for the special hundredth anniversary of the dreaded Hunger Games.
“I’m glad you’re feeling better,” Dean said one morning as the two of them sat in the quiet kitchen, drinking coffee. Yes, coffee. Just when Cas thought he couldn’t have been more overjoyed to be healthy again. “I was worried about you. I hated seeing you so miserable.”
Journeying into the unknown, potentially certain doom, brings a slew of thoughts to mind.  I wonder how excited and eager the people of the Capitol are about the restocking of the Cornucopia.  Usually I think scenarios like these are called feasts, big events that are sure to lure in the tributes who are desperate for life-saving supplies.  I suppose I’m one of those desperate tributes, aren’t I?  Here I am, well aware that I’m waltzing straight into a trap that will undoubtedly end with bloodshed so I can save my district partner.  I just hope it won’t be my blood that gets spilled.
Then, I feel him smile, but only just barely.  “Okay, it’s
The trainer and I fought for at least five minutes straight, and he did not take it easy on me in the slightest.  Still, despite suffering a few minor defeats, I indisputably came out on top and showed the Gamemakers my ability to fight with a sword.  They seemed impressed with my accomplishments, some nodding their heads and others jotting down notes in their notebooks while I stood panting like a dog in the center of the gymnasium.  Overall, I was proud of myself.  I was so proud, in fact, that before I was dismissed from my session, I managed to muster up enough confidence to slice off some limbs of one of the training dummies, just for extra flair.  That really sparked the Gamemakers’ interests.  The Head Gamemaker thanked me with the faintest trace of a smile, and then I was free to return to my apartment.
But, he’s not quite done yet.  There’s a pause as he lets the rambunctious crowd settle down, and then the air falls so still and silent that I can hear birds chirping in the distance.  My heartbeat quickens as he turns to us, reaching into his pockets.  What is he doing?  Bobby didn’t tell us anything about this.  The panic begins to seep back into my bloodstream before I can stop it.
Sam nodded his understanding, his brows knitted together in commiseration. “You should get back to him, just in case,” he said. “I’m sure he still feels awful. I wouldn’t want him to wake up and worry about where you went.”
The sweltering sun beats down on my back.  I can feel the sweat rolling over my hot skin.  There isn’t a single cloud in the cerulean sky, nor is there any shade for me to cool off under.  It has to be one of the hottest days of the year, yet here I am, snapping off wheat seed heads with my scratched up hands like my life depends on it.
“I’ll start wearing eyeliner and never shower again,” Cas said with a smirk, which merely earned him another playful jab in the side.
Dean almost seemed to read his mind, too, a half-cheeky, half-affectionate smile lighting up his face as he gave Cas’ arm a gentle, playful punch. “Why don’t you go pick out a movie for us to watch?” he suggested, turning to open the cupboard and grab a glass. “I’ll be there in a minute.”
Cas really hoped he wasn’t driving Dean insane with all his ceaseless, heartfelt “I love yous.”
Cas merely nods, and Bobby laughs because he says they won’t have to work very hard on the bashful part.
Rowena makes us answer some basic questions that Caesar might ask us in the interview—like what we think of the Capitol, how training went, our families back home—and corrects us when we pause to think or hesitate on a response.  Since we only have three minutes, it’s important to always keep talking.  If our answers aren’t rude or illogical, anyway.  We run through the questions a few times before we finally start to get the hang of how she wants us to respond, and that’s with mirth and eloquence.
I can’t do this anymore.
I want to go home.
“We’ll all be up front,”  my mother says, her eyes still glistening with tears as she tucks a stray strand of hair behind my ear.  She tells me she loves me, which, of course, prompts a whole round of everyone exchanging those words within their families.  Then Cas joins me at my side, and my hand finds its place on the small of his back as we follow Bobby out of the train station.
“Thank you, Sam,” Cas said, quite frankly in awe of the assortment before him, but Sam wasn’t done just yet. He was still digging out one more thing from the grocery bags.
“Well,”  he says with a sleepy smile, one that makes butterflies flutter in my stomach.  “Today’s the day.  Are you ready?”
Somehow, by some divine blessing, I see the vines come into view through my whirling vision.  I sweep them aside and almost tumble down the slope into the safety of the hollow.  I made it.  I survived.  Just barely, but I still survived.  Relief starts to wash over me.
A nine!  I actually pulled a nine!  My score is somehow right up there with the rest of the Careers, which is both exhilarating and horrifying for a multitude of different reasons.  I can’t believe I managed to receive a nine.  I thought I’d be lucky to get a seven, maybe even an eight due to my lack of experience, but a nine?  It never even crossed my mind, but I’m elated.
Let me know in the comments which one you prefer!  I don't really want to tack on an extra chapter to this story in a few months, but I'll leave that up to you!  Whatever is the easiest for you <3
I loosen my grip on him, lean back so I can look at his face.  His bright blue eyes meet mine, and it’s like no one else in the world exists except us.  I’m so full of adrenaline that I barely notice my own hand trailing up his back, over his shoulder, up to rest on his cheek.  His eyes widen, just slightly, but he doesn’t move.  I wonder if he can hear how loudly my heart is racing.
As the days trudged on, Cas’ well-being improved little by little. He kept watching movies with Dean. He kept eating the delicious soup and other easy-to-eat meals Dean prepared for him. He kept resting and taking his medicine and drinking his fluids. And whenever Dean was busy making food or generally just not paying attention, Cas would research nearby ranch houses up for sale. Most of them looked old and run-down, but truthfully, those only intrigued Cas more. The mere thought of renovating a dilapidated house in the countryside with the love of his life, making it their own, made him feel far better than any dose of medicine.
“I — no. No! You just bought this couch!”
and never know which will come out
Cas’s smile is a little shaky, like he truly believed Dean might say no. Like he doubts that Dean has dreamed about this. Slowly, Cas opens the box again, and very carefully takes out the collar to buckle it around Dean’s neck.
When he did forget himself and jump up just because Cas needed a refill, Dean pretended he needed the restroom or a glass of water, and does Cas need anything while he’s up?
A shiver runs down Dean’s spine. “You’re my Dom for tonight, right?”
“I don’t.”
“No. Want.” Dean swallows, suddenly dry-mouthed. “Want your hand.”
Cas tenses next to him. “What?”

Toothbrush in his mouth, Dean wonders if the almost-kiss was just the kind of moment that accidentally happens when everything is hushed and soft in the early morning or if a second chance will come around. He lets himself hope.
“You’ve been holding out on me,” Dean says, grinning.
The oven timer goes off. Dean gives Cas a bashful smile as they part, and Cas smiles back, maybe a little bashful himself. “Were you always such a sap?” Dean asks as he pulls pans out of the oven.

No objections
Somehow it’s even hotter in Castiel’s prim way of speaking.
It’s probably for the best that another panelist was quicker to the mic than Dean and Cas, or Dean may never be invited to speak publicly again. “I’m not sure if you’ve heard of Bela Talbot,” the other panelist said, knowing very well that all of them had, “but she’s an omega who will achieve the first commercial manned space flight while Elon Musk is still trying to keep his rockets from exploding at launch.”

“Honey, you’re in trouble,” Cas says with an answering grin, stalking up to Dean and pulling him into a searing kiss.
Dean kisses Castiel first. It’s not something that angels do, whatever this thing is that’s happening with Dean, but he doesn’t care at all and kisses back and when their clothes come off for the first time, Dean touches him and his wings with quiet devotion Castiel is hardly deserving of.

“Are there going to be any attempts at a happy ending?” Cas asks, raising an eyebrow.
Dean licks salt off the back of his hand, tosses back the shot, and then sinks his teeth into a lime. The gold tequila sits warm in his belly and the lime sits sour on his tongue.
“Hang on,” Dean says. “Maybe Cas doesn’t—”

“I don’t want to be without you,” Dean says.
Cas leans down and presses a kiss to Dean’s temple, surprisingly tender. “I want to find out how much you can take.”
“Shit, and I hardly know any Wipso.”
“Hurts,” Dean says, smiling. “Like hell, actually.”
the end of the cane across Dean’s ass, just barely hard enough to feel it. “Don’t call me that.”
“Is this what you’ve been weird about all day? You really think I care?”
“I’ve paid plenty of attention,” Dean says without meaning to. His face goes hot but Cas doesn’t seem to notice, peering out the window at the Hill Country sprawling underneath them.
“You’re not,” Cas says, reflexively.  “There’s no one like you. As good as you.”
“We both professed our undying love in the ultimate chick-flick moment,” Dean says.
“Now, get dressed. Panties if you have them,” Cas says, stepping back. “I’m starving.”
As if he can sense it, Cas reaches out and pets a hand through Dean’s hair. “You do realize I’ll say more nice things about you now, right? For example: you’re such a good boy to be waiting, ready for me. That makes me so happy.”
Dean blinks. Licks his lips. Nods.
“It’s not what you think,” Dean says, wincing. “We’re just—you know, we’re helping each other out. Nothing more to it.”

A softball: how many hours a day do you write? Does writing energize or tire you?
Dean rubs his cheek against Cas’s, pulse starting to slow. They bask in each other, the warmth where they’re touching, the aligning of their heartbeats, the softness of their breaths.
“Not like, you know, melting in water — I mean, we’ve been swimming — or like — obviously not like the moles and Boffo stuff — I mean — Jesus, this sounded a lot better in my head.”
"Why are you looking at me like that?" from
Just as abruptly as the kiss started, it ends, with Cas grabbing Dean’s hair and shoving him to bend across the kitchen island, ass in the air. Dean hides a grin in his arms as Cas presses one hand on the back of Dean’s head and the other at the small of his back. “Stay there.”
In the morning, his temperature is ricocheting from hot to cold and he turns the fan on and then off again a hundred times. It’s not until the end of the day, when he’s signing off at work more exhausted than he’s felt in recent memory, that he realizes. It’s been months since he scened with Cas, and the biological imperative to submit is rearing its ugly head.

ricochets around his head until it feels like a dream. He considers asking Cas to say it again.

“True,” Cas says.
“Have fun,” Cas says. “I’m going to go ravish my sub.”
“Like this,” Cas says, and patiently shows Dean. Dean thinks he figured it out, but after several dropped sushi, Cas tosses his chopsticks aside and they both use their fingers.
“Yes, my soulmark is a tramp-stamp. I’ve heard all the jokes.”
Just when Cas is about to make another snarky comment, Dean spreads his hands across the top of Cas’s shoulders. The oil makes Cas’s skin shine in a distracting way, but Dean forces himself to focus, gently prodding to find the knots. There’s not a lot of them—probably all that yoga—but Cas groans when Dean circles his thumbs over one of them.
I’m sorry to break this to the critics, but queer people exist, and we deserve to exist in stories, too. We deserve to be visible.
“I’m sorry, sir, we’re booked. I can check with the other locations nearby, but considering the festival...”
Still, when Dean strokes himself in the shower, the first thing he thinks of is Cas’s clever hands. Pretty hands with long, delicate fingers, pretty hands that have turned Dean into a sobbing mess with pain but still manage to touch him tenderly. There are other ways he could turn Dean into a sobbing mess, and Dean imagines it now, Cas’s fingers sliding in deep while he whispers
Of course. Tonight, if you’d like. I’ll come over after you get home.
This is what Cas wanted when he booked their honeymoon. Just them, far away from the real world. Intimate, belonging to each other.
Cas smiles. “Do you mind if we eat in tonight?”
Cas snorts a laugh. “None of my other friends would offer.”
“Like I can still breathe.”
Cas must sense the moment Dean is back to himself because he draws away, though not far. “How are you?” he murmurs, forehead pressed against Dean’s.
The casual possessiveness of it makes Dean shiver. Cas gives Dean an appraising look and says, “I’d like that massage now.”

“You don’t get to beat me up and not even cuddle me afterwards,” Dean says, reaching for Cas’s arm. “Come on.”
Cas doesn’t really believe him, doesn’t relax until he’s gently cleaned Dean up with a washcloth until all traces are gone.
Dean’s father is dead, and he wonders if grief sometimes feels like relief.
Castiel flushes again. “I might have a business card in my wallet—”
Cas nods and keeps running his fingers through Dean’s hair until he manages to get himself upright on shaking legs. “Dammit,” he says, looking down at his jeans pooling around the top of his boots.

“Of course I am. You’re not going to miss out on half a day’s pay for my selfishness.” Cas grabs Dean’s hand and pulls him close for a lingering kiss. “I am, however, going to sneak you out of here in a few minutes.”

Awesome
Cas passes to Dean, who takes a small hit before handing it back. Night is falling all around them, the sky wearing stars like jewelry, the moon a bright pendant around her neck. Dean feels lighter already, like he could sprout wings.
- "I'm going to kill you."
Dean doesn’t die immediately. He’s thrown clear of the Impala and lays in the middle of the road, staring up at the bright blue sky for what seems like forever but is really only a few minutes, and then he’s gone.
The hits are muffled a bit by the cloth, but Cas rains down blows without mercy until Dean’s chest is heaving for breath and tears are staining the couch. Pain is different like this. It’s bright but not blinding; warm but not scorching. It’s bliss like no other, and Dean finds himself hoping it’ll go on for hours.
Dean cries from the intensity of it, not just the pain-pleasure from the paddle but the euphoria of pleasing his Dom. He doesn’t have to see or hear Cas to know it; it’s just something in the air, mixing with the thuds of the paddle to put Dean back together from whatever has chipped away at him in the past.
“And what happened?!”
—but Dean insists and Cas doesn’t put up too much of a fuss. Cas leaves the kitchen altogether, and a minute later music starts to play from one of Dean’s speakers.

It takes three tries for his card to scan, and he gives a grateful smile to the ever-patient driver when it finally does. The bus starts before he gets the card back in his wallet and he stumbles, nearly dropping his books into a kid’s lap. “Sorry, sorry,” he says, pulling his books tighter to his chest and glancing around the bus, gaze landing on the only free seat, just vacated by a xenophobic asshole.
“Yes. I intend to ravish the hell out of you by smoking and watching bad tv.”
“I’ve been struggling,” Cas says quietly.
While the phone rings, Dean schools his face into something appropriately morose. He barely manages to tamp down his kid-with-a-secret grin, but that’ll have to do.

“What?” Dean says. “Seriously?”
“It was an accident.”
“You’re very beautiful,” Cas whispers, and Dean closes his eyes against it, though there’s nothing he can do to stop the flush spreading from his cheeks down to his chest. “I’ve wanted you for so long.”
(See the end of the chapter for

dead the whole time.
Cas rolls out from under Dean’s arm to stretch, the sheet pooling around his hips as he arches his back. He gives Dean a sly smile when he catches him watching, but Dean just rolls his eyes.
“There’s nothing that would make me happier,” Cas says, something bitter twisting the corner of his mouth. He looks down at the dirt below their feet.
Cas is silent. After a moment’s pause, Dean checks Cas’ face, expecting disgust or pity at the very least. Instead, Cas is just frozen solid, like a block of marble. Like one of those shitty living statues. The only thing giving him away is his shoulders, rising and falling as he breathes.
“Wait,” Cas croaks. He reaches his arm out for Dean. “Dean, you-,” he starts again. He clears his throat.
“Do you want the light-?” Dean trails off.
Now, there is very little else Cas wants to do but to sway into his space and put his fingers down one by one on Dean’s collar to feel the heat of him underneath. He wants to tuck his hands in between Dean’s shirts, to smile coyly up at him like those women in bars do when they see a handsome man. He wants to know that him being there in Dean’s personal space is exactly what Dean came tonight to accomplish. That all Dean wanted was to woo a man like him. That Dean was looking his way all night.
He is struck suddenly by visions of hamburgers, the big juicy ones Dean showed him sometimes. He whimpers at the thought, feeling like the very lowest of the human species. He edges his white sleeve over his hand and pushes off from the wall. He remembers Sam’s warm hand on his shoulder. Sometimes you have to just keep going no matter what. He feels like his legs are about to give way. Some superweapon he is.
“Stirring cream cheese,” Cas says dubiously. He still releases Dean’s waist and moves for the bowl, having been resigned to his fate as sous chef since he came back human. Dean, asshole, shifts the bowl so it’s just out of Cas’ reach based on a split-second decision to be annoying.
It’s DEAN’S FAVORITES 2001, made back when he thought he was all that and then some. Not that that has changed a lot, but this tape was in his white-hot and heavy days, where he would get any girl that looked his way and got into more bar fights than he could afford. Cas opens the clear plastic protective case and carefully feeds it into Baby’s tape deck.
I know my own car, Cas,” Dean says. Cas’ eyes are covered by the cheap sunglasses, but he can feel the glare already. Cas then slings his arm across the back of Dean’s seat and looks over his shoulder as he maneuvers the car carefully into the spot.
“You either,” Dean says. Dean feels like he needs to take deep breaths to keep himself from passing out. Just being here, here in Cas’ proximity — it’s all he wanted.
Cas has explained how interdimensional angel travel works a thousand times. It’s never gotten that much clearer to Dean, but it always scares the shit out of him when Cas just
“Just be you, Cas,” Jody says. “You’re a top-notch guy.” She punches him in the shoulder, which does hurt.
They come into the bunker to Jack face down on the map table, dead asleep, still wearing his clothes from earlier. For such a gentle kid, he snores like a freight train. Dean lags at the stairway, unsure of the protocol here. Jack and Cas usually have the important late-night conversations, while Dean strains to listen from his bedroom.
“Well, I,” Dean starts, his hand going to the back of his neck. “Well. That case didn’t go great.”
Then she lets me go, tears sliding down her cheeks but a bright smile still shining in her eyes, and her attention fixes on something behind me.  “Hold on,”  she tells me.  “I have to go hug my new best friend.”
Dean was heaving a sigh before he could stop himself. “Really, Sam?” he complained. “You couldn’t have put on a pot of coffee for the late sleepers?”
Netflix and chill. But not the sexy kind. Just Netflix playing on his laptop while he and Cas stayed in bed all day.
Cas goes to his room to change out of his pajamas.  These thirty minutes are bound to fly by, so I make haste to change into something presentable.  I’m in the middle of rinsing off my blotchy face when Cas returns.  Thankfully, the cold water evens out the color of my skin, little by little, but then I wonder if it’s even worth it.  There’s no doubt I’ll be crying at the train station again when we’re reunited with our families.  Still, I suppose it doesn’t hurt to start with a clean slate.
Bobby’s suggested demeanor for me is lionhearted, slightly snarky and witty, and most importantly, fiercely protective of who I care about.  That part is true—it’s the whole reason why I’m sitting here right now—but I’m too frustrated to really question his other ideas.  I just want to get this over with as fast as possible.
