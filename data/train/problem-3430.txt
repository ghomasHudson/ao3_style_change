“Dean didn’t plant anything in my head. I wanted to come down and visit, since I didn’t exactly leave on the best of terms.”
“Only jokin’.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, hey Castiel, didn’t see you there…” He grumbled, obviously annoyed at what he assumed was a rude entrance on my part.
Circuits blew throughout my head at his reply.
“There’s two whole crates full of pretzels in the trunk of my car that I need for tonight, since we’re almost out, and I have to talk to Castiel about something in private. Would you mind getting them for me?”
I voiced what questions I had once he paused, trying my best not to be rude,
Cas faces sunk just as my spirits lifted even higher than they’d been all that morning, the horror and defeat in his expression oddly rewarding,
“Well then you still have your work cut out for you, then! Don’t let this one get away, Cas!” My companion giggled at the annoyance her humorous determination inspired within me, evident in my sigh and the sink of both my shoulders, before making her own way over to my side of the bar. Her choice method of transportation was flinging herself over the wooden structure and landing, with surprising grace, on both her feet just in front of me.
And Dean voiced this.
A sound did cut through the almost-silence, however, and it was that damned door bell once more. Yet instead of immediately flinging my head and vision upwards to see who’d entered, I just averted my eyes slightly to get at least a sideways glance at who’d waltzed in at twenty one minutes past eleven, and was met with a pleasing sight, full of red hair, giggles, and skipping steps.
Regardless, I wasn’t able to look her in the eyes anymore, and I knew from countless experiences with those numerous strangers I conversed with for a living that lack of eye-contact was a definite sign of lying or avoidance. I distracted my own line of vision by staring at my hands, fingers fiddling with the button attached to the sleeve of my shirt, though it was hardly sufficient in its purpose.
Dean Winchester’s voice came from deep within his chest, caught gravel and was scratched up in the process once it reached his throat, and the way his lips formed around the individual words allowed for much mumbling and several speech imperfections. Perhaps that it was just the drunken version, though one couldn’t deny the sound’s tremble. The way it came out in pieces only furthered my assumption: he was broken. Parts of him were in shattered fragments and instead of alcohol being the glue he so desperately needed and searched for, it merely separated the fragments farther until some were lost and deemed irreplaceable.
“Yeah, sure thing. What do you need?” He replied. I wanted to shake him and scream at him to deny the offer, reject the question, though I bit my tongue instead. Quite literally.
“Sounds a little weird if you ask me!” my dad decided to roar, and I realized with an instantly heavy heart that he was the only one in the fastly shrinking room that did so. Eyes flicking back and forth between the other two occupants within those four walls, I searched for some form of ignorance, for some sign that told me they didn’t know me as well as they seemed to, but my search proved to be fruitless. The tension in the air was burning away at what little defenses I had left and I was left to wait anxiously for someone to change the subject away from a topic that I didn’t even understand myself.
Dean chuckled weakly, the sound very dissatisfying in comparison to what one of his true laughs must sound like, and shook his head no in that damned kind of denial that sent chills of frustration and worry coursing through me. He was never this casual and this defeated in his troubles; he was supposed to be angry and fired up, but this was something else entirely.
“My dad took it, I guess. If I wasn’t fuckin’ around, I was being told that I wasn’t good enough for Sammy, wasn’t good enough for the family, wasn’t good enough for him...the works.”
There was supposed to be a head of dark hair and huge, concerned eyes and hands that dealt Dean’s drug of choice – that fucking
“Would you like another?”
at it than Dean?
“Holy shit, really? That’s insane!”
“I found it rather sad,” I murmured with a small shrug of my shoulders, squeezing out of the way as Charlie craned her head around my front to get a look at the subject in question, allowing me to get a faceful of her electric red hair. She didn’t seem to share in my sympathy, seeing as though her eyes were alive with curiosity and a twisted kind of humour.
“But come on! With my boss? My male boss?”
“You’re not interested in little miss broken dreams and too much wine because you’re into sir leather- jacket-and-dangerous-jawline!”
“It’s nothing new,” He grumbled, pausing from his drink, taking his free hand and wiping the side of his face. With the streak came off a wall of his defenses; I watched as his eyes grew sadder.
Feeling the moment, feeling the butterflies, and no longer really feeling all that cold, I went along with his little game, knowing that Charlie would be proud.
“It was that Dean guy, right? The guy in the leather jacket that stayed till we closed?”
I held in my groan and Cas, noticing my aggravation, began busying himself with re-buttoning the first few buttons at the top of my shirt, adjusting my collar as he did so.
Dean smiled in that way I’d watched him do before, one that could be misleading to some, but I had it mapped out. It was a smile full of awkwardness, the inability to truly admit to accept any form of complement or sentiment, but it let me know my concluding statements had been acknowledged, and that alone brought a smile all my own to my face, though it was one that I tried my hardest to conceal. He didn’t need to be aware of the way my heart’s pulse had increased, or the way I could hear the blood pounding in my ears, or the dampness within the palms of my hands, or even the thoughts running through my oxygen-deprived head.
“It’s definitely not like that, at all.”
"Excuse me…sir, I'm afraid that I have to close up now…"
“Where...where did that room go, then?” I said, voice shaking and eyes barely able to make feasible contact.
Once the clock struck ten-thirty, I’d conversed with two nuns who’d ordered coffee, nothing more, and spoke to me about the fate of the world, how God was about to strike down and “zap away the human race, just like that!” “Just like that!”, and their humorous take on an otherwise morbid and grave topic almost made my smile real, almost took away the new undertone of stress that’d followed me around the rest of the night.
Raphael was who people knew our family by, because they didn’t truly know him. He was evidently jealous of Michael and their relationship fizzled out the moment we left Michael to fly to the sunny shores. Raphael pushed himself after that, achieving nearly perfect grades and got involved in every club one could possibly think of, and I used to gawk over the perfection he’d achieved. In retrospect, I realized that he was not the only one involved in achieving it all, and my memory of him was clouded and stained by the way he’d demeaned each member of our family for being nothing but an obstacle to him, for getting in the way on his path to greatness, and I thought by the look in his dark eyes that he wanted to hurt me. Three days later, he left for Harvard and he got no kiss goodbye.
“Thanks. You’ve just given him three months worth of material to bug the hell outta me with.”
I suppose it took one to know one, but I kept such a sad thought to myself as I sipped my scotch. There were two intrusive ice cubes floating about the amber liquid, and I sighed.
Her eyes didn’t stop enlarging and just as I was sure they were about to just pop out of her head, followed by the dislocation of her agape jaw, her hand rose up from its limp position at her side and fell onto my shoulder in a weak grasp. Upon further examination, I saw that her pupils weren’t even focused on my face, or anywhere close to my face, for that matter, but I didn’t dare follow her line of vision. Its target was somewhere behind me, close to the front door, I presumed, and judging by the clanging of the door bell and the nearly-winter chill that blew across my clothed arms, someone had entered. It didn’t take a rocket scientist or a psychic to guess who’d just walked into the pub, either.
The one thing I did not expect however, during my mental failure and his breakdown of his inner self, was for my shattering companion to speak, and validate the irreparably insensitive theory that had crawled from the depths of my head.
. I don’t get it. I don’t get
“Thanks though,” She chimed, and the double doors bustled back and forth behind her. Within seconds, I could feel Kevin’s eyes train on me.
“Oh...sorry about that,” I said hurriedly, my words mashed together into one breath. “Um, what are you-”
He still refused to look at me.
“Put this on, go outside, and don’t be so stupid,” she insisted, nearly begged. “I’ve been manning the bar and waiting tables all night and even I can tell that he was so damn into you that he could hardly stand it, and now he thinks you don’t care about him whatsoever-”
I am SO sorry for the wait on this one. I was actually at a concert a good four and a half hours away on Friday night and the time for writing just seemed to escape me this past week, so the bulk of this chapter was written today. I hope you can forgive whatever foolish spelling/grammar mistakes are left. Also, I know this is a MONSTER in length, so if you read all the way through, hats off to you! I wanted to get this very important installment done and published as a whole so the next final part will make more sense. It's an epilogue, I suppose, and it's sure to be just lovely.
“You really shouldn’t have to listen to a whiny sonuvabitch like me though, not fair to you…”
“But I don’t need some...stranger listenin’ in on my life story and my issues, ‘kay? I appreciate your concern and all but…”
It takes both a lifetime and not even a second to discover the culprit.
The flattery colored in my skin again and, apart for me searching frantically for what his reasons were for now being so nice, I managed to say something polite in response.
It was Dean and I was about to approach his car. With him in it. After we’d just shared whatever it was we’d done earlier.
Those were the last of the words that were spoken for a little while. Dean placed the money in the space between my elbows and his tantalizing hands, never taking his eyes off of mine, and for the first time I didn’t even bother counting it in my head to see how much he would deny when I tried to pay him the difference. I was too lost in the strange, indecipherable moment he’d just created by ceasing to look away and break the stare.
That ghost didn’t depart for hours on end, not until the moonlight was seeping silver through the window panes, purple had painted itself under my eyes, and the golf team was stumbling out of the door with their green-and-brown stained white pants brushing loudly together. I watched them go through long, heavy yawns and through squinted eyes. Energy was not something that I had an abundance of at that point, but seeing that the time was only minutes before eleven sent a wave of dread through the drowsy parts of me. I still had hours to go, but no sign of my expected visitor. The dread was accompanied by a doubtful heart, one that felt weighted and unwanted in my chest, and I hoped that the dreadlocks girl was okay.
And, under his breath, he added,
“You’re probably wonderin’ why the hell I stayed with the man for so long, while I still support him today,” he said with an increased volume and a vain attempt at humor evident in the sound, though I had to admit his statement did align with my inquiries.
“you’re impossible.”
“don’t you have family to visit?”
“I believe something is vibrating in the pocket of your jeans, Dean,” Cas explained to me, instantly pulling away from his favored spot on my neck just above my collarbone, acting as though we’d done nothing but pass by in the hall, complete strangers. He had a knack for immediately shutting down whatever kind of energy he accumulated during such exchanges.
How in the world had he done that? How could he have known that, after hardly paying me any mind the past three times we’d interacted? His revelation sent more chills up and down my arms and, damn, did Dean Winchester notice and did he grin. It was a grin that could light up the moonlight-drowning pub and make it look like it was ten in the morning when the sun was free of clouds and its ray were the strongest. He grinned at me like he was as all-knowing as the sun, like he had nothing to lose, but knew he’d gained a key piece of information about me.
“Interested in little miss mascara and hair-dye over there?” She taunted, and even though I felt a small amount of pride for knowing that the lady’s hair had, in fact, been dyed, I shook my head no quickly, as if the speed would further imply my answer.
Every fiber of my being was begging Sam to leave me out of it. I’d defended him enough in my lifetime. I’d driven all the way to see my long-lost brother upon being asked to do so, I was merely doing him a favor, and I did not need the scene that was playing out in front of me, like a movie in which every scene had been ingrained into my head. This exact argument had occurred countless times in the past and was the same down to the last detail: the tone of voice, the word choice, the redenned faces, the rapid arm movements, the alcoholic additives, and even the beverage seeping into the carpeted floor beneath my trembling feet. Everything was practically muscle memory at that point, which is why I shouldn’t have been so blatantly horrified when Sam’s strained, fury-driven speech uttered the single syllable of my name. But I was. More so than I cared to admit or was capable of hiding.
“Oh, Charlie told me to tell you she’s gonna be late today. She’s visiting family downtown I guess, but she’ll close up today. Said you’ve been doing it too much lately.”
I locked my knees in place as to stop them from moving before answering, trying to regain whatever casual edge I’d possessed earlier, before Dean had become so uncharacteristically talkative and involved.
“You make me happy,” Dean whispers before reaching back to Cas’s coat and closing their distance between them. It’s not just physical space that cleared, either; it’s years of unspoken truths, of quietude, of fleeting grazes, of sacrifices, of grace, of damnation, of tears, of anger, of hurt, of separation, reunion, embraces, scars, blood, stab wounds, Heaven, Hell, the tattered remains of a story that an angel of the deceased Almighty Lord had shriveled to pieces in Dean Winchester’s name.
Secondarily, there were the ever present middle aged men with uncomfortable neck-beards and unnerving dark eyes, forever cast down at the amber liquid in their glasses or bottles not out of shame or any true emotion, but simply because they were much too drunk to raise their line of vision any higher. To accompany them were the forty year old "failures,” as my co-workers referred to them as, while I simply called them misguided souls. They often times were women, with cheap makeup plastering their eyelids and cheeks while lipstick colored their lips in like a child doodling in their coloring books, and they hung around those middle aged men, who had no sense of time or self control, until they accomplished something and whoever was bartending on that unfortunate evening was left to pick up the spewed contents of their insides and clean up their dirty bottles.
“Is Castiel Novak offering me a ride home?”
“I suppose that’s true,” I admitted both defeatedly and in total awe of his sudden knowledge of me and of what was now our game. It didn’t sit right with me, and I needed to sit down. My knees hadn’t ceased shaking and his unavoidable stare of pride and what looked to me like victory, igniting those flecks like fires, was not assisting in any relief efforts.
Dean motioned towards his glass, and I happily obliged to fulfill his request, but I took the few moments of personal space as a period of thought. He wasn’t speaking, not really. He was avoiding, avoiding every possible window I was offering him. I needed to say something. I couldn’t give him much of an option. It was past eleven PM on a Sunday night, those of a holy occupation had long since vacated the premises, and I still had a game to win.
my worry.
The two of us laughed at the amusement and accuracy in his depiction of the bar crowd that evening, probably picking it up from Charlie’s merciless discrimination of them or my annoyance towards the lot, but I was a little too distracted to let the moment fill me to the brim like Dean seemed to be doing. It was more than slightly embarrassing to know that even he could sense that he really was my favorite-favorite regular, favorite train wreck, favorite drunk, favorite broken soul, whatever he wanted to label himself as that night-and I did have another one of his touchy, sensitive questions to answer. It was an easy decision to keep the trend of daring honesty going, too, once I saw where it was taking us.
“When the hell didja pick up running?” Bobby exclaimed, but then seemed to think differently about the question, and continued,
Again with the monotone voice, but I couldn’t help it. My blatant curiosity beat the need to be socially normal/acceptable. I watched Charlie’s humoured grin shift into something a bit deeper and she looked at me like she was teaching me a life lesson all about love, but I couldn’t imagine what. If a homosexual, cheating husband and a false raven-haired suburban wife who needed to sort out her priorities was all love was, then I wasn’t entirely interested.
Dean nodded his head and then ran his hands through his strangely disorderly hair, its appearance most likely brought about by the weather dragging on mercilessly outside, yet it seemed as though everything about him was deteriorating in a way that I couldn’t grasp how to help stop. It was absolutely maddening, almost as maddening as the strain and the pauses in his voice.
“He went on to Harvard to study law and become an attorney soon after, and he’s living in New York at the moment, alone I believe, but sitting atop a large stack of money. My parents always bragged about him.”
For the first time in as many Thursday nights that I could remember, I could not bring myself to ask him any of those questions.
“Whoa, what’s wrong?” She asked, scanning the same bar I’d been moments before, looking for the source of my obvious mood change.
Soon, however, I remembered that I had to speak as well, and threw out some sort of courteous reply that I could come up with on the spot. All the skills my boss had taught me so long ago when I'd first started working at that small corner pub, like the small smile of politeness now engrained into my very face, were escaping me and it was sending my mind into an unnatural panic mode.
“Is everything alright? You seem a little down.”
I would first like to say thank you to those who read the previous installment, commented, and left kudos-the smile on my face as a result was an embarrassing one but sincere and happy nonetheless. I hope you enjoyed this chapter and that it was a little more involved than the last. Updates, if I can truly pace myself and not fall behind nor get too excited, will come every Sunday. Wow...I feel so official saying that.
“Damn it Castiel...go!” she shrieked, expression so exasperated now a smile of disbelief and internal agony painted itself across her face. “I’m not about to let my best friend in the world miss out on such a great guy and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”
Charlie sent me a beaming grin, just before flinging her head back in a laugh so pure and uplifting that I fought the urge to do the same. There was that part of me still, so heavily distracted and distant from reality, so obsessive and illogical and a little compulsive, that wouldn’t allow me to do so, however, and no matter how hard I tried to hide its existence, my coworker and so-happened-to-be best friend picked up on the presence and sighed. It really did feel as though the walls of my head were windows and she was peering directly inside.
“Heh, maybe I’ll do it when I’m all grown up. You can get free haircuts all the time.”
Thankfully, Charlie caught on and backed away, hands raised in, still, a rather amused form of surrender.
My dad’s eyes were red and a watery, foreign substance was pooling around his lower eyelids, and no one in the world could convince me of what I was truly seeing.
It was the Lord’s Day.
“I can’t take it back, Dean, if that’s what you’re suggesting,” Cas drops into the fray, as seismic and affronting as ever. “But I hold you to no obligation. I…I needed to say it. And I meant it.”
“Probably thinks Jesus Christ himself is coming down in the morning to save us all, in a fiery storm of hell and sin…” she muttered with a smirk, rolling her eyes in the back of her head.
“I know that’s a thing you do.”
“And look at me now!” she exclaimed, her eyes blurry with tears and dripping mascara. “Ranting off about my life’s problems to some stranger bartender…”
“Are you alright, Sam?”
And just like the the journey to his now silent vehicle had transpired, I blinked and he was there, lips moving slowly against my own in a way so tantalizing I felt like I’d blown away in the wind. I believe he attempted to be soft, but there still was substance in his veins, and as a result the whole exchange turned out to be very tenth grade, but I might as well have marked it down as the single best instance of my life.
It was a relief when Bobby arrived though, because at least he had the balls to admit to himself, me, and even Sam if he’d ever been willing to listen, that things weren’t better. The entire house smelled of old habits never shaken, only amplified, and my dad was jumpy. He would perk up at the mention of certain words, certain phrases, certain subjects, and nearly shut down in intervals of slurs and offers of drinks to which we all did our best to deny. Sam was the first to give in, followed by Bobby, and then me, which I found almost humorously ironic. The one who was most like their father in their drinking habits had avoided taking alcohol from that very same father figure the most.
“He’s into you, too, I think. You should see how he looks at you when you’re talking.”
There was one last “act of intimacy” before I started his car, marveling in the appearance of Dean’s car and the fact that I was inside it under such circumstances as I did so, and we were driving to wherever it was he dwelled, my companion spewing haphazard directions as we went and I struggled to follow them accurately, but he didn’t seem to mind, so neither did I. The sound of snow touching down lightly against the windshield, Dean’s gentle breathing, and a startlingly familiar REO Speedwagon song playing from the radio was enough to keep me joyously occupied for hours upon hours, and I didn’t care if we ever reached Dean’s house.
If Dean thought I was so socially incapable that I couldn’t pick up on the undertones lurking in the depths of his voice, which, I found, grew increasingly shallow the more swigs of scotch he took, he was very wrong. Perhaps his own memory was hazy, but he’d relayed to me several instances where his father’s drunken episodes had gotten way out of hand, even offhandedly mentioning where the episodes were physically visible on his own skin, when he’d been under the usual influence. My own voice felt constricted and strained at the thought and recollections of what he was referencing, whether he was aware of it or not. And in fear of bringing up a subject that he would shut down at the sound of, I’d chosen the safer option.
“Look man, I don’t wanna be creepy ‘er anythin’...” He began, and before I knew it his eyes were staring at mine, and before I knew it I was frozen in place like two hands were grasping my ankles for dear life and anchoring me to the floor below. The green of his irises was even brighter now, brought to life by the expansion of his pupils and the alcohol running marathons through his veins.
“He’s right handed. It’s the hand he holds his drink with and the one that holds his wallet in,” I interjected, but quickly realized that my small Winchester-tidbit had done little to help my case. Charlie’s smile just deepened.
“Yes?” Cas asks. Dean feels that, if he answers, he’ll land on the nail again, so he doesn’t reply. He stares, and he nods, and he watches as relief washes Cas’s face in pink before Sam rises from the floor and wraps his gangly monkey arms around the angel of Thursday, freely weeping into his trench coat, eyes flicking between savior and save-e.
“Thank you...I like to think that I know what I’m doing, if only a little bit.”
Throughout our discussion, Charlie’s blue eyes never left my own, and she seemed to thrive on the effect the gaze was having on my poise and stature. Internally it was crumbling to pieces, threatening to collapse in full at any moment if the awkwardness she’d flung into the air didn’t dissipate soon, but I managed to mask the destruction with a clenched jaw, trembling fingers, and a peculiarly level sound of voice. The drawbacks of being so close to Charlie were slim, but one was being enacted in that moment: she knew every quirk I possessed like it was written in black ink across my reddening forehead.
“I didn’t mess up, it was your one fuckin’ job.”
And it was in that period of time, the time that I spent staring at something hopelessly unimportant, that I missed something with a monstrous amount of importance. My vision had not only strayed from the terrified and smashed frat boy, but from the door itself, which I’d promised to keep an eye on just for the slim amount of entertainment it provided. I did not believe in ghosts, something that the horrified college boy did not grasp nor even attempt to understand, so his tale had little to no effect on me, and catching glimpses of all the faces that arrived served as something to do, a passtime.
Eventually I’d gotten around to asking Dean how he’d come to know my name. I didn’t find it odd, mostly just a step toward mutual familiarity and, dare I say it, some warped kind of trust where only one half of the party was sober. Dean informed me that he’d heard “your redhead coworker over there,” obviously referring to Charlie, use it and “figured you wouldn’t really mind.” He was right. I couldn’t mind less, and I gawked at the three times within that Sunday evening where he even shortened my name, like he had that previous Thursday, into Cas.
Where had that part run off to now?
My voice sounded louder than I’d expected it to, and I suddenly felt rude and intrusive for even making a noise. Dean jumped at the sound, his shoulders tensing with the fright and his fingers wrapping even tighter around his glass lifeline, a lifeline that was ironically extremely breakable.
“Ask Dean what it’s been like all these years. You’re right, I barely have a clue. Everything was already laid out for me when I was old enough because Dean put it all there for me. I’ve seen what you’ve done to him, Dad, and-”
I couldn’t deny the logic in his deduction, of course, and scratched the back of my head in a habitual manner oddly similar to my companion’s and was honest. It was beginning to tingle within me.
“That’s not what this is about, trust me.”
I tried to place myself in his shoes, understand his attempt at being relatable, but the only example I could come up with was an alcoholic, and I was not one. I lied though and nodded my head, eyes wide in a blind sort of horror over what I was hearing firsthand, though nothing could bring me to speak.
I worked the late night shifts every Thursday night, and each time, without fail, it proved to be the most eventful and interesting of all the days of the week.
(See the end of the chapter for
I’d been stuck within the clutches of that particularly uncomfortable conversation for a good forty-two minutes, if my laser-like attention on the wall clock, still stationed above the door, proved to be accurate and precise enough, and it was around the fifteen minute mark that I began sincerely doubting the other half of the exchange’s own religious devotion. The copious amount of “good ‘ol liquor” he’d consumed since his very much pronounced arrival (he’d tripped onto his face on the way in, obviously already intoxicated) was rivaled by few. And perhaps I would’ve found more amusement in his shenanigans, found his dedication to convincing me that he, himself, was a deacon at a local Catholic church and that I should come and join him in his endeavors to be more than mildly entertaining, and perhaps I would’ve allowed myself to indulge in whatever terribly inappropriate murmurings I could hear Charlie whisper to Kevin behind me, but I was far too distracted to do any of the above.
“Just you? C’mon man, there’s gotta be more to it,” Dean insisted. His sudden burst of blind faith in me made even less sense than his interest had a few minutes before.
That was the heart of the obsession, of course. Nothing more and nothing less.
There was surely a snide edge to his words, sharp and sarcastic, a trait that he’d picked upon only recently and while I knew I was the sole suspect to blame, it still drove me crazy, and in a rush of muttered curse words and flushed faces and extremities, I snatched the blinds in both hands and pulled them tightly closed. My urgency and out of character embarrassment did little to stop Cas’s laughter of course, and he proceeded to mock me and my idiocy all while I threw on clean boxers and my usual uniform when traveling off to work: my “company-issued” pale blue button down, dark jeans, and the socks I found at the bottom of my drawer. I made an effort to ignore the deep, ocean eyes I knew were staring me down at that very moment, pretend as though their owner wasn’t in the same state of bareness I’d been in as I revealed myself to the world outside, but was failing miserably.
Maybe his generally overwhelming and extreme nature would serve as a good enough distraction from the insanity running marathons back and forth inside of my head. If it didn’t cease fire soon, I really could stroll straight into traffic.
“Heh...well…” He muttered, as if words were teasing the outskirts of his lips but none dared to pass the full way through. Instead, he settled on giving me a trying glance, a glance full of desperation and the call for help, and it felt like a blow to the stomach. What in the world was I supposed to say?
“Anyways...I feel like I owe you an apology. For being an asshole.”
– standing just where he wouldn’t expect, where he couldn’t quite see.
The last part of my response didn’t seem like it made much sense to Dean and he sent me a quizzical look, as though I was without any pants and undergarments, and I felt a flush of embarrassment color in my neck again with a harsh red and a lighter pink on my cheeks.
“Hey...uh, Cas…”
“A guy I met at the bar…”I stated, quite matter-of-factly, and then instantly played my sentence back in my head and grimaced. My dad, not understanding nor attempting to understand the magnitude of the conversation, threw his head back and laughed a laugh that used to drive me crazy.
it. Like it was…
“I believe you’re mistaken, Charlie,” I began rather desperately, struggling once again to control the tone of my own voice. “ I just recognize him from last week, that’s all…”
I think I cleared my throat. I can remember the scratching somewhere deep within my vocal chords and how the sound reverberated off of my chest, but not much of what came after it. I can recall the look in my brother’s eyes, their hazel hue full of desperation and the anger I’d made him swear to suppress, and if he thought for a second that I would be able to help him, he had another thing coming. I’d had every intention of keeping my mouth nearly sewn shut, cut off from every chance of confrontation, and upon arriving at my dad’s I’d thought Sam had the same intentions as well. The pleading gaze that was spilling forth from his irises, however, told me differently.
There was no space in my head to even consider any other attributes of Dean other than his troubles and the reasons behind his broken mind. I couldn’t enjoy the starkness of his cheekbones, the fire in his eyes, hot like the burn of whiskey that I struggled to down, his lean middle, or strong, fit legs because I was too busy imagining how heated the exchanges between him and his father were, imagining how it must’ve felt to be called useless by the one man who’s supposed to love you unconditionally, imagining what it’s really like to have beer bottles shatter at the walls around you, the walls that are supposed to make up your home.
Until recently, I hated the cold and everything that came with it: the snow piling on heavy atop my car, the heating bill, the layers upon layers of clothing I needed to wear just to walk a few feet outdoors, the like. Winter was always such a pain in the ass to me and I counted the days and weeks until it was over, rejoiced at the sight of green grass underneath the troublesome layers of white, and I wasn’t even that big of a fan of Christmas, partly because my family had never been very keen on celebrating it, but that was besides the point. Overall, the month of November all the way through the tail end of March were torturous for me, always had been.
“You came at least every three days, Dean. It was only a tradition for the first two weeks or so…”
“Geez man, I’m sorry,” Dean announced, startling me and crashing my train of thought. What in God’s name did Dean have to be sorry for?
My answer spelled out relief across his features, and I even watched as his hands unfolded and untangled, fraying out slightly and daring my forearms that were still perched against the bar, and I tried my best to act like his shifting had meant little to me, that I hadn’t noticed the shift of his position, but whatever reaction I had was too obvious and had alerted Dean. He smirked to himself, not daring to look up at who he was silently making fun of, and soon continued on his stories.
“Yeah...yeah Bobby, what’s up?” I replied.
I rolled my eyes and took a half step backwards, adjusting my position so I didn’t have to be under the all-knowing Bradbury gaze that made cautious chills run up and down my arms. She was implying something that was escaping me, or, more rather, something that I was avoiding at all costs. I could see its sheen and shimmer in her brightly colored irises, and it was very unnerving.
Dean’s outlook on the task ahead, the task of meeting his brother once more with his estranged father for the first time in two years, had increased in positivity, at least somewhat. Otherwise he wouldn’t have been so open with the worries and his nerves, regardless of whatever sort of mundane poison was running its course through his system. The relief of having let go of those pent up feelings could be seen in every crease of his skin, in every rise and fall of his chest, and in every quick, yet meaningful glance the two of us often caught ourselves in the middle of. It was an accomplishment that I allowed myself to feel pride in.
“Oh, my bad. I forgot, I brought them in earlier today,” She answered, strolling towards Kevin with the skip of victory in her step, grabbing her car keys, and advancing back into the kitchen with hardly a glance in our direction.
“Am I really that predictable?” He sighed, finally, and I felt like a balloon being deflated and all the worry blew into the wind.
“I’m sorry. I’m heading out.”
I’d touched down on his figure within seconds, tuning out the rest of the hustle and bustle around me, and watched him navigate through the large expanse of people and drink, making his way for the bar like he had exactly one week ago. It had been a torturous week, to say the least, full of tense waiting to see if the illusive Dean Winchester would show, mixed with an impending doubt that I was simply blowing his oddity and unusualness way out of proportion. But seeing him make his heavy, weighted way across the hardwood floor and flop himself into the barstool quickly eliminated those doubts and refueled that old sense of excitement that the seven days of wait had almost diminished entirely.
Gripping the dirty papers in one tentative hand, I was making my way over to the trash bin when it hit me. Dean Winchester was far more than passing scenery. While he did possess the odd quality all those before him did, it wasn’t an odd that I could understand. I knew he was broken, I knew his voice, with its rumble yet worrisome tremble, and I knew he wasn’t the kind to share parts of him or his life. I also knew his name, but nothing else. I didn’t even know whether or not there was a wife at home, pestering him about their damned kitchen appliance that needed repairing.

I had no more sarcastic grins, looks of exasperation, or frustrated sighs to give her at that point, and even if I had, she was out of the bar and into the kitchen at a speed I didn’t know she could reach. The need for escape was a very efficient motivator, I found out, more so than the need to combat, and I left her be to her own assumptions. I just hoped they didn’t get inside my own head too much and cloud my vision. I needed to be wholly focused on the task at hand and grasp the goal: learning all that there was to know about Dean Winchester.
“Like I said before, that’s not true. I’m just rather good at paying attention.”
“Told ya you guys were soulmates!”
it out of the blue and leave me fuckin’ high and dry. You just
"Good evening…what'll you have?"
Two lips, the shade of not-yet-bloomed tulips, turn to Dean. If he looks down, he sees a loose collar and an even looser tie, royal blue and twisted, framed by khaki lapels and undone enamel buttons. Beside the pair of lips are two sagging cheeks, signs of age inexplicable, dotted with brown stubble; atop the cheeks and to the right and left are ears that twitch upon impact, and Dean notices a slice running down one lobe. He remembers thumbing it and inquiring about its origin. The dam of tension swelling in Dean’s throat breaks.
“It’s the bartender. I guess I looked especially depressed the other night and he was askin’ me if I was alright ‘n stuff. You know, the typical bartender stuff,” I explained. “It’s a pretty nice place, has some damn good scotch, so I kept goin’ back and running into him. Nothing weird.”
“I care about you, and I want to make sure you’re alright and well because it doesn’t seem as though you have many other people in your life that do.”
“Will you be able to stop by today?” Cas eventually asked once he’d ceased chuckling and his amusement was reduced to nothing more than a small grin.
Within a few minutes she’d finished her piece and I left her to dwell in her own thoughts with another glass of wine. The look of exhaustion gave me reason to believe she was through telling the “stranger bartender” her “life’s problems.” I suppose she wasn’t much of a stranger to me, at that point in time, though my identity and life still eluded her. I liked to keep it that way.
I watched Dean’s reaction, gaging his willingness to answer, and felt my spirits raise as he opened his mouth to reply, eyes trained on my face, but panicked when they shifted focus. He was looking somewhere behind me, and a smirk of amusement was playing across his lips. I didn’t want to admit to myself what my theory was about what, or who, more rather, was the subject of his gaze.
Sam shouldn’t be there right now, he shouldn’t know that our dad was a drunk, he shouldn’t know about how shitty my life had been, or how I’d tried so hard to make sure his turned out better. He should be at Stanford and have the blurry faces of his brother and father in the back of his mind, taking up no more room than a distant, clouded memory, but instead he was there running his hands through his hair that I missed cutting and stressing out over all the things that I’d struggled to keep exclusively on my shoulders and my shoulders only.
In a flash of red hair, movement, and muttered curse words under her breath, Charlie dashed and grabbed me my trench coat, and I think I was beginning to catch on. But if I went outside, what was I supposed to do?
lied to him. But, shit…I…I still wanted it. All the time. When we were together. Apart. When I wanted to kick in your goddamn shins. When I wanted to…to search the damn planet for you. It was still there, but I can’t have it. So I push it down. And I thought that the longer it stayed down, the less it…the less
CASTIEL
“Nah, nah...you guys brought this shit up,” Dad continued. Bobby’s hands were now pressed on his chest, pushing him backwards and trying to ease him back into his seat, and the scene playing out in front of was like scrolling through photo albums of old family memories.
Background noise.
“Eight o’clock okay? I got an appointment at quarter to eight, shouldn’t take much longer than that, and I’m sure you can handle it.”
“Don’t act like you’re actually pissed about it, man,” I sneered, a little meanly, but Cas got the point and rolled his sparkling eyes and I fought hard not to get lost in them, in their embodiment of all things warm and safe and gentle. Besides, there was a dull beep ringing from the opposite corner of the bed, my assigned corner, and it was officially eight o’clock. Cas was the first to remark about the time, as usual.
The contrast of my co-worker’s voice versus the one I was remembering in my head was sudden and startled me slightly, causing me to nearly drop the shot glass that I’d resumed cleaning after my time with the heartbroken, suburban-scandal woman had ended. Thankfully, my clumsiness didn’t strike me down again and had mercy, allowing me to place the glass safely under the bar and to turn around to face the source of the contrasting voice. This one was much more lively, airborne, and I enjoyed hearing it, despite the times its sudden appearance created rather embarrassing situations.
“Eh, I don’t know...I just haven’t seen the guy in a while. He’s probably changed a ton, gotten into different stuff, the works,” he admitted, slowly but surely, similar to an animal being gingerly let out of a cage. I was just weary of the instant where he decided to snap at me. In hopes of preventing such an event, I refrained my speaking anymore, and let Dean continue at his own pace. I watched his face darken at its own pace, as well, and the swell in my chest grew deeper.
“Just making sure you were alright. You seem distressed.”
“Sammy and I have always been different, really, really different,” he started to explain, a distant, nostalgic gleam glowing along his face, before it converted back into the darkness. “He was about schoolwork, books, gettin’ those straight A’s and being the best kid he could possibly be. He was entirely self-driven, did all the work for himself, no one told ‘em to. I, well, I wasn’t like that.”
“No...no...just got in a run this morning, that’s all.” It seemed believable until I said it and I was immediately wincing at my diminished lying skills. I blamed Cas and his forever innocent ways for corrupting me, and yes I realize how little sense that makes.
He tapped the temple of his head with his knuckle, belonging to the hand that was clutching his glass, and before long he’d spilled a large amount of his drink on his already soiled, light blue sweater. I didn’t laugh, merely tossed him a clean rag I kept under the bar and left him to his own devices, creepy giggles, and slurs of Jesus Christ and the clergy.
“Were you unsure of whether or not he’d be accepted?”
“I’m just saying that you’re showing a lot of interest in this Dean guy, which, again, is understandable, and that maybe it couldn’t hurt to keep at it? You know, get to know him from his family all the way down to whether his right or left handed, his favorite color...the good stuff.”
I chalked up my passiveness and lack of will to the exhaustion I was feeling, like a weight tied to my ankles that slowed me down with every step I trudged through, and the burning of my eyelids told me I’d certainly overworked myself. Even my head, which was more often than not buzzing at an unhealthy rate of seventeen miles anyway, seemed bogged down, sleepy, and drained, throbbing with the excess information it had been stuffed with that night. But no matter how helpful it would’ve been to expel some of it, I didn’t. I just couldn’t. Especially not when the newly acquired anecdotes and stories had been told to me through the words of Dean Winchester.
Sam flung the bottle in my dad’s face, waving it just under his upturned and flaming red nose, as though he was wafting the fumes into his nose in generous helpings. John Winchester didn’t even flinch and remained unblinking, stiff like a soldier.
It was nothing short of a difficult task, trying to pass off the sentence as nothing more than common courtesy. There was just an unidentifiable something about Dean Winchester that lead me to believe he wasn’t one for saying thank you often, and there was no denying the warmth it brought. I had a hard time picturing the feeling being purely one-sided.
I swallowed hard, my eyes falling to some unidentifiable place on the floor as to avoid anymore staring. Was I really that transparent?
“Hah...yeah. That’s how pubs ‘n restaurants usually work, right?”
, I don’t…this can’t be real…”
I thought my statement had driven the point home well, strong, and true, and left no room for error or retaliation. I should’ve planned better though, knowing Charlie’s knack for debate and always being correct in situations similar to the painful one I was trapped in, and she still shocked me with her reply. Her reply blew me backwards, into next week, and into a defeated sort of submission.
“Anytime, dude,” Charlie replied and then quickly continued on her journey to the point of the conversation, a journey that was typically long and a little tiring on the listener’s part, but in that moment I wished that she would take all the time in the world.
I gave Kevin a nod of acknowledgement, a little crestfallen that I wouldn’t be seeing my friend for a few more hours when she typically arrived at two minutes past six, no more no less, but I was also worried about sticking it out with Kevin Tran. Though I did enjoy his company, since being in the pub without anyone to talk to besides those in the kitchen wasn’t something I liked, his constant worried mumblings, remarks, and jumpiness made it hard to bond with him. I hoped it was his nervous nature and not my lack of people skills that made it challenging.
In a barely there instance I saw his eyes flick towards his empty glass and I dashed for the bottle of scotch, conveniently located just nearby where the two of us were stationed, and poured its substance into the glass with fumbling fingers and an acutely focused ear. Because something was surely possessing Dean; he was explaining.
“It’s
And there is so much to look forward to now, all because of that one person giving me the necessary edge to get up and make something of myself. All because the soft around the edges, light-speaking, gentle, sometimes gauche yet always inexplicably intuitive man behind the bar had taken an interest in me. All because seeing his smiling, easy going, and forever soothing face was expected, normal, and I could look forward to it at end of each day without fail, without any screaming matches or nerves or anxieties of any sort. No strings attached; he was a different kind of family.
“I mean...I’m happy about it, I guess. It’ll be nice to see him again after so long but…”
“Cas, listen, I need to –”
“We are closing,” I admitted, motioning towards the wall clock above both of our heads with a wave of my head. Dean’s eyes followed lazily.
The doorbell rang and he was gone, taking the light and the warmth and the joy of the night along with him and I had the sudden urge to collapse inward on myself. I’d lost something there, that was for certain, and I couldn’t fight the worry I had about his state of mind and his safety in getting home. Nothing was playing out right and it all had collapsed in just a mere couple of minutes. The night had been going so well and then time had to catch up and then I had to be too awkward to understand that maybe Dean had wanted things, whatever they were,to progress just half a step further, and now I was lonely and concerned and lost.
“He blamed me for Sam leaving for college.”
The young woman smiled, a smile full of submission and emulating an injured spirit, and I felt it rather challenging to meet her gaze, especially when I knew there wasn’t much I could do to ease her pain.
“There’s no need to apologize. We’re open until one AM, and anyone can come through within those hours as they please.”
And like I said, I hadn't failed. I knew or could know everyone I came in contact with. Broken hearts, broken families, broken minds, broken homes, and broken lives alike, I understood it all…
The Sunday night crowd was one that I enjoyed, to say the least. While they were far more predictable than the Thursday nighters, it was an odd collage of personalities and characters that, unless one worked in a position similar to mine, many would not expect to see at such a place like a bar. Congregations of holy figures of all sorts flooded the doors, escaping after the last of the “Lord’s day” gatherings had finished. They were never rowdy, never rude, never too loud but never too awkwardly quiet and respectful.
Soon after his arrival, the chatter and the clinking resumed without further interruptions and the sudden air of tension blew away for a short while. I believe the old woman continued on her whiskey-fueled rant about dirty dishes, but I was a little too occupied with the man walking steadily towards the bar. His jacket, unzipped with a plain tee shirt underneath, the collar lowly cut to reveal a small portion of his tan chest area, covering his middle, flopped back and forth with each step he took, and each one of those steps carried purpose, much more purpose than the usual bar crawlers possessed. But, in all honesty, any purpose at all was more than what they had.
“I think you’ve got the wrong idea here, Charlie…”
“But he left, and I’ve barely heard from him since,” he continued, after seeing I was in no position to reply or interrupt his piece. I was too intent on listening to it in full.
He paused, but the pause was too short for me to act upon, and he who created the conversation’s lull beat me to it.
“That was two months ago, Dean.”
“Just by two minutes, I’m not dying or anything.”
Empathy, Castiel. Empathy is important.
“Good to know, lovebird.”
But Cas redefined the expanse of such words, the worth of the phrase, the power its confirmation holds over them both. Dean wants to take a stab at it.
I needed to change the subject. I reached under the bar for the reserved bottle of scotch, fought the urge to jump at the coldness of its surface, because apparently my hands had grown hot and sweaty within the conversation, and reached to retrieve Dean’s empty glass that lingered just outside of his reach. I could feel him watch me as I did so, his lack of protest giving me the go-ahead, and I poured. I poured slowly and listened to the noise, hoping it would drown out the heaviness of Dean’s breathing and the drum-like beat of my own blood through my veins.
“I do appreciate the rescue,” I chuckled, a little dryly, because my eyes and general attention didn’t want to focus on anything.
I’d completely failed him, and I couldn’t take their current screaming that served as a constant reminder of that.
Charlie rolled her eyes, twinkling blue lighting up with the gleam of mischief and mocking that was sure to come quickly after. “I recognize at least three people from last week that are here right now, but you don’t see me going all googly-eyed for them. You’re into him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I’d forgotten!
“Wait, I really should call a cab, you’re in no condition to drive.”
“But I was your favorite regular, right?”
“I don’t need to hear them. I…I just know.” Cas sighs. “I’m relieved to have you alive, Dean. You can just leave it at that.”
“If there’s always something, that something must be especially severe today. You’re...very aggravated.”
I heard my own footsteps creak their way across the rickety hardwood floor as I approached the door, and I pretended like my dad’s shrieks of rage were nothing more than Sam’s cartoons buzzing around in the back of my head, background noise to an equally as somber, defeated scene.
Yet, before my heart could collapse entirely and before I could ruin the moment for the second time over, Dean’s brain made one last coherent, intelligent decision and moved in the best way he possibly could: closer.
“It’s not your fault, Cas. I got my hopes up. Thought maybe things woulda been different, that we had some kinda chance at fixin’ things,” he said, deflecting my consolation.
“If my theory about soulmates is correct then...no. They never did. Maybe they thought they did, but it wasn’t real.”
I walked out.
“Well you may want to look into it. I can see it in your eyes K.C.-er, Carter-”
“Nah, you strike me as the person that remembers things, remembers people. You wouldn’t enjoy listening to them so much if you didn’t.”
“Was it...okay? Were things well?” It was a waste of words, but I hoped it would convey that I cared.
I highly doubted my father had met someone quite like Castiel Novak. There was no way in hell he’d gotten onto good terms with the socially awkward, fantastically observant, and just plain old gentle blue-eyed, dark haired bartender who appeared to have some inexplicable interest in listening to my problems. I couldn’t imagine my own dad confessing more about his life to this stranger-become-circumstantial friend than he ever had to anyone who wasn’t there to experience it firsthand along with him, and I couldn’t imagine this someone could’ve taken it as well as Castiel Novak did with me. It was impossible that my own father had felt the same way I had when Cas had spoken such heartfelt words to me, the way my own blood-pumper had increased its speed tenfold, or that my dad could’ve thought about his eyes or the funny, forever curious expression that appeared on his face every waking hour.
“Dude, seriously?”
“Just...making a generalization, Castiel.”
“I always have a feeling.”
Background noise.
I guess, in the end, my shirt-tucking job didn’t mean much, since I would have to redo it anyways momentarily, and my mind was very far from its state as a few shameful sighs were pushed from somewhere deep within my throat, a place that wasn’t supposed to make noise in the first place, as familiar fingers snaked their way underneath my button down’s fabric. They latched onto whatever skin they could find, sending goosebumps up my chest and back down my arms, and Cas’s breath still was reminiscent of the alcohol from the previous night, sharp and overwhelming to not only the taste but to the touch, and I wondered if it was still affecting his train of thought and logic.
“Had I not walked in on them...on them...you know, doing that, I would’ve been under the impression that he was willing, too!”
Just like that, my throat began to close up, I was feeling lightheaded, and my knees were wobbling just like they’d been less than twenty-four hours ago when Dean, apparently the newly brought up topic of conversation, had been so keen to be kind to me. I must’ve stared at Kevin, wide-eyed and full of disbelief, betrayal even, though I wondered how he could betray me without knowing that I’d been fighting fiercely to keep Dean’s name from Charlie, for a good forty-five seconds before realizing his dark, brown eyes were trained elsewhere. My despair and inner turmoil went unnoticed.
“You guys were really busy tonight, hm?” He asked, arching his neck upwards so we could speak face-to-face.
“Well, how are you supposed to know if the love is real or not?” I asked, now off-handedly as I scanned the pub for the object of my earlier search, the object of my distraction during the suburban lady’s saddening story. I couldn’t have missed it, could I? The thought sent worried, stressed chills up and down my exposed arms.
I soon regained my stance and stuffed the keys into my pants' pocket as my boss gave me one last wave of a goodbye and disappeared out the back door, leaving me nearly completely alone in the almost vacant pub. The only other presences I was sharing oxygen with were the last of those rather strange, cult-invested men and the mystery man stationed a few feet away, and the others were just about to walk out the door. In a matter of moments it would be the mystery man and myself.
I rolled my eyes, but the gesture possessed that same kind of sweetness his inquiries did, before replying,
I've made an executive decision to post this a day early because I've had it completed for a long time now and I won't be home much tomorrow, so I hope that's alright with whoever's reading. I also want to give another thank you for the uplifting words and support so far. It may not seem like much to seem, but the amount of time I've spent giggling over your comments and kudos is almost foolish.
“Fuck, Cas…”
“What’ll you have?”
“What, leading a religious life has never crossed your mind? I don’t believe it!”
So, was he to hold his own teeth responsible, given their current state? How could they keep back the lies when gurgles of ichor bubbled in his throat and stained their whitish enamel rubicund?
“You can’t hear prayers in the Empty.”
I did find one in the form of a lesson, a lesson that a certain redhead had taught me seven whole days ago about how one is supposed to know when they’ve come in contact with the person they’re meant to spend the rest of their lives. I thought of the eye locking, the heart stopping, and all the cheesy, painfully juvenile aspects she’d taunted me with in an attempt to bring color to my cheeks and a smile of achievement to her face. It looked as though she would be succeeding, twice.
A rule in bartending that I tried to uphold very strongly was that the newcomers must be served before the older ones were refilled, and often times it was difficult to follow such a ruling since my goal for each night was getting to know at least three people, and that required long periods of uninterrupted attention, but that night was already shaping up to be drastically different. I had little to no trouble abandoning the storyteller, whose hip I felt painfully attached to, and exchanging him for the familiar face at the end of the bar. It felt as though a strange sense of obligation was pulling me towards him, towards whatever clouds of whatever was plaguing his life were hanging over his drooping head, and I was in no position to resist. I didn’t want to resist.
wanted, I mean – is here. It’s always been here. But I get
“They would just scream at each other, not agreeing about anything. He had plans, places to go, but my dad was so adamant in staying together, ya know? We were a family, we stuck together, and leaving for ‘fucking college’ was the same as abandoning your family in his eyes. But Sammy had worked his ass off for it, and wasn’t about to let it all go to waste, so he left. Hasn’t looked back since.”
“I’m glad you give me haircuts though, Dean. I don’t think Dad would be really good at them. Not like you are.”
“Sam,” I stated plainly. “His brother’s name is Sam.”
Snip-snip. Two thin locks of hair cascading to the motel floor below, which was covered in spare garbage bags I’d scrounged up, as I scrambled to find an answer.
My lack of understanding in regards to  John Winchester’s intentions and methods in which he decided to carry them out prohibited me from speaking much more than a few stammered, broken syllables, so I discarded the more vocal of my options and hoped that the remaining one would suffice. Trying my hardest to convey my willingness to understand, my willingness to listen, I stared on down to Dean with a softened gaze and a face free of judgment. He needed to confess things, and maybe it was the brushing of our knuckles against each other for the second time that night, or maybe he finally trusted me enough to allow me to be his shoulder, his crutch, his source of support that took on whatever form he needed, I don’t know, but the very muscles in his face relaxed, and so did my nerves.
I didn’t dwell on the phrasing “used to” for very long in fear of getting irreparably distracted. Instead,  I listened to the next question Dean had lined up to fire my way and busied myself with lining up my defenses, making sure they were as airtight as possible.
“I’m not sure what you mean,” I replied. It was my first line of defense.
“Why do you need to keep him busy?” I retorted, and the lack of necessity invested in the statement was enough to choke on. I knew just why she’d done what she did.
Thanks to everyone for the support, and I hope I've pleased you thus far!
There were so many possible buts. There were so many scenarios that could play out, so many things that could end his sentence, so many possible sources of his intensified anger, and so little time for me to choose an option and form a strategy around it. All I could was stand, lean forward, and stare at his castaway eyes and make note of the freckles dotting the bridge of his nose and the pink skin just underneath his cheeks, wonder what the source was, and feel my curiosity boil over into something I could no longer contain.
“It’s not the most enjoyable of experiences. I have four older brothers, Michael, Raphael, Lucifer, and Gabriel, and none of them are easy personalities to swallow.”
“He’s so far gone that he doesn’t even remember so much of what’s happened…”Dean had murmured in the middle of his recounting of his most recent family reunion. “Sam was literally right there tellin’ him that what I was saying was right and it was like he’d shut everything that he didn’t wanna hear out.”
“Don’t you guys close up ‘round 1 o’clock ‘er somethin’?” he reminded me, slurring slightly over his words.
Sam is a puddle on the floor. His jeans are flecked with hay and the ichor of the decapitated vampires. There’s a bruise forming on his chin that spreads into the age lines on his right cheek, lines that Dean hadn’t noticed yet. Sam is collapsed and staring in reverence at two rectangular legs flanked in thin black fabric and shoes scuffed at the toes, but only recently.
Dean, again, wasn’t satisfied by my answer and substituted it with his own without any sort of filter or thought as to what he was truly saying.
But I was terrified and I could hardly feel nor move my limbs.
“He’s very troubled, really,” I replied, being perfectly honest and wishing she wouldn’t dwell further.
She did sound oddly serious, and as if the current swell of emotions I was undergoing wasn’t enough already, she had to go and add more confusion to the mix. Why were my thoughts on Dean Winchester so vitally important to them, and what did she really expect to find within them?
But, damn it to hell or wherever he was being fast-tracked to, he’d snuck glances. He’d ventured beyond the walls. He’d let the warmth linger, the kind you can’t find elsewhere, the kind they manufacture “upstairs” but, even then, a special kind of it. He’d peered in between the windowpanes and stuck his fingers out between the cracks, pining until he remembered his job. His duty. His lies.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean mumbled suddenly. It was so strange to see him so talkative, the new personality brought on by his choice of beverages, but I appreciated it then. It made his persona and general makeup much easier to decipher in that time of urgency.
I’d met several mechanics and car junkies over the years. Their outward appearance was always rather predictable: unkempt hair, neckbeards of some sort, tired eyes, and very able hands. Their movements were often heavy, but they approached most everything as if it were a problem that could be fixed with a little bit of elbow grease and sweat. This included conversations with me, because whenever they were asked a trying question they dissected it, examined it, and tried to find the best route of repair. Most often they were just trying to repair their egos.
“You don’t even know what I’m gonna say,” Dean retorts as a tear spills across his lip. Salty.
He looked absolutely miserable, as if all the spark and intoxicating energy he’d possessed less than twenty-four hours before had abandoned him, and it worried me. It worried me sick, rendered me shaking to the point where the walk to his end of the pub was much more laborious than it should’ve been, and cut off my imperative ability to speak. So, as a consequence, I found myself standing, board-like, with my hands pinned at my sides and my mouth slightly parted with unspoken words and beads of embarrassment, now turned into sweat, running down my forehead. It was the first time all night that the enclosed space, mass amounts of people, and increased body heat had started getting to me.
And with that, Kevin gripped Charlie’s keys in his forever-shaking hand and walked, half backwards, towards the rear entrance of the pub, shooting me uncertain, partially guilty, and all-together confused looks as he went. No amount of desperation or soundless pleading from me could convince him to stay, it seemed like, and I was forced to simply listen to the sound of his fading footsteps until the back door had closed and Charlie’s vision immediately flicked onto my still form, the gaze so heated that I had to turn away.
Judging by the way he was teasing me, he wouldn’t be mourning the loss much and would probably be spending the hours of my absence in pajamas and in and out of naps. Soon my free hand found its way into his hair, but he knew better. I was distracted too easily, got carried away at the drop of a pin, at the brief press of lips, and he was right: work existed and needed me there at the top of the next hour.
Sam said it was a great idea, and that he couldn’t wait to see me in one of “those black kinda-dresses that haircutters tie around their waists,” meaning aprons, and scampered off to find something to watch on TV. With his giggling form went the last of my good spirits and the last bits of any optimism I had though, and the scattered, broken sounds of his cartoons served as irritating background noise as I cleaned up the mess his hair had made across the bathroom floor.
I watched as Dean’s hand rose high into the air, and as he used the other to support himself on the doorframe, and he waved to me with an air of such casual departure that it nearly drove me mad. I felt like a piece of me was being severed while he was about to stumble drunkenly out of the door without so much as a care in the world. And yet, I could only gaze on and replicate the gesture of carefreeness. Of friendship.
The door’s bell rang obnoxiously loud when I entered and the scrubbing co-worker ceased his intense cleaning to look up at who’d arrived, eyes alive with minor a startling fading from his large pupils. I would’ve felt a twinge of guilt for frightening him, but it was nearly a daily occurrence and my sympathies simply for his personality had long since run out.
“I had to let him go. I had to let him move on, or he’d be wasting all that craziness he has in his head. I had to give him the chance that I never had. Hell, I wanted him to go so badly for himself that I couldn’t stand it and for once in my goddamn life I didn’t think about what you would say. I thought about Sammy, entirely.”
“All the way down to how their hearts stop in the chest, just for a moment,” her hands fluttered to her chest, like she was weak with the emotions being described, and fluttered her eyes in an attempt to look faint with love. It earned a small bout of laughter from the two of us, but there was no denying her belief in the concept of soulmates. While I found it rather trivial, outlandish even, I didn’t want to rain to harshly on her parade, and I still wanted to know more.
“You just happen to be that unbiased ‘shoulder to lean on?’”
“I’ve been shitty to you. I’ve been…unsure. And I didn’t mean for it to screw you over. I never meant that. It was
"Ay, Castiel, can you lock up for the night?" He asked me, removing a loud pair of keys from his jeans' pocket and jingling them in his hand as he awaited my response. I wasn't entirely sure what he thought I would say, however, seeing as though I didn't have much of a choice.
“Dean,” I began, shocked at how loud the sincerity in my voice was, but not at its presence. “Stop apologizing so much. It...it really can help to let these things out, and its no good keeping them bottled up.”
“Oh, you’re obligated to say that. But I do appreciate you listening,” She answered, yet I watched yet again as another wave of hysterics took over. She placed her head in her hands before exclaiming,
“Some, but not enough,” I admitted to my wide-eyed interviewer, who had ceased her scrubbing to send me an inquisitive yet mostly concerned stare.
“It was you who screwed up Dean. I told you to never ever ever let Sam outta your sight, ‘n now he’s halfway across the country all the time and I’m stuck with you! I didn’t mess up, it was your one fuckin’ job. You did this, Dean, you-”
I was instantly lost as to what her intentions were and where I was supposed to follow her words. Where in the world had that come from? Never had there been a time in the years that I’d know Charlie Bradbury where I had ever been truly upset or angry with her; I’d thought such a emotion was impossible to direct her way. Yes, there was the occasional episode where her pestering made its way just centimeters under my skin, caused a little itch of annoyance, and sometimes I did roll my eyes at her forgetfulness when it came to placing the supply closet keys in random places, and her sneaky methods of getting out of closing up shop weren’t ideal, but everything’s frustration put together wouldn’t even equal the irritation a papercut caused. Charlie was lovely, always.
I swallowed hard, hoping to remove some of the pain sputtering outward from somewhere in my throat, probably the dryness caused from my poor night, and shook my head slowly to avoid activating my headache from that morning and, unfortunately yet predictably, I wasn’t very successful.
“Evenin’.” Dean announced with a small dip of his head while the corners of his lips pushed further into the red of his cheeks, the change in color obviously brought on by the chilled weather, and I watched for but a moment as he rubbed his sturdy hands together in an attempt to keep them warm. I didn’t even have a satisfactory amount of time to marvel at the fact that he’d been the first one to speak, and had done so voluntarily.
“John, you’re talkin’ a boat-load ah nonsense,” Bobby insisted, finally catching Dad’s eyes and sending him a forbidding, dangerous look, though my father wasn’t in the state of mind to properly receive it. “Just shut up before you say somethin’ that you’ll regret, okay?”
“And that’s cool. It’s what you do, and you’re pretty damn good at it!” She continued, making note of my change in attitude and making a change in her own tone of voice. It was gentler now and easier to listen to, its mocking sting gone.
No amount of plans to become a cosmetologist or complements on my apparently commendable hairstyling skills could make me feel better or less guilty about lying. I hated lying to Sam about where our father was and what he was truly doing, or that he’d rather be here with us eating pancakes at backwater restaurants we found on the way from motel to motel. Dad told me his work traveled. By age eleven, I knew for sure that his spirit, attention span, and slim chances at being happy again were the things that traveled, and Sam knew this by age eight.
Dean is gripping Castiel’s collar before his mind catches up. The texture is known, almost soothing, so when Cas tilts his head once again, a dreadful realization dawning on his features, Dean squeezes. It’s firm. Concrete. Fair. Both Dean and Cas clench their teeth.
I have to physically s-p-e-a-k, if I want to really know what his point is, I reminded myself.
I dipped my head, not in a prideful way, but one of relief and acknowledgement. I’d done my job for the night.
It wasn’t in a hail of bullets. It wasn’t blazing. Nor was it glorified. Dean was crying as he died, a chunk of his final lie laying at his feet. Sam probably couldn’t see it quivering through the tears, but Dean only knew through intuition. His own sight was reduced now to a myriad of colors, shapes, pieces of a story warped beyond recognition. The broken piece of deceit lay like a kicked dog beside Dean’s left shoe, and he had half a mind to throttle it awake as his life’s last hurrah, at least until he spent his last breath heaving a sob through his fractured chest, shattering the illusion to pieces.
“Everything alright, Castiel?”
“Are there more of them? Usually vampires congregate in immense numbers. You know this, of course. I counted seven in the barn alone. We should check out the premises before –”
So as Dean finished throwing back the second swig of his drink, closing his eyes lightly shut at he did so, my feet carried me forward, my hands propped themselves up on the bar, and a voice came out of my own mouth. It took me a great deal of time to realize that it was my own, instantly feeling shocked at my own courage.
He nodded, and then added once I was halfway out the door and almost successful in my departure,
The actions that followed my dad’s final, closing arguments are still, to this day, a blur of shouts, beer, and the rush to grab my coat and leave.
My rather draining thoughts and theories were temporarily cut short, however, when my boss appeared from somewhere in the kitchen and walked behind the bar, face a little sweaty and an apron spotted with brown and an unsettling yellow tied around his waist, and signaled to me with a wave of his hand.
“I am serious, Dean. There’s nothing wrong with trying...no one can blame you for doing so. Your father is your family and there’s no changing that. I’m sure, underneath it all, he cares for you very deeply.”
And that’s where I found myself now: sitting in my apartment and debating whether or not I had the energy to shower that night while my insides were still mildly frozen from the rainstorm, or wait until tomorrow morning in fear of the warm water droplets drifting me off into sleep while I was in the middle of bathing. Eventually I did choose the latter and changed out of my day clothes in a sleepy sort of fashion, and the only part of me that seemed to be awake and functioning was my mind, and it was busy replaying the scenes from that night.
I opened my mouth to speak, to say something that would not only calm the storm that had just started to rain down between the three of us, but ease my own nerves and hopefully deflate the sickening grin of correctness that was painting itself wide and true across Charlie’s front. Unfortunately, despite her change in emotion and obvious excitement, my redheaded opponent beat me to the punch and got the first word in.
