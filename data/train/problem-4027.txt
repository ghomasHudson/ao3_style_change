And then Castiel does hang up.
"Neither did I."
"Cas."
And it stings Dean right in the gut.
But something feels a miss.
Castiel needs to ask Dean. He needs answers. And there's only one person who can give them. Dean himself.
"Good boy," Dean keened, and Castiel felt his cock throb with the need to be touched. He knew however, Dean wouldn't touch it or even spare it a glance, and with his hands tied, Castiel couldn't reach it either. It hung erect and leaking and slapped against his stomach each time Dean thrust into him. Soon, however, as Castiel felt himself teeter at the edge of the orgasm, and let out a loud, pleading whine, he felt Dean's thrusts turn sporadic, and Dean's grip loosened on his hips.
"Here," he says, and pulls Castiel back, who goes willingly, trying to follow Dean and appease him, and Dean can see his eyes are filled with intent and curiosity, "-let me lie back down." Dean sits back on the bed and shuffles around until he's seated comfortably among the pillows, then he reaches a hand out to guide Castiel, who confused as it is, crawls over the bed, and Dean pulls him into his lap until Castiel is straddling his hips.
"So delicious," Dean growled, the low timbre of his voice sending pleasure straight down to Castiel's gut.
"Where we're safe. Where you come home to me each night, no bruises on your face," Castiel's fingers run down the blue marks under Dean's eye, and he winces, "- where nothing can hurt us."
"With you."
Yep. Castiel could have almost come again.
"Even if we had all the time in the world, it would never be enough for us. But twelve hours is what we have. What we gotta’ work with. We'll make it work, won't we?"
"Yup. That's the one. That's the one she used. What does it mean?"
"Is there a cure to the curse?"
"Meh."
Blue laughs and for a moment, Dean envisages round, baby blue eyes, twinkling with mirth as they stare up at him.
"Oh? Name one," Castiel says, stepping back and crossing his arms against his chest, raising an eyebrow in a challenge, and Dean sighs.
"Winchester," he grumbles.
Dean didn't like his gift. No, he hated it. Dean was angry at Cas.
scent from miles away. But the questions remained. Why did his condo smell like coffee at half-past midnight?
"Because I
"Pretty angel, spicy tongue. I like it. Shit, I love it."
"Stay, please, five more minutes."
"I guess I do. Try being the youngest, gay sibling in conservative Christian family. It's as if everyone around me, everyone except me, has their life sorted. My eldest brother, he's the vice-president of some I.T company. Wife, two kids. He's got it all. My elder sister is a paediatrician. An accountant husband, a little kid- she's set in life. And then there's me, trying to make ends meet with my salary, not to mention my student loans, and then there's the rent, the commute, and a love life? I don't even know what that is. I tried Grindr once. Don't think I've seen so many shirtless men at once in my life before. And not a single
"Hey, hey, we have time for now, right?"
"Ah, because I'm not. Trust me, I ain't even touched forty yet."
"Hey, you could have told me, man, I was worried sick."
"Kids, Cas. Two of them."
A silence lulls in the air and Dean fears the conversation will end sooner than he'd like it to. This guy, Blue, he sounds cool. Like a guy you could share a couple beers with, sit with under the stars, and talk about life, and the universe.
"That's certainly very dedicated, Mr.Green. But I believe there's something from your side, a promise, you have yet to fulfil."
"Yeah?"
"Please, faster, alpha, harder— I won't break—" Castiel pleaded, and Dean paced up his thrusts, at last, feeling the familiar swell of his knot popping at the base of his cock. His eyes fell shut and his mind flashed white— pure instincts guided him, and every instinct inside him begged him to breed, mate, to copulate, to protect and to satisfy his omega.
A long beat passes between them, until Castiel speaks up again, mirth lingering in his voice.
Saturday. When morning comes, he'll be leaving. He wants to speak to Castiel, he
"You free?" he asks.
Castiel chuckles, and rests his cheek against Dean's shoulder.
, he reassures himself,
"Don't leave, please," Castiel whimpers, his voice hoarse, almost helpless, "– Dean, don't leave."
Three words.
Dean hisses, and shakes his head. "I can't, Rowena, I can't think of the words."
Castiel nods. Dean watches his angel lie down again, his hands over his chest, over that rumpled white formal shirt with its buttons undone at the top. The sight reminds Dean, he should probably get Castiel some comfortable clothes. He's sure Castiel will fit into some of his shirts, and most likely his shorts, although it's hard to say since Castiel does have broader hips than Dean, and thicker thighs than Dean's. Nevertheless, Dean makes a mental note to get that done as soon as Rowena concludes her spell.
Dean gulps.
?" Dean asked, waving a hand between the two of them.
"Who would love me, Blue? You think anyone is going to want to love someone like me?"
Dean doesn't answer, but his eyes linger on Castiel longer than he knows they're supposed to. When he finally caves in, he can't help the wide grin that unfurls on his lips.
"I'm sorry," Castiel whispered, for lack of better words.
"Yes."
"Mr. Winchester, aren't you going to eat me?"
"You're welcome."
"What? You're a virgin?"
A pause lingers between them, neither men speaking as the words dissolve into the air, hanging uncertain between them. The verse thrums under Castiel’s skin, and the moment his eyes slip shut, he can only envisage a sound, no, a voice, Dean’s voice. With a soft gasp, he blinks his eyes open, breath shallow as he glances down at the book, at the wall, and back down to the book.
"Yeah. She. I mean, it was dad's car, y'know, back in the day when he was in his peak, getting the girls, riding with the boys, but then, when I turned twenty, dad gave it over to me. She's a classic, Cas, a classic. You gotta’ see her. She means so much to me."
Dean doesn't expect Castiel to answer in the blink of an eye.
"Oh no, that would be Lucifer."
"Nope. Math was meh. English was cool, we drifted off topic, ended up debating about diversity in late nineties literature."
"Remember the witch hunt we went on last week? In Colorado?"
"Does that feel good, your highness? Should I stop?"
" Castiel pauses, eyes burning with tears as he clamps his hands over his face, burying it in the warmth of his palms as a soft hiccup rises at the back of his throat.
A groan, and then, the man speaks up again.
"Well, what do I call you then?" the man asks.
sure it hit you? And
When Castiel finally allowed himself to drink in the interior of the manor, he found himself absolutely captivated and rooted to the ground, unable to move a single inch.
"Ah man, I wish we could talk right now."
"Because," he starts, his lips trembling, words shaky and hoarse, "-because you're the thing I love the most, Cas."
Castiel's sucked in a breath, pushing his face into the pillow underneath him, breathing in the scent of pure
A pause, and Castiel stops squirming, going lax in Dean's arms, before sniffling, and pressing his face to Dean's neck.
Second of all, I'd like to thank my beta reader
"Her name's Lisa Braeden. She transferred here last week."
before his nickname. Of course, they’re well past the formalities now; it’s been almost a month since they struck up their peculiar friendship.
to break Castiel. Benny was slurring about catching up with Dean, but Castiel couldn't be less bothered. He pushed himself off the love-seat, and turned to walk away, when a hand— broad and familiar, grabbed his wrist, and Castiel paused.
"Oh," She smiled, and her shoulders relaxed, "-I've got some pills with me if you want, but I'm not sure if you'd want them."
Dean laughed.
Lisa smiled at that, but she remained silent, simply spectating.
"M-master—" Castiel mumbled, "-I thought you'd come on my face," He said, and reached behind to dip two fingers into the gush of come leaking down his cute, catboy asshole. Dean sighed, before pulling his catboy into his arm, finding Castiel's teary, big, round blue eyes blinking up at him, a small pout on his face.
towards the empty, accent wall of the room, beside which he is standing.
"Dean," Castiel says, all at once, and all three eyes in the room shift onto him. He flutters his eyes open from where he's lying down, and glances up at Dean. Their eyes meet, and it's almost as if something within Castiel's eyes is calling for Dean, and the revelation startles Dean for a moment.
"You do, but it's better if you choose the one that takes you home."
“I’m not worth what you feel for me. I can hear
Castiel had laughed at that, answering, voice casual,
"Fine, whatever,” the man on the other side of the wall says. “But hold on, you enlisted at twenty-one? No offense, but why would you do something like that at such a tender age?"
It was as large as a forearm, wide and thick, and the girth of it was ridged with thick, bursting veins. The tip was a rosy, flesh coloured, while the rest or the length had a faint green tinge to it. Hanging before Castiel's ass, Dean's cock was
"Cas, sweetheart, please, I'm trying so hard to just, not think about it, okay? Trust me, I'm a hundred times madder about this than you can imagine, so let's not talk about it at all."
"Dean, please, no—" Castiel's wails rung through the room, and he fought against the ropes binding him, but in vain, as Dean bit his nipple again as punishment, and smirked with a lewd grin on his face, his lips tinged with red blood. Between his sobs, Castiel's eyes fell upon Dean's trousers, where he could see, crystal clear— the straining bulge at the front.
"I love you too."
"Dean, stop—" Castiel whines, finding himself reduced to a powerless child as he tries to grab Dean's arm, but curse his husband's aim and strength, because Dean never allows him the chance to counter him when he grabs Castiel by the wrists and twists them behind Castiel's back, holding onto them single-handedly while his other hand runs down Castiel's stomach, sending Castiel into another, uncontrolled fit of laughter.
"Let's go outside," he suggests, and Castiel nods. He climbs off Dean's lap and swings the car door open, a prickling, sharp gush of cold air stinging his face prompting him to tug at his jacket— no, Dean's jacket— closer to his chest. He catches the top of Dean's head from across the roof of the car and walks around to find Dean leaning against the door of his car, his hands stuffed in his pocket.
He would
Castiel asks, for lack of better words, as he grabs a cotton swab and soaks it with disinfectant. Dean hisses at the first touch of it to his bruised skin, and reaches up to cover it from Castiel, who only pushes his hand away, meeting Dean's eyes with a single pleading look.
"Mhm. I want to say a lot of things, but I just don't know what to say."
With a sigh, Castiel nudges the cabinet door shut, walking back out to where Dean sits at the edge of the bed, bare save for the boxers around his hips and thighs. There's a packet of wipes by the bed, and he grabs a few, before settling down in front of Dean, crouching between his legs.
"I figured." Castiel shrugs.
"What?" comes the distant reply, and Dean grins at the familiarity in Blue’s voice.
"I'm trying to be."
The next moment, Dean's firm, broad warm arms were sliding around Cas's tiny frame, pulling him closer into a bubble of comfort and relief, and Castiel let himself sob into Dean's shoulder.
Castiel pulled away and his eyes drifted across the room as he hummed in consideration, "-does master want a sandwich?"
"You uh, mind if I grab this one? It's the last in stock."
"Dean?"
Castiel considers it with a hum.  "Eh, I don't know. I do like it when you finish my sentences."
He grabs his pen and shuts his eyes. He doesn't want to see himself write it, no, he just wants to pen it all down, no matter how cluttered, how ugly, how smudged the page gets. He needs to let it out.
"For what?"
"Give me a minute," Castiel says as he works around the kitchen, moving from one foot to another to grab a pair of mugs from an upper shelf. Dean smiles when his eye catches the cartoon honeybee graphic mug. He's well aware of how big of an admirer Castiel is of bees.
He almost changes his mind.
Dean, is it, is it true?"
"Nah," There's an ease to the man's words, and Castiel heaves a sigh, letting his hands fall to his side as his eyes wander down to a bitten nail. "It's alright. You got a night shift, huh? Burning the midnight oil?"
He needs to clear his mind. And a walk will do just that.
A rich laugh drifts across, and Castiel narrows his eyes onto a random tile on the floor, attention focused on Dean as he speaks.
"I'm gonna’ take that as a yes," Dean laughs, and he reaches out to poke his fingers into Castiel's side, which sends Castiel hurling into the door as he recoils with a grin at the tickle.
Dean is silent, his eyes glued to the table as he pointedly avoids meeting Castiel’s eyes. Castiel wants to hug him, squeeze him in his arms like he did the night before, but for now, due to the distance between them, he settles for a squeeze to Dean's hand. Dean looks up at him then, his green eyes teary and vulnerable, and something raw, something pure reflects within them.
She sighs, sets the bottle down, and looks up at him.
He waits. And waits.
he say?"
Castiel pauses.
How he shuffles into the bathroom is a flurry of images, but it's nothing that concerns him.
Something about Castiel's defensive demeanour falters, and his eyes soften, a light sheen of tears coating them as he sets his mug aside, lips parted, ready to argue back. Instead, he walks over to Dean
Castiel mused,
"Being a lil' unimaginative over there,
Castiel pulls away, gasping for air and swaying on his feet, before rocking forward into Dean's arms. Resting his forehead against Dean's, arms sliding around Dean's neck, he presses close into the heat of Dean's body.
"I said, where do you want to eat?
Regret washes over Dean. Like a bucket of cold water.
"Not for me. Not for us."
alpha close, ignoring the strange glances from the passerby, as he ground his hips against his alpha's, "-where your car is."
"I hope you enjoyed today." Castiel smiles as he regards the young girl, his student, standing below him, her blonde curls falling against her shoulders and framing her face as she grips her pink, princess-themed backpack to her chest.
"I don't want to sleep. I want to talk to you."
leaned forward, his warm breath ghosting over the slice on Castiel's face as he whispered, "—torture."
Dean is leaving. Not in a month. In six, small days.
He's moving out next Saturday. In a week."
"It's Castiel. He's, he's, he's– I don't know, Sam, he's been sick all morning. Shaking, crying, hurting– just touch him, he's burning up, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what's wrong with him–"
"Bye, I'll send you some videos in case there's something wrong."
Then another thought pops into his mind.
The sound of a content hum drifts across the room, and Dean fiddles with a loose thread on his trousers to compensate for the silence.
"Right," Green scoffs. "Is it the
Yup, he's feeling alright.
"At this point? After I
He’s sure it’ll be a few hours before Castiel wakes up. They were up late the night before, talking about a new documentary that came out on Netflix, and things kept escalating from one topic to another, and before Dean knew it, it was three in the morning. Of course, he's used to not getting enough sleep, it doesn't bother him much, but the way he had to urge Cas to sleep— God, the guy wouldn't stop talking, and Dean wanted him to go on and on, about a constellation he noticed in the sky once, but it was too late at night. He knew the second Castiel walked away, that this man wasn't going to be waking up anytime beyond eleven a.m. the next morning.
"One, I don't understand your intense concern about my dating life. Two, how do you know about Grindr? Actually, don't answer that, I feel stupid for simply asking."
"Hannah?"
"Yeah. I've always liked the buzz of a city, y'know. There's something so calming, yet something so lively about a city like this. But it is hard to make friends here. You're probably the only person I've spoken to except for the mover guy."
"Now, Cas, who ordered the ambush?"
“I’ll be right here,” Dean says, and Castiel walks over to his bookshelf in his bedroom, eyes scouring the various paperback books, finger dragging along the spines of a row of books as he purses his lips, narrowing his eyes until his finger stops on a particular book.
"... So then, we have these huge, buff guys as our trainers, and Benny and I, we were two lanky little sticks,— compared to the others in the group. Luckily, Turner didn't let us give up until we were oozing with pure muscle, so I guess that's why I wouldn't want
"What? You calling me a waste of time?" Dean laughs.
Dean complies, kicking his boots off and sliding them to the corner of the room. Castiel walks over to the bathroom, clicking the supply cabinet open, grabbing some ointment, cotton, and disinfectant. He notes from the corner of his eyes, as Dean undresses down to his boxers. A vague pang of arousal surges through Castiel. It's been so long since Castiel felt Dean's touch on his skin. The lingering drag of his thick fingers on Castiel's flesh, the sound of his grunts against Castiel's ears, the heat of his breath on Castiel's cheek, the gentle rocking of their bodies as Dean pounds him into climax. Castiel knows tonight will be one of those nights. One of those nights where they'll make love for hours at end, until the first trace of a sunrise filters through.
"Cas," Dean gasps, and his voice is laced with prominent relief.
"Yes?"
The words, the voice— they ring through Dean's mind over and over and over again, like a hymn, and at last—
"It's alright. You have to leave, I know. There are better things for you back home, Dean, I get it. I don't know what I'd do if I were in your place, but I know you’re doing what you think is right. We'll just... try to make it work somehow. Maybe a long-distance relationship, although I'm not sure it would be that effective."
Dean's eyes blink back to Castiel, and he widens his lips in a smile, although it doesn't quite reach his eyes. A split second later, there are tears pooling at the rim of Dean's eyes, and his lips quiver. Eyes wide and concerned, Castiel sits up on Dean's stomach, reaching a hand down to cup his jaw.
"'Course I did. Look what I had waiting for me. Can you believe how stupid I was? Giving this up?" Dean gives a wet chuckle, and Castiel nods, his emotions getting the best of him as he lets out another sob, squeezing Dean's cheeks in his hands as he nods.
"Sam–"
Dean's words only spur the wave of arousal coursing through Castiel, and in response, he widens the distance between his knees, lifting his ass up in the air as he leans down to wrap his hands around Dean's cock, two damp palms jerking the fat, erect cock until it's twitching to come.
Dejected, Castiel frowns to himself, "-Alright."
When was the last time Dean allowed himself to indulge in his attraction to men? Forget about men, shit, he doesn't even remember the last time he dropped by a bar, had a few beers, chatted up some woman, and then went home, leaving her hanging as he did in his early thirties before the war. Dean remembers a few women at the camp, and the nights they'd spent together, he also remembers a few men at the camp, and how he'd only gone to third base with them in the late hours of the night on their days off.
Their hands brush against each other on the table, eyes fixed onto each other, and all Castiel can think of is how he has nothing but an hour— less even— left with Dean. He tries not to let his tears cloud his eyes, especially since he's already admonished himself a few minutes ago. His smile falters on his face, and although it aches to turn down in a frown, Castiel compels himself to keep the smile plastered to his face.
He remembered the faces of his superiors, of Michael and of Uriel, ordering him to infiltrate the demon warehouse. He remembered knowing the warehouse would be empty and opting to lead the way by testing the water alone. He remembered his juniors, how the demons laughed as they slaughtered Castiel's brethren. He remembered the sheer panic that struck his being the moment he realised the demons had laid a trap within which Castiel had fallen head-first. He remembered the Enochian wardings outside the room the demons dragged his bruised, broken body to. And then, the torture started.
A black button-up blouse with puffed sleeves and a white, lacy hem; a tiny, black frill skirt which fell open when Castiel bent over to pick something up, only showing Dean a clear display of the young man's round, plump ass clad in a thin, sheer lace white pantie which sunk into the crack of his ass; a tiny, white lacy apron tied around his waist, and the best of all, his slender, tanned hairless legs covered in sheer, black netted thigh-high stockings. Dean was reminded, for the first time in months, simply how beautiful Castiel was.
"Dean? You don't have to go back."
And that was what scared him.
Dean is leaving. Castiel’s friend
and he bends down to swipe the slip of paper into his fingers. He sets the package aside and unfolds the note to reveal slightly botched handwriting.
He flings the book onto his bed, slips under the covers and flips the book open, setting it down against his lap as he reads. He hasn't even made it past the first page when a tear falls against the page. Followed by another and another. He shuts the book, flings it across the room in a fit of rage, and buries his face against his pillow.
"What?" Castiel asks.
"Envies him? I know how that feels."
"Cas," Dean panted, resting his head against Castiel's shoulder. Castiel in turn, brushed his fingers through Dean's sweaty hair, and dropped a kiss to his forehead, "-you're fired."
A loud
When he steps out, he spots Dean on the other side of the diner, but he isn't eating. His phone is pressed to his ear, and he appears engrossed in a heated discussion with someone. Without a word, Castiel walks over to their booth and slips into his seat, sending Dean a cursory smile before averting his eyes.
"Promise. Never gonna’ ditch you."
"Ple—" Castiel begged, but the sound barely made it past his throat as another sob spilled out of him. His tears rolled down the rope wrapped around his mouth, and fell to the floor with a plink.
Pleasure washed over Castiel at having his hole stretched open and fingered, especially when Dean's fingers brushed against his prostate and he let out a loud moan. But the next moment, Dean pulled he fingers out, leaving Castiel's hole empty and twitching. Castiel gasped, and glanced behind, watching as Dean rubbed his large, monster cock against Castiel's hole, teasing the entrance but never pushing in.
"I told you, Blue," Dean grins, proud of himself for rendering the young man speechless, "-I read."
for being super supportive and just an amazing freakin' human being and helping my (kinda clueless ass) with corrections and advice. It was so fun having you with me on this journey, K. I'm so grateful to you.💖
"No, I'm not."
Mr. Kreschner hums, and quirks his bottom lip, an impressed glint in his eyes, "I wonder how you pull it off, boy. Me, I can't live a day without my good night's sleep. I get all grumbly if I don't get sleep."
"Paganini," he says in a feeble voice, and Dean brushes his fingers through Castiel's dark, fluffy hair.
Dean pulls away for a brief second, simply to drink in the sight of Castiel, eyes shut, swollen lips parted, and his face, his beautiful, tranquil face: the face of every dream Dean will ever have, the chorus of every love song he will ever hear, the subject of every poem he will ever read, and the color in every painting he will ever see.
"I'm on my own now," Castiel starts, "-and I'll be the same for a long while now."
until every inch of them is pressed to each other, to bury himself in the warm scent emanating off of Castiel.
"Remember how we'd gone a town back to look for his shoe? I can't believe we did that. It was hilarious. Hey, what was that town, shit, I don't remember the name."
"I didn't know you were coming home."
"Oh? What is it?"
"I am willing to test your love. To test your patience, and your loyalty, and your
A long pause later, Dean sighs.
"You shouldn't be so hard on them,” he says. “I mean, it's not my place to speak, not at all, but take it from someone who's lost both parents in the course of over five years."
The Empty is a strange place.
Dean's fingers— they popped every button on Castiel's white, blood-soaked shirt, before letting it fall open against his bare, bruised chest.
"Gonna' make sure you're always happy, always smiling," he continues with a moan, and his lips wrap over Dean's nipple as he scoots back, dragging his taint over Dean's cock as he does so, evoking a loud moan from the latter. Grabbing the lube from beside him, Castiel coats his fingers in the cold gel, and dips them between his thighs, rubbing them over his hole and pushing his fingers in with a loud grunt. Dean's lips drag up his navel, kissing at the freckle next to his nipple, and reaching down to slip his dry fingers inside Castiel's wet hole.
“Sorry, go ahead,” he urges Dean, who speaks after a moment’s pause.
They don't speak then, and Castiel settles back snug against the chair as he flips a random page open.
"So," Castiel says.
"Why would you want to remember me?"
"D— d— Dean—" his highness, the prince, groans out, his eyebrows knit together in pure ecstacy as he drops his head back, allowing Dean enough expanse of fresh, smooth unblemished skin. Without a single second to consider, Dean sucks in deep, bruising marks into Castiel's skin, branding the prince as his own.
Dean laughs, reaching down to keep the box of takeout away.
sounds like a mouthful, and
"I'm ready, keep moving."
"Yes, please—"
"Do you want to change places?"
"Man, it's been weeks. What's up? How you been?"
"One day, it's going to be the most gorgeous hotel you've ever seen. And guess who's going to be responsible for that?"
Castiel stood, speechless.
"What?" he grumbled, only to come face-to-face with
, leaving Castiel's skin bruised, swollen and dripping with drool.
"Father?" Dean asks, confused as to why Blue is asking.
"Goddamnit, do you know how fucking hard you get me? You're tiny little hole, fuck, it's so fucking small I think I'll practically break it. You really wanna' do this?"
"Alpha—"
"So, boys, what's the emergency? Please tell me I didn't leave my charity ball on hold for your himbo non-sense,” Rowena sighs, tucking a strand of her curly red hair behind her ear, as she settles down on a chair at the map-table, steepling her fingers under her chin before glancing between Dean and Sam, who stand before her with their arms folded across their chest.
The moment he turned around however, his eyes went wide as he realized—
"I'm glad it's yours."
Castiel doesn’t mean for his voice to go so soft, but he can't help it.
“I don’t know if my guitar works.”
"Did you need anything else?" he asked, and the alpha shook his head. His eyes returned to meet Castiel's, and a moment passed between them before the alpha spoke up.
Dean grinned.
Truth is, either way, Castiel is going to be the one at fault. If his notes turn out wrong, his fault. Tuning not right, his fault again. But then again, he's positive the tuning won't be wrong. He knows it.
Castiel speaks.
"Sure. You uh, take care of yourself, Sammy."
"What promise?" Castiel asks, restless, as he strives to know more, strives to know what Dean is doing, what he wants to do.
A moan spilled past his lips. He felt dirty.
Dean was right. Lisa was beautiful.
Their eyes met, and perhaps it was another one of Castiel's illusions, but he swore Dean was leaning in, bridging the distance between their faces, and as much as Castiel wanted to move, the moment he stepped back, Dean's arms were sliding around his waist, pulling him in, and then, there was a brush of soft, dry lips against his own. It was the faintest touch, but Castiel gave into it, body and mind, as he pressed himself against Dean, hoping, wishing, praying— this was a dream, that this was all in Castiel's head, another one of his fantasies, but something about the way Dean rubbed his jaw before brushing his lips against Castiel's brought Castiel staggering back to the present, and he realised at once—
"I want you to apologize for not saying anything. For not telling me how much it hurt you when I was with Lisa. For smiling even when everything I said only broke you. For thinking of me before you thought of yourself," Dean growled, his lips trembling as he punched his knuckles into the wood beside Castiel's head, "-for, for, for being a fucking coward, and not telling me that this whole fucking time, you've been— you've been—"
"No," Castiel breathes out, as if he simply can't comprehend the fact that Dean would ever love him enough to send him into ruins.
"It...It means, the thing...or person, I love the most, from the very, very bottom of my heart, begins to— begins to deteriorate. Their body burns up," Dean gulps, intimidated by the silence he's met with, "-their organs slow down," and just to make it
But then there would be the nightmares.
"Love you Cas, so much," Dean mumbles between a few pecks, "-I'll always come back to you."
"Couple years ago. Missed my eye by half an inch. Never been more thankful in life."
"Alright, well, uh," he pauses, still stunned by Castiel's previous reply, "
Castiel turns to Dean, a beaming smile on his face as he regards Dean, "-I love you too."
Castiel watches as Dean digs into his pocket for his key and inserts it into the keyhole of the door just a few feet away from Castiel's. With the click of the lock, Dean sends Castiel one last glance, before stepping into his apartment and shutting the door behind him.
Dean gulps. He sucks in a deep breath.
"So good for me, sweetheart, so strong for me. I love you so much. Never going to leave you. Never."
The bundle is wrapped with careful deliberation, so Castiel uses utmost care to unwrap it. The book is light in his lap, not too hefty, and a slight expanse of grey meets Castiel's eyes. He hitches a silent breath and shuts his eyes with childlike anticipation before laying the bare book on his lap, devoid of all packing.
The tears still pool at the rim of Dean's, but Castiel is glad to see his lips aren't trembling any longer.
Dean smiled, and held his hands out, urging Castiel to come closer. The catboy smiled, and with a soft giggle, walked into Dean's arms, dropping the rag and the duster at Dean's foot, as he fell against Dean's chest and wrapped his arms around Dean's neck, scooching his ass until he was sitting snug in Dean's lap.
"Sam?" he asks, voice laced with disbelief, a smile growing at his lips.
Dean beamed at that, and caught Castiel's lips in a gentle, heated kiss, where he slipped Castiel a sliver of tongue, and Castiel let out a tiny moan, hands grasping at Dean's ironed, grey suit, before Castiel pulled away, aware of the company they were in, and schooled Dean's sad, puppy-dog expression with a wide-eyed glare.
"You know, this reminds me of a quote, from one of my favourite poets,
, so prominently whiskey. Neat whiskey, and the thought of it has a burn sliding down Castiel's throat.
Mischief laces the man's word and Dean finds himself grinning.
Rod McKuen’."
"I'll take your word for that. But it's nice to see you like this, all smiling and bubbly. Maybe you should ding-dong-ditch your neighbour more often." She winks and nudges Castiel's shoulder with her own.
Rowena laughs. Dean hates that laugh.
In the library, seated side by side, a bottle of whiskey shared between them, Sam and Rowena sigh. They share a gaze, before breaking into a smile.
"And?" Dean whispered, inching closer to Castiel's face. Their eyes met and their gazes fixed, and at once, Dean felt himself give in wholly and utterly into his urges as he parted his lips and fluttered his eyes shut in anticipation.
It tugs a smile at Castiel's lips.
Dean frowns, shifting over on the sofa until he's lying down, his back sinking into the cushion under him, head on the armrest. Castiel lays on his chest, passive and pliant, his fingers dancing along the stubble on Dean's jaw. It takes them a few seconds to adjust, but then Dean is a bit more comfortable, and Castiel rests his chin on Dean's chest, right between his collar bone, gazing up at him with wonder-filled eyes, urging Dean to continue. The lights around them are dim, not as bright as the one in the kitchen, but it's enough for Dean to map out Castiel's face, the curve of his jaw, the crinkles around his eye when he smiles, and the sharp, defined eyebrows.
Castiel doesn't say anything then, letting Dean's word hang in the air as an explanation in itself.
"C—cas—"
Castiel's heart pounds in his chest, and he reaches up to wipe his sleeve over his face.
It was ethereal. Dean's finger, thick and long, fidgeted with Castiel's leaking, quivering hole. Castiel felt the finger trying to pry him open, rubbing around the rim in soothing circles, before the tip popped in. The first brush of Dean's fingernail against his sensitive flesh sent a jolt of thunder coursing through Castiel's veins, and he moaned into the pillow under him, rocking his hips back so Dean's finger would push in deeper.
Castiel sucked in a breath, considering Dean's question. Did he? Did he really want to go back?
"Okay, that's enough. You think you can be all cheeky, huh? And you think I won't do anything? Well, I'm done being easy on you."
Castiel laughs at that, and brings his hands to the front to fidget with a nail on his finger.
"The face is borrowed. I'm renting it for a while. However," Meg moves closer, as if levitating towards Dean, or perhaps, it is Dean who wanders close to her, although its hard to tell, and he watches as her face disintegrates into nothing— pitch black— before reintegrating into—
"Are you still fucking me or have you come to your senses?" Castiel asked, and Dean should have bent him over and spanked his ass bright red for the insolence in his voice, but it could slide this once, especially when Dean grabbed him by the hips and pushed him up onto the countertop.
Carefully, Castiel pulled Dean's boxers down, until they stuck around his thighs, and with every passing second, Castiel felt his eyes and his arousal grow bigger. Up close, Dean wasn't simply big, he was gorgeous. The tip was a soft, faint red— leaking with streaks of pre-come dripping down the length, which stood tall and wide, the flesh heated and twitching. Castiel tried to wrap his palm around it—
"Damn, you're young."
"There is no home base and there are no dates. Shut up." Castiel flushes red, and shaking his head, rises from the sofa and stretches his arms out, lips falling open in a large yawn, as he squeezes his eyes shut. Dean grins.
"He'll be okay, Dean. We'll do everything we can."
"Mm, my, what a needy little kitty. Want your master's cock?"
"I'm not internalizing anything, buddy,” Dean says after a pause, dismissing Blue’s doubts, “-I'm just saying you have doubts sometimes, right? Like, am I really bisexual? Am I just faking—
A sound, one Castiel never expected to hear, drifts across the wall.
Every inch of Castiel's body ached.
"Cas..."
Question after question about Heaven, about the angel's war strategies, about angel weaknesses, about hidden weapons pestered his mind, all the while a demon with disgusting, pitch-black eyes and a cruel, grotesque snarl dragged an angel blade down his neck, slicing his skin and sucking his grace out— little by little, until he was ultimately, human.
blood.
"Who said I'm," There's another prominent gasp on the end, which draws a smile at Castiel’s lips, "
A chuckle slips past Dean's lips as he buries his face in the crook of Castiel's neck, and breathes in the scent of the subdued laundry detergent.
A knock on the wall draws him out his thoughts and Dean turns to the sound with a passive look on his face.
It's strange how Castiel just says it. He just says it.
"Faster," Castiel croaks out, and Dean nods. He quickens his pace, evoking a loud, throaty moan from Castiel, who digs his nails into Dean's back. It's simple, missionary sex, and yet, Dean has never been happier. Maybe it's because of Cas— his mere presence, his love, his voice, his touch, his smile, simply him. Maybe it's the way Dean realizes, after having held himself back for years, that he can now fully enjoy basking in Castiel's love and in turn, shower Castiel with his own. Maybe it's the way his eyes can't, for the love of God, tear away from Castiel's face, because the tiny moans, the faint noises, the laboured breaths and the needy hums, all paired with the thoroughly-fucked expression on Castiel's face is a sight Dean has fantasized about for years.
"What?"
what will you do once I leave?" There's mischief in Dean's voice, but in no way or manner does Castiel see the humor in the question, so he sighs and lets his gaze wander out the window.
In the blink of an eye, Dean's face smooths out into something inscrutable, and he pulls Castiel close to bury himself in his shoulder, a loud sob breaking through the silence between them.
Perhaps, Mildred was right. He needed some rest as well.
"But... But..." Castiel's voice weakens. Then, as if something changes inside him, he slumps down, shoulders going lax. He breathes in a deep breath, eyes wandering passively over some thread on Dean's shirt, before he purses his lips and sighs.
Claire gasped.
If his silence is any judgement, Dean appears to be stunned for a moment, before his arm tightens around Castiel, the other still firm on the steering wheel.
"You're my true mate?" Dean gasped, stepping back with a jerk as if repulsed by the presence of Castiel, who simply stood rooted to the ground, watching Dean as the gears in his mind worked around.
A glance at his watch shows him it's half-past seven in the morning, which means Dean won't be up yet. He usually wakes up around eight-thirty, especially when he goes to bed later than usual. Last night Dean went to sleep around four, or at least so Castiel thinks. He went on break at four and Dean, being Dean, called him up, whispering to him about mundane things, like the litter of kittens he passed by that day.
He unfolds the crumple, flattening the page out as he skims his eyes over the scribbles.
Helpless, Castiel slips under the covers, switching the night lamp off after him, as he feels the bed dip in the dark, and then the familiar weight of Dean settles next to him, his warmth exuding in brief waves, and Castiel presses his nose against the scent of the fresh sheets, before curling into Dean's side. Dean simply slips his arms under Castiel's neck and over his stomach, before pressing his cheek to Castiel's.
The jacket was large, and it sat loosely on Castiel's shoulders, almost drowning him in it. It smelt purely like Dean, like his laundry detergent, like his cologne, like
"Fuck, Cas, talk to me, can you talk to me?"
"Watch the house? What, is it gonna' grow feet and run away?" Dean snorted.
speaking to him.
Shame washed over Castiel.
Silence hangs around him for a moment
Swathes of green fill Dean's eyes as far as he can see. Trees— tall, broad and unnerving, hover over him like a canopy of green, and he feels easy. At least for a moment.
He pulls a chair to the wall and settles down.
Castiel touches his finger to his tongue before flipping through the corners of the pages until he lands on the one he read a few minutes ago.
"George Eliot. I know."
"I like your voice."
Deep, blue eyes gaze into his own.
With that, Sam hangs up, and Dean, now aware of the slight burning smell that rises in the air, turns back to the stove. He grabs the spatula and scrapes the eggs out in time before they char at the bottom. He heaves a sigh of relief and grabs some bacon, oil and seasoning, flicking them into the pan, the hissing sound of the meat cooking, echoing through the kitchen.
"Really?" he asks, hesitant.
This time, Castiel didn't stutter.
"Not in the books I've read. Snow always means sorrow." Dean's eyes shine with a glint of regret, and Castiel wonders if he feels as helpless as Castiel does in that moment.
And it's easy too. He's already carrying so much guilt, what difference will some more make?
Dean abided, switching from one to two fingers. He scissored them inside Castiel's hole, widening them to stretch Castiel's hole, twisting them to push them deeper, and at last, rubbing them over the sides of Castiel's moist fleshy walls. All the while, his catboy made the prettiest noises, begging Dean to give him more, gasping and whining and whimpering as he hid his face in Dean's neck.
A shaky gasp slips past Castiel's lips.  "I wish I could. But I have a life here, Dean. You, you still have the time to make changes, if you just think over it."
"Tell me why you didn't come over for Christmas then?" Dean shot back, his eyebrows furrowing together as he locked his jaw, and tightened his arms around Castiel's waist. There was no point in lying.
It was the eighteenth of December. The winter had grown sharper, colder and whiter. Castiel had begun wearing long-sleeves to school. They had a few minutes before class.
Castiel's usually round and peering blue eyes are now shut, eyebrows furrowed, lips curled down into a frown with dark, heavy bags under his eyes, wrinkles stretching across his forehead, and his hair is unkempt from having been rubbed against the pillow.
"Hello?" he asks, a bit hesitant, since he's never heard Green's voice devoid of the barrier between them. Of course, it wouldn't differ much, but somehow there must be a clarity in the phone call that a conversation through a wall cannot offer.
session could result into. Maybe Castiel would feel better by lunch, and they'd go back to the way they were, since Castiel doesn't even know the implications of cuddling, and would find it confusing as to why they should speak about it. Second case scenario could be, Castiel calls Dean for more cuddle sessions, which would only make it worse for Dean, who would find himself unable to express his feelings for Castiel, but also craving their intimacy. The best-case scenario could be, both of them get their crap sorted, have heated, steamy sex on Castiel's bed, and work out a relationship.
Castiel stops in his tracks. His hand falls away from Dean's as he reaches up to rub the sleeve of his cardigan against his cheeks in a desperate attempt to wipe away the tears Dean notices right as he turns.
Point in case, Mr. Green is a master at balancing on the thin line between completely
"Excuse me?" Castiel scoffs, eyes narrow as he stares at a blank spot on the wall.
"No." The prince breathes out softly, and Dean hums to himself. Cautiously, he glides his hand higher over the Prince's leg, watching his highness with a sharp, lewd expression in his eyes.
mirror of Castiel’s feelings.
Blue sighs, but his voice is sated, and Dean wonders, not for the first time that day, what Blue looks like. If he wears glasses, or if he has a long nose. It doesn’t matter to Dean, but it does intrigue him, despite his own rule of anonymity.
"Have a seat," Castiel murmurs, not bothering to open his eyes as he slides his foot back and allows Dean space to sit. Dean however, lingers at the edge of the bed for a few seconds, before at last, Castiel's eyes flutter open.
Without having to glance downwards, he knew his cock was reacting to the demon's touch, and as disgusted as he felt, as much as he wanted to vomit at the prospect of having the demon suck his nipples, he would do anything to not have needles pierced into his sensitive skin. It would hurt, and he assumed, something awful, and selfishly, he craved the pleasure of a warm, heavy tongue rolling around his nipple.
yawning?"
"Dean, don't, you know I'm ticklis—"
The man sighs, and the soft, muffled creaking of a chair precedes his voice. "I've always had trouble sleeping."
"You."
"Be gentle to me, Dean."
and reaches for the spatula.
Castiel whimpers, but reaches out for Dean’s hand. Dean's eyes drop down to the hand, before he swallows thick.
"And what was in it?"
"Stay in late, get some more sleep. I don't think we'll talk until three anyway." Castiel suggests, his eyes tracking every skip of the clock.
"Oh. What about you? What are you doing here in NYC? Anything specific you're here for?"
Another grind down on Dean's spent cock, and Cas is seeking his own release as Dean wraps a hand over his cock and jerks him, the traces of Dean's release spilling through Castiel's debauched hole, down his thighs and onto Dean's lap, as he peppers gentle kisses down Castiel's chest, and continues to jerk him. Castiel feels a familiar curl in his gut, and he clenches his ass hard, his shoulders and calves tensing, as he digs his toes into the bed, and with a broken
A laugh echoed through the room, and Castiel watched as Dean grinned— no, beamed with a grin— his head falling back as he broke into a fit of laughter— laughter that felt no short of needles bursting Castiel's ear drums, and at last, the demon gazed up at Castiel. But something about his eyes was different. They hadn't gone pitch-black, as the earlier demons' had when they wanted to intimidate Castiel, but yet, a strange darkness had unfurled within those apple-green eyes. Something unhinged and feral. Something vulgar and grotesque. Something tragic.
But what he finds inside the room, is complete and utter darkness.
Dean won’t tell him. He simply won't.
"There's this diner, Donnie's diner, cheap, convenient, pretty empty in the mornings, hella’ crowded in the evenings. They got amazing burgers, Cas. Anytime I needed some grease, that's where I'd go. It’s a little far, not much, but we’ll get there faster with the car."
"What?" Blue chuckles, and Dean scoffs.
Truth be told, his indecision isn't even about what he'll say. He knows how he'll say he’s leaving early, straight and clear, but what bothers him, has him fidgeting and trembling, is the thought of how Castiel will react. He will be upset, no doubt. But he knows Cas is not someone to lash out at people or show his temper. Rather, he’s reticent, someone who urges people to speak about their feelings, while keeping his own locked away. Dean has rarely heard him open up to him, and the times Dean has tried to urge him, Castiel simply digresses from their subject. He pushes down his anger. That's how Castiel is tuned.
"Cas?"
"Course you do," Dean sniffles, and swipes a hand across his nose. Castiel sighs, but his arms slide around Dean's neck, pulling him in until Dean's cheek is pressed to Castiel's chest. Both men shut their eyes, and Castiel presses his lips to Dean's hair.
"Cas, you're still healing. I could have just reached over and—"
"Like this?" Cas asks, eyes glancing backwards where Dean's cock is nudging against his hole.
"Well, I've fingered myself before, but erm,yes, I've never—"
"Internalized bi-phobia? What's that?"
"Man, what? This is bullshit," he groans, rubbing a hand over his face as frustration builds in his veins.
. Yes, he has fine lines on his forehead, and yes, he has disarrayed bed-head, but he is healing, and nothing else in the world could ever give Dean as much joy as watching Castiel heal gives him. Castiel feels lighter in his arms— brighter, even, and before Dean knows it, there's a lopsided grin on his face from having smiled too much. It catches Castiel's attention, and for a few seconds, they stare at each other.
"Where—"
Dean sighs, waiting for Blue to finish, but his words remain lost on his tongue and silence fills the air between them, until Blue speaks again, his voice now lower, more hesitant.
” Castiel swallows thickly, struggling to keep his voice high, “
"How about a milkshake? We have bananas-"
"Dean?"
"This." Dean glances down at their bodies, where their legs are tangled, Dean's arms are all over Castiel, where Castiel is holding on tight to Dean, and their faces are simply inches apart.
As if it clicks within Castiel's mind, he laughs, and his head falls back against the wall.
Castiel feels his grin stretch wider
"I love you too, Dean. Now will you switch the lights off?"
A pause ensues, before Green speaks up from the other end, "Remember when I said my father passed away a month ago?"
Not a single trace of the torture remains.
Dean grins in the slightest, and nods his head, eyes shut as Castiel massages the shampoo into his scalp until it lathers.
"Keep going," Dean mutters, and Castiel nods, wrapping his arms around Dean's neck as he brushes his fingers over Dean's cheekbones. Once they flow into a slow, languid pace, no haste, no rush, no urgency, only want, Castiel tilts his head down to meet Dean's eyes.
Perhaps, in hindsight, Castiel should have stayed in his own room, instead of being helpless and giving into his mindless urges. He should have staved his urges, and willed himself to mind his own business, to repay Dean's kindness by staying out of Dean's way.
"Yeah."
"Dean—" he starts, only to be cut off by another kiss to his shoulder. Dean's fingers slide under his shirt, over his waist as they nudge Castiel back into the bed, and Castiel falls into the mattress, pliant and needy. Dean latches his lips to his neck, settling between his legs, as their hands tangle within each other's with desperation. Dean noses against Castiel's neck, his lips nipping at the sensitive skin at Castiel's neck, before he tugs it between his teeth, and Castiel gasps at the slight twinge of pain, only for Dean to soothe it with another kiss.
Dean shifts nervously in his seat, rolling a peanut in his fingers to distract himself from the repulsive quiet between them.
A soft rustle on the bed has his ears perking, and it takes him a few long seconds to adjust his eyes to the darkness, but once he can see inside, he notices the movement on the bed a few feet away.
Dean's chest is heaving with quick breaths, his eyebrows furrowed, his veins flaring and all he can see is red.
Castiel knew why. He wasn't going to correct Dean.
Now that gets Castiel's gears turning.
"You're awfully silent. What's going on in your head?"
Castiel felt himself flush at the praise, his cheeks tinting pink, and he looked away blushing, still burning up from his heat, still slicking profusely from his hole, and yet somehow, he'd never felt more at peace than he did now. At last, Dean's hand in his head stopped moving, and he glanced up at Dean in question, a small hum escaping the back of his throat, but Dean in turn, simply pulled his cock out of Castiel's mouth.
Castiel sucks another kiss onto his jaw, just to tease him.
"I don't understand what's so embarrassing about finding a joke funny."
"Where's Cas?"
Castiel sighs, but a smile pulls at his lips. "Hello Dean."
It feels as if an anchor drops within Castiel guts. His face falls and his mind fills with fear, with doubts, with guilt. Why doesn't Dean want to meet him? Is it because he doesn't want Castiel to be a part of his life? And if so, does Dean think of Castiel as a burden? As someone he needs to put up with every day?
"We could do that, right?" Dean urges, and he links Castiel's fingers through his own, pulls his arms towards him until Castiel is slumping over the table, his hands in Dean's lap like a child, and Dean laughs.
"Care to explain what's so funny?"
"Erhm," Castiel cleared his throat, and sent their coachman a polite smile, who to his credit, had been standing quietly at the corner with his eyes averted and a few suitcases beside him, "-you could keep those out here, mister."
Castiel grins, pressing the side of his head to the wall, eyes narrow as he attempts at envisioning a face to match the voice. He fails, and pushes those thoughts away when the man speaks up again.
Now this piques Dean's curiosity. How does someone so skilled at numerous instruments, a literal musical virtuoso, end up working as a night-shift nurse at a city hospital?
"I knew it."
A taunting tone lingers in the Empty's words.
As he walked away, further and further, he couldn't find it in himself to turn around. He didn't want to look at Dean.
"S'okay, I can call him later."
"So," Garth started, clearing some of the thickness in the air, "-I've heard ya' wanna turn this ole' place into a hotel."
It felt nice. Easing. Content.
"M'gonna' love you f'rever, Jack," Claire said, and a bright, beaming smile spread across her face.
"I already knew."
Dean doesn't mean to shorten it on purpose, but
With a fond roll of his eyes, he turns back. Alicia is near the coffee kettle now and she sends him a knowing glance.
teasing. He has thought about it before, how Castiel has the perfect cock-sucking lips, and hey, he's only human, okay? He's got urges, and sometimes he indulges in fantasies. Harmless little fantasies. With a loud, unexpectedly needy moan, Castiel sucks Dean's cock into his mouth, head bobbing as he hollows out his cheeks, and grabs the base of Dean's cock in one hand, the other hand rolling Dean's balls.
I'm super excited for this fic, and feedback is highly appreciated because I'm experimenting and would love to know your thoughts on this!
"Blood oath, Cas. Dad's debt too."
A slender, white-gloved hand slipped into Dean's, and out stepped his mate, Castiel, with one hand held against his slightly bulging stomach— doe-eyed and radiant, studying the world around him. A voice called out to them from the front, it was their coachman wanting to know if they needed help with the luggage. Dean walked over to him to speak to him for a while, but Castiel lingered where he was, simply drinking in the beauty around him.
But in a moment, Castiel finds himself standing in a brighter world, where the sun, the moon, and the stars— all belong to Dean.
"Yes, uhm, Lisa, right?"
Castiel’s thoughts race. His heart beat fasters. His lips tremble, and he rubs his broad palms over his face in an attempt to calm himself down.
"Hey, sweetheart," Deanna grinned, and pressed a kiss to her omega's forehead. Bright blue eyes fluttered up to gaze at her, and Deanna blushed, running her finger through Cas's hair as she pet Juju.
"I thought you'd never ask."
Rowena's demeanour changes at once, and she leans forward on the chair, her intense eyes flickering between Dean and Sam.
"You know," Castiel says a few moments after they pull away, "-they say snow symbolizes a new beginning, purity and innocence."
Castiel grabs his keys and stuffs them in his pocket.
"Asleep. Dean. I don't know. As long as he's in the Empty, I don't care."
, yes, they were,
"I'm tired, Dean, I need to sleep." Castiel sighs, and rolls around until he's facing Dean, who stares at him, awestruck by how beautiful Castiel looks, even when he's sick to his core, has barfed his guts out, and has been lying around on the bed all day.
"I hated your gift. Because every time I looked at it, I kept thinking of how you spent your summer working overtime, how you'd fall asleep in my car, how you barely ate, how you couldn't focus on school, and all for a fucking vinyl. All because you wanted to buy it for me. And I was supposed to," Dean sniffled, "-I was supposed to buy you that astronomy book you wanted for months, but I couldn't, because I wasted my money buying a gift for someone who didn't even matter to me, and I kept thinking of how I," Tears streamed down Dean's face, and Castiel found himself in awe of Dean having let his guard down, "-how I pushed you away, and how I
A sharp slap struck his cheek, and his head swirled, face stinging with searing hot pain as he struggled to regain his vision. Tears brimmed at his eyes, and he let them slip through as the ropes swung his weak body to the side. The force of a single slap had shaken Castiel to the core, but somehow, the one, single touch of the demon had now made Castiel realise.
"The best part about that picture was that every Christmas, my brother and I would change the picture to one of the Beatles, and we’d change it back every New Year’s Eve. We used to think we were so slick, but I'm pretty sure mom knew."
A loud hum floats across the room in agreement, before Dean’s voice becomes breezy and he chuckles to himself.
"Oh, yes, just now."
"Hm?"
Castiel paused, and fluttered his eyes open. He caught his fat, plump bottom lip between his teeth and gazed up at Dean with the softest of looks.
"So," Castiel starts, nipping at Dean's jaw, "-where are we going?"
Castiel sighed, and rolled his eyes, slipping his hands into Dean's jacket, and wrapping his cold fingers around the warm coffee paper-cup.
And in the night, Dean feels peace. In Castiel's arms, he feels content.
There’s truth to his words, so Dean quirks his bottom lip, nodding his head as he takes another swig.
"Are you not happy, Dean?"
Claire, now six, was their first daughter, whose custody had shifted from Jimmy, Castiel's twin, to Castiel, after a horrific accident that took both Jimmy and his wife's lives almost five years ago. Castiel had been inconsolable. He'd slipped into a state where he barely ate, barely slept, barely spoke, and remained numb as ever. Dean had been there for him, every step of the way, but so had Claire. She'd taken to him like a fish to water, despite somehow having known that Castiel wasn't her own father.
"I love you too."
It was unlike Castiel had ever felt before. It was as if he meant nothing to Dean but a hole to fuck and breed, and something about the feral, unhinged way Dean fucked into him, absolutely brutal and ruthless, it only had Castiel leaking from the tip of his soft cock as he slammed his fists against the metal door and let out loud, obscene moans, unable to breathe as Dean's tongue choked him.
Dean's voice had gone low and guilty, confusing Castiel to say the least, and without any preamble, Dean had hung up.
"You're going to hate me for this, but this reminds me of—"
Beautiful, white petals fall through the sky, touching the ground with feather-light touches, and Castiel's lips fall open in awe.
"Jealous?" Castiel scoffs, "-why would I be jealous? Not like we're dating or something."
But then again, the other half of Castiel's mind, the one dominated by his instincts and his biology, and his feelings urged him to accompany the alpha. After all, he smelt like safety and heaven, like the ocean and like the wide skies, and try as hard as Castiel could, he wouldn't be able to step down from his commitment.
Dean had found an angel for himself. An angel who made him laugh, an angel whose smile brightened the universe, whose voice was as lovely as a harp, and whose heart was large and full of joy, nothing like Castiel's— whose heart was weak, shriveled with envy, anger, and unspoken words.
"But, but it's mine."
"Say something," Dean says, his voice soft, urging.
the pie you want is in
"What?" Blue asks, notably confused.
It had been one such winter where he'd first met Dean.
"You're thinking," Dean notes, quite aptly at that, and he steps closer to Castiel, strangely casual as he takes Castiel's hands into his own. His eyes fix onto Castiel with utmost focus, as if nothing else exists in the universe, and even if it did, Dean wouldn't bother about it.
Dean's tongue tightened around Castiel's neck, and he realised, in his hazy mind, this was it.
When Castiel had first laid eyes on him at the adoption facility, he'd fallen in love. After Dean, after Claire, he wasn't sure if he'd be able to fall in love with someone else they way he did before, but boy was he wrong. Because the moment Jack reached his arms out to Cas, giggled and wiped his drool across Castiel's shoulder, Castiel decided this was it. He would never have to look further. Dean had been hesitant, but one look at Jack, and he'd been as much as a goner as Castiel.
And then he feels it.
"Merry Christmas," he whispered into the silence, as Dean turned away, not sparing him another glance. Lisa, bless her soul, hugged Castiel, commenting strangely on how nice his shampoo smelt, but Castiel couldn't be less bothered. Dean had walked away. And he hadn't turned back.
but like, part of me also hates
"Shit," Dean groans as he pinches the bridge of his nose and rubs his eyes, heaving a deep breath before dropping his phone onto the counter.
"You don't love me, Dean. I'm a liability to you. You don't mean it."
Silence follows Dean's words. All his doubts and thoughts seem to vanish. He doesn't know why he told Blue his name, or what he's saying. All he knows is
the neighbourhood council, Dean, they want you to move in as soon as possible, preferably within two weeks. There's a lot of crap going on government policies, 'cause you know, the establishments are old, the people are old. And they're saying you either utilize the house or give it up for sale."
is the thing Dean needs to take his mind off because he averts his gaze with slight regret.
"Over where?"
There is palpable warmth exuding off Castiel's skin, and it almost tickles the hair on Dean's arm, but before Dean can think of it, Castiel turns, and it appears to take him much effort to do so.
Castiel had been unconscious for four hours.
alone, with a sick, disgusting psychopath at that, and somehow he realised he didn't care anymore.
Right as Castiel was turning to Dean to retort, the large, broad rosewood doors a few feet from them clicked and creaked open, and from within them, stepped out a man, a tall, gangly, lanky young man dressed in trousers and a sweater, with a muffler sitting atop his head. Upon seeing Dean and Castiel, his demeanor lit up into a bright, excited one, and he scurried over towards Dean.
"But there's so many reasons for you to not like me," he stammers.
"You ready?"
"I am willing to return Castiel to you. But you must prove to me, Dean Winchester, if
"Hey, hey, hey, hold it," the alpha said. Castiel turned around once again to face the alpha, whose eyes now peered into Castiel's. A meek, flustered expression spread across the alpha's face, and his freckled cheeks flared up with a soft red tint. The alpha turned his eyes away as if somehow caught off-guard by Castiel's mere presence, prompting Castiel to narrow his eyes at him.
"Then stay. It's as easy as that."
Silence falls upon them for a few seconds.
"Grandpa? Really?" Dean scoffs, shaking his head with a grin.
"Hey, hey, no crying sweetheart, you promised, no crying," Dean whispers, and at once, his nose is pressed against Castiel's cheek, lips barely brushing over Castiel's as a sob slips past his lips.
"Anytime," Dean says, glancing at the clock. "-Man, the electrician was supposed to be here at four. It's literally half past five right now."
"You'll call? Promise?" he croaks, his voice broken as he sniffles, and wipes his tears against Dean's shoulder. A warm hand braces the back of his head, stroking through his hair, and Castiel lets out another sob, his lips trembling, eyes swollen, face damp.
"Mm, such a good boy for me. Tell you what, how about I cream your little hole? Would you like that? If I fucked you full of my come?"
At once, Dean is aware of the silence between them, of the sound of nothingness inside his ears as he stares at Castiel, stares at this man who Dean is torn between wanting to kiss and wanting to punch.
Castiel grins, a smug, taunting grin, even though Dean can’t see it.
A glance upwards answered every single question in Castiel's mind.
"Hate you? Hating you is the last thing I'd ever do, Cas."
"The wardings outside the warehouse, how did you break through them?"
They should have killed him.
"Sammy–" he yells, not bothered about how broken it sounds, because right there, trembling on the bed beneath him, is his angel, his best friend, the love of his life, and feelings be damned, at that moment, Dean needs Sam to help him, to tell him Castiel will be alright because he can't afford to lose Cas. He simply can't.
"Why aren't you with her?"
"You could've said anything. You could've shouted at me. Over and over again. As long as I got to hear you, I wouldn't have cared."
He deserved it after all.
He's feeling something right now that he hasn't felt since he was twenty-nine.
A silence lulls them both and Castiel blows out a soft, shaky breath before allowing his eyes to flutter open.
"Nothing, nothing at all. " He clears his throat. "What was she like?"
But Castiel's plan had completely slipped out of hand.
"Good afternoon,” the man says, “-did you sleep well last night?"
"No, not at all."
Castiel sways on his feet, gently, and it's as if his body works in tune with the violin, swaying to the right on a high note, slumping forward on a low note, and Dean finds himself hypnotized by the sound of the music thrumming under his skin, reverberating off the walls, and spiralling within his mind. Castiel is focused on the movement of his fingers, and the room surges with the melody. The tune is hopeful at times, but also gut-wrenching. It brings to Dean's mind visions of cold, stormy nights, of loss, betrayal, helplessness, but it also shows him images of love, of sunrises, of ecstasy.
"About five years ago, I played for my mother the night before she passed."
"This is inappropriate—"
"I've never given
An hour from now, Castiel will be in his one-room apartment. No trace of Dean around him. And he knows he'll be in his bed. Curled up in his comforter. Too numb to move.
Castiel hands the violin back to him, and sits down at the sofa.  "We practiced the first verse on Tuesday, and you know the song is short, the verse is repeated. But what matters is your technique. I want it to be smooth, alright?"
The scent of slick hit Castiel's nose before he could even
"Hey, buddy, what's wrong?" Dean asks, his eyes growing wide as he stares down at the angel.
I don’t understand why you’re leaving early?”
"Not that kind of hungry, sweetheart," Dean chuckled, and leaned into nuzzle his nose against Castiel's soft, smooth cheek. The catboy purred with content, and ran his fingers through Dean's hair. Dean breathed in the fruity scent of his body wash, and trailed his lips down Castiel's face until they were brushing against the catboy's lips.
A smile graces Castiel’s lip at that.
"Coming," Dean growled into Castiel's ear, his monstrous, vicious voice sending a shiver running down Castiel's spine, and Castiel clenched down on Dean's cock, sucking him in deeper, until Dean slammed so deep, Castiel felt his gut rupture, and his chest crashed into the metal door.
"You don't need to apologize; it was my fault. I was so confident that I couldn't make a mistake, and well, I was wrong. And you helped me realize that, no matter how surprising my student and I found your, erm, bizarre medium of communication."
Castiel's lips trembled, and his eyelashes fluttered as he struggled to restrain his tears. He cowered, hiding within his own shoulders, reminding himself not to cry in front of Dean, because he knew if he started, he wouldn't be able to stop, and look, he'd made a mess already, when all he wanted was to make Dean happy. But as always, he'd ended up disappointing Dean, making him angry, ruining his cheery mood.
"Castiel? Never heard that one before. Is it exotic?"
"I will."
"Fix Lights."
And it was then that Castiel realised, he was
"It's just me, Cas. Just me," Dean assures, and their eyes meet. Something reaffirming blooms within Castiel, and Dean can see it in the way his eyes glisten with conviction and he bites down on his lip, nodding his head, as he sets the violin back on his shoulder.
Dean.
He recoils with a laugh.
Dean dismisses his thoughts and turns to the microwave, grabbing the warm box of takeout and shutting the microwave door with his shoulder. He makes his way into the living room, where the central air conditioning has broken down, and grabs a towel to wipe some sweat off his bare chest. The man Dean had called last night had said he'd be here by four at the latest. One of the women in the apartment had lent him the number, so he didn't quite know much about the man's credentials. But who cares? He's a fricking electrician and Dean needs his air conditioning fixed.
"The song, it's ‘Ramble
"Cas, what about—"
"What?" Dean gasps, eyes gaping as he processes Sam's words.
Dean pushes himself to stand, but right as he's shifting the chair, a soft thump on the wall draws his attention and he hears Blue say, in the softest voice, "I won't ditch you, promise."
The coachman nodded, and Castiel watched as he carried two suitcases at once, one in both hands, up the short flight of marble stairs, and kept them leaning against the stony, firm wall of the manor beside the large rosewood door. He traveled back and forth a few times, but Castiel couldn't pay him much attention, especially when Dean pressed a kiss to his jaw.
It overwhelms Dean.
To inspect further, Dean walked towards the kitchen, but the moment his eyes wandered inside, he froze.
Wait a moment. Blue? Does that mean...? Does that mean Mr.Green sent this package?
"It's weird. I mean, I don't know, I don't want you to watch me read one."
"Ketchup."
“Yeah?” he answers, noting how Blue’s voice has gone gentle, and that he no longer uses the word ‘
"You can send word through Mildred, or ya' can telephone me if you need anything. The telephone line has been fixed for ya'. G'day sir."
"Well then, Mr.Green, we must cherish ‘every minute of every hour’."
"Funnily enough, I never felt the one before this pass at all,” Castiel says, a reminiscent tone to his voice. And it's true. One day, it had been mid-October, preparations for Halloween and fall around the corner, and the next moment, he’d woken up to a pleasant December morning.
Now, Dean isn't one to invade someone's privacy, but when this certain
“I think I might cry a little,” Blue says, prompting Dean to smile. Blue’s ability to simply speak his mind is something Dean truly admires. Something he wishes he could have as well.
"Dean?" Castiel asks, breaking his silence at last, "-what's wrong with Sam?"
"Yes..."
"Don't leave, not so soon–"
"It won't be the same."
Sincere eyes gaze up at Dean, and he sucks in a sharp breath, once again stumped by the sheer reality of their circumstances— knowing Castiel is here, that he can kiss him, touch him, hold him, love him to his heart's extent— that he was moments away from losing Castiel, and it would have been his fault for loving Castiel too much.
With urgency in every action, Dean reached for Castiel's shirt, rucking it up and pressing it to Castiel's lips.
Round, blue eyes peer up at him, soft plush lips parted with uncertainty, and messy black hair swaying in the breeze greets Dean. Unable to swallow the lump in his throat, Dean finds himself speechless as he stares at the man in front of him.
"Need another one, baby?"
Or at least it did, until Dean decided to move away so soon. Castiel is in love with someone who doesn't love him back, easy as that. They're friends, best of friends, but, sadly, that's all they are
"Sure."
Dean's hand travels up to Castiel's face, and his fingers graze against Cas's lips.
"We're going to be late, now, come on," he grumbled after a few minutes, and walked around the car to slip into the driver's seat. Castiel stepped inside, slipping in next to him, and although silence prevailed between them, the strangeness between them had dissipated as Dean turned up the radio. In the meanwhile, Castiel's eyes wandered outside the window, where the first few traces of winter were evident.
a kitten too? What then? How am I supposed to show you? Or tell you?"
"Sam," Dean starts, huffing out a chuckle, "-thinks we're cuddling."
"Dean—"
Dean's voice was hoarse from slumber, and it thrummed under Castiel's skin.
"Yes, please."
His fingers push Castiel's shirt off his shoulder on one side, allowing Dean much more bare expanse to smother with kisses and faint reddish bite marks.
"So beautiful for me, omega," Dean groaned above him, and Castiel looked up at him. This time, their eyes met and Castiel felt himself rooted in place, mouth still working Dean's cock to the edge but their gazes fixed upon each other.
With that, Castiel turns away, taking a step forward towards the entrance to his apartment, but a hand on his shoulder stops him.
He was bigger than Castiel had ever seen, larger, thicker than Castiel could have ever imagined, and every nerve in Castiel's body throbbed, imagining the feel of the cock inside his tiny, virgin hole. A knock on the side of his house drew him out of his stupor, and he stared up at Dean with his big, round blue pleading eyes.
Dean wasn't at home anymore. He'd had to leave two days ago for a business trip to New York, which meant Castiel had been left to himself. At first, his heat showing up when he was alone seemed almost perfect. He had the house to himself, and Dean would come back a week later, which meant Castiel's heat would have passed by then.
"I asked you why you still live by your father's words. The hurtful ones. Do you think he'd want that?" Dean smiles, walking into his kitchen, phone wedged between his neck and shoulder.
"A very handsome lumberjack, though," Dean scoffs, and Castiel bites back a grin as he crosses a leg over the other in his seat.
"Sure. Oh, and by the way, you should go check out the dude next door. Voice sounded hot." Jack winks, and Castiel glares at him, an amused glint in his eyes as he turns Jack around and nudges him towards the door.
Dean takes it as a sign for more.
For a fraction of a second, time stills around him.
"She's very pretty."
With a sigh, Castiel shuts his door behind him and walks inside. He only gets a few steps further before a loud knock rings through the room, and, on reflex, he looks to the wall.
"Hold on a second,” he says. “Why didn't you make a career out of your music? Why be a nurse? It's honestly more confusing than me joining the Corps."
. Reason enough to not like me?"
"Cas, I just wanna' sleep."
Dean doesn't respond for a moment.
Dean went silent, and their words hung heavy in the air, waiting to be continued, but all Castiel could do was watch as tears poured down Dean's face— Dean, who was brave and strong, who always looked out for Castiel, who always stood up for him, whose courage never wavered— Dean was crying, and it was all Castiel's fault.
"You," Castiel grits out, "
Green asks, his voice a notch higher with enthusiasm.
"I've put some lunch outside your door for you," Castiel says. Although he doesn't receive an answer, he does hear the door to the flat next to him open and shut a few seconds later.
Castiel's voice draws Dean out of his stupor, and he blinks once, meeting Castiel's concerned eyes. The silence in the room is unparalleled, and Castiel's voice, although soft and weak, sounds like a knife cutting through the silence.
"Cas, I
"Right," Garth nodded, "-i'll keep that in mind."
Not a moment later, the Empty's voice narrates once again, resounding through Dean's mind.
"Thanks, sweetheart, it's been quite a while since I sang, or played. Didn't really expect to get back into music for a stranger."
Maybe not. Who knows?
"Hmm?"
"Eh, I guess. I wanted to leave something for you to remember me by. It's too early to say that at this point, but it's inevitable, that's for sure."
"What's happening?" he asks, his voice losing its calm every passing second.
"Off you go, you little brat."
"Shut up,” The man gasps.
"Too big to be a house, though, isn't it?" Castiel mused, as he followed Garth up the flight of stairs. Before he could even take another step up, Dean was by his side, holding him by the waist and guiding him.
Castiel grumbles to himself
"Oh?"
Wind gushes through the windows. Mighty and daunting.
"In a while. Besides, I get my four hours, I'm good for the day."
I wanted to ask you something."
"Is this how you speak to your teacher?" Castiel feigns an offended gasp, leaning back into the soft cushions, as he crosses a leg over the other.
kind of nurse voice?"
"You're going to kill me now, aren't you?" Castiel asked, his voice a notch lower.
"I won't be here long, Cas. Just needed to see you."
"You'll stay tomorrow, right Dean?"
"No, no, it's not. I'm sorry, Dean, please— it hurts so much—"
, their anonymity is essentially where the fun lies.
"You really are a slut, aren't you?"
A sharp silence meets Dean's ears in response and he sighs, popping the cap open before pressing the beer bottle to his lips. He puts the call on speaker and sets his phone down on the counter. Gulp after gulp after gulp, he downs at least half of the bottle in a single go and hisses when the bottle falls away from his lips.
"You haven't orgasmed, yet."
"I was right. Your neighbour was right. Sometimes, you just have to admit defeat." Jack says, a pleased tone to his voice as he holds his hands out.
"Cas."
"Yeah, that guy. Play me something like that."
being a tiny, black French maid outfit.
"Oh," Castiel croaked out, feeling his throat dry and his chest constrict.
"I said she's gone."
"God, you are, aren't you? Hey, I'm so sorry, I never thought it would hurt you so much
Castiel's bright blue eyes light up at that, and he nods excitedly.
"Worse. I'm going to give you freedom, angel."
"Yes, well," Castiel starts with a smile, "
“Hmm,” Dean scoffs. “
In twenty-three minutes flat, Castiel is packing a container full of ravioli and roasted vegetables and leaving it outside the door of Mr.Green's flat and once back inside, he knocks on the wall.
Dean fidgets with the fabric of the blanket beside him, his throat constricted now that he has to break the real news to Castiel. Now that he has to come clean. Now that he has to be honest.
“I haven’t played it in ages,” Green muses, and Castiel hums with a quirk of his lips.
“I… what?” Blue finally asks, his voice softer.
Green hums, his husky, sleep-soaked voice churning withing Castiel's guts.
"But I'm going to be bored without you." Green whines, loud and clear and it draws a chuckle from Castiel.
"I love you too Dean, always have. Always will."
"There's nothing—," Green sighs, but Castiel senses mischief lacing his words. "-Ah, you're cute, Blue."
A loud ruffling noise draws Dean out of his reverie and he opens his eyes.
Because then, in that one, single moment, Dean is saying
Dean asks, expectant and waiting, and Castiel notes he hasn't even touched his own burger— strange considering how big of a foodie Dean is.
"Calculated guess." Castiel snorts, and hears the slight thwomp of something solid hitting something soft.
Castiel coaxes, his own lips quivering at the sight of Dean so broken. He nudges Dean's hands away from his face, and leans down to cradle Dean's face close to his chest, hands threading through Dean's hair, as he gives Dean's shoulder a soft squeeze.
,' Bobby's words echo through Dean's mind, loud and clear, but instead of feeling his usual emptiness, Dean finds himself hoping.
“Sweetheart, I’m telling you
"Amen."
of your own house and get to have a job—"
"It's funny because… Well, now that I think of it, the things he said to me, they never really changed the truth, did they? And now, I realize, I still managed to recall his words every time I found myself attracted to a man." He scoffs, eyes wandering down to the bottle of beer in his lap. "
It was the final class for the day, and although Castiel wasn't always particularly early, since Dean had always found ways to dilly-dally before, he decided today he'd grab a seat at the class sooner, maybe catch up with some reading for a few minutes before the rush poured in. And so, he'd made his way to room 4A, the last classroom on the ground floor, which was at the very end of the hallways, and he'd dug out a book, a Dan Brown novel, and he'd headed over to the end of the hallways, when at once, the sound of laughter floating out from classroom 4A caught his attention, and he stood rooted to the ground, before another laugh echoed through the room.
It's as if his body doesn’t work at his volition anymore, because Castiel can't move, can't walk, can't speak. His throat is dry, his legs are stuck to the ground, but the world is moving, more importantly, Dean is moving,
"Some of us," Dean started, grabbing the coffee out of Castiel's hand, "—actually decided to wear long sleeves."
"Well, dearie, it's rather simple. I'd say, the simplest cure ever. But for poor, emotionally constipated Dean, I think it would be rather tough."
A few moments later, when Dean unlocked the door and stepped inside, the sound of bustling footsteps clamouring through the house met their ears, and without a single thought, they knew who it was.
"Bu—but master..."
And then, after Castiel wakes up at three on the dot, every afternoon, he'll knock on the wall, yell out a ‘
"I'll leave you out some lunch if you want."
than what you did, okay? You made some very unfortunate mistakes, and yes, you must be paying for them, if your overall anxiousness and all your sleepless nights and breakdowns, which by the way, I hear very distinctly in my bedroom at two in the morning every Sunday are any indications."
With a grin of his own, Castiel walks to his kitchen. He switches his radio on, letting a random channel play, as he grabs a few vegetables, some ravioli pasta, and a sauté pan. He's used to cooking for himself in doubles, since it serves him as dinner as well as his meal at the hospital. Before he knows it, the sauté pan is simmering with a thick tomato purée, and he adds in some spices, seasonings and some shredded chicken before moving onto the pasta. His fridge isn't particularly stocked, but he does have a few things he can work with, so he grabs a few more vegetables and pops them in the oven to roast them.
"Well, I bet you'll be happy to know I haven't heard this one."
"So you're not going to speak," Dean stated, more to himself, before he nodded, and held the blade up to his face, his eyes tracking the sharp, ridged edge of it, before meeting Castiel's eyes, "— and all those demons, hah, more like a pathetic excuse for a demon, tried to make you talk. But I bet they couldn't do, what I'm going to do to you, angel."
pass out
"Uhm, none except my own." He answered, candidly, earning a wide-eyed stare from Dean.
"Maybe I could use some of that coffee you were brewing. But don't think I'm gonna' change my mind when I'm sober. I mean it. Move in with me."
"It's a long story. Are you sure you won't fall asleep?"
Castiel wondered, "-for running away. I thought you'd be happier."
"Not mine."
"Boy," Mr. Kreschner starts, "
This was wrong.
"I know what a long-distance relationship is, Dean."
sort of friction against his aching, ruined cock.
and he falls back against the wall. "Oh, thank the Lord. I couldn't agree more. I mean, small talk is great, to an extent, because it's an effective icebreaker, but once you're past the basics? Who cares? I don't know if it's just me, but unless the conversation holds some sort of substance, I don't think I can keep myself engrossed."
"It's only been about three-quarters of an hour, how could I forget?" Castiel snorts.
"Sure. Go straight home, okay? Message me if you need anything." Castiel smiles, claps Jack on the shoulder, and watches as the boy walks out the door with a smile, waving back at Castiel.
I thought if you didn’t know, we could spend this last week just the way things are, y’know, without you worrying about me leaving.”
"Hi Cas." Dean mumbles, trying to refrain the smile on his face.
He didn’t feel months pass by with Dean by his side, how can he expect to appreciate these six
It must be something in the air that changes, because Castiel's smile is dwindling, and Dean is moving, closer and closer, and he can hear the slow rhythm of Castiel's breath, he can feel the warmth of Castiel's breath on his cheek, and blue, electrifying blue is entrancing him. His lips part in anticipation, and his head tips to the side as his eyes slip shut. There are slender, fingers wrapping around his arm, tugging him closer, as the distance between his lips and Castiel's diminishes, but in a single second, something clicks within Dean's mind, something Sam said.
Something terrifying.
"Thank you."
have been by his current state, he found he rather liked being fingered open with his
Green?"
"I don't care."
"Well—" Sam shrugs, fixing Dean with an understanding look, that does little to sooth the turmoil within his mind, "-talk to Cas. He needs you right now, Dean, much more than he's ever needed you before."
"What's your name?" the demon asked, as he stepped forward towards Castiel, and ran a finger down Castiel's cheekbone. An action which should have been affectionate had disgust curling through Castiel's veins, and he turned his head away. If the demon wanted answers, he'd come to the wrong place. Castiel wasn't giving up until they killed him. He would die a loyal martyr to Heaven.
"What a coincidence. It seems I may have fallen in love with you too, Sir Winchester."
Must be nice, having a mother who calls in to check on you. Ever since his own mother passed a few years ago, things haven't been the same for Dean. And yet, even now, he recalls his mother: a warrior on the field, but a young, beautiful woman at home. He remembers her in her frilly little sundresses and her matching broad headbands, how she'd bake pie each Sunday, and how she'd play with Dean at the park when he was young.
"What hurt the most, omega?" Dean asked, his voice as gentle as rain— so reassuring— as he laid Castiel down on the bed and settled between his spread legs. Castiel felt no shame, none whatsoever, as he spread his legs open wide on the bed and put his slick, tight pink hole on display. Dean's eyes darkened at the sight, and he sucked in a deep breath before licking his lips. The scent of alpha arousal filled the air and coursed through Castiel's senses.
’ fills Dean's ears, and he sways his head, bouncing his leg under the desk as he smiles, muttering the words to himself. In hasty, unbothered handwriting, Dean scribbles down the date:
"What do you think about Somerset? Think it's a good place to raise a pup?" Dean asked, a clear mischief lacing his voice, and Castiel sighed.
With an uncertain coil in his gut, Castiel steps to the wall, leaning closer until his face is inches from the wallpaper.  "Hello?"
don't think you're going to like that, angel. So, from the top. What's your name?"
And what losing Castiel meant to him.
Dean doesn't answer, neither does he make an effort to move, so Castiel stays put in his arms.
"Fuck," Dean groaned, rocking his hips and fucking into Castiel's hole, making sure Castiel could feel every thrust and drag. He slid a hand up and crept it under his blouse, caressing his chest until he could feel the tiny nub of Castiel's nipple brush against his finger. At the first touch, Castiel let out a breathy moan, and Dean watched as his eyes rolled to the back of his head before fluttering shut. From where Dean was watching, Castiel looked nothing short of an X-rated movie star, body jerking with every thrust, mouth hung open, eyes shut and hands holding his legs open like the perfect whore. The thought only spurred Dean on, and he found himself going faster, harder— fucking into Castiel's hole with a newfound vigour and pinching his nipples between his fingers.
It's by—"
"Buh-bye teacher," she says, and Castiel grins.
A monster.
"Oh god, you're talking about the note. Jesus, that was cringey, wasn't it?"
"Hey, are you crying?"
Dean can see it's taking Castiel a lot of effort to speak, but it's far too important to know what has been troubling Castiel, what is causing him, an
A silence follows their words, and both men simply take a moment to drink in the feeling of laughing with each other. Castiel is right about to speak up, ask about Dean’s plans for the day, when the loud, prominent ringing of Dean's phone travels from the other apartment.
"It's gorgeous, ain't it?"
The point here being, Rowena wasn't Dean. She wouldn't know what each moment Dean spent with Castiel meant to him.
Castiel's heated, moist hole swallowed Dean up without hesitation, and Dean gripped the boy's hips to steady himself as he rocked his hips forward and pushed in, feeling Castiel's constricted, fleshy walls open up around his cock until he finally bottomed out.
Castiel's eyes wander up to gouge Dean's expression, and their eyes meet. Dean notes the deep, red tint spread flush across Castiel's face and neck, and wonders how he never noticed Castiel's blush before. It's beautiful, and Dean wants it to never fade away, especially if it means Castiel is always content. Dean grins, and runs a hand through Castiel's hair, urging him to keep going, but when Castiel drops his mouth open and flicks his tongue against the slit of Dean's cock, it becomes too hard altogether to keep himself balanced on the bed. Not only is the flick extremely teasing, but it's the look in Castiel's eye. Coy. Innocent. Pure. And then there's his tongue. Sinful. Filthy. Sloppy.
As he looks up, swiping a few tears away on the back of his palm, he feels a sudden surge of pain in the back of his head. Sleep has drained from the entirety of his being, leaving him fatigued and hazy, and he staggers over to his bookshelf, hand reaching out to support himself as he walks. Teary eyes regard the bookshelf, and absently, he finds his fingers tracing along the spine of a row of books, only stopping when it reaches one particular book. He hooks his fingers around the spine of the book and digs it out of the shelf, grazing his hand over the front.
The fingers running through Dean's hair come to a halt, and he shuts his eyes, not wanting to meet Castiel's confounded face in that moment.
, Dean muses, but to his astonishment, it doesn't.
Upon Castiel's silence, Dean asked again, furious now, his eyes wide and his face red with anger, "-how did you fucking buy it, Cas?"
"I know, I know, I'm on your side, man, and it's a good thing they haven't taken it to court
(See the end of the chapter for
"Cas," Dean chokes out, one last attempt to stitch the frayed bond between them, but Castiel doesn't move.
I only found out a few days ago, alright? And I didn’t want to tell you ‘cause I didn’t want to hurt you. I didn’t want you to feel upset, I
At once, Dean falls back down on something firm, something moving, and he turns around, stunned to find himself sitting atop Castiel's chest, who simply fixes him with a stoic look, and with a soft, mumbled apology, Dean pushes himself up to his feet, right when Sam holds his gun up to the witch's head, and—
Dean begins, but is cut off by Blue speaking up again, his voice higher and keen.
"Why me?"
At once, Dean's eyes widen with childish excitement, and he grins large and proud as he glances back at Castiel.
"Oh, you were, were you?"
"It's ready, Dean. A month before the due date. You can move in now, or whenever you want."
With every passing word, a smile grows on Castiel's lips. When he finishes reading, he folds the note with as much caution as he can and sets it down on the coffee table before reaching for the package. The letter made it clear Mr.Green has sent him a book; now the question eating away at Castiel— which book is it?
. Remember our deal," the Empty's laughter fades out, once again surrounding Dean with a deafening silence.
Dean laughs, but his fingers reach up to his face. Mindlessly, he traces his thumb down the scar that runs down from the top of his right eyebrow to the bottom of his left cheek. The raised skin doesn't hurt any longer, but the touch of his thumb to the scar reminds him of a time he despised looking at his face. A constant reminder of one of Dean's deadliest combat experiences.
Castiel's heart thumped louder in his chest with every moment that the alpha leaned in closer to him. Broad, sweaty hands gripped the side of his waist, and Castiel's shoulders tensed up with a strange rigidity as the alpha leaned into the crook of his neck.
Dean's fingers run through Castiel's hair one last time as he dives down for a kiss.
"Kid? Really?" Blue parrots his words, and Dean finds the grin at his lips broadening.
"Well, what do you want me to say? You know I don't do small talk,"
"Y—yes master," Castiel whimpered, as Dean crooked his fingers inside Castiel, and the catboy's back curved beautifully as he let out a moan and gripped Dean's shoulder tighter, riding his master's fingers with vigour and enthusiasm, as Dean kissed his his jaw. Dean brought a hand up to brush it through Castiel's hair, grazing it over his ear on accident, which twitched and Castiel groaned.
Castiel groans, as he slips his arm around Dean's neck and pulls him into a kiss.
Castiel's mouth drops open, his eyes narrowed for a moment. He stands, awestruck, before a strange, bemused smile tugs at his lips. "How'd you know that?"
Dean swallows.
"The cook, Mrs. Mildred, she'll be here in the evening. She has a key to the house already, so don't jump if ya' find the lady in the kitchen. Besides that, if you need anything, let me know. I'll be right at yer' service."
"You– shit, you're burning up, Cas,
"Master, oh please, I'm going to come," Castiel gasped, and Dean thought he'd combust with how fucking horny he was. In response, he simply grunted, and continued to fuck into Castiel's wide, pink hole, watching the flesh open up so invitingly for Dean, as his cock slid in and out in measured, long thrusts.
Dean asked for his jacket back.
"You want to put this on me? Really? When I'm trying to look out for
I hear?"
"Castiel. Castiel Novak."
And then he felt it.
"You're thinking too hard," Sam says, bringing Dean out of his thoughts. Dean blinks his eyes up to meet Sam's, before furrowing his eyebrows in a questioning look.
"Cas?" He calls out, leaning in towards the door, hoping for a response.
"Alright, play whatever you want. Besides,” Dean admits, “-I've been meaning to watch you play since the moment I knocked on that wall."
"You're like a Saturday, Dean."
"You're staring."
childish and unbelievably endearing. But Castiel now finds, he seamlessly fits into Castiel's routine, and has become a part of his life in ways Castiel could never have imagined before.
"Turn around, I want to see your face."
"Oh, I keep my classes on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and the weekends. I have a few children coming in tomorrow. They're cute.  think the oldest is eight and the rest are six and seven."
"Lisa must be looking for you," Castiel croaked out, plucking Dean's arms off his body and turning away, "-You should get back to her."
"It does fit quite appropriately," Castiel remarks as he steps away from the wall.
There it was. Castiel's sob story. He'd learnt to ignore his feelings, push them down, not ponder upon them.
"I wish I could stay," Dean mumbles, a few seconds after they pull away.
No. Dean Winchester is a lone, cold winter's night. He doesn't deserve someone as loving as a mellow pink, spring morning.
"The curse that hit me, it's called the kiss of death."
It isn't even the notion of Dean leaving that saddens him. It's the fear of never hearing from Dean again, never hearing his laugh, never hearing him crack his lame jokes, never sharing his deepest thoughts with Dean in the late hours of the night when their voices have dwindled into hushed whispers, never having someone to cook for, to read poems to again.
"That's good."
At last, he wills himself to turn, to face Castiel, to feel, to say, to—
"Definitely not. Maybe we'll just have to go at it again."
"Right now? It's big." Dean quirked his lip, but flipped the gift over to find a corner he could rip open.
"So, what'll you do when you get back to Lawrence?"
His fists clench around the steering wheel, and he lets his head drop against the front of it, tears streaming down, one after the other.
"She is, isn't she," Castiel sighed under his breath, and plucked his books and binders out of Dean's hands, while Dean still stood frozen, rooted to the ground, mouth hung agape and eyes bulging out of their sockets. He wasn't the only one enchanted by Lisa though, the other boys were too. And had Castiel been attracted to women, he would be too. She was simply put, gorgeous.
"You, erm, you'd be alright with
"I won't ask again—"
A dark laugh fell from Dean's lips, and although it only caused a single glint of fear to rise through the back of Castiel's mind, it was overwhelmed by the pure arousal he felt at his alpha's words. Christ, Castiel could s
"But wait," Sam interjects, and all eyes turn to him, "- if Dean was the one hit by the spell, why is Castiel the one suffering? Isn't Dean the one who should be in pain?"
"Well, I didn't believe in true mates."
The melody breaks off as the loud whoomping noise draws both Castiel’s and his student's attention. At first, Castiel glances at his kitchen, wondering if something dropped from one of the shelves, but Jack nudges his shoulder, tipping his head
"S—so big," Castiel mumbled, as his mouth hung open, legs
"Right, shit, sorry, I came to give you this. Your erm, your Christmas gift. I actually planned for something bigger, but uhm, most of my budget was drained on
"Mr. Green, I talk to you every minute I'm free from work. Is that not enough?" Castiel chuckles, and hears Green give an unsatisfied whine.
"Ye—yes Dean?"
Silence falls upon them, and Castiel pulls his hand out of Dean's. He plucks a sweet potato fry from his plate and pops it in his mouth and they don't speak until Castiel has swallowed it down.
"And you did all that for what? To prove what?
“And you haven’t,
Standing there, under the falling snow, out in the open, buried in each other's arms, Castiel knows they should be more considerate about where they are, but screw the world. Screw it for being so brash, for being so unfair, for taking away from Castiel the one thing he
A deep, searing heat flares Castiel’s cheek as Dean falters and pulls away.
Sam pauses for a moment, pulling back and rubbing at his own hand as he regards Castiel on the bed. Dean simply tugs at the hem of the blanket across Castiel's thigh, and pulls it up to the angel’s chest, unable to help himself as he runs his fingers through Castiel's hair with a gulp.
"Dean?"
"Mind sendin' some over tonight? Oh, hold on, how about I treat you to hamburgers for dinner? Homemade Winchester hamburgers, loaded with cheese, meat and grease. You'll be mourning your arteries for weeks. Will that cheer you up, sweetheart?"
Castiel's little secret. He was utterly, irrevocably in love with his best friend. What a fucking clichè, no?
Part of Castiel wishes he wouldn't wake up soon, wishes Dean would remain snuggled up in his bed, and that Castiel could walk back in, slip under the covers, and curl up in Dean's arms. But part of him knows better.
"Winnie the Pooh," Castiel chuckles, and feels Dean smile against him as he drops a soft kiss over his cheek. He moves away, as if to study Castiel.
"Inside me. Don't pull out. I need to feel you Dean, please."
Castiel pauses.
"In the underworld, Orpheus decided to sing for Hades. Hades wept, his wife, Persephone was deeply touched, and even Cerberus, the gigantic hound guarding the entry to the underworld, covered his many ears with his paws and howled in despair. The voice of Orpheus was so moving that Hades promised to this desperate man that Eurydice would follow him to the Upper World, the world of the living. But," The Empty pauses once again, and yet, the pain in Dean's body grows stronger, has him writhing and weeping, but he doesn't give up— he can't. For Cas, he has to keep fighting on.
"But," he starts, and Castiel slings his backpack over his shoulders, slipping his white sneakers on as he waits for Green to finish. "
Another tear rolls down Dean's face.
"One more question, and I'll give you what you want, alright angel?"
They walk, rather, Castiel drags Dean towards the door, until they're inside the elevator, pressed up against a corner with Dean's hands on Castiel's waist, Castiel's hands on Dean's shoulders, their faces diving in for a kiss, and another, and another.
"No, it's just that I
it. Yet, he couldn't get enough of it. Somewhere along wanting to be freed and wanting to be fucked, Castiel lost himself in the feeling of being the centre of Dean's attention. In the abandoned shack, where he knew no one could find them, Castiel knew he was truly and
Castiel grins, his laughter subduing into a content sigh.  "I tend to remember words better than numbers or anything. Words that people say to me, or words that I read. So, I do remember a lot of quotes."
Perhaps, in hindsight, Castiel should have glanced at his phone. He should have checked his messages, especially the ones where Dean said he'd be coming home that afternoon, since his clients had to leave for an emergency.
I’m not, I’m—"
Feeling bold, Castiel lifted his gaze up at the alpha and gave a firm smile.
The loud call of his name, his nickname, snaps him out of his memories, and for the second time that hour, he realizes he was lost in his memory. Before he can speak, he hears muffled shuffling and for a moment, Dean wonders if Blue is leaving, offended by Dean's frequent zoning out, but a few long seconds later, though, he hears the sound of his ringtone, his phone buzzing on the coffee table a few feet away from him.
"I hope you like it, Green."
‘cause I'd have taken up the case, but all I'm saying is look, it's not like you have anything to do in New York, right? Back in Lawrence you have Bobby's garage, you have people who know you, people you can rely on. And you're a veteran, so double kudos to you. What's the harm in moving in? You have a week or two. And it's closer to California too, Dean."
"Yes, of course. Dean," Castiel says, and his smile widens at the mention of Dean's name.
It's strange how Castiel goes from a mature, wise adviser, to a young, giggly man in seconds, or how he always knows when Dean is upset and leaves a few slices of pie, or some grilled bacon sandwiches outside his door for him. Or the fact that he always knows what to say, even if it's harsh, and not what Dean expects. Somehow, Castiel in his life just
and he shuts his eyes, nodding along to the man's words, despite knowing there's no way the man can see him. "Well, you're probably the only person I've ever spoken to from this apartment, except for the woman who lived there before you. She was sweet, kept to herself. I think she landed a job at Broadway, which is why she moved out."
"The kid's right," a voice, deep and husky, laced with a strong, southern drawl, chimes in from behind the wall, accompanied with a sigh of controlled exasperation.
Castiel laughs. It’s going to be a
"What was that?"
Anything. Castiel would do
A month. It's been a single month since John passed away. There was nothing shocking about it, not in the least. It was cancer, for crying out loud. Stage three pancreatic cancer—
"I love you too, you know that."
"I know. I know, sweetheart."
"Wow, you're taking me to a diner for our first date?" Castiel asks, half-joking, and his eyes fall to where Dean's hand has been rubbing his thigh for the past few minutes.
Around him, soft, mellow, late morning rays filter in through the blinds of Castiel's living room
"I'm not attractive,” he says. “Although I used to be a real charmer."
Castiel gazes out the glass panes at the view of the soothing, pitch-black night sky adorned with sky-scrapers of varied sizes: the picturesque view of a city. In no manner, are the roads abandoned, and the city is as alive at night as it is in the day— livelier, actually.
Blue laughs and the sound thrums under Dean's skin, igniting every fibre of every nerve. A beat passes, filled with nothing but quiet, and Dean takes the moment to allow his eyes to wander outside. From up here, the view isn't the best for there is always a sky-scraper blocking the sun, but Dean can see a few sparrows, their tiny brown wings fluttering as they chirp and fly about a tree from branch to branch.
Disgust and uncertainty twisted through Castiel's gut, crawling under his skin and prickling at his flesh, and the smirk the demon sent him did nothing to hinder the nausea that bubbled inside Castiel. He wanted to throw up, and maybe he would have, had he not been starved for the past three days, his flesh aching and loose. He knew he wouldn't last another day or two, and yet, he wanted to live. The fear of his death made him realise— he had truly turned human.
"You're moving in with me tomorrow."
ordinary people. What you feel for Cas, it's not, it's not shallow, it runs deep, too deep for both of you to understand it. And maybe you never will be able to understand it. But at least, you could try to cherish it." A soft sigh slips past Sam's lips, and although Dean doesn't look up at him, he knows the expression on his brother's face. Empathy. Assurance. However, when Dean glances up at him, he finds himself struck by the sorrow on Sam's face. The subdued envy.
"And you're a pervert," Castiel says tenderly, as he spreads his legs open wide, and presses the back of his hand into his mouth to cover his face. Dean's eyes however, remain transfixed to the sight under him. Slowly, he slides his rough, calloused hands up the prince's smooth, young skin, and crawls over the bed until he's hovering above the prince.
brother back in Lawrence since two-thousand-fifteen."
His hole burned. It stung with every inch Dean pushed in, and Castiel had never more wanted to push something out as much as he wanted to suck it in, and that's precisely what he felt as Dean's cock continued sinking into him, no where near the end even though a solid minute had passed.
"Let's hear it then."
, uhm,
The automated message used to amuse Dean, now it only spurs his frustration, and he groans, watching as the call ends and his phone goes black. His eyes skim over the bare, empty room, over the corners where his desk would be, where his chair would be against the wall, the one he'd sit on and talk to Castiel for hours.
ever will be.
There are words on the tip of Dean's tongue. Words, answers, arguments, assurances, promises.
angel? Maybe because you've been sitting at his bed watching him sleep all day? You haven't had breakfast, haven't had lunch, haven't eaten a single thing. That's how bad you have it for Cas, huh?" Sam asks, a sad but knowing grin pulling at his lips as he leans back against the wall, crossing his arms across his chest. Dean feels himself flush under Sam's words, and he coughs out a
, after all, they were lovers, but he managed to suppress his feelings. But the moment he stepped into the world of the living, and turned to embrace his wife, she vanished in the blink of an eye, and returned to the underworld."
“Dean I—”
"Inias, it was Inias— Dean, please—"
I try to adjust it to my tastes. I prefer the comfort over the show, so you might find a few mismatched things."
A sudden intrusion at his slick hole had Castiel's eyes going wide as he jerked on the seat, holding onto the headrest of the front seat to stable himself.
"Shh," Deanna whispered, gliding her hands over Cas's stomach, up to her naked, round breast, where she pushed away one of Cas's hand, and latched her own instead, pinching the nipple and rolling the nub between her fingers, as she dipped down to capture her mate's lips in a soft, reassuring kiss, only to pull away after a few seconds, "—I'm gonna' make you feel good, yeah baby?"
Nights.
Eyes shut, with unshed tears threatening to trickle down, Dean reminds himself to stop crying.
Dean lingers outside his highness, Prince Castiel's chamber for a few seconds. He's unsure of himself, still in conflicted minds about whether he should be here or not. Surely, the guards he passed don't doubt him at all, they know the bond shared between Dean and Castiel is special; moreso than any knight and Royal blood ever have. Since their adolescence, the two boys have grown together, fought with each other, laughed with each other and cried with each other. Nothing separates them.
Benny laughed, and his breath reeked of alcohol, but Castiel didn't pull away, instead letting himself press into Benny's warmth as he hummed.
"Got possessive?"
"You alright?” Dean asks him, and Sam nods. With a deep breath, Dean claps Sam on the shoulder, and then turns back to Castiel, who stares at Dean with softening eyes.
as his face heats up.
"You should wait."
"Not too far, Dean, I'm not on— I'm not on birth control."
I've fooled around plenty, but I’ve always kept myself from a relationship, y'know? I've dreamt, hell,
"Young and tiny and cute— what a pretty little omega."
"Right now," Castiel mumbled, watching as Dean tore the wrapping paper open and crumbled it in his hand, his eyes widening at the sight before him.
"I got you, baby, I got you." Dean mumbles, on and on, between each kiss. The coherent part of him knows they should stop doing this out here in the open— anyone could walk by and see them sucking each other's faces off— but part of him never wants to stop, wants Dean to touch him, everywhere and anywhere, but when he pulls away to breathe, Dean sits up for good.
"Just you wait, sweetheart, one day, this manor is going to be bustling with people from all across the world. I'll make sure I make the most beautiful hotel I can, and I'll make sure our pup knows just how amazing his father was." Dean laughed, and pulled away at last, helping Castiel up the stairs, who rolled his eyes, and held a hand over his stomach.
"Because I ding-dong-ditched my neighbour."
Absently, Castiel's eyes fell upon the hem of Dean's jacket. Just the sight of it warmed Castiel, and reminded him of how soft it had been, how it had engulfed him with tenderness and love, how Castiel had slept with it for nights, how he had held it close to his chest whenever he could, how he wept a hundred silent tears over the fabric of the jacket, how he craved to be the one Dean wanted, the one who would bring Dean happiness, but Dean had found himself an angel. And her name was Lisa. Castiel wished he was Lisa.
Turns out, Dean is wrong. He doesn't taste like ketchup. He tastes like salty fries.
"I can't wait to show you the inside," he gasped and Castiel grinned at his excitement. The past few weeks had been stressful for Dean, what with having to settle into his new job at the architecture firm, Sandover Company, but Dean had pulled through, and his hard work had borne fruit. He'd been assigned the renovation of an abandoned English country house in the Somerset county of England. Of course, traveling from the States to England had been a bit hectic, if not impromptu, but once they'd arrived, the land had greeted them kindly, and they had melded into the new world with much ease.
"Oh, it's more than alright."
Lunch flows easily with both men speaking at varied points of time, mostly about Green's liking for Italian food, and how Castiel learnt to cook during his days as a college student.
"Just don't, Sam, just don't."
"Oh, by the way, Castiel, you know a good joint to grab some grub on the way? I'm starving. I've been driving here for hours, just to buy this little devil here," Dean said, glancing at the watch on his wrist, before digging his hand into his pockets to fish out his wallet. The picture of a blonde woman and a young child sat snug inside it, but Castiel knew better than to pry deeper.
"Yeah, I guess. Are you going to ask me to go back to her?"
“It’s a long story.”
In goes the snack box, the bottle, and his scrubs, folded up neat inside, as Castiel shakes his head at Green’s eagerness.
"Because I don't think the marks you've left in my life will ever disappear," Castiel answers, sliding his arms around Dean's neck as he reaches up to pull Dean down into a brief kiss.
A loopy grin graces Dean's lips, and he finds himself shutting his eyes and letting Blue's voice drown him.
"I'm close—" Dean mutters into Castiel's ears after a long silence, as their bodies rock together and writhe together on the bed in pleasure, and Castiel nods.
With a shake of his head, Castiel clears his throat and continues—
Unbelievable.
"No, but my break is over. And I need to work. More importantly, you, mister, need to sleep. Alright? So, bye, and good night."
"Don't leave. Please?"
and folds an arm across his chest as he rests against the window sill.
Castiel is a virgin. Perhaps not in the conventional sense, but still.
"Dean—" Castiel moaned out— no, groaned— and it caught Dean off-guard for a moment, but something about Castiel dressed in a maid outfit, bent over Dean's kitchen counter, flashing Dean his cute, white panties and his tiny, pink hole had Dean leaking in his trousers. Without wasting another moment, Dean pulled the pantie aside, shut his eyes and and dove his tongue inside Castiel's hole.
Dean smiles, and slumps down on the chair against the wall.
"Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, ye—"
Christ. Castiel could definitely come on the sight of
"Twenty minutes, alright? We'll drive down to the city. Get you some hamburgers."
The door to Castiel's room clicks open. Dean leads the way for Sam and Rowena to follow, both with a bowl of funky-smelling pulps in their hands. The room is dark, only illuminated by the soft, orange light at the corner, and Dean eyes Castiel, who is still fast asleep on the bed, his back to Dean, but somehow, he appears smaller, weaker than he did in the morning. The blanket is tangled between his legs, and he's curled up against a large, thick pillow.
Alone and tired in his bed, Castiel wants nothing more than to be held. To be loved.
Dean's face lights up at the sound of her name. Mary is his four-year-old niece. She's got green eyes, from their mother, Mary, and with the way she clings to Dean when he's around, it's evident
"Please put your cock inside my dirty, wet hole, Mr. Winchester."
Dean sighs at Castiel's words.
"From when my dad passed."
a sad movie. I guess I would have been around seven or eight, back in ‘ninety-one. I don’t remember it clearly, but I do remember the radio playing Queen for weeks.” Dean glances down at his shut laptop before setting it down next to him and grabbing his beer by the neck of the bottle, taking a swig to soothe his dry throat.
"Cas?" Dean asked, pushing the door open, but Castiel held it ajar, his heart pounding, his breath constricted, his chest tight and heavy— it was nauseating, the scent of fruit and sugar emanating from the couple, and he wanted to turn away and hurl his guts out, but in answer, he simply raised an eyebrow. Dean's eyes narrowed as he studied Castiel, and Castiel felt his skin on fire under Dean's attention, but he quickly cleared his throat and caught Dean's attention.
. Not like he's going to see Dean. With a sigh, Dean lets Castiel lace their fingers, and he feels the tug of Castiel's hand towards him.
"You'll miss me? That's cute." Dean says, a familiar playfulness in his voice.
"Sorry, it's just... I had an argument with my parents this morning. I was tired, it was a hectic shift, I was sleepy, and my mom was being her usual, nagging self."
Uncertain of himself, tears stinging his eyes, Dean holds up his fingers to Castiel's nose, heaving a sigh of selective relief when he feels the soft, slow puffs of air on his skin.
"Don't— don't go, Cas, please—"
But standing here, in the midst of nothing, absolutely nothing, he knows.
Castiel breathes in a quick breath, before flipping through the book and landing on a marked page. He doesn’t recall marking it, but the handwriting at the top of the page is evidently his. Strangely, the words read-
"I don't know. I mean, I want to say something. I just don't know where to start." Castiel sighs and proceeds to take a sip of his coffee.
"Sam, come back, hey, Sammy, we're not–" Dean calls out, but lowers his voice when he notices Castiel wincing, and with a soft sigh, falls back on the bed.
There's something unintentionally childish about the way Castiel says this, and he regrets it at once, unable to apologize as Dean simply fixes him with an appeasing look, not harsh or sarcastic, but something didactic about the way he answers.
Dean gives an indignant groan.  "The air conditioning, it doesn't work. I've been sweating all day."
"Sorry, erm," Dean swallows, finding himself at a loss for words, as he helps Castiel sit up, and pushes himself up as well.
Jack chuckles, raising an uncertain eyebrow as he quirks his lips, and proceeds to mimic Castel’s voice. "I don't know, maybe so you can provide them with an
"Yeah, yeah, I'm right here, I'm right here."
Another.
"Don't you ever feel like pursuing your art? Not everyone can do that, but Blue, you're really special. Haven't you tried joining different orchestras or, I don't know, whatever thingies those musicians join? I mean, the pay wouldn't be as good, but at the end of the day, you'll be doing something you love, right?"
Dean chuckles. "Yeah, uh, it's been years since I slept with someone, I mean,
"Imagination, sugar, imagination."
"What?"
ended up with the mouthy omega." Dean teased, pinching one of Castiel's nipple between his fingers, as he moved lower, towards Castiel's naked, waiting ass.
"Hey, before we forget, pick out a movie, Cas. We watched Pulp Fiction already, right? And Bohemian Rhapsody last Saturday. What do you want to watch tonight?"
"Yes, yes, yes, oh Dean, yes, please, don't go, don't go anywhere, stay with me baby, I need you, I need you so much. I can't do this any more. Promise me you won't leave, promise me Dean," Castiel sobs, his hands cupping Dean's jaw as he bounces, his hips faltering as Dean squeezes his hips, mumbling a string of
With a loud, resonating sigh, Green gives in.
"It's just eight years."
“I don’t know. It’s not something I tell people.”
"What?" Dean scoffs. "
— the usual ensemble of compliments he reserved for a tiny, cute girl he saw sometime, but the words that left Dean's mouth a moment later took Castiel aback.
With a brief smile, Castiel nods, and slips into the jacket. It's a little loose on his shoulders, but apart from that, it fits quite well, and it smells wonderful, just like Dean. Dean on the other hand, quirks his lip and lays a short clap on Castiel's shoulders before grabbing his duffle bags.
as it always does, and Castiel dashes across the floor, walking over to swing the door open.
Before him, stood a large, wide English country-house. A manor, spanning across almost an acre, with miles of deep, gloomy green woods on one side, and a long, gushing stream on the other, where Castiel could see a brick road leading into the village. The manor, in itself was a large beastly thing, with a rough, gray exterior which almost made it seem ancient, with its spires and turrets, one on each corner of the manor. Leading up to the large, slightly chipped rosewood door at the front was a flight of short, marble stairs.
"I hate small talk. I don't know where this conversation is going."
Dean laughs at the disbelief in the man's voice. "I swear." He attempts to imagine a face to match the voice. Brown eyes, perhaps? A crooked nose? No, the voice sounds quite young. Features aside, Dean does imagine soft, pale skin, devoid of wrinkles or lines.
Before he can say anything, Sam gives a wet chuckle and a grin pulls at his lips.
"You... You didn't like it, did you? The Corps?"
"Fuck," Castiel cursed, as he spread his legs apart, one hand working his own cock, the other holding onto the metal door, and presented his ass to Dean, who laid a sharp slap on it, tinging it a bright, stinging red.
cried in front of you? Probably not."
"Ah, indeed, indeed, quite apt."
How much longer will you be here?”
The prince mumbles something, but Dean doesn't bother paying attention as he slides his hand down and wraps it around Castiel's cock. The length is thick, but heated and twitching in his grasp, almost soaked with streams of precome.
Castiel laughed, pulling Dean into one final hug, before walking back towards the front door, when Dean's voice had him pausing in his tracks and turning back.
Castiel wished he was Lisa.
"I wasn't snooping. You left the tab open."
"Good," Blue notes, and then there's shuffling over the line before the call ends. Strange, Dean thinks, how Blue ended their call so abruptly, but a moment later, his doorbell rings. He pauses, allowing Blue time to leave, before walking over to the door and twisting it open. True to Blue’s word, a warm container of rice and curry sits at his door. The moment Dean pops the lid open, the aromatic scent of spices hits him right in his senses and he hums.
"Of course, Dean."
What can he say? He wants to say
"You."
At last, the prince lifts his head, and his gaze settles right on
"No. No, no, no, no, no." he mumbles to himself, falling forward against the counter, his hands pressed into his face, as he tries to will away the tears stinging his eyes.
Which is why, sat here on a crowded love-seat, in Benny's farmhouse, which was dark, only lit with glimmering neon lights, music blaring loud enough for it to shake the ground, and the room reeking of alcohol, vomit, and sweat, Castiel sipped at his paper cup, which had been filled with some beer, some water, a strange combination, and it tasted disgusting, but somehow, as long as Castiel had something to sip on every now and then, he didn't mind. Benny had his arm wrapped around Castiel's shoulder, and clearly, he was looking for fun. Castiel hadn't known Benny swung that way, but in a very earnest and drunken way, he had confessed to Castiel about wanting to fool around with another boy, and Castiel, having had a little too much of the diluted beer, had smiled and accepted. Anything to distract himself from Dean.
A soft patter of footsteps follows Dean's words. Well, Blue’s gone now.
