girls, if you didn't know. Just ask Pepper, my g—ex-girlfriend.” The grin on his face vanished as if someone had doused a candle in water.
you!” Steve practically shouted. “I don't hate anyone— well except maybe the Red Skull, and some Hydra officers, which is actually what I wanted to—”

“As I was saying three years ago-”
Steve was currently staying in SHIELD barracks for lack of better options: a small, windowless room with a noticeable lack of air conditioning. Not that he could afford it in the ‘40s, but the early May heat was uncomfortable. He rested his head on the scratchy pillow and tried to shut off his brain. No use. His thoughts kept circling around that strange fight with his imposter. What not-him had said… “
“Yes sir.”
Natasha rolls her eyes, “And here I thought you were here to visit an old friend.”
“I can’t be in love with you, ‘cause you’re too pretty and too nice and too smart, and you’re the best person I know ‘n I don’ don’ wanna ruin that with stupid stupid feelings ‘n shit. Stupid.”
“What’s your problem?”
Peter sits.
They make their way through the yellow tape, “Steve here?” Carol asks, tossing her makeshift explosive into an abandoned squad car.
He’s half expecting him to jump out of the bushes with a grin and tell the crowd not to be so sombre, it’s a lovely day, after all.
Natasha shakes her head and mutters something under her breath Steve gladly decides to ignore.
“I’m sorry, should I not have told your best friend your current legal situation?”
Bucky felt the strong compulsion to tear his hair out. “Do you hear yourself?”
“But--”
Steve doesn’t often get the subway. It brings back… interesting memories. This time, he’s not going particularly anywhere, just watching a guy who looks barely old enough to graduate high school - by recommendation of JJJ. The train comes to a sudden stop and all the commuters sway forth with the air of people who have come to expect it land have given up fighting it, like a child with a broken backpack, with the exception of Parker. He, committing subway etiquette blasphemy, bumps into a guy who looks like he believes he’s too good for the subway, sleek, well-dressed Wall Street type. Steve has fond memories of breaking into guys like his houses. Parker, in one of the smoothest lifts Steve’s ever seen, takes the guy’s Apple watch and his wallet, muttering a shy, bashful, “Sorry,” after.
“And you two won’t?”
A beat of silence passes over them.
“Fury.”
“I just watched my boyfriend flirt with a very attractive man significantly younger than me, take a guess,” Tony grouches.
, and 2. he plead guilty.
“Tony... get out... not... safe,” Steve coughs out. He’s barely moving, making an effort to get up, but ultimately staying down.
sry this is late, got hit w the bad vibes like a carsalesman slapping a vehicle, enjoy some absurdly hubris-ridden, past steve and tony! (but at least now i have an outline!)
“Hey, sweetheart,” he greets, taking the chair opposite him.
Up in apartment 4C, Peter Parker empties his pockets to find the Apple watch and, instead of the overstuffed wallet, to his dismay, he unpockets a business card with a name, location, and time. Well, if he’s going to be kidnapped at least the culprit has been kind enough to give their name - possibly an alias, the primary location - a relatively popular diner, and the time - dinner.
They’re in a supply closet, because that’s how their flirting climaxed; one heated look and a strategically placed closet.
“You’re good, you’re… really good,” Tony says, once he catches his breath. He finally does get the name of the man in a black turtleneck: Steve. He’d told him in between sucking bruises against his collarbone, like something to be forgotten the next morning… which… yeah, that’s fair.
Bucky’s got the forgery in a janitor’s cart, Nat’s guiding rich British folk around various paintings, nodding with fake inquisitiveness at every guy who decides he’s got masters in art history because he decides understands what Anish Kapoor was attempting in
“Bouncer mentioned there was a game going on,” Natasha says, casually.
Bruce has seen Tony at his worst, during the winter of ‘91 and the following decade, when he’d put everything and anything in his body without a care of quality or quantity or if he’d wake up the next day. Bruce was there when he got his stomach pumped, both times, he’d seen what the palladium did to him, he’d watched him fall from the sky all those years ago, but none of those times had Bruce really, truly believed that Tony Stark would die.
He sways gently to the music, smiling a little when he sees Tony’s eye track down his body.
“Officer Grayson? I’m Steve Rogers, just out, I’m meant to check in with you… No, sir, I haven’t gotten into any trouble. No drinking, not even a parking ticket, sir… I wouldn’t even think of leaving the state,” Steve carries on listening to Grayson, letting him talk as he wonders about Tony. One of his prison buddies told him not to waste any good thought on any lovers he had, “
“Laufeyson’s places,” Steve confirms. Bucky looks like if he were a cartoon he would have steam pouring out his ears and lasers shooting from his eyes straight into Steve’s prefrontal cortex. Steve makes the executive decision to deal with that later. “Think he’ll mind?”
Tony laughs, “Let’s keep it to special occasions,” he says, patting Steve on his shoulder. He’s, for lack of a better term, utterly hammered, and it’s a good look on him. He’s happy and carefree in a way he so rarely is as their impeccable Captain. Tony’s pretty sure he hasn’t stopped smiling all evening. It makes his traitorous heart skip beats that surely can’t be healthy for a person with a heart condition.
“They didn’t give me much choice,” it would be incredibly debilitating to both his plan and his interpersonal relationships if they decided to kill each other in Nat’s rental.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You knock,” Steve tells Sam when they find themselves in front of a door that grandly declares that this is the location of
Now, Steve may be a criminal and more often than not, on the other side of the law, but he’s not a deplorable guy.
Steve lasts the grand total of about two seconds before he’s asking Natasha, “Did you have to tell him I’m on parole?”
brings nothing but trouble,” Natasha corrects, sipping on her own. She flags down the bartender for another.
“What’s this?” James looks to the other players for some sort of answer, refusing to meet her eyes.
“You need to tell me about what you did to Bucky,” Steve says, he knows just as well Nat that maybe he’s not, exactly 100% about what he had planned, hell, he can’t even be sure that the people he needs want to work with him. But Nat trusts him, and Bucky made his promises a long time ago. He’s not going to screw up this time.
Tony pushes Steve against the wall as soon as they stumble into his bedroom, taking and taking, heady with it all, already. He’d be more embarrassed at how fast he got here if it weren’t for Steve parallel to him - moaning softly into his mouth and pushing his hips up.
“We’d match,” Clark says, grinning. He just about dodges the cushion Tony throws at him.
Steve needed to flirt with unsavoury people for his job, Tony knows that, all of them do. Doesn’t mean he has to like it.
hope you're all having a good day xx
“I’ve seen him happier.” Bucky grants him that, at the least.
But to his surprise, Steve comes back in not even five minutes later.
“Often do.”
Steve grins, all bashful and teasing at the guy, and bites his lip. Storm leans down and whispers, “Want to take this outside?” in Steve’s ear. Tony grinds his teeth so hard he almost misses what Nat says over the comms.
“A house call? Like the way Washington in September of 2014 was a house call?”
“JARVIS, scan, scan, for Steve,” Tony says, ignoring the way his voice cracks. JARVIS shows an infrared scan of the building, a bright red blur in a sea of blue. Steve. Tony carefully flies towards it, paying no mind to the structural warnings JARVIS displays over his HUD.
. What do you have that the other three didn’t?”
Peggy tells him to socialise, as he will, eventually, have to go back to the States and start his job. Apparently, being cultured is somewhat important for a liberal arts professor.
As soon as Steve finishes, Tony stands up, deciding to ignore the wolf whistles from the extended team, and takes Steve by the hand dragging him toward their room.
Sam grins, “Just a little.”
Steve glanced away, “Fuck off.”
“Fuck me,” Steve asks, eyes wide, “please?”
“Yeah...” Steve slurs through a yawn, grinning, “should get drunk more.”
++  Ради бога = for god's sake
“Well. Go on then.”
“Actually I’m pretty sure it’s Colonel Paranoid–”
“Good thing I don’t have much to lose.”
Overtop the New York Times he’s pretending to read, Steve watches the faceless clock tick slowly closer to one - there’s still a couple minutes and Natasha doesn’t believe in being early. He scans the front page: plans to raze one of Fury’s - well, Loki’s now - hotels, accompanied by a picture of a scowling Fury (not that he has any other faces, Steve’s pretty sure he’s seen him smile exactly once when he got too into character in the Looky-Loo they pulled in Belgium) and another picture of Loki, with Tony at his arm, radiating smugness and generic assholery.
“If released,” finally, the last one speaks, the one closest to the door, “is it likely you would fall back into a similar pattern?”
“I want to keep it, Steve,” Tony admits, ashamed, picking at the duvet.
“Enjoy the function, Mr. Charney,” one of the security guards says with a nod, already moving on to the next one. Steve nods back, deftly tucking his ID into his wallet and fixing the clasp on his watch. The driver’s license wasn’t his best work, but after his Twining alias got flagged and sufficiently burned, he’d had to make another, quickly. Nat had given him a little heat for the new name, but it had gotten him through UK Customs well enough, and they all know that international borders are the best test for an ID, second only to another forger. In an ideal circumstance, he wouldn’t have to be crossing international borders, but needs must when he’s being run out of the States. Hopefully, Matt will have things sorted but the time they’re done here. Steve tells himself to focus, his personal issues concerning his possible impending statelessness aren’t going to help them here.
“Sir? The lounge at the Grand gets busy around 1, if you’re interested,” Natasha tells him with a smile.
“Glad to know your priorities are straight, Romanoff,” Steve says, wincing as she applies antiseptic.
“You have me stalking the most powerful man in Vegas? All week?” Peter says, in disbelief, when Steve tells him his role at the start of the week.
“You're not here to dig up old shit, Romanov.”
“Not loaded, no-one’s getting hurt,” Steve affirms.
They kiss, in front of the whole world - it’s not every day that the General of the Army of the United States gets married to a man - and all Potts can think of is him, and how damn lucky he is to have him, forever.
Tony nods frantically, just about keeping in a groan, “Yeah, yeah baby, we can do that, we can do that.” Tony tugs Steve over to the bed and pushes him gently on so he’s lying on his back, legs spread wide. Steve pulls on his shirt and Tony lifts his arms, letting him take it off and toss it who knows where, kissing him silly all the while. The rest of their clothes join the floor as Steve seems to make it his life’s goal to suck hickeys down Tony’s chest.
“Stay?” Steve asks, so vulnerable and open, all Tony can do is agree and slide in under the covers next to him.
Steve, admittedly, has to acquiesce to that. “It’s never been tried before…” he says, in an attempt to appeal to Fury’s daring and ambitious side.
“Right…” Sam says, slowly, “glad we got that over with. Time to find Col. Paranoia?”
Despite being in the game for a few years at this point, passing through museum security always put him on edge, regardless of his ability to talk himself out of handcuffs time and time again and his physical advantage over the two, bored senseless guards. Bucky told him it was good to be on edge as it has a tendency to keep one hyperalert.
Dr. Potts and Captain Stevens and blowjobs in a supply closet.
Stevens lets go, and Potts has to bite back a whine at the loss of his mouth, and grins smugly - somehow keeping his rank, status and power, even on his knees.
Steve nods, “’Kay,” oblivious to Tony’s inner turmoil. He’s a happy drunk, maudlin for about a second when he’d remembered the last time he’d tried to get drunk, but other than that, he’d been declaring his love and affections for the team and giggling at things only the inhibited find funny all night.
“You don’t know?”
Steve looks gorgeous in the shirt, seams straining to keep in those muscles, playing the part of ‘college art teacher’ the general public think he is. Usually, keeping the identity of the ever-elusive Captain of Brooklyn a secret, only known to his allies and the ones he kills, is a good thing, when Steve had told Tony (a story for another time), he’d thought it was smart - a good way of avoiding the law while enticing fear into his enemies (a mask dehumanises a person) and giving him the ability to perform honeypot missions like these. But today, Tony wants to throw everything and anything he can (including all the very expensive, very custom recording gear he has on him) at this Storm guy.
Natasha just shrugs. Steve is almost pleased that he could see that she’s enjoying this. Almost, if it weren’t for the fact that Bucky had somehow landed himself here. He’s disappointed and he was in
She leans over, takes his glass, and drains it, “Ради бога.”
Steve looks wistful and so damn sad Tony would be willing to fly to the moon on the back of a butterfly if it would make him happy. “Wanna be... wanna be boyfriends, ‘cause you’re nice and pretty 'n smart but I can’t.”
“No,” Steve groans, attempting to facepalm. His fingers slide through his messy bangs and he loses his balance, crashing into the wall.  “I wan’ wanna be more than that. Dummy.”
, “what we're trying to find out is: was there a reason you chose to commit this crime, or was there a reason why you simply got caught this time?”
“Steve,” Tony says, taking his face and making him look him in the eye, “you’re drunk, you’re very, very drunk, but I promise you, I’m not going anywhere, okay. I love you too.”
So instead he made a stupid joke. The type that you would only find even the slightest bit funny if you had been awake for over a day and now found yourself in a situation where time moved like sticky sweet syrup, where urgency had never bothered to be invented, where you’re so drunk on intimacy and love you can barely see what’s ahead of you, and honestly, in that moment, in the moment where nothing else exists and it feels like the world was made for you and for them and for you to be together in that moment, you can’t care that you can’t see what’s looming ahead.
“Believe it or not, Ms. Potts, I’m a free citizen,” his lawyer had told him that he got parole by the skin of his teeth, and possibly only because one of the judges was young and had studied him back in college, but they didn’t need to know that.
Natasha recognises that, and asks, “And already turning over a new leaf?” gesturing to his drink and whereabouts.
“Because of your own bullshit! Because you wanted too much and you lost it all!”
“Yeah, I’m pretty sure you’re the only one.”
“Hey,” Tony says, as evenly as he can, but something gives him away, because a shit-eating grin spreads over Steve’s face like wildfire.
“Steve. It’s your job.”
With barely constrained unright anger and possession, he watched from the back of the bar as Steve flirts with the target, Storm - a guy in Richard’s crew. Supposedly, they’ve been up to some ‘suspicious activity’, so Steve’s trying to get some information out of him.
A beat passes. Bucky is fully aware that Steve has never been able to make a choice between millions and Tony, between anything and Tony. He’s not entirely sure if  Steve knows that too.
Bucky gives him a withering look. They’ve known each other long enough that Steve’s fully aware that if he’s not serious Bucky will walk straight out the door.
The door opens before Steve's even started knocking.
“Good morning,” one of them, the lady in the centre, says.
“We have a score. Big one. Vegas.”
“You’re yet to tell me what went down between you two.”
Tony nods, following Steve’s lead. He’s learned that when he gets like this, back ramrod straight and a steely expression in his eyes, it’s best to listen, follow, and take note of their surroundings. The bar they’re in is in a seedy part of town, lit by a couple low-watt bulbs and utterly crowded, so he can’t really do the last part, but Steve’s presumably found or saw danger.
Tonys eyes darken when he catches the implications, entranced entirely by Steve and Steve only.
“Tony, your--

“Don’t play fucking stupid, Tony’s with Laufeyson. Tell me this isn't about screwing the guy who's screwing your husband,” Bucky growls. If Steve were a lesser man he’d be utterly terrified.
? I was behind bars!”
“Last you heard?”
If looks could kill, Natasha’s pretty sure she’d be making her way downstairs already, but alas, all James’ eyes can do is hold far more scathing and bitterness than she’s used to. If she were to tell someone that she’d once been witness to love and adoration from him, she’d get carted off to the nearest looney bin. Or worse, a shrink.
“I-- what?” Tony says, dumbfounded.
“What do you mean, pregnant?” Steve asks, sitting bolt upright, sheets pooling in his lap.
“You kidding? I just became a citizen again.”
“Not dead,” Steve says, voice hoarse after a week of not using it.
“I love you,” he whispers, after JARVIS had dimmed the lights, running his hand through his clean, vanilla-scented hair - he was probably due for a cut, but he looked more boyish and carefree with his hair falling into his eyes and easier into disarray. It was a good look on him.
“You’re not even a felon and you choose to spend your time here,” Steve spits back, squinting up at them, “finally shifted the stick from your ass?”
When he gets to Ditko & Lee, a man, steely-eyed and ruggedly handsome with the beard, makes eye contact with him. On the tabletop next to a half-drunk cup of coffee, there’s the wallet from the Wall Street guy. Against all better instincts, Peter approaches him.
He’s taking Steve to bed, apparently the most trusted to for the job, after the party winds down.
“Steve!”
“Hey,” Steve says, low, standing close enough behind him to smell his cologne - something expensive, probably niche - but far enough to be friendly. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Nat roll her eyes, in his ear, Sam groans out complains that he’s not here to get lucky. Peggy, as she’s done all night, tells them to focus.
Steve has had plenty of time to think why he’d let himself get caught, plenty of visits from Sam and Nat telling him why he got caught, hell, even his lawyer had told him. He’s had plenty of time to make peace with it: even the best let emotions get in the way. Despite the reputation he’d built up over the years, he is only human after all.
“Hey,” Tony says, as evenly as he can, but something gives him away, because a shit-eating grin spreads over Steve’s face like wildfire.
i hope u had a good time, remember to eat a vegetable and/or fruit + drink a water <3
“I do realise why you’re… annoyed. I’ll deal with my marriage after all this. I’m done with secrets,” Steve continues.
“Captain.”
When James comes in, poorly constructed veil of enthusiasm barely shielding his face, he immediately pulls a face at Natasha as though there was a bad smell in the room. Or, well, a worse smell.
thank you so much for reading!!
“I’ll tell you that when you admit why you really took
“Well. That went better than I thought it would.”
He takes the long route to the Draper, they have Peggy and Sam in their ears, directing them. This job doesn’t take a lot, not at this stage anyway, you’d think galleries would stop putting on fundraisers and functions with how much it helps people like Steve, but alas, they have far too much faith in criminals. The relative cacophony of a party allows for far better cover than anything they could have come up with themselves, and this one isn’t even manipulated. This one’s an easy job, a simple switch, no need to goad anyone, though Steve really couldn’t help himself when he made the forgery. He’ll concede to the general stereotype that thieves have far too much hubris, for once.
Bucky knows damn well the rules they had when they started all this, and he knows that Steve knows that he knows them better than the Constitution.
There’s a certain type of comfort he gets alongside all his personal possessions and the form that declares them officially his and legally obtained. Not homely, not exactly, but like he’s his own man again. He signs the form, slides it under the glass, and receives a manila envelope for his troubles.
Bucky stays mulishly silent as Natasha pulls into a driveway neither of them recognise.
That makes Tony crash into a wall, “You what?”
Bucky practically feels his face set in stone. God fucking damn it.
“Steve,” Tony says, taking his face and making him look him in the eye, “you’re drunk, you’re very, very drunk, but I promise you, I’m not going anywhere, okay. I love you too.”
“Fine,” Bucky acquiesces.
“I’ll quit, if you don’t like it,” he says, rushed.
Steve huffs a laugh. She knows why he did it, she knows that he doesn’t even regret it, even if it landed him in behind bars, but he’s always told her, and the agents who interrogated him, and the lawyer who questioned him, and Tony when he’d asked, on his single visit to the prison, “It’s my favourite myth.”
He catches himself just before he spirals into a pit of self-hatred, some ‘best-friend’ he is, because Natasha has that glint in her eye, the one that used to mean they were in for a fun night in some absent multimillionaire’s mansion, one that now means she’s playing him like a fucking violin.
“That was fun,” Tony says, mildly, when he catches his breath and his pleasure fades into a pleasant, hazy glow.
“Oh?” Bucky speaks up for the first time in a while. He knows where this is going and he likes it even less.
greetings criminals xx
Before they can carry on bickering the door swings open, and the man in question appears before their eyes. “Matt likes the Steve Rogers that doesn’t make him defend an undefendable case.”
“All you do is attract trouble,” Bucky grumbles, getting in the back.
“Glad to see your rules haven’t changed,” Bucky mutters.
The guard who leads him to the changing cubicles glances over his shoulder, “Missus couldn’t wait, huh?”
Bucky huffs, like he would ever voluntarily talk to Stark, “I watched the tape of his visit. You put on a good act.”
“America’s playground,” Tony mumbled, far more interested in pressing feather-light kisses to Steve’s jaw, tender and loving. Maybe, Steve let himself think, let himself hope that he felt it too. Hard and fast and damned foolish.
remember to drink a water and maybe a vegetable xx
She just about refrains from sighing aloud. “Last I heard he was teaching the up and coming youth of LA how to play poker.”
He’s easy to get into bed after that, and Tony shifts them around until they’re in a position they’re in distressingly rarely: Tony as the big spoon, holding Steve against his chest.
“Had a good birthday?”
“Likewise,” Steve says, catching his eye, returning the second half of his smile. He’s a little shorter than Steve, just so that Steve, in the event that they would be kissing, would have to tilt his head down a little. “What brings you here?”
“Fine?”
“Love you,” Steve whispers, fighting to keep his eyes open.
thanks for reading! comments + kudos are greatly appreciated <33
“Where you going back to?” Tony asks, basking in the afterglow for just a little longer.
A light blush falls over Steve’s cheeks when he sings that, the furthest he’s gotten from shameless all night. He tips his chin down, so he’s looking up through his lashes at Tony.
Tony jostles awake and rushes to gently cradle Steve’s face in his hands, “No, no you’re not.”
“Okay,” Steve concedes.
“That’s because they’re not, what are you doing?”
“You’re kidding.” He got parole for
“Hurrying?” Steve asks, smug.
“–ench press over a thousand pounds, faster than sound in less than point-two seconds, six-five… tell me, who do you think is in control now?” Tony says, cupping Steve’s face with the gauntlet, stroking over his cheekbone with his thumb. Steve’s eyes are blown wide, and he doesn’t seem to have noticed that he’s leaning against a table, putting himself even lower than Tony.
, and Tony Stark has the distinct feeling that he might see the unnamed guy with the incredibly impressive shoulders again.
“Well, don’t be offended if I don’t take the word of a criminal as gospel.”
Steve shrugs. “We get someone not as good and you can go back to… petty pickpocketing, Peter Parker.”
sorry i pulled a houdini xx
“What if I say no?”
The guy laughs, caught off-guard, almost like he’s forgotten himself, “Tony Stark,” he admits, the way one would have to disclose a criminal record, proffering his hand, manicured, ringless. Steve takes it, lingering slightly longer than one would necessarily consider ‘friendly’.
“Stop it,” Tony says, picking his way closer, muting JARVIS when he starts to make louder noises about the structure of the building, “and stay awake while you’re at it.”
“Stop playing around. Tell me.”
“You know I’m not going to stop, I… you know how much Tony means to me, and I know he sent me the papers but he didn’t... he didn’t sign them. He didn’t sign them and I’m not going to give up on him until…”
“James, stay in the car, Steve, go knock on the door,” Nat says, in that voice that means she’s dangerously close to the end of her patience. “Now.”
“Nat.”
“He’s waiting in the car.”
“Do you wanna get cleaned up?”  Tony asks, still stroking his hair with one hand and, with the other, tracing his thumb over his cheekbone, fingers splayed over his beard, over a fading bruise.
In his second show of incredible self-restraint of the night, he doesn’t acknowledge Steve at all as Storm drags him outside, presumably to kiss him in the dirty alleyway next to the bar, even though Steve deserves something far better than that. Dickhead.
“I’ll quit, if you don’t like it,” he says, rushed.
Sam looks over it. Steve was right about it there being a lot of security, it’s looks like just about the least accessible vault ever designed, and that’s without the guards. “The… Asgard vault?”
Tony nods, following Steve’s lead. He’s learned that when he gets like this, back ramrod straight and a steely expression in his eyes, it’s best to listen, follow, and take note of their surroundings. The bar they’re in is in a seedy part of town, lit by a couple low-watt bulbs and utterly crowded, so he can’t really do the last part, but Steve’s presumably found or saw danger.
“Fuck off,” Steve says, without any heat, moving around their figurines.
He’s pliant and easy to get into bed, but when Tony gets up after tucking him in, his hand catches his wrist, tugging him back.
“Okay,” Peter says, after giving Bucky the rundown of Loki’s entire day. The kid’s green, like pastures-in-the-countryside, hex code 00FF00,
Steve looks in betrayal at Sam, “He’s the whole list?” Sam, as he also often does, ignores Steve.
“Can’t I just visit a friend?”
“I’m almost 22!”
The dial tone knocks Steve out of his sombre thoughts and Natasha’s hand on his elbow drags him away, “You’re making me see James for the first time in two years, you better be 100% about this.”
“You’re a kid. Kids get training wheels,” Steve says firmly, crossing his arms and looking down at Peter.
“I can see why you were such a good teacher,” Bucky mutters, staring at the blueprint in front of them.
Steve watches the nano-suit wrap around Tony’s body, entranced by the way the red and gold metal cling to his body. Before he knows it, Tony’s three inches away from him and he’s looking up into the armour’s eyes. Up.
Just before their flight for LA leaves, Steve finds a payphone to call his probationary officer, gesturing for Nat to go on ahead.
Steve grinds his teeth together, “Been talking to Tony?”
Steve follows him, unnoticed, as he gets off the packed train into an even more crowded station. He’s not in any rush: he’s done this before. Parker fluidly dodges the crowds with the ease of a kid who grew up here, who grew up blending in without any intention of hiding.
“Well,” Steve smiles ruefully, “I suppose.”
Bucky gives him a grin, the one that makes mothers with babies cross the street and policemen keep an eye on him, “Only in the morning, kid.”
well-tailored) with a gorgeous woman on his arm. Steve’s pretty sure he’s seen him somewhere before, maybe in the Classics exhibit. The woman wanders off, whispering something in the guy’s ear, and Steve decides to have some fun.
Sam gives him a time-check when he’s made a lap of the gallery and has a nice stack of contact cards from wealthy people - if they still have time in the UK after this, Steve might pitch another con, some of those people could stand to lose something, maybe the guy who’d groped him, winked, and offered to show him ‘his Manet’ (although they were standing in front of a Monet, but that’s neither here nor there), or maybe the woman who’d complained for an inordinate amount of time about the influx of immigrants and how they were a detriment to the economy, thanking him for not being ‘like them’ - regardless, he still has ten minutes left until Sam cuts the power. Time for more socialising!
“Can’t what?” And Tony, without question or trial, is going to hell for provoking him. He should put him straight to bed and leave a glass of water on his bedside, he should ignore what he says, because he’s drunker than a rugby player on tour and he barely knows which way is up, let alone what he’s saying.
another day, another chapter of steve being vaguely sus and criminal, what will our hopefully reformed ex-con do next?
Clark does what any good man in his situation would: he tackles him down and kisses him silly, until he’s breathless and panting and flushed a gorgeous pink with his hair in a complete and utter disarray and Clark doesn’t ever remember getting a punch in his chest as hard as the one that slams through his ribs with the realisation
“Friend of JJJ,” Steve replied. Peter supposes he intended to be vague and somewhat mysterious and elusive, but to Peter’s admittedly limited knowledge, Mr. Jameson doesn’t actually have that many friends. “Sit down.”
Steve shrugs, “As you say, ma'am, I was never charged.”
Steve rolls his eyes, “Buck don’t do that.”
Steve looks hopeful, but there’s something in his eyes that makes Tony think he's waiting for the other shoe to drop, “Okay,” he whispers, smiling.
He knows it’s a dangerous game, interacting with him more than usual, licking his lips and tracking his eyes with more intent than the teasing repertoire they’ve gotten into suggests, but if the way Stevens’ eyes flick down on occasion mean anything at all (unless his back pocket is just that incredibly fascinating), its a game safer than snakes and ladders.
It takes half a minute for the emergency lighting to turn on and another minute for the full power to come back. The chaos a mere ninety seconds of powerlessness caused in the gallery was something Steve revelled in, the world undone so easily, it would make anyone want to stop to smell the roses.
“Oh, c’mon, you go in there and by the time the strippers change sets you and James are going to end up punching it out over the bar,” Natasha reasons.
“What, once? To give you divorce papers?”
Steve nods, “’Kay,” oblivious to Tony’s inner turmoil. He’s a happy drunk, maudlin for about a second when he’d remembered the last time he’d tried to get drunk, but other than that, he’d been declaring his love and affections for the team and giggling at things only the inhibited find funny all night.
Tony huffs a laugh, “Well, if you must know, my secretary thinks it’s good I make international appearances, good for the company and all that.” Steve decides to not press him on the Stark Industries issue, sure he knows who Tony Stark of Stark Industries is, everyone does, but right now, he’s far more interested in the guy in front of him who’s still yet to grace them with his uncovered eyes. “Now your turn.”
“Steve?”
“Eight figures each.”
“Well, why not?”
“Hey, sweetheart,” he greets, taking the chair opposite him.
“But where are you even going to get the money to back this? Off the top of my head, I'd say we’re looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. And probably the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever.” Nat asks, cutting him off. Plans are all well and good but they’re worth jack if they don’t have the capital, and last she checked, none of them are millionaires. Yet.
“If things go to plan, I won't be the one who has to make that choice,” Steve says, quietly, simply. Some days, he just wants to take the man he calls his best friend and hit him over the head with a brick.
“Just like that?” Tony asks hopefully.
Tony lets out a long breath, “I think that’s it,” he says, sheepishly.
Captain Stevens is too perfect, Potts decides one day, after seeing him far too many times to be labelled ‘coincidence’. He’s uptight, every crease on his uniform is perfectly in place and every hair on his head is coated in pomade and flawlessly styled.
“Loki has a long list of enemies.”
Dick’s seen Bruce cry so few times in the time that he’s known him, and he can barely remember the last time he had, he’s almost forgotten that he
Tony grins, making his breath ghost over his cock.
“I’m sorry for going to prison,” Steve says, acrimony dripping from every syllable.
Steve would usually be slightly apprehensive about knocking on a stranger’s door in suburban LA, but, in all honesty, he’s more worried for Bucky.
“Do you want it gone?” Tony asks, letting go of the shampoo in favour of hugging him from behind.
With barely constrained unright anger and possession, he watched from the back of the bar as Steve flirts with the target, Storm - a guy in Richard’s crew. Supposedly, they’ve been up to some ‘suspicious activity’, so Steve’s trying to get some information out of him.
“Can’t what?” And Tony, without question or trial, is going to hell for provoking him. He should put him straight to bed and leave a glass of water on his bedside, he should ignore what he says, because he’s drunker than a rugby player on tour and he barely knows which way is up, let alone what he’s saying.
He hands the godawful orange fatigues to the guard, who leads him to the gates, the precipice of freedom. He lingers there for a moment after the gates grind open, hovering, letting the wind whistle past. The world out there isn’t pretty, and the view isn’t particularly pleasant - being on the inside for so long had almost allowed him to forget that he’d spent the last two years of his life in New Jersey. Almost. The glaring, graffitied sign to his right reminds him immediately.
“Call me, if you get bored in that tower of yours,” Steve says, placing a hand on the small of his back and teasing at the hickey that’s just peeking out of Tony’s collar after they get dressed, before he slips out the door with one, final, sweet kiss to the corner of his mouth. It had taken them far too long to put their clothes back on, getting distracted by each other over and over, pretending the rest of the world doesn’t exist.
Steve nods, almost imperceptible, staring up at Tony. He gently tugs him to his feet and makes their way to the bathroom, undoing clasps on the suit as he goes. Steve’s plaint and cooperative - testament to his exhaustion - and lets Tony take care of him more than he usually would let him, barely talking and pressing light kissing whenever he felt like to whichever part of Tony was nearest.
If it weren’t for the gaggle of children passing by, Steve would have decked Bucky right then and there. “Don’t bring him into this.”
Steve knows it’s unfair, especially considering, well, everything, but he can’t help it. Thankfully, Nat shuts both of them up with a glare strong enough for them to table the inevitable argument. For now.
Steve nods, getting up, “Right… my mistake, this table’s cold, anyway.” Who said prison hadn’t humbled him?
Steve collects another soviet!
“Until he gives up on you?”
“If you’re going to steal from Loki Laufeyson you better be prepared for the aftermath. This sort of thing used to be civilised. You’d hit a guy, he’d whack you. Done. Laufeyson… at the end of this, he better not know you're involved, not know your names, or think you're dead. Because he'll kill you, and then he'll go to work on you.”
That makes Tony crash into a wall, “You what?”
Fury pauses for a second. He knows exactly why Steve and his little, soon to be expanded, gang came to him: he has money, an entirely justified vendetta against the greasy little fucker, and incredibly misplaced trust in Steve Rogers.
“Let’s get you to bed, okay?”
Peter wanders away, possibly to pick Sam’s brain. Or irritate the absolute sanity out of him.
“I just watched my boyfriend flirt with a very attractive man significantly younger than me, take a guess,” Tony grouches.
“Ouch,” Clint puts his hand on his heart, “Still, I rather sacrifice cuddle time with you than be eviscerated by a feral alpha.”
“You really think I would need go feral?”  Natasha asks with a small smirk.
"Are you able to come out? Can you even survive outside the water?"
He got another nod as a reply.
“You mean you have no secondary gender?” Bruce asks.
Tony with him?”
“It seems I am too late,” Not-evil Steve says, defeated.
He was about to say he'd help him by carrying him after Tony got out of the tank, but was cut short when the tail began to shift into human legs. How about that.
"Tony?"
With a now smaller frown, Tony took the pants and fiddled with them a bit before putting them on. As he got up again, SHIELD agents entered the room, making the merman freeze and show alarm in his face once again.
“Traitor,” Tony says with a fake pout, “Next time you want to cuddle, you go find another omega.”
In a swift move, the creature rose to his elbows and looked at Steve's direction. Alarm on his eyes.
“Yep. No,” Clint turns to Tony, “You deal with her by yourself.”
Everyone is  now confused and something comes to Steve’s mind that makes him see red.
Tony grinned. Steve could get used to that smiling face.
"Let's go, then," Steve said to Tony, who nodded.
That could not be possible, could it? Those were creatures from fairy tales. And what one Earth did Hydra want with a merman? Was this one a human, once? Were they trying to create underwater soldiers or something? That just sounded crazy.
“What do you mean, ‘alpha’?” Other-Steve asks.
Tony, who had been sitting while waiting, frowned at the clothing.
“Yes. I came here from my own universe, as did the other Steve Rogers that you met,” Other-Steve says, with strong contempt in the last part of the sentence, “That Steve Rogers, let’s call him Hydra Rogers, also came after my world’s version of Tony. He has been doing it for years now. Going through the multiverse, world after world, with Tony as his target. When he came to my world and took Tony from us, I decided to make sure he would pay for it. Dr. Reed Richards managed to create a machine that allows one to travel through dimensions and after a few tries we found out how to predict the coordinates of the next one.”
“Universe like another dimension?” Bruce asks and other-Steve nods, “So the theory of the multiverse is correct.”
Tony gets hit in the chest by some tech that cuts out the signal he uses to summon his armor. Immediately after he is falling to the floor with metal binds around his torso, arms and legs. He starts feeling dizzy, his head heavy and sight a little blurry. He wonders if it is a concussion, but he does not remember hitting his head when he fell.
Tony. No, not his. Not yet. Maybe never his. But, in a way, he was his, even if just as the omega he wished to court, to bond with, to create a family with.
“Then, what is he?” Steve asks the AI first, “What are you?”
"Everything is fine," Steve replied, "Tony here was imprisoned by Hydra, and we are going to help him find his way home."
Steve’s voice is now sounding raw from the constant shouting.
“Even drugged you cannot keep quiet. You are the same wherever I go,” A very familiar voice says with a chuckle.
Steve manages nothing but a snarl and it is Natasha that replies, “They subdued us like we were nothing. They knew exactly how to. Their leader looked like a Hydra version of Steve,” She looked at said alpha, “And I don’t mean he just resembled Steve, he looked exactly like him. If our Steve was not with us, at the time, I might have suspected someone was controlling him, or possessed his body.”
“It appears that our guest is not an alpha,” the AI states.
Suddenly, everything goes silent. The smoke starts to dissipate and Tony finds that the others are on a similar predicament as him, as he suspected. They are all lying on the floor. Natasha and Clint with the same restraints as him. Bruce and Steve with some other tech keeping them down. These guys know what they are doing.
“Hydra Steve is jumping from universe to universe and killing every version of Tony Stark he finds. He is quick with it, and he takes something that belongs to Tony to get his next target. If Tony is already dead when he comes to a universe, then he kills its version of Steve Rogers. Witnesses said that Hydra Steve blamed their Captain America’s for their Tony Stark’s death and that they did not deserve to live for not protecting him.”
"Here," he said as he gave the merman the other man's pants.
Next to the closed door was a panel which required a key card and a code, so access could be granted to the other room. Steve used the card he was given by Natasha, after attaching the decoding device that should be able to hack the panel without the need for the passcode. It took some seconds, but soon after the door was sliding open, and Steve ran inside the semi-dark room.
“Who are you?” He asks. He has a theory, of course. Hydra Steve’s suggestions indicate the man has traveled through dimensions. Probably several. What he really wants to know is what he asks next, “What do you want?”
“Yes, it does. But I am shocked to learn he did not kill your Tony, but kidnapped him.”
According to the blueprints and the information they got, the door Steve was now standing lead to the next project Hydra was working on. And Steve was there to collect it. But if he deemed whatever was in there too dangerous, he would destroy it. Orders be damned.
“Let’s gather every helpful mind to this mission. We are going to take Hydra Steve down.”
To show he meant no harm, Steve put down his shield and raised his arms, to which the merman gave a curious look. A Hydra soldier entered the room and attacked Steve, who easily subdued the man by rendering him unconscious with a single blow on the man's head. Really, didn't they know by now that one single non-super soldier had no chance against him?
“He wants his Tony to be the only Tony,” Bruce concludes.
He can hear the sounds of struggle from the others, the impact when they fall, the shouts and grunts.
Clint waits for the snarky reply but gets confused at the concerned look on Tony’s face.
“Hush,” Hydra Steve says to Tony, as if talking to a child, “there is no need to fuss. I’m not going to hurt you,” With that, he gives the omega a small smile, his eyes and hand sliding down to Tony’s stomach, “You are too valuable.”
Silence comes as they think about what they just heard.
“Does it matter?” Steve says, fuming, “What matters is that Tony is alive, and we have a chance to get him back.”
“You will pay for this! JARVIS?” Tony pauses but a second before continuing with the request to his AI, “Make sure you cancel all the cuddling sessions with Clint on my calendar.”
“What does Hydra Rogers want with so many Tony Starks?” Coulson asks, “Is he trying to come with the ultimate weapon and believes many Starks will manage to create it?”
“Yes, Captain?”
“And I always have to ask you to mind your language,” Hydra Steve says, stopping right at Tony’s side and crouching.
“We have not been able to find Hydra Rogers’ world coordinates yet. I’m not sure we ever will, if we don’t find the man first.”
Other-Steve pauses for a moment, guilt written in his face.
“We are going to get Tony back,” Steve says, the rage inside him crushing every inch of him, “We’ll find the Hydra Rogers’ world and we are taking him down.”
Tony gave him a small smile and nodded, eyes bright looking right into Steve's.
The few minutes it takes for the elevator to reach their floor are tense. JARVIS keeps informing them the position of the man they are waiting for. As he gets closer, their scents peak with all the heavy emotions.
He was stunning. Dark brown wavy short hair, big doe eyes surrounded by long thick lashes, a what seemed to be a neatly trimmed goatee around a pair of lips with a pretty cupid's bow. His skin was as if it was shining in golden tones, probably due to the small scales that concentrated on some specific areas of his torso and arms. His tail was long and beautiful, vivid red with golden stripes. The fins started red and ended in gold.
When there is no reply from the AI, everyone else notices the problem. They all start standing up from their chairs when the blast hits them.
“A beta, Captain.”
“JARVIS contacted us as soon as it managed to come back online and still failed to connect to the tower,” Coulson says as the other agents work to free them, “We have agents trying to figure out what his blocking the AI.”
“That’s a lot to take in. Even more to believe in,” Clint says, not trusting the other-Steve completely.
"Dony?" Steve thought he heard.
“Yeah, and what if he decides his next targets will also be every child of Tony throughout the universes?” Clint adds.
“What is it?” Steve asks, impatiently. The other Steve is looking confused at the words.
“Instead of going after Hydra Rogers, we’ll wait for him at his home,” Natasha agrees.
“I’m okay,” he finally says, “We need to find who that guy is. If they are really Hydra. Where they came from. We need to get Tony back.”
“’the hell, that sounds so contradictory,” Clint points out.
“Hey,” Tony says, trying to sound lively but wincing when he his voice sounds a little broken and barely louder than a whisper, “Dead octopuses. I thought you guys were an extinct species.”
A shiver creeps through Tony’s spine at the words, “And what is that?”
“I assume they took Stark,” Coulson says, as if asking but expecting to be right.
Hydra Supreme gives him a condescending smile, but says nothing. Next thing he knows, he is being gently lifted from the floor by Evil Steve and he finally registers the sound of protests shouted by his teammates. The anxiety he has been feeling grows exponentially and his breathing starts to get uncontrolled.
Everyone agrees and look at other-Steve.
“Bring him here, then,” Steve says and everyone brace themselves for what is coming.
“Wait,” Other-Steve says with surprise, “Are you saying Hydra Steve
Stephen smirked lightly at that, well the stranger was really interesting. With him around, everything will be more funny and well the chance of saving Tony were higher. He stood up and walked toward the stranger. He stopped right in front of him.
“Well there is a trapdoor just here” smiled Rogers pointing the floor.
Okoye was furious, they were stupid and this Clint was a problem because of his hatred for Stark, the witch as well. She looked at T’Challa, his king was thinking and that wasn’t good for them.
“Yes he is, you surprised me and when you collapsed i took you and i teleported immediately”
Tell me what think or a question, i will be glad to answer !
Steve was against the fence on the balcony of his room. He was watching at the sky, still thinking about Tony, the day of his rescuing was coming faster and faster and Steve would be the first person that Tony saw. And everything would be perfect. Tony would finally realize that his place was by his side and Steve would propose him and they would have their happy ending. With a new resolution, Steve decided to leave his room and went to the training area, hoping to find the guardians.
Thor saw the hands cover with metal. He sighed before telling Eitri that everything he made, was inside his head. Eitri smiled and asked them to follow him. He showed them the mold
Thanos smirked at him coming closer and raised his glove, pointing the stones at Tony. “He is going to use it for beating me into submission” thought Tony “ Well the soul stone is special among the others stones and you need four to do something to me.” He raised a stronger shield, blocking the blast with a smirk. Thanos watched his attempt failed, furious.
Thanos was looking at his prize with a huge smile. The doctor told him that Tony was only sleeping he was too exhausted. His instinct was right for not killing the human. Everything will be absolutely perfect.
“I will, the stone is very safe with me, but right now i would like to know more about you” smiled Stephen widely” Let’s eat together tonight”
Done for now, i will try to update more. Thanks for the comment and kudos ^^
“Well this is interesting” smirked once more Tony
“Well I was a little hungry and you don’t have to call that Peter will do just fine” smiled Peter
“Calm down Logan, we need to stay focus,” said Charles” And find a way to help Tony without causing a massive diplomatic incident”
“It’s amazing, Thank you so much, Mister Doom” smiled Peter even happier
“I’m going to stay here even if it’s long” said Thor looking at Tony
Peter was laying down on the roof of the palace. That was the quieter place of Wakanda, no one could reach him here. He was thinking about Tony, how the man had became his father figure, well more like mother figure. He smiled at that, well like Doctor Strange said, that wasn’t wrong.
They stood up quickly and leave toward their rooms for the preparation. Tony raised an eyebrow at that, and the true was that he was really worry, for the cute kid who was currently living not far from the stones. Well he will have to protect him then.
T’Challa was running in the corridor toward the huge explosion in one of his room. Okoye was at his side and wasn’t happy. They finally arrived and opened the door. They saw two groups sitting on the couch and facing each other with an unknown woman standing with Edward in front of them
“Perfect teeth is giving me the creeps and Bird said some shit about Tony” shrugged Logan
“They didn’t trust me and i hate this” said Thanos killing the last one
“Calm down, she is just a kid” said Steve moving forward
Peter was walking inside the Castle, using his spider-sense avoiding most of the guards. He found a huge door, protected by two guards. He was sure that Tony was inside so he used his powers to make them move away. He quickly got inside and faced a huge tank who was from the ceiling to the floor and inside of it, was Tony who had an oxygen mask on his mouth and a lot of wires around him. He was in a foetal position. Peter directed his eyes toward the screen who was monitoring his vitals. Peter understood that the tank was a healing one but didn’t get why Doom would do this.
“It’s a pleasure,” Steve says, he knows better than to give a name, regardless of how much he wants to hear Tony, in his perfectly tailored suits and perfectly slicked-back hair, scream it.
“Would I go to you with a half-assed plan?” Steve challenges, then amends after Fury’s look, “Would Nat let me show you this with a half-assed plan?”
“So are you, bud,” Tony replies, easily taking his weight (he does work out, thank you very much).
Steve looks hopelessly lost for a moment, “Tonight, at the bar with Johnny... I know I cleared it with you but if you really don’t--”
Bruce stopped believing in magic a long time ago, so he can’t fathom why he’s disappointed when Dick tugs him away, when the sky has, inexplicably, turned dark and the stars, so much more than you could see in Gotham, shine bright.
“Aw, you think I’m undefendable?” Steev mocks, electing not to comment on the fact that 1. Matt talking in the third person heavily disturbs him, and he’s been to
“Don’t fool yourself, you know that they probably have someone on the inside,” Bucky mutters. He almost wishes he was back teacher poker. Almost. “Besides, I’m not the snitch.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not many people do, no,” he says, lightly. He’d thought that they were past that stage, where they were at each other’s throats, refusing to listen, refusing to become anywhere near ‘friends’.
Tony drags his cock over Steve’s prostate, again and again, beating the small, sensitive bundle of nerves until Steve's hardly aware of anything that’s not Tony, or his own pleasure, building and building until his orgasm crashes into him, and Tony follows suite, collapsing into him.
recruitment with a chaser of soft, loving, pre-'divorce' stevetony
The members of the board look uneasily between themselves, “Mr. Rogers, what do you think you would do, if released?”
“We’d need a big crew, multiple cons simultaneously, I know you still have contacts around–”
“Sure, I wonder what he’ll say.”
Tony and Steve meeting in London, what causes an NYU professor to visit the UK?
Steve brushes up against him, without acknowledging him in the slightest and forges on, plan fulfilled. All he has to do it wait. Then, out of pure curiosity, he doubles back and follows him through a series of back alleys until he reaches the backside an apartment complex flirting with ‘decrepit’. Parker takes maybe two steps back before swinging himself up 2, 3, 4 floors via the fire escape. A broad skillset could get one very far in this world.
“James.”
“A divorce,” Bucky mutters under his breath. Nat steps in his foot under the table and he attempts to hide his wince, to no avail if Fury’s raised eyebrow suggests anything.
Steve grins at the familiar face, “In my defence,
“That’s the best lift you’ve done yet,” Steve had, at the very least, expected to feel it. Maybe he’s losing his touch, getting soft.
“Tony...” Steve says weakly. Tony’s close enough that he can see the extent of the damage on him, almost none of his suit is properly intact and he can see the shine of tears in his eyes.
“You’re out of your goddamn minds!”
Steve frowns, “Don’ wanna be your bud,” he grumbles. Tony pretends that hadn’t cut all his heartstrings then played cat’s cradle with them.
A younger man, almost subconsciously, tightens his hand around his father’s, trying to offer, or gain, some comfort. It’s the closest both of them had come to crying in a long time.
“He asked me to give them to you, dipshit. Do you really think he wanted to visit his little criminal husband?”
“Catching up on recent events?”
“What gave you that impression?”
“I see prison has done nothing for your habit of changing the topic.”
“It feeds into The Hermes and The Chitauri,” Natasha says, “those are all…”
“I’m not in control of your guilt complex, James.”
“I can’t believe,” Potts mutters, kissing him, forcing his tongue into his mouth, passing on his taste to him, “that after all that, you still look like nothing happened.”
“He visited you fewer times than Tony.”
“No--”
If he shocks her in the slightest, she doesn’t let it show, instead gesturing to her nametag, “You must have me confused for someone else,” she says coolly, “my name is Yelena, see.”
“And you choose to spend your freedom here?”
“Hm.”
“You must be enjoying this, Stark,” she says, and Tony can see her downing her drink and making her way outside. He just about refrains from giving her the bird as she walks past him to her next position, outside. He’s glad that he’s not going to have to watch Steve and Storm make out.
“Hey, darling,” Tony says, approaching him. He strokes his hand through his hair, regardless and uncaring of all the dirt and grime that had accumulated in it, and watches as some of the stress and tensions bleeds out of him
“He already left me once, I don’t think he’ll do it again just for the kicks.”
“—and the thing is, you’re very classically attractive, like Prince Charming, except that would make me a princess which the Planet already think I am, though that might just be your influence, but then again who wouldn’t listen to someone that good looking, even in those glasses and the awful flannel you’re so goddamn pretty and handsome, and have I ever told you, sometimes i wish you forget to take your flannel shirts when you leave so I can wear them because you’re very big and smell nice.”
“I did miss you, you know,” Steve tells Bucky, letting the car door slam behind him.
pretty, Nat and Diana are pretty, Thor is pretty, hell, sometimes even Steve is pretty, but your pretty is also handsome, because you’re Superman, and you’d expect your handsome to be the manliest of the manliest, except your also pretty in a delicate which makes fuck all sense and—” the rest of Tony’s sentence gets drown in a pillow that he forces over his face. Clark, the pretty-handsome-bastard that he is, gently tugs it away.
“Stay in the car. I don’t want to create a scene,” Steve says.
Natasha stops him from getting out, “Wait. Let me go. He’s less likely to cause a scene with me.”
“You said Vegas? You want to hit a casino?” Sam asks, confused. They’d done casinos before.
“Casino’s are like… fairgrounds for adults. With greater consequences,” Steve wasn’t sure if the sentence even makes sense, but Tony giggled and he found that he couldn’t care for grammatical structure and other such follies.
“I know,” Steve says, simply, “we’ve gotta be careful, precise. Well funded.”
Tony laughs, “That was my goal, sweetheart,” he says, brushing back Steve’s hair. He’s so rarely like this - pliant and lethargic, and the wonder never passes over Tony’s head that he gets to see Steve Rogers like this, because of him.
“They’re Laufeyson’s places.”
Steve shrugs. “America’s playground.”
“Him?”
Steve looks hopelessly lost for a moment, “Tonight, at the bar with Johnny... I know I cleared it with you but if you really don’t--”
“Don’t fucking say shit like that, Rogers,” they hear Bucky snarl from behind them.
“Steve. It’s your job.”
“Tease,” Steve breaths out, shifting to try get his finger in his ass, or his cock in his mouth.
“Oh,” Steve says, mimicking Tony from earlier, “you know.”
“—and the stupid thing is, your pretty doesn’t even make sense! Like, okay,
Steve's a free man. He goes to the place that feels closest to home, the closest he'll get without Tony, and finds an old friend in the process.
