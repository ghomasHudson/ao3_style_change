"Bullshit, Cas! You don’t get to say all of that stuff to me and just leave forever!" Dean glared at him. "I didn’t even get to respond! How is that fair? No, we’re getting you out of here. End of story."
Dean texted him the motel address, noting that he was outside next to his car. Moments later, Castiel appeared, standing a little too close to Dean. “Hello, Dean,” he said, a little warily. Dean couldn’t blame him.
Dean winced. He knew it was true, though he never wanted to give up the satisfaction of calling Sam girly. That was just his God-given right as his older brother. He let out a sigh and pointedly looked away from Sam. “I don’t know, Sam, alright? I don’t know. Conversation over.”
Their latest case was near Sioux Falls so naturally, they had to take a break from the motel life to drop in on Bobby for a few days. It should have been easier to fall asleep on a good bed, but Dean still found himself tossing and turning.
Castiel looked around at first, just to be sure that Dean was gone, and that no one else was around. Everything seemed safe, so the sooner he got this over with, the better. He began by summoning his angel blade.
Having the decency to look sheepish, Dean said, “He told me he loves me. Even when I told him how terrible I am, he still loves me.” Just saying the words out loud gave him a funny feeling in his stomach. It was hard to believe it was true, despite everything that had happened so far.
know what it meant. So he went with the safe answer. “Cause it’d be weird as hell to see my little brother dating you.”
Sam put his hands up in a placating gesture. “Nothing, Dean. I just think it’s more likely that he’d respond to someone he knows. Like...,” he gulped, “Like us.”
Castiel closed his eyes to concentrate better. The Empty was a mysterious realm, unlike Earth, Heaven, Hell or Purgatory. There weren’t many ways of connecting to it. Even finding this communication spell was a fluke at best. But maybe they were thinking about this wrong. Maybe a spell wasn’t what was needed. Maybe he could use the rules of the Empty against it.
"There is one way that could work," Castiel began. "The Empty is a realm only for angels and demons—humans don’t belong here. You shouldn’t be here at all. I’m only here because I’m still an angel, because I still have my grace. But if I were to remove it, I’d become human. Theoretically, the Empty should spit me out once that happens."
When Castiel invoked his deal with the Empty, he had expected to face direct torment from the Empty. He was the one who had previously made it too "loud" for it, after all. The Empty made the terms of the deal to specifically punish him. Yet, when he arrived in the Empty, he didn’t even realize it, because he was immediately put to sleep.
Dean was more handsy than usual, frequently leaving his arm around his shoulders, taking his hand while showing him how to do something, or leaving his hand at the small of his back as he guided him somewhere. Castiel desperately told himself not to read anything into it, but it was causing all kinds of havoc in his stomach. He only hoped that he would be able to actually eat the food they were cooking, as it did smell amazing.
The second the blade was in his hand, however, he suddenly found himself unable to move. He looked down and saw tendrils of black goo around his arms, legs and torso. He struggled against the tendrils in an attempt to free himself, but they only got tighter the more he struggled.
At first, Sam was obviously tense and uncomfortable; of course, Castiel was oblivious. Sam’s eyes kept flicking back to Dean as if Sam was expecting Castiel to turn his attention to Dean at any moment. When it stayed on him, however, he relaxed a little. When there was a pause in the conversation, Sam actually
Sam lit up and turned to Jack. "Is it true? Is Eileen back?"
Maniacal laughter broke the silence and Castiel looked back up to find the Empty wearing Meg’s face. "You really thought it was going to be that easy to leave? I don’t think so. We made a
Dean abruptly snapped out of his reverie, and simultaneously his heart sank. His mind was so preoccupied with Castiel that he couldn’t even pull off a simple bar hookup without problems. He was clearly off his game. “Yeah, I’m fine. I’m sorry about that, I just remembered that I have some work I need to get done. Enjoy your drink.” He stood up from the stool.
They picked up some diner food and ate in the motel. Sam and Eileen were clearly in love and didn’t even think to hide it by indulging in quick kisses and sappy looks all throughout. Once they were done eating, Dean excused himself, letting them enjoy being happy together, as the longer he watched it, the worse he felt about what he had been missing out on for years.
Sam narrowed his eyes at the diversion, but he allowed it. “Dean, we already tried that.”
“Fine,” Castiel finally said, looking away from Dean to focus his attention back on Sam. Dean felt oddly bereft. They continued the discussion, and with Dean actually participating, they quickly figured out a plan of attack against the demons plaguing the town. When another lull in the conversation occurred, Dean saw Castiel getting antsy, clearing planning on flying away. Despite the awkwardness between them, Dean wanted him to stay a little longer.
Dean had to suppress a full-body shiver when he saw that look on Castiel’s face, but nevertheless joy started bubbling up within him. It certainly wasn’t perfect. They still had a lot of issues left unsaid, and they would likely have many more fights to come. Yet maybe, for once in his life, he had found a happily ever after.
Dean was interrupted by Castiel pushing him up against the wall. He was even more furious now. “Don’t tell me what I mean, Dean. You taught me to think and feel for myself, and I
This was it. She was definitely interested. Now he just needed to close the deal. Yet… he looked at Casey again, and for a moment he only saw Castiel. His mind started to run with it. What would happen if he were to go to a bar with Castiel? Would their conversation only be a prelude for sex and nothing more, like this, or would they just drink some beers together while Dean painstakingly explained whatever sport was playing on the bar TV…?
Sam stopped laughing, and Dean almost counted it as a victory, but then Sam said, “Yeah, but he
It was one thing to talk to Bobby about telling him or think about telling him. Having him standing before him now, looking fond but curious, made his throat close up. “Hey, Cas,” he croaked.
For a moment it was quiet between the brothers. Sam took a look at Dean and appeared conflicted, but eventually managed to speak his mind. "So… what was this deal that you guys were talking about?"
Castiel’s smile deepened. “I’ll keep them for today. In honor of…,” he paused, then said in a deadpan tone, “Dr. Sexy.”
“If nothing is wrong with how I look, then I am free to wear cowboy boots. Am I sexy now, Dean?” Castiel asked, a little too earnestly.
Castiel frowned. “What’s wrong? You don’t look injured. Are you in danger?”
Castiel’s expression turned sad, and he tilted his head. “You do deserve to be loved, Dean. But if that is what you wish...,” he trailed off and stepped back. He looked away. “I should return to my search.” He fidgeted awkwardly--such a painfully human gesture, and it just reminded him of minutes earlier, when Castiel was out cold to the world.
Different circumstances. It kept coming back to that, didn’t it.
Dean looked around slowly. Not many people here tonight. However, Dean spotted a stunning brunette woman sitting by herself at the bar. Jackpot.
Dean shook his head. "We’ve known each other for how many years, and you didn’t think that you
He couldn’t get it out of his mind. The warmth of Castiel’s body against his. Staring into his eyes, on the verge of a kiss, He kept wondering, what would have happened if they had kissed? In the dead of night, he couldn’t hide from the truth: he had wanted it to happen. He… wanted Castiel. Maybe, deep down, even loved him.
He lifted his hand up to touch his neck where he had sliced it, and his hand came away bloody. Concerned, he got up and navigated to the nearest bathroom he could remember. There was an impressive amount of blood, and some had already slithered down to stain his white dress shirt. He quickly cleaned it up, then found the first aid kit that was stashed at every bathroom in the bunker. He applied a mild antiseptic, hissing in pain as he did. Then he covered the wound with some gauze.
Bobby snorted. “Sounds like a real Sleeping Beauty.”
Sam’s face softens. “Dean, do you love him?”
“Another angel? Like... like Gabriel? Aw hell no, Bobby, I don’t want to deal with that douchenozzle again.”
you. It’s just I don’t want to see you with anyone else because it should be me!” Well. That’s one way to say it.
greeted Dean first. After an agonizing beat, he finally glanced towards Dean, and with an even more monotone voice than normal, said, “Dean.”
Castiel blinked. "I thought it was clear I meant every word I said."
up?” Dean retorted, not wanting to explain himself.
Dean and Sam reached the motel that Eileen was currently staying at several hours later. As time passed, Sam grew more agitated, bouncing his leg and wringing his hands. At one point, Dean caught him and wanted to laugh. Instead, he asked, "What’s wrong? We know she’s alive. Everything’s fine." Well, not
Dean beamed at him. “Hey, you made it! Come sit down with me.” He scooted over to the other side of the bed and then patted the empty space he left behind. He belatedly realized he normally didn’t do that. Castiel could see the screen just fine from the other bed.
Dean looked away for a moment. When Dean finally looked back, his cheeks were flushed. "I mean, you said a lot of things. Important things. I didn’t have enough time to say anything."
Dean stepped closer, close enough to kiss. “I mean it, Cas. Don’t be with anyone else. Just me.”
He couldn’t help but wonder what his reunion with Castiel might look like. If they ever reunited at all, that is. Castiel told him he loved him. He said it was the one thing he wanted that he couldn’t have. But that wasn’t true, was it. Dean knew he was in love with Castiel. He had been for a long time, though he usually tried to swallow it down, tried to deny it was ever real. Because he never imagined that an angel could feel romantic love like a human. He never imagined that anyone could love
, and kissed him. He lingered for a bit, waiting for something to happen, but he eventually pulled off. Castiel was still, and disappointment gripped his heart hard which, no, he didn’t even
The Empty sighed. "Fine, you utterly pathetic human-loving filth, you’ve won. I had better never see your face again." All the other tendrils holding Castiel in place vanished, causing Castiel to collapse onto the ground. The Empty then vanished as well.
"You sure about that?" the Empty smirked, as the tendrils locking Castiel into place tightened even further. "Good luck with your plan to become human when you can’t even move."
True to Ruby’s word, he found himself in a perpetual cycle of dreaming about his regrets, and boy, did Castiel have many regrets. The latest in the cycle: seeing an entire warehouse filled with dead bodies of Dean. They all died by his own hand. That he was ever able to kill
She was a little startled at first by his sudden appearance, but quickly relaxed. “Yeah, that’d be great. I’d love a Long Island.”
. He would never verbally admit to it though, so instead, he looked back at the TV and forced a grin. “Hey look, Sam, it’s your favorite show! Girls sitting around and talking about their feelings!”
Sam returned a few hours later. Instead of walking in, he knocked. Dean rolled his eyes at Sam’s presumption, but he got up and opened the door. Sam looked behind Dean into the motel room. “Is it safe to come in?”
Sam struggled to keep a smile off his face as he nodded.
“Hey, he responded to you too, you know!”
“It damn well did when I’m driving! It made me almost crash every time!” Dean wasn’t exaggerating.
He was still a little angry, but what he felt was not important anymore. “That was before I knew
For such a potentially powerful spell, the steps involved were rather simple. The ingredients were mugwort, irises
, of all people. Yet Castiel upended everything he thought he understood in the space of a single speech. What would he do, if Castiel were to appear in front of him again?
Dean gasped. "Really? But I didn’t think angels were capable of that."
“No way. There has to be something you’ve overlooked.”
, Sam?”
Dean nodded. "He… he told me he loved me! Before the Empty got him, that is. He loved me and because of me, he’s gone."
Sam looked at him as if he had been replaced by an alien. “Dean... he loves
Castiel frowned, clearly picking up on Dean’s concealed distress. “Dean, please believe me. You are a really good--”
Dean turned his glare on Sam. "Easy for you to say, Eileen should’ve been brought back by now. Cas is your friend too you know."
Castiel looked at Dean as if he just said something very stupid. Which, admittedly, he had. “That’s not the point,” he said patiently. He paused and looks thoughtful. “Why do you care so much?”
“All right, enough yammering, the food’s ready,” Bobby cut in. “Castiel, you’re eating too. I don’t care about that ‘I’m an angel so I don’t eat’ crap. You spend the night here, you eat with us.”
Dean snorted. "Do you though, really? You already thought I would be okay with you rotting away in here. No, you don’t know."
“Thank you, Sam,” Castiel said quietly, with a small smile that quivered slightly.
Jack nodded. "Yes, she was returned when everyone who was disappeared by Chuck returned." He turned toward Dean. "I understand why you’re angry. But please know that I love you, all of you. I have faith that you will be reunited soon enough."
creature, Castiel," the Empty spat. "Loving something as selfish as a human will just doom you to misery until the day you die and go to Hell. You’ve been to Hell, you know how much worse it is. Why take the risk?"
Dean flinched. “‘Typical Dean fashion’? Really Sam? Thanks a lot.”
Dean blinked. "Seriously? How can we rescue him? Please, tell me. I’ll do anything."
They didn’t speak again until they arrived at the motel. It was perfectly average, like many of the hundreds if not thousands of motels they had stayed in over the years. But Sam definitely finally perked up, jumping out of the car immediately after the car was parked. Dean followed behind a little more slowly. He didn’t want to interrupt their first moment together.
Dean didn’t want to see him leave yet, but he didn’t know how to ask him to stay. He just shook his head, and Castiel disappeared. Dean chugged the rest of his beer and headed inside. Time for another beer.
because of you, Dean!” He started laughing again while Dean glared. He managed to say, “When’s the wedding?” in between laughs.
This was too much for Dean. He didn’t deserve to hear such words from anyone, much less an angel of the Lord. “I... I can’t, I’m sorry. It’s too much.” He couldn’t look him in the eye, too afraid of what he might find there.
They didn’t speak a word as they made their way to Dean’s bedroom. Once they were both inside, Dean closed the door and locked it. He then turned around and leaned against the door, letting out a sigh, before making eye contact with Castiel, who was simply standing in the middle of the room, in front of the bed.
Bobby sighed. “I’ll look again, but if you’re that desperate to not kiss him, maybe you should ask another angel.”
"No, I definitely prefer more ass," Dean said, and punctuated it by moving his hands from Castiel’s face to his ass and squeezed.
He readied his charming grin while approaching her, and unleashed it when he smoothly sat down on the stool next to hers. “Hey, I’m Dean, can I buy you a drink?”
"If you were able to make me fall asleep all by yourself, you would’ve done it already. But I’m still here, talking, so that means I’m actually the one in control. And I’m not resting until I’m free," Castiel said confidently, while internally not feeling very confident at all.
say once the opportunity arose. He eventually settled on, “It’s been awhile.”
Dean’s jaw dropped again. A few feet behind them, Sam laughed nervously. “I think I’ll go and... get some food... be back later!” He ran out of the motel room and the door slammed behind him, but Dean didn’t hear any of it.
Hackles raised, Dean bellowed, “Drama?! Oh, I’ll show you drama!” He stepped towards Sam menacingly.
When Sam stepped away, Castiel turned his attention to Eileen. Eileen signed "welcome back" and Castiel also responded in sign, saying "thank you." At least Castiel still remembered some ASL, but it remained to be seen if he could carry a whole conversation in it, like he could’ve back as an angel. Eileen then hugged him as well.
Since it was late in the day by the time they were all done, Dean quickly cooked up some pasta for them all before they went their separate ways. Once Dean was certain they were firmly in their room, Dean snuck out in the Impala and headed to his favorite liquor store. In the past, he would only buy a bottle at a time, but that didn’t seem to be enough for Dean this time. He grabbed several bottles of Jack Daniel’s—not even wasting his time trying to buy beer, which was much weaker than Dean had patience for.
Castiel opened his eyes and looked directly at the Empty. "That’s where you’re wrong. Dean isn’t selfish, he’s the most selfless person I have ever known. I would risk anything, even Hell, to be by his side."
Castiel fell in love with him, specifically. It nagged at him constantly, even though he wouldn’t ask Castiel himself about it.
Castiel hesitated, clearly also realizing that this was unusual for them. Then he seemed to make up his mind and gingerly sat down next to Dean. He didn’t leave much room between them, a couple of inches at most.
Jack shook his head. "I agree with you. He shouldn’t be in the Empty. But I, personally, cannot intervene. It is however possible for you to rescue him."
Castiel woke up and discovered he was in the very same place as he was when he was taken by the Empty: the storage room in the bunker that also had a large devil’s trap. He was immediately relieved that he didn’t have to make a long journey to get to the bunker, as he did the last time he was human.
Dean was weirdly satisfied by that answer. At least Sam and Castiel weren’t carrying on a secret friendship behind his back. “No, I haven’t,” he grunted.
fall asleep in this place ever again! I am going to keep talking whether you like it or not!"
thinking about it. Why would Sam be thinking about this?
It had been years since all of that happened, and all that time, Dean had allowed him to believe that he didn’t love him. Not platonically or brotherly—he had already told him as much—but romantically. That could no longer stand.
When they were finally all done, Dean left Castiel alone temporarily to fetch Sam and Eileen. Dean and Castiel then sat side by side and across from them. It turned out Castiel could eat after all, and as he took a bite into his burger he groaned. "Dean, this is so good!"
Sam was the one to let out a laugh. "I know, and yet, I don’t know. It just seems surreal. I thought I lost her for good."
He gave Casey a sheepish grin. “Just in town with my brother for a couple of days. We run a freelancing business, always traveling, you know how it is.” Dean actually did not know how it is, but he recently learned that “freelancing” is an increasingly popular career choice. Freelancing in what, Dean didn’t know, but he never cared. It made for a good excuse for strangers, and they always filled in the blanks with their own assumptions anyway.
"No, I’m fine," Dean barked before heading straight to the library once more. Sam sighed and followed him.
Nothing, at first. But then... Dean couldn’t believe his eyes. Castiel’s fingers had just twitched. And Sam noticed it too. “Holy shit,” Sam said, clearly nervous, and eyed Dean. “Isn’t the True Love’s kiss thing supposed to be instantaneous?”
“Cas--” Dean took a deep breath. He forgot sometimes, or all the time, how old Castiel really is. It’s far beyond his comprehension so he preferred to ignore it. “I wasn’t talking about
“You never know, witches have a sense of humor. But I’ll do some research, see what I can dig up.”
Dean suddenly felt rage flowing through him at the mention of Castiel. He had been so relieved that Chuck was dealt with and that everyone came back, he almost forgot the most important thing of all. "But what about Cas, huh? You resurrected every last person on Earth, surely you can bring Cas back! After everything he’s done for you, he’s earned it!”
Suddenly, the vision of a blood covered Dean vanished. Castiel gained awareness of himself and remembered that the Empty took him. But why had he woken up? Had the Empty finally decided to torture him in a more direct way?
Dean awoke to knocking at his door. He slowly sat up on his bed, then cursed as the roaring headache set in. "What?!" he shouted at the door.
Dean looked away so Castiel couldn’t see his face, which had gone completely red. “It’s the boots,” he mumbled, barely audible.
Sam breathed in, glancing at Dean guiltily, before looking back at Castiel. “When you were under that curse, you... responded to me. Not like you did with Dean, but you still moved when you weren’t moving before. Why is that?”
“I think that can be arranged,” Castiel smirked back.
Castiel thought that he was giving up his life forever when he went to the Empty to save Dean. He never could’ve imagined that one last sacrifice becoming the beginning of a whole new life with Dean. For as long as he could help it, he would never leave his side ever again.
Dean let the insult slide over him as he always did. “It’s Cas. We were fighting some witches and he was hit by a spell, and now he’s not moving.”
Dean.
Dean launched into an explanation of the basic plot, though dwelled on describing the titular character. “Keep an eye on his feet. He always wears cowboy boots. That’s what makes him so sexy.”
Dean was thrown. Was Sam actually asking him that? He was asking that
“Yes, you are,” Castiel said, deadly serious.
Sam beamed. “Dean, you finally told him? Thank God. I couldn’t handle all your drama about it anymore.”
Castiel stepped back so he could glance at all three of them. Immediately Dean stepped forward and reached his hand out to graze the gauze covering his neck. "What happened here?" he asked softly.
Castiel’s stomach dropped. He had been hoping they would be able to just gloss over what he had said. He didn’t want to hear Dean verbally reject him. "It’s okay, Dean, I know how you feel. You don’t need to respond."
Dean whipped his head around to face him. "NO! No, it’s not that! I just thought it’d be something we could do together," Dean’s voice gradually lowered in volume by the end, and he immediately went back to facing in front of him.
"Yes, Dean. But I don’t regret it, not at all. Just being here with you," he paused, then glanced at Sam and Eileen, "with
Bobby’s eyebrows shot up. “Well, I’ll be damned. You’re finally admitting it.”
Sam gave him a Look. “Yes, Dean. How else would I do it?”
Castiel’s eyebrows shot up. “You find this character sexy?”
Dean flinched, eyes growing wide. “But she was your wife! Me and Cas, we’re, we’re not like that!”
Suddenly, Castiel’s eyes opened wide, looking directly into Dean’s. “Holy shit,” breathed Dean, his heart beating like crazy.
Castiel looked sheepish. “I’ve noticed that other people become disturbed when I suddenly appear.”
"Hi Dean, thank you!" Eileen said, then looked between the brothers. "So what happened?"
Sam and Eileen appeared to be muffling coughs—or was it laughter?—with their hands, and Dean told them to "shut up". Puzzled, Castiel looked between the three, but decided that deciphering whatever that was about wasn’t important. Even though he was a human now, he didn’t grow up human; there were certainly things he wasn’t going to understand.
Sam looked poleaxed. "You’re right, Dean, I’m sorry." He exchanged a look with Eileen, who nodded. "We’ll focus on getting Cas out instead, alright? But eventually we’ll have to start hunting again."
“Nothing has to happen if you don’t want it to, okay? But honestly,” Dean smirked, “I’d love it if something did.”
Dean felt the desire to lash out at him grow again, but realized that there would be no point. It was clear that Jack wasn’t going to change his mind. "You better be right!"
For a moment, nothing happened. Dean looked around, puzzled, and was about to speak when he became overwhelmed with dizziness, and he passed out.
“I bet you do,” Dean leered, before quickly waving down the bartender and ordering her drink. Once he turned back to her, he was finally struck by how blue her eyes are, even in the low light of the bar. His mind instantly flashed to Castiel’s brilliant blue eyes, but he quickly dismissed the thought. “So tell me a little more about yourself… I don’t think I ever caught your name.”
This made Castiel angry. He stood up from the bed and pushed himself into Dean’s personal space, glaring intensely. “Don’t presume to speak for me, Dean. Deny your own feelings as you please, but I have always loved you.”
Bobby sobered up. “Seriously, kiddo, what’s eating at you? You saved the day, you should be fine. You can get your sorry ass over kissing a dude.”
"But we want to," Sam interrupted. "Besides, I’m sure you two have something to talk about," he smirked as he picked up the plates.
Castiel blinked. “Okay,” he said, a little warily, “what is it?”
“So… you want me to continue suddenly appearing?” Castiel asked, confused by Dean’s contradiction.
Dread settled in his stomach. “You’re not saying...”
For an irrational second, Dean felt like Castiel was replacing him with Sam, and he just could
"What are you doing?" the Empty roared. "Stop it now!"
Sam frowned, clearly wanting to talk about it, but deciding to let it be. "Okay, we’re in the war room when you’re ready."
There was a definite sadness in Castiel’s eyes and tone when he says, “Of course. If that is all, I still have work to do.”
Dean tortured himself with possibilities for the majority of the drive, only stopping for food breaks. When they finally reached the motel they were staying at, Dean parked just long enough to let Sam get out of the car. “Going out, back later,” was all that Dean grunted before he drove away again.
“Ha ha, very funny.” Why did Sam and Bobby both have to go there? Dean tried very hard not to think about getting married to Castiel. He was terrified enough as it was just at the thought of
Castiel didn’t respond directly to Dean, instead directing everything about the case to Sam. The tension in the room was so thick you could cut it with a knife. This time around, Sam was not enjoying being the focus of Castiel’s attention--he stood anxiously, eyes flitting back and forth often between Dean and Castiel, clearly uncomfortable. Dean was desperately trying to focus on the details of the case in order to quell his urge to punch Castiel in the face for what he said earlier and now for calmly acting as if nothing happened.
The next day, the three of them headed back to the bunker. Dean was all alone in the Impala, since Eileen was following him in her car, and Sam decided to go with her instead of him. Dean had grabbed one of his cassettes and played it during the entire trip on the highest possible volume to drown out his own thoughts.
"Maybe so, but I know how much you value silence. So I won’t shut up." Castiel thought a moment about how to approach it, before starting. "Dean Winchester was born on January 24, 1979, to John and Mary Winchester. He is the older brother to Samuel Winchester, born May 2, 1983. When Sam was six months old, the family lost Mary to Azazel. Afterward, John turned to hunting full-time while seeking Mary’s killer. Dean spent his childhood bouncing from motel to motel while told by John to look after Sam at all costs."
, then quickly deleted it. No emotional crap over a text message.
"I’ll never give up on you, Cas. Never! Though… are you sure about this? You’d be a human again. Permanently. Are you actually okay with giving that up, just for me?" Dean appeared nervous.
"I knew from the beginning, Dean. He made the deal to save me, after all. But he asked me not to tell you, so I didn’t. I’m sorry, Dean. I truly am. But I can’t help," Jack said.
. You don’t age, so it doesn’t count.”
"Let’s talk about this in the morning," Sam said. "Get some sleep and we’ll talk, okay?"
He took a deep breath. “Cas, you got your ears on?” He paused, still feeling a little hesitant. “I.. I was hoping we could talk. Face to face. Please, it’s important. I’m at Bobby’s place, on Baby.”
“I don’t know, girly fairytales are your division Sam, not mine.” He aimed for dismissive but only hit disturbed, as images kept flashing in his mind--Sam, as Castiel’s True Love, getting married and having weird angel babies. The thought made him sick.
"Yes, Dean," Castiel said, and Dean responded by pulling him into a tight hug. Castiel immediately wrapped his own arms around Dean. They stayed that way for what felt like eternity, and yet also like no time at all.
Castiel narrowed his eyes. “Then what did you mean?”
"We’re trying to see if we can find a case," said Sam.
Dean took this as an excuse to study him. His clothes were super nerdy and a little bulky, making it more difficult to check out his body. He moved his gaze to his face and found him staring back at him. His eyes were piercing, and so deeply blue. Dean quickly glanced down to take in the rest of his face, lingering on his lips, before meeting Castiel’s eyes again. “Nothing,” he breathed. “Absolutely nothing.”
Sam looked even more confused. "How did he invoke it, exactly?"
"It’s a long story," said Sam, as the three of them headed inside.
“Of course, that’s still true,” Castiel said to Sam, and then addressed Dean, oblivious to his sinking mood. “I thought it might comfort you to know you do not need to shoulder the burden of my love alone anymore if it bothers you that much.” With that, Castiel disappeared with a flutter of wing beats.
He was so focused on watching them that he lost track of their actual conversation, so he started with surprise when Sam asked, “Dean, what do you think?”
Dean watched from a moderate distance as Sam knocked on the door of the room Eileen was in. The door opened, and Eileen appeared, a huge grin stretching across her face at the sight of Sam, whose own grin matched hers. They conversed briefly in sign, both saying hello, before Sam leaned down to kiss her. There was nothing brief or simple about this kiss; it grew more fervent as they wrapped their arms around each other in a tight embrace.
Castiel seemed pleased that Sam wanted him to stay, and no, Dean was totally not jealous. “Alright, Sam. What is it?”
Once safely in his room, he took a quick shower before opening the bottle, drinking until he no longer saw Castiel’s face whenever he closed his eyes.
version of Dean was horrifying enough, but seeing how close he got to killing the real deal was even worse. Only when Dean reached out to him, saying "I need you," was he able to stop.
“He was just joking, jeez Sam, don’t look so eager to kiss him, I knew you were gay.” He couldn’t resist the jab at Sam’s sexuality, though his words came out with a little more force than usual.
Castiel glared at Dean in full force and moved into Dean’s personal space intimidatingly. “This ‘crap’ is about saving people’s lives. Or do you no longer care about anyone other than yourself?”
Dean and Castiel looked at each other, communicating without words: should we tell them? Dean hesitated, then nodded. In for a penny, in for a pound. They didn’t say a word, opting instead to hold hands.
to get over kissing Castiel. He hesitated for a moment--did he really want to confide in Bobby about this?--but if he lied Bobby would know. “Kinda the opposite problem,” he admitted quietly.
“Good?” Castiel spat, glaring at him. “Why is it good that I am not interested in Sam when you have already rejected me? Are you trying to control me again?”
He silently crept back into the bunker, carefully balancing the bottles so they wouldn’t clink too much. He drank until he passed out.
He knew he needed to say it. It should be simple. Just three little words. Easy peasy. Looking into Castiel’s expectant face, though, left him stricken. He already knew he loved him back, so it wasn’t like he was going to be rejected. It shouldn’t be terrifying. Then why did it feel like he couldn’t breathe?
Sam started laughing and held his hands up in surrender. “Relax Dean, I’m teasing. I’m so happy for you guys, truly.”
A visceral part of Dean was scared, and his mind was once again flooded with images of Sam and Castiel getting married and living happily without him. But... it was Sam. If Sam wanted him, then by God, Dean would do everything in his power to make sure that Sam got him.
Castiel frowned. "I’m sorry, but there really isn’t anything. Only Jack was able to save me the last time I was here. Where is Jack? Why isn’t he helping you? Did something happen to him?" Fear gripped his heart thinking that the boy he had considered to be his son was gone.
know that. He knew that Castiel had lost everything in order to help them. That reminder only served to intensify the twisting in his gut.
Castiel’s own eyes widened as he registered what was happening, but quickly closed them as he returned the kiss. What started as a simple meeting of the lips quickly heated up. He wrapped his arms around Dean, pulling his body in so they were touching chest to chest, hip to hip. He lost himself in the feeling of Dean’s soft lips, juxtaposed with his hard body pressing against him. He never imagined that he might ever experience this, and it was far better than anything he could’ve ever dreamed of.
Sam, who was well-versed in reading Dean’s mood shifts, noticed something was wrong right away. “Well uh, that’s certainly interesting, Cas,” he said delicately, “but that’s not really important, is it? What matters is the here and now. Dean was able to wake you up right away, so…” Sam trailed off.
Dean smiled but it didn’t reach his eyes. “I hope so too,” he winked, mostly as consolation. He didn’t want her to think that he didn’t find her attractive, because she definitely was. In different circumstances…
, and something either a part of the person to be contacted, such as hair, or something that they owned. This proved tricky at first, as Castiel didn’t have many material possessions, but then Dean remembered that he once gave him a comb, after Castiel showed up to breakfast one morning with remarkably messy hair.
Dean’s mind blanked out for a moment at the thought of kissing Castiel. But then he realized Sam also included himself, and he couldn’t miss that opportunity. “Aww, Sammy, is this a confession? Do you looove him?” He really, really hoped that he was wrong.
“Yeah, I did,” Dean said as he grabbed his second beer out of the cooler, failing to elaborate.
Dean shook his head. "No, I mean, you meant it
“He looks like he’s sleeping, angels aren’t supposed to sleep.” It was unsettling, seeing Castiel look so... human. It reminded him of a certain trip to the future that he wanted to forget. “But other than that, no. We tried everything to wake him up too, but nothing has worked.”
Castiel had what appears to be the beginning of a smirk on his face. “So, if I understand correctly, people who wear cowboy boots are sexy, unless they are a ‘redneck’,” he added air quotes with this unfamiliar word, “or old. Unless they’re a being who doesn’t age, like me. So, if I wore cowboy boots, you would find me sexy?”
. He followed it up with the bar address.
“Thanks, Bobby,” Dean said and then hung up. He then looked at Sam, who was now watching him. “What?”
Sam frowned, looking sympathetic. "Dean, that was his choice to make. It wasn’t your fault."
at him. Not his polite, placate-the-boring-person smile, but a real smile. And Castiel had a ghost of a smile on his lips in response, and Dean was torn between being pleased that Castiel was smiling, and angry that it wasn’t because of him.
Sam’s eyes widened as he stepped forward to break them apart. “Okay you guys I think we’re getting off on the wrong foot here, how about we just talk about the case?”
Castiel looked at him wryly. “Trust me, I am well aware of your deficiencies in this area, Dean.”
When they left the room, Castiel reached for Dean’s hand, and Dean quickly held his, shooting Castiel a soft smile as he did so. They continued holding hands all the way to the kitchen.
Dean pulled away to look Castiel in the eye but kept his hands on his shoulders. "Sam found this spell that lets us talk to anyone in any realm. We’ve been trying to bust you out of here, but this is the only thing we’ve found so far."
Bobby narrowed his eyes. “Is this about Castiel?”
"We’re doing it," Dean said authoritatively.
. And you were angry about this not even ten minutes ago!”
The TV was currently in the middle of an episode. Dean filled Castiel in on what was going on. Unconsciously, he pulled Castiel even closer to him, so that their entire bodies were touching, and his arm remained draped across his shoulder. As his fingers slowly traced patterns on Castiel’s shoulder, the lingering tension seeped from his body.
“Hey Bobby,” Dean said, trying hard to sound casual.
. Then he remembered.
All of his freak outs distilled into two words: “gay panic”. He couldn’t really deny that had something to do with it. But-- “It’s not just that, Bobby. When I kissed him and he woke up, that meant…,” he in particular really didn’t want to admit this, “That meant I’m his true love. But I can’t be. Surely that’s a mistake, cause look at me! I’m a terrible person. I did awful things in Hell. I don’t deserve to be anyone’s true love, much less his.” This Dean knew, deep in his bones. He didn’t deserve love. Especially not from someone like Castiel, who was so much better than him it was laughable.
Castiel’s brow furrowed, but he relented. “Very well then.”
Dean glared at him. “What the hell was up with those questions, Sam? You don’t even like him!” Sam looked away, not meeting Dean’s eyes, and his stomach dropped. “No. Way. Sam, you told me you didn’t like him!”
Castiel continued to run, this time heading for the kitchen. No one was in the kitchen either. The dread intensified, but he would check every room in this place if he had to. His next stop: the library.
Bobby’s words weighing heavily on his heart, he knew what he needed to do. An urge to grab a beer to boost his courage nearly overcame him, but he forced himself to relax. Castiel deserved to hear this when he was sober.
For a moment, they stared into each other’s eyes. Dean dropped his gaze to look at Castiel’s lips. When their eyes met again, Castiel’s pupils were blown wide. Slowly, Dean began to lean in, and Castiel met him in the middle.
“I would not allow that to happen,” Castiel reassured.
Feeling thoroughly reprimanded, Dean only managed to say thanks before Bobby hung up. Sam caught the look on Dean’s face and laughed. “He got you good this time, didn’t he?”
Dean approached him again, this time turning him around in the direction of the kitchen, and kept his arm wrapped loosely around his shoulders. "Now I gotta show you how it’s done, you need to learn how to cook. It’s not that hard, really." They both started walking toward the kitchen.
Dean pulled the hair off the comb and put it in the bowl with the herbs. "This is it, right?" Dean asked.
. “What the hell, Sam?!” he yelled.
“The opposite problem?” Bobby asked, his face scrunching in confusion. “What, so you
“Yes. It was an invention of one of the Cupids. It was only a matter of time before a witch came across it. I should have a word with him though. It wasn’t supposed to affect angels.”
"I can’t do this in here, Cas. I promise, once we’re both back home, we’ll talk," Dean said softly. "But you have to help me make that happen. How can we get you out of here?"
“But it didn’t disturb you,” Castiel said matter-of-factly.
He headed towards the kitchen, planning on grabbing a beer. Sam called out to him. “Dean!”
They smirked at each other, and then immediately dived back into kissing.
Dean nodded slowly in agreement, still staring wide-eyed at Castiel. "Well, since you’re human now, we gotta celebrate the human way! I can cook up some burgers, or make some pie, or well, anything you want, Cas! You’ve earned it."
This time Bobby practically growled into the phone and Dean jumped despite himself, not expecting it. “I’m sorry, princess, did you want some quick and easy solution? Tough shit, this is what we got so suck up your pride and deal with it, Dean.” Dean was stunned into silence so Bobby continued in a calmer tone, “I’ll let you know if I find anything else, but don’t call and whine again.”
"You heard Jack, he’s hands off now. And he never said he got rid of monsters. So the world still needs us," Sam explained, while Eileen nodded in agreement.
? Dean couldn’t believe his eyes, but it was true, Sam had a little more color to his face now. “Thanks, Cas. But if I had kept kissing you, would you have woken up?”
Castiel pondered for a moment, tilting his head. “So you are suggesting that I always use the door from now on?”
Castiel’s eyes widened, but he told himself to keep his hope in check. "How do you feel, then?"
," he said teasingly, but with a genuine smile.
Seeing Bobby seem so disappointed in him just confirmed his worst fears. “See, Bobby? I’m just a disappointment to you, to everyone. Definitely not worthy to be Cas’ true love.”
“Hey Cas,” Dean said, then froze. What was he going to say? He had spent so much time thinking about what to say, he never concluded what he actually
Sam stared, then laughed. “Did you listen to anything we said at all?”
He leaned against the hood of the Impala and took a swig of his beer, looking up at the night sky. Then he stared back down at the phone in his hand, opened up to Castiel’s contact screen. He opened up a blank message, then stared some more.
"So you really did it? You’re human now?" Dean asked, looking concerned.
Dean let out a surprised laugh. “Already a fan and haven’t even watched it, huh? Damn, I’m good.”
Sam laughed, without humor. “What, are you saying it’s not true? Did something else actually happen?”
“Nothing’s wrong. I just can’t sleep. I thought a beer would help.” That wasn’t a total lie, Dean reasoned. Something was absolutely wrong, but he definitely wanted a beer. Especially after this conversation.
Castiel sighed. "You’re right, I was just so determined to save you. I thought it was worth it." He paused as something Dean said finally caught up to him. "Wait, what do you mean, you didn’t get to respond?"
Dean furrowed his brow. "Sam, Eileen, you guys don’t have to—,"
"Okay Dean," Sam said softly. He pulled out his phone and sent a hesitant text to Eileen:
Castiel’s brow furrowed at the use of “buddy”, but he nodded. At this point, the female bartender finally noticed Castiel’s appearance and asked for his order. Castiel just looked at Dean and said, “I’ll try whatever he’s having.”
Bobby started laughing. “Straight out of a fairytale, you two. You’re his Prince Charming! When’s the wedding?”
Notably, Dean and Castiel were left alone in the kitchen while they cooked. Castiel did wonder where Sam and Eileen were, but he was enjoying this stolen time with Dean too much to complain. They didn’t breach the topic of Castiel’s love confession or Dean’s response; instead, Dean caught him up on everything that happened in between instructions.
Dean had never thought about it like that before. He frowned. “No, of course not. He deserves to be loved, by someone worthy of him.”
Bobby softened. “Nobody does, but we do it anyway because we love them. Go tell him, son.”
"Not enough," Dean slurred, "because he’s still in my head. He won’t leave my head."
Dean laughed sardonically. “There will never be ‘no more arguments’.” They had never had an entirely peaceful relationship, after all. “But for now? Yeah, we’re good.” Not entirely. Not that Sam needed to know that, though.
. “Of course I care about saving people Cas, what the hell!” Dean looked like he was about to swing a punch.
Jack smiled at both of them. "Remember, I will always be with you. Goodbye." With that, he vanished.
“Oh! Sorry, that’s my bad. My name’s Casey, and I’m a librarian. What about you, Dean?” She smiled sweetly up at him as she sipped the drink the bartender just gave her.
Four days later, Castiel was still lying motionless on the bed. Before, Castiel had just looked asleep, but now all Dean saw when he looked at him was death. He knew he wasn’t dead, but Castiel was supposed to be up and staring at him, getting all into his personal space, and growling at him. He wasn’t supposed to be motionless on a bed. The more time passed, the more he couldn’t handle it, so he called Bobby. “Got any news?”
a moron,” he mumbled under his breath. Sam huffed a laugh, and that was the end of it. For now.
Castiel stared a bit like he didn’t believe him, but then he sighed. “Very well. But know this, Dean: As long as you reject me, you do not get any say in who I am or am not interested in.”
“Finally--” Dean looked gobsmacked. “What do you mean,
Dean hadn’t expected Castiel to be so close, and he visibly swallowed as he felt himself flushing. He could feel the heat radiating from Castiel’s body. Desperate to get his mind off it, he looked back at the TV. “They’re having a Dr. Sexy marathon today. You gotta watch it, man. It’s awesome.”
. Distressingly, Castiel wasn’t laughing it off (or whatever Castiel’s equivalent would have been)--no, he was tilting his head, looking thoughtful.
Dean wasn’t stupid, he knew what Sam was implying. He just wasn’t in the mood to try to tackle that problem at the moment. He took a swig from his beer and turned on the motel TV. He could worry about it later. Or never.
Dean’s brain temporarily short-circuited as he imagined Castiel wearing cowboy boots. He envisioned Dr. Sexy’s pair in particular. What a sight that would be. He’d still be wearing his typical tax accountant outfit, and then… cowboy boots. “It’d be kinda weird if you wore them, especially looking like that.”
Sam waited with baited breath, wondering how long he’d have to wait before seeing a response. Luckily for Sam, it only took a minute or two before he received a reply:
Everything coming out of Castiel’s mouth was just wrong, wrong,
Dean scoffed while clenching his fist. He could feel the toxic feelings bubbling up and over without any way of stopping them. “Why hello Cas, what new crap do you want us to do for you now?”
Sam appeared overwhelmed by the good news. "Thank you, Jack," he said earnestly as he pulled Jack into a hug, which Jack returned.
“Marriage is not required. I am content with just this knowledge.” The brothers looked back at Castiel and saw that he was, of course, serious.
happened? Even though...,” Sam stopped himself, as the truth of the situation dawned on him. “He told you he loves you, and in typical Dean fashion you pushed him away. That’s what happened, isn’t it?”
He deleted what he previously wrote and wrote,
Instantly all of Dean’s anger dissipated, replaced by a cold feeling of despair. He was a fool for ever believing for a moment that he could possibly be Castiel’s true love. Maybe the only reason Sam wasn’t able to wake him up is that Castiel hadn’t spent enough time with him yet--but surely Castiel would easily come to love Sam, much more than he could ever love Dean.
Oh, God. That was the worst question in existence. Dean wanted to hightail it out of there but also knew that it might make Castiel angry again. Yet he couldn’t just start opening up with everything. “If you want someone to talk to about feelings, it’s Sam you want, not me,” he deflected.
Castiel smiled. "I first met Dean when I pulled him out of Hell. I had never seen a human soul so bright or stunning before, and have never since. I quickly grew fond of him, and tried to warn him about the apocalypse, but Heaven rewired me. Even after the rewiring, his heartfelt plea for humanity convinced me to fight on his side. Even though we were too late, we kept fighting together." Castiel took a second to feel the grip of the tendrils around him, and found they had already slackened somewhat.
Dean nodded and said, "Thanks, guys." With that out of the way, Dean and Castiel joined them in making breakfast.
Dean was overwhelmed. They definitely butted heads sometimes, but he wouldn’t have it any other way. Wouldn’t want Castiel any other way but exactly how he is.
"Dean and I have gone through so much together over the years. Even though I have made my fair share of mistakes, Dean has always been there, willing to forgive me. I don’t know when I fell in love with him. There wasn’t a single moment, there have been so many. Maybe I was always in love with him from the beginning. It doesn’t matter. I wouldn’t want it any other way. It is a privilege to have come to know and love Dean."
Of course Dean needed him. Was that ever really in question? But Dean didn’t love him. Not in the way Castiel loved Dean.
Dean’s face turned red again but he didn’t deny it. Castiel, on the other hand, grew overwhelmed with dread. This was really it. Dean would finally reject him.
Eventually, they mutually pull away, but only far enough to be able to look each other in the eye. Castiel had a good feeling, but he wanted to know for sure. "So what does this mean, exactly?"
Sam laughed. “Never, jerk.”
“Of course I did! You were talking about... the case!” That was always a safe bet.
Bringing up Sam had also brought to surface all the toxic thoughts Dean had had lately in regards to Sam and Castiel’s relationship. This was why he suddenly lashed out. “But that’s what you’d really prefer, right? You might as well just go talk to him then since he’s apparently a potential true love! No need to waste time on me!”
Yet somehow it was enough to capture Dean’s attention. He looked up and his eyes widened. "Cas!" he yelled, jumping out of his seat and running toward him. He stopped right in front of Castiel, leaving very little room in between. "Cas, is that really you?"
“Have you heard anything from Cas lately?” Dean asked Sam, who was sitting next to him in the Impala, staring out the window. Dean was aiming for casual but missed by a mile.
He just didn’t understand what that really
“No, of course not,” Castiel said, sounding a little amused. “I care about Sam, but I will never love him the way I love you.”
Castiel begrudgingly got up, put on a robe, and took care of business in the bathroom before returning to Dean’s room, where Dean hadn’t moved at all. Castiel attempted to start getting dressed but Dean stopped him by hugging him from behind.
That seemed to spur Dean into action. He stepped away from the door and approached Castiel, stopping only inches away. He raised his hands to cup his cheeks, and before Castiel could respond, Dean kissed him.
“But you want to be, and it’s scaring the pants off you, am I right?” Dean just stared at him, which Bobby took as a “yes”. “You forgot I practically raised you, you idjit. Of course I know when you like someone. So what, you’re having gay panic? Well get over it, princess, because I can tell that angel of yours is good for you.”
The bartender looked between them and suddenly smirked, but just said “You got it,” before leaving to make the drink.
Dean sighed. "Fine, but you might as well just keep the robe on. I have another one I can use." Dean stepped away to don the robe.
When they pulled apart, Dean went ahead and went for a hug too. "We’re gonna miss you man."
“Then what’s the damn problem?!” Bobby roared. “He loves you. You clearly love him, though you won’t admit it. Oh, right. That’s the problem. You’re too chickenshit to admit you love him. Dammit boy, you’re gonna give me an ulcer.” He pinched the bridge of his nose.
Instead, Castiel broke the gaze and looked down at his feet. Dean followed his glance and saw that he had replaced his sensible shoes with cowboy boots. Dean stared for a moment--it really was quite striking to see him in the boots--but then he started laughing. “Shit, Cas, you didn’t have to actually do it.”
Sam scoffed in disbelief. “You’re a moron.” Dean could tell that he actually meant it too, and it hurt. But what did Sam know anyway? He wasn’t Castiel’s “True Love”.
Which is how Dean found himself in a random bar one night, after a successfully completed case. At first, he had considered trying to pick up a woman again. But even though there were a couple of attractive women in the bar, he found that he just wasn’t in the mood to try, the memory of his previous attempt still fresh. So here he was, the sad loser sitting alone at a bar.
to be his True Love, this was ridiculous--
Dean felt Bobby’s words like a physical blow. They cut right to the heart of the matter, and worst of all, he was right. “Fuck, Bobby,” he breathed. “I don’t know how to do this.”
Castiel blinked, clearly not expecting the question. “I care for you deeply, Sam. The curse must have sensed that.”
When they finished eating, Sam and Eileen glanced at each other and without a word stood up. "Thanks for the meal, you guys. We can handle the dishes tonight," Sam said.
They fell back into silence, and a few minutes later they’re pulling up at a motel. Once they had checked in and settled into their room, Dean grabbed a beer from their cooler and excused himself. “I need some air.” He walked out before noticing how Sam was smiling again.
"Dean," he breathed, barely above a whisper.
Castiel tried the grip of the tendrils again, and they were now slack enough to make his move. Quickly and with no hesitance, he brought up the angel blade and sliced across his throat.
Dean showered and quickly ate some cereal before heading to the war room. When Eileen looked up from her laptop to see Dean, she signed good morning, which Dean returned. "So what’s going on?"
, remember?"
"No!" Castiel shouted. "I will
Dean mustered up a smile for Sam’s sake. "That’s awesome, Sammy. Let’s go get her."
Bobby rolled his eyes. “Son, we all know you like him. That you like each other. You broadcast it every time you look at him.” He paused in thought. “In a way, it reminds me of how I used to look at Karen.”
“So what’s so important?” Castiel asked, confused.
Sam blinked. "Just like that? Why?" Dean looked away, refusing to answer. "Okay, but I should come with you, so I can ask him how to get him out."
Jack smiled sadly. "Don’t get me wrong, Dean. I love Cas. But Chuck made every person on Earth vanish, apart from us. That was an egregious wrong that only I could correct. But Cas chose to use his deal with the Empty. I can’t invalidate his choice.”
The conviction in his voice tied Dean’s stomach into knots. He didn’t deserve it. He wasn’t good enough for Castiel. It must’ve been some kind of mistake that he was his true love. His hand fell from Castiel’s shoulder as he looked away briefly to compose himself. He didn’t want to ruin this, so when he turned back to Castiel, he had a forced smile. “Whatever you say, Cas. We need to start actually watching the show, you superfan.”
"I want to find her more than anything, Dean, but it can wait if you need to talk—"
Bobby simply looked between Dean and Castiel and snorted. “Finally.”
It took Dean a moment to process what Castiel meant, but once he did, he saw red. He was so angry he didn’t think for a second about what he was saying. “Are you saying that it’s actually possible?! But
Once they had all the details down, Dean expected Castiel to immediately vanish. Instead, he seemed to have something else up his sleeve. “By the way, Sam,” he began, carefully not acknowledging Dean’s continued presence in the room, “I did some research on the curse. It turns out you may have been right. I am not sure how long it would have taken, but it is possible it could have worked.”
His stomach somersaulted. “What, you don’t want to keep kissing your one true love? I’m disappointed in you, Sam. Though you knew how to treat a lady... er... person better than that.”
So he painstakingly chose his favorite Led Zeppelin songs, particularly the ones with romantic meanings, and created the tape. He later approached Castiel and told him it was something he could listen to while on the road. The way Castiel smiled and thanked him had been burned into his mind ever since. The fact that Castiel later tried to return it, though, showed that he didn’t understand what it meant at all.
Castiel sat up and looked around to be sure that the Empty was gone, then he watched in wonder as the rest of his grace flowed away from him. It almost hurt to look at, such bright light contrasting with the sea of darkness. At first, it was a continuous stream, until it finally ended. As the grace moved further away from him, Castiel looked down to see his body flickering, then he was conscious no more.
Dean stomped toward him. "What a stupid cop-out, you son of a—," Sam pulled him away from Jack and Dean was shocked into silence, settling on a glare.
“Okay,” was all Sam said, with a weird little smile on his face. Dean didn’t know exactly what Sam was thinking but he knew that whatever it was, it was wrong.
“So you won’t be in town for very long, huh?” Casey asked coyly, with an assessing gaze.
Dean lit up. "You really think that would work?! Why didn’t you try that when you got here?"
When he glanced at Dean, his face appeared to be oddly red. "I’m, uh, glad you like it, Cas," Dean said hoarsely.
? He had been curious too, of course, but he didn’t want to think about it. If Sam was asking about it, though, that meant he
Dean turned to face him again. “No, not
Dean snorted and immediately lowered the volume so he could hear himself think. Finally. He grabbed his phone and texted Castiel.
When Eileen noticed them holding hands, she signed and said, "Congrats!"
“You mean you still haven’t…” Sam trailed off, then sighs. “Nevermind. I’m glad you’re doing alright now.”
In the next breath, Castiel arrived in a flurry of wing beats. “Hello, Dean.”
The next morning, Dean and Castiel headed to the kitchen for coffee. To their surprise, Bobby and Sam were already there, making bacon and eggs. They also looked surprised to see Castiel.
-- Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night's Dream
Dean’s anguish must have shown on his face because Castiel stepped closer and put a hand on his shoulder. “Dean, are you sure nothing is wrong?”
Dean softened. “When I said nothing was wrong, I meant that you didn’t have to change a thing.” He had always known that Castiel was attractive; he had functioning eyes after all. He just refused to outright agree that Castiel was sexy.
They were silent for a moment before Dean cleared his throat. "Let’s go to my room." He stood up, then reached out his hand toward Castiel. Castiel grabbed his hand and Dean pulled him up. Castiel immediately let go after that, despite wanting to continue holding hands.
“Angels can be affected by spells? Well, I’ll be,” Bobby said gruffly. “He’s just unconscious? Nothing else wrong with him?”
Dean was flustered. “What knowledge, exactly? Cause I think it made a mistake. I mean, I’m straight, and you’re an angel, what would you want with a human anyway?”
Jumping into emotions already? Jeez, so much for stalling. Dean huffed a laugh. “You know I’m not really that good at that stuff, right?”
Sam hesitated. "Well, not exactly. But this spell claims that you can contact someone who is in any realm. Heaven, hell, purgatory, even the Empty. This is the closest thing I’ve found to anything involving the Empty. Maybe we could study the spell, figure out how it’s done?"
Castiel closed his eyes in an attempt to keep himself from crying. The Empty was right. He was only going to be rejected. Yet… "I would rather have Dean in my life, no matter what that looks like, than be stuck here without him."
"I couldn’t care less about this human, Castiel, you need to stop!" the Empty screeched.
“I defer to your judgment,” Castiel said dryly. “What is it about?”
Castiel sighed. Had Dean really not understood him at all? It would be so easy now, to backtrack, to save himself the pain and suffering of rejection, but he couldn’t lie to Dean. Not about this. "Yes, Dean. I’m in love with you."
"I’m well aware, but I still had to try," Castiel said.
"You are a truly
She smirked. “I definitely know how to handle my liquor.”
Dean nodded and Sam left him alone. Dean hurried to use the bathroom as originally intended before passing out in bed.
The words and the gaze made Dean feel a little hot under his collar for some reason. He cleared his throat and changed the subject.
“Seriously? Wow.” Sam blinked a few times, then looked back at Castiel. “If Bobby thinks we should be doing this, then we should do it, Dean.”
Dean shook his head. "I’ve been wracking my brain for days and can’t think of anything. I think we just need to hit the books. Surely, somewhere in this bunker is something that will help."
“Wait, seriously? Just like that?” Dean blurted out, not wanting to see this. Not at all.
Dean looked at him, gave him a shit-eating grin, then turned back to the TV as he increased the volume even further
Castiel smiled and looked down, flustered but pleased. “Thank you, Dean. So no cowboy boots?”
“Does Bobby really think he could be awakened with a kiss?” Sam looked perplexed but also disturbingly thoughtful, and--no. He had to shut that down now.
Castiel looked puzzled. “But if you’re drinking this, then it must be good,” he said as if that alone proved it. The bartender returned right then to give Castiel the beer, and he thanked her before taking a sip. He made a slight face as it went down, and the sight of it made Dean laugh.
"No, but this is pretty late for you," Sam said as he took a look around the room. His eyes locked onto a bottle of whiskey jutting out from under the bed. "You’re drinking again? Dean…"
The Empty rolled its eyes. "Spare me this delusional drivel. I think it’s time you went back to sleep."
Sam eyed him warily. “Do you think he’s okay? Want me to text him?”
But Dean wasn’t sure he
The thought shouldn’t have made him as miserable as it did.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Cas, I could’ve given you a recommendation for something else to try.” His beer wasn’t exactly high quality stuff--just cheap.
Then it dawned on Dean: he didn’t have to be alone. He whipped out his phone and sent a text to Castiel:
Sam turned to look at Bobby. “Finally? Finally what?!”
and sent it. Seconds later he realized that it sounded a little ominous, but it was too late.
! There are too many rednecks and old people out there who wear cowboy boots! Not all of them are sexy, believe me.”
Sam looked between Castiel and Dean and asked, “So, what did Bobby say?”
Dean stared at him for a moment, seeming at a loss for words. Then he spoke. "But that’s just it! All that other stuff you said, how I’m the most loving person on Earth? That can’t possibly be true. I’m not as good as you think I am, Cas, I’m not. You shouldn’t love me like that."
let that happen. “No, I’m staying. Everything you tell Sam, you tell me.” Sam shot him a weird look, but Dean was too focused on staring Castiel down.
The next morning, Castiel woke up, only to find Dean already awake and gazing at him. Castiel smiled and leaned in to kiss him. "Good morning," Castiel said.
Dean was
God, did he really love him?
“Because you still want to control me,” Castiel interrupted, looking pissed now. “You have no right--”
Soon enough they were all seated at the table, Sam and Bobby on one side, Dean and Castiel on the other. While eating, they all got caught up in a lively debate over the best way to kill vampires.
“Nothing happened, Sam,” Dean stalked back to his bed without a glance back, so he missed the surprise on Sam’s face.
Bobby sighed heavily. “No, Dean, I just hate seeing you do this to yourself. Punishing yourself by refusing to go after something that would actually make you happy. Punishing Cas, too, from the sound of it. Now, tell me this: does Cas deserve to have his true love reject him?”
Things appeared to go back to normal after their conversation. No one brought up the topic of the curse or true love. It was almost as if it never happened.
Dean couldn’t breathe. He should be saying something pithy right now, but how could he, with that bomb dropped on him? “How... how can you say that, Cas? You can’t mean that. You’ve
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean mumbled. He looked back to Castiel lying on the bed. Even with not exactly encouraging news, the phone call eased some of his anxiety, so Dean didn’t see death in Castiel’s face. His face looked peaceful, a look he had never seen on his face before. It... suited him. If you looked past the fact that he was an angel, a dude angel at that, who shouldn’t be sleeping, he was almost... beautiful.
"Of course. I would like anything you make, Dean," Castiel said earnestly.
“None of your damn business,” Bobby spat. “Now spill. What’s wrong?”
? We literally just beat God! Don’t we deserve a break?"
. At least it wasn’t directed toward Sam.
In the middle of the meal, Castiel suddenly placed his right hand on Dean’s thigh under the table. Dean startled at first, but then carefully covered Castiel’s hand with his left hand. They shared a private look that promised more to come later.
The Empty covered its ears. "Shut up!"
He sounded calm when he told Bobby the news, but as his eyes drifted over to Castiel lying on the motel bed motionless, he felt a curl of dread unfurling in his gut. Sam was similarly affected - he was sitting on the bed opposite of Castiel, staring at him and wringing his hands.
"Yeah, you’re right," Sam sighed slowly.
Sam scowled. “No. But we have to try. Cas deserves at least that much.” He walked over to the bed and sat carefully on the edge of it.
Sam cleared his throat behind them, and they reluctantly pulled away. "Welcome back, Cas," Sam said, pulling Castiel into a hug of his own. Only this time, it was kept brief.
Instead of waiting for a response from Dean, Sam quickly texted Cas the motel address. A second later, Castiel appeared before them and immediately looked at Sam. “Hello Sam,” he says warmly, in yet another aberration from normal--Castiel
Castiel was stunned. He truly wasn’t expecting this at all. "I’m sorry, Dean. I didn’t mean to hurt you."
"Theoretically, yeah, but I’m not sure if that’s helpful—"
He didn’t let it go. “But it sounded like you, personally, find him sexy.”
Dean was taken aback by what he thought was a non-sequitur. “What? Of course not!”
It was obvious what Castiel was implying--that he could have fallen in love with Sam instead. So why then, exactly, did he fall in love with Dean? Dean kept wracking his brain for any memories that could possibly explain this but came up with nothing. Just the phenomenal mistake of raising Dean from Hell in the first place, and then getting repaid with a bunch of bullshit Castiel would be much better off without.
"Dean, you don’t need to try to bust me out of here. I’m here out of my own choice, to save you. I wouldn’t have done it any other way," Castiel explained.
"Cas!" he heard a voice call out. It sounded remarkably familiar. But could it be—? "Cas, wake up!" Dean’s unmistakable voice was louder this time, and accompanied by a hand on his shoulder, rocking him.
too thoughtful, in Dean’s opinion. This could not be happening. He had to stop this
Dean almost snapped his neck at the speed in which he looked up. "You found a way into the Empty?!"
A low thrum of arousal shot through Castiel’s body, and he couldn’t help but follow in Dean’s footsteps, moving his hands slowly down Dean’s back until he grabbed his ass in return. "I agree, I think more ass is best."
“What? Dude, no. This isn’t a fairytale, he isn’t gonna be woken up by a kiss or whatever.” The thought of someone kissing Castiel--of someone being his true love--tied a knot in his stomach, and he gritted his teeth against the uncomfortable sensation.
Dean spluttered. “He’s--it’s in his name! He’s Dr. Sexy. Of course he’s sexy, that’s the point.”
Dean booked another room in the motel, one further away from Sam and Eileen as he definitely didn’t want to hear any suspicious noises from their room. Before heading to his room, he took the Impala and drove until he found a liquor store and picked up a bottle of Jack Daniel’s.
"Why don’t we just stay in bed?" Dean murmured, pressing a kiss to Castiel’s neck.
“Oh, I bet you were mushy last night,” Sam said, wiggling his eyebrows.
“Is… that it?” Castiel asked, sounding a little deflated.
Sam gave him a weird look. “You really think some random woman would be his True Love? Dean, he’s only talked to hunters and supernatural creatures. With his grasp on humanity, you really think he’d find love with someone outside of all this?”
Despite all his efforts to the contrary, he still found himself wondering what he’d do if he were that other version of himself. He tried to throw himself into hunting, into his constant grapple with the Mark’s dull, simmering weight on his arm, but that
This game is slower, more calculated, and Dean’s not gonna lie. It’s
“Get out of my head,” Dean muttered, squeezing his eyes shut as he leaned over the sink.
“Oh, thank god,” Dean breathes, flapping his hand around behind him until he finds Cas’ jacket, grabbing it and shoving it into the angel’s arms. He retrieves his flannel from the ground and shrugs it back on, and then he and Cas beeline back to the table to grab their jackets.
Dean groans as if in great physical pain. “You’re killing me, man. I don’t even… I’m not even gonna comment on the album. But you want range? Freddie Mercury. Axel Rose. Geddy Lee. They’ve all got it goin’ on.”
The second game takes longer. On top of having settled into it, Cas is out for blood now, and it’s that drive that makes him go for the ballsy shots he hadn’t been attempting before. Thankfully for Dean, though, he hasn’t quite figured out which ones are the right ones. And so Dean takes his second win.
This man had seen things.
Dean made a face like he was unsure whether to speak, and while part of Sam wanted to laugh, he decided to let their surrogate sister take the lead in the effort of comfort. God knows, after everything the years had thrown at them, Dean could surely use it, even if it was only for a night. And so, eventually, the meaningful looks won out, and Dean sighed, giving in and opening his mouth to spill.
He would never let go of that.
Just, wanna try you on
analytical sometimes; he gets so caught up in mental calculations that he misses the sneaky shots, the ones that make Dean a good hustler. Dean’s planning on at least a few more games, though, so maybe he’ll get into the groove and start to give Dean a run for his money.

Sam’s voice was speaking from behind the camera’s view, and the viewing angel squinted, making out the form of Charlie (wrapped in blankets), and then Dean himself, rested at her side.
The angel stopped, then moved back, and Dean felt something catch beneath his sternum. Like he wouldn’t be able to bear it if Cas retreated any further.
Dean lays Cas’ jacket over the back of his chair. “Alright then. This time I’m gonna have to play for your tie, though. I don’t think the barkeep’d be cool with you wandering around lookin’ like some kinda lost Chippendales dancer.” He regrets saying it as soon as the words come out of his mouth, because now there’s a

Cas looked down into his cup, and smiled, barely having to ponder for an answer. “I do, Dean,” he answered. “If this place has become your home, then I will be happy here. Because if this is your home….then you are mine.”
Dean continued, voice snapping as his fists clenched, “if I could carve the grace out of you before all the rest, so I could watch you really bleed, really

to ruffle your feathers.”
“I’m just gonna… clean up,” Dean said, his voice somewhere between a mutter and a mumble, and Cas nodded, glancing once at the empty, almost frighteningly inviting bed before sitting down in the chair off to its right.
Dean awkwardly catches the jacket, still warm from Cas’ body, and stares. Because Cas, now that he’s down to his shirtsleeves, is taking the opportunity to loosen his tie a little, pop the top button of his shirt, and then efficiently roll up his sleeves one by one. “I want a rematch,” he says when he’s finished, starting to empty the pockets again. “If you’re amenable, that is. We can play for the same stakes.”
Dean watches Cas out of the corner of his eye: he’s been working on being able to eat lately, and he’s finally started to get the hang of it. He doesn’t make his ‘ew, molecules’ face, so it looks like things are going his way tonight. He catches Dean watching and smiles.
He understood.

“What were you listening to?” the angel asked, pulling the Winchester from his swirling thoughts.
"Then don't try not to," Cas whispered back, his hands coming up to cradle Dean’s face.

Sam frowns as Crowley turns back around, confused at the non-sequitur. “Uh. I guess not, no.”
Sam snorts, and Dean shoots him a scathing look over his beer. “Shuddup, bitch. He doesn’t know what he’s talkin’ about.”

Dean laughed. “I’m kidding, angel. As if I’d keep you from your ducks on a day like today,” he said.
Sam opened his mouth to pass comment, when an audible shuffling in the hall cut him off, and a hedgehog-haired, robe-clad Dean Winchester walked through the entryway; walking up to Cas’s side, picking up a coffee mug, and shooting a half-loving, half-disgruntled look Cas’s way.
“Yeah, Cas,” Dean said, clearing his throat as he sat up. “I’m fine.” He said nothing else, but the angel didn’t move to leave, and Dean was almost set on edge by it. A thin, sharp edge of desperation and hope that a part of him had begun to call home.

It was in the air, in every cone of frost that clung to the trees and the fairy lights draped over and through their branches. Dean had never been much for the whole “holiday spirit” thing, if he was being honest with himself. Maybe it’s because he’d killed spirits for a living, instead of living, before he’d gotten to take a break.
Cas shifted to his knees and moved infinitesimally closer, eyes wide and filled with so many unspoken promises to keep Dean safe that it made the afflicted hunter hunch further into himself.
when we got down to business.”
“Okay. Uh, I’m gonna…” Dean trailed off, completely wrong-footed. His palm cold now that he’d been forced to relinquish Cas’ sleeve, he crossed to the door and gently pushed it closed. He really didn’t need Sam poking his head in here right now, and… he hated that the thought popped into his head, but for a moment, Cas not protesting the closure of the only exit almost made it seem like he really
“Last chance, Cassie,” Dean growled as he knelt over the angel, his voice pitched nice and low. He fisted his hand in Cas’ coat, relishing the way the fabric strained beneath his fingers, and yanked him closer. “Wanna take the easy way out? Have a little fun and then let me go?”
Cas began to slip out from beneath the bedsheets (deftly avoiding Dean’s efforts to keep him close by distracting him with a kiss on the cheek), and went to brush his teeth for the morning, then heading out to the Bunker’s kitchen where Sam was already putting on a fresh pot of coffee and Jack was eating a plate of waffles.
“I wonder what you’d look like strung up in the dungeon,” the Winchester told him, shoulders lifting, wrists bared like he was begging for forgiveness and punishment all at once. “What you’d look like if I broke out the Enochian cuffs and pulled your arms up so high you’d have to balance on your tiptoes. Your wings —  or whatever's left of them these days — I’d love to play with those, you know— I wonder what sawing them off would do to you. And I wonder what it’d feel like to drive the First Blade into you, and watch, just

wear one?” Dean grinned triumphantly.
Cas remembered sitting in one of the corner tables as a student, studying in between bites. He’d even interviewed one of the owners for an article he wrote for the college newspaper, mentioning how fantastic their breakfast platters were and how they wouldn't completely break a struggling college student's bank. The owner thought the article was funny, plus it gave them a boost in business, and Cas had received free pie for a week straight. Of course, he’d saved each slice for Dean; Cas was never one for sweets.
Cas composed him himself quickly and joined Dean before he truly did try to leave without him. He was still silent and barely paid attention when they stopped off at KFC. All he thought about was that kiss, how soft and gentle it had been. How one kissed a lover, not someone who was… whatever were they? He didn't realize they approached the hotel until they stopped, turning his head to look at Dean ready to ask why they stopped, realizing where they were.
“Maybe. Are you in a better mood?” Dean drawled out mischievously, not moving his hands.
For a few seconds, Dean thought Cas was going to add something since he was just looking at him. Instead, he simply hugged Dean. “What's this for?” Dean asked, trying not to enjoy the feeling of Cas in his arms.
“Just an iced tea, please.”
“It's not even seven o’clock yet, dude!”
“I'll take my shower and then we can get ready to go.”
“Hey, you okay? You were sleeping.”
Dean didn't answer just kept walking towards him with a grin.
occurred to him.
“Right,” Cas rolled his eyes.
A few minutes later, the waitress returned with their drinks and they placed their order. As she walked away from them, Cas reached for his glass and pulled the paper top off of his straw.
“And yet you say that with a smile.”
But he had an idea. He was in a good mood, finally having gone out for some fun with Cas. That was what was behind his behavior in the parking lot. Just feeling happiness as he teased Cas. It was always fun to play around with him. Whether it was in the form of a bad joke, or teasing him about something, or even tickling him. Cas at times was too serious and Dean felt it was his duty to get the guy to relax. But he had to ruin tonight’s playfulness by kissing Cas. He didn't know the exact moment was he was struck by the urge to kiss him. All he knew was he couldn't let a moment pass without doing something, and so he did. It was hard to tell if Cas was upset by the kiss.
“I thought you were boycotting toast?”
Cas rolled onto his back, panting heavily. “Relative to what?” He asked in between pants.
Dean had been staring. That had
“What time are we heading out in the morning?” Cas asked, sipping his tea.
Any further discussions were thwarted by Sam’s return, informing them he’d found a back door but it was securely locked. Cas glanced over at the metal security gate for only a moment before it suddenly sprang open. Dean shot him another concerned look. “Cas…,” he said softly.
They remained quiet again as Sam typed on his laptop. The silence broke when the spell began digging into Cas again, groaning and gasping with his eyes clenched closed tightly, catching both their attention. The moment Cas thrashed about in his seat, Dean said Cas’ name, hoping it would help, feeling stunned as he watched Cas’ thrashes becoming more pronounced and falling to the floor, Dean felt all the air leaving his lungs. What the hell was happening to his angel?
For a few more minutes, Dean didn’t move until Cas shouted his name loudly, pulling out his finger, not needing to wipe his fingers clean. He gently wrapped Cas’ legs around his waist, slipping his cock easily inside him. His eyes closed, the feeling of Cas enveloped around him. Rocking against Cas started slowly before Dean’s pleasure had him moving faster, his moans increasing in volume. He wasn’t going to last. He knew he wasn’t going to last, calling out Cas’ name. He nearly swallowed his tongue at the sensation of both his balls being rolled. Oh, fucking god! He tried telling Cas to conserve his grace rather than worrying about him but he was rendered speechless, crying out loudly, nearly a shout, as he came hard, Cas clenching around Dean as his own orgasm overtook him. Dean caught himself on both hands to keep from flopping down on top of Cas, who just pulled him down anyway, kissing him softly on the lips.
to touch him. “Dean…” That was the only thing he managed to say.
He tells Sam he thinks she had saved him before they trek back to find the car. Naturally, Sam is full of questions and has no more answers than Dean. He tells Sam that she had thanked him. This he remembered clearly. He had been the one who bore the Mark, even if Sam had been the one to say the spell that removed it and set her free. It had been him she had thanked, and Dean had felt her energy, which sure hadn’t done anything to reassure him except confirming she was, in fact, evil.
“No. But I wanted to be.” He grinned, hoping it sounded sincere.
Sighing with frustration, Cas just looked at Dean with his hands on his hips. “Fine. I'll do what you do then.”
“Fuck,” Cas whined, making Dean chuckle.
“Dude, I thought we agreed we didn’t need him?” Dean said, glancing at Cas long enough to give him a small smile.
“If you're not careful, you'll be
“You asked.” Cas chuckled, finishing up.
Neither Dean or Sam answered as they glanced at each other in question and worry. Would Cas be further under the spell’s effects when upset, or in this case, insulted?
“You calling already? It's only been a couple hours.”
“Stop that,” he laughed, trying to sound menacing.
“Feel… what?”
Cas chuckled, feeling like things were going back to normal between them, thankfully. They continued with their playful banter until the waitress returned with their food. Dean noticed the lack of fries on Cas’ plate and grabbed a handful of his own, plopping them down next to Cas’ sandwich.
“Maybe you'll start dating again,” Cas said, hoping he sounded indifferent.
Cas never stopped kissing at his pulse point, his tongue tracing along the skin as Dean felt Cas undoing the button and zipper of his jeans. He was going to lose his mind. He reached around, his hands desperately trying to grasp at something, and grabbed fistfuls of Cas’ hair.
if he was embarrassed. Hell, he had done so plenty of times over the years. The man had no problems calling him out whenever he thought Dean was being a… what was the term? Right, assbutt. Wherever he got that from, Dean didn't know. All he knew now was Cas acted as if he…
His hips moved on their own, meeting with each stroke of Cas’ fist, causing more moans. Then the touch suddenly stopped. Dean opened his eyes, lifted his head to look down at Cas in question, but Cas just winked and smiled. Then the fire started again as he felt the wet warmth of Cas’ mouth envelope him. He cried out, feeling Cas’ tongue wiggling underside of his cock as Cas took more of him in his mouth.
“Is that why you refuse to let me heal you? Because you don’t trust me anymore?” He stubbornly avoided Dean’s eyes.
that? Not that it wasn’t wanted, he wanted it very much. But Cas never gave him any indications about having mutual feelings. Maybe… it was just one of those things guy friends did? Although the idea of sucking off one of his male friends didn’t sound very appealing.
Cas smiled politely at the hostess, glancing around as he checked customers out but kept one eye on Dean to prepare himself should he come back. But Dean just waited for him at the end of the counter, once again playing with the various items.
“Hey, we made it, right? We just took the scenic route!” Dean laughed.
“The Darkness,” Cas said. “What does she want?
“How else am I getting it back home?”
“Shut up,” Dean said, rolling his eyes.
“I wish we flew instead,” he grumbled.
“I haven't done anything,” Dean told him, chuckling with him.
“I’ll do anything to help,” Cas encouraged.
“Eh, I hadn't really thought about it. But you know me, I tend to be sentimental. I might fight to keep my number.”
pokey ass. So, there's no danger of that.”
“Half hour,” Dean repeated. “If it’s longer, I’m leaving your ass.”
Cas acted insulted, balling up his napkin and tossing it at Dean, who only laughed harder. Flagging their waitress down, Cas signaled for their check.
“Yeah, but you love me!” Dean quipped back, causing Cas to look back up.
Dean gently rolled Cas onto his back, never breaking their kiss. His fingers fumbled slightly as he undid each button on Cas’ dress shirt, moving his mouth from Cas’ lips down to his neck, licking at the skin over his  pulse point before moving further down. Cas’ soft moans encouraged him as Dean began kissing the exposed skin of Cas’ chest, trailing his tongue towards Cas’ right nipple, the tip of his tongue teasingly stroking around the tip of the stiff nub. Cas moaned louder in encouragement, Dean smiling at how much he was turning on his angel. Dean’s left hand stroked Cas’ stomach, his fingers trailing along Cas’ ribs, chuckling as he felt Cas flinch under his hands, pleading for no tickling. This time was for their pleasure. Tickling games could wait. Moving his hand away from the sensitive ribs, Dean expertly unzipped Cas’ pants, snaking a hand inside, pulling his underwear down to wrap a hand around Cas’ quickly stiffening cock. A louder moan escaped from Cas, writhing slightly in pleasure.
Soon they were back on their way towards the turnpike. Just a couple more hours and they could finally stop for the night. Had Dean would have been agreeable, they could have flown to L.A. But, unfortunately, Dean had a deathly fear of flying, no way in hell he would have agreed to stepping one toe on a plane. Cas’ lower back already started protesting about the van’s shocks, which he only knew about because of Dean, trying to remember if their first trip left him feeling this uncomfortable, already planning on soaking in the tub later.
Cas was watching him, but where Dean had expected to find piercing, inescapable eyes, he found a softer brush of emotion peering curiously out at him.

Sam levelled him with a classic bitchface no.5, and with that in his mind, Dean took off, throwing on a warm flannel and a pair of jeans and setting off to the soothing thrum of Baby’s engine.
the WInchester said eventually.
The thing that was Dean’s shadow brought to life responded by hitting Cas again, smiling at the sound he made. This wasn’t quite the way he’d thought they’d get here, he mused absently: Cas gasping beneath him, Dean straddling his hips. But this would have to do.
Sam shot him a warm, knowing look, and went to grab a bag, but then stopped; glancing back at the size of the box Dean had brought inside (whose length was able to stretch from roughly from the top of either of their chests down to their belts).
that would be a
“Took you long enough,” Sam said once his brother entered the room, standing from the single-person armchair and moving to help set the bags of snack food on the coffee table by their feet. He was caught by surprise, however, when he found a full stock of bottles, and not just their typical beer.
Dean let out a shaky, heaving breath. “No, you don't understand. You don’t know what he’s— what

of the rage being directed his way. This was where anyone else might have given up, might have drawn their blade and chosen to save themselves; but Castiel would never be at peace if his final act was to fail the man he'd only ever wanted to save. “Dean, I know you. I know… I know your anger.”
They stood, staring at each other. Dean’s breathing, sharp and restrained, was the loudest sound in the room.
Which, fun fact, actually kind of worked. That headache was now mostly gone, instead replaced by a bundle of nerves in the pit of his stomach.

He went for the solar plexus, for a left hook, kidneys again, then right in the gut; and with each hit he landed, each grunt of pain Cas made, raw delight fizzed through him and set the Mark purring against his arm like a pleased cat. It wasn't sated, though. He wanted more,
“It wouldn’t have been the same without you.”

innocent unsafe.”
I think I'm in love, to-night
watched Dean stare at Cas with a soft, sappy little smile on his face, glance away, and have Cas immediately look up to do the same to him. It makes him want to scream.
“Huh. I wonder if that’s why the Samsquatch and Charlie have been so squirrely today,” Dean thought aloud. He laughed. “I managed to get blackout drunk last night, if you’d believe that. They had me worried I’d gone and said something I shouldn’t have.”
Dean grins. “Thanks, but flattery won’t get you anywhere. Now c’mon, pay up.”
But Cas simply raised an eyebrow, and Dean winced, realizing just how much ground he’d lost.
Cas beamed at this, any mention of the ducks that had settled by a creek in the forest near the Bunker almost always able to make him smile.
“Hey,
Cas buys them shots. Well, technically Dean (via some rich schmuck named Phillip Clancy’s credit card) buys them shots, but that’s not the point. Cas asked what Dean wanted, since he’d won and all, and Dean had said tequila. No celebration is a real celebration without tequila, and that’s the whole reason they came out tonight, anyway. They even get the bartender to deliver some shots to the table for Sam and Crowley, which gets Dean a half-hearted bitchface from across the room.
Not just greasy, blackened smoke.
bad for each other, hm?”
how that will happen.”
“Good luck!” Charlie told the angel as she watched him begin the path down the hall, practically alight with energy, and Sam cleared his throat, his eyes expressing the same sentiment.
Cas laughed softly, but stilled, then hesitantly prompted him back to the dialogue.

what Dean looked like when he was angry.
“Dean,” Cas said, dropping his hand but not moving away. “What’s happening?”
He remembered every inch of the muscled body that had pressed flush against him, every swirl of white light that had murmured and rippled its way inside him to remind him of the place where he used to have a soul. A
So come back to me now, Dean,
Dean snorted. “Warrant’s ‘Ode To Tipper Gore’ is about as far from soothing as you can get,” he told him, picking up the headset and setting it on the nightstand. “It’s fifty-five seconds, solid, of the word ‘fuck’, with a couple other colorful things sprinkled in here and there for variety. It’s like some crazy liberal arts major on speed decided they wanted to make a sound collage. I had it on loop to kill my headache.”
Dean felt a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding release, despite the nerves persisting in his chest.
But Cas remained as stoic, as unmoving as ever, and even with Dean’s hands clamped bruisingly over his biceps and his full weight bearing Cas into the wall, he didn’t so much as flinch when he met Dean’s eyes. Dean’s black eyes.
“Castiel, Castiel, Castiel,” he said with a long sigh, obviously relishing this as he shook his head mournfully. “C’mon, now. I thought you were smarter than this. You couldn’t feel his pining? The constant, never-

the void inside him inches from overtaking all the rest. He opened his mouth to say something, anything, anything to convince Cas to run.
“Well, then. Call me after you show it to him, dear. There will be celebrations, and I expect full credit.”
Dean gasped, just as his knees threatened to give out. Shadows danced and twisted in front of his eyes, snaking over his arms; but he couldn’t tell if they were really there or not, and he stumbled back, as far from Cas as he could get.
the Winchester continued, eyes bright, despite his eyelids drooping.
Nina started laughing incredibly hard, as though infinitely pleased with herself for reasons she need never clarify, and something thudded to the floor before she came running down the stairs; her black bangs swept across her face like she was a living whirlwind. “Bold of you to assume I need a blunt to get like this,” she said, before leaning over to kiss her girlfriend on the cheek. “Did you meet Castiel, Laur? Is he here?”
Dean laughs as he fumbles them out of his pocket, leaning in close. “Go ahead, dude. Take the wheel.”
Dean looked at her, drunkenly, but almost trepidantly as if in a hope he never believed would be realized. He sighed, letting his head drop to the cushions of the couch behind him, reaching forward blindly for his bottle but finding nothing except crumbs to meet his fingers. “Figures,” he muttered, though whether it be about ‘humanity’ or about the lack of accessible alcohol, no one could tell. “It’s always one human,” he said bitterly. “What, was it that lady who conned him into babysitting for her?” he asked, his tone dripping. “Of course Chuck bought into that crap.”
“No…” Charlie said, shifting closer, but slightly out of the way so that Sam would get the full view of his brother’s face. “Try again. Or, oh, tell me something else about Cas.” She gave her tipsy target a nudge, just gently enough that he wouldn’t fall over completely. “What’s another thing you like about him?”

They treat you like an object.
“Jasmines are very nice flowers, Sam,” Cas spoke up. “I personally rather enjoyed the scent drifting through the halls in those few weeks.”
But the embrace only made Dean’s tears come harder. He tried to turn his head away, tried again to push Cas back. He didn't deserve this. He
To make Dean happy — to make Dean see himself the way Castiel saw him, as the man who made him love the world — he would give anything. Everything.
Thanks so much for reading!
Dean had woken up the next morning with a hangover that made his brain feel like cotton, but his heart like that of a cottontail’s, the two sensations out of sync in a way that thankfully dulled as early hours bled by into the afternoon.
It was only due to his rapidly diminishing self control that it was the mirror, and not Cas’ face, that was the target of his rage.
The two began to walk through the homey streets, and Dean found himself seeing more and more through Cas’s eyes and less through his own, matching his smile at every drifting snowflake or visual of children playing in the road. The air practically glinted as they went, and eventually they reached Dean’s first destination, a little espresso shop just large enough to fit two workers inside while the customers ordered at the window. The wood was painted a cheerful red, tinsel draped over the sloping roof, and the smell of coffee and
Dean muttered.
“You listen to me, Castiel,” Dean spoke, his voice low, something visceral fighting its way to precedence. “You don’t wanna take me seriously? Fine. I’ll
Cas,” Dean gritted, unable to rip his eyes away from Cas’ as his throat tightened, like the void inside him had slithered up around his neck to form a choking, empty noose. “We don’t have time for a lecture right now, you have to—”
He orders them beers and nachos as consolation, because Crowley put Cas off his burger and Dean feels kinda bad about it. Cas gives him a grateful smile, and they spend a little while putting a dent in the plate of cheesy goodness before moving onto game number two. Dean tries not to gloat too much, but judging by the competitive spark in Cas’ eye by the time he tells Dean to set up again, he wasn’t very successful.
Dean really did let out a sob at that, welling up from the tangled mixture of relief and fear and other unnamed things swirling inside him.
Finally, after some murmurs that were likely of the soothing variety, the television blinked on, and a segment of music began to croon through the sound system mid-song- quickly recognized as a slow cover of

Cas looks up sharply, his expression one of nearly comical disbelief, and Dean feels his face heat. Because what the

Cas smiled fondly and looked on at where Jack was translating between Sam and a pair of baby ducklings on the rocky bed of the creek, and after thinking for only a moment, he opened the sketchbook to its first blank page, preparing to capture the moment in front of him.
“Come back,” Cas repeated, undeterred. “I know you want to. I know you can fight this.”
“I am saying that inside you, there is only light, and

Can't, believe I tried it
He put his head in his hands.
Now, he could perhaps finally express that.
His hands didn’t quite fall, but he’d stepped back before he realized what he was doing, and Cas’ feet slid the few inches back down to the floor.

“How about we wear these on our walk, hm?” Castiel asked, his voice a low hum. “Jack is ready to go.”

Their hearts rose, and this slice of the earth completed its lap in the same moment that their lips met- brimming with love against love, life against life.
“I am right behind you, Nina,” Cas said, waving slightly, drawing her attention. “To answer your question, yes- Laurleen and I were introduced.” He smiled, shy but genuine in that sweet way of his. “It’s nice to see you again.”
Cas blinked, his face somewhat flushed, and he swallowed his suddenly very present heartbeat, nodding in acknowledgement.
Dean rolled his eyes, knowing that woman would flirt with just about anyone.

hovering just close enough that Dean can feel the heat of him at his side, making funny little observations, asking questions. Dean finally makes a weak sort of comment about personal space, and after that Cas backs off a little. But he looks really damn pleased with himself, and Dean is consistently messing up shots now.

“You nearly wrecked my copy of
“Dean!” Cas called out, nearly knocking his chair over in his haste to reach Dean’s side.
“Who do you think pinned that sketch of Jack with the sparrows down on Chestnut street to the fridge, huh?” Dean asked, leaning in to drop a quick kiss to his angel’s cheek. “I see you, Cas. That’s the advantage of being a little spoon,” he said with a wink. “I’ve got the best view of the interior.”
“I love you, Cas,” he whispered aloud, and without waiting another moment, he pulled his angel towards him; abandoning their cocoa and gently pressing their lips together, in a gesture that was impossibly warm despite the winter, more so than either of them had ever imagined it could be.
“What?” Dean asked, looking up from where he’d been slipping the art supplies in the bag, trying to keep organized vertically. “Whoa, where’d those come from?” He looked at the twin hoodies, the sides facing him completely dark with nothing to identify them, and frowned, definitely knowing himself not to be the online shopper who bought things that weren’t unique.
And sure, Dean might be having himself a good old-fashioned crisis at the moment, but that doesn’t make him any less of an awesome pool player. He can do this.
Dean’s hand stilled for a moment in Cas’ hair, and he closed his eyes. He was glad Cas couldn’t see his face. “Yeah. Free.”

Dean pressed a soft kiss to the top of Cas’s hat, smiling to himself all the while.

Dean claps Sam on the shoulder as he stands up. “Well, then. I’ll leave you two to catch up.” He escapes before Sam can voice his displeasure, and as he hightails it over to the pool table Cas has claimed, he smiles.
Oh god, Dean realized.

Dean looked at her, and then sighed, muttering something only slightly audible.
Sam takes a drink of his beer, considering that. Then he looks at Crowley. “And that’s it? That’s your whole motivation?”
