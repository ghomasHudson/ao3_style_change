The day after that he felt back to normal, even if he had lost a little weight.  Though it was typical, and he would gain it back in no time, Cas was not pleased to see it.  He tried to keep forcing Dean to eat more and finally Jimmy had to step in and help Dean convince Cas that he was fine.
He didn’t have to wait long before Cas began to wiggle under him, the scent of his arousal increasing.  Dean placed wet kisses along his jaw line and down his neck.  Cas bared for him and Dean inhaled deeply before nipping at the mating gland.
“Uh,” Dean stuttered.  He seemed to recover quickly though.  “Yes, you’re right.  I guess I just didn’t think about it.  Caught me off guard.”  He paused and looked at Cas again.  “You do look very beautiful, Cas.”
They were seated in a booth that provided some privacy and instead of sitting opposite him, Cas slid in next to him.  It might have been out of habit since that was how they always sat at the diner for lunch, but the tentative smile Cas gave Dean as he pressed their thighs together told him that Cas had deliberately sat next to him tonight.
Dean tried to go for a compromise.  If Cas wanted him to dress a certain way while they were out he would do so, but he hoped at his own home he would be able to relax and be himself.
“You bet!” Dean told her moving to the refrigerator.  He ignored the slight twinge in his ribs telling him to slow down.
: Are we still on for dinner tomorrow night?  I was thinking of leaving work a little early so that I can be there when you would like and do not interrupt Emma’s routine.
“I’ll get going then,” Gabe told him.  “I’ve got to get back to the office.  I’ll let you know if anything major comes up, otherwise I’ll just check in to see how Dean’s doing.”
When he woke again he could hear voices on the other side of the closed door.  His nest was still in tact but he could see the trash and other things that had accumulated over the last few days had been removed.  The condoms were no longer on the nightstand but in its place was a bottle of Gatorade and a protein bar.  There was a bottle of Tylenol next to it.
“WHAT?”  Cas sat up straight in bed and tried to push the covers back.  Balthazar was there trying to prevent him from getting out of bed and pulling his IV and monitors off when a nurse bustled into the room.
“We want it,” Dean told her firmly.  He was a little surprised at how much he actually did want it, but he would keep that to himself.
Dean sucked in the happy alpha pheromones that poured out of Cas, pleased himself that Cas had asked.
Dean attached the basket to the saddle before giving Cas a leg up.  Dean couldn’t help but admire Cas’ long, lean frame as he mounted the horse.  His leggings did nothing to hid his firm thighs and tapered calves.  He could feel his arousal begin as he ran his hand gently down the side of his mate’s thigh.
Dean kept his eyes down and bared his neck to Cas slightly.  He glanced at Jimmy, who seemed equally as upset as Cas but seemed to be ok with Cas handling whatever they were going to do.
Dean’s mouth began to water like it would before he would be sick.  His stomach was hollow and his eyes filled with tears.  His breath became shallow and he wanted to get away.  He knew that Cas hadn’t been with another omega because he had been at the ranch.  But he must want to if he had condoms in his room.
Cas retraced his steps and went up another flight of stairs to the family’s quarters.  He softly padded down the hallway to Dean’s door.  It was ajar and he could see his mate sitting on the small sofa in front of the fire.  The hall was chilly and as the sweat dried on his skin, Cas was feeling a bit colder.
“Daddy!  I missed you!  Grandpa said that you were sick and had a fever.  I’m sorry you were sick.”  She gently patted his cheek and smiled at him.  Dean squeezed her to him and planted a kiss on her head.
Dean relayed the story of walking home and being surrounded by the three alphas before being forced into the woods and bound and gagged and held down while each alpha took their turn.  Cas nearly broke as he had listened to his mate describe what had happened.
“That’s because you didn’t deserve it,” Dean said.  Three sets of eyes turned to him.  He watched as they all widened.  Ellen and Sam’s eyes widened in concern that he wasn’t hiding.  His father’s widened at the sight of his very large belly.  “Respect is earned and you never earned it.”
He put on a smile and tried to make it real.  His throat tightened and his hands were sweating.  It was late, so things were slowing down and Dean was sure his blockers had worn off some.  He could smell himself, so he’s sure Cas could too.
Cas nodded.  “I understand that.  Would it be helpful to have someone around when the pup is born?  I will have to go back to the office.”
Dean’s cheeks heated and he looked down.  “Cas, you don’t have to do all this.  I know you’re glad I’m here.  You do tell me and make me feel appreciated.”
Cas barely let him take a breath while they were undressing quickly, almost frantically.  Dean could scent the thickness of Cas’ arousal that hung heavy in the air, and the lighter, sweeter scent of his slick that matched it.
Dean had become an expert at avoiding conversations and feelings in the last week.  Cas had tried to engage him every day and Dean just couldn’t.  He had agreed to meet with Pam because Ellen and Bobby had encouraged him to.  It certainly couldn’t hurt him and she would maintain his privacy.  Ellen told him that she understood there were things that he couldn’t say out loud to anyone who was connected to him, so this might be a way for him to process and purge some of those things.
“Yes, thank you,” Cas replied.  He sat across from Dean and put his coffee on the table.  Dean noticed his large hands and long tapered fingers.  His nails were cut short and square and his ring finger was bare.  “Are you a student?” the alpha asked with a nod to his text book.
Cas pinched the bridge of his nose before he replied to that comment.  What Sam deserved was a swift kick in his spoiled ass, but Cas didn’t want to argue so he tried to focus on getting Sam to understand what was really happening. “Sam, for the last time, your view of your brother is wrong.  I don’t know why you can’t see it but-“
When he was done his alpha felt satisfied in a lot of ways but he couldn’t wait for Dean to get there.  Sunday felt like an eternity away.
“You do, Cas,” Jimmy agreed smirking at him.  He stepped closer, the chores forgotten.  “But I think it’s good for both of you.  You need someone besides me and the animals to care for.  It’s who you are, Cas.  You were meant for a large staff for the ranch.  And Dean has that too, and not just because he’s an omega, I think.  He’s got the same personality.  He wants to care for others.  You two blend together well, and your wolves know it.”
John shook his head.  “I think that you’re doing the best thing for those omegas and pups.  I think that they need security and it will be a long road for them to be able to understand how omegas live here.  It will be important to try and find the omegas with pups mates.  Maybe we think about how we can facilitate that later.”  He glanced at his friend. “Maybe that would be a time when other packs would welcome new members.  Omegas who don’t find mates here could possibly travel to nearby packs and see about settling there.”
Cas nodded as he moved through the street expertly.  “I do.  I have two brothers, both betas, who are older than me.  I’m the youngest and only alpha.  Balth is a professor at the college, which is why I was down here today.”
“Thank you.  That’s very thoughtful.  I enjoyed the train, though.  I could get up and move around when I needed to, so it wasn’t too bad.  Thank you again for letting me come by train.”
Dean shifted and took a deep breath.  “I quit drinking almost entirely, and I never get drunk.  I don’t have one night stands anymore.  I take care of my house by cleaning and maintaining it.  I go to the grocery store and buy healthy food.  I eat well because I cook a lot at home.  I practice yoga every day almost and take a class once a week.”  He paused.  “I used to go into work hungover a lot and even still drunk sometimes, which is incredibly dangerous in my line of work, not to mention I probably shouldn’t have been driving.  I don’t do that anymore.”
Sam shrugged him off and Dean patted his shoulder before he headed into the kitchen.  Sam had done a good job of cleaning up his mess but the counters still needed a good wipe down and the floor needed to be swept.  He loaded the dishwasher, put another load of clothes in the washer and dryer and tidied up the living room.  He checked the trashcan and saw that it needed to be emptied too, so he did that.
He damned John Winchester to hell for the millionth time.  He would find a way to exact retribution on him for this.  And he better hope that Dean was alive and well when they found him.
After a long hot shower where Dean continued to discover just how much fun he had last night, he popped three pain pills and downed a full glass of water before he set his alarm for work and passed out for a few more hours.
Dean frowned at that.  “So, you think they will move, or will you?”  He was careful to phrase it properly this time.
Cas encouraged him to change things in the apartment, so Dean did a few things.  He wanted a mixer to be able to bake, so he bought one.  Cas was happy that Dean had done something for himself and complimented him immensely on the cookies he made for dessert that night.
“Oh, well, guess that means that we weren’t bonded that well.”  He pushed away from the table and put his bowl in the sink, suddenly not hungry anymore.
Dean felt Cas step next to him and he pulled away.  He wrapped his arms around his stomach and tried to block out Cas’ distressed scent.
“Oh, okay,” she replied.  She typed on her computer and told him the information.   “The next bus leaves for Omaha, Nebraska in ten minutes.”  Dean nodded and pulled out his wallet.  “That will be sixty-seven dollars and forty-nine cents.”
Cas looked up at him with sad eyes and Dean could do nothing but squeeze his hand in understanding.  “I’m sorry, Cas.  He’s been a real asshole to both of us.  Did he say anything?”
“You’re just an omega, Dean.  It’s what you were supposed to do.  You couldn’t even do that right if Sam challenged me the first opportunity he had!  And you went and got yourself ruined and now…” He gestured to Dean’s stomach.  “What the fuck is this?”
“No, Ellen. I’m ok. I’m here to work, right? Gotta earn my money!” He plastered on a fake smile and moved to the end of the bar where the four or five people have gathered.
The guards nodded and they headed out and down the dusty dirt road towards the wood.  They made idle chit chat while they walked, but Cas kept his stride wide.  He was glad he had worn a tunic and leggings today so that he could walk quickly without the skirts holding him up.  Lilith seemed to be doing ok with hers, but Cas set his pace quickly.
Cas kissed Dean soundly and they only broke away when the hoots and hollers started.  They both laughed and Cas slipped his hand into Dean’s jeans pocked and found the box he knew was in there.  He discretely slipped the ring on Dean’s finger and laced his hands through his.
Cas’ clear, blue eyes pierced Dean and he felt the intensity of them to his soul.  Cas and Dean had had a rocky start and the ups and downs of the last few months were trying, but Dean wanted him.  He wanted his mate more than anything and suddenly he realized.
“It would…?” Dean prompted when it looked like Sam wasn’t going to finish.  Sam looked at him sadly.
Dean had remained on the bed with Cas as Tessa examined his mate.  “He’s been resting and we’ll make sure he continues.  There are two things, though.”  Dean wanted to make sure that Cas would be taken care of and he knew Tessa would give him her honest opinion.
She paused and looked down and Dean didn’t need his nose to understand that what he was about to hear was not going to be good news.
Dean chucked and did his best flourishing bow before slapping Jo a high five in payment.  She grinned and pulled off her mask as Emma came running over in her yellow Belle dress up gown.
“Hey, Cas,” he said rubbing their cheeks together.  Dean breathed in their combine scents of happy, mated family and pecked Cas on the lips.
“Now, son, why don’t you tell us a little more about what is going on.  How did you reconnect with Dean?”  His father’s voice was calm, but the alpha authority was still there.  It helped Cas to be able to calm a little more.
He was putting together their morning snack at the island while they played.  The cabin they were currently housed in was a different one from where they first lived.  It was the second closest one on the property and they had moved in about six months ago.  Even though it was exactly the same as their other one, Dean didn’t like it.  It wasn’t home and he had struggled to make it feel like one.  He was glad it was almost over.
Dean’s stomach rounded with his pup and while he loved it, it was bittersweet.  Now that there was physical proof of a life growing inside him he was even more scared.  His scent continued to strengthen and Cas couldn’t keep his hands to himself.  Dean didn’t mind and he welcomed Cas’ innocent touches on his belly and neck.  He let him hold his hand and they nested together.
He was suddenly so tired.  He climbed into the bed he hadn’t slept in since the first week he arrived and burrowed down into the covers.  He couldn’t hold his eyes open anymore and he closed them, hoping he would feel better when he woke up.
He was patient, kind and supportive.  He took the time to teach Dean about the ranch and how to do new things.  He appreciated everyone and made sure they knew it.  He took care of Dean in ways that the omega didn’t even know he needed.
“I’m afraid Alpha Novak is not at home right now and visitors need to be announced.”  The alpha stepped forward again and Dean took a step back.  “I’m going to have to ask you to leave if you don’t have business here.”
This time it was Dean moaning over the food.  Cas smirked as he watched Dean eat.  He was happy that his surprise had gone over well.  There had been a lot of good surprises tonight.
“He wears my engagement ring around his neck,” Dean said softly.  He glanced at Pam to see her surprise.  “I saw it a few days ago when we were in the nest.  He hadn’t told me about it but I saw it.  He told me that he wears it to remind him of better times and how he wants that again.  He said…he said that he wanted to have it when I was ready to put it back on.”
Cas slid into the seat beside him and held his palm up on the seat for Dean.  Dean saw it and quickly glanced up with a smile on his face.  He took the alpha’s hand and blushed slightly at the way Cas looked at him.
Dean wiped his hands on the towel next to him and stepped closer to her so she could scent him properly.  “I’m fine, Amelia.  I really appreciate the fact that you would even ask, but it’s fine.”
Dean stared at the phone, chewing on a hang nail.  Dean wasn’t sure what to do. It was dangerous, this road he was following.  He needed to protect himself and Emma and getting close to the father of his child while always knowing he couldn’t have him as his mate might be the worst torture in the world.  But wouldn’t it be good for Emma to have an Alpha role model?  He knew she has several already, but Cas was her father.
Sam gave him a thoughtful look.  “I’ve been meaning to talk to you about this, Dean,” he began.  Dean tensed up.  Nothing good ever came from someone saying they had been meaning to talk to you about something.  “Uncle Bobby asked me to come and stay with him when you left.”  Sam looked at him with puppy eyes, apology and hope all in one.
“Sure,” he agreed.  He stood up straight and turned so he was leaning on the railing and facing Pete.
Cas looked at him the way that Dean was becoming used to.  He looked at him like it had never occurred to him that normal things most people might have wouldn’t be something Dean would have.  Cas was focused totally on Dean and he wondered what the alpha was thinking.
She pulled away with a slight frown on her face but Dean smiled brightly at her and she dropped it.  She said hello to Cas, who was talking with the other pairs.  Cas turned him slightly so that he could introduce him.
Dean stopped, rooted in his spot.  His mouth went dry at the sight of them coming closer to him.  He hadn’t realized that they were twins.  He was sure that his surprise and excitement were threaded through his scent.  These alphas were gorgeous.  They had matching chiseled jaw lines with bright blue eyes.  Both wore a white cowboy hat that hid dark hair.  They were slightly taller than Dean and they exuded alpha.
“I am your friend, Dean,” she told him imploringly.  Dean looked at her skeptically. “I know I have not been a good friend, and I have some serious making up to do, but I do want to be your friend.”
Cas could scent excitement and happiness and relief and love all wrapped up in Dean’s scent.  When they pulled away, he brushed the tears from Dean’s eyes and looked into them.  He could see his whole future in their depths and he couldn’t wait to get started.
Dean thought he would feel embarrassed or self-conscious about situations like this, where he would have both alphas knotting him one after the other.  He realized that it wasn’t uncomfortable and the alphas were relaxed and happy, too.
Gabe stood as he laughed.  “You do that.  I suggest you talk to Balth though.  If he finds out later that Charlie and I both knew and he didn’t, he’s going to be pissed.”  He gave Cas a two-finger salute and let himself out of the office.
“Do you think you’ll be able to tell her these things even if you never fully forgive her?”  Pam asked.
Dean grabbed clean clothes and closed the bedroom door behind him.  He needed a shower desperately along with some time alone to process the last few days.  The scent of Cas was strong in the shower and a sense of longing swept over him.  He hadn’t realized until Cas brought him back that he could miss someone who was right next to him.
When Amelia had told him that she had offered to made dessert so that Dean could do anything that he needed to do he had thought that was kind of her, but quickly realized that the pie on the stove was not the cookies he was expecting from Dean’s menu.
He had called Cas when they were about a half hour from the house.  Dean was glad he had because his heat was coming fast.  It was a good thing they had gotten an appointment for the clinic when they did.
“I’m fine, alpha.  Help me up?” he asked.  Cas nodded and helped Dean carefully to his feet.  Dean reached into the medicine cabinet where he had stored an extra toothbrush and toothpaste a few weeks ago.  He began to brush his teeth and met Cas’ unhappy face in the mirror.  “Ahra?” Dean questioned.  Cas blinked and refocused on him.
Cas pulled the reigns up when they got to the back stairs and halted.  He dismounted and helped Dean down before he placed a kiss on his cold forehead.
“I think Papa might like a new scarf.  He doesn’t have one and he always says his neck is cold when I mention that he needs a haircut.”  Emma looked pleased with herself.  Dean didn’t have the heart to tell her that haircut or no, Cas’ hair was going to be wild.
He filled in the timeline and remembered talking to Charlie before he headed back to Dean.  He saw his mate perk up at the sight of him and his demeanor changed when Cas pulled him close.  He saw the affection in his eyes when he had looked down at Dean and remembered that it was true emotion there.
The rest of the day passed in a blur.  Before he knew it, Cas was being herded out of the kitchen by Ellen.
“Sounds like Cas,” Chuck commented.  Dean nodded.  He was glad to see a little of his omega peek through the fear and trauma of the last two days.
“You have truly made a feast for us and I’m a little shocked and unprepared for how easily you’ve slipped into our lives and how much better you’ve already made it.”
Cas drank while the healer fussed around him.  She checked the linen that surrounded his torso before gently rolling him to see his lower back.  She examined his split lip and the bruising on his jaw.
“What did you say?” he yelled.  He stood and Cas was ready to help if John stumbled, but the alpha stood strong and tall.  Cas knew that this was what they wanted to happen.  John needed to appear in complete control and sober so that it would be a fair fight.  Cas seriously doubted there were many people who would challenge a win for Sam even if John was black out drunk, but still.  Cas could see the slight hesitation in his movements though, which meant the drug was working.
She left to put in the orders and Dean shifted slightly on his seat so that he was facing Cas, one leg between Cas’ and his foot on the stool rung underneath.
Everyone was packed into two cars an hour later as they drove across state lines towards Dean. Cas could barely contain himself as he drove his SUV.  Charlie sat next to him in the passenger seat to help guide him to where Dean would be and Sam fidgeted in the back.  Bobby and Ellen were following them in the truck behind.
Cas frowned, scenting the air slightly, obviously understanding there was something more going on that he wasn’t privy to.  He looked at Dean curiously.  Dean gave him a reassuring smile and stood, holding out his hand.
He swallowed and nodded once he was sure that Cas wasn’t angry and that he would be okay.  Cas slowly reached forward and gently grasped his wrist.  Dean looked down where Cas’ hand was and didn’t meet his eye.
Sam turned to Cain and waited for the elder to extend his arm before Sam clasped it.  “Sam,” Cain said in greeting.
“I had a bath brought for you,” he told him indicating the large tub that had been placed before the fire.  Cas could see the still steaming water inside.  He sagged in exhaustion, smiling at his thoughtful mate.
Dean listened to his words of praise and reassurance and he felt better.  Cas continued to press kisses to his shoulder and neck until his knot deflated.  He cleaned Dean up again and told him to dress.  They made their way downstairs and Dean was suddenly shy and nervous.  Jimmy had heard them upstairs and he knew what they had been doing.  Dean wasn’t sure why he was uncomfortable now, but maybe it was a combination of all the new changes and not only taking one alpha but knowing he would be knotted by another after they fed him.
Cas helped him into the back of the car and directed Alfie to take them home.  Dean had stayed in the middle of the seat and leaned on Cas’ shoulder.  Dean felt a lingering sense of de ja vu, but he knew the evening’s outcome would be much different.
“Weeeelll,” Jimmy started.  He paused, clearly not knowing what to say.  He glanced at his twin, who was also sitting stiffly on his chair, a guarded look on his face.
“Of course,” Dean quickly agreed.  He needed to get his wallet and phone before they left but otherwise he was ready.  Cas made to lead him out of the door but Dean paused and turned back to the dresser where his things were.
At six months pregnant he still felt pretty good and this pup was an easy pregnancy so far, so he couldn’t complain too much.  But the reality of being pregnant with a third pup while having two other little ones was difficult and exhausting.  He chuckled at himself.  It would be a lot worse when this pup arrived.
Tessa smiled.  “It’s the willow bark.  Many people don’t each much when they take it like Cas is.  That’s normal, but he’s going on three days without real food and he needs his strength to heal.  Ellen put a few things on the tray to try and get him to eat,” she continued, indicating the tray on the table.
Cas blushed and bit his lip in embarrassment as Dean straightened.   He didn’t release his hold on Cas though, which made him happy.  He looked out into the faces in the room and thanked all the gods that he had this amazing family that would be there for both of them.  Sam and Eileen stood to one side together and Mary had placed herself next to John’s chair.  Cain and Bobby were also seated around the table looking amused.
A few days after that meeting, Cas stepped out of his office to refresh his coffee when Sam stepped in line with him.  Cas glanced over and frowned at him.  He didn’t greet him and he was not in the mood to play twenty questions about Dean.  Sam had been trying to talk to him all week and Cas would not speak to him unless it was work related.  He reached the coffee and began to pour his new cup before Sam started talking.
Dean swallowed several times before he could find his voice.  “Oh, uh, early.  Early.  We said our goodbyes this morning.”  Dean hung his head and crossed his arms over his shoulders.  As he deflated Sam sat bold upright and whipped his head around to face Dean.
They heard the back door slam just then and Jimmy appeared a moment later.  Dean hopped up to grab him a plate and he fixed it while Jimmy washed his hands.
The alpha gathered him close and gently turned them onto their sides.  The dominant, dirty talking alpha from a few minutes ago was replaced with an intense alpha who was gentle and attentive.
Lighthearted cooing came from the other side of the table and Dean realized that everyone was watching and observing them interact.  Suddenly he was anxious about what they were seeing while he looked at his mate.
“Cas, I get it, it’s fine.  Dean slept in your bed last night, it’s not like it’s a big deal.”  Jimmy shrugged at him and walked out of the barn and up the slight incline to the house.  Cas stood there, dumfounded for a moment before he took off after him.
“I mean, the alphas are calm.  You said that you didn’t have the omegas to offer release and comfort for the alphas.  What do they do?  How can they control their tempers?  It’s imperative that the alphas be in control with clear minds in order to protect the pack and make it strong.  Without that they are weak.  Weak alphas cannot take care of a pack properly or run it well.”
Cas eventually pulled back and bid him good night.  Dean smiled the whole time he got ready for bed and drifted off quickly.
He stopped at the sight that greeted him.  His omega was curled up, fast asleep on the couch.  He had burrowed under the blanket and he looked so peaceful laying there that Cas smiled.  He made his way over to Dean and the omega stirred.
Something twisted in his chest and he gasped.  He opened his eyes and shook his head of the image.  He needed to stop those thoughts right away.  There was no future like that for him anywhere that he could see, even if he did want it, so he would tuck that firmly into the back of his mind and forget about it.
They had woken up earlier than usual and gotten started.  Dean wasn’t feeling as tired as he thought he would be, but it was probably the adrenaline rushing through him.  He had gotten downstairs with Cas just as Luke and Jimmy had.  Cas took Luke with him to do the morning chores and Jimmy went outside to take care of the chickens while Dean gathered things for breakfast.  Jimmy would be back in to help him if he needed it.
“Dean is my mate and will be treated as such.  Now, we need the clean room and food that I requested.”  Dean was grateful for the alpha taking control.  He hated to say it, but Hael had shaken him a little bit.  He was already unsure about what would happen and her words made him feel hollow with fear.
He played with his phone for another minute as he thought about the call.  What would he say?  How would Sam react?  After talking to Jess he was pretty sure that his brother wanted to talk so he could apologize to Dean, but he was still not sure how it would go.
Dean laid his head back on the couch listening to his brother.  When had he gotten so smart?  “What did you get so smart, Sammy?”
“Are you alright?” Cas asked as he picked his head up and searched Dean’s face.  “Did I hurt you?” he asked anxiously.
“Me.”  It wasn’t a question.  Dean knew this would happen eventually.  He had worked in a high-class lounge where wealthy alphas were frequently seen.  Dean couldn’t name or identify every alpha that had knotted him in the years he worked for Roman, but they would maybe recognize him.
Becky teased him about it at school but Dean knew she was happy for him.  Sam stuck his moose nose into the subject every time Dean talked to him and Charlie was just about to vibrate out of her skin at finally getting some information on the alpha.
Dean bit his lip and nodded.  Cas squeezed his hand once more before he let go so he could continue eating.  Dean mirrored his movements and they were silent for a few minutes before Dean spoke softly.
“Tessa will be glad to check you over and besides, there is nothing more important to me than your health and comfort.”  Dean stroked his cheek with affection and they shared a small smile.  “Do you want more?” Dean asked.
Cas nodded his head and looked to the doctor.  He pulled Dean closer to his side as he spoke.  “I can smell it.  There’s a faint hint of sweetness there.”
Dean wiped his mouth with the napkin from his lap before he spoke.  “I did.  I made a few lists though, that I wanted to talk to you both about.  I inventoried the pantry and fridge and made a list of the things that are here.  Another is the grocery list and I have a menu for the week done.  I’d like to have you both look at it to make sure that I didn’t put something on there that you don’t like.  I made menus for this week and a rough outline for next week.  Is there a way I can get the ad for the grocery store we are going to so that I can plan around the sales?”
He could smell the guilt that leaked into Cas’ scent and he reached up to pet his chest where he lay his head.
Dean smiled in excitement and nodded.  He couldn’t wait to get to the doctor and see how things were with the pup.  Dean wasn’t worried, but he was anxious to see how things were going and to make sure the pup was growing well.
When Dean arrived on Thursday morning, he put a Tupperware dish on Bobby’s desk like he had done several times a week for a few weeks.  Dean found many recipes that were for four to six servings and he could never eat it all, even if he froze some of the portions for himself or halved the recipe, so he brought the extras to Bobby.
“I know, Dean,” Chuck told him, “but it sounds like you did.  You need to go find him because I’m sure he’s feeling sick right now and you need to fix it.  You’re the only one who can.”
Jimmy pushed his empty plate away and leaned back in his chair.  Dean glanced over to see that Cas’ plate was empty and his was almost done.  He had been surprised to find that he enjoyed sitting on Cas’ lap and having the alpha feed him.  He took another bite from Cas when he offered it and made to get up.  Cas stopped him once again.
, he thought.  He reached for her with his free hand.  She grabbed it and pulled it to her, wrapping it between her other hand.
“It’s had its ups and downs,” he told her truthfully.  “We have good and bad days.  It’s hard to build an instant life with someone you don’t know.  It takes time.”
“I just don’t know,” he continued.  “I thought that maybe things would work out this time.  And they have.  They will.  Cas gave me a home for as long as I want it.  Maybe I’ve gotten greedy.  I won’t have to leave when Jimmy mates Amelia, but it will be different.
As the meal was about to wrap up Dean saw Amelia put her hand on Jimmy’s and smile sweetly.  Dean nearly laughed because he knew what was coming.  Jimmy may have also because he tensed at the touch.
“What’s going on?” he asked her.  He knew he was right when her eyes widened a bit before she could school her expression.  “Charlie.  Why are wearing scent blockers?”
When they got back to the house Cas unhooked the tree right at the back door and scooted Dean inside before he went to unsaddle the horse.  Dean tried to protest but Cas was adamant that Dean get inside the warm house.  Dean reluctantly headed inside and took off his things.  He frowned at the thought that not only was Cas outside in the cold, but so were the other alphas.
Cas hated Gordon Walker but he was good at his job.  He was a beta with an alpha complex which made him volatile, but he was out to prove something to every alpha that hired him, so Cas knew he wouldn’t rest until Dean’s attackers were in his grasp.  He had given him a healthy advance to aid in the search and he expected results quickly.  Two weeks had gone by and there was nothing.
“Then I would have given up the Alpha!” he roared.  “You knew this was more than a contract,” he continued.  He had lowered his voice but he couldn’t completely erase the growl.  “Dean is my mate, Mother.  I love him.  It doesn’t matter what happened to him and it doesn’t change anything for me.  I want to mate him and marry him and now you have taken that away from me.  He is gone and I don’t know how to find him.  You have caused this and-“ Cas broke off as his anger turned to grief.  He took several breaths and glared at his mother.  “This is not something I can forgive.  I never thought you would put what you thought was best for the pack over me, but I should have realized.  That is my error that I’ll have to live with and I will regret not being there for Dean for the rest of my life.  I hope you’re happy with your decision because you will have to live with the fact that there will be no heirs from me without Dean.  You destroyed any chance of a Pack Omega while I am Alpha.”
“I didn’t think being mated would be much different than courting, but I was wrong,” Jimmy continued.  Cas didn’t respond.  He continued to move and work as Jimmy chattered on.  “I didn’t realize our bond would shift again.  It’s easier to read her scent now.  And I can tell the shifts in her mood better.  It’s nice, Cas.  My alpha was settled when we began courting and we scent bonded, but after the bite…it was better.  I almost can’t describe it.”
Lilith looked at him as if he was and idiot.  “Yes, of course.  Do you not have one for your alpha?”  Cas shook his head silently.  “Oh.  Well, the bench held the omega to present to be ready for an alpha at any time.  The Pack Alpha would use the omega as needed, but any other alpha that came to the house could have free use too.  It was an honor to be considered the best omega,” Lilith told him proudly.
“There are around a hundred omegas and pups,” Dean continues.  He can see the angry glint in both of the older alpha’s eyes.  “Most are pups who are young, which means the alphas bred them frequently.  There are a few betas, but it seems the pack pushed them out more than not and the ones left seem aggressive, like Gordon.  Jody also says that there are a fair number of orphans.
“It’s not breaking the bond with Jimmy, Cas,” he told him softly.  He felt Cas’ hand still in surprise.
“I promised him he would have a home here.  What if he doesn’t feel the same and he feels like he can’t stay here?  I can’t drive him away.  You remember what it was like when he constantly thought we were going to send him away.  And not too long ago he was convinced that Amelia was going to take his place.  He’s still so insecure about himself and having a place to call home.”
He hadn’t thought through what it might mean to Dean and how he would take the command.  Cas had only realized later that by trying to protect them, he had helped the downward spiral his mate was on.  Thinking about the day when Dean was so excited about the spa made his stomach turn.
Dean looked over at him and Cas placed a gentle kiss on his forehead before nuzzling his hair.  Dean sighed and leaned in to him letting his scent tell his alpha how happy he was.
“I wanted to see the omega,” Cas told her.  “I think she could use a friend and I thought I’d come down and see if she wanted some company.”
When he had thought about this idea, he wasn’t sure about it.  He was intrigued and to be honest,  he had always wanted to have a few pairs of panties for special occasions.  They were expensive though, and Dean didn’t feel like he could justify the expense with Emma to feed and no mate to show them off too.  Dean knew he could get them just for himself, but the idea had first come about when Cas mentioned something off handed and it just didn’t feel right without knowing Cas would be the one to see them.
Dean thought again to the second time Cas thought Dean was rejecting him.  He would have let him go to make a good alliance with another pack, but it took a lot for Dean to get Cas back into a good headspace and he didn’t want to repeat that.
He tried to sit up but a lightning bolt of pain shot through his head while heat pooled in his groin.  He did moan out loud when he felt those things.  He knew those signs.  He was heading into a rut.  He was so far gone already that he was slightly humping the sheets even as he lay on his back.
Benny clapped him on the back and laughed as they walked together down the hallway towards the private chambers of his parents.  Dean glared at him, which only made his friend laugh harder.
Dean’s eyes widened slightly but he nodded.  He gave her the brief version and she wrote some things down.  She asked him a few questions as they went and nodded when he finished.
He got a slightly sour scent emanating from Cas at the comment and he squeezed his knee in acknowledgement.  Cas kissed him on the cheek in reassurance and they continued with the celebrations.
And did they really have anything in common, or was the drinking going to be it?  Would their friendship constantly be hanging in the balance because Charlie continued to be the wild partygoer and Dean was ready to settle down?
The answer was yes.  He would stay until Cas asked him to leave.  Any part of the alpha he could have was better than none, even if it was only just a part.
Dean dragged himself into the local coffee shop on campus for a caffeine fix during his break between classes.  By the middle of September his classes were in full swing and he was still adjusting to his new schedule.  He was taking a full load this semester and he could feel it.  He was in good company if the line of students in front of him was any indication.  He adjusted his backpack slightly and reached for his wallet as he approached the front of the line.
“Good morning, my omega,” Dean replied.  Cas turned in his embrace and pressed their lips together.  “How long have you been awake?”
Cas tucked his arm through his own and they made their way up the red carpet.  There were several press corps there and Cas talked to all of them.  Dean was unaware that Novak Networks was apparently the one giving the benefit, so everyone wanted to talk with Cas.  It also now made sense to Dean why Cas had asked him to this function and not the others.  Dean kept his mouth shut unless he was directly asked a question and even then, he kept his answer as short as possible without seeming rude.
Cas sighed and rubbed his hand over his face.  “Yes, the library.”  He looked back at Dean.  “I requested a neutral place because of the situation.  I have asked my aunt, who is also a company lawyer who specializes in prosecution, to help us with this.  She will be representing you. Amara is amazing, but very intense.  The lawyer representing the alpha is, to put it mildly, an asshole, and I don’t want him anywhere near you.  Unfortunately, that will be necessary,” Cas continued, still stroking Dean’s hand.  “I don’t want to go to the office, for various reasons, I don’t want to go to
Dean nodded again as Cas gently wiped the lingering tears from his face.  “I feel like that too, Cas,” he said softly.  “I don’t want a contract with you anymore, I just want you, too.”
“I can just figure it out, Jimmy.  I know you guys have a lot of things to do, so don’t waste your time,” he told them shakily, as a knot formed in his gut.  He started to quickly gather his notes in a pile when Cas’ large hand covered his and stopped them.
“I’d love to, Cas.  I just need to text my brother and let him know what I’m doing.”  Cas nodded and Dean pulled up Sam’s contact information.  At sixteen, Sam had just presented as an alpha and he was more protective than ever over Dean, even though he was four years older.
Cas had matured during the last three years.  While it was to be expected, Dean had been completely caught off guard when he saw him upon his return.  He was so swept up in his excitement and wonder that he had made a scene in front of the entire pack.  He felt himself blush at the memory of that day.
Cas smiled sheepishly at him and backed away a step.  He ran his hand down over Dean’s arm and laced his hand through his before gently pulling him in for a chaste kiss.
“He shot the alpha in the leg.  It was pretty bad ass,” Dean told him.  Cas could see he was trying to fight the medicine to talk to him.
“Hey Cas.  I miss you.”  He leaned back in the chair and looked up into the bright blue sky.  There were gorgeous white puffy clouds moving lazily through his view through the pergola.
“Ok, pizza’s ordered and should be-what is going on?”  She stopped in front of them when she saw their faces.  Charlie’s was calculating and Dean’s was terrified and the lingering scent of sadness and longing was hanging in the air.
Ok friends, this is where we earn some of those tags.  If you are triggered, you want to skip this chapter.  I'll put a short summary at the end.  Please read the tags.
“We won’t kick you out, Dean,” Cas told him firmly.  “We wouldn’t do that no matter what, but you don’t have to worry.  You’re doing everything we could ask for and more.  You’re place is secure here.”
“K!  Be there in ten!” she squealed and hung up.  Dean shook his head at the endless energy his friend had before he hauled himself up and into the shower again.
Cas nodded.  “Yes,” he said.  “I would love to have Thanksgiving together.  Here.  Let’s talk to Mom.  I’m sure she’d be fine with it.”
“I shouldn’t have left him,” Dean growled.  “Why didn’t you tell me this might happen?”  Cas whimpered again at his voice and Dean shifted, cradling him more.
“What’s wrong?” he asked as he breathlessly stopped in front of Cas.  He took in the rigid posture and clenched jaw and knew something had happened.
“Sam,” John spoke, serious now.  “The Mullens need a response.  What do you think, really, of the idea of mating with Eileen?”
He had grieved for so long in the absence of a home and a family.  Being back in an actual house with alphas, he realized that the institute was not a home at all.  He had done his best to make himself a space that was both comfortable and safe, but had forgotten what it was like to be able to have an actual home that smelled like the people you loved and cared for.  He wasn’t in love with either alpha, but he did care for them and they cared for him.  Their physical connections helped to tie Dean to them in a way he hadn’t had in a long time.  The scent bonds, especially with Cas, furthered the feelings of safety and calm.
Cas shuddered again as Dean began to thrust his finger in and out in time with his movement on his dick.  Dean added another finger and began stretching him, preparing him to take his thick alpha cock.  Cas wouldn’t need to be stretched like this in the future, and probably didn’t need it now, but he appreciated the fact that Dean was serious when he said he wanted this to be good for Cas and he would take care of him.
Dean looked at him.  Cas stared back at him and waited.  Dean nodded and took a breath.  “Yea, Cas, that sounds good.”
“Have you, in the last eight months, actually sat down with your brother and talked to him?  Really talked when you saw him?  Listened to him when he told you what was going on in his life?  Because if you had, you’d know all the things I know.  And it’s different from what you think.  You are selfish and arrogant and if I had any question about those traits you have proven it over to me tenfold.”
It pleased him that he would have his own money.  Dean had never had the opportunity to make his own way before and he was now.  He had settled into the life at the ranch easily, like he was meant to be there.  He looked at the alphas in the front of the truck.  They were talking quietly together now and Dean was content to daydream and think.
Cas turned his neck and Dean lifted his head off of his shoulder.  Their lips met in a sweet kiss and Dean sagged a little when Cas’ hand came up to cradle his jaw.  Cas pressed their lips together and moved Dean’s head to an angle so he could control the kiss further.  Dean let Cas kiss him the way he wanted.  Cas was an excellent kisser and Dean was happy to let him lead every time.
Dean stuttered when he got a good look at Cas.  He had been holding back while he was in his parent’s house, but now that they were officially courting he didn’t need to.  He let his eyes shimmer gold and arousal bleed into his scent.
Once they were finished, the alphas cleaned up all the paper and put the den back together.  Dean had thought ahead and purchased an extra-large gift bag for Victor so he could compile his gifts into one place and easily carry them home.
“Told him to take only his own things and leave without telling anyone.  I didn’t want any drama,” he said as he rolled his eyes. “He left the phone, the car and anything that didn’t belong to him. Told him he had to be off of pack lands.”  John looked at the clock on the inside of the house.  “About an hour ago.  He should be gone.”
Emma frowned slightly and tipped her head to the side looking at him in confusion.  Gabe burst out laughing and turned to his father.  “Did you see that?”
Cas had been barely holding his alpha in check since last night and hearing that his mate was gone and his mother had voided the contract for their marriage pushed him right over the edge.  The red flared in his eyes and he had the other alpha backed up against the wall by his throat in seconds.
Cas didn’t nip his neck or lick his mating gland like he could have if they were still engaged or already mated, but he did press gentle kisses along his neck and jaw while he petted Dean’s stomach.  Dean felt Sam’s eyes on them but he didn’t look at his brother.
“I feel worse that I did when I fell asleep.  Why is that?  Is it normal?” Cas asked, answering her question.
“Ellen, I had a mom, I don’t need you to be one too,” he told her.  His voice was steady and his posture was normal, but up-close Cas and Ellen could see how his movements were sluggish and his eyes were glazing over.
Dean shook his head.  “No.  I can’t, Ellen.  I can’t,” he told her.  His voice cracked and he was afraid he would start crying again.
“Yes, Alpha Novak.  Omega Novak is doing very well and the best place for him to continue to heal is at home with you.”  She looked at both Dean and Cas.  “It’s going to take some time for Omega Novak to fully recover, but it’s best to be in familiar surroundings instead of a hospital.”
“Shhh, Dean, it’s alright.  I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make you think you’ll be knotted all night.”  He pressed a kiss to his neck and Dean arched into the touch.  “Jimmy will want to knot you several times I’m sure.  Probably more than twice since he’s been downstairs while I’ve fucked you senseless and he’s heard us.  He’s probably going to be dying a little while you eat,” he said smugly.  “It’s important that you bond with us both at the same time so we create an equal dynamic, but, I promise you, Dean, you’ll always get to sleep and eat. If we have a long night then we won’t expect you up at the crack of dawn.”
That must have been a good answer because Cas nodded and released him.  Jimmy beamed at him and took him by the hand, breaking the eye contact that he had continued to hold with Cas.  He pulled Dean further into the house and down the hallway.  He started talking excitedly to Dean and he couldn’t help noticing that Jimmy’s touch didn’t elicit the same electricity that Cas’ had, but it did feel comforting and safe.
“Because I’m the alpha!” he roared.  He pushed away from the stall and paced up and down a few feet of the isle.  He ran a frustrated hand through his hair as he continued.  “I’m in charge, Jimmy.  It doesn’t matter what that contract says, and you know it.  There are two signatures on it and one of them is an alpha’s and one is an omega’s.  If I took it to court they would void it without a fight.”
Dean swallowed and nodded.  “I’m sorry, alpha, I tried,” he told Cas.  He looked dejected again.  His scent was muted and Cas couldn’t really get a read on it with the breeze in the air.  “They wouldn’t let me in and I didn’t know what to do.  I couldn’t contact you.  I didn’t know how even if I had a phone, which I don’t.”
He had been reluctant at first at the thought of wearing maternity clothes.  When he expressed this to Charlie and Kevin, Charlie gave him a funny look.
He made his way into the garden gate and had just pulled the first weed up when he heard his name being called.  Cas turned to see Lilith at the gate waving with a small smile on her face.
Dean was surprised when Cas put on pajamas but Dean followed his lead.  They were quiet while they changed and did their routine.  He could smell that Cas was concerned and it made Dean smile to know that the alpha cared about him.  Cas exited the bathroom first and Dean followed a minute later.  He paused slightly as he crossed the threshold into the room.
“Dean, this is perfect,” Cas told him standing in front of the store.  “I didn’t know something like this existed.”  Dean grinned as he followed Cas into the candy store.
There had been a few times over the course of the month that he thought Cas was going to kiss him again and he had waited with baited breath.  Each time, though, Cas had pulled back or kissed him somewhere else.  Dean was fine.  They had an agreement and he knew that Cas wanted to save kissing for his mate.
Bobby hollered a greeting to Dean as he sat on the rug with Emma and her Barbies.  Ellen chuckled as she entered the kitchen with a grocery bag, kissing him on the cheek.
Dean smiled.  “Yea, I like cars.  I like the idea of a machine you can take apart and put back together better, faster, more efficient.”  He shrugged.  “I guess you can do that with a lot of things, but there’s something about cars I like.  They have personality, especially the old ones.  The classics are my favorite.  If I wasn’t interested in marketing, I’d restore classic cars maybe.   My dad wouldn’t be too happy about that, but whatever.”
Ellen returned then with Cas’ Coke and sets it gently in front of him.  She leans over and gives Dean a kiss on his head.
Today, he was on his own and the silence in the house was strange.  Dean walked to the couch and lay down.  He had spent several nice nights with Cas here, watching a movie or the news.  Dean liked that he could lay on it and be comfortable because it was so long.  He stretched out and turned on the television.  He watched a few shows and flipped through the hundreds of channels that Cas had.
Cas nodded and looked to Dean, who smiled back before they continued into the building.  Dean stiffened again when they moved past the concierge desk and Cas looked over sharply.
Dean felt a sob bubble up into his chest and Cas pulled him in close under his chin and let Dean cry for a moment.  He groomed Dean’s hair and ran soft fingers down over his neck and mating mark as he held Dean.  The worry about Cas leaving him and taking the pup had calmed with the alpha’s declaration and the stress and tension he had carried around with him for months dissipated.
Balthazar gave a quick report and they continued to move.  It seemed that Gordon had run along this path for some distance.  Dean knew this was the right direction to take them to Morningstar.  He hoped that he was right and that they had not miscalculated.  Cas was depending on him.
The alpha was in bed already and he pulled the blankets down as an invitation for Dean to join him.  He climbed into bed and Cas manhandled him onto his side so he could spoon up behind him.  Dean sighed and relaxed when Cas carded his fingers through Dean’s hair and nuzzled his neck.  He let Cas groom him and mark him for a few minutes, enjoying being cared for.  He didn’t let the alpha get too carried away because he wanted to reassure Cas that he was good.  Dean smiled and lengthened his neck for Cas to scent.
Dean nodded silently and tried to let go of his irritation and worry.  He grunted in acknowledgement and Cas pressed up against his back and wrapped his arms around his waist.  Dean’s hand moved automatically and he pressed his own forearm against Cas’ and grasped it as he leaned back.
Dean was torn between the silliness of Jimmy and the fear that he had gone too far in his request.  Cas smiled at him.
“Son, listen,” Bobby said putting a hand on Dean’s shoulder.  Dean looked over at him.  “Whatever you decide to do or not do about Cas is your choice and no one will judge you for whatever you decide.  That includes telling him everything or telling him nothing and anything in between.  But I have to tell you, Dean.  What you’re doing now is not working.  I can smell how much it’s affecting you.  Hell, he sent you into a heat just by being near you for ten minutes.  I know you think that being with him in any way is better than being without him, but I’m not so sure that’s the best thing for you and your pup.”
They sat there for a moment in silence.  Cas wasn’t sure what to say.  He couldn’t lie and tell Dean he was happy because he wasn’t and it was obvious in his looks and scent.
“Move, Dean,” Cas demanded.  Dean pulled his head up and looked at Cas.  “I’m fine, please move,” he told him.  Dean seemed satisfied and pulled out a bit before pushing back in.  Cas’ eyes rolled into the back of his head and he became lost in the haze of feelings his alpha created as he slowly increased his strokes.
“I’m here, sweetheart,” Cas told him.  Dean tried to reach out for him and Cas must have understood his movements because he carded his hands through Dean’s hair.  “You’re safe now,” he told him.
He looked so innocent and fresh.  Cas couldn’t wait until he got his hands on him, but overall, he was glad that Dean would be there in general.  He knew that in addition to the relief he would provide his body, Dean would help with the chores and the house and be a genuine companion.
“Yea, Cas, I want that too,” Dean told him.  He was tired of fighting this.  He thought he was doing the right thing at the end of high school, and maybe he did then, but this is the right thing to do now.
Dean looked down to see Emma holding on to both of their legs.  “Daddy, are you going to marry Papa?” she asked Dean.
Cas smiled at him and Dean felt a familiar warmth spread through him that had nothing to do with his drink.  It took Cas a minute to respond to him though.  Dean could see several thoughts flow through his mind before he spoke.
“Is your stomach bothering you?” Cas asked.  Dean looked over, pulled out of his thoughts.  The concern emanating from his alpha made him smile.
“My mom is in a coma in the hospital.  It’s one of the reasons I stayed here.  I need to be close to her.”  Sorrow and confusion shifted through her scent.  She blinked hard a few times, the visibly shook herself.  “Well, on that cheery note, I think we should sleep.  You guys can crash here with me, though it’s only about 10 feet to your room.”
When he was ready he pried Emma away from the TV and buckled her into her car seat.  They headed to the store to get what they needed.  Emma happily sat in the basket with her Barbie doll and asked questions as they went through the store.  Dean patiently answered every one, steering clear of any alphas that he smelled.  Dean wasn’t wearing his blockers, and while he wasn’t scared, he wasn’t going to try and take any chances.
She looked back at him so earnestly and he loved that she wanted so much for him and Cas.  Amelia had been an unexpected ally and friend.  He was happy that she had everything she wanted.  He could see her mating bite clearly on her neck above her t-shirt collar and though she wasn’t showing yet, her sweet pregnancy scent was already strongly woven into her normal lilac and vanilla.  Their house was almost finished and they would move in a few weeks.
He gently pulled the stack of photos from the corner of the box and began to slowly go through them.  There were pictures of the two of them when they were pups still and as they grew older.  There was a sweet one of Dean holding mistletoe above Cas’ head and giving him a kiss on the mouth.  There was another one from Prom their senior year.  One taken at the lake the last summer they were together.  There was another one with Cas and Sam and one with Cas in the front seat of the impala.  Dean had loved this one a lot.  Cas looked so happy and relaxed.  He had his aviator glasses on, and his window was down, messing up his wavy hair as it blew in.  He was wearing a black t-shirt and had his arm slung over the back of the seat.  He was giving Dean a bright smile that crinkled his eyes and showed his gums.  It was the perfect picture.  Dean traced Cas’ smile and gently put it back in the box.
The food began to be served and Dean was relieved.  Food meant that there wouldn’t be as much talking and he couldn’t mess things up with Cas.  Charlie kept glancing at him during the salad course and he tried to reassure her with a smile but Dean knew she wasn’t buying it.
“Yes, Dean.  It applies now and next week and next year and for as long as you’re with us.”  Cas pulled him close and Dean scented him.  He relaxed and nodded.
Cas felt warm at Dean’s praise.  “Thank you.  It’s new,” Cas told him, glancing up again.  Cas caught the mischief in Dean’s green eyes before he spoke.
Cas shook his head.  He couldn’t think of his company or anything at the moment.  For all he had continued to put Dean second, or third or last in a lot of cases, suddenly, he was the most important thing in Cas’ life.  His mate and pup, and he might lose them now because he was too stubborn and selfish to recognize what he had in front of him.
Cas squeezed his shoulder and helped him into the truck. They spent the ride together chatting about the new alphas and how things were going so far.  It had only been a few days but it seemed like they were settling in and both Jimmy and Cas were pleased.
Cas nodded and she quickly hugged him tightly and left.  She shut the door behind her and Cas turned back to the bed where Dean was laying.
Dean nodded once, and opened the door.  As soon as his foot hit the asphalt Cas was there.  He held the door and took Dean’s hand.  He nuzzled him and scented him, wrapping his arms around Dean.
A moment later his alpha appeared on Cas’ side of the bed with a mug of something hot.  He looked up into his alpha’s kind eyes.
Dean was surprised when Bobby told him that he should move the bedroom furniture from his room at Bobby’s house into his apartment.  Bobby told him he didn’t need it if Dean wasn’t going to be staying there anymore and he would rather Dean continue to use it than it sit and gather dust.  Unexpectedly Dean found himself with a full bed with a decent mattress, a nightstand and a large dresser.  Dean scoured the online ads for other furniture.  He couldn’t afford to spend a lot of money on his apartment but he knew that he would need furniture to live.  Bobby convinced him to take the money John had left him and put it into the apartment.  Dean did and was able to get a living room set, a small TV and a dining room table with chairs.
“Like a whale.  How can I be just as big with one pup as I was with the twins?” he asked.  The summer had been brutal for him and now that they were moving into the end of September, he hoped things would start to cool off.
“Bitch, you literally just sat there and told me that you withheld information that was important because my omega brain can’t handle it.”  Dean was glaring at his brother.
They walked back around the house to find everyone else pretty much where they left them.  There were several of Dean’s friends and co-workers from work.  Cas’ family hadn’t been able to come but hopefully Balthazar would be by sometime.  Cas had also invited a few of his other friends to meet Dean and see his new house.
Lilith nodded, relaxing more deeply into the pillows behind her.  “Thank you for visiting me, Castiel,” she murmured.
Dean had wetted the cloth, intent on cleaning Cas up a bit, but now that he was thinking more clearly, the alpha haze receding, he realized that he just needed to get Cas out of here and home.  He swiped gently over his mate’s back and thighs, removing what spunk he could before flinging the rag to the floor.
Dean’s lips thinned into a line before he answered.  “That’s a story for another time.  Right now, dinner’s ready.”
Dean watched in horror as Hael’s face filled the screen and she began talking about him.   The nasty things she said about Dean made his face burn with shame, even though he knew they weren’t true.  When other omegas were interviewed and they said many of the same things Dean’s eyes filled with tears.  He wasn’t sure what was going on.
Dean was taken aback by some of the questions and how focused they were on him and not Cas.  He tried to be coherent and answer simply.  He let Cas take on most of the answers and they were able to make it inside after what felt like forever for Dean.
“If I wait, what happens?  What could happen?  Could I end up with the c-section anyway?”  Dean was gripping Ellen’s hand.
They had added a garage on the side of the kitchen with a mudroom and bonus room on top for a playroom.  Dean wasn’t sure what they were going to do with all the space.  They had gone from under one thousand square feet to over five thousand.
Dean hopped off the back and made his way to Victor.  Cas had made him promise not to go inside the fence no matter what.  He was glad that Victor was upright and not laying on the ground.  He really didn’t want to break his promise to Cas.
The alpha shook his head as he refocused on his phone.  “I don’t think I’ll be watching much anyway,” he told Dean.  “Choose what you want.”
Tessa’s hand rested on his leg, solid and warm, helping to ground him.  “It’s ok, Cas.  Those alphas didn’t have to rape you to cause damage to your body and your mind.  There is bruising on your buttocks.”
Meg indicated the attached bathroom.  “There are clean pants in there for you already.  Use the soaps in the shower that are also scent neutral.”  She paused to make sure he understood.
Dean helped Emma up onto the stool in the bathroom and gently helped her brush her teeth.  She rinsed her mouth and patted it dry before hopping down and heading back to her room.  She went straight to her shelf and pulled down her book.  She handed it to Cas and climbed into bed, gathering her blanket and lovey to her as she settled in for her story.
The warm feeling that had nothing to do with the beer grew in his chest.  “We’ll try and be better about it, Naomi,” Dean told her.
It was full dark by the time they pulled up to the house.  Sam sat beside him and Jody and a deputy were in the police cruiser behind them.  Cas saw a light on in the downstairs window and he texted Gordon to let him know they were there.
Dean nodded and glanced back out to the crowd of people.  “Last time I was trying to be quiet and not embarrass you too much,” Dean told him.  “I like this a lot better.”
Dean still stood across from his brother who was still seated.  He was hurt and angry now that they were really getting in to it.
There was a tense silence, and Dean was afraid for a moment that his brother wasn’t going to drop it, but eventually Sam’s shoulders sagged and his face looked resigned.
He kept the downstairs mostly open and Dean put every bit of extra money and luxury into the room his father used for Pack Alpha business that he could.  The room they used had its own entrance on the side porch, so anyone who came to the house entered through there.  Dean was glad that was the way things were done.  It had started that way to keep so many Weres and scents from being in the family part of the manor but it had become a necessity to hide the way the manor was in disrepair.
“I could go with you, you know.  Not an invalid, remember?”  Dean was only half joking.  He very well could make it to the store with the two of them, but he wasn’t really sure that being on his feet like that, with a crowd of shoppers the Saturday before Christmas was a good idea.
“Did you enjoy the movie, Dean?” Cas asked him.  His hands were buried in his trench coat pockets, holding it close to his body in the chilly air.
“What’s gotten into you, boy?” Bobby greeted when he entered the house.  “Thought you were just shopping?”
“Can you call Marguerite’s and double check the reservation for tonight?  I want to make sure that it’s private and quiet.”
“She heard about the issues with you and me and she just kept whispering in my ear about how people don’t change.  I don’t know what her endgame was there, but she kept telling me how you could easily be an embarrassment to me and how it would be so bad for me and my career if you screwed Cas over.  I mean, he’s going to make partner in a year, Dean.  His father is one of the founders of the firm.”
Sam didn’t answer for a long moment.  Dean heard him sigh explosively.  “Alright, Dean, at least I tried.  Just…just don’t lead him on, ok?  He’s one of the good ones left.”
Maybe he should have stayed at the castle.  He bit his lip, feeling the slight impression where yesterday there was a split.  He was stuck now.  Everyone would notice if he got up and left and he couldn’t do that.  Why had he wanted to come down here tonight?  Would the pack blame him for Garth’s death?  Cas blamed himself already, even if he wasn’t the one to actually kill the alpha.
He opened the first bag that was labeled with Jimmy’s name on it.  He had only communicated with this brother and he wanted to know what his scent was like.  He opened the bag and was assaulted with the rich scent of alpha.  It was fresh and clean, like the air after a hard spring rain.  He pushed his nose into the bag and took several deep breaths.
“I get the first knot,” he said casually as he lowered himself into one of the plush recliners.  Cas’ head shot up and he did growl at him.
Dean swallowed, not sure how to keep the conversation going.  He glanced over at Cas, who was sitting on the other side of the couch reading.  He must have bee silent too long because his mother spoke again.
Cas was bemused.  He smiled and shook his head in wonder at his two-year-old self.  His wolf had known then too, it seemed.  He turned back to his plate only to notice that Dean had put more food on it.  He lifted a brow at him but Dean just shrugged.
“I had a nice time tonight,” Dean murmured, still looking at Cas.  Though the wind was whipping their clothes and hair around Dean caught the faint scent of clean rain deepening with warm summer sun.  He blinked, thinking he was imagining the scent.  Cas’ scent always smelled more summer sun when he was happy, but that was how Cas had smelled when he and Dean were alone.  When they were in love and happy.
Dean had an opening to talk about Emma, but he suddenly couldn’t do it.  How was he going to text Cas this news?  ‘Oh, hey, thanks for the toys.  You know you bought them for your own pup, right?’  Somehow Dean just couldn’t see that happening
“Castiel Novak,” he began, his voice mirroring his father’s to carry to everyone.  “Your parents have consented to a mating, but I ask you now, before these witnesses if you will enter courtship with me to be my mate.”
Cas sighed in disappointment at himself.  “I don’t know, Dean,” he said honestly.  “Charlie was angry with me for the entire night and it hadn’t occurred to me until I saw her on the way back to you that I had told you to stay at the table and you wouldn’t leave.  At the time I just wanted to get away and I didn’t think about my words.  I’ll be more careful in the future.”
“Ready?” Luke asked.  Cas nodded and got behind the wheel of his vehicle.  He smiled at the memories of Dean learning how to drive the machine as he settled in.  Luke raised a brow but Cas just shook his head.
Suddenly, Dean pulled out and before he knew what was happening, Dean had flipped him on his back and was driving into him again.  Cas pulled his legs up to wrap around Dean’s waist and he could feel the energy in his mate.  Cas could also feel the knot beginning to swell as it popped in and out of his hole.  Cas held on, relishing the feeling of Dean’s knot and knowing that today he wouldn’t have to stop.  Dean would lock himself in Cas’ hole and bite his neck and they would be mated.
“I’m working out,” he replied moving to the mat.  He began to roll it up, his workout now over since Charlie seemed to be content to stay.
Dean pulled out the casserole he had made the day before and warmed it up.  He cut bread he bought at the store and threw a bagged salad on the counter.  Jimmy arched an eyebrow at him and Dean made a face.
“As my first decree as Pack Alpha, I reinstate Dean Winchester as an official omega of the Winchester pack and a member of the Pack Alpha family.  Castiel,” he said, indicating Cas where he stood, “searched for Dean for months.  Dean was found in May of last year and brought back to the Novak land where he has been hidden.”
The singing began a moment later and the old songs rose and fell around him as the pack joined in.  Dean made his way back to them when he finished with Garth’s family.  Everyone shuffled around to make room for him next to Cas and he reached for his alpha’s hand.  Dean grasped it tightly and Cas was sure it was as much for his mate’s sake as it was for his own.
“I’ve lost so much, Cas.  And I know I lost those things and I can come to grips with that but what I can’t do is adjust this vision in my head for you to share my heat without a ring on my finger and a bite on my neck.  I can’t stand the thought of those dreams turning into your pity to keep me alive.”
Dean nodded and they sat quietly for a few minutes.  He began to trace patterns on Cas’ skin on his chest and then lower to his belly and then finally under the water to where he could feel Cas’ member stirring.
The air between them changed and became thick.  They finished their meal in silence, keeping eye contact the whole way through.  When Cas put his plate down, Dean was there immediately, throwing things back into the basket before Cas could do anything.
“Take off your tunic and get in the bed with him, Alpha,” he heard Tessa command.  Cas hadn’t been aware the beta had entered the room.  The hands that had been holding him steady disappeared and he began whining again at the loss.
“I did everything I could for the pack!” John snarled.  “Everything!  It wasn’t easy and I didn’t have any help.  I couldn’t count on anyone and-“
“There’s food.  Let’s eat now. I think that we should get something in you sooner than later,” he told Cas as he sat up.  Cas smiled and threw on his shift before sitting down at the table where the food and drink had been placed.
