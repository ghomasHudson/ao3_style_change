“Why aren’t you in bed? Why are you dressed? And where is my drink?” John turned around and gave him a once-over. He grinned.
He pressed their bodies together and kept kissing his throat and pulse point now. Sherlock turned his head so he could reach the place behind his ear. He understood, of course, he did.
“Yes, get me one of the other DS’s, will you? Thanks, mate.” He looked tired and John once pressed his shoulder. He stood and rather quickly left the room. He went to see DCI Barnes asking for help for Lestrade and he sent one of the Sergeants over.
John slept dreamless through the night. Meaning he had no nightmares at all. This was rare and he was thankful. But why? Was it Sherlock’s presence by his side? Had he calmed him down?
Greg just shoved him into his bath and pointed towards the shower. Then he closed the door and built a fire inside his tiny fire-place. He also prepared tea and got some biscuits out. Then he waited for John who came out after quite a long shower clad in his bathrobe. He looked up at him when he entered his living room.
“Well, then you know what I like. But not now. Not with you.” John’s voice was rough when pictures of black and red bondage ropes appeared in his mind. Ropes that were bound around Sherlock’s limbs and immobilised him, forced him into motionlessness.
“Well, regarding the things that caused pain and I liked anyway, the answers are easy. The answer why Greg is angry at himself is more complicated. But I know him. I know of his past. And I am going to deduce something for you. But not now since he is coming back from his run and will soon join us.” Mycroft nodded.
Sherlock’s arms came up and around John’s broad shoulders. John moved and grabbed Sherlock. Suddenly Sherlock ended up on top of John and his eyes were wide open. His cock pressed against his skin and he had no idea what John wanted.
Soon John was able to smell the food cooking. He was preparing pasta and John expectantly closed his eyes. Sherlock had turned out to be a very good cook indeed. After his first attempts, John had to punish him severely. It had become better very soon. Now he could have worked for a several star restaurant. Perhaps John could work this fine skill into his rentals, too? He could make him cook for several doms. Naked. Serve them. First the food and then himself. He fantasied about and calculated the costs. Soon he decided it was such a nice idea. He would do it.
“And I will listen to you. I am sure you have favourite things you like to do or things you don’t want to be done to you, am I right?” Mycroft blushed and nodded.
John shed his clothes and climbed up. He knelt behind him and started to knead his behind eliciting sexual noises from deep inside.
“Let’s go home, Sherlock, please?” John said and Sherlock nodded clinging to the plastic box holding all the bags with evidence.
And he fucked him hard. He shoved him over the stones and his knees were bleeding, too. He came rather quickly and filled him up. He made no sound at all. He pulled out and Sherlock groaned. He trembled and his eyes were closed.
Sherlock dangled his boxers before John's eyes and saw them widen. He slowly stuffed them into his mouth and held them inside until he felt him relax. Only then he wound wide medical tape around his mouth covering his lower face from chin up to under his nose. For a few seconds, John closed his eyes and breathed steadily through his nose.
“I have never said the words because I never felt it. But now, after having analysed and listened to you, I believe I can. I love you, John. Very much.”
Greg thought he was going back to normal and actually Mycroft felt the same. They were lounging in bed one morning after Greg had made love to him. Now he was sweaty and looked very much debauched. So did Greg.
“I will look after Sherlock. I had to sedate him before you came over. He was all hysterical, thrashing, screaming, crying. I believe revealing the truth to me was opening the flood gates.” Greg was wondering how bad this truth could be.
Now she was hurrying away from her room, leaving the reporter to lie to the room instead of Molly herself. A certain clean labcoat caught air and floated behind her in a ghoulish manner as she stormed to the room with the runaways, begging that she wouldn't slip or fall in her heels. Bursting into the room, she hardly had time to process the scene in front of her before speaking. John was silently sitting in the same place he had before, tears streaming down his face again. Sherlock was perched in front of him, like an owl watching a mouse far below. Both Holmes and Hooper spoke at the same time.
"I'm coming, I'm coming! I need a door left after this, so please don't break it," he muttered sarcastically, undoing the latch on the door. Violently it was thrown open as a grey haired man crashed into him, pushing him against a wall.
Sherlock grimaced. He wasn't fond of the country or makeovers. Perhaps Molly's grin was because she knew all too well what he'd be made to look like. In the distance a crackling sound was to be heard, as small little fiery sparks flew through the sky on a gust of wind. A giant campfire was warming the area, giving a comforting glow in the rainy day. Molly gave a sad sigh, her grin gone. Sherlock, in a surprising act of compassion, lightly pat her shoulder. There was no time to mourn her second home, however; they had to trek on. So through the mud they went, avoiding the deathly grip of clawed trees.
He forced bright cherry petals away from the bud, plucking them away until the flower was bare. On the ground they wilted until nothing remained. Packs were now scarce and usually thin, however there was the occasional family of bure-blooded beasts that went back centuries. In any community these families stood out, for they were proud and bold. Their own separate flowers. Some talked of the time with a darkness in their tone and a glint in their eye, teeth turning sharp and a growl vibrating in their throat. Others talked of it with shame, either because they felt as though it shouldn't have gotten so bad, or because it shouldn't have happened. Tones varied with opinions. Most, however, agreed it was a good thing.
By the time Sherlock had wriggled his dressing gown off and onto the floor, John was already down to his boxer briefs and crawling onto the bed between his legs. Hands going numb and useless at the sight of him, Sherlock could only stare, flushed from cheek to chest.
So lost in the overload of sensation, he barely registered his building orgasm until it was nearly upon him. Startled, his vocalizations turned more desperate and rose in pitch, his thighs shaking. He had to pull his head away to let it fall back as he sucked in gulps of air. Instead of arching against John, he writhed, at least as much as he could without loosening his grips.
“Sherlock?” He asked and Sherlock twitched. The book fell down and he quickly sat up wiping over his mouth.
"I'm Watson," he said quite clearly, before stuttering and looking confused. "No. I'm John. John Watson,"
"Yeah I'm fine," he said with a small nod. "Just not too keen on the smell," he added after an uncertain pause. Molly understood, but something made her feel something else was at fault.
With innocent puppy eyes, he looked at him as if to ask what was funny. Cruel eyes smirked at him with an unspoken joke, like schoolchildren discriminating against that one child with cruel jokes behind their back. John gave an angered huff, ears flattening in humiliation. Ears flattening.
Had he cut himself? Not that he could feel it, anyway. When imagining how he looked, his lips were blue and his skin was pale; hypothermia busily chipping away at his being. Even if he had cut himself, however, it wouldn't be
"What did you see, again?" Sherlock broke him out of his daze with a sharp click of a pen and a stern emotionless voice.
A voice with no lisp, no growl, just pure human, coaxed him away from the depths of sleep. He grasped at the hand as best he could, feeling the muscles twitch in an unnatural way. John was coming back -
"Everything alright, Sherlock?" he asked, peering at the screen. Sherlock quickly made a move to cover it, frantically nodding his head.
By the time they were ready to board their train, appearances were drastically different. Sherlock definitely had a reason to be worried earlier; he was dressed as an old man. Dark curls had been turned grey, and his clean shaven face was adorned by a wiry beard. With the art of makeup, he had emphasised wrinkles, sunken eyes, and more mellow features. Steely blue eyes still had the unmistakeable spark of youth, however. He could put on a good wobbly croaky voice, and force his hands to shake as if years of use had worn away at nerves quite convincingly. At first glance, nothing was suspicious about him. John had been decorated to look far younger than he was - or at least, someone attempting to look young. Hair was dyed black, making him look quite pale. Instead of layers of button up shirts, he had a leather jacket on, as well as faded jeans. To add to his appearance, he was chewing gum. John had never been overly fond of gum, but this time the strong flavour and scent made him feel fairly nauseous. Not that he told anyone, of course. Molly would not be joining them, and so there was no need for her to get her own look.
Without realising, his eyes had closed. John was frantically trying to wake him up with cries of his name; why hadn't they shot at him yet? Claws were grazing at his skin, skimming the top layers. One last desperate sob was drawn out into a howl - or was that just his mind playing tricks on him?
Long before he should have, dragging heavy limbs that weren't his, he forced himself off the floor again. His mind screamed at himself not to, but he barrelled towards the wall. It creaked, complaining that it wasn't built to withstand this. The half wolf ignored this and forced it to comply, relentlessly hitting and hitting as more wolf clawed at his insides. Everything hurt; a blinding pain that he could never describe with words.
He caught Greg’s head between his thighs and pressed. Greg groaned but didn’t fight. He felt the ropes around his wrists and soon his hands were tied on his lower back. He was completely erect by now.
“Yes, we did. I will arrange an appointment with one of Miss Adler's male employees.” Sherlock nodded.
John started to clean and disinfect. He also started to collect the stuff he wanted to use on Sherlock. Then he showered and waited. But he also kept thinking about the stuff he had purchased. Finally, it dawned on him. He didn’t want to do this. He didn’t want to leave him unattended on a bondage chair, with a fat plug stuck in his arse as well as a pissing device inside his mouth. He didn’t want him to drink his own pee anymore.
“I do believe you, Dr Watson.” Mycroft smiled a rare and honest smile and slowly stood. John thought this was the end of their meeting but Mycroft gestured for him to stay put. He walked over to his bar and poured a drink. He handed over a tumbler with the finest whiskey.
Mycroft poured them drinks while the DVD waited to be shown. They looked at each other and Greg swallowed.
He had also gone shopping with his brother for new furniture. The kitchen held a real kitchen-table he had promised not to use as a lab. His lab was upstairs in the second bedroom.
“Hands!” Sherlock's forehead kept touching the hardwood when he reached behind. John cuffed his wrists to the wooden implement.
John carried him over into his bedroom and carefully dropped him on his bed. He grunted and mumbled something unintelligible but didn’t wake.
They were followed by both a stable boy and Rogers who would follow them. Soon enough three horses were ready and Mycroft got up extremely elegantly. Greg adored him. He looked great. He also didn’t use a saddle since he had no boots. Greg had borrowed a pair and so had Rogers but Mycroft would never put on a pair of boots that had been worn by several persons before.
Mycroft relaxed and was very pleased with himself. He had promised to talk to Gregory but he hadn't said when.
“One day I came home from work and she stood in the hall with several suitcases and boxes. The collar from around her neck was on a wardrobe. She looked at me and just shook her head. I knew what it meant. Suddenly I understood but it was too late. And I let her go.” Another tear fell and now Sherlock reached out for his hand on the table. His large hand covered Greg's and it was warm and good.
He lowered himself down and kissed him. Sherlock groaned and opened his mouth. John could taste himself on Sherlock’s tongue and groaned, too.
“I have been looking at you from afar for a very long time. I have been watching you over CCTV. I have been taking care of you without you ever knowing. I finally dared to step up and did it all wrong. But I want you, Gregory. I want to be close to you, intimate with you. We don’t even need fancy gadgets.” He looked up and shook his head slowly.
Sherlock stepped outside and into the kitchen. John hadn’t heard him. He was busy stirring and swinging his hips to the music. Sherlock sneaked up and slung his arms around his waist. He placed his chin on his broad shoulder.
“Very good, Sherlock. Do not read them anywhere else than your room or in here. Do not show this to Gregory.” Sherlock picked up the pile of paper.
“Mr Merchande told me how he got to know you, Sherlock. I don't know what to say. I only want to help you. And I am not alone.” Greg said. Sherlock tilted his head.
And he dove into the work to have something to do, to be busy. He didn't want to think about his dom. John. His owner. His tormentor. His lover?
After waking up again John became very busy and didn't want to be disturbed. Sherlock didn't know what to do. He was still hungry but didn't dare to go into the kitchen by himself, without being allowed to. He sat in his room and waited for something to happen when John entered.
“Take him into my car. Now. You two, go and arrest Dr John Watson. Take him into custody. You know where.”
Greg could just stare at Mycroft. He had expected a lot but not this. He was shell-shocked and needed a moment to react.
“I am his mate. I feel somehow responsible.” He grinned and so did Greg. Sherlock stood and walked into the kitchen. Then he really made tea. Greg was surprised.
“Perhaps you could call him again and tell him about what we talked about?” Sherlock carefully said.
He ordered everything he thought was needed and threw a note on the counter. He thought of thanking them and dashed back upstairs carrying two paper bags with food.
“Well, shouldn’t we have a look upstairs?” He was giving Sherlock the opportunity to take over. Someone must have briefed him very thoroughly.
John shook his head and smiled. He opened the boxes and found sausages, scrambled eggs, and beans. There was toast and some tomatoes and cucumbers. Had Sherlock done all this? For him?
John almost shot up. This feeling he remembered from when he had been Ian's submissive. He had started to give him pleasure after some time as a reward for good behaviour.
Sherlock had asked for severe bondage. This was severe bondage. Perhaps though, John still could do more. He thought about it for a while.
“Let go again.” John shivered and moaned. He couldn't right now. He couldn't. Sherlock pressed on his bladder again and he screamed. Alternately, he pressed on his prick and his bladder and when he felt John being close, he closed his nostrils.
“So far I am rather pleased. You will need to eat more and perhaps your brother will let you into his precious gym. You need to build up muscles. I don't want to see any of your ribs in a few weeks’ time.”
“Yes, absolutely. He probably will still be angry and shout abuse at you. Just listen to him, tell him sorry and promise you will do better in the future.” Sherlock lit a second cigarette.
“I rented you. I hurt you. I fucked you raw. Then I bought you because you were useful. Your skills are extraordinaire. I understand you are more useful when you are not scared to death. I still want to play with you. You are just perfect for me.”
“Aha. I see. Interesting.” He murmured. Sherlock didn’t go away. “Is there something wrong?” John asked looking at Sherlock chewing on his lips.
“Denied, slut. Just get up and quickly move into the playroom. Now!” He spoke dangerously low and Sherlock quickly obeyed.
John swayed up the seventeen stairs and disappeared into 221B after his dinner with Mrs Hudson. He went through a very short bathroom routine and fell into bed. He slept deeply and only woke the next morning when his mobile rang. He had set the alarm to get up early and pick up Sherlock.
“I just do as I please...” John finally said. Sherlock slowly nodded. Several minutes passed by until Sherlock looked at him again.
“Once no and then half a yes. But we will talk about it again after we have found your brother.” Mycroft nodded.
“There! Yes! Again! John! Yes!” Sherlock suddenly yelled and John understood he had found his prostate. He repeated the moves and Sherlock started to yell the house down.
Sherlock listened and heard John laugh. Then the woman laughed, too. Sherlock’s lips were pressed together and only for a second, he thought about just leaving again.
“What happened wasn't your fault and he knows that. I talked to him on the phone when we were driving here and he was very moved. He will be extremely happy to see you again.” Greg assured him.
But now he cast a last look at him devouring the full English before he went through his morning routine. He had slept for maybe an hour, not more. But he was used to sleepless nights. Instead he had prepared a case file for Gregory showing all the things needed for court. He had managed to get a judge on the phone, several members of the High Court personnel as well as his own office. Everything was settled.
The next day John slept in. He woke to Sherlock's typing by his side. He also muttered quietly. John turned on his side and leant on his elbow.
John saw him relax and smiled. It had taken a while but it had worked. Now he would dish out his reward. He switched on the penis-plug and chose a lower setting.
“Why are you dressed like a soldier?” He asked and only then saw the bloodstains on the carabineers and even some on John's neck and ears and in his hair. He reached out for him and his long finger moved over the side of his head.
“No, I am cancelling. I don’t want you to go alone on a case. If you find some clues, I know that you will be running after suspects and would be all by yourself. I don’t like that. Give me a second, will you?” John said getting his mobile out of his pocket.
“The slut has woken up. Just look at him!” The man pulled his head back and forced it under the water. It was a cruel move and it always felt like drowning. But he didn't fight him. He had to behave.
John made him stand and pulled him back into the living room. He told him to kneel by his side and sat in the armchair again. Sherlock wanted to sit on his heels but John smacked his cock.
Bones were cracking and re-forming, but so slowly he could feel every single movement; the grind as they moved to new placements. With pleading dark eyes he looked up at the unfamiliar face with eyes that didn't fit.
It seemed that rumours had already spread far and wide. Reporters told their own theories and shouted for their cameramen to come closer. And that was when the famous Sherlock Holmes snapped and shut the door. Outside, the crowds continued to scream.
John's stomach growled for the third time in the span of a minute. Sherlock groaned and threw his head back dramatically, clutching at his hair with white knuckles. John found his cheeks becoming red, eyes averting their gaze to the ground as he awkwardly held at his side. "Do you really need food
John snapped at the word 'pup'. He felt his bones shift uneasily, a faint cracking noise at the bottom of his neck making him arch his spine. Colours became frightfully vivid and noises surrounded him, but he focused on whoever these people were ahead. They watched curiously, the heels of their feet rising as they prepared to step back. The one that had snarled at him openly whimpered, crouching to seem smaller. John was now the one snarling, clutching at Sherlock as though he were his life's savings. However when his display was over he felt
Sherlock asked where he lived, who his wife was, what had killed her... and so on. John mumbled his way through the questions, too tired to currently be grieving. Adrenaline had slowly faded, only to leave his body an aching mess of bruises and wounds. Possibly even broken bones in some places. He was a doctor, after all.
"Yep!" she swerved around a corner, leaving John to have his head smashed against the window. "He didn't tell just in case we weren't over each other. I'm over you, at least. Got a lady! Who needs men, eh?"
Once close enough, their stalking ceased. With arched backs and claws at the ready, a curious face spoke in a language he did not understand. When he gave them a puzzled look and took Sherlock closer to his chest, she tried again in somewhat broken English with a thick accent. "New? From city? Why... here?" a hiss followed her words, saliva dribbling down her chin. John felt his own teeth sharpening, pointed fingernails threatening to puncture the man he held close.
Looking down, he found blood. Fountains of it. How had he not noticed the metallic stench in the air before? The man in his grasp inhaled sharply and nearly blacked out. Muttering a curse, Sherlock began dragging him up the stairs. He could hear Mrs Hudson gasp. She'd finally put the phone down, at least. The stranger in his arms grumbled as he came back to a better state of life.
Without trying he pushed into the sensation, whimpering (again) like a puppy wanting more. Mouth twisting into a grin, Sherlock began to pet him.
Sherlock was practically screaming his name by now, trying to catch his attention. This was not the way Doctor John Watson would die; not if he had a say in it. The branch he had found could just about reach John, and had a good area for him to grip onto even with numb hands. But John was still taking no notice. Sherlock had to poke him with it at least five times before he took the hint and held on as best he could.
Sherlock hesitantly entered the room again, peering around the corner. John was now sat up, eyes hazy and cheeks flushed ; clearly ridden with a fever. Still, he wasn’t swaying from side to side with nausea by now, which was good.
"Didn't have time," Sherlock glanced at the other's leg, noticing swelling and redness. It was hard to tell how deep it was from the rugged edges. The pattern suggested flesh had been torn off by something sharp, but done inexpertly so it ripped rather than sliced. Perhaps a knife? No, there were the remains of multiple puncture wounds in areas. Almost as if they were from teeth... had this man been bitten?
, it was horrifying. He was being taken over; these weren't his thoughts. The world around him reeled and spun, a hand that seemed to be his being placed over his mouth as he keeled over and retched, tears forming in his eyes. He wasn't sick, yet a foul taste still invaded his mouth and made his eyes water. Everything was too bright, too loud, too
Lips parted and breathing harsh, the figure in the corner gripped at his arms with slender fingers. After digging his nails into the skin, he could deduct that this was indeed happening.
Sherlock turned and held up his hand for him to see. Very gently, John took it and had a closer look. He raised a brow and pulled a face.
“Yes, I do. And I already rounded up the troops. Of course, nothing official but I called in the coven which I haven't done in ages. We will attack and get Sherlock back.” Greg looked frightened.
“Love you ...” He weakly lisped and sagged some more. Then the connection broke. John opened his eyes and looked into Greg's. He was on the floor and Greg knelt beside him.
“Have you ever been afraid of him?” Mycroft asked and the question made Sherlock think, really think.
“No, he never was. Let's go. We have to leave here quickly.” Soon after they had reached the fields and hid inside the ditches. There was some commotion where they came from.
“Fuck!” He yelled and his body twitched in Mycroft's grip. Due to his moving he forced Mycroft even deeper inside. He panted and groaned and moved so Mycroft very soon was able to make it two fingers. He spread him and opened him wide. Greg was wiggling beneath him making the most beautiful noises.
“I did some stupid things because I was bored once too often. So, Mycroft introduced me to DI Lestrade from Scotland Yard. He calls me when he is out of his depth which is quite often. I help him solve the crimes and he helps me not being bored. And I would like you to come along with me, write things down and be my assistant.”
They both slumped into the bath and showered. Sherlock sat on the counter and watched John cooking. He actually liked that; it was domestic. At first, he had thought it pedestrian but not anymore.
“I do understand. He is scary. Why don't we have dinner together soon? Then you could meet him in our flat?” Greg slowly nodded.
“Milk and nicotine patches then. I’ll get it. Please, do eat something?” He looked at him. Sherlock sighed.
John knew he wasn't fair. Ian would have kicked his arse if he could have witnessed this. His behaviour towards his slave. Sherlock. He needed to be honest with himself. Sherlock wasn't his slave anymore. He was a friend. Just like Ian had become his friend. He had been his dom. He had been training John until he knew what he wanted. And now Sherlock had turned from a bought slave, submissive, to friend and lover. And accomplice.
“I believe I am; you know?” A gentle smile was on Mycroft’s face and Sherlock did love the sight of it.
“Perhaps you require an incentive? I need to make you think about your behaviour.” More strokes hit him on both his arse, his back, and the place where his thighs met his behind.
Now she had called to hear about his news and he might have slipped something that had made her suspicious. From what Sherlock could hear, she wanted to know simply everything. Mycroft calmly talked to her and ensured her that everything was just fine.
John had one knee on the bed and leant on Sherlock who had slung his long arms around John’s broad frame and pressed them together.
“Very nice, dear brother.” Sherlock put it back and examined the boots and Hunters. He approved of these, too. Finally, there was a rainproof jacket, a hat, and a new scarf. The colours were dark but Mycroft didn’t want to be seen. He needed to be inconspicuous.
“You threw me off your lap and as if by instinct I came up on my knees between your legs. My erection showed clearly and so did yours. But then you stood and I didn’t move. I just waited. I was excited. My cock pulsed and hurt. You came back with some stuff from your room. You told me to get naked and I obeyed. You tied my hands on my lower back. You forced the first ball-bag between my lips and it was glorious. You knelt behind me and took my prick into your strong hand.”
John was quick and efficient. Sherlock thought he was an artist with the rope and he knew what he was talking about.
“No, don’t look like that. The thought of having you like this right by my side arouses me. See?” He pointed between his legs where his cock proudly stood up. Sherlock felt a bit better and John quickly added another question. He knew how fast he could become annoyed.
“We can have beautiful family dinners in the near future then.” They looked at each other and then broke into laughter.
“Hey…” He weakly lifted his arm and it still trembled. John took his hand and kissed his knuckles one after another.
John couldn't really imagine Sherlock doing the things Greg described; behaving like a maniac, shouting abuse, deducing people, hurting people.
Soon he had two fingers inside and gently pushed while he stroked his cock. He panted while the water ran over his body. All over his freckled skin. He pressed his forehead against the tiles while he finger-fucked himself.
He slowly picked it up and opened it. Inside, there were still some folders, a notebook, and a pen. Mycroft felt around for more and found something stuck behind a zip. He pulled it open and found a picture. It was a picture of him and Greg taken on the beach in Torquay. Greg had insisted on a so-called selfie and both men laughed into the camera. The picture had been touched a lot and the corners were thin and folded over. Mycroft smiled and his finger moved over it. Then he sighed and shook his head. He put the picture back and stored his things into the bag. It was an alien feeling carrying the bag around but he felt like Greg was close.
„Me, too. We should really sleep for a few hours and continue tomorrow. We have the whole day left.“ Sherlock said having slumped into an armchair.
He stood in the middle of his living room and pulled a face. It smelled of cigarettes and alcohol and a little bit of food. He opened the window and leant on the sill. He looked over Baker Street and smiled. But then he stopped when he saw a black sedan parking a few steps away. He slanted his eyes. His brother still sent protection when he thought it was needed. He sighed and shook his head closing the window again.
“Thank you, Mrs Hudson.” He smiled at her and followed Sherlock. He stood in front of the door and stared at it. He swallowed and very slowly reached out. He licked his lips and finally opened it. He made the last step over the threshold and stood in his old living room. He turned around and looked at all the things restored. It really looked like before and he was glad.
Outside, the sun shone onto Baker Street and Sherlock turned his head blinking. The sun was too bright and too hot. It hurt his eyes.
“John…” Sherlock sighed thinking about the ring he carried in his coat pocket. Not now though. At first, he wanted to enjoy his punishment.
Sherlock took a second helping after having finished and his brother wondered about the feelings Sherlock had. He was quite convinced he knew about Ian's. But what about Sherlock?
John checked through the kitchen and found it fully stocked. He was surprised but it explained the price he had seen.
Then he listened into the flat but wasn’t able to hear Sherlock. He shook his head and walked into the kitchen to prepare dinner.
He came completely still. He fell on his side and rode the waves of his orgasm. He bit into the bedding waiting for the shaking to stop.
“Where should I go anyway?” He walked into the bath and saw the enema bag in the bin. He looked into the mirror and checked over his body. His body was covered in bruises, love bites, scratches and even welts. His hole burnt a bit and he thought it would burn more if he had fucked him. So, it seemed he hadn’t. Lucky him.
He let go and Sherlock fell back. He was circled again and he tried to stay where he was. But the moment the cane was pushed between his arse cheeks, he tried to crawl away.
Next, Mycroft checked his cock and balls and quickly freed him bringing more ice. He also got his medkit and took the ointment. He used it while Greg was out not to bring him more pain.
A technician checked why the mobiles hadn’t worked and found something was disturbing the signal. He found the transmitter by scanning the area and switched it off. He bagged it to have it examined.
“I bet you really are hungry now, right? Sit up and eat, mate.” Sherlock happily obliged. This was an order and he sat up. His hole was still sore and it hurt. But it was nothing in comparison. He had gone through so much more.
“Then get up.” John only hesitated for a second. But then he got up and stood beside the bed. He turned his head and looked at Sherlock who climbed off the bed now, too. On his way over to John, he pulled the tee over his head and threw it on the floor. John swallowed when he looked at him. He was pale and thin but muscular. He had a six-pack and John looked a bit closer.
When Mycroft took off the ropes around his genitals, he started to sob. Mycroft fondled his testicles and stroked him slowly until his whole body shook. He twisted his nipples and his hands came up and around Mycroft's neck. Mycroft felt Greg's balls pull up and twisted his prick and at the same time buried himself deep into him. Greg came screaming obscenities and his body twitched in helpless moves. He came while Mycroft kept steadily fucking him. Only when he felt Greg getting almost lifeless beneath him, he let go, too. He shot his load into him and then carefully pulled out. Greg throatily groaned and he lowered him down carefully. He pulled him close and lay down beside him.
“I’d prefer my bloody concert…” Greg muttered but finally left with John to join the forces outside.
“Anthea had called earlier. She told me about the arrests of Leicester and DS Grant. She is with the interrogation team now. She thinks we are safe.”
“If you are that lazy, you have to expect me to do exactly that.” They looked into each other’s eyes.
After a shower to clean up, they sat in the whirlpool and Mycroft made Greg open a bottle of champagne. He had even provided two glasses and now they enjoyed their being together.
“My brother will come over tomorrow and talk to you. You don’t have to be afraid. If you are still interested in me afterwards, we will try again.”
Greg leant against him for some more minutes until he gently pushed back and grabbed a tissue from the counter. He turned away blowing his nose.
Sherlock really still couldn’t believe it. There was the human male on his knees before him, servicing him after one night. And it felt so good!
He saw John in bed and asleep. But only John. Where was Sherlock? He chewed on his lips and moved the camera.
“I don’t want you to get hurt or bruised. Just go away then or call me. I will come and pick you up.” John held up his glass.
“You do know I prefer to text, Mycroft, but in this case, I am making an exception.” The smirk came very clearly over the line.
They continued on their way to Birmingham after John had promised they would stop on their way back to collect stuff, such as plants, earth, and roadkill.
“Don't know ...” His breathing pattern wasn't right, his heart was beating in an unsteady rhythm. Mycroft picked him up and carried him over to the bed. He undressed him and covered him with the blanket. Then he got his mobile and called his brother.
“But perhaps I should enhance the experience for you, as well.” John thoughtfully said and turned away again. He returned with a roll of bondage tape. Sherlock sobbed.
“Ian?” He hadn't looked left or right when almost running out of the place and now he saw DI Lestrade standing right in front of him.
Sherlock couldn't find any rest. The pain was intense and he had to admit to himself that he was scared. But he couldn't do anything, he could just wait for what was going to happen to him. He was alone. But he also knew that Mycroft would do anything to rescue him and so would John. And Greg.
A few minutes later it stopped but a second later the riding crop alternately hit his bare feet and behind.
Mycroft wished for the same with Gregory. He deeply sighed and pressed his lips together. Then he started to type.
“Both of them drove back to their station. They have been ordered back to report to their super or so they told me.” Greg hummed. He needed to talk to Mycroft. He went up into his room to have a look at the delivery. The note Mycroft had given the delivery guy had only said
“There it is. Please! Have a look with me?” He asked and heavily fell on the sofa stretching out his long legs.
“This will teach you some respect. This is punishment for degrading me in front of that DI. You will never do this again. Am I understood?” Sherlock carefully nodded.
Mycroft got a text from his protection detail a while later telling him that the stables were cleared and he was safe to go. They left and rode over always followed by Rogers and a colleague. Mycroft parked the car and they talked to the owner. He was rather pleased with the place. It looked well taken care of and so were the horses.
“Witness reports of his death. It was in the papers. He died in a restaurant and several people witnessed his sudden death. Also, look at his eyes.” John carefully pulled open the lid. His eyes were blood-shed and he hummed.
He didn't want them to have fights because of the sex. Mycroft needed to be happy. He deserved to be happy. And if he needed to ask questions or even experiment, then he should do just so. But he needed Greg to do so. Greg needed to provide assistance in this matter. They needed to talk. Urgently.
“I agree. I will carry a mattress in here from one of the other rooms. Then we can each sleep for some hours.” But Mycroft shook his head.
Now he wanted him to come down his throat. Now he actually wanted him to fuck his mouth, hold him tighter, and push into him.
Sherlock pressed John against the counter. His leg was between John’s and pressed up against his crotch. John spread his legs and groped his behind. Sherlock’s fingers were carding through his hair. And they were kissing.
“You understood me perfectly well, John. Please, afford me some dignity?” He spoke with a low voice and velvet timbre. It went right down John’s spine and Sherlock watched him twitch for half a second. John closed his eyes and sighed.
He finally found it between the bed's frame and the mattress. It must have fallen in there when pulling out the belt.
Mycroft had seen them on CCTV. He had also told Sherlock who had just shrugged. He had known about it and didn’t mind. He didn’t want to join them. He had no idea why they liked it. He only knew he didn’t.
“No, of course not. I don’t think he would try to get to you first. But I think he would sense the same chemistry that I do, so he will be attracted to you. But don’t forget, he wouldn’t care for your feelings but I will.” John felt a bit of warmth creeping through him.
“Sherlock, thank you.” The flat was warm and a fire was burning. He shed his jacket and Sherlock hung it up by the door.
“Not just now. You need to have some water and I want to listen to your heart first. Please?” She just nodded. Sherlock had come back and held out the glass with water with a shaking hand. She took it and emptied it.
“I would like to know when you started being a dom. I mean, there must have been a certain moment when you realised what you were and what you liked.” Sherlock had problems finding the right words.
“I bet; he is as well.” They finished their beers and departed outside. Greg had quite the buzz and John moved him into a cab and sent him off. He walked home slowly and the cold air was a good thing.
“I caught an infection. I am inflamed.” His face was getting red while he hung up his jacket by the door.
“You are dirty. Go and clean up quickly. We soon want to start since we are having an agenda. Hurry!”
“Hold still!” He demanded and carefully unzipped the bag. And there it was, his dress-uniform. The hat was attached to the bag’s inside and so was the sable. Even his medals were attached correctly. A lopsided smile came up and he slowly closed the bag again.
He walked up into his room which he had only barely used and retrieved his laptop. He carried it downstairs and plugged it in. He worked once over his CV and wrote an application.
“No, let me. I want to do it.” John dropped his hands and was undressed very carefully. His clothes just landed in a pile on the floor. An enema set was already on the toilet lid. John eyed it and suddenly there was Sherlock’s hand on his lower back.
“Listen, scumbag. Never do that again or I swear to God, I will come after you. You don’t want that.” John looked and spoke extremely polite but Anderson could sense the danger emanating from John and he swallowed.
“Hallo, Sherlock. Greg will bring dinner for us. I thought it might lighten the mood a bit…” John swallowed.
“Let’s have a look.” They walked to the back and opened the door onto the terrace. They saw a bunch of police officers gathered, forensics was carefully moving over the lawn and some employees were watching. Amongst them was their host from yesterday evening.
“I believe you must be hungry after all of today?” There was his dom standing in front of him. Sherlock's head came up and he spread his legs.
Sherlock finished the greasy stuff and binned the rubbish. The woman gave him a disinfectant wipe because she knew him. He smiled up at her and stuffed several pound notes into her piggy bank.
“Good morning, Sir. I am very sorry for the state you found us in. Would you like a mug of spiced blood?” Mycroft gaped at him open-mouthed. This was clearly something he hadn’t expected. He cleared his throat.
“Move, Greg! Please! I can’t carry you and target them!” Now he hissed and watched Greg sway on his knees.
He waited for a few hours but John didn’t come home. Sherlock donned his dressing gown, took his cigarettes, and walked up on the roof.
“You have to get away from John for a while. You have seen where I work and how. I want you to stay there. Of course, I don't want you to work for me. Not like that, at least. But you already checked my books. You certainly could organise my business. Would you like that?” He looked at him.
“I might be doing that alright.” They leant back into their chairs when it knocked on their door. A second later Lestrade entered and John offered him a coffee at once. Since they had met for the first time on a crime scene, they had gone to the pub several times to watch a game. They had instantly liked each other and Sherlock wasn't even jealous. He actually liked them being friends and he knew that Lestrade was a good man.
Ian looked into the shadows and thought about his next action. He just had to try. He knew Sherlock needed to be comforted but he wouldn't ask for it.
“I thought so.” Next, the mask got pulled over his head. John locked the collar that came with it and the blindfold as well. It was dark now and the excitement reached another height. Sherlock was hard and leaking.
“I am happy for you. I really am, brother-mine.” He loaded some more food on his plate and ate. Mycroft was surprised. Sherlock was eating a lot.
“You.” John looked surprised and didn’t know what to say. “Does it surprise you?” Sherlock wondered. John shrugged.
“What?” Greg asked. Ian explained what happened and Greg shook his head pressing his fingers against his nose.
The bullet had actually grazed him and a large bandage covered his thigh. John had checked it himself but it wasn’t too bad. There would be a scar but the bone hadn’t been damaged, just parts of his skin had come off.
“No, you are not. And you gave him alcohol, Greg. You shouldn’t have done that and you know it!” Greg managed to look guilty and Sherlock just downed the rest of the tea.
“We need to get him inside. I know a doctor there. Perhaps you could help, Captain?” John worried his lips and looked at Sherlock. Sherlock just shrugged meaning
He opened his lips and Mycroft took the invitation and invaded his mouth. He dominated the kiss from the very beginning but Greg didn’t mind.
“I will arrange an office place for you. It’s not a problem. You can place your music into the music room.” Mycroft said.
Sherlock wondered about the envelope he had just received. Anthea had delivered it directly into his living room at 221B.
Sherlock stood and went into the bath to shower. He was dressed as impeccably as ever when he left his room and had a last cup of coffee. He was reading his emails already if there was anything up that demanded his help.
“You learnt something. Very good, pet. Now lick me, suck me, please me.” Sherlock was excited. He was fairly sure John never had sucked cock. Probably cunt, but not cock.
“He was behaving disgustingly, Mycroft. He was drunk and smelly. He hurt me and he was aggressive towards me. I defended myself. I had the right, hadn’t I?” Sherlock quietly asked after he had finished.
Sherlock reached for his mobile the moment he heard John clutter in the kitchen. He pulled up Greg’s contact and took a selfie. Debauched and well shagged as he was, he pressed
“Eyes on me!” John ordered and Sherlock looked up his mouth stuffed full of John’s huge cock. Saliva and snot were running down his chin and he was close to choking but he kept sucking and swallowing as he knew John liked it.
“We could try. It sounds good to me. I don't know what could happen to us. And I am rather sure Mycroft would like it. At least he will like the idea behind it. Greg wouldn't feel like being watched during dinner. It's nice when everybody has something. And less weird.”
“No, you are not smelly. I just noticed. It’s all perfectly fine…” Sherlock murmured rubbing his nose over John’s skin.
Now he felt better and finished the last case. He stood from the sofa and walked over to the window looking out at Baker Street. How often had he stood here and wished to be outside amongst the pedestrians? How often had he longed for his freedom?
There had been several incidents in the past where they were under attack. There had been a car bombing, a sniper as well as a crashed car or two but it had always been Rogers who saved him, who threw himself in harm’s way and ended up in hospital.
“Mycroft told me what you did this morning. I am also very proud of you, you know? And how is the Detective Inspector doing?” He asked.
“Step out.” John obeyed and stood there in his t-shirt and boxers. Sherlock started to rub over his prick and he bit into the plug which filled his mouth. Now he felt both the need to come and to piss. He had no idea which was worse. He had no ideas at all right now.
“Oh, yes, absolutely. He always takes care of me. Now you are with me and so you don’t have to worry.”
“I promise, John.” They grinned and then Sherlock offered his lips for a kiss. John pulled him down and kissed him teeth and tongue until Sherlock melted against him.
Suddenly John pulled out and hit him flat-handed in the face. Sherlock almost fell but got a grip on himself.
Finally, he did what he normally would never do. He switched on the camera inside the guest-room. It was a hidden camera and he hadn't told John about it.
Ian stared at his back and knew he had to act, had to make him speak. And he poked him into his back.
Mycroft didn’t move and just listened. He had hoped for this. Greg had a wonderful singing voice and he wondered if they could play music together. Mycroft played the piano very skilfully and if he played and Greg sang, it would surely be enjoyable.
“No, Gregory. You sleep. You look horribly exhausted. I was told already what you did. Had to do. I am glad you weren't hurt.” They looked at each other.
John hadn’t noticed anything since he was still concentrated on his food. He looked happy and relaxed.
Instead, he pulled John all the way up again and held him against his chest. His fingers came around the base of his prick and prevented him from orgasm. John almost cried in his arms.
John disappeared and Sherlock stared into the flames. Sergej pulled out a mobile and wiped over the display. Soon enough he spoke quickly and quietly in Russian. Sherlock understood everything. It was quite an interesting conversation and he would soon tell his Master about it.
“I wondered if I may join you in your pompous bedroom again?” John smiled at him and it surprised him.
He only had one bag and Mycroft swallowed. He had probably exaggerated. A little bit. Now it was too late to change anything and it would have to do.
“It's time, Gregory.” He nodded and followed him. They donned their coats and left the house with security on their heels. Reports came in that both John and Sherlock had left Baker Street by cab. Mycroft seemed to be pleased when his car reached the garage beneath the court.
“You are not trying to threaten me right now, are you? Like if I hurt Sherlock, there is another place for me on that mantle as well?” John sipped his coffee. Mycroft laughed and shook his head.
“Go away and do whatever.” John switched the telly on and didn't even look at him. Sherlock almost fled the room and only when he sat behind John's desk he quietly started to cry.
“Yes, I am. Thanks for leaving me a note and coffee. Greg told me where to find you.” John smiled. Sherlock didn’t.
Greg just waited them out. He knew when it was over when Mycroft moved again. Only then he spoke getting up already.
“No, this is not mine to do. You have to do it yourself. Get rid of it. Get rid of this damn sign of ownership, Sherlock!” Greg stared into his eyes and Sherlock met his gaze. For once the brown eyes seemed to shimmer metallic. Hard. This was a different person coming out and Sherlock felt the power. He swallowed. Greg seemed to be so strong. If he would help him, perhaps he could survive all this.
After more long minutes, he took off the gag and at once John started to pant. His whole body was sweaty and slippery. Sherlock loved it.
“You can undress all by yourself or I will help you. Your decision.” They looked at each other and the man raised a brow.
He needed to explain it to John later. He hoped John would still be there. Perhaps, he would leave and meet someone in a pub. Perhaps, he would meet someone who would sub easier than he, be less complicated, with fewer triggers.
He listened to everything his Master told him and then sorted through it. Mentally. His Master left him alone but kept watching him.
“I want to join my troops when they are going in. Feel free to come along. I know you want. We need suitable clothes and armour to do so.” Mycroft was serious. Greg was able to see that. He swallowed.
He carried everything downstairs where Greg already stood. He didn’t have a bag but a large cardboard box. He shrugged and a small smile tugged up Sherlock’s lips.
“Thank you. This really looks nice. You may keep dressing me like your Ken.” There was no reply from Sherlock.
“You will follow his orders, baby-bitch.” John said and Sherlock nodded his head. The man still was bare-chested but now fully turned on him.
John fully concentrated on Sherlock’s prick. He gave his best to show him how much he had missed this. Him. Everything. He showed him how scared he had been to have lost him.
“Here, take this. The card gets swiped over here and then hold your eye in front of this. That’s how you get in.”
“We have to be careful. Our tech specialist will move first. He has a detector who will show us electric lines and such.” Greg inhaled and checked his weapons. So, did everybody else. Mycroft stood by his side.
“Open your mouth, slut.” John was aroused like fuck and did as being told. The gag was buckled tight behind his head and he moaned deeply.
“No, he isn’t. Go ahead and call your big brother.” Sherlock pulled out his mobile and called. John climbed on the back-seat to watch over Moriarty. He didn’t listen to Sherlock talking until his voice became rather loud.
Sherlock had already compared how many times John had pressed the letter a, b, or z on his computer per minute compared to an hour on different days of the week. He had different lists for different times of the day.
Luckily, his middle name was only the first letter. But on Sherlock’s card were three first names written and he scowled.
“Let me up, what?” He roughly whispered into John’s ear and bit into the lobe. John moaned and shuddered.
“But he is safe, isn’t he? I mean, he doesn’t fuck around and… Anyway, I saw his file and he wasn’t infected with anything nasty.”
He had people everywhere, also amongst the police. And he paid a certain someone to have a look into the files there. Sherlock’s files were buried and blocked but the man found them. He gave them to Ian who read them all. Then he knew what to do.
“Myc? Bathroom, please...” He roughly said. Mycroft nodded and led him inside. He also closed the door.
Sherlock padded into the living room and followed the cluttering into the kitchen. John turned upon his arrival. His eyes roamed over his body and he smiled approvingly.
Several days had passed and Mycroft had come back from Baskerville. He hadn't told anything to anyone yet and no one asked. Sherlock knew better and Greg did, too.
“Sherlock, what's wrong? What happened? Did you hurt yourself?” He didn't answer him. He couldn't concentrate on forming proper sentences. His mind was fuzzy. He made weird noises. He sort of knew he had revealed his biggest secret. Mycroft would be very angry. He would hurt him badly. He was terrified.
“You know, when Sherlock was a boy and not yet a vampire, I used to drive him around in a hansom. Many rounds around our house until he stopped screaming. And I did the same with him after I made him a vampire. It always worked. I don't know why.”
“We will need to wait for a bit after just having had lunch. But I want to talk to you about something I found out this morning.” Sherlock explained.
“Now that's just perfect.” He laughed and clawed into his damp hair. He roughly pulled him over the ground until they reached a cage. He let go and opened the door. He kicked him into his behind and Sherlock just crawled inside and settled. Inside he wasn't able to stand or stretch out. He could just sit and lean against the bars. He also was still wearing the harness and the ball-gag. Sherlock knew better than to touch it.
John had one or two ideas regarding that but he would never ask directly. He would probably find out soon.
“Sure, whatever you like. I'll set up the table for us.” Sherlock chose a pot and heated up the meal. He tried it and put some spices into it. He knew how Greg liked his food. And he liked it like that too. Now he could do as he liked and it felt great.
His head came back up and he bit into the ballgag. The thing was constantly rubbing his prostate. His genitals were still tied up and he knew he would never be able to come like this.
John thought about the strangeness being on the receiving end of this. Normally, he was on top and gave everything to the women he dated. Now it was more like him hanging in the embrace of another man, a vampire for God’s sake, and enjoying his touches.
John felt the moment his sub had fallen asleep. He pushed him up and off his body leaning him against the backrest. He was deep under and didn't even wake when John picked him up and carried him over into the studio.
John shook his head and slowly got out of bed. He was achingly hard but sauntered over to the bar to pour another whiskey.
“Hush, don’t move. You have a bad concussion and need to rest.” Sherlock placed his large hand on his forehead. It felt clammy.
“Ian told me to take your pulse and temperature. I would like to do that after lunch and also bring your pills, Master.”
“See? Much better now!” He moved a bit back and lowered his head. He started to lick and suck his nipples before he attached the clamps. A feral groan was the answer but it was muted rather nicely.
“I see.” They looked at each other and finally, Mycroft made a step towards him. He gently touched his face moving his thumb over his cheekbone.
“You know, I am happy for him. Since you are with him, he is so much calmer, more relaxed than I’ve ever seen him before.”
Pleadingly he looked at his dom but he didn't dare speak. He knew better. The training he had gone through had been very severe.
“Thank you, Master.” Sherlock stood and laid on his back, arms and legs spread wide. John took several lengths of rope from the cupboard and tied him to the posts. He stroked him and caressed him while doing so.
“You might want to talk privately to Sherlock. I’ll only be in your way.” Greg said and made another move to leave but this time Mycroft even placed his hand on his arm to stop him.
But then he pulled his hand away. Surely, he was just here to tell him that he couldn't be with him anymore. What had been done to him, what he had done, had been too much. He cast his eyes.
“I will pull over. Go into the bushes.” And Sherlock did as being told. John got out, too. Just in case he would snap again. But nothing happened and he came back. He handed him a bottle with water he brought from Baker Street. Sherlock drank and leant against the car.
“No, I am not. He is a wonderful man. An attractive man. And I should be honest with myself. I like him a lot, perhaps a bit too much.” John said.
“Go after him and secure what's left! I'll go and get my brother.” Several men dashed after John Watson and Mycroft hurried into the room. Another soldier ran after him.
“Look at my finger, Sherlock.” He held it right in front of his face. Sherlock slowly opened his eyes and eyed his finger. Then he snatched it and held it tight laughing.
“I am going to fill your thin face up a bit. Botox, you know? You will look so much better afterwards. A bit into the forehead and beneath your way too prominent cheekbones will do wonders to you. And it will hurt, so we better use this.” He held up a medical gag and since Sherlock had been told to behave and be good, he opened his mouth. The rubber gag was shoved between his teeth and the doctor pressed on the rubber so his lips got sucked into the vacuum. Now his mouth was efficiently sealed.
but John didn’t really expect one. John got surgical masks for both of them and Sherlock pulled it over his curls.
“Nonsense. I have someone to do it. We have other things to do, remember?” He flexed his fingers and hissed.
“I am an army-doctor, Sherlock. I had several tours in Afghanistan and was trained at Bart’s. That’s why I know Mike.”
This man, a dom, was cooking him his beloved mushy eggs. He was excited about it. Soon enough, Ian brought him his plate and expectantly looked at him.
“Please, I just want you to be safe. Don’t get this the wrong way…” Mycroft tried to explain but failed spectacularly. Greg shook his head.
Sherlock tried to control his glamour. Now that he knew, he was able to keep it under control. He sat beside him and carded through his fine blond hair.
“You have just completely ruined this, slut. You need to be punished. Severely.” Mycroft forced his head up and made him look into his steely eyes.
“I know you. You were concentrated on the work. It’s all fine.” John tried to calm him down. Suddenly though Sherlock broke free and swung around holding a knife in one hand and a cucumber in the other.
“They will never find her body. She has just disappeared and everybody will assume a suicide after what happened to her. You don’t have to worry.”
Finally, Mycroft’s orgasm tore through him and the contractions around his cock did it for Greg. He threw his head back, pushed for the last time really hard, and came into Mycroft.
