"Uh huh. Love you."
"That means, 'soldier'," murmured Natasha.
"Sir, I'm afraid there's nothing more we can do!" the man protested, which Steve ignored as he clambered on top of the aircraft's nose, the blazing hot metal quickly burning through the soles of his boots as he attempted to wedge his fingers down inside the canopy's seal.
"I am afraid that without a proper reference point I am unable to predict a length of time for Master Peter's survival, sir. I do apologise."
"Home," Tony repeated, indicating the bowl in his hands. "Now, less talking, more eating, yeah?"
Steve's heart was in his throat as he clung to Tony's shoulders with his right arm, his left hand clutching his shield as JARVIS guided them to Peter's last known location. They had been sitting quietly in the coffee shop, with Tony working on his tablet and Steve attempting to read when the alert came, telling them that Peter had somehow become submerged in what was supposed to be a frozen lake.
Thor said as he landed a few metres away from Alt-Steve, indicating the tree. "
Sucking in a deep, shuddering breath, Tony swiped at his teary eyes and pushed himself up to his feet, tugging Steve’s dog tags out from under his shirt so he could better see them.
"Great. That's—that's really great," Peter stammered. "Um… see ya."
There were several other subject numbers mentioned in the file, all listed with various matter-manipulating abilities and all who were then terminated for various reasons, including Subject 141 who had demonstrated the ability to control fire, but who also ended up failing to capture Peter Stark-Rogers.
"Have a good day, little guy," Steve said as Peter climbed out of the truck. "We'll see you this afternoon."
"Well, I suppose if you've gotta have a reason then that one's decent enough." Tony brought Steve's hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "Ready to go see our kid?"
Steve laughed, an action that had been so rare lately that it almost felt foreign. "Well, you do always say that I'd made a horrible spy."
"Oh," Gwen said, giggling. "How'd your papa take that?"
"Very well. Then I would suggest that we spread out—"
name on the side of the building, which means that it’s also Pete’s name,” Tony pointed out.  “And if he’s old enough to know what we do here, then he’s also old enough to start having some say in it.”
about to waste it. Not when the lives of his husband and son, not to mention billions of others, were depending on the outcome.
Peter gulped. He knew he was approaching dangerous territory, but aside from the fact that he thought Uncle Bucky was just being silly in trying to push Uncle Sam away, with Project Phoenix coming up so soon Peter couldn't afford for Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam's personal issues to overshadow any of Papa's planning. Peter knew that Papa was already going to be worried enough about him and Dad while he was gone, and the last thing he needed was even more to worry about.
"Yeah," Scott said as he picked up another sandwich half. "So… ten months ago, I was, well, I was inside the Quantum Realm. Um… Hank, Captain, you know of Hank Pym, so… well, ah, anyway, that's probably not all that important. Um… not too long ago, Hank discovered that one of his old partners, this professor guy named Bill, had been taking care of a child who had been hit with some kind of experimental quantum blast, a blast that ended up killing her father. Long story short, this girl, who's not really a girl anymore, but that's not really relevant to the conversation either, so… Anyway, this woman now requires regular treatment with these quantum… particle things in order for her to stay healthy. So the day that Thanos happened, I was inside the Quantum Realm collecting the particles, and Hope, my—well, my—"
a nurse called, stepping back from the small, rectangular-shaped plastic container with a small syringe in her gloved hand. "
Tony thought as he and Peter attempted to decipher the various instruments and readouts.
"You mean the new king," Peter said. He tipped his head back, looking up at his papa so adoringly that Tony's heart lurched. "'Cause wasn't their king just killed?"
"It's all right, Captain, we can do the surgery without a general anaesthetic," Helen said. "It might take all the lidocaine in the entire state of Georgia to keep you numbed up, but I'll make sure that Dr Wright is aware of the Captain's metabolic requirements."
"Except that time when you got hit by an airplane," Steve murmured into Tony's neck.
“You’ll let me know if you need anything else, won’t you?” Tony murmured as he pressed a kiss between Steve’s shoulder blades.  “‘Cause if there’s something more I could be doing, then—”
"And how is your mother these days, Captain?" asked the general. "Is she doing well?"
"You guys need my help," he added, just as the alien smacked Papa square in the chin, sending him flying into the side of a building. Then he picked up Dad in his hand, tossing him off to the side as he wound up, preparing to throw his hammer.
"Yeah, I'd like that," said Peter. He swiped at his nose, attempting a smile. "When are you leaving?"
"No, I'm good," said Tony, which was true. Before he'd started dating Steve his meals—if one could even call them that—had consisted mainly of whatever Rhodey brought him on any given day. Tony had always made sure to keep the house stocked with food for Peter, even spending the extra credits for delivery since he usually couldn't leave the base in time to do the shopping himself. Howard had always been useless, only venturing out to the store when he needed to replace his bottles of whisky, but since Peter had been in the hospital Tony hadn't thought too much about groceries.
Now, he had reasons for standing still.
Tony breathed in against Steve's neck, trying to contain himself before poking his head back up to find Peter removing his headphones, a huge smile on his face.
"No, I'm not sure that I do, little guy," Steve said earnestly. Even his own experience as a small, rather sickly child could in no way compare with what Peter was going through. "But since it's not up to me I'll just have to take your word for it, okay?"
Like a young man, instead of a little boy.  All he’d needed was a dark maroon sport jacket and a pair of navy blue pants, and he could've easily passed for Tony in his junior year of boarding school.
Tears welled in Steve's eyes, mixing in with the stinging sweat and blurring his vision even more. "Oh gods, Buck, I really screwed things up, and… I don't—I don't know if Tony's ever gonna forgive me."
"Thanks, Ms Sharon," Peter said as he carefully manoeuvred his IV tree over the tiled floor. "I'll just be a few minutes."
"Phillips assured me that it was a harmless type," said Steve. "Or at least only minimally harmful. But the procedure was pretty intense. It felt like my limbs were getting physically stretched at the same time that I was getting the worst sunburn of my life."
"Oh hell yeah," Tony said with a smirk. "But that doesn't mean I want you to stop."
"Good," Steve said softly as he pressed Tony's palm to his cheek. "But we're not going anywhere until you're completely better, okay? Shuri said it shouldn't be much longer."
"It's the week before Thanksgiving," answered Gwen. "They want to give us plenty of time to prepare beforehand."
"I'm not from Earth, I'm from Missouri," retorted Blaster Guy.
Peter gave a nod, blinking back tears. "Yeah. Have fun on your date."
Three months ago, Tony would’ve answered Obie’s question without hesitation, his eyes firmly trained on the impeccable knot of Obie’s tie instead of his face.  And three months ago, Tony likely would’ve returned to his office with his tail between his legs, berating himself for once again forgetting the real purpose of his company.
"Now, you're sure that you have everything?" Papa said as they pulled into the school's parking lot. "Glasses? Earplugs? Snacks? Calculator? Pencils?"
"No, I'm sure he didn't," Peter said. He quickly downed the rest of his superwater and crawled off the bed, grabbing a set of the pyjamas Sarah had brought for him before walking across the massive suite towards the attached bathroom. Phillips had explained that this had been General O'Brien's suite, held in reserve on the topmost floor of the hospital on the off chance that he would require a hospital admission, and Tony personally found it hilarious that Phillips had chosen to allow the three of them to use it while O'Brien was now busy cooling his heels in a concrete cell inside the Air Corps brig. The suite, which was designed to look more like a luxury apartment rather than a hospital room, sported gold-plated door handles, silk and linen bedding and curtains, solid mahogany furniture, and a bathroom that was larger than Steve's entire barracks room, complete with a bathtub that could easily fit two grown men with plenty of room to spare, and a separate shower.
"I hope so, Петр," Bucky answered. "Стив told me that he talked with Директор Фыри, and he said he was hoping to get me a military ID and driver's licence within the next few months, once—" He broke off, swallowing hard as he glanced up at Tony. "He said he's just gotta tie up some loose ends first."
"That's absolutely right, Ma," Steve said.
"Yes, yes, that is indeed why I'm here," Thor said. He turned to Steve, his expression rather grim. "Captain, it is my understanding that you are departing for Africa at this very moment?"
, he thought as he entered the gym, which he was relieved to see was empty. Blotting at his sweating forehead with a towel, Steve set up the first of his three punching bags, sucking in a deep breath before planting his feet and throwing a hard right hook directly into the centre of the first bag. A sharp pain immediately shot across his knuckles and up the lower half of his arm to his elbow, a harsh reminder that he had neglected to wrap up his hands before he began.
Between the growing suspicions with General O'Brien—Steve was about ninety-five percent convinced that the Meridian spy was reporting directly to the general, or vice versa—increasing concerns about possible Meridian retaliation, and Peter's worsening condition, Steve, Tony, Sharon, and Sam had decided they couldn't wait any longer than that to initialise Project Phoenix.
Tony let out a frustrated groan. "No, nothing since they left. I mean, I know there's no such thing as warp speed, despite all of the television evidence to the contrary, but I would've thought we would've heard something by now. It's been almost two weeks."
As soon as he hung up the phone Tony shoved his fist into his mouth, biting down hard on his knuckles as he tried to keep his tears contained. No amount of tears would help Peter now.
Steve barked out a laugh. "Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's something like that."
"Oh my God!" Steve exclaimed, snapping his fingers. "That's Scott Lang!"
"I'm okay with that as long as you are," said Steve, brushing his lips across Tony's in a soft kiss. Then he hooked Tony's legs over his hips and lined himself up, his eyes trained on Tony's face as he slowly pushed inside him.
comply'," Natasha said with only barely tempered excitement. "Tony, I think it's working!"
"Bruce is right, Steve," Sam spoke up before Steve could even react. "And you know he's just stating facts here, right?"
Glancing up at the wall clock, Steve frowns when he sees that it’s only half past nine, his frown deepening when his thirty-minute warning for his department heads meeting pops up on his monitor.
"Oh yeah, it does!" exclaimed Peter. "And does the new house have any trees?"
Peter thought.
"Who are you?" he said in his Captain's voice, or at least what was passing for his Captain's voice with a tongue that weighed a hundred kilograms and a mouth that felt like it had been coated with a thick layer of rock salt.
"That's just so weird that your security systems were breached again, don't you think?" asked Ned. "I mean, if it was the same space aliens that attacked New York that one time, you would think that they would've attacked something more important, right? Like the White House or the Pentagon or something? Or do you think it's just 'cause they're still holding a grudge?"
he exclaimed inside his head.
Peter internally rolled his eyes. "Mmm, okay. But Uncle Sam said that one of the drones fired, so—"
“You’re welcome, bud,” Dad murmured into his hair.  “And how ‘bout we get you a haircut tomorrow, hmm?”
"I'm always ready for dessert," said Simon as Mrs Stacy disappeared into the kitchen. "Is it that cake that I saw in the kitchen?"
After only one date, he was already a goner.
Of course, no one had seen fit to tell him anything yet, but Peter could sense it anyway. He could hear it in the way all the adults had suddenly started whispering as soon as Colonel Phillips's press conference ended, when they had all been talking normally only a couple hours before. He could see it in the way Grandma's and Uncle Bucky's eyes glanced in his direction when they thought he wasn't looking, their faces all twisted and worried.
“So, how late were you up?” Peter asked, right on cue.
"And we're sure about this?" asked Steve, his hand shaking in Tony's. "Absolutely sure?"
you!”
"Well, unless you're about to tell me that you were just eye-fucking Phillips then I'm guessing that you think Stark is hot!" Bucky said with a laugh. "And if I'm wrong and you really were eye-fucking Phillips, then I don't think I wanna know, so—"
They came within seconds of each other, as they usually did, with Tony's arms wrapped around Steve's shoulders and Steve's face buried in Tony's neck. They remained there clinging to each other for several minutes, exchanging soft kisses and caresses until Steve was finally able to stop trembling.
"Hurts, Daddy," Peter whispered.
"Bucky!" Steve admonished, looking helplessly at Tony. "I'm so sorry, I don't—"
"Tony—"
All of which had worked perfectly, of course. And as long as Phillips gave the approval—which Tony couldn't imagine why he wouldn't—Tony would soon be able to upload JARVIS into the mainframes of each of the three space-capable X-302s and have him take over about ninety percent of the calculations the pilots would've been responsible for. The pilots would still have override authority, in the event that for some weird reason they believed that JARVIS did or tried to do something incorrectly, but in all the numerous simulations that Tony had performed on his matrix, JARVIS hadn't shown one single mistake.
Good ole New York City in April. Springy one day, and right back to winter the next.
"All right, let's cut the chatter out there, guys," Steve said, even as he couldn't help but smile at the playful banter. It was just one of the innumerable things that he loved about Tony.
"I'm pretty sure that's what the Captain just said, Senator," said Tony. "Would you like him to repeat his statement?"
"What the—?" Bruce said as he grabbed onto Peter's stretcher, stabilising it as another bolt of lightning appeared, even larger and brighter than the first and with its accompanying crack of thunder just as deafening. Steve instinctively shielded his eyes with his hand as he attempted to keep them on Tony, his belly swooping as he feared that another monster was preparing to join the fight.
“Uhh, yeah!” Peter exclaimed, licking his lips as he held up the box.  “I’ve never seen these in real life before!  I thought this set was only a myth!”
"Captain, Mr Stark, welcome," T'Challa said once they stepped inside the massive hall. The king was dressed in a set of very classy-looking navy blue robes embroidered with intricate golden threads, and standing next to a girl, perhaps a bit older than Peter, with elaborately braided hair. "Please allow me to introduce my younger sister, Shuri. She is in charge of all of our technological research and equipment here in Wakanda."
"Shh, honey, Pete's okay, he's with Sam and Bruce already back at the apartment. They're taking care of him, so now we gotta take care of you." Carefully Tony got to his feet, trying to support Steve on his badly shaking legs. "JARVIS?"
“I do,” Steve says, without hesitation.  He leans back on his elbows, gulping in three rapid breaths.  “Give me a countdown when you’re ready.”
"Ah, yeah, that's gonna be a no. Sorry," Bruce said firmly. He held up the syringe in front of Steve's nose, shaking it slightly. "This is enough tranquilliser for a hippo, or maybe even a triceratops, and you're gonna take it. 'Cause if you're gonna force me to reset and stitch up what looks like at least seven of your fingers and your left thumb, then I can't have you thrashing around on me while I'm trying to work. Not if you're ever gonna want to draw or paint again."
"So did I," Steve said softly. He tugged on Tony's hand, turning him to face him and very grateful for the dim light to hide the blush creeping up his neck. "I'd—I'd like to… um… is it okay if—if I kiss you goodnight?"
"Gwen!" Peter finally choked out, his fight or flight response obviously lagging behind a second or two. "Aahh, what're—what're—what're you doing in here? This is a boys' bathroom!"
"You mean the one I used to have to physically drag you down from every day when I got home?" asked Tony.
"Sorry," Peter said sheepishly. "Just wanted to let you know that dinner's almost ready. Papa's making tacos since Uncle Thor's coming up, so…"
Tony rolled his eyes, shooting his friend a funny look.  “Sam?  Sergeant Barnes?  You guys ready to roll?”
"Yes, I'm sure that comes in handy from time to time," Mr Stacy said suddenly. "Although I'm not sure I'd specifically choose the term, 'living legend'."
"That was very impressive, Mr Stark-Rogers, thank you!" exclaimed the lead judge as Peter concluded his three-minute unprepared speech. By sheer dumb luck the topic Peter had been given was the history of asthma treatments, which, thanks to his papa and his own experience with the disease as a young child, Peter was practically an expert on. Tony watched proudly behind his sunglasses as the entire audience applauded his sweet boy, a wide smile stretching across his lips almost against his will.
“And, Steve,” Natasha says before Steve can answer.  “I’m sure Tony’s fine.  You know how he is when he gets to tinkering with new toys, and I’m sure HYDRA’s got a few in there.”
"So, is your entire family going to be coming to the Decathlon finals?" asked Ned. "My mom's already been bragging to her book club about getting to stay in the Stark Industries building."
"Yes, that's exactly it," said Lang. "And that's when I got caught."
"Oh, my sweet boy," Papa said as he took Peter's hand, cradling it in his own. "Peter, have you talked with Uncle Sam about this?"
Tony thought, giving Steve’s hand another squeeze.
There was a short pause before JARVIS replied.  “Pardon me, sir, but I just want to ensure that I heard you correctly.  Did you say, Regina Williams?”
Peter thought as he fought through the neck-high grasses over to where she was hanging.
"Very good, sir."
"Well, that's the thing, kiddo," Uncle Bucky said. "Your dad seems to think that there was another program hiding down underneath JARVIS, or some such thing. And somehow, activating the tesseract caused it to… wake up and take him over."
But so far they hadn't, and Steve was at a loss as to why.
Tony hadn't thought it possible for Steve to blush any harder, but like he’d been a lot of times lately, he was completely wrong.  Steve’s blue eyes widened to the size of dinner plates as his lower jaw dropped slightly open, his cheeks and forehead so pink he looked like he’d been out in the sun for too long.
Tony whimpered as he slid his palms across Steve's shoulders and up to cup his face. "Anything, Steve. I'll give you anything."
“I have placed your usual order with The Three Amigos, sir,” replied JARVIS.  “Estimated time of delivery is twenty minutes.”
"Uh, yeah. I'm really good at it, actually."
At Peter's insistence, they had called the hospital to check on George Stacy, whose wife had informed them that he had suffered only a broken pinky finger and a mild concussion and would be discharged the following day. Mrs Stacy had also thanked them profusely for both the security guards who were watching her children and what she called, "Peter's life-saving heroics," saying Gwen had told her that Peter had risked his own life to save her husband, and that if he or they needed anything at all to let her know.
that Steve and Sam had on the arms of their suits. After his critical help during the battles in both the Miami and HYDRA bunkers, Bucky had more than proven himself a worthy addition to their team.
"Yes. Yes, that's a good idea," Steve said with a stuttered nod. "I'm—I can grab you an extra cadet's uniform when we get back for you to wear tomorrow, 'cause—"
"Yeah, sure, I can take a look at 'em, no problem," Tony said. "What kind of discrepancies are you noticing?"
"You saved us," he choked out, unable to catch the thought before it escaped from his mind. "You saved Pete, and you saved me, and—"
"Oh!" Antennae Lady said, still struggling against her web cage. "You're the ones Thor told us about!"
"No!" Tony yelped, squeezing Steve's hand when he flinched. "No, honey, just…" He couldn't risk Steve asking too many questions when Project Phoenix was so close to being implemented. "Not yet, okay? Let's make sure that the trial missions go okay first and then see if Phillips still wants to green light the whole thing. There's a lot of steps that kinda need to go in order here."
"Hell yes," Tony said. "We definitely shall."
Peter nodded, swallowing against the lump in his throat as they got into the car. "It's okay. I know your parents are gonna miss you too."
led to him spending almost three months in a coma after being pumped so full of HYDRA's magic wannabe super-soldier drug that his mind literally had to shut itself down until his enhanced immune system could fix it.
"Yes, we can have those too," said Natasha. "I've already spoken to Happy about it."
"Yeah, okay, you know what? I don't really care about who's jealous of who," snapped Dad. "All I care about is when Thor's coming back."
"If you give me a few moments, sir, I believe I can create a sort of work-around," JARVIS said. "However, I do not believe it will be very comfortable for you and Colonel Rhodes to utilise the interface for longer than a few seconds."
Papa chuckled as he patted Dad's shoulder. "Thor does tend to be a bit loud, but I suppose that also helps him be a better bodyguard. Scares people away."
Steve huffed out a ragged breath as he stripped off his jeans and underwear, shocked he didn't tear them in his haste as Tony slid off his own, tossing them onto the floor in a heap.
"Down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices," the robotic voice responded, raising all the hair on Tony's arms. "And this was one of them."
"Papa, are you okay?" Peter called as he landed on the debris-filled street. But he'd barely taken three steps towards his papa when the man JARVIS had identified as Dr Strange—who was for some reason wearing what looked like one of Uncle Thor's capes—went flying by, strapped to a large hunk of asphalt.
"Tony Stark," Tony blurted, just on the off chance that Steve had somehow failed to mention his surname. He carefully grasped Sarah Rogers's hand. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs Rogers."
"Which is something that you could've simply asked me directly," Phillips said. "Now, cut the crap and tell me the real reason why, hmm? So we can all get on with our evening?"
"Uh huh. Love you too."
“Would it help if I texted you to remind you to text me to remind me?” Tony asked with a wink.  He chuckled in relief when Peter gave him one of his signature goofy smiles.
"Yeah, he did say that. But the two things he said that I remember the most, were that originally the Nazis had wanted his formula because Hitler was convinced that it could help them conquer the world, and that the reason he chose me was because he didn't want the perfect soldier, he just wanted a good man." Steve leaned back slightly, his blue eyes troubled. "It's been hard lately for me to think of myself as that same 'good man' that Dr Erskine chose to receive his formula, especially since all these villains that we've faced lately are likely the result of research that HYDRA conducted with my blood samples. It's like they're just spitting in Dr Erskine's face, and with how the political climate has been turning lately, I'm just—"
The next couple of towers were taken in much the same manner, and after the fourth hit, Steve grabbed onto his shield, nodding at Natasha and Clint.
"Nope, I guess I don't." Sam downed the last of his superwater, banging the bottle back down onto the table as Bucky got to his feet. "Guess we'll see ya tomorrow then, Cap. Class starts at 0700, so don't be late."
"I think it's just 'cause my dad's been gone. Papa's never quite normal when Dad's gone."
"Not exactly," Uncle James said with a huff. "Nat and Clint have been going round and round with Fury all day, but Fury's not exactly the darling of D.C. anymore so they're not sure how far that'll get 'em, and I've been trying to get through to someone at the Judge Advocate General's office, but since it's a Sunday there's no one around the place that can actually do any good, and the one person I have managed to talk to doesn't even think that they can help because he says that Steve's technically no longer a member of the military."
Reaching for the bottle of water he kept under the counter, Steve quickly downed about half of it, drawing in a slow deep breath through his nose once he’d swallowed.  He needed to get himself calmed down if he was going to be able to make it through till closing time.
"Ah huh. And?"
Steve made sure to have his Air Corps ID badge prominently displayed on the front of his jacket as he and Tony headed out to the parking lot, his heart the lightest it had felt in a long time. Peter's sweet face had lit up so brightly the moment he'd set eyes on the two of them that it had been impossible not to feel giddy himself.
Peter shrugged. Just like Papa, Grandma's expressions tended to give her away.
not see that?
"Oh, whatever," Tony muttered as he grabbed his coffee cup and tablet and headed towards the kitchen, nearly running headlong into Peter, who was busy shoving Doritos into his mouth and reading from a piece of paper as he walked.
"Not yet, mo grá. I'm not gonna hurt you," Steve murmured into Tony's thigh as he added a second finger, with Tony's limbs going taut as he brushed across that magic spot inside him. "There's no need to rush."
Ms Sharon smiled as she patted his head. "I will. You enjoy the visit with your dads, okay?"
“Pete’s actually gonna start swimming,” adds Tony.  “He’s being coached by a guy who works over at Empire State.”
“All calls from the office are blocked as of right now, buddy,” Dad cut in.  He clapped a hand onto Peter’s shoulder as they stepped into their private elevator.  “Except for Pepper, okay?  I promised it was just gonna be you and me this weekend, and I intend to make good on that promise.”
“All right then.”  Steve gave a nod as he ran the card through his card reader, squinting at Peter’s name while it processed.  “Well, it was nice to meet you, Peter… Stark?”  His head snapped up in surprise, his eyes going as wide as dinner plates.  “Your name is Peter Stark?”
"Damn right, babe," Tony said firmly. "Just like how we'll always be."
They came so closely together it was impossible for Tony to tell who was first, but the next thing he knew his body was being bombarded with such intense pleasure that he actually thought he blacked out for a second or two, finally regaining some feeling in his limbs when he realised that Steve had collapsed half on top of him, his breaths sharp puffs of air against Tony's sweat-dampened skin.
Tony said on a groan as he curled his fingers around his cock, stroking himself in time with Steve's thrusts. "I can't—Steve, I'm gonna—
Gwen gave a nod. "Okay. See you tomorrow."
"Well, yeah, we do," said Clint. "But… Jesus. I'd hate to see what you guys think is really scary."
because of you and your treasonous cronies!  Good, honest people who were serving in one of the most dangerous places on Earth because they believed in something better, and you and your General West literally took a shit on ‘em!  And finally, fuck you for dragging all of these men standing here with me down with you, and all of their families!  ‘Cause you know what?  PTSD doesn't just affect the soldiers themselves, it affects everyone around them!  Their lives are forever altered because
"Nope, we're not starting that up again," Tony warned him. "Damnit, Steve, when the hell are you gonna believe me that none of this is your fault? I mean, for all we know what was going on here was going on at the same time as our house was being bombed, and at the same time as Project Insight! And you can't forget that HYDRA had their grimy hands on Loki's sceptre from the end of the Chitauri invasion until that battle down in Miami, and we still don't know exactly what that thing does, so there's really no telling what they could've been doing here."
"Okay, turn! Turn! Turn! Please,
"Indeed, sir. I am detecting no nanite de-coalescence."
Tony shot him a scowl, which was so exactly like one of Peter's scowls that Steve almost laughed. "And I told you that you were being ridiculous," he said. "Pete's not gonna think that you're weak, that's just a bunch of macho military nonsense. All he wants is to see his Papa."
"Okay, okay, just hold on a sec… did you say different
Peter gave a shrug, wincing when even that slight movement was enough to send pain shooting across his back. "I'll ask 'em, but I don't see why not."
Ms Sharon gave him a wide smile. "Oh, I love that! I was always hoping that Steve would find someone, he's just too good not to. And your father is a wonderful man, Peter. I don't think I've ever seen a more attentive parent."
"Yes, I do," Steve said with a wink, his hand sliding up Tony's thigh just enough to send a sharp burst of warmth across Tony's chest. "Call it an instinct."
—before doing the same with his left, adding a fourth Brooklyn in there for good measure.  Thanks to his warm-up he’s already as loose as a worn rubber band, but he repeats the motions anyway, so locked into his pre-race rituals that he couldn't not do it if he tried.
"Uhh, sure. I can do that." Ned did have a point. Watching Finley swim around in his tank was pretty relaxing, and something that Peter had been doing a lot of ever since Christmas Day. He had even set up a special camera so he could watch him while he was away.
"Dad, you've gotta fix this with Steve first! Please, it's really important!"
“Ah huh, but not the junior high’s, hmm?” Tony muttered.  “Don't wanna give any impression that I might be biased or something.”
"For a time there will be a need," Uncle Thor replied. "My people are strong, but losing one's home is enough to challenge the strength of even my fellow Asgardians, I'm afraid. However, as I am still not convinced it is in my people's best interests for me to be their ruler, I do believe that I will be back. I just do not yet know when that might be."
The group of strangers that Steve had taken five years ago and moulded together into the well-oiled machine that had not only saved the world, they had saved the entire
"Eh, I guess that's true," said Peter. "I bet Dad likes you better in this uniform though. And it'd be kinda hard to say your vows with your helmet and mask on."
"All right, all right, I don't need to hear the entire pitch." Tony stepped forward, entering Lang's personal space. "Mr Lang, I shouldn't have to tell you that all of this is contingent upon the fact that you will swear, for the record right here and now, to not
And finally, there it was, the confession Tony had been begging and pleading for ever since Peter had woken up from his coma down in that Miami hospital. Tony knew that Steve had been struggling hard ever since then, but he had always outright refused to admit just how badly.
“Um… do you have any idea why almost all of the clinical drug trials that Stark Industries was participating in were stopped six months ago?”
"No, no, I know you didn't," Bucky cut in. "It was that Stark guy this morning, right? You weren't expecting to see him?"
"Please," Gwen whispered once they broke apart, their foreheads pressed together. "Please be careful!"
"Yeah, maybe," Tony replied, even as he highly doubted it. He gave Happy a begrudged nod. "Let's just get it over with, yeah?"
“You have no.  Fucking.
Steve had just opened his mouth to answer when Clint's voice sounded in his ear.
"Uhh, this is it," he said, rather solemnly. "Price is six dollars plus tax, and it includes one free same-day refill."
"I understand."
"Captain," Thor said over the comm. "I have seen Prince T'Challa and his warrior guards safely to their transport. How can I assist you?"
"Yes, Your Highness, I do understand that," Thor cut in. The tall, strong god looked more frightened than Steve had ever seen him, which did absolutely nothing to calm Steve's already frazzled nerves. "But you see, my entire world, Asgard, was recently destroyed, by a force that I knew nothing about until it was nearly too late to save my people, and that is a fate that I would not wish on anyone. And especially not to the people of this world, who have so graciously granted sanctuary to what is left of my race. So, Your Highness, as a fellow leader, I beg you. Please listen to myself and my dear friends here when we say that this threat is both grim and imminent, and that it is imperative that we all work together in order to defeat it."
Besides Tony, of course. It had only taken Steve a few days to figure out just how much he could affect Tony with only a quick smile as he climbed down from his aircraft cockpit.
"Yes, sir," answered Steve. "But it was on my own time, so I'm not sure why it'd be necessary for you to—"
"The master suite has indeed been soundproofed, no need to fret."
"Building artificial Spider Vision," Sam said, impressed. "Bummer that you and Rhodey'll be the only ones that'll be able to use it though."
"And I do," Tony stated. "So…" He trailed off as he became engrossed in his work, adjusting and tweaking and rearranging the tiny nanite blocks that were not too unlike Peter's beloved Legos, only about a zillion times smaller.
Tony snapped.  “So you might wanna keep that in mind the next time you start pouting!”
why none of my towels can actually dry anything anymore," Mr Harrington was mumbling under his breath as they all exited the gym once practise was over. "I thought the water at my house had gone funny or something, you should've heard the earful I gave to the water company over Christmas break. Oh boy, did they hear it from me!"
“If it helps at all, I actually googled Tony Stark when I got home last night,” says Natasha.  “I knew I knew his name from somewhere, but I couldn't figure out where I'd heard it before.”
It was Captain Rogers, Mr Go-Get-'Em himself from the X-302 briefing.
"I'm real, mo grá. I'm real, and I'm here, and you're in my bed and in my arms, and I love you so damn much that I can't even tell you! Ni féidir liom maireachtáil gan tú, Tony. Ciallaíonn tú gach rud domsa, agus anois, ba mhaith liom go tiocfaidh tú chugam!" Steve trailed his fingertips gently over the scars marking the centre of his chest and down to his pelvis, curling his fingers around Tony's aching erection and stroking him in time with his thrusts. "You're so beautiful, sweetheart, I want to see you come for me!"
"Well, then it's a good thing that I don't quit, which you of all people should know," Steve said, crossing his arms. "So you just take your time, and when you're ready, I'll be here. But I'm not going anywhere."
Like a phoenix, he had been reborn.
like being reminded about his time in the ice, any more than Dad or Peter liked being reminded of their time in Afghanistan.
“Hey, Dad,” he said.  “Time to go?”
"Uh, yeah, Captain. You can come in."
"I am detecting a heartbeat, Captain, but I am currently unable to give a further assessment of Captain Barnes's condition," JARVIS said. "Please be advised, the aircraft landing gear apparatus has been severely damaged, including all backup systems. I will attempt to keep it level during the descent, but I'm afraid the landing will not be smooth."
"He's my commanding officer, Tony," Steve cut in. "I can't ask him a direct question like that. It's insubordination."
"Oh," Peter whispered. "Yeah, that makes sense."
"Tony?" Steve asked. "That okay with you?"
Because if he did, if he told her that almost every night his dreams were haunted with the horrifying scene of her falling, that he could still hear the sickening
"Quill does hate Thanos," Tattooed Guy said as he and Gamora came up behind them. "Because Thanos is Gamora's father."
"I love you too, Peter."
Natasha tapped the keyboard, bringing up a picture of another old Russian book. "This is the Russian Synodal Bible, otherwise known as Синодальный перевод. What we've been able to find so far is that there are certain phrases in this text that will unlock some of the files that we recovered from the Mongolian base."
"I think I might have some idea," Steve said as he gently squeezed, pulling such a loud moan from Tony that it would've embarrassed the hell out of him if he hadn't trusted Steve implicitly.
Somehow, though, only Hammer ended up going to prison for it, as Regina simply up and disappeared.  Leaving Tony’s heart in complete shambles and his life on a sharp downward spiral.
"Thanks," murmured Gwen. She elbowed him playfully in the side as they made their way towards the exit. "So, who's picking you up tonight?"
"But, nothing," Tony said. He was rapidly approaching the end of his patience with the whole thing. "And secondly, we're also gonna hold on to the particles."
There was a couple heartbeat's pause before Gwen burst out laughing, turning back to look at Peter.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ah, you're just mad because I lasted longer than you did," said Bucky.
And, while Gwen had assured him that she wasn't going to break up with him because of it, he still couldn't shake the fear that she would fall in love with someone else while she was over there, someone with a cooler accent than his subtle New York drawl, and that would be it for him.
"Yeah, honey, I'm here," Tony whispered, his eyes dragging down the length of Steve's casted arms, resting on stacks of small pillows. His lips twitched as he met Steve's eyes again. "Always the dramatic one, aren't you? If it's not diving out of windows from thirty stories up, it's busting the hell outta your hands."
Steve nodded against his chest. Of course Tony would know exactly what was bothering him. "I think that's the worst part of all this. Back during the war I knew my mission, and I knew how to formulate the plans that I'd need to complete the mission. And things didn't always go according to plan, 'cause it was a war, and stuff tends to happen that you didn't plan on during a war. But I still knew the objective, I knew who the enemy was, and I knew what I needed to do to take them out. But now… I guess ever since the whole mess with Project Insight, I can't say that I know who the enemy is anymore. I mean, SHIELD was completely infiltrated by HYDRA and no one even realised it until it was almost too late, and now we don't know how many of them are left or even who they are, and it just makes me so angry! And now if they've been able to manoeuvre their way into the government, then… what's to stop them from doing exactly what they'd always intended to do?"
"I don't know, mo grá," Steve murmured as he started trailing kisses along Tony's cheek and jaw. "You're the genius, you tell me."
Ms Warren tilted her head as a chorus of soft giggles erupted from several of Peter's classmates. "Well… you could've fooled me. We only have about ten minutes left, so why don't you see if you can at least pretend like you're paying attention, hmm?"
"Yes, sir," the cadet said, rather warily. Steve shot her a harsh look as she sat back down, hoping it would be enough to keep her from poking her nose where it didn't belong.
They were a team, as Peter had so aptly put it. And as long as they had each other, no obstacle would be too high to climb.
"Well, I don't know, little guy," Steve said, nearly backing into a particularly large display as another guy attempted to squeeze by him. "Do you know what kind of flowers your friend likes?"
"Two days from now should work, sir. That'll give me enough time to get all of them programmed and run through for troubleshooting purposes."
Steve smiled, his blue eyes twinkling in the barely-there light as he leaned down to kiss him. "I'll see you soon."
"The god you call Thor told us of a sister he had that was similar to Thanos," said Tattooed Guy. "He and Gamora bonded over their experiences with evil, murderous family members, and that is why Quill was jealous."
He waited until Steve gave a nod, then lowered him slowly into the water, his heart cracking with every tiny whimper and gasp that Steve made until he was fully submersed. As soon as he was in up to his neck, Tony stepped out of his armour and slid in next to him, pulling him onto his lap.
"Pete, I thought I told you not to worry about that," he finally said. "I don't want you wasting your strength on—"
Steve came to with a start, grimacing at the horrible taste in his mouth as he tried to blink open his eyes, regretting it almost instantly as a sunbeam stretching across his bed hit him square in the face.
"Oh, like you're not?" Bucky said with a playful pout. "And ninety-six is still not close enough to a hundred to say 'almost a hundred', so there."
"Aahh," Peter stammered. "I'll have to ask, but I don't think we're doing anything else that night, so probably."
"I'm trying, Pete!" Dad shouted as his helmet closed over his head. Peter yelped as they crashed through the remains of a star-shaped building, his own mask closing over his head as Dr Strange stepped forward, generating some kind of huge golden shield that encased the cockpit like a dome. The ship bounced hard onto the surface of the planet, the top portion of the circle breaking off completely as they continued on towards another ruined building. With Dr Strange's force shield intact, Peter gave up on trying to manoeuvre his gimbal, launching a web at the ceiling and curling himself into a tight ball as the ship touched down again, still shedding pieces of itself as it finally skidded to a halt with a massive groan, leaning slightly sideways.
, he thought as he peeled his eyes back open, a slow smile stretching across his lips as he attempted to take it all in.  Thanks to Dad’s work, Peter had done quite a bit of travelling, and had visited plenty of so-called bookstores that sold more toys and other accessories than actual books.
“Yeah, yeah, I get it.  You're hungry,” Steve said as he gently placed her on the floor.  After preparing their dinner, a can of tuna for Ashes and leftover Chinese food for him, Steve crossed the relevant steps off on his list and reached into his foot locker, retrieving his sketchbook.  After not having sketched all weekend, Steve was looking forward to flexing his drawing muscles again.
A chorus of murmurs fluttered around the room as the three men turned to leave, with Bucky lingering behind.
"Good afternoon, Gwen," Papa replied. "How was your day today?"
“I’ll second that motion,” Colonel Rhodes said quickly.  “I’m getting hungry.”
"Нет!" Winter Soldier stated, his nostrils flaring dangerously as the colonel scrabbled at the metal fingers wrapped around his throat, crushing his windpipe. "Я решил не подчиняться!"
Somehow, it just didn't seem right. The math was all wrong, and Tony had always abhorred when the math was wrong.
"Yeah, there is." He lifted his head, staring up into Steve's ocean blue eyes. "If it were just me I'd've already told JARVIS to start building them, but since it's not… I need to know if you're okay with this, babe. I mean, it's basically a really, really souped-up version of a home security system, which wouldn't normally raise any red flags anywhere, but—"
Tony whispered as Steve's lips attacked his neck again. "Honey, you know I'll do anything for you."
“General George West.  Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army,” Rhodey suddenly said.  “He’s a pretty good friend of yours, Mr Stane, isn't that correct?”
"That's not what you used to say," Peter reminded him. "You used to say that—"
And it wasn't until he’d managed to hoist himself up to clean up the mess that he realised that for the first time in his life, the blast of shame that usually followed his final list item for the day hadn’t occurred.  Even though he’d been taught his entire childhood that masturbating was a sin, even though he’d been told for most of his life that being attracted to men instead of women was immoral, and wrong.
Of which there were none. Aside from his too-low body temp and severe dehydration, Steve was otherwise perfectly fine.
"Dad and Papa are gonna need my help, JARVIS," Peter answered, grunting as he shot out another web. The cool
"I love you, sweetheart," Steve whispered in Tony's ear. "Táimid chun é seo a fháil. Geallaim."
The loud groan of bending metal immediately followed Winter Soldier's words, and Tony jumped when not even a second later he had ripped the arm from his chair and slammed it right across the face of the Russian colonel, knocking him flat to the floor with a very undignified shriek. Spitting out a mouthful of blood, the colonel attempted to crawl away as Winter Soldier quickly freed the rest of his limbs, grabbing the colonel by the scruff of his neck and slamming him up against the wall.
each other as they would fight against an enemy…
"Oh my God," Steve breathed. He blinked as he read across the numbers again. And again. And again.
T'Challa gave him a rather sly grin. "We do get news from around the world here in Wakanda, Mr Stark," he said. "And your incident in the Middle East drew quite a bit of coverage."
It wasn't fair. But at the moment, he didn't really care. If his guilt meant getting his husband and son back, then it would be more than worth it.
Peter nodded at his plate.  “Yeah, something like that.”  He paused, waiting for Dad’s answer.  “So… can I?”
Ma smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Then you've got it."
And since it was technically already Monday morning, then Tony was about to face a whole shitload of misery if he couldn’t figure out why the thing wasn’t working.
Power, riches, and technology, while almost everyone else—
Steve's smile widened even more, displaying all of his dazzling, perfectly white teeth in all their glory. "I say the same about you, mo grá," he said softly as his hands slipped around Tony's waist. He dipped his head, brushing Tony's lips with a soft kiss. "Even if you don't believe me."
"Yes," whispered Tony as he peeled Steve's t-shirt up his back with a light scrape of his fingernails, tossing it somewhere off to the side as their lips met and their legs intertwined, with Steve's already rock-hard erection pressing insistently into Tony's hip.
"Mmm," grumbled Tony. "Or I can just make sure that I develop some kind of interspace communications system before anyone else decides to go caravanning between planets. 'Cause this whole waiting next to the phone thing really freaking sucks."
“We’re gonna be okay, honey.  I can feel it,” he told Steve.  He brought Steve’s hand to his lips, kissing the back of it.  “And there’s even more stuff that we need to talk about.  Stuff that I think is gonna help you recover even faster, but we’re gonna wait on that until after Mr Wilson gets here, okay?”
Tony said with a soft smile. Once again, Steve had read him like a book. "I guess I really have corrupted you, hmm?"
"I think that's an excellent idea, honey."
Image Peter gave a nod, still wrapped in both his dads' arms. "Everything's okay now."
Again there was a pause, one where Tony could just picture his boy's adorable pouty lower lip. "I told Steve that he needed to tell you, and he promised me that he would," he said quietly. "He said he hated keeping it from you, and the last time I saw him he told me he was going to offer to bring you up here to see me after curfew."
But if Steve had his way, she was going to have to get used to it.  He’d barely been away from Tony for three minutes and he was already craving him.  The smooth touch of his skin, the intoxicating smell of his hair, and the beautiful sound of his laughter.
"I do concur, sir," said JARVIS. "Tesseract deployment in ten… nine… eight… seven… six…"
Papa raised an eyebrow, eyeing Peter warily. "Yes? What about it?"
Peter reminded himself as he pressed his palm to his chest, over his thudding heart.
Which was really,
"Nice shot, Rogers!" called Cam Mitchell. "Seemed for a second there that you weren't gonna shake that one!"
Which is just fine with Tony.  As much as he loves his boy, Tony’s got far too much on his mind at the moment to feel like listening to yet another story about how two of his classmates nearly blew up the fume hood during chemistry lab.
🐰 = it’s so fluffy!
How long had it been since he'd had a truly hot shower, instead of one of the lukewarm-to-freezing-cold variety after working yet another eighteen-hour day?
"And the government knew back when you were at university that they were gonna ask you to start designing space-capable aircraft?"
And Tony didn't like it, not one single bit.  He couldn’t seem to shake his overall feeling of dread that one day he was going to wake up—or not, as was more likely the case—and Peter would suddenly be a fully grown man, and have no further need for his father.
"Russian? Why Russian?" Mongolia had its own language with various dialects, so it didn't make sense for everything to be in Russian, unless…
"Thank you," Steve said, nearly slumping in relief. He pressed a kiss to Tony's forehead, taking his hand. "Let's go see our boy now, hmm?"
figure this out, Tony," Steve said. "You're not alone, remember? I'm right here. We're both in this together, whatever it takes."
"I am recording, sir."
"No, don't be sorry," Bucky said through clenched teeth. "Be pissed instead, like I am."
Grunting, Peter shifted again, shaking out his left arm which had fallen asleep. He hadn't thought about it until Flash Thompson happened to make one of his stupid, accidentally-on-purpose remarks during lunch about how Peter actually got to finish out the school year this year.
"I'm okay with that!" exclaimed Peter, bouncing up and down on his chair. "Oh, thank you, I can't wait to tell Gwen!"
Steve paused to regain his bearings, trying to swallow down the lump in his throat the size of a marble.
"I know, but what if I want to?" Steve asked, rather cheekily. His chin came to rest in the dip of Tony's hipbone, his beautiful face flushed and eager. "What if I want to make my husband feel good? What if I want to show my husband that he's the most beautiful man in the entire world?"
"Oh sweet Jesus," Tony breathed, tears of relief stinging his eyes. "Then get him the hell out of there, okay? Helen and Bruce should be arriving in a chopper anytime now, and—"
normal parameters, the UI had said. Not just anyone's normal parameters, but specific to Peter himself due to the gene mutation that began expressing itself shortly after he turned twelve. With dangerous body temperature drops always a concern due to the spider DNA embedded inside his own, Peter's bedroom was kept at a balmy twenty-seven Celsius, and even that higher temp required him to sleep in pyjamas that would've had Tony roasting in about three minutes flat. He and Steve's bedroom was kept at a cool twenty-three Celsius, the perfect temperature to allow them to cuddle together while they slept without the risk of either of them overheating.
"All right," Steve said. "Buck, get ready."
Steve's eyes immediately went wide. "Were you—?" he started, snapping his mouth closed with Phillips raised his hand.
"All right, all right," Steve said. They could go round and round for hours detailing all of Mitchell and Sheppard's goofy exploits after they'd had a couple of beers, and while Steve was sure Tony would be amused, and likely contribute a few stories of his own, that wasn't exactly why they were there.
"Steve, I promise it's okay," Bruce said. "We need to trust him."
Or at least Auntie Nat said it would, and Peter trusted her judgment.
"Now, look, Cap, I'm not saying that you'd have to make every single game. The Mets have all sorts of different season ticket packages, so there's plenty to choose from," Sam said as they rounded a corner on the main running trail that surrounded Central Park. It was a near picture-perfect spring day, with the air crisp but not too cool and the sun shining brightly off the Reservoir, but that also meant that it was absolutely packed with runners, joggers, and walkers, requiring Steve and Sam to dodge various groups and individuals as they completed their laps.
"No, wait," Tony cut in. "You know what, on second thought I don't really give a damn what you think." He sucked in another shaky breath, shivering like someone had dumped an entire bucket of ice down his back. "I just can't believe I was stupid enough to fall for it all."
In fact, on second glance, it was almost funny how one-sided it looked, kinda like the entire Avengers team had assembled to take on a simple bike thief or something. The warg creatures were all pretty much done for, their ugly carcasses littering the plain while the Giant-Man and Hulk squashed out the remaining stragglers, and the aliens seemed to be in full retreat, forming a line about fifty or so metres away with Thanos at their centre, the gauntlet on his left hand and forearm shining in the bright Wakandan sun.
"Oh, yeah?" Steve said as Tony's hand grazed down his chest and abdomen to wrap around his cock. They groaned in tandem as pleasure shot through Steve's body like a rocket. "And whose fault is that, hmm?"
A chorus of affirmative murmurs floated up from the team as Sam spoke up, "So, pretty much just another day at the office then, right Cap?"
"I love you, buddy," he said as he gave Peter his forehead kiss. "Papa and I will be back as soon as we can, okay? Don't be giving your grandma any trouble."
"JARVIS, is Pepper busy?" Tony said once Steve was out of sight.
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit that kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
"Yeah, and I think I'm gonna head on out too," said Uncle Sam. He nudged Peter with his elbow. "Bucky and I are planning to watch the baseball game tonight if you wanna come down."
"You're welcome," she said, with the slightest of smiles. "Now, I think you should go make yourself presentable for your boys, okay? Otherwise they might not recognise you when they get back."
He returned about ten minutes later, showered and shaved and in comfortable clothes to find Tony sitting on Peter's bed with his arm around Peter's shoulders and Peter curled right up against him. If it hadn't been for the IV running into Peter's arm, it would have seemed as though Tony was simply cuddling him to sleep.
"Very well, transport will arrive in approximately eight minutes," said the dispatcher. "Please have the patient ready."
"All of it. I heard all of it." He sucked in a deep, rattling breath, swallowing another cough. "So will you please tell me what's happened now?"
And especially not a government filled to the brim with HYDRA.
“Nah, I haven’t grown that much,” Peter mumbles as he shoves aside a pile of loose socks.  He lets out a triumphant “yes!” as his fingers finally close around a piece of rubber in the far back corner of the drawer.
"The glasses, yeah." Tony huffed out a long breath as he looked up at his husband, the unbelievably gorgeous man who loved both himself and his son beyond all reason. Steve's jaw was tight and his worry wrinkle was fading in and out, but Tony could tell that he was trying hard not to give into the panic simmering just beneath the surface, something that wouldn't have been possible only a couple of weeks ago.
"You got it, babe," Tony said as his helmet closed over his head. "JARVIS, our suite, if you don't mind."
But how could he tell her that? How could Peter tell her that he still saw her falling to her death nearly every single night as he slept, still saw himself trying desperately to save her, and being just a split second too late.
Something was wrong, but no one would tell him
be, and… I'm so scared that I won't be able to concentrate on completing the mission if I'm worrying about him."
"Pete, we don't need all the nerdy details," Tony said quickly. "So, Strange, you're telling me that you can't?"
But that was all a long time ago, and things were very different now.
"No, Peter's definitely not a dummy, but I'm telling you that this is coming directly from Steve himself," said Uncle James. "He told both Tony and myself that he absolutely does not want Peter to know what's going on until we have no other choice."
It was on the tip of Steve's tongue to continue to protest, but one look at Tony's pale, drawn face and he decided against it. Tony had needed the routine they had developed while caring for Peter down in Miami, likening it to caring for him as a premature baby after he was born, and Steve knew he was going to need that routine again, for his own peace of mind.
"Okay, but how long are we gonna wait? And where're my dads? And why won't anyone just tell me what's going
Tony, his beloved husband, was there with him, willingly lying in his arms, which meant that maybe—just maybe—there was a fighting chance that they would somehow be okay.
❤ = you wish you could kudos again
"Mr Pym will be hearing from Maria Hill within the hour, Mr Lang," said Steve. "We'll take it from here."
"All right… James. Thank you, sir," Steve said. It was beyond awkward for him to address a superior officer by his first name, but as long as the Colonel insisted he supposed it was okay.
"Oh, Steven," she sobbed as she came up to Steve, enveloping him in her arms. "Son, I am so—I'm so sorry. I didn't—I didn't—"
Peter glanced up at the clock, his pencil flipping increasing in speed and frequency. Patience had never been one of his strongest suits—Dad always said he got that from him—and while Uncle James had promised Peter that Papa wasn't seriously hurt, he really,
“Nah, don't worry about it,” Tony said, forcing a smile.  “I can take care of him.”
Obie frowned, letting out one of his
"Hey, you two," he said, rolling his eyes when he saw that Dad wasn't quite ready yet. "You are still thinking about getting married this afternoon, aren't ya, Tones? Does that still fit into your schedule?"
Gwen gave a nod. "Okay."
And then, once he got his own suit perfected, he was going to build one for Steve, no matter how much he tried to protest. Having to listen to his husband fight hand-to-hand against some maniac with a personal vendetta was just too much for Tony to take.
It was as if Meridia was just lying in wait.
And anyone who couldn't see that—
Tony had discussed the Phoenix mission with Colonel Phillips again in the days leading up to the trial mission, trying to come up with some possible way they could convince the government leaders to conduct the mission as designed by Peter. But it had all been just a massive waste of time. Phillips had gone above and beyond, likely raising suspicions and risking his own arrest as he attempted to persuade their leaders to see reason, and yet they still stuck to their notions that there could be no possibility of peace that didn't involve the complete surrender of the entire Meridian continent.
"I will."
"I know, and I'm sorry. You just—you've been doing so much for me already and I know it's been wearing you out because you're trying to heal too, and I'm just so ready to get his stupid thing off of me that I thought—"
"You're not bothering me, Gwen," Steve said, attempting a smile. "What can I do for you?"
"Protect the stone!" T'Challa called as he leapt from the top of one of the destroyed gears. "We must protect the stone!"
“Now, wait just a second!” Tony exclaims as he flies towards a set of concrete stairs, firing at a group of HYDRA soldiers emerging onto the roof.  “No one else is gonna deal with the fact that Cap just said 'language'?”
"Better security will help us all sleep better, babe," Tony cut in. "And I'm working as fast as I can, so—"
"Um… do you wanna—?"
, causing Joseph to wince as he watched it begin to climb directly towards the sky. He quickly pulled up, swooping into a wide arc so he could backtrack his course in case it was planning to try and dive towards him.
“I know you haven’t.  ‘Cause Obie’s kept it hidden from you.”  Peter shifted, pointing to the document.  “Look here.  You see where it mentions the Iron Monger?  Dad, that’s got to be Obie!  It’s just got to!  Who else do you know who talks like that?  There's no one!”
"All right, Avengers," he said in his Captain's voice. "Going quantum in three… two… one… mark!"
"Петр is gonna be all right, isn't he?" he asked Bruce.
A cold sweat broke out across Peter's body, and he let out a hard shiver as he grabbed onto Gwen's hand. "Uhh, I think—I think we need to get back inside now. Like, right
"Daddy!" Peter shrieked as he buried his head in Tony's shoulder, his hand gripping Steve's like a vise. "They can't—they can't have me! No matter what—I won't—I'm not gonna let them!"
"Ah, yep," said Bruce. "And it was a good thing that he did, since one of the guys trying to steal the particles ended up being exposed as a HYDRA mole."
I do apologise for the longer waits between chapters lately.  My oldest daughter was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder in October, and trying to figure out her meds and appointments and insurance has become like a full-time job 😞.
"Yes," Gwen said, smiling softly. "So I've heard. You're kinda like Harry Potter, hmm? The boy who lived?"
"All right, let's take a look," said Tony. "J, another scan, if you don't mind?"
"Yeah, I'm not surprised," said Colonel Phillips as he shot Steve a wink. "Ah, Howard's asked if he could go over a couple of things with the two of you before we get started. Just a couple of changes that he'd like to make to the regular protocol since Peter is a child who's still growing, rather than a fully-grown man like Steven was here."
And the fact that Peter tried so hard to put on such a brave face about it made it all the more heartbreaking.
Steve breathed in a shaky breath, his hands clenching into painful fists at his sides. Only his ma had ever called him Steven on a regular basis, and to hear this vile, treasonous, scum of a man use that name—
The heat from the exploding ship was so searingly strong that for a moment, Tony was actually scared that his suit might lose its cohesion. But once the fireball had dissipated and he was able to peel open his eyes again, he found that not only had they destroyed the ship, they had also taken out at least three universes worth of the Chitauri warriors.
“Tony!  No,
"Wait, so Gamora's in Wakanda? How?" Quill asked, dragging his gaze over to where his battered ship had stood. "Did she take the ship?"
He trailed off as Anthony suddenly burst through the door, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose and clutching his usual mess of papers.
"I'll be fine, Tony," Steve said quietly, very grateful for JARVIS's subroutine that filtered out their private conversations from the Avengers' comms. He rolled his shoulders, trying to work out some of the tension locked deep inside. "I am looking forward to getting home."
“There we go, buddy,” he murmured as the doors closed, tucking Peter as close to his side as he could.  “We’re almost there.”
"Oh, you think I'm joking, do you?" Tony asked, raising an eyebrow.
Sam gave a reluctant nod, leaning forward in his chair. "Daybreak! Furnace!"
He paused, pulling back so abruptly that Tony's belly swooped in fear. "Tony," he said as he pressed his forehead to his. "Tony, I—I've gotta—I want to tell you—" He broke off, frowning slightly as he pressed another hard kiss to Tony's lips. "I—I love you, Tony. I'm—I'm in love with you, and I want—I want to ask you if… Will you—will you come to my bed with me tonight?"
Anger welled up inside Tony, so burning hot that he felt he might self-combust. "So you're saying… that our government willingly sent those two assholes over to Meridia just so they could reproduce our tech?"
Right?
And Steve absolutely loved that their entire team was so close by. Even though Clint and Nat were stationed up at the Compound for the school year, they were still only about a fifteen minute flight away, which made it all that much easier to coordinate training sessions and missions.
There was no turning back now.
"All right," Steve said grimly. He found himself wishing yet again that Howard Stark had just left the damn thing down in the ocean, where it had fallen from the
Steve closed his eyes, grudgingly shaking his head.

“You have a scheduled conference call with the Stark Industries Board of Directors in exactly sixteen minutes and twelve seconds,” answered JARVIS.  “You then have a meeting scheduled with Miss Potts for 2pm, and a parent-teacher conference for Peter at school at 3:30pm.  Oh, and the dry-cleaner is reporting that your suits are ready for pickup.”
"It should only be another day or two," Papa added. "We're all getting excited to come home, little guy. We miss you."
"What's all this?" Tony asked as Steve's left arm slipped around his waist, pulling him close as he tucked Tony's left hand against his chest.
“None of these people are strangers, Obadiah, and you know it,” Tony said firmly.  “And neither are the two FBI agents who’re on their way in here to arrest you.”
"Hey Joe, where the hell're you going?" Chester called. "Base is in the other direction!"
"Yeah, and every single time the Iron Legion's been able to take care of things even though we're running twice as many convoys as usual. I really want to get the Triskelion mess done before Congress comes back into session," Dad said. He tipped his head back, removing his glasses and pinching the bridge of his nose. "I will be so damn happy once all this junk is over, though. I'm so goddamn sick of all those government assholes."
he thought as he felt himself drifting off. '
Tony shook his head as he gulped down the rest of the coffee in his cup, the hot liquid burning a fiery path down his throat and causing his eyes to water.
"Keep 'em coming."
He broke off then, biting his bottom lip so hard that Peter winced. Keeping busy had always been Dad's way of dealing with loss or grief or worry or any other negative emotion because it kept his mind too occupied to dwell on things that were rotten. But as soon as he paused for more than a minute or so, that was usually when the floodgates blew open.
"Yeah, I s'pose."
"They gave it to you too," Tony interrupted. "And me."
"Yes, except Thanos is stronger than Ego, and especially with the stones," said Mr Clean. "The four of us were barely able to withstand the power of the Power Stone."
sorry! I didn't—I didn't see you there, and I—I wasn't paying attention, and I didn't—I didn't think you'd be…" He paused, tilting his head back a bit as his eyebrows knitted together in confusion. "Um… why were you standing outside the boys' locker room, exactly?"
"I am unsure, sir. At best guess I would say the earliest would be in approximately twenty-four hours, perhaps more. I am of course working as fast as I can, but I don't believe I have to remind you that this has to be done very carefully if there is to be any data left that's worth examining."
"I am absolutely positive," stated Thor. "No question."
"Give me your best guess as to how this thing's supposed to look and overlay in red, yeah?"
"Quill, goddamnit, you've gotta stop!" Dad yelled as his helmet disappeared. "Stand down, we're still trying to get this off!"
He paused once he was outside Tony's door, breathing in deeply through his nose a few times just like he had the night before when he'd asked Tony for the date. It was embarrassing how long he had stood out there trying to work up the courage to actually knock on the door.
"Yes!" Scott exclaimed, wagging his index finger towards Steve. "Yes, Captain, that's exactly it. The Quantum Realm is a place. It's a place where—where I just—" He broke off, running a shaky hand through his hair. "I mean—"
Because he wasn’t in the middle of the Sokovian war zone, surrounded by enemy fire and collapsing buildings.  He was inside his own bookstore.
Steve gave him one of his adorable
"No, it's okay. I just… don't get how this would be possible? You've told me that none of the attempted convoy robberies were actually successful, right?"
"Oh," said Ned. "Well, I'll probably still get a new shirt."
Peter woke with a start, his lolled head snapping up and slamming against the concrete wall he was propped against, sending spikes of pain ricocheting throughout his entire body.
And then Raxton had disintegrated, just like the guy had at the lake, which meant there was now only one more name from the list that was still unaccounted for.
Such a sap, was Tony's husband.
"Nah, I'm fine," Peter said automatically, choosing to ignore the fact that he sounded just like his dad. "Dr Cho took care of me on the chopper flight to Atlanta, so… I'm good."
"Honey, please, just stop, okay?" pleaded Tony. "None of that matters anymore. You're back, Pete's okay, O'Brien and his goons are all locked up, and tomorrow we'll get to take Pete home. I'm not sure how else I can frame it, but that all sounds pretty good to me."
"Very well, Captain," said JARVIS.
Instead of attempting to figure out what went wrong, they just wanted someone to blame.
he thought as he carefully cupped Peter's round cheek.
"Yeah!" Peter grabbed his notebook, flipping past a bunch of pages filled with line after line of what looked like gibberish—random letters, numbers, and symbols—until he came to an unfinished drawing of a bird's nest containing three eggs.
, don't go!” Steve cried.  He reached his hand towards Tony, gasping when Tony backed away.  “I’m sorry!  Oh God, I’m so sorry!  Please!  Don't… don't go!”
Tony thought as the sharp staccato sound of machine gun fire burst from the speaker. Apparently the Meridian pilots were being a bit testy today, which Major Lorne had already attributed to them being jealous of the Langarans' new toys.
"Pardon me, gentlemen, but I must insist that we return to the Sanctum," Dr Strange said. "This will all be much easier to explain there."
"No, we don't," Natasha said firmly, nearly drowned out by Hulk's roar as he grabbed two of the speeders from midair, slamming them together. "All we know is that it's here somewhere."
"Potentially," he said quietly. "And that information is not to leave this room, do you understand me?"
his father, not you! You're just… you're just an old drunken liar who doesn't have anything better to do than torment people!"
"Hmm," Steve murmured. "Is that a threat or a promise?"
“Yes, and why do you humans refer to your transport vehicles as females?” Thor asks as he sends another HYDRA soldier flying into a tree.  “I find that rather… curious.”
Even when Peter had been in the NICU as a baby he was still able to respond to Tony's voice and touch, but that time when he'd been comatose, that had been a whole new level of horror.
“Yeah, I bet they were,” Tony said as they pulled into the school’s parking lot.  He cut the car’s engine, turning to his son.  “Look.  How ‘bout I see if I can figure out why the trials were stopped today, yeah?”  He didn't add that he already had a sinking feeling as to why, but he wasn’t about to tell Peter that.  Not until he knew for sure.
"You're damn right we are, babe," answered Dad. "Right, Pete?"
He had just started flipping through a first-edition
When no response came, he tried again. "Peter? Little guy, if you can hear me, please respond!"
"Papa usually is." Dad clapped a hand on Peter's shoulder as they headed towards the kitchen, where Papa presented him with what looked to be at least a litre-sized cup filled with cold chocolate deliciousness. Peppermint had always been his favourite ice cream flavour, but since he couldn't have it anymore, chocolate it was.
Or, was he.
"But, Bucky, I don't—"
"Hi," he said, tilting his head as his eyes narrowed. "I'm Peter."
Peter frowned as he leaned back against his pillows, Uncle Bucky's datapad resting on his lap.
“No,” Steve whispers as he rips his cap and goggles from his head, tossing them onto the deck.  He sucks in another deep breath, begging the universe for just one more chance as he turns to look at the times again.
"Papa!" Peter yelled, turning in shock as the prison suddenly disappeared and he found himself standing alone in what looked like a very old graveyard. "Papa? What's happening to me?"
a little voice whispered inside Peter's head.
At least Ned wasn't standing behind him and chattering nonstop into his ear like he had been most of the day. He'd had to leave practise early for a dentist appointment, and as much as Peter liked Ned, at the moment he was very thankful for the peace and quiet.
But as Tony held Steve in his arms later that night, unable to calm his racing mind enough to fall asleep, he couldn't help but think about what 'whatever it takes', was going to end up taking from them next.
Or with Tony. Were there universes out there where Steve didn't defeat the Red Skull? Where he was taken over by HYDRA and turned evil? Where he himself was evil?
Peter frowned, trying really hard to not roll his eyes as he felt Gwen squeeze his hand. It was at least the third time in as many minutes that Ned had turned around to ask them some silly question, making it impossible for Peter and Gwen to hold any kind of meaningful conversation.
Steve glanced over at Tony, who gave him a dubious shrug.
“JARVIS?”
"Not gonna happen, babe, sorry. You go ahead though."
He should’ve known that Tony wouldn't listen to him.
the entire area lit up by a single beam of yellow so bright that everyone in the Control Room yelped in pain.
"Okay," Tony said slowly, thinking. If he were able to double the targeting range of the drones, it just might be enough to force HYDRA out of some of their foxholes and into the open, especially if they were forced to move Steve because of it.
Peter's eyebrows shot up behind his hair. "M-mantis… used to work for your father? Who was a planet?"
"Yes, sir."
Peter thought, almost angrily.
"All right, bud, I think we're ready to give this a go," Dad said as he tapped some final commands into his keyboard. "Everything look good over there?"
They followed T'Challa into the sparsely furnished office, taking seats on the uncomfortable couches. Propping his shield up against his legs, Steve removed his cowl and leaned forward, his elbows on his knees.
"No, it doesn't!" Ms Sharon insisted. "Peter, there are a lot of things going on that you don't quite understand, so—"
Just like the battle in the Miami bunker, against Killian's Aminacin army, when Obadiah Stane blasted away Tony's arc reactor, and he crashed straight into a one-metre thick cinder block wall.
Tony also knew he couldn't just completely cut Steve off either.  Steve was so embedded into his and Peter’s lives, that it would be like trying to disconnect one of his arms or something.
And while Steve knew that Tony was right, at the same time he couldn't seem to shake the sense that time was starting to run out. Peter was already fifteen, actually almost sixteen, and Steve hadn't even gotten to meet him until he was eleven. He wanted to have as much time with Peter as he possibly could before he became an adult and left home.
And then, everything went black.
"I'm sure you could have," Tony said with a smile. "You're pretty damn smart,
"I lost him," he choked out. "Honey, I lost our kid!"
"Holy shit, you didn't just say that," Tony rasped against his throat, sucking into the tender flesh just above his Adam's apple. "You're such a naughty boy. God, I have managed to completely corrupt Captain America himself. Who would've thought?"
“Duly noted, sir.  However, I would hardly believe that at age forty you would qualify as ‘old’.”
Steve sniffed as Tony guided him back down onto the bed, sliding his leg across Steve’s waist to hold him as closely as possible.  Tony was right, it was still very dark outside.  But now that he was awake, he was suddenly very much aware of Tony’s half-naked body pressed up against him.
"Maybe," said Gwen. "Probably. I don't know, I guess I'll find that out at the interview. I'm trying to not get my hopes up though."
"That's my boy," Tony said proudly. "So you think we're ready to start running some tests on the channeling program?"
Although at this point, Tony was almost positive that HYDRA was already aware of Bucky's existence and was just choosing to ignore him. After all, what was a former brainwashed assassin to them now that they had finally captured their legendary enemy Captain America.
of his heartbeat. He wanted so badly to say something,
"Takeoff looks good, Phoenix One," Tony said. "You have a go."
The man chuckled, clasping his clipboard with both hands as he gave a slight bow.  “Ah, yes, Captain, it appears that I must apologise for my own manners,” he said.  “My name is Doctor List.”
To any other swimmer, Schmidt would be intimidating.  But to Steve, he's just another opponent.  One that by pure luck of the draw he has yet to face head-to-head.
"We have incoming," she said with a sigh. "And the bathroom's that way."
Tony had already likened Steve to an angel once, almost six years earlier in that godforsaken Afghanistan desert. Steve had saved Peter's life without a single second's hesitation on that awful day, setting in motion a chain of events that would've had even the most prolific fiction authors shaking their collective heads.
"Yeah, little guy, we're okay," said Steve. "Dad and I were just talking a bit."
Thor shoots Tony a confused look.  “What is this ‘icebox’ you mentioned?” he asks, indicating the vast mountainous terrain stretched out in front of them.  “As I can see, this place hardly resembles anything close to a box, and while there is plenty of snow, I do not believe that is what you are referring to.”
Steve Rogers has
Gamora shuddered, wiping a tear from her cheek as she shook her head. "Why?" she asked. "It's not like he's ever coming back here. He succeeded in his plan, the plan he spent years perfecting, and we both know where he's now gone."
Tony’s heart fluttered as Rhodey let out a slow grin, shaking his head.
Tony huffed, ducking his head down under Steve's chin as he slid his leg over Steve's hip. "You're lucky you're cute."
Tony smiled. "Well, you'd be the perfect person for that." Then he pressed a soft, lingering kiss to Steve's lips, frowning at the bathroom door once he pulled away. "Don't you think Pete's been in there for awhile?"
"Well, yeah. That's the theory, at least," said Dad.
night, the night of their ill-fated second anniversary dinner, just sitting there waiting in its little containment pack under his shirt where the arc reactor used to be, there would've been no way in hell that those goddamn HYDRA goons could've taken Steve away from him like they did.
Peter absolutely adored his Auntie Nat, and felt very privileged that she allowed him to see the softer side of her that she only revealed to a very select group of people.
Peter was going to do something that he should've done a long, long time ago.
"That's my brave boy," Steve whispered. "You're the bravest person I've ever seen, little guy, I know you can do this."
"Said like someone who used to think the very same thing, until he fell in love," said Steve. "Well, I won't hold it against you."
Tony thought as he watched Steve’s mouth open and close three separate times.
"Does your friend often… do that?" Mantis asked.
"And once again your instincts were spot on," Tony said softly. "You would think I'd learn."
“You should drink a little too, Tony,” Steve adds.  “It won’t do either of us any good to get dehydrated.”
Steve grinned, shaking his head as his two friends continued their bantering. He had never personally visited New Orleans, but he'd heard enough about the area to know that he probably wouldn't enjoy it very much in the dog days of summer.
“Hey, sweetheart,” Steve said, his slightly husky voice sending a burst of heat across Tony’s chest.  “How’s your day going?”
again anytime soon!"
Tony scoffed, fighting the urge to roll his eyes. "I know that too, Steve. I was there."
"Was he drunk again?" Dad asked bitterly.
"JARVIS!" Steve shrieked as he tore off his cowl, fumbling in his belt pocket for his phone. His hands were shaking so badly he could barely hold onto the small device, and his chest was so tight it felt like it was about to split open. "JARVIS, where's Peter?"
"Because the Стиви I know would never back down from a fight, no matter how steep the odds," Bucky said firmly. "Even if they seem insurmountable."
"I love you too, babe," he whispered. He slowly trailed his fingers in feather-light strokes up Steve's arms, then down his chest to his waistband, tugging impatiently. "And we're both still wearing way too many clothes."
"Suspicious of the guy," Pepper finished. "Care to tell me why, exactly?"
And Tony had never looked more beautiful, with his lidded eyes, slack jaw and mussed hair, and Steve was desperate to tell him. To tell him over and over how much he loved him, and how worried he had been for all those months, when he had feared that he might've lost him forever.
Tony said gently as the reporter launched into yet another monologue about the mysteries of the Wakandan nation, complete with brightly-coloured cringey slideshow graphics. "I know you're tired, and this isn't helping anything. No one knows enough about Wakanda to even make a semi-educated guess about what happened, so this is really just a waste of our time."
"Sarah found Peter unresponsive this morning at around 0730," Sam stated. "After she and Sharon Carter were able to resuscitate him, I transported him here, but—"
Uncle Sam asked as he and Uncle Bucky approached Image Papa.
"We'll be down in the procedure room if you need us," Sam said, clinging tightly to Bucky's hand. "It has an anteroom where Colonel Phillips said we could observe, as long as that's okay with you guys."
"Mr Stark! Do you plan on continuing to work for the Air Corps now that General O'Brien has been arrested?"
Taking a quick glance around the bus, Peter noted that all of the other students seemed to be engrossed in whatever they were doing and hadn't yet noticed the spaceship. Since he'd worn one of his Spider-Man suits under his clothes in anticipation of the museum being freezing—what was it about museums and their overactive air conditioners anyway?—all he would need to do is create some kind of distraction inside the bus and he should be able to slip away unnoticed.
—Tony to take care of him. And he also knew that Tony would do so eagerly, because he loved Steve beyond reason.
And in the twelve years since, Tony’s commitment to his son hadn't wavered in the slightest.  Instead of hiring a nanny, Tony chose to care for Peter all by himself, through the seemingly endless days and sleepless nights of the first few weeks of his life, working from home unless absolutely necessary.  Once Peter was a few months old—and sleeping just a tiny bit better—Tony started bringing him to work during the day, setting up a baby-proofed area in his office, and even conducting the occasional meeting while Peter slept on his chest or back.  After Peter was old enough to start school, Tony made sure to keep his calendar completely clear during dropoff and pickup times, and for any events Peter participated in.
"Uh huh," Peter answered, patting his backpack. "I've got one pair of each in here and one in my locker."
"Oh, I know that, Captain. I just…" Tears welled in Gwen's pretty eyes, spilling down her pale cheeks. "I just wish that… you know, Peter sensed that ship, when it came to New York. Before he saw it hovering there over the street, he somehow knew it was there, and… well… he had just taken a picture of the two of us, on his phone, and after he showed it to me, I asked him if he could take one with my phone too, but… that was right when he sensed the ship, and after that—well… he just knew that he needed to go and help. He said that you and Mr Stark would need his help 'cause it was gonna be even worse than you guys had thought it would be, and—and—"
"Ready, little guy!" Steve called. He quickly scrambled up a small pile of debris as Peter drew back his arm, jumping into the air to catch the shield just as another target crashed to the ground behind him, taken out by Wanda.
"I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist that you come with us, Mr Stark," the officer said, all attempts at politeness gone. "Now."
"Oh, really?" Gwen said with a laugh—and she had such a pretty, melodic laugh, Peter had noticed that on their second day of school. "You seem to have two of a lot of things. Two fathers, two Uncle Jameses, two backpacks—"
Gwen didn't know that he'd once been the Winter Soldier, though. There were still a few secrets in Peter's family that were too dangerous to tell, no matter how much Peter trusted her. Even though Uncle Bucky's record had been completely expunged of all traces that could connect to him being the Winter Soldier, the team had decided that they couldn't be too careful, especially with the possibility—however remote—of there still being more HYDRA agents out there somewhere.
"Tony, you didn't—"
"Okay, so? JARVIS has scanned me a few times before."
"That's great, Buck," Steve managed past his tight, dry throat. "I'm—I’m just—"
"Here we are," Steve said as Tony pulled into the cracked concrete driveway of a small, bluish-grey house that looked remarkably like his own, even down to the overgrown yard and scraggly bushes lining either side of the front steps.
The lady giggled again, prompting Peter, who was busy dusting the shelves a couple of rows away, to hide a smirk.
. Because they were all together again.
"Oh. Well, I hope it is soon, my Death Star set should be shipping in the next couple of days. We still gonna ask your Auntie Nat if she wants to help us build it?"
"Copy that!" Tony said, grunting as he pulled out of his dive at the last possible second, letting out a triumphant, "woohoo!" when the suit on his tail proceeded to crash into the rocky shoreline. "That's one!"
"Ahh, probably not without revealing our sinister plan, sweetheart," said Steve.
"Where do all these guys come from?" he yelped.
"I see, Captain," Davis said with such a smug look that Tony felt a wave of nausea pass through him. "And if I may, what exactly is your opinion on the Spider-Man?"
"Yeah, I'd say it's a decent possibility," said Dad. "They've got one of the stones, and Bruce seemed pretty adamant that Thanos wanted all six of 'em, so…"
Besides, didn't Peter always say that the bad guy always had to get his monologue in first? May as well let Hammer have his time in his so-called spotlight before things got messy.
"Steve!" Tony yelped, his heart in his throat. "Steve, don't—!"
The air around him was thick with the scents of battle; blood, ozone, and that scorched-earth smell that Steve could never forget no matter how long it had been since the war. The noise, which had been nearly deafening only seconds before, had faded into an eerie silence, broken only by the occasional distant muffled sob or cry of anguish.
"Which could potentially take an infinite amount of time," finished Tony. "Not exactly what I would call plausible."
"Well, just in case either of you were wondering, the Force doesn't work either," Gwen said, rather sheepishly. "Or at least I can't seem to make it work, so…"
"Which is absolutely true, bud," said Dad. "And since Pete and I have a ton of experience working together, I'm afraid it's you who's going to have to fall into line, doc."
"Well, why don't we talk more about this after Thor tells us what he knows about these rocks, hmm?" Steve said. He did not like to be reminded of how he'd been forced to watch Tony's self-sacrificing flight through Loki's portal during the Battle of New York, all while shamelessly begging him not to leave him.
Tony huffed out the breath he'd been holding, turning with wide eyes to Phillips, who gave him an approving nod.
"No!" Tony exclaimed, crying out as Steve grabbed onto his hand, squeezing it so tight that his knuckles popped. "Oh gods,
And while Peter supposed that excuse sounded plausible enough, he was still pretty surprised at how easily the country had bought it.
Peter thought miserably.
Peter shrugged, earning a deep frown from Gwen. "Not like I was hurting anyone. I wasn't even making any noise."
"Okay, that makes sense," said Peter. "But where's it heading?"
Peter gave him an emphatic nod.  “That sounds great!”
“Yeah, just a minute!”  He dried off his hands, dropping the towel onto his counter in a heap as he ran his fingers through his hair.
this universe he was observing, was the one they had been searching for all this time. The parallel universe that demonstrated that it was possible to bring the snapped people back, simply by going back to the correct point before they were snapped.
"Yeah, but the timing doesn't work out. He was still standing in Pepper's office bitching at the HR guy when the server was accessed."
Steve thought as he scanned through the file, finding nothing that he didn't already know.
He was safe. In Steve's arms, he was safe. The darkness couldn't get him there.
"Pete!" he cried, cursing the damned blanket that wouldn't unlatch from his right ankle. "Steve, I need—I need to get to Pete! I need to make sure that—"
"Uh huh."
His lungs ready to burst, Peter finally lifted his head, gulping in air. He pulled off his glasses, rubbing at his eyes as he tried to decide what to do. It was already late, after midnight, and he was so tired that he could barely hold his head up, but at the same time too afraid to go to sleep. His dreams had been nothing short of horrifying lately, and he didn't really feel like stressing Dad out even more by waking up screaming again.
"That was the original plan, yes," said Phillips. "However, due to shall we say, extenuating circumstances, we were forced to stop with just you."
"You're right, Nat," he added. "But I just… I just don't know if I can rid the world of this. It's just… I just don't think that I can."
—beautiful upper body. He spent some more time lavishing attention to Tony's scar before moving down his sternum to his abdomen, dipping his tongue teasingly into his navel as Tony's fingers wove into his hair.
"Never thought I'd see the day," Tony muttered. He turned his head just enough to glance in Sam's direction. "We've only got three shots available, so we gotta make 'em count."
"Three, by my count," said Rhodey as he flew past Tony, shooting as he went and managing to trap another suit between himself and the wall, taking it out with a well-aimed machine gun shot.
"So you're like me!" Wanda said in a rush, glancing furtively down at her hands. "And my brother, and my father! You're a—you're a—?"
"Yeah, sure, just give me a sec…" Bruce entered a few more commands, the
That made three.
“Morning, Steve,” Natasha says as soon as Steve steps into the office.  “Is it a good one yet?”
"Hey, buddy," Tony said as he rapped on Peter's slightly opened door. "You need help with anything?"
he practically screamed inside his head.
"I'm so glad you've finally realised that there's nothing more we can do for him," she had said. "It'll be much better for the boy to die at home with his loved ones than be here by himself."
Not that Peter could blame him. Just when Dad and Papa had started to relax again after the whole bunker battle, the incident at the lake happened and set them all back to square one.
I am so thrilled with all of the wonderful comments!  Thank you guys so much! ♥️
"Yes, sir. Several of the files were unfortunately damaged by the water, but there are a few that might be of use."
They were the proverbial immovable object, one that no unstoppable force held a chance against.
"Phoenix One, be advised that we are launching more backup aircraft in about fifteen seconds," Colonel Phillips announced over the comm. "Just hold onto your asses until they get there, understood?"
“Hey there, girl,” Steve said as he picked her up, rubbing the top of her head as he hurried over to his window.  He’d managed to avoid looking up at Stark Tower all weekend, and the contrast between now and last Friday, when he’d been filled with nothing but disdain and anguish as he’d studied the tall building, was not lost on him.
The battle for Wakanda—for
"It's okay, Peter, I understand," said Gwen. "Or, at least I'm trying to understand."
"Well, that seems to go around our house quite a bit, hmm?" Peter asked.
"Uhh, yeah," Peter said. He resumed his position, unable to keep his wide smile in check. St Patrick's Day was still over three months away, but the thought of getting to spend an entire weekend with Gwen, even if it was under the watchful eyes of most of his family, made him very, very happy.
A rather cruel twist of fate, he’d always thought.
Peter asked. "But
"No, you are goddamn
"Ha, ha," Peter said, practically vibrating as he opened his sketchbook and showed Tony an absolutely perfect drawing of the passenger airliner that he and Peter had discussed over dinner the previous night. Tony chuckled as he studied the drawing, recalling the way Steve had simply watched them in quiet amusement as they talked through the design, managing to work out most of the logistics before Steve had even brought out dessert.
As soon as the monitor went blank Peter flopped backwards, so hard that he nearly bounced off the side of his bed. He felt bad for snapping at his dads since he knew that they called him because they missed him and didn't really need the added stress of thinking that Peter was mad at them, but
"It's the least I can do," Stacy said. He stepped back as his partner approached, juggling two big coffee cups and a loaded paper sack in his hands.
"Thanks, JARVIS."
The officer frowned, glancing towards his partner who reached behind him, pulling out a pair of handcuffs.
"Yeah, I need it for a new school project I'm working on," said Peter. "Just one of the regular laptops though, nothing too fancy. I just wanted to let you know first."
Oh, Steve always saved plenty for Peter as well, who Tony was convinced Steve couldn't adore more if he had been his own child, but Tony had seen enough of Steve’s smiles during their months of dating to have discerned the tiny differences in those that he reserved just for him.
"Dad, it's fine," Peter said. "I just wanted to make sure that you and Papa were okay."
"Well, we might just have to agree to disagree on that one," Steve said with a chuckle. "But I'm thinking if Peter does turn out to have some heightened senses and strength, that I should try and help him adjust to them a little. It's not easy to get used to having those sudden abilities."
And also of course, since Peter Edwin Stark was Tony’s son and therefore already a certified genius, Peter didn't buy his lame excuse for one single second.  Tony’s heart gave a hard lurch as Peter dropped his gaze back to his cereal, poking at the floating bits with his spoon.
"No, I don't think so," said Tony. "The Meridians may have been able to copy the design but not necessarily the power source. Not only is the arc reactor damn tricky to build, there's no way to fly into space using the standard power source, so unless I find something else while I'm poking around, I'm gonna go with a 'no' on that one."
Tony frowned as he slid on his glasses, checking the clock. "Yeah, yeah, okay, Pete. Look, I gotta go, but… we're not done talking about this, okay?"
"Whoa, now hold on a second there, kiddo," said Uncle Bucky. "I wasn't even supposed to tell you any of this, and now you're talking about trying to fix it?"
"No, the vibranium cores don't burn out like the palladium ones, so that's not the issue. It's just mainly about the pilots. With only three pilots we're looking at a mission that's gonna last at least three days, where with six it'd only last about—"
Steve breathed in, at a loss on where to start. "She would've loved you," he finally said. "She would've been plenty suspicious at first, she always was with anyone who wasn't Irish, but your charm would've won her over pretty fast."
Dad whipped around, his eyes so wide they were almost bulging. "
"I'm positive, Colonel, it's right the hell in front of me," Joseph said firmly, his heart leaping as the renegade aircraft made a sudden course correction, as though it was actively trying to avoid him. "Now, maybe it's just some kind of weather balloon that's malfunctioning or something but it's definitely heading directly for the power plant, so I'm gonna check it out."
The man he’d believed he had hated for almost twenty years, was instead the man he was falling in love with.
And of course, Peter wouldn't mention it to his dads. Not when he knew how worried Steve was for Tony.
"Okay, so where'd he go once he got off the plane?" asked Clint. "'Cause that'd be a pretty pricey cab ride, so—"
Peter was gone.
Pepper gave him a relieved smile. "Well, they're all from the R&D Department, or I wouldn't even be bothering you with them. Mainly what I've noticed is that the project leader signing off on the reviews is giving the exact same comments to most of his subordinates, which to me makes it look like he's not even reading them, which in a company this size just isn't acceptable, and—"
"Nothing 'cept a giant blur," answered Uncle Sam. "Almost looked like a sharp gust of wind if you ask me."
"Ah, just the two gentlemen I was hoping to find," Fury said, with that dumb, shit-eating grin on his face that Tony had despised for years. "Do you guys have a minute?"
"How's everything going down there?" asked Steve. "Are you safe?"
"Yes," said Gwen. "Which is why my dad gets cardiac checkups every six months. But your dad's not a completely normal person either, is he? Didn't you tell me that he got some early version of a super-soldier serum when he was little?"
"That's the day that Peter goes back to school, Tony, how can they do this? Now we won't be able to be there, and—"
A short pause followed.  “Um, you mean
Creeping close to the edge of his spot, Peter slowly peeked over, careful to not disturb any loose debris.
He also hadn't shaved in days, the itch in his cheeks and chin only adding to his overall grumpiness. It had gotten to the point the day before where Natasha had threatened to shave him herself if he didn't at least attempt to snap out of it, and probably would have actually followed through if Bruce and James hadn't had a breakthrough of sorts with Fury's suspected pager.
with him. Steve's arms were his sanctuary, the one place he knew he would always be protected.
Peter. I know who you are, and I know what you're doing. I just… I just wish you would've told me."
"Hmm. Well, maybe it's a pheromone thing or something." He trailed his fingertips down the length of Steve's arm, lacing their fingers together and chucking as he did so. Steve's tendency towards being extra sappy was apparently starting to rub off on him. "Now, I thought you were tired?"
"Mr Stark! Mr Stark! How many total credits were spent on Project Phoenix? Did the Meridian government cover any of the cost?"
"Copy that."
😭 = I got you right in the feels
"I'm trying, I'm trying," Steve muttered. He bit down on his bottom lip to keep from groaning as he pulled himself up using the metal railing, looking down at the tank just in time for Rumlow to aim and fire again. Steve leapt off the fire escape just in time, jumping down on top of a massive trash compactor before landing on the ground a metre or two away from his shield.
“Has anyone ever told you how incredible you are?” he asked.  “‘Cause I gotta say, that was pretty damn amazing.”
Peter sighed as he nodded, his expression glum as he launched the textbook onto his bed, crawling three paces down before executing a perfect backflip onto the floor.
Steve’s heart slammed up against his ribcage as he held his breath.  “So… is that a yes?”
But, really. It's not like he was just going to turn his ears off whenever the medical people started gossiping about him or his family, and especially not while they were discussing Peter's condition right in front of him. Even after Ms Sharon had asked the doctor to be quieter he'd still insisted on spouting off to the medical student he'd had shadowing him, no doubt trying to show off.
With a heavy sigh, Tony carefully turned a page of one of the notebooks, rereading the section he'd been studying and comparing it with one of the files that Peter had decoded. Peter had mentioned a semi-enhanced person who he believed could run at almost supersonic speeds, and while the file he'd decoded didn't mention that skill specifically, it did make sense given what had happened up at the Compound.
And if Thanos was on his way to Wakanda, that meant that Papa and the rest of the team would be forced to face him without Dad and Peter since they were now pretty much stranded on the sorry excuse for a planet, surrounded by a bunch of self-proclaimed—but definitely not plucky—weirdos.
Another day of this, no food and freezing cold, and he’s not going to be much use for anything.  Repaired leg or not.
"Oh, gods," Steve repeated, squeezing his head between his hands. His ma had told him that Howard had worked for the Langaran military's SHIELD division before the Battle of the Continents, but hearing it as a child and seeing it on an official Langaran military database were two completely different things.
"Peter!" Papa hissed, glancing furtively down at Dad when he let out a soft whimper. "Little guy, if you'll let me get a word in here, Dad and I have already talked about this."
Peter's eyebrows knitted together as he stared at Gwen, so long that one of the lunch ladies had to wave a milk carton in front of his face to get his attention. "Um… no, I'm pretty sure that my spleen is fine, Gwen, there's no need to worry about it. And I'm not in pain, I'm just… thinking."
"Uh huh. 'Night, Dad."
HYDRA was trying to retrieve the sceptre. And they were using someone who could apparently move faster than the drones could target in order to get it.
"Would you like me to commence with the render, sir?" JARVIS asked.
"Yes, sir. Quentin Beck is indeed employed as a project leader in the Stark Industries Research and Development department. He holds a Master's Degree in Engineering from Stanford University, and has been employed at Stark Industries for almost exactly ten years."
"Steve," Tony said as Steve unlocked the building's front door, holding it open for Tony to walk through. "Honey, we need to get you something to eat, yeah?"
"Um, can your brother run really fast?" Peter asked gently. "Is that why they keep him locked up?"
"That's forty-eight for, and fifty against, honey," Tony said quietly, his voice quivering. "It didn't pass."
There was a pause as whoever Uncle James was talking to responded, too quietly for Peter to hear.
it!” she says.  “Tell me everything!”
"What in the goddamn
Gritting his teeth, Steve pushed himself up to a sitting position and slid his legs over the side of his bed, careful to not allow his casted left foot to bang against the floor. The cast was also driving him completely mad. It was so bulky and heavy and made the skin underneath it itch like hell that he'd been sorely tempted on multiple occasions to try and rip it right off of him, and likely would've already done so if Tony and Peter and the rest of the team hadn't been doing such a good job of distracting him. Sam especially seemed to understand Steve's need to "jump right back into the swing of things", and as such the two of them had been discussing the extent of the Avengers' involvement in the compiling of evidence against the numerous HYDRA agents found to be embedded inside the U.S. government and its corresponding law enforcement agencies. So far they had agreed that Nick Fury, Maria Hill, and George Stacy would take point in the tracking down of any rogue operatives, with the hope that it would help SHIELD to further distance itself from the HYDRA moles once embedded inside it and reestablish the agency in a more positive light, with the Avengers assisting with searches if it became necessary.
“Oh God, Tony, I don't know,” Papa said, his voice so thick that tears pricked Peter’s eyes.  “I don't know if I’m—if I’m strong enough, I don't know if I can—”
the nightmares went away, just that they
T'Challa gave a nod. "Thank you."
"Ah, I highly doubt it, Tony," Bruce said. "Thor barely knew where the ON button was, so—"
"Yeah, actually, he did. And let me tell you, Swiss Miss has got nothing on Papa's hot chocolate."
"And frequency," said Major Kowalski, raising his bushy eyebrows. "There was quite a bit of chatter about that too."
"So, my daughter mentioned something about the Decathlon team being invited to stay in the Stark Industries building down in D.C. during their big competition?" Stacy asked.
"Yeah, I've seen it," replied Gwen, rather dismissively. "Avengers' Tower is located in my dad's new precinct, and he took me around when we first moved into the neighbourhood."
Smiling, Gwen cut a big slice of the cake, which was covered in a rich vanilla frosting, and handed it to Peter. He dug his fork into the spongy cake, bringing a large bite to his lips. It tasted just as yummy as Gwen had said, and it wasn't until Peter had eaten three more bites that his nose finally caught on to the smell he had noticed almost right away but hadn't quite processed since he was so upset.
“JARVIS, what’s the rest of my day look like?” he asked as he scratched at the back of his head.
"Well, for starters, just admitting the truth is a huge first step," said Sam. "Finally getting it out in the open instead of just letting it eat you up inside, especially when it's been going on for as long as it has, that's a big deal. And I don't think I have to tell you that Tony's been worried as hell about you, do I?"
"No!" Steve tried to protest as Colonel Rhodes exited the car, walking in his carefully measured steps towards the emergency entrance. Tony had explained to Steve that he and Peter had designed the brace that Colonel Rhodes wore to stabilise his damaged spine, and that Tony had had to get special permission from General O'Brien to be allowed to use the materials he'd needed for its construction. When Steve had asked him why the general had been so reluctant to allow him to build the brace, Tony couldn't give him an answer.
"Peter!" Steve said sharply as he grabbed onto Peter's bleeding arm, causing him to shriek and jerk his head, connecting the back of it directly with Steve's nose, with the sickening
"Your dads are both fine, kiddo," Uncle Sam said as soon as Peter climbed into the backseat, before he could even open his mouth. "They and the rest of the team just had to make an emergency trip up to the Compound, so Nat and I are gonna be in charge of keeping you alive for the evening, okay?"
"Птер!" shouted Uncle Bucky as he practically tossed Gwen through the hole he'd made in the wall, ducking just in time to avoid being slammed by the fire monster's arm as it swung, taking out another huge chunk of ceiling that blocked the hole he'd just made. Peter could hear the sound of sirens appreciating from the distance, both police and fire, but he had a sinking feeling that not even the strongest fire repellant would be enough to put out the monster, who was still growing larger as it consumed every bit of metal that it came across.
"Just with us, sir?" asked Steve. "Not with the United States as a whole?"
But not even a second later the sand literally began to levitate right in front of his eyes, swirling in a clockwise fashion as it rose off the ground, not too unlike the tendrils of fire had at the theatre.
He thought he heard Gwen calling his name as he hurried back to the kitchen, searching for a back door that would hopefully lead outside. He knew it was freezing out, and that his jacket was likely buried under about thirty others somewhere in the front of the house, but all he cared about in that moment was getting away. Away from the booming music, away from Flash.
"And this isn't just another weekend training session or a fight against some HYDRA fire-zombie," Tony continued. "We're on a ship, Pete! One that's heading for who-knows-where! This could very well be a one-way ticket, and neither Papa nor I would've wanted this for you!"
expression. "We can tell Peter about this once we know some more information."
"Yeah, where were you guys?" asked Peter. It was rare indeed for them to not be waiting for him.
“Here.  Maybe biting down on this will help?” Tony says, handing it to Steve.  “Isn’t that what they used to do back in your day?”
"You're all set, soldier," Tony said with a wink. "I'll see ya soon. Oh, and remember: no punching anything. Or diving out of any high-rise windows. Or any windows, for that matter. Or jumping out of any planes without a—"
"I'll carry you anywhere," Steve said as he trailed kisses all along Tony's cheek and jaw as Tony took hold of his shoulders. "Tell me what you want, sweetheart. Tell me how I can make you feel good."
Jesus Christ, Pete, we didn't know where in the hell you were!"
"What do you mean, what am I doing here?" Steve gently admonished. "Tony, I've been waiting for you to wake up. I haven't left your side since you came home!"
"Yes, well, we're all aware of the depth of your genius, Mr Stark, so I'm confident that you can come up with something more suitable to our needs," Senator Davis said, giving Tony a slimy smile that turned his stomach. "But for now I believe that is all, and thank you for your time."
"No, just wait, please," he cut in. He needed to get this out. "Tony, I need you to know that no matter what happens with this mission, that I love you and Peter with all of my heart and soul and everything else that I am. And I will never, ever be sorry about that. No matter what."
Steve smiled widely. This was by far his favourite part of the whole plan. "Once Carol and I have deployed and activated everything, Colonel Phillips is planning on holding a news conference after the normal curfew time," he said. "We figure when people realise their lights haven't gone off, they'll be curious as to why."
Bucky grinned, his eyes flicking over to Sam, who was sitting with several of their teammates. "Nah. Pretty sure Sam is though."
"We're gonna get him out, Pete, don't you worry," Tony stated. "JARVIS—!"
"Yeah, ah, sure," Peter said. "Sounds good."
Well, Dad wasn't wrong about that. "Uh huh."
"Yeah?" said Bucky. "So? Probably a good idea to meet the guy's kid if you're dating him, isn't it?"
“Uh huh,” replies Peter.  “I figured you’d wanna make sure I know all the strokes and stuff.”
"Yeah, sure," Gwen said. She shifted her stack of books into one arm, holding out her hand. "Give me your phone."
"Hey," Tony murmured, sliding his fingertips over Steve's lips. "But you did, okay? Pete's gonna be okay, Bruce and Helen both said so. You caught him, honey. You caught him before he could fall."
Sam had once told Steve during a run. "
"No, no, no!" Peter cried, launching his web at the swinging van doors and holding on tight as it picked up speed, showering him with dirt and rocks. "This isn't how it was supposed to happen!"
"Hello?" Peter screamed again, slapping the wall so hard that it sent pain shooting up his arms like a million tiny electrical charges. "Please, someone let me out of here!"
He ran his hand through his hair again, trying to force his exhausted mind to function. "Steve! JARVIS, you need to get Steve's aircraft up and running again, he needs to reenter the atmosphere as soon as possible, and—"
Peter gritted his teeth as he fumbled with the combination lock on his locker, trying to get his fried eyes to focus on the tiny little numbers so he could actually get the thing to open without breaking it. Normally when he was as tired and anxious as he was he would've already been wearing his glasses, but since he had managed to break one of the arms off of them earlier in the day they were no longer an option. Apparently this growth spurt he was in was affecting a bit more than just his appetite, as he hadn't been able to control his strength well at all since pretty much the beginning of the school year. In addition to the broken glasses, he had also torn the shoelaces on three pairs of shoes, ripped the zipper on both a backpack and his favourite hoodie, and nearly yanked the passenger side seatbelt in Uncle James' car clear out of its socket. Papa had suggested that he and Uncle Bucky try some arm-wrestling sessions the last time Peter had spoken to him and they had helped some, but he still felt like his enhancements were coming out all over again, and it was all very unnerving.
Tony had told him multiple times over the course of their relationship. "
"Um, I s'pose I can ask him, but it was kinda just supposed to be another date for me and Gwen, so—"
“I did it,” Papa said, panting like he often did after his morning runs.  He sniffed as he lifted Dad’s hand, cradling it against his face.  “Oh God, Tony, I really did it!”
"Can I have you tonight, sweetheart?" Steve asked, brushing his lips across Tony's in a soft kiss. "Please?"
Steve blinked, well aware that he should've asked Hill how much she and T'Challa had already discussed the attack from space. They didn't really have the time to spare to be going in circles.
As Tony was certain this one would as well.
"Probably within the next couple of weeks, little guy," said Steve. "The last time he spoke to us about it Colonel Phillips seemed pretty eager to get going, so I doubt it'll be any longer than that."
"Yeah, I guess, but you're sure you don't have something better to do?" Tony asked. "It's not gonna be too exciting watching me read reports."
Steve scrubbed his palm down his face as he glanced back at Peter, lying as still as a corpse on the stretcher. His lips were no longer blue, thanks to the warming packs and blanket and the heated IV fluids flowing into his skinny body, but he still looked just as pale and lifeless as he had down in that Miami hospital, and no matter how much Steve tried to tell himself that it wasn't the same, it didn't seem to be working.
"Yes," Steve whispered, pleading with his lust-blown eyes as he rolled his hips against Tony's. "Please. Teastaíonn níos mó uaim!"
Steve paced nervously in the living room of the penthouse, waiting for Tony and Peter to join him.  They were heading out to dinner to celebrate a late anniversary of Steve and Tony’s first date, but, if Steve had his way, this was going to be far, far more than just a simple celebratory dinner.
And while Steve grumbled and swore under his breath—and then cursed out Phillips later that night while out with his friends—he’s never been more grateful for all of those hours of wall-touch practise than he is now.
And that was just the prototype.
😣 = the angst is killing me!
"But—!" Tony stammered, tears stinging his eyes as Steve called out a soft, "I love you" just before he was shoved into the backseat of Bartlett's car, followed by one of the agents.
“Let’s do this.”
Sam leaned forward, lowering his voice. "Well, if it's any consolation, it's happened to Bucky too, and not just once. He's dreamt about falling from the train too many times for me to count, but lately he's been telling me he's been seeing me in those dreams too, along with you and the rest of your Howling Commando teammates. And that he knows that we're together when he falls."
Tony had always ensured that he'd had a steady supply.
"Well, he does play baseball too, and he drives a motorcycle," said Dad. "And he goes out for a run every single morning, which I still don't understand how anyone can find that appealing, but hey, it'd probably be like freaky scary if he was too perfect, don't you think?"
"Worse? Oh, but isn't that one of the reasons why you love me so much?" Tony said with a wink. "You know I love to make things difficult."
"Okay, so… then what, we're just supposed to let this go?" Dad asked with a frown. "'Cause that's just not gonna happen."
Captain America! And Iron Man too? Oh wow, my girlfriend's never gonna believe this!"
"I would then venture to believe that he would therefore decline the offer of this armour as well, sir," said JARVIS. "Would you not?"
"A-shift take off on my mark," Steve said firmly, gritting his teeth as he gripped the throttle. "And be careful. I'm guessing we're gonna see some pretty heavy enemy resistance."
Steve shot him a sad look. "Is that also how it was for you?"
"Phoenix Two, standing by," said Barnes.
Tony had no idea. All he knew was that the thought of losing him was too painful to even contemplate.
Steve's words came out in a rush, so it took Tony a couple of seconds for them to filter through the fog in his head.
Those compliments had been so few and far between in the last year or so, ever since—
"We just have to make sure that he knows there's still hope," Tony said. "Mr Jarvis used to tell me that hope was always stronger than fear, and… while I never believed him back then… as long as Pete knows there's still a chance, then—"
"Uh, the Colonel Uncle James," Peter said, cringing as the song changed to one with a particularly strong bass beat. He gritted his teeth, forcing himself to try and ignore it as Ned got the game board set up.
"But those weren't timelines that had actually happened, Steve," Sam said evenly. "Yours and Bucky's did actually happen. Look, I know you don't like this, and frankly, neither do I. But I don't think it's just a coincidence that you're both having dreams like this, which leads me to believe it's gotta somehow be related to these gem things."
"Sounds good," Tony murmured. "I can't wait."
"Tony, I am so, so—" he started.
"Tony?" Sam said grimly. "Where's Steve?"
"Nope, no worries about that," Steve said with a sigh.
"It's nice to see you, Ned," Papa added. "Do you have a ride home?"
"Yes, but unfortunately I doubt that your security will be good enough," said Thor. "Which is why it is imperative that I accompany you on this mission. I absolutely must discover if my vision was correct."
"That's right. I am," answered Steve. He leaned back in his chair, pointedly ignoring his growling stomach. "And I'm not gonna let you give up on yourself. I love you too much to let you do that."
"I don't know anything," Steve snapped, wincing when Natasha's eyes went wide. "Look, I'm not saying that—well, to be honest, I'm not really sure what I'm not saying. All I can think of at the moment is that this just seems way too much like
Somehow, without doing anything besides tell the truth, Steve had managed to rattle him.
They set up their picnic blanket in their usual spot. Tony licked his lips as he watched Steve take out the platters of pasta and seasoned bread, nearly vibrating with anticipation. He had even brought a bottle of wine, which nearly brought Tony to tears once he opened it and handed Tony his glass.
"Yeah, don't I know it," Tony muttered. He was already six years old by the time his own defect was corrected, and that had been only because there wasn't a surgeon available in Langara who was trained in the correct technique until then.
If Hulk hadn't caught Tony when he did, then…
"Well, good." Phillips groaned as he pushed himself up from his chair. "Now, get out of here and get back to work. I wanna be able to present the final satellite design to the General's War Advisor next week."
"Maggie Lang, J," Tony cut in. "L A N G, in San Francisco. You got her?"
"Okay, but what if the reason why we're still having trouble locking down that final variable is because we don't really need it?" Tony asked. He showed Bruce the paper, one where he had scribbled down his best interpretation of what the Quantum Realm might look like based on Scott's descriptions.
"Who?"
It didn't help that even Peter himself had asked Steve very seriously if he truly liked his father or if he was just someone he was looking to fool around with. Steve had practically bent over backwards to reassure Peter that he wasn't the fleeting type, that he'd always been afraid of dating and relationships before he met Tony, and now that they were together he had absolutely no intentions of doing anything to mess it up.
“Oh, yeah!” Peter replies.  “I just need to get changed!”
"Besides HYDRA?" Steve said as he turned in Tony's arms.
"Oh, I don't know. Maybe the fact that you look like you haven't slept in about a year?" Rhodey said with a frown. "I'm sure it doesn't do Peter any good to see you like this—"
"Hey, sweetheart," he said as he wiped off his paintbrush with a damp cloth. "Everything okay?"
"Man, this isn't really even a fight," Clint said as they took off running towards their tower. "After all those tiny bases in Iceland I was hoping this one would be more of a challenge, but—"
Steve shoots her a questioning look.  “Um… no?  I’m not a spy like you are, remember?”
"On the bus?" Gwen asked, giggling. "Oh, Peter, that's so romantic."
"I did already ask your ma if she wouldn't mind doing our flowers," added Bucky. "'Cause she sure did a hell of a job with yours."
"Pardon me, Mr Stark," interrupted Mr Muscles, his razor-sharp jaw twitching slightly. "You mentioned the X-302 having a dual engine system, but I couldn't help but notice that there's still a central engine bell on that diagram."
He’s honestly never given it a single moment of thought until now, so where in the hell did this kid get the idea that Steve might want to coach him?
"Yeah, I'm okay," Peter answered. "Just… tired."
But first, he was going to enjoy the rest of his dinner with his fiancé—his
"Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm fine," Peter said, almost grimacing at how much he sounded like his father. "Just… my dad's been under a lot of stress lately, and I'm a bit worried about him. His heart's not exactly normal, so—"
"That sounds… really complicated," Peter added. "She just invited me to her house for dinner."
As he starts to swim, Peter wonders why the thought never occurred to him to try out for a swimming team.  He’s always enjoyed the sport, and was bummed when he completed all of his lessons because it meant he didn't have a good excuse to go to the pool anymore.  He still goes with Ned sometimes in the summers, and occasionally Uncle Happy and Aunt Pepper will take him swimming at the pool in their apartment building, but never anything more than that.
Which he had. It had been Steve's plans that had led to the successful raids against the HYDRA facilities scattered across Western Europe, and it had been his idea and his strategy that had allowed him to be captured by Johann Schmidt, the Red Skull himself, and ultimately defeat him.
"Yeah," Steve said softly, smiling as Peter politely thanked the checkout lady, looking very proud of himself. "Now look at me."
“You don't need to say it, Tones,” Rhodey said.  “Just… take care of yourself too, all right?  And I’ll see you guys at lunch?”
"Mr—Mr Stark, I'm so sorry, we didn't know that he's allergic to peppermint," Gwen said. "And my mom made a cake, and—"
"I know you're still here, mo grá," he whispered. "I know because I can see you. I can hear your heart beating, and taste the salt on your skin, and smell the shampoo in your hair. And I can feel your beautiful body against mine."
system, Steve," Tony said sharply. "
"Becomes a whole helluva lot worse," said Colonel Phillips. "Exactly."
"Wakanda forever!" T'Challa yelled, just before crossing his forearms in front of his chest in the traditional Wakandan salute. Bright silver-coloured claws emerged from the tips of his fingers as his helmet closed over his head, shaped to resemble a black panther.
“I’m positive,” answers Steve.  He replaces the armour between his teeth and leans back, bracing himself on his arms.  “On the count of three.”
Steve shook his head as he drew back, quickly removing Tony's glasses and gliding his t-shirt over his head before lifting him into his arms and placing him gently on the bed. Steve crawled up over him, gently tracing his index finger down the faint scar on his chest, Tony's beautiful brown eyes shining in the near-darkness as he curled his arms around Steve’s shoulders.
"Master Peter's nighttime disturbances are not as frequent as your own, Captain, but do occur approximately three or four times per week."
"Yes, it can," said Mr Clean, completely serious. "Thanos used it to make Knowhere look like a palace in order to trick us."
Yet another holdover from his early twentieth century upbringing.
As soon as the elevator doors closed behind Sam, Steve padded down the hall to Peter's room, poking his head around the door. He was still sleeping comfortably, his arms wrapped around his polar bear and his sweet face relaxed, with his bottom lip sticking out slightly. The sight of him was able to lighten Steve's heart just enough to make his footsteps back to his own bedroom seem a little less heavy.
"So, I was out?" Peter asked. "Again?"
"Like I said, sweetheart. Only in the good ways," he said as he snapped his hips against Tony's ass, forcing another strangled moan from Tony's throat. "I love you so much, mo grá. Is tú mo gach rud, and I just love you so damn much!"
And in true Midtown fashion, their team didn't miss a single one of their questions, earning them the National Championship and several ear-splitting whistles from Sam Wilson.
"Hey, yourself," Steve replied, leaning down for a quick kiss. Or at least, what he intended to be a quick kiss that somehow turned into a thirty-second makeout session. He had noticed that both he and Tony had been more intense with their physical affection lately, and whether it was out of anxiousness about the mission or Peter—or both, which was arguably more likely—Steve couldn't help but enjoy it.
Taking another sip of his coffee—
"Papa?"
he reminds himself yet again as he carefully shakes out each leg.
Peter opens his mouth, remembering at the last second to clear his throat first.  “Uh huh, I-I’m Peter,” he says as he shakes Mr Rogers’ hand.  “It’s a real honour to meet you, sir!”
encouraging."
"Just like this," he whispered, rolling his hips to meet Steve's and gasping at the delicious friction. "Together."
Tony sure didn't know what he'd done to deserve such a man, but he was definitely grateful to have him.
O'Brien nodded, taking another sip of his drink. "Ah, yes. Time. The healer of all wounds." He downed the rest of his glass, setting it back down on the table. "And you, Captain? Your wounds are all healed?"
Tony swiped his hand across his nose, barely avoiding sideswiping another car as he attempted to merge. "Uhh, Rhodey, how fast can you get to New York?'
"All right, we can let him out. Pietro, I want you to be ready for anything, you got that?" Steve ordered.
Luckily, Thor caught on immediately, raising his hammer above his head until the sky was filled with crackling lightning bolts and Steve felt the hair on his arms start to rise. He then watched as Thor shot the electric bolts directly at Tony, squeezing Peter's hand when Tony stumbled slightly backwards as he absorbed the charge.
"Yes, please," Peter called, obviously frustrated as Tony stepped into the room to find him struggling with the knot of his tie. "I don't know why I can never get these things on straight!"
"No, which is one of the main reasons why he's being moved," said Gwen. "The FBI thinks he's still too paranoid about his bosses getting to him or to his family if he talks, so they're hoping by moving him to this different place it'll make him feel more secure. That's also why we don't know where Liz and her mom went, they're like in witness protection or something now. It's really just a huge mess."
"All right," Steve murmured. "I'll be back in an hour or so to check on you."
The eerie sound and sickening smell of Tony's burning flesh as Steve raced him inside the palace, begging him to
“Ahh, just you wait till I tell him how brave you were,” Tony said as he brushed the tears from Steve’s cheeks.  “He’s gonna be so proud of you, honey.  He’ll be bouncing all over the restaurant like a ping-pong ball with it.”
"So did I," Steve rasped, his heart in his throat. "What the hell was that?"
"Anything. I'll do anything you want, just tell me."
"To take out HYDRA's presumed enemies," Steve said.
He breaks off as Tony slowly turns to look at him, his beautiful face so ashen beneath his beard that it appears almost grey, and his eyes so red-rimmed and sunken that Steve hears his heart audibly crack.
He wouldn't put it past Brock to try and break into his place sometime and go searching for the medals, thinking he could pawn them off on eBay or something.  Even Ma, being the smart, perceptive woman that she always was, waited until Steve had kicked Brock out of his life before presenting him with the box, not wanting it to fall victim to Brock’s tendency to claim for himself anything of Steve’s that he deemed valuable.
"How's Pete doing?" Tony asked, Steve's heart fluttering at how casually the question fell from Tony's lips. Like they hadn't just spent the entire last year lost in an endless pit of grief and despair.
"Okay, well, on that note, I think I've got a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one," he said. "You wanna gather your people around?"
Steve could understand Peter's hesitation. Asking him to move from the hospital, where he was semi-comfortable and mainly knew what to expect, into a house with an older woman who he didn't know at all was asking a lot of a sick boy, especially since his twelfth birthday was in only about three weeks' time. Sam and Bucky had promised that they would be there at the house with Peter as often as possible, and had even arranged for Bucky to have most of his follow-up therapy appointments there, appointments that Sam was going to have to pay for out of his own pocket now that Bucky had been dumped out of the Air Corps.
Peter rolled his eyes.  “You don't have to worry about me, Dad.  I’ll be fine.”
He had finally discovered a bully that he couldn't defeat, no matter how hard he tried.
Steve's heart was thudding so fast that he could barely stay upright, his arms tight around Tony as if to remind himself that Tony was alive and well, and not lying in a hospital bed somewhere with his chest gaping open. The image displayed right in front of him and everyone else was one that had tormented him every single day since the battle. It was a near-constant thorn in the back of his mind, haunting both his waking hours and his dreams.
"All right," said Sam. "What about?"
"I see," said Steve. "Well, frankly, that's both a comfort and a bit of a surprise."
"Cap, Tony," Sam suddenly broke in over the comm, sounding grim. "Nat's been able to break a few levels of encryption out here, and… we've found something that you guys should probably see."
And it wasn't like Peter didn't have time to talk with him. Aside from working on the project, drawing pictures, and taking the occasional nap, Peter's daily schedule was pretty open. He just would've far preferred having his own father there.
The next file was long, so long that Peter's fingers were practically frozen solid by the time he'd finished typing it out. He rubbed at his throbbing temples, sliding his glasses as he started to read.
"Again, sir, I'm not sure how that's relevant to our current discussion," Steve said evenly.
"We think it might've been a man by the name of Hank Pym," Steve said. "He was another civilian scientist working for the Air Corps, and was also personally present when Howard Stark was arrested. And as soon as Howard was found not guilty, he up and disappeared. No one's seen or heard from him since."
"Goodbye, Steve," he concluded. "I love you."
"Insect!" Thanos snarled as he pushed Peter into the thick red clay that covered the ground. Peter gasped, kicking and squirming as he tried to loosen Thanos' death grip on his windpipe.
Because while salt could be used as a seasoning, bitterness was just that.
With Tony, Steve was safe.
“Uh huh,” Peter said.  “What is it?”
"I was… Steve, I was a piping hot mess," he softly began. "Like a true, no-hope, wanna-end-it-all mess. It'd gotten so bad that not even Rhodey could keep me in line anymore."
Which he does.  Because he’s the dad, damnit.
"It's all right, babe," Tony had told him after they'd crawled into bed the previous night. "There's going to be plenty of other competitions and dances that Pete'll go to that you'll be able to see."
But how many times had Tony wondered the exact same thing?
But somehow that didn't often help all that much. Especially not when it seemed like the demons always managed to wind up on top while he, Steve, and Peter were just left there hanging.
Peter nodded, his eyes still tightly closed. "Just… way too loud. Hurts my ears. Way too bright too. It's like I could hear the cameras flashing."
"I'll see you soon."
"Oh my
But instead—
“Morning, Nat.  Still too early to tell.”  After saying hello to Lorraine, Steve crosses the office to his cubicle and starts unpacking his croissant and apple juice, grunting in resignation when he hears the telltale squeak of Natasha’s chair as she rolls backwards from her desk.
Steve frowned, fighting against the strong urge to cover Peter's ears as he tucked him even closer. "Why, Thor? "he asked. "What's going to happen?"
"So… tell me a bit more about this serum stuff, yeah?"
"Oh, and having Thor's giant axe embedded in his chest didn't have anything to do with that, right?" retorted Tony.
The warmth that had been bubbling around inside Tony’s chest like a jacuzzi suddenly spiked, almost as if the arc reactor was overloading.  Every time Steve said those words to him, it was as if Tony was hearing them for the very first time, complete with a replay of all of the shock, awe, and disbelief.
Such a rich colour of brown flecked with bits of green and gold. So beautiful—and somehow familiar? How was that possible?—and yet laced with an underlying layer of such intense sadness that it both pained Steve and intrigued him at the same time.
Peter would definitely be able to move more quietly and easily if he were alone than with a whole team of heroes, and the fact that he could see the supposedly invisible building could also mean that HYDRA wouldn't see him coming until he was already there.
voice. "Just keep going, you're doing great."
Steve gently patted Peter's shoulder. "You're welcome, Peter. Have a good night, okay?"
eyebrows that he chose to pointedly ignore. "Okay" had become such a relative term ever since he and Dad were attacked and kidnapped in Afghanistan that Peter wasn't even sure if he knew what it meant anymore.
"Sorry, hon," Tony muttered. He gave Steve's hip what he hoped was a reassuring squeeze. "I shouldn't've said that."
"Undercover?" she said. "Yes, for about the last three years, along with a few others here and there."
"Guys, I'm coming!" Peter croaked past his tight throat, sniffing as more tears threatened to fall. Dad wasn't just worried, he was
"Yeah, but—"
Steve truly was the most beautiful man that Tony had ever seen, and he was already counting down the minutes until he could drag him back inside and have his way with him.
"Okay, buddy. I love you."
"Knowing her, I'm sure it is," Steve said as they arrived at the door to Peter's room, slightly cracked open as per his usual. He rapped his knuckles three times on the doorway. "Hey, little guy, can we come in?"
"Then I wasn't," Steve said softly. Tears pricked his eyes that he quickly blinked away. He didn't like discussing it, not even with Sam, but he was also still haunted by that day. That day when he found Peter barely clinging to life, and saw the unbearable panic in Tony's eyes, panic that he couldn't help but instantly feel deep inside his gut. Steve still couldn't explain how he knew exactly what to do in order to save Peter, only that he had simply acted on instinct, and that his instincts had somehow been right.
"You can count on us," stated T'Challa. "My warriors and I will be ready."
Heh heh heh 😏
The hardest, most intense battle of their lives, according to Dr Strange.
"All right," he said softly. "JARVIS, please tell Tony to step back, I'm coming to get him."
"Yeah, but… honey, even if Bruce and I could figure this out, that doesn't mean it's gonna work," Tony said, his voice quivering slightly. "And if we try, and then it doesn't—Steve, I don't—I don't think I could—"
"Yes, thank goodness for Peter," Steve agreed, sneaking a quick glance at the wall clock. "And if we get going right now, we should be able to get back into the city in time to pick him up from school."
"I'm sorry," he finally said, sniffing and swiping at his nose. "I'm so sorry, I guess I'm just—"
"Yeah, Buck, I remember," Steve said softly. Like many elderly people in Brooklyn during the late nineteen twenties, Bucky's grandmother had come down with tuberculosis, and not even the expert nursing care of Steve's ma was able to save her.
Which it was, according to Peter.
"Aw, c'mon, Bucky," said Sam from Bucky's opposite side. "You know the dude's just trying to warm up a bit more. These baseball players aren't used to playing in such cold weather."
"Yeah, I liked how well we all worked together," agreed Steve. "It's too bad we don't have any way to contact him."
"No, I'm not," Steve said plainly. "If you're going to be accompanying us when we fight Thanos again, then you'll need to join us for our training sessions. Since Tony and Bruce won't be able to while they're working on this other stuff, it'll be even more important for the rest of us to know what we'll need to do."
"Would you like me to focus in on the seagulls, Master Peter? There seem to be quite a few out there at this time of night." JARVIS asked, causing Peter to roll his eyes.
that their Peter was supposed to arrive through those portals. They had been
"That's 'cause your father's not like any other billionaire, right, little guy?" Steve asked, ruffling Peter's hair. "You think you could pour the chicken broth into our big stockpot for me while I take Dad his tea?"
Dr Strange nodded once.
you allow your greed to overtake your own sense of decency and morality, however meagre they might be!  How
"Well, I'm not shocked that they didn't advertise the fact that Howard Stark had a hand in making the stuff," Tony said.
"God," he whispered as his fingers glided up the strong arms that held him close at night, across the broad, heaving chest that covered the biggest heart that Tony had ever seen, and down the textbook washboard abs that actually rippled beneath his fingertips to where his cock stood at attention, weeping slightly and simply begging for Tony's touch.
"Yeah, okay." Tony slammed down the receiver, hurrying back to Peter's room to find Howard sitting next to him on his bed, poking him in the ribs.
A loud knock on his door startled him, and he quickly slid on his glasses as he glanced up at the clock. It was nearly 2330, well past the curfew time, so—
"But neither of them are in the inner circle, buddy," Tony stated. "And you know how closely that inner circle guards itself. You get one of them in the wrong mood and they'll—"
“Fuck!” Steve cried into the dim light of their bedroom, his eyes squeezing closed as Tony increased his speed.  He was barely hanging by a thread.  “Tony, I can’t—!”
"Yep," Peter said with a nod.
"Steve?" Sam asked, startling Steve from his thoughts. "You still with me?"
"It was Mr Stacy that stopped it," Peter cut in, still coughing. His entire body was shaking, either from adrenaline or fear, he couldn't quite tell, and his mind was so foggy he was surprised he could still speak. "He came inside and distracted it just long enough for it to stop—"
Fear welled up inside Steve, overpowering his panic demon to take its place at the head of the pack. Tony was already working himself to the bone, not only with helping Bruce with the decryption of the Mongolian files, but also upgrading the defence drones that surrounded their homes, checking in with Pepper and his company from time to time, and keeping up with the team's equipment and uniforms at the same time as he was trying to get Beck's glasses technology altered so they could test it out on Bucky.
"Don't worry, I'm just passing through," Tony grumbled. "So you can go right back to doing whatever the hell it is that you do when—"
Peter chuckled. "Well, yeah I know—ahh, wait a sec. You're not? Why?"
“Actually,
“Sure thing,” Natasha says.  Then she leans closer, giving Steve a rather ominous smile.  “So… now that you’ve told me all about the kid, what about the dad, hmm?  Is he single?”
"From what we've seen," Steve agreed. "But if you're right, that would definitely tie our government in with HYDRA, and if it's true… that just opens a whole new can of worms."
"Far as I can tell, there's nothing," Uncle Sam said. "It's like they're just waiting for us to make a move or something. I can't imagine this'll be how this ends."
he screamed inside his head, even as his last shred of rationality knew that it had to be.  The fake mission, the booby traps, the groaning sound mimicking the sinking
Tossing another glare in Shostakov’s direction, Steve turns up the volume of his music and burrows down into his warm-up jacket until he can barely still see over the top of it.  Then he carefully rubs his palms up and down his arms, trying to keep them at least somewhat loose.  It’s a futile gesture and Steve knows it, but he can’t just sit there and let himself get all tensed up without trying to do something to stop it.
if he could do the experiment himself.
“That does appear to be the case, Master Peter,” answered JARVIS.  “Which I find extremely curious.”
Tony's jaw twitched as he reached for Peter's hand under the blankets, cradling it like a delicate piece of glass.
"Tony," he murmured, tipping his head back against the seat as a wave of dizziness washed over him. The adrenaline rush that he'd had directly following the accident was now in a massive nosedive, and the fact that he still couldn't see correctly wasn't helping. "Tony, I don't—I don't want Peter to see me like this. I'm—I don't—"
"Takeoff in three… two… one… mark!"
"He's alive!" Peter exclaimed, a huge smile breaking across his face. Uncle Bruce had told Dad and Papa that Thanos had killed Uncle Thor when he attacked their ship, but if Uncle Thor was still alive, then maybe that could be how they—
"Me too," said Peter. "Drive safe, okay?"
It seemed like an entire year passed as Tony stared up at Steve, his lower lip shaking. "Okay, honey," he finally whispered. "I won't."
"On Howard Stark?" asked Phillips, his eyebrows knitting together when Steve nodded. "Okay. Why?"
"Yeah, yeah, okay," Tony said. He swallowed hard, trying to keep his focus on the Hammer suits trying to kill him.
"Shh, baby, it's okay. I've got you," Tony murmured as he stroked him almost agonisingly slow. He crawled back up Steve's body, pressing their mouths together in a deep kiss. "I'm gonna suck you off now, yeah?" he whispered against Steve's lips. "That sound okay?"
"Holy shit," he managed as Steve finally released his spent cock, kissing his way back up Tony's body. Steve grinned as he pecked Tony first on the forehead, then on the tip of his nose, and finally his mouth, rolling them over and tucking Tony close, his head pillowed on Steve's chest.
Uncle Bucky must have warned Dad and Papa to stay away since the monster was attracted to metal. Or at least, non-Asgardian metal.
HYDRA was supposed to have died with the Red Skull.
"All right, then," said Papa. "As long as it's not too late, and there's some adult supervision."
Like Anthony and Peter Stark. No matter how hard Steve tried, he could not seem to purge either of them from his mind. Peter because he was the sweetest kid that Steve had ever seen in his life, and Anthony—well, aside from being exquisitely attractive, if how much Peter missed him was any indication, Steve couldn't imagine that Anthony could be anything less than amazing.
stopped by that place you told me about just before they closed for curfew, and I
"Yeah you are, kiddo, but it's okay," said Auntie Nat, elbowing Uncle Clint hard enough in the ribs to cause him to yelp. "There's no need to rush that stuff, you've got plenty of time."
"Hey, guys," Peter said, startling Steve so badly that he actually squeaked. Tony, of course, just took it in stride.
"Mmm. Semantics."
"Yes, but they haven't gotten any worse, which is good," answered Steve.
"Let me think about the tickets a bit more, okay, Sam?" he asked once Sam was done with the water fountain. "I'll need to talk to Tony about it, and—"
Tony thought, refusing to give in to the morbid thoughts that taunted him.
"Already on it, Captain."
Dad audibly gulped.  “When it came time to start assembling the pharmaceutical printers, I had JARVIS change over the assembly line for the rifles.  But before I did that, JARVIS told me that we had a bunch of extras just sitting around in the warehouse, and that it had been Obie who had ordered their assembly.”
"'Just' his papa?" Steve asked, quirking an eyebrow. "Well,
"Yep," he called over his shoulder. "See ya later."
"Mmm," Tony murmured, blinking his eyes open as Steve moved to get off the bed. His fingers curled around Steve's wrist, holding him in place. "Where d'ya think you're going, hot stuff?"
“Or maybe ‘cause he realised that diversifying is actually a good thing—”
Steve’s jaw twitched as he looked down at their joined hands, his gorgeous blue eyes clearer than they had been in weeks.
"Probably," Bucky answered. "And they kinda look like the ones in Star Wars too, don't ya think? We'll have to tell Петр all about 'em once he comes back."
Where he always knew he was
Unfortunately, it wasn't to be the case. Owing in large part to their teacher's desire to not only have one student dominate the conversation, soon after Gwen stopped talking, Peter felt his anxiety level start to tick back up, hovering at its usual position somewhere between Defcon three and four. It lasted all through the rest of their classes and into Decathlon practise, where Gwen kept them all hopping with her lightning round questions.
Literally everything was depending on it.
"Well, yeah," said Clint. "But still. I've kinda gotten attached to these."
"I want everything," Steve breathed as he drew Tony impossibly closer. "I want to do everything with you. I—I love you, and I want you, and—"
"Yeah, yeah," muttered Peter as Dad backed out of the driveway and drove away, wondering how in the world he was going to be able to deal with an extra-anxious Papa for the next four hours.
But that didn't mean that the attempt had been completely successful, especially since Papa had thought it necessary to give Peter the very same lecture about teamwork that he'd given him before his first Avengers' training session, but then told him that he would no longer be allowed to train with the team until he and Dad thought Peter was ready again. And, when Peter asked when that might be, he said that they would just have to see.
"Here, bud," Dad said as he tore out the pages of code, handing the notebook back to him. "You get some sleep now, yeah? I'll bring you another notebook next time we come."
"I said,
"No, and I've given up on trying to explain them to him," Peter answered. "He mainly just likes watching all the fights."
Tears stung Tony's scratchy eyes, and he turned away, pressing his fist to his chest. "Yeah, well, unfortunately concern's not gonna fix my son's heart now, is it. Not unless something miraculous happens."
Steve had just turned to leave when Scott spoke up again. "Ah, Captain?"
"I believe that I asked you about the Stark family, did I not?" asked the general.
And that was something Tony was not prepared to allow.
"You're exhausted, sweetheart," Steve said softly. "And to be honest, so am I. I'm wondering if we shouldn't go back home and try and take a nap before you and Bruce get started."
Steve trailed his palms up and down Tony's back as they rode up to the paediatric floor, his lips brushing across the soft skin of Tony's neck. Tony had spoken less than three words since Colonel Phillips's bombshell announcement, but Steve could hear his thoughts as if they were being broadcasted country-wide, draping yet another leaden veil of guilt across Steve's shoulders. After Howard's announcement that he was prepared to administer the only remaining dose of the Project Rebirth serum to Peter, he had also informed Steve and Tony that the reason for Peter's sudden downhill spiral was because he was the person responsible for reconstructing JARVIS.
"No, don't think so," Peter said, shaking his head. "Both of my dads have gone through 'em before, and they're fine."
"Mr Stark, new evidence has recently been unearthed from the wreckage at the destroyed power plant, and if you don't mind, we'd like to ask you a few questions," said the officer. He stepped back, holding out his arm. "If you would come with us, please—"
"Oh, he was," said Bucky. "And more than a bit smug, if I do say so." He shook his head at Steve's quizzical look. "It's just an inside joke, no big deal."
"Yes, I suppose," answered JARVIS. "But it is already way past your bedtime, Master Peter."
"I didn't know who he was then, Tony," said Steve. "I never learned the last names of the kids that I visited with, it's against hospital policy. I just knew him as Peter."
Anthony Stark would risk entrusting his young child with something that if discovered, would surely get him either fired or arrested. Or both.
“Tony—”
Tony's frown grew even deeper. "I know that, Steve. But just 'cause your body
"Now, Peter," ordered Steve, softening his words with a gentle hand on his son's shoulder. "Please."
"And then Mr Pym helped you escape from jail?"
"Okay, so… what was different?" asked Sam. "'Cause I have a feeling that's what's throwing you off here."
Just like his sweet son had vanished.
"Oh, thank you so much," Pepper said as she slumped back in her chair. "I'll have Happy bring them up tonight actually, I'd like if they could be completed as soon as possible. There are a few project leaders who like to drag their feet with reviews, and then we wind up reviewing work that was done over six months ago, and, well, like I said, that's just not acceptable."
"But—but—" Steve sputtered, his heart slamming against his ribcage as he came to the realisation that Gamora had to have been anticipating seeing Peter Quill emerge from the circle, which could only mean that this universe had experienced the snap, just like theirs did. And that many of the people still emerging from the portals onto the battlefield had been victims of it.
"I just released mine, Control," said Steve. "Continuing in the standard orbit."
"Absolutely not," Steve said in his Captain's voice, glaring at Tony for even daring to suggest such a thing. "Tony, I won't allow Thanos to get his hands on that stone, and that's all there is to it!"
"Steve, you don't have to replace your alarm clock just because of me," Tony said. "It's not that big of a deal."
"C'mon, honey, please?" he said as his lips brushed across Steve's temple. "I know you come from the time when men weren't supposed to ask for help with stuff like that, but I thought you knew better than that by now. I'm your husband, damnit. It's not like I haven't seen it before."
"Shall we, sweetheart?"
on board with getting naked with you right now. But honey… even mind-blowing sex won't get rid of the problem. It'll just… kinda mask it for awhile."
"Yeah, well, don't thank me, little guy," said Steve. "I'm pretty sure this was one of yours and Dad's algorithms."
"Steve, I honestly don't know," said Sam. "The stones, that goofy HYDRA drug you guys all got, who knows? Probably some combination of all of it."
"Those odds are not good," said Drax.
"Ah, sure," Steve answered. He grabbed two bottles of Powerade from the newsstand set up in the lobby, exchanging pleasantries with the elderly Korean War vet who ran it while he paid. Tony had set up an ongoing weekly donation to the newsstand that Steve knew more than covered the cost of he and Sam's daily Powerade bottles, but Steve wasn't about to use that as an excuse.
"Finally!" Bucky said as he dropped his arm holding the handlamp. "My arm wasn't gonna last much longer!"
The only question was
“Pete… what…?” he stammered as he scrambled around in the glove compartment for a pair of sunglasses.  After unfolding them with his teeth, he then proceeded to poke himself in the eye as he went to put them on, nearly causing him to rear-end a taxicab that was attempting to make an illegal left turn into an alley.
Howard's head snapped back as if Tony had slapped him, his eyes wild. "I never meant to hurt the boy, Tony! I would never do such a thing on purpose, so—"
"Uhh… J?" he finally asked through clenched teeth. "Are we—are we good here?"
"Oh, of course, Colonel," said Thor, clearing his throat. "Mind you, I will be relaying the story as it was told to me hundreds of years ago. By my mother."
"I'm just kidding, Steve!" Bucky said. "C'mon, you know me better than that."
It was completely awesome, and Peter had a strong feeling that he’d just discovered his new favourite bookstore.
Bruce frowned as he tapped the keyboard, displaying a file written in Russian that JARVIS quickly translated. "This is the initial list of names that we found at the Mongolian bunker. The first name is Donald Gill, the second Morris Bench, the third Mark Raxton—"
“I know.  I know you will.”
Peter thought as his mind quickly calculated Dr Strange's odds of their success, which were a measly 0.00001429%.
that would be somehow even more terrible than what they'd been through already, and he would end up losing one or both of his beloved boys. There had already been way too many times where he'd come too close for comfort.

A boisterous pounding on the front door followed by a loud, "Oi!" prevented Tony from saying anything else, and he gently set Peter's hand down at his side.
thought of going on a vacation?
"Steve… baby, please move," Tony whimpered as he wiggled his hips, pulling a strangled gasp from Steve's throat. He was so full that he felt as though he might split in two, but yet he also felt
"You feeling any better now?"
"Y, E, S," Tony muttered as he typed it into the keyboard, blinking as the screen flickered three times before going completely blank.
"And after you walk me to my seat, you'll continue on up the centre of the aisle while Steven and Tony enter in from their opposite sides," Grandma said as she helped Peter tighten the knot on his tie. "Then all three of you will be up there together while your dads say their vows."
He had just climbed into the backseat of Sam's car when his phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out, dread washing over him like a wave as he read Tony's text, accompanied by a link to a breaking news headline.
