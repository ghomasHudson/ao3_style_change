John jokes as he wipes Sherlock clean, throwing the flannel in the general direction of the bathroom. “Get under the covers, I think we’ve both earned a good night’s sleep.”
"Here, let me do it. Really John, the amount of time you spend licking your lips I would have thought you'd have been able to get a small spot of sauce."
“I’m not sure your bank account could.”  Sherlock pouts, eyeing the way John’s fingers caress the chair with jealousy.  “It is ridiculously expensive to travel First Class, the ‘complimentary’ food and service are far from free, the cost being built into the ticket price.”  He drags his eyes away from John’s nimble hands.  “I don’t see why we couldn’t have used one of Mycroft’s cars.  After all, we are doing this for him.”
Sherlock grips John’s hand more tightly. “She can sometimes engage my mind but she has never managed to engage my mind
Sherlock gradually became aware of the sound of John giggling, the sound was like a caress, familiar, reassuring and totally intoxicating. Before meeting John, Sherlock would have felt a mixture of mortification and confusion at being laughed at, but his enforced time away from John had compelled him to rethink his sense of self. With it had come the realisation that before John he had been a desperately lonely man, in complete denial of his emotions, in a constant battle to keep them locked away as unnecessary and damaging.  He had wrapped himself up in layers of coldness and distance to keep himself from being hurt or ridiculed, but John had gradually unwrapped him.  Made him see that his idea of self had been unnecessary and idiotic and, with John at least, he allowed more of his true self to show. Now he knew that the warm giggling he could hear was a sign of trust, familiarity and affection - almost everything he could ever wish for from John. He felt his own laugh rumbling in his chest before it mingled with John's, deep baritone and light giggling, their combined sounds beautiful and comforting.
I also have a challenging project I want to tackle, very angsty but I'm sure you know my work well enough to guess how it will end!
Sherlock bears his teeth in response but says nothing, his defiance angering Mary.  She walks calmly forward before striking Sherlock with a closed fist, splitting his lip and wrenching his head to the side, prompting him to speak.
John halts any further words by thoroughly kissing Sherlock. Part of John wishes this was a technique he could use to effectively silence Sherlock when he is being the obnoxious twat that he can so often be, but acknowledges that kissing someone until they submit is not a mature, or healthy, coping mechanism.  Instead, John enjoys the feel of a very naked Sherlock beneath him and deepens the kiss further; it is just edging towards something more when there is a knock at their room door.  John breaks their kiss with a groan and a muttered ‘timing’, rolling off Sherlock and taking a few deep breaths.
"The name of the group." Anderson answers, a light flush on his cheeks. "Because, well, the hearse was empty, wasn't it?"  He pauses, waiting for confirmation, when none is forthcoming he continues with his narrative.  "They agreed with what I'd seen, that it was Sherlock solving the crimes and that he was on his way back home.  I remember Helen, or whatever her name was, studied the map quite intently, more so than anyone else.  After that meeting she didn't come for quite a while, maybe a month, six weeks? And from then on, only every few weeks.  I know she definitely wasn't there when we received the news that Sherlock was alive."
"Ok Sherlock. For now I won't push, but you WILL  tell me. Just tell me if I ....... " His words broke off and once again pain washed over his face.
“Maybe they’re just people holidaying here?  People Mycroft thought might be of interest?”  John answers off-handedly.  A little too off-handedly.
John doesn't wait to discover what Sherlock 'shall' do, cutting him off mid-sentence by the simple expedient of taking him back into his mouth. Sherlock stifles a cry, the sound coming out more like a squawk. John slides his mouth down further, taking in more of Sherlock's cock before applying light suction and moving back to the tip, before sliding off completely.
“John? Can you lean your head a little to the right for me? I’m going to change the dressing on your head and see how are you are healing.”
Hello! It's me! I'm so sorry for the huge delay, life has been a very interruptive pain in the backside lately and although I could visualise this chapter perfectly I just couldn't shake the words from my brain on to the page!
“You are more than welcome.”  Sherlock answers, surprising himself at how husky his voice sounds.  He watches with delight as John’s pupils’ dilate. “I thought it would add credibility to the story behind why we are here.”
Sherlock? But of course, Sherlock was not his. He would never understand emotions - especially not John's. Especially not when it came to love. John's insides twisted at the word and his pulse quickened. He couldn't read the expression on Sherlock's face, but it wasn't regret, John could tell.
He paced the room as worriedly as he could, with a limp. This was not good. Very, very, very, not good. John felt sweat breaking out on his forehead. Had he really just slept on the couch with Sherlock Holmes? Under a
It didn't work that way. Nevertheless, Sherlock could hear the guilt in his voice when he next spoke.
Sherlock swallowed, and Molly stepped away nervously. Emotions bubbled very near to the surface inside of John - what was Molly doing with
Not wanting to go into such places, John quickened his pace slightly. "Nevermind, I'm getting tired. I say we make straight for home..." Sherlock absentmindedly listened to John's voice, like a pillow - warm and familiar, creating a comfortable buzz in the background. It wasn't until a shrill sound pierced the night that John stopped speaking.
The shorter man's body was tucked deep under Sherlock's arm, nestled into the warmth of both Sherlock and the couch. It took another moment for Sherlock to register the fact that John was lying with him, on the couch, tucked under a blanket.
The stage lights are up and John doesn’t see him. Lestrade gives John permission to go ahead and Sherlock holds his breathe.
It’s the steam that keeps him coming back. It relaxes Sherlock’s muscles. His shoulders go tense after a long day, his biceps and triceps ache, and muscles of his hands and fingers twinge with every movement. The steam in the sauna seeps into his skin and washes away all that pain.
John was familiar with witches. He’d seen things in the field and on the march he could not explain. Some evil, but most benign. That still did not mean he shouldn’t be cautious. He rested his palm over his sword hilt.
He can’t manipulate this the way he wants, he can’t pour his feelings into this slow, comfortable kiss the way he would like, but John keeps kissing him. Keeps moving his mouth across Sherlock’s lips. He dips his tongue inside.
), Victor rests his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and bends to press their lips together. Sherlock lets his eyes fall shut and anticipates the burst of colour he’ll see when he opens them again. The kiss is dry and warm and lingering. It feels nice and comforting. Like coming home, if Sherlock had ever taken comfort in such a thing.
‘John’ is watching him when Sherlock looks up. He keeps ‘John’s’ gaze as he trails his hand down again and wraps his palm around his cock. The humidity in the room gives enough constant moisture to let the skin slide smoothly.
Victor pulls back even farther and Sherlock wants to grab at him, tell him to try again, maybe the colours just need some time to come back after being gone for so long. He doesn’t. His hands stay folded neatly in his lap.
“There are worse things than not finding your soulmate, Sherlock. You can find them and only get some of your colours back. Just regain the muted shades of childhood instead of the vibrant spectrum adults are supposed to see. They used to say that’s what happened to cold and heartless children, to those that saw only shades of blue or green. That even a soulmate wasn’t enough for them to see all the colours the world has to offer.” Mycroft rises from the table, the scrape of his chair against the floor echoing in the large and nearly empty dining room. “Remember what colours you could see, Sherlock.”
He can’t breath. It feels as if his ribs have been ripped away from his sternum, like he’s bleeding out into the sand- no, it’s concrete. It’s the pavement on the London street - not sand. But that’s what he sees when he looks down. And the ground is not nearly as far away as he thought it should be.
Sherlock took his hand and made it nearly to the balcony door before he cried out. “Oh! We can’t go home yet. There’s a confessional I’ve been planning to commit sacrilege in.”
, John tells himself. If he’s not seeing colours again, at least the young women and men he’s trying with aren’t either. It would be terrible to be someone’s soulmate but for them not to be yours. It’s not common, but it happens.
There’s nothing else to say so Sherlock steps forward, cups the back of Rosie’s head in his palm, and presses a soft kiss to her forehead. It’s a ritual for them now. Sherlock always brushes his lips against her hair or her cheek before he leaves. She often leaves sticky kisses on his face when Mrs. Hudson or Molly take her out of 221b for an afternoon.
“How can I have a strong bond with someone I’ve never even spoken to?” The red thread of his button hole is the wrong shade. It looks like rust and Sherlock cannot bear it. He pulls the coat from in front of his face but stays curled against the seat.
Sherlock lets go. And he goes, and goes, and goes. He can hear John moan, fingers still pumping in and out, but it’s as if he’s very far away. Cotton blocks his ears and the sea rages in them. He comes long and hard.
Sherlock keeps himself as busy as he can. He doesn’t think about his soulmate on police cases or when he’s working with his slowly growing portfolio of private clients. It’s only when one of his black moods overtakes him that he thinks about the man who touched him, literally and figuratively, and then left him.
Instead of answering. Sherlock stepped away from the window overlooking Baker Street. He didn’t know where he was going, but standing in front of the window felt too exposed. He only made it a few steps before John’s look pinned him to a dead stop in front of the sofa. It was an awkward place to stand, not somewhere where Sherlock was usually both still and upright. It grated.
She fusses constantly. The moments when she’s not whining or clenching her little fists in a shockingly accurate imitation of her father are frustratingly brief. She’s feverish and uncomfortable and she’s making John’s life miserable.
Instead, he settles Rosie against his chest while the water runs from the tap in the kitchen. She sighs a little and presses her face against the cool fabric of his dressing gown. Good. He’d chosen the right dressing gown.
“I need an assistant! Oh! Wait. Wait a moment.” Sherlock turns his attention back to John, who has been watching the volley between the other two men with interest. “John, you’re a doctor. In fact, you’re an Army doctor.”
Sherlock swallows and forces down a breath. “I knew my soulmate touched me at Bart’s the night I came in but left quickly after. I never searched for you.” It seems important that Sherlock let John know that. That he wasn’t desperate or clingy, that he was happy to let John go if that’s what John wanted. “You worked there, you went into military service, and it’s likely the timeline would match up.” John has moved a few paces closer, or maybe Sherlock is the one who moved. He’s not quite sure. “And, I can feel it.”
His bed had been pushed from the wall and ended up halfway across the room with an impressive crack down the headboard. It will need to be replaced but the mattress is intact and Mrs. Hudson brought him clean sheets hours ago when he indicated he would stay at Baker Street.
“Hire this one. He’s loyal. You won’t lose him to another orchestra or a better paying day job. He’s pulling an Army pension so he can survive on what you’ll pay him.”
John brought his mouth to Sherlock’s. The kiss was sloppy, full of tongue and teeth, and John’s cock grew to full hardness where it was pressed against Sherlock’s matching bulge.
Between the two of them, they’ve cut off the blood flow to his right arm and it’s gone numb. But he doesn’t want to wake either of them.
He doesn’t know a lot about John Watson, but he knows what’s important. A coward is the farthest thing from what John Watson is. The air is warm between them, standing so close now that their breaths mingle together and Sherlock has to bend his neck to see John’s face.
Sherlock was only content to be still for a few moments. He pressed back against John’s cock then rocked forward into his hand. “You could get on with it, you know. The feast only lasts so long.”
Lestrade rubs a hand across his forehead in a way that means he is exasperated and tired and dangerously close to yelling. “Sherlock, you are a musical genius. You play beautifully. But you cannot be first chair. Molly is a fine first chair. She does more for section morale than you ever would. This isn’t the London Symphony; there’s more to who gets to be first chair than just who plays the best.”
He feels Victor pull away, opens his eyes, and...nothing. It’s the same dead, gray world it was before Victor kissed him. Victor’s face is an expression of shattered love and disappointment. Sherlock imagines he must look very much the same.
Mike responds but John can only focus on the sound of Sherlock’s voice practically talking over him.
John laid one more kiss on Sherlock’s skin before stepping back and tucking himself back into his breeches. Sherlock straightened and did the same. January was a terrible month to have your cock out in the out of doors.
Sherlock would skip them entirely if he didn’t think Lestrade would march the whole damn circus right into his sitting room.
John stands a little straighter, almost at parade rest if it weren’t for the slight lean into his cane. “Yes.”
“Damnit, Sherlock, that’s not what I meant and you- Look, I’m sorry I left you, it was a selfish thing to do. You should have had the opportunity to decide. We should have talked about this then, but I made the decision for us and I’m sorry about that. But it doesn’t look like you’ve suffered too badly because of the separation so just remember that, yeah?”
Rosie is like a lead weight on his chest when he wakes up. All her muscles have gone slack and she’s drooling on his shirt. John’s head is resting peacefully against his shoulder. When Sherlock looks down he can see the swirl of an identical cowlick on the crowns of both their heads. Rosie’s is a bit more off-center than John’s but it’s the same pattern.
Sherlock soaks for a few moments in one of cool water pools before finding his locker and redressing. The stranger never follows.
John rose to stand above him, chest heaving and cheeks stained pink. His hands clenched at his sides again, but this time there was no anger in it. Just lust and restraint.
John’s voice is quiet. Keeping quiet has become a habit around Baker Street in the dead of night, after Rosie has gone to bed; but Sherlock can’t be worried about her right now. The quiet feels like it’s for him alone. It makes him feel safe. If they don’t raise their voices, this interlude is some otherworldly event just between them. The darkness helps with that illusion too.
She comes to him willingly, burying her face in the side of his neck. She’s hot. Very hot. But John would have noticed if she were dangerously so. Sherlock’s stomach gives that treacherous knot-and-twist feeling again anyway.
There was one woman, Jeanette, during his second year of med school. He met her at a cafe, practically dumped his coffee on her in the morning rush hour crowd. Jeanette didn’t hold out hope for a soulmate either so they didn’t wait long to touch skin to skin. John appreciated that Jeanette didn’t put a lot of ceremony to it like some people. She just kissed him. They saw sparks but no colours, as the saying goes.
Sherlock looks up and finally locks eyes with John. The room is utterly still and quiet. John’s eyes are the blue of the deep ocean. Sherlock’s never seen the ocean at that depth but he knows it would feel like drowning. He feels like he’s drowning now.
. It’s a novel choice for an audition for a classical orchestra. It’s tight and crisp and, even without the trumpets, still clearly rings of the 1940s. John plays well and Sherlock feels a knot unfurl in his chest. He really didn’t want to hate the man’s music.
“Go. We’ll be here when you get back. Call if you need a consult.” John’s smile is tight and Rosie wiggles against his hip. Even she’s unhappy and she doesn’t understand what’s going on.
strumming in John’s blood as he watches the woman bat her eyelashes at him. It’s more repulsive than Sherlock’s dismissive manners but he can’t bring himself to care. They are finally in the same room together and everything feels
“I’m missing something, John.  I thought so last night too but I thought that was because of you; because of the feelings we had both been hiding.”  Sherlock rests his hand over John’s, silently reassuring him that he isn’t upset for being unknowingly misled. “But I was wrong.  These people are all wrong.  The setting is all wrong.  The answer is right in front of me but I can’t see it!”
Heartfelt thanks, as always, to all of you who read this! Writing this makes me feel extremely happy, hearing that you have enjoyed it too fills with me such joy I'm overflowing!
“Have….”  John clears his throat, scratches his eyebrow again before continuing.  “Have you ever felt strongly about someone, Sherlock.  Been …. attracted to someone?’
John chuckled before sucking at Sherlock's neck, marking him, making him his. Sherlock tilted his head back further, indicating that John should continue. Eagerly John left more love bites, aware that he was behaving like a teenager and honestly not giving a flying fuck! Finally John moved his body lower, trailing kisses over the toned chest beneath him.
“But that’s just wrapping it all up in a different lie!” John protests, standing from the bed and pacing.
Sherlock flicks open the uppermost button on John's shirt and relishes the feel of smooth, soft skin. He can see that John's eyes have fluttered shut and that his lips are parted. He longs to kiss that flushed face but continues with his fantasy.
Long moments pass and John can feel Sherlock starting to pull himself together, he sits back on his knees, studying Sherlock's face carefully for any sign of distress before resuming his seat on the edge of the coffee table.
John swallows, frowning as he tries to think over the last few weeks with Mary. “Is she even pregnant?
"What on earth for, Sherlock?" John's voice matches the whispered tones of Sherlock's. He ducks his head lower, bringing it down to the same level as Sherlock's. He looks into Sherlock's eyes and Sherlock can read compassion there. "It means a lot that you trust me enough to open up to me like this. Obviously, you needed to talk about it too. Please don't apologise for showing you care."
“John?” Sherlock calls urgently, his grip on John’s hand remains light despite Sherlock’s growing excitement. “I need you to wake up. Please John, wake up.” Sherlock’s focus remains intent on John’s face, eagerly chasing signs of emerging consciousness. “Wake up for me.”
“No.”  He attempts to reassure Lestrade.  “The operation went well, it was a success.  They were able to completely remove the haematoma.”
John just has time to acknowledge this before he is once again being manhandled in the most delightful way.
“That’s it? That’s all the mighty Mycroft Holmes was able to ascertain?”  Sherlock mocks, fear once again overpowering reason. Fleetingly he chastises himself for still being unable to deal with his fear.  He has felt it so many times in the last few years that surely it should feel more like an old friend by now? Something he can greet with equanimity?
"John!" His name is a bitten off gasp and he glories in the feel of slick, hot skin against his. They are rocking together more desperately now, pre-come dampens the front of John's boxers. He is utterly aroused but in awe of the care that Sherlock is taking of him. He feels loved, cherished, surrounded by the man who has saved his life, in so many ways, time and time again; he only hopes that he is making Sherlock aware of his love and devotion too. The pace quickens and Sherlock groans, sliding his long fingers into John's short hair. He tilts John's face up and meets his gaze, their rocking continuing.
“Yeah, he did; but I never felt like I wanted it to go any further; for it to be more than his fingers.”
“Yes, I’m aware.”  She smiles coldly.  “And right now I’m leaving.  He has no idea I am here.  I don't believe he is aware of anything beyond the inside of his eyelids; so I'm going home and putting my feet up.”  She rests a hand on her belly, the significance of the gesture does not go unrecognised by Sherlock.  “I need my rest.”
Mr Rajkoomar glances between, noting the obvious bad feelings, aware that this level of animosity may affect his patient’s recovery, before continuing on to a private sitting room.
The movement of his hands draws Sherlock gaze and John slows the action, watching from the corner of his eye.
"No."  Sherlock quirks an eyebrow at John's sudden command but lowers his hands accordingly, resting them lightly on the duvet.  "I want to undress you."  John crawls slowly onto the bed and over Sherlock's body, keeping his weight off him.   He knows he is nowhere near as attractive as Sherlock, but the way Sherlock is gazing at him makes him feel sexy and desirable.  John lowers his face slightly, gracing the plush lips with light kisses before moving his attention onto the long column of Sherlock's neck. The skin is soft beneath John's lips, the stubble making his skin tingle.  He glides his lips back up to Sherlock's jaw, gently nipping at the rounded edge.  Each caress draws a moan from Sherlock and he grasps for John, gripping his neck and waist, anchoring him. John can feel the rapid rise and fall of Sherlock's chest, the heat of his skin, the moist kiss of sweat in his hair and John can't believe that he wrought this effect on Sherlock, that he has finally broken through all the carefully constructed barriers and has been allowed access to the man inside. He nips gently at Sherlock's earlobe before fluttering a light kiss on Sherlock's lips.
Sherlock’s jaw drops in outrage. Why bother to bring him the piece before the rest of the orchestra if he had no say in whether or not they played it? “Un-announce it.”
John’s fingers stilled. He crooked them inside Sherlock until he found that sweet spot that made Sherlock’s knees shake.
Winding his horse through the streets of Paris was always a trial, but during the Feast of Fools it was a nightmare. Strangers jostled him without a care. They stepped directly in front of his horse as if the war-seasoned beast wouldn’t run them down. The noise and crowds and the smell were overwhelming.
The conversation is not over, Sherlock knows that. It’s just temporarily stalled. If he’s honest with himself, what was said in the car today is just a continuation of the conversation at his hospital bedside from years before.
As John moves, so does Sherlock. The stroke together, up and down, in a slowly building rhythm. Their knuckles rub together as they shift and inch closer together. Sherlock’s hips rock up into John’s grip and the sheet sticks to him in a growing, sweaty mess.
that the great consulting detective was feeling. She could see it in Sherlock's tight lips, his eyes shut tight with desperation, his eyebrows knitted into passion. This was not for Molly. This was to quench Sherlock's thirst for something he felt he couldn't have.
Baker Street was an immensely quiet place - Mrs. Hudson was likely asleep in her room. Sherlock heaved himself up the steps, John in his arms. No matter the strain on his hand, Sherlock felt nothing but passion.
"Stocky man? Sandy hair? Likely walking with a link?" Sherlock's patience was quickly running thin. "
A line, someplace deep inside John, snapped. He wheeled around, the man so close now he only needed to take two steps closer to reach him. He aimed a fist at the man's face and
John glanced back at Lestrade, who took a step back, frightened. There was a fierce fire, stronger than the one raging on in the building, in John's eyes. He was desperate. For an answer.
"John!" Sherlock's voice warned. "Just let it go!" Sherlock couldn't help it - he was tired and bored and wanted to go home and didn't give rubbish about people cat-calling him on the streets. John turned to glare at him for a fraction of a second. In that ounce of time alone, the slick-haired man reached into his pocket, unsheathing a small pocket knife. He dug it into John's side twice, ignoring his strangled yells. He had the change to drive it into his shoulder once before Sherlock realized what was happening.
John blinked a few times, adjusting to the bright light. The arm around him did not feel unfamiliar to him. It felt... right. Normal. Not one of a strangers. He peered at it - whoever was wrapped around him was wearing a brown button down. One that looked mighty like something Sherlock would wear... John's eyes followed the shirt from the elbow to the hand. Long, pale, veined fingers that were tucked over him like a tight embrace. It took another moment or two for John to realize that it was Sherlock's body that had him wrapped up like a cacoon.
He attempted to limp back to the burning building, but already a pair of hands had his shoulders, pulling him back. Was it Lestrade? John didn't turn to find out - instead he kept pushing forward, trying to get back to the pile of rubble that was once a warehouse.
His mind played out a sequence in which he vanquished whatever enemy was attempting to slay Sherlock, and the gratitude from the consulting detective. Soon enough, his eyes began to close and each sequence in his head played like a foggy dream. Eventually John lay on the couch, snuggled into Sherlock's chest, their blanket draped over them. Sometime later, when John was deep into slumber, Sherlocks arm draped over his side, shielding him from anything but Sherlock's touch.
In John's mind, foggy images of the previous night danced before his eyes. Seeing Sherlock kiss Molly and end it with an evil grin shook John's entire body, and Sherlocks arm drew tighter over his body. It was then, when he felt the tug of someone elses arm around his, did he open his eyes. Maybe he was missing a piece from the night. Had he met a girl? And yet, when his eyes did open, the room looked quite familiar to him. It looked a lot like... John could practically hear a pin drop when he realized it was Sherlock's room. Maybe he had brought a girl home and picked the wrong room?
John looked up at Sherlock, his expression not changing once. Was it anger? Sherlock couldn't quite put his finger on it. Yet John stood, clutching Sherlock's arm like a lifeline. All of a sudden he leapt at Sherlock, sealing the consulting detective in a tight embrace.
"N-no... I'm fine, I'm fine, Sherlock, just leave me be..." John hadn't meant to sound harsh at all, really, but to his ears it sounded like a bit of yelling had escaped into his voice. Sherlock, on the other hand, only heard the nervous squeak on his name. Did the whole... couch incident really bother John so much? Or was he the one being weird? Immediately a feeling in his stomach lurch and he felt something pass through him. Something warm.
So there they were - one short, and one tall, walking down the autumn sidewalk, the night sky completely demolished by the clouds. Possibly the two would have arrived home and slept in their beds in silence if Sherlock had not turned abruptly right, turning down a more run-down street with a few cruddy bars.
"John, get back, now!" Lestrade was on his feet now, making his way towards the short doctor. "John, Sherlock, he was... he was in there, but get back, I'm sure... it's... I called the Yard! Damnit, John,
An hour or so later, Sherlock's mind chose sleep after a hectic night. Another hour of slumber and Sherlock was cocooned in the blanket, with John's chest pressed up against his own. The last thing Sherlock could remember thinking - or doing, more like - was planting a light kiss onto John's lips, and John kissing right back.
"Where's Sherlock?" John gasped again, doing all that he could to maintain his breathing. Lestrade glanced quickly at the building then back at John, opening his mouth to speak. Yet there was no time for words. Three loud ticks and the building before Lestrade and John blew up, blasting the two of them backwards onto the pavement.
John's voice screeched into the night, the level of desperation and care and fear and panic underestimated by none. He was pulled back harder, until he fell to his knees, terrified. John wheeled around to face Lestrade, the paramedics, whoever was trying to fix the problem - and found the one face he wasn't expecting to find.
The smaller pair of ruddy sneakers that walked alongside, though, could not stop sneaking glances at the man in the dress shoes. He black hair sat perfectly on his head and, in the late night air, his breath came out in perfect wisps. His mind was eons away, but focused on other, more human things.
"I...I... I've got to go..." John swiveled around, leaving the dropped mug to Sherlock and Molly - the latter of which had not stepped back to face Sherlock with brave eyes.
"Why, Sherlock?" She whispered. "Why do you do this? Toy with him like that? Don't you see? Aren't you able to read emotions? Can't you tell that he - that I, that all of us - we all care for you? Don't you know that you're supposed to care back?" She swallowed, trying to calm her shaking and remain stable. "It's not like you don't care for him, too. I can see the way you look at him. The way your eyes crinkle when you smile at him. I can feel feel your pulse right now - you love him, Sherlock. And you just... break him into pieces like this!" Molly's voice caught, and she sat back down in her chair, turning away from Sherlock. Molly Hooper stared determinedly forward until she heard Sherlock whisk out the door.
What time must it be? 11? 12? Early morning already? John did not know, but his eyelids drooped and he let out a sigh. He watching a slideshow of Sherlock play before his eyes, like a tauntingly gorgeous film. Soon enough his eyelids drooped entirely and he was out.
Something Sherlock Holmes had only felt for family. Is that what John was then? Family? Either way, Sherlock did not want to leave his side. Not now, not ever again. Sherlock slid John onto his own bed, burying him in the Sherlock-scented comforter. Sherlock slid onto the bed, above the blankets, a moment later, not sure if this was wrong or right or whether he want to sleep or watch over John forever.
John gets all defensive-ey of Sherlock. ;) Just goes to show how much we'd do for people we care about.
A long, shrill wolf whistle echoed from behind the pair. John twisted around the see a middle-aged, sharply dressed men, slowly trailing the two.
I was a hundred words from being done with this one when I clicked out of the box, hit backspace, and lost it all. Normally I'd move on but I quite loved this one.... so, in other words, comments/kudos would be immensely appreciated, this took a long while.
He shot off the couch, noting that John must be out as his coat and shoes were both absent, and slid from his pajamas into trousers and a button down. He needed someone. And if he couldn't have... John, and if John wasn't there, Sherlock knew someone who always was.
He took a moment to consider this logically. Possibly it could be a prank? Not likely from John, he wasn't exactly the type for pranks... could it have been Mrs. Hudson? Again, far too innocent of a suspect. Had Gavin... no, Greg put him up to this? Lestrade, yes, it must have been... and still, Sherlock felt that his logic was a tad unnecessary. What if it wasn't a prank at all?
If they didn't wake after another hour or so, Mrs. Hudson would knock on each door to find the rooms empty. Sherlock would be out on a case, and John would be well in tow. She'd first climb up the steps to John's room, finding it empty, and walk back downstairs. She'd move to Sherlock's room, open up, and find it, too, to be empty.
But of course, this was not a usual morning in Baker Street. The boys had not woken after Mrs. Hudson had waited, and she climbed up to John's room. Empty. From there it was rather safe to assume Sherlock, too, would be out - the pair nearly always left the house together. Mrs. Hudson walked back downstairs, knocked a quiet knock on Sherlock's room, and opened it up, assuming the bed would be made and empty and she'd go back to drinking her tea.
"Uh, h-hullo, Sherlock. How's-" But Molly could speak no more. Sherlock strolled forward, lifting Molly up from her seat, breathing in her scent, and falling into her with a kiss. While it was quite nice, and Molly's heart began to beat rather fast, she knew what this was. This wasn't
John doesn’t acknowledge that, except that the fingers of his left hand tighten into a fist at his side.
He doesn’t remember it, not exactly, but it’s like he knows. Like it’s burned into him somehow, that moment when his soulmate first touched him.
John’s hand is still warm around his wrist. Not pulling or insisting, but just sitting there. Waiting. “I’m glad it stayed an ‘adequate substitute’ and the novelty didn’t wear off then.”
“Ready to call it a night?” John’s already dusting his hands off on his trousers. He was more tired than Sherlock calculated.
Minstrels and hawkers and pickpockets flowed around him and John felt like he was finally able to breathe. He left his horse stabled at a tavern on the edge of the worst of the celebration. He’d come back for the horse later. He wanted to walk the streets and feel Paris beneath his feet.
“Yes, it’s amazing.” John’s words were strained and breathless. He took a small step forward but Sherlock moved again, forcing John back against the balustrade to keep their bodies from touching.
“Good. Yeah, that’s good.” John reaches out and Sherlock lets him wrap a hand around his wrist, but refuses to move forward again. Sherlock braces himself for some great reaction, some explosion, when John touches his skin but that time has passed. Sherlock missed it and now is met with just the warmth and comfort of John’s palm.
That’s not true though. The night sky is a deep navy, sometimes cobalt and sometime a deep purple, but never just the monochromatic black that limited his vision for years. The stars themselves twinkle and John swears he can see shades of pink and turquoise in their lights.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, doesn’t bring it to the attention of his medical staff, until Mycroft appears. It’s too good a jab to keep to himself. Mycroft had found his soulmate just after uni. Claire is strong and fierce and, on the whole, Sherlock likes her much better than he likes Mycroft. They make a good team but Sherlock can tell they each feel burdened, weighed down, by the other. Like they value what they have built together but wonder what they could have done on their own.
Lestrade doesn’t interrupt his rant. So he continues, pouring out all his boredom and frustration onto Lestrade and his terrible decisions managing and conducting his orchestra. He keeps going until he feels wrung out and collapses on the sofa with his dressing gown pulled tight around his torso.
Sherlock barely got a hand around his cock before he was crying out, shouting so loudly that surely even the revellers below stopped to listen. John imagined his come splattering against the stone at their feet and against the balustrade.
Just the shallow movement of rocking his hips again makes pleasure spark in Sherlock’s balls. He’s closer than he thought. He wraps his hand around John’s shoulder for leverage. “Just stay like that.”
John doesn’t have to look up to know Stamford, always a believer in happily ever after, is frowning at him. “You don’t even know him.”
Sherlock’s gut twists when Rosie turns her red, blotchy face to him. Not being able to comfort your own daughter would be even more difficult than sending strangers away uncured.
The leather of the seat creaks as Mycroft leans toward Sherlock. “I will tell you everything I know about the man. I will forward you the information I’ve collected. But you have to want to know.”
When the door swings open and John sees him sitting there, pipette in hand and this time in a smart suit instead of vomit crusted denims and a faded t-shirt, his heart stops. Sherlock is obviously older, his hair is longer, and he looks like he might be approaching a healthy weight but just barely. John’s legs carry him forward, practically flinching away from Mike’s knowing smirk. Sherlock glances at him but doesn’t seem to recognize him.
But that’s good. That’s exactly what he wanted. A place so foreign, so different, that he wouldn’t be able to spend too much time thinking of eyes the same blue-grey colour as the dreary London sky, clouds and all. Sometimes he still does a double take when he sees a young civilian who has let his inky black curls grow out to be nearly the same disheveled length as Sherlock Holmes’s. That’s only before his mind can register the subtle, no more than two shades difference between the hair of the man he left unconscious in a bed back in London and anyone he might meet in the desert. He’s always left a little relieved and a little disappointed.
Sherlock looks up and their eyes meet for just a moment; those eyes are the same clear, icy blue John has dreamt of night after night. They focus on him and John feels laid bare.
The brow smoothes out and a look of astonishment comes over the detective’s face. For the first time, he lowers himself into the plastic chair by Sherlock’s bedside. “How did you know that?”
He stretches his long legs out in front of himself, and his toes bump against another man’s ankle. Sherlock nearly pulls back, not wanting to invite outside attention tonight, but then he looks.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow but did as he was told. He grasped the stone railing and bent to present his arse as a prize.
Sherlock gets a warning in the form of a tightened grasp on the back of his head and a stuttering breath. The stranger tries to pull back, to pull out, and Sherlock assumes it’s only out of politeness. That’s unnecessary. Sherlock pushes his palms flat against the man’s hips, holding him in place and swallows down as much of his cock as he can without drowning. There’s a soft exhalation of “Christ” above him as the man shoots across his tongue and down his throat.
John’s mouth was dry. Sherlock was close enough that he could reach out and grab him by the hips or crush their mouths together.
Sherlock rocks back to bring his ass in closer contact with John’s groin. The hardness of John’s cock against his bottom isn’t exactly a surprise. Sherlock has been feeling it grow against him through most of this encounter. When they first shifted into this position, John had been politely trying to angle himself away but as their kisses grew more heated that politeness faded away. John had let them touch but he didn’t push, or thrust, or grind. Sherlock is sure he wouldn’t have had the same self-control if their positions were reversed. He pushes back harder and John groans. He doesn’t have the same self-control anyway.
the ambiance are what kept him coming back. Public saunas and baths without a ridiculous membership fee are hard to find, and everyone here is discreet. The baths attract mostly men who are athletic which, if Sherlock were in a mood to seek intimate company, is exactly what he would look for. They also tend to be far enough from his own social and professional circle that his privacy is virtually guaranteed.
That startled a genuine laugh from Sherlock. That’s his John. The only one that can surprise him. That’s why he had to do this.
Their shared chemistry lecture is long over and Victor is preparing to graduate and move on. He’s doing the washing up after convincing Sherlock to eat just a little bit of his grandmother’s famous curry chicken (
“You are a child.” Mycroft’s voice is hard when he finally breaks the chilly silence. “You have no idea what you’re talking about. You think you prefer to be alone simply because you’ve had no other option presented to you. But now you have the option. Even if you don’t know who it is, you will long for him. You will want to call out to him, to find him, and you will be unable to do so. It will drive you mad.”
His dark brown hair is going grey, not just at the temples as one might expect, but sort of all over at once. His suit is a light grey, his shirt white but not bright enough to stand out, his tie a dull shade of navy blue. Everything about this man says he’s trying to fade into the background. Sherlock would have been able to determine that even without the benefit of his colours but seeing even this mundanity in as rich a detail as possible is exhilarating. There’s so much more he knows now, so much more he can
He bends his neck, takes the stranger into his mouth. There’s a sharp intake of breath above but no words. The man’s cock grows in his mouth above the waterline and in his hand below it. He strokes as he sucks and twirls his tongue along the crown and across the slit. The water is warm and his own balls hang heavy and buoyant between his parted knees.
“Oh! You’re not happy about the change in duties. You’re happy because you’re still investigating your own cases. Gone a bit freelance? Your soulmate isn’t pleased about that either.”
. That he hadn’t thought to consider. John’s lips open and close and stroke and caress across Sherlock’s mouth. Irene’s mouth had moved as well, but not like this.
“What is what?” It was a stupid, obvious question. Sherlock knew. He’d known for ages this was coming. It didn’t make him any less afraid.
“Nope.” Sherlock pops the “p” sound and discovers he is having a shocking amount of fun right now, actually.
Sherlock grins and hates himself for how quickly he vascilates between anger and hurt to wanting John’s approval and affection. It’s that pulling sensation in his chest again, and it feels entirely beyond his control. “What did you think?”
“How do you feel about the violin?” Sherlock directs that question to John as John watches the woman slink out of the room in embarrassment.
“Detective Sergeant Greg Lestrade,” the man says by way of greeting. He barely flicks Sherlock a look. Just another drug addict that he needs to question.
“Because you knew the chance of him dying was high. And you suspected the strength of our...of the bond.”
If his soulmate is alive, and Sherlock gains knowledge of who he is, what will he do? Track him down and throw himself at the man’s feet? Unlikely. He’ll do nothing.
The desert is cold at night. Much colder than John would have imagined. Azad, one of their local translators, says it’s because there are no clouds in the desert. The sun shines all day but there’s no cloud cover to hold the heat to the ground once the sun goes down. It’s as good a reason as any, John imagines. He can’t remember a day in England when there were no clouds.
The impact is harder than he thought it would be. Sherlock saw it coming, was braced for it, but John still managed to catch him a bit by surprise. As John always has.
Sherlock cants his hips up, bringing his now much-harder cock into contact with the heel of John’s hand. “I’d rather you touch me.”
It wasn’t perfect, obviously. Cues were missed and tempo is lost in trickier places, but it’s nothing that can’t be fixed with some work. Sherlock loves the work. The beauty of breaking down a composition, even one as uninspired as their new piece, into its parts and then bringing it back together again in harmony.
‘John’s’ hand momentarily tightens on Sherlock’s erection when he comes but he quickly resumes his rhythm. Sherlock lets himself relax into it, starts fucking ‘John’s’ fist with deep thrusts of his hips. He feels every millimeter of ‘John’s’ sweaty skin against his own. Feels the difference in the warmth provided by the air around them and the warmth of flesh against flesh.
She has fallen asleep, Sherlock realizes. It’s not a deep or restful sleep. She’s not making any of the small huffing noises she does when she’s truly out for the night, but she’s definitely unconscious. She can rest now. It’s enough to make Sherlock giddy.
John shivered. How this man knew that the real attraction lay in the fact that any of those men, any of his commanding officers, could take back their rightful place over him, John did not know. He did not care, either. It finally felt like he was playing the same game with someone, not a private game with hidden rules.
The part of this story that Sherlock was so happy about just a few moments ago, that he was proud to have avoided being trapped in something he didn’t want, fades away and he feels pinned to the scratchy, sterile hospital sheets under Mycroft’s gaze.
Sherlock wishes he could say he’d change that, but deep down he’s not sure he could do it. He couldn’t change it knowing what they have now. He’s not that strong, that unselfish. He would want John to have Mary back, but he’s glad it’s not his choice to make.
It feels as if John only makes it part way back over to his side of the bed. Sherlock feels John’s warm weight settle across his back and side. He’s certainly not going to complain about that.
“Here.” John slides a warm cup of tea into Sherlock’s hand. Something dark and strong and much prefered to the untouched chamomile from the night before. Rosie sits on John’s hip, shoving a handful of sticky cereal bits into her mouth.
Lestrade doesn’t look at him. He shoots a quick glance toward Molly, packing up her violin and chatting with a second violin who sits in the row behind her. He looks back to his notes before responding. “And I suppose you should be first chair instead?”
Sherlock stays up all night, unable to sleep, thinking about John Watson. Mrs. Hudson only asks him to stop screeching on his violin the one time. He does manage to go back to Bart’s to finish some tests from yesterday in the mid-afternoon.
It’s John’s own nervousness that ends the silence. He clears his throat before speaking. “Well, this is a prime spot. Must be expensive.”
“That’s not all though. You could do this any number of places. An alley in Saint-Michel would do just as well. But you chose here. I think it’s the church. You enjoy defiling it.”
“John.” Sherlock’s head whipped around. His hair was a flyaway mess from the wind and his cheeks a deep pink. His lips were bitten red and swollen. “If you don’t get your cock in me this instant-”
John stepped back. Sherlock looked a mess. His breeches were come stained, but at least he hadn’t dirtied his boots this year, his face was flushed, and his hair stood nearly on end. John smiled with all the fondness he felt spark to life in his chest.
Lestrade finally looks away from the chicken scratch he’s been scrawling across musical bars. The bite in Sherlock’s tone forces him too. “Why don’t you give them a call and see if they need another first violin then?”
Sherlock squeezes his eyes shut. John is trying to give him a way out but he can’t take it. Not now. Not knowing that everything he’s become is based on this defining moment of his early life.
Sherlock cross the sitting room and takes John’s shoulders in his hands again. He presses a quick, hard kiss to John’s lips then spins him toward the door, nearly knocking John’s feet out from under him.
“There’s no bed upstairs anymore.” His throat is dry when he says it. It’s the most direct fact Sherlock has to make John stay. Not just stay in Baker Street, that’s a given now, but stay with him.
Sherlock looks back to the ground, pavement again now, and heaves. He spits to clear the taste of imaginary bile from his mouth. When he looks back, Lestrade is no longer talking but he looks concerned. Very concerned. Even Donovan has stopped whatever it is she does at these things to lean over him with a sour look on her face.
Sherlock steps forward and picks away a bit of cereal stuck to her cheek. His toes almost nudge John’s. “Are you sure? I want you to be comfortable. Things are different now. Not like when we lived together before.”
Neither the concerto or the symphony of sex around him was enough to hold his attention for long. Sherlock opened his eyes, resolved to try the sauna for a more relaxing experience, but instead saw his mysterious stranger easing into the pool.
“Hmmmm. That’s not what people usually say.” His post-orgasmic lassitude is wearing off. He’s not restless again but he’s already thinking of the other things he could be doing.
He does so sooner rather than later. But it involves clambering up over Sherlock’s back to reach his phone on the nightstand. John must find the correct combination of keys quickly because the annoying trilling noise stops. See, Sherlock knew he could handle it.
Tonight, he and John will go to dinner without having to order pasta bolognese from the children’s menu and then he will succeed at seducing John on the sofa while the TV plays in the background. Tomorrow he’ll finish the experiment with the pig, maybe solve a crime, and remember that it’s his day to pick Rosie up from school. The thought of repeating these days ad nauseam no longer fills him with anxious dread. Instead, he smiles and looks forward to each and everyday.
The DS recovers rather more quickly than Sherlock would have guessed. “We’re here to talk about your transgressions, not mine.”
John holds his curled fist still and Sherlock fucks his grip. There’s enough sweat and come between them to make everything slide without unpleasant friction. He pushes against John’s shoulder to slide himself nearly all the way out of John’s hand, then slam back in until the heel of John’s hand brushes where his balls are tight and hot against his body.
Sherlock looked back over his shoulder and growled, “I said, ‘fuck me, Captain’.” His eyes crackled like a storm split sky and he panted through parted lips.
But that warm, calloused hand is heavy against Sherlock’s hip. He’s not alone, not really. John is with him, giving him this, and it’s just one more leap Sherlock has to make for John. He’d make a thousand more if John needed it.
Until he notices the reflection of police lights in the sitting room windows. He presses a quick kiss to John’s forehead and retreats to the window.
“Oh, Mrs. Hudson, the landlady, she’s giving me a special deal. Owes me a favour. A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out.”
The walk to Bart’s is short, just a few blocks, and Mike was heading back anyway so John might as well tag along and meet this bloke who needs a flatmate.
Lestrade’s hand no longer tries to restrain but instead guides him forward. Mycroft slides across the seat allowing Sherlock to clamber in next to him. Sherlock curls into a ball against the cool leather, using his coat to cover his eyes. If he can’t see anything at all then maybe his nausea will recede and his sweaty palms will dry and all of this will go away.
"Tea?" John asks gruffly, rapidly escaping to the kitchen, not awaiting an answer.  "I'll go put the kettle on."
"Oh yes. Caused by finally talking about things that should have been said years ago. Random feelings and ideas will continue to pour out of the infected until all possible connotations of thoughts and emotions have been shared." John's shoulders are shaking as he fights to hold his laughter back, tears threaten to spill down his cheeks. Sherlock says nothing but knows that not all of those tears are ones of mirth.
John almost sighed in relief when he felt Sherlock's hand return to his shoulder. He was intensely aware of Sherlock's proximity, how he could feel Sherlock's body heat merging with his own, how his breathing was slowing to match the steady breathing of Sherlock. Closing his eyes John savoured the sensation of his hand held within Sherlock's larger one, Sherlock's long fingers gently, but firmly closed around John's hand, John's thumb idly tracing small circles on Sherlock's skin. He could feel the muscles on Sherlock's back, gently moving under the fingers of his right hand. Resisting the temptation to sweep his hand over Sherlock's back John allowed himself to live in the moment.
"Order it now, John. Tell them we will pay extra for quick delivery. Don't order too much. Don't take too long to eat. I don't plan on waiting too long to have you naked and in our bed."
Sherlock has reclined his bed, its welcoming embrace encouraging him back to sleep, lacking only John to make the experience complete.
Mary's laugh jars Sherlock, making him flinch and his chest throb.  He moves from the sofa to his chair, wishing that he felt strong enough to lean against the fireplace or stand by his case board, anything to give him an advantage over Mary.  His limbs are tired and his chest aches; the trip to Bart's, the reality of the baby and John's vision of a hopeful future for them has thoroughly exhausted him. John looks in his direction, rising partially from his chair and Sherlock shakes his head, indicating for John to stay where he is.
John's ears perk up at the sound of his name, but the rest of the conversation is a mystery to him. He glances between the men in the hope that he can work out what is being said, but to no avail. Josef is studying him intently with something akin to awe on his face, which John finds confusing; what could possibly be awe worthy about him? Sherlock, on the other hand, is looking at him in a way that makes his skin heat and his breath catch. It's the same look John had glimpsed in the hotel room the night before. Hunger. This time Sherlock does not shutter the look away, but allows him to see it. Eyes the colour of the ocean seem to bore directly into John, silently willing him to understand. Swallowing roughly, John barely hears the words that are meant for Josef but said to him.
"I'll get another fire started and then we'll have a shower, get you all warmed up."The caretaker in John is at the forefront, but he'd be lying if he didn't admit that he had an ulterior motive in getting Sherlock into the shower. A flush heats his cheeks at the thought of a naked, wet Sherlock and he salivates at the thought of what he wants to do once he gets him there. In his experience, shower sex has been erotic in fantasy but chilly and awkward in reality, but John is more than willing to try with Sherlock. Gently, he eases Sherlock's hands out from under his t-shirt and pulls Sherlock's sheet over his shoulders. "Go get warm, Love." He nods over to the bed, indicating the duvet still rumpled there. Sherlock's eyes widen at the endearment and John's heart aches a little, even after all their experiences overnight, Sherlock still seems to find it a surprise that John thinks of him in this way.
The purple frock coat is open and frames Sherlock’s lean torso perfectly, drawing John’s attention to the loose white shirt that is open to halfway down his chest, displaying the fine chest hairs that John had admired earlier.
“A peculiar quirk of the British.  Male surgeons are often referred to as ‘Mr’ regardless of their various qualifications.  Mr Rajkoomar is held in high esteem in the field of neurosurgery, John was in very good hands.”
John slumps in his chair. Sleep is trying to call him back to its realms, but he is fighting against it. A night flooded with images of women with two faces, and babies that slip through his fingers like sand, has left him utterly exhausted and in no rush to surrender again to Morpheus' grip. He doesn't need a psychologist to explain the hidden message of those dreams - a duplicitous wife and a child that turned out to be another man's - literally
"John." It's the urgent tone that catches John attention rather than the sound of his name. "Look at this."
"Were there any other experiences with men for you?" Sherlock really wants to ask about one man in particular but he bides his time.
“I’ll ask, she already believes me to be investigating an attempted murder.”  Lestrade intercedes, grabbing his overcoat.  Mycroft quickly gathers his things together, packing them in his briefcase, before catching up with Lestrade and Sherlock.
"Good morning, boys." Mrs Hudson greets them with a smile, going on her toes to try and kiss Sherlock's cheek. John smothers a grin when Sherlock stoops down, meeting her half way, letting her plant a kiss on his whiskery cheek. "You need a shave, Sherlock, you're looking quite the down and out." She turns back to the sink, continuing with the washing up. "It's almost as bad as John's old moustache."
Sherlock pressed his steepled hands firmly against his lips, forcing his way through the first memories of his return, through the moments when he thought he had lost John forever. He allowed himself a few moments to linger on the moment that John had finally returned.  John was cut, bruised, slightly burned and confused as to why he had once again been put in danger. But the old John was back, gone was the John that had lost his identity, hiding inside the clothes of a much older man, hiding his handsome, boyish smile under a moustache. Returned was the clean shaven doctor with the military bearing, the spark of adventure evident in his deep blue eyes. After that they had returned to working cases together when John's work schedule allowed, their interaction still a little stilted but each man clearly pleased to have their best friend back. Best friend.  The words brought a half smile to Sherlock's face even when he was deep in his mind palace. He had never allowed himself to be anyone's friend before and now he was the best friend of the bravest, kindest and wisest man he knew. The knowledge warmed him inside and out, the sudden reminder of sensation bringing his mind firmly back to dancing with John. Dancing with John had been even more amazing than he thought it would. His fingertips still tingled from the warmth of John's skin.  Inhaling deeply he thought he could smell a trace of John on his fingertips.  A rich musk, slightly spicy and earthy. With the remembrance of the scent Sherlock recalled, how when they were pressed together, he had been able to rest his face against John's hair.  The strands tickling his cheeks had nearly caused him to stop breathing.  Only the wish to keep breathing John in, to keep filling his body with John in the only way he could had kept him focussed on repeating the instructions. Even then he hadn't been able to trust his voice, sure that the whispered words had given away how he was feeling. When John had pressed his face against his shoulder Sherlock had been unable to stop himself from pulling him in closer. Having his arms full of John had been far more pleasurable than he had ever allowed himself to imagine.  Hearing John's contented sigh had been almost enough to break the last remaining thread of self control he possessed. His body had started to respond to the closeness, the very maleness of John.  John's sigh had made him realise the very real danger of them remaining so intimately entangled; his burgeoning arousal would soon have become obvious to John, causing both men embarrassment. Sherlock's embarrassment for allowing his body to betray his emotions, John would have been embarrassed for Sherlock and also for being the cause of it. Of course Sherlock could have explained it away, natural bodily reaction caused by repeated pleasurable friction - could have happened with any dancing partner - but he knew he would not have been able to lie to John. He knew that would have given John a reason to finally stay away, knew that that final absence, chosen, not enforced, would be the thing that would break his heart utterly, knew that he would no longer even be able to act in a rational way and the thought terrified him.
"Mary.  What an unexpected surprise.  Do sit down." He gestures to the sofa, wincing when she makes a deliberate move towards his chair.
“Mmm. I was thinking maybe later John.” Sherlock nuzzles into John’s hair. “Let’s have our bath and maybe we can think about the fucking after.”
“Careful John, last time Sherlock and I saw a pair of Cowboy boots he deduced that the wearer was a sufferer of erectile dysfunction.”
"You know I'll just take them off as soon as you leave." Sherlock's heart sank at the thought of morning, knowing that John would need to leave soon, to go home to Mary.
Turning to face Sherlock, John is surprised to see worry etched into the expressive lines of Sherlock's face. What had happened in the house? What had he missed to be causing Sherlock such worry over him? Was he in danger? Was Lechner's killer at large? It took mere seconds for these questions to flash through John's mind and seemingly less time for Sherlock to know what he was thinking.
Mary stalks over to the empty visitor’s chair, determined to reassert her authority, and sits down, taking her time to adjust her coat and jeans, ensuring that both fall precisely, before reaching for John’s hand.  Her action falters slightly as a hiss of protest from Sherlock breaks the newly formed quiet of the sterile room, when no action follows Sherlock’s noise of dissent she takes John’s left hand in her own, ensuring that the bright light of the room reflects off the still shiny surface of their wedding rings.  It’s a petty move, she knows, but she just can't resist rubbing Sherlock’s nose in the fact that John is hers.  John wears her brand, after all. Mary does so love to see the great detective squirm, and yes, his discomfort is apparent in the flex of his jaw and the clench of his fists.  Big brother looks on, apparently unaffected but she knows that beneath that icy exterior beats the heart of a man who will do anything for his brother. Another great man who can be brought low by emotion.
“Yes, Watson, I’ll be home soon too.”  He pats the little bee on the head, garnering a short giggle from the toddler, before reluctantly moving away.
He stood in the doorway and waited for Sherlock to speak, as he knew his entrance hadn't been missed, his heart was pounding and he knew his face was flushed. Both reactions could be put down to him running up the stairs and he was relieved to know that Sherlock would be unlikely to deduce the reason behind John's heightened emotions - sentiment. The very thing that Sherlock abhorred.
Sherlock narrows his eyes, fingers pressed together and resting on his lower lip.  "I believe you are having fun at my expense."
"Welcome to our bedroom, John. Now, I believe we have some experimenting to do."  Sherlock raises one eyebrow at John, his expression cheeky and expectant.
Sherlock moves closer to John’s bed but keeps a careful distance between them, unsure of how John will feel about waking up in Sherlock’s arms.
“Let me explain how leverage works, Doctor Watson. For those who understand these things, Mycroft Holmes is the most powerful man in the country.
So, dear readers, we're approaching the end of this story, I hope you've enjoyed it and will join me in further adventures after this.  Writing for this fandom has  been a joy and something I look forward to continuing for many years yet!
"No. I honestly had no clue. I met her at the clinic about 9 months before Sherlock returned; one of our nurses had left and Mary was hired to replace her. She was efficient and friendly, the patients and staff adored her and, over time, we built up a friendship that turned into more. I know Sherlock believes I chose her because on some level I knew what she was really like, but I just can't see that. If I had known her for what she truly was I never would have allowed her to be employed at the clinic, let alone go on to have a relationship with her."
Each thrust seems to be a direct hit on John’s prostate and he is soon crying out his approval and encouragement. Sex has never felt this good to him before, this all-encompassing, in the tiny part of his brain that is not utterly lost in the moment he fervently hopes that it’s good for Sherlock too. A second later and even that little bit of brain is lost as Sherlock’s pace becomes erratic before stopping utterly.
“I thought you'd like to know that Doctor Watson is out of surgery and recovering well.”  She turns to go but halts at the sound of Mycroft softly clearing his throat.
“Fear is wisdom in the face of danger, it is nothing to be ashamed of.”  Sherlock grits out, his head spinning.
"Dance with me." Sherlock's voice was barely more than a deep growl, the throbbing vibration of it passing straight into John's body, pooling at his groin.
Huge thanks to 221Btls for giving this a read through when I couldn't see the wood for the trees, your encouragement and support breathed vital life into this chapter.
Sherlock reaches for the shower gel and squeezes some into his large hand.  The smell of citrus fills the warm, moist air and Sherlock knows he will never be able to smell lime again without visualising his hand on John's skin.  He thoroughly washes John's back, trailing his fingers over John's scar, the place where the bullet left his body forever marked with knotted scar tissue and a testament to John's life story.  Sherlock slides his soapy hands over John's shoulders, exploring their strength with his fingertips before dipping beneath his arms, working his fingers through the soft, fine hair.  John wriggles slightly, ticklish and Sherlock moves his hands so that they glide over John's chest.  He can feel the way John's nipples harden beneath his touch, the way that John fights the instinct to lean back against Sherlock, gripping at the sides of the bath instead. Gradually, Sherlock works his hands down John's body, dipping them under the water to take John in his hand.  Yesterday he had needed to be quick with actions, bringing John to climax before self-consciousness of their surroundings had fully hit him.  Today he means to take his time, to feel John as he reacts to each stroke and slide before finally climaxing at Sherlock's hand.
Sherlock’s knuckles turn white from where he grips the drip stand so fiercely, noticing this Lestrade swiftly moves the conversation on.
Sherlock wakes an hour after dawn and feels more invigorated than he has in weeks, months if he's honest with himself.  John stirs at the movement of Sherlock leaving the bed, blinking bleary eyes in his direction.
Once again, huge thanks to commenter Iriya for correcting my punctuation and grammar within the translations. Very much appreciated!
"John?" Sherlock calls, trying for John's notice. "I believe that if I have my pain killers now and we take a cab I'll be able to accompany you on your trip to Bart's."
"John. No more teasing. Please."  Sherlock is begging and he is too far gone in his passion to be embarrassed or ashamed.
Hello! So sorry about the long wait for this update! It's been the school holidays and I also had the 'fun' of dealing with a broken nose (my eldest daughter) and a suspected broken wrist (me) and all the hospital visits they entail! We're both all healed now and I think the creative juices are flowing again!
“This is dull.  I don't do well with dull.”  Sherlock’s complaining draws John out of his increasingly depressing thoughts and back to the present day.  As usual, Sherlock ignores the muttered ‘no kidding’ John gives and ploughs on.  “Tell me what happened earlier, you've done well at avoiding giving me any information so far but that won’t last, so admit defeat now and tell me.”
Together they climb under the duvet, moving so that Sherlock rests his head on John’s good shoulder, their legs entwined.
"Oh god, it's all so fucked up. Why is it always my fault, Sherlock?" John begs, hands covering his face as he fights back bitter tears.
"I want to taste the sweat from your skin; the saliva from your mouth." Sherlock's voice is a deep velvet richness and John can feel himself drowning in it. Hearing those words, in
"Right John I think we've procrastinated enough, don't you? Time for the lesson to begin!" Sherlock managed to huff out between bouts of laughter, his eyes purely focused on John.
It's her apparent lack of remorse and her single-mindedness when trying to frame her father for the crimes that she carried out in her youth that eats at John. He closes his eyes and tries to put himself in her position. He can understand that she was trying to protect Michael from their abusive father but it doesn't make her actions any more palatable. John knows he would move heaven and earth to protect those that held his heart. He had done, shooting a cabbie without hesitation long before he realised his heart resided within Sherlock; but Jeff Hope had been a direct threat to Sherlock, there had been no time to find an alternative solution. John had acted from the gut and in doing so had rid the world of a benign looking serial killer. Mary's actions had been directed at those guilty of no wrong doings, their only 'error' that of being in some way, however tenuously, linked to her father.
“No, I don’t believe so.  I think the best thing we can do now is carry on with our romantic weekend. Although now there’s no need for us to only act the couple.”  Sherlock’s voice is quiet, intimate.
The touch of weak, warm sunlight on his bare shoulder is what eventually pulls John out of his deep sleep. He grins up at the ceiling as memories of earlier flood over him. He had waited so long to feel Sherlock against him, to kiss him, to hold him and it had been even better than he had ever imagined it could be; was still being even better. He looks down at the dishevelled mop of curls resting on his chest; Sherlock's face is angled away leaving John with the view of his nape and a long, lithe body, now mostly swathed in covers. Against that pale neck rests a single lock of hair; it has curled into a loose loop and the sight of it makes John's fingers twitch. He resists for a moment before remembering that he is allowed to do this now, he is allowed to run his fingers through Sherlock's hair, to embrace his body. Slowly, he moves his hand up until his fingers are almost resting on Sherlock's neck. Releasing a long breath he trails his fingertips over the shape of the curl, savouring its softness and the warm dampness of the skin beneath. At his touch, Sherlock begins to stir, nothing more telling than a change in breathing and a slight tightening of the arm that rests across John's torso. John knows that Sherlock is giving him time to adjust to their new situation; he also knows that no time is needed. Resting his hand more firmly against Sherlock's neck, John buries his face into Sherlock's hair, breathing in its rich scent before pressing firm kisses in amongst the curls. Sighing, he pulls back and absent-mindedly rubs his thumb over Sherlock's neck. Sherlock stretches languidly and moves to position his face next to John's on the soft pillow.
His flat on Montague Street is dingy and dark but he can pay the rent with his private clients and that’s all that matters. He’s given up the drugs but he does still suck back cigarettes a few packs at a time. Lestrade only seems to mind that during the few days a month when he himself tries to quit smoking.
Sherlock’s blood boils. All of the calming effects of a day of musical, even if rudimentary, work are gone. “Well, for once, you’re absolutely right. This isn’t the London Symphony.”
Île de la Cité was as crowded as any other Parisian neighbourhood, but John pushed and forced his way to the entrance of the great cathedral. It was his annual pilgrimage.
He dropped Sherlock’s cock and grabbed him by the hips. “Stroke your cock and come all over the stones of Our Lady while all of Paris watches you.”
John’s hand closes around his cock, as best it can through his pants anyway, and squeezes lightly. “You’re making it really hard to go slowly,” John groans.
Stamford is smiling as if John’s whole world hasn’t fallen apart. “Nurses say it’s better to hide blood drips.”
“Right, I’ll make tea.” John shuffles off to the kitchen before Sherlock can bring himself to look at John again.
“I know you’re an Army doctor and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him, possibly because he’s an alcoholic. More likely because he recently walked out on his soulmate. And I know your therapist thinks your limp is psychosomatic. Quite correctly, I’m afraid.”
John grabbed a fistful of Sherlock’s hair and pulled him back roughly. It was the sort of harsh care John had shown him since the beginning. Sherlock moaned around John’s cock and went still. He looked up at John and found John staring down at him, eyes wide and chest heaving.
John’s rhythm falters and grows erratic. He’s close. Sherlock can feel it even though he’s never seen anything like this before. He keeps pressing forward, moving his hand up and down John’s length and using the pad of his thumb to rub against the underside of the head of his cock on each stroke.
Lestrade sighs dramatically from his spot on the chair. He had sat there, watching as Sherlock pick his way through this new composition. It was appalling. Sherlock had no idea why Lestrade remained so crushingly optimistic about Sherlock’s reactions to the orchestral pieces Lestrade brought him. Sherlock’s best reaction to date had been a begrudging “This will be fine.”
It’s a joke, and Sherlock has never heard ‘pig guts’ be growled out in a way that makes his toes curl before, but he steps back anyway. He’ll wash up, John will take him to dinner, and then they’ll come home and pretend to watch some boring movie before heading to bed.
Sherlock wanted to reach out, to touch John’s hand or hair or any part of him he could reach. But this was still too new to risk. He could pull away some invisible scab and they could bleed out before they have their chance. “You don’t have to tell me. I know.”
John halted in his walk to the kitchen when he thought he heard his name being softly spoken. Turning, he saw that Sherlock had already fallen into a light doze, his eyelashes fanning over skin, pale semi circles of smudged sootiness beneath his eyes evidencing his exhaustion. John's gaze travelled over the long expanse of his friend, still stunned that he was back in his life, living, breathing, occasionally eating and sleeping. Sherlock looked somehow younger, more fragile whilst sleeping and John felt his chest tighten at the surge of protectiveness he felt for this man.
"I'll call you later Sherlock, we need to talk." John had hesitated momentarily before putting his hand softly against Sherlock's cheek then grabbing his coat. Then he was gone and Sherlock had been left stunned by the sudden change in events.
"Yes. God yes! You've earned your reward." John's voice was broken with desire and anticipation. "Do you have anything in that drawer we can use?" John felt oddly liberated, no awkwardness in his words.
"That's beautiful Sherlock. What is it?" Opening his eyes Sherlock saw John sitting back in his own chair, a mug of tea by his side, another on the table next to Sherlock. Beside his mug sat a plate of toast, cut on the diagonal. John had cut it just how he liked it, the thoughtfulness of it making him smile as he sat, facing John.
