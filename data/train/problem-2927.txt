“You can say anything around us, girls. You know that” Dean encouraged. It took them a minute before Sadie said “Why don’t you and Cas have kids?”
“Dean? What’s going on?”
Cas wipes at his eyes with the back of his hands “Asshole using my words against me” He laughs.
Cas is quiet for a moment, thinking “Sometimes.”
Jack puts his hand to Dean’s shoulder, “Save him and find out.”
“I GOT IN!” Jack yells, excitement seeping through the speaker.
Sam gives a crooked smile, “Well if Heaven has a boiler room, I’m pretty sure that’s where I landed.”
“Same here Cas. We’ve only got the future ahead and it’s bright darlin’ so so bright.”
A week had passed and Sam was still wallowing, when Claire had called Dean saying she had a case for him and Cas if they wanted. He told her that Sam was back too, that apparently he and Jody broke up. She had told him she didn’t know. They both ended the conversation confused but Dean never told Sam that.
“I know I know I still worry though, can’t help it.”
CAS: How’s the job going?
Dean shot Cas a look as he took a large bite, “Seattle. Gabe invited him."
“So you’re saying he was human?”
“Another 100% Dean, well done” She smiles at him and he thanks her and smiles back. He has everything, the grades, the sport, the car (a ‘67 chevy impala given to him as a 16th birthday present from his father) but the only thing he doesn’t have is someone. Someone that would love him the way he loved and care for him the way he cared.
Sam stops mid-sentence,“oh?”
Cas cocked his head at Dean “Neither are his. He stabbed me the first time we met.”
“Don’t be, you’re teaching him to be safe with drinking and I’m happy to steer him clear of my bad habits.”
“Talk soon Jack.”
They continue watching when Cas snorts. Like a noise between a laugh and a snore.
Cas huffs again “That I did.”
“You’ve seen this movie haven't you?” Cas blurts out after Elsa had built her ice castle and had claimed to Let it Go.
Naomi wags a finger at him “That’s not how you get your way around here.”
Dean paused, considering his words but decided to go ahead “Cas. I never thanked you for that— for changing your life completely…”
“I’ve- I’ve always kind of wanted to learn new things. Going to school sounds- interesting” Cas said solemnly well Dean gave him a interested look. “I didn’t know you wanted to go to school?”
“And what about you?”
Dean stands with an exasperated gasp, “No, listen- I did not cheat and I don’t care if you think I did just because I am supposed to be some dumb jock but my dad would chop my own hands off if I did. And I find it very unfair that I’m being accused of this when you both have no shred of proof so excuse me but you can both go to hell” Dean says abruptly, grabbing his books and beginning to step towards the door.
“Hmm?”
Dean jumps, “Geez, learn to knock Jack!”
Dean understood why they worked so well together. He hadn’t been around the two of them together much. But their relationship was something Dean had always hoped Sam would have.
“Hey, I just call ‘em like I see ‘em.”
Four months later Dean and Cas took a drive out to Sioux Falls for the first time since July. The girls were ecstatic to see them, Hannah jumping into Cas’ arms while Sadie jumped into Dean’s. They then traded girls after returning said hugs then followed up by saying hello to Jody and Sam.
“But I didn’t cheat!” Dean yells, furiously. “You taught us the same formula that’s why it looks similar! And we both did well which means that it would look the same because we both got it right.”
“Alright, Jack you’re on speaker. Now, what’s going-”
Dean shook Jack’s hair “Yeah kid. College has gone and made you super wise huh.”
“I wanna apologize first, sorry for leaving dinner like that I—”
Jack is in shock as much as Dean is. But about a million questions start flipping through Dean’s mind. He wishes he could speak to get some answers but all he can do is wheeze.
“Then I’ll have to make you.”
Cas looks up at him, “Thanks” he grins, then proceeds to wink. And for a split second Dean thinks, this is it. Finally, it’s all gonna happen. That Cas is going to let this happen for both of them because Dean’s so ready. He’s semi-hard in his jeans, his brain is screaming of wanting to touch Cas in any way possible, to feel the guy on top of him, to kiss him senseless literally everything that’s been going through his mind for years.
Cas turned to look up at him, his blue eyes dancing in the small amount of light “Then I guess I’ve never thanked you for allowing me to save you.”
Dean backs up, trying to shield Cas from them.
Sam had offered countless time’s to come help Dean with reno’s of the bar but Dean was adamant he was fine on his own. But on week 4 of reconfiguring the kitchen and Dean almost flooding the place, Cas demanded that he call his brother.
Jack narrows his eyes further, “So then you are killing him!”
“Crap” Dean hisses “Now what?”
“See ya.”
Cas gives him a thin smile, he’s upset Dean can see that. He wants to reach out, touch him, comfort him in someway cause he hates seeing Cas so torn up.
Cas doesn’t reply but Dean can’t lie when he saw the relief settle on Cas’ face. Dean’s too preoccupied thinking about Cas being a-okay co-parenting with him. That he doesn’t realize Cas is already in front of Jack’s door.
“Jack I’m warning you. This is between me and Cas. That’s it.”
“Dean...” Castiel starts by taking in a big deep breath, “I just wanted to say that I had nothing to do with calling you out for cheating. I-I merely was talking to Mrs. Anderson about a formula when she suggested so, I thought she was being ridiculous, but I didn’t have the courage to challenge her. I’m sorry that you had to go through that.”
He looks at the screen, almost afraid to answer it. He hasn’t talked to Jack since Sam left, nor has the kid tried to talk to him. He didn’t feel like checking in, unsure what he would even begin to say. Jack has always been able to sniff out Dean’s problems and Dean loathes sharing, especially to Jack. Dean only assumes he’s busy with school, but his worst fear is that Sam talked to him first.
Dean tilts his bottle at him “Knew you would.”
“Yeah don’t make me regret it” Dean said.
“He will Dean. You know that.”
“Of course you weren’t sunshine” Dean whispers before walking over to run a hand through Cas’s hair. Cas almost purrs at the touch.
Jack doesn’t deserve that.
Dean pauses before opening his mouth, “So...you’re saying that this was all Mrs. Anderson’s fault.”
“About?” Castiel asks, surprised.
Sam leaves the garage with the door clicking behind him, as Dean finishes up two more quick adjustments then slams baby’s hood shut.
“That’s actually really sweet” Cas said with a grin.
Dean’s eyes widen “Everything?”
“Not sure how you did all that but good job” He turns to back to Jack, but Jack shakes his head “wasn’t me.” Dean looks at him confused as he unlocks the cuffs off of Jack’s wrists.
“What?” Jack and Sam say at the same time.
“Isn’t that the point?”
JACK: I’ll always worry, regardless Dean.
“Um. Not saying that I’m afraid of her but please don’t?”
DEAN: Anytime kiddo :) Enjoy tonight.
“Truth or dare,” she asks narrowing her eyes.
Dean eyes Cas from the floor, Cas cocks his head telling him to chill out.
They took a liking to Cas almost immediately, he had cool stories to tell they’d apparently told Sam. Dean though was left in the shadows. Acting like it didn’t bother him that the twins barely looked at him once, when he solemnly confided in Cas that it had stung. It took a handful of facetime calls during May and June, then another visit in July when Sadie jumped into Dean’s arms the second he walked through the door. Hannah was mad for the next twenty minutes because she wanted to hug Uncle Dean first but her sister had slammed their bedroom door in her face.
“I love you more” he replies.
Except under all that pain and anger, his worry arises that maybe he’s not trying hard enough. That maybe he should be looking for Cas even if the guy doesn’t want to be found. The sounds of the siren saying “I love you” in Cas’ voice have haunted his nightmares since and will continue to do so if he doesn’t do something about it.
“Thanks, Dad.”
“I’m not sure I fully remember.”
“What did you say you were studying?” Dean asked.
“Him?!-”
“Hey man, you’re not-”
“Then we save them for next time! I don’t want to watch another western movie, we literally watched only Clint Eastwood movies yesterday! I want to laugh!”
“Where are you, you bitch” He mutters under his breath.
Mrs. Anderson sighs, “Dean I know you do well in this class but if-”
“Shut up Sam.”
(See the end of the chapter for
And here they were 9 months after opening date, Dean had left the bar in the hands of Mikayla his snarky but trustful assistant manager. Well he and Cas traveled from San Francisco to Sioux Falls, they hadn’t been on a road trip like this since their hunting days. Crazy that it would almost be a year since they threw in the towel. But Dean was grateful that they made that choice, the life he had now was amazing. He felt so blessed to be given the opportunities he had. On top of that, having Cas at his side all the time. Them living this life together that Dean ached for, for so long. He wouldn’t give it up for anything.
“Yeah yeah, of course.”
Praying, wishing, hoping for Cas to suddenly whoosh back in and for them to be together and okay once again. But nothing happens, he gets nothing in return for his confessions and it hurts more every time he does it.
“You could make more Dean.”
“Yeah yeah. Whatever.”
“Nope. Same with our son, Jack. He was- and also isn’t anymore. He’s 23, big nerd, an actual teddy bear you’d love him.”
They didn’t understand where everything went wrong, we’re they really off their game that much? Dean was lucky he got away with a minor concussion and a few deep scrapes. Sam was still in surgery, having a bullet taken out of his kidney. And Cas was next to Dean, laying in a hospital bed— just like he had been in Heaven. Instead this time he was getting a blood transfusion because he was human. Dean held his hand and Cas woke periodically and squeezed back.
He’s got a green toothbrush in its holder next to where Sam and Dean put theirs. Sam’s currently missing. Dean flicks his eyes away quickly but can’t fight the urge to look back up at Cas who’s now sporting a foamy mouth.
Dean presses his lips together “You have yes.”
“Cas I’m so sorry.”
Sam brought along a guy named Lewis from his crew and the three of them plus the two guys Dean hired, got the whole kitchen reconfigured in a week. Lewis flew home a day later but Sam wanted to hang around. He hadn’t seen Dean and Cas in person in almost 10 months. It was nice to catch up, see what their new lives were looking like. He even got to meet up with Jack and Gabe, the 5 of them having a nice dinner at a local place up the road from Dean’s future bar.
Dean looks at it confused before glancing back at him, “Cas. I told you to stay out of my head.”
“Actually, I wanted to tell you” Cas pauses “I think the Impala is already Grease Lightning” He smirks. Dean falls more in love with him.
“It’s okay. Hey, you’re here now that’s all I need.”
Dean lifts his hand to put it on Cas’s cheek but it falls flat, passing right through him.
“Hey hey. It’s fine- It’s fine. You’re safe. What happened?” Dean had his hand on his shoulder, squeezing gently in comfort.
Dean detests this new Cas ‘cause for as long as Dean’s known the guy he’s been this formal, stock, and brash being. Even when he was fully human he had a certain naivety around him; all due to the lack of knowledge of human behavior. But now, he’s found himself in this niche of practicing human functionalities. And on top of all that, he’s picked up different ways of expression and behaviors from all the characters he’s watched.
“And super awesome in the sack” Dean snickered.
Jack and Gabe were using Jack’s fall break to travel up to Seattle as Gabe had some job interviews there. He had graduated in June and had been working at the university up until this opportunity arose, so off the two of them went.
Cas snorts.
Dean’s brain goes on the fritz. Are they talking about it? Is Cas pissed? Should they talk about it? Things were seemingly back to normal? Dean might still wanna pick up where they left off, but Cas? Dean’s positive he doesn’t want this. Why else would he say they can’t? Hell, it makes sense though. Cas being an angel and all that. Dean being a human and all that. How would that even work?
And the ugly, was much worse.
“You should, it would give you something to look forward too. Not have the same day over and over.”
Jack quickly gives him a quick hug. Dean hugs him back “We’re gonna get Cas back, I promise you.” Jack squeezes him tighter before letting go and saying “Love you dad” and leaving the room to answer his phone.
Dean needed the escape. Too many thoughts at once swirling through his mind. Jack going off to college? Cas wanting to be human? Him being in love with Cas and admitting it to himself? Damn Winchester, you sure know how to make a situation even more complicated.
“If- If Cas were to make a drop in to visit you, you’d tell me right?”
“Shit I have to hand in an assignment online. What time is it?” “Just after 10 pm.”
“We may have had a moment and he said he couldn’t do this. Us. He stuck around for a bit after that, we ignored what had happened. He was acting a little strange… I think he was drunk. But he took off. Like he always does.”
“Oh my god, Jack I was kidding. You’re smart, you can do this” Dean encourages.
“Great,” Dean says before swiftly leaving the room.
“Castiel is more or less a battery at this point... he needs to stay up here to keep Heaven’s energy levels at bay.”
Dean lets his heart stop hammering in his chest before taking a deep breath and getting up out of the chair.  He shifts the little girl closer to his neck before opening the door a bit to see a stunned, slightly weepy Cas standing there.
Dean was busy making sure the bar stayed cool enough for patrons but also invited in people off the street to come in and take a breather. Dean swore off shorts long ago but today he had to put his morals aside and do what was comfortable.
CAS: I can’t. Not yet.
Jack roars with laughter on the other end, “Yeah I’m going to this bar off-campus at 9."
Dean turns slowly, “I hate him, Sam. I hate him so much.”
Although, through his suffering Dean begins researching looking endlessly through books in the library. Trying to find a sure way to contact Cas that would guarantee him a response. He considered summoning a demon (which Sam talked him out of) for information. Then he thought he found a spell only for it to blow up in his face, literally. He even tries calling him, holding his breath through the rings hoping that maybe this time he’ll pick up. He doesn’t though.
Cas looked at Dean from his bed, Dean hadn’t left him alone for more than a half an hour since he woke up. “Honey why are you crying?” Cas whispered tenderly. He reached out to wipe at Dean’s tears but it only made Dean’s tear fall faster.
“I understand but Castiel is worried that—”
Dean grumbled out “yeah they did.”
Cas walked from around back and gasped “CHARLIE?”
Jack’s face turns up as he looks at Dean scared and hopeless.
Jack lets out a frustrated sigh.
“Yes but- is that my shirt?” Dean feels his cheeks go hot.
Cas grins around his toothbrush, looking nervous but amused. Dean can’t help in letting his grin grow.
“Dean…” Cas whispers “you did good tonight.”
“No, he’s not” She says her cheeks a cheerful shade of pink “But his brother is.”
“Hey, y’all wanted to know!” Charlie shouts.
“No, but please” He raises his voice, “I didn’t cheat! I'm telling you the truth. I don't have anything to back this up on other than my knowledge for this stupid class."
For the first few months, he tried (and oh did he try) to ignore his stupid brain coming up with stupid scenarios for him and his imaginary version of Castiel. He’d daydream in class thinking about how adorable they’d be as a couple, roaming the halls and holding hands. At night, doing homework he'd think about them sharing kisses under the bleachers and getting yelled at by coach. He'd imagine while driving home, turning down a different street that he'd be on his way to pick up Cas for a date. They'd pick up some food and Dean would find somewhere to park the Impala and they'd sit on the hood and watch the stars.
“Just- breathe and go get the stuff from the house and meet me at the hospital. Oh and charge your phone.”
He laughs “I will, I swear. So many memories in this backyard.”
“Is that the movies with Dr. Evil?” Cas says. Dean must look surprised based on the glare Cas gives him.
“Did- did you see him!” Jack asks sounding hopeful.
“But being scared doesn’t make me or you weak. It makes us aware, to gain more control, and eventually, stronger. I don’t have to accomplish or be good at what I’m afraid of, I just have to do it and try my best. That’s all anyone could ask for.”
“Same to you.”
Cas has been wearing more and more human clothes, something different every day and Dean still will never get used to it.
But Dean sits back in his recliner uncapping his beer and taking a large swig. Cas goes back to watching. The tension in the room dissipates. Nothing happens.
“Okay okay fine.”
The movie finishes and Cas looks all tiny curled up on the recliner, Dean pauses before moving to his laptop.
Cas gives him a kind smile.
“What’s a’ matter Cas?” Dean questions, wiping his oil-stained hands on a rag.
“Everybody time for truth or dare!” Jo shouts from on top of the stage.
Dean doesn’t know how to reply to that. Heartbroken? He really needs to keep his emotions in check.
“Oh,” Cas looks surprised.
“Night Dad.”
When he steps further into the rotting building, a sprinkler system starts pouring water from the ceiling. He spits out the water as it keeps coming, like a torrential downpour indoors. He opens his eyes but barely can before water is seeping into them, blurring his vision completely.
Dean freezes, “Wait what no I-I don’t.”
Dean sighs, he hates himself. He hates God. He hates angels. He hates life.
That heat underneath Dean’s plaid shirt doesn’t disappear and his heart swells with the fact that he’s just speaking to the boy he’s had a crush on all year. But he takes a deep breath and walks to catch up with Castiel ready to make this night worth every minute.
Dean peeks in first, holding his angel blade firmly in his hand. He listens for breathing, for footsteps anything. But there’s only silence. He nods for Sam and Jack to follow him.
“I used my powers, to look for him… and I… can’t” he chokes out.
Dean feels like a big jerk all of a sudden. All he's wanted is to have the courage to talk to Castiel and maybe get to know him cause the kid does look interesting and he does have a pretty face but Dean knows there’s so much more to that.
“He wants to go to college” Dean spits out.
Dean takes a step back and watches Jack seem to physically calm down. He looks at his phone again, quickly typing out a message.
Dean grins, “Easy enough” but pauses before taking his phone out, “And hey I’m not sure how much this will mean coming from me but I want you to know that I- We will never not be proud of you. You’re one of the most powerful beings in the universe but you don’t let that affect you. You rather go through the hardships of life and learn, than be greedy or a cheat. I respect you for that, Jack. But we’ll never tell you that you’re not good enough because you are. No matter what, okay?”
“Start telling you my side and see if we match up in stories huh?”
“Bite me” he snarls.
“Then Castiel will die when we extract his grace,” She says calmly.
“Hey! that’s awesome! Good job man.”
“Dean, what are you even doing anyway?” Sam asks, now suddenly interested.
“I love you, Dean.”
Dean tries to recollect himself but he fails as another choked cry comes escaping his mouth. God, he hasn’t cried this much ever in his life.
“Fucking hell Cas, you’ve been around us for how freakin’ long! Learn how to knock!” Dean curses, glaring at him from under baby’s hood. While Sam picks up the 100-year-old book he just dropped.
“Sounds good.”
“Jack-” Cas says hoarsely.
“I’m getting there. We found Castiel when he was confused and lost. Torn between continuing his journey to becoming human and yet still wanting to be an Angel. We offered him peace with an exchange of course. His grace would come to power Heaven and he would walk freely as a human, no more ties to Heaven.”
Dean and Cas said their own goodnights, before turning to each other.
Dean sets to work, lifting box after box and piling them into the room across the hall in some kind of real-life game of Tetris. He’s positive that he heard Sam return, but Dean’s focused and in a groove so he forces himself to finish moving stuff before going to eat whatever Sam hopefully brought him back.
Cas squinted, “Mmm but you kinda do.”
Dean’s whole body quakes with nerves, he breathes in sharply finally finding his legs moving across the room. He lifts his hand to grab at the sheet, shutting his eyes and taking in another deep breath before opening it.
Dean rubs his hands over his face, “Then what do we do?”
She was petite, blonde, and all curves but she could throw Dean through a window if she wanted.
“Thanks. How’s hunting going? Anything interesting?”
Dean shakes his head “This- meaning Jack?”
Dean nodded “I never want to see you in a hospital again” Dean sobbed and Cas understood. He said nothing else but petted at Dean’s hair and made sure Dean knew he was there.
He knows that the siren was playing off his thoughts, memories, and feelings. Dean hated believing even for a second that Cas was back. Even if he only played along to kill it. But also the nerve that it had becoming Cas. His Cas. He wishes he could kill the thing a million times over, so it could feel an ounce of what he feels.
Cas wipes at the tears on Jack’s cheeks, “Now the waterworks can take a breather?”
JACK: I hope you guys realize how much you both care about each other.
“That's what I told her. She said it wasn’t enough, that my debt has not been repaid in full. I still refused, told her to figure it out on her own. But then she said it.”
Hugs were passed around and then it was time. The temporary goodbyes were hard, but it was for the best. Cas held onto Dean’s hand as they left the hospital together, then sat in the Impala, breathing.
Sam liked to pester him about it, seeing how happy Dean was for once in his life. He radiated this glow as Sam had said and Dean flipped him off. But genuinely Sam couldn’t be happier, for the both of them. That is until they would start kissing a little to heavily in public space and Sam would beeline it out of the room.
Dean smiles softly to himself, “Of course- of course, you can come stay. Bring anything you need, school work included. We’re about two hours from the bunker, we’ll pick up pizza on our way. You’re welcome to head there now if you don’t feel safe.”
Dean knew sooner or later that Sam would find him in his work-in-progress Dean cave, except he’s surprised to see Cas standing there at the door instead.
Instead, he walks out of the building and down to where his car is parked, he tosses his backpack into the passenger seat and texts Sammy to find his own way home today. He’s in no mood to stick around this shit show.
They now live in San Fran full time in an apartment above the bar. A space to call their own. They also were happy to be closer to Jack. Getting to spend more time with him and learn some more about Gabe.
JACK: Thanks, Dean.
With a minute left in the last quarter, they’re down by just a few points. This touchdown could get them another win which they need to make playoffs.
Dean and Cas take this at face value and head upstairs, following Gabe and Jack. They grab their suitcases from the trunk and give hugs of thanks and goodbyes. The two younger boys leave as Dean and Cas stand on the sidewalk looking up at their lit up house.
There’s a succession of texts from Jack in the group chat he made with Dean and Cas.
They say nothing as they descend the stairs, both automatically walking back to the forest they had landed in. But as they come up to the edge of a mass of trees Dean says, “You think you could mojo us to bunker for a rest? Then zap us back to Sam in a few hours?”
The crowd of drunk teenagers gasp and there's a few Do it’s and giggles followed.
Dean hurries, sitting next to Cas’s body on the bed, “Hey hey I’m gonna get you out of here.”
“Kelly had savings and get this. He blackmailed the president” Dean says matter-of-factly while eying Cas.
They stay like that for a few moments only breathing heard before Jack mumbles “m’sorry… really sorry… I didn’t mean to push you.”
“Heaven will seize to exist if you continue this please, I’m begging you. Do something” she pleads.
Sam narrows his eyes, “Did Jody call you?”
This continues consistently for almost three weeks. They were on a hunt in North Dakota, having just finished up a shapeshifter thing. The three of them returned to the rundown motel, Sam calling dibs on the shower first. Dean had cursed and took a seat at the squeaky table in the corner. Pulling his phone out and replying to Jack’s question of ‘What’s a Fraternity?’
Cas is blinking at him, it’s like the old dick bag Cas who knew nothing. And oh how far they’ve come from that. Dean’s experienced every version of Cas and he’s fallen in love with each and every one of them. And the way Cas’s face suddenly softens, Dean’s certain he feels the same. But he waits, holding tightly onto Cas’s hands. The warning siren continues to blare. Dean waits for a response. And Jack lets go of Naomi.
“Jack?!” Dean exclaims up and out of his chair. He rests a hand carefully on Jack’s back, rubbing comforting circles, “You alright?”
“Letting go of my grace to get her— the best choice of my life” Cas breathed.
“Yeah?”
“Dean I did something bad,” Jack says words quivering.
Most of the lights are off on this floor too. But thankfully, there’s not an army of Angels waiting for them. Dean beckons for them to follow.
“Dean this is insane.”
If he’s trying to look human, he does. Cause for a second Dean forgets that Cas is a celestial being that could zap him to the other side of the world. But Cas looks so soft, his hair a little rumpled and out of place. His eyes have crinkles and his lip quirks at loud sounds, Dean could watch him for hours if he wanted.
Dean grumpily finishes chewing on the crust of his pizza, knocking back the rest of his beer to wash it down, “John Wayne can have funny moments!”
Dean pauses, “You can talk about her Jack. It’s okay. But yeah kind of, we’re still picking up some small cases but there are younger hunters out there now. Gotta pass the torch sometime.”
“Where are we Jack?” Dean asks now more coherent.
Dean looks over at Cas who also looks kinda grossed out.
Mrs. Anderson stopped teaching, writing the words Homework due tomorrow with page numbers.
Dean starts shushing him, “Then don’t be- Don’t be an angel. Forget it all. It’s okay Cas to want that, but don’t give it to these assholes.”
When he stops cursing his little brother, he takes a good look over Cas. The sweatpants are a little big on him but Dean’s t-shirt with a faded ACDC logo on it hugs Cas’ curves perfectly.
Cas shrugs, “It was weird tasting after being human, remembering the way my human senses picked everything up. Now? I’ve taught myself ways to put the molecules aside and enjoy food even though I don’t need it.”
Cas sits on the couch with Jack while Dean sits across from them on a dining chair. They’re laughing now, or at least Dean is in trying to uplift Jack.
JACK: Night Dean.
“Holy shit” Cas mumbles “Jack are you serious?”
Sam nods, his eyes going cross-eyed before passing out again.
“Night Jack.”
No trenchcoat to be seen.
They hit the 1 year anniversary of the bar opening. Celebrating with a big Halloween party.
“Sure!” Jack replies with a grin but not before hugging Dean and Cas again “So happy to have you both back” Then he’s skipping off. Literally.
Dean opens his mouth to start protesting but Cas silences him with a hand on his thigh. “Jack we cannot accept this.”
“Cas is dying.”
“Good good. Cas took me to Paris a few weeks ago, that was cool. How are you doing?”
“He IS dying Jack! I never lied!”
“I said somethings... like calling you a nerdy kid and stuff. I didn’t mean that. I swear Castiel. I’m sorry too.”
“We’re moving him into an apartment with a roommate. Jack and I, we went got him everything he said he needs” Cas adds.
“Oh, so it's like a secret club huh?”
They all have a nice peaceful dinner talking about both of their trips. They gave Jack the full update on Sam, blaming it on a work accident gone wrong. All three of them are retired agents according to Gabe, all these cases are NDA signed so they can’t talk about it much. But luckily
“Same to you,” Cas replies.
“This is nice” Cas said.
“DEAN!” Cas glared.
Dean gapes at him “Oh…”
“Hey hey, what’s wrong?” Then it’s Dean’s turn to groan.
Dean looks down at Cas, who’s still thin and barely hanging on but has tears leaking from his eyes.
“Humanities.”
He stabs the dagger right into the middle of Cas— the siren’s— stomach. Dean can’t watch the life fade out of the monster eyes that look so much like Cas’. He turns away as he hears Sam coming running up next to him.
“Whoa whoa. Jack hey?” Dean quickly went from afraid panic to concerned panic. Jack sniffled as some more tears leaked from his eyes.
“I got an email from Sam with a wedding invite?! I didn’t know you guys had quit? I called him right away, he sent me a link to your Instagram page. Very nice marketing by the way.”
Jack grabs his backpack off the floor and digs out a pair of star wars PJs and a toothbrush. “I’ll get you some more blankets. It can get cold in these rooms.”
“Yesterday actually. I drove up from Silicon Valley. Was there for a conference when Sam’s email came through.”
Dean pauses, putting down the rag on his workbench. He takes a daring step closer to Cas but stops when he can feel Cas’s uncomfortably.
But now Cas brings his books on week nights that isn’t karaoke nights (thursday and saturdays) to sit up at the bar and study. He began the fall semester full time, majoring in history. Because of course he’s curious in just how much people really know about their pasts. Sure he knows a lot but he’d never tell them any different unless he could find proof to dispute it.
Cas hesitates “No- I mean… I’m not sure what I was expecting” Dean just nods, understanding.
It’s day 43 of Cas missing.
Dean gasps, this isn’t real. He knows it deep down he knows it's the siren playing with him but he wants to live in this bubble.
Cas smiled “We found a surrogate. Her name’s Iris, she’s not a parent herself but she said she’d been blessed with easy childbirth and has had four other surrogate kids. She’s quite wonderful actually, very bubbly and she teaches kindergarten.”
Dean looks at the time on his phone, “uh he should be done his last exam by now…” he says as he’s already finding Jack’s contact in his phone.
“Will he be okay?” Dean asked.
“I love you so much” Cas whispers against Dean’s lips.
“Oh? Then what have you guys been doing?”
“Yeah probably but-”
He was brought back to earth as the song was ending and he quietly excused himself away from Jo to go catch up with Cas. Cas bounces down off of the makeshift stage and down beside Charlie where they both fall into fits of laughter as Dean approaches.
“Thanks” he smiles easily.
“It’s killing me too sweetheart” Dean added before he kissed his forehead. Sam’s voice then echoed through the speakers “Can you guys hear me?”
Cas was taken hostage by other vampires. Ones that they hadn’t seen before. Dean realizing that this had been a trap all along.
Dean nods in excitement,  “Alright. Let me finish up here then me and sam, we’ll head out” he says before bending back down to tightening up a loose bolt.
“Dean why would he kiss you and still stick around. But he saw into your head and he’s gone?”
“How bout I order us some food?” Dean suggests.
They end up compromising deciding to leave at 4 am. Enough time for Dean to get his few hours of shut-eye and for Sam to be comfortable on the highway. They’re getting cranky in their old age, Dean realizes their bickering went on for 45 minutes. But still, he feels some sense of purpose seep through him once again.
Cas snaps his head from the TV to look at Dean, “Why do you say it like that?”
“No-no it’s fine I had plans I kinda forgot about, I’m gonna be in deep shit.”
The second Dean hears the click of the knob, Dean turns to pull Cas in for a kiss. It’s desperate and apologetic and sincere. He pushes Cas down into the mattress as Cas kisses him back, his hands rubbing at Dean’s waist as Dean holds him so so tight.
“Don’t start T-O-D without me! I’ll make popcorn!” then he’s gone.
“But um me and Sam are about to head out on a hunt we’ll be back in a couple of days.”
“My whole family calls me Cas so it’s weird to always be called Castiel. I’m just telling you.”
Jack tilts his head while squinting, kinda like what Cas would do. There’s a table between them but Dean feels like the guy is as close to him as he can get.
They also started making friendships with others, Dean becoming friendly with the regulars and making business deals with locals around the block. He could feel them becoming apart of the community as they were invited to dinners, bbq’s and friendly bowling night’s. (Dean sucked so bad but Cas did pretty well to keep them afloat)
“Hey, buddy!”
“What? When?!” Jack gasps.
“I know that but-”
When Dean finally makes it to Sam he offers his thanks “Sorry if I’m stealing your thunder this weekend. I didn’t know when we’d be back.”
“But Dean I don’t think he’s in Heaven. Sounded like he was in a busy city like New York or maybe London.”
“Jack I’m so sorry” Dean pleads, keeping his distance.
Life continues on.
Jack lets out an irked sigh “Me and Gabriel— he’s human. We were walking to the party and she showed up. I had to erase Gabe’s memory cause he was too busy panicking, I sent him to the party, said my aunt from Sanfran was here to give me an update on my dad. He bought it and left but she cornered me in an alley. She told me I had to come with her, that it was my obligation to Heaven to help. Repay Heaven for what my father has done all these years…”
But as he fit the key in, there was a quiet knock from the passenger window.
When Cas finally lets go of Jack, Dean scoops him into a hug “Thank you Jack. This is- a lot. Too much really.”
Dean opens his eyes to Sam hanging over his head. He jerks away “What the hell Sam?!”
“I fed her already and she passed out at about- What time is it?” Cas yawns.
He unlocked the driver's seat with the keys that never leave his pocket and slammed the door behind him. Draping his arms over the steering wheel and resting his forehead on the horn.
“We’re not even done! Now for the best part. The basement!”
Dean struggled to get the words out, instead handed Claire the key.
With Cas’s human thing it makes no sense to Dean no matter how he tries to spin it. He’s been human his whole life and it’s shitty plain and simple. But if that’s what Cas wants then he’ll be damned if he can’t help in some kind of way.
Dean grimaces but wields his machete to chop off branches and cobwebs. He checks behind him every so often to see that Cas is still following. All of them are sweating like crazy in the heat, not used to it at all. Sam and Dean are both in jeans and t-shirts but have their flannels tied around their waists. While Cas is sweat soaked through his flannel and has torn the left leg of his jeans. They’re also dirty beyond hell from trying to locate the vamps in a junkyard a few miles away. But Cas wears the grit and sweat well, except Dean can’t let go of the thought of Cas having to take his shirt off. Focus Winchester.
CAS: We’re doing fine. Got back from a vampire hunt day before yesterday.
Dean could taste the salty tears rolling down his cheeks, could hear the soft patter of rain on the windshield and he could feel the wind of Cas’s eyelashes all in one heartbeat. He sighed, bunching his fingers into Cas's sweater. Feeling him, knowing he's there here's real. The tiny bit of light from the front porch catches the wedding band on Cas's hand and twinkles, Dean lets out a low exhale “god I love you so much Cas."
“Cas?” He says quieter.
“Dean?”
“I’ve been listening in on Angel radio and it all makes sense now,” Jack says stalking closer to Naomi “You knew and you needed Dean to come up here so you lured me with the threat!”
JACK: and my prof said I could retake the test and he’d only take off 20 points after whatever I got.
Sam sighs, “For what it’s worth. You deserve to have someone too.”
“You found him already?!”
“Is he dying then?”
Cas snorts, “It’s just a cartoon.”
JACK: Yes I know I’m number 1.
“Probably saw too much alright. Freaked him out.”
He tries to do some quick thinking but all of a sudden there’s a commotion at the end of the hallway. Naomi turns to the door as the ringing of Angel’s being killed hums throughout the room. But before she can even turn on her heels, she’s vanished from the room.
“Alright. Goodnight, love you both.”
Sam is currently in Sioux Falls. Has been for three days because Dean is trying to self implode and Sam can’t stick around to watch it. Dean knows this.
“We’re not watching another fucking Adam Sandler movie Cas!” Dean demands, biting his piece of pizza aggressively.
“Bye Sammy.”
There’s quietness between them before Sam says “So now what?!”
The first thing out of the twin’s mouths when they arrived was that they wanted Cas to tell them a story every night before bed. Even Sam told Cas neither of them would shut up about it.
“Bitch.”
Cas: Gotta run. More water to hand out and old ass papers to check on. Love you.
Dean looks at Cas who says, “As if I would say no.”
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry Jack. Cas isn’t here. Hasn’t been for a few days.”
“20-minute walk”
Dean nodded before looking over at Cas, “yeah I guess. But Cas got a promotion at the museum. He has his own business cards now” Dean said while pulling one out of his wallet.
“Fuck you!”
One of Naomi’s goons picks him up by the arm, hoisting him to kneel properly and lookup. Naomi steps closer to Dean, as he tries to inconspicuously pick his knife out of his belt loop, gritting his teeth through the pain.
She rambled on about how not excited she was to be back at school but Dean didn’t listen to her as he just watched the blue-eyed kid from across the room. How his skin had a sun-kissed glow, how his green dress shirt and tie made him look too formal for high school. How his lips puckered with every line and letter he noted onto his piece of paper.
Dean realizes he’s flush against Cas’ body. His hand tight around Cas’ wrists, pinning him to the wall. He can see every shade of blue in Cas’ eyes, the way he’s got freckles dusted over his nose, the way his tongue darts out and licks over his chapped lips.
DEAN: Good.
“Dean I have to apologize too…” Cas begins “You’re just- so full of life. You’ve had so much experience in this world in such a short time I guess I felt a little jealous. While I've been here for billions of year and never thought once to maybe indulge in what humans were creating right in front of me. Not until you."
Castiel shifts uncomfortably like he wants to magically poof away. So Dean takes this as his cue, “Actually I need to apologize too.”
“Thanks,” Cas says still trembling.
“Tell me about it” Dean scoffs.
The view was absolutely stunning, rolling hills that seemed to go on forever. The sun disappearing over the horizon with a mix of yellow and oranges. If Dean was more prepared he would’ve proposed to Cas right then and there. Instead, he had snapped a few photos of the orange and pink sky, before gesturing for Cas to put his head next to his. In the camera their heads were almost pure silhouettes but Dean kissed him on the cheek as Cas’ face scrunched up. He snapped a quick picture before Dean was kissing him properly and snapped another. He never thought he was the corny-romantic type, but he’s had a collaged of both photos as his lock screen ever since.
Dean furrows his brows, “But you're a full angel again isn’t food funny tasting?”
Jack wipes at his tear stain cheeks and nods along, hearing the words well Dean just hopes he’s getting the message.
“Okay well I wanna watch Frozen that’s my pick,” Cas says, undoing the footrest.
Cas sighs, pulling him into his side, “It means you care Jack. That’s it. You make mistakes, you learn, you grow, that’s the point. You being this upset means you care, that’s all.”
But as quick as it came it also went.
Dean scratches at the back of his neck, “Yeah, don’t mention it.”
Every night when they’d come home Dean or Cas would take turns cooking, the odd time having a kid or two help. They’d eat, have the girls fill out their journals they had to do for school and then get ready for bed.
“Maybe you’re toxic behavior is why Jack hasn’t come around either!” Sam’s voice booms throughout the garage. Dean stops mid-step, Sam’s voice ringing in his ears. “Fuck you Sam” he bellows then slams the door on his way out.
“Huh?”
“They don’t say fuck in Europe?”
“Yeah but the both of you-” Sam’s voice drips with haste “were freaking out cause neither of you know how to act without powers. You've both lost your grace before I really don't-" Sam sighs "never mind. Not worth it."
“I’ll tell you every day from now on.”
“Well I know you’d understand the reference and I’ve had my knee on your hard dick. Would it not be fair to say it to you?”
Sam stops from exiting the kitchen, “Yeah?”
“Yeah practically begged me to come” He giggles and it’s the cutest noise Dean has ever heard in his life. Okay so maybe Jo has been up to something and maybe tonight was about making the right kind of memories and not barely escaping death ones.
Jack started blushing as Gabe encouraged him to speak “Gabe was the delivery guy at the smoothie shop where Sebastian, my old roommate worked. I’d only been at school for a week and then Seb left his keys one morning and asked if I could bring them over. When I got there, Gabe was leaning against his truck waiting for Seb to open the doors. I wanted to make sure Seb was okay before Gabe asked me a few questions. Who I was. If I went to Stanford. If I liked cinnamon rolls. Then he asked me if I wanted to walk down the street to grab one. I told him I only just met him. That he’s a stranger and could have bad intentions.”
“You okay?” Jo had said as Dean stared into the corner of the room where Castiel sat.
Dean hits play and retreats to his own recliner also flipping up the footrest. This isn’t quite what Dean had imagined for this room, but it’s a start. He’ll take it.
Dean now shot Jack a look “Not helping.” The girls giggled off to the side behind their hands.
“Right yes. Nice to meet you too. First impressions aren’t my greatest skill.”
Jack beckons them to follow to a staircase between the kitchen and the front office, hidden behind a door.
Dean looked at Cas “Um. We’re not too sure…?”
“What?! Why? What happened?”
“Sure, that sounds lovely.”
DEAN: Come home.
They begin to walk as Cas calls Jack well Dean texts Sam that they landed fine.
Dean tapped at his shoulder, not wanting to hurt him anymore than he already was but it was met with earnest eyes. They chatted aimlessly about Sam’s diagnosis and his recovery schedule before Cas was wheeled in by a nurse, clutching his few personal items. Dean was by his side in an instant, helping him to his feet.
“I know it’s not you Cas!” He shouts harshly, the words burning his tongue.
They’d been through so much the last few months, Dean couldn’t believe he was only now panicking over this. During the time he could be spending with his nieces and his brother and his sister-in-law, and even Jack. But his mind kept curling itself around the same accusation. Pulling out memories he thought he had long forgotten. Moments from his childhood that a 5-6-7-8-year-old kid should never have had to see or hear or deal with.
They enjoy their time together, hunting or not. They were finally experiencing something they both had wanted for so long. Dean felt the need to pinch himself every morning.
Dean looks at him and snorts “Such a smartass.”
Cas nods still nursing his beer, “Yeah that's fair.”
It took a second for the words to click, Jody shook her head twice before running up to both of them quietly screaming to hug them both.
“Plus I look at Jody like a sister already so it wouldn’t be much different if they got together.”
“You can do it. He’ll be happy to see you.”
“You ain’t subtle about the fact that you look for someone, even when we’s in the hallway just walkin’ and talkin’ you just look for someone. Always lookin’.”
Dean shifts uncomfortably. Mary came back to earth for 4 years, but then passed due to a botched incident when they killed God, a little over a month ago (A point where Sam and Dean decided they could finally slow down). It’s still very fresh in Dean’s mind but Cas checks in on her every so often making sure she remains at peace. That’s the only thing that keeps Dean sane.
Dean turns to Cas who’s smiling even though he’s in so much pain. Dean squeezes his hand tighter “Is this… what you want?”
DEAN: Hey whoa. You know you could tell him you miss him. He’d come see you in a second flat.
Jack squeezes Dean tighter, “Thank you for letting me stay.”
Dean chokes on his beer.
“Shudda up. I’ll be back.”
Naomi pauses before looking over her shoulder at Cas before turning back to Dean, “You’ve been feeling him lately haven’t you?!”
“Like I could leave without you, Samuel!” Dean shouts but Sam’s already out of the room.
Dean lets out a sigh of relief, “Okay that’s good. Um, you know I’d be there in a heartbeat if I could buddy but I-”
“So it’s not a problem?” Cas asks again looking 2 seconds away from flapping out of the room.
Four days later they’re on a hunt in Arizona, looking for a vamp den somewhere in the middle of the desert. They come across tall red rock mountains, bushes, and cacti all in small clusters over hills of red dirt. Sam spots the car that one of the vampires had gotten into with what they assumed was their next feed.
“For now” Cas smirks.
“Sorry. Sorry” Jack gasped, wiping at his eyes. Dean pulled him into a hug on instinct, he had seen the kid before him and Gabe had went off to Washiongton state but hadn’t heard much since then.
Jack lets out a shaky exhale, “I didn’t tell you that when we tracked him... I could see him.”
Naomi stalks up to him, “You have some of his grace. You both triggered it to be a permanent tie somehow. Castiel’s grace won’t leave his body till he gets it all back.”
Dean watched as Cas shook the mans hand “Nice to meet you as well. We’ve heard alot about you, nice to put the face to the name.”
“Dean” a monotone voice speaks and Dean could recognize that voice from miles away.
Cas takes a deep breath “Is it bad to think that how Jo dared me to kiss you that I kind of really wanted to?”
“Better be. But we’ve handled worse Sammy.”
Dean is careful in walking into the room, not wanting to wake and spook the kid. But it’s such a sad sight, Dean’s heart feels like it's shattering with every step he takes, slowly taking a seat on the edge of the bed and putting a hand on Jack’s back.
JACK: Ok.
Hannah and Sadie were off at school, Jody let them miss the bus to say hello but then dropped them off on her way to the station.
“Go,” she said to him while pulling the phone from his hand.
“If you need anything. You ask alright?”
The fake annoyance in Cas’s eyes melted away as he pressed his mouth to Dean’s is a quick sentiment of love, but when Cas pulled back all he said was, “I can’t wait to tell them.”
Both Dean and Cas gasp at the same time and when Dean looks over at Cas he’s beaming. Like the sun would pop right through his eyes and stars would fall from his mouth.
“Is this everything you wished for?” Dean asked.
Dean doesn’t know how to process that message. But curls into bed and lays on his side, staring at the concrete walls of his room. Dad huh? The worst part is that it doesn’t scare him as much as he thought it would.
His heart swells for like the eightieth time that night and his palm begin to sweat. So much of this scenario reminding him of the first time he laid eyes on Cas earlier this school year.
Dean chuckles “Alright go get back to work. Only focus on work.”
Jack shakes his head “too late. It’s your home. Everything you need plus it’s only 20 minutes from the bar. Everything is moved out of your upstairs apartment. I thought Cas you could use it as an office? If that museum archiver position pans out then you’re gonna need a space?”
JACK: Yeah yeah thanks guys *green heart emoji*
Cas coughs snapping Dean out of his thoughts, “Jack had to de-age himself when he met his biological father briefly. It was very quick though and they won’t have much of a relationship. But he'll continue to get a sum of money that will help him live a comfortable life and I have some very cute pictures of Jack as a toddler” Cas beams.
Sam and Cas go quiet.
“It makes sense and it’s something I feel passionate about. So why not right?”
Sam returns four days later.
“Not in so many words but I believe he’s safe for now.”
Dean coughs “Um hey before you poof outta here, I just wanted to reply to you for what you said before… that y’know- I love you too kiddo.”
“His other dad?” Sam snorts.
“I don’t like it one bit. But he’s coming home for the weekend, we’ll talk to him.”
“Wanna try?” Sam says nodding at Dean to pass Cas the bowl.
He’s stealthy in snapping a photo and sending it to an online photo album he already set up. Already excited for the day that Grace is old enough to appreciate these keepsakes.
“We’re not all perfect babe,” Cas replied before leaning in to kiss him.
“I miss you” He tries to say but nothing comes out.
“I’m going with Jody” He stated.
Dean almost choked on his water “Wow that’s- you must be ridiculously smart.”
“We were leaving the bar to go to some party a couple of blocks away when she appeared right in front of us.”
Cas grins “The Leia to my Han” and god Dean doesn’t think we could love more. He laughs as he kisses Cas’s cheek “I love you so much Cas.”
DEAN: It’s alright kiddo. Did you figure it all out?
Jack just nods.
“Oh that’s nice of you,” Jack adds.
Dean hugged him and wished him the absolute best. He knew he was making the right choice.
“I didn’t think I had it in me either, but I know what I want. So can I get your help?”
“That’s mighty assumptive,” Dean stands, heading to the mini-fridge. Cas finishes his beer, “Pass me one?” he asks. “Yeah sure.”
Dean turned the bend and shit-- if Sam didn’t send him pictures he wouldn’t have believe it period.
Dean isn’t convinced but Jack doesn’t sound overly panicked “So what else did he say?”
“Huh?”
They both exit the car, Dean coming up next to Cas to hold his hand. It’s chilly out with the wind, so it’s a good thing they’re both in their coats. Dean’s in his signature navy zip up. And Cas in the same style, but with less pockets and green colored.
Dean was a little worried from the beginning that maybe they would still have run ins with apocalyptic scenarios but nothing ever arose. And with Sam gone now most days, Dean and Cas decided to only look into local cases. Things that would have them back in their own beds in less than 48 hours, so that kept them at home more often than not.
More tears fall from Dean’s cheek and land on Cas’s frail hand. Dean’s vision is so blurred he’s wiping away aimlessly but more only keep falling. “Cas— you mean more to me than anything I’ve ever had. I’m lost without you. Come back to me you stupid stupid smartass.”
Dean was glad Sam encouraged him to get generators for the bar. “You can never be too careful Dean” Sam’s voice rang in his ears, and he was right. They were one of the few establishments on the block who could keep the lights and the freezers going. Everywhere else either had to shut down for the day or sacrificed an appliance, but Dean felt good in at least helping out whoever he could.
Dean stops, suddenly unsure of what he was going to say so all that comes out is, “I’m glad it's you that I’m here with.” At first, he wants to smack himself, but then the fond look that sparkles in Cas’ eyes, erase that whole feeling.
Then Sam clears his throat, “Speaking of Jack. Cas did you give him the books I found for him last week?”
“Go get some sleep Cas. I got her” Dean encourages. Looking down at his husband who looks 2 blinks from passing out again.
The bunker is the safest place for him with it being heavily warded against everything. Dean shouldn’t be so frantic but he can’t help it.
But Sam said nothing. He was sopping wet as he grumbled his way to his old room and slammed the door.
“I could feel it. It was… happy then it wasn’t.”
Jack’s phone starts ringing again.
“I’m glad you heard from him.”
“Hey Jack,” Sam says well smiling into the phone.
Dean falls silent for a second, grabbing at Cas’ hands to hold, “Cas you don’t… you don’t have to do that.”
Sebastian disappears into one of the two bedrooms as they start shuffling towards the door, pulling their coats and shoes back on.
Truthfully, he's aware he could probably get any girl in school but there was an issue and it wasn’t huge. It just made everything seem impossible and very lonely.
“Morning” Sam greets him as Dean mumbles something and heads to the coffee pot. “I think I found a case? You up for a road trip?” Dean sips at his mug, “Always.”
When he looks up, Cas is staring around the place confused.
“So?” Sam questions.
“Jack?” Prince Eric said.
“I dare you to kiss Dean Winchester.”
Cas pipes up to continue, “Um, but there is another reason that I’m here. I think I found a case. Four bodies of investors for a museum have shown up dead in the last two weeks. Sounds like a vengeful spirit.”
“I’ll text you when I find out what's going on,” Dean says in a hurry.
In all, that shut him up. So now here they are, bonding in the strange way the Winchesters know how to bond.
They stay there both just staring at the little one between them, snoring softly against Dean’s chest with her little hand grabbing onto his black pj shirt.
“Um” Jack begins, but Dean can hear Cas babbling about how the desk that they got is suddenly missing a wheel and fell over.
Sam’s features soften, and Dean hates the look of pity but fuck he had to ask.
Then Dean cut in, “Not sure why Jack wanted to give him a second chance considering the huge blow-up they had, which made Jack mope for months. But guess we’ll find out.”
DEAN: and if you feel you’re in trouble call us okay? I know I’m not much help but Cas can zap us over to you if needed.
Cas laughs then yawns as he curls into Dean’s neck “There's so much more I wanna talk about.”
Dean sits up, “What? How do you know that name?”
“He then what?”
Cas freezes “Oh… yeah the Cave. Dean, I don’t think I ever said how much that meant to me. Having those nights watching countless movies with you. I really wouldn’t trade it for anything.”
Dean was glad to be upholding that tradition.
“Oh, Cas I’m so sorry. I’m- I’m so sorry for being so angry with you, I- I should’ve looked for you I should’ve tried harder. I didn’t know- I thought… you hated me. That I was disgusting and selfish for…” He pauses “For loving you…” he gulps, finally he said it “I should’ve said something, we should’ve talked. But you know I’m not good with all that. Especially to you— god Cas.”
Sam wiped at his mouth while making an uncomfortable face, “Jack’s such a smart guy he shouldn’t be chasing after someone who’s gonna treat him poorly.”
“Hi, I just- I wanted to make sure you are alright you ran off pretty fast.”
“Hey, kiddo” Dean answers.
The tires screech as Dean turns off the side of the road. Pulling over as they follow the trails of footprints, up to a heavily bushed area. In the distance, there seems to be a rotting house.
“Tons, no party is better than a Harvelle party.”
“I didn’t think you made it?” Jack says, “I looked for you but I couldn’t find you?”
“It was the distance that affected them the most. Neither of them knew how to handle it, a break up was a better option,” Cas offered.
Dean showed the girls to their room, down the hallway from Dean and Cas’ bedroom. Explaining to them that if they ever needed anything that they knew where they needed to go. Jody also gave the girls each another lecture that they must’ve heard a thousand times based on their eye rolling.
“Oh my god, you guys are going to be the best parents!” She squealed while hugging them. Sam and Jack followed, offering hugs to the new future parents.
“Sam showed me how to put it on my phone. It sticks in your head” Cas replies.
“Okay then sure, I’ll tag along.”
Sam snorts sounding amused “He’s definitely your son.”
“Cas” Dean tries but it comes out in a desperate breath. Something that’s barely holding himself together.
Dean leaves swiftly, taking in a deep breath while making his way to the garage. When Cas goes all quiet like that regardless of conversation Dean always assumes he’s gonna leave. That he’s thinking of the best escape route to zap out of an uncomfortable situation. And yeah most of Dean’s life he’s wished he had that power but Cas does. And Dean hates that it’s the first thing he fears anytime something troublesome, awkward, or argumentative comes between them. But Dean pushes those thoughts aside as he steps into the garage to see Sam loading up a black 2011 mustang that Cas stole months ago.
