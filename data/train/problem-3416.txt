He completely ignored her presence as he continued to look at me, without taking his eyes off me for a moment. His soul touched mine, it was the first time I ever felt so close to him, It was the first time I felt this feeling; that moment, that look, just before he took his eyes off me, that very moment I felt the arrow of God Cupid go through my heart; fear and all these strange and new feelings had become one as I continued to look at him speechless; Cupid, why me; why me Cupid; The voice of the waitress was heard once again.
And he's alone.
A tear was slipping down his cheek, Cas ended up crying once again that day. How much pain can this person bear until he completely breaks down. He didn't even try to hide it, conceal his pain behind a smile or just change the topic.
Cas remains lost on Dean- in a positive way, of course.
. No matter how long he did though, he wasn't there. Maybe he was never real, maybe he was just a hallucination, a filthy game his mind was playing. He looked again, he breathed slowly.
passed, their loverall would still be there, but stronger. They would still be telling sweet words to one another.
‘'Okay chill out, I won't do it again.’’ He said with a grin, at that moment the door of the doctor's office opened and an elderly man with hoary hair walked out, greeting both of them. "At least for the next thirty minutes." Dean stated as he entered the office.
‘’I should thank you for everything.’’ Dean whispered above Cas' shoulder and whipped the tears from his face with quick movements. They remained there for a few more minutes, eliminating the possibility of someone opening the door and then having to give an explanation. Maybe Dean could escape from the window, Cas thought as he pulled away from Dean. He didn't want him to leave, he didn't want to lose him, he wanted him to stay with him - forever, as they deserve.
‘’We aren't...no, we aren't-you know...’’
‘’I'm writing my thoughts about you... I'm writing everything about you.’’ He whispered above his skin, making his heart flatter. ‘’Then why don't you let me read?’’ Cas whispered above Dean's lips.
He knows every detail, every tear, every promise, every word, every- he- he knows. And he first felt this feeling, this fucking feeling a long time ago... Years ago, many years ago. The night when Mary died. When John died, when Benny died, when Charlie died, when Bobby, Ellen and Jo died. He feels this feeling every time he is losing his baby brother. Sam. And about Cas... There's no words. There's no words to narrate how he feels when he is losing Cas, dead or not.
One thing is for sure.
the fears.
the nights.
summer... that is a few weeks from now...’’
I'm begging you, my dear-don't cry. Please, don't. I can't, no, no, no, I can't, my soul is in pain every time I notice tears embellishing his beautiful face. It hurts, it hurts, I'm in pain, my love. I'm drowning into his flood of tears, as he's drowning into my eyes, into my oceans, we're drowning into different earths. Ultimatelyn, are we going to find shore, our Ithaca? Are we going to find a place to rest at least for five minutes? If we don't, if we don't, my light, then... let's become the shore and live like this...
Dare to speak out, dare to become acquainted with the storms in their eyes, to fill up the voids of your soul. But don't you dare raise a shield to defend yourself, set your heart free.
He was about to speak but Dean stopped him. So many insecurities.
He is so beautiful.
However, by having Dean by his side, even the Fall seems like nothing. Like the most
"I'm see you won't believe me due to my terrible behaviour- I know I'm an asshole...A fucking dick. But- but, I'm being more than honest with your right now... I miss you. I truly and completely miss you." He was holding a flower he picked up while walking down the hill.
Maybe some of you think it's quite early for such thoughts, such words, such actions... But the sad truth is that life is too short for second thoughts, to doubt about the next step. Should you sense that the person standing in front of you is the one, go on. Don't be afraid, will you? Don't give up. Dare to be carried away by the chaos, dare to get lost in the mesmerizing eyes of the person.
One of those days his father unveiled to him his greatest dream. He wanted to live along a beautiful lake, with crystal clear waters with his mother (who unfortunately passed away due to the Spanish flue and they nearly lost Castiel too) until salinity. Blasting the music to the radio and dance for hours. Her weaving and him fishing and later in the evening she would join him for company. That's how their life would roll.
His happiness was long lost.
A smile which would break every heart.
Back to us.
“Have you been married with my cousin for a year, right?” He asked me avoiding looking at me.
‘’Until
‘’If you drown, I'll save you.’’ He heard Dean's voice.
Maybe it's not a goodbye in reality, but a "until we meet again" or a "au re voir" . A promise, which he attempts to hold onto. That this is not a final goodbye, but a "see you again".
“Perhaps more frequently than I should” I responded with a very low tone, my eyes on him.
This is Dean.
‘’What do you mean?’’ His curious tone made Dean release a chuckle.
Believe in the beauty of this story.
‘’Don't tell me you don't know.’’
He had time. He had enough time to end things.
But no matter how much or how loud he would shout "I love you", "I love you so much", "I fucking love you", he would not receive a reply, and he craved to hear his voice again.
Sam asked Castiel odd questions. And then he had a question for everyone. ‘’I have a question.’’
‘’I'm
‘’This story is somewhat longer than you think, you know…
Just look at each other until past midnight or until the first light of day, until the sun comes out behind the green and huge trees of the forest or until we see the first flower of spring born in spring rain... Until we hear the sound of the waves of the wild side of the sea as they strike with force and rage on the huge rocks, and then calm again.
“I know Sam. I'm so glad you are getting the chance to see your brother after all these years. You need to be happy that he is back safe and sound somehow... You need to be proud, you know, I'm proud of
Since once again. And for the first time after an extended period of time, they're alone. There wasn't a soul apart from them walking that alley. Just Cas and Dean.
I'm sorry for my behaviour earlier, for... kissing you without your will.’’ Cas glanced at him once again. He was about to answer in an indifferent manner, but he didn't.
Ultimately, only by losing someone in foreign oceans do you learn to value them, completely and with all your being. Just like Dean. He denied everything he felt for his glaucous-eyed angel. He shoved deep inside every will to hug him a little longer, to fall asleep on his shoulder, to go on a date with him, to stay up all night with him. He denied the will to kiss his sweet lips. He denied the will to touch his body, to feel his body. He denied everything.
He waited a few minutes, just to feel more calm. Just to feel more free. He reached for the bottle before he started his prayer.
I'm begging you to
‘’How come you're here?’’ He questioned without looking at him.
He was in teas too. With him. For him, they were crying for each other.

Hold on firmly. We have many oceans to cross.
He was soak from top to bottom. When he noticed the car, he let out a mere grim. Sam informed his friends that I would come and pick up Dean. I got out of the car so to give him a hand. He was carrying his staff and it was difficult for him to hold the scratches as well.
“I need you to be honest with me...You can't hide.” I said while I was trying to be strict, but we both left a quiet and small laugh about my last comment.

“I hope she loves you. Maybe she won't be able to – to help you forget— but there's a chance she will make you feel better.”
‘’Then, say it.’’ He demanded. ‘’Please, I need to hear you say it.’’ He
void feeling, which he loathes with all his being. He feels like this on a daily basis, and Dean, this poor man is trying. He's trying his best to establish a sense of comfort in Castiel's heart, to calm him down. It seems that both are suffering.
Oh, those devious
he finally fell asleep again. Even though they both
used to describe events from the war, stories about how they met,
If I remember correctly, his name was Benny, he died a few months before the end of the war, he died two weeks after Dean's accident...well, Dean hurt himself in an attempt to save his friend.
Late March 1946
He was told that love is a pure and painless thing.
“For your information...” he initiated his sentence with a raised tone, not caring about someone noticing.
She wasn't able to, but she would attempt to do it. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath before she started.
And yes. I know. I know I lost him
“You don't have to worry. You are too young to think about these things yet. Go to sleep now, my love.” He whispered and kissed her forehead once again and then turned off the light of her bedroom.
I helped Dean take a sit, he just glanced at me. “Thanks” he uttered with a silent tone barely audible to me. I sat right across him on the other side of the table, now being face to face with him and waiting for a waiter to serve us. He had rested his upper body on the table, giving me the impression, he wanted to sleep. Out of the blue, he casted an eye over me. The weariness in his beautiful face was apparent.
He was in pain.
... that's why you
Maybe three weeks is nothing for someone else but for him it meant a lot. Once again in the library, the place where they could escape from everyone and everything and where they used to stare at the beautiful moonlight and the few stars embellishing the cloudy sky. Afterwards, it was the raindrops, which were falling calmly upon the trees and the blossoms of the garden while they were exchanging either kisses or hugs and sometimes Cas was just observing every move of Dean's.
“No, no and again no, Cas. I don't give a damn.”
She had no clue that her father was used to spending his nights whether looking at the stars with a sorrowful gaze or with a blurred view of the distant woods- they reminded him of his eyes- or staring at the road waiting for him to come back home.
‘’I remember during that time... We hoped he would get better... so did the doctors-but...then he started getting worse...’’
“Do I look like I need help? And you don't need to do whatever crap people tell you to do. On the contrary you don't give a fuck.” He said, he was getting angry again.
Concerning Lisa, she is ecstatic and overly excited. Every time she passes by, she doesn't miss to talk about the wedding and Dean. Espiaclly for Dean. She love him so much.
‘’He's a... friend of mine.’’ He wouldn't be the groomsman at their wedding ultimately, Dean didn't want him to and now he understands the reason why. It would be painful for both.
Dean took glances of him all the time like the first day they met, that night, a slight
He didn't believe that he was so desperate, but it wasn't the first time he had tries to communicate with him, it was not the first time he had prayed the last days. He is so fucking desperate just to know his loved one isn't gone.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.

But Dean is
singular number,
“I doubt” He refused my own opinion about myself, while taking another sip of his drink... “You seem really fascinating to me” His face was undeniably charming. He makes mw feel safe and sound only with the sound of his unique voice.
“Do you get lost too...?”I started saying “In your thoughts?” I asked him but he didn't answer immediately.
Was he really about to lose his father?
‘’Sounds like a good idea. Morning or evening?’’
“Castiel... I understand you might care about me... But— I guess my mother told you to do so, to "protect" me... But why?” I couldn't answer. I started to panic and feel more anxious. I just want the ground to open up and swallow me.
And... plainly with the thought of someone seeing them. But as it seemed Dean didn't really bother. He lost himself in Cas, for one last time. They kissed one more time, and another one, they kissed open-mouthed, they concealed their passion, their fears, their insecurities, their everything into a soft kiss. The nostalgia was there, the desire to experience what they felt.
“Don't say sorry”
‘’Here you are.’’ He said when he got close to them and offered the package to Lisa. ‘’Thank you so much, Castiel. It's my wedding gown, you know. We have a dress rehearsal tomorrow! And I can't wait. And Dean, please, you have to go and buy a costume, our wedding is two weeks away and you aren't ready yet.’’
, tears in their eyes.
or you don't want to be saved.
Cas looked at Dean in a peaceful manner and kissed his lips. ‘’Go on… just go on saying or doing whatever you want...just go on.’’ He wanted, even for a slight moment, to let go in Dean's lips, his touch, even inch of him.
God, you are so stupid if you still have hope Dean. Cas...Cas isn't a human being. Cas can't feel. He, he can't. He is an freaking angel of the Lord. He can't love me the way I wanting him to love me.
After a few minutes, Dean was about to make his farewell and say
''What are you writing?'' He asked not looking at him. Dean just glimpsed at him, as he usually does to silence him even just for a short moment.
‘’I know, but- I want you here.’’
“How you know if I'm alright or not? How you know if I'm capable to lift a fucking little shit. I can do this you know. I'm not completely worthless piece of shi—”
and then plural:
made its way to his lips and averted his gaze, now looking at the sea.
That he never found the courage to tell his angel how much he loved him. That he was his happiness, his tomorrow.
“Tell me something new...” His eyes were on the road. He was so tired to talk, to do something. I could feel it. He needed rest and a few moments of peace. His gaze moved outside the window for a few more minutes. It might have been a way for him to calm down himself. And then his eyes were on me - he couldn't stop looking at me.
The fear,
Filled with chaos. Like it was narrated to her years ago. A chaotic love story.
I tried to break the ice or maybe more correctly I tried to feel more comfortable.
state exacerbated, his sorrow had accumulated inside him, the weight on his chest became heavier, it was unbearable, he couldn't stand it anymore.
’’ He answered.
“He is not coming! Oh, my Lord! This fucking little bastard! I swear Marry I'm going to kill him” Marry tried to calm John down by telling him that maybe something happened, or it is just Dean denying following the rules. John calmed down a bit. Marry gave him a warm smile while signaling him with her gaze to drink a little water from his glass.
‘’I believe so… until the wedding at least… ‘’ He answered taking a sip of his wine and withdrew from the table, saying he's tired.
And finally we'll learn if death can really separate two connected people. If Love is capable of defeating everything.
Together.
as he opened the door of the house.
‘’Don't cry.’’ A kiss on the lips, following one on his forehead. ‘’
A minor smile slipped from his dry lips, his smile is distinct and unique, the sound was soft to my ears. I can feel it. I can clearly feel all the emotions buried deep inside my heart. He is unique-not only due to his smile-but due to him being himself. I don't know much about him yet but I can feel it in me.
“Give me your stuff” I offered and moved my hand to his suitcase and a few more things... His smile was gone, I think I made him uncomfortable with...with his problem...
‘’So you're going to leave me?’’ Cas concluded from Dean's words, his tone anxious. Dean left a kiss on his lips, he had to depart, the sun had already started to rise above the enormous mountains and if someone saw Dean step out out of the library or Cas... if someone caught them together, especially if that person was John, they would get into huge trouble. Amelia couldn't justify Cas' overnight in the library anymore.
“I'm not sure whether I should say it to you or not, I think I'm running out of time...” she stopped, she did have time, but she was afraid to remeber...
The rest of the time passed so quickly that the only thing they left behind is obscure memories. Finally, the organization which had taken place the recent days came to an end. The anxiety levels are high for everyone, including me. Making new acquaintances always seemed quite stressful for me, it gave me an overwhelming sense of awkwardness and anxiety, an accurate illustration of my current feelings.
I felt at home, where I felt secure and free, where I felt like myself again, where I could read for hours and hours the dusted and forgotten books which hadn't been touched for a long time.
This story originates from the depths of the abyss.
And ultimately,
Don't stop staring at me.
passionate kiss on his lips as he adjusted the sheet to cover their bare bodies. One more night in the library. He's wondering how come no one has walked in on them yet, after all these months, all these nights, all these moments. It's a wonder that no one has woken up by their hidden chuckles, the sighs, the cries…
And I missed his gaze on me.
“Alright then... A story about soulmates...but it's not mine, you know...it belongs to—to someone I knew” she gave in and made them even more excited.
I love you,
I tried to refrain from thinking such things and kept gazing at him silent. I have said this countless times before and I will continue saying this. His eyes. His beautiful, emerald eyes. They make me travel forests, which I desire to explore, every corner and puddle.
‘’Yes, as you see, but
‘’Yes, yes...the real problem is that dad doesn't want me to marry her.’’ He complained with a sorrowful voice.
I averted my eyes to the road once more, maybe it was the feeling of concern that made me do it. Dean has yet to arrive. He should have been here at least half an hour ago. The train station is not far away from here. If you wake up early in the morning and get out of the house you are likely to hear the train travelling on the railway, or even the hustle and bustle of the city which is approximately one kilometer away from here. The more the minutes are passing by, the more I'm getting accustomed to the fact that I am going to meet Dean. I can say that I even feel merely excited to meet him. I'm looking forward to getting to know his personality, learning more than I am already aware about. But, obviously, why would he like to meet me rather than his wife? What's the intriguing part in me which would urge him to get to know me?
He sounded nostalgic, Cas had talked to Dean about his father. ‘’Did your father teach you how to fish?’’
We finally arrived home inside the beautiful yard. After I had parked John's car to its usual place, I was about to pick up his staff, unlike him who didn't move a muscle, his stare locked on his parent's home. Perhaps this is due to his stress after returning home after all these years, I am able to sense his anxiety, fear and impatience as well. So many emotions...
, they're
"I know you miss me, too." He laughed. More tears. God, he is crying. He is really crying and trying to believe the fucking truth. He is crying and he is a really big idiot. Cas-
‘’No. No, he didn't. Who would have the brains to love someone like me?’’ She was about to say something but Castiel stopped her. He took a deep breath before continuing, he was talking slowly but he knew they had time. John might be occupied with Sam and the girl he brought home. And since he hasn't heard his infuriated voice yet, they have time.
since I last felt free... and at the moment, here with you-’’
Maybe she was right. They don't have a future together.
"I missed you so much, Cas." He said without thinking. He miss his angel. He was driving. God, how he can? How he keeps going? "So, so much." he cried in his heart. In his broken heart.
I love you, I love you, do you hear me? I do and I will do so forever- as much as great or indescribable forever sounds, with you by my side? It will be like an alternative – to love you more, it will be
And I don't want to. He is my anchor, my everything. After all, we will spend the afterlife together, like we are meant to be.
But what about this particular story?
Marry approached me. “Castiel, we are going to be in the living room in case you search us... It seems like Dean won't be here anytime soon..” The tone of her voice while uttering the last words was an indicator of her disappointment and concern. My lips formed a friendly smile so as to make her feel even a bit better, but I'm uncertain of the outcome.
‘’Um- of course, uhh-let's go. I guess I'll see you soon Gabriella. Greetings to dad... tell him that I love him.’’ Said Castiel and pulled her into a hug. She returned the hug and whispered softly above Cas' shoulder ‘’I approve him, he's fine and looks like he has a kind soul.’’ Those were her last words before she approached a car which apparently belonged to her husband.
The fears
I admired the sky as I used to do when I was five years old, the same feeling. So many beautiful colors; light blue, soft pink and coral while deep inside you could distinguish an odd yet impressive color created by the mix of yellow and purple. My lips formed a smile as I took a glance of the last shade, when darkness came to substitute the natural palette of the sky.
This is how their lives would roll.
‘’Actually,... we're going to
‘’Anything you say.’’ He replied plainly and continued puffing on his cigarette.
This definitely Dean.
And they went on gazing across the horizon. With all the enchanting colours of the sunset which kept them company.
He deserved love.
How much he wants him close to him. It might be early to say all these things and carry such emotions, but one in love doesn't think too much.
Dean is alone. So, so alone.
‘’But he indeed loved you, didn't he?’’ She asked being intrigued to know the real answer. He just chuckled before going on with his story, a slight and painful chuckle, Amelia understood that Castiel had already been broken, long before Dean entered his life.
so great.
Dean, he can't imagine his life without him.
‘’I remember when we first visited London.’’ Started Gabriella with her voice threatening to break. ‘’You were seven and such a pain in the ass. Throughout the whole trip you were babbling about some frogs grandma had told you about you wanted to see. You wouldn't shut your mouth.
He took a deep breath. He was ready. Finally he was ready. "I'm sorry f-for never finding the courage to confess how much I love you." His heart broke again with this fact. ( He looked around, hoping to see his Angel, but he wasn't there, he wasn't. )
I broke the kiss and my eyes dove into his and my forehead was touching his forehead gently. He was looking at me with an anxious gaze, for some seconds I thought that he would stand up and leave or that he would do something else but I couldn't be more wrong... He smiled as I gained the courage to place my palms on his cheeks and my lips on his. It lasted for a few seconds when he moved away and left a soft kiss on my lower lip.
is the purest, the most innocent, the most exquisite feeling he could foster towards someone. She told him to foster this feeling.
"I love you!I love you so so much... Do you hear me? I love you!" he said weakly.
“Mommy! Mommy! Tell us a bedtime story!” the little girl bigged her mother loudly. The boy seemed way more excited as he was the one who told his elder sister to ask their mother to tell them a story.
“You really need to rest.” I said slowly as I looked at him for a moment. He was so broken inside, and he is trying too hard to not saw how much pain he feels. He smiled nervously.
‘’I don't think they're able to think yet.’’ He whispered on the verge of falling asleep.
‘’But?’’ Asked Sam with curiosity as he took a bite from his salad.
“I found it here when I first came... he had just built it...” I uttered, my eyes on the tree house, not many times have I been there. No one visits it anymore. Not even Sam. He has completely forgotten its existence. It lies there lonely, awaiting to be filled with warm voices and laughters.
In him.
Alone.
single human
The next minutes passed fast, various discussions. Some of them concerning their father's condition, others concerning their plans when winter arrives. Gabriella is planning on emigrating to America with her husband, since they can't land for a job here. He's a doctor, all the hospitals are full due to the was but the wage is not high enough to make ends meet, let alone feed a family. She's a mother of two children. An eight-year-old and a two-year-old. They may have a more prosperous future there.
Alive by his side.
Cas rubbed his nose with Dean's and placed his forehead on the latter's. This always made him
He stuttered with sorrow. ‘’I miss you-
They were the colours.
great to him.
Threre is
Dean had been driving for several hours, he embarked on this journey when the sun had started rising in the heavens. It was so difficult for him to started the day, to get ready for- it was difficult. He began driving in the morning with a heavy heart, he ached and it was far from evident. That he had to deal with lots of loses in his life, he lost someone he loved.
Eventually she understood. She grasped how much they loved each other. She concluded that home is not just a building, constructed of bricks and concrete. It can be a person too.
I want you to be here with me because
“Even if you are lost in your darkness
This day was one of the positive ones. Rarely does he feel so...
I feel like the man that is sitting next to me doesn't know for a few minutes, that he's not a stranger. No, I don't feel that way, I feel like I've known him for a million years. I feel like I know things about him, that he's a part of my heart, I feel like he's feeling exactly the same feeling. This connection, these storms that I feel every time his eyes fall on mine. Every time I look at him, and I'll never get tired of talking about him.
He had suffered a lot of hardship and the nightmares had yet to stop. Sometimes he goes theough his day without even talking, just a "yes" or a "no". Sometimes he cries nonstop and he can be heard from outside, that he was unable to save his friend. That he has no idea whether his friends from the war are safe and sound or not. Sometimes he locks himself in bedroom and doesn't even let Sam in.
‘’This is unfair, you know.’’ He complained, Cas glanced st him and then shifted his gaze to the road again.
The only thing he wished for was Cas being next to him, but he's gone.
A Nature's wonder.
During Castiel's wonderful
singular.
‘’No matter how much he loves you… his love for me is greater.’’ The thought I it hurt Castiel... ‘’
Because he isn't just his father. He's his best friend. The person he trusted his secrets with the most. It's him who he ran to when he first fell off his bike and injured his leg, the mark might still be there. They used to spend time together before Cas left to become a student. They drank tea while reading books, Castiel's father taught him how to play the piano and helped him with his homework. They would engage in interesting discussions concerning life and the future. When he was younger, a teenager specifically, they would buy ice cream or milkshake and talk about how their day rolled.
This common man he truly loved. The memory of the night he almost left as if he was being hunted jumped in his mind.
And I always want you to remember that,
The breeze always exists even though you are unable to see or touch it
''Nothing that concerns you.'' he stated. Cas knew he was lying. Sometimes he can understand whether he's telling the truth or not. And at that moment, he wasn't.
Jack let out an inaudible chuckle in the words of his niece. Because he
Nights had always been hard for Castiel since he was a child. He woke up from a nightmare he wasn't able to recall. His face was sweaty, ignoring the fact that it was late and he had to go back to sleep he got up and made his way to the kitchen to hydrate himself with a glass of cool water.
But he knows... He knows very well- He loves his embrace so much because it's the only place where he feels safe. Their embrace is their home. Their heaven. He is his home. He hasn't seen him for some weeks now, he's been lost recently. Thus the only way Castielcan bring him closer is their memories. To bring him into his hug. It's a way to feel his firm hold against his body to warm him up, not only him but his heart too.
This icy
Yes, and after Dean died, I still believe it. We are still one. And after I lost him, forever, he still owns my heart. As a matter of fact, Dean Winchester is my heart. But here, he is still alive. And he keeps smiling to me. He keeps kissing me and making me fall in love with him. He is still here. We are still one.
“I don't care about her. I don't even know her. Fuck... I mean...I know you better and we just have met. She is nothing for me. And about my father? He wants to be proud of me someway he thinks this is the right way. Guess what? It's not. I'm not in love with her, and if he thinks she would make me forget who – what I am he is wrong. No way she is going to make me fucking forget.”
? ‘’ She said, the tone of her voice indicating her exhaustion.
‘’He doesn't deserve it.’’ A sorrowful smile on their faces, they both reminisce their childhood memories.
My whole existence is jittering, cold sweat cover my forehead and I felt my mouth dry... My attempts to convince myself that everything is fine and that I am just going to meet another person proved vain. The fear has achieved to make its presence powerful and refuses to subside.
He didn't want to ask him what he saw. What's torturing him, he believed it was none of his business.
He believed in phantoms, he believed in the afterlife, he believed there was Hell and Paradise, he believed in God... I always laughed and made foolish comments about his beliefs... so that I could see him get a little angry with me or see his cheeks turn a deep shade of red.
Dean just stared at her before he spoke. ‘’You don't have to reveal everything you know!’’ He said and threw at her the slice of bread she threw at him earlier.
''Castiel, open up please, it's Amelia, you know it's eight o'clock... and we should be heading over to the town.'' Her voice sounded concerned, she was worried about Cas of course, she had barely seen him during this period of time.
For so many hours, he had been reminiscing everything concerning Cas, he recalls every single moment of theirs. Every memory of them.
‘’Are you going to leave now? Go to that house a few feet away from here?’’
going to leave you alone, you know that, don't you?’’ Dean stated and kissed his cheeck, avoiding to continue is previous sentence, Cas adjusted himself in Dean's arms.
His world is gone. And his heart.
He inhaled a deep breath before averting his eyes on me. Eventually, he gave up and nodded, which I received as an acceptance of my help. I knew that deep inside he was unwilling but it couldn't be otherwise. I opened his car door and strived to help him as the rain started getting stronger. I grabbed the package and placed him on the driver's seat. My next move was to help him. Even though the thought of not helping him flashed in my mind but I'm not that kind of person.
But you know how warmhearted

‘’I don't want to know what happened the next morning,

At that very moment, I stayed still, staring at him without saying anything, without thinking that maybe he would leave comment on my action. However, he didn't seem bothered, nor said anything offending for the time being.
“Yes—yes, I am... And–and you are Dean, aren't you–you?” I said timorously.
‘’What if I don't?’’ He said with a calmer voice, but the frustration, the sorrow and other emotions were boiling inside his flesh.
father,... I-’’ He kept looking at him, his gaze was fixed on him.
He looked around, murk, absolute darkness, the only trace of light in that library was stepping from the two candles he lit to keep him company as he drank one of his lover's favourite beverages. He gazed at the horizon through the window while smoking one if the ciggaretes he stole from Dean a few weeks ago.
They deserved this kind of life after going through fire and water.
“No... No... Castiel it's fine believe me. I'm fine” He refused.
Besides, I'm not going too far away.
The more the time passes by, the more impatient I become to see him. I'm terrified by the thought of getting to see his real side. Usually, people are totally different from how others illustrate them. We all hide a part of ourselves that we're not willing to show to the world. Maybe my real image is something terrifying. Hopefully they have the right impression of him.
This room owns a distinct part in my broken heart.
The sun embraced a little longer the meadow where the man lied in a pained state. Dean felt... indescribable emotions, which he would never be able to put into words, no one would. As the sun embraced the beautiful meadow with those small and unique blossoms, it seemed more impressive than ever. It was hiding behind the cotton covers from the sky which were steeped in colours reminding sea.
One of them left.
Pain. Pai. Pain.
‘’Thank you Castiel. At least you are kind gentleman, in the contrary with someone else.’’ She stated with her eyes on Cas and right afterwards averting them to look at Dean. He just ignored her sayings and went on smoking another cigarette.
him, his eyes shouted how much he needed Dean, as well as his heartbeat.
‘’End it. Put a damn end in whatever is going on between you and him. I don't care if you love him. Your love is a sickness and you're making him sick-’’
She placed her hand on his shoulder ‘’You don't have to feel bad or guilty, you really don't- you know and always knew that whatever happens you will still be my annoying little brother, okay?’’
Dean shouted 'I love you' a few times more and Cas was unable to hold back his ecstatic smile. But still he didn't reciprocate the phrase.
He inhaled a deep breath, one more, and he went on walking while staring at the sunset, the Sun vanishing behind those enormous trees, playing hide and seek with the colourful clouds. He couldn't think about anything else than that he miss Cas. "Yes. I-I miss you and- and I wish you were here, with me..." He didn't believe that he was 'actually' talking to him.
If you can call this a love story... I'm not sating it's not like one.
He can't do this.
But then again... nothing ever really ends, does it?
‘’This is what our parents used to say, Dean, in particular.
But he knew, he knew Dean was his.
They left this earth early and ran seeking for another one, they swam in unfamiliar seas, the reached unfamiliar shores, unfamiliar forests.
“Dean...you know I can help you if you let me...” His whole body was shivering while he was still in an attempt to find the right way to lift that damn package from the backseat but it was futile.
All alone. Without Castiel... He is emptiness. His other half isn't home. His other half is far away from him.
Tears were slipping from his worn out eyes. Tears of sorrow and mourn.
helpless.
to his amour. He leaned down to kiss him but Cas averted his head. He wasn't into his demeanour, he knew he became a child every now and then, but Dean was no exception.
‘’Well, you obviously are.’’ He said with an ironic tone.
Afterwards, he approached him, not fearing being seen by people around, no fear in him. He didn't fear anything. He took the cigarette from his lips and smoked.
“Yes-yes?” I said as I stated acct more apprehensively. His eyes are looking at me. His beautiful eyes.
Our souls were already connected. In all likelihood we were soulmates in our former lives. In this life, in this cursed life we live there are is neither hope nor happy ending in the lives of the condemned.
he whispered and left a soft kiss on his forehead, immediately letting himself in
And when my time of dying comes,
His best friend died; he was married with two children. A six-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl, Dean always talked about him and his wife in his letters. He cared about him and his family, not to mention he is one of the kids' god father. Sam said he was his best friend after he moved from here.
He knew Dean would be beside him even if he was with her. He was aware that Dean loved him despite his lack of courage to say it but he would take it in soon.
Will he ever see his love again?Will he?
‘’A-and what do you want me to do?’’ He questioned with a low volume in his voice and she waited for a moment until she answered.
‘’I am, I'm starving, to be specifi
“I knew it...”
Dean was about to reply but Cas was quick enough to speak first. ‘’I know I haven't lost you, at least not yet. But it feels like I'm losing you and it's too early yet and I don't want this... I'm afraid to go on without you, I'm going to be all alone. I'm sure you've heard the phrase 'I can't imagine how-how life will be without you, my life.’’ His voice started to shutter into a thousand pieces, just like his heart.
He didn't reply so Cas just dragged the chair and sat on it, close to him.
he thought. He was on the verge of saying it out loud but he changed his mind.
“No. I don't care”
Castiel gave him a benevolent smile. ‘’When we're given the chance. As frequently as possible.’’ He said, taking a bite of one of his baked potatoes.
‘’Can I tell you a secret?’’
Neither of them dared to look at each other. They were... cowards.
‘’Cas... it's just a few weeks, I will come back to you, I promise.
Dean, this poor man, was holding in his hands the only thing left from his loved one. The only thing left from Cas. He was slowly walking down this downhill steeped in blossoms and trees, until he sat on huge rock which provided him with a clear view of everything in front of him.
He started his sentence with a wide serious tone in his clients but towards the end he released a laugh. ‘’It's not funny, you know.’’ Cas replied somehow annoyed and got up. Dean had to pack his stuff up and get ready.
And while falling,
‘’He went on constantly. Oh, this sorrow devouring him inside out. Another sob before uttering the same words again, another sob followed and another one and the pattern went on.
Amelia was staring at her tummy, then she turned her attention to Castiel. ‘’What might they be thinking?’’ She asked rubbing her still flat belly. He readjusted himself in the sheets and hugged the pillow.
They deserved better.
‘’About how I have touched you - what I've said to you. About the colour if your eyes, the shape of your lips and how much I love your hands on my body-’’ he abruptly interrupted his speech and stared at Cas.
He was mentally exhausted of his perseverance to learn what was going on. But, no, he wouldn't be able to live his life without him filling it up. And he knows this is bound to happen soon.
A phantom.
For the first time- and surely not for the last. He had no idea how to deal with this new fact. And he keeps spending his days lonely, three weeks, two days and sixteen hours. He estimated the period of time he was away from him.
But apparently he broke his promise. Lord- he didn't only broke his promise but also and Dean. Because
“Of course you are honey, but even otherwise, I wouldn't care” His attitude falls of pride and he shoot a wink at me. Obviously, he doesn't care. He doesn't give a fuck about anything. I can sense it.
She used to deem that
Their hearts, they broke into a thousand pieces for the thousandth time.
But the reason why he was coming back was awful. I just heard the story today from his fiancé. She was talking about Dean with so much love and passion, she already loved him, and she didn't even know him. Maybe this is true love. To love someone, to care about someone without even knowing who they really are. To be willing to sacrifice your life for the person you love more than anything, more than the stars and the sun. More than life.
He can't believe it. No, he can't. He refused to believe the truth. He refused to believe that Cas, his Cas- is gone. Is dead. He just still have hope. He still hopes that he will see him again.
“What-what do you mean?” I tried to look as relaxed as possible but it was vain. The words slipped from my mouth without my control.
He needed it. Of course he did.
I was depressed, lost and lonely after he was gone. I was helpless against the world, my world died because I was weak to protect him. I lost everything in one night... I just want to kill myself because he died and I'm to blame. He sacrificed himself for my sake... And I... I just keep going, only for him. For the person who made me believe in love again, for the person I will always believe and love until my very last moment in this cruel world.
Shit. Shit. Shit.
It's certainly covered in dust, she thought. Same goes for the library, the books are covered by a sheet of dust. The pictures have now become memories, which will ultimately be forgotten. But she wanted to recall the people she still loves.
[ you might be really confused but
And yes, he lost everyone. Even and Cas. Even if Cas promised him he will stay. That he will be with him. He- he has to be. He fucking promised to Dean. He said he isn't going anywhere.
“Do you get lost in your thoughts frequently?” I heard his voice.
The fact that, I feel like I've known him for years – since forever.
He greeted them with a kind and calm tone putting on his brown hat and walked away.
This damn goodbye.
. Don't fear anything.
But then, he thought... If, if he is really gone- dead he would wanted me to be strong, just for him or me...Or for us. So, I'll be strong. For him. And only for him.
And he always wanted a cat. A fucking cat- A freaking angel of the Lord wanted a cat as a pet.
I was never given the chance to finish my sentence, as Dean crushed his lips in mine - Time started going by so slowly. The fear we both felt, the whole tangle of emotions that started being unthreaded when he pulled my weak body closer to him, created chaos. It was so passionate and unique. The moment our lips connected, it was as if the earth stopped spinning, as if time stopped going by, as if no one existing except for us.
‘’But you are.’’ Mary's voice was heard and drew everyone's attention.
She loves him, she will never hurt him.
''Stop behaving like a baby'' he said, his lips were close to Dean's,
‘’I don't wanna see these beautiful eyes of yours tearing up again, ok?’’
and people who weren't alive
‘’So, that's your boyfriend?’’ Whispered Gabriella in his ear a moment before reaching the impaired man. Castiel nudged her, ‘’He's not my boyfriend.’’ He whispered through his teeth.
At that very moment she took notice of her brother leaning on the bedroom door. Without saying a thing, he approached the kids and took a seat beside them. They didn't say anything. She looked at him with tearful eyes.
However, Dean let his crutches fall on the ground and pushed Cas into the nearest alley. Without wasting any more time, he connected their lips, ignoring the possibility of someone seeing them. His hand behind his neck, bringing him closer, both of them could feel their blood pulsate through their veins. Dean's quick heartbeat indicated his feelings for Cas, but the latter didn't seem to hear it that night.
in the ether, as if he doesn't want to face Castiel.
“Of' course I am Amelia...” I said as I pushed back any negative emotion or thought.
‘’I'll stay here, forever.’’ Dean stated as he placed his palm on Cas'chest, right above where his heart is supposed to be. At that very moment, this heart healed a bit more. It was like his touch was the healer of every broken part in him.
Cas is gone. He's gone, gone and far, far away. He won't see him ever again. He lost every chance, he lost everything.
"I'm sorry for not being able to save you, for not trying, for-for being unable to protect you-you, for being a fucking coward and weak, I'm so stupid...I'm sorry for-for...For...." His voice broke in a thousand pieces once again. He was so lost, his whole body was shaking. He had a panic attack, again. And the tears are still there, so many of them that they would bring a dead field into life, bringing into life everything except for his lover.
“He always desired to build a tree house...” he said looking at me this time.
also a big thank you to my best friend that she is helping me a lot with the writing in english, cause I'm stupid <3
Cas is gone.
They deserved singing together until dusk, they deserved to dance love songs, they deserved each other, being together.
Tears. More tears.
It should be just it, no matter how it hurts.
Not even him.
‘’Because I told you what I want.’’
She didn't reply because she had fallen asleep, so he did the same... he fell asleep with the thought that tomorrow will be a better, brighter day, that he is strong and will manage things out.
‘’I'm not afraid that you'll hurt me,’’ said Cas as he was burying his face into Dean's bare chest, his heartbeat was slow,
''You will, soon. I promise''  he said and left kisses on his shoulder and neck. He tacked his notebook beside Cas' poetry book and continued the series of wet and voraciously kisses on his neck, followed by marks.
But, he really wanted to tasted everything about Cas. He wanted Cas in him.

“Dean that’s very kind of you but-” Cas started to argue. “It’s fine Cas. Give your mom longer to calm down. Come on, we could have a slumber party, make prank calls and braid Sam’s hair” Dean grinned.
“Sorry, I did knock. I didn’t mean to startle you” Cas gestured to the door, looking apologetic.
Heaving themselves up onto the branches was a lot easier than it had been at age seven. The whole tree seemed smaller, the branches slimmer and less sturdy. The sun was licking the top of the tree line, it would disappear completely behind it in under an hour, engulfing them, the tree and the town in the dim light of autumn twilight.  They were dangling their feet off of the branch they were sitting on.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to alarm you” Cas took a few deep breaths to even out his breathing. Dean huffed a laugh “Nice knees” He eyed Cas, before leaning his head back, eyes closed.
A slight reference to using alcohol as a coping mechanism? It's a SPN fic unhealthy coping mechanisms are a given no? Anyone else attended the virtual panels? How are we feeling about them?
“Hey, this is good! You’ll never be the new kid again, no longer a freak. You can be a normal kid!” Dean smiled.
“The water pump is failing” Dean sighed handing the part he was holding to Bobby.
“You’re seventeen” Cas wasn’t against underage drinking per se, he had done it and watched his friends get drunk on multiple occasions, but that had always been in the context of celebrating or teenage rebellion. Drinking by yourself seemed… troubling.
“Yeah, let’s go” Sammy opened the door stepping out. Maybe things would actually be alright for once.
“Who’s Batman?” He asked as he too began to climb. Dean laughed a little
“Do you’ve anything recorded after 1990?” Charlie complained, turning over a Led Zeppelin CD.
“ Really? That’s your line? Also aren’t you hooking up Rhonda Hurley? She leaned her elbow on the counter eyeing him up and down.
There was a small spark in the back of his mind that acknowledged that he found this stranger attractive, but over the years he had become a master in snuffing that spark out every time he felt drawn to other men. He was so good at it, that he had convinced himself his same-sex attraction did
“Listen, Sam, in my experience no 13yo girl- She’s 13 right? It’s not like you’re crushing on the lunch lady or anything” He teases, which prompts Sam to kick him under the table
“You are welcome to stay here if you want to, you know” Dean offered from where he was standing, “I’ll bunk with Sammy. You can take my room”
“You guy’s laugh, but I was grounded for a month!” Jo stood up from where she’d been sitting next to Dean, shuddering at the memory of the last time they had stayed out until daybreak only for a furious Ellen Singer to come and drag them home. “Beware, Dean, my mom will not hesitate to lock you up if you defy her.”
Two weeks later they held Mary Winchester's funeral. Dean was standing in a cemetery, watching his mothers coffin being lowered into the ground. Sammy was clutching Dean’s hand soft tears rolling down his still baby round cheeks. Dean hadn't cried since the day it happened and he didn’t cry now, not in front of these people.  He had seen his dad completely break down, screaming at the coffin with treas streaming down his unshaven face. No, Dean would not cry in front of these people, he needed to be strong for Sammy and for his dad.
“Dude, what’s a cat kissem?” Dean laughed.
“It’d be a lie to say there was love lost between us”  He turns, facing the other teen, their faces were closer than he had expected, he could feel Dean’s breath on his face, he could smell the mint toothpaste. Thank god for the darkness hiding the blush burning spreading across his cheekbones. Could he hear how fast his heart was beating?
Cas looked at him with frowned brows. “Why do you do that?”
“Bobby, I don’t like it, They are just boys!” Ellen’s voice was almost pleading
“Sam. Drop. It.” Dean snapped slamming the front door shut marching to the Impala to wait for his brother.
“Dean, stop it. You can’t blame yourself, you’ve no way of knowing what would have happened” Cas hops down from the hood to properly face Dean, who only gives him a tired look there’s something else in his eyes too, but Cas can’t place it. He keeps his eyes on Dean, studying his face trying to decipher what he is thinking. It’s Dean who turns away, running his hand down his face.
“Catechism” the boy corrected “it teaches you about the Bible and God”
“Huh? Yeah sure Sammy” He agreed not convinced it was possible. Could he? Could he settle down, make meaningful relationships? Would the urge to bolt and move on to the next town or city leave him alone if he managed to find his footing in this town? He had done nothing but slip before, but if Sam wanted him to try he would.
Thank you, to everyone who has left kudos and comments! It makes my day! <3
It was a Thursday. Dean swung the front door open, throwing his The California raisins- backpack on the floor in the hallway before peaking into the kitchen looking for his mom. He knew he was late, he had lost track of time playing soccer after school. Peaking into the kitchen expecting to see his mothers scolding face, ready to reprimand him, instead, the kitchen was empty with the ingredients for dinner on the counter. The oven clock read 4.05. Odd, his mum and brother were nowhere to be seen and the house was eerily quiet. There was a loud thud from upstairs as Sammy started crying. Something felt off as Dean approached the stairs, Sanny's cries growing louder.
Dean went to work on removing the pump system in order to inspect it more closely. He started by removing the belt drive components, loosening the bolts, removing the pump and ensuring the old gasket was clean before inspecting the pump itself. It definitely needed replacing.
“Oh no brother, be careful or she’ll eat you up,” A baritone voice with a strong southern darl says behind him making Dean almost jump out of his skin. Turning around he was face to face with a broad-shouldered man, who looked to be only a few years older than him with pale blue eyes, sandy blond hair, and beard.
The argument with his father had been one of the worst ones they had ever had, Dean had to physically get in between them. Somehow, Sam had convinced their dad that it was the best for him, and so John had agreed to let them go back home, with the condition that Dean would look after his brother. A ridiculous condition, Dean had always felt responsible for the kid ever since that horrid afternoon almost a decade ago.
(See the end of the chapter for
The beers quickly became a regular thing, Benny, offering to do the inventory on the nights Dean was working. The beers turned into flirty touches that quickly turned into make-out sessions in the kitchen after hours and they had graduated to hand and blow jobs in the back seat of Impala a few weeks ago. It still made him feel weird to think he was in a relationship. Dean Winchester did not do relationships, so to be in one made him want to run away and curl into Benny all at once.
in the living room and her father asleep in the bedroom. The funeral was a week later.
It had been his third week working the closing shift when he had met Benny, one of the line cooks. Usually, all the chefs left well before the bar staff, but he had stayed late to do inventory.
Dean laughed again, making his eyes crinkle. “Touche” He stood up dusting off his jeans and shedding his oversized leather dumping it on the ground leaving him in a grey T-shirt, looking up at the Oak. “You think we can still climb this thing?” He asked grabbing the lowest branch testing his weight on it.
The Sunday after the party where he kissed Jo (they had both agreed that it had been wired and they were definitely better off as friends), Sam had let slip to Ellen that he was getting tired of all the craft dinners Dean made for him. Ellen had done a good job hiding her disapproval at the time but had called Dean the next Sunday telling him to come over earlier in the day to have him help her with dinner, teaching him how to cook. To his surprise he had discovered he loved it, there was something therapeutic and relaxing about making a meal from scratch. He had found pork chops on sale perfect for the recipe he had stolen for a pork chop casserole out of one of the old lifestyle magazines in the reception area of the garage.
Castiel blinked, usually kids made fun of him for his name, but Dean had just brushed it off. He had started to climb the tree again. Dean was a peculiar looking kid. His baseball shirt was dirty at the front no doubt from heaving himself up on tree branches when he smiled Cas could see gaps, where he had lost his baby teeth, but his permanent ones hadn't yet grown in. His eyes and ears were too big for his round, freckle covered face.
Memories were fickle, fragile little things. Some were so clear, that had he had the skills, he could've drawn them in excruciating detail. Others blurry, like the person taking the picture, had forgotten to focus the camera. And yet the emotions linked to each one, so real they, in turn, made the memories real.
“Yes. thank you, sir” Dean said quickly before the other had a chance to change his mind.
“Oh yeah, thanks, Oprah. If you don’t shut the hell up you are walking to the library” Dean grabbed the car keys and headed for the door
As per usual leaving kudos and comments are highly encouraged and welcomed.  They help me a lot, any criticism is welcome but be kind or I'll cry.
“Of course I do! It’s not- it’s nothing Okay? Drop it Cas” He sunk his hands back into the soapy water, still hot enough to sting his hands, and fished out a second plate.
I didn't follow the same route as before. I choose to drive through the longer path as he wanted to have a glance of the city...Or it was me. Wanted to have a glance of him. My eyes fell on a remote café which happened to be open I didn't say anything as I was start parking the car in a spacious corner. When he realized it, he looked at me with a questionable face, before even he opened his mouth to speak, I opened the door and got out of the vehicle. And then walked to his place to open the door for him. I don't know why I did this... Why I was so different.
‘’What do you mean?’’ He asked with fright in his voice.
‘’Kudos little one.’’ He said to Amelia winking at her.
forgetting them,
At that moment, he averted his eyes from Dean and faced Lisa, panic ruling his whole system. ‘’What do you mean?’’ He asked with a shaky voice. A slight chuckle left his lips.
“No, you aren't” I said the thing I could clearly see.
God, prove me right. Prove that he is not something different from what I think he is. Prove that he doesn't follow the mass and he's not a common type of person in today's society. What if he's like me? Cursed? Then I'm lost. I'm lost in the game of our emotions. I'm lost in him.
I need this... I need to hear you say it, you know - It will save me, render me stronger, so many weeks without you... so many moments, so many moments that I didn't get to hear the sound of your sweet voice. It's been so long, do you hear me? It's been so long since the last time I kissed your lips, the last time I saw you, I didn't wake up by your side, I was alone and... I am intimidated, do you hear me? I'm intimidated by the thought of losing you. I'm afraid that something will happen and you will leave. But I don't want you to leave, my light, I want you to stay with me for the rest of eternity. I want you to stare at me until the last star stops glowing. I want you to drown into my eyes until the last drop of the sea is lost, I want to stand powerful by your side, hold your hand.
With the old, white, wooden shutters, the glass- a little old but in excellent condition. A white curtain hanged there, thin and beautiful, handmade, Mary had made it a few summers ago. Interesting designs were depicted on it, trees, deers, a couple of little human figures, some geometrical shapes.
It shutteredme in thousands pieces and they are all over the place. The wind wished for me to become a flyer in its faraway journey throughout the Creation.
‘’You, my lady, don't have any authority to speak because you were a part of one of these things too.’’
Also, Dean had a special habit of kissing Cas' face and tickling him to gain a smile from him, at least a slight chuckle gave him gratification. Dean makes him happy, he takes away all if his insecurities. Maybe Dean is the Moon for Cas.
The lady arrived with our order and she left without and she left without saying anything, he looked at me for a moment before he took a sip of his chamomile.
felt like this with anyone else before. He never felt like kissing someone so passionately and voraciously or hugging them nonstop and holding them so tightly. He was lost in his eyes. He was lost in the most delightful world.
“Which actress would you say I’m most like?” Jo asked without looking up from her magazine. “Winona Ryder, Liv Tyler, Jodie Sweetin or Claire Danes?”
Dean didn’t know what came over him when he jumped up and followed her,  with a wink to Ash and Cas.
On especially warm days they’d go swimming in the clear water, diving down for blue mussels, prying them open with sticks, hoping to find pearls. Dean was much better at holding his breath, making him the superior diver. They'd also climb the rocks by the shore trying to push each other into the water playing 'King of the Hill'. It was during this game that Dean had shoved Cas, making him lose his balance and instead of landing in the water Cas had hit his forehead on the rocks leaving him with a permanent scar on his eyebrow. Dean had apologised profusely, but Cas had insisted that it only made him look more badass.
“Hey, Sammy. What says you we head to the Cajun place on main for lunch” It was as good of an olive branch Dean could muster, which Sam accepted with a nod and a mouthful of egg.
“Who’s car is
They’d race their bikes on the dirt road leading down to the lake the dust whirling around them. Cas would always win. Dean would pout and blame it on Cas’ new and nicer bike. Cas would laugh and point out that perhaps Dean was just a sore loser. Cas offered to swap bikes to prove his point, and when Dean still lost he pouted even harder in turn making Cas laugh until his ribs hurt.
“Yes,” Cas sat down next to him throwing his head back against the backrest “Lucien changed his name to Lucifer and my mother is furious” Cas spoke at the ceiling causing Dean to erupt out laughing. “Wow and I thought my family was messed up”
“Right, well-”
After a few more drinks each they all, sans Cas and perhaps Dean, were tipsy. Cas had stopped after 3 beers (“I don’t enjoy feeling intoxicated”) and Dean’s tolerance was way higher than a few beers, the alcohol served to blunt his nerves and make him more relaxed. Charlie in all her 5’4ft glory was quickly crossing over from tipsy to drunk and showed no signs of slowing down, she was definitely looking to get drunk. One more beer later she stood up on the couch, beer bottle held high.
“Or worse, she’ll come out looking for us herself.” Ash piped in picking up some of the snack wrappers shoving them into the plastic Gas-n-Sip-carrier bag.
“Don’t think so, that’s what has my mom is all up in arms, doesn't want them to live on their own, 'they're just kids Bobby'."  Jo mimicked her mother's voice "What happened exactly? I didn’t live here then” Jo leaned in over the table.
While Dean took his turn in the shower, Sam explained the show to Cas (apparently it was centered around bringing light to unsolved murder cases, this week it was the case of Alicia Showalter) Dean made them grilled cheese sandwiches for an evening snack, the melted cheese filling deliciously gooey offsetting the slightly burnt bread. They finish the episode while they eat, Cas sat there listening to Dean and Sam bicker and joke around, feeling like an outsider.
He felt a familiar warm hand slid into his, giving it a soft squeeze. It was the hand of a much younger man, slightly rough from working on cars every day, otherwise smooth unaffected by old age. A soft smile tugged on Cas' lips as he closed his eyes and fell asleep his joints no longer ached, his breathing no longer laboured, he felt light and peaceful.
They sit in silence after that, watching as the sun sunk below the trees. Once it was dark Dean lowered himself down from the tree. He had to go pick Sam up from the library and offered to drive Cas home, which he gladly accepted. Castile found that he liked the interior of Dean's car, it smelled like the mix of worn leather and pine air-freshener underlined with a hint of cigarette smoke. It was a comfortable ride, the drove in silence only sound coming from the car stereo playing some rock song on a low volume. Dean must know it well as he was quietly humming along. Cas didn't have to give Dean directions to his house, he must remember from the bonfire night. Before Cas got out of the car, when they were parked in front of his house, he invited Dean to join him and his friends the following night. Dean accepted, and after giving Cas the phone number to his trailer home so they could exchange details later, he drove off. It wasn't until now that Cas realised how cold and stiff he was, sitting down for hours in the lowering temperatures probably wasn't the smartest idea. Cas jogged up to the house excited for a hot shower and the idea of crawling into bed with a good book.
“Cas?” The stranger looked directly at him with a  surprised expression.
The summer passed in a haze like someone was fast-forwarding a VHS tape. Images blurring together green leaves, dirt roads, comic books, glittering water and berry pie, blending together in warm memories that would fade with time leaving only their warm fuzzy feeling in their wake.
I've added the total chapter count. It's a rough estimate, but we're in the ballpark.
When Emma arrived an hour later she found a berry pie in the kitchen, the stereo playing
They played a few rounds of Egyptian Ratscrew while the casserole finished cooking. Cas won three out of five rounds. (Dean did NOT pout, no matter what Cas said)
Neither one of them said anything for quite a while. They sat there watching as the mist that had gathered during the night, licking their ankles creeping along the ground. The frost clinging to all available surfaces, the windows, and walls of the trailer behind them, the plastic patio furniture in front of the one next door, the car under them. It tried to grab onto their clothes, only making them damp in the process.
“Yeah, but you see ‘troubles’ as you put it, don’t wait until you become an adult” Dean’s voice had a strain to it. He busied himself with the almost gone cigarette.
“Ash, you need to stop antagonizing Mr Bellaron or you’ll never pass poli. sci and stop talking in general or you'll end up on a watch list” Jo twisted her hair, securing the strand with the butterfly clip.
The murder of Alicia Showalter is still unsolved, but as of 2019 the police were still accepting new tips and leads on her case. They are optimistic that her case can be solved.  https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Police-still-hoping-for-leads-in-1996-murder-of-Alicia-Showalter-Reynolds-506717641.html
About twenty minutes later Sammy walked out in his flannel PJ-bottoms and an Animaniacs T-shirt, his hair stood up on one side of his head. He must have slept well.
He was brooding looking out the passenger side window, watching the mix of post-colonial and craftsman houses, neatly collected into all American neighbourhoods, zip past. It wasn’t until Dean squeezed his shoulder that he looked up.
“Are you okay?”
“Me? Ha, yeah right. I couldn’t even finish High School, don’t think the fine institution of higher education is for me” he flashed them his most charming smile, hoping it’d deter them from any further questioning. He felt Cas’ eyes at the side of his face, purposefully looking in the other way to avoid catching Cas’ eyes, scared of seeing what he might see there.
He inhaled deeply feeling the crisp morning air fill his old lungs and sighed loudly on the exhale. These early autumn mornings out by the pier of their cottage had once upon a time been his favourite, now they filled him with a melancholy that made the sorrow in his bones ache. Cas looked down at his wrinkled hands wrapped around the chipped “Best Papa in The World”- Mug and tightened his grip around it, his wedding ring making a quiet 'click' against the porcelain, the warmth travelling up his tired arms giving him little comfort.
“Mr Bellaron dress coded me for my anarchy and anti-war patches on my jean jacket!” He took out his anger by stabbing a tater tot with his knife.
With a frustrated groan, he turned to lay on his back.
“I find that people with nothing on their mind don’t tend to smoke half a pack in one sitting” Cas gestured to the butts on the ground. Dean sat up slightly straighter. “Yeah, well it was too early to start drinking” His smile seemed stiff and didn’t reach his eyes
“Dean?” Sam sat up a bit straighter and cleared his throat “How- Uhm. How do you ask a girl out?” His face heated up, the blush spread from his hairline to his chin.
Once Dean reached the top landing he understood why. He could see right into Sammy’s room where his mom was pinned to the wall by a tall, skinny man. Sammy sat in his bed face red from screaming, snot and tears running down his face, desperately clutching his Flint Stone-blanky. Dean stood there staring at his mum and the stranger feeling tears burn the corners of his eyes.
“I’m fine. One of the guy’s was bullying Barry” Sam shrugged avoiding Dean’s eyes. Barry, from what Sammy had told him, was a little nerdy and aspired to be a vet and also the only kid in his class not to treat him like an exotic zoo animal on his first day.
“Speaking of which, have you started your scholarship applications yet MIT doesn’t open up applications until January but I’ve been revising the old material?” Charlie asked sitting down next to Ash
“My plan is to be recruited by the government, to stop me from going to work for any other country’s leadership” Ash sat up.
