His Armani suit had definitely seen better days.
“I don’t wanna leave”
“We were in my room on the second floor when he saved me. It’s one of the only places not entirely ruined already. Take the second door to the left to get there, he might use my metal closet to hide!”
“What have you gotten yourself into Tony”
“The one and only! I suppose you don't mind if we got ourselves out of here?”
“Peter, you are hiding something, care to tell us what?” Tony stated uncharacteristically serious.
When Dummy came back in the room, Steve had to hold back from cooing. Dummy held out a picture he had drawn of his closest family. Tony and Steve. They were drawn simple. A crooked circle each for the head, two blue dots for Steve's eyes, two brown for Tony's, a stick body each, and coloured hair. Tonys hair was brown and wild (like after a long session in the workshop) and Steve's was yellow and calm. (how he normally had it when he read or drew.)
“I'll do my very best”
The smaller man was shivering and sweating at the same time. He was dizzy, and felt nauseous, but Steve was right there! Once more, he prepared to move. The man took a deep breath, and was ready to make a run for it, right through the flames. Luckily, he was yet again interrupted.
His voice was harder than steel and It was more of a command than question, but it would have to do. Something was happening, something dangerous. Something that made Tony unable to call Steve and explain. The super soldier felt like breaking something, beating someone up, taking down anyone that dared to hurt his boyfriend. The man shook his head. Not the time. Maybe he was just paranoid and overreacting. Instead he started tapping a rhythm with his foot, praying that Tony had just lost his phone and was looking for it, whilst this lady randomly just found it or something like that.
The genius sent him a rather weak glare.
------------------------------------
“I can’t do it.”
“Um, Captain America, sir! I-I wouldn't do that-!”
This is his genius, raven-haired dad's idea of punishment and “protection” like he can't take care of himself or something.
A woman standing besides the girl looked at Peter like she was very uncertain if she liked him or not. It was probably the girls mother. Peter didn't blame her though, he probably looks ridiculous with his hair all wet and everywhere. The middle aged woman and the teen share a smile, before walking in their different directions, lil'pumpkin almost lost her ant-man umbrella in the process. A cold breeze made the teen shiver. His own fault for not bringing a jacket! Chocolate cookies, he reminded himself. Chocolate cookies makes everything better!
The boy started laughing before hugging the bear and nodding.
“M-My aunty! My aunt and my u-uncle were still here! My uncle was going to help aunty get something, a-and they told me to get o-out! But I-I didn't wanna leave them! W-what if they're still here!”
After stepping out of the classic New York building, he felt the cold breeze of the well known November wind.
“Kid, I'll be fine. I'll go looking for your aunt and uncle, and you'll be outside, safe with family and friends.”
If you questioned Steve's endless pacing for nervousness, he would instantly deny it. He and Tony had been dating for four years now, of course he wasn't nervous! He obviously had no reason too, right? Right?! The blond started tugging at his hair before settling on the old workshop couch. He took the small box out of his pocket. He opened it up gently, looking longingly at the ring. It was made of white gold with a blue sapphire in centre.
The second he saw the ring he knew it was perfect. The sapphire shone a magnificent blue and reminded him of the arc reactor. Steve had told Tony a thousand time that the blue light shining from his chest was beautiful. Tony always denied him, believing he was simply being nice, or supportive about it. With this he could finally prove it.
Does he truly even love Steve?
“Where.”
Someone, NOT TONY, spoke into the expensive device. For a moment the soldier was confused. Did he call the wrong number? Luckily, before he got to open his mouth and apologize for calling “the wrong person”, she continued talking.
The billionaire hadn't been inside the building for more than a couple of minutes, but it was more than enough. When running head first into the situation he hadn't considered the arc reactor, and how weak his lungs had become from just that. He still would have gone inside, of course. Tony had attempted yelling and screaming after the child, but still hadn't gotten an answer. He had covered about half the building, but the flames were growing a lot bigger than what he was comfortable rescuing a kid from. Soon enough the exit would be blocked, he didn't have much time. Still, he wasn't going to leave the building without at least finding a body. He was still terrified of course, If he was struggling this much, how would the kid be alive. The hero grunted, he couldn't think like that! Tony took a deep breath full of dark toxic smoke and screamed as loud as he could.
They both stared and their son, giving him both their personal looks. Peter, knowing arguing would do nothing, did as told.
Steve, all supersoldier muscles, came running through the flames himself instead. He ran up to Tony. The both of them now surrounded by broken parts of what was once a family home. The man with the baby blue eyes, bent down and picked up his boyfriend, bridal style. It seemed for once Tony didn't protest on being carried, this actually worried Steve more. They shared a much needed kiss as the soldier covered Tony's smaller body with as much of his arms and shoulders as he possibly could. Then, he ran as fast as he could, through the fire, and towards the others.
"I assume that's why you didn't bring a jacket." The A.I sassily answered back, tone dry. Peter snorted. It is hard to believe that Jarvis is an A.I at times.
Steve was right there. Steve was dirty, and full of scratches and burnt marks, but there he was, looking ready to strangles actual flames with his own flesh hands. Despite the situation, Tony smiled. Steve, didn't exactly smile back though, rather he had that pitched look of worry forming. The billionaire realized, if he looked half as bad as he felt, his boyfriend had every right to feel worried.
The man was coughed and choked as he tried to use the wall for support, this however was not his greatest idea.  Tony quickly retrieved his arm, and scanned the burnt mark covering the insides of his hand. Ouch! Ok, he was definitely not doing that again. Tony took a look around. What way was out? The smoke had covered everything, and he could honestly just close his eyes at this point, because it would be no different! The hero stressed as he stopped looking for an exit, and started looking for something to cover himself so he wouldn't get hit by falling debris. Oh, how much he would give for Steve’s shield right now, or you know, just not being in this situation at all.  The man used his hands to blindly look for something solid to use as a makeshift shield, or something hard to maybe break a window if he found one. Finally his non-burnt hand found something solid, the metal closet from earlier.
Peter threw his red and yellow back pack on his bedroom floor and decided to keep the headset on. He turned the music back up before walking in a slow pace towards his parents bedroom.
“Hello?”
They had promised each that they wanted to spend the rest of their life together a long time ago. Every mission still worried them both equally of the other’s recklessness. They still holds hands, and cuddle as often as possible. Steve still buys Tony flowers every friday, and it never fails to make the brunet flustered. Tony has to stand on his tippy toes to kiss his boyfriend when he isn't wearing shoes with heels, or his ironman suit. Steve drags the smol workaholic to bed when he has been working days without rest, and then aggressively cuddles him until he falls asleep. Sometimes Tony cooks, it's an incredibly rare occurrence but when he does, it's Italian food Clint would marry Tony for. (Yes, Steve was slightly offended).
The man let out a deep sigh. He was just working himself up. Especially the last statement of his internal breakdown. They had talked about it. Tony had said it a few months into their relationship. He explained it in his own Tony way.
Peter stepped in the elevator. Cookies. Cookies. Co-
The small child shook his head frantically. He was crying now, hiccups mixing into his sobs, whilst he pleaded at Ironman.
"I love you Jarvis"
“N-no. I-I mean, that too! But I-I won’t make it. I-I can’t make it.”
With a sigh the brunet started walking. He could take a cab, but the restaurant was only a few minutes away by foot. The meeting had been annoying, and slightly stressfull, it would be nice to take a walk to clear his head. Tony had survived worse, and really a little rain was nothing to worry about.
Looking around he noticed a little girl waving at him. Scott's daughter, the one with the terrifying stuffed animals. He waved back and smiled. Can't let her down and not smile back, just because he's not feeling it.
The teen took the subway home as he always did. His dad, being a billionaire and all that, always reminded him of the possibilities of taking a taxi or you know, something more expensive instead. It always ended up with Peter taking the subway anyways. He took it everyday back when lived with his aunt, and he didn't mind other people (except he does, but eh) so he didn't see a reason for changing his old habit.
Anyways, he was finally done when suddenly Flash decided it had been a while since his last beating. This usually wasn't a problem for the nerd. He could take a beating, having been tortured by villains and such before. But this time Flash punched his face, or more specifically, his right eye.
Tony let out a hoarse snicker, it had been a long time since he'd been *hiding in the closet*. Bad jokes aside, he got in and closed the door in front of him. He just needed time to think, and a place to hide until the building wasn't falling so dramatically fast around him. Destructive sounds could be heard loudly in the background and Tony felt uncomfortably warm. The closet was really small, even for a relatively short man like Tony. The burn mark, especially the ones on his hand pricked and hurt. Ok, he said as the building was falling apart around his tiny safespace. What happens now?
"Like your da-"
“Tony, wait!”
“I love your personality more than your handsome dorito body. That is saying something, cap”
“There was a kid Steve, I couldn't leave a kid. A...And I thought...I thought I had the suit with me at first. And well, funny story, I managed to forget it at the most boring meeting ever, anyways.” Tony let his eyes wander up from the ground and towards the heavenly blue eyes  of his lover. “I’m sorry Steve..I know..I know you probably worried, and-” The blond interrupted the brunet with a another kiss.
The door was was just at the other end of the corridor. Just besides the room he, himself would move into soon. Peter pouted. Yes he was still upset! He had to find a new place to hide his suit, again! And if he wanted to jump in through the window he'd definitely get caught with how close they were. His dad's jus wouldn't let him have it easy! Not that his dad's knew about his secret at the time, but still! So fudging overprotective! Turning his attention back to his parents bedroom door, he smiled. Shower, hoodie, and cookies!
Steve simply smiled as he answered.
“Tony!”
Peter clutched his Teddy Bear before pushing it to Tony's hands
Peter is staring down at his desk, his ears and face cloured a strawberry red. Actually, most of his face, maybe not the black-eye.
A loud crash disturbed the yelling and sirens in the background. Right then, all he could hear was the sound of destruction. The sound of the building finally falling apart. The sound of someone, a firefighter, dragging him away from a piece of falling wreckage on the last second before he would have gotten crushed. Crushed, hurt, injured. Tony.
His dads both snore.
“I know, I completely get it. You know I would do the same, and I love you for it, that doesn't mean I wont be angry and worried every time.” Steve smiled lovingly down at well, his lover.
Suddenly the car came to a halt.
“Peter, are you ok?” His other dad said, worry leaking into his normally cheerful tone.
The kid nodded, and lifted the bear a little higher proudly. The kid, or Peter obviously wasn't embarrassed of being a Fan. Tony didn't judge, he was and is one too.
“Hey, I'll go look for your aunt and uncle, ok? But then you gotta promise me something.”
Some students are bored, whilst some are actually writing down notes, but of course, the students that have noticed are staring at the spot to the left and to the right of Peter Parker.
“Like you have a leg to stand on, literally. You ran into a burning building situation, without the suit, alone. You have more burnt marks than me, more cuts than me, and you probably have a concussion with how difficult it is for you to talk, and how your pupils are dilating.” Steve's *eyebrows of disapproval* showed themselves and Tony looked away as he answered.
I'll get to editing all the chapters after they are postet, so I apologize for the mistakes that probably are hidden around in the fic :b
Peter had hidden his face under the hood of his hoodie, using the rain that was pouring outside as an excuse. His plan was simple, skate home, climb up the tower to his room and use the first aid-kit in his private bathroom.
The kid looked at the ground.
Shit.
“You're Ironman, but I made everything harder for you by stalling and being nervous, and you have to find them without the suit, so it's super hard. So Maybe if you hug Cap, you'll have powers too!”
Tony's tone spoke no argument and had no uncertainty. Tony knew the kid was intelligent, he knew the kid would take the right decisions, and he knew the kid would be ok. Some firemen would probably meet Peter on the way out. It didn't make Tony less anxious though. Peter nodded and gripped at his tiny Captain America bear. Then he promptly hugged Tony, and ran of. Tony’s smiled, but his feature fastly turned serious as he started running the opposite direction. He was not going to let the kid down.
She seemed distant, like she was occupied. Simultaneously he heard sirens and people speaking loudly in the background. Is she an assistant, a businesswoman, someone from the meeting? Whatever she was, she had Tony's phone, and Tony never let anyone touch his phone. The man loved his phone more than he loved Steve (Not really). Either way, the bad feeling he had been afraid of all day, grew.
Maybe he’d think it looked horrible!
“Do you see that bear you're holding?”
Peter looked thoughtful before nodding. Tony then continued.
They had gotten out of the car, dragging him out with them and hugged him. One on each side. Tony to the left, Steve to the right. They had told him how much they love him in some serious conversation about trust, the dangers of a seemingly little injury and responsibility. After that, they had, more times than necessary, said that the one who did this would die a very slow and painful death, or the last one was mostly Tony, actually.
“And you’ll look for aunt May and uncle Ben”
“That's not fair,” Tony finally spoke, his voice husky and raw.
"Therapy?" The A.I helpfully suggested.
"Like your-"
“Peter.” Captain America used his disappointed voice.
He can't even blame this on anyone else but himself. If he had not kept “hush hush” about the bullying and the black-eye, he wouldn't even be in the particular situation.
Ok, sorry for mistakes in grammar and shit! Yes, I’m aware there is probably a lot, but I really wanted to post this and get something out. Idk, it’s christmas soon enough and this is what I have to give :b I’ll post the next chapter when I can (I have to actually start on it first though) The next chapter is most likely the last and I’m editing this fic when it’s finished, till then you’re just gonna have to survive with my crap (sorry). (Its also 03:24AM so yes)
“Yes, miss. Can I ask what you are doing with Mr. Stark's phone?”
He found some new underwear, some fuzzy socks, pajama pants, and then went to look for a baggy hoodie. Most of the hoodies he owned were either dirty, or tight fitting. Peter pouted for a moment before coming up with an idea. His dad's probably has some hoodies, right? He could just steal one. It wouldn't be the first time. The last time he did, his pops got some rather embarrassing, (cute) pictures and drawing out of it, but this time he'd be careful!
“One, you still get hurt and feel actual pain. Two, you can't pull the super soldier card, every time you get hurt.” Tony was more careful with his voice as he answered, keeping it lower, and using more time to form the words.
The second he opened his eyes, he regretted it. His golden eyes stung as smoke hit against them. Tony closed his eyes once again. The choking, the non breathing, it was because of the smoke! The inventors thought process continued to come back to him. Warmth, the stinging, its was fire, he was burning. The hero's eyes shot open again. It hurt, but this time he kept his unfocused eyes, open. Sleeping the pain and confusion away was tempting, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t, because if there was one thing he had to live on for, it was Steve, and the man of his dreams was still alive, still fine, and currently not burning. Honestly, this would be a lame way to go for the flamboyant man, way too common. He would want to die because of the unbreathable atmosphere in space, or maybe pranking some angry asgardian. The inventor wasn’t much sure, just not this, and not just yet!
“Peter”
The young man was trying to hold him still, but Steve was having none of it. He easily pushed passed the firefighter with a little bit of his enchanted strength and started running.
But this is smoke, this is bad air, what about Tony’s lungs that are barely working. And there are flames, think of Tony's skin melting and burning, And the building is collapsing, picture Tony laying in the bottom of a burnt down house. And, and this is so not ok. This is not fine. Tony is not safe, Tony is in danger, Tony might get himself killed trying to protect someone else that apparently aren't even there.
Steve threw on his only suit jacket and took the elevator to the garage. He checked his wristwatch for the sixth time in two minutes. No, he was not nervous. With a bouquet of vintage pink roses in one hand (Tony’s favourite) and his car keys in the other, he deemed himself as ready as he could get. Steve let out a deep breath. For some reason he couldn't get himself to shake away a heavy feeling that something horrible was going to happen. The man shook his head. It would be fine, It would have to be fine. They would enjoy some food, and then Steve would do it. Steve would ask Tony the big question and pray for a yes. The blond nodded, and got in his car.
The class is filled with students. A few other being in the same boat as the web-head, and other not so much.
"Peter, your temperature is lower tha-" Jarvis interrupted his train of though only for Peter to interrupt the worried mother hen of an A.I
No, the person sitting to the left of the boy is the one and only Tony Stark, aka Iron-man, and to the right of Peter is the legendary Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America.
The thing is, Steve bought this six months ago. Maybe he had stalled a little, but really, how could he not. Ok, so Steve thought the ring looked beautiful, but would Tony think so too?
Of course, what did he expect. Super overprotectiveness comes with the superdads.
The boy was shivering in his thin Iron-man themed pajama pants, holding what looked like some kind of teddy bear in his hand. Tony couldn't really tell from so far away, and it wasn't really important. Normally, he would have loved to stay more patient with the kid, but he really didn't have time for more reassuring snark talk, right now. It was a miracle in itself that he had been able to speak as much, with the horrible smoke stuffing on his already damaged lungs.
"Exactly, yes." The teen grinned back, before stepping into the living room. He threw of his shoes and went straight to his room. Peter was soaking wet from the rain. A warm shower, and some new clothes, preferably a baggy hoodie, sounded perfect.
For a moment, Steve considered the possibilities of what could happen. Of what was happening. Of what could have happened before he even got the call. What if Tony was already dead?
“You have to actually get out. Don’t tell me you’ll leave and stay, get out of the toxic and dangerous building. Deal?”
Peter giggled before suddenly turning serious.
A conversation about the powers of a cap-bear in a burning building.
"Fuck you"
“Steve!”
Tony swallowed the beginning of a panic attack and focused. There's were a lot of things he couldn't do, he simply had to start thinking of what was possible to actually do instead. Tony looked around once more, and noticed what the kid was holding. It was a teddy bear like he had thought, but not just an ordinary one, it was a Captain America-teddy bear. The adorableness on that thing rivaled the little boys. Tony shook his head, not the time. Right now, he'd take care of the first problem. Stopping the kid from passing out.
His voice wasn't too loud, and half of it was a cough, but it would have to do. Steve didn't have super hearing for nothing. Tony heard distant thumping and running as he looked around with a small smile on his face. Steve was on his way, and there was no one he trusted more than Steve. Tony glanced around himself, there was fire everywhere and so he started calmly trying to figure out how to move without getting too close. A solution came to mind and Tony started moving, until he got rudely interrupted by a hysterical Captain America, no scratch that, a hysterical Steve Rogers.
“Also..” Steve looked up into the distance.
His pops should be at a SHIELD meeting, and his dad at some Stark conference. Skipping slightly to the music, he started walking slightly faster towards the hoodie that awaited. "Perfect, I have the house to myself" he said silently to himself. If he didn't have his headphones on, the teen would have heard the A.I's answer. Of course, Peter doesn't have that kind of luck.
A head popped out from what looked like an old  metal closet. The child was clever. He was covering his mouth with his spider themed, t-shirt. The kid was young, couldn't be more than five or six years old. Relief flooded through Stark. Thank Thor, he is alright!
“I bet you could make anything if you put your mind to it. I mean another you did figure out time travel.”
Toni beamed at him gleefully. “Mr. Rogers! How dare you! I’d be holding the Iron Woman mask.”
She smirked. “Ooh superheroes; they’re just like us. Anyway I’m calling because I have a question about time.”
Toni’s brows narrowed; sometimes she questioned why she’d given him snark. “Yeah yeah whatever, J. Why don’t we both change though? You probably can’t catch pneumonia but I can. J be your oh so helpful self and direct Steve to the guest suite.”
Toni snorted out a laugh just as a voice mused, “Ugh get a room.”
“A little anxious,” he admitted. “We didn’t have many team dinners back home, and even if we had this is still different. I know everyone and yet I’m still a stranger.”
Bucky laughed, smoothing his hands along his dark pants. “Oh don’t give me that look. I
“I think my suit is also deteriorating a bit,” he admitted. “It took a lot of hits in the battle with Thanos, and afterwards there just didn’t seem to be a reason to have it looked at since I’d retired. Besides no one in 1945 would have known what to do with it anyway, or had any of the materials it needed.”
Steve blinked, caught off guard by the question. He’d never thought about Toni not being able to do anything, because Starks constantly pulled off the impossible. But…“Then…I guess I’m moving in permanently.”
there. With our similar personalities we’d crash and burn before even getting off of the ground. Knowing me I would
Toni gazed up into his too blue eyes and could see very well why Tony Prime might have kept his emotions on the down low, if he had any. He did—no way he didn’t. “No that’s pretty clear. People are complicated creatures, Cap. They are motivated by a lot of things...” A beat. “I spent a lot of time being the shit person everyone expected me to be, not factoring in what that really meant. Then one day I realize Pepper’s
When Toni still had the arc reactor buried deeply in her chest, sometimes it would ache for no other reason than rain was on the way. Taking it out didn’t change that though the pain lessened considerably. Now it was like a phantom twinge that flared up when she was stressed or ate too much spicy food. Well, there was none of Rhodey’s famous five alarm chili in sight.
Strange rubbed at his chin and then walked a slow circle around Steve, eying him thoughtfully. “If you mean do I know you don’t necessarily belong here, yes. Your energy is in major fluctuation but I can tell it’s settling already. Who are you?”
Later at home alone she’d drowned her sorrows and then updated everyone’s gear and weapons to the point that even Natasha was impressed. Over time it got easier and now she really was fine with their relationship. Some people just weren’t cut out for the picket fence life.
But he couldn’t just leave his suit in an alley. If it fell into the wrong hands the material could be repurposed for anything. “No I—it’s there. Please just—just grab it.”
—and the next something had latched onto the back of his neck like a vice and
but meeting Rhodey had made a world of difference.
She wet her lips. “How did I—did I do something or somehow cause this?”
For one mad moment, Steve had the sudden urge to press a kiss to the top of her head. Why? He had no clue and honestly he refused to look too deep into it. He also refused to think about their earlier hug and how nicely she’d fit in his arms. It just…
Leaning against the counter, he looked up at the ceiling. “You know after I first started doing active duty with the serum, I did push myself more than I probably should. But it just made sense. I could now do amazing things; what was a little pain compared to the lives I’d save? Honestly I—I’m not sure that mindset ever left. Giving up is never an option so you fight through the pain.”
With a hum, Rhodey swirled around on his stool so that he could rest his elbows on the table. “You’ve always got an educated guess in your back pocket. What do you think Steve would be going back to?”
“Yes ma’am.” Steve chuckled much to Toni’s delight. “I have to ask, is this not strange for you at all? I mean you’re taking it pretty well.”
Though he’d probably dodged a bullet; she’d just learned Pepper was seeing Happy and would have no doubt crushed him in her mad dash to prove how
Relief washed over him and honestly he was surprised by how much he just
“Yes. I called you because I’ve forgotten what a
“Just…” He sighed but otherwise didn’t move. “I’ve seen a lot since waking up and learned a lot too. I’d made peace with the idea that we’re not alone in the universe but now I’m wondering what the point is?”
“Whoa whoa who Tin Man, ease up!” Toni exclaimed hastily. “I can explain this!”
“Or maybe it just went over your head?” She suggested. “I can’t imagine someone taking one look at you and deciding
“Yes ma’am,” Steve replied earnestly. “I know you aren’t the Pepper I’m familiar with but I hope we can become friends. I’d like that anyway.”
Steve wasn’t too surprised by the change in topic, but it did make him a bit nervous.
awake?” Her brown eyes landed on his food. “Ah. Right. You carbo-load because of your metabolism. Carry on then.” Humming and with coffee in hand, she strolled off. “J make sure Steve doesn’t eat all of the garlic knots.”
hungry. Ms. Stark’s orders. However if you wish to treat them more as a suggestion I doubt she would mind.”
Toni pouted as he walked past her. “Jokes on you I don’t even have any soft pretzels.”
Giving him an
Steve smiled. “With emphasis on the ass?”
She nodded. “That’s what Strange said. I don’t know.” Jiggling the wrench, she nibbled on her bottom lip. “Did you see how well he got on with everyone at dinner? He showed up and it’s like he’s been here all along. And sometimes he looks at me and there is just
Steve blinked slowly and a tear he didn’t even know had formed slipped over onto his cheek. “I thought we’d all survive. On paper it all sounded so easy. Just get the stones and bring everyone back. Thanos was dead so all we had to do was snap everyone back. It should have been easy.”
“I’m not Hydra. I am from a universe where things are the same but different. Toni can explain it better than I can,” Steve admitted. “In my reality Toni is a man. Iron Man. Well he—he was. He died helping to defeat Thanos. But most of the people who exist here also exist there.” He decided not to mention that Nat was also dead. “You’re there…or a version of you. Seventy years after I’m pulled out of the ice and working for SHIELD, the Winter Soldier shows up and tries to assassinate Nick Fury. And then me and Natasha. Apparently SHIELD had been infiltrated by Hydra for years and was finally making their move.”
His grin brightened. “Still not complaining.”
She nodded and tapped her finger against the metal. “So they found Captain America with his shield naturally and decided most of his things should be put in a museum. It was a piece of history and history should be shared with the world. Now that’s all well and good but there are idiots out there who would try to steal it, melt it down because of its nature and do all sorts of things afterwards. SHIELD thought it made more sense to put a replica in the museum and keep the real thing deep in their concrete bowels.”
“Of course Ms. Stark,” came Jarvis’ clear voice.
“I’m fine,” Steve mumbled but he was already letting her pull him up. His head was fogged and dizzy; there was a chance he had a slight concussion if the sudden pounding was anything to go by. “I—I need. Where…”
Launching herself back into the air, she returned to the fight, working to keep most of the damage to a centralize area. The soldiers seemed to have no interest deviating beyond whatever they’d been told to do, and so far
“I see,” Jarvis said slowly. “Friday is Ms. Stark’s back up assistant program. She is a very capable AI.”
“First if anyone can take care of themselves, it’s Steve Rogers. Besides it’s not like Bruce is gonna try to cut him open. And second…I don’t know. It’s nothing so why bother anyone?”
Normal was overrated as far as Toni was concerned. “It sucks you had to go back to 1945 to feel normal. We were pretty normal today.”
Toni laughed from her place behind the fence of the batting cages. She tapped her bat against her ankle and watched as the machine spit out another ball towards Steve, which he of course hit across the field and completely out of sight with enough force to probably break the sound barrier. It was a delight to watch for more reasons that one, the top perhaps being the relaxed joy on Steve’s face. He was having fun and everything that appeared to be weighing him down was gone for now at least.
“No he flirted. Not—not a lot though.”
“Yeah but tell them to stay clear for now. I just did a check on vitals and thankfully no one appears to be hurt. Let’s hope that doesn’t change.”
She drummed her fingers on the table. “I did. Sounds like the difference is Carol showing up when the big lizard things oozed out of the portal and started wrecking everything. We hadn’t met her before then. She caught me when I lost consciousness and afterwards we became pretty good friends. She shares my sarcastic sense of humor.”
“I think it’s more than enough, Toni.” Rhodey reached over and patted her thigh. “Getting him home is no small thing. As for the other stuff, well, we all live with regrets. Whatever unfinished business he and Tony Prime had will just have to remain unfinished. It’s not on
Pinching the bridge of his nose, he cast his thoughts out to Peggy because that was something he could deal with. Was she looking for him or did she even remember him showing up at all? Hell did that timeline even still exist now that he wasn’t in it actively shaping it? Technically that was his past because this new
Steve was standing in front of the tall square windows with his arms folded across his simple button down shirt. He was staring out at the city, face bathed in the multicolored lights reflected in the glass. Toni let her eyes rake over him, shaking her head with a tiny smirk at his shoulder to waist ratio. Who
Did he? He honestly wasn’t sure. He wasn’t sure of anything anymore. “What the fuck is happening to me?”
“Are you alright? You have been quiet for thirty-five minutes and nineteen seconds,” Jarvis mused. “A near record for you I should think.”
“Part of it. After realizing that time travel was a thing, I started thinking more and more about my past. About Peggy. Though if—if Tony hadn’t died I wouldn’t have gone back to 1945. I can’t say for sure how I know I wouldn’t have gone back but I just do. I was the leader of the Avengers but he was…” He exhaled deeply. “He was the heart. I don’t think all of us realized it until it was too late though. Peter knew, and Nat knew. Without Tony everything just appeared fragmented. He
Villains tended to have patience. They’d simply plot for years and years because they realized they only had one real shot to get anything done. Once they were out in the open, once they revealed that they existed they no longer had the element of surprise.
After breakfast Toni spent much of the next morning down in her workshop, spinning up glowing blue diagrams while Jarvis scourged the internet for every bit of information that he could find about Time Wraiths. It was just easier to let him separate things that rang true from crackpot theories and odd sci-fi porn. Of which she knew nothing about of course. Steve for his part lounged on the overstuffed couch in the corner with his newly provided sketchbook, indulging DUM-E who apparently wanted to be drawn like a French girl.
“Okay,” Toni said eyes on her tablet again. “Is this prime reality home or alternate timeline with Peggy home?”
anymore.”
“Steve Rogers.” He sighed wearily.
It didn’t need to be said. Toni understood. “Sure. Can’t promise your feet won’t hang off the couch in there but you’re welcomed to join me.”
“Yeah it was nice,” she replied after a moment. “I’m glad that everyone got along not that I thought otherwise. Rhodey and Bruce were bound to like Steve. Everyone likes Steve. He’s a very likeable guy.”
Or a just in case situation.
Toni snorted, folding her arms over her chest. “Yeah and I’m sure the Prince Charming hair and the bulging muscles have nothing to do with it.” She slouched back against the counter. “But thanks for the assist. I knew you’d be handy to have around.”
Whether they actually were remained to be seen.
ego should be in charge of a magical rock that can control time I’ll never know. Would’ve been better off giving it to a toddler.”
Standing on the grassy banks overlooking the gorgeous lake from the house, Steve had shoved his hands into his suit pockets and just felt
“There is still time for you to have children Toni if you want them,” Steve replied with a grin. “Older—erm—there is just still time.”
She sniffed at him. “Says the guy who was making animal noises earlier. Leave me be and get back to your girlfriend before she comes to her senses about you.”
to do?
“I’m okay…” Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “It’s been a crazy few years and not all of them were good. In fact they were damn horrible. I’d planned to retire now that things were mellow but I guess the universe isn’t done screwing with me yet.”
“Alive and kicking,” Judith mused smiling. “I’m seeing a gentleman from my water aerobics class. He’s seventy.”
there is but you never know.”
Pushing those thoughts away he returned to his drawing, losing track of time until Toni was padding across the floor in tight jeans and a baby blue blouse. She looked showered and refreshed, and happy.
“C’mon you know that’s a third date type deal. Besides just figured he might want to talk some more. He looks like he has a lot he wants to get off that…chiseled chest of his.”
Judith cackled. “He’s such a sweet young man. You tell him I’m bringing back those muffins he likes.”
she was with it. Instead she focused on ice cream and work. Everyone had appreciated the upgrades.
Steve gripped his fork a little tighter. “I would have helped you. Had I existed here I would have helped you.”
“No,” she muttered. “This isn’t about Steve. Okay maybe it’s a little about Steve but don’t ask me to put my thoughts in order because I don’t think I can. I was just looking at him earlier and got sad thinking about him being here and then leaving. The only reason he’s even stuck here is because of this stupid tether. He wants to be with Peggy and that’s where he should be.”
Strange snapped his fingers and the shapes hurried to rearrange themselves, forming red and gold snowflake like links in twin chains that wrapped around Steve’s ankles. “Impatient as ever, Stark. To answer your question
“Someone should tell your face.” Toni dug her fingers into the back of his neck, massaging lightly. “It’s okay to not be okay. But since we’re talking… Earlier before the alarm went off I asked what you’d do if I couldn’t get you back to Peggy.”
shareholders. Why not take Steve?”
The elevator door opened before he could reply—though it was just as well he decided
“Okay,” Toni said simply.
Plopping down onto her butt, she pulled off her high heels and rubbed at the soles of her feet. “Um. Captain America existed here but he, well, when he was pulled out of the ice he was already dead.” She looked apologetic. “According to the official report that I
“I don’t know, J. He said he was retiring. I’ll ask him though. I mean I’m hoping nothing comes up but we’re always on the clock. And okay maybe I am dying to see him in action, just a little bit. Not going to make him though.”
. I get the symbolism but I don’t see how
Plus if we hang out I don’t have to do paperwork so really you’re saving my life right now.”
“Wh—what? Where…Jarvis?”
Pepper’s brow climbed a little higher. “Later I’m going to need you to explain this in specific detail. But for now you seem to be happy so I’m satisfied this Steve isn’t a threat.”
“Of different realities. Different versions of the same people. What’s the point?”
“Maybe.”
Natasha sat down beside him. “Sounds like my kind of girl.” She met his gaze. “I hope you’re not blaming yourself for what happened. It needed to be done so she did it. When people like me decide to become the good guys we don’t half ass it. We go all in and if that means dying for the cause, then we die. Sounds like her sacrifice wasn’t for nothing.”
Bucky stood and lightly slapped Steve upside his head. “Can’t be. You always took all of the stupid with you.” He pulled Steve up into a hug. “I’m glad you’re here though, whatever the reason.”
Tony, and honestly whatever Tony that saw the note probably wouldn’t have heeded it anyway. He still would have sacrificed himself to save the world because that’s what heroes did. They gave up
Rhodey snorted again but he was smiling. He extended a hand and Steve shook it. “It’s nice to meet you, Steve.”
Doctor Strange’s words about the tether sat on the tip of Steve’s tongue but he swallowed them down. Obviously Toni was feeling some kind of way about everything and while telling her about the tether’s growth was something he needed to do, he couldn’t bring himself to say anything at the moment. He didn’t want to make her feel bad or force her into some odd crunch mode that burnt her out. She did everything for everyone already.
Steve pressed his hands against the counter, shoulders curving inward. “Can I—would it be okay if I just sat with you while you worked? I mean I’ll probably end up falling asleep but…”
“Alright what’s that in normal people speak?”
More than once she’d wondered if things would have been different if she’d been a boy. However with Steve’s introduction into her life she’d gotten her answer. It would not have mattered at all. Boy, girl—it was just her very existence that caused the ripples. Oh well.
He’d almost forgotten. “I saw something. This floating, flying thing in a tattered robe with no eyes. I think it’s what pulled me away from Peggy and dropped me here. Wherever here is. I was going to follow it and make sure it didn’t hurt anyone.”
The words sounded nice to hear but Toni got the distinct feeling they weren’t as cut and dry as they seemed. But then nothing about Steve was cut and dry. He had the eyes of a man who’d seen too much in a short amount of time, and she tried to remember how she’d felt while going up against Thanos. Helpless, hopeless and utterly dejected were just a few adjectives that came to mind.  Things got better but you didn’t forget. Remembering was important.
Another reality; he could try to wrap his head around that. “There is no stamp but I am Captain America. Don’t—am I not here?”
Toni didn’t want to ask but she had to because her brain pretty much demanded it. She sought answers to questions like a man crawling through the desert sought water. “Why are they red and gold?”
“Why wouldn’t he want me to know?” he asked walking over to the fence. “I’ve never liked bullies. I wouldn’t have—I’m not a bigot. I believe people should be free to love whoever they want.”
Jesus it was terrifying to be needed so badly. Idly she wondered if this was how Pepper had felt. If how Rhodey sometimes still felt when it came to her.
Fidgeting, Toni began to move around her lab touching various things just for something to do. It was dumb. If breaking the stupid tether sent Steve back to where he wanted to be then—then why not just
know is, pinning all your hopes on something in the past is no way to live. You have to look towards the future and what you can accomplish if you want to get anywhere. I believe you can get Steve wherever he wants to go and make it so he can stay there.
Steve frowned a little. “Is that why you’re here? For the weapons and the armor?”
Steve laughed. “Shut up. I hope you’re not going to tell Toni about this conversation.”
Natasha wet her lips. “James doesn’t think you should go back. He’d never say it to you though. He thinks you should give this reality a chance before you make up your mind, and I agree with him. If being where you are from is so hard perhaps this is better.” Easing off the stool, she put her juice back in the fridge. “Stick around and let Toni spoil you. She’s good at that.”
but that he always wanted to do the right thing; always wanted to save everyone that he could. She said he was so brave and quite dashing. And dad well…he thought Captain America walked on water.”
she’d used the Infinity Stones. “I don’t believe that. Tony—my Tony put on those stones and they—they killed him. He could hardly talk in the end because of what they did to his body.” His jaw clenched tight. “So if you’re sitting here telling me that you just…put it on and poof, everything was fine… No. I—I don’t. No. I don’t believe you were somehow stronger than him because Captain America died here.”
“Yeah but it doesn’t change—”
His laugh was sudden but warm, body losing more of its tension. “Thank you, Toni.”
Toni shook her head. “Nope he’s actually Steve Rogers. Vetted and verified. In his reality they did the whole Thanos song and dance, so you can imagine that drama. He wanted to settle down in 1945 but the aforementioned time monster kicked him here instead.”
“I do,” he said without a hint of hesitation or dishonesty. “You might not be the Tony I know but I’ve learned that trusting Tony Stark is always the right thing to do. Hard lesson won but…”
be?! Crazy and awesome.
knew Tony Prime using the stones and dying was the only way to save the world, and he said nothing so that it would come to pass. Don’t be a buzz kill, Doc.”
Glancing down at the top of her dark head, he smiled to himself at the oddness of the situation. The idea of resting on a couch while Tony Prime slumped against him was so foreign he’d never considered it. Tony was a tactile person but he’d never been that way with
And then a lightbulb pinged over her head. “I’m about to do a thing!”
Steve thought to himself. “You all did alright without my amazing charisma around.”
Pepper surveyed him with a critical eye before shaking his hand. “It’s nice to meet you, Captain Rogers. I’ve been hearing interesting things about you.”
“But how did your people come back? Who put on the gauntlet?”
It was obvious that Steve didn’t miss fighting—he had retired after all—but there was something to be said about him on a battlefield. The way he fought; how he used his body while in combat and seemed completely aware of his surroundings at all times. How fast he moved and how his strength was just a small facet of the things he could do. He anticipated his opponent’s movements, used their own momentum against them to catch them off guard and ultimately knock them into the middle of next week.
Toni picked up a wrench just to have something in her hand. “That’s doubtful. He wants to get back to Peggy and honestly I don’t blame him. Aunt Peggy was awesome. Anyone would want to be in her orbit… Plus they have their whole
She made a face. “Harry Potter. Look can I just get a run down on them, please? Why do they exist? What do they eat? Are they housebroken? How would one theoretically stop one?”
Rhodey hit Steve companionably on the shoulder. “Congrats. She’s yours for two goats and a soft pretzel.”
“The higher they go the stronger my connection to this reality grows. He made it sound like sooner or later either I won’t want to leave…or I won’t be able to.”
“I thought it would be fun for you. Something light and stuff. If you’re bored we can do something else. See a movie or what not. I mean it’s not like you aren’t used to New York. You come from one just like it so no need to point and go
He continued walking, pretending like he had never seen it. Of course, his billionaire dad had no problem with a little bit of attention and opened the window, screaming after Peter.
It was two seconds Peter used before he realized what was happening and closed the door with bright red ears. The first second was used by looking towards the closet. The second, on was used in seeing Steve lay on top of Tony, completely nude. Peter promptly turned around, shut the door, and then curled into a ball of shame the moment he was back at his room. His dads were NAKED. His pops, eh! Was in his dad!! Peter groaned in suffering.
Tony nodded again before saying sincerely.
Rain poured down the streets of New York, but he couldn't care less. The rain drops drummed at the streets, and Peter couldn't help but grin. Looks like Spider-Man is wearing a raincoat over his suit tonight.
“There’s something I want to talk to you about when we get to the hospital- No! Don't give me that face! We are going to the hospital!” Tony gave an adorable pout that Steve was sure if he pointed out, the inventor would object to.
The thing is, Steve had really been thinking about proposing for a long time. This evening just made everything more clear. If something happened to him, or God forbid Tony, he’d forever regret to never marrying him. To never give Tony his ring when he could. So, yes maybe a hospital isn't the best place to do it. Maybe it's a tiny bit strange to do it right after Tony got hurt and injured. But really, the only thing Steve truly cared about was the approval of one man. Anthony Edward Stark. Or maybe, just maybe, Anthony Edward Stark Rogers.
It all happened yesterday when he was had been in detention for being late three days in a row, which was really unfair because he is Spider-man and totally did not spend two of those days eating Mexican food with Wade.
Brown and friendly eyes filled with concern scanned him. Most likely looking for injuries. His dark skinned hand carefully held onto his. His pale, shaking and cold hand a contrast to the dark, warm and calm hand of his. The man took calm and long breaths, and Steve couldn't do anything else than follow his lead. It was instinctual. Though, Steve was still in shock, in denial. Tony was fine. Tony was fine. Tony was fi-.
Steve rolled his eyes fondly whilst a grimace was plastered on the boy's face. Peter was glad his dad seemed happy and all, but his loud voice really did not help against the students increasing headache. Stupid spider-sense, warning him of his stupid situation. He already knew he was in trouble, thank you very much.
Enjoy the last chapter!
The handsome dorito smiled at the thought. Its Tony, not some stranger. Not Ironman, the hero. Not Anthony Edward Stark, the celebrity. Steve was going to propose to Tony. Tony was his rock after the ice. His distraction. His crush. His closest friend. Tony. A fierce, smol, and strong willed man, with a heart of gold.
Thank you so much for reading! I really hope you enjoyed!
So, get a hoodie from his dad's room, take a warm shower, and eat some delicious chocolate cookies. Sounded like a good, no GREAT plan! Peter grinned in triumph.
Shit, shit, shit.
Tony steadily put a hand on the kids skinny shoulder.
The point was, Steve loves Tony, and Tony loves Steve. The man with the heavenly blue eyes had absolutely nothing to worry about. The restaurant was one of their personal favourites, and Steve would absolutely nail the proposal speech! ..Yeah, he wasn't that sure, but he was determined to try his very best to not fail.
The two of them are well known to be a married couple, but not really known for the reason they are currently sitting beside Peter with a threatening look in their eyes, holding one of his hand each, and generally just shining with a whole lot of protectiveness.
“You tell me to stop, but then run through fire yourself. Twice.”
That was his demands. For surviving a horrible meeting like this, he fucking deserved it! Pepper would probably say he was overreacting, but that was totally not true! Luckily it was only five minutes left before he could leave the building full of annoying people, and go eat some italian meatballs with the cutest meatball he knew. Maybe he just needed Meatball, and meatballs. Meatball doesn't like it when he drinks, and Tony loves his meatball-babe more than boze. More than anything actually. But he would love to eat some meatballs. (both)
(See the end of the chapter for
What if he doesn't want to spend the rest of his reckless life with Steve.
“TONY!”
“I can do it.”
Yeah, Steve wouldn't let him walk around the restaurant if he was wet and shivering cold. The stubborn shorty huffed. He’s rich, It would easy to just buy a new one for the date! Looking around he spotted a little corner shop to the left, and what he thought might be suits? He probably needed glasses. (Not that he would tell Steve that) Maybe his luck returned? He was soaked, but there they were, suits! Not as good quality or expensive as the Armani suit that dripped ice cold water towards the snowy ground, but it would have to do.
Tony had patched him up in the car, and Steve, not willing to let the boy out of his sight, made him sleep in his dad's bed like a four year old.
“Captain America could get out of the building. Hug the bear, and you can do it too. You're a smart kid. You hid where the flames and smoke couldn't get to you, and blocked a lot of the smoke with you amazing t-shirt. I’m sure your epic pants are the reason though. You just didn't want to ruin the little Ironmen by dirtying or burning them. Am I right, or am I Ironman?”
Peter hates attention and is more of a “Hi sir, would it be ok if I held your daughter's hand?” than “Your daughter calls me daddy too” kind of guy, but the reason for Peter's obvious blush is not for the teacher that is having some trouble fitting a condom onto an old banana.
The day had been suspiciously good. Not even a small beating had happened today. The slender but muscular teen shook his head. Maybe his Parker luck had finally come to a halt? Our you know, just gone on vacation for a bit. Grabbing his Captain America headset from his Iron-Man bag, he let himself relax.
It's not like anything would change after the proposal, right? They had lived together since the avengers initiative, and shared a bedroom for four years. The only difference was that they would get a ring each, and have it signed on paper.
He couldn't breathe properly.
Tony was at the edge of unconsciousness. The man couldn't really think straight, or well that was mostly Steves fault. A stubborn part of him wanted to get up, whilst the rest wanted a giant powernap. Why was he this tired, and why would he get up from the warmth? He felt so comfortable! The injured man had no idea what was going on. Did he fall asleep after pulling a few couple of all-nighters in the lab again? If so, why would he get up. Ok, he thought, as he tried taking in the landscape around him without actually opening his eyes. The inventors head felt like Steve had hit him with his shield and someone had roasted his skin with his own gauntlets. Not only that, but he couldn't even seem to breath. Why, he though. He simply couldn't focus, and it wasn't before minutes he came to the conclusion that he might have hit his head on something. Maybe it was about time to open his eyes and look around, the confused man thought.
"Jarvis, is it possible to erase a mental image?" Peters face was completely red, but his voice was 100% serious.
“Of course you can. I said so, and I'm always right”
Peter was having a great day! He hadn't been late to ANY classes, and did ALL his homework, even with his Spider-Man doings going strong! AND school ended early! He was obviously satisfied, and couldn't wait to get home to the tower, and then praise himself with some cookies. Chocolate cookies. Whilst exiting the school building, he allowed himself to smile.
Quickly he thanked the woman, luckily the situation was very close to the restaurant. Only about a minute drive-if you broke all traffic laws like Captain America was currently doing. Meaning, he had 60 second, give or take, to calm down. Nothing would get done in pure panic and stress. Steve took a deep breath before calling Sam. He was amazing at getting Steve to not, well panic. Getting more people to help in this situation, would not be good. If the building had been burning for half an hour, it wouldn't holdt much more. Maybe, Falcon would know more about this. After all, he was more used to the rescuing kinds of missions than Steve. The soldier took another deep breath.
“When I feel like i can’t do something, or I feel scared, I think about him. He's brave and inspire me to do the best I can everyday, because I know he would believe in me. But If thinking about him isn't enough, I hug him. It gives me strength, feels like he's giving me a little of his powers y’know? “
Finally, he heard a small shaky voice.
The boy went from his slight shiver to hyperventilating, as if suddenly realizing, or remembering something. Tony let out a series of coughs before being able to use his voice roughly. They didn't have time for this. The flames were spreading and soon enough the roof wouldn't hold. Pure determination and will, were the only things that made sure his voice didn't crack.
“Kid, we don't have much time right now, ok? It's not going to be very comfortable here in a couple of minutes, and I think we both could use some fresh air, do you understand?”
Steve hugged the adorable robot. He had absolutly nothing to worry about.
The kid reluctantly nodded, before Tony continued.
Recently Steve had taught Dummy, Butterfingers, and You how to draw. He bought some simple crayons to the robots and watched them draw smileys, hearts, houses, and trees.  It looked much of what a small child, or kindergartener would make, and always seemed to create a smile on Steve's face. Sometimes they even drew together with Steve. Steve would draw Tony's face, and Dummy, Butterfingers, and You would draw hearts around it. The billionaire had yet to see it.
He was jumping over debris, sometimes just running straight through pieces of the building. Fuck having a plan. Fuck patience, he needed Tony.
He seemed to use a lot of energy on making the sentence and saying it. Tony let out a few harsh and painful sounding coughs, and Steve sendt him a worried look. Finally when Tony was able to breathe again, Steve answered with concerned eyes, and a small smile.
He moves his hand, more specifically the one Steve is holding, only to be stopped by his blue-eyed father that quickly sent him the look. Honestly, nobody likes that, so Peter stops and continues trying to find something interesting in the wooden patterns of his desk, whilst the teacher continue his torture. There was no being saved from aunt Natashas strange gifts.
So his dad's had not stopped fussing over him since then.
“This is my fault, but I can help!”
“Do you have a Cap bear too!”
Finally he ran around the building corner and realized the source of her distress. This would be fine, he assured himself whilst running towards it. A building was no match for Iron-man! Tony was just about to activate his iron-man suit from his suitcase, when he finally remembered. That's what he had forgotten! Not good, really not good. He had do something! They didn't have time to wait for help. The kid was in there and the building was already falling apart. That wasn't even the worst thing, If the building didn't kill him, the smoke definitely would.
"GAAHH!"
Steve is a hypocrite in the best way, because he knows.
Fudge, he did not mean to worry them, that's why he did not want to say anything about the black-eye. Also, he did not want them to fall into super-overprotective-mode.
“You need to stay calm, Captain Rogers.”
Suddenly he felt as if he had forgotten something. He just wasn't sure of what. The man shrugged, if he didn't remember it couldn't be too important. It had been snowing all day and it really showed. It looked as if someone had ordered white carpets and placed them everywhere. It was raining too. Not much, really, but enough to make the chill air feel even colder.
Tony didn't know how long he'd been in there. What he did know however, (or, he was pretty sure of it at least), was that the kids parents must have gotten themselves out of there. He had been looking everywhere he was able to get to, but still hadn't seen any other people. They were either outside, or dead. Now, if the billionaire himself didn't want to end up as his second suggestion, he'd have to be fast. At this point the brunet was barely able to move, and had been breathing in smoke through his thin shirt, for longer than he thought he would be able to in the first place. Parts of the old house were collapsing around him, as he searched for a way out in the blinding smoke.
It’s—it’s all right. It’s going to be all right. He’d said it, and now he could take it. Whatever the consequences were—maybe it would be strange, for a little while, but they could figure it out, and Steve could—he would get through it, just like he has been, and maybe—someday, in the far-flung future, the vice in his chest would ease and he could watch Tony smile at someone else, and it would be all right.
“Is that what you learned?”
“—you’re right, the tights and the spangles, clear giveaway—”
“Then what is it about, Tony, because I meant what I said—”
” Tony’s breathing hard with all the rage Steve had earned; it’s unraveling his seams and bursting through to the surface. “Yes, how
— about optimism, because—look, you don’t come into work every day, working on your nanotech or your gamma ray or documenting the mating calls of a rare Amazonian tree frog or whatever it is zoologists do, weirdos, if you don’t believe—if you don’t believe the world could be a better place. If you didn’t think you were—helping, in some way. You wouldn’t do it if it didn’t matter.”
“No,” she says. “Because how we react to that information, what we do with it—that’s the only thing we can control. That’s the only stable thing in the world. You know that better than most. Our choices don’t define us but they we can use them to understand ourselves. The emotions themselves, we can’t help them. Do you see? They’re not moral indicators.”
“I—” He could tell the truth. He could take a deep breath and tell Tony the truth, at long-last. Or, he could say, “I have no excuse.”
horseshit,” Tony says. “This is a very important moment for me, besides, don’t think I’ve been hate-criming myself for 20 years here—”
“Hmm,” she says.
That—and the lipstick thing. They’re not unrelated.
“Someone suspicious?”
“I see,” Dr. Williams says. “That seems intimate.”
“Okay,” he says, salutes for no reason at all, and takes the elevator down. He jogs around the block a couple times, checks his watch. 1337. He’d been taking it slow, too. Maybe he’d jumped the gun. Never too early to turn up for recon, though.
“Not like that!” There’s a feeling he gets in this room, sometimes, like he needs to pull a window open and stick his head out like a dog in a car and breathe in the humid garbage decay of a New York City summer. Get his bearings. Of course, this SHIELD branch is well out of the city and he wouldn’t get anything but trucks galloping on the highway and damp grass. “Just I pull him away from work, sometimes, get him to sleep. He asks me to stay, sometimes.”
“Situation normal, Rogers,” he says to himself. The hot dog cart guy looks at him and he shrugs. He loiters around the corner from the Tower garage exit for another twenty minutes, watching other people on their phones. He hasn’t quite got ahold of what they’re doing. “Twitter,” Tony had told him. “If you’ve got a hankering for hot takes and bad opinions.”
She waved him off. “Chest twinge. It’s more than likely gonna rain soon.” Wetting her lips, she turned on her heel and motioned down the hall. “I’m gonna go take something before the others get here. Be right back.”
“No need to throw yourself on that grenade. Besides after what you’d been through you should be able to call wherever you want home. Strange isn’t God—he doesn’t get the final say. And if he tries we’ll tell him about how his doppelganger basically set the other me up to die, guilt tripping him into helping you get back to Peggy. This is a foolproof plan.”
He’d caught her hand in his before he really knew what he was doing. “I’m just being honest.”
But Toni’s hand was smaller and if he listened very closely he could hear the whirring of servos or what have you powering it up. Still it was
“Hey maybe you just
“I did.”
Or escalating them.
Toni had seen the old black and white picture reels of Sergeant Barnes and Captain Rogers. Knew the triumphant story of Krausberg and the devastation of that Hydra train. When Barnes had popped up as the Winter Soldier she’d idly thought the wrong person had survived. That thought buried itself into her chest and took root after finding out what he’d done to her parents. Years and years thinking Howard had had too much to drink only for the truth to perhaps be even worse. They were murdered and their murderer was Captain America’s best friend.
“How do you figure?” she inquired innocently. “It just seems like it’s where you
—or not smart enough—
“Yes.”
“Aw…how patronizing.” Came a voice behind them though it was tinged in jest. “Are you two done deciding my dowry or should I go back and poke Bruce with a stick some more?”
Steve shook his head but said, “Jesus it’s like—it’s like you
He gazed at her with a look she couldn’t decipher and grinned. After a moment, she grinned back.
“You. Where I come from it was me and Nat going up against Pierce. And then we roped Sam into the mix when we needed help.” Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “I didn’t even know it was you until we engaged in hand to hand. We’re beating the hell out of each other in the middle of the street and then I accidentally pull your mask off. It was like seeing a ghost. We uh—we went up against each other again and you nearly killed me. I think I would have let you.”
She snorted. “Yeah not yet anyway. Okay well um I guess we can have Jarvis order you some stuff to make your stay more…homey. And don’t say you don’t need anything because that’s horse shit. Barnes doesn’t
Bucky shook his head. “I’m no narc…your secrets are safe with me. You know it’s alright to see her as your Tony and think she’s…nicely proportioned, Stevie. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing.”
? Was it his mission in life to make her comfortable? To raise her faults to the forefront and shove them under a microscope? In what galaxy did Toni Stark deserve the respect of a freaking icon?
Blinking back to attention, Steve nodded. “Yeah. This reality has huge differences at times but nothing that I haven’t been able to handle. Toni has been a big help though, telling me about stuff that I should know. I guess I’m just lucky I dropped in during a quiet moment.”
Tony hummed. “Do me a favor and get a couple of quick scans for me. Photos too and put them on my private server. I want to have a look at his attributes later. Compare and stuff especially if this goes the way I think it will.” The elevator opened with a low beep and she strolled out, coming up to lean against the bar.
anyway though. And no doubt Bucky would be telling her everything because when it came to Nat he became less a metal armed killing machine, and more of a metal armed bunny.
. And here she did listen. She listened because she had all of the information about you and what you’d done. So it turns from
“That’s…good. It’s good.”
The call to Strange was placed and he picked up minutes later. “Hello?”
so that everyone else could be happy and safe.
Rhodey arched a brow. “But from what I gathered none of that is your fault. In fact, without the tether he’d apparently be floating around in space or something, right?”
“How about we just set a time for a nice dinner with everyone who happens to be around?” Rhodey suggested wryly. “I’m here for a while, and Bruce is supposed to get in later today. We could do it tonight.”
“Hey Tony gave as good as he got,” Steve chuckled. “But maybe. You’re not my do over though and really I’m just being honest. Even if Tony and I had never seen eye to eye I wouldn’t use your pain to my advantage. That’s not who I am.”
didn’t change anything. However Toni being
Steve blinked. “What? No I wasn’t—”
“What? Look handsome I’ll buy you another bag. I’ll buy you
“Why don’t we start from the beginning then?” She offered with a tiny smile. “Like…why were you in that alley? Why do you think I should be a guy?”
Steve smiled and folded his arms across his black shirt. “It changed me too. For five years after the snap everyone just sort of coasted, went through the motions of what was expected. After finally getting everyone back there was a different kind of chaos. We had to mourn those lost in the second battle with Thanos while trying to help those five years behind suddenly acclimate to their new worldview. It was…a lot.”
Toni eyed Steve thoughtfully. “Better make it triple. Super soldier and Jolly Green could probably shut down an all you can eat buffet.”
“It happens more than it should,” she replied matter of fact. “But uh, yeah. I can see how something like that would rip apart the team. Kinda fucked up you didn’t tell him, Steve.”
, and when he looked at her with such admiration and pride… Well she never really knew what to do with honest praise. Didn’t know if the goosebumps it caused were a good thing or a bad thing.
Captain. Though don’t tell Carol I said that. But he’s Captain America. Granted from another reality but he’s the real deal. Got stranded here by a time monster…sort of.”
Toni smiled though it didn’t reach her eyes. “Morgan was Pepper’s eccentric Uncle’s name; I liked him. You know I’m happy that Tony Prime got to be a dad and experience that even if it was just for a little while. Howard was—well he a disaster and I always said if I ever had kids I’d make sure they knew how much they were loved. I’d make sure they felt heard.” She bit the inside of her cheek. “I thought Pepper and I might give it a go. Either pick a donor or maybe try to get Rhodey to do it. Kids brought into the world by all the people I love…”
“Because…Peggy is waiting for me. I have to get back to her.”
Grinning, he shook his head and swung again. “My mistake. Did you really just bring me out here to watch me hit balls?”
“Shit so I’ve never actually
Strange snorted lightly. “Hello Stark, how’s the robots? And if you must know I was making tea.”
Toni actually blushed, the apples of her cheeks going faintly pink. “No actually this was, heh well this was Loki’s doing. With that nuke I just—I looked out into the gaping blackness of space and for a while afterwards it was all I saw when I closed my eyes. So I didn’t. Didn’t sleep.” She shrugged and scratched at her chin. “Then an asshole blew up my mansion, nearly killed me and Pepper and shit got rough for a while. Stress, they said caused it. I’ve dyed it but it comes back so…whatever. Hell I mean I guess it’s better than a heart attack so go me.”
“What about surrounded by family? Kids and grandkids?”
“I think—maybe the point is about second chances though. Or hope that somewhere out there, there is a you that gets it right. Whatever
Now that she was down here surrounded by things that brought her joy, she kind of didn’t want to leave. Just the smell of metal and burnt wires put her at ease.
Still watching Toni remind herself that he wasn’t always going to be around didn’t make him feel very good. She knew this arrangement wasn’t permanent but he supposed it had skipped her mind for a minute. Sometimes it skipped his too.
“Just the ones we made ourselves.” Clearing her throat, she cut her eyes to her watch and changed the subject. “Anyway since I doubt you have any other place to go when you’re released, you’re coming back to the Tower with me. Not like I don’t have the room. Pep said she’d take care of like crap you’d need so it should be there already. We’ll prove you’re who you say you are and then…profit.”
In those five years Steve didn’t have much interaction with Tony; nothing that could be considered meaningful anyway. He’d attended his wedding as most of the remaining Avengers had though the ceremony itself had been a subdued affair. After that Tony and Pepper left for their lakeside cabin and Steve had thrown himself into whatever he could to keep his mind off of Thanos and the reality that his friends—that no one snapped—was ever coming back. He’d thought about Tony though and asked Natasha for information when he felt it was appropriate.
Yet his brain chugged along sluggishly and he idly wondered if it had anything to do with ending back up in the future. Or that strange creature.
Steve’s jaw clenched. “We didn’t ask you for commentary. Can you shed any light on the situation or not?”
But tonight as going to be fun, she could tell it already. The food had been steadily arriving since Jarvis had placed the orders and Rhodey was freshly showered and lounging near the living room, making small talk with Steve. They seemed to be getting along though she’d figured as much. They were both very likeable and similar however sometimes Steve got that look in his eyes. The one that whispered secrets about another Rhodey in another reality….one that was now missing his best friend. Really it was enough to make Toni wanna spirit him here so that he’d never have to be sad again. If one Rhodey was awesome then two Rhodeys would be downright tremendous.
“I gathered she’s always been into Captain America because of her dad. For better or worse.”
“Who’s the hottie?”
While Steve went to check out where he would be staying, Toni made a beeline to her room and shrugged out of her clothes. She slipped into warm comfortable pjs and brushed the wet tangles out of her hair, blow drying it before putting it in a ponytail. As she put her damp clothes in the hamper for someone to deal with later, she replayed the night’s events like a slideshow in her brain and laughed. Really?
“Jarvis, lights at one fifty please,” she requested, blinking as the brightness amped up. “Shit, Steve. You should be in medical!”
She nodded. “He does. I think he wants more time with his best friend. First and foremost though he wants you to be happy. Anyway just think about it.” She left just as soundlessly as she’d appeared.
you know? But even when we do fight there is a lot of love there. Hell love is usually the reason. You and Tony Prime loved each other otherwise things wouldn’t have been able to get so heated.”
That made him bristle with anger. “Me being Captain America is bullshit but
“And what if I can’t do it?” Her big brown eyes fixed on his face. “What if I can’t get you back to Peggy?”
She smiled. “Nope. Lucky you for—I’m super pleasant to be around.”
It was obvious Bucky and Toni weren’t the best of friends but they were civil, able to rib each other despite the horrible circumstances that brought them together. Over the years they’d found an even ground and while it filled Steve’s heard with joy to see, it also made him sad. Would Tony and Bucky Prime have circled this way if he’d told the truth instead of lying for so long? Would Tony have been able to forgive the man who killed his parents and taken him in simply because Steve had asked…the way Natasha did here?
Flustered, Toni pulled away from him and walked over to the far side of the lab where DUM-E was “organizing” a pile of junk.
“Good morning Toni,” he said with a smile.
“Of course not.” She frowned and looked at him over her shoulder. “But then I’m smart enough to come up with another solution. Honestly…your earnest—ness is a bit…jarring. There.”
“Hey Jarvis, what does Toni do when she’s alone in the Tower? I mean besides creating…”
“It looks good on you. Why…why didn’t you ask any of the other Avengers for help?”
“If you hug me I’m hitting you with this bat,” she replied with a strained chuckle. Steve just smiled.
Pain erupted in Steve’s temple, and he gripped the edge of the bed so hard the metal railing dented. “I—I don’t… What the hell is going on?! Tony Stark is a man and he died. I—Bruce! Where is Bruce, I wanna talk to Bruce Banner.”
Steve shifted in his chair. Even though part of him regretted Bucky seeing him check Toni out, the other part was happy to see his friend able to joke and clown around again. Gave him hope that Bucky Prime would become the same way one day. “Serves him right if you ask me.”
to belong because of Peggy but you could probably belong anywhere. Not to mention the Time Wraith probably put you here for a reason. I’d wager we figure out that reason before attempting to send you back or it might just toss you here again. Or someplace worse.”
Steve arched a brow. “What do you want Toni to build, exactly?”
, and honestly Steve had agreed. He’d assumed they would have a conversation after Thanos was defeated and ultimately they did…just not the one Steve had anticipated.
“This place is very similar to home so it’s not super hard,” Steve explained. “And anything I don’t get Toni is there to bring me up to speed.”
“Hey Cap!” She’d already flung his door opened when it occurred to her that perhaps she should have knocked first. “I—oh.”
The woman shushed him and pushed him into the front seat of her car. “What you need is a doctor and a bunch of x-rays to prove you don’t have internal bleeding.”
Steve swallowed thickly. “Toni knows you killed her parents?”
“It’s okay, Toni.” Steve stepped closer so that his chest brushed her back. “I want to talk to him too. There won’t be any violence.”
it was, some kind of tattered robe draped thing—rise out of the ground and screech at him. It had hollow holes for eyes and fangs for teeth, and it screamed directly at him like he’d somehow managed to offend it simply by standing there.
“Fuck. Sounds familiar.” Bucky rubbed his chin. “Okay. Steve rescues me during the war. Where? And what’s the first thing we say to each other?”
“Thanos destroyed it…or most of it. I left it with Bruce to take care of.”
she was not a stranger to. Okay maybe
She strolled over to the railing and looked down, hands rubbing at the smooth metal. “Yup. I kinda own a farm. Moving on I won’t be nosy and ask what you and Rhodey talked about because I have an idea. I’d apologize but it does make me warm and fuzzy when people have my back.”
“Why not?”
Steve looked for something to throw at him. “Shut up dipshit. Next sparring session I’m putting your ass through the ring.”
“Right on all fronts.”
) but Steve had scoffed at the idea. Who in their right mind would fly over three thousand miles just for sushi? And Tony had laughed in that way he did and said
She gestured to the man in question. “I’m sure Steve wouldn’t mind taking you. Not like either of you have anything better to do until Doctor Strange contacts you.”
“He is,” Pepper admitted with a chuckle. “So can I meet the infamous Steve Rogers or do you plan to keep him all to yourself?”
“I’m fine, Toni. I heal quickly…you know that.” His baby blues were soft as he gazed down at her. “It was worse than this but it’ll be gone soon.”
It had never escaped her notice that had it not been for her big heart and general pleasant attitude, she easily could have slipped into the super villain lifestyle. Sometimes she thought it could have been worth it just for the leather pants.
“Captain Rogers if I may, you never speak of an alternate
“Almost five am,” Steve told her. “I thought you went to bed. What have you been doing?”
Judith’s responding giggle was high pitched with twin spots of red appearing on her cheeks. “Thank you so much.” She turned to Toni. “Marry this one dear. If you don’t, I just might.” And then she was gently pushing Adam out of the room and towards the elevator.
Five years was the blink of an eye compared to sixty or seventy.
Adam snorted but he was grinning. “Mom…”
His smile was a bit secretive as he got up to walk over to where she sat. “You are pretty good when it comes to making plans. I think it’s worth seeing what Strange might have to say. At the very least we could find out why the Wraith dropped me here instead of back where I’m from.”
Steve sighed. “A little. Just thinking about our conversation earlier and wondering what if. And…”
Her expression softened. “Maybe 1945 isn’t your place, Steve. I know you don’t want to hear that but it could be true. Some things happen for a reason. Look at all the shit that went down for me to become Iron Woman. Obie and Gulmira and Yinsen in that cave. Take out even one and things could have ended up differently. Without Yinsen I would have died. Without Obie being a back stabbing bald fuck head and selling me out, I never would have been kidnapped or possibly even gotten the idea to be Iron Woman.” Coming closer, she put her hand on his shoulder. “It’s possible 1945 didn’t need Cap anymore.”
Toni made a face like she’d just sucked on a lemon. “I know Hank Pym didn’t like my dad and that he passed that bullshit onto Scott where I was concerned. I know they’re what Scott uses in his suit to grow big or small. So shot in the dark? You used the Quantum Realm to travel in time to collect the stones, and you needed Pym Particles to shrink down. Afterwards you used the same particles to travel to 1945 to get alternate with Aunt Peggy. How am I doing so far?”
for them. I get to threaten him about treating her right while teasing him about not missing a date because—ya know—he might be doing something for me. It’s…it was an adjustment but I’m flexible. I’m good.”
Toni found Steve sitting on the soft brown shag carpet in front of the sofa, fiddling with something in his hands. He seemed distracted and perhaps with her bare feet it was easy to sneak up on him and peer over his shoulder. Or he just knew she wasn’t a threat so his senses weren’t on high alert. Either way when she peeped over she noticed the
Steve smirked. “Little old ladies have always loved me. I like to think they see a kindred spirit in me.”
She considered his question. “No. Wait. No It—it’ll be fine. This city has survived the Chitauri, Thanos and Bruce when Starbucks ran out of pumpkin spice lattes. You might want to grab an umbrella though.” Before anyone could reply, she blew the front valve off the nearest fire hydrant, sending a cascade of cold water gushing up into the air. Picking up a car door that had accidentally been ripped off, she used it to direct the flow so that it flowed over the soldiers. “Shower time!”
“Maybe?”
“You’re right. That does sound crazy,” Bucky retorted.
“Like I said before Cap, I’ve seen the footage of you working that shield and while looks can be faked, that kinda thing can’t be,” she explained. “Dad uh, he said you chose the shield and then it was like the shield chose you. Unless you want me to do a full blood work up and DNA testing, I’m willing to believe you are Steve Rogers from another reality.”
Nat hummed. “C’mon Toni you can explain all of this to me in more detail. Let the guys catch up.”
“Then focus on the future,” Bucky interrupted. “I can’t bring Howard and Maria back, but I can fight alongside their kid when she needs it. So I do.”
“Sweetheart I hate to burst your bubble but
could ever think Tony didn’t have a heart. If anything he had too much. Like you.”
Completely unoffended by her taunt, Bucky flipped them both off and disappeared down the hallway. “Nightie night!”
him.”
a Tony Stark but I have no insider knowledge about Steve Rogers.”
to do with crackers.
They spent about thirty more minutes at the ball park and Toni did manage to hit a few balls, though they didn’t go nearly as far as Steve’s had. Before leaving she signed some baseballs for a group of kids and took photos, introducing Steve as her new bodyguard. Then they hit a vendor up for hot dogs and ate them on a bench while people quickly went about their afternoon.
Pulling up the sleeves of her black long sleeved shirt, she held up her right hand, gave it a twist at the wrist and then popped it clean off. Silently she laid it on the table. “The front of the gauntlet broke which was actually a good thing because otherwise I doubt my small fingers would have been able to work the giant finger holes. Nanotech is amazing, Steve. It bonded with the stones easy peasy and then it was just a matter of snapping people back. You know back when I had palladium poisoning and I made that new element to cure myself, I thought I’d felt power when I shoved that arc reactor into my chest…but I was wrong. Those stones man. Those stones.”
Bruce and Rhodey snorted in unison. “I’ve been running routine diagnostics,” Bruce replied with a smirk. “Steve’s cells are incredible. That accident in the artic must have been very severe for the Steve Rogers here not to survive.”
“Rhodey look what I’ve got.” Toni poked him in the shoulder and gestured to Steve. “May I present Captain Steven Rogers aka Captain Amercia. Fresh from another universe and still with that brand new Captain America smell.”
was Steve
“Oh…I won’t mind if he doesn’t,” Judith said with a cheeky wink. “He has such a cute butt.”
Toni grinned widely. “Hey no worries, Judy fruit. I’ll pop on the armor and move the fridge. Bout time I looked behind there anyway. Make sure a dust colony hasn’t evolved into its own species.”
“Pardon the interruption, Ms. Stark…” Jarvis sounded downright regretful for breaking the tender moment but his voice caused Steve to gently release Toni, his face hot and a little pink. He honestly couldn’t remember the last time he’d blushed, or why he was even blushing now.
Steve
Their…heart to heart the other night had rattled in her brain long after Steve was asleep in his room. Though to be fair most of their conversations tended to linger inside of her mind like spider webs in an old doorway; thick and sticky and hell to get out of your hair. While she still wasn’t a fan of deep conversations that made her turn to self reflection, older age had taught her that sometimes these things were needed. That in order to move forward—to heal—you had to tackle the pain otherwise it would consume you. The creation of B.A.R.F had been her way to help not only herself but others that found themselves stuck in a loop of bullshit.
“Queens,” he says.
But the comments underneath. Sure, there are the slurs and the curses, the regular rhythm of nastiness that seems to be life on the Internet these days, but the one that really burrows under Steve’s skin to live, like a writhing tick—“of course Stark only shows up when it’s fun, so performative #corporatepride.” It uncurls something vicious that makes Steve’s jaw clamp down reflexively.
He didn’t emerge for three days.
“The point isn’t winning, and you know it,” Steve says. “I’ve been reading. I wasn’t there before. I want to be here now.”
“Hmm,” she says. He’s going to have to do better than that.
“So he was there when it started,” she continues. “When we all started getting sick. Crystal, she was the first to go, poor thing. She got real thin and we were all jealous. But then she started getting the—you know. The cancer on her face, the spots.”
Steve sighs and looks up at the constellation of steel crowding out the daylight sky. It’s not a
“I’m not—I’m not impenetrable, Tony.”
“Mhm,” she purrs. “And the rest of you, too.”
“Wait,” Tony says, and he looks up at him then, hard and unflinching. “
“I did something I shouldn’t have,” he blurts.
“Well, that was before I figured it all out,” she says, and gestures at herself. “Being a queen was a way to be myself before I knew how to be myself, you know?”
“Why?”
“—that I
“I know it was wrong. I should have—respected him more than that.”
, but science is—it
“That you saved New York City?”
He’s so busy trying out variations on his name that he almost misses Tony’s car peeling out of the garage. He shoves his phone in his pocket and jogs after it. In Manhattan traffic, it’s easy to follow the Porsche, going down Park for a couple blocks, then a left onto East 36th. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” Steve mutters to himself when Tony takes it onto the FDR drive ramp, but follows as best he can, peeling off to take the bridge into Brooklyn. He spots the car on the turn, tucks his face under the disguise of the Yankees cap, and keeps on running. They go for a while, through Red Hook and Sunset Park. It’s easier to run here when he’s fixed on a bright yellow rumbling reminder of modernity.
,” Tony says and launches himself at Steve.
Steve doesn’t mean to follow him, exactly. He knows it’s wrong, and probably “super creepy” as either a) Clint or, dark horse, b) Natasha would tell him, but he—he doesn’t know why. He knows why it’s apparently creepy. He doesn’t know why he does it anyway.
“Whiteboard?”
“Oh,” he says. He’d read about it, in one of the brick files SHIELD had given him in his first weeks back. A terrible, mysterious disease.
He’d figured it out too late.
“We have to talk about what happens next. About telling people. Because—because I don’t know about you, but I’m here. I’m in it for the long haul.”
“What stopped him?”
Because he knows that Tony shows up when it’s hard—of all of them, he’s the one that shows up after the damage is done; when they’ve saved a lot of people but not all of them. He shakes hands and takes pictures and gets his hands dirty finding toys and photo albums and documents in the wreckage.
“It was wrong to be jealous?”
“I—followed someone.”
“You followed me.”
“Hello,” he says, even as all the pieces click into place. It’d be rude to just leave. “Ma’am. I’m a—friend. Of Tony’s. Tony Stark’s friend.”
“Because you were a threat,” Steve says, standing up. “I wasn’t there, but I—I know. Who you were was a threat. I knew that if I survived the war—Buck always said I couldn’t keep my mouth shut for love or money. I would’ve ended up locked up somewhere down at Fort Knox, probably.”
“Haha,” Tony says, but he’s not laughing, and he shuts off the flame. “Okay, you know you can’t knock me up, right? You don’t have to—”
“He did research and he would show it to us every week. Different things that might help. But that’s never been his forte, as hard as he tried, poor thing.”
Well, shit. There’s nothing for it, if he wants to keep her from writing “stalker” in his patient notes later—and, really, he’s tired of carrying it around, tight in his chest. Heavy, like an anchor, which can give you safe harbor, but also drags in the deep. “Because I always want to know where he is. Not in a—I don’t want to control where he goes, and I think he—I think he should be allowed to have secrets. I know it was wrong. I just wanted to—I want to be there with him.”
—it’s just important to me. That we tell people.”
There’s an old woman sitting in the corner, bloodred hair unnaturally bright in the sunlight. Her hands are folded in the lap of her pink and lavishly embroidered robe, and when she turns to look at him, he sees a dark smear of kohl around her eyes, and slash of magenta lipstick painted on her mouth.
Say what you want about Steve, but he isn’t
“Why would I look for bad opinions?” Steve said.
,” and it sounds like Tony’s seething, working himself up into a full rage, “who do you think I
“Yes. It was wrong and unfair. I have no right to be jealous, we haven’t even—I thought. Sometimes he asks me to sleep with him.”
, absolutely
She sits back and waits. It hadn’t been unnerving until he’d looked that up, too, that therapists wait their patients out because most people can’t bear the extended silence. The quiet had been nice until he’d known.
“But you don’t,” Tony snaps, vivid again. “They didn’t get to get married, or have kids, or hold hands on the boardwalk, not without getting punched for it, anyway, they didn’t get to
“No—”
It’s—unfair. And Steve’s never done well with unfair.
He looks past her at the painting. “It’s so hard,” he says, after some time, “to find a foothold. Everything changes so fast.”
Of course it had been strange. He’s mostly gotten over the strangeness of it now, but his only other experience with this kind of thing had been less—antagonistic. Notwithstanding Peggy shooting at him in the lab that one time. It had been smooth, a natural slide, a refrain of choruses he’d heard before. He hadn’t known what he was supposed to do, but he’d known what was supposed to happen. He’d been to the movies.
Tony looks at him for a long time. “You know we might not win. Not in our lifetime. Not in the next.”
,” Steve says, helpless in his defensiveness. “No, I did it because—because I wanted to know. Where he went.”
—the adolescent soda can pop of giddiness. He has a boyfriend, and he’s going to tell the world.
It happens late, in the kitchen, where Steve is sitting on a bar stool and eating an apple and tasting nothing, and then Tony is standing in front of him, face graven with a rare and trembling anger.
“So it wouldn’t have been too different.”
“What’re you going to do about it?” Miranda echoes in his memory.
, sure, super
“No,” Tony says. “Absolutely not, there is always a choice—”
. But holing himself up in the workshop is an indicator of a bad mood; of discontent. And in discontent, Tony tends to build weapons.
“Sure.” Steve’s trying not to blink. Something about this moment’s important, fraught with a meaning that he can’t quite parse. He feels the gravity of it pull him closer to Tony anyway, but he can’t tell if this is more or less than the usual tilt of his world into Tony’s orbit. “I wasn’t there, but you were still fighting for—for us. For people like us.”
“What,” she smacks at her computer screen through a wad of gum.
“I wasn’t—it’s not a contest, Tony,” Steve says. “I was trying to tell you that I understand.”
It’s odd because Steve thought—he knows what lipstick means, but he’d thought he and Tony had sort of a. “A Thing”—another Clint-ism—maybe Tony thought their Thing wasn’t quite as
But there was no model for whatever this was, this push-pull-snap-snarl, the way that wanting to shake Tony and hold him tight were very closely related emotions. (Besides, Steve only wanted to shake him a little. Just enough to rattle his teeth).
“He took to the streets with us,” she says. “When enough of us realized that nobody was coming to save us. Just a baby, standing and screaming and holding a sign. Came to the meetings, too. He brought food and he brought his whiteboard.”
“Thank you, Jarvis.” Steve looked to the ceiling, expression wistful.
His hair was shorter, like it had been in 1945 Steve observed. “It’s true. I am Steve Rogers.”
Toni folded her arms over her damp suit jacket. “He’s at a convention in Washington but I could get him on the phone if you really need to talk to him. How do you know Bruce?
Steve would always regret not being able to save Tony because if anyone deserved to live and see what they’d accomplished, it was Tony. He deserved to be there for his daughter, to see her grow up and become an amazing young woman. Pepper deserved her husband alive. Death was a part of war but it never got any easier. It was never ever fair to lose someone you cared about.
to know. “Buck I—how are you here? Don’t get me wrong I’m happy that you’re not still under Hydra’s control but I sort of played a big part in breaking their hold on you. I assumed without me…well…”
Toni eased around until she was standing next to Steve, shielding him with her body. “He’s…Steve Rogers. Not
“You have a point,” Steve responded with a touch of amusement. “Otherwise I’d just be giving into Toni’s mad shirtless plans for me.”
“Oh c’mon we both know you could bench press a BMW if you wanted to,” Toni teased. “Hello Adam.”
“The Battle of New York was insane but it sounds like yours was too. Loki and the Tesseract. Aliens pouring out of a hole in the sky and the newly formed Avengers trying to stop it all.” He reached for another pancake. “All things considered we worked pretty well together. Fury’s Council sent a nuke that would have destroyed the city and Tony flew it into the portal. Which you did so…”
he wanted it for. But he wants me to build him a
“And you think he’s, what? Using you as a crutch because his Tony died?” Rhodey inquired slowly. “That’s a dick move if true.”
Tony while looking at her. There was so much pain in his clear blue eyes though. Threatening to leak down around all of his carefully crafted edges. “You’re not going to incapacitate me or turn me into SHIELD, are you?” he inquired.
people cared was enough. It meant she didn’t have to reach out during a bad moment. Just knowing someone was there to reach back…made her feel all warm inside.
Either way she totally understood why anyone who saw him might want to climb him like a tree. Even just standing and listening to others talk he tended to command the room. Arms folded or hands resting on his belt, feet shoulder width a part and always ready for action…
destroyed him and his army.
Steve shoved his hands into his pockets. “Toni tells me that you know all about Thanos because you fought him here too, except things ended differently. Well in my reality after he was defeated I took it upon myself to return the Infinity Stones to their rightful locations. Afterwards I—I decided to stay in 1945 for…personal reasons. I was there for about a month when a Time Wraith ripped me away and dropped me here.” His bright blue eyes shifted to Toni. “Toni has been helping me and taking care of me while we try to figure stuff out.”
She arched a brow. “Shoot.”
Toni rolled her big brown eyes. “Why does this sound like the beginning of an intervention?”
“No,” she replied slowly. “It’s reinforced so go nuts. There isn’t any like, tension there right? It’s none of my business but…”
Besides it was almost nice to tell
“You never… why didn’t you say anything?” Steve asks, still trying to wrap his mind around what Tony’s just told him.

“All of them!” Tony exclaims happily.
the man.)
“But you didn’t, Clint,” Steve assures him, leaning forward and placing a hand on the archer’s ankle, “You didn’t. I’ll talk to Tony and make sure he understands that he can’t jump on people and startle them like that. Especially you and Natasha. Just take a deep breath. You didn’t hurt him, he’s fine.”
“Our trainers said we had to be trained to be good before they could sell us to our new owners. They said our parents didn’t want us any more because we were bad. Bad children are only good as slaves.”
Fury glares at Clint, but it doesn't do much good since it's the same look he has no matter what the situation. Opting to simply ignore the archer instead of say something, Fury turns back to Banner.
"I don't just like you either," Tony confirms, initiating a kiss of his own, "So are we official then? We're dating now?"
“Did you have a good run? Can I go with you next time? Clint told me he shoots a bow just like Robin Hood! And that some of his arrows even
“Only forty seven days. We’re not very good yet,” his head jerks up suddenly and he looks at Clint earnestly, “But we’ll try really hard, I promise! We learn really fast! And my brother is working really hard on not coughing so much. He’s getting better! We’ll be really good and do everything you say!”
"Steve. Tony. Let's go home. It's been a long night and I'm sure you're tired. We can talk about this in the morning," Natasha offers, pushing her chair back to stand.
“Yeah!”
It isn’t so much the words that make the entire team feel suddenly angry and heartbroken at the same time. It’s the tone of resignation. As though Tony is used to coming second to everything. It makes all of them want to either put their fist through a wall, or pull the boy close and never let him go.
“And when you’re done shooting apples, we can make an apple pie out of what ever’s left,” Steve suggests, taking Tony back into his arms.
"The way they talk. I suppose some of it might be the training they under went, but their minds seem much more mature than those of four year olds," she says. She looks at the security feed of the living room and sighs sadly when the boys slide off the couch where Clint put them and kneel back on the floor. "If it was just Tony I would chalk it up to his natural genius, but Steve seems more mature as well. Maybe their minds didn't regress as far as their bodies did?"
"JARVIS. Page the team. Tell them to meet me in the gym," she requests of the AI.
"I will. You focus on turning them back, we'll handle things down here."
“I am so sorry.”
"I know, I know. We won't ever let them hurt you ever again," Clint whispers into the dark hair, holding his small friend tightly.
to be together, right? That was the idea behind this conversation?" Steve asks, suddenly unsure.
“Come on, Bruce! It’ll be fun! You and me together, showing up those know-it-alls over at SHIELD, kicking butt, taking names, it’ll be fun!” Tony says encouragingly, putting himself between Bruce and his computer screen.
Natasha looks up from her paper with a look that clearly wants to know if he has suddenly developed a death wish. He sighs and doesn’t let the look get to him. He’s almost completely certain she’d never
you. I’m simply taking advantage of the fact that your… outgoing personality tends to rub a lot of people the wrong way.” Steve says, laying a calming hand on Tony’s arm.
It's been hours since the boys ran away and JARVIS woke the rest of the team, and so far they haven't been able to find the lost boys. They thought they'd found heat signatures leaving the mansion, but the nights have been so hot and muggy it's interfering with JARVIS's satellite sensors. Having tiny targets doesn't help either.
There is silence for a long moment when Steve pauses to let his team process this information. Thankfully, they recover just as fast as he had (which he supposes shouldn’t be too surprising considering the amount of strange and unexplainable things they’ve all seen in their Avenging line of work.)
"I have already sealed away Mr. Stark's suits, and the door to his lab has been sealed and hidden as well. I do not believe either child will be able to find them."
Steve chuckles a little at how similar little Tony is to his adult self, and smiles.
"Always did wonder if the serum made all of you bigger. I take it your size is... significant?" Clint asks, no hint of teasing in his voice, understanding how difficult this conversation is for the Captain, and honestly wanting to help his two friends figure things out. Steve nods. Clint puffs out a breath of air, thinking of the best way to answer, "Okay, there's a couple of options. You could start with a set of toys that get bigger in increments, and work your way up to actual penetration, or... and I think this is the better option, you could use
Steve repeats what Clint had told him that morning, helping Tony off his lap and pulling out a bag from the nightstand drawer. He dumps the contents on the bedspread, and a small toy, just barely bigger than a finger drops out, along with a large bottle of lube.
Natasha's blood runs cold at the code word and the tone in Clint's voice, and she immediately knows that something is terribly, horribly wrong.
Steve snorts at Clint's remarks, which he assumes are paraphrased, because even though Tony has a nearly eidetic memory, he still likes to shorten things when they shouldn't be and elaborate when he doesn't need to. Steve thinks it's one of his more endearing traits, though it can get a bit tiresome during battle, but he thinks those days are long over.
And don't worry. There's more to come!
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony is sitting at the kitchen table, his tool box sitting open next to him. Clint’s bow (which he had left there when he’d volunteered to stay with Tony,) is laying in pieces all over the table’s surface. When Tony see’s Clint he smiles broadly.
“Cool!” Tony responds, looking at Thor and grinning widely when the demigod tosses the hammer into the air and then catches it deftly.
"I know," she says, standing and going to stand behind him, running her arms around him, "I've been doing the same. But we can't keep dwelling on it. They need our help right now. God willing Bruce and the others will find a way to turn them back quickly, but in the mean time... we have two scared little boys to take care of and teach to be kids again. And I need your help."
He wakes slowly from a pleasant dream. He and Natasha have finally had a chance to go on a real vacation and they are lying on the beach slowly exploring each others bodies. Her hands feel like heaven as they roam his chest and slip lower, sliding down his zipper and pulling his half hard and very interested cock out of his pants. The soft silk of her skin brings him to full arousal quickly, her knowledge of his body evident. She leans down and gently licks the underside of his shaft.
"It's fine the way it is," Steve says sternly, glaring at the smaller man for emphasis, "Keep your genius explosions away from it."
“Hey, go back to sleep,” Steve says softly, “Everything’s fine.”
The boy in her lap quickly shakes his head, a small look of fear flashing behind his eyes. He glances over to the still sleeping Steve who is resting in Clint’s lap. Hawkeye smiles gently at him, and shifts Steve a little so Tony can see his face.
“Clint! Clint! Clint! It’s morning! You said you’d do the apple trick! It’s morning! Time to get up!”
Tony fidgets for a moment, wringing his hands in front of him, before answering.
"Are you okay?"
“I’ll explain on the jet,” is all the explanation Steve gives before turning and heading for the roof.
Bruce puts a comforting hand on his friend's shoulder.
Steve freezes for a moment at the words, trying not to let his shock show on his face. He forces himself to recover quickly, and leans down to give the boy a quick kiss on the forehead.
“Why don’t I like the sound of that?” Rhodey asked in amusement. “Should we be worried?”
Toni shrugged. “No problem. I do sorta owe you for running you down with my car. Hope there aren’t any dents. I’ll never hear the end of it from Happy if there are. Ooh maybe I’ll tell him that I heroically swerved to avoid hitting the cutest puppy you’ve ever seen, and in the process hit a bunch of trash cans. We just won’t mention this little hospital visit.” She took out her phone, thumbs flying across the screen. “Yeah that’s totally believable. And if your Cap stuff pans out we’ll alert whoever is at the Tower about your deal. If anyone is there—people come and go and refuse to use the sign out sheet. You uh, you gonna be okay seeing other versions of your friends?”
Maybe he should make an account. Other people seem to be able to lose themselves there for hours. Sometimes Steve feels like he could use a little losing himself. Plus, he doesn’t know what a “hot take” is, and that could be important. He tries to sign up but both the usernames “steverogers” and “captainamerica” are taken. It suggests “steverogers29384” but that feels a little clunky to him.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, but he doesn’t know why. It often feels like he’s only having half a conversation with Tony, that there are great pieces of it breaking off, like the glaciers in the Arctic. He’d seen a documentary, pieces of ice sinking below to drift and melt into the abyss below. He’s clutching at them now. “I didn’t—I didn’t want to make you feel uncomfortable.”
“It shouldn’t have to be,” Steve says, turning his hand over to press his palm against hers. “It shouldn’t have to be this way—”
“Fort Knox is underwater,” Tony says.
“And look what it’s brought us. Look where it’s brought us. Sometimes you have no choice.”
But he can’t stop thinking about Tuesdays. It was clear that it wasn’t—it wasn’t a lipstick rendezvous, or whatever they were calling it these days. Howard and his wife had died in an accident. Maybe Tony had a living grandmother, or something—smart to keep her hidden, Steve thinks. He shouldn’t have followed him. Now two of them have the intel.
When Toni was younger there were times that she hated how differently her mind worked when compared to other people. That she could solve things in seconds when it took other people hours. That she could just
Toni flinched. Not a lot—anyone else probably would have missed it but he saw it and immediately felt like an asshole. “Toni I’m sorry. I—”
Steve thought in amusement.
thing.”
Or always on guard…
Different reality aside the only person who seemed different was Bucky, and that was largely due to Nat’s influence and the absence of the Civil War. Yet as he’d been sitting around the dinner table earlier filled with familiar faces, he couldn’t push down that feeling that he was an outsider, especially considering the circumstances. It hadn’t been as debilitating as when he’d discovered he’d apparently traveled seventy years into the future but it’d still did his head in. In another life these people were his friends, his allies. He’d fought side by side with them and sometimes against them, but he’d never thought he’d actually have to start over where they were concerned. Introduce himself. Shake hands. Be the subject of Bruce’s excited questions and Rhodey’s quiet stares. But in a way he guessed it was the meeting he’d never got with the others, a calmer meeting without the influence of Loki’s scepter or what have you.
are why your Captain is here…or why he’s staying here without trouble from the Wraith. Apparently there is a powerful tether rooting Steve to this dimension. That’s what the red and gold is…”
“I’d be okay, I’d handle it.” She stood and started to pace. “You know the other you would do it.
And then Siberia.
“So, Toni mentioned you’re adjusting here pretty well.”
Steve laughed. “Sorry. So…do you know who or
Back when they’d found Cap dead in the ice, she’d wondered how differently things would’ve turned out if he’d lived. Would they have fought side by side against Loki and his Chitauri? Would he be living here in the tower with everyone else? Enjoying their dumb movie nights and game nights where Natasha cheated at Monopoly and Thor lost at Sorry. Would they be friends? Would he have even liked her?
“You know I saw you checking out Stark’s ass.”
. Resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.”
Toni snickered. “How about I get that fridge out of the way so we can get your jewelry? As much as I’d love to keep you here to myself, I know your adoring public awaits.”
Quite a bit was even after the fact.
“Oh Mr. Rogers, be careful what you ask for. You’re going to need a cigarette by the time I’m done.”
“My eyes are up
these things are?”
moments.” Her eyes drifted down to his hands. They were smoother than she’d thought they’d be; gloves probably kept the calluses at bay when it came to handling the shield. “How are you?”
Exhaling deeply, she ran through several different questions in her mind, trying to pinpoint the one that provided the most amount of information yet wouldn’t tip him off about Steve. “Have you ever heard of something called a Time Wraith?”
“Oh yeah? Why is that?” he asked curiously.
It got worse when everyone left.
“Oh.” Toni snickered and slipped her arms around his shoulders, standing on tip toe and squeezing. “You’re so solid yet this is so comfortable. Like a new mattress.”
However in my defense that fish tank called my dead mother a whore.”
look and for a moment it was
Steve sniffed and wiped a hand across his face. “You don’t—it’s more than Thanos. You know for a month I didn’t think about any of this shit. With Peggy it was just regular day to day stuff. What’s for dinner and what are we doing tonight. I knew the SHIELD stuff would come because I’d never keep Peggy from her potential but for a while we were normal. I was normal.”
“True love,” Toni cooed. “Steve is Captain America. I’m sure even
Maybe the serum just let the outside actually reflect what had always been inside.
“You’re like a freaking space heater.” Toni knocked her forehead to his bicep. “Surprised you didn’t melt all that ice within a year.”
“Ms. Stark spends her time undertaking several humanitarian duties, as well as personally awarding scholarships to young people via her foundation. She speaks at formal events, does surprise visits to her interns and continues on as the figurehead to Stark Industries. She also spends time in Queens looking after Mr. Parker.”
“So you want to what? Pay rent? Lift heavy things for my amusement?” Steve chuckled so she continued. “This is the Avengers tower and you’re an Avenger. Speaking of which should I leave the shield out for you or…? I mean no pressure of course but if like, a giant herd of frogs attack would you want to fight them off with me or stay on the bench? With staying on the bench being a totally valid option especially after everything you’ve been through.”
“Hey I should get points for focusing on what mattered before ogling you. Needless to say however I am not disappointed by the view. The last person I had the urge to motorboat this bad was named Cinnamon.”
other solution he would have taken it in a heartbeat.” Strange squared his shoulders, glancing down as his cape nuzzled against his cheek. “
Then SHIELD imploded and it was just one cluster fuck after the other. Clint’s farm had been nice even if the reasons for being there were anything but. During a quiet moment he’d sat on the porch and just
Steve chuckled. “He annoys Clint? I can’t really remember if the Clint and Bucky of my reality interacted that much, except during the whole Civil War thing. And then it was only because they were on my…side.”
Steve hadn’t been particularly happy in Washington while doing his stint for SHIELD. He hadn’t completely hated it; the work was decent and he’d assumed he was making a real difference in the world by saving people and thwarting threats. The city itself was lovely and he’d enjoyed catching up on what he’d missed, something that got only better once Sam entered the picture. However he’d honestly never gelled there. The pipes in his sad little apartment had rumbled at night, and none of his neighbors ever stopped by to say hello. Not even Sharon when she’d been a fake nurse. So really when he wasn’t working he’d just bum around wishing there was something to do. Wondering if he called any of the other Avengers would they pick up?
“Oh?” Grinning he took her seat at the counter, hands resting in his lap. “Are—are you actually going to share your feelings with me? Wow. You really are
to reply—and Pepper strolled out in all of her CEO glory. She did not look mad. “Toni,” she said with a touch of relief. “Are you alright? I was worried when
So I'm alive lol and ❤ for sticking around. I really appreciate it.
Just as he was about to reply, the elevator beeped and the door heaved open with two figures walking out. Steve’s words choked off and he just stared, not sure which of them punched him in the gut more. “…Bucky?”
“Holy shit,” Toni whispered. “You’re—I—okay. Should I salute you or..?”
Strange smiled. “Yes I can see that. Perhaps you should start from the beginning if you don’t mind.”
She smiled. “Sure. Guess we’ll have to find other ways to entertain ourselves then. Shirtless calendar is still on the table. I could have Pepper set it up in seconds. We could get you a flag and everything.”
Steve’s stare burned her skin with a fire-like intensity and although she didn’t want to meet it she didn’t exactly have a choice. It stripped her bare and had she been wearing the armor, the face plate would have snapped down thinking she needed protection. As it were however nothing sheltered her from those expressive blue eyes; she was just surprised to see no trace of resentment or blame in them. After all he was floating in this reality—and not back with Peggy—because of her. She hadn’t actively done anything but it made a morose bit of sense that it was her fault.
“This might be really strange for you,” Steve said softly. “It’s the same for me. I—where I come from things—circumstances happened that couldn’t happen here so I—seeing you is throwing me a bit.”
“Gotta get to the bottom of that,” she said aloud. “It’s the neighborly thing to do. Jarvis put the kettle on.”
“Yeah.”
Anyway though after easing into a parking space and cutting the engine, she’d just stared at him…alright she was still staring at him. The entire situation was insane but she’d seen aliens pour out of a hole in the sky so, yeah. She’d roll with it. Besides if a raccoon could talk then a Steve Rogers from a different reality could tumble into hers. Finding out why was the real point, and maybe getting him home later if that’s what he wanted.
need a plus one otherwise I’m liable to feed all the orphans or fix all the broken fire hydrants in the city.”
Steve stretched his arms out in front of him and Toni smirked but didn’t say anything. He rolled his eyes without any heat and said, “Any theories on who sent those assholes to terrorize us?”
Fury exhaled deeply and tiredly. “Motherfucker. Stark, what the fuck did you do
There was a tiny wrinkle between Steve’s brows but whether it was from anger or confusion was anyone’s guess. “She was a he, actually. Anthony Stark. Iron Man,” he replied. “And honestly they’re like two peas in a pod sometimes. I see differences; some small and others gigantic. But if I had to pick one thing they have in common it would be the selfless desire to protect even if it means they suffer in the process. And shouldering blame even when they aren’t at fault.”
Suddenly Toni’s voice was drowned out by a loud alarm echoing throughout the building. “Ah fuck…” She took off running towards the elevator and Steve followed. “The one night I didn’t wear the arc reactor to dinner and assholes are on the prowl. Big ones if J is sounding the alarm.”
Steve slid off the bed and picked up his duffle bag. “I could eat.”
“I’d known about what you did to Howard and Maria for a while and I’d kept it from Tony. I said it was to protect him but…it was more for me than him. Zemo showed him footage of you murdering them and—and fuck. It’s us against Tony.” Steve frowned deeply. “He wanted to kill you and I couldn’t let that happen. What you did as the Soldier wasn’t your fault. But he wouldn’t—he wouldn’t…I kept thinking if he would just stop, if he would just
meant for things to get that out of hand. He’d just wanted to save his best friend and yes he hadn’t agreed with the Accords but what came after wasn’t something he wanted. Knowing that it was his fault the Avengers weren’t together to stop Thanos the first time. Knowing that in some twisted way Tony’s death was his fault because—because…
“After the shit I’ve seen? It’s just another Thursday. I mean it is a bit surreal to be sitting here with maybe Captain America from another reality. And yes I do wanna pepper you with questions, so many questions about where you’re from and the others there, but you got socked in the head pretty hard earlier and I don’t wanna break you. Just in case.” She wiggled her brows at him. “Once you past my test however all bets are off! You can ask me stuff too…unless you think you know me already.”
“Fail.”
again but she’d been the one to blurt it out in the first place, which meant she sort of owed it to him to talk about. “To be honest Steve I would be hard pressed to believe there is a T. Stark out there without self worth issues. It is what it is. But those issues are what pushed me to—they are what pushed me. When someone told me I couldn’t do something or when they acted like a woman couldn’t run a company, I made sure they ate their words in the end.”
being Tony Stark somehow makes perfect sense? When I know for a
Walking over to the glass fencing that was mostly decorative; Steve looked all around before changing his mind and going over to the steps. He hefted the shield into his hands and then threw it in a clean soundless rapid arc. It bounced with a ping off the gold plating of the side of the building before hitting the suit disengagement platform to sail right back into Steve’s awaiting hand. And he caught it like it was a giant Frisbee, not a weapon made out of a nearly indestructible element.
