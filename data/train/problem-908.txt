“I’m obedient to you. Status doesn’t matter to me. I’ll do anything you ask of me.” Sherlock rasped, his voice hoarse.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“There is no usual in this case.” John bitterly acknowledged. “You flirted with Sherlock Holmes? …
, look at you lovebirds. John is such a dear, Sherlock!” Mrs. Hudson cooed stepping near John and pinching at his cheek.
Now though, John saw the dining room, decorated, and heard the softly playing love ballad.
"How did you treat your omegas? Did you cherish them in bed?"
“I don’t mind.” Sherlock spoke softly, breaking eye contact to stare at his hand instead and John wondered if Sherlock felt as nervous as he did.
John's face pinched in a grimace and after a handful of frantic jerking of his cock, he shot out his release to the floor. Those who didn't know John as Sherlock did would assume it was from his orgasm rippling through his body, but not his omega. No, John grimace with the mention of what this was, a video that would be viewed by the world.
"Lies."
"Tell your men to release me.... I want to leave." Sherlock gave a heavy breath of defeat, his anger having dissipated and all he felt now was exhausted.
"Firstly Sherlock, don't call me and make me worry like that. Secondly, it's your mother. Tell her no."
…” John whispered, a lightness filling his chest. “That’s… Okay.”
” (My betrothed.) Sherlock reassured himself and ignored that Mycroft wasn’t watching the game anymore, but keeping a close eye on Sherlock, worried he’d try and claim the eighteen year old omega on the field, in front of everyone.
“Don’t look at me like that. I don’t want to be here either.” Mycroft grumbled shifting uncomfortably in his chair and Sherlock smirked, knowingly. The gentleman’s alpha senses were put off at the scent of his brother’s recent sexual activities.
It had been over a week since the night Sherlock posted their video. It only took a week before word reached them. First, it had been the looks. Occasionally they were spotted and given smiles from people who recognized them from their work. These looks were different - they weren't of the excitement at having gotten a glimpse of
"Mm." John hummed, leaning in and nudging Sherlock's nose with his own. "I like it, though this dirty talk of yours should really stop, or else I might be rougher than you want."
, and John’s omega withered away at that very thought.
Sherlock accepted John’s scenting. Sherlock shared his room with him. Sherlock never flirted back with Irene. Sherlock stayed, even if Irene was alive, Sherlock chose John. Sherlock never rejected John’s help on cases when John had gone. These meant things, though not as grand as a sentimental confession, Sherlock was demonstrating he cared.
“If you want I could—”
“I’ll get a candle for the table. It’s more romantic.”
John laughed, cupping the omega's pouting face, finding the way those lips puckered the most adorable of sights.
Sherlock scoffed angrily, the chair under him screeched back as he rose to his feet, and he slammed his palms against the dining room table and glared at each member of his family.
if that was the case. If it was... Gregory could accept that. He'd have to, because his inner wolf couldn't live without him. Even if all he could take were a few kisses and nuzzles, he'd make it work.
.” Sherlock snarled and John made a noise of protest when the omega pushed harshly against him and the two were separated.
“Good. Now, tell me the truth John. What is
“Don’t make me into the bitchy omega stereotype, John. Don’t make me into the bad guy here.”
They began walking back to the estate in silence, and John tucked his head in Sherlock’s scarf still wrapped around his neck and inhaled deeply. Sherlock didn’t seem to notice it, most likely viewing his action as a way to keep his face warm from the night’s cold breeze.
“Sherlock, because of me you’ve… you’ve mutilated yourself.” John sobbed harshly and suddenly arms were wrapped around him and Sherlock’s nose was pressing against his hairline. Alpha pheromones filled John’s senses and his shivering stopped, but the tears did not.
John understood it then. Many alphas and omegas were forced into their unions and most of those alphas didn’t love those omegas enough to be committed to them. They took care of their omegas, gave them all they desired, but their hearts were of their own possession, never shared. Sherlock wanted others to think much of the same about them, because if it were thought they truly cared for each other, it left them in danger of being harmed.
"I should have told him before we went to the press. I wasn't thinking. I shouldn't have let him find out like that."
"Push, Sherlock." John encouraged, wrapping an arm around the back of his neck, cradling his face, pressing his cool forehead against Sherlock's temple, while he laying a hand over his pounding chest.
“I said go.”
“Not only because of that.” John whispered seriously.
“Yes, septuplets. They look healthy. See these things over here?” Dr. Levy pointed to four small forms sticking out from one fetus.
It was early morning, when John woke. His mind was fogged in a confused mess when arms wound themselves around him.
..." Sherlock whispered thickly, overwhelmed by John's confession. "John?"
“Coming?” Sherlock asked, shrugging his shirt off his shoulders, spinning and making his way to their room, and John knew if he followed it would lead him to a completely nude Sherlock.
Groaning happily into the kiss, Sherlock released his hold of the sheets and cupped John's head, drawing him closer, deeper still. One of John's hands stroked his stomach with love, his other remained where it was, supporting and balancing himself over Sherlock.
John said he would try — try to make this arrangement bearable, so that when he went into heat it would be less traumatic, but this...
There was a bitterness to the staleness of his heat, a musk that didn't match the softness of his own musk. No, this musk he recognized well.
“Yeah, listen... I’m not actually that angry, okay?” John attempted to reign in Mrs. Hudson as she lost herself to her frustrations.
“I’m unhappy.”
"Take it. God, take it, Sherlock. It's always been yours." John breathlessly spoke; watching as Sherlock slowly sat himself down on his cock, taking him inch by wonderful inch.
." Sherlock's hands slid up as his head lowered further, and nails dug into his scalp as he fisted his hair.
“This is a matter of national importance. Grow up!” Mycroft chastised.
John bit the inside of his cheek, stepping closer to stare at the exposed flesh, a hand instinctively raising up and allowing the pads of his fingers to brush over silky flesh. John’s fingers jerked back when Sherlock’s cold eyes snapped in his direction.
John buried his face in his pillow, smothering the sound of a pitiful whimper. How could this marriage work if Sherlock refused to love him? But then again Sherlock never made promises to love him. John had to remind himself that their marriage wasn’t of their making. Sherlock married him because of a contract he’d made with his family. John married Sherlock for the insurance of a contract he’d made for his own reasons. This marriage was never going to be what John wanted it to be, and the sooner he accepted this, the easier things would be.
“And that’s a bad thing?” John snorted.
Harry sat beside him silently watching him with concern.
Sherlock couldn't accept what he was seeing. His alpha stood before him embracing his beta, nuzzling against her neck, pulling back her honey brown hair and whispering sweet nothings to her. Is this what he was to be expected to endure? In
"Harry," John said with affection, voice trembling.
"You look good." John groaned at the sight of his sweaty debauched omega.
Maybe he was mad. Heartache was a terrible sickness. He'd fallen, given to sentiment and it had destroyed the very man he'd been.
“Can we have sex now?” The question was asked lightly but with insistency.
Inhaling a breath of courage, John crawled himself up and over Sherlock, straddling the omega's lap, John cradled the man's face in his hands and turned his head to meet him.
Sherlock would have enjoyed spending another few hours in his alpha's arms, nose shoved against his scent gland and smelling his mate, but his mobile rang insistently. Sherlock begrudgingly answered it and then was asked for his assistance on a case by Lestrade.
John had his suspicions; something about the way Sherlock looked at him and didn’t look at him all at the same time, how his posture was far too casual, and his lips slightly tense, it all filled John with doubt. Did Sherlock… had he saved Irene’s life and then faked her death?
John knew Mrs. Hudson would and willingly allowed her to lead him to the table and, not wishing to upset her more, John decided for Mrs. Hudson he could eat some. He ate half his bowl and it seemed enough to please Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock’s features softened, almost pained by the omega’s words and he suddenly found himself cradled in Sherlock’s long arms.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.” Sherlock hummed adoringly, kisses raining down on John’s face.
look mean?
"Sherlock."
“Well then, have a lovely meal, and hoping to hear from you soon,
"Wouldn't hurt if they had that adorable dimple." Sherlock mumbled and John broke out into surprised laughter.
There, Mycroft had turned his cold eyes to regard him with a look of complete dissatisfaction.
There was no answer. The flat was deadly still. Glancing around the flat, Sherlock found that John was nowhere in sight, but then he noticed a letter propped up against the back of John’s reserved red chair, with his name scribbled in John’s handwriting.
The guests turned around and the band played the song in a loop and John took slow steps forward, following his mother’s lead. Slowly they strolled down the aisle. John couldn’t meet the stare of his intended; he stared to the rose petals beneath his feet and clutched his mother’s hand in a death grip.
“You said he was going to try John, so maybe it’s time you confront him and find out how he truly feels.”
Mycroft shut his eyes and took a deep breath, because he was a gentleman. He was not someone who gave in to emotions and tantrums. An alpha like Lestrade wasn’t worth it.
did. They’re not strictly speaking
John laughed, "I know. It's bloody gorgeous."
Glancing through the double doors, over the omega's head, John finally started to take in his surroundings. He'd been so distracted by the sight of gray smoke he hadn't been looking for anything other than Sherlock, then he'd noticed the burning food. All he could think about was getting Sherlock away from the smoke and cleaning up the mess.
“John.”
John shut his eyes, satisfied, when Sherlock’s hand roamed over his exposed belly and lips pressed against his head of hair.
"You think you can laugh at me, huh? I'll show you!"
Lestrade laughed genuinely and John laughed along with him.
“I can’t deny it. I was… for a time. I was so blissfully, ignorantly happy. I felt so strongly for you, but that was then, this is now, and I hate you.” John lied. Anger fueling his words, but his heart clenched sorely from the paining lie and the look of utter misery in Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock leaned forward, overwhelmed, having the sudden urge to retch.
When John and Sherlock left and entered the cab, intending to go back home so Sherlock could focus all his thoughts on solving the mystery of this double homicide, something caught his eye.
"I thought you wanted me?"
"I don't pity you. I love you!" Why couldn't Sherlock see that? Yes, he knew he'd done wrong. Failed Sherlock in the worst way possible, but he was trying to make things right. John hesitantly took a step closer to the distraught omega and Sherlock snapped, defensively throwing the empty tea kettle at the alpha.
John muttered something about going to get some groceries and quickly left the flat.
The sharp intake of breath from the alpha did not go unnoticed by Sherlock. Good. Sherlock needed John to react. He needed to treat the alpha after his punishment - that was what BDSM was after all. Then he could punish John once more with the distribution of this video.
“He’s afraid.” Sherlock responded, leaning close to his brother and turning away from his husband.
Sherlock glared at the vultures surrounding him. Wanting to be anywhere else but here. His mother was a crafty, evil woman, far beyond his ability to beat, and so Sherlock had lost and found himself
“Take it easy.” John attempted to soothe his hurts and Sherlock’s panic.
"I had it made. It's unisex, so it will work for whatever we have." John tried not to give in to the tears that threatened to be released. "Guess this is where I should say, surprise. Surprise, Sherlock. "
“It’s fine.” Sherlock answered and weakly smiled up at John.
Sherlock shut his eyes, one hand clawing at his shirt, straining the fabric as he clenched a tight fist around the cloth placed over his chest and his aching heart. Something was physically wrong with him. His left arm wasn't numb, so it couldn't be a heart attack, yet this... If this agonizing sharp pain wasn't a heart attack, Sherlock didn't know what it could be.
For many years John lived happily with his parents and his sister Harry, but then his parents died in a tragic car accident. John was sixteen and his sister was fifteen. Their parents death struck deep and they felt the loss of them more when their mother’s estranged older sister, Mona took them in.
Sherlock didn’t respond to the D.I., instead, Sherlock stepped in John’s direction, seeming adamant about saying something, and though his mouth parted in the starting of speech, nothing came out.
Sherlock never touched John’s cock, no matter how much John whimpered and begged, wanting John to come hands free—John did. Heat already doing a number on him, and having gone so long with suppressants made John’s body so much more sensitive. John came, knot flaring, stretching and burning the brim of his hole as Sherlock’s hips did this wonderful swiveling and a millisecond later Sherlock filled him with hot come.
Harry scenting the anger growing in John and in turn Sherlock broke the tension with a question of his own. “Will you take the case?”
“You…” John pressed a hand over his mouth, holding whatever words might have been released, because a sudden clenching of his heart had him nearing tears. Their marriage was in ruins. They were arguing. Sherlock was angry with him. Still, none of it could stop the joy steadily building at the realization that was making itself known.
Shutting his eyes, John inhaled heavily of the scent within the room, of an unbound alpha… Strong and pungent with a hint of sweetness: musk, cinnamon, lemon and mint. John scented himself, an unbound beta, vanilla, hazelnut and musk. They mixed so well, so perfectly, impossibly so. A beta’s scent should never compliment an alpha’s, it wasn’t normal, unheard of. Alphas were to bond with omegas, that was the way of the world. Betas were the lovers of alphas, but never the bond mates. Never.
“Kiss me.” John whispered, overcome by the feeling of Sherlock’s hips dragging as he entered him further.
“I know and it makes it all the harder to tell him. My… feelings… they could never measure up to the way he’s felt about me.”
"Fuck off!" Sherlock cursed, raising up a fist and flipping the alpha off.
Sherlock searched the room they were in and then pointed towards a man and a woman who sat opposite of each other at a table within the restaurant.
Forking a piece of the cake, John offered his piece up to Sherlock’s pursed lips and waited for the omega to accept his offer. Sherlock stared at John stubbornly and John knew the likelihood of Sherlock refusing him was high and so he began to mentally prepare himself.
“Fuck, John. I’m going to mount you so well!” Sherlock groaned his promise, head pressing heavily against his pillow, words muffled by the towel shoved deep against his nose and mouth.
"Will you take responsibility if I can no longer walk because I weigh a ton? What will daddy say? Hmm? I'm blaming you. I did just fine eating every three days."
“Sherlock.” John called when Sherlock was halfway out the door.
“Did I do something wrong?”
John's gaze hardened. Sherlock's words held bitterness, and a bite that always stung.
“I said I didn’t have to know you to know about your military background and your sister’s drinking habits.”
John wanted to be selfish. He wanted to ask Sherlock to choose him and not marry that omega. To stay with him and continue being exclusively his, but he knew he couldn’t. There had been so many stories in tabloids of celebrity alphas having a scandal in relation with a jilted beta lover. A beta who became a home wrecker, demanding the alpha choose them and so often were those betas rejected by their alpha. Omegas were the intended bond mate to alphas. Betas were the scraps. Betas mated with betas.
John knew, but he’d denied it because…
“You need the help I can offer, if not for the money, than think of your sister.”
John stood silently watching as Sherlock accepted it, slipped it on, and paused when the slender alpha took hold of his hand again. Sherlock didn’t look at him, but even in the darkness of night, with the light of the full moon, John could see the flush blossoming on the silent man’s pale face.
The drive was long and quiet. John focused his gaze on Sherlock at his side fiddling with his phone. Sherlock didn’t seem to notice for a rather long time.
John forced Sherlock higher up on the bed, thighs rubbing against each other, hands scrambling to hold onto something, keep him solidified as they inched further up the bed, until Sherlock's head struck the solidness of the headboard. John draped himself over Sherlock, heavy and consuming, his body wrapping around Sherlock much like a protective cocoon. A warm hand palmed Sherlock's head, gripping to damp locks all while it protected Sherlock from the brunt of John's thrusts.
“I agree.” Sherlock hastily cut John off, “
John grabbed the bottle of lubricant, placing it between their bodies as John laid himself at Sherlock’s side. John rested his head on a pillow and stared smugly at Sherlock. He did that to,
“That… I’m sorry, but that is not negotiable.”
“John. I did what had to be done. It was the only feasible choice.”
John winced when claws dug into his scalp, but he refused to answer. If he did, it would only hurt his omega. He wasn't sure on the exact number, but he could round as the omega had asked of him before, but he wouldn't. Sherlock could beat him bloody and John would never tell Sherlock.
John wasn't taking those few inches separating them, because he wasn't going to steal Sherlock's right. It was Sherlock's decision on whether they take that step. He wasn't going to move this relationship any further than Sherlock was ready for.
Eight months. Gregory Lestrade had been dating Mycroft Holmes for eight months and still, they still hadn't gotten physically closer than a kiss on the cheek or a quick nuzzle of the scent gland after a date. Each kiss on the cheek and scenting was enacted by Gregory. It would appear that Mycroft wasn't in a hurry to strengthen their commitment. That or he simply didn't have a sex drive.
The alpha before him released a heavy sigh and palmed his eyes, using his slender fingers to rub at them as they clenched tightly together.
When John grabbed his hand and pressed it against the omega’s flat belly and begged to be filled with Sherlock’s pups, something deep and primal was released. The very thought of John wanting to carry his pups, raise a family together…
Sherlock glanced away from the intensity of John's gaze and after an awkward moment, all on Sherlock's part, he rose from the bench and looked in the direction they'd come.
Sleeping in separate rooms was God-awful. In the end Sherlock wandered out of his room, up the stairs leading to John’s. Knocking softly and receiving no answer Sherlock would enter and the omega would already be fast asleep.
“Do you ever wonder what it’d be like if you didn’t have to bond with me?” John found himself asking.
After preparing for bed, John slipped under the covers of the bed and laid himself in the middle. He listened as Sherlock entered the room later on that night and went to shower. When Sherlock exited the bathroom, he set his dirty clothes in the hamper within the closet before slipping under the sheets to join him.
“John is two months pregnant.” Sherlock started to insist, but the look the doctor gave him told Sherlock all he needed to know.
When John made his way to Sherlock moments later, holding a vibrant purple gift bag with pink tissue paper sticking out of the opening of it, Sherlock had yet to notice him.
. John eyes clamped shut as he exhaled a trembling breath and nodded his head in acceptance.
When John sat beside him, Sherlock made it a point to keep his distance. John feared him. It would be best this way.
“Among other things.” Sherlock insulted.
Still, Sherlock had hurt him and John, even knowing how manipulative and spiteful it would be, wanted to hurt Sherlock right back, so he answered, "Yeah. I know." Turning to point at Sherlock, features tense in his glare.
“Don’t cry Johnny boy, I know you’re lonely. Just promise me you will register and find an omega that loves you.”
“I made you cry.”
“Oh, Sherlock. I’ve been so stupid. I shouldn’t have… I’m sorry. I know. I know now.”
After such a long day at work, John had come home and made them a large dinner. Sherlock had been in the mood for lasagna. Not just any lasagna, but John's vegetarian lasagna he'd learned from his mother as a boy. John couldn't say no to Sherlock, not for anything and even though it meant he'd have to stop by the market to fetch a few ingredients to make it, he would, and did.
“Sherlock’s found me.”
.” John gasped, not knowing what to do. He felt as if he were losing himself in Sherlock’s eyes…so stunningly blue, like the crashing waves of an ocean, reflecting light and beauty.
Now more than ever, John wished he'd done things differently. So many things he'd done wrong. So many times he'd attacked his mate. His tender, loving mate who opened his heart willingly to him. Allowing the omega to do with it as he willed, and so many of those times John had crushed it.
Sherlock and John sat in a love seat just as Harry sat across from them in the twin of their couch and Clare entered with a tray of tea, water, and cookies. John remained seated as Sherlock introduced himself to Clare, flashing her his grin that had done John's heart in.
“Now, where is it?”
. Nothing worked. Nothing would ever work until John was ready to accept him and so Sherlock came to the pained realization that there was nothing left for him to do.
"Mary's back in London and I... I will be going to see her this afternoon."
"I was thinking. Are you sure your omega will be okay with this? Us scenting."
“In which you enumerate two hundred and forty different types of tobacco, which is why nobody’s reading your web site. Right then… Dyed blonde hair, no obvious cause of death except for these speckles. Whatever they are.” John made a sharp comeback.
“Hold onto the reins… Not too tightly, but don’t let it go at any point.” Sherlock warned, voice changing, and no longer was it light and playful. It was stern and filled with concern, almost as if he worried for John’s safety. John knew riding a horse could always turn dangerous, so he willingly followed Sherlock’s directions.
"She touched your arm, flirted with you, and you flirted back." Sherlock frothed, rabid, canines flashing in the light of the room.
“Heal me.” John whispered frailly, giving in. John’s anger dissipated in the sight of Sherlock’s unflagging love.
Now that he’d asked, John wouldn’t back down. He pushed on, through the awkwardness.
“Do you know how hard it is for me to say sorry? I don’t say it often.”
“You couldn’t breathe?” John asked incredulously.
"We-"
Sherlock couldn’t stop his laughter from bursting free once more and chased after John.
"I like that... Your smile. It's... nice." Sherlock's eyes met John's then lowered to stare at the hand stroking his belly, and slid his hand down John's arm to layer itself over his stomach and they stroked it together.
“I’m sorry?” Sherlock was at a loss as to what Irene was implying.
“Not now, John. I can’t lose focus.”
The tension in Sherlock’s jaw loosened, astonishment stuttering the progression of thought, sending his mind in a daze, because never… not once had anyone ever referred to him as pretty. If he’d been born an alpha or beta, he could have been considered attractive, but he had not. As it were, no one had ever shown an interest in his looks because he was so repulsive looking for an omega and yet… John found him pretty. If John thought him pretty, than one could deduce that John liked how tall he was, that he was slim of frame, and had narrow boney hips.
Lestrade remained voiceless, struggling to take in everything Mycroft had said. Of course he was stunned and a bit put off with the idea of Mycroft spying on him, but as Mycroft had said, he should have already anticipated such from a man like this one. Gregory’s stomach roiled sickeningly at the realization as to what Mycroft had witnessed.
“John.” Sherlock begged warily.
Biting his bottom lip, John shivered against Sherlock’s touch, and inhaled sharply, scenting the strength of two arousals within the room.
John didn’t understand when or why, but he enjoyed the alpha’s scent; it was comforting and filled him with tranquility. John’s fingers twitched in Sherlock’s hold when a thumb caressed his knuckles, but even so, he remained quiet.
Mycroft couldn’t trust the words of a man who could so easily give to the pleasures of the body. Gregory wasn’t worth it. No one was worth feeling for. Sentiment was a weakness. Mycroft needed to keep reminding himself of that.
John’s breath stilled at the sight of those emotionless blue looking back at him.
John let out a relieved sigh once he was within his own room. He never would have thought Sherlock would agree so readily with the ruse they’d have to play out, especially with the fact they’d have to reaffirm their vows with another wedding, but Sherlock had. John would forever be grateful that Sherlock would do so much for him.
The ringing of his cell went off and John's blurred sight could hardly look for it. He was immobilized and struggled to catch his breath.
"I'm lonely. Maybe I should find someone to fill this loneliness and have you watch. I could find another alpha and let them knot me - I won't be able to bear his children, but that would hurt you. Wouldn't it?"
John continued to examine his wedding, having held no say in the preparation. Sure he was to marry a stranger, but at least he’d take the time to appreciate his own wedding. The white lawn chairs held pale blue lavishing bows at their backs. It was a cool autumn night and the white and blue string lights that hung over the white pillars at the ends of the rows of chairs, gave the wedding party a soft and warm glow. There was a full moon out, no doubt chosen for auspicious blessing from the moon goddess. John scoffed at the idea of any blessings for this sham of a wedding. Why even have a wedding? Weddings were sentimental, loving events. This was anything, but that.
If he asked, it would make it seem as if he were flippant and he really wasn’t; just thinking practically was all.
“And there is a whole childhood in a nutshell.” Sherlock grumbled, the agitation still having not left Sherlock completely.
John glared up at Sherlock, their witnesses whispering behind them. John glanced over to Sherlock’s family. Mrs. Holmes was currently rubbing her throbbing left temple with her fingers, Mr. Holmes was staring at Sherlock with such disappointment, and Mycroft, the twit, was smugly grinning from ear to ear.
“Yes, dear you will see him, but not for a long while. After you reach your second heat cycle you will meet him on your wedding day.” Mrs. Watson clarified slowly and with care.
“Thank you for this.” Sherlock gestured to his plate.
"Mary and I have always been close friends. We spent many summer vacations together as children and kept in touch after I joined the army. She understood the reason why we married. I thought we could still retain our friendship over the short time we were married to please my mother."
Sherlock tilted his head slightly in contemplation.
John inhaled sharply at the threat. Not because he'd ever cheat, but with the way Sherlock's mind was now, he might just misconstrue truth, have a delusion of his supposed infidelity, and might actually attempt to de-man him.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John rose from his chair, setting the book he was reading down on the armrest and went to answer it. Swinging the door open, the last person John expected to see was Mrs. Holmes standing outside of his door, cheerless eyes staring up at him.
“…In fact four top international assassins relocated within spitting distance of 221B. Anything you care to share with me?”
“Sherlock!” Mrs. Hudson admonished, but Sherlock paid her no mind as he seated himself in a chair, leaned back, shut his eyes and pressed his clasped fingers under his chin.
"John," Mary began, her eyes already taken to silently pleading.
Moriarty snapped his fingers once more and the snipers’ laser dots disappeared.
“John…” Sherlock voiced, stern.
, he went, pushing the air out of Sherlock's lungs, causing his muscles to tremble with the pulses of desire and bliss that filled him in all the right ways he needed to be filled.
"Is my soldier shy about the world knowing just how naughty you are?" Sherlock spanked John harder across his rear, his palm stinging glaringly and knew it had to smart as the alpha hitched a pained gasp.
“Please… I need it.” The omega beseeched of his alpha, bucking his hips up and connecting their hard lengths together.
“Last night… Last night you said…” Sherlock seemed to fall over his words by the shock of John’s complete change.
John looked back up and watched as Sherlock loosened his tie, popped open the first four buttons of his shirt and yanked the left collar away to reveal more untouched milky flesh. John’s mouth watered with the treasure open to his taking.
“Go, John. I’m afraid Sherlock has endured all he could today. I will be in touch.” Mycroft’s last statement felt like a sure promise and John held to it with such anticipation and hope, he couldn’t restrain the grateful smile he sent Mycroft.
John watched with fascination as the omega squirmed beneath him, panting harshly past those pale pink lips, un-kissed, untouched. John had yet to gain the courage to kiss Sherlock. This was instinct and nature. Was kissing part of that? If it were, would Sherlock allow him that personal expression? John's free hand lowered and neared the entrance between Sherlock's small sack and his asshole. His entrance was wet, flushed, the hole barely the size of a nickel, so small and he could finally understand why Sherlock attempted to run when baring sight of his alpha cock.
“Do you want to hear me say it?” John rasped shakily, a hint of anger layering the pain in his voice.
John nodded.
. The heated wetness, the spasming muscles, the scent of blood, it was driving him mad with want.
During his shower John had been contemplating their situation and how best to make it through the awkwardness that would undoubtedly follow.
“Oh, John dear, your parents, Mycroft, Mr. Holmes, and I all promised Sherlock that we would give you two sometime alone to work through this tragedy, but I couldn’t stay away anymore. How are you doing?”
“That’s not necessary.” Mycroft edged away from the other alpha and closer to the front door, feeling trapped.
Another voice supplied.
A pitiful mewl filled the silent room, John hunching over, arousal electrified when Sherlock sprung his pelvis off the mattress, driving powerfully up, springing John
John pursed his lips as he hated asking for this, knowing Sherlock would go into a wild rage when he'd discovered what they planned, but knew this was all he could do to heal Sherlock once and for all.
John closed his eyes and inhaled a pained breath of air.
“Freak’s here. Bringing him in.” Sally spoke in her radio.
John’s eyes dampened as he turned his head and buried his face against Sherlock’s neck, scenting the alpha further, and inhaling the calming scent of his mate.
It was
” Sherlock huskily confessed and John wrapped a leg around his narrow waist and another under his arm and the side of his chest, exposing his slick-drenched hole.
Something was seriously wrong and the worst part about it was he couldn’t seem to figure out where to start deducing. He never had to deduce himself, but now, Sherlock knew that in order to understand himself, he’d have to turn his evaluations internally in order to find the truth.
Lestrade remained silent for a moment, contemplating on whether or not he should say.
“How many tries did it take you to learn the maze?”
"I would never."
"Sherlock." Mycroft leaned over the bed until he placed his face in front of Sherlock's and attempted to catch his gaze, Sherlock looked through him, unseeing.
“Again.
Mycroft had John’s full attention again.
Sherlock swallowed audibly and pressed his knees near John’s ankles. The tip of one of his fingers pressed at his opening. John groaned contentedly when Sherlock inserted one long digit within, easily. John shut his eyes and enjoyed the feel of Sherlock’s finger moving slowly in and out. When another finger joined the first, John inhaled a slow breath, will his body to accept it with just as much ease as he’d accepted the first.
"I'm damaged. I'm wrong for you. I love you, but I'm not ready. I'm not ready for this." John swallowed past the painful lump in his throat. "I'm not ready for you."
"I wanted you, John." Sherlock's face tensed with hurt and anger that John couldn't realize just how much he wanted him.
Taking a half step to him, John placed a hesitant, but nevertheless kind kiss to Sherlock’s cheek.
It was in the moment that John opened the flat door that he scented something was wrong. There was a ripeness; vanilla, toasted sugar, and cocoa.
“Then why are you yelling at me?” John demanded, his temper on a short leash, trying to understand Sherlock’s motives.
Retrieving an oven mitten from the side counter, John removed a pan of golden garlic bread and set it on the counter, unaware of Sherlock staring after him with such fervent longing.
“It was nothing.”
John stared back up at Sherlock, and knew he shouldn’t feel such warmth and thrill at seeing Sherlock bumbling around, trying to express just how heartened he was that John cared about his life, but he did. John did care. He cared about Sherlock more than the genius realized.
“Hello. I’ve wanted to meet you for a while now.” John gave in, though traditionally an omega was to introduce themself first.
"Turn around and press your back between my legs." Sherlock ordered, spreading his legs enough so that John could fit between them.
Sherlock stared blankly at the alpha for a moment. Flakes of paper floating away from his fag. Then a snort of hilarity dispelled from the omega, followed by erratic laughter that left John staring on warily.
“Shut up!” Sherlock snarled angrily, noticeably upset with John’s damning judgment.
“Sherlock says you’re single.”
"Oh, don't be like that love."
“I can’t believe you’re my husband.” John hoarsely admired the tall man before him.
“Why would I do that?”
John wanted to ask, but he couldn’t. If he asked, and Sherlock hadn’t, he’d have revealed Irene was truly dead. If he didn’t ask, well then he’d be plagued with unanswered questions, and the realization that if it weren’t true, Sherlock might in fact care more for Irene than he thought. Even Mycroft wasn’t sure about Sherlock’s feelings where Irene Adler was concerned. Sherlock’s heart was something of an unknown, Mycroft and John couldn’t figure it out.
“Go, now, before Lestrade comes back.” John said, releasing Sherlock and watched affectionately as he turned and bounded down the stairs, spirited.
“There are many names for what she does. She prefers dominatrix.”
"To the very best of times, John." Sherlock gave as his parting.
John smiled softly up at Sherlock, wordlessly taking the offered coat, and wrapped it closely over his front, much like a blanket. John had a coat of his own, but appreciated the additional warmth of Sherlock’s, the fact that it smelled of the alpha didn’t even occur to him.
After long moments, Sherlock released his hold on the horse’s rein, and walked calmly at John’s side.
“Sherlock—” John found it hard to breathe, Sherlock was in pain, the world was destroying his husband, Moriarty was destroying his husband, and there was nothing he could do to stop it.
“How's the diet?” Sherlock snarled.
When John entered the flat he hadn’t expected to see Sherlock and Mycroft sitting across from one another.
“Love.” Sherlock hissed.
John’s fingers slid through the softness of Sherlock’s curls, tugging and twirling it within his fingers playfully. A heavy sigh slipped past Sherlock’s lips, followed by a pleasant noise, the alpha enjoying the affections of the omega, scenting him after such a long absence.
Mycroft’s talk had the adverse affect. Sherlock became fixated with Irene Adler and John couldn’t take it anymore. He left the flat and didn’t come back home until it was very late. Sherlock wasn’t at the flat and it worried John. Laying in their bed waiting for Sherlock’s return, John began wondering where Sherlock had gone and if he was still in contact with The Woman.
“Sherlock… You are a kind, wonderful alpha and I—” John’s voice was hoarse as he struggled to voice his confession.
Sherlock was not a romantic. He was far from it, but today was different. Today he wanted to be a romantic, because John Watson was a romantic. He wanted to give John a night he would never forget, full of grand gestures. In return John would feel so thankful that he couldn't help but to pay Sherlock back with sex. Preferably lots and lots of sex, because Sherlock was in serious need of sexy time with John. He was a hormonal mess, he knew this, and he wasn't proud of it. But with this pregnancy came the constant need for sexual gratification. Sherlock had lost count of the times he'd masturbated on John's bed, alone.
Sherlock remained voiceless for several beats, only because he’d spared those moments to press his lips along the bridge of John’s nose in a warm delicate kiss.
John glanced over to the contented Mrs. Holmes in amazement. What exactly was so wonderful about their union? He’d been paid, not in money, but in favor to marry Sherlock. Sherlock had been blackmailed into this marriage. There was nothing of value in their union, certainly nothing enough for Mrs. Holmes to bless.
“Okay?”
"Safe travels." John called.
“That is a good sign. John, regardless that this was an unwanted union, you have bound yourself to this alpha. There is no changing that. Don’t you think it would be less stressful if you at least tried to get to know him?” Ella observed sympathetically.
Muscular legs tensed, trembling as they bent low, sweat beading along smooth thighs.
John hated so many things about Irene Adler, but most of all he hated how she asked him this unbearable question.
After John prepared them cinnamon French toast, eggs and bacon, he set up their plates and began preparing their tea. Sherlock entered the kitchen several moments after, tussling his shaggy mess of curls, wrapped in his red robe and blearily met John’s deep blue.
"Did that hurt, love?" Sherlock pandered to the camera and John knew what that meant.
They had sex every day, four or more times a day. The standing record so far was seven. John’s need pushed his want for more copulation. Even for friends with benefits they had more sex than committed couples did, John was sure of this. Normally they’d copulate three times in a day, but when working on a case the consistency lowered to two or one time in a day. Now though, knowing that John didn’t have much time left with Sherlock, he was taking more than he’d ever allowed himself before.
Sherlock wasn't sure he could survive this pregnancy with a doting husband.
“As you wish.”
“Now pull the reins to the left, gently, but firmly. Axel will move with you.” Sherlock spoke once they were nearing the gardens of the estate.
Sherlock promised to keep John and Mary safe, and he had, for a time. All those who'd wished to harm them, he'd done away with. Mary had her baby girl with no complications. John was full of joy. In fact, he was the happiest Sherlock had seen him since he'd faked his death.
"I know it was you." Sherlock snapped, angry that John was still trying to pretend he wasn't the one who shot the cab driver to save his life. "Why do it? You... Why?"
“I… tried. I told Sherlock he could seek a second, but… but he said he didn’t want one.” John tried to reason with Mrs. Holmes. To let her know that though it pained him, he was trying to accept his purpose in their family and now knowing he was unable to fulfill it, he was acting rightly in supporting his alphas options and right.
Sherlock rose from the hospital bed soon after the doctor left the room. He finally knew that his heart was undoubtedly healthy. Still... He felt weary at the realization of what this pain could be.
A phone call… He’d called… Harry and…
John was grateful for one thing, his alpha knew when to shut up and give him space.
Movement from behind them had John turning and Sherlock on edge as a figure appeared across the pool.
John squinted his eyes shut, feeling the exact moment when pleasure far outweighed the pain and each agonizingly slow thrust after was another jolt igniting his desire, want, and need. A moan laced full of satisfaction ripped out of John, his lips parting to let out broken whines from the back of his throat.
.” John sighed, closing his eyes, enjoying the warmth of Sherlock’s touch. John missed this, the tenderness of Sherlock’s touches. It almost felt like a dream to be feeling such care from Sherlock after so long of an absence.
“How are you feeling dear?” Mrs. Hudson’s kindly asked, rising from a nearby chair and moving to kneel at John’s side.
“Your skin feels so hot, John.” Sherlock noted worryingly, mouthing at the clavicle before him and John hummed in agreement.
John stared at Sherlock’s genitals nervously, not sure where to start. Maybe he was thinking too much. Sex was something that differed from one person to another. John didn’t much like classifying this as sex, though it was, he felt it was more than that. This might not be making love to Sherlock, but this was definitely love making to John. If John’s affections, care, and gentleness were felt by Sherlock, it could prove more pleasurable for the alpha. John hoped his affections were noticeable and well received, but if John didn’t do something soon Sherlock was sure to lose his patience.
"Oh." John whispered, one of the most sincere smiles gracing his lips then.
"What in the world possessed you to do such a thing?"
Damp moss, rosewood, and hazelnut hit Sherlock’s senses first. It was a scent that he had long registered as John. However, another wave of fragrances beleaguered him. Potent, saccharine-like vanilla and the flavorful lightness of sweet bread, assorted nicely with the vitalizing scent of musk, spunk, and sweat. It was a bizarre combination, but one that sent his head rushing, whirling, and libido flaring. Sherlock’s inner alpha squirmed with eagerness.
“Sherlock, dear, did you hear me?”
“You are everything I thought you to be.” Mrs. Holmes countered.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
he isn’t.”
That isn’t why I’m here now. That isn’t what I want.”
John didn't vocalize his awareness of Sherlock seeking him out. Only offered himself in any way he wished of him. That was better because Sherlock couldn't handle addressing this elephant in the room. No. Certainly not.
Sherlock inhaled a deep, almost inaudible breath, before exhaling a soft, “I know.”
They fell into a contented silence, smiling kindly at each other. John's hand moved to grip Sherlock's near him and fondly stroked the pale knuckles of his mate, and felt the hard smoothness of their wedding ring.
"Okay." Sherlock waited.
Currently they stood together, preforming the bonding ceremony to become mated. As if Sherlock would just accept it. He wouldn't, damn what his family wanted. He refused to be claimed. He refused to be mated. Sherlock rather die than degrade himself into becoming this alpha's plaything, because that's what he would become. It didn't matter what the scientific data and charts said. This alpha might be his true mate, but Sherlock refused to be this alpha's second. Seconds couldn't even marry their mates. They could only preform the bonding ceremony.
“Mm.” Sherlock never looked up at John and didn’t seem to notice when the omega exited the flat.
Sherlock was defective. He wasn't right. He was sick in the head. It was the only explanation he could come to as to why he'd changed so drastically. He knew it was time for him to accept John, but not to this extent. But Moriarty had messed with his mind and he needed the comfort John could only provide him.
The moment he’d answered the call his mother was giggling with joy and speaking to someone on her end.
“Deliriously.” Sherlock chuckled, flashing a lopsided grin to Mycroft who shook his head with disbelief.
“Such a beautiful alpha.” John hummed happily, sliding his hands out of Sherlock’s grasp and palming the sides of Sherlock's jaw, staring directly into pale blue eyes.
again, but now I have to listen to your insults too? Thank you, John.
"I want your calls. I want to hear your voice.
"I can't." Sherlock gasped out, face flushed and covered in sweat.
"Shut up." Sherlock swallowed thickly, breath hitching by the confirmation he was attractive to his alpha.
John palmed his damp forehead, surprised by his response. His pants suddenly felt two sizes too small, tightly encasing his erection. This shouldn’t be exciting him. He shouldn’t be this keyed up seeing an omega being dominated by an alpha, and he wasn’t. It was the care, consideration and loving actions of the couple that was really doing a number on him. He felt a pulse of pleasure run through him when the alpha rumbled out a cry of satisfaction and swooped down, claiming his mate’s lips in a fiery kiss.
“That’s true. He was a bad cabbie. Should have seen the route he took us to get here!” Sherlock added in, thrilled when John burst out into a fit of giggles and Sherlock smiled warmly at him.
The alpha halted in his steps, back facing him, John observed the tall man with a quizzical nature.
"You're staring." Mycroft rasped, voice sleep-laced goodness, tone agitated.
“You smell divine.”
These two dogs came, gave his hand a few sniffs. The multi-colored one gave his knuckles one lick, while the honey brown one nudged his hand before seating himself near the edge, and a moment later the multi-colored one did the same.
"He deleted the memories of you, John."
“John.” Sherlock breathed shakily, stepping closer to the alpha, not close enough by John’s measurements, but then again, John shouldn’t want something he would never have.
“Now, brother, really? I would never kill John. I just… sent him far away. Somewhere you’d never be able to find him.”
"Sorry."
“UMQRA.” Sherlock worded, trying to make sense of it.
“Stop that.” John hissed hotly, ducking his head, taking a step back and away from the strange alpha. Trying was the worst thing he could have done. Telling his alpha that he would give their marriage a chance seemed to break any of the barriers that had been set into place after their first night as a wedded couple.
"I don't. Sherlock, I never thought of Victor as more than a friend. I love you. I want you. You, the mother of my pups, I want you."
“You seem angry.” Sherlock grumbled.
“Not in public.” Sherlock murmured softly. “Most think our union is an arrangement, but when you touch me as you do, it exposes too much.”
Mycroft learned this hard lesson the day he’d lost her, Gigi Haddisu. She’d just turned eighteen. She had been beautiful, with dark mocha colored skin, dark brown eyes, and beautiful long black hair. Her parents had moved from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to London when she was five, soon after the arrangement was made between their two families. She was a gentle soul, untarnished by the evils of the world. Kind and loving, so much like an angel.
"I'm sorry." Sherlock whispered, past the stinging of his heart, eyes clenched tight, never having expected their talk to go this badly.
John was taken in every position possible, positions he didn’t even believe were achievable, and towards the third day of heat, John realized Sherlock had searched through his phone for such positions and began actively doing the same. Each time Sherlock came, each time John was knotted, John let out a contented sigh, smiling peacefully, his omega appeased by the vigorous copulations and each loading of sperm speeding through him and overwhelming his womb.
The first seven had been all boys and the last, a girl. The first three boys were omegas. The girl was also an omega. The other four could end up being beta, alpha, or submissive alpha, but that wouldn't be known until the children developed their own scents. Right now they carried Sherlock's and a neutralized scent, something nearing woodsy. But as they grew and matured Sherlock and John would learn what their status was.
"I love you, Sherlock."
“It is.” Lestrade confirmed, nodding his head thoughtfully, “I thought as much.”
“You promised.”
“Stay with me then. Stay. I don’t need intimacy. I just need you and our pups. We don’t ever have to touch again. Just stay by my side.”
sensitive where his size was concerned. He'd give way to anger and violence whenever someone mentioned his size.
John didn't take it as Sherlock protecting him so much as his way of hurting those who he disliked just as much as John.
“Good. That’s good,” Sherlock shakily answered, nodding his head with approval, he needed to have his omega understand he cared. That the planning of the wedding wasn’t just done by their parents, but that he had participated as well.
“You once said we didn’t need Mycroft as our mediator, that if I wanted something, I only need ask you.” John recalled.
“If he gets to know you, he’ll realize there is nothing to fear.”
Gigi was an angel and Mycroft found himself falling in love with her, though he’d never met her. Then a drunk driver stole her and Mycroft was left with nothing. The kindness of Gigi, Mycroft would never be able to experience for himself, and he grew bitter.
"I know I did a terrible injustice against you. I know that. But you must understand something." John's lips brushed against his hairline.
Retrieving his cell from his coat pocket, Mycroft dialed a number and waited for a response.
"Don't look at me like that! You don't have the right!" Sherlock screamed enraged.
John blinked past the pain and disorienting knock to the head to rise and near the large cluster of people circling his mate’s frail form. They wouldn’t let him near, they wouldn’t let him close enough to touch Sherlock, but John kept pushing his way through them, wheezing out an explanation as to why it was terribly important he was allowed through.
John realized that these guests were members of the Holmes family, or at least he assumed so. They were all slender, tall, and pale. They held a regal stance, much like his alpha and in-laws.
He didn't pause to hear John's response as he'd bolted for his room, shutting and locking the door behind him. Pressing his back against the door, Sherlock bit his tongue in an attempt to cuff the needing moan his omega sang out.
"Stop!" Sherlock demanded, slamming his fist against the kitchen table and glaring at his treacherous alpha.
Sherlock swallowed passed the lump in his throat and rasped out a weak, “I’m on my way.”
"Do you want more?"
“How?” John finally asked.
“It was love at first sight?”
"We should talk about what happened. About the fact you're... That you are now.... That we are...." John's eyes lowered to the omega's stomach, lean and narrow in his suit, but would undoubtedly stretch in a few months.
Still, only part of his plan was set, now John would need to see Harry soon. He’d have to convince Harry to keep her recent illness secret from Sherlock—John hated the reasoning for this particular lie, but he’d have to convince Harry that Sherlock didn’t have to know about her past. Their grandfather had been an alcoholic and Harry had been one until a year ago, it was a family humiliation that didn’t need to be discussed with others. Now that Harry was sober and healthy again, there was no reason they should bring about more disturbing and disconcerting conversations of the past.
“I don’t give a fuck.” John snarled with annoyance, attempting to reclaim Sherlock’s lips again.
“Sherlock has arrived.” Mycroft said, a dissatisfied grimace upon his face, and John wondered if Sherlock was being resistant as he’d been the night before.
“Do you want my touch?”
"I wanted to woo you."
When his mother called to remind him of John’s heat and to affirm he would be back in time, Sherlock lied, promising he would, but knowing John wouldn’t want him there kept him away. He’d spent the day before John’s heat laying on his bed within the darkness of his bedroom, sprawled out, breathing in slow shallow breaths, eyes closed and imagining what would happen if he got up from off the bed and headed for Sherrinford.
“Mycroft?”
“Getting me out of that hellish party and for… Well helping me during my heat.”
Mycroft felt slighted and he knew how irrational it was to feel such. Gregory wasn’t his mate. What gave him the right to feel such? Gregory said he was fond of him, he insinuated of wanting something with him, but the DI’s actions were the complete opposite.
“Please.” John pleaded, inhibition leaving the moment arousal overcame all else.
. Sherlock would be damned if he let himself become mentally unstable to that point just because John didn't know how to keep his dick to himself.
John refused to listen to his parents arguments on why it was important he marry his bond mate. Apparently, since he was six and the arrangement had been legally finalized, his intended bond mate’s family had already been installing payments to the Watson’s. John should have noticed how they’d moved from a two bedroom apartment to a three story home in a matter of a month after the agreement was made, but he didn’t. All the fancy furniture, cars, clothes, jewelry, exotic vacations, all of it was because of his intended alpha’s family payments.
“When he was dying, he was always cheerful, he was lovely. Except when he thought no one could see. I saw him once. He looked sad.”
Hateful. It was all hateful and John's fault.
Then Mycroft entered the room.
go into heat when you are on suppressants?"
“You’ll find someone better.” John soothed.
Mrs. Holmes as usually chattered on and on about an array of nonsense whereas the other three Holmes’ quietly ate their breakfast with a bored expression on their faces. John had to stuff a large bite of toast in his mouth to stop himself from laughing at the scene before him.
Carefully, with thought and stealth, Sherlock slipped out of John's loosened arms and off of the bed. He stood at the side of the bed for a moment, just to be sure that in his shuffling he had not woken the alpha. John didn't move. His breathing remained the same, his features never twitched. He was still sleeping.
"John." Sherlock gritted out. Angry and hurt, but needing. He
John shushed Sherlock's insistent pleas, knowing they'd waited enough and removed his hand. Gripping the base of his cock, John lifted his hips just slightly, enough so to guide his cock's head to Sherlock's entrance.
Sherlock said nothing else, but beneath the covers John felt the warmth of Sherlock’s hand take his own and hold fast. John turned his head to stare at Sherlock, his eyes softening, dampening over with emotions.
Raising his head and staring at his reflection in the bathroom mirror, John sucked in his bottom lip and nibbled at it nervously.
Sherlock raised a hand and awkwardly patted the omega’s back, stiffening when the omega keened happily, nuzzling against his scent gland in earnest.
Shutting the front door weakly, John unknowingly left it ajar, and slowly moved to stand across from the coffee table and waited to hear the omega's condemning.
“Drinking fluids?”
Moriarty stole his children from him, destroyed his hopes of raising a family with John, and damned him to take the burden and blame from the one person he loved more than life itself. John was quick to anger and distrust whenever it came to Sherlock. He knew that no matter how he tried to explain his decision this night, John would not understand, and he’d certainly never forgive him for breaking his promise.
“Has he shown aggression or tried to dominate you?”
Harry opened the car door and scooted backwards before grabbing a firm hold of John’s arms and hauled him out. John tried to stand straight, but the fever was at an unhealthy high and he toppled forwards and against Harry.
Something in John flickered with life.
“None of that matters now. That is the past. We can still work through this. You can make it up to me by staying with me and accepting me.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gauging the omega - half expecting the man to turn wild and lash out at him - John slowly moved to seat himself at Sherlock's side.
“It’s really you.”
, John promised himself. One more tour and he’d accept his fate.
“Why?”
"You know it does."
Sherlock raised his own hand to push the offending offering away and glared at the woman. Ignoring her words of protest, he rose from the ground and moved away from the growing crowd. She and a few others urged him to stay and wait for the ambulance that was on the way, but he remained ever determined and left quickly.
let you go with just a warning. Daddy must have his pound of flesh.”
, Mycroft tasted of honey and coffee.
“I'm afraid my brother can be very intransigent.”
"Option six: Dirty talk. I'm so heavy, John. Look at my feet. Look. I can hardly walk more than an hour without my soles aching. Do you know how sore they will be once I finish dancing?"
“Isn't it? No one ever gets to me. And no one ever will.”
“I’ll bond and marry this omega.” John stated clearly, purposefully. “Save my sister’s life and I’ll do anything you ask.”
, the thought of John being so full, round,
Seconds later John grimaced and turned away, hiding the guilt that might betray his words. Missing the sight of Sherlock clenching his fist against his mouth, then wiping his nose, while his face expressed the despair of John's words.
"Feel so good."
and… perfect. John wanted Sherlock in him, yesterday, quite literally.
Sherlock shook his head, “No thanks required. All I did was text Mycroft.”
John bit his bottom lip, sealing the needy moan that wanted so much to be let out. Sherlock’s nose gliding over the expanse of his sensitive skin sent pulses of electrifying pleasure through him, his cock jolting once more, begging for the alpha’s attention.
“You don’t know what it was like being raised an omega. I was bullied for years. They said so many hurtful things and it destroyed me, but it made me realize how one day I’d be here with you. A self-righteous shitty alpha who wants to fix his poor little broken omega, but in the end, you’ll leave me. You’ll find a beta that’s your equal and you’ll leave me.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock glared daggers.
“Oh, John.” Mrs. Watson whined standing and moving towards her emotional son, open arms, needing to comfort him of his pain.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Staring sleepily at the ceiling, John tenderly stroked the pads of his fingers through dark feather-light curls and massaged his omega's scalp.
“Thank you for all this.” Sherlock made a gesture to the meal John had prepared them.
Sherlock’s voice had turned hoarse. John saw the sorrow in Sherlock’s eyes and he wanted nothing more than to comfort him, to rid Sherlock of the pain of unrequited love, because he knew firsthand the damage it could cause on the heart.
"I can't." Sherlock admitted at last, and watched as the openness of John's gaze turned guarded and resigned.
“John.” Sherlock gasped sensitively, apprehensively and John tore his eyes away from staring at those paining blue staring back at him.
"How many others were there before your wife?"
A moment later he felt liquid coursing through the needle that pierced his right arm and exhaled shakily as a woman spoke over the fogging of his mind.
"I want you to taste my cock."
“You could.”
John merely sent him a devilish smile and instead of kissing him, he set about devouring his small cock, taking the small thing effortlessly in his wet hot mouth and set about suckling it. Loving it in the way he wouldn't love his mouth and Sherlock whined, wanting John to continue and yet wishing his alpha would kiss him. Sherlock's imaginations wouldn't even bless him with the blessing of a kiss.
“You do.”
"Yes, great, wonderful. Just get out."
John said nothing; he couldn’t seem to muster up the courage to say anything. Closing the front door behind him, John leaned on it for support and watched as Sherlock bowed his head once more and proceeded to adjust the knobs of the microscope.
"That's not what I asked."
“The noises you make… God, John. Only for me.”
.” John’s call for his alpha was muffled by his oxygen mask, but Sherlock gave John’s hand a firm squeeze, wordlessly affirming he heard him.
John lurched back at Sherlock's declaration, hands falling from Sherlock's face. He stood in absolute shock.
His mind was a tattered mess that had been somewhat repaired with his bonding to the alpha, but it was going to take years - if it were even possible - for Sherlock to be the way he'd been before his omega began shutting down.
“Do it… Doitdoitdoit!” John ranted and let out a piercing cry when with one solid smooth thrust, Sherlock sliced through him.
John's brows raised with surprise. His lips parted yet no words came immediately from them, surprised that Sherlock thought enough of him to ask.
The world was gray and dull.
“Mount me, John. I can’t...” Sherlock would deny it later if John brought it up, but tears fogged his eyes, his face flushing with his growing heat.
“I didn’t say anything…”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mycroft tilted his head and raised and impatient brow for John's clarification of just what that was.
“Okay, but if you change your mind, I have a list of therapists.”
"On your knees!" Sherlock snapped and John didn't hesitate, falling to his knees before the omega.
John reflected, staring back up at the ceiling.
John said nothing. All he could do was stare in agony as his alpha spun and quickly moved towards the jet. He was going God knows where and he wouldn't be coming back. John had lost his last chance to try and make things right.
"This... This will just be sex."
"Sherlock." John sighed against his skin, adding his middle finger and scissoring them. Stretching and contracting against the nervous clenching of Sherlock's channel.
No visitors. Only beta nurses were allowed within his room. They checked on his health, they brought his meals, and they were the ones to sedate him when he grew hysterical in his grief.
"It's you and it's me. This can never be anything but bonding." John's lips dragged further from Sherlock's temple and towards the peak of a cheek bone. Pressing a firm kiss to the jutting bone, John felt the omega shift further back and against the counter.
John stared blankly at Sherlock, before seeming to finally snap out of the shock of it all and shook his head, 'no'.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Not if it's a statement of fact."
Sherlock's grip on the doorknob turned vice-like. How dare Mycroft talk about John as if he didn't know.  It was clear, even to Sherlock, that John was a good man. But that didn't change how Sherlock wasn't.
John scowled, glanced back up the staircase and over to Sherlock. Without another word, John bowed, strengthening his hold around Sherlock’s waist while his other arm curved under his omega’s knees and lifted up, scooping Sherlock in his arms bridal style.
John didn’t want him, was guarded around him. John feared Sherlock and would never trust him. Sherlock was an alpha, physically and mentally stronger, but Sherlock’s heart was something else entirely. Sherlock wished he had a heart tough and unyielding, much like John’s, but he didn’t. His heart was weak, easily affected. It was breaking bit by bit as his omega…his beautiful John rejected him time and time again.
Mycroft had been nervous. Jumping at every sudden touch. Humming shakily when Gregory's kisses moved lower, past his clavicle. When they'd finally been discarded of all clothing and Mycroft was left wet and open for him, he'd taken him slow and firm. Loving him tenderly until they'd both been overwhelmed by their copulation.
it is.”
“I want all our pups to have hair just like yours.” John mused honestly.
"That's good. Now let me sleep. It's not every day I stay in."
as he'd said. Sherlock didn't protest to the idea. He actually enjoyed taking walks every once in a while and since he'd been committed into a mental institution for so long, he hadn't really had the opportunity to take a walk out in the open for a long while.
returned by 11:00PM. Never a minute later than that, yet now… John still had yet to return.
“Don’t worry about me. I just really want to taste you.” Sherlock soothed, sliding back down John’s frame and tucking himself between John's spread legs as John timidly released Sherlock of his hold.
Sherlock was it for John, and even now that had not changed. Omegas couldn't survive the death of their alpha. It was a truth known by most. Still, there were some omegas that chose to ease their pain with a partial bond with a living alpha. These omegas were abnormal and though a partial bond was created with another alpha, the omega could not cure the severed bond of their true mate, and would die regardless of the new alpha's tie with them. Omegas could only bond once and these partial bonds, more often than not, would cause the omega to feel a sense of betrayal towards their true alpha.
“Morning.” John greeted welcomingly and sat himself at the table.
John met Irene’s gaze weakly, the fight in him had faded. What was there to fight for? Even if he tried, even if he succeeded in convincing Sherlock to refuse Irene and remain faithfully his, John was still broken and would never be able to give Sherlock what Irene could.
is your cure. Your omega needs the alpha's care."
John felt ashamed after he jerked himself off; for having such a reaction to something that should have repulsed him, and for the fact that he knew his alpha would most likely scent his spunk in the shower the next time he used it.
"Don't defend him, Mary. Not to me."
Sherlock just stared blankly at him. John sighed deeply, bowed his head and stared at his plate.
"I understand everything now. You didn't want this, did you? You only married Sherlock because you needed to save your sister, but you were trapped into this union and you couldn't get out of it after bonding. You said you like me. You like me, but you can't betray your union with Sherlock because of biology. I'm right, aren't I John? I don't care if we can never be intimate like that John. I love you for you. I... We can still be together."
Still, there were the few alphas that, even truly loving their omega, could not break their previous commitment to their spouse.
Sherlock scoffed.
Sherlock could see the worry in John's gaze and laughed harder.
Sherlock stared on in bewilderment; the only woman he’d been close to that day was Molly. They’d been surveying a victim’s body at the morgue. He’d brushed passed her a few times during their examination of the body, all innocent contact, but her scent wouldn’t have rubbed off enough that he’d be drenched in her scent. Then again, John was an omega, omegas senses were the strongest of all, so of course he’d scented Molly.
An hour into Mrs. Holmes nonsensical prattle, Mr. Holmes intervening when need be, and Mycroft’s disinterested presence, John was close to banging his head against the wall. Then the dull strumming of the doorbell filled the mansion and John’s eyes darted over to Mycroft.
His parents had destroyed him. His parents had matched him to an alpha that had broken his heart. He was to remain in a loveless marriage, birth children, raise a family and be in love with an alpha that would never love him. Sherlock didn’t love him. Sherlock tolerated him. Sherlock would love that beta. Oh, God, Sherlock would mate that beta and his status would forever be questioned. John would be Sherlock’s omega, but that beta would have Sherlock’s love and be the favorite. John would be mated every three months, but that beta would share Sherlock’s bed always and be the one Sherlock truly wanted.
Sherlock’s lips pressing into his head of hair felt warm, and John shut his eyes when they overflowed with tears.
"Some undercover work in Eastern Europe."
Sherlock damned his omega’s wants because they were not his own. Instinct didn’t matter. Sherlock would be damned if he allowed his omega to control him. Never had he let his omega side out and he surely wouldn’t now, not even as his cock grew half hard.
” John wailed through the pillow, voice cracking with distress.
Sherlock paled. His mother found him…his alpha submissive? That didn’t make sense! There wasn’t supposed to be one out there for him! No…
John stared back warily. Had he gone too far? It was unnatural for an alpha to be dominated in such a way, but since Sherlock had literally never once taken the dominate role, he’d thought...
doing here on a drugs bust?”
John didn’t respond. He couldn’t. He was consumed by terror.
John crawled off Sherlock and began rearranging Sherlock into the position he thought best. John ordered Sherlock to scoot back further, until Sherlock’s back pressed up against the pillows resting along the headboard of the bed. Then, John touched Sherlock’s knees and gently parted them, pushing them up so that the heels of Sherlock’s feet pressed against the mattress, John shuffled himself between them and lay on his stomach, his head close to Sherlock’s blazing hot cock.
Sherlock stormed out of the flat with no idea where he was going. All he knew was he didn't want to be there right now. He didn't want to hear John's reasons. How the alpha believed he'd just stand there listening to him talk about his wife and accept it was beyond him.
"Sherlock." John rasped out the name of his true mate. The person he'd been wanting to meet his whole life. Knowing he'd failed him, and he just kept on failing him.
John was sprinting down the hall, past patients and nurses, frantically reading the numbers of the rooms. When his sights landed on 512, John barreled into the room and felt his heart give to clenching painfully.
But there was one doctor that did give John some hope. Beth Swartz had been Sherlock's behavioralist, and she was the one who attentively listened to John's situation with more thoughtfulness. She thought he should approach Sherlock's omega in a more primal way. To appeal to his wolf side, for when an omega was shifted and in their wolf form their omega was more dominant.
John carried so many fears. His fears consumed his mind relentlessly. John worried that when he wasn’t with Sherlock, was he with that beta? Did Sherlock still keep in contact with them? Was this lover a woman or a man? Were they beautiful? Did Sherlock love them? Would Sherlock always love this beta? Would John only ever be second best? Would Sherlock stay with John out of obligation, but secretly see this beta? Would he have told this beta about John? Talked about how cruel John was? How John could never equal the beta?
“Yes.” Sherlock declared and John felt sorry for the woman.
“I do.”
“Please.”
…” John stammered, face twisting in a grimace of pure pleasure.
"J-John." Sherlock's voice broke on itself, pain thickly laced in his tone, his lips brushing against his temple as he turned to the alpha and audibly inhaled his pheromones.
“How could you demean yourself…? Vasectomy and Nodumectomy for an alpha is… Sherlock…
"Come on. Do it." Sherlock growled his challenge, because John should have been fucking him so long ago. He never should have been doing anything
“No.” Sherlock then raised the tape up high for John and he hesitantly moved under it.
"Breed." Sherlock moaned, turning and dipping his nose against the alpha's temple, scenting musk, and thrilling with the knowledge he would be packed full of his John's seed.
“Okay, we’ll go!” Harry exclaimed, grumbling nonsense while assisting John to his feet and out the door.
Biting his bottom lip, teeth digging through, John whimpered helplessly and rode Sherlock with vigor. John bounced up and down harsh and quick, Sherlock grunted with each ruthless slam down and inhaled noisily with each rock up.
“Oh you’ve asked for it!” Sherlock called, scooping up his own and the two began swinging balls of snow at each other.
for some
“Right, I forgot about that.”
“I’m not some depraved sex addict!” John sniped, face burning hot at the very idea he’d… John didn’t jerk off, not like he used to as a child. In fact, excluding the time Mycroft gave him those heat educational videos, he hadn’t touched himself in years. Masturbation was more something he’d done as a youth when his hormones were haywire, but as he matured he’d lacked the motivation to do such.
“I saw him play rugby. I wanted to know his scent, but I’d never met him in person and I couldn’t distinguish his scent from the many that were there, so… when he’d left the field, I swiped the hand towel he’d used to dry himself with. I imprinted on his scent and I went through my first rut. He’d awakened a side of me I didn’t know existed. This fascinating man, I loved him and I couldn’t wait to meet him again.”
Mycroft nods.
John laughed softly, completely surprised at himself. He hadn’t laughed in… a month, not since... Not since
Mrs. Hudson’s features softened into one of pity and John had his answer.
“Oh, Johnny love, it’s so painfully obvious.”
John narrowed his eyes, endeavoring to see through the darkness of the room. Blinking within the dimness, the shadows began to take form, revealing themselves, and John was able to spot the lump of a body lying covered in sheets.
"Sorry."
"Well, now that I've found your lost omega, be sure to keep an eye on him this time. He's rather a handful as I'm sure you're realizing." Mycroft said.
“I… Maybe?” John said the last with a huff of breath giving in a fraction.
"Now, you're going to have to push again." the doctor said and Sherlock whimpered weakly. He didn't know if he could keep this up, but God help him he had to.
John suddenly found himself being interrupted of his rejections to Mary's loaded question, by a well meaning, but ill-timed waiter. John tried to politely send the man away, but he would not leave, and when finally John raised his head to meet the waiters gaze, time stopped.
"No. No. No." Sherlock choked shrilly.
"I'm being punished. Yes? The world is punishing me, I don't know what for."
Mycroft smirked knowing he’d won and snapped his suitcase closed and stood to his feet.
” Sherlock snarled enraged, fangs protruded from his mouth with the desire to tear at flesh. The alpha within rapacious—thirsty for blood. God help Sherlock when he found Mycroft. Mummy would not forgive him, but he wasn’t sure he’d be able to stop himself from murdering his brother.
Entering the Buckingham Palace to see his husband was not what he’d planned on. Nor was finding Sherlock still wrapped in their bed sheet, sitting in a sofa… with no pants. It was all so absurd and John couldn’t contain the laughter bubbling out of him. He stared lovingly at his eccentric husband who giggled along with him.
John immediately found Sarah in her office, told her he had to leave for an emergency before rushing out of the building and heading to Baker Street.
"I was... forced into this marriage." Sherlock broke the silence with a truth known.
Mrs. Holmes giggled along with the rest of the women who heartedly agreed they'd love some cake. Mrs. Holmes clapped her hands and rose from her seat, promising to return with the big reveal.
The flavor of John’s sex drove his omega wild, made his sensitive omega hole spasm wantonly, wanting to be filled and fucked. Sherlock was horny all anew. God, Sherlock couldn't get enough of John. He was going to milk John dry, and then beg for more of John's cock.
Mycroft's brows drew together in confusion.
"I..." Sherlock began, but then his words fell away.
sounded good. His cock dripped an obscene amount of pre-come all as his entrance gave a greedy squelching squirt of slick.
Sherlock let out a soft laugh, but it sounded so artificial that John was left wondering why he even tried clearing the tension.
Sherlock slowly raised his head up to meet his gaze and John felt his heart come to a sudden halt. Sherlock had never looked at him like he did now. Features void of emotion while those piercing gray depths held little recognition or care, as if John meant little to him.
John pursed his lips, not liking to be ordered around. The alpha within being stubborn and recoiling from being ordered as if he were submissive, but his love for his omega made those initial reservations pale in the wake of his omega's pains.
“I’m so glad it was you.” John whispered, palming Sherlock’s blossoming cheek. “You are who I choose, damn the arrangement. I would have chosen you willingly, eagerly. I…”
“If you want.” Sherlock replied simply.
“I’m coming!” Sherlock growled with annoyance, glaring back at the open door and where they knew Lestrade to be.
"No... I understand you fully." With that said, John rose from his chair and quickly left the flat.
“You should have come to me. You should have told me about Mycroft. I… I never wanted you to learn about… I refused to marry her, John. That day Mycroft came to visit two months before you left, I refused the marriage and Mycroft wasn’t pleased. My mother threatened to disinherit me and take away my trust fund, and Mycroft swore to blacklist me so that I would never work as a consultant again—much like they did five years before, so I’d conform again, but I could care less. I had you and that was all I wanted.”
Near noon, Sherlock would find John wherever he’d wandered off to and keep him company for the rest of the day. John tried to ignore the alpha, but it was rather difficult as for some reason Sherlock would do something that irked him in one way or another.
“I know, but can I…?” Sherlock’s words trailed off as one hand dragged from his belly to palm John’s hardness through his sweatpants.
Sherlock lowered his gaze to the table and his hardly-touched meal, this time being the first to end their eye contact. Mary was back. Of course she would be coming back. She'd given them enough time to bond, and she too would need John's presence for her health and for that of their child.
“Why?”
"How about next time I have you on your hands and knees on the floor and wet that hole of yours with my slick, would you like that."
John smiled fondly at Sherlock’s timidity and leaned forward so that he pressed his forehead against Sherlock’s own.
