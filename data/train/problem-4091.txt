“Well, in your world, it is a bronze age structure of mysterious stones that obviously used to be for something. It’s a gate, Dean. They don’t work any more. Whatever power they had is gone. A henge is a structure that exists in all dimensions. When we “go” to heaven or hell or purgatory or whatever, we aren’t going any direction like up or down. It is laid on top or...beside...in a way. I can’t. There aren’t words yet in human languages to describe it. A henge is built in all of them. There are very very few structures that exist in every dimension. Usually all of the scenery in each dimension is wildly changed. Even if they look the same.They are fundamentally made of other materials. But a henge, the exact same material structure is present. And this one. It is specific. Very. Specific.”
They sit like that for a long moment. Enough time for Dean’s heart to finally slow down and his breath to smooth out. The instinct to curl up and feel grateful to be alive finally begins to ebb and Dean dares to open his eyes. There. So close. He can see the faint luminescence still dancing deep within Castiel’s eyes. It’s always there. The grace. Like pinpricks of stars. If you stare long enough you can see their shimmer even when he isn’t pulling from that well of power. Dean watches the retreat of the light, dimming until it is only the smallest blue glitter before he remembers he shouldn’t. Staring like that. It’s a habit of sorts. Chasing the glint of angelic grace. What is Castiel’s excuse though, other than being the biggest weirdo in feathers? Huh? His eyes are just tired. Dry from all this hay. Castiel doesn’t ever break the stare though. And Dean would blame it on being an angel, except he never exchanged long lingering looks from any other angel. Just this one. Only ever this one.
His mate looks totally wrecked. He is biting that perfect bottom lip and one eyebrow is cocked. The sexual heat in his eyes could burn down the house. Goddamn. Castiel looks so fucking good like this. Is he about to come? Dean slides his hands up Cas’ trousers to press his palm against the hard line of his cock. The special scent of his sex is soaking the air. He shudders hard when Dean rubs and strokes him through the heavy fabric.
Castiel ties the cleverly constructed Kimono over the heavy drape of his wings and begins to center himself onto that bright heaven shard that holds his music. There. The rolling heavy stomp. Like a chanting meditation. Its techno in this time and place. It has been so many kinds of music, in different worlds and times. A heartbeat thrum. He was created to sing “holy, holy” around the throne. It was a song. A repeating rolling hum. A reminder for all beings to tune themselves to. A battery to sustain all of heaven for eternity. To listen is to drop into meditation and find the rhythm and heart of life. The tick of bodies existing in time. The metronome of eons passing and energy decaying. For every rising tide there is the falling back. This swishing swing from life to death and back again, the endless cycling beat. Sunlight and shadow and breath that comes and leaves. He had sang this song for ages, millennia. Until even the time for him to stop came. It wasn’t the end of the song. There isn’t really one. But it was the falling breath of confusion and fright. The discordant jangling threat of his song being turned from the face of an absent god into the weapon of angels. So he left. The ragged seams of heaven had made a soldier of all of them. There wasn’t the luxury of millennia to just keep the flow of heaven in beat. Instead, every angel had to find the rhythm themselves and so many songs were stuck on the tip of an angel blade.
Dean steps even closer and shoves his hands into his pockets. He isn’t going to risk the temptation to touch. Dipping his head forward he stops short of his target and waits for Cas to close the distance. It's one thing to tease and play, but he isn't going to force this intimacy. He can easily claim his sensitivity is enough for his decision right here. But his invitation is open and Castiel is tipping his head to bare the warm curve of his throat and moving closer. Dean cannot linger or this little moment is going to get out of hand, but he does take in the beautiful warm wave of that scent. Not heavy and raw with sex. But simple and light and perfect. It's so much better mixed with the smell of skin and coming from the living pulse of heartbeat.
It's all at once too long for a song and too short. How is this even music? It's a story. It doesn't have a single lyric. But there is some way that it is describing him. Better than any words could. How? This music is strange. Its hypnotic and magic. He is suddenly dying of curiosity. Who wrote this? How was it even made? A computer did this? It sounds like a piano in it. And like a kick drum. And some snare. And this weird clapping sound. So yeah. Its computer music. Weird. He knows next to nothing about that stuff. Who is Angel? Does Angel know his soulmate? Is there some connection between them that made this Angel write down his soul? The questions are ridiculous because everyone knows that musicians really aren't responsible for the soul matches that they make. It's just a fluke. But when he listens to it again, there is an itch. A pull. It's a road. It's dragging him and beckoning him forward. It isn't a song for lying still. It’s a road trip and a walk and a bike ride and stepping forward. It’s demanding that he come forward. Move. There is joy and welcome but it is not standing still. He has to chase this. He knows that. Somehow. Damnit. Sam was right. He needs to know more.
“Thanks for the update Cas.” Dean shakes his head and laughs at himself. Daring a quick glance at Castiel yields the gorgeous shine of his full smile. His nose is crinkled at the bridge and his whole face is beaming with laughter.
“You could get busier, you know.” Cas goads the Alpha and laughs when they crash into the wall to make out. “Let’s at least try to make it to the bedroom!”
“Only you would completely on accident manage to build a full blown henge, power it with grace and blood and then anchor it to your own skin, Dean.” Cas replies with disbelief and amazement dripping in his voice.
“Oh.” Cas breathes so quietly that Dean wouldn’t have heard it, except the word was murmured against the curve of his neck. It sounds like a revelation of some sort.
Castiel knows just one secret from Dean. Only one. But it has wedged open this space inside him that feels tender and sore. Another man knowing that one secret really means that man knows more about him than any other man but his brother. Sure, he ain't ever gonna share his gross sex secrets with Sam. But he doesn't worry that if Sam figures it out somehow that he will lose his love.
“That Omega is safe, Dean. We returned him to his family. But you really need to be focusing on yourself. You have a whole mess o’trouble heading your way.” Benny shakes his head ruefully.
Dean squawks with indignation. “Shut up Samantha. What the fuck. Fucking internet. Nobody can just live in peace anymore. Goddamn assholes have to be sharing what should be private. Fucking hell.”
Whatever cleaning stuff they are using is awesome. Smells good. The carpet is standing up fluffy and clean beneath his socks. It's just. Nice. Clean. Like coming home when he was a kid. His mom puttering around the living room with her dustcloth and the smell of lemons. Her skin had a vanilla undertone and just now here at the base of the stairs, he caught that same scent. Happy omega. Vacuum dust and lemon cleaner and vanilla. The scent and feeling of coming home to a bright warm clean place is so poignant. It had been years since he felt that way. The weight of the day melted and a happy boyish grin danced on his lips as he turned to pound up the stairs with renewed energy.
“I don’t know, Dean.” Cas answers and takes a deep breath that sighs against the hunter’s bare back. “Tell me what happened.”
“Fuck.” Cas repeats with slowly dawning horror. “I just- I wasn't-” he attempts to start a few sentences to no avail.
Castiel reaches to link his fingers with Dean's. “I missed you so much Alpha.” he murmurs with a sore sounding throat
“You seriously haven't listened to it again? Not even once. Not since that day? Dean. Seriously? You don't have the name of the song memorized? It's a song that describes something essential to your very soul. And you haven’t even looked it up? What the fuck?”
“I can be very persuasive.” The angel whispers and traces one fingertip over Dean’s jaw, leaving the hot sweet glide of grace behind his touch.
His cock twitches hard and the sheet wicks up the mess of dribbled precum. The bottom sheet is soaking up its own measure of wetness too. His hole is dripping now and his rutting against the tight fist is rubbing his hot slick down into the sheet to soak the mattress beneath. He bites the pillow and gasps and his arm jerks in staccato pulses. The heat of the blankets and sheets has become a furnace that holds him in its heart. So he sweats, his chest and throat flushing deep pink. The scent glands at his throat heated until the rawest version of his sexual invitation is pouring from his skin. Pushing his heels hard into the mattress, he finally tips into orgasm. His whole body jackknifes as his channel clenches down hard.
Cas nods and moves for the couch. He settles on the edge and waits for Dean to join him. “I came here because something happened at the funeral. Dean, Im sorry, I don't want to involve you in all of this mess.”
His legs are as weak as a newborn foal. He plucks the towel from the hanging rack to dry off. His fingertips find a damp edge on the towel. Omega slick. He doesn't take even a moment to consider his next movement. Lifting the wet towel to his scent gland on the side of his throat, he wipes the fluid there. Marking himself. He rubs that delicious scent on the inside of his wrists as well and on the inside of his thighs. He smells taken. Well fucked. And to be fair, he kind of was. Dean Winchester will be lifting his wrist to his face for days. His Omega. Crawling into bed later, he curls around a spare pillow and sleeps better than he has for years
“oh. You like this Alpha? Feeling pressed? You like my weight on you? So fucking perfect. You feel so good beneath me. Let me try something?” Cas waits for Dean to clear the haze and agree before he sits up and scoots down to put his weight on Dean's thighs. “here, push up like you want to get away. Struggle a little bit. Feel it burn your strong body. It's so good. I like feeling you moving beneath me.” Cas sits there a long while, his wide warm hands stroking Dean's flexing stomach and chest as the man bucks and squirms and flushes pink with arousal. After a long moment of struggle, Dean whimpers and stills into just rocking his hips to ease the wicked boner tenting his jeans. Cas smiles and scoots forward, skipping the obvious place Dean wants him to sit and sits squarely on his stomach. He takes his time sinking slowly into the softness of his belly and catches Dean's surprised flutter of hands. The weight is so much heavier here. What Dean could feel pressing his thighs feels about ten times heavier here on his stomach. Cas releases one hand to pinch Dean's nipple softly and it punches a gasp from him. “what about here Alpha? Does it feel good? Im so wet Dean. My pants are probably soaking your shirt right now.” Cas unzips his pants and tugs his underwear down. Freeing his cock from the fabric and fingering the weeping tip. The smell of Omega sex pours from his skin and Dean growls and his eyes are pinned to the vision of those pale perfect hands running like water over the engorged purpling head of his erection. Cas smirks down at Dean with a proud roll of his hips. “See something you like, Dean?”
Dean startles a little in surprise as Angel bends down to ask him his name. Oh fuck. That voice is ridiculous. He had wondered what it would be like to speak to the DJ like this. His face is pressed against that stubbled jaw. He smells fucking amazing. Lavender fields and hay and ozone. He does manage to remember his name and shout it over the music. Barely. But then he sees those blue eyes. Up close. Shining at him.
“Yes, Dean. That! What the fuck man? Gorgeous guy hears soul song for the first time It’s all over the internet. They had it on the fucking news this morning. YOU CRIED! It was right after a video about a three legged puppy that needs adopting. A three legged puppy, Dean.”
The Alpha can feel his racing heartbeat stutter in complete shock. His shoulder screams in protest as he twists to try to look at his friend through the metal grate between seats.
“Yeah Cas, what's the problem?” Dean casts his eyes around the clean bedroom as if the dragon he can slay for Cas is somewhere in the room. Its so cute that Cas has to just silently admire his mate for a second.
Dean does sneaking around for a living. He has slipped past ghosts, and vampires, and demons. He has tiptoed around witches and eluded rugaru. All in a day’s work. Creeping past one unsuspecting angel shouldn’t be trouble at all.
“And stop fidgeting.” Castiel tacks on. Which of course causes Dean’s entire body to suddenly itch and squirm. “Dean.” He chides with a smile in his voice. The hunter can almost see the fond expression he must be wearing. A wash of something very much like joy swells inside his chest as he finally relaxes.
his eyes beg. The angel touches each witness to the seizure and edits their memory. An ambulance isn't going to fix this. Somebody had tried to physically keep an angel's mate from reaching him during the first moments of bonding. Its intense for an angel. Apparently deadly for a human. He helps the shaky man up onto the stage and finds him a metal folding chair that he scoots right up next to the decks. The praying man collapses into the seat with visible relief and leans into Castiel's hip as he straightens to transition to the next song. There is twenty minutes left to his set and this wild pleasure that the praying man dumped over his wings is now pulsing out to the crowd. The entire sweaty mass of humans is now horny as fuck. Goddamnit. A little horny is great. A lot horny and it's gonna descend into a full blown bacchanal. He has to be cool. Calming. He has to back all of them down off this ledge. This mood is a direct aggression to the souls that are asexual out there. His audience didn't consent to an orgy. He centers himself, distances himself from his vessel for a moment and hopes to fuck that the praying man doesn't speak for a while. The relief is obvious as the song changes. The praying man's soul contracts back down into the cage of his chest and he slumps tired and dazed into the chair. Ok. Everything is so much calmer. Ok. Cool and casual.
Thankfully the machine and the scrabble of his flailing panic has alerted Castiel. The angel slams around the corner. Instinctively, Dean reaches for him while scrambling and scratching his useless dress shoes against the hay strewn concrete.
Besides, if he tried to put on a shirt right now, his right arm from elbow to shoulder and the right side of his chest would protest. Mightily. Castiel had tossed him along a strip of concrete that wasn’t the nice smooth kind. More like, industrial farm, cheese grater on the skin concrete. Ow.
Dean stumbles to the hallway only to be immediately ordered to starfish himself against the wall and present his hands for cuffing. There is so much confused shouting and his half awake state hardly allows him to process everything all at once. A familiar face swims up into his vision and he latches onto the welcome sight with relief. “Fucking hell, Benny! What is going on? What the fuck?” Dean rolls his eyes as far as they can toward his bedroom to search for his Omega. He can only catch the smallest glance before too many people swarm between them and the similarly confused and distressed man is herded down the hallway and around the corner. “Don’t touch him!” Dean shouts and attempts to lunge toward the knot of uniforms that are moving much too fast. Everything is moving much to fast. His Alpha leaps within and then he is struggling hard. His throat rips with screams of frustration as the room becomes doused with the gasoline reek of his aggression. It takes four cops and a taser to pin him to the floor and still he is ignoring his dislocated shoulder in favor of threatening to disembowel every cop who touches Castiel. Everything is one scarlet soaked blur until he is dumped into a spectacularly painful adrenaline junked crash. His body is wracked with long shudders as the temperature seems to drop instantly. He is freezing. His muscles convulse and the twitching causes his shoulder to announce way too late that its beyond fucked up. He is lying on his stomach in the back of a police patrol car with his hands cuffed behind his back. The car smells familiar. Benny. Benny had been there. What the fuck? Dean attempts to speak and his voice sounds like crushed glass. He screamed himself hoarse. “Benny, what? What the fuck is going on?”
“They are only partial wings because I imagine actual wings would have to be really big and I wanted the scale. So. It’s just feathers. Not nearly wings. Really.” It seems like now his mind has decided to unfreeze and the unfortunate side effect is now he is talking way too much in exchange for his earlier lack.
"No one told me that prayers came with that extraordinary data. The feeling in my vessel. It was overwhelming." I almost fell off the deck.
The angel takes his silence as discomfort and tries to explain. “Human eyes are. Inefficient.” There is a small beat of silence before he says. “No offence.” Which makes Dean laugh just a little bit. When nothing happens for a second, the hunter wonders if Cas has changed his mind until he speaks again. “You might want to close your eyes.”
Dean turns to lean against the wall and crosses his arms. “Hey Cas, so now that I am warned, what exactly was your plan for getting out of here?”
Now he feels the relief and pleasure of walking into a clean fresh smelling house at the end of his long shift. Perfect. Dean grabs a beer from the fridge and heads for the stairs and the welcome respite of his shower.
Fuck. He had made an amazing wreck of a mess. Castiel carries a secret smile for the rest of the week.
Castiel lowers his blade and feels the anger draining in degrees. His vessel is strangely damp and radiating heat. Sweat. How very.
If it worked or not, it was worth it. It had been good to carry his sincere need for Castiel to be around. It felt like doing something.
Charlie flips open her phone and scrolls into a music app. “We use a streaming service here.” she explains. “Our playlist is shared by all of us and I think that one was Meg’s. She thinks we need to get out of our American music mindset and listen to more world music and expand our horizons. She puts some weird shit in here.”
He has to rush. Thank fuck he left his clothes all the way across the room. Taking a wet soapy washcloth and dry towel to his skin was enough to get the sex smell at least mostly tamed. His clothes are masking the really raw scent at his groin and pulse points. If he looks flushed and sweaty as he makes his way downstairs, well, he had been cleaning a house. Right?
Dean vibrates with anticipation all day long. He is so distracted that he manages to almost break his foot beneath a wobbly jack, he tips over an entire container of paint, and he forgets a packet of screws is on his lap before standing. Nothing can dim his happiness though. Even though half his day is cleaning up his clumsiness.
“Hey, you better come back and let me know what happens. I can’t stand it when I don't get the end of the story! And you are gonna owe me 20 bucks when it’s a guy.”
Castiel twitches with a full body shudder as the sudden prayer licks up his wings. The flapping shiver whacks Gabriel right in the face with one half decorated wing. “Hey!” he protests and bats the feathers from his mouth. “What the fuck?”
“What do you think has changed between then and now? You wouldn't have minded mating me when I was a scared innocent that was being crushed. But now that I am pushing back and standing on my own you don't want me? Is that it?” His bright eyes blaze into Dean's as he edges closer to him.
“I would say it was. If you somehow called me across a room. If you pulled me away from a fight or a meeting. Dean. I think there is more to it. The henge pulled me from non existence. Or influenced some power to pull me. You could have an entire ocean of grace and it couldn’t do that. I think it was all the rest. Powering it and pointing it was the grace. You wrote a prayer in enochian, Dean. You know how enochian sigils work. They draw boundaries. They set limits. They provide structure. They are inherently close to the same words that created this world and all the rest. If you happen to soak an enochian prayer in human blood and flesh and pour intention and will into it and then douse it with grace. Well. apparently it builds a henge and grabs an angel from wherever they might be. Even if that place is beyond life.”
Dean groans at remembering the stupid viral video and sighs in resignation. Sam was right. He wasn't going to let it go and Dean might as well be tilting at windmills. “Fine. Just a second. I have it written down here somewhere.” a shuffling sound of Dean rifling through mail and change to find the square of paper drifts through the receiver while Sam tries to recover his shock.
Dean pushes his shopping cart another foot forward as the line finally makes some progress. A coupon clipping genius had unpacked a freighter worth of nonperishable goods and involved the entire staff of the store to deal with the sheer magnificence of her savings. Which is about par for the course. Dean wonders idly if he is cursed or just the most unlucky fucker on the planet.
Castiel races for the ensuite bathroom. He is desperate to catch the mess before his jeans are soaked. Stripping down, he is relieved to note that only his underwear are casualties so far. Underwear. Fuck. He had brought the panties with him to the bathroom. And now he is naked from the waist down, fully aroused and holding sex soaked panties in his fist. So he does the next natural thing and bends himself over the edge of the enormous soaker tub and presents like the star of some porno. He is huffing and licking the silk like a maniac and shoving his fingers into his horny body with abandon. The angle is terrible and it offers barely any relief. Still he humps his hips wildly and hooks his fingers against his rim to tug his hole open wider. All while imagining licking that Alpha cock covered in silk. He whimpers and imagines the hot line of hard dick straining the little panties and pre-come soaking out to coat his tongue. His entire body shudders with need. His spread hole feels more open than ever. Begging to be filled. He clenches and gapes to the room as he strains to soothe it even a little. Three and then four wet fingers pumping and twisting as he tightens his hole to feel the rubbing pleasure against his walls. It only takes moments before he comes hard and paints the side of the tub with his release. A gushing flow of wetness is ejected from his orgasming channel so forcefully that it spurts from between his fingers in a squirting arc that hits the bathmat and the edge of the hanging towels and pools in the grout of the tile floor. Fuck.
“What? You're serious. Ah shit Cas. I wish I would have known.” Dean flinches to consider all the really perverted things he had been thinking of enjoying with this innocent. “I could have. I dunno. Done something special or something. Gone slow.” He rubs a hand over his face and tries to will his body to slow down.
And after, things just happened too fast. The fragile cracks in his psyche never felt strong enough to explain what he had done. How hurt he had been. What he had needed in those dark days.
“Dean” he croaks, and sniffs and tries to stop himself from shredding the napkins into tiny tiny pieces. “What is the name of that song? I need to know what it is.”
By the time Castiel has returned, Dean has managed to cover himself with a dry and only mostly gross teeshirt from a couple of days ago. He accepts the towels from Castiel’s hands and uses one to mop the puddles from his ignominious post shower shenanigans. Ok.
Welp. Dean is going to be in Europe for the rest of his goddamn life. There is no way that he is ever going to step foot on a plane again. His arms and legs feel like cooked noodles and his head is pounding. He feels like somebody shoved him inside a tin can and shook it for ten hours. Why in fuck did he allow himself to be talked into this nonsense?
Dean just makes a pained annoyed sound at the suggestion and grimaces. Charlie chuckles and nods her head. “Yeah. It’s not my scene either. How are you going to find him?”
Dean stops the runaway worried babble of Castiel's minor freakout with his fingertips over the Omega's lips. “Omega look at me.” he demands softly, the first time he has ever edged his voice with the shining blood stirring weave of Alpha command. “Cas, I want you to hear me clearly. I am fine. The injury is nothing to me. I am telling you now in my true voice because it is important. You know my words are truth as I see it. I could not use them with power if they were a lie. I need you Omega. I can wait for the mating bite. I swear. You are my mate. No legal stuff or even bite marks will make it so. You have been since our first scent bond and you will be no matter what happens next. Please. I don't want you to leave me alone again. I was so unhappy. So hurt. I missed you.”
Castiel's eyes slowly begin to shine with amusement. “Dean, your face is red.” Cas mentions as if he doesn't know.
“Are you ok?” he asks quietly. “It isn’t like you to move when you don’t intend to. Is your vessel well?” The question reveals just how bad it has gotten lately. Angels need a few key things to stay somewhat functional on planet earth. A host of Angels to connect with, a strong link to heaven to top up the reserves, and a solid firm footing on faith. Castiel and Gabriel both are lacking in all three. Gabriel has managed for hundreds of years. He has walked with humans forever, and seems just as powerful as ever. But Castiel can feel the strain. He has asked the archangel over and over how it's possible. Gabriel keeps trying to show him. It's not working. Mimicry and trying to meditate into the right headspace and produce some simulacrum of faith to sustain him. It’s very obvious that copying just isn’t going to work. Maybe it isn’t even possible for a Seraph. They were created to be close to the throne of God. This distance from heaven is draining him more every day. There is only one halfway decent way to bolster his quickly failing tie to this earth. Music.
Dean flips on the TV as they settle into their meal. They have finished eating and are happily sprawled on the couch when an entertainment news story flashes some shaky footage of Castiel lifting a reporter off his feet and slamming him against a car. Dean's eyes are pinned on the screen and he can't possibly look away even though they show it again. And a third time. Holy fuck. The room is drowning in aroused Alpha scent and Castiel is beyond amused.
It turns out that male Omega rights still haven't managed to make it to emancipation. Basically, the autonomy of male Omegas is passed from Alpha to Alpha. Castiel is under guardianship of his Uncle until he is properly mated to another Alpha. Upon finding out that Castiel had not returned to the hospital after his work shift, his uncle had put an alert out for his whereabouts and triggered the search for a kidnapped minor. Turns out that the fat balding asshole that Dean had met in his yard, was Jeremiah Adler-Novak. Legal guardian. Also strangely enough, Jeremiah is running for a state senate seat. Its amazing timing that he got the perfect opportunity to bloviate about his “strong family values” and “protecting our cultural heritage”. He leaves his nephew in an unmated Alphas home on purpose and calls the cops the moment he knows he can. His disgusting smarmy face is making the rounds on all the political streams. He had set Castiel up. Perfectly. Using his nephew as leverage for tallying up how he has acted on his conservative values.
“Why do you think I started this whole fight in the first place? My family wasn't going to let me be with you, Dean. They were actively attacking you. They were going to send you to jail! I need to be free of them so that I can be with who I want to be with! Which is you.” Castiel is practically shouting by now and pokes Dean’s chest for emphasis.
Cleaning day arrives and Dean is absolutely thrilled. He has cleaned his house top to bottom. Which doesn't make much sense, really. But something inside of him wants his home to be absolutely perfect. Comfortable, warm, welcoming. He wants to show his Omega that he is a fucking great provider. It’s Alpha posturing and he wouldn’t hear the end of it from Sam or his friends if they could see him. His nesting impulses have been fighting with the rational part of his brain that keeps insisting that the Omega is here to clean. So he inwardly debates every task. Should he take the curtains down and clean them? Should he leave any dishes in the sink? Would his Omega prefer the couch cushions bunched on the ends or scattered?
"But I don't know how t-" Castiel shouts desperately while clutching for Gabriel's sleeve. But the archangel had already popped away with a rustle of wings.
“I’m Charlie.” she says cheerfully. (As if they had been talking all along and Dean hasn’t just been losing his shit.)
Dean glances around the room and every face is a little flushed and excited too. Its ok. This is why they are all here after all. To enjoy the emotions and feeling of music. Whatever he is feeling is all in his head and nobody here cares if he gets carried away on the music. So he settles and feels better. More comfortable. The beat rolls into the next song. It's so casual and holding none of the intensity of the last song. The music rocks and claps in an almost schoolyard innocence. Dean narrows his eyes.
The teen magazine shouts #teamfreewill in giant pink font. Castiel is posing in a tight white tank top and his big bright eyes invite every teen reader to sigh and join college activist groups in droves. Omega rights never looked so goddamn delicious.
“Mr. Winchester, we strive to keep our clients happy and we have to inform you that Ms. Novak has fallen ill. We are very lucky that our family is in business together and so her son, Castiel, has offered to take on her responsibilities while she recovers. We know that you are scent sensitive (Dean has to keep from whimpering at the mention of his heightened sensory needs. Fuck. Cas is just standing there looking at him!) And so we think that the familial scent similarity will make him a good replacement for your home. We wanted to stop by today so that you can tell us if his scent is acceptable.” (If only this guy knew how goddamn acceptable his scent is. Fuck. How is he going to keep from popping a boner right here in his front yard?)
The absolute joy in that prayer is enough to take Castiel's breath away. It's perfect. An emotion he can share with the room that isn't about getting the pray-
They both are completely clothed. Only the rude jutting pink of Castiel's cock from his pants would suggest that this moment is sexual. But Dean is already falling apart. His mate has pinned him and is in no hurry to relieve himself or Dean.
Dean steps back and hopes his voice doesn’t sound as shaky as his knees feel. “I think it will be just fine.” he nods solemnly as if the decision had not been made the second he saw those blue eyes. The balding man nods in a pleased way and bids him a good day. His ham hands reach for Castiel's arm and he tugs the Omega away like so much luggage. Dean clenches his jaw so tight he feels like his teeth might break. Not once in this entire exchange had Castiel been allowed to speak. It was infuriating.
Castiel has had audiences with beings of unfathomable power. He IS a being of unfathomable power. He is still dreading this conversation. It's all well and good to make a secret little wish list in some angsty million year old teenager fit of despair and drunkenness. It's another to be face to face with the literal man of his dreams and have to explain exactly how all of this happened. Why couldn’t he just be Gabriel for the night? His social skills are most definitely NOT up for this
Dean can’t help but smile just a little bit as he shakes his head at her antics and exits the coffee shop. He feels like it has been days and days since he walked into that room, but the sun is blazing and he is still exhausted.
Dean shucks his jeans and underpants in one motion. Then fishes out his wallet and keys and lockpicks. All his backup weapons and necklace get added to the pile, but he doesn’t bother to take off his nasty shirt. That would involve peeling it over his head and he doesn’t want to get that slime any closer to his face. Dean starts up the shower and wings one thankful thought toward the universe for the good water pressure. Perfect.
The two angels sit in silence for a long moment before Dean stirs in his sleep. Immediately Castiel twists toward the human and with a touch, he nudges him deeper into sleep that was being fought valiantly. Stubborn man. So human. His ves- body was fighting the unnatural sleep. His soul was now folded tight into its shell and still pulsing and pushing out toward his grace. His mate was determined to wake up.
But now, it was all so much bigger. It was about so much more. Dean couldn't contact Cas. It was very important that he follow the legal council and not fuck up Castiel's chances. He hadn't even stood in the same room as his mate since that awful morning.
Castiel almost hadn’t made it to Dean’s house for a second week. His mother wasn’t feeling well. She had been throwing up all morning and her feet and hands were swollen. She brushed aside his concern and said it probably was just overwork because her hands and feet would often swell after standing for hours. Maybe she had eaten something bad. Castiel tried to insist that she stay home and rest, but of course, her stubbornness prevailed. By the time they had made it to Dean’s home, her strength was waning and so Castiel parked her on the couch and got the happy delight of cleaning Dean’s home himself. Well, it was a delight until he had made his way upstairs.
Cas seems completely caught off guard and licks his dry lips before finally speaking. “Thank you for asking Mr. Winchester. I am not sure though. Her kidneys are failing and we don’t know why just yet. She is in the hospital.” His voice is shockingly deep and Dean has to concentrate so hard to keep his intentions fully on the conversation at hand. This beautiful Omega is worried and distressed and he can’t get distracted and ask the man to keep talking and maybe say his first name and moan a little with all that gravel and thunder.
Dean’s room smelled like sad Alpha. There was the scent of books covered in dust, a gasoline can left in the garage to stagnate, cracked leather left out in the sun. Neglected and forgotten. It was heartbreaking. The scent in the rest of the house stayed mostly calm and was the steady warm Alpha that Castiel had quickly grown so fond of. But here in the bedroom, that lonely scent was pressed into the wrinkled and abused linens. Dean had tossed and turned sleeplessly. His bed wasn’t a place of rest. The faintest scent of Omega still laced the air like a phantom, but it couldn’t compete with the heavier scent. Castiel immediately stripped the bed. He was fighting a very fierce inward battle. Surely, this had nothing to do with him. “Not everything is about you, Castiel” he lectured himself. Had he been missed? Was his Alpha feeling the days ticking by as slowly as Castiel was? A whole week had seemed like a year. Knowing that his ridiculous horny accident had somehow enticed the man to welcome him back was enough to make time crawl. He had been so excited to come here. Only now there is this heavy ache in the air. His own chest burns at the longing. What had happened? Was it some other loss? Was Dean going to be ok? Castiel unfurls fresh sheets and tucks them into smooth order.
He feels an instant flood of relief as he rounds the last corner on the block and it is still and quiet. Awesome. He had beat them there. Fuck. He parks in front of the little house and takes a long moment to breathe. This wasn’t how he wanted to see Dean again. How is he going to ever make up for this mess? Finally he screws up his courage and makes his way to the front door, knocking and feeling so awkward. He doesn’t have a key to this house anymore. It feels so strange to be locked out of this place. And there he is. Dean is swinging the door open. So beautiful. He is wearing a grey teeshirt and some well worn jeans. His feet are bare. The scent of libraries and leather reaches out to embrace Cas. Home.
Once inside, Dean can feel a flock of nervous butterflies take flight in his stomach. The milling press of people makes it feel more like the familiar clubs back home. Its sweaty and full, but these people aren’t thrashing and dancing, more like gently swaying hips or heads to the relentless thrum of the warmup DJ spinning techno. This has to be it. He can’t go so far and trust so much for it to come to nothing. Something a little like faith is stirring beneath his skin and something like a prayer is just beneath his breath.
He has selfish moments when he wishes he had mated Castiel. None of this would have happened. He could have taken him for himself and every legal barrier would have vanished. If he could go back though, would he? Would he mark that lovely neck and tell the rest of the world to fuck off? No. Knowing what he knows now, he wouldn’t take that. Castiel isn't just fighting his family. He is fighting for every unmated Omega on the planet. Male or female. Seeing progress in the movement to give him rights will unlock so many doors for millions. Dean couldn’t take that from him.
Castiel has never been to a movie theater. Never been to a mall. He hasn’t ever been to a party or slept away from home. Not once. Being a male Omega in a conservative family means being tucked away and wrapped in protective smothering love until he feels like he might scream. He never attended a school. His mother had patiently homeschooled him. The family owned many businesses and Naomi had chosen the work of cleaning homes so that she could continue to live within the old fashioned confines of Omega propriety. Omegas should do domestic work or caretaking or teaching. Of course. She would sometimes cave in to Castiel begging to come along. That is the depth of his boredom. He dies for the chance to go to work with his mother. Now, he may have blown his chance at even that. When she finds out what he did, welp that will be it.
He is just too tired to note the freshly cleaned carpet or note the sparkling kitchen. His mind feels wrapped in cotton. Making his way to the bedroom, he takes in a long breath of the apple pie and vanilla scented air. Fuck. So good. He is such a lonely desperate fuck that he is even hallucinating that the scent is coming back. Ugh. He is going to shower and crawl into bed immediately. He just can’t keep going. Fuck dinner. It's just too much effort.
What he does not see is his soulmate. Castiel stands trembling and shocked only a few feet away and folded into an adjacent dimension. He doesn't see him because the angel is completely shattered and so shocked that he is frozen and hiding from the sheer force of the prayer. To him! This human was praying. To him! He had never been prayed to before. It felt. Well. Less holy than he had expected. It was so raw. A prayer carried the package of emotion bundled in the words and that sorrowful longing really was fucking with his vessel. He can barely focus on the words because of the wild romp of human emotions playing havoc with his amygdala. His eyes are leaking and his hands are shaking. So fucking distracting. This man is looking for him? How? Why? Castiel edges closer and spots the tickets. Fuck. Well fuck. He is looking for him. He came to the right place. The American English prayer and daytime napping says the man has come a hell of a long way.
They don’t have to plan when to fall back into the discussion of whatever his tattoo means. Somehow they know each other well enough to feel when it is right. There is beer on hand and night has drawn them into a golden circle of lamplight that feels quiet and intimate. It is time for him to talk to Cas about those six months. The ones after he watched his friend walk into the black water. It was time to unpack this grief and let it have some air and light.
“No.” Castiel replies. Calmly. Again, dead silence follows this announcement. He has to be doing this to fuck with Dean. Surely. Nobody can possibly be THAT annoying on accident.
“Fuck. Cas. Oh fuck. If you get. Any more practice. I am a dead man.” He groans and pants softly as he feels his second orgasm looming. “My knot. Fuck. I’m going to cum again.” he warns. Castiel just hums and rubs his stubbled cheek on the inside of Dean’s thigh and reaches his pale fingers to rub and squeeze the swollen knot. “OH shit! Cas!” the panties don’t catch all of his seed and Cas gathers the mess from his hip with his fingers and pops it into his mouth. Dean sort of floats for a little while. When he returns to some sort of coherence he rubs his hand down Cas’ naked back. “Hey babe, the edge of the tub is making my ass go numb. I’m going to cum again. We should probably take this to the bed.” Cas nods and winces as he rises in that graceful flowing way. He makes a hilarious face as he gains his feet.
Dean is frozen to the spot in surprise and can only softly whimper at the suggestive tone in Cas’ voice. The wrecked noise makes Cas laugh softly. His breath fans over Dean's throat and sends a shiver down his spine. “Do you want to see, Dean? I will show you if you want.” Cas leans back to catch his wide eyed gaze. Dean finally manages to nod and Cas reaches to link their fingers. Dragging him into the bathroom, Cas turns and shuts the door firmly.
Somehow, Dean knows that whatever is hiding in all that silence behind the words “I want” is something he would do anything to give to the angel. Anything at all.
Dean hasn't been to a whole lot of concerts. He is so new to the electronic dance scene that he feels the pulse of awe that drifts over the crowd like a slap. Is that normal? Nobody in the crowd seems to be freaking out. Music had made him feel all kinda ways but this. This was something else. The crowd shifts and pulses toward the DJ booth. It must be time. There is a man wearing a long sweeping kimono that has joined the warmup DJ. Dean had been impressed by the casual coolness of the crowd. No costuming or neon. But this DJ is stunning. The kimono hangs open to bare most of his chest and shoulders. It would look ridiculous on anyone else, but that tanned stretch of skin looks inviting. The length of his throat looks longer because it's framed in the deep vee of silk. He has a western haircut which contrasts the asian costume. It is cropped close but not enough to tame the tousled messy thick of it. Then a black shape shifts behind him. How did he not see that first? Wings. They are massive. They look heavy as fuck. Angel. It's a little bit on the nose isn't it? But he can't imagine this DJ looking any other way. The wings suit him just as prettily as that costume. He is obviously one of those guys that look great in absolutely everything. No wonder he has fans. Look at him. His head is keeping time with the music as the first DJ greets him in a half bro-hug. They stand with their faces pressed against each other while the warmup DJ says something in his ear over the loud music. Dean wonders how he smells. If the other man is breathing against his skin. What would it be like to press his face against that bare throat? His stomach twists a little with nerves again. He should be watching the crowd. His soulmate is probably here tonight. And he is fanboying on the DJ. Must be jetlag. He can't seem to focus. They say sleep deprivation can be the same as taking shots of alcohol. The crowd is electric with anticipation as the other DJ steps back and around those great wings.
“Cas, I kept dreaming. Drinking a lot. PTSD is a bitch. I kept seeing those flashes. The light and wings. The few times that I saw any real part of you. I know your vessel is all you. But I missed the part of you that was different from human too. You are an angel, Cas. Wings. I couldn’t get them out of my mind. I wanted you back. I kept studying. I thought somehow I could write a spell. Wanted it to be immutable. Nobody could burn it or throw it away or lose it. Wanted to carry the spell around. I tried writing the words on paper and keeping it in my pocket at all times.” Dean shakes his and peels the label as he talks.
It turns out, an angel of the Lord really can be. Almost as persuasive as a stubborn hunter who mourned and carved his plea into flesh and blood. Almost as inevitable as saving each other, living for each other, reaching for each other. Over the gates of every turning tide
“I hung up too soon!” the text from his brother says. “This song is EDM! Holy shit. Dean. Your soulmate is way too cool for you.” There is a line of smug emojis and Dean rolls his eyes at his phone. Two minutes later there is a link. Its a Youtube video. He knows it's the song. He really isn't prepared for it. He should really get his headphones. And some comfy clothes. Probably some water. Maybe he should order out. Dean realises he is stalling only after a solid hour of nesting down to properly listen to his song. He is half annoyed at himself and half embarrassed. This is ridiculous. It's just a song. But somehow his hands are shaking a little and it's kinda like the first few times he watched porn. He wants it to be all set up right.
"Cassie, you can't help. You said so yourself. You are stuck together. He can't be separated from you yet. You are grounded." Gabe's eyes gleam with impish joy as he pats Castiel's shoulder. "Why don't you just do your mating nest and flutter those lashes at your human, huh? I will look into it." He flings a ridiculously exaggerated wink at Castiel.
“Yes?” He asks and waits with the same inhuman patience for whatever the hunter might have started this conversation about.
“Mmmm, I'm busy.” Dean growls and stands with ease, taking Cas with him, arms and legs holding on tight.
The paparazzi was here. Of course. Just outside the perimeter where the cops are patrolling the edges. Keeping them away. The last thing they need to see is him losing his shit right now. Crazed Omega screaming at a coffin would make great print. Fuck. A wave of exhaustion washes over him. It’s over. The mad ticking wildness of his life will resume and he can't sit around feeling angst about his choices. Time to move forward.
“Dean. Stop. You are being ridiculous. I am not some untouched virgin. I touch myself plenty. As you very well know. Virginity is a social construct and not a physical tangible thing. It's how people have controlled Omegas for so long. Intellectual innocence is different from physical innocence and I have a very healthy porn habit. Do not treat me like I don't know what I want. I will tell you. You only have to ask me. And besides. You haven't done anything to me yet so stop looking freaked out. I only told you this because I want the excuse of inexperience just in case I really suck at it. I intend to get better. But I will need a lot...of...practice.” he punctuates the last three words with soft kisses against Dean's mouth and slides his palms beneath his t shirt.
Dean flips his keys into the bowl and just rests at the end of the kitchen counter. He presses his fingertips into his burning eyelids and groans. He was so fucking exhausted. He hasn't slept for shit in a solid week. The problem with comforting Omega mating scent, is that it's only comforting when its not fading and slipping away. When that ghostly whisper of desire gets harder and harder to hold on to. It feels like loss. It feels like his goddamn chest had been stomped in. Just a few more days and hopefully it will finally be gone and he can try to forget all of it.
The morning star and brightest of the choir had broken the song and god’s heart. So Lucifer went in anger to the world to fix all of the humans and hurt them with the hearing. So now they hear it. The song of their souls. It is meager. They cannot hear it clearly or well, but they do hear the one closest to the stirring of their being. A soulsong they call it. It is a curse and a gift, like the morningstar himself. Perhaps they will meet someone that is meant for them and maybe that person is a gift or maybe they are a curse. The song doesn’t care at all. It is just as heartless as tides and empty as heaven’s throne.
Gabriel chuckles at the hilarious expression on Castiel's face. "Well I think that is just a side effect. I have been trying to tell you have to tether your grace here, among earthly things. It changes your connection to this vessel that is evolved to live here. Humans experience most of life through the body. You seem to have finally found something to anchor to. Since it's not heavenly, well, you might get some cravings." Gabriel motions with his ever present cherry lolly.
Castiel twists to face the door with an open and calm expression. He is the only person that Dean knows that enters a conversation without a single expectation hanging there. Everyone is always doing an enormous amount of work guessing what other people want and think. They approach conversations as if they are already mapping their answer. It hadn’t ever been so obvious before. Not until he met Cas.
“Well not all of us get all horny for navel gazing Sam. Fuck. I dunno. I was going to. I was figuring I would let what was supposed to happen just happen or whatever. Its fate. Right?” Dean's excuses don't even sound believable to himself and Sam has lived with Dean his entire life.
Everyone moves on. Had moved on. From Dean. Either tragedy or choice had emptied his life of connection and warmth. His father would have sneered at an Alpha wasting his energy on such worries. His gentle son had learned quickly to banish his needs in favor of trying to keep his Father close. To keep connection one has to act like they don't want it. It's just how it is. But Dean is tired. It's been too long since he was emptying his handful of dirt over his father's grave.
The angel agrees and thankfully heads out the door to track down towels. The second the door closes, Dean darts from the bathroom and grabs up a sheet. Towelling himself mostly dry, he digs up some clean jeans and underwear. (I have clean jeans Sam. I can wait another day to do laundry. Note to self: This goes on the ledger of things Sam never needs to know. Right there with the enormous tattoo.)
Dean nuzzles Castiel’s rumbling throat and takes in the scent of his bonded skin. The Omega has picked up leather and pages as they slept together. “Mmhmm likely story. Wait until you got me addicted to your gorgeous body and scent and then the REAL Cas comes out.”
“I didn't picture you feeling like that, Alpha. In fact I always pictured you liking me just like this.” Castiel steps closer to Dean with challenge in shoulders and hips and Dean takes a step back. “I imagined that you like an Omega that knows exactly what he wants.” Cas crowds Dean even further until they bump into the couch and then even closer until their chests are touching. He lowers his voice into a rumbling command “I get to say what I want. I get to say WHO I want. Are you going to fight me on that, Alpha?”
Dean had traveled all this way. He packed his shit and locked up his apartment. He had planned his clothes for the weather and got a translation app on his phone just in case. He knew intellectually that this moment was expected. He mentally gamed out exactly how he should look around the room. He had planned how he would greet his mate. Apparently you can think about something for weeks and still be totally shocked and surprised when it actually happens. Apparently there isn't any way to prepare. The song is a million times more potent live than listening to a recording. The sound had already been reverberating in his bones and the walls. Now it rattles and shakes deeper, into some space he can't touch. He had cried with a longing ache in the coffee shop. He had itched with the drawing pull of the song the entire journey here. But now there is no relief from the throbbing pulse of it and there is nowhere he needs to go. So the song pins him in place and builds into impossible screaming need.
Hunters and witches and demons and all that, they tend to get wrapped up in codes, in symbols and signs and watchwords. It seems a kind of flavor to the occult and supernatural that lends itself to secrets. Angels, it seems, were designed before this system of checks and balances had to be maintained. They came before all of it. The intricacies of weaving a culture and presence into the holes and gaps of human intuition. A werewolf has that special schedule as a survival mechanism. To spend most of its time harmless and blending in. Giving the wolves a chance to propagate and escape. Demons are just complex humans. Twisted, to be sure. But the hierarchy and pecking order and constant struggle for dominance. It has the same patterns that humans do. The high dramatics. The scheming net to trick the world into letting them exist.
“I mean, the materials. Your body was rebuilt after I pulled you from hell. The material was all touched by my grace. Handled by it. I am pretty sure just about every inch of your skin is imbued with grace. You manage to keep breaking it too. So I have healed you. Many times. Infusing your body with grace.” It is Castiel’s turn to be fidgeting with the bottle and avoiding Dean’s eyes. “Grace always bends to return to its source. If you hold a vial of grace next to any angel, it will lean toward it. It is attractive. It seeks to join with the life force of grace that burns inside us. The henge would have a source of power in the grace. The henge would point toward and reach toward it’s original source.”
Of course that lasts about a minute. Because that wild impossible infuriating human begins to touch his goddamn wings! Sure, Castiel can weave the music of the spheres and speak to the wild heart of every living thing. But it is asking too much to radiate cool composure and to calm a room of humans down. Not while this man gently slides his fingertips down one long flight feather. It all starts with just curious touching those wider stiff feathers. But the tactile lure of softness seems to draw the calloused hands deeper into the downy warmth. There is one rough warm brush of his thumb over the inner layer of down and the skin catches sensuously until one of the soft fuzzy feathers tugs free and the tension and release is so good that the angel gasps and feels a messy spurt of precome soak warmly into his clothes. His vessel has never felt so wildly human, so directly affected. His face is flushed pink and every inch of his skin feels aware of the man that is shell shocked and not even aware he is absently and distractedly toying with an angels wings. It's actually adorable and innocent.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel tries to stop staring and glances down at his shoes for a second. Oh right. He is here for a reason. “May I come in?”
“Go ahead, you can laugh.” The man is actually laughing himself, not taking offense at all when Dean loses the battle with his facial muscles. “Love doesn’t always have to be serious and I think our song really does make everyone around us feel happy when they hear it. Just like a hot tub after a long day, it's a real relief to have my girl with me. It suits us just fine.” Garth radiates so much calm happiness about the entire thing that Dean believes him. He couldn’t have imagined anyone connecting that song with simple uncomplicated joy with a partner, but here it was.
It had started to hurt a little bit. To listen to music. He hated longing for some sign of warmth or even a little shimmer of sensation. Other than some goosebumps and general happiness, he kept losing the pleasure of music strictly for itself. The edge of desperation and fruitless delving dimmed his joy and had sort of guided him right into a well worn niche of familiar tunes. It’s sort of typical really, to be halfway through his 30’s and quite content with his playlist. He didn’t have to perk up and deeply listen to his tunes. He knew they weren’t “the one” so he could relax and just enjoy them for what they were. It was comfortable. Stable. Maybe a little boring. Not that he would ever admit such a thing. Outloud.
Castiel simply nods and Dean withdraws his tingling fingers to rub nervously down his thigh. Before he can quite catch his breath, Castiel is moving away. His energetic pace is dragging him out of sight and Dean is left feeling poleaxed.
It took a very very long time of looking to see how inverted the entire system is. Could it be so simple?
Dean is so hard he can barely think enough to shake his head. The raw burning scent of sandalwood rises and his face turns an interesting shade of pink. Castiel smirks knowingly before backing off to let the Dean gather his brain back into some working order. Cas suggests lunch and they both swing into the domestic task with more focus than the task requires. They both have so much to think about.
An Omega presenting is kind of an entire genre of porn. Its overhyped, overdone and too many people with fake eagerness will flop forward and moan and groan and push their rump in the air. This isn’t that. Castiel hadn’t made a single sound. His body isn’t the bony hairless twinks or the airbrushed pinups that preen and pout back at the camera. Castiel’s legs are thick and powerful and dusted with fine hair that is curled and flattened darker by the flood of slick that has soaked down his thighs. His broad shoulders are bunched because his head is bowed while he gathers himself. The swell of his biceps are lined in light and flexed powerfully to hold his body. There is a fine tremor of what might be nerves or arousal. And the center of all of this, his tender hole is flushed pink and swollen just a little. His cock twitches and bumps the side of the tub and it makes that hole pout open for a second, spitting a thin stream of slick and dousing the air with sex. It's the single most feral and raw sexual experience of Dean’s entire life.
“You haven't found them yet. I mean, you would hide your soul song outburst but you wouldn't hide the person you love from us. Would you?” Sam sounds more than just a little hurt by this entire situation and Dean feels a twinge of guilt over not telling Sam. To be fair, he was trying to push the entire situation out of his mind and telling Sam would have just stirred the pot. He felt something like embarrassment. Something like fear and vulnerability. All feelings that he just isn’t ok with. It wasn’t like he had always imagined it. It was way more like being pushed onto a stage wearing your birthday suit. Not like the romantic stories. More like asking for a first date. So painfully unsure and not ready. Never ready. Even though he had always dreamed of being guided by music. This was more like music was shoving him off the diving board.
Those pretty blue eyes are clouded over with worry and Cas licks his dry lips. “Dean, this is my fault. If we didn’t have to wait, you wouldn’t have hurt yourself like this. You obviously really need this from me a lot. I am so sorry. We can stop if it's just too much.” Cas’ voice rises and his worried hands fidget and wring together as his thoughts begin to pile up. “I didn't know! I swear I didn't know that your instinct would hurt you. I can go until all of this is over. Because I'm not sure if I can stop getting excited around you. But if it's--”
Castiel isn’t amused and jabs his elbow into Gabriel’s stomach. “He is human, you ass. Now I am feeling everything. This has done something to my vessel." He can feel the annoyance twisting his face into a pouting frown. Fuck. He was pouting and knew he was and couldn't stop himself.
“So what I am feeling. This pull. This thing. It is all the grace?” Suddenly the bottom drops in his stomach.
"I might have done something, uhm, foolish." Castiel says in a careful quiet voice. Gabe stays silent in a rare display of patience as he threads his fingers beneath the sweep of plumage to draw another strand of lights free.
Castiel almost falls off the stage. The first wave of possessive intention and blatant sexual need drives into his vessel and he steps back from the crowd. As if getting distance from the praying man is going to help. He backs up until the heel of his shoe slips off the back of the stage and he almost falls ass over feathers from the back of the raised platform. A golden ball of light flares in the crowd, just to his left. A soulsong response. He sees them ten times a night. Twenty times. But not this song. It can't be this song. THIS song. It can't be. It's completely impossible. But that voice he has heard all night long, the first human to ever pray directly to him, is enrapt with the torturous pleasure of a soulsong and is lit up like a goddamn beacon in the crowd. And it's getting closer.
“Oh thanks for letting me know, Captain Obvious!” Dean retorts, hoping to pick a squabble and redirect the attention from the fact he had been sneaking in the first place. Castiel seems to take the bait as he rolls his eyes in frustration and sighs before turning to stomp out of the room. Perfect. Now he can slip into the shower without an interrogation.
Dean spills Castiel onto the bed and almost immediately misses holding the weight of him. If his lover wasn’t six foot of tight lean muscle he might have made a way to hold him against the wall for much longer. It scratched some basic need to feel Cas’ weight bearing down hard against his body. The solid press of him is more real and bruising and heavy than the women that Dean had been with before. It was a drugging high to feel his body flexing and burning and taking the brunt of weight. He immediately wants the pressure back, so he rolls to the side and falls to his back on the bed. He reaches to tug Castiel's sleeve and invite the Omega to get on top of him.
What if they could close the doors away from the world? What if Castiel could have whatever he asked for? No. Whatever he demanded. What if this Alpha was different in private. There would be no need to let anyone else know it. They could play pretend for the rest of the world that it all was as it seemed. What if Castiel could bend his Alpha over and… oh shit. Fuck. He has to stop thinking about all these stupid fantasies. It’s ridiculous. One pair of panties doesn’t make Dean a sexual deviant or total outlier to his type. And he might be totally enraged. He might be on the phone right this second firing his Mom. He might be calling the cops. Either way, it's all in Mr. Winchester’s hands now. Castiel prays that he is merciful.
When he had done it, he hadn't mentioned it to anyone. Didn't want to say his hopes out loud. Felt like it would jinx it. Didn't want anyone feeling sorry for him when it didn't work. Wearing a failed spell on your skin might be a tad humiliating for sure. He hadn’t been sure though. It had taken days and days. Weeks.Every day limping along as the tattoo ached and wept and then scabbed and itched.
So now Dean has to keep his shirt on. Because Castiel didn't stay dead. He had come back. And if he saw Dean's back he would probably have a few questions. Like, oh maybe "What is that enormous tattoo all about?"
After the angel had walked into that reservoir and ended that awful chapter of their life, Dean had tracked down just about every esoteric and pointless scrap of information he could about angels. He had been raised on lore. The fact that angels had remained hidden from the hunter community and from Dean himself until he was a grown ass man, it meant more than he ever thought about really.
Gabriel attempts to lighten the mood by sliding an arm around Castiel’s shoulder and pulling him close in a conspiratorial embrace. “Well, Cassie when an angel and another angel love each other very very much, there is some glowing and some admiring and some singing and--”
“Yes. It is likely that the rock would be picked up by someone and carried closer to me. Then another circumstance like a flood or car would push the rock closer. Until one day I would be reunited with the lost piece of grace. It works the other way too. I am pulled toward it. I would find myself turning in that direction. I would notice things looking very nice in that path. Choices I make would bring me toward it.”
The angel takes another deep breath and reluctance is in every single inch he gives back to Dean with the slow loosening of his arm. “Just one more second.” He asks, still brushing Dean’s back with the warmth of his breath.
“Dean?” He asks with obvious suspicion. His brows scrunch down in that familiar confused expression that transforms to a grimace of disgust. “There is a terrible smell.”
Cas immediately regrets his word choice as his face floods with heat. His ears turn pink. He squirms with embarrassment and presses a hand to his hot face. “I would have to use that word.”
“Cas. What are you….are you ok?” Dean awkwardly tries to turn, but Cas stubbornly keeps holding him in place.
Dean is too busy trying to reboot his brain by the time he remembers his back. Oh fuck. Shit. Almost being dead two seconds ago puts it into clear perspective though. He is fucking tired of hiding from Castiel. It was stupid. Juvenile crap. The angel just saved his life. Again. There is no goddamn reason for him to be scooting awkwardly with his back to Castiel. Or wearing three damn layers on 90 degree days. It is all ridiculous.
It doesn't stop. This song must be about a million years in length because it rolls on and on and the heartbeat of it won’t stop pulsing beneath his skin and he wants to run away and stay here at the same time. He can’t keep his knees solid and manages to flop into his seat again and hides his face against his forearms on the freshly cleaned tabletop. Like a kid playing thumbs-up-seven-up in school, he rests there and just endures the music until it finally winds to a merciful conclusion. The helpful barista is there with a stack of napkins and he mops his face and tries to think of one single way to recover any sort of dignity. Thankfully, she is the best barista in the world because she is shooing off the spectators and she fills in the awkward silence immediately.
“Dean.” Cas eventually says. “It isn’t turned off or powered down. It would still work. It can still work. I think that no matter where you go, if you pour more intention into it, if you repeat the prayer with focus and will, I think you would pull me to wherever you are.”
Dean lowers his voice to draw them into even further intimacy, “And they have you here. Doing this. While your Mother must need you. Seriously Cas. It ain’t right.”
“Dean. I started all of this so I could be with you, but I really believe in what I am doing. I never want you to think I mated you just to get away from my shitty family. I want to be completely free and have every choice open to me when I decide to mate.” Cas leans forward as if he can somehow push his sincerity into his words with his body.
Dean had no way to know that his Omega was so scared that he was in trouble. Too scared to ask his Mom if he can tag along. Especially to Mr. Winchester's house. So while Dean is wallowing, Castiel is trying not to choke on his dinner. His mother is telling him about how strangely clean Mr. Winchester's house had been. And how weird that the laundry wasn’t done, but the hamper was sitting right out in the middle of the bedroom. Castiel fights the color rising in his face and tries to breathe. It doesn't seem like he is in trouble at all. Message received, Alpha.
It is so much, so fast. Too many weird and wild mood swings in a single hour. “Cas. Can we just go back to the hotel? I will tell you everything and we will figure it out. But I need to process for a second. I want to put a shirt on. It’s been months since I went anywhere without a shirt on and I feel really naked and confused.”
Flipping the pile of clean clothes from the laundry onto the freshly made bed, Castiel hummed a song and began to tuck clothes into their places. He is carefully sliding open the drawer for a soft pile of underwear, when his sensitive nose is hit with a stronger hot dose of that scent. Only now it is underlined with the deep commanding scent of sandalwood. Holy fuck. Immediately his young body reacts to the smell of aroused Alpha. He pushes his face into the drawer and his hands scrabble to find the source. There. A pair of satin panties. So lovely. They had been put back in the drawer soaked in the musky claiming scent of sex.
But it hurt. Every single cell of his body cried out for his lover. To even touch his hand would be enough to rest tonight. But he won’t. Tonight he will enter his silent dark home and scent the air. And it won’t smell of mate and home. It had faded long ago, and the bond soon after that. Losing it had felt like a relief and a torture all at once. Sure, he wasn't feverish and nauseated with pining sickness. But the hollow in his chest still ached. And his healthy Alpha body bouncing back and refusing to pine anymore felt like betrayal. He will unpack his groceries and stop with shock when the glossy magazine flops onto the counter. He won't remember buying it. Maybe he is haunted. The airbrushed perfection of his mate's eyes will stare and stare from the pages as he collapses to the floor. To cry one more time
Dean reaches for Castiel's hand and laces their fingers together. “I have to get going, Cas. Please let your Mom know that I stopped by.” Dean drops the barest brush of his lips over the inside of Castiel's wrist.
Dean turns around. Mostly because it gives him a way out of having to speak any more. Every scenario he had conjured up about this very moment had somehow failed to prepare him.
“You know, people are gonna start asking interesting questions if they figure out these things aren’t fake. You gotta hold still, Cassie. He reprimands the angel while looping the heavier battery pack down by the smooth rill of muscles that bulk around his spine to support the great wings. Tearing off another strip of athletic tape, he secures the pack and nods with satisfaction.
Cas tilts his head and squints at Dean.. Well fuck. There goes his mouth again. “You, uh. Figure things out pretty quick.” It takes the Alpha about ten seconds to remember why the hell he had decided Cas was pretty smart in the first place. The things Cas had “figured out”. Namely his panty kink. And there goes his face again.
Dean tries not to have a heart attack at the completely direct and matter of fact tone in Castiel’s voice. “Holy fuck, Cas. You are trying to kill me.”
He steps beneath the spray wearing his disgusting shirt and sighs with relief. Finally. He made it. He can wash the shirt here, wring it out pretty good and it won’t kill him to wear a damp shirt to the laundromat across the street. All good.
Unfortunately, he has never shared a hotel room with anything he was trying to sneak past, and just as he is touching the door handle to the bathroom, of course Castiel has to waltz into the room like a blue eyed disaster. Fuck. Dean tries to hide his startled face but he isn’t quite fast enough because Castiel examines his guilty expression and his obvious bid to dive into the bathroom. The angel’s eyes narrow.
“Oh, well I guess it could be a girl” Charlie hedges. “But I have gay magic powers and I have a gut feeling. It’s a Him.”
So Dean feels. He feels safe. Like he can turn red and be ridiculous and blab about plants and still be smiling here with Cas. He is ok with it. With any other man, at any other time of his life, he would not have been ok. He would have headed for the door long ago. He wouldn't endure the discomfort. He wouldn’t bear the exposure. He would have realised the risk of another man seeing him like this and freaked the fuck out. Was he maturing? Was it the scent bond already building and smoothing the way for them? The solo sex? What had changed? Maybe all of it together. Or maybe Cas was the reason.
Dean is dizzy “Oh fuck. Fuck. Cas please. So hot. I love that mess you make. Don’t stop.” His voice sounds ragged and shaky. He is squirming on his knees and his dick is so hard that it hurts. He whimpers a second time as he unzips his pants to relieve the pressure.
