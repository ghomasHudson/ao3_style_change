Bruce is reading the newspaper and absentmindedly munching on toast while Natasha and Clint are throwing grapes at each other in some kind of competition and Thor is keeping score of it.
Tony’s not surprised by this but he is surprised by the sadness that grows at the thought of Nebula going away.
And Steve knows Tony is insecure and tends to think very little of himself. So of course he would immediately think Steve’s avoidance of him comes from a place of hate, especially after how the last interactions Tony remembers between them went.
For the first time in the conversation Steve feels the familiar burn deep in his stomach that he’s come to associate with Tony.
She moves away from the kitchen counter and comes to start next to Tony. “But because I’m not stupid and I know you, I’ll escort you to your room myself.”
The first one shows two emojis, the angel and the heart-eyed face. Steve, now well-versed in the art of Tony-Text, guesses this is Tony’s way of saying Steve looks like an angel that he’s very much in love with.
Tony’s hands settle on Steve’s head, his fingers tangling up in Steve’s blond locks, but he doesn’t push or deter Steve’s movements, just feels the strands of hair with his palms and fingertips.
Clint’s and Thor’s situations are nothing alike and yet Clint’s and Thor’s situations are everything alike.
“Yeah, that’s normally what happens when one goes days without sleep.” The teasing is light-hearted and makes Tony chuckle. “C’mon,” Steve signals, pushing Tony’s pants down his legs.
They eat as they chat and this time when a silence grows between them it feels natural and bearable.
It was difficult -and it is still an on going process- to reconcile himself as both his past and his present, to see himself as who he was
Focusing his gaze on the crown of Steve’s head during one of the moments that Steve’s eyes are focused on the shield, Tony starts to talk, his voice unwavering, his speech unplanned but flowing perfectly once he gets going.
Tony, for his part, had not stopped looking at Steve. His face had yet to completely dry from the melted snow and his nose was red from the cold, making him look soft and cuddly. Steve groaned in his head and chastised himself for being so cheesy. He had it bad already, damn it.
Pepper was right -of course she was- when she said Tony would have loved to introduce Steve to every 21st century thing. As soon as Steve gives the go ahead Tony immerses him in a thousand things he hadn’t even contemplated experiencing before. Steve hadn’t even thought it was possible, considering that since meeting Pepper and Rhodey Steve has dived himself into the new century as much as he’s been able to.
Tony can hear him snore when he walks by the door to his room, the one that was made especially for him but he never used except for the couple of days after Thanos when everyone used the Compound as home base.
It takes him a week to honor his promise and call Miss Potts and he tells himself all kinds of excuses for it: a SHIELD mission keeping him too busy, keeping up with his work-out routine, helping on relief and restoration around the City…
As Earth gets closer and closer in their journey and it gets easier to see it in its entirety Tony can immediately spot the differences to when he left it, when he took that last glance back at it before he made his way into that strange alien spaceship, pondering if that was going to be the last time he ever saw it.
And it’s something in Steve’s eyes, in the slight tremble of his voice, in the infinitesimal space between their knees and the way the sun is bathing the room in a golden light. It’s something in the way they both lost so much and yet they still have each other. It’s something in their shared pasts but it’s more something in their upcoming futures. It’s something unexplainable and inimitable that makes Tony do exactly that. He believes Steve.
Natasha tends to describe him as honest. Honest because he rarely lies to any of them and honest in his intentions. They’ve recently established an strong rapport together and she’s become bolder around him. She speaks her mind and challenges him when she’s not happy with one of his decisions and although she has never said it out-loud Steve knows she also thinks of him as a determined -at times stubborn- person.
He was never that close to Clint himself back when the Avengers were still the Avengers. In fact, out of all the original members Clint was definitely the one Tony had had less of a bond with.
He closes his eyes, deliberately this time, and he doesn’t have to wait long for sleep to claim him once again.
He gives up fighting the regrets that keep trying to take over his mind and just lets them feast. In Afghanistan most of them had to do with having spent most of his life in a drunken haze, not having been a good enough friend to Rhodey and not having been honest about his growing feelings for Pepper. Space awakens in him this relentless grief about Peter and his failure to protect him. Space is also witness to his despair over not having been able to help Rhodey better and not having been able to keep his promises to Pepper.
Tony doesn’t need him to elaborate further to immediately understand, and Steve knows this simply by taking a quick look out of the corner of his eye at Tony’s face.
Steve stays behind a little longer to deal with the press and some civilians, all in the way Pepper, him and a team of Stark Industries’ professionals have discussed and planned for a while.
“What?” she asks, although by her tone of voice Tony can tell she already knows what Tony’s thinking.
“You don’t have to apologize for him, Nat,” Tony assures her as they’re talking a walk around the gardens together.
Steve is surprised by the speed of his own thoughts. If he had had to guess before he would have thought he’d have problems coming up with the right words and phrases. Of the two of them Tony is always the more talkative one in bed but there is something about imagining Tony halfway across the world reading this and feeling aroused that makes everything spill out of Steve’s mind easily.
Steve moves from his position laid-down and starts to incorporate himself, ending up seated in the middle of the couch.
Tony doesn’t see him but he catches up with Natasha on the common kitchen when he gets back from a meeting related to Stark Industries in Boston.
“I’m not afraid of you,” Tony repeats, completely truthful and hoping Steve believes him. “I’m not.”
Tony clears his throat and places his hands under his thighs, sitting on them, so he won’t fidget with them excessively. His fingers still tick nervously under his legs but he just presses his thighs further into the couch’s cushion.
He knows what Rhodey wants to say, the issues he will remind them of: the fact that the military and the authorities will most likely call for a trial, the mental state Clint’s in, the complications they’ve already encountered while trying to locate him because it’s not like they haven’t been trying. But Tony knows that’s not what Natasha needs to hear and he knows Natasha’s already more than aware about all those things.
Without saying another word to Steve Tony starts walking towards his walk-in closet. Steve doesn’t call out to him, just stays behind sitting on his bed, waiting patiently as his eyes follow Tony across the room.
There is no real explanation for Tony’s obsession with wearing Steve’s clothes but Tony has found that it isn’t really a pressing matter anymore, that there are more important issues. Like, for example, figuring out how far he can go with fondling Steve in the kitchen before Barton starts screaming at them for public indecency.
His voice sounds confused but from his position Tony can’t really see Steve because he’s still laying down curled up on himself, his back to the door. With his eyes closed Tony listens to the sounds of Steve coming in and moving around the room. He tries to concentrate on identifying the sounds and he’s able to discern some of them: here’s Steve taking his shoes off, here’s Steve taking off his jacket, here’s Steve making his way towards the bed.
“It’s been twenty-three days since Thanos came to Earth,” Steve is saying, but everything sounds remote and hollow to Tony, like he’s still back in the spaceship, thousands and thousands of miles away while the remaining Avengers are having this conversation.
It’s the longest minute of Tony’s life and when it ends, protocol be damned, Tony walks down the makeshift stage hurriedly, not waiting for any of his friends. Tony looks around for a few minutes until he finds the most discreet place he can in the tumult of backstage. There’s no press here, no government representatives aside from some very busy-looking people with clipboards that are walking back and forth a few feet from him and paying him no attention.
It only takes Pepper a minute to get to the Avengers’ common floor from her own, and she’s just a blur when she comes in and beelines directly for Tony, enveloping him in her arms as she buries her face on his shoulder. Steve’s eyes fill up with tears when he hears Pepper start sobbing as she repeats Tony’s name over and over again.
“We need a better strategy.” proposed Steve. “We’ll never have a shot if we just run towards them blindly: Natasha is too quick and slippery and Sam pushes your buttons so hard that you just charge at him indiscriminately.”
“I bet you’re wondering what this has to do with you and with our meeting,” Pepper guesses, and she’s right. “I just… I know that if Tony was…” Her voice breaks and she has to take a deep breathe to steady it. “I know that if Tony was alive he would already be so invested in the idea of the Avengers. He’d be devoting himself to the team. He always thought of himself as not being a team player and maybe he wasn’t the best at it but…. Tony, he was… He gave his all to the things that mattered to him and I have this feeling deep in my heart that the team would have mattered a lot to him.”
Tony welcomes the anger, glad from the distraction from his pain and his own guilt. He revels in it and lets it take over, lets it drive him.
“Hmmm,” Steve seems to think about it carefully as he strokes the cheek that doesn’t still have Tony’s hand on it.
Because if there is one thing that Steve Rogers will always be grateful for, if there is one thing the twenty-first century has granted him that he kicks himself for not appreciating sooner is Tony Stark. Tony Stark and his way of living and fighting and loving.
By noon Pepper video-chats him to wish him a good day and Tony goes into his workshop to take the call.
“But it’s still your choice,” Tony whispers as he pulls his arm out from the leather straps and holds the shield from its edge with his hands. He brings it forward towards Steve. An offering but not exactly a gift. Maybe a surrendering of sorts.
Steve blinks at him and opens his mouth, making Tony believe he’s going to speak, but he just yawns. He holds up a finger silently asking Tony to wait and he only puts it down when he’s done yawning.
It’s fast and efficient and the second the last of the nanobots slips into place Tony feels it deep in his bones. The suit is him and he is the suit.
He looks Tony in the eye when the only drink he takes for himself during the meal is a glass of water and he thumps Steve on the arm when he thanks him for making the dinner.
He knows he need not apologize but there’s something in him that compels him too, anyway. It’s not guilt, embarrassment or doubt because this is Steve in front of him. Maybe it’s habit, or some sort of learnt instinct that’s impossible to get rid of, he’s not sure.
Her voice sounds almost flat, devoid of any emotion, like it’s trying very hard to give nothing away and that’s what ends up giving her away the most.
Tony’s heart is beating wildly inside his chest and he can feel Steve going rigid next to him, his hands fisting on the couch’s cushions. He can’t see Bruce from his position but he can hear the surprised exhalation he just let out.
When he went off to MIT his money meant he could afford eating out every day, whether at the cafeteria or any restaurant around campus he so pleased. It’s not even like he went out that much anyway, more into ordering pizza and any kind of take out, or demanding that Rhodey bring him snacks throughout the day, which Rhodey always did, albeit begrudgingly at times.
As you can see the number of chapters for this fic has gone up once again and I now think this story will have a minimum of 10 chapters. Notice how I said minimum? Yeah, I'm still not sure that's the final count.
At the same time Bruce had brought forth his deep worries about Thor and the idea to try and connect with him again to bring him to the Compound and so, even if they were concerned about Ronin, they had had to put that aside and they started developing their plan to bring Thor back to them.
Pepper living in the Tower and managing Avengers’ business means Steve gets to see her quite regularly but they both make an effort to not make all the time they spend together be related to work.
Tony pulls his fingers away from Steve’s mouth and brings them over to his own, sucking on them as well. Steve’s lustful gaze focused on him is addictive and Tony already knows he’ll die to keep it on him forever and ever and ever.
He knows it’s not his fault, and he’s learning day by day that he doesn’t need to deprive himself of the people that surround him because some part of him tells him he doesn’t deserve them.
When Rhodey finally picks up his phone after the third call JARVIS puts through he’s the first one to ask if what’s happening is real. JARVIS quickly confirms it is, reassuring them by saying he’s run any sort of test he could think of running, and Tony himself makes some kind of inside joke that only Rhodey understands and that makes him choke on his words when he promises he’ll be there as soon as he can, twenty four hours maximum. Steve tears up again when Rhodey pronounces a heartfelt I love you to Tony before hanging up.
When he receives confirmation that that text has sent correctly too Steve moves away from the windows and goes to sit on the couch, in front of the television, although he leaves it turned off and he doesn’t tear his eyes away from the device in his hands.
The non-sequitur confuses Tony and makes him turn his body towards Steve’s looking deeply into his eyes to try and find an explanation.
No one speaks after her for a few seconds and Natasha’s eyes don’t move from the paper in her hands.
Is he thinking about it deeply, trying to come to a decision? Is he looking for the words to deny Tony best? Does he suspect anything at all or is he trying to guess at Tony’s mysteriousness?
Tony, predictably, heads for the coffee first and then takes a sit next to Bruce, who offers him a smile with crumbs all over his yet unshaved stubble.
There are days they can’t stand to look at each other after their sessions, and not even just at each other but at anyone else they live with. The guilt is too powerful and they need to be alone. They all understand by now, luckily,  and it’s almost like it never happened when they rejoin life around the Compound.
But once again Tony lost and once again Steve is gloating because if there is one thing Steve Rogers had been born as and has never, ever lost -even through all the trials and tribulations of his life- it is being stubborn and competitive.
Since living together at the Compound, Tony has started seeing Steve more unkempt that he ever had before, even during the time the Avengers had all lived together at the Tower.
“First, I hope you know this means we’re now dating which means you’re obligated to go on a date with me. You good with that?”
But then he thinks of going back to his quarters and taking a shower before getting into his big bed to spend most of the night staring up into the ceiling. He thinks of closing his eyes to try and fall asleep only to see the faces of everyone’s he’s lost. He thinks of waking up disoriented after only a few hours of sleep, not sure what year it is, not sure where he’s at.
“Tony,” Bruce pronounces and it’s incredible how well Tony can read him even after three years of not having seen him even once.
If Tony had to give a rough estimate of the number of people that have congregated in front of the White House for the memorial he would confidently say there are around 2 million people that have come from all over the country for this. Probably also from all over the world.
“Dum-E was the first,” Tony explains. “And that’s D-U-M-slash-E. I’ve seen you write it as D-U-M-M-Y in some sketches you drew of him and left here in the workshop.”
Tony doesn’t think there’s anything worthy or useful he can add to the conversation and so he doesn’t participate.
Before, he didn’t have the full strength of Steve’s attention on him and he could pretend the staring he was doing was innocent and harmless. But with Steve aware of it it feels dangerous and risky, like he was doing something wrong and forbidden.
Steve never stopped twitching and letting out this mellow whines that brought an indescribable pain to Tony’s chest, he kept breathing heavily through his dreams.
A frown deepens the lines on Steve’s face and Tony is hit by the sudden realization of how Steve looks older than he did when they both first met. It shouldn’t be that surprising because over 6 years have gone by since then and Tony can definitely tell
Steve swallows and his eyes fill with tears when he remembers how hard those first few weeks were for Tony’s best friends.
His room at the Compound has been nothing but a place to keep some of his clothes to change into if he’s ever in a rush for a meeting for a while now so walking into it brings back a weird feeling for Tony.
The previously green spots now look more brown than ever and there is a duller sensation that comes from seeing his home planet from the outside. There’s less brilliance, less light, and even though Tony knows Earth has never emitted light before, he wonders if it really has started to shine a little less brightly.
The appeal of going out and parading around town when on a date was lost for Tony well into the early 2000s. Even when he was dating Pepper Tony saw the times when they went out as somewhat of a necessary evil. There was nothing that could compete with staying home and just being, the two of them and no one else.
It’s getting closer to 8 at night but Steve doesn't feel hungry enough to head upstairs and have dinner yet. He’s been in the workshop since he came back from a meeting with Fury at SHIELD early in the afternoon. He had left the SHIELD base so frustrated his first instinct had been to walk into the ‘shop and surround himself with the bots.
“Anyway, that’s what I wanted to say,” Tony stutters, his words coming much faster now. “You hate me but even so I’m willing to share my best friends with you because I love them and they love you and I believe you love them too so… Yeah.”
Time in space seems to move in a confusing pattern too: it’s trying to fix the ship and fear and a weirdly formed companionship with Nebula.
Before Tony can start overthinking things and come to incorrect conclusions -because Steve knows him and he knows this will happen if he doesn't do something to stop it- Steve places both of his hands on Tony’s cheeks and captures Tony’s lips with his own again. The action is a little bit selfish because Steve isn't sure how Tony will react to what he’s going to tell him next.
Tony doesn’t see the figure’s face but he knows it’s Peter. He knows it in his heart and his soul and in every part of his being. He knows it like he knows missing Peter is something that will never go away for him. He knows it like he knows the regret will never leave his body, will always be a part of his skin.
“That’s what we needed, Cap. Protection. And I needed you. I said we’d lose and you said we’d do that together too. Well, guess what? We lost and you weren’t even there! None of the Avengers were even there with me! Together. HA!”
Steve doesn’t move an inch even as a few seconds pass. He crosses his arms and stands with his feet at hip distance, still positioned right in front of the sofa, now obstructing Tony’s view of the TV. Tony has to actually bend his neck back to be able to look him in the eye properly. Steve’s lips are pressed tightly together and his eyebrows are set in a deep frown. He looks mad, coiled tight with frustration and anger from his jaw and his shoulders to the way his feet are planted.
Natasha does need her time alone to process and work through her feelings so she very decidedly and unashamedly kicks them out after half an hour or so of silent companionship.
When he was little his upbringing never had him worrying about food on his table, and although Tony has vague memories of entire days spent with Jarvis in a kitchen, he never really learnt anything about cooking, just interested in spending his time with the person that always regarded him the fondest. Jarvis’ cooking will always be Tony’s favorite and sometimes he thinks he would do anything to go back and share a meal with him one last time, maybe even learn something this time around.
It truly does. Every time Tony leaves scratches down the slope of Steve’s back Steve can’t help but stare at them in the mirror when they’re done until he can almost see them fading away rapidly due to his advanced healing.
His voice is now nothing more than a whisper and he can feel himself slowly deflating but he says, “So I got nothing for you, Cap. No coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. I’ve got nothing,” his finger hits Steve’s hard chest, right in the center of his sternum. “Zero.” Another jab with his finger, this time harder. “Zip.” Another tap even though his arm is shaking now. “Nada.”
Tony has never been a person that has given much thought to any of these but for most of the world these days used to mean something good and worthy of celebration and now they've been tainted and made mostly unenjoyable.
Tony, who always makes sure to make Steve’s every day better in any way he can. Tony, who is so selfless it sometimes terrifies Steve. Tony, who was the first one of the two to say I love you. Tony, who acted surprised when Steve said it back. Tony, because it’s always Tony.
Space and Afghanistan couldn’t be further apart and yet Tony feels like in the past 10 years he hasn’t actually moved at all, that he’s still that irredeemable man that lived his live without having made any positive impact on anyone.
Memorials and tributes start happening almost immediately and Steve remembers one of the few conversations he had with Stark one on one, the one in the helicarrier after Agent Coulson died.
Steve’s laughter starts dying down slowly and soon he goes completely silent. It’s almost as if the sounds he had been making before have been taken far away never to be heard again.
Tony can feel his cheeks heating up and he feels a lump on his throat, a hundred emotions pressing down on his chest. He loops his arms around Steve’s narrow waist and burrows his head into the blonde’s chest.
Natasha bids her goodnight the earliest and she leaves for her room after planting a kiss on each of the men’s foreheads.
Temperature in space seems to always be dramatic too. Space during the time that coincides with when he’s awake -because it can’t exactly be called daytime- is cold and when the time comes around for him to lay down space is so hot he can feel sweat roll down his forehead as he tries to fall asleep with his jacket bundled up under his head. Well, that’s not true, space is neither hot nor cold, at least not that Tony can tell. The spaceship that Tony is traveling in
When he’s standing right next to the pair he brings a hand to Natasha’s elbow and cups it lightly, gently squeezing it through her long-sleeved black shirt.
Steve closes his eyes and moves upwards a little like he’s trying to subtly press into the movements of Tony’s hand.
It’s that last word that convinces Steve to do it. Virginia Potts doesn’t seem like the type of woman to ask for things, much less ask for things that imploringly.
“What a day, huh?” Tony tries to joke but he realizes too late his voice is much too dark for it to hit properly.
“I’m a futurist, remember?” Tony jokes, the right corner of his mouth lifting in a sarcastic manner.
It is unfair to his precious partners to say that all of it has to do with Steve himself. The world isn’t what it was when Tony used to go out with other people. Things are mellower. The streets are emptier. People are more empathetic. Or at least it feels that way.
“They did,” Steve laughs. “Some had handmade shields and it was so adorable when they’d come to show me.”
“You’re right about me not being able to say I love you yet,” Tony starts to explain. “I’ve got trust issues on top of my affection issues on top of self-worth issues and that makes it… Difficult for me to open myself up completely and give away all of me. But I can feel it happening, Steve, I’m falling for you too.”
Natasha doesn’t mince or sugarcoat her words and the shock that goes through his body makes it feel like the room has suddenly turned a hundred degrees hotter.
Tony has been looking at Steve in the past hour for longer that he’s done so in weeks but now he really focuses on him, trying to read in the tightness around his eyes, the lowered corners of his lips and the slight tremble of his fingers how best to proceed.
“I’d love to,” Tony accepts before letting go of Steve’s hand and standing. “Now, would you like another plate?”
Natasha pulls her hand away from Tony’s as she shrugs. “It’s no one’s fault. That’s the most difficult part, maybe.”
The first thing Steve takes notice of when his lips touch Tony’s is how soft they are. The second is how right the kiss feels.
Two minutes after Bruce’s departures Steve clears his throat gently, pulling Tony’s attention away from the book he was reading on his tablet. Tony switches the screen off and turns to the left look at him where they’re both sharing the couch. Steve looks fidgety, running a hand through his hair and mussing it up, one of his knees bouncing lightly and making the couch shake lightly.
Tony stops walking when he’s standing right in front of Steve, almost right between the V that his thighs form.
He’s not ready to let go of Pepper but he needs to feel Rhodey, to know he’s not just imagining this. He moves one of his hands and extends it towards his best friend who doesn’t hesitate to grab it and intertwine their fingers.
As he looks around he realizes this is true for everyone in this room, even the people he didn’t know well before this moment. Their emotions, their fears, their regrets… He can see them in every single person in the room.
His walking away from the Compound and joining his people in the little town in Norway they’ve started making as their own should have brought him a little peace. As it seems Thor has been doing worse than ever and by Valkyrie’s estimates he’s only getting worse.
“I feel well,” Tony replies and he isn’t surprised when he realizes it is the truth. There are ups and there are downs and even thought it has taken what feels like eons, it is completely true.
Maria Stark, dressed in long, silk gowns and tall, pointy heels, looked perfectly made for such sophisticated clothing. She was queen of everything from what Tony could perceive, the air of rooms suddenly changing every time she walked through the doors. She commanded attention but she never seemed to demand it, and she would look radiant even in the grayest of days.
him after so long, it proves to Tony that even from the darkest and most difficult times things can grow and blossom, things that you never imagined. Things that you never knew you wanted and now you can’t imagine who you’d be without them.
It doesn’t take Tony longer than three minutes to explore Steve’s room with his gaze and, through it all, Steve waits patiently next to a chest of drawers. He’s half sitting on them and one of his hands is gripping its edge while the other holds a square package. Tony hasn’t seen where he got it from but he can now see it’s wrapped in gift wrapping paper.
Before Steve had dismissed the idea of JARVIS sounding worried but there is no denying now that JARVIS’ tone of voice sounds wistful and in just a second Steve comprehends that JARVIS misses Tony. He misses him in the same human and real way that Pepper and Rhodey do.
When he opens his eyes again JARVIS has brightened the room a bit, not to the lights’ full extent but enough that Steve now feels more comfortable. He looks around his bedroom and takes inventory of a few of the items in it. It helps with focusing his mind again and while he can’t completely forget it numbs the memory of what he’s gone through a little.
He tries to think of something to say, something to diffuse the tension he can feel building up inside him. It’s a fruitless effort and after five or so seconds he’s still drawing a blank.
“Sure,” he says and he points towards the kitchen. “I’m feeling hungry. You want to help me prepare breakfast? Maybe some pancakes?”
“You literally just said it wasn't about my bad day,” Tony points out. “So make up your fucking mind, Steve.”
A short but noticeable silence follows Steve’s question and Steve is confused. Does JARVIS have to think his answers? Is he hesitating over his answer for any particular reason?
Is Steve still alive? Did he die fighting Thanos? Did he die during the snap? Did his ashes also sway with the wind as his unbecoming took over him?
It’s no small thing that Pepper and Rhodey, two people that loved Tony so whole-heartedly, think Steve would have been worthy of their best friend. It feels nice to know there are people who think of him -Steve Rogers and not Captain America- in such a high manner. He never got to truly know Tony when he was alive but the things Steve has learnt about him after his death prove that it’s an honor to be considered someone who could have matched him and deserved him.
Tony doesn’t keep count of how many days he and Steve have been together but they’ve been together for around 5 months when it happens.
“Being up there,” he tries to explain, wanting to be honest but needing to keep it light, more for her sake than his. “It wasn’t easy.”
This is it and Tony knows as soon as it starts. This is the last piece that Steve was keeping to himself finally coming out in the open.
Something in Tony’s chest had given a painful lurch at the words. “I’m glad you honored me with being able to see you watch them for the first time, then.”
When her eyes open again a tear escapes the corner of her left eye and starts making a slow descent down the side of her face.
“He needs to stay here,” Natasha says. “He needs the support and New Asgard is too busy rebuilding itself to lend it to him.”
Steve grabbed a hold Tony’s hand and shook it. More than anything in that moment Steve wished they both hadn’t been wearing gloves so he could feel Tony’s skin and warmth.
Just a last name. Just a word that brings them back a thousand steps into the past, a past they’ve fought hard to rebuild. A past they’re still trying to give meaning too.
In the middle of everything there’s Tony Stark, in his full Iron Man suit except for the helmet. His face is completely uncovered and he’s wearing a huge, jovial smile. He’s got a small boy in his arms, his forearms to the boy’s stomach and chest, leaving the kid laid down in the air. The boy can’t be older than four years old and he’s got one of his short arms stretched out making a fist, like he’s pretending to fly through clouds in the sky. Tony really is hovering only a few inches from the ground and he’s moving very slowly to create a little bit of movement, making a slight breeze ruffle the boy’s hair.
“I missed you.” The words are murmured into Tony’s hair, as if Steve was embarrassed to be saying them. “I know I’ve been going to your shop constantly and haven’t stopped annoying you but I just really missed you. It’s been weird sleeping on my own these past two nights.”
Bruce’s words create an invisible but telling effect on the rest of them. They all know out of all of them Bruce had been the closest to Thor since the time he spent on space that he hasn't yet told anyone else about. He had been the one trying the hardest to help pull Thor out of the grand, black hole the Asgardian had fallen in and every time he failed he still stood next to Thor, lending him a shoulder to cry on, sitting with him as Thor didn’t say a word in hours, making sure he wouldn’t harm himself too badly.
“Regarding the Accords,” Steve starts. “I’m sorry that things happened how they happened because I believe we were both right in some ways. I understood where you were coming from and I understood that the world needed some kind of promise from us, a show of goodwill, us recognizing that we’re not infallible and that our viewpoint is not the only valid one. But I couldn’t get on board with something that felt so much like signing the Avengers off to other leaders. I felt like we were being made into puppets to be controlled by people that we didn’t even know, people that said they had the world’s interests at heart but… How could we really tell? How could I trust them?”
“Well, we didn’t even make it past the foreplay before we came,” Tony explains. “How teenager-y of us.”
It’s uncanny how many of Bruce’s mannerisms and quirks Tony can recognize on the Hulk’s body. The way Bruce scrunches his nose when someone compliments him or draws attention to him, the way his fingers twitch like he’s got unreleased energy running through them. It’s also a little hysterical to watch him walk around wearing a pair of thick-rimmed glasses and a cardigan he designed and confectioned to be Hulk’s size.
Tony uses the hand that was cleaning Steve’s tears to cup his cheek and bring Steve’s face closer to his. He rests his forehead against Steve’s forehead, and now their bodies are so close Tony can bodily feel the quakes going through Steve’s muscles.
It’s been quite a long time since Natasha’s felt the need to disguise herself or hide anything at the Avengers Compound and the fact that she’s trying to do some semblance of it again raises alarms in Tony’s mind immediately.
“What’s wrong?” Steve says, his hand moving closer to Tony’s head, like he’s going to caress him or run his fingers through his hair.
“I never said it made sense. Few things about me do,” Tony points out, trying to lighten the situation after his comment. He knows it’s useless but pretending like he still has some semblance of control over the situation makes him feel a tiny bit better. It helps him not hyperventilate or break down crying in any second.
Tony raises an eyebrow and a foggy image makes way in his mind: Steve, saying that same exact word as Tony hit the floor and lost consciousness.
“He was alone in a lonely, little planet. Just waiting for someone to put him out of his misery, I guess.”
Tony’s voice is quiet, nothing more than a soft whisper, like he doesn’t want to disturb Rome and its   silence, Rome and its perplexing familiarity.
But there’s still the tiny part of him that expects to be taken advantaged of, the part of his brain that always believes the other shoe is about to drop when it comes to the people he’s got in his life. That part of him, coupled with the slight change in Steve’s tone of voice raises every single one of Tony’s alarms.
Tony thinks the worst times might be when a dream that would in no way fit the kid’s presence rearranges itself so that with no warning he’s there and Tony always feels a genuine sense of surprise, no matter how used to it he should be by now.
Having her in front of him is painful and delightful both because if there was one thing he never doubted through everything that happened between them back then was that Natasha was hurting too. If there was something he never once doubted it was that Natasha, inexplicably, after everything they had been through, cared about him too.
Steve and Bruce have taken to work in different ways where cooking is now concerned: sometimes they both work together mostly silently, only giving each other directions and asking for things; other times they divide the work and one of them cooks lunch while the other gets tasked with the evening meal. Few times they decide preparing food is not worth the effort and the four of them convene in the kitchen to choose the delivery food for that occasion.
Steve stood in front of the mirror and adjusted his black hat over his blond hair. He nodded to himself when he was pleased with his appearance and, despite his initial reluctance, he started to grow excited at the idea of a fun, mindless game with his over-competitive friends.
Because the first time Tony tells Steve he loves him is also the day he calls him the love of his life.
Because Steve is right, they’ve been putting this off for way too long and it has caused it to fester, to rot and poison them slowly until all they can taste is their failures and the only way to act is by cutting away pieces of themselves and the other.
“Let’s not lose each other, okay?” Tony proposes and this makes Pepper laugh even as she sniffs and her eyes look unmistakably watery now that Tony’s own eyes have adjusted to the dark.
Tony sighs, resigned to the fact that Steve will push until he really does go to sleep, and throws his body down into the mattress, his legs still hanging from it.
Nowadays, he is able to remember perfectly everything that happens at night inside his head, better than he’s ever been to. Every morning when he wakes up the scenes are still reeling through his head and different moments and instances assault him throughout his day. Whispers of known voices, recognizable faces looking back at him, feelings that transport him back to illusory realities his state of rest creates.
She hesitates until Tony nudges her lightly with his knee through the blanket that covers him, trying to silently remind her this is an open space where she can speak her mind.
Tony’s still on his first serving of the Lemon Garlic Shrimp Pasta dish he has made himself while Steve has almost finished his second plate and is already thinking of going in for a third.
“I don’t want to fuck us up by letting this happen and then losing each other,” Tony explains, more to the point that he has been in the entire conversation. “If it doesn't work, if we get together and it doesn’t work… It could destroy us completely, it could make us lose each other.”
Now in December the few times in the last couple of weeks Tony has needed to venture into the City he has found himself astounded when he’s realized how little decorations and signs of Christmas there were around him. The streets look well into winter, a little snowed and a little grey, they still also show some devastation and unrecovered damage, but there is nothing to even suggest that a holiday as major as Christmas is quickly approaching.
“I was. Still am, maybe, a little bit,” Tony recognizes. “You were reckless and you acted on your own without any input from anyone else on the team. That’s something we need to discuss. But that’s not the root of the problem here.”
Tony opens his mouth to talk but he finds himself at a loss for words. There are so many things he wants to say to reassure Steve but they all taste hollow and insignificant in the face of Steve’s disclosure.
Tony doesn't always wake up before Steve, but when he does, he’s not ashamed to say he likes watching Steve sleep for a minute or so. The way Steve’s chest falls and rises, the way is mouth is always slightly open… It’s intimate in a way nothing else can be, not even exploring the inside of Steve’s mouth with his tongue.
“Sure,” he says as he places one of his hands on Steve’s bicep and squeezes gently, trying to reassure him. “Let’s go see her.”
Bruce puts the cap back on the water bottle and deposits it next to Tony. He then stands up, making Tony have to tilt his neck so he can continue to look at him. Bruce starts unbuttoning the first buttons of his shirt and once he’s undone three of them he takes his shirt off without unbuttoning the rest. He holds out his hand towards Tony, his shirt gripped loosely on his hand, and Tony moves to take it, dropping it on his lap.
“I’ll just be going and letting you go too,” Tony says as he moves from in front of Steve, clearing his path.
The two-month anniversary of the Decimation comes around and they do their best to ignore it as they work the day away but when Tony’s stomach rumbles and he starts feeling light on his feet -easier to happen now than before- they put everything aside and call Natasha to see if she wants to have dinner with them because maybe ignoring it while the three of them are together will be easier somehow, right?
The next hard-fought victory comes a couple of days later when Clint walks into the living room where the rest of them are watching a movie. The movie was chosen by Bruce, some animated thing Tony hasn’t been paying much attention to, more focused on his tablet and the email he’s been composing to the head of the PR department for the Maria Stark Foundation.
“You do realize that if we eat all of that we’ll end up puking our guts out all night, right?” Tony points out as Steve walks towards him and deposits the items on the kitchen table.
In the end, although Pepper never asked him for the Avengers and he never promised he’d be able to reunite them, the Avengers is what they have. All under the same roof. Not quite a team but still close enough to work together.
“It’s…” Tony tries to explain. “It’s weird. I feel sad, which I expected and I know is normal. But I also feel…I don’t want to say happy because that’s not true but…”
Natasha’s eyes sparkle as she nods at Tony’s words, knowing there’s going to be little resistance from Steve and Bruce if this is what she’s really committed to do.
As soon as he’s got both arms into the garment Tony grips the coat’s lapels and tugs so that it covers his chest and his neck properly, and then zips it up all the way to the top.
It’s been two years. Two years since Tony last saw Steve and the last time he saw him he just had lost a fight too.
“I didn’t mean to make this dinner so depressing,” she jokes, but there’s a hint of nervousness in her words. “You shouldn’t have to listen to me complain about this.”
Steve brings up a hand towards his own chest, pointing with his index finger to his chest as if baffled by Tony’s suggestion. Before Tony can laugh or maybe even coo at the ridiculous adorableness of the gesture, Steve seems to notice his slip, he coughs and brings his arm back down.
If Tony thinks about it he can’t remember them even having the conversation they were supposed to have when he came back from space, about her anger and her fears and his actions and his consequences.
to hear it. But every time there’s an opening, when an opportunity presents itself perfectly, Steve always deflects and it’s never even subtle.
Since the Decimation happened almost a month ago now -only one more day until they hit that painful anniversary- everyone that surrounds him has been submersed in trying to counteract what happened, in trying to fix the world, in putting on their hero suits and fighting the good fight one more time.
As Tony, Carol and Nebula are about to step of the ramp, resounding thumps can be heard, getting louder and louder, seemingly getting closer to them.
But the most important thing Steve has learnt throughout his life in regards to what other people think about him and what he then thinks of himself is that nothing matters to him most that what his loved ones see him as.
Clearing his throat, Tony withdraws the arm that was still placed on Steve’s back and scoots his body a little more to the left to create more space between his and Steve’s bodies just in time for Steve to straighten his back and turn around to face Tony.
“I used sex as an escape when I was younger,” Tony comments as the TV shows a group of hosts discussing Tony’s recent return and his past misgivings. “I could count on both hands the number of times I truly enjoyed it apart of when I was with Pepper.”
The suit is a work of genius, even Steve can tell, and his more sensitive side even sees it as a work of art.
For days after Tony feels guilty, worried about the way he phrased things, doubtful of whether he was in the right to push Thor like that. Tony knows better than most people what addiction can do to a person, what depression can make someone’s behaviors seem like to other people. There is a difference between making someone accountable for their actions and completely disregarding the nuisances their actions really entail.
When it seems like he’s thought things through and come to a conclusion he brings his hand to cup Tony’s on his cheek and, once again, he leans into the touch. He goes so far as to tilt his head to his right and closes his eyes once again.
The living room feels so empty it’s almost suffocating. The space could host dozens of people comfortably but only Bruce, Rhodey, Steve, Tony and Natasha herself are occupying it at the moment.
about your bad day, Tony,” Steve says, clenching his fists. “Which you haven’t even told me about, by the way. I just think after the day we’ve had it’s better this way.”
It’s having to live with the fact that, once again, Steve never gets to have the things that he wants most and what he would want most in the world right now is the opportunity to have Tony. For himself, yes, but also for Pepper and Rhodey, for the Avengers, and for the entire planet in itself.
Bruce sighs again and he rests his elbows on his knees, letting his face fall onto his hands. He’s not crying, but that might make it worse. There must be a thousand emotions Bruce is trying to keep contained and it kills Tony to know that that’s all Bruce’s been doing for years and years. His anger, his hurt, his confusion; these are all things Bruce’s become a master at hiding. Tony doesn’t want any of them to have to disguise themselves any longer and he doesn’t want any of them to have to go through things alone anymore.
As he wraps a towel around his waist he rubs the fingers of his right hand together, getting distracted by the weird and mesmerizing sensation of his wrinkled and mushy skin.
It makes things a lot more difficult for Tony. He’d rationally known Steve would realize something had changed sooner rather than later, but he hadn’t really counted on having to live with the guilt this brings him.
She gets serious before she says, “Don’t forget that SI is not only you Tony, it’s all of its people. These are good news for a lot of people. Hell, these might even be good news for the world as a whole.”
Steve is laying on the same manner that Tony is, their knees almost at the same height, one of his arms tucked under a pillow, the other on it, close to his face. He is close enough to Tony’s body than when Tony had been turned the other way they would have been almost -but not quite- spooning.
He looks younger, somehow, positioned like that. It’s like he’s trying make himself smaller, like he’s trying to hide from the world. Like he’s only a little boy scared of all that’s happened and all that’s to come.
“I am serious,” Steve confirms and Tony falls into the chair across from him, shaking his head. “I just gave people hope. I let them know the Avengers are still here for them. Are you telling me that’s not true?”
Maybe he shouldn’t find it surprising -not with how things have developed in the last couple of months in his life- but one day Steve wakes up and he realizes how easy sleep has started coming to him compared to how it used to be only a short while ago.
U and Butterfingers, on their part, couldn't be less interested in art but Steve still checks on their game of tag every once in a while from his position on the floor where his sketching in his own book.
Steve is telling him they’re in this -the grief, the pain, the new order of the world- together now.
It feels too close to giving up but Tony feels like he can't do it any longer. It’s just too much for him.
“Okay, so if I score now we’re tied, alright? But if I don’t that means you win,” Tony says. “Let’s see what happens.”
He spends the day with Natasha, Bruce and Steve and while it’s not a good day they do somehow make it better.
A soft silence follows this interaction but they’re both still looking at each other, both still sporting sad smiles on their faces.
Tony feels a light graze to his left hand where his arm hangs loosely over the center console. Without moving his head he redirects his gaze and watches as a blue hand grasps his own loosely, clumsily, as if this was a new invention never before seen in the world, as if this was the first time in all of the universe’s history two creatures have ever joined hands.
All eyes turned to him and Bucky mouthed, “Are you okay?” at him so only he could see him do it but Steve could only focus on the man, whose eyes were now caught in Steve’s.
Bruce dislodges Thor’s fingers from their grip on his shirt and moves backwards again. He seems resigned and angry all at once now but the first emotion seems to win out an internal battle in the end.
Bruce doesn't seem convinced despite Tony’s reassurances and although he moves his gaze back to Steve his eyes dart towards Tony a couple more times in just a few seconds.
While they all want to see Thor get better they’re afraid Bruce going to see him will actually have the opposite effect on Bruce. A simple glance shared between Steve, Natasha and Tony confirms they’re all sharing the same idea.
Tony was lightly bouncing on his feet and the subtle gesture denoted his own nerves too, which somehow relaxed Steve a little.  Maybe he wasn’t the only one feeling butterflies in his stomach.
Pepper fills the clean glass with wine and offers it to him. Steve takes it from her hand, still not understanding why Pepper brought him here.
“This has been building up for months,” Tony clarifies. “It hasn’t been like other times when the fights have gotten to be too much and we break up because we’re both fuming and desperate to not see each other. This time it was… Exhausting. We were speaking but we weren’t actually talking. We were engaged but we weren't actually planning the wedding. We were in this weird limbo. To be or not to be, that’s the question.”
Thor starts sitting up on the couch and although his eyes aren’t focusing on Tony he’s focusing his attention on him, Tony can tell.
Valkyrie is waiting there for them, perched on the arm of a loveseat, sipping at a bottle of beer she must have found on the refrigerator while holding a second one on her other hand.
“Yeah, well, time has granted me perspective and I know now that there are worse things that can happen to me than apologizing.”
As soon as Steve’s finished talking the workshop goes silent except for Tony’s respiration. It isn't really loud but Steve’s enhanced hearing focuses on it as a lifeline, noticing how regular it seems to be. Steve starts matching his breathing to Tony’s as a means to keep himself from freaking out and hyperventilating.
“I mean we can come to some kind of arrangement, Cap,” Tony proclaims. “You get them every first weekend of the month. I get them the odd numbered months. You take them on Christmas and I’ll have them on Thanksgiving. We switch off every Four of July because I don’t care if you’re Captain America that’s one of the funnest holidays.”
Sometimes Steve will sit next to his body, his legs stretched out before him as he sketches on his notebook. Sometimes Steve will gently coax him out of bed and move him to the couch in the living room, where Tony proceeds to lay down once again but this times surrounded by Steve, Natasha and Bruce too.
Today hasn’t been a bad day per se but Steve’s conscious enough about himself and his triggers to know that he’s heading towards some kind of episode of anxiety. Maybe a nightmare as he tries to sleep tonight o maybe a case of insomnia instead. It could also simply be not getting rid of the awkward feeling in his chest for a couple of days. Be what it may, Steve knows the longer he can stay here, where he feels truly safe and protected from everything else, the more he can avoid the fall.
Steve feels pleased with both the confirmation that Tony is indeed enjoying this as much as he is and the knowledge that no one -not even Tony himself- can make Tony feel as good as Steve does.
It’s easier for Tony to guess the amount of time Steve has been holding back these feelings and the answer is
If everyone in the room is now an open book, Thor is an uncrackable safe, the key to open it long lost to a sea of turmoil.
“Were you waiting up for me?” Steve asks, holding a paper bag with no logo in it in one of his hands. He walks towards the counter and deposits the bag there but makes no move to remove the contents from inside it.
“I can always leave now and just leave him behind. He’d have no choice but to stay,” Valkyrie offers matter-of-factly.
Steve scoffs and shakes his head, moving his jaw from right to left and then right again as if stretching it. Tony recognizes that move perfectly well, he used to be on the end of it a lot when he and Steve first met. Steve is mad. Steve is undeniably and irremediably mad.
He comes to a halt abruptly when he spots Valkyrie but he quickly seems to gather Thor is sitting on the couch and he won’t be able to see him unless he steps around it. He does so quickly and he places himself right in front of the spot where Thor is now incorporating himself. Tony can see Bruce’s fists tighten at his sides and his face closes off completely.
Once they’ve completely calmed down Steve moves his hands off of Tony’s hips only to bring them to his shoulders and slowly start instructing him to turn around without words. This brings them both eye to eye as soon as Tony tilts his head to look up at Steve. Their chests aren’t touching but they’re not a full inch apart.
Only a minute ago he wasn’t sure he was ready, or even wanted, to have the conversation, the one that has always seemed inevitable after everything that happened between them, but now, realizing Steve is not going to be starting it, Tony can’t help but feel like the world has snatched something precious away from him.
Tony is no longer hesitating and he’s now claiming Steve’s mouth as his own. His tongue is inside Steve’s mouth and it’s tangling with Steve’s own tongue, then running through the back of Steve’s teeth, then Tony’s moving back and caressing Steve’s lips with it, making everything feel sensual and passionate.
“Well, I had made plans for lunch with Clint and Natasha called him. When she found out we were together she decided today was the perfect day for the double date she’s been craving for for so long.”
Tony supposes he always knew Natasha would end up coming to him about it and it makes sense she’s doing it when Rhodey is here considering he’s the one most constantly working on the Ronin case, even if he’s doing it on behalf of his military work and not on a personal basis.
He wakes up gasping and panting and sometimes even crying. He wakes up wishing he had never gone to sleep and he wakes up wishing he had never woken up.
It’s all this noise filling his head and making it seem like there immensity of the ocean is between him and Steve, so much water distorting Steve’s image and making it difficult for them to understand what the other is saying.
“I don’t think there is a way we can reverse the snap,” Tony repeats for the second time that afternoon although the sentence has been rattling around in his brain a million times in the past hour.
Then, they’d moved to their next destination, Barcelona. And then Madrid followed by Lisbon. They spent a short and sunny day in Monaco before flying to Amsterdam and staying in a quaint boathouse for three days, so in love and full of Dutch pancakes it felt impossible to stop smiling even for just a second. They’d done day trips to Ghent and Brugge and Steve had believed himself to be transported to to a magical place walking through the latter.
But when Rhodey tells him, “Tones, man, I don’t need the perfect retelling of it. I just want to know what it was like for you.”
And then there’s the Steve that doesn't know Tony at all. The one still stuck clinging to things he can’t have and people he can never see. This is the Steve that believes he just feels like he is in love with Tony because he clung to him to avoid everything else he didn't want to deal with.
Steve nods. “I know and I’m grateful that you’re looking after me but I think I need to do this now. We’ve been—
So at first, based on the difficulty in locating Clint and the thought that his actions might had been a one-off, they’d mostly let things be, thinking he would seek them out when he felt ready again.
“Tony,” Steve calls again, his voice the same steady volume but this time a little more desperate sounding.
Bruce doesn’t appear to be suffering or hurting, he doesn’t even seem to be aware of any changes happening at all.
Tony had kind of stopped asking, and even so, here was Natasha with an answer for him: No. They would fail, because what things didn't fail in life? And, moreover, what things didn’t fail in life for Tony? And in the end, he would lose a lot more than what he’d temporarily gained. He’d lose all of Steve. Or if not all then most.
The stars blink back at him and Tony selfishly imagines they’re shining just for him and the thought shames him so much he has to rip his gaze away from them.
He could let Steve go now. Tell him he’s tired, that he wants to be alone, that they’ll see each other in the morning.
There have been stumbles and near misses. There’s been a process of relearning and reshaping themselves amongst each other. But the end result has been worth it all.
Pepper calls him the day Bruce tells him he will be able to move around freely again and tells him she believes it’s a good idea that he stays in the Compound.
He gets in a mood sometimes where he feels compelled to click on the folder and go through some of the pictures, revisiting instances of his life through the still images, letting himself admire them and the memories  of feelings they invisibly carry.
Steve hadn’t been too eager about it, as he was never too eager about dating in general, but Natasha had only told him, “You’ll thank me when you meet him.”
Tony throws his hands up and shakes his head, “I honestly have no idea, it was actually Natasha who clued me in, I hadn’t noticed it either. I just seem to do it a lot.”
Steve lets out a gasp when Tony’s right thumb accidentally grazes his nipple. Tony stilts his movements for a second before he brings his hands closer to Steve’s pecs and, this time deliberately, he flicks Steve’s nipples with his thumbs. Steve lowers his head, letting it hang between his shoulders, and he swears.
For a few weeks Tony’s days resemble what his life was like for so many years: long workshop hours, endless shareholders meetings that he has to fly back and forth for, e-mails with Pepper and the PR department and human resources and the R&D department… It’s hectic and it’s foreign, as if Tony’s body and mind have forgotten all he used to stand for.
They’re sad tears and happy tears and Tony’s mouth actually curls up in a soft smile despite it all. It must be mirror neurons or something because seeing Peter’s happy face in the photo compels him to smile back at the image.
Tony stands and starts walking towards the couch. Steve incorporates a little, keeping his back to the couch’s arm but bending his legs so they’re not taking the complete length of it.
and the three of them had ended the night trying to covertly wipe their tears away as they made their excuses to all go to their rooms.
“I don’t expect anything from you,” Steve promises. “I don’t need you to tell me you love me too because I understand it’s too soon. I also would understand if this changes things for you, if you’re not interested any longer in exploring anything between us. But Tony…”
Before they leave the workshop Steve makes sure to stop by the bots and bid them a goodnight. The bots all line up and get the closest thing that can resemble a hug for them from Steve.
When Tony finally sits the team -plus Pepper and Rhodey- down to tell them the full story Steve doesn't know if it is the first time Tony’s telling anyone what he went through those months everyone thought him dead. Perhaps that’s what SHIELD has had him doing, explaining everything over and over again.
Between the two of them they’ve eaten the entirety of the three pizzas Tony ordered but Steve knows it was mostly his doing.
Pepper tells him often he’s one of the kindest people she’s ever met. She normally says this after Steve has done something special that he thinks will brighten her day like brought her her favorite Starbucks drink to her office, sent her a funny puppy video he saw online or given her one of his most recent drawings.
But deep down he knows Steve is right and this won’t only be good for them, but for the people who get to see them. Like it or not they’re still symbols that the world follows and though there isn’t much he can do to help nowadays maybe this one small act will calm down the relentlessness inside him, that one voice that whispers he could be doing more.
Steve nods, acknowledging Tony’s response, but otherwise says nothing else. His body looks tense from Tony’s position and even though the lightning in the room is subtle Tony’s appraisal must be obvious to Steve, who fidgets under the scrutiny and crosses his arms. Tony stays silent as well, both because he stills feels the grip of darkness in his chest and because he wants Steve to be the one to break the tension.
That translates into Tony and Steve constantly strategizing how to resolve their problem, how to get Thor back home, while Bruce and Natasha are a little more free to get a little irrational about it, a little too deep into their emotions of the issue.
An enormous Tower for a house in the heart of Manhattan. Four teammates that he doesn’t really know. The CEO of one of the world’s biggest companies discussing publicity strategies and funding opportunities for his team with him.
“Nat, I’m sorry,” Steve says, getting up from the chair and sitting next to her. He places an arm around her shoulders even as she stays stiff in her place.
But since that night weeks ago Tony has been thinking and thinking and thinking about it and he still can’t wrap his mind around how little Steve had pushed back at him. Steve had stood stoically and silently and taken everything in, every one of Tony’s words and his jabs and his taunts and his hateful looks. And all he had said had been
But the image that Steve’s watching right now doesn't paralyze him because of the place it’s showing.  It’s who’s standing in it that’s left him speechless, because it’s not any of the Avengers, no matter how unusual that would have been.
“I know being a dick can be part of your trademark but you just went beyond what’s acceptable,” Natasha states as she points with her right hand at Clint.
If Tony had to describe Steve’s expression in a single term after his words that would be bewilderment. Which Tony can’t help but feel too at the thought that maybe Steve has never truly known -or believed, at least- any of the things Tony is telling him.
It’s like having Steve next to him actually helps him and makes things better. Who would have thought.
Tony and Steve looked at each other, searching for answers in the other’s eyes. After only a couple of seconds Tony turned back to the group to answer Clint, a small smile showing on his lips.
It reminds Tony of Rhodey’s own belief that he and Steve would be okay. It sends a shot of hope through his heart and Tony’s throat clogs up. There are still a thousand voices -Rhodey and Natasha and so many other; even his own too- and a thousand doubts and a thousand feelings.
And as a finale Steve finds himself standing in the balcony of their booked Roman apartment looking at the Coliseum, lights turned on for the night, the moon high in the sky looking over it and protecting it.
“I came to say I’m sorry about how our lunch went the other day,” Steve says as he rests his elbows on the table. “I had been looking forward to it.”
They stay like that, then, for several minutes. Just two men sharing a space but being farther apart that they have been in months. It’s heartbreaking for Tony, and he logically knows it must be pretty painful for Steve too. His own wounds left him unable to recognize pain in Steve last night but this morning, in the light of day, it’s easy to recognize it.
They haven’t had sex yet but it’s not because they've been avoiding it. More than once Tony has seen the heat reflected in Steve’s eyes, a heat so similar to the one he feels burning up his insides. He’s seen it during drawn out make-out sessions where both of them haven’t even lost an article of clothing. He’s seen it after getting out of the shower and walking out into his room with only a towel around his waist. He’s seen it when they’ve both been driving aimlessly around New York state, Steve in the passenger seat with his eyes permanently fixed on Tony.
Pepper uses him as an excuse to bow out of the party early and takes him to a hamburger joint in the middle of Harlem that only serves two types of burgers but over twenty-five types of milkshakes.
Steve hated being a leader when he lost Bucky because it wasn’t just his fault as his best friend but also as his commanding officer. He hated having to be the one always making the sacrifice when he put the plane down into the ice. He hated still being viewed as Captain America when he woke up 70 odd years into the future and people still looked at him for guidance.
Tony’s delighted face changes with Rhodey’s comment, though, and it transforms into an expression of genuine offense. Even so, Steve can still see the glint in Tony’s eyes, clear indication that he’s enjoying the bantering with Rhodey to its fullest extent.
He knows these are the kind of things both of them have been working through in their respective therapeutic journeys.
Steve bites his lip and feels almost guilty for having forgotten to make this as good for Tony as it is for him at the moment.
Steve applies more pressure after a few seconds, his lips finally completely in contact with Tony’s.  He opens his mouth enough to taste Tony’s lips and he thinks he maybe should be feeling a little more grossed out seeing as how they only finished eating a few minutes ago and he can taste almost perfectly what was the last slice of pizza Tony had.
Rhodey stays silent as he takes one more spoonful of cookie dough. He doesn’t say a word but his gaze is loud enough for Tony to hear.
“Right here,” Steve answers as he uses his upper-body strength to elevate his torso and reach Tony’s face with his own.
Tentatively, and almost shyly, Tony starts moving his right hand across the mattress, trying to find Pepper’s hand. At first he gently bumps against her shoulder but she must guess his intentions because she immediately reaches over with her hand to grab his.
“This is the best thing I have ever seen in my thousands of years of live,” Thor proclaims, looking  brighter than he has since he came into the Compound and making Bruce snort at the comment.
Rhodey had caught them all up in the situation; shown them the reports and the footage, the images and the theories, but it’s still a little hard to wrap their heads around.
Once upon a time he would have been embarrassed to confess it but it matters very little at all in this moment.
It was cold outside and Steve looked at Tony, who looked back at him when he felt watched. Steve blushed at being caught staring but he didn’t pull his gaze away.
It sometimes feels even more difficult that when he first started having to deal with them. Back then the fear of dying was still because of his lack of understanding. Nowadays the fear of dying comes
“I’m not sure anything I can say today can do justice to what happened a year ago.” Steve’s voice is firm but Tony can hear perfectly well the affliction in it, the tightness around his words. “None of us have been the same since Thanos and I don’t think any of us will ever be. I wish I didn’t have to be here today giving this speech, I’d give anything for things to go back to the way they were. But although I wish this wasn’t necessary I’m here today because I want to remind everyone of a very important thing: we haven’t forgotten. The Avengers haven’t forgotten.”
The correct answer would be that it’s not an issue of time anymore, at least not for them. They’ve got time because, against all odds, they were amongst the survivors. While other people -people that probably believed they had their whole lives ahead of them- ran out of time they’re still here minute after minute and time is a commodity they can’t take for granted.
Tony swallows, even though his mouth feels droughty, and the sound is incredibly loud in the stillness of the cockpit.
They love each other. They've loved each other for a while. They’ll love each other tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that.
Bruce swallows the long sip of water he had taken before responding. “The experiment is a little personal. Maybe a little unorthodox.”
“I mean it.” He says, depositing a kiss on Tony’s shoulder over fabric. “I hadn’t noticed before, but I like the idea of you wearing my clothes.”
“I miss my Ma’s cooking,” Steve confesses back. “We never had much but she could create delicacies with anything you gave her.”
When he reaches Tony, Steve positions himself behind him, his arms extending to place his hands on the edge of the table, gently trapping Tony between the table and his body.
“I would have hated to really hurt such a lovely face.” Never let it be said that Steve didn’t try his hardest even when he knew he was not good at things (and he knew he was really not good at flirting).
Steve fills the liquid go down the wrong pipe and he starts coughing vehemently, his eyes filling up with tears of discomfort.
Tony closes his mouth and doesn’t say a word but he knows he’s admitting it by not saying anything at all.
Tony hadn’t noticed but in his worry he had been trying to get up from the bed and Rhodey is now lightly pressing his shoulder back into the pillows as he shushes him to try and calm his breathing that has gone erratic.
The screen of his phone goes black as Steve stares at it and when he presses the home button the image of his lock screen appears on it. It’s a picture of Tony, as it has been since the very first day they started dating. This one is relatively new, though. Steve took it a couple of weeks ago during Natasha’s birthday party at the Tower. Tony is smiling and looking at someone off-screen and he looks so radiant that every time Steve sees the picture a wave of warmth spreads from the top of his head to the tip of his toes.
He should be feeling calmer now that he’s made sure the storm isn't as severe as it could have been but he still feels unexplainably uneasy. Twitchy, slightly out of control.
Tony, in a real show of maturity, sticks his tongue out, prompting a scoff from Natasha, still drinking slowly from her filled cup. Tony debates the risks of stealing the cup for himself but decides against it because a) he values his life, and b) Natasha likes her coffee overly sweet, more sugar than actual liquid.
Such a short sentence can have so many different meanings, Tony knows, and he’s got a feeling that Steve is more than aware as well of the ambiguousness of his statement. The words are said rather solemnly and a little abruptly after the silence that had accompanied them before.
Steve continues on his path to the kitchen and lets the happiness fill his lungs up completely as he takes his next breath.
When Steve first came out of the ice he made his peace with knowing things that he had dreamt about before would no longer be in his future. Love was one of them. Who could he find that would understand everything that he had gone through? Who could he find that he could put through the difficulties of who he was?
The minutes pass but Tony’s immune to them, completely disconnected from the passage of time and its meaning.
It’s perhaps the only thing keeping both of them whole and Tony isn’t going to begrudge himself of the relative peace that sharing this with Steve brings him. He also won’t take it away from Steve.
Steve’s eyebrows raise but the expression on his face is still defiant. He stays silent and Tony knows it’s because Steve wants him to go on and he won’t be making the situation any easier on him.
As he and Pepper start walking towards Tony’s room Natasha and Steve head towards the sliding doors in the living room and they step outside to take a walk around the property. As he turns around to close the door, Steve’s eyes catch Tony’s. It’s only for a second but it’s enough to give Tony the bout of strength he needs.
“I didn't lie,” Steve remarks resolutely. His right fist hits the wood table emphasizing his point but Tony doesn’t startle.
He’s learnt not to blame himself for all the weeks, months and years he let pass before he fully embraced all the aspects of his existence and accepted the enveloping happiness that he now has and would never in a million years let go of.
It’s easier than breathing. Easier than trying to take a deep breath while he’s crying because his father has hit him once again. Easier than trying to make his lungs work as Jarvis’ coffin is lowered to the ground. Easier than trying to gulp down air as they pour water on a towel placed over his head in a desolate cave. Easier than pushing air through the reactor placed in his chest.
Between his worry and his nerves the thing that brings Tony into the fold is Steve’s voice sounding concerned and maybe even a little anxious.
Well into the evening of the day Thor had left the Compound they had ran out of things to comfortably talk about, TV programs to flip through or newspaper articles to read and discuss.
Tony nods and he goes back to his tablet where he’s been doodling aimlessly since a headache started building up behind his eyes after reading too much on it.
“Oh,” Pepper chuckles lightly and brings her right hand to his back, rubbing a comforting circle on it instead of patting it.
“I… I’m really sorry.” Steve’s voice was shaky and low. He truly didn’t know what to say but he did know he needed to apologize and make sure the man knew it had been an accident. “Really, I am. Sorry. Very sorry. I’m very sorry.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Bruce says, rolling his eyes and giving up on getting his glasses back. “Laugh it up, asshole.”
They’re all in the living room, this time Clint included, and Natasha has been trying to explain for the past twenty minutes the necessity of a hearing for Clint’s case.
Steve glares at him and Tony rolls his eyes even though the comment might have been a bit too callous.
It’s dark, it’s cold and it’s wet. It could just as well be the cave in Afghanistan but Tony knows it isn’t. He knows the cave in Afghanistan like the back of his hand, like a piece of his own soul, both from the dragging months he spent there and from the revisiting he has done in his imagination throughout the later years. This isn’t the cave in Afghanistan, it’s the bottom of the ocean. And it’s swallowing him whole.
Tony still looks shocked and Steve feels his world shattering at the idea of Tony pulling away from him now that's Steve’s got him so close.
“Maybe this isn’t the best time but… I never asked you,” Steve says, hesitantly. “How did you two know each other?”
As soon as his eyes become accustomed again to the lightning in the room Tony follows the sounds of Steve’s distress with the movement of his eyes, landing on Steve’s hunched body to the left of his bed, occupying the same chair Pepper had made hers before.
Steve has never believed in fate or destiny but he now wonders if maybe there was something inside him that always knew Tony would come back to take his place next to Steve. If maybe he was unconsciously waiting for things to become what they were always meant to be.)
Steve’s hands leave Tony’s shoulders by running down his arms. The touch is light but Tony can still feel it through his long-sleeved t-shirt. It only takes a few seconds for Steve’s hands to reach Tony’s and he takes them in his gently. Steve’s thimbles start rubbing circles in the back of Tony’s hands and Steve’s eyes are focused intensely on the motion.
He exits the elevator on the communal floor and the first thing he hears is the soft hum of the television in the background. He pauses in the hallway and looking up in the direction of the ceiling -although he’s been told time and time again it isn’t necessary- he calls for JARVIS.
Tony starts nodding eagerly and he makes sure to make eye contact through his tears with Steve’s own gaze.
There are so many things she’s responsible for, so much on her plate, that Tony has worried before about it being too much for her. Both him and Steve have tried to talk to her, to let her know she doesn't need to carry all this burden, but she’s nodded along to whatever they said each time just to go back to doing it the next day.
And he can see that confirmed in the misty look in her eyes as her gaze takes in all of Tony’s body laying in bed and she lets out a relieved breath, like she couldn’t quite believe he was alright until she saw it with her own eyes.
It isn’t perfect and it never will be. But contrary to what Tony believed when he was a child that loved to imagine what his life would have been like if he hadn't been born a Stark, no family is perfect. He’s learning, slowly and with some difficulties, that he wouldn’t give up his imperfectness for anyone else’s, though.
Steve only looks up when he notices the silence that has settled over the room, and he realizes Tony must have asked JARVIS to turn the music off without Steve even hearing him speak.
There is no response for a few seconds but then Natasha appears from the left of the room, where Tony knows her en-suite bathroom is located.
Tony can feel the hesitancy and he knows that Steve’s sentence wasn’t meant to finish there. He also knows what Steve was about to say.
“And we can also work every day to make sure that if we have to end we don't destroy us,” Steve pledges. “I won’t let you lose me, Tony. And I won’t let myself lose you, either.”
Tony pauses in his speech and looks away towards his bots, then focuses his gaze on his workbench and then looks down at his hands.
Nothing seems to happen as Steve tugs the fabric up, obliging Tony to put his arms in the air and let the other man rid him of the item. Tony frowns and stares intently at Steve until the man must feel his gaze and looks him directly in the eye.
It’s Tony creating playlists for him for different moods and situations: a playlist for the gym, a playlist for when he showers, a playlist for when he’s feeling nostalgic, a playlist that only includes songs with a color in the title because Steve bet Tony he wouldn't be able to find twenty different songs for twenty different colors -Steve loses the bet-.
“That’s great,” Tony proclaims. “It does deserve a celebration. You could have brought some champagne or something, Brucie Bear. The planning here has got some holes.”
Steve, who -by his own confession- has never been one to cook, has taken to learning from anyone and anywhere and anything he can. Bruce is of great help to him and when cooking is done by the both of them together it normally involves some kind of foreign dish that Bruce fell in love with during one of his travels. Moroccan cuisine. Indian spices. Peruvian roasts. Tony knows he’s more well-travelled than 90% of the population in the world but he’s never felt as connected with other cultures as Bruce has always made sure to be.
His eyes stay focused on the ceiling, though, because every bit of courage he has left doesn’t actually amount to that much courage anymore.
He goes through the motions of getting dressed while his mind is still fixed on the words. He walks towards his office while his mind analyzes every single aspect of the words. He spends the entire video-conference distracted, a part of his brain constantly coming back to
“Clint’s whole family got snapped. Laura, the kids… They’re all gone and we can’t find him. We know he’s alive but we can’t find him.”
“I am—,” Pepper starts and then stops, like she’s trying to find the perfect words, as if there even were perfect words to be used. “I am so happy that you’re back, Tony. The relief I felt in my chest when I saw you step down that ship… I’ll always be grateful for that.”
He starts by telling him how Nebula knew where her father could be found and how everyone decided to suit up and go after him.
“I know how to operate this thing and I’m honored Tony thought of me to wear it but…” Rhodey swallows heavily. “It’s not me in the way Iron Man was Tony.”
It’s easy in a way few things have been lately and Steve feels warmth growing in his chest as the night goes by.
But in the end he knows the truth and the truth is he feels a little afraid. A little apprehensive. It’s only after he remembers the exact tone of voice Miss Potts used when she said please to him that he picks up his cellphone provided by SHIELD and dials the number printed on the card she gave him.
As soon as Tony puts down that little boy he gets surrounded by a handful of other children all grappling for his attention.
He makes the decision in a split second and he doesn’t take even a millisecond to think if it’s a good idea or not.
Pepper hugs both Natasha and Steve, and Steve timidly whispers an “I hope to see you soon” as Pepper is pulling away from his embrace. She places a delicate hand on his cheek and simply answers, “Of course”.
Rhode scoffs. “That would be my line if we ever did play paintball. If we were on separate teams you’d be ganging up on me and I just know it. And it’d be worst if you were on my team. I trust you as far as I can throw you with these things.”
He moves his eyes to the screen for a second and indeed, the last of the credits are just rolling upwards, leaving the screen completely black.
“Miss Potts. Pepper,” he corrects himself. “I don’t know how much there is of the team, of the Avengers. Barton and Romanoff work for SHIELD as I do but we don’t really work together. Thor’s off world as far as I know and Banner… I think he’s gone back to India. Or to some other place far away from here. It’s not like he told me.”
Steve Rogers has been, is and will be many things throughout his entire existence: a leader, a soldier, a man out of time, an Avenger, a friend, an stubborn fighter, a science experiment, a hero, a lover, a talented artist, a simple man.
And then, everything had vanished as Tony had opened his eyes and caught the first glimpse of sunlight that morning.
Steve gives him a lopsided smile. “You’re in luck. I’ve got a fast recovery period and with you looking like this I can’t imagine it’ll take me long to get it going again.”
When FRIDAY’s voice pulls him away from his sleep Tony grumbles and turns over to his stomach, pressing his face into the pillow.
He’s learnt not to blame himself for the part of him that to this day, so many years later, still sometimes clings to parts of the past, embellishing them, probably remembering them in a much more golden and optimistic light than what they truly were.
He’s been told it’s because he inspires people, moves them to action and ignites a flame in them. Sometimes he thinks it’s because people are trying to impress him, because they think causing a good impression in Captain America will give them points in life. Other times he thinks it’s because people are maybe afraid of him, that they’re terrified if they don’t meet the standards they believe Captain America has he will retaliate against them.
Tony is holding a mug full of one of Bruce’s favorite teas when Steve walks into the kitchen, steam still rising from the hot liquid. His eyes are lost on some faraway point, as is his mind, and he only realizes Steve has arrived when the man taps him on the shoulder to greet him.
“Sir suffered from nightmares and even often flashbacks, and together we created some protocols and routines that worked well for him during the worst of them.”
“I mean, normal things are going on. We’re close, we’ve become close, you know that. Normal close. Like best friends. Not you and I level of best friends because that’s sacred but best friends,” Tony blabbers and he curses himself silently the more he says  without meaning to.
“I want to apologize again.” Steve insisted. “I am so sorry about the hit and I hope it really didn’t hurt.”
Steve’s birthday goes by without much fanfare, only Natasha, Bruce, Tony and the birthday boy himself celebrating it together by having a fancier than usual lunch at the Compound. Steve had decided weeks before that he didn't want to do anything special and he had booked an appointment with his therapist for the evening, anticipating the heaviness and weariness of the day.
Space also makes him finally admit -at least to himself in the safety of his own mind- every one of his regrets about Steve. He moves between the regret of having trusted him and the regret of not having contacted him. The regret of having met him and the regret of not having been able to say goodbye.
Pepper’s also one of the most supportive people Steve’s ever had about his art and she never fails to comment on his talent and the beauty of his creations. She has some of Steve’s pictures framed and on display in her office and she’s helped him show some of his art anonymously in small, inconspicuous galleries.
Natasha’s eyes move from his head to his feet, one time and then another. She clicks her tongue and smirks.
He makes it to the common floor in less than a minute and he heads directly to the living room, his legs feeling like they’re going to fail him at any second.
“Never.” Steve proclaims, moving Tony around effortlessly and positioning himself above him. “Not until you admit you look good in my clothes.”
She sometimes shows Steve gifts Tony gave her and the look in her eyes is proof enough of how valuable sentimentally they all are to her.
His left hand grabs Steve’s right one and before Steve’s expression can even change back from the worry so clearly drawn there, Tony slams the reactor harshly against Steve’s hand.
He takes a short shower, getting rid of the sweat and feel of sex, and gets dressed quickly, uncaring of whose clothes he takes this morning. Steve had genuinely been out of the loop about the clothes’ dilemma, but if the spark in his eyes when he found out proved anything, Steve doesn’t really care that much about the natural way in which Tony has taken claim of his clothes.
“I wasn’t the most supportive person in the world when Tony became Iron Man,” she starts explaining. “We were just beginning to explore our feelings for each other and I was so worried all the time about him, about what he was doing… I was constantly thinking of how I would lose him and how selfish he was for making me feel that afraid.”
2AM is when the frustration starts as he begins to twist and turn, feeling constricted by the sheets and oppressed by the eluding nature of his rest. The anxiety starts in his brain but it quickly travels to his chest, specifically his lungs. They burn and ache and clench, refusing to accept the air Tony is working hard on breathing.  2AM is the darkness of the night, the monster that finds you outside of nightmares.
Natasha is not subtle when she rolls her eyes at him and it painfully reminds him of days and nights spent at the Tower before the whole ordeal with Ultron happened, when one of the guys would do something extremely loud, boisterous or reckless and Natasha would reprimand them with a simple,
That day it is very obvious there are two separate groups within them: there’s Pepper, Rhodey and Tony; and then there’s Pepper, Rhodey and Steve. Both groups have their own idiosyncrasy down, even if they’re a little out of sync, but most of the awkwardness originates from trying to mesh the groups, trying to make them work and blend until there’s only one.
He’s under no delusions of this being a reversible thing and it’s not even like it’s something he’s hoping for. This is permanent and this is what he wants, truly, but this being permanent means this is what he’ll have to learn to live with. Pepper and their relationship was the one thing he had been able to hold on to after the snap and now even that is gone.
It’s a losing battle and he forgets to breathe. There’s air in his lungs but he swears he forgets to breathe.
Suddenly, a laugh brought Steve out of his appreciation of the man. He reluctantly removed his eyes from the incredibly beautiful man and realized that he had not been alone. Steve was perplexed when he recognized Clint next to the man.
Steve releases a huff of air that is not really a chuckle but denotes certain amusement at the reference.
Steve and him haven’t spoken a word to each other in a little over four weeks and the idea of having to face him makes Tony weak at the knees, even in his position lying in bed.
“Sir is in the living room, Captain Rogers. The rest of the Avengers are in their respective rooms,” JARVIS answers.
Tony, who Steve believes he could have become really good friends with. After all, Tony’s own best friends are now Steve’s closest friends in the 21st century.
No one could be more shocked than him to find that, now that the time has actually come, he actually feels grateful and happy he’s made it.
Tony wasn’t surprised when he heard Steve say I love you before, and Steve isn’t surprised to hear Tony say it now.
Peter starts walking and Tony follows, always two or three steps behind. He tries to run but his legs won’t obey him, and all he can do is just walk and look at Peter’s back. They walk for miles and miles but Tony doesn’t tire and neither does Peter. They walk for hours and no matter how much Tony tries his arm can’t reach Peter.
Their bodies and minds are not ready to separate yet, not after so long apart, not after the connection they’ve just reached. It’s good for them that they’ve got nowhere else to be for a while.
You show up, you give it your all, you sweat and bleed and bruise, you hit and get hit, you punch and get punched, you try to look for a way out and, when the plan fails, you re-write the strategy.
They get up together, even though Steve could stay in bed as long as he truly wanted to. They share breakfast as they talk about anything and nothing, just like they have done so many other mornings. Steve gets up from the table to refill Tony’s coffee as Tony peels an apple for Steve, who absolutely hates eating apples with their skin, for some reason.
Today, as they start walking in a direction now awfully familiar for both, Tony knows what Steve wants to talk about.
Getting to his room is an uphill battle. It’s like having to climb Mount Everest while carrying all the bodies of the people he’s had to watch die on his back. Jarvis, who he has been missing for so many years. JARVIS, who he never in a million years thought he would have to mourn one day. His mom, both the caring and the detached parts of her. Yinsen, and even Yinsen’s family despite the fact that he never knew them. Peter.
“So yeah, there is something building between us,” Tony confirms. “I know it’s there and, even though we haven’t talked about it ,I know Steve knows it too. But I don’t what I’ll do about it.”
“Everything’s perfect,” Steve assures him, bringing his hands to the back of Tony’s thighs and tugging softly so the man has to place himself over Steve’s lap, straddling him.
If Rhodey or Bruce were here with him Tony would be trying to make light of the situation by making a joke. Maybe a “It’s show time” comment or a big show of rolling his eyes obnoxiously. Hell, if it wasn't Steve who Tony had to confront in just a few seconds
There would have been a time when Steve would have hesitated before sending the text, a time when he would have grown mad with doubt, not knowing if Tony felt the same deep desire as him, questioning constantly if Tony too felt empty inside when they weren’t touching. Now, he and Tony know each other inside and out. Now, there is never a moment of doubt about Tony’s feelings for Steve and his investment in their relationship.
They make love twice and Tony’s not sure how to explain that the first time felt like a farewell and the second time felt like coming back home.
Tony finds it amusing but if there’s one thing he has learnt from his time aboard the ship this past twenty-something days is that laughing at Nebula for whatever reason would be a terrible idea.
They bond greatly over art, something Pepper is very well-versed in and something Steve hasn’t been able to focus on in a very long time. He tells her about the time when he dreamt he would maybe dedicate his life to it, go to art school in Brooklyn and soak in all the knowledge he could. She takes him to museums and little art galleries very few people seem to know of but she donates to often. She encourages him when he tells her he’s thinking of signing up to some courses and hugs him when he gifts her a portrait of her for her birthday.
Steve’s head is lowered and placed between his knees, both of his elbows resting on his knees, his hands behind his head, one of them gripping his hair so tightly Tony’s actually afraid he’ll rip some of it out.
Tony coughs as Steve is still looking around the room, both to soothe his dry throat and to try and alleviate the tension that he can feel already building up between them, before Steve has even made eye contact with him again.
“I wanted to do that,” Tony says, pointing to Steve’s dick, now soft and hanging out of Steve’s underwear that he never even got around to taking off.
There are a few kinks and mishaps that Steve’s made sure to take note of to work on them in their next meetings and trainings, but having Tony with them really feels like it changes the stakes completely.
Bruce seems to be deep in thought for a few seconds as they all look at him. He’s been the one pushing the hardest for this to happen and he seems the closest to Thor out of everyone, no matter how little Tony knows about how that happened. It seems fair to defer to him in this matter but it also means it makes everyone feel more lost when he hesitates or doubts the options they have.
Steve feels tired and weary and his first instinct is to turn down the invitation. Pepper is always nice to him but they’re not really friends either, and he hasn’t seen Colonel Rhodes since Tony’s funeral happened. The idea of spending an evening with them having to make polite small talk feels daunting and he doesn’t think he would be able to handle it even on a normal day.
It’s only after he stops being able to watch Pepper go through the glass walls of the room that he realizes he wasn’t the one who told her about Peter and that that was the first kiss they had shared in over three weeks.
The twenty-first century and Tony are so thoroughly intertwined in Steve’s mind that he can’t think of one without thinking of the other and it has to do in part with how so many of his new memories have Tony at the center of them and how many of the world’s new wonders have been introduced to him by Tony.
Bruce must read Tony’s hesitation and carried-on guilt on his face because he suddenly clarifies, “I promise it isn't something bad. It is something I maybe should have worked on a long time ago or maybe something that was only meant to happen this way. It is—“
10 seconds go by, and then 15, and then maybe 20, and Tony and Pepper are still looking into each other’s eyes. No words are exchanged but after so many years they don’t need them anymore to have a conversation.
He’s helped Pepper and Steve during many Avengers’ business meetings. He’s researched many pop culture phenomena to point Steve into the direction of what he believes Steve will enjoy. He’s proven himself useful time and time again reminding Steve of little and big stuff all the time.
Therapy twice a week on his own is already hard enough, raw in ways he’s not sure he’d be able to explain. It drains him of energy while at the same time filling him up with hope. It kills him over and over again, only to bring him back to life. Sharing all that with a group of strangers that have their own crosses to bear… It sounds terrifying.
“Gorgeous, funny, reckless, with a little bit of an attitude, for what I hear you weren’t afraid to call him out when you met and your stubbornness would have balanced out his own stubbornness well.”
In a very quick maneuver Steve stood up from his crouched position and aimed his big and compact snowball towards Sam.
“Steve,” Tony murmurs, so low he thinks maybe even Steve can’t hear it with his enhanced sense of hearing.
There’s no hesitation in Rhodey’s stride as he makes his way towards his bed and grabs his hand. Their fingers intertwine.
Tony looks around the room at his friends -at his family- and he feels their grief and their regret mixing with his as strongly as if it was all just his.
“Three hours?” The beat fastens. “Four?” His friend doesn’t stop and Tony can feel in his bones the moment she completely wins the battle. “Fine, fine! I’ll go to sleep and I won’t wake up until the next giant octopus attack. Happy?”
“Yeah!” Bucky’s voice sounded excited, almost childlike. Steve smiled as he put on the sweater and grabbed his black gloves from the bed side table. “You and I, Stevie, we’re gonna kick Natasha’s and Wilson’s asses.”
It seems like now that Steve has started speaking he can’t stop himself from pouring it all out and Tony relinquishes in the downpour and works hard on not missing even a single comma.
“But Toooooony.” Natasha mocks, arms crossed in front of her chest, her body positioned to block the pathway to the coffee maker. “Clint is my best friend, Stark. You have nothing on him when it comes to being persistent and believe me, I never cave.”
But Tony’s excited to take him to a little Thai place Steve had heard of from Pepper but that he’s actually never gotten the change to go to.
Tony sits on a decorative wooden trunk that’s at the feet of Natasha’s bed, but angles his body so he can look at her properly. She takes a seat on her bed, her back against the bed frame and her legs criss-crossed. Steve drags the chair from her desk over to the side of the bed, leaving it right between Tony and Natasha.
Tony Stark may not be alive but Pepper Potts and James Rhodes are making sure that his memory never dies.
“Tony,” Steve grunts, bucking his hips against Tony’s with force, his cock bumping right into Tony’s.
Tony closes the door again and he turns his back on it, resting against it for a second as he takes a calming breath.
Tony’s 48th birthday keeps passing and by seven o’clock at night Tony keeps believing there’s a party he doesn’t even want to attend happening in his honor.
It’s Pepper opening up about her stress with Stark Industries and Tony just listening to her, knowing all she needs in order to feel better is for him to be there as she vents. It’s Tony looking at her in wonder when she jokes around with him just as she’s always done, him wondering how he ever got lucky enough that she decided to give him her time.
The declaration surprises Tony, who feels the walls of the room closing in on them both. Steve hasn’t slept in his room since Tony and him started dating. Most of his clothes are still in his own closets, but a lot of his everyday stuff has migrated to Tony’s room and his ensuite bathroom, where Steve’s toothbrush, comb and skincare products now sit proudly amongst Tony’s.
In his haste to escape his room Tony forgot to take his robe with him but he feels okay in just his old-ratty t-shirt -that might have belonged to Rhodey long ago- and the pair of boxers he’s wearing.
If he wasn’t so taken back by Miss Potts’ request he would have maybe found a way to not make the question sound so abrupt or even violent but Miss Potts doesn't seem to mind. She shrugs delicately and, once again, shares a look with Rhodes.
Glancing up from his plate Tony sees Steve’s face set into an expression of worry, his forehead and eyebrows fixed into a frown. Natasha is biting her bottom lip and her wide eyes are firmly set on Bruce, who in turn, is reclined back into his chair, his glass in hand, very obviously trying to portray an air of nonchalance that doesn't fit him well.
And yet, talking about himself had Steve closing off, pulling away and hiding himself away from Tony. Hiding his face, his reactions, himself. It had him literally running away the minute something came spilling out of him in the kitchen.
“The drinks and napkins, Cap,” Tony reminds him over his shoulder as the elevator’s door opens, showing a SI security guard with their pizzas in hand.
Any small trace of contentment and good humor Tony had woken up with completely washes away as FRIDAY names Steve.
Steve nods in confirmation and Tony has to close his eyes for a second. He moves his hand away from Steve’s face and uses it to rub at his temples while he cracks the knuckles of his other hand.
And then, Steve had sought him out at what had probably been one of the lowest points in his life, if not the lowest. He had gone to Tony and he had put his very soul in Tony’s hands and he had stripped himself bare, had laid down his armor and just cried, cried enough for both of them while clinging to Tony.
It’s family because no other people would make him and Steve as secure in each other as them. There’s no other people that would make Tony feel comfortable enough to fall asleep cuddled up to Steve in front of them. There’s no other people Steve or him would let see them at their most vulnerable with each other.
They’re outdoors and yet if feels like Steve’s words are sucking the air out of the world. No one seems to be breathing, too enthralled and connected to Steve to do anything but hang to his every word. For Tony it’s always felt like Steve can command a room simply by walking into it so it’s no surprise that everyone else feels like that too.
They’re all sitting around Tony’s living room table, at the Tower’s penthouse that had been previously been left unoccupied during all those months they believed Tony to be dead. Tony and Steve are on one side and Pepper and Rhodey on the other.
Tony bites his lip for a second and then lets go of it gently and he finally allows a smile to take over his face, giving up on trying to hold it back anymore.
And because he is the leader he makes the call, the one no one wants to make but they all know is necessary.
Tony can’t tell how long they spend in that same position, forehead against forehead, bodies posed together, their hands clasped and resting on Tony’s chest. It feels like minutes and it feels like eons but in no moment does it ever become uncomfortable.
The most mundane and trivial things become exciting and life-changing when you’re in love, and this is something Steve has learnt in the past three years thanks to his relationship with Tony.
1AM greets him as his eyes roam the ceiling above him, boring and dull but the only think he can keep his attention on. That’s probably the worst part about it. Sleep eludes him but wakefulness does too. 1AM means he’s somewhere in-between asleep and awake, some gray area of conscience where he can’t think clearly but he can’t turn off his brain.
He doesn’t know about Happy, and Bruce, and Natasha, and Hill, and Fury. He doesn’t know if Thor ever made it to Earth alive. And what about Clint, and Sam, and Wanda? He doesn’t know about anyone in the world right now.
“You and me. Natasha, Bruce, Thor, Clint. The Avengers, we’re still here. What if that means something?”
Steve and Tony start dating on a lovely April night, even though they’re not outside to actually enjoy the warm weather.
It’s not even ten at night yet so Tony knows it’s futile to really try to fall asleep but he closes his eyes as Pepper gently whispers, “FRIDAY, lights out”.
He mustn’t do a very good job at hiding his discomfort for long because the conversation completely changes when Pepper steals a glance at him.
“But I do know that if Pepper and I have to end up with someone, it can’t be with each other. We love each other, I don’t know if it’s in the same
Both of them note his presence and Steve catches how Rhodes stands a little taller upon seeing him. Steve salutes him almost immediately, like an instinct, even though he’s not in his own uniform and he doesn’t really feel it in his heart. Colonel Rhodes salutes him back.
Iron Man was one of Earth’s greatest defenders right until the end and maybe that does make Stark something other than a soldier, even something other than a hero. Maybe it makes him immortal in a way, with the way people are making sure to honor him and never forget his sacrifice.
Rhodey had been the one to finally find him the first time and he’d been able to solidly connect him to the spike of druglords and other criminals’ deaths, in the end.
“I don’t really want to have a party,” Tony confesses, his voice a whisper. He almost sounds guilty about it.
“She’s really excited about this, guys.” Clint commented while delicately hip checking his girlfriend, who didn’t look remorseful or ashamed. “She’s been planning it for months so you better not let her down.”
But if Tony and Steve thought that Bruce’s and Natasha’s comeback would be more relaxed than how the day started they were both dead wrong. Natasha’s first steps back into the Compound are nothing short of the march of a soldier walking into war. Bruce’s first steps back into the Compound are nothing short of those of a defeated soldier making his way back home after a lost battle.
They’re not putting on a show for anyone, they’re not posing in front of the world, it’s a photo just for their eyes. Actually, it’s a picture just for Tony’s eyes and that’s what makes Steve fall in love with it.
Tony shakes his head and looks around the space. He intertwines his fingers and cracks the joints of them as he looks back at Thor.
Fortunately for Tony’s impatient Bruce seems to come to a quick conclusion after taking a deep breath and he blurts out, “I learnt how to control the Hulk.”
It occurred again a couple months later for Natasha’s birthday during the fall when Natasha had spent the whole day out of the Compound, only arriving as Steve, Tony and Bruce had been finishing dinner. Her face had very clearly begged them not to say anything about it so they hadn’t and the day had been left unacknowledged.
“Okay, I’m sorry I mentioned Steve,” she says, not sounding apologetic at all. “But would you answer the question? I’m worried too.”
“If I asked you to move to Malibu with me, even if I know how unfair that would be, would you do it?”
It seems like Natasha, Rhodey and Steve want to make the most out of this day because as soon as they’re done putting away the leftover cake in the fridge they guide Tony towards one of the big recreational rooms of the building. It’s the cinema room and Tony isn't sure it’s ever been used since the construction of the Compound.
“Say that you don’t think I’m creepy and gross for doing this?” Steve pleads, the hand Tony’s holding in his going clammy and shaky.
Steve laughs and nods, giving his attention back to the bots for a few seconds until Butterfingers moves away from him prompting the other two to do the same. They don’t move back towards Tony but to their corner of the room, where they start playing around with a few toys and objects that hadn’t been there the last time Steve had been in the room.
As soon as Bruce gives the okay for Tony to move around and try to have as normal of a life as it was possible again, Tony goes back to work. Work for him being trying to fix the world Thanos had left them with.
It doesn’t take long for Tony to realize they’re heading towards Steve’s room and this only serves to confound Tony more, wondering what it it that Steve has to show him in his room.
They’re echoes of old and new insecurities and Steve can’t get rid of them no matter how hard he tries, how hard he reminds himself that the weight of the world shouldn’t belong just on top of his shoulders.
As soon as he’s made sure he won’t be causing a scene or disturbing anything, he presses down onto the arc reactor in the middle of his chest and the suit starts assembling around him.
“Well,” Tony says as he rubs his thumb back and forth through the roughness of Steve’s cheek. “The stubble is new.”
Tony imagines brushing it away with the pad of his thumb but the image stays in his mind and promptly goes unperformed. He tells himself he’s still feeling too tired to move but his own voice comes back to him in the form of a single word he uttered only a short time ago, not about him but still fitting him perfectly.
Tony can’t make out his features well from so far enough but his hair looks longer than last time he saw him, however not as long as when the Avengers were first formed. It reaches his chin and covers a lot of his face but it doesn’t look clean or kept at all. In fact, Thor himself doesn’t look clean or kept. His clothes look old and they don’t match: grey, stocky cardigan; black sweatpants that drag over his feet; what look to be checkered home slippers.
Hearing this about their friend has left Steve, Tony and Natasha wounded time and time again but it’s simply been hell on Bruce. Through bits and pieces Tony’s been mostly able to gather from Bruce most of the information about his time in space after Ultron and he thinks he can understand a little better the bond he and Thor came back with.
He doesn’t do this because he believes he needs to protect one from the other in the slightest but because he understands the difficulty and complexity of the situation. Natasha and Rhodey are friends and because of this Rhodey feels for her and empathizes with her hurt, but he’s been to the places Ronin’s been in and, no matter what, he’ll always be a military man through and through.
Natasha was Steve’s rock but not really his co-leader in the way Tony had been. Natasha had been a way more emotional support for Steve that Tony had ever been back then but she hadn’t stepped up to be a managing entity of the Avengers until the Accords needed her to be.
Steve only has to move a few inches to put his body right in front of Tony’s, his arms coming up to wrap around Tony’s waist as Tony rests his on Steve’s shoulders. Tony’s legs moves his legs and keeps them wrapped around Steve’s waist, his ankles crossed behind Steve’s back.
There was a dream that Tony had a few weeks ago that to this day is still his favorite. That same dream is, to this day, also the worst one he’s ever had.
“I remember the first time Tony saw a little kid dressed up as Iron Man,” Rhodey comments. “He teared up.”
“Come with me,” Steve pleads, making Tony look back at him. “Please. I don't know if I’ll be able to help her alone.”
The streets of Queens were buoyant and they had a red tint to it that reminded Tony of one of his favorite pairs of sunglasses. There was indistinguishable chatter in the streets and although everyone was wearing coats and scarfs, the sun was shining bright and Tony felt a warmth in his bones.
Tony laughed softly and Steve noticed his eyes crinkled when he smiled. “It’s fine, really. It’s a classic meet-cute story, don’t you think?”
He knows the confrontation with Steve needs to happen sooner rather than later but it’s still dreadful to realize. It’s been so long since he and Steve have had a real fight and the mere thought of this reverting all the positive steps they’ve taken in their relationship feels terrifying.
Steve turns his head to the left to look at Tony and finds him already staring at him. Something in Tony’s eyes keeps Steve from wondering what’s happening out loud.
They take the elevator from their floor and Steve can see Tony taking a deep breath to his right. He also starts murmuring to himself, low enough that even Steve can’t pick up what he’s saying, but he can guess they’re some sort of words of self-encouragement.
He walks back to the bed, this time on the other side of where the chair he was sitting on is placed, and hesitates.
The rest of Tony’s morning is spent in a blur of calls and emails with people from the Maria Stark Foundation about their latest project, one that Tony has been deeply involved in for the past few months. Most of the charity’s work has been mostly contained to the US since its creation, but Tony has been pushing to change that with mixed results. The idea seemed simple in the beginning but there’s been a lot of bureaucratic work they’ve had to do in order to make it happen.
When Tony turns back around towards Steve to give him his drink he finds him sat in one of the island chairs, his arms resting on the surface and his head laying down on them.
“It was kind of like when I watched you exit the plane after Afghanistan,” Pepper laughs, a humorless sound.
The snowball made its way closer and closer to Natasha, bypassing Sam closely. In the last second, just as the ball was going to hit Natasha, she abruptly ducked making it look natural and uncomplicated, and the ball continued its straight pathway. Only a second had gone by when a resounding
Tony’s 48th birthday starts like the last two have started for him and Steve: in bed together kissing.
“No, no, hey,” Tony interrupts extending his arm to hold onto Natasha’s forearm. “I’m glad you told me. I want you to open up to me if that’s what you want. I know I tend to be the one doing all the talking in a room but I swear I can shut up long enough to listen every once in a while.”
“That’s better, right?” Tony asks. “I mean, this way she doesn’t have to mourn him, she won’t feel this pain that….”
“But,” Tony starts, feeling a little hesitant. “I’m not working right now and I don’t think Bruce is going to be feeling up for anything today.”
Natasha grabs her fork again and takes a mouthful of salad to eat from it. When she stops chewing and swallows it she smiles apologetically at Tony.
Tony opens his eyes and looks down. Even though there’s no light in the room Tony can tell he would only be able to see the crown of her head and her blonde hair if the lights were on.
When his eyes open again and his body has stopped feeling like it’s floating away, Tony comes back to the present just in time to watch Steve stroking himself a few more times before he comes as well. He comes into his hand and Steve immediately brings it to Tony’s stomach, mixing his come with Tony’s. It’s such a possessive gesture and Tony shudders.
She’s got one of her heels in her hand, the other one still on her left foot, which is lifted in the air from where she was obviously moving to take it off too. Before she can continue with the action she starts laughing heartily.
After maybe a minute has gone by Tony starts fidgeting and transferring his weight from one leg to another, simply looking for something to do under Steve’s intense gaze.
,” Steve murmurs, prolonging the second vowel sound. “No, no, of course. You can… I mean… I’d like you to wait here so I don’t have to be alone after. That’s what I meant. Not that you should come into the shower. I mean, obviously you’ve already showered. Not that if you hadn’t I would’ve—”
Valkyrie has enough time to walk past Steve and Tony and head inside after having thrown a salute their way before Thor even makes it halfway down the ramp. He’s not walking straight and Tony would say he was drunk if he didn’t know that was impossible for Thor. Just then, Thor tries to take one more step but tips over the edge of the ramp and falls down a couple of feet, his fall met with a loud thud that has both Steve and Tony wincing.
As his second tear traces a path down the slope of his nose, Tony tightens his grip on Steve’s hair.
Remember when I thought I knew how long this story was going to be? Oh, good times... Now I've finally caved and the chapters number has been replaced by the dreaded question mark. I'm sorry, everyone, but truth is this story could be 12, 14 or 100 chapters long.
Bruce, Steve and Tony leave simultaneously, their pace less hurried but just as determined as Natasha’s.
Denial stopped being possible for Tony months ago, but it was easily replaced by doubt. Doubt when Steve’s near him and his heart wants to escape out of his chest. Doubt when he has a bad day and he wants to tell Steve to never touch him again. Doubt when he goes long without seeing Steve and he misses him, a feeling so strong that longing isn’t enough to describe it.
Tony had said and yet Pepper’s story reminds him of so many women he knew around his block in the 40s, women constantly dreading that visit that would let them know their husbands, sons or brothers wouldn't be making it back to them.
“Nothing,” he answers, keeping his voice light. “I just didn't know you were at the point of traveling with Bruce quite yet after everything.”
Here Tony has spoken about Peter more than he’s done so anywhere else, here Steve has told Tony stories about his mother and his sickly youth, and although he hasn’t yet opened up about recent events -losing Sam and Bucky, his thoughts on a possible reversal of the snap and other such topics- Tony feels like they’ve made some leeway during their heart-to-hearts. Steve is now more prone to share anecdotes from his time away from the States after the Accords and every time he shares something with Tony it feels more impactful and closer to being what he really needs to be talking about.
As Tony grew and things changed, he learnt to love some aspects of his life better and he dealt with the resentment for others in ways that although not healthy, at times proved to be successful. One thing Tony never learnt to love and never tried to deal with further than complaining about it was his hatred for formal wear.
All the disappointment Tony was feeling is replaced by fondness, and excitement, and hope. It rushes through his veins and it fills his brain.
There is a question in his eyes that Tony’s sure must be reflected on his own. But neither of them will have the answers and they won't be able to reach them alone. Quickly, they both get to their feet and, leaving their mugs behind on the island, they set path to the outside of the building, where Thor and Valkyrie must have landed with their ship.
“I was just coming back from my routine run around the perimeter when I found this,” he says while extending his hand.
Pepper was right when she told him he would love meeting JARVIS -the idea that something as advanced as him existed blew Steve’s mind the first time he had a conversation with him- but he still gets startled by him at times. He’s still not in the mentality of asking him for things he needs to make more use of him, just like he hasn't yet gotten used to the incredible technology he could use if he so desired.
As Tony follows he can see his made bed and he takes notes of a couple of things around the room: one of Steve’s winter jackets thrown across an armchair, a drawer that’s only half shut, Steve’s phone left charging on his bedside table… It’s not the first time Tony’s been inside Steve’s room but they don’t tend to spend their time together on their bedrooms so it still kind of feels like novelty to be allowed here at all.
Tony can spot almost all of these signs by taking one quick glance at Steve as he enters the kitchen and their eyes lock.
Rhodey shows him Iron Patriot after he comes to the Tower still in the suit from a mission just recently wrapped up.
As soon as he’s made a 180º turn Steve stars lowering Tony to the floor and when Tony’s bare feet touch the ground again he giggles.
He lets a couple of seconds pass and, as his fingers move towards the piece of paper, he deliberately hits it incorrectly, making it fly a little too far to the left, missing Nebula’s goal post by a wide stretch.
Before the Army and Project Rebirth and Captain America, he had never had the opportunity to lead anyone or anything. He was too sickly for it and, honestly, no one ever gave him the time of day and no one would have ever trusted him to do a good job at it. His aspect was the only thing most people could see and Steve’s appearance before the serum didn’t particularly scream
Tony tosses and turns all night long, never settling, never really falling asleep. He tries not to think about it but the harder he tries the worse it gets.
Natasha’s gaze softens, in fact her whole face does. She visibly swallows and licks her lips a couple of times, as if trying to gain a little time to find the correct words.
Tony raises an eyebrow at him. “Don’t you dare start doing any work, Steven. This is your free day.”
Tony chuckles softly and Steve looks at him from the corner of his eye, his lips upturning slightly before he turns back to look at some undefined point in the opposite wall.
Tony opens the bedroom door and gestures at Steve so he’s the first of the two to walk through it. Steve’s arm grazes Tony’s own when he walks past him and Tony feels it like a shock to his system. He walks into the bedroom after Steve and hesitates when he goes to instinctively close the door. He closes it after a few seconds of inaction and then turns around to find Steve sitting on the edge of the right side of his bed.
Steve clears his throat before he brings his right hand over to the glass to knock on it and alert Tony of his presence.
Not a family of obligation by blood, like his parents, not family of choice that through love and work you keep even though it is a thousands of miles away almost everyday, like Rhodey, but a family of building bonds, extensive learning, extreme proximity, rough edges and intense companionship.
He flies it around Steve and performs a demonstration for every single one of the added features it has and they both are excited to try sparring as Rhodey wears it. It’s thrilling and a fun challenge to Steve, who even gets to use the shield.
Tony’s gaze is solely focused on him now and he’s wearing a somber expression, like Steve’s answer to this silly question is worth a lot more that Steve can even imagine.
Steve doesn’t move his hand away but he lets Tony’s lower body down back into the mattress and he climbs back up the bed so he’s face to face with Tony again.
“What?” Tony mutters without moving his lips, like it’s more a thought that escaped his mind without permission than a real question he wanted to ask.
He’s wearing a pair of loose jeans and a gray hoodie that is very soft to the touch. Tony knows this because he’s seen Steve wear the same outfit a hundred times, his preferred clothes for staying in.
There’s less than a week to go for what Thor has dubbed the “bash of the century” and Steve can tell more and more each day how little Tony is looking forward to it, no matter how many times his boyfriend denies it.
Now, Tony can’t think of any other way it could be: Bruce by his side in the lab as they work the day away, Natasha by his side after both of their nightmares even if it gets hard for them to admit what they’re still doing up.
Tony’s hands start shaking and he can’t get over the shock of seeing Peter’s face once again, even if just in picture format.
Bruce’s birthday is also looming in the horizon and he has yet to say anything about it but maybe that is an statement all in itself.
The day the Avengers’ PR team releases a statement regarding the possible reversal of the snap -or more accurately the almost impossibility of that happening- Steve and Tony spend hours holed up in Tony’s workshop. They stay in silence for long periods of time and when they speak the conversation is at times stilted. Every word seems to drip remorse and Tony and Steve have so much going on in their own minds that it’s difficult for them to find the right words to comfort the other.
Tony moves his left arm carefully, the one he doesn't have pressed down into the beanbag. He extends it until his hand is hovering just inches away from Steve’s face. Nothing in Steve’s expression hints at any sign of unease so Tony lowers his hand slowly until it cups the side of Steve’s face, his cheek.
In the end avoiding Tony is a lot more complicated that Steve would have thought. Especially because Tony starts seeking him out.
“She called me a couple of weeks ago,” Bruce explains. “She was thinking of settling with all the remaining Asgardians somewhere on the north of Europe because she said they couldn’t keep roaming around as wanderers from one planet to another forever and she knows how much Earth means to Thor.”
Rocket -and that’s the raccoon’s name because no, it wasn’t his brain playing tricks on him- comes into the room and up until the moment he leaves Tony is sure it was pretty much an accident because all he does is walk around opening cabinets and drawers and rummaging through them. Tony thinks he sees him slip a couple of things into his pockets but he’s too confused, and still also too tired, to question it.
He’s on a short leave from the Air Force and Tony feels almost gleeful when Rhodey calls him to tell him he’ll be staying in New York for the entirety of it. They’ve been talking at least once a week, like they’ve been doing for years, but in the past few months that hasn't felt like enough. Tony has had more than his fare share of scares and complications in his life, and Rhodey’s profession isn’t exactly known for its safety, but the slithering feeling in the pit of his stomach has never been as uncomfortable as it is now whenever he has to hang up from a conversation with Rhodey.
