,” he caught himself thinking.
“Oh Sherlock I would never forget you,” John said reaching for his best friend's back of the neck, his thumb running in circles in an appeasing way. They stared into each others eyes for a few moments before coming back from their reverie.
Greg shook his head, rubbing his palm over his face. Why was he in the middle of this? Had he turned into some marriage counselor? Greg let out a deep sigh and stood up from his seat to look at John in the eye.
“Oh interesting,” Sherlock said, to which made John turn his head from the sea horizon to his boyfriend.
“er… Yes among other things…” Sherlock shrugged half a shoulder.
“What are you talking about?”
“Apologies,” the stranger finally said in a deep baritone voice as if melted chocolate, “I get lost when I’m thinking.”
Later on, when they came back to their cottage, it was time to pack, and for once Sherlock helped.
“John, I can feel your eyes on me.”
Sherlock didn’t usually go on vacations, he simply didn’t. London was far more interesting to let it go to waste on going on a vacation. Furthermore, he only lived for his work. That wasn’t the case anymore, or at least it wasn’t as important as John.
He looked around and saw a volley ball near by, soon enough a small woman, in her mid thirties, long hezlnut hair that was tied in a pony tail, came up to him, looking very sorry. She was wearing a sport top and white shorts.
John looked at his new lover’s face. His lips were red and pup of being roughly kissed for the past few minutes. His eyes were dark full of lust and John could help to kiss him again.
The’ moving in’ reminded John of the Photo album. He had keep it with him on his bedside table for the past 2 years. Walking into his room, he grabbed the album and walked toward Sherlock. The detective was sitting on his armchair, eyes closed breathing in the air of the flat, tasting John’s scent all over the place, It was as if trying to find what had changed in the time he’d been away.
They swam for a while, did a few races in the water to see who was faster, and also snog a few times, because why not? They were on holidays, they didn’t knew anyone there, they could do whatever they wanted.
“They are part of a gang that Scotland Yard and I are trying to get intel from a Drug cartel. They probably saw me snooping around and weren’t too happy.”
“Had a little domestic?” Greg jested. Sherlock sent him a warning glare.
“No silly,” John said, wrapping an arm around Sherlock's shoulders, “Because it’s the first birthday we celebrate together. The first of many!” He smiled at his new friend.
“That was one of the reasons I left it behind.” Sherlock’s voice was hoarse too, his throat suddenly dry.
“What about you?”
“Alright, I’m going to check the stuff over there, see if there’s anything interesting,” he pointed to the end of the shop, “don’t do anything stupid while I’m gone.”
“I just want to be skin to skin with you, that’s all. Feel you. It appeases me.”
“You deserve it, it’s been a long time since we’ve been out of London,”
The consultant detective got back to his initial position, on the sofa and put his fingers underneath his chin in his usual thinking position. He closed his eyes and passed in review John’s behavior in these past few weeks.
One of Sherlock’s hand came to settle on John’s hand and caress it before he went back to his phone.
Sherlock tried to focus back on his book but it was hopeless, John was too much tempting in his swimming shorts, especially his bottom. The detective put his book down, and start running towards John. When he passed him though, he didn't stop and simply shout,“race you to the water!”
“Interesting?”
Of course, John was the reason, they were on vacations. One day over breakfast he simply stated that they should go on a holiday, get out of the flat, get London out of their lungs, be somewhere and someone else for a few days.
“What?” Greg shook his head in disbelief, “No way, John is madly in love with you. If he got through all of your shit all these years, he’s not backing away now.” Greg assured the genius.
“Or what?” The curly head pushed.
“But John-”
When they broke apart, Sherlock closed his eyes as John went in for a gentle kiss on his forehead. "We belong together, Sherlock.”
This has been on my google drive forever, I came up across it while looking for my notes to revise my exams, I decided to edit and publish it.
“Thanks,” John said, putting back on his coat when he saw the detective that worked with Sherlock approach him.
“No,” He huffed,
“Angelo’s, 7 pm. Tomorrow night?” Sherlock proposed.
“Yes of course. John, hi,” Lestrade seemed to remember him and extended his hand for a handshake. John noticed he looked exhausted as if he hadn’t sleep in the past few days, by the bags he had under his eyes.
“John, could you fetch me my phone please,” Sherlock asked, eyes still focus on the microscope.
“Another time.” he said nuzzling his partner, “I’m enjoying your warmth.”
“Lestrade, just texted me about-”
“Come on, herlock, smile to the camera, I just want a picture of you. You grow so fast my little boy.” His mom said, camera in hand.
It was beautiful, John couldn’t help but take a thousand picture of the same mountains, which annoyed extremely his partner which had to wait for him to take the pictures every 5 seconds.
“Need any help?”
Sherlock stood still, the new piece of information getting through his brain. A few seconds later, Sherlock ran off after John.
“No. ”
“No nothing that would need your assistance. I’ll see you later.” John heard his boyfriend say before dashing off.
He wondered if John would be rather a rough lover or a soft, worshipping kind of partner? What if right now, John knocked the door down, took the violin from Sherlock’s hands and pushed him against the window, grasping his hands above his head and kissing him with passion.
By now, they were mostly by themselves which was great, most people had gone home for dinner. Being alone in this place only made it look more magical and natural. They lied down on the rock and enjoyed the sunny rays coming their way. It was the perfect day of a perfect summer holiday, John even managed to make Sherlock take a picture with him to remind him of this day later on, which he was quite proud.
“Yes, very. We got quite lucky coming here in this heat wave. I thought it will be raining most of the time. Actually, I think that’s was what my boyfriend had in mind all along, making me happy by going abroad yet getting his wish to just to stay in bed all day.” He joked.
Did this mean that Sherlock wasn’t so unappeal by sentiment after all?
“Oh Really? That’s your brilliant plan? And I thought I was dating a genius” John was starting to get angry and fighting off with his restrains.
“How romantic of you.” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
So here it is for the end this trip. They certainly had fun but nothing better than coming back home to their own flat and own bed.
John frowned at this new piece of information but didn’t push it further, “Any idea who is holding us hostage?”
“Are you enjoying yourself, seeing me miserable?” Sherlock asked.
“I’ll go get it.” Sherlock took his wallet from their bag and went to the small shop just outside the beach.
“As it vexes me to admit it,” Sherlock grimaced “I don’t really know.”
Later that night when they were both sound asleep they were woken up by the water that had risen during the night, wetting almost all their belongings. In a hurry, they took their stuff, their sleeping bags and tent and ran till their cottage who thankfully was near by. The situation might have seemed bad but they could stop laughing all the way back to the cottage, probably due to the adrenaline.
“Not, it’s... fine.” He said, with a shy smile. His phone chimed and he reach out to see from who it was.
“So It won't be tomorrow. Or the day after, but maybe the next week or next month.”
[................]
“You’ll have to walk naked for a week, of buy some new clothes.” John said in a serious tone, folding a shirt.
They found a nice place to camp on a small beach that night, it wasn’t very windy which was great and they light up a fire without a problem. They spent a nice time watching the water by the fire and by eleven o’clock they decided to go to sleep.
Today had been a quiet and normal day. No cases, no murders to catch, just a regular day. John worked for the most part of it while Sherlock stayed home doing experiments and playing the violin. John had picked up take-out on his way home from the surgery and after dinner they enjoyed the evening by the fire in their respective armchairs simply talking.
When he was a child and with his parents, he would take the ferry to cross the English channel to go visit his grandparents in France, he would let himself imagine that it was his ship, he was the captain and they were sailing over the seven seas looking for hidden treasures. Like Pirates do. He was sure John wouldn’t object.
John kept smiling as he passed beside Sherlock to climb up the stairs. Sherlock couldn’t help but close his eyes as he felt John’s body graze his and then opened them up to follow John’s backside with his eyes as he ascended the stairs.
“Okay, fine.” Sherlock gave in ,already checking up online where to find a tent and sleeping bags.
“Forget it, Sherlock. I’m going home.” The doctor said trying hailing a cab.
“You’re kidding?”
“What, Now?” Sherlock asked indignantly pulling a few inches back .
Once they were both done with it, they both went back to their occupations, later in the afternoon, Sherlock was reading a book, deep in focus and John couldn’t help himself but stare at him, at his beautiful partner. He was so lucky to have this man in his life.
“I’ll be there.” John gave him his best joyful smile, showing how impatient he was for their date.
“Barely a two, I’m conducting it by email.” That made John smiled into his hair.
Back in their cabin, and taking their coats off, John shook a bit at the room temperature. Apparently, the air con was very much in function, even though as the night fell, the temperature descended. Sherlock tried to switch it off but nothing worked, so the room would be cold for the night. Well let’s not a small problem ruin everything, John thought, trying to stay positive. Therefore they opted to share one of the two small beds in the cabin in order to keep warm and avoid getting sick on their first day of vacations. It was also a lovely way to cuddle with Sherlock in a small single bed in other to keep warm, (Who would have thought, that Sherlock would be such a cuddler?), a few lazy kisses till sleep took both of them. Very domestic indeed.
“What’s going on here.” Asked a deep baritone voice.
“That’s me to keep, and you to find out,” He winked, as he ended to handshake and started walking away, towards his own flat.
“Oh, and what is?”
“Well can you try to think more quietly? I’m trying to study.” John retorted hands on his hips.
“Show me.” Sherlock’s mind came back to reality. His logical side taking over,
“Unfortunately my inspiration comes rarely during the daytime.”
“Maybe you should try to play more ballads to make us all fall asleep, Mr Holmes, rather than keeping us awake.” John winked, taking his hand. He’d try to hold to the memory of this touch for as long as he could.
“A local.” John sat up and waited for him to do the same beside him.
“Yes, I forgive you. You idiot,” He said before sitting next to Sherlock and pecking him on the lips, proving that everything was alright. “And thanks, for the ice cream.” he kissed him again.
“It’s quite red,” the woman said, staring at his face, “I’m really sorry.” She looked genuinely apologetic.
That sentenced was full of love and tenderness, Sherlock's hands grabbed John’s waist forcing him to straddled him and kissed him once again. It was Sherlock, this time, that initiate the kiss. It started as slow and turned gradually more passionate. They kept kissing till they were out of breath, and then kissed some more, making up for the time lost.
Sixteen… That’s a lot younger then he had given the guy. Maybe it was because he is so tall? John sighs. “I see.” Then Sherlock suddenly leans forward, bringing his face close to John’s. “Is my age a problem to you?” John gives him a gentle smile. “No! Well… A bit actually. I’m nineteen you see…” He says and Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “So?"
“Do you want me?” Sherlock asks and John scoffs. Want him? What kind of question was that? Of course the man is attractive, John must give him that. But John is not gay. There is no way John can enjoy touching this man. Sliding his hands over his pale body, feeling every inch of it. Neither can he enjoy kissing him. His own lips against Sherlock’s perfectly formed lips. Sliding his tongue in the man’s mouth and explore the inside of his mo-
Only when John gets closer he noticed the blood on Sherlock’s side and how he’s holding it. “Wh-what..” John starts but Sherlock just turns around. “It’s nothing. Just a minor mistake. Follow me.” John follows Sherlock and closes the door behind him. John looks around and gets a weird feeling in his stomach. He feels physically sick to be back home. Sherlock leads John to the basement and when they get down John freezes.
Eventually it is Saturday evening. The park was closing and everyone was making themselves ready to go home. John is making the last preparations for tomorrow when Greg pops his head around the corner.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “You were staring at the necklace and obviously thinking. Before you were really fascinated by the transformation. You have also shown a lot of interest in me, well in my race at least. And it’s a question a lot of people ask so it wasn’t that hard.”
“You can’t wait by that phone forever Sherlock.” John says and Sherlock sighs in response. “I know. I just don’t want to miss the call. We don’t know what he’s capable of.” On that moment the phone pings and Sherlock grabs it quickly. He reads the text on the screen and then runs over to the bedroom. Before John even can walk over there to check what is going on Sherlock walks back out fully dressed.
John shakes his head and Kevin sighs deeply. “Do you have any idea?” John asks and Kevin looks up at him. “I’m afraid I might do.” John looks curious as he waits for Kevin to continue. “Last year Sherlock was involved in some drug deals. I managed to help him out of it but it wouldn’t surprise me if he fell back in it."
A couple days went by and John has got himself a job in a cafe around the corner. It’s not much but it’s something to get him started. It is Monday and John has a day off. He is watching some tv when the front door opens and closes. Sherlock appears in the doorframe, soaking wet from the rain. “Want a towel?” John asks as he gets up.
“Why are you yelling…? It’s the middle of the night.” Sherlock says in a sleepy voice.
John bites his bottom lip. “Shit I’m sorry man. I guess I wasn’t really there with my mind.”
John takes a cup from her. “It’s Sherlock…"
John nods. “Okay, Sherlock, you can call me John. And just for your information, I don’t care if you want to get out of here. Heck I even understand if you want to.” He looks around the room that has nothing in it except for the reservoir. “However, I rather not get in trouble helping you out okay. So it’s better if you wait here. I will get you some work clothes so it’ll look less suspicious when you are walking around here. Then we’ll see what we do okay.”
“See anything you like?” John asks as he put down the cups of hot tea.
John swings his backpack over his shoulder. “Actually I have to go to the manager. Discuss some things you know. Do you happen to know if he’s still in?”
“Oh god…” John whispers as he stares at the man on his bed. He quickly looks around, on his night stand, around the bed and eventually in his trash can. When he sees the ripped condom package he sighs in relief. John looks up when he hears Sherlock shift in the bed. Two ice blue eyes are starring lazily at him and John feels a warm feeling in his stomach when Sherlock softly pads on the empty spot next to him. John craws back into the bed, pulling the cover over both of them.
Sherlock groans softly and John looks up confused. “What?” He asks as he steps further into the room. “Brother…?” He looks from one man to the other and back. Sherlock sighs and turns back to John.
“You were taking forever.” He simply says and turned himself around, swimming towards John. He leans on edge and it looks very familiar to John. “I thought I might dry up.”
“Where is your car?” Sherlock asks, looking around the parking lot where just a few cars are standing.
“Not yet.” John says. “What is this necklace? What does it do?” The creature growls softly before speaking. “It’s none of your business.” It glares at John.
When Sherlock notices the stop on which John told them to get off was next he wakes John up. John has to take a minute to realize where he is and the train stops. They both get off and Sherlock follows John towards the sea. They haven't talked for the whole journey. It is raining when they arrive at the beach, the wind is cold and icy so John puts his hands deep in his pockets. They are the only ones here and he turns to look at Sherlock.
John is surprised. “How did you-“
“What do you want me to do? Give you my word?”
“That I got a chance.” He said slowly gazing into Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and focused back onto his work, trying to preventing John from seeing colour rising to his cheeks.
“But-”
Everything indicated this to be the end of a perfect date, however, John should have known better. As they turned a block, men attacked them from behind, they put a black cloth over their faces and injected them with some kind of a drug in the neck. The last thing John remembered was feeling Sherlock’s brush of fingers over his own hand before everything went to black.
“Liar. You know it’s alright to be human and feel tired.”
“I’ll just need a few minutes of your time to ask some questions and you’ll be free to go.”
“Yes and now you ruined it as I predicted! That’s why we can’t have nice things, Sherlock.” He said before walking out.
“And it annoys you that you haven’t found out what this is about yet,” Greg said.
“I do.” Sherlock locked his eyes with John, “I just wanted to keep a souvenir of you.”
“You’ve seen a load of dead corpses then.” Sherlock walked closer as if drawn by a magnetic field, staring down at John.
They shared a soft and delicate kiss. When they broke apart Sherlock rest his head on John’s chest, listening to his heartbeat and in a matter of minutes both of them fell asleep happily in each other arms.
Sherlock observed him turned around the corner to finally close the door, he looked at his violin and bow dropped on the couch where he left it to answer the door. Well since he couldn't  play tonight he would finish his experiment and at the same time catalogue all the small details that he had gained access to from that beautiful specimen that he had just met.
“Why do you have a photo of us as background?” Sherlock’s face express surprise but he put his neutral face so quickly back on that John wondered if he hadn’t imagined it. “I thought you would rather have a violin or a magnifying glass.” He commented.
John had a light that brought Sherlock’s whole attention. He didn’t treat Sherlock like a freak or weirdo, he took him as he was and loved to hear stories from Sherlock’s old cases.
The rocks were stable and weren’t very slippery thank god. John tried to keep up with Sherlock and his bloody long legs but it was easier said than done.
Although, he had really lovely lips. What would they taste like? And John would love to run a hand through his neighbour’s marvellous curly hair and to caress his fair skin, to get lost in his alluring eyes before leaning in for a slow and passionate kiss.
"Alright, just one."
“Wha- I’m not looking through your phone.” John defended himself, locking the screen, “not as if there was anything to look for. You barely use it.”
“Holmes, The name is Sherlock Holmes.” He said going for a handshake.
They ate their ice cream in silence and when both had finished they put the wooden sticks on a rubbish near by.
Tonight he was playing a recent song that John had told him he liked, after having searched on youtube a violin cover in hopes to bring John back to his door and possibly into his flat for the first time.
John, draw his face closer to Sherlock, giving him a little peck at the same time and took the picture.
“Those examples are dull and predictable.” Sherlock gave John a sideways look and quickly focused back on his sample. “I Just picked a random photo.” He shrugged.
In the end, they bought a few key-rings, a fridge magnet (John was planning to start a collection and start to force Sherlock to go on vacations more often), a tea towel for Mrs Hudson, a bottle-opener shaped into a leprechaun for Greg and his beloved beers, a woolen scarf for Molly. John also bought a mug shaped in an leprechaun face and a T-shirt.
After a lazy morning in bed, they decided it was time to get out of the house, so in the afternoon, the couple decided to go do some kayak, enjoy the coast view from the sea. They rented two kayaks and started to rowing. It was fun, from time to time they would go against each other on purpose or splash each other with their paddles. They spent their time laughing.
All these happy memories of them growing up together. Some were taken with a camera, John was sure were from Sherlock's mother, some of them were taken with their own phones that Sherlock had then printed. This showed how much their friendship meant to Sherlock. That their memories were important enough to be saved in this album.
“Of course not. But I don’t know how many they are and how efficiently armed they are. I need further intel before establishing some sort of plan. For now, I’ll just need to untie myself and contact Scotland Yard” Sherlock’s voice was calm and composed while John’s heart was beating from such adrenaline.
“Leave where?” John chuckled not phased by the ultimatum.
“Mmh no,” His partner mumbled.
“Shh, cuddle with me or I’ll leave.”
“Then let’s get over with dinner quickly so we can have some fun.” Sherlock smirked, and John only finished his glass of wine to give him the strength to survive this dinner without being arrested for indecency.
The new sound made both men turned their head towards the door. Sherlock, hands in his coat pockets, raised an eyebrow at the scene. He closed the door behind him with his left hand and turned toward john.
“I thought you hated to see your face in photographs.”
“But your hand...” He trailed off.
“Homicides.”
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked at the ceiling. He needed to change if he wanted to keep John.
“Hello,” Sherlock managed to say in a cracked voice, his mind blank.
“You were the only one I could think of.” He shrugged off.
“I’m not, and you’re eating. That’s an order.”
John stayed sat back on his chair perplex. Since when did Sherlock enjoy spending time with Greg more than with him? Something wasn’t right here.
They met John on their way out as they descended the stairs. It seemed that he was coming back from the library by his backpack and his damp hoodie covering his head.
“I want you to take this photo with you when you’re away. So you don’t forget me.” Sherlock said.
“Where have you been?” Sherlock asked his lover, from his armchair, hands under his chin.
They were 6 years old, John had just moved into town, and somehow they became friends. For the first time in his life, Sherlock had finally a friend. He used to hate birthdays, especially his since he didn’t have any friends to celebrate it with. That changed when John came along. John might have been the only one to attend his party but it was the best birthday Sherlock had had and that photo was the proof of it and the reason why he couldn't burn it.
“Exactly,” John beamed at him as a cab stopped in front of them.
“Yes.”
That made John laugh and Sherlock felt lucky to be the one who caused that effect. Now that the tension had disappeared, they took a look at the menu.
“Sherlock, love, would you mind, applying some sunblock on my back please? I can’t reach it.”
“Well, It’s more like he mingles in our cases and I try to keep him away from dangerous business,” Lestrade replied.
“No." He confirmed, nodding.
“Alright, Any idea what we should take for Mrs Hudson?” John asked.
They arrived at their cottage a bit after half past five, and after enjoying a shower together they went out to eat in a local restaurant. It was very cosy for a date. Sherlock chose the wine as John chose their food since Sherlock didn’t want to eat but John didn’t give him any other choice.
“These photos, you kept them all?” His voice turning raspy out of sudden. He stepped slightly closer to Sherlock as if afraid to scare him off.
Sherlock nodded and without realising a big smile had appeared on his face, mirroring John's.
“It’s your brother.” He informed.
Sherlock sighed, shaking his head and making his wild curls bounced around his head.
One thing he wasn't expecting was that it was all pictures of the two of them. Some pictures that he didn’t even remember taking. One thing that was present in all of them was happiness. They looked happy in all of them. That brought up a sad smile to John’s face. He caressed the photos with his finger as he remebered the past, a life with Sherlock in it.
“Lestrade, fancy seeing you here,” Sherlock appeared out of nowhere, his conversation with his brother probably finished.
John was interrupted in his ear-dropping by the medic releasing him,
“Oh, Thank you.” John thought he could see a semblance of a blush creeping on his neighbours’ neck.
Sherlock extended his palm and John gave his phone back. He fell silent for a few seconds before curiosity got the better of him.
“Don’t lie to me.”
John looked down at him in disbelief, his eyes blinking furiously for a few seconds.
“We’ll come by the station tomorrow,” Sherlock said.
“I see, flirting you mean?” Sherlock did the same and stroke delicately John’s jaw and dropped a small chaste kiss, to make the pain go away.
“But I thought...”
John finished his cross words and put it aside. He laid down on his towel and closed his eyes. A few minutes passed when suddenly he felt a ball hit his face, it hurt like hell. He opened his eyes in surprise by the shock of the hit, and to see who or what was his attacker. He jaw hurt like hell, and he brought his hand up to massage the skin, trying to make the pain go away.
‘You’ve been on the computer for 2 hours.”
“Yes,” he said leaning closer to kiss Sherlock.
“Good to know.” John caught once again trying to get rid of the lump in his throat, “How do you know?”
“A case?” Greg said unsure.
Sherlock shrugged, “Fine,” but he didn’t move to help, his head full of other ideas. Suddenly he rose from leaning against the hardboard and crawled to John who was standing at end of the bed, suitcase in front of him. Sherlock pushed the object off the bed, just like a cat would and it fell on the floor in a loud thump. The clothes that John had meticulously fold were on the ground in a pile of mess.
[................]
John took a look at his phone, the picture was blurry, the light wasn’t very good and the angle was terrible, his head was half cut off since he was standing beside a sitting sherlock.
“No. No case! We are on vacation, we just arrived for Christ sake.”
Sherlock decided that the last week of September would be lovely, the days would still be warm but not as much as in the heat of August and the sunset would happened late in the evening, giving them enough time per day to explore and enjoy their activities.
“Well, you were the one wanting to go abroad. Staying home with you, only sheets between us is fine by me.” Sherlock said.
The annoying music came back again two weeks later, late at night. However, this time the violin was being played in a way that revealed a real slow and passionate melody. No cat was being tortured, and if John was honest with himself it was quite pleasing to hear. The music wasn’t as much as a bother as it was the other night, but John saw this as an opportunity and very good excuse to go complain once more to the devilishly good looking upstairs neighbour, after all, what harm could it do?
“No, of course not.”
“Don’t be so public school, for god sake. It’s just for one night and it will be fun and exciting, we’ll do a small camp fire, eat dinner there with a barbecue. And then sleep cosily, cuddling each other.”
Now it was time for bed, John had just finished brushing his teeth. He walked into their bedroom to find Sherlock sitting on their bed, against the headboard and under the covers, deeply focused on his phone. His hair was a mess from him running his hand through it over and over during the day and John found it adorable. He smiled at the picture os Sherlock in front of him. Who knew that one day he would get the chance to share his life with this beautiful man.
“It’s a rather old photo to be picked randomly. Feeling a little bit sentimental are we?” John teased.
But as much as it pained him, he had to let go and going through *his* stuff was the best way to do it. Besides he didn’t want Mycroft's minions to do it, going through Sherlock’s personal goods, invading his privacy.

“Yes,” Sherlock cut in, “Probably, it’s a very famous one. Maybe one day, you’ll let me play for you.”
“Jacket.”
When finally John appeared through the door though, it all changed. His smile put Sherlock’s mind at peace. He was dressed in simple jeans and an old jumper but he had put on his “date night” shoes. Sherlock saw John’s eyes searching the room and felt his gaze on him once he found him. He felt lighter than, John crossed the room quickly and sat before him.
“Why?!” John asks while breathing heavily. “Why was just ruining Harry and my life not enough?!"
John woke up by the sound of the front door closing. He looks on his phone. 02:39. Who the hell comes home this late? John softly slips out of bed and walks towards the living room. There was a faint light coming from the kitchen and John went to check it out. There was boy standing in front of the fridge. He picks up the milk and drinks it straight from the bottle. John just stands there, observing the boy. He had dark, curly hair, pale skin, black skinny jeans with a black sweater and a backpack on his back.
John just stares back into Sherlock’s eyes and there’s a long silence. They only thing you could hear is the water splashing and the calm breathing of them both. Sherlock then leans in and kisses John. Soft at first, just their lips touching, but more deeply after that. He pushes John till his back hits the wall and starts kissing his neck now. John hums in pleasure as Sherlock makes his way down. Sherlock gently strokes up and down John’s chest while sucking a hickey in his neck. John closes his eyes and let’s the men do to him whatever he wants. Sherlock slowly makes his way down but suddenly stops. John opens his eyes again and looks at Sherlock who has his gaze fixed on the door.
When they arrive back home John immediately takes a shower. When he walks into the living room Kevin stands there. It seems like he and Sherlock had a discussion because Sherlock walks past John and slams the front door behind him.
“Had to leave early.
John still sends Sherlock texts regularly even though he doesn’t respond. It has become a habit. Almost a journal actually. He sends him a messages if something has happened, good and bad. He sends him Merry Christmas messages and happy birthday, he got Sherlock’s birthday from Kevin. He keeps on sending them without knowing if someone reads them.
He wakes up by the sound of his phone that was buzzing on his nightstand. He picks up and answers in a sore voice.
John looks at him surprised. Trying to think back about what exactly he did yesterday. He remembers cutting and cleaning the fish. He remembers putting them in the right bucket and cleaning up.
John gulps. “I made the preparations, showered and went home…” He says carefully, not sure how Greg will respond if he knows he is lying. Greg pulls up an eyebrow.
When they arrive at home Sherlock acts like nothing has happened. He uses John’s laptop without asking, keeps complaining that he is bored and takes a bath every day (sometimes even twice a day). John can not act like this. He keeps thinking about that day. When he thought Sherlock has left him forever but came back. The empty look in his eyes when he told John everyone was gone. He can't get the imagine out of his mind.
“Maybe after a date?” Sherlock prompted,
Coming back to the cottage, they were both exhausted and drained from their day’s activities, after a quick shower and a small bite they went to bed. Sherlock being a needy boyfriend, wrapped himself around John, his hear against John’s heart and his hand over his stomach while their legs were tingled. They fell asleep in no time.
“What was that for?” Sherlock asked, breathing loudly while running a hand through his damp hair, getting it out of his eyes.
“What? It’s true.”
“No?”
John soon came to realize that what really matter was that Sherlock was back into his life and he was thankful for that since he had missed him immensely. Sherlock was moving back to Baker Street and they spent all day bringing all his possessions back to the flat. Mycroft had kept them in a warehouse knowing that Sherlock would come back someday, eventually.
“I’m not being public-school, I just like my comfort,” Sherlock argued, “Besides what’s the point of renting a cottage to go sleep on the beach in a tent?”
John looked up, his eyes catching Sherlock’s and staring.
“John can’t you see how much a conductor of light you are to me?”
“I’d say you got yourself a smart guy.” She replied, “Well, I’ll leave you be, Sorry again for the hit. Have a nice holiday.” She waved good bye, the volley ball underneath her arm as she walked back to her friends.
They were fine, and John had an impression that if he continued his association with Sherlock Holmes he wasn’t done with adventure.
When they arrived near the waterfall, there were a few people, and they decided to climb to the top to have a better view of the horizon.
“Case.”
Lestrade narrowed his eyes, confused. “What has this to do with me?”
“Then let me do it for you.”  The genius put down his right  knee and looked up the John, just in the middle of the pavement, “John will you marry me?”
“Stop it.” John warned, putting another shirt on his case. “We’re going.”
“Yes, I’d like that.”
John ran his hands on Sherlock’s bare back and cupped his bottom, “Oh yeah,” he breathe, one hand coming to grasp the back of Sherlock’s neck, drawing down so he could ravish him with his mouth.
“Yeah, well only fools don’t change their minds,” he said sheepishly to which the stranger smiled and John could see his cheeks becoming reddish.
“Well, there’s go our first date.”
John finally gathered enough strength to go through Sherlock’s stuff. It had been 3 weeks since The Fall, since Sherl- *his* death. John couldn’t quite say the sentence yet. It didn’t feel real.
“That was for cheating,” John deadpanned, then he got closer and wrapped his arms around his boyfriend neck, leaning up for a sweet kiss, “And this is for winning,” He chuckled.
“Don’t go there, we are not going away to spend all day indoors, in bed, for that we could’ve stayed home.”
“Oh, I see you’ve find my old album.”
“Whoa, that was great!”
Back in the flat, John closed the door and slapped himself mentally.
“Where are you going?” John asked, seeing Sherlock putting his coat on.
What a disappointment when it wasn’t him.
“Alright, I’ll take the meatballs.”
“Well I’m off to Mike’s, I promised that I would hang around with him for a bit. See you later, Sherlock.” And then dashed off the room.
Soon enough they arrived on port and rent a car, Sherlock being the one driving since John didn’t have a driver’s licence, not seeing the point of one while living in London where having a car was very expensive. Sherlock of course learned how as it could come handy for a case.
“So? It’s his name isn’t it?”
Although Sherlock would never admit it, there are indeed some pictures that are worth keeping in his opinion. The first picture that made an exception on Sherlock’s book, was the first photograph he took with John.
Sherlock only shrugged, “Close enough,” and he put it back on the shelf. “Ah! Irish whiskey fudge, that shall do for Mycroft.” He said as he noticed this new item, taking a box of fudge.
Sherlock rolled his eyes in fake annoyance and smiled to himself : his plan to reconquer John was in motion.
John wasn’t the jealous type, not really. Who was he kidding, of course he was the jealous type. He loved that he was the only person that Sherlock actually liked to spend time with, that he had all his attention. So even If John didn’t want to admit it, It was pissing him off that Sherlock has gone to someone else.
“I never saw you around, are you here on holidays?” The woman asked, making conversation.
John sighed and suppress the urge to roll his eyes. He walked over the genius and took the phone out. It was a text message from Mycroft.
“Me too.” Sherlock admitted, “This is not really my area.”
“Wait, you were playing that music?” John asked amazed.
“What are you taking?” John asked after a moment.
At the end of the afternoon, John got an idea, “Let’s go camping on the beach tonight.”
Sherlock moved his lips to John’s ear where he nibbled a little bit and then nuzzle his neck, leaving a trail of kisses on his way down.
Sherlock didn’t reply to that.
“Stop being so dramatic”
“I’m kind of nervous,” he admitted.
As much as Sherlock loved London, he didn’t disagree with John. He had nothing going on at the moment, no case, no serial murder on the loose, Lestrade was doing fine on his own. In other words, life was dull, his days only fulfilled by experiments as he waited for John to come home from work.
“Anything, Either way, she will be delighted we brought her something, pick randomly.”
“Is that so?” Sherlock turned in order to face John.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but finally agreed. Really he couldn't deny him anything when he used his Watson's charm.
he thought.
When they arrived at the pub minutes later, they sat in a booth in a corner. Greg ordered two pints, and asked Sherlock what this night out was really about.
“John,” He called as John turned around curious while a very confused Lestrade hanged by the door.
"I’m the one who’s going to propose,” John stated firmly.
“Angelo is used to me. He knows that I don’t eat much.”
John looked over and saw Sherlock puppy eyes and lip pout. God, he did know how to play dirty. How could he say no to that. Besides he wasn’t really that mad about it, actually it was quite hot seeing Sherlock being jealous. It showed that he cared and John could never be mad at him for that.
“Nice. very nice.” John commented sarcastically to himself, “Not exactly how I planned this date to go. So what’s the plan?” He asked.
It was a hard blow for John to find out that out of nowhere that the last couple of years had been a lie. His best friend wasn’t actually dead. At first he was angry, full of hatred but also betrayed and hurt.  It took some time for John to finally forgive Sherlock, it wasn’t easy. Punching him in the face was an act of anger, not talking to Sherlock (until he was kidnapped and almost killed in a bonfire) was an act of stubbornness, forgiving him was an act of trust.
Sherlock tried to look nonchalant and shrugged, like it was no big deal.
“Do you have any idea how loud you are being?!” John asked. Steam could almost be seen coming out of his ears.
“I should do it more often then.” Sherlock smiled against John’s lips.
“John, I’m not a child.” Sherlock huffed.
“Fine, just one.” Sherlock took out his cell phone from beside his computer and snapped a quick picture of him and John and sent it to him. The photo was taken so quickly that John had barely the time to blink, even less to pose. “There, done. Can I please go back to work, now?” It was more a statement than a question since Sherlock had already his full attention on his computer.
“Yes, we’ve met. I’m John remember?”
[................]
He loved these moments of quiet and domestic bliss. He crawled into bed and switch off the lights, exhausted from the day he had had. He shifted his pillow and lay on his side, back to Sherlock. He tried to fall asleep but his brain wouldn’t switch off. He sighed and turned around to his other side so he could see Sherlock, still sitting and typing on his phone, unaware of his struggle to find some sleep.
Sherlock (deduced) that the idea came from John colleagues who had for most came home from their summer holidays at the end of July and were “bragging” about it at the clinic.
“Really John? Would I be sitting here if I did?”
“What? No, we’re just talking. Can’t a man and a woman talk without the assumption they are flirting?”
“I know but we barely have any pictures together and we have known each other since primary school. Come on Sherlock.”
“That we got this far?”
John could only blink.
They were at Bart’s searching for a fancy equipment Sherlock needed for a case when John heard a mobile phone go off and lifted an eyebrow.
“You don’t know how much I’m pleased that we could do this.” John said, as their waitress left the table with their orders.
John has been over-stressed for the last few days. Sherlock had assumed it was because of his work at the clinic, or because of their cases but that was not it. It looked like John was hiding something from him, or at least trying.
“Oh no no,” John stopped him, a hand on his lover’s hip, “don’t you dare run away from me.” He said nibbling Sherlock’s shoulder, as his hands started to run across his chest.
Later on, John would carry that same picture inside his left pocket of his army fatigues to remind him that someone was waiting for him to come home.
“You have to eat. That’s the point of a restaurant.” John countered.
“Come on sleepy head, time to wake up.” John said in a happy tone.
A few days later, Sherlock was pacing in front of the entrance door of their building, besides the mailing boxes, waiting for John to come back from wherever he might have been. He couldn’t even be sure that John was out but given the time of the day and the fact that it was Wednesday, there was a big probability that the would come back soon or later.
“I didn’t want you to forget me,” his voice was raspy, almost as if he was about to cry. John kept stroking his face.
“I’m not sulking, I’m reading.” Sherlock protest, turning a page that he had clearly not read.
“Or you won’t have any of this delicious breakfast that I just made.” he teased.
“Say cheese,” John said smiling before snapping a picture.
“Huh,” he was quite lost for words, “Yes, I mean no you didn’t disturb me much, just a little bit...I mean, it’s okay. I was listening and I just wondered what’s the music playing on your stereo. I find it quite relaxing. I read instrumental music is the best type to keep you focus while studying. And I thought, er...I might use your playlist, I mean if you are willing to share of course...” He rambled.
He tried to regain his focus back in order to study but his mind kept being distracted by his encounter with the man. It was the only thing he could think about. He wondered what he could be doing at the moment. Was he in his bed? Maybe thinking about John?
“Yes, he says when you are around I am less of a..”
So here they were on their first day on the beach, lazying around on their sunbeds, sunglasses on. John was applying some sunblock onto his legs, arms and chest while Sherlock was busy looking around, deducing their surroundings.
It had been a busy day at the yard. Hell, a busy week for Lestrade. He was currently standing in his office, wrapping some paperwork in order to finally go home for the day, as a figure stepped into his open office without knocking. Greg looked up from his desk at the  intruder.
By some point John dropped his head onto Sherlock shoulder, nuzzling his coat, his arm around his waist, full of affection and love. Sherlock would roll his eyes at his thoughts, calling him a Romantic, but he wouldn’t care less. They were on their first holidays as a couple, they were on a boat watching the sunset, how could it not be romantic?
“Sofa, just across the hall.”
“Oh,” Sherlock said, eyes wide open. He couldn't realise how blind he had been all this time. Of course, he was going to propose, what else could it be? Sherlock, only saw but didn't observe. It was proof that sentiment clouds your judgment. Though, He didn't mind it if it meant he would have John Watson by his side for the rest of his life.
“You know, you could help me pack.” John said folding a pair of jeans and putting it in his suit case which was laying open on their bed.
[................]
“Come on Sherlock, just one selfie, Please,”John begged his best friend. They were in their room, studying, well at least one of them was studying. John was on Sherlock’s bed while the curly-haired boy was currently at his desk, typing on his computer, his back turned to John.
“arse?” John completed for him, smirking.
“Jawwwwwn.”
As they got out of the harbour, the Roscoff beach near by they decided to eat lunch at the beach. They found a small café and ordered easily, enjoying the warm weather that was very unusual here. Apparently, they had decided to take their week off when Ireland was having a heat wave, this being their hottest summer in 22 years. The beach was full of people enjoying the weather, the kids running around, some playing football, others building a sand castle.
“You? wanting to take a  picture?” John’s face showed how surprised he was of this odd demand.
“Good to know,” John said eating the last bite of his lasagna and smiling.
“That’s where you are wrong John, for you, I would do anything. And it’s not that bad, I get to enjoy you in either swim trunks or naked, who am I to complained?”
“Is that the same reason you kept all the articles of the newspaper with our photos?”
“Yeah, well, too bad because I’m only into you, now shut up and give me my ice cream before it melts.”John said grabbing his ice cream from Sherlock’s hands, a bit pissed by his reaction.
So Holiday trip was a go. Sherlock in his excitement, offered to plan the trip to John’s amazement, to which he didn’t refuse. He just demanded that Sherlock would decide the dates soon enough so that he could ask for days off at work.
Lestrade gave them a final look and sighed, “Fine, tomorrow morning 10 A.M. sharp.” and then left them to be, walking toward a colleague.
Furthermore, John has been avoiding all physical contact with sherlock which isn’t normal. To Sherlock’s dismay, John was a cuddler and loved physical contact, a kiss on the forehead when handing Sherlock his tea, a hand on his back, a soft grip on his shoulder… And even though Sherlock complains when John cuddles with him in bed, he secretly loves it. John provides him safety and if Sherlock is honest with himself he’s been missing it.
Time froze, as did the two of them. Greg was trying really hard to become invisible.
John drift closer, and wrapped his right arm around Sherlock’s middle and nuzzled his hair, breathing in his shampoo that brought him comfort, it felt like home. John dropped a small kiss on the back of Sherlock’s neck and already felt better and tired enough to fall asleep. He hummed of happiness. His hand slipped under Sherlock’s shirt and set down on Sherlock’s belly, moving up and down in soft light strokes.
“Because it’s my birthday?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes but couldn’t help to smiled stupidly at the possibilities behind John’s words.
“You clearly have been shopping, but I see no bag so I wonder where you could have put it…” He trailed off, gathering his thoughts. suddenly Sherlock got up.
“Hey,”
“I thought you worked together,” John stated rather than asked.
“Yes of course.” The stranger bent his head as if guilty, “Again I apologize.” His eyes met John’s and the former could swear the time stopped for a while.
“Sherlock!” John protested but soon Sherlock cut him by kissing him and grasping John by his shirt, drawing him closer so that they could lie on the bed, with John on top of Sherlock.
Sherlock took his phone out and handed it to John, while the blond wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and with his other arm he tries to reach out as far as he could to get them both on the picture. They were wearing their graduation gown and cap, they looked young and happy. Life was only starting for them and they were onto a wild adventure that was adult life.
“You know there was a good reason I wanted you to leave right?” Kevin starts.
“You wanted to see me Mr. Holmes?” John asks and the man nods, gesturing at the chair on the other side of the desk.
“No go ahead.” John says.
“Everyone. They’re gone.” Sherlock voice is low and soft. John puts an arm around him, pulling the man closer. John can feel him shivering more then himself and he gives Sherlock the rest of his clothes so he can get dressed. Sherlock puts on the clothes very slowly and John just watches him getting dressed. When Sherlock is done he grabs the man’s hands.
Suddenly Sherlock gets up, placing the cup on the table and walks up to John. Standing really close. John wants to take a step back, but for some reason couldn’t. He looks up to meet Sherlock’s eyes (he actually has to look up. This man was too damn tall.). Sherlock stares back at him before he finally speaks.
"Can't wait to get to know them better." He smiles and his eye fall on a door in the corner of the room. It has a big 'STAY OUT' sign on it.
Sherlock grabs a sheet and covers the body with it. The red from the blood starts staining the white sheet quickly. Sherlock takes the gun away from John and puts it back in his backpack together with the other stuff. He walks over to John and kneels down next to him.
Sherlock spends the rest of the evening staring at the phone. John managed to get him in bed but of course the phone had to come along. John falls asleep quickly but Sherlock refuses to.
Greg seems to think about that for a while. “Not sure… He is in on Sundays, but it can be that he has already gone home.”
Sherlock looks at John and asks “Are you coming with me?” John looks at Sherlock then Thomas and eventually back to Sherlock before nodding. He wants to get up but gets stopped by the little boy grabbing his arm. “You’re not leaving already are you? Don’t leave big bro…” The boy seems to be on the edge of tears and John gulps. He looks over at Sherlock who is waiting for him and he sighs, picking up the boy.
I have so struggles with the fic rn so i won't be updating often. I need to get my mind back to it.
So when they arrive at bakerstreet they’re not only wet but also extremely cold. John put on a nice warm fire while Sherlock is taking off his clothes. John does the same till they’re both in just their pants.
“Well I’ll take a look then.” John says with a smile. “How about Chinese another time?”
“Excuse me?”
“What happened…?” He asks and Sherlock just stares at him before softly mumbling. “They’re gone. Everyone is gone.”John pulls him along, out of the freezing cold water.
“This should do it.” He then says. “Try to not get it wet.” Sherlock simply nods and walks away, towards John’s bedroom. John makes him a cup of tea. Just when he was about to go to the bedroom Sherlock comes out of it. Wearing John’s clothes. John looks surprised, but doesn’t comment on it and gives Sherlock the cup. John’s clothes were a bit too small for Sherlock, however he doesn’t seem to care. He takes the cup with a soft thanks and walks past John to the living room. John follows him and leans against the door frame.
“Hey.” The guy says but John doesn’t reply. He just looks at the man.
“I don’t want you to go…” John whispers and just when he says that Sherlock dives in the water. A faint light is visible and then nothing. John keeps standing there, starring at the water for what seems like an eternity. He then walks back a bit, picks up Sherlock's clothes and he sits down on a rock. He holds the clothes close to his body while keeping his eyes fixed on the sea.
“See you later.” He says as he quickly walks out and starts running towards the beach. The rain falls hard on his face and sometimes there’s a strong wind, stopping him for a moment. But Jim keeps making his way to the beach where Sebastian is already waiting. Jim stops next to him and looks up at the other guy with a smile. Sebastian just looks down at him before looking back at the sea. The waves are getting really high. Jim has to takes some steps back so the water won’t fill his boots. Sebastian just keeps standing where he was. He was taller than Jim and so his boots are higher.
John holds his breath for a couple of seconds and tries to hold his calm. “Why?” He asks in the most calm voice he can put on right now. “I wanted to see your father.” Sherlock answers and before John could react he continues. “Don’t worry, I didn’t make contact with him. But I did notice this.” Sherlock grabs some papers from his backpack and hands them over to John.
"What is in there?" He points at the door and Greg follows his gaze.
“Well I should be off to work. Maybe I’ll see you around.” And with that she waves John and Kevin goodbye and leaves.
“It doesn’t work like that.” Sherlock randomly says. And John looks up.
The boy holds up the bag. “Uhm… Your order sir. That will be 18.95 then.” John takes the bag, placing it on the cabinet.
Holy shit i updated.. that took forever. I'm in my exam year so it'll take me some time to get back to this sorry :,)
“Okay, then how do I know you won’t kill me after I give you this.” John asks, not taking his eyes off from the creature who starts to sigh.
John then remembers why he was here and grabs the necklace from his pocket, letting it dangle before him. The creature’s eyes become bigger and he rises from the water. However John is quicker and he stands up, getting the necklace out of reach for him.
“There were some things I had to sort out John. I couldn’t involve you in them."
They finish the fish together and the day went by normal. It appears that Greg does not know what John had done the night before. And it’s best if he doesn’t know.
“I was planning on meeting up with Moriarty.” Mycroft says and before John could ask who that was he continued. “He was the one who caught and sold Sherlock to me. I could ask him if he has more. However I won’t have the money to buy them all back.”
“What kind of people?"
“I’ve seen people use them and heard about what they could do. But I never got my hands on one.” His eyes dart over the blue screen as if he was reading something. John gets up from his chair and walks up behind Sherlock. He leans on the back of the chair while looking at the screen over Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock was opening various programs and then closing them again.
“I… I never told anyone before.” John says and he finally looks Sherlock in the eyes. He’s pretty close, John thought. But it felt nice, it felt save.
Sherlock lets out a chuckle and John can feel his cheek warm up again. Why are his cheeks getting warm? Yes the man was gorgeous, but he can also be very dangerous. John can be risking his life here talking to the guy. Also, he is not gay. John has never been with a man and he isn't planning to be.
John kisses him. “Thank you” He says and they walk out. There is a white van with some guys standing in front of it. Sherlock walks up to them and talks with them for a while then gives them his backpack before walking back. “They’re going to fix it.” John looks over at the men who are now entering the house. They look quite normal. Like someone you can bump into in the supermarket or your next door neighbor.
“Of course I’m right. I just had to throw away five kilo of fish!” Greg responds and shakes his head.
“Dry up?”
“Why tell me?” Sherlock asks and John shrugs. “It just… happened."
Sherlock grabs him by hip, pulling him closer against him. “Why don’t you just think about it for a while~?” He whispers in John’s ear before wrapping his arm around him and nestling his head above Johns. John closes his eyes. He takes a deep breath and all he can smell was Sherlock. And a faint scent of fish. John chuckles, puts his arm around Sherlock’s waist and falls asleep again.
“Don’t think about it too much. It has happened and now I’m almost free.” He gives a small smile. Just a twitch of the corner of his mouth. John takes his hand and gets up.
He looked up to see his boyfriends head above his.
“You’re done, fully protect against the UV rays.”
“Hi there,” he said with all his white teeth showing.
“Come on don’t sulk.” John said, sensing he was upset.
“You silly man.” John draw Sherlock’s face to him, brushing his lips against the genius asking for permission. “How could I ever forget you?" And then he kissed him deeply.
“John?” Sherlock called, his silence making him panicking, “John, you still with me?”
“Most of them anyway.”
John was busy doing his crosswords on his newspaper while Sherlock was building a castle in the sand with a few kids that they had encounter earlier in the day. Sherlock being himself took charge of the parameters and architecture of the castle, giving them instructions on how to build the most efficient castle with the right amount of wet sand and the best way to take off the bucket to make sure the Castle wouldn’t fall down.
“John is ignoring me.” The genius stated in his neutral voice.
“Can we cuddle?” John asked in a small voice.
For their fourth day, they decided to stick to the beach, after all, it wasn’t often that they had this weather or the beach near for them to enjoy it. So it was a lazy day under the sun and the casual exercise of swimming in the ocean.
Taking the matter into his own hands, he snapped Sherlock’s phone and without a second thought sat on his best friend’s lap. He opened the camera app and took his time to take several pictures. Ones where he was smiling at the camera, others making silly faces, trying to make Sherlock smile (and partly succeeding).
That earned John only a moaned as Sherlock turned away, trying to go back to sleep, hogging the covers.
“No.”
“Love, it says Gavin.”
“We’ll eat out, I know an Italian place, the owner owes me a favour, the food is great and after dinner, we’ll come back to my place and I’d play for you. What do you think?”
“I really hate you right now for having your way.” John confessed, stripping Sherlock’s shirt off his body.
Reaching the door, Sherlock stopped in his tracks suddenly, as he had an epiphany.
John smiled at Sherlock’s words, “Oh yes, a very long night indeed. Better gather some strength,” he kissed Sherlock on the corner of his mouth and stood up to gathering their stuff together in order to leave.
John frowns. “Excuse me?” He asks and Sherlock says it again. “I’m sorry. For disappearing and everything that has happened. I know I can never fully make it up with you but I want to try. Could I come over later please?” Sherlock asks and John sighs. “You can come after 11PM. Everyone should be gone by then.” Sherlock nods and once again holds out the present for John. This time John takes it. “It’s not much but I hope you like it.” Sherlock says and with a short goodbye he turns around and walks away. John looks at him till he’s completely out of sight and then returns back inside. He places the gift on the cabinet before returning back inside.
Kevin sighs and sits down. “It was yea. He hasn’t come back in a while.”
John gives Sherlock a couple more strokes before letting go. Sherlock lifts his hips just a bit, looking for contact. But when he finds none he opens his eyes. John reaches out behind him and grabs a pillow from his chair. Sherlock lifts up his hips and John places the pillow underneath him.
“What’s this now? You got yourself a boyfriend~"
“Father is taking a trip.” His mother says with a smile. “Oh.” Says the boy. “So no more beatings..?” He asks softly and John shakes his head. “He will never hurt you again."
John makes his way over to the bathroom and locks the door behind him. He sighs in relief before taking off his shirt. He turns on the shower and slowly pushes down his trouser, biting his lip. He kicks them off and looks at the scars on his thighs. Sherlock sat on them the whole time and his jeans were rubbing against them. He noticed one of them has start to bleed again so John quickly takes off his pants and gets in the shower. The water stings when he runs over the scars and John slowly cleans them up.
“Happy birthday John.” He says but John doesn’t take the present.
“John speakin-”
“Please…” Sherlock says while shivering and John walks to the bathroom to get him some towels. When he walks back Sherlock has already taken off all his clothes except for his pants. John slightly blushes and gives the boy the towels. Sherlock thanks him and dries his hair while walking into Kevin’s room. He comes back not much later wearing Kevin’s shirt and the towel hanging around his neck.
“A coffee.” Kevin says, not looking John in the eyes. “And a tea for me please.” Molly adds with a smile. John just walks away and starts preparing the order when Molly walks up to the counter. “John..?” She asks and John turns around.
Sherlock breaks the kiss and goes for John’s neck. “You know.” He whispers while he slowly slides his heads underneath John’s shirt. “I’m no longer underaged now.” John starts to blush. “W-what?” he asks softly and Sherlock looks at him with a grin. “How about I give you a real present hm?” The boy says with a soft purr in his voice. John blinks a couple of times as Sherlock pulls his own shirt over his head. Sherlock leans back down to kiss him and starts unbuttoning John’s trousers.
