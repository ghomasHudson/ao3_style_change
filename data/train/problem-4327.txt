“Excuse me,” Dean turned around to see an elderly woman smiling indulgently at them. Apparently a heart-to-heart in the middle of a grocery store involved blocking an entire set of shelves. Dean stumbled over an apology, but the woman waved him off.
Cas shook his head. “I think it’s wonderful, Dean. I particularly liked the entry ‘Cas’s ass’. Very flattering.”
“Sam, you really don’t have to—”
shouldn’t have let him drink. I shouldn’t have pushed him so hard, I shouldn’t have made him think he owed us or the world anything.”
Something about Cas’s tone made Dean pause. “Why is it bothering you that you couldn’t remember? I forgot where his pacifier was last week and you didn’t think it was this big of a deal.”
They sat there for a moment, the room silent but for Jack’s gentle breathing through the baby monitor. Cas hand paused combing through Dean’s hair and Dean lifted his head from Cas’s shoulder questioningly.
Sam calls as often as he can, as working part-time as the unofficial head of the hunter HQ at the bunker while trying to finish his law degree at a local university means Dean sees his face less often then he'd like.
An hour and three awkward explanations later, Dean was sending the confused former-meatsuit on his way home right as the morning light began to peek over the horizon and bathe the muted ashy tones of the porch in gold.
Dean closed the remaining few inches between them. Cas's lips were perpetually chapped but their softness today indicated Claire convinced him to put on some chapstick. Dean smiled into Cas's mouth when he realized that it was cherry-flavored.
Cas shot him an unimpressed look and Dean tamped down the urge to squirm under his gaze, trying to give Cas room to say what he needed to.
“Yeah!” Jack chimed in from behind them. Dean turned to see Jack holding out a soggy cheerio and he stepped back, trying to negotiate with the kid.
Sometimes the sky just looked pretty and he sat on the floor in front of the window and watched as the stars glittering above.
Cas laughed and also got up, arms wrapping around Dean’s waist. “I can’t help it. I don’t have my grace to heat me up anymore.” He gave Dean a look resembling a kicked puppy but Dean rolled his eyes.
The breeze was strong enough that Dean hiked down to the shore and to pick up a few sizable rocks to hold down the corners of the picnic blanket Cas had brought out for the table. The damp dirt sunk slightly under his boots as he paused to watch a mother duck float by with her ducklings in a neat line. Dean pulled out his phone and snapped a photo to send to Jody with the caption
Cas continued, "For example, your father here is fondling the fertilizer I placed there yesterday, another example of the cycle of life."
“Yeah,” Cas paused. “We shouldn’t have let him drink. He was still just a child.” Cas looked off over the lake, his face awash in the glow from the morning light reflecting off the surface. The breeze ruffled his hair and Dean’s heart ached.
For once, they had all the time in the world.
“Um, are there supposed to be paper bags on that plant?”
Living above ground had its perks but the unpredictability of the flora and fauna and weather and dirt had Dean regularly reconsidering his stance on moving out of the bunker, and this was not helping.
Cas hesitated and Dean ran a hand up and down his spine, offering some semblance of comfort. “Why aren’t there any people on your list? I went through it twice but there’s no ‘Sam’, no ‘Jack’, no ‘Eileen’”. The
The room was silent aside from the distant creaks of Sam moving around upstairs.
He ventured a glance up at Sam’s face, which had melted into a dopey grin. “Dean, that’s so sweet.”
Dean’s jaw dropped. “Oh my god.”
“So you’re pretty well acquainted with my body, huh?” Dean leered at Cas.
“Yeah.” Cas pulled his cardigan tighter around himself, “It’s like we’re mourning someone that’s right in front of us. It feels wrong somehow, to be grieving him when he’s right here.”
Dean had been correct that Jack would start teething soon.
Cas pulled away completely and turned to face Dean. “We had to massage his gums last week, I should have known that this was going to happen, I should've remembered.”
Cas eventually returned and they began the trek back to the entrance and the car. On the way back, Cas suddenly grabbed Dean’s arm and he jumped, adrenaline pumping as Jack made an unhappy noise at being jostled. “Dean.” His voice was so serious that Dean could see Sam’s hand going under his jacket where he usually kept a blade.
Dean was shrugging off his hoodie when Sam asked, “Wait, but don’t the grapes need light to grow?”
“You should really respect your elders.”
But stepping out of the car into the golden field with a folded picnic blanket made it almost worth it. Almost. Dean could still picture Jack’s little eyes widening at the view of the stream and vast expanse of rolling hills that seemed to extend for as far as he could see. A familiar windmill was standing near the stream but Cas took them in the opposite direction.
“This was really bothering you, huh?” Cas burrowed his head further into Dean’s chest and he took that as an affirmative. He extended the arm on Dean’s chest over to Jack, who grinned and rolled over onto his chest and half-crawled his way to his dads.
After a shower and a too-hot cup of coffee that had him swearing under his breath, Dean ventured outside, the morning air stinging his cheeks. His nose would be bright red within a few minutes, so Cas would be sure to make fun of him. Dean grinned at the thought.
Dean’s chest warms with a feeling he was becoming familiar with, with how he felt when he first kissed Cas, how he feels when he sees Cas holding his child—
“No,” The firmness in Cas’s tone surprised Dean. “This, all of this, is worth it. Besides, it was never that simple, even with my grace. I’d like to think it was but,” Cas sighed. “It was always a fucking mess wasn’t it?”
Cas, who had apparently ducked under it, giggled at him.
“I—well,” Cas wrung his hands together. “It’s not the first thing I’ve forgotten.”
*        *        *
“Don’t encourage her!”
Dean shook his head loose from Cas’s hand and reached out, Cas answering by depositing Jack into his waiting arms and pecking Dean on the head.
Then Cas opened the box and Dean’s breath caught.
Claire shrugged, “Cas told me you were making lasagna. Also,” She looked off over the lake and took a breath. “Kaia and I had a fight. I think.”
“So, you wanna talk about it?”
“You’re not gonna make this easy for me, huh?”
Dean had never quite noticed the sunrise before they moved into the lakehouse. He had seen plenty. With a man as erratic as John Winchester setting their schedules it was inevitable, the days bleeding into each other, a cycle of chips and soda with teeth that went unbrushed and hair left uncombed. The sunrise was nothing special when you barely had a moment to breathe.
Jack had finally gone down for his afternoon nap once his fever broke and Dean was in the mood to turn his brain off. Which is why it took a second to register Cas calling from atop the staircase, “Dean, where’s the Rubiks cube?”
Cas attempted to school his face into neutral expression, but immediately abandoned the effort when Dean just raised his eyebrows. “You know that I think Jack allowing himself to be a child was a good thing.”
Dean nudged his foot with his own. “What’s up?”
Dean was so entranced that he jumped slightly when his vision was met by bright blue eyes. Cas smiled and the tension in Dean’s shoulders melted away.
"Well, maybe I will."
Cas's face scrunched up a little. “I forgot where my keys were this morning. And then I couldn’t find my reading glasses but they were on my face the whole time. Also what time Jack’s doctor's appointment was last week. And—”
Deep, deep, deep down, Dean knew that maybe he was just too broken to raise kids. That maybe no matter how hard he tried the universe wouldn’t let him have one nice thing, that if he relaxed even a little then his precarious vision would come tumbling down, that any gentleness he had was a fluke. He was just waiting for the universe to fix itself.
“Ouch.”
“Do you wanna go home?”
Cas’s face lit up. “Actually, lesbians seem to do that a lot, Eileen sent me at least three videos in which that happens.”
Dean wasn't particularly bothered, as half of his energy was focused on Cas's head bobbing further away from them in the crowd, accompanied by Jack's head which was adorned with a miniature cowboy hat. Cas had fought him on the outfit but even he had begrudgingly admitted that Jack looked adorable in his little vest and cowboy boots.
"The heart-shaped ones?"
Dean blood chilled. “What do you mean?”
“She was a bitch!”
"Ugh, I can't believe it took a baby to make you wake up at a normal time."
The leaves crunched under his boots as he made his way around the back of the house to the corner Cas had taken over with the fruits of his labor. Quite literally in some senses.
“How’s Claire?” While their conversations were private, Dean still wanted to know she was okay. She’d been through a lot, most of which she wouldn’t even tell them.
“It’s supposed to be a gratitude thing. About things you like about life and being alive and it’s supposed to make you appreciate stuff you might not think about that often. I don’t know, it sounds stupid, but it’s been helping. I think.”
Dean’s voice was rough when he asked, “So you regret it? Giving it up?”
Cas stared at Dean and for a brief moment Dean felt the weight of the millenia the man before him had lived. He could see the wings and ire and pain and grandiosity of it all. Then the light shifted and he dissolved back into a dude in a frumpy sweater who got annoyed when he was woken up before 9 AM.
Cas pursed his lips in an unimpressed look. “Dean, you must know gender is of no consequence to me.”
“It’s just like him to name a kitten and escape immediately. What’d he decide on?”
Dean’s eyes traced over his kid’s face, the pudgy cheeks and long lashes, the pink lips parted slightly as Jack’s breathing steadied. He jumped when he felt Cas’s hand on his arm, who was clearly fighting a laugh as he pulled Dean out of the nursery and flicked off the light switch.
Cas laughed at something Sam said. "Jack's up right now actually. Do you wanna say hi?"
They eventually caught up with Cas, who immediately shoved a small sample spoon in Dean’s direction. Dean winced at the excessive sweetness while Cas paid for two jars. Jack reached for Sam’s sample and Dean grabbed his wrist. “Sorry buddy, no honey.”
*        *        *
Dean turned so he and Cas were face-to-face, noses brushing ever so slightly. “Do you wanna try or nah?”
*        *        *
“That’s bullshit and you know it.”
Dean yelped when Cas’s mouth descended onto his dick a moment later.
“I forgot the teething stuff. I tried everything else and it didn’t even occur to me—”
Cas picked up his fork but something still irked Dean. “Why did you stay then? If you knew that I was a mess.”
Dean looked at Jack, his wide blue eyes confused at the sudden silence. His son. Imagined the hand holding his little torso with a ring on it.
Cas crossed his arms. ‘Well, I saw you first.”
that I don’t require parental love to be able to give it to another person, and I know older Jack was alright, but,” his eyes darted around as Dean’s hands moved to cup his face. “How do I know I’m not ruining his life until years later. Kids carry trauma, Dean, you and Sam are a prime example of that.”
Cas raised a single eyebrow.
"I didn't know anything else," Dean could barely make out Cas's eyes as they locked gazes. "Until I had you."
Dean pushes open the front door and glances at his reflection in the window. His grin rivals Cas's from earlier. He looks.
Cas’s face clears up. “Ah, that makes sense. I wouldn’t have left a scar on your body when I recreated it.”
Dean’s hand brushed the velvet box he was looking for. “Got it!” He spun around and attempted to sink down onto one knee, and instead quickly collapsed, his legs no longer accustomed to quick movements after almost nine months of quiet nights in and early morning feedings.
Sam didn’t respond, and when Dean looked over at him questioningly he saw a surprised look on his face. “Wow, you really researched this huh?”
Sam chimed in, “Do you think it’s a side effect of losing your grace?” The frightened look on Cas’s face indicated he’d clearly thought about it.
“Cas, is this really the ti—wait, really?” Dean craned his head up from the pillow as Cas tilted his head.
"Shit!" A sizzling noise filled the room as Dean rushed to turn down the pot of boiled-over milk which was spreading rapidly across the stove top. He hissed as he burnt his fingertips and Cas appeared next to him with paper towels. After they sopped up the mess together Cas led Dean to the sink to hold his burnt finger under running water.
Cas’s answer was muffled by Dean’s sweatshirt.
"That's the cycle of life. Even if it's not very nice. But living on earth means we have to respect all life, even if it inconveniences us sometimes."
Jack just held his hand out more insistently. “Yeah!”
“Dean, I know.”
"The milk—"
"Mmm-hmm?"
If Jack's been in a good mood, he's already been put to bed. If not, well.
“You good?” Cas’s eyes cracked open at the sound of Dean’s voice, a small smile on his lips.
A few hours later Dean very slowly wrote
“Actually, the left lung is typically smaller than the right.”
"It was 8 in the morning, you asshole." Dean dodged a runaway toddler as Sam groaned.
Cas, against all odds, blushes, nervously bouncing an oblivious Jack.  "Um. Yes. I would." He takes a deep breath and looks at Dean shyly, "I'd like that. Very much. I just didn't know if you were—if you ever thought about it."
Oblivious to Dean's emotional upheaval Cas shrugged and continued, "Of course, I would still like to murder your father. I know we said no violence but I think we could 'let it slide.'" Cas mimed little quotation marks, making Dean laugh and lean over to kiss him on his temple, his cheek, the tip of his nose.
Dean made a strangled noise, torn between laughing at the sudden declaration of violence and listening to Cas voice a sentiment he himself had thought secretly in his darkest moments of shame.
“I do have a question, though.”
"Sam, hold on. Hey buddy," Dean put the phone on the ground as he pulled a sobbing Jack out of Cas's arms. Jack snuggled into his shoulder, muffling his crying. Dean vaguely registered Cas picking up the phone and greeting Sam.
So, when Jack came to Cas and said he wanted to “experience life, but for real”, he was met with ample support. He didn’t seem too bothered that Dean had been trying to make out with Cas right before Jack made his request.
“You don’t sound surprised.”
Dean rolled his eyes and stood from the bed, arms stretching and mouth opening in a jaw-cracking yawn. Cas’s hand wormed it’s way into the space where Dean’s shirt rode up, placing his palm flat on Dean’s bare back and making him yelp. “Hey! Why are your hands always so fucking cold?”
Dean rotated in the circle of Cas’s arms and tucked his face into Cas’s neck, shivering as a delicate kiss was placed upon his neck.
Sam and Dean exchanged a look. “Well,” Dean said. “What have you forgotten?”
Sam rolled his eyes at the accusatory tone in Dean's voice. "Listen, I didn't know you guys did this stuff on Saturdays or whatever. How was I supposed to know to wake up at 5 in the damn morning?"
“That’s real sweet of you Jack, but uh,”
“Ew! That's my dad!” Claire smacked Dean’s arm and he gasped dramatically while she glared at him.
“Mmm-hmm.”
“Wait Cas hold on,” Sam interjected. “Is it just little stuff? No huge chunks of time missing? Not entire days or anything crazy?”
and she said sometimes it’s easier to get the words out, even if no one reads it. So, yeah,” He finished lamely.
The truth is, Dean couldn't stop thinking about it. He'd long since placed marriage in a box in his head loudly labelled 'for other people'. After Cassie, he shoved the parts of him that were too soft for the hardened world around him deep down, and even Lisa hadn't fully reopened the chasm in his mind. But now.
Cas walked over to a tree with adequate shade and stood patiently, waiting for Dean to spread the blanket for Cas to finally set the basket down on. It was a stereotypical red and white checkered blanket, and Dean smiled to himself, wondering if Cas had googled the correct blanket to bring on a picnic date with your baby daddy.
They broke apart and Dean asked, “Wait, can I tell Cas?”
Dean scooped him up and Jack snuggled his head on Dean’s chest, the warm bath making him sleepy. The hall was dark and Dean could hear Claire on the phone in her room, voice muffled by the closed door. He made his way into Jack’s nursery, where he found Cas in the rocking chair, skimming through Goodnight Moon. Dean put a finger over his mouth as an indication to be quiet and slowly lowered Jack into his crib. He held his breath as the baby fought to keep his eyes open, and then sighed as he slowly blinked a bit longer, then finally closed, succumbing to his exhaustion.
Cas considered this for a moment, chewing a piece of bacon as he did so. He swallowed and said, “I think loving someone just kind of makes you stupid. For so long I hadn’t wanted anything. And when I found you I would’ve done anything to keep you.” Cas glanced at Jack and back at Dean almost defiantly. “But I don’t think I would do it again. No matter how old he looked.”
"You've got poop on your hand."
“And I was worried I wouldn't find them. I wanted my people. My family. The other angels could probably tell—Naomi could definitely tell—even when I didn't know that’s what I wanted.” He looks into the distance for a moment, lost in thought. Dean rubs a thumb across the back of Cas’s hand, unsure how to comfort him.
The silence that met the statement had Dean accusingly point the spatula at Cas’s faux innocent expression. “I can’t believe you would betray me like this.”
Dean almost forgot about how uncomfortable he was in the light of the carefree noise from Cas, but then a bee buzzed by and Dean swore violently,
Cas seemed unable to make eye contact and Dean was struck with the sudden thought that Cas was breaking up with him. Cas looked up and seemed to read that on his face, as he grabbed Dean’s hand and said seriously, “Dean, this isn’t something bad.” Which calmed Dean down, but not by a lot.
He also didn’t think he could handle another incident of Claire embellishing Cas’s hair with sparkly blue clips that had complemented his wide eyes when he asked Dean how it looked.
Dean’s disjointed explanation didn’t feel adequate to Dean’s own ears but Cas was beaming. “Don’t you see, Dean? You
“What?” Cas pointed to the side of the market aisle, and Dean followed his gaze, expecting a vampire, or a werewolf, or a demon, or some other creature they somehow hadn’t encountered yet.
“It’s nothing, it’s really not a big deal—”
They could go to the lake and have pizza while watching Tangled later that night. Or maybe Cas wanted to have breakfast for dinner again and they could watch Breaking Bad after Jack fell asleep. They could possibly even video call with Sam and Jody and have a virtual family dinner. Maybe Jack would finally figure out how to say ‘Eileen’ instead of giving up after ‘El’.
"You are so much more than John Winchester. Not because you happen to be different, but because you
*        *        *
At Dean’s blank stare he elaborated, “Like Ruth Bader Ginsberg.”
Dean nodded, leaning over into Cas, who let go of his hand and draped his arm over Dean’s shoulder, hand straying to the unruly hairs at the nape of Dean’s neck. “I started with journal entries but I couldn’t get the words to sound like what I needed them to. But I knew the lists helped so I just kept going.”
Dean crossed his arms and grumbled under his breath, “The movie theater wouldn’t have had this many bugs.”
“No! I mean not
Cas peers up from between Dean’s legs with a look of concern. “From a hunt?”
“That is not remotely how that happened.”
*        *        *
He waited apprehensively as Cas pulled himself together. “Dean,” He paused,then started again. “Dean. Hello.”
He turned to see Sam looking at him with soft eyes, and immediately faced forward, ears burning.
Cas squinted. “Actually, I was the one who got down on one knee, so by that logic I was first.”
Cas laughed behind him and Dean smiled, grabbing one of the treats for Ruth, who ate it neatly and meowed in thanks. He turned back to the stove, carefully arranging the finished eggs atop the plate of pancakes he had already made, bacon on the side.
*        *        *
The nature of raising a child meant that Dean and Cas had managed to go on a total of three dates so far. It was a delicate dance, usually involving Sam and Eileen driving over to pick up Jack, hours of inevitable anxiety that Jack had somehow gotten grievously injured, and the date cut short with Jack back in their arms. Sam was relatively happy to field the concerned calls and take Jack for the night, since he maintained that even an eight-month-old child was less annoying than Dean and Cas when they were unable to keep their hands to themselves.
“Didja wake me up jus’ for this?” Cas’s gravelly voice was offset by annoyance, but Dean had other priorities.
As Dean strained his neck to watch, Cas hit the banker-wearing demon on the back of the skull and the base of the spine in two quick movements, knocking him out into a slumped pile on the kitchen floor. Cas then yawned wide enough that his jaw cracked, walked over to the bookshelf in the hallway, and pulled out a tiny pamphlet, tossing it onto Dean’s chest where he was still laying across the table.
As Dean reached up to grab the fancy pasta sauce the woman needed from the top shelf, he replayed the comment in his mind. He hadn’t felt young in so long. Even without his forty-year detour to hell, life had felt like one fucking disaster after another. But to an old lady with no context, he was just some guy with his boyfriend and kid with a lot of life left to live.
Jack yelled, “Dada!” and dropped an applesauce covered spoon onto the floor. Dean groaned loudly but continued dancing at the stovetop, the song changing and his bopping increasing with the tempo.
Dean placed his hand on the counter and leaned back, hearing the soft clink of his engagement ring against the countertop. He smiled softly.
Dean pushed off the doorframe and ventured into the room, making his way to a cross legged position on the floor in front of Cas and the now-dozing Jack. Cas’s hand found his hair. Eyes slipping closed, Dean recounted, “I texted Sam. He says that Rowena says that there was a random breach in hell and the demon probably just spawned somewhere around here, so it’s not like we were being targeted.”
The fact that they had called each other three times a day the first week Dean and Cas moved out also brings up the concern that perhaps they were more codependent than was normal. Dean just misses him. A lot.
Before Cas could say Jack was actually four entire years old Dean jumped in, “He’ll be seven months in a week. Probably gonna start teething soon.”
The wind had started up in the time they had spent looking for Ruth, cutting at their faces as the duo trudged their way back to the house. Dean unzipped his hoodie so Ruth could climb in next to his warmth, and then zipped it back up, supporting her body enough so her little face was poking out the front of the jacket. Sam laughed loudly and waved a hand so Dean would stop and let him take a picture.
No one was particularly thrilled about this occurrence.
*        *        *
, his mind supplied giddily. There were birds chirping and the stream distantly gurgling and the sun beating down through the sparse tree layer they had seated themselves under. The ground was cold and the wind was warm and his angel was in front of him, right where he was supposed to be.
Cas smiled humorlessly. “You’re right. You shouldn’t have behaved like that. You shouldn’t have treated Jack, or me, or even Sam the way you did most of the time.” He leaned forward as Dean held his breath. “But have you considered that perhaps dwelling so heavily in the past is only going to keep you trapped there?”
“Meow.”
Dean grinned and patted his stomach while wiggling his eyebrows.
It wasn’t actually Dean’s fault that most of the town thought that they were married.
Helplessly he'd said, "You've got me. For as long as you want."
“I’m gonna beat your ass.”
And if
“But—“
“Like you’re in love with me.”
But now Dean had to dodge not one, but two fuzzballs weaving between his legs when he tried to do pretty much anything, one jet black and the other black with gray and orange splotches. Claire had been thrilled to know that they were both girls, though she attempted to appear indifferent and only cooed at them when she thought no one else was in the room. Dean had video evidence on his phone though, and was very excited to use it as blackmail next time she sent the group chat that video of Dean crying while watching Mamma Mia.
His mind goes to Sam and his righteous fury when he left for college. He thinks about Ben accusing him of betrayal. He thinks about a world-hardened Claire. He even sometimes thinks about Emma, how he never looked for her purgatory, that if it wasn’t for him maybe she could’ve been someone. Maybe he never looked for her because he knew that whatever he touched ended up shattered. And maybe that was the crux of the problem.
while Cas snored next to him.
Dean knew the motions. He could warm milk and change diapers and burp a baby. He was well-equipped.
Then Ruth squirmed and they begrudgingly made their way up the back steps, turning back to take another look. Sam tried to take a picture but complained that it didn't look the same.
Dean had dragged Sam to four ring stores and remained unsatisfied until they had wandered into a pawn shop, Dean’s eyes immediately honing in on the display case. The ring was silver and molded to look like two wings wrapping around the finger wearing it. Before Sam could ask if he was sure, the ring was purchased, placed in a box Claire found online, and tucked into Dean’s jacket, finally seeing the light of day weeks later.
Jack of the present seemed to realize that something was wrong, as he was looking back and forth between his parents, relatively quiet for once. Then he picked up a chunk of banana, and offered it to Cas with a solemn, “Bana.”
Dean’s heart aches. “Cas—”
“Hi.”
Cas sighs and after a moment says, “It stresses me out, forgetting things. I used to have every thought I’ve ever had, every moment of history at my fingertips.” His nose crinkles. “Well, whatever Naomi let me have at the time, I suppose.”
, it felt endless sometimes—but she was just as touch-starved as most hunters. She was always the last to let go of a hug and Dean wanted her to know she could hold on as long as she needed.
Cas’s hands were occupied with a picnic basket as he effortlessly walked through the waist-high weeds, following an indecipherable path he seemed to remember off the top of his head.
"Sam, you don't need a key-holder. How many keys do you even have?" Sam ignored Dean and continued questioning the man running the stand on wood preferences.
This time, Dean stepped forward and gently pulled Cas over to sit on the bed next to Dean. Cas’s legs curled up and he looped his arms around his knees. Dean’s hands hovered over Cas’s clenched hands but he felt as though they had reverted back to the tentative state from right after Cas returned from the Empty, wanting desperately to touch but afraid it was too much or not enough. He decided against it, hands falling back to his sides, the space between them feeling like miles.
do angels even get married? When confronted with the idea that maybe Cas just didn’t want to get married, Dean found it much easier to dismiss the thought altogether, despite what the ache in his chest might say. Not that he cared.
To Dean’s surprise Cas’s smile grew. “Oh, I think Claire will be fine. I think she might be reading too far into her and Kaia’s interactions out of nerves.”
Then Cas spoke, "I think." He paused as if to gather his thoughts. Dean noticed the hand in his hair was trembling and Cas's jaw was clenched in anger. His heart leaped into his throat as Cas continued, "that I would kill John Winchester given the chance."
Cas’s eyes were closed and he was quietly humming what sounded like ‘Walking on Sunshine’. The actual sunshine outside slanted through the cracks in the blinds, dust swirling in the shafts of light, and Dean felt the restlessness from the abrupt awakening dissipate. It was technically his turn on Baby Duty for the night, but Jack had actually slept through for once, the only disturbance being the unfortunate guest they’d had just before dawn.
Dean groaned as he bit into his sandwich, a BLT with the perfect amount of mayo and Cas smiled smugly. Dean had him semi-banned from certain areas of the kitchen after the waffle incident when Jack was three months old, but clearly Cas had been finding a way to practice.
Jack clapped his hands and grinned, straining against Cas's hold to get to Dean. The idea that this little guy saw Dean as someone he wanted to hold him, someone he considered safe made Dean's head spin. Without thinking he reached out his arms only to have Cas snatch Jack back, the infant making a small noise of protest.
“You act like we don’t feed you.”
“So. You remember how I said things got really bad before we got you back? I, well,
“I—I’m sorry Dean, I thought we had talked about this—”
For a few moments the songbirds and distant sound of the forest are the only sounds Dean could hear.
“Yeah, Cas, it’s perfect.” Cas smiled and reached for Dean’s hand, who was the one to snatch his hand back this time.
“Yeah.” Dean said slowly.
Cas hadn’t initially understood Dean’s desire to be this far removed from the rest of civilization but the moment he laid eyes on the blue expanse Cas had gone silent, his eyes wide, and Dean had known that this was the place.
“So Claire—”
“That’s—okay that’s fair actually.” Cas rolled his eyes and held a hand out for Dean to put his into.
“Hey, buddy, c’mon, food isn't for playtime. We’ve talked about this.” Jack looked solemnly at Dean as he got his hands wiped down but then grinned widely, showing off his two bottom teeth that had finally sprouted between weeks of misery and crying. The nine-month old clapped and immediately stuck his hands back in his applesauce concoction.
Cas leaned back against the cabinets. “Yes, it was quite a surprise but I suppose they are adults and clearly they’re infatuated with each other, so—”
Cas’s brows furrowed and Dean quickly backtracked. “Not that you have to, or that it would even help, but you know, Jody gave me a journal back after, you know,
The lump in Dean’s throat made it difficult to speak. “Yeah, I get it. I—There’s—I wish I had spent more time with him, or apologized more, and it feels weird cause he’s right there, but it’s not him.”
It was like all of his senses came rushing back when he finally looked at his boyfriend—
“No, Sam what the—get the fuck off of me you asshole.”
“You guys really made an impression, huh?”
Jack made a snuffling noise and Dean was gently pulled back to the present. A pudgy hand was reaching out and Dean followed it to see fireflies blinking in and out over the grass and the lake beyond, breaking through the gentle fog that was encroaching upon the lake.
He steadfastly ignored Cas’s questioning look and plastered a smile onto his face as the woman said her goodbyes and went on her way.
*        *        *
Cas looked like he was on the verge of passing out, which Dean wasn't sure how to interpret. He took a breath. “I mean, I wish this was happening at the restaurant we were going to later tonight but I guess we don’t always get what we want, huh?”
“Looks like it.”
“Oh, it was a guy who was married to a guy who used to be a hunter. Sam tracked him down. I think Sam might actually still talk to him, but I stopped. Kept up with the list though. It was only supposed to be a few things but I kept thinking of stuff to add.”
“Like, I’m in love with you.”
“Several studies have linked honey to cases of infant botulism, actually.” Cas handed a squirming Jack to Dean as he dug through the backpack Dean was wearing full of baby supplies they took on outings, pulling out a baggie of sliced strawberries. “Let’s find a table.”
Dean ignores the pang in his chest that reminds him that no matter his best efforts, he’d never been able to fully shield Sam from their father. “Cas, we’re going to figure it out, okay? It’s gonna be really hard sometimes but it’s gonna be okay. We’re gonna be fine. Especially considering the fact that we’ve got Sam and Eileen and Jody and a bunker full of teenagers willing to drop everything to help us. Hey—Cas—hey,” He squeezed Cas slightly to regain the faltered eye contact. “Even if you didn’t have me, you’re not alone. Not anymore. In fact, we’re all gonna be annoying as fuck.”
Dean turned his attention to the particular plant Sam was pointing at and realized it was the grape vine. “Oh, the birds were eating the grapes.”
“Hello Jack.” Jack giggles and pulls at Cas’s hair, making him wince. Dean makes a mental note to force Cas into a haircut sometime this week. Apparently Cas felt that growing all that hair out and then cutting it off was wasteful, but until Jack learned to keep his hands from yanking at any dangling object in his vicinity, Dean was enforcing the precaution.
Dean just reached over and put his palm flat on Cas’s back, feeling his breathing. He grinned and turned his face into his pillow, trying to smother the wild fluttering in his stomach. He trailed his finger in the shape of a heart on Cas’s back and eventually drifted off to a dreamless sleep.
When the lady with the strawberry preserve booth at the farmers market remarked that it was a pretty liberal town and that Dean and Cas shouldn't be afraid to wear their wedding rings proudly, Dean only
“Yeah, well,” Dean’s ears burned as he looked down at the floor. “It made Cas happy, so. Yeah.”
Instead, Cas’s finger pointed at a sign that read in neat block letters: FREE KITTENS.
Dean threw his hands in the air and without thinking blurted, "You know what! We're getting a divorce!"
"Cas, you can't—"
"You're the one who got manure on
"Unbelievable! You see Jack? See what I have to put up with."
Cas barely managed to nod and Dean’s eyes slid close from relief, surprised to feel a tear slipping out.
Cas squeezed his hand. “It’s not stupid. I’m really glad that this is working for you. Wait,” Cas gestured at the notebook with his unoccupied hand. “Is this what you were talking about when you said that writing helps you?”
“And you can just...cover them?”
“I was thinking of da Vinci but I suppose those work too.”
“Eggs were on the list of snacks we could give them and I gave it to her before I added salt,” Dean said dismissively, more concerned about, “Wait, Leonardo? Like the ninja turtle? Or diCaprio?”
“Hey, you don’t have to decide right now,” Dean reached over and grabbed Cas’s hand, intertwining their fingers. “We can figure it out later.”
Cas had once told Dean that he hadn't fully understood the concept of needing people until he became human.
Dean’s head fell back against the pillow and he stared up at the ceiling. “Holy fuck.”
“Yeah.”
Dean had been apprehensive about returning to the place he had scattered Cas’s ashes, cringing as he recalled a lot of screaming and sobbing and untoward language towards every deity he could think of.
Cas deadpanned, “Ecstatic. Anyways, if this is normal, I suppose I should just get acclimated to it.”
He would take a photo of Jack on a pile of leaves in the background and not think about Jack having to explain that yes, he had two dads but no, they weren’t married.
“Wha—What’s wrong?”
“Well, I apologize if the idea of you needing a list of reasons to remind you not to get yourself killed might make a rational person ‘freak out’.”
Other times Cas would wake up hard and wanting and Dean had no problem sacrificing some sleep to watch Cas come undone in the dim light.
Then Jack impatiently yelled out, “Pa!” and Dean finally stepped back and over to Jack, who had decided to pour his Cheerios into his applesauce and squish it between his fingers. Dean grimaced at the squelching noise.
But it passed quickly. Before he knew it, Dean was standing in front of a two-story lake house, keys cold in his pocket, Cas warm next him, and arms occupied with an infant who had briefly been the most powerful being on the planet.
*        *        *
Jack just giggled and Dean rolled his eyes. “Yeah, that sounds about right. You know, your dad used to be really annoying about bathing too.”
Once they got inside, the evening turned into Dean’s Cooking Show as he pulled the lasagna out of the oven and began garnishing it to
Dean takes a moment to consider. “Sometimes. Sometimes it feels worse because you have to go through all the awful shit in your head to try and make it make enough sense to write it down, you know?”
"Babe, he's already dead. I think it'd be a bit overkill."
knocked over an entire display tray and four racks of candles. He was just glad Cas had gone to change Jack’s diaper and hadn’t witnessed his stuttered response and heated cheeks. Not that he needed to convince Cas he was cool. That ship had sailed at least 8 years ago, if not more.
“Okay, that’s just rude—Hey! Do
Dean had barely been able to speak past the lump in his throat, wanting to say that Cas had always had him but he knew it wasn't true, that no matter how deeply burrowed the tendril of that unspeakable whatever they had was, he had looked Cas in the eyes at his most vulnerable and sent him packing.
Cas’s fork dropped onto his plate with a clang as he reached over to grasp Dean’s trembling hand. “You’re right.”
He looks happy.
Cas’s eyes brightened. “Actually, Sam is the one who betrayed you.”
Cas sighed helplessly. “I don’t know, I just sometimes wish I could talk to our Jack. I love this Jack but sometimes I want to show him a funny video or know what he would’ve named the cats.” He pauses and continues softly. “I miss my kid.”
Dean studied it for a moment, then smacked a wet kiss on the knuckles, basking in Cas’s surprised laugh. It took a second for Dean to get the ring from the box, unwilling to let go of Cas’s hand.
“Yeah, Cas, I am too.”
Dean smiled back, knowing it didn't matter how they spent the rest of the day, or the week, or the month.
would’ve been different if Jack had been a baby. He wonders.
They were welcome in the kitchen though, which is how Cas found Dean arguing with one on a Sunday morning. They hadn’t gotten around to naming them yet, so they’d been referring to one as the ‘loud one’ and the other as the ‘good one’. Cas disapproved of this methodology but the jet black kitten seemed to thrive off of attention and demanded it with incessant meowing. And scrambled eggs, which was the reason Dean was gesturing wildly with a spatula in front of the stove while the kitten sat on the floor and meowed indignantly back.
“Okay,” Cas's voice broke through Dean’s daze. “I’ll try it.” He looked awfully determined and Dean grinned. “Where will we acquire a journal?”
He wanted Cas to pick anything he wanted, wherever he wanted, whenever he wanted, not just because Dean would like it a certain way, but because Cas liked it. The barren room Cas had stayed in at the bunker, the borrowed clothes he’d worn as an angel, the tentative look when he wasn't sure if Dean wanted him to stay all added up to someone who didn't know if he had permission to exist.
“Ow—OW—Cas, how is nothing poking you?” Dean could somehow feel the stinging through his jeans, the brambles seemingly going out of their way to adhere to Dean’s flesh. He paused to unstick a wayward branch from his ankle, hissing as he did so, and when he stood to move forward a low-hanging branch smacked him in the face.
Cas’s eyes roamed around Dean’s face and Dean resisted the urge to squirm. The carpet digging into the side of his face wasn’t really helping either. They really should invest in better decor. The Ikea in town was okay, but Dean was confident he could find a nice one at the farmer’s market.
At this point in his spiraling, Cas tended to notice the lack of movement and would slip the bottle from Dean's hand to lead him to the squishy armchair in the living room, pushing him down to sit for a moment while Cas finished feeding Jack.
Cas freed his hand and traced his fingertips along Dean’s jaw, his ear, coming to rest on his cheek. “I wouldn’t be so sure.”
*        *        *
Dean felt something soft brush his toes and reached down to scoop the other kitten, reaching over to flip the bacon once she was settled against his chest. He could hear the shutter of Cas’s phone camera and turned to scowl at him. The kitten purred against his chest.
The couch squeaked as Sam hobbled to a standing position. He stretched noisily and said, “Well, I guess I could take a look.”
“They better wait a little though, cause they can’t get married before us. Sam would never let me hear the end of it.”
Cas took a breath. “Dean, being human has been extremely difficult.”
Cas’s perpetually cold hands threaded themselves into Dean’s hair, their lips meeting, tears mingling on their cheeks as they kissed. Dean was trying to keep it PG but he found his hands sneaking under Cas’s sweater, his shirt, his mouth moving to Cas’s jaw as Cas tilted his head back and groaned. Cas’s hands found the buttons of the semi-nice shirt Dean had bought to look somewhat presentable for their date, and had managed to unbutton the top one when he abruptly pulled away, which was only mildly effective considering he had clambered half onto Dean’s lap at this point.
“Hey buddy, you wanna fall asleep in the stroller instead?” Jack’s tightened grip on his hand and neck was an answer in itself and Dean sighed, knowing they'd have to wait till Jack was a bit more asleep before he could be extracted from Dean.
The hat was normally bobbing back and forth along the rows of flowers, vegetables, and herbs Cas had meticulously planted. It had only been about seven months, but there was a healthy crop. At least Dean was assuming there was, he had never stayed anywhere long enough to grow anything, and the bunker had been too devoid of light to attempt it.
“Dean!” Cas scrambled to help him back into a seated position. Despite the warm morning Dean could feel the cold ground through the blanket and his shirt, accompanied by a gentle throbbing where he’d hit the ground. They ended up with Dean sitting cross legged in front of a kneeling and concerned Cas. “Are you alright?”
“Don’t worry dear, we all get caught up when we’re young and in love. Could you actually help me with something?”
He turned to see Cas slipping his shoes off in the doorway, hands filled with grocery bags as he took in the scene before him.
Jack was cheerfully covering himself in banana mush and pancakes by the time Dean returned. He was babbling to himself and occasionally peppered in a word from his rapidly growing vocabulary, with today’s favorite being “banana”. Cas was staring at him with a wistful expression as Dean gingerly sat down opposite him, wincing as the bench creaked loudly.
“Shut the fuck up.”
“Hey yourself. Any particular reason you're visiting at,” He checked the watch Cas had gotten for him, “11:38 on a Tuesday?”
*        *        *
*        *        *
Dean crouched behind him, sinking his fingers into the loosely-packed topsoil.
Dean would trace the scars across Cas’s back and sometimes he’d get context, a tale of fighting a hellhound or the Empty or a lawnmower. Most times he’d just get a very serious “Dean, that tickles.” When Cas returned the favour it was a different story.
And Cas also had Claire and Eileen and Donna and Julia, who ran the book club in town. And after the Empty, Sam had made it clear that Cas had him too.
Which wasn’t what Dean was expecting but he tried to keep an open mind as Cas continued, “There’s so much pain and anger and suffering all of the time, and I don’t understand how so many of you manage to make it this far. But the hardest part for me has always been other people. There’s so much about body language and interpersonal interactions that I’m afraid I’ll never fully comprehend. But most humans tend to find their ‘people’.” He did little one-handed quotation marks and Dean was taken aback by how endearing he still found it.
“But she’s a girl.”
“Will do,” Claire simpered with false sweetness, “once I find someone worthy of my respect.”
Sam had been on the verge of tears at the thought of losing the kitten and Dean was wondering if Eileen’s pregnancy hormones were somehow rubbing off onto him. They had only had the kittens for a couple months so neither Dean nor Cas blamed Sam for forgetting, but he still seemed eaten up by guilt.
Cas beamed when Dean finally slid the ring on, and Dean clutched his hand in both of his own afterwards, admiring the way the late morning light hit both rings at the same time.
“Yeah,” Dean wasn’t completely lying, he
Cas scowled but it fell into a fond look when Dean pulled him closer by the waist.
“Okay, but Dean, my knee is really starting to hurt—”
Dean swallowed, remembering the box in his hand, trying not to peek at the identical one sitting on the ground in front of him.
The question was a bit disorienting and it took Dean a moment to realize that it was the first time Cas had referred to the lake house as home.
Dean had to resist the hysterical urge to laugh. “Cas. Hello.”
“And I
Dean smiled faintly, knowing that this wasn’t preordained, wasn’t fodder for a fucked-up novel, wasn’t an interlude in their stories meant to end in tragedy. This was them.
“At least it’s not as bad as that time he got so drunk that he kept playing with the lights in the bunker with his powers.”
“No I’m serious, that’s so cute. Do you want a hug? Now that you’re in love and all.”
“It’s not a big deal, it’s just,” he sighed and ran a hand through his hair. Jack made a restless noise and Dean reflexively reached out for him. The weight of Jack in his arms somehow made it easier to speak. “I didn’t remember much from before because I didn’t need to. But now Jack’s the same age as when I suddenly needed to know stuff.” He dipped his head to nuzzle Jack’s head and felt the pressure of Cas’s hand on his shoulder.
Dean woke the next morning to an empty bed with a post-it note stuck to his forehead, a heart  drawn on with a sharpie in the center of it.
The very intellectual conversation was interrupted by Cas lifting the kitten and giving her a smooch on the forehead, the cat immediately melting into his touch. Dean put his hands on his hips and felt like a petulant toddler. Or a fussy housewife.
found its way onto his list that night, then no one needed to know.
Unfortunately Dean wasn’t going to be able to save his shirt, as Jack decided today would be a great day to fight Dean every step of the bathing process. Getting clothes off a six-month old was already a task but today Jack was particularly playful and seemed to twist his body in the exact direction to make removing his t-shirt impossible.
trying. And that’s what Jack needs.” His nose crinkled when he looked over at their son. “I think he also needs a bath.”
“Cas—no—
Dean let out an exaggerated sigh, expressing his displeased acceptance of the name. “Fine, but I call dibs on the other one.”
*        *        *
"Dean Winchester I am going to—"
Dean leans in closer. "Yup. And you know what?"
“Oh, yeah.”
“No, Cas, I—wait, what?”
But for now, he would attend to the baby whimpers he could hear gently breaking through the peaceful morning.
"Wow, Cas is on a mission, huh?"
Eventually Cas returned with Jack and they decided to eat breakfast in the yard, the day bright with just a few clouds scattered across the sky.
“Holy shit.”
went unspoken.
Panic rose like bile in Dean’s throat but he tamped it down to say, “Sure.”
Dean grinned tiredly, “Why not? Jack is our spawn.”
Cas responded in kind, "You're going to have to marry me first."
Dean looked up from the two jars of tomato paste he was debating between to see Cas holding the shopping cart with whitened knuckles. Jack was in the built-in seat sticking his hand into his mouth while making gurgling noises, and Dean made a mental note to sanitize the carts from now on—but first: “Scared of what, Cas?”
Dean pulled the door behind him, the door making the faintest clicking noise as it slid closed.
Cas sat back and squeezed Dean's hand. It took a second, but Dean eventually found his voice, “But how do I make sure I don’t mess up again if I don’t remember everything that happened to us. Everything that happened to him.”
Cas looked amused by Dean’s dazed response, and reminded him, “The rings, Dean.”
Later that night he neatly wrote
“I didn’t,” Dean tried to sound casual but saw Cas’s eyes soften when he adds, “I remember from when Sam was younger.”
“At the end of the day all we can do is try to be better. You’re probably gonna mess up a lot, but so will I. That’s just the nature of humanity.”
Cas just shrugged and asked if Dean could put the marshmallows in his hot chocolate into the shape of a smiley face. Dean sighed noisily but the look of delight in Cas's face once he put the mug in front of him was worth slightly scalding his fingertips.
Dean rolled his eyes, unsurprised that Sam was still thinking about the grapes, the big nerd. He leaned over to open the blinds and let in some of the golden light as he answered, “Apparently, all the photosynthesis mumbo-jumbo happens in the leaves, not the actual fruit, so as long as the leaves get enough light, the grapes will be fine.”
Once all wounds had been licked and apologies doled out, Dean snuck upstairs before dinner to add
Jack settled a little. “Oh so you like stories about Dada, huh? Well, let me tell you about the time he flooded the master bathroom the first week we lived here.” It took Dean a couple of anecdotes of Cas flooding various rooms and getting conditioner in his eye, but he eventually found himself wrapping Jack in his bath towel. It had a built-in hood with a teddy bear face on it. The first time Sam had seen Jack bundled up in it he had teared up on the spot. Dean hadn’t admitted that he’d initially had the same reaction.
Cas looked up, eyes shining with unshed tears. “Are you sure?”
Cas’s voice was still low when he asked, “Do you want hot chocolate?”
“But Dean, Cas isn’t here, what if you go into cuddle withdrawal?”
Meanwhile Cas was unloading sandwiches and cookies and napkins and all kinds of other stuff he hadn’t let Dean help him with. Dean whistled lowly at the bottle of wine Cas set next to the blanket and Cas exaggeratedly flourished as he pulled out two wine glasses.
“And Kaia—”
Jack had held onto the frankly ridiculous god-power for approximately four hours before he decided he didn’t actually want to know all the ways Riverdale could end as well as the knowledge that the actual ending was going to be the worst one possible. Cas’s argument that Jack should be with his family because, “you’re barely four years old,” had also been rather persuasive.
Dean didn’t even know if Cas would ever even think about—let alone
Cas groaned. “I told him not to eat so much. I was sure he’d puke out his actual intestines.”
s from his studio audience. Jack was in his high chair with mashed carrots all over his face, but he still watched with wide eyes and smacked the table when he decided wasn’t getting enough attention.
Dean nudged Cas with his foot, forcing him to make eye contact. “I know I can’t give you back your wings, but I can give you what you gave them up for. You can have me, if you'll take me.”
He absolutely did not lay in bed with only the moonlight and his sleeping beloved next to him and have his brain whisper
trying. You’ve
Cas faltered, his face shifting to one bordering on devastation. “No?”
Cas lifts an eyebrow, "Oh, really?"
“Unbelievable.”
He closed his eyes, birds chirping and hair ruffling in the breeze. When Dean went back inside he would add ‘sunrise’ to a list he kept in a notebook in his dresser, far from eyes that would crinkle and worry and ask concerned questions.
Cas ignored him and ventured further into the woods, eventually stopping so abruptly that Dean walked into him. He was steadied by Dean’s hand on his shoulder, then turned his head to point out, “It was my turn to choose and besides,” He jerked his chin to point in front of him. “We’re here.”
Jack whimpered and Dean heaved his way up, waving away thoughts of past children to focus on the very real child in his arms who had decided he was hungry.
Cas made his way off of Dean, but stayed in his space, knees brushing as he sat directly in front of him. His hair was gloriously mussed up and his shirt was crooked but the grin he was aiming at Dean was brighter than the sun.
Cas squeezed his fingers. “I wish I didn’t have to burden you with this. Sometimes,” He hesitates. “Sometimes I yearn for my grace. Maybe I wouldn’t be feeling like this. I could’ve fixed any of Jack’s ailments, or healed your burned fingers, or had the solution to most worldly problems at my fingertips.”
"Oh, Absolutely not. When I ask you to marry me you're going to be crying from joy."
Dean’s heart clenched. “Cas, of course.” He opened the box and heard Cas’s breath hitch.
The breeze picked up behind Dean, the warm air making the papers on the counter rustle and the windchimes in the entryway make their melodic jingling noise. Cas looked up at Dean and smiled.
He still seemed frustrated so after a bit of hesitation Dean offered, “I know you probably don’t wanna talk to anyone about this but,” He took a fortifying breath. “Have you considered writing about it?”
“The fuck am I supposed to do with this?”
Dean grumbled his way into an upright position and stared at the book of exorcisms Cas had decided would be his problem.
Dean laughed, then winced as Ruth tried to scratch at him. “Yeah, it was kinda depressing to watch Cas find the fucked up grapes everyday so I looked up how to stop it. Can we—ow! Ruth, what the fuck?” She meowed at him petulantly and he meowed back mockingly.
“Hey, wanna bet they’ll propose at the same time?”
Dean reached one hand to grab the box which had been tossed to the side and the other to grab Cas’s left hand. He gingerly opened the box with one hand, but Cas snatched his hand away. “Hey!”
It was a clear opening and Dean took it. “I didn’t remember much during—after the—you know. The crypt. I needed to take the edge off and it just—kind of got—” He cleared his throat  and stared at the grain of the wood as Cas reached over to grab his hand. Dean clutched it like a lifeline. “Apparently I scared Sam pretty bad. He doesn’t really—it didn't—let's just say it got real bad. Then we got you back and Jack decided to Dorian Gray himself and I was holding him as a tiny little thing. And I just—I couldn’t do that to him.”
They made out lazily for a few minutes, Dean's hand cushioning the back of Cas's head from the cabinet behind him. Dean broke off to kiss along Cas's jaw, his ear, down his neck, and was working on an impressive hickey at the junction of Cas's neck and shoulder when Cas breathlessly interrupted, "Dean."
Once they found a table that was in the shade and only mildly gross-looking, Dean decided Sam should take a turn feeding Jack. “For practice.”
Dean was expecting the comment to sting, but his head flooded with relief. He wanted to be certain that he wouldn’t intentionally fall back into his old habits but he knew that the anger that used to simmer right below the surface of his skin was still a bit too close to his fingertips for him to ever feel safe.
“Yeah.” Dean grouched, cradling Ruth, who had the audacity to start purring and rubbing her face against his chest.
Cas was unimpressed. “I could get to know it better.”
“I think I have it now, with Jack and Sam and Claire, and everyone who’s shown me a moment of kindness. But it all started when I pulled you from hell.” He looks directly at Dean. “And I found my person.”
Dean craned his neck back to look at Sam as Jack clambered onto his chest. “Hey, what about you witch-boy? Aren’t you still Rowena’s protege or whatever? Ow! Jack, buddy, that’s my nipple.” Jack just giggled and smacked Dean’s chest again. He wobbled dangerously, but Dean and Cas both raised a hand to his back to steady him.
The morning sun had kept climbing and was now a bright reflection on the surface of the water, harsh if not for the sleepy ex-angel standing in front of the glare. The edges of Cas’s figure were blown out by the light behind him, framing him in a halo-like glow. He looked like a miracle.
“Pa.” Jack reached a hand out and Dean held it, Jack settling once he had the small bit of comfort.
"No, they're definitely red."
*        *        *
“What a bitch.”
As they waited for it to heat up Dean stopped forward between Cas’s legs, hands to his waist.
“Are you for real right now? He’s asleep.”
Dean stroked Jack’s fingers, his heart clenching traitorously as the little hand reflexively curled around his thumb.
Dean knew he missed Jack though. So he listened to his brother respond to Jack's baby babble with increasingly incomprehensible babble of his own as the night grew darker. Cas pressed in closer to his side and Dean watched the fireflies.
*        *        *
He picked up the notebook and ambled over to the dresser, tucking it back into the drawer next to the Rubik's cube that Cas had clearly forgotten about. He then took a deep breath, realized he was smiling so hard his face hurt, tried to stop smiling, then gave up to pull his phone out and text Sam.
"It's technically considered manure."
“Ruth.”
Cas sighs. “It’s difficult to explain.”
kinda made me talk to someone. Like a—a therapist.” Cas’s eyebrows flew up and Dean laughed in spite of himself. “Yeah, I know. I always thought it was kinda, I don’t know, girly? Don’t tell Claire I said that, she’ll kick my ass. But I thought it would be a lot of just talking about my feelings and whatever, but he kept giving me tasks and things to work on. One of them was the list.”
“So, you have one—a journal? You write in it?”
“I’m goin’ back t’sleep.” He turned over to what was supposed to his side of the bed, but Dean knew he’d be cocooned around him again in a few hours.
“Language!”
Ignoring the jolt of anxiety at Cas’s words, Dean says, “Shoot.”
The thing is: it's fine. He’s fine. It’s been six months of early mornings and pacifiers and way too many loads of laundry. It’s been fine.
“Actually,” Sam chimed in, “I’m surprised Cas didn’t tell you already.”
He eventually found Cas crouched on the floor with Jack held facing forward against his chest so he could see the plant Cas was talking about in a low voice. From the looks of it, Cas was lamenting the loss of half his grapes to the local bird population.
Cas mumbled into Dean’s forehead, “I’m going back to bed,” before stumbling his way out of the room, leaving Dean with the sunshine and the baby.
“She seems mad at me? I don’t know, it’s just like weird and I needed to get away before I say or do something stupid.” Claire grabs the hand Dean reaches up towards her and yanks him into an upright position. “Christ, dude, what have you been eating?”
Ignoring Sam’s question, Dean closed the front door and slipped his shoes off, padding his way to the kitchen. He rummaged through the fridge and returned to the living room with a cold  teething ring. He huffed his way into a seated position on the floor in front of Jack’s playmat.
Jack grinned and went back to making a mess as Cas subtly threw the cheerio into the trash can behind him. He smiled smugly at Dean, who just gave him a sour look, quickly melting into one of affection when Cas looked away.
"Mmm, I would say that they're pink."
“I used to have a scar up the entire back of my thigh.”
*        *        *
Dean nudged open the door to Jack’s room, floorboards creaking under his shifting weight, and paused. Cas already had Jack cradled on his chest, gently swaying on the rocking chair in the corner. Dean leaned against the doorway as a familiar warmth spread through his chest.
“As good as I’ll get after last night.”
Dean turned back to Cas, who had a thoughtful expression on his face. “I think we have to do both.” He elaborated at Dean’s skeptical look. “I mean, you’re preoccupied with the bad, but you're forgetting about all the good. Like, that time you drove two towns over to pick up a Finding Nemo dvd bc the internet was down in the bunker and Jack wanted to watch it. Or spent the day teaching him to drive.  Or even that birthday cake you made him.” Cas ran a hand through his hair, making Dean want to sink his fingers into it.
Sometimes Dean's hands shook when trying to feed Jack. He’d look into bright blue eyes that are so trusting and he sees an older version of this baby staring down the barrel of a gun and he wonders how he'd let loss hollow himself out to the point where all that was left to fill the void were pieces of his father. He wondered if it would've been different if Jack had been a baby then. He wonders if
Sam was stifling a laugh when Dean looked back up. “Do you wanna head back inside?”
On cooler nights it felt like a miracle had snuck its way into Dean’s bed and under the covers. Dean had seen Cas’s face furious and thrilled and heartbroken, but he had never let himself fathom what Cas would look like in the late hours of night, contentedly snoring against Dean’s own collarbone.
*        *        *
“Jack, please.”
The three tiniest members of the household had taken a moment to get used to each other, Jack apparently unsure what to do with a stuffed animal that could move and make noise. But they tolerated each other well enough, though there was a unanimous decision to keep the kittens out of the nursery.
Sam broke into a grin. “Don’t tell Eileen I told you. It’s still kinda early.”
“Meow!”
Cas had a bright yellow sun hat he wore while gardening, which made him easy to spot from the master bedroom window when Dean woke up one morning to find a mess of sheets instead of a grumpy ex-angel. Dean had bought it for him after Cas had experienced his first ever sunburn after neglecting to wear sunscreen during a swimming lesson. Cas had become very interested in sun protection, or at least in not having to rub aloe vera gel on his reddened skin for a week.
“And I’m glad we get to raise him and help him experience life in a new way.”
While Dean was extremely grateful for Sam’s help, leaving Jack behind felt like getting an organ removed. Every excursion felt like he had forgotten something, looking around for his kid whenever it slipped his mind for a moment.
Cas just shook his head. “I was wondering...could I read it? The list, I mean?”
Dean burst out laughing at Sam’s disgusted expression. Cas’s look of wide-eyed innocence was betrayed by the small smile he was trying to suppress. Sam just groaned and reached out for Jack. “C’mon Jack-Jack, let's get you cleaned up.” Jack squealed as Sam swung him up and tossed him into the air, Dean and Cas both yelling at him to stop.
Jack turned his watery eyes on Dean and whimpered, making Dean’s heart ache. It took a few attempts, but eventually they were able to coax Jack into biting the object, and when his cries tapered off Sam collapsed on the sofa out of relief. Cas leaned over until Dean was supporting most of his body and slung an arm around his waist. When he finally spoke it was almost a whisper.
“Why do you—nevermind, it’s in the top drawer of my dresser.”
Dean grinned, “Fuck yeah!”
“Ah, we’ll just get one next time we go on a grocery run. Do you have any preferences?”
Cas smiled, arms going around Dean’s shoulders, “Hello Dean.”
Cas looked up and the distraught look on his face made Dean take a step forward, but paused when Cas himself took a step back. “
They stopped and stared at each other, the mood abruptly shifted. Dean ducked his head as his lungs took a moment to get with the program. "You—ah—" he kicked the ground and ventured a look at Cas. "You'd want that?"
He wanted Jack to feel safe. Even if it wasn’t with him.
“Cas—”
traitorously.
Dean laughed, the relief in his voice palpable. “Still, I’m sorry you lost it. That you don’t have the world at your fingertips, or whatever.”
“Yeah, let’s go home.”
The creaking back door pulled their attention to the house, where Cas was standing in the doorway and gesturing for the duo to come back inside. Dean threw an arm over Claire’s shoulder, which she allowed begrudgingly. Claire complained a lot—a
He leaned forward until their foreheads met. “Yeah, Cas, this is real. We’re real.”
child, when he wakes up before Cas on a Sunday with the morning light dappled across the sheets and his angel bundled up beside him. It was only slightly enhanced by the fact that Cas had actually cursed. Dean was stupid in love with him.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Okay, so I was going to tell you, but I know you would freak out—”
Cas was still staring at their joined hands, shell-shocked. He looked up at Dean, nearly in a daze. “Dean, is this—is this real?”
After they started, it was like a dam had been unblocked.
Dean blinked at the abrupt subject change and then groaned as he stood and gently extracted Jack, who had managed to get himself covered in food yet again. Jack grinned and smacked the side of Dean’s face with a banana-covered hand as Cas chuckled at Dean’s grimace.
“Wait, no, I asked first,” Dean barreled through Cas’s look of bewilderment, “So I get to put your ring on you first.”
“Oh my god.”
Cas stepped forward and grabbed the cheerio, saying, “Thank you so much for sharing, Jack.”
Cas looked so flabbergasted that Dean couldn’t help but laugh.
As Cas padded his way across the kitchen Dean handed Jack a clean spoon and then spun around to grab the groceries out of Cas’s hands and spin Cas himself into his arms. Cas startled and then laughed, arms going around Dean’s shoulders with a fond look. Dean tugged him closer and tried to do a modified slow dance to a song that absolutely shouldn’t be slow danced to.
Now he looked at Cas in his floppy hat, the crisp autumn air a sharp contrast to the heat of the sun and the warmth he seemed to carry around with him perpetually nowadays. He traced the crinkles around the blue eyes that were miracles themselves. He wanted to announce to the world that he, Dean Winchester, had done that. Not just made an angel of the fucking lord fall, but that he could make him laugh and smile and feel things for long enough that they were now permanent fixtures on his face.
Cas caught Dean’s arm as he turned back to his tomato paste and leveled him a confused expression. “I thought you didn’t read the child development books Sam got for us.”
Sam rolled his eyes and grimaced when he picked up the teething ring, muttering under his breath about unsanitary conditions. Cas and Dean were left snuggled on the floor.
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose, the frustration in his head easing as he felt Cas’s arms wrap around his back, sturdy from hours of carrying around their child. He leaned back into him as Cas sang back to him, his gravelly voice rumbling through his chest, the vibrations palpable on Dean’s back.
“I see.” Cas’s tone was carefully blank and Dean resisted the urge to deflect. If Cas could talk about his feelings in the middle of the fucking Sprouts, then he could at least
“I’m not,” Sam shrugged and Dean could tell he was avoiding eye contact. “I was just talking to Cas earlier and he was saying that you’ve been so good with him because,” Sam sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Because you pretty much did all of that stuff for me. And I know you don't want to talk about it—”
The farmers market was always crowded, but today it seemed like every person on their side of the Mississippi river had shown up. On a regular day this wouldn't bother Dean, but on a regular day he wasn't trying to keep both Sam and Cas from drifting off into the abyss of bodies.
“You think? What makes you not sure?” Dean grabbed the last of the paper bags and went to work covering the final bundle of grapes as Claire attempted an explanation.
They polished off their sandwiches quickly while idly discussing the merits of the newest Batman movie and Dean was halfway through a seran-wrapped piece of pie when he noticed Cas fidgeting, suddenly quiet. He swallowed and asked, “Cas, you good?
The cool metal slid into place and Dean could vaguely feel his face ache from smiling as hard as he was. He stared at the ring, head spinning, for long enough that Cas had to nudge his knee. When he looked up Cas was smiling back, with a look of near disbelief on his face.
“Cas it’s really not that big of a dea—”
"Dean."
The grin that slowly spread across Cas's face  was more beautiful than every sunset over the lake Dean had ever seen and without thinking he moved forward.
Cas eventually came downstairs to the sight of Sam sitting on Dean’s back triumphantly, the two kittens joining him while Dean muttered about traitors under his breath.
“Dean, can you please hurry up?”
“Cas, I love you too.”
"Dean, you can't get manure on our child!"
In response to Dean’s raised eyebrows, Cas lowered his voice and revealed, “She bought a wedding ring.”
“Sweetheart, I’m gonna need you to speak up.”
“Oh, I don’t know.” The look on Cas’s face mirrored the one when Dean had asked if he had a preference for the curtains in the living room and Cas had blurted that he didn’t usually get to make a lot of choices. The free will Cas exercised seemed to be suspended between pleasing either Heaven or Dean and the thought made Dean feel sick.
Cas's "What?" is a breathy whisper on Dean's lips.
“Yeah.”
But the woman’s comment was so much more vivid than the offhand mentions of Cas as his life partner and it kind of haunted Dean for a while. He would wipe down the kitchen and not think about how Cas and him clearly gave off such married energy that everyone within a two-mile radius could detect it.
Chuck or not, Dean couldn’t shake the past precedents hovering over him.
Dean squinted up at Claire, backlit by the sun. The weather had been lovely recently, but being in the garden with the sun beating down was not. Claire was wearing a baseball cap that read “Fish fear me. Women want me.” and Dean wondered briefly if she would get him a matching one but quickly discarded the idea. Last time he tried to connect with her on a fashion level she had slathered eyeliner on him, which had taken days to get off of his face completely.
Cas gently tugged on Dean's shirt until their torsos were flush. "Well, it sounds like you should do something about it."
*        *        *
Huh. He handed the woman her sauce. Maybe he was kinda young. Even if Claire had him saved as ‘Old Man’ in her phone.
“No, no, Cas, you don’t understand,” Dean pulled out his phone and opened his last message to Kaia. He flipped the phone around so Cas could see the image she had sent him.
Cas had placed his hand on Dean's cheek, fingertips brushing his hairline, "And you've got me."
“Dada!” Jack stretches his arms towards Cas, who doesn’t hesitate to reach forward and pull him from his seat.
However, Sam backed Dean up, “Yeah, Cas, I’m gonna be honest, it just sounds like normal forgetfulness. You were technically younger the last few times you were human, so it was probably easier to remember stuff.” Sam gave a little half shrug, already slouching his way back into a slumped-over position on the couch. “It’s just aging, man. Sucks, but that’s just how it is sometimes.”
Cas shot him an unimpressed look and gestures vaguely at the body on the floor. “Is it not obvious?”
Cas’s face turned so soft that Dean was almost glad when Jack began whimpering through the baby monitor and Cas left to attend to him after a quick peck on the lips. Dean could handle the reality of Cas being in love with his dumb ass most days but sometimes it was like staring into the sun and Dean had to look away to keep from melting.
Cas beamed. “Yeah?”
Sometimes Dean would awaken in the middle of the night.
“What can I say?” Cas shrugged with false modesty. “Sam knows that I'm more trustworthy.”
Sam winced. “You know when you went to bed early yesterday?”
Dean chuckles, “Nah, I fell off my bike when I was eight.”
