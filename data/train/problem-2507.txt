Still, he won’t say that he was witnessing a father-son making up relationship there because he knew better.
But Sam didn’t move. His brother was still a vague figure in his sight that was no better than a spirit. He stared so hard trying to see, but black spot stinging here and there behind his eyeballs, making him almost want to cry again.
And then finally, Castiel put a pause on the torture and continued using a not-so-harsh voice. “Like I said be a good boy.”
Castiel inspected the bruised color and degree of swollen around and inside the vulva area, and moved his glance towards the boy. “Can you hold another round of slap?”
Castiel swallowed and looked up at Dean, his eyes hooded and dark. “Dean. I’ve been thinking about this. I want to give you control over my body. Because I trust you. But, I can’t make any promises about what will happen if I get physically overwhelmed while being tied down. I don’t think I’ll hurt you, but-,” Dean placed two fingers over Cas’ lips before stepping forward and replacing his fingers with a soft kiss. As he pulled back, Dean's eyes stayed shut and he whispered, “I’ve got you, Cas. Let me take care of you.” Dean slowly opened his eyes to see Cas nodding in agreement.
Angel’s Books was set in a little shopping center on South Lamar next to a tattoo shop. It carried all the current best selling paperbacks, as well as a plethora of used and well-worn books. There were aisles of poetry, historical nonfiction, travel and photography, an extensive young adult section, and even textbooks that could be bought and sold for a fair price, which the local college crowd appreciated. The register was perched atop an antique wooden desk that Castiel found at an estate sale and immediately fell in love with. The back of the shop was redesigned to accommodate an espresso machine, small pastry case, and several plush armchairs, as requested by Castiel’s older brother Gabriel. It was his only stipulation when he agreed to invest and help run the shop. The smell of old books and ink mixed well with fresh coffee and almond croissants to give the store a warm, familiar homey feeling. Castiel walked into his bookstore every morning with a deep inhale and a silent prayer of thanks (to whoever may be listening) for giving him this little piece of Heaven.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about Gabriel,” Castiel replied innocently. “Can’t I just be having a good morning?”
An insistent pounding woke him sometime around noon. He squinted at his phone screen indicating three missed calls and six messages, all from Charlie. He only had one guess as to who it was knocking at his door when he would normally be at work. He dragged himself out of bed and went straight to the door, not even bothering to put pants on. One quick check through the peephole confirmed his suspicions and he pulled the door open for his best friend, and leaned against the door frame.
“Of course I do!” Dean cautiously reached a hand out and swept his fingers over the soft feathers behind Castiel’s shoulder, causing the wings to puff out in response. “Don’t hide them around me anymore, okay?”
As he pulls into the motel parking lot, his smile fades. “What do we do now? I mean, I don’t know what to tell Sammy,” he pauses, pulling the car to a stop in front of the room he’s sharing with his brother. The light is still on. Sam must be waiting up for him, likely researching their next case on his laptop. “Honestly I really don’t want to tell Sammy about this yet. I will,” he adds.  “Just not yet. I gotta figure out what to say first, okay?” Cas nods and answers, “I understand Dean. I won’t say anything to Sam until you’re ready. That being said, I probably shouldn’t come in with you right now. He might start asking questions about why I showed up in the first place.” Dean’s eyes drop to where their hands are still clasped together on the seat. He hadn’t planned on saying goodbye to his angel already. “Yeah. You’re probably right, Cas. Better this way,” Dean says with a pout. Cas brings his hand up to Dean, using two fingers to tilt his chin back up a bit. “Don’t worry Dean. I’ll see you soon,” Cas promises with a grin. “Oh and Dean? I love you too.” He leans over and places a soft kiss on Dean’s lips. Cas is already gone when Dean opens his eyes. Sitting alone in the car, Dean inhales deeply and smiles at the empty passenger seat before getting out and heading into the motel room. He wonders exactly what his angel meant by “soon”.
Dean knew his face was flushed, and it wasn’t because the room was too warm. Castiel fought to hold back a giggle.
Castiel crawled off the bed, leaving Dean a desperate mess of arousal. He fumbled around in Dean’s bag before raising his hand triumphantly, holding onto a handful of lube packets.
The petite brunette stands behind the bar, pouring Dean’s whiskey, and glances back up at her hero as she hands him the drink. Crossing her arms, she leans forward on her elbows and gives him her full attention.  At this point, Dean’s green eyes have become lost in thought, far away from the empty bar. Clearly the bar tender has stumbled upon a sensitive subject.
Castiel rolled his eyes and smiled at his sister. “Yes, you were right. Next time you offer to bring me along for an article you’re working on, maybe I won’t be so…,” Castiel as interrupted by another round of cheers, this time even louder and more spirited. When he found the cause, his brain short-circuited. Dean was walking back toward the poles. The difference being...he had removed his jeans. He was down to nothing but a really small pair of black shorts that only covered the bare necessities and hugged his little bubble butt amazingly well.
Dean’s breath caught in his chest, his eyes wide as he took in Castiel’s face, warm, open, and without judgment.
“I was starting to wonder if Alfie had to go to Brazil for the coffee beans,” she said sarcastically.
“Oh, uh, yeah. Sure, that's totally reasonable,” Cas said, shaking his head. “Um, just give me a call or whatever when you decide.”
“Thanks, Sam,” Castiel replied. “I just don’t want to make a fool of myself and let Dean down. He’s got so much riding on this. I’d hate to disappoint him after he’s worked so hard.”
“Wait, angels are real too? I mean, witches, vampires and werewolves, sure. I can believe that. Hell, I guess I have to now that I just saw you rip that vampire’s head off.  Thanks again, by the way. You saved my life tonight. Your drinks are on the house.”
Dean stood there, chewing on his bottom lip while he thought about Castiel’s question. Up until five minutes ago, he’d been having a pretty shitty day… but now? He barely knew this dude, and yet he had somehow 180°-ed his mood with just a flash of his baby blues.
“No, that’s...yeah that’s fine. We can call it an early night,” Dean said, nodding. “I’m gonna go get cleaned up and get dressed.”
He had planned to go home and wallow in his misery alone. It seemed the Impala had different plans and steered him here instead. Pam’s regular class was almost done for the day. Once empty, he could have the floor to himself. If he could just spend an hour on the pole with some loud music, he might feel better. At least, he might have a better shot of sleeping tonight if he was completely exhausted, mentally, and physically.
It had been two weeks since that blissful morning in the shower. Two weeks of stolen kisses when Sam wasn’t looking. Two weeks of subtle touches, when Dean could brush his hand against Cas’ thigh when he rode shotgun. Two weeks that Dean had Cas in his bed every night. Two weeks that Dean had everything he had been denying himself for years.
“Oh, uh, well my sister is next door at her first class with Pam. Her car wouldn’t start this afternoon when she left work. So, I picked her up and brought her here so she could make it to the class on time. Just figured I’d hang out over here until it’s over,” Castiel explained, gesturing to the coffee mug and forgotten novel in front of him.
“So, who’s Dean?” Gabriel asked, giving Castiel a minor heart attack after his brother popped up out of nowhere, with one hand on his hip and the other rolling a bright red lollipop between his fingers. “This wouldn’t have anything to do with that pole thing you went to with Anna last week would it?”
Dean rolled off the bed and walked over to his dresser.  Out of the top drawer he removed a black silicone plug featuring five graduated beads. It was attached via cord to a small remote control device. “I was gonna wait to use this with you. But, I think tonight, with you like this, might be perfect.” Cas swallowed loudly and kept his eyes fixed on the toy as Dean returned to the bed. He knelt down onto the mattress between Cas’s feet and ran the nail of his index finger along Cas’s instep, up his calf and his inner thigh, causing Cas to shiver.
“Cas,“ he whined. “Cas, I’m not gonna last very long, Angel. You feel too damned good. I feel like I’m gonna explode,” Dean warned. Castiel squeezed the base of Dean’s cock and doubled his efforts. He sucked hard around the head, hollowed his cheeks and took him all the way down again until Dean could feel the back of his throat. Cas swallowed around him, making Dean cry out.
His dick finally stopped pulsing inside Cas’ mouth and he pulled off with an obnoxiously loud, wet pop. He barely paid attention when Cas readjusted his shorts, pulling them back up over his spent cock. Dean’s body went completely boneless where he laid, staring up at the open industrial ceiling of the studio.
Castiel only had a second to palm himself over his pants before his husband was climbing into his lap at the same time that Eartha Kitt was singing about rings. Running his tongue along his bottom lip, Dean ground his hips over Castiel’s crotch, giving his cock the friction he craved. Hoping the usual “no hands” rule didn’t apply to this lap dance, Castiel finally brought his hands around to Dean’s ass and pulled him even closer. Dean pulled the Santa hat off Castiel, plopped it back on top of his own head, and wrapped his arms around Castiel’s neck.
Dean swiped his tongue along his bottom lip and took a deep breath as he studied Castiel for any signs of insincerity and found none. He forced himself to lean back in his chair, feeling a need to put some space between them, lest he forget himself and accidentally kiss those dry pink lips that were getting more and more tempting every time Castiel licked them.
“So, congratulations. You boys made it through. Proud of ya. Thought I’d go over your scores with you,” Pam said, eyeing them both. “You scored high on execution and difficulty. That’s what saved you, because you barely beat the next team when it came to stage presence. Would you like to hear the judges’ comments?”
Another loud noise came from the house and more cursing words ruffled outside, Sam didn’t know what they were, but he was startled by the harsh and angst in them. Like he was speaking of a disgusting disease or a despicable demon. (If he really hated him so much, why bother trying to find him anyway? Why not just let him die or whatever?) He knew it was his father shouting, but what he didn’t know was how John would calm down or if he would calm down at all. He lifted his knees to his bony chest and braced himself there. He could feel that he was shivering from those words and his own fear, squeezing his eyes shut, praying his father would just forget him and let go.
The boy was still wailing, his chest hovering up and down, trying to gain some air during his cry. But he looked sad. If there were single tiny hopes lingering in his eyes before, they were gone now, like he finally accepted his fate as the slave tool here, realizing that the world abandoned him and no one was coming for him. He had to behave in order to minor the pain and he had to listen and depend on Castiel to survive.
“Not during the ritual.” Castiel told him. “But not stare, just look at them-no matter what they do, what they say to you, remember to look at them gently-”
“The Covenant people.” The boy said, his cheeks were ruined by the tears. Redness and swollen made him look like he was having a fever. “When I looked at them, I got punished.”
Later, when Sam was older, he found being brave could mean a lot of things. It was the way Dean showed him how he would look after Sam when their father was not around, protecting Sam from the dark side of the world, from the monsters and shady things-not so much saying they always meant deadly-from their worst nightmares when Dean was still a little boy too.
“A little.” The boy said. After that he was quiet for about two seconds, the corner of his lips twisting in a way that’s hard to tell if he was going to smile or cry again. And then Castiel found out he was going to cry because those fat tears all came back, rolling. He remembered what Castiel said this time and kept his eyes open, focusing on Castiel openly and completely, like there was nothing left in front of him besides Castiel-he was still young and barely mature no matter what his body’s age was. He trusted people so easily and once he accepted his fate and realized that he got to depend on Castiel, he didn’t hesitate. Castiel sighed again for he would learn that one soon in the future too. He quietly sobbed behind his tears and finally confessed. “It hurt a lot.”
And for this, Sam thought Dean was the bravest man in the world. Even though he still considered the temptation of hiding in the garage and running away from his father, he knew as long as he had this brave person who would protect him and step up for him whenever needed standing right behind him, he was never afraid of anything his father threw at him.
It was never easy getting back to where he left. Sam spent two hours sitting in the car trying to figure out who their father had encountered. EMF always seemed a good idea to deal with ghosts, but without a clue what they were looking for, it didn’t help much. They spent another twenty minutes grabbing something for the gas station to eat. It was already dawn time. Feeble white colored around the horizon in front of their car. Sam assumed he must have fallen asleep at some point near the valley, but he couldn’t remember. When they finally approached Jericho, Sam offered to change. Dean didn’t let him.
Sam had been in California for more than three years, but he didn’t get many opportunities to explore around and honestly he was fine with that. His childhood was nothing if not traveling all over the country. He had the confidence to say that he was more local than any of the California local forks. He knew almost all of their lores and curses, good or bad. He could easily tell how many serious killer cases in Nevada County without breaking into their police database. Dean used to call him weirdo because of that, saying Sam had an obsession over creepy crimes. Sam thought his brother just got jealous.
Their father practically avoided speaking of her in the house. Dean told him that he loved their mother so much, and that how their mother died could do a thing to him, making him into a completely different man. Sam couldn’t agree because he didn’t know their father before the death of their mother. All he knew was John Winchester was a crappy father who would lock his sons at home, only asking his friends to check on them if something happened. That he missed Dean’s birthday and his birthday, missed Christmas sometimes and Thanksgiving.
Now that he opened his eyes, his whole focus was zeroed on Castiel. It seemed as though Castiel would be his new whole world from now on. And he would listen. He would listen to anything that Castiel told him. And he would obey. He didn’t need pleasure, he just need the pain to stop.
“Open your eyes,” Castiel said. “Whenever someone penetrates you in the future-trust me that’s going to be a lot-you have to look at him.”
Dean never said he wanted more. He said Sam was his little brother and he would look after him even when their father couldn’t. He was fond of telling Sam stories of their family legends or just simply Dean Winchester’s legends. Mainly they were about monsters and how Dean killed them, but even from a child’s perspective, Sam could tell most of the stores were bullshit. There was no way that Dean could take down a Zombie all by himself, but he didn’t correct Dean. The last time when Sam tried to call his brother a bluff, he got a smack in the back of his head. So time after time, he just kept quiet, letting Dean say whatever he wished, and not got involved in his big brother’s self-satisfaction moments. He could tell those moments were really, really BIG moments for a ten-year-old Dean Winchester.
Sam didn’t know what exactly happened down there, but he heard the engine dead, watching their father get out of his car, and after he walked into their main house, Sam was sure he heard someone raised his voice (probably John since Dean didn’t dare to raise his voice in front of their father). That was not a very pleasant sound and soon there came another sharp noise, seemingly someone slammed a door so hard that a house was going to fall down. “Did you lose him,” That one was definitely John Winchester. “Where did you lose him?!”
And it was Dean who shoved him back in his bedroom. He didn’t cry that night or ask because Dean always said he cried too much, but he really wanted to. He knew he couldn’t make a sound but he was scared that his tears would never stop and he would die of dehydration. He didn’t remember much for the rest of the night, but he did remember as he woke up the next morning, John was gone and the whole house smelled like a liquor store. Dean curled up on the carpet of the floor, drooling in his sleep, one leg awkwardly hanging on the edge of the bed like he was trying to climb on Sam’s bed or got kicked off the bed by Sam during the night.
“Who didn’t want you to stare?” Castiel asked gently, now he stopped rubbing but using his fingertips to intrude between the labia a little. The boy jerked, yelped in a small voice even. But then he cast a quick glance towards Castiel as terrified to anger Castiel.
And Castiel, true to his words, he didn’t smack as half hard as last time. But he guessed the boy’s body was already exhausted by all the wails. In the end, his voice was so used that he couldn’t speak or cry. After Castiel put his legs down, he tried, tried hard to close them, but he trembled too badly to do it.
After their mother died in a fire, their father moved them to another place where he could find some friends and an occasional babysitter. Typically that babysitter had a name of Bobby Singer. But sometimes they just meant nameless people with nameless faces who Sam and Dean would never see again. Sometimes, it made Sam wonder if it was illegitimate for a child like him to claim to the things such as stable, family, acceptance, and home.
He stammered, couldn’t finish the sentence, and Castiel didn’t let him finish either before pressing his hands on the boy’s knees to force him widely open his thighs once again. Castiel knew that the boy already sensed a losing fight. He couldn’t possibly fight off Castiel no matter how hard he tried. Other than accepting the slaps, he couldn’t do anything.
He also understood then what being raised as a Winchester meant, that loneliness was always a huge part of his childhood; that he, the youngest Winchester in the family, was a burden on his father’s shoulder who would never have time to play with him like other children's’ parents had.
“You jerk.” Finally, he muffled out those two words, and turned his head looking outside of the window before his brother could catch him smiling.
Castiel raised his hand and didn’t reserve any strength or mercy, he smacked the most sensitive part of the boy’s body. Hard. With that, he gained a painful shout, an immediate cry.
“Wouldn’t ask for more.,” A glint of triumph lit in Dean’s gaze, and he added with a smirk, palms gently hitting the wheel. “And, um, hey, don’t mess my cassette tapes, bitch.”
When Sam hit 22, his dream partially came true; he had a dorm room 30 minutes away from the slough, and his brother did stop by on a Saturday night.
Castiel sighed internally, he already knew that it was not the boy’s intention to interrupt, but that had to change. He would get himself slapped or bring disasters to the Winchesters and ruin all the purpose of sacrifice.
Castiel used a thick, cooled towel and put it between the boy’s thigh, asking him to clamp his legs tight around it. At this time, even it meant hurt, even the boy suspect it would cause pain, he couldn’t bring himself date to disobey.
“The oak tree,” Sam continued. “Dad never took me to any places, and we never had an oak tree in our backyard.”
“I was nine, Dean!” Sam outstretched his arms in frustration. “He was supposed to be a good dad, at least, telling me not to be afraid of dark or something-”
The boy kept his lips together, but Castiel didn’t need him confirm verbally as they knew next time (oh Castiel was sure there would be a next time) he would punish him as hard if not harder. Until the virgin boy got it in craved in his mind.
Sam didn’t know what his face looked like, maybe he showed an expression that he won’t leave with Dean? Because after those words, Dean sighed irritatingly and muttered “Whatever.” And from the rustling sound of the fabric he brother wore, Sam realized Dean was really going to leave him here.
It was getting darker and darker outside. The only light served Sam and their garage was from the street besides their main house. And it was cold, Sam skipped his breakfast and his lunch as Dean was too distracted to notice, and now he was about to skip his dinner as well. His stomach hurt and his shiver was getting even worse. He almost got a migraine because of the lack of blood sugar, but he was still not ready to go down stairs. For a terrified moment, Sam thought he was gonna die, in the corner of their disregarded garage, without a blanket, without any food or water.
Castiel threateningly put up a finger in front of his delicate nose and cast a cold scold towards him. No need to say another word and the boy abruptly bit his lips and quieted down. But his tears seemed to never stop again. He looked like the world wrong did him, and Castiel was supposed to save him and correct the wrong but only, Castiel wrong did him as well.
“I wish I could know mom,” Sam muttered that one night, when their dad was nowhere to be seen in the house, and now it’s only he and Dean. He murmured under his breath, with his head hanging low and his eyes fixed on the floor. “It would be nice to know her.”
he fixed the hot tub, but he’s been passed out in the dining room since noon. Do you think you guys could check and see if he did or not?”
It had been for the best, but Dean knows it never looks that way when you’re sitting outside your baby brother’s apartment building wondering if he’s eating right. Or when he’s a brat who doesn’t pick up the phone for a year. So, just to make his brother squirm a little, Dean gives him the old “John Winchester thousand-yard glare”.
“Oh, don’t give me that shit. It’s summer school! No one’s gonna do anything and you know it.” She snorted, moving the broom inelegantly over the linoleum floor. “I don’t see the point of spending all those hours in class. I’ll just get my GED like you did.”
Most of the Angels signed back on through the company and proved to be exceptional assets, taking what they had learned about health and business into their new company.
Castiel's eyes prickled in frustration. “I have nothing to offer these people. No partner, no grandchildren, I don't have a 'respectable' job or a degree. I’m going to have to listen to how boring and inept I am all weekend, trapped in a cottage in the middle of nowhere like...like that movie...God, what was it? I can’t remember.”
to be a fantasy. Just something that people could think about instead of all the things they had to think about.
“Of course.” The looks of shock and disbelief from the rest of the table warmed Dean’s heart just a little bit.
Castiel feels Dean tense next to him. He counts slowly and gets to fifteen before Dean sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose with his free hand.
“‘Be less boring’” Dean frowned and looked front and back. Castiel could see in the reflection of the window the slump of Dean’s shoulders and the concern for him it belied.
Dean nods and they stand there for a while together, in no real hurry. Cas is going to stay another night after all. He’ll still be here in the morning and Dean can make him breakfast.
He looked at his reflection in the mirror every morning and asked, “Now what?” He didn’t know where his life was going and couldn’t decide if he was even
With the faintest hint of sarcasm, Michael said, “Call me if anything ‘comes up’.  Goodbye, Castiel.”
“Well, it’s over now,” Chuck grumbles into his chicken breast. “It can’t hurt you. You’ll all get your royalties when I die.”
“Looks good,” Dean commended, eyes taking himself in further, even though he didn’t need to. Behind him, Cas was silent for only a second.
He had no idea when, but at some point, he’d fallen asleep. He remained blissfully under, unbothered by nightmares or coughs wrenched from deep within his chest that woke Dean up with a start. Undisturbed, when Dean did wake up, it was pleasantly slow, eyes blearily blinking as Dean registered in his surroundings, his senses so much clearer… and there was someone right behind him, spooning. As the memories trickled in, Dean realized it was
Dean shrugged. “I don’t know what to tell you. He said he was sorry for driving into me that day – that he never should’ve went out. And that if he could change things, he would’ve. But,” he frowned. “Ultimately, what happened, happened. So he just hoped we could find a way to move on.”
Castiel gave Dean a flat stare. “Yes. Only because you’re being insufferably stubborn… I didn’t pull you out of hell to watch you suffer needlessly.” Dean became more so red-faced, Castiel doubted that increase was due to the fever, and looked down and away, absently scratching at his unkempt stubble.
he still hadn’t wiped the tears away from his face. He knew, technically, they’d be calling him back after they’d reset the markers and everything, for them to shoot the final scene of the episode, where he’d be seated where he fell, ignoring Sam’s phone call and sobbing, mourning Cas’s death.
“You dare test me?” Cas growled. He slammed him against the shower wall, all the breath being punched out of Dean’s lungs. He had no idea how the hell they got in here so quickly without him noticing, but then Cas was biting down on his collarbone, and apart from melting into a puddle of useless goo, Dean wasn’t sure what he was supposed to be doing. “My name causes lowlives on the streets to leaders trembling in fear, and you think you can order me around?”
“I can hear your teeth chattering from down the hall.” See? Definitely just the fever. Flu. Who the hell cared at this point? “It is
“Bitch,” Dean responded automatically, before letting a little bit of genuity slip into his tone. “Kick ass, brother.”
“Vaseline.” Cas answered simply, and then they both stopped talking as Cas pushed a finger in. Dean’s muscles threatened to go lax, slumping against Cas’s readily waiting body, strong and firm behind him. He let out a moan as Cas aimed directly for his prostate, barely stroking more than twice before pulling out, only to return with two fingers.
“Hell, probably even for the baristas at the fancy coffee shop he thinks we don’t know he goes to.” He swiftly changed.
“Of course, Dean.” His fingers were pulled out, and Dean barely had a moment to mourn the loss of being filled before Cas’s cock was nudging insistently at his hole.
“It wasn’t like we could call the hospital, after all,” Cas said dryly. “Not when you’ve been dead for the past six years.”
“Cas’s asking if the body happens to be blond, weird eyed, and matches Azazel on your system?” Dean dutifully repeated. There was a pause before he could hear a flurry of noises, presumably Sam pulling himself to his computer and furiously typing away.
Dean smiled, but it was a shadow of the real thing. “Anyway. Yeah. Bits and pieces of your job,” he smirked, “a certain magazine, uh…” And wasn’t that a weird feeling, the heat rising to his cheeks and undoubtedly giving away his flustered self with a wonderfully awkward shade of red. “Spending time with Cas,” unbidden, the smile he cast at Cas was uncharacteristically shy, but he couldn’t help shuffling in his seat at the same time, because holy hell, if his memories served correctly, than what was he doing talking to his brother right now?
But with Cas, a man he wasn’t even entirely sure what he had to do with Dean’s life, now that he had a physical one… Dean just gave into his instincts, and cuddled impossibly closer.
The last time… wasn’t as memorable as when he was alone, dad off hunting by himself, testing Dean to do his own thing with the coordinates he’d sent his son, and Sam at Stanford – no, he wasn’t going to think about his brother right now, bygones were bygones when he was unwrapping–
“This is my father you’re talking about, Dean,” Cas stated tiredly. “Honestly, half the time I wasn’t even sure he was sane of mind. As much as the average person is, anyway. Our relationship,” he went on, before Dean could say anything. “Was dysfunctional at best.”
“Damn, really? I thought he was all, ‘gung-ho, ain’t no stupid ass virus acting like it’s the damn apocalypse stopping me from doing my work?’”
Inviting himself inside, Castiel sat cross-legged on the right side of Dean’s bed, facing him. When the mattress dipped and was jostled under Castiel as he climbed onto it, he thought Dean would wake up. But hours seemed to go by, Castiel tracing the contours of Dean’s face with his eyes and losing track of time as he took in the tired slump of Dean’s features even when in a fitful sleep, the flush of his fever leaving his cheeks a bright pink, sweat beading at Dean’s forehead. So entranced with making patterns of the constellations of the freckles on Dean’s face, he didn’t notice when Dean opened his left eye to peek at Castiel. “I thought you were over the sleep creepin’ thing. You been there all night?”
Eventually, it was too much though. Not the food, no way. He may have had a full stomach, but Dean wasn’t going to tire of being able to eat again anytime soon.
“Trump? Yeah, dude, you should see the videos they’re making, I swear, every time the guy does something stupid, I’d think, alright. That’s gotta be the height of it. And then he goes and does something bigger.”
Over the commotion of people coming over and stubbornly remaining happy to congratulate Misha on his final scene, Misha looked up and caught Jensen’s eyes over them all.
They were silent as they cleaned each other up, not bothering to break the peaceful calm between them. When they finally got out of the shower, fingers well pruned, and were playfully swatting each other with the towels rather than drying themselves, Cas abruptly became serious.
Before he could even get his throat to work enough to relay the message, Sam was responding. “Yeah, I heard that. Anyway, I gotta go. Madison’s either having a stroke, or she’s horrible at charades and I have to attend the conference call now.”
Like he could sense his thoughts, he was always special like that, Misha drew closer, barely leaving a few inches of space between them. Jensen honestly couldn’t tell who started it first – Dean and Cas, or Jensen and Misha.
“It wasn’t the hunt, Dean.” He placed an arm around Dean as he sagged against Castiel. “You’re ill.”
And Jesus, Dean thought as he gently put the bag on his bed. Had it really been decades since he’d gotten to do something like this?
Cas casually shrugged, but Dean could see right through it. “Bobby’s given you the time off… indefinitely. And you keep complaining about my hygiene – more so than usual, lately. So let’s go somewhere. You’ve always wanted to go to a beach, if I recall correctly, and we could keep each other properly occupied.” He winked salaciously.
Cas stared. And stared some more. And then broke the awkward silence that had descended upon them by letting out a sharp bark of laughter. It sounded unnaturally harsh in the otherwise silence. “You’re joking.” He said. “My father never apologizes, not when it actually matters.”
“Hey,” he said, feeling a little awkward now that he was with her. When Eileen only smiled at him professionally and didn’t look too confused, he hesitantly went on. “So, I was thinking. You see those two studs I came with?” He pointed a thumb over his shoulder without bothering to look, too focused on Eileen’s eyes darting over to the men instead, and lingering on one person in particular. He wasn’t too worried about her eyeing up the wrong man – the first half hour they spent at the beach was making out filthily until Sam threw a bucket of sand on them.
Dean blinked. “Uh, Cas, buddy? The whole world’s dealing with the coronavirus. Ain’t like there’s any place we could go without being able to worry about it.”
When Eileen looked back at him, he tossed her a winning grin. “Well, I’ve got all these elaborate plans for my boyfriend tonight, but you see, that’s gonna leave my brother all alone tonight…” He trailed off. While on the forefront, Eileen looked patiently amused, as if she was humoring her boss’s boyfriend more than anything else, Dean knew a spark of interest when he saw one, and he could work his magic with less.
If Castiel were any more human himself, he’d have given into the human urge to throw his head back and groan at the other man’s almost childish petulance.
Staring back at the keys in his hand, he looked through the back window, Cas’s rigid form a visible contrast from his brother slouching in the seat, listing to the side. His eyebrows furrowing, Sam nonetheless made his way to the driver seat. Getting in, he cast a look at his brother through the rearview mirror, before starting up the car. Things were silent in the backseat until they reached the freeway, Sam unable to help casting intermittent glances at his brother. At one point, Cas shrugged off his trenchcoat and draped it over Dean. Apart from his eyebrows climbing to his hairline, Sam kept his mouth shut. Probably a good thing he was too worried about his brother to try riling Dean up, because when Cas spoke up, his low, gravelly voice was almost swallowed up by the sound of Baby’s wheels eating up the driveway. His ears unconsciously strained to hear Cas’s words.
“Okay, well. I’m awake now. And you need sleep. And I need food. So you’re gonna nap, and I’m gonna veg out until you don’t look like extras from a zombie movie–”
“We should probably tell him…” Cas said doubtfully. Dean could’ve snorted. Looks like he finally wasn’t the only one who knew how bad Sam was at actually acting out on his crushes.
…” His head bobbed back down as he let out a rather toxic smelling burp, but he resolutely came back up to, “No!” This time, Castiel let out a long-suffering sigh.
Sighing, Misha pulled back to let them breathe, because they both knew Jensen would’ve kept going until one of them passed out. Still, he kept close, enough for Jensen to continue pecking at him with every other breath, unwilling to stay apart for as long as it took for them to regain their breaths.
Only, later, the sound of retching drew Castiel to the bunker’s bathroom, and when he found Dean hunched over a toilet, resting his head on crossed arms and mirroring the same pose from back in the kitchen except now over a toilet, Castiel almost held back, annoyed and exasperated. But then Dean retched painfully, and Castiel was inevitably tugged forward as if by an invisible line, unrelenting until he found himself kneeling behind Dean, rubbing a soothing hand over Dean’s back. “Dean, please.” It hurt to see him like this, when Castiel knew for a fact he could do something about it, if only Dean would
His mind was, (not?) for the first time tonight, choosing to be unhelpful by fixating on the one thing he was trying hard not to think about; with the stilettos on, he was several inches taller, even more taller than Cas, and the way Cas had to tilt his head back to meet Dean’s eyes made him think of other circumstances where Cas would have to look up at him, one where they’d be closer instead, Dean’s arms around Cas’s neck as he straddled–
“Dean, just shut up and stay still.” They were in bed, Cas over him, and then out of the blue he found himself bodily manhandled until he was on his side, facing Cas, and – feathers flew around as they began to drape over Dean.
Eyes closed and not bothering to open them, not with the water still hitting them directly in the face anyway, Dean raised his eyebrows. “Oh, yeah?”
Pulling back to stare at Cas’ face as his face slackened with sleep, his deep and even breaths pulled Dean to sleep as well before he even realized what was happening.
“Fuck me, dammit,” he gritted out, and rose to the tips of his toes when Cas only pushed three fingers in him in response. “C’mon, fuck me.”
talks to her.” Dean answered, hiding his smirk by taking a sip. Of the two of them, though, Dean was sooner to approach the girl – if only to secretly ask her to keep the drinks coming on. Normally, Cas wouldn’t approve of Dean getting drunk. However, Dean was feeling like a happy drunk this time – and a happy Dean only equated to a thoroughly satisfied Cas, so he had a feeling it would all workout anyway.
was he doing? “Uh… hey… Cas” He was shaking, and he was totally blaming it on the flu, fever, whatever, but he was still staring, unbilinking at his friend as Cas draped his shirt and tie over his left arm, leaving his wings free to flare out in a display of majestic power. “Wh-whatcha doin’ there, buddy?”
“He was drunk as a sailor when he did?” Sam asked, eyebrows raised. Castiel shrugged, staring at the table as he traced unseen patterns onto it.
A hand clamped onto his shoulder. “Goodbye, Dean.” The final words rang like an executioner’s bell in his head, before he was being forcefully pushed to the side. With a grunt, he rolled over, horrified as he righted himself enough to look–
“Hey, I mean, I’m back to life now, Cas. And besides. It was actually because of your dad that you could see me when no one else could – apart from Sammy. Sounds pretty fair, odd as it is, so I’d have to say no hard feelings,” Dean joked.
“Nope,” Dean stood, shaking his head and crossing his arms. “Frankly speaking, I’m hungry. But I wouldn’t trust either of you to stand in front of the stove right now without setting this place on fire. I’m pretty sure I’d be a better bet. So–”
She let out a chuckle, and Dean honestly couldn’t have felt more at peace at that moment. No frickin’ biological warfare or third world wars, his brother was taken care of for the foreseeable future, and he had a smokin’ hunk of a man to rile up until they could get to the privacy of a bedroom for Cas to screw him to next week. Life was good.
Dean shrugged. “I mean, I don’t know? I’d been dead for almost six years, Sam. It wasn’t like – I didn’t think it was gonna change anything, but I was also kind of in shock that the person that killed me was the father of the guy I’d been boning with a dead dick,” Dean said, and internally grimaced when it came out scathingly.
Nah, he’d won that battle ages ago, and Dean would be damned if he broke that particular streak right now.
Dean rolled his eyes. “And heaven only knows how. Now shut up and lemme get your hair.” He all too happily acquiesced at that, Dean hiding a smirk as he massaged the shampoo into Cas’s hair.
Didn’t have to, when Misha closed the scant distance between them, pressing their lips together in a soft kiss. Closing his eyes again, Jensen gave himself over to the feel and sensation of the kiss, of Misha holding him, the warmth of his lover’s body against his. They’d barely broken apart before Jensen was swooping back in to capture Misha’s lips again, unwilling to let them part so soon. The memories of Cas’s words, hitting so close, so true about someone Jensen genuinely considered a part of himself… it was all still far too fresh, and he knew it would continue to do so for days to come, at least.
“You were Sleeping Beauty in my bedroom. I freaked.” Sam said, looking rather unapologetic. “We’ve been here since we found you. You wouldn’t wake up, but you had a pulse, and we didn’t know what else to do.”
Cas’s eyes was as sharp as he was, and Dean knew the second – when the words had barely just gotten out of his mouth – when Cas understood what Dean was offering – that Dean was offering it all.
He wasn’t making any sense, barely even to himself, but Misha understood, of course, he understood what Jensen was getting at. “It’s okay. There’s only two more episodes, Jensen. The boys… they need this fight. And not to sound prideful, but I think Cas was done justice, getting his ending in his own episode.”
Thoughts of the club in Florida kept his mind entertained until the polish dried, and then he was soon afterwards dismayed to realize that he had, in fact, gotten rusty, but more upsetting was the fact that this was at something he used to consider himself a pro at, once upon a time.
Dean frowned. “We don’t have lube in here.” Even though they kept telling themselves they really needed to stock up in the bathroom.
Richard had come over to them, clapping Misha on the shoulder, congratulating him, and the rest of the crew were following, but Jensen hung back, a gaping hole in his chest leaving him to feel…
“...Fine.” He eventually said reluctantly. Dean nodded, staring far too shrewdly at Castiel, but he didn’t look very victorious either.
Cas raised an eyebrow, and Dean had to suppress the urge to shiver. “I’m gonna take a shower.” He said, and then tilted his head. “Are you gonna join me?” He said, mimicking Dean’s drawl.
When Cas strode back into his room, there was a sort of purposeful determination in his stance, and the sleeves he’d long since pushed up only emphasized the unwavering way he was walking towards Dean now. Confused, Dean warily eyed Cas as he loosened his tie and began to unbutton his shirt, and holy hell what was he doing? His thoughts were only further derailed when Cas’s eyes began to glow blue with grace. The powerful sight wasn’t enough to get Dean to open both his eyes, though, not when he felt like
Swallowing, he twisted open the bottle and meticulously began applying the contents on his nails. Soon, he was pleased to discover that it wasn’t as hard as he thought it would be. Around two decades since he’d gotten to do this, and he thought he’d have gotten rusty…
“No way, Cas. You’re still runnin’ low.” Sam sighed. His stupid, self-sacrificing brother. He may have had a point, though, with Cas having used up most of his grace for the hunt.
“Hey, Jensen. Look at me.” He wasn’t aware he’d ever looked away, but he looked back, now, staring into those cerulean blues… Unbidden, his hands rose without conscious thought, clutching onto the lapels of that damn trench coat, bringing Misha ever closer, until their toes of their shoes were bumping into each other. Resting his forehead against Misha’s, for a second, Jensen just let himself feel the warm puffs of air Misha gently let out with each exhale, soft against his own damp face.
“Rufus is right though,” Herrington said into his coffee. “There are so many other places they coulda picked, why our little town?”
Seated next to him was a kid about 20. She looked like trouble in an old leather jacket and shades, with her blonde hair braided along one side.
They stand there for a moment—Naomi obviously expecting an elaboration and Castiel unable to give her one. She looks heavenward for a moment before turning back to her book, dismissing him with “do get some sleep.”
Austin Public Media, also known as the Roadhouse, was actually a place that Dean knew well. Ellen, the radio manager, had invited out to deliver public safety announcements. Dean would like to think it was because a voice that was as rich and soothing as a glass of whisky in front of the fireplace, but honestly, he was the only one that could string two sentences together on air.
The plug pulsed rapidly and Dean held on to his pen for dear life. He was glad he had been listening to music just before Crowley knocked, the softly playing rock music would drown out any noise if the product didn't live up to its promise of being "Whisper Quiet".
Cas huffs a laugh. The other faculty knew Marie for her intensity and her tendency to talk quite a lot, but Castiel found her sense of drama endearing. She was easily his favorite student.
He had given Cas the abridged version of his childhood. He doesn’t have to tell Cas how he learned to fire a gun before he learned that math had letters, or what the tattoo on his chest was for. He doesn’t tell him what the family business was. Those are facts, but they aren’t important. Not really.
As they did the walkthrough, Cas, or Castiel with no last name, pointed out the things Charlie needed to know about the house’s maintenance and about how the Chicken Ranch operated.
He follows her back through the cubicals to what Cas assumes is the staff lounge. The soda machine in the corner kicks on tiredly. Nancy puts her hand on Cas’s arm and winces when he jumps.
The brunet gives him a questioning look, and the blonde snaps: “Really? Do you think we would stoop to—“
So to the studio, Dean would go. Fine by him. That day had been a complete bust. He could use a nice long drive out in Baby.
The red vinyl bar stool sighed as Dean chuckled and sat down with Charlie taking a seat on his other side.
Sam met Eileen shortly after coming to Joshua. They’ve been seeing a lot of each other, but they aren’t dating. Not yet. It’s only been a few months since things ended with Jessica and even though he’s sort of ready to jump back on the horse, Eileen deserves more than “sort of.”
“Charlie, call Jody,” Dean barks in the voice his father gave him. Charlie snaps to attention and scrambles for her phone.
Castiel sighed. He knew that. It was nice to hear it, though. “It’s okay. We both said things I’m sure we regret saying.”
He looks at her, cocking his head to the side. She reaches into her purse and pulls out a book. Dean looks at the artistic photo of a Cactus in bloom on the cover, impressed. He’d kill to get his plants to look like that.
Cas his confusion changed to something like curiosity and tempered hope. Charlie’s chest ached. “I—uh, oh boy.” She got down on her knees next to him. “The truth is—before I got to Gilbert, I was looking for a place to hide. I made some people pretty mad.”
When it turned out Dean wasn’t Ben’s father, Lisa ended the relationship by saying she had been experiencing the “baby blues” and needed to sort her life out.
“what are you smiling about, Castiel?” Cas looks up to find a twitch in the corner of his sister’s mouth that looks suspiciously like a smirk.
Cas and Naomi watch Gabriel flail giggling children around the front yard. While he didn’t have children or a family of his own, Gabriel is easily the most successful of the Novak children. They’re all proud of him, even if no one (besides, now, Castiel) knows what it was he actually does.
Castiel looks surprised for a moment. Dean’s surprised himself. He opens his mouth to play cool but Cas blurts, “I—Yes. Yes, I’d like that.”
Crowley threw his head back and laughed. Substituting one obnoxious accent for another, he said: “Afraid not, Sheriff. I’m fresh off the boat.” He gestured around to the room with a playful smirk. “Texas just fits my style. Everything’s
Castiel turned to look at him surprised and the side of his cheek met one of Dean’s snow chilled fingers. They warmed on contact. Dean offered Castiel a small smile as he stroked over his cheekbone with his thumb. He leaned in and planted a gentle, chaste kiss on Cas’s mouth.
Claire slammed a hand down on the vanity table. “Bullshit! If you really thought that, you wouldn’t have left Pontiac! You would have gone right into the family business like dad. You have expectations, Cas!”
Gabriel and Michael come out next with Naomi between them, caught between their argument. Michael is losing badly and is, therefore, more animated than normal.
When Dean found out, he introduced Cas to audiobooks so he could feed his brain before it turned to mush. It hadn’t taken him very long to blow through all of Dean’s recommendations. Enjoying their book discussions too much to have them end, Dean introduced him to Joshua’s Unofficial Book Club.
“You’re going to be having that big, ‘Friendsgiving’ shindig aren’t you?” Dean asked, sitting on his porch chair.
He stepped back and Cas read "half..." He crossed his arms over his chest, but the smile was undeniable "Dean I’m not sure that's entirely accurate."
When he cuts Baby’s engine in the driveway, he can hear Miracle barking in the house. By the time he gets out, he’s hoping excitedly and smelling the courtyard fence.
He had been fine—Until he heard Crowleys scratching, growling voice cry out from the center of the gazebo: “There is Loveless copulation going on, and it must stop!”
Henriksen huffs a laugh and takes the seat opposite Cas at the table. He straightens his tie and asks, “you mean your voice always sounds like that?”
“No, that’s okay, Sam. I’d probably see him again before I see you.” Cas said with a small lopsided smile. Sam frowned deeply, which was Castiel’s cue to get out of there before Sam started talking about
“I hate it here,” Cas grumbles as he picks the phone back off the bed where he’s tossed it. “In any case, I think that’s as good as a tour of this nightmare is going to get.”
He pockets his phone and pads over to his room to throw himself back into bed. There’s no one around to judge him for getting a few more moments of rest. Cas dozes off and when he wakes, it’s to another text message from his friend.
A rock settles in Dean’s stomach, and he gets up to get Cas another beer before Sam can ask any more follow-up questions. He orders a glass of Kentucky Whisky and hides out at the bar for a while, licking his wounds.
Eileen nods and digs her phone back out of her pocket to type. Sam pulls his phone and reads: “He’s a lot better with his words if he has time to think about them first.”
Claire makes a gagging sound and Cas looks up, alarmed. Dean glares at her. “You alright over there, Claire?”
“Ready to walk back?” Cas asks, blue eyes squinting through the glare of midday over the top of his “Save the bees” mask.
Sam was worried and kept trying to get his mind off the Ranch and Cas by taking him to lunches with the constituency in Gilbert. Which is how, just before Christmas, Dean found himself stuck at Lisa’s Cafe listening to the local business folk bitch and moan about the loss in buisness.
She shakes her head. “He sent it to a couple publishers, but he hasn’t heard from any of them.” She sighs as if this wasn’t the first time she’s had to say, “I don’t know why he’s bothering. Those places take months. There are plenty of ways to get a book made.”
Curiosity gets the better of him, so he clicks on a few videos. When neither the first nor the second feature any cameos of his brother or his ex-boyfriend, Cas looks at their quality. One, a story about a stuffy professor trying to get out of a speeding ticket, makes him laugh so hard he forgets it’s a porno until the highway patrol officer is railing him over the hood of the car. It doesn’t surprise him that that particular piece was written and directed by his older brother, the family comedian.
The Angels grimaced and looked at each other nervously. They were very much at the Sheriff’s mercy. Silence rang throughout the house. Nobody at the door dared to do more than breathe.
He walked with her to the kitchen where Ruby was getting a bottle of water from the refrigerator. He crossed his arms, watching as she stood in front of the open door, uncapped the bottle, and drank.
As the last of the girls left, Cas decides he’ll stop on the way home and pick up ice cream for Dean’s pie tonight. Those extra bites will keep Dean in good company and comfort just that much longer. Maybe long enough to persuade him to stay for a beer and some television.
Dean chuckles. Benny taps on his desk. “I’m gonna go get those files from the Chief.” The phone buzzes again. Benny smiles a bit to himself and then turns to “Leave him to it.”
"Just-" Dean scrambled for something to offer them so he could make a timely exit. The plug picked that moment to shift to a more urgent pace, he blurted "Ma-ake them pink! I don't know! I gotta piss like a racehorse!"
She said with another warm smile, “I know. You’ve got a big heart, Sheriff. Always kinda wished I could have a bigger place in it.”
The shimmer of laughter in his eyes and mischief in the corners of his lips reminded Charlie of her father when he was alive. Not in anything concrete; he and Castiel looked nothing alike (her father wouldn’t have been able to pull off that shade of lipstick...or the breastplate), but they shared the same pre-joke leer.
Castiel considers his father with a raised eyebrow and says something he should have said years ago: “Dad, even though we joke about what a horrible writer you are, I don’t think any of us believe you have to rely on prophetic visions to write
Being jostled about in the cabin had made the restraints a little tighter. Every time Dean pulled against the tie that kept his wrists in place, tingles shot up from them to the base of his skull and back down towards the arch of his feet. He racked his brain to think of something other than the thread count in the tie. In a gruff voice, he asked, “What did you say your name was again? It sounds familiar.”
The grass crunched behind him. He whipped around to find Dean Winchester looking every bit as sheepish as he did twenty years ago.
He takes another sip of coffee before saying, “Saw some really nice houses up for sale in town. It’d be closer to work for both of you. I’ll talk to Max’s sister, Alicia, and see what kind of deal she can get you. “
He doubles back and reads the titles more carefully, unsurprised but still a bit touched that there are a lot of poems written about their childhood.
“Damn it. Okay, you keep trying the house, I’ll call Dean.” Kevin said fishing out his phone as Claire got back onto the road. Dean didn’t answer either. “We’ll probably have to go pick him up. Claire take this road and go straight through town, I’ll tell you when to turn.”
The sun is sinking into the horizon, casting purple shadows over the town and setting the sky on fire through a hazy curtain of dust. Dean gets into his sandblasted pick-up and heads home.
In the kitchen, Michael, Anna, and Lucifer were sipping drinks and making dinner. Well, Michael was making dinner, Anna was mostly watching, and Lucifer was lounging at the table. Dean said in his firm but friendly manner, “It was my fault. I was meeting my brother for lunch and things got away from me.”
Lately, though, things had escalated. Dean had had to stamp out a bag of dog poop on the porch last night. Cas didn't own a dog. And now there were explosives involved.
Some of the titles refer to Heaven and Angels, and Sam isn’t sure why they’re there. Dean wasn’t big on religion growing up. He wonders if that’s another new thing; did he join a religion? Or a cult? Or...
“Oh Please! You’ve been moping since you got here and the only time anyone sees you smile is when you’re looking at your phone.” She says, bumping his shoulder with hers. “You better bring him next time.”
Dean swallows down some half-formed comment about “Flesh Ferrari’s” when Cas strokes the delicate skin of his inner thighs feather-light so that it tickles. He’s watching Dean again, looking for something; Dean doesn’t know what. Doesn’t know what to offer him as his hands slide down to the cleft of his ass. He feels the swipe, the gentle pressure of a finger pad as it grazes his hole before the hand departs to relearn the heft of his erection.
Benny comes back with bear claws and coffee. Dean smirks and asks him if his wife, Andrea, let him off the diet she put him on.
Nancy laughs; a full-bodied and beautiful thing. Some truckers, the ones who are old enough to be her father, smile faintly.
“I could run a tech blackout for the night, just in case. I mean, it wouldn’t stop someone from recording, but they’d probably have to drive outside Gilbert to upload,” Charlie added.
Castiel’s secretly pleased when he realizes Ms. Sunder has missed rehearsals for a second day in a row.
“She knows,” Hannah says. She doesn’t roll her eyes, but she doesn’t have to. “Dean Winchester has been water cooler talk for weeks now.”
It takes Castiel a minute, but he shakes his head, smiling. “Not so much. I have seven incurably nosy sisters, none of whom knock. I don’t think I’ve been brave enough to do it inside the house.”
Sam’s glad no one ever asked him because, at 18, he probably would have been a dick and added something like: “if he made it that long”.
Bess cupped Castiel’s face and patted it gently. “Cas, you’re family. To all of us in Gilbert. We know that the Chicken Ranch is your home. But it isn’t your whole life.”
Until Dean had mentioned him, Sam had forgotten about Uncle Bobby. While they waited for him, Dean tried to jog his memory. The most Sam could conjure to mind was a man that looked a lot like Santa Claus and had a pleasant rumbling voice.
But while it’s true that his exposure to the romance genre was accidental, it wasn’t as if his work had been totally devoid of romance. It’s just much less subtle now that he had a better understanding of what people were looking for. His students, his peers, and the readers of
Dean sits up straight like Maritza showed them and draws in a lungful of high-desert air slowly, counting five heartbeats before releasing. He closes his eyes and pushes the air out of his body, holding himself empty for another few beats.
“I’m running for Governor,” Dean said, allowing his smile to burst forward. Castiel smiled too, wide and gummy, filled to the seams with pride and untameable love for the man in front of him.
He scrubs his face with his free hand. “Yeah. I wrote a book. I sent it off to a couple places. Won’t know if it gets picked up anyplace till, like, April.”
Sam continues, moping at the ring under his water glass with his paper napkin, “I still have all that money from Dad’s life insurance and my own savings just sitting in the bank. And Crowley might be a dick, but he’s going to pay me more than he should.” Sam stole a glance at Dean. “I should really tie it up, you know?”
“Don’t you be helping her!” One guest said, pointing a finger at Castiel when he came to stand behind her.
A light went on inside of Cas and he nodded. “Yes. I—I think I am.” He looked back at the house. “The house is mine, but it’s a lot of house for one person. I’d have to sell it.”
“Yeah, and we got a problem, Dean. Crowley and those Hellhound guys are on their way to the Chicken Ranch.”
“Dean, I don’t sweat, under any circumstances.” Dean laughs but then frowns when he realizes he doesn’t actually have any evidence to the contrary.
“That’s all I’m asking.” Dean swats Cas where his ass should be under all that coat and says, “Go get some sleep.”
It takes him hours, but he finally sleeps. The next few days chained to a desk in his mother’s offices drag and the only relief Cas gets is when he’s able to shoot a few texts messages off to Dean when his mother isn’t looking. After the first day, Naomi moves on from taxes to other business matters that she wants Cas to look over.
“Really.” He turned to examine himself in the mirror, pulling at the skin around his eyes with a grimace. He sighed and let his hand fall down onto the vanity. “Besides, Everyone’ll be so distracted with Thanksgiving, no one will look this way. Least of all Sheriff Winchester.”
Castiel grimaced and rubbed the corners of his eyes. Crowley was looking to be a bit more trouble now that he thought about it.
Castiel dialed her number, counting the rings and looking out the large living room windows that overlooked the small, frozen-over pond. Meg's sultry voice cut through the quiet of the cabin. “Look who’s calling back. You’re lucky you still have a job.”
He looked up at them, tired and rankled, in a nightshirt and a comfortable grey robe. With a sigh, he told Meg, “I just gave Dean my word that we’d close for two months. “
Cas whips his head to Dean questioningly before his features sag, “There was always the possibility you were an alien too, but I supposed I should have known better.” Castiel was slouching, wistfully looking at the sky now.
Anael brushes off the porch steps half-heartedly, saying “Just eat it. It’ll put hair on your chest. Part one of the taste test.”
: only surviving child of Naomi Novak and heir of Novak Corp. This man is wealthy beyond measure/ I’m asserting today that the Chicken Ranch isn’t some little pissant country place at all, but a money-laundering scheme for Novak Corp.”
As if on cue, the boy threw his cigarette down, grimacing as he stamped it out with his clunky combat boot and started over to the car, dragging the hose behind him.  Sam watched him stop and cock his head when he saw Bobby had passengers.
Dean tried to come up with something to throw Sam off the scent. But it turned out he didn’t need to. Cas called out in a booming voice from the other side of the shared fence: “FIRE IN THE HOLE!”
But right now, he looks much better without it. He'd look even better naked. Dean pushes him backwards, towards the bedroom. They get there eventually, and this year they only knocked a few frames off the wall instead of taking out the Christmas tree. Down Cas goes onto the bed with a gentle "oof".
an evisceration,” Claire snarks as her phone goes off next to her. “I’ll be ‘with you in spirit’, Cas—Oh my God. Ms. Sunder’s dead.”
“That’s because-!” Dean dropped his voice down low and Cas laughed the loudest Sam had ever heard him laugh.
“Awe, now you’ve gone and done it. I hate whoever told you about that stupid legend,” swears Claire. She turns to the kid who asked and says, “Cactus cat is Dean’s hat trick.”
And he was. Where a life on the road had taught Sam to appreciate minimalism, Dean had become someone who liked his knick-knacks and mementos. He didn’t mindlessly consume things either; he had preferences.
was a sin.” Dean winced and Castiel reached up to smooth his face. “His wife was nice enough. She’d tuck us in and tell us the angels would watch over us.”
“The worst that would have happened would be that people would accuse us of being fun.” Castiel burst into a surprised laugh at the thought of Garth and Bess, Gilberts most married couple, coming to the Ranch for the nightlife.
Whatever she had given him, Castiel took it, thanking her and sounding almost touched. The clerk giggled and went about pumping the gas. While they waited for the tank to fill, she made small talk.
Still inside of him, Cas runs his hands again along the expanse of his prostrate body, panting from his release. Dean feels the hot drop of a tear on his back like a punch to the solar plexus. But he realizes he can’t say anything about it. His own eyelashes are cold on his flushed face, and his nose is running. He wipes them both on his pillow with a grimace as Cas pulls out of him and discards the condom. He swats at Dean to move over on the bed so that he can lie down.
She picks up her box cutter again and grumbles, “Heaven’s overrated. Get yourself a damn dog and be happy.” To Dean’s stunned expression and Max’s cooing, Claire blushes and shouts. “Or jump up your own asses and die for all I care!”
Castiel’s face heated a bit and his gut twisted uncomfortably. Dean really was always watching out for him, and this entire party was a slap in the face of that.
Anna sauntered out, barefooted and in a fetching night gown, holding something out to him. “You forgot this in my room!”
He stepped inside to find the house thrashed. The Crowleys Hellhounds had not been kind. Papers from the writing desk in the hallway where the old landline sat were scattered all over the foyer. Someone cast bedclothes and whole drawers of lace underthings down the stairs.
She was right. He hated the thought of working an office job. While his income would be more stable, a forty-hour or more workweek would leave zero time to work the commissions he enjoyed and even less time for his own projects. An artless life was difficult for him to imagine without making his fillings ache.
With a knowing smile, Garth asked, “You pick up another one of your strays sheriff?” He turned to Charlie and stuck his hand out, “Garth Fitzgerald the 4th”
Cas hears the scrape of work boots on pavement as Dean drops down next to him. “I was in the neighborhood. Look, I’m gonna need you to stay still until the paramedics can check you out. You’ve probably got a concussion and you’re bleeding like a 90s Cage match.” Dean mutters, “What the hell happened, man?”
Charlie watched as a Blonde woman in a leather jacket got out of the car, and came around the passengers’s side, leaning cooly against it.
Castiel shakes his head. “I think the existence of aliens would prove God’s moved on and that we are very much alone.”  Tilting his head in and dropping his voice down to a rumble, he adds with a wink, “Even so, I can’t help but be a fan of his work.”
As Castiel stuffs the papers he had been grading into his briefcase, Marie approaches him, biting her lip.
Dean laughed at him. “Well yeah, Cas. I’m a hunter, a good one. And you’ve got the drop on me a few times and we’ve only known each other for, what, a day? That’s not just interesting, that’s downright impressive.”
“Oh, no!” Dean said, holding the phone away from him “I’m going to see what embarrassing things you put in your profile…” he skimmed the screen “Castiel
“Yeah! That would be great.” She looks pleasantly surprised before narrowing her eyes. “You’re planning something.”
The audience gasped. Dean and Claire rolled their eyes. Every Texan knew the state had several whorehouses in it. Dean would bet that every mind in this room was bouncing through two or three of them.
“That seems like a lot of paperwork when I’m doin’ you a favor by drivin' out here to pick you up. Doesn’t it, Cas?”
Deep down he knows the answer, so he’s unsurprised when Max shakes his head. “Worse, if anything.” When Dean passes the register to get the broom, Max calls after him, “I’m serious about getting a dog.”
“Glad you think it’s funny,” Cas says putting in his earphones and laying down on his bed. The headboard looks handmade and solid.
When Dean shrugs, Max adds firmly but not unkindly, “Either you tell me or you’ll tell Pam over at Lee’s and wake up hungover and out a hundred dollars.”
Henriksen continues the interview, asking questions about the week Ms. Sunder went missing, the assault, and the photos. Two hours later, he sighs, closing his folder.
Cas hadn’t been a very difficult sell on the whole “monsters are real” thing. In fact, he had been so unsurprised by it that Sam wondered if he even believed a word of it. Bobby pointed out that Cas was a smart kid and had lived next door to a hunter his whole life.
Sam shifts his weight back and forth before his curiosity breaks him and asks sheepishly, “Do you think you could send me a copy of it?”
Still. Cas with a crimson mask was pretty high on the list of things that kept him up at night. And he wasn’t getting that much sleep to begin with. Not with what happened to Lily Sunder. Dean had walked through her home Thursday night and his first thought wasn’t about her passing, her body or her killer. With every snap of the Forensic tech’s camera, all he could think was:
The next few minutes a violent blur as every member of this impromptu mosh pit gets a healthy serving of whoop-ass.
“Dean, this place makes money. But that’s because I run it off of every penny. Two months with no income is—I mean we’ve made it through the Great Depression, sure. And there have been sometimes where we weren’t pulling in
She doesn’t look convinced. Her sunglasses shine in the bar lights, making her look like a hungry spider. Even without seeing him, she had a stare that rivaled Cas’s. He squirmed on his stool. It was how she usually got him to open up, pure intimidation and strong booze.
“Thanks,” Charlie said. Ruby almost smiled and went off towards a pack of people who were putting away lounge chairs and tanning lotion.
“Good, I can give you your Christmas present then.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small package that looked much like the Christmas present he had received from Dean years ago.
He heard Crowley say, “Care to comment, sheriff?”, but ignored him, squinting through the dark for the door. He pushed open the auditorium doors to find no one in the hallway.
“What… what about my father do you–” Cas cut himself off, looking conflicted, but Dean understood what he couldn’t say, what was weighing on his – and no doubt Sam’s – mind.
“I… it’s kinda slow. I’m just seeing bits and pieces right now,” Dean said slowly, cradling his refilled glass. “Like, flashes. I remember the most randomest things,” he said with a wry chuckle. “Uh, the funeral… Sam’s dorm room… your graduation?” He glanced at Sam, eyebrows furrowing as he thought. “You looked ridiculous in that cap. I swear, it’s the hair, man. Hey, now that I’ve got some tangible limbs, you could give me five minutes–”
Dean smirked as he put the phone back to his ear, vaguely aware of the tap being turned back on. “He says no.”
Dean snorted. Talking about his brother’s secretary who had a crush on him – entirely unrequited, except for when they were blowing off steam. Honestly, Dean wasn’t sure how it worked, except apparently, Sam “
Jensen’s breath caught in his throat, at the words. “I know. God, Mish, I know.” Swallowing, his fingers flexed.
They hung up without further fanfare, and no longer at the risk of traumatizing his brother, Dean was free to give Cas his full attention. He eyes his boyfriend up and down with exaggeratedly slow movements. “You just gonna stand there?” He drawled.
They ended up going back to bed, and didn’t leave for another few hours. They might’ve lost Cas’s shirt under Dean’s bed too, but neither of them particularly cared with how enamored Dean unabashedly let himself be with Cas’s wings.
Dean swallowed again, feeling ashamed – no, bashful, he wouldn’t be ashamed, but he could be – he could be embarrassed, his own flesh was making a fool of himself – but he wasn’t a fool, a-a clown, or anything else he hadn’t heard directed at his face, but he knew was said, when they thought he couldn’t hear, when they felt he wouldn’t retaliate because Dean may have looked
help it.” Cas cut him off, eyes dangerous through the blue light. “Even without my grace.” His chest was puffed out and his head held up high, and oh, Dean shifted uncomfortably as Cas’s voice was definitely snarling now. “…And you’re going to let me.”
“Dean?” Cautious and hesitant, the voice was quiet, as if unwilling to disturb the rest of the bunker’s occupants, while still being loud enough to pierce through the wooden door and reach through to Dean inside.
“So… do you remember what happened?” Cas’ voice was as shaky as his body, a fine tremor in his hands concealed by holding onto Dean’s. Their fingers interlaced, Dean held back just as tight. The disbelief he felt was mirrored on his brother and – boyfriend? – Cas’s face.
“C-Cas?” He felt his cheeks heating up, but something told him it wasn’t because of whatever sickness ailed him the night before.
Well. If he ever had another night like this, screw everything else. He was definitely going to make Cas do the eyeliner for him, no matter what. He’d deal with his cock, straining to embarrass himself, just like he was right now, keeping his waist pressed to the sink.
Misha tilted Jensen’s head up, making him meet Misha’s eyes. “It’s okay,” he repeated. “We knew this was coming, didn’t we?” He didn’t let Jensen look away again, no matter how much he wanted to. “It was a long time coming. Cas and Dean – they deserved this. Cas telling how he felt, Dean hearing it…” he gently frowned. “But we’re still here, Jensen. This may be the end of one story, a legacy… but we still have each other.”
And, oh, come on. Cas had to know that Dean would fight as hard as he could if only to jibe back at Cas, it was a game they played on purpose after all. And Dean wasn’t that far enough yet, to have been completely rendered speechless, or brainless. But hell if he had no complaints with Cas getting him there. “I don’t know, buddy. You see me trembling?” He managed to get out. “Personally, I think I’ve got you wrapped around my finger, Mr. Scary Mob Boss–
“Dean…” He was shivering, head buried on his arms crossed on the kitchen table, shivering. There was a half finished bowl of soup neglected in front of him. He’d forcefully made Castiel take his trenchcoat back, so he’d shrugged it back on, secretly thrilled that it smelled of Dean.
“Don’t worry.” Cas sounded far more calmer in comparison. He placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder before receding, drawing his wings back “Your fever has broken.” Cas got up, swinging his legs over the side of the bed. His voice cracked with uncertainty as he went on. “I…I apologize for the intrusion.” When Dean, unsettled, peeked over his shoulder, he saw Cas looking down, his shoulders slumped as his wings faded from view. Dean blinked, wide-eyed, trying to process the sight of Cas’s wings completely disappearing, except for a few stray feathers pulled free and was now slowly drifting down. With his wings gone, Cas began to put his shirt back on.
So he did the only thing he could do, even though really, he was as uncertain about the future as Cas was, and how even Sam was. His overgrown brother was undoubtedly agonizing over what was going on and what was going to happen as much as Cas was.
Jensen blinked, feeling shaken. Misha immediately dropped his battle ready stance, except rather than preparing to fight, he’d been ready to give himself to the Empty’s clutches, sacrificing himself for the world… for Dean.
” What Dean (kinda) cared about was how Cas’s voice could possible go lower, until he was practically growling, and hang on a second now–
Mind at war, he quickly chose and cast away various arguments. The winners for both sides were shame, primarily, but it was still being defeated by the fact that this was Cas, and above everything, after everything, Dean knew Cas wouldn’t care.
Or he could man up and… Dean snorted at himself with the choice of words. A bunch of other phrases flitted through his head, from ‘no time like the present,’ to ‘an opportunity as rare as this…’
He gasped as Cas harshly grinded the heel of his palm against his dick through his jeans, and then yelped as his zipper was unceremoniously pulled down. “Careful with the merchandise, you asshat!” He tightened his grip on the back of Cas’s neck, both in warning and in pain.
At the moment, his tongue was still fighting a war of its own, deciding whether to side with his mind or body.
“Uh,” Dean craned his head as he yelled out. “Hey, Cas, did you murder a guy and dump his corpse on Fourth Ave?”
Dean stared blankly. “You’re joking.” At Cas’s continued staring, turning more unimpressed by the second, he backtracked. “You’re… not joking?” He let out a disbelieving laugh when Cas only continued to stare evenly. “Jesus,” shaking his head, he rubbed a hand over his face. “Fuck it. You know what? Fine. I’m gonna go stir crazy if I have to stay cooped up any longer anyway.”
sorry, Dean.” He looked up, face so passionate and beseeching, it stole Dean’s breath when he was met with the full intensity of those eyes. “On my father’s behalf, I apologize. That’s why I brought you to the hospital – to explain, what I knew, anyway. And to express my remorse, because it was my father’s fault that your life was stolen from you, and there is nothing I can actually say or do that will make up for that.”
Sam snorted over the line. Whatever he said in response went unheard over the sound of the front door opening, and Dean pulled the phone away and pressed it to his shoulder. “Hey, babe!” He called out before Cas even came into view.
“Scoot,” he said shortly, not even waiting for Cas to budge an inch before he was crawling on top of the man, covering most of Cas with his limbs in an awkward embrace as he tried to make himself as comfortable as he could without falling off. “I’m right here. I’m fine and dandy. I’m breathing and alive. So go the fuck to sleep, will you? I’ll be right here when you wake up. I promise.”
him, for heaven’s sake. It really shouldn’t have come as a surprise when Dean surfaced enough to protest rather vehemently for having only seconds prior puked majority of the contents of his stomach out.
“So, yeah, it’s supposed to involve a lot of video calls, but personally, I have a feeling the prosecutor is gonna use that against the case. Hell, I probably will too.”
Sam shot him a dubious look, and although it wasn’t intended as a warning, Dean realized he should probably be pacing himself. God, he’d been dead for years, who knew what state his tolerance and organs were? It wasn’t like he could check with a doctor for the latter, but some self-experimenting would probably do perfectly fine for the former.
Unfortunately, the distant sound of a bell reminded Jensen that he wasn’t done filming his scenes yet, and Misha was just as well aware of it.
Cas hummed, hooking his chin over Dean’s other shoulder, nuzzling at Dean’s jaw. “Nuh-uh,” he said, albeit with some difficulty, revealed in the strain in his voice. “Wash your hands first.” He reminded, though not without an eye roll of his own.
The grin slipped away as easily as rain as the more he dug through them, more memories slid to the surface. Sitting back in his chair, he let his hands fall free from Cas’s hold. “I remember your father,” Dean said somberly, and like he was waiting for it, Cas’s eyes closed. He swallowed and silently nodded, seemingly to himself, before he opened his eyes again.
Castiel muttered in Enochian as he withdrew his hand. He vaguely heard Sam give out a small snort, but he was already angrily walking away.
This thoughts warred with each other again, trying to make Dean focus on something he didn’t want to; there was one prominent way this would end up, and instead of Cas’s hands around his waist, pulling Dean in by the corset, it would be delicately balancing the eyeliner instead…
The girl in question was working their drinks and among the staff tending to the island – the only other people Cas allowed on his island to be employees hired after some strict screening. Not just for the virus.
“Hey,” Misha’s voice was soft, cautious but open, and Jensen raised his head from where he’d let it drop, peering at Misha through foggy eyes.
“The hell are you doing, Cas? I told you I–” Cas pulled off his shirt, revealing well defined abs and, oh, yeah, Cas had a friggin’
Cas didn’t back down, though. Taking it, he took his time inspecting it, as if analyzing it would teach him how to make the perfect wing on each side, and then he was done, and was striding forward, glitching Dean’s brain by trapping him against the sink–
Dean swallowed. He wasn’t going to fool anyone trying to remain seated and look unaffected, so he shot up to his feet and practically tossed himself at his boyfriend, pride be damned. “You gonna persuade me?” He moaned, letting his head fall back as Cas, clearly annoyed at being interrupted from kissing Dean, moved his lips to Dean’s throat.
Cas cocked his head at Dean’s words, but the look in his eyes told Dean he knew what exactly was going through Dean’s head. “Tell Sam not to bother mentioning it. Really.”
“You should go,” he said, keeping his voice low. “You just need to finish the one scene, and then we can leave.” Slowly, he pulled back, disentangling himself from Jensen. Hating them both for it, Jensen let him go, mournfully watching Misha take a step back, and then another. Misha smiled at him anyway, even as he stepped back one last time, giving Jensen enough space to leave, too much space away from Misha.
but his head was hung back, a thermometer in his mouth. If Castiel couldn’t tell Dean was sick from the fact that he was willingly holding a book that could potentially count as research, then he’d have to have been senseless to not notice the germs practically radiating from Dean. Unbidden, Castiel’s pointer finger came up to Dean’s forehead, remembering himself only an inch away before his fingertip could come in contact.
chose to express yourself, how you are right now… it is truly an honor to be allowed to see you like this.”
His boyfriend appeared, adorably ruffled and looking no less weary. His coat was slung over a shoulder, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and tie loosened. Dean realized he might need to cut his call with his brother short.
Sam could easily see that for himself. His brother was beginning to flush from what was most likely a fever. And still, Dean slurred out a protest. “M’not sick. M’ just tired.”
Dean sighed happily, letting Cas mindlessly pound away, milking himself through his orgasm. When his pace finally slowed, he tried to turn his head as best as he could, letting his fingers card through wet hair before gently cradling the side of Cas’s face to draw him into a kiss.
“Gimme a sec,” he murmured to Cas. Apart from his boyfriend ignoring his words in favor of eyeing him – he knew going bare chested with only shorts would be a good idea, the sun did wonders at giving him a fast tan –  Cas didn’t say anything, so he swiftly made his way to Eileen.
Dean gasped, hips bucking as his hole was stretched a little too quickly. Cas let his other hand fall free from Dean’s hip, and reached out. The shower starting up and cascading warm water on them was a jolt to Dean’s system, and he yelped, only to cut off in a high pitched keen that felt like it came from his chest as Cas focused on his prostate.
“It’s okay,” he repeated, not for the first time, and probably wouldn’t be the last. He’d keep it up, Jensen knew, for as long as it took for Jensen to actually believe Misha. “I won’t be going anywhere – I’ll be waiting for you.”
, I think you’re wrong. If anyone’s wrapped around someone here, it’s you around me.” He grinded their dicks against each other, making his point. Even through the multiple layers, Cas’s hard on was impressive, and the friction was glorious to an already on-edge Dean.
Dean’s mind was his own when he thought of how else Cas’s hand could be of actual help, but his body went one step ahead without permission and turned around.
Either way, the close proximity was a familiar warmth, one he’d eagerly sucked in even as he tried to ignore how he wouldn’t get this again, not like he’d gotten to–
But he just needed the few minutes to himself, to convince himself that it wasn’t real, that it was just the character, not real–
Dean immediately grimaced. “Ugh, please,” he winked at her. “Just call me Dean.” He took that moment to place his empty cocktail glass on the wooden bartop. “And could I get another one of this? And also something stronger – but not
Distantly, he could hear the tap turning off, cutting off the stream of water before Cas replied. “Blond, weird eyes, might hit a match on their database if they look up Azazel?” He called back.
Granted, it didn’t take much effort, but it was a matter of spirit. And Cas’ finally allowed him to give in with those words, falling asleep within seconds.
with his nose tucked between Dean’s shoulder blades, and – oh, yeah – wings securely around Dean. With the abrupt realization practically slamming into him, Dean gasped.
“That was the end,” Jensen whispered, eyes fluttering closed as Misha brought his hands up to cup Jensen’s face. “The damned end, Mish. All these years, and I get it, I do… but they–you deserved to have stuck with us to the end, man.”
“You don’t get to decide that.” Dean looked up, but then his posture turned defensive as he grabbed at Castiel’s hand.
Dean grinned. “Sam says thanks!” He called out, just as Cas came back into view. He promptly lost his train of thought, because the fucker was now unbuttoning his shirt, coat and tie gone. He was still wearing an undershirt, but he might as well haven’t been because it was absolutely drenched in sweat that it was transparent, and Dean could see right through it. He gulped.
, and he was still being selfish.” Cas suddenly slumped in his chair, dragging a hand over his tired face. “I– I am
patient…” he said apologetically. “So if you still want to help, you’re either just gonna have to ignore his B.S., or give him a taste of his own medicine.” He looked pointedly at Cas. “Got it?”
Jensen swallowed, trying to shake the remnants of a character bleed away before it could truly sink its talons in him. Still, feeling unsteady, he rose to his feet.
“No, Sam. I’m secretly having an affair and refer to my booty call with endearments on a regular basis.” Cas tossed him a look of equal parts amusement and exasperation as he disappeared around a corner, presumably to the bathroom to wash up. He better have been heading to the bathroom. Dean was pretty sure his boyfriend missed a spot of blood on his forearm.
– was safe. “Yeah, you go figure out what she’s saying, Sammy. I’m sure she could benefit from some mouth-to-mouth or hands-on lessons on how to win at charades, whichever it is.”
“Hey!” He protested, but then had to bite back another moan as Cas brought his hand down again before plastering himself to Dean’s back.
Without taking his eyes away from his laptop, Sam reached over to the side and grabbed his headphones. “Nope.”
Dean nodded. “And I, being tied to Sammy, only knew things from his perspective, so we were both pretty much in the dark. Until…”
Seated in a circle around Sam’s small kitchen table, Dean waited for Sam to finish pouring them all a shot of whiskey. His brother had barely sat down before Dean was untangling a hand from Cas’s grip to down his drink, biting back a wince at the burn as he impatiently gestured at his brother to pour him another.
Sam stood, absently noticing the coffee Cas had brought but hadn’t had a single sip from was no longer steaming.
“How much longer do you think it’ll take your brother to realize Eileen can’t hear him?” Cas asked, voice pitched low and tone concerned.
His brother had yelled, and though it was meant to be light-hearted, Dean had felt sufficiently guilt-tripped into being more attentive of his little brother.
Dean stared at the bag in his hand. It had been far too long, and he’d really only bought it on a whim. Neither meant he actually had to go through with his plan. Clearly, he’d just been thinking in the heat of the moment, passing by the shop on the street when he was alone, no one around to judge… Swallowing, he looked around himself, as if his surroundings might’ve changed in the past half hour he stood, scrutinizing the nondescript bag in his hands. But nope, still in his room in the bunker, the door was still comfortably closed and locked, and since everyone that needed to sleep had long since gone to bed, Dean was fairly certain that no disrupting moose would demand his presence anytime soon.
“I don’t understand,” the boy said, his voice was rough. “Before I was chosen, they didn’t want me to stare.”
“No! That’s-that’s not.” He answered, voice high and sharp at the beginning but at the end his voice was barely higher than a whisper.
But his words got cut off as now Sam could finally make out Dean’s face and through his tears, Sam saw the redness and fingerprint across his brother’s cheek.
Dean didn’t cast him a glance either, but busy himself within weapons there. “Normal people have normal lives. What do you have, Sammy? Fantasies of normal life.”
He decided he hated that man a long time ago while in return John Winchester indeed hated him. Sam remembered there was one time that John came back home after a hunting trip. He ran towards the man and hoped he could get a hug. But instead, his father ignored him. His father avoided him, walking past by him without glancing a look but saying he smelled like fire and ashes, exactly the same smell of the night when their mother died.
Suddenly, there were footsteps coming his way. Sam quietly fumbled back in his little corner, holding a baseball bat tightly in his hand. He wasn’t big enough to swing it, but surely he could use it as a weapon to block any unwelcome creatures.
He looked so miserable that Castiel paused for a second, narrowing his eyes. Did anyone tell this boy what was going to happen to him?
Sam sighed, irritatingly followed his brother, and when they reached the exit of the building, he stood there, watching Dean open Impala’s trunk distantly. So, it seemed like their old gave Dean what he wanted the most at last-the car. Dean dreamt about that Impala since he was four.
At first the boy’s cry was very quiet, almost sobbing like he already fully accepted his fate, big green eyes filled with tears, hands clenching tightly around the sheets beneath him. But then as Castiel became rougher and rougher, the angling he chose meant more pain, and the boy’s quiet sobbing turned into small begs, then at last Castiel suspected that he couldn’t hold it anymore that that beg turned into wails.
“Dean!” Sam bawled (he wasn’t sure he was capable of doing that before), struggled to get to his feet, running, stumbling towards his brother’s direction. “P-please...I-I am scare, p-please, please don’t leave me here-”
That was not even a question, but the boy nodded anyway. Apparently he was taught to answer any sayings directed to him, and show absolute respect to anyone here, though Castiel doubted that he knew his name or his title.
This time, he didn’t even have to raise his voice so much, and the boy abruptly bit down his lips and opened his eyes.
That Saturday when their father came back home was a Saturday very next to Christmas and Sam had absolutely no idea if he wanted John to stay or just leave Dean and him alone and never bother coming back.
After a few unattended calls, he heard Dean curse some unholy words in their backyard. He could almost imagine his brother’s green eyes grew mad and was so ready to kick his ass once he discovered where Sam hid. Neither of them loved to face their father alone because being a father, John Winchester just sucked.
Castiel already knew that the Covenant wouldn’t be too thrilled about this. The Winchesters, they had already caused a lot of troubles these recent years and if they were expecting the Covenant would just brush them off like nothing serious happened, they had to do better than that. For example, sacrificing some truly boy virgins or girl virgins instead of sending an almost adult young man to begin with.
Normally, Sam was not a big fan of those routines, like hugging their father and telling him how terribly they missed him after he was gone. He would go upstairs of their two-storage garage and sat in front of the window, watching that big black Impala pulling into their driveway, and when Dean’s slightly irritated voice called him to get his ass down, Sam would just ignore his brother completely.
To Cas’s credit, he didn’t flinch, or outwardly react in any negative way otherwise. What he did do was pause, and tilt his head, squinting as he regarded Dean’s face. “Your lines are uneven,” he finally announced.
“So, if you don’t mind keeping my brother company? I’m you could show him all around the island and keep him entertained enough to not barge in on yours truly’s lovefest. What do you say, help a poor, hopeless romantic out, who also happens to be an unbelievably considerate brother?” He tried, crossing his fingers behind his back.
The smile he offered Cas next was a little more genuine, if sympathetic. “I’ve had almost four decades of experience with his particular brand of ‘Ass-fection.’ He’s also a
“Yes,” Cas breathed out, placing the bottle of eyeliner on the sink behind Dean. “Your soul is divine, Dean, yet however your body is built is a work of art on its own. But how
“Stay still, please,” it was an order, Cas commanding as gently as a battle hardened warrior could do, before he began applying the eyeliner, and Dean only just reminded himself to freeze – who was he kidding, there was no conscious thought to freezing, his body taking over and closing his eyes but also emanating
When Cas bottomed out, they both let out a synchronized groan as his balls slapped at Dean’s ass. He stayed unmoving, clearly waiting for Dean to adjust, but he didn’t care about that. He wanted to feel it – if he was forced to ‘quarantine’ himself at home, then he wanted it to be a memorable experience. So instead of saying anything, however, he pushed back, teasing Cas with a grinding movement of his hips. Cas bit his shoulder harshly in retaliation, and Dean would never admit to letting out an unmanly squeak at that. But it worked, Cas pulling out, and then slamming back in, setting a furious rhythm. Dean let himself go boneless, knowing his boyfriend wouldn’t let him fall, even despite the floor that had them both shifting to ensure they wouldn’t fall.
clearly not getting it. “I mean you, Cas.” Sam said bluntly, childishly enjoying watching Cas flush and lean back.
“You like it.” Cas hummed noncommittally. A hand disappeared from his hip, and he could hear Cas fumbling around. The sound of a bottle’s cap popped open, and then slicked fingers were probing at Dean’s furled hole.
“I could help you with that?” Cas offered. “As an angel, my hands don’t shake unnecessarily…” he trailed off, as if it only just occurred to him that straight lines weren’t exactly straight when they were on someone’s eyelids, but apart from raising his eyebrows, Dean mentally shrugged, and held the bottle of eyeliner to Cas.
– was definitely getting to his head because his brain was glitching, and Dean was at a complete loss for words, only able to cowardly pull the blankets up to his chin.
“Yes,” Dean let out a drawn out whine as Cas slowly but surely pushed into him. His hands were back onto his hips, holding on as he thrust in. There were bound to be bruises later, and Dean relished in the thought of it.
Sam choked out a laugh. “Didn’t work when you were a ghost with corporeal limbs, ain’t gonna work now either.”
we’re talking about. Specifically, him dealing with a risk to the one person aside from me that he gets totally bent outta shape about.”
“Don’t call me that,” Sam said. “And for ‘not murdering’ the druglord responsible for all those teens that kept overdosing lately.”
Dean, who had a shovel still over his shoulder, other hand on the Impala trunk, tiredly pausing and replying without even looking at Sam. “Keep your panties on, Samantha.” He sighed, shoulders slumping further. “Tough hunt, is all.” Tossing the shovel into the trunk, he slammed it close, wearily making his way to Baby’s backseat. Sam tossed a worried look at Castiel, who only mirrored it before getting in with Dean.
Cas’ mouth worked wordlessly for a few seconds before he finally got his voice to work again. “Setting aside the impossibility of that statement for now, that’s still six years of your life wasted,” Cas retorted. "And as grateful as I am to have been able to see you, that doesn't negate the causes behind the situation when I should've been able to see you as much as anyone else – alive and breathing. Like you are now."
“Uh,” Dean didn’t know where to look, those eyes, that was already concentrating, those plush lips, parted slightly and exhaling tiny puffs of air against Dean (he was an angel, did he really even need to breathe?), or those hands, raising to bring the eyeliner to Dean’s face?
“Two days,” Sam said. And yeah, that sounded about right, matching with the bags under their eyes and the general weariness they seemed to radiate. Dean got to sleep even though he’d been dead and then revived, but when was the last time these actual, alive human beings got some sleep?
Sam sighed, closing his book to give Cas his full attention. For reasons he knew but wasn’t gonna address aloud, Cas was being far more bothered about this whole thing, and Sam would’ve had to have been soulless to not throw the poor guy a bone. “Look, Cas. Atlas has
Sam made a noise of disgust. “Okay, first off, don’t ever say ‘booty call’ again. Second off, please tell me he wasn’t behind the body that just showed up on Fourth Avenue.”
His mind brought up the abandoned stream of thought, as if it had never broken into disruption in the first place.
“I heard noises,” Cas’s voice was still low, unsure but a comforting rumble that vibrated through Dean’s chest as he went on. “I thought everyone was asleep but… I just wanted to check, is everything alright?”
“Yes, I am aware of his passion for both duty and pumpkin spice.” Cas stated dryly. Sam let slip his smirk a little at that.
“Uhuh,” sure he did. “Point is, in his infuriatingly backwards way, Dean’s probably being a dick because he cares. He’d rather suffer a bit if it means you’ll be better off.” He explained.
“Gladly.” Cas descended into a flurry of movements as he rapidly stripped them, almost leaving Dean dizzy with how fast he moved. All too soon, he found himself naked and trying to find balance on the slippery floor. Before he could, he was being whirled around, Cas’s grip on his hips tight and possessive as he made Dean face the wall. Easily getting with the program, Dean placed his hands on the tiled wall, unconsciously pushing his ass out. He heard Cas let out an almost pained groan, and he grinned, right before a bare hand came down on his ass cheek,
“I have my own private island.” Cas said, so matter-of-factly, as if he hadn’t just dropped a life-changing revelation on Dean. “I can have it thoroughly sanitized by the time we arrive, if it’ll help appease your concerns.”
“Nah. I’m kinda betting on Eileen to make the first move here.” They both looked at Eileen. She’d been blissfully ignorant of Sam doing… whatever awkward mating ritual dance it was Sam was doing in the water so far. But now, his brother was dejectedly coming out of the water, and the girl’s eyes were pinned on his brother’s undeniably well toned body. If anyone needed any informing on blatantly obvious subjects, it was Eileen – the poor girl had been at the blender for several minutes already, and Dean didn’t need supervision to see that the drink was very well blended.
By now, his eyes were open, and with some constant blinking, kept the water away from his eyes enough to see Cas clearly enough when he looked affronted. “I managed just fine before I met you.” He reminded stiffly.
Cas hooked his chin over Dean’s shoulder, warm water dripping down his wet hair. A sudden surge of affection welled within Dean, at the close contact, at Cas despite his irritating tendency to tease, and he let his head fall to the side in an attempt to kiss his boyfriend’s head, only to mouth uselessly at Cas’s cheek when Cas relentlessly rubbed at Dean’s prostate.
Sam shot him a bitchface. “That's... not a word. And,” he paused, looking hesitant. “I don’t… actually know? You disappeared from the hospital, and Cas and I–”
When Cas hit his prostate, Dean felt like a bolt of lightning went through him. He dared to pull a hand away from the wall, grabbing onto Cas’s head, guiding him back down to his neck. Taking the hint for what it was, Cas laved Dean’s skin with attention, sucking and nibbling. Dean impatiently mewled, and Cas let out a dark chuckle before he actually bit down.
With a shout that had him stiffening like a board, clambering for proper grip in the slippery shower stall, Dean came untouched, his come spurting against the tiles in front of him. As his muscles clenched around Cas’s cock, Cas let out a primal yell, and shoved him against the wall, making his come smear against his belly and softening cock, and came inside Dean, spilling hot come in him.
“Jeez, Cas, I’m not a baby bird,” he said, uncomfortable and marginally annoyed as Cas continued to make himself at home, but then he did, and, oh, that… actually felt good. Without being aware of it, Dean went slack as Cas’s wing settled comfortably around Dean, wrapping him up in a warm cocoon. “...Oh, damn that’s warm…” His eyes closed, a peaceful feeling in his chest curling the corners of his lips up without him noticing. He felt Cas gently brush away his hair from his forehead.
know is that one moment I’m talking with another ghost, the next second, that ghost was in me? And then I think I blacked out… had a recap of my entire life’s events, car crash included, and then I’m waking up in your room. Which I would like an explanation for, by the way.” Dean stretched out his arms, staring at them with the awe he’d been mostly suppressing until now. “I mean, dude. I have my body back! Is my grave empty now, or have I been rehymenated?”
“Then it’s a date, angel,” Dean answered, his heart jumping at the deeper meaning to Castiel’s promise. “I think we are going to get a lot more use out of this tie.”
The x rays of Lisa’s shoulder clearly showed a fractured clavicle. The ER doctor explained that it would heal on its own; there was no need for surgery. But it would still take months to heal. One thing was sure. Lisa couldn’t compete.
Dean’s life didn’t leave a lot of time for reading, but Dean knew he could get lost in here for days if he ever had the time.
“We still need lube. I’m happy to open you up with my tongue if you want,” he whispered low and rough. “But if you want my cock inside you, we need to find lube.”
“Charlie, believe me, I’ve already gone over this in my head a hundred times in the last twenty-four hours. I know it was stupid. The guy is already helping me for no reason other than he’s just a good human being who took pity on me. I know we were supposed to keep it professional. That’s what we agreed on the last time; dance partners and nothing else. And I went and screwed it all up by getting drunk and taking advantage of the situation. Sex always complicates things, and now I’m sure he’s regretting signing up for this whole thing to begin with.”
“Right here?” Dean pushed at the muscle with his thumb, causing Castiel to moan and drop his head to one side.
“Ah, no, not yet. She was more concerned about getting over here, and since it’s already dark, we figured it could spend the night in the Chronicle parking lot. I’ll drop her off in the morning and we’ll get it towed somewhere. I definitely don’t need to be fiddling around trying to fix that thing,” Cas said with a quiet laugh.
“Are you really not going to tell me the big reason why you need the money? Because I’m pretty sure I won’t sleep tonight not knowing. I’ll just lay there coming up with one ridiculous theory after another. You don’t really want to torture me like that do you?”
“What? I’m sure you have your secrets. I have mine,” she said casually, looking to the side where the bookmarks were hanging on a little display.
Half an hour later, Castiel stood near the exit, waiting for Anna to finish up her conversation with Pamela. Most of the crowd left soon after Dean’s solo and Pamela’s closing comments of thanks and a reminder to check in with Charlie on the upcoming class schedule. Charlie herself was at the front desk, signing up a few people. Castiel had to admit, the showcase night was good for bringing in new students. There was a tiny space in the back of his mind that wondered if one of those new students should be him. It had been a long time since he started a new hobby of his own choosing. Studying aikido with his brothers had been his father's insistence since they were children and Castiel had long ago grown bored of it.
“Ugh, I love that part! The pining, the angst, the teenage drama! So good!” Charlie paused to put her hands on Castiel’s shoulders. “Dude. Did we just become best friends?”
Castiel hesitated for a moment, but grabbed Dean’s hand to seal their promise. “Deal,” Cas said nodding with a tight smile.
Despite his exhaustion, memories of that night flooded his mind before he could push them away, making his cock twitch in interest. He relaxed his head back to rinse the shampoo from his hair, enjoying the sensation of suds running over his heated skin. He took himself in hand, already half hard and filling up fast, and gave his cock a few strokes. It wasn’t the first time he’d gotten off thinking about Cas’ hands working him open, his tongue teasing his nipples, and his eyes blown open in desire as he sunk into Dean with a gentle confidence and slowly increased his intensity until Dean forgot his own name. Dean always had a few rotating fantasies he thought about when jerking off, but the rest of them had faded into the background since that night.
“In my defense, I didn’t know they would be here for this. And well-meaning manipulation aside, I still think it’s worth giving it a shot. I mean, what do you have to lose? If we don’t try, then you have to wait another year. With me as your partner, at least we have a chance, however small.”
Dean closed his eyes and brought up a hand to rub at his temple in frustration. Not looking up, Dean opened his mouth.
The days quickly turned into weeks. From the very beginning, day after day, Cas showed up. He put in the work. Obviously he was always strong, thanks to his years of martial arts training. But in their rehearsals, he gained a new kind of strength. A new confidence. There was a brightness in his eyes that had been dulled when Dean first met him. Now they seemed to sparkle each time he walked into the studio.
“That’s okay. I know what it’s like to have parents who don’t support you,” Cas said with a sad smile, slowly sliding his hand off Dean's and returning it to his own side of the table.
“That sounds fair,” Castiel said as he backed away toward the curtain. “Just remember though,” he said with a teasing smile. “I have the book discount.”
The drive back to the motel is quiet, except for the sound of Led Zeppelin playing softly on Baby’s radio. When Dean looks over, Cas’ eyes are serene, looking out at the road ahead. Dean slowly moves his hand over to cover Castiel’s where it is resting on the seat between them. Cas looks quickly over to Dean and gives him a shy smile, as if caught off guard while having indecent thoughts about future possible endeavors. Dean bites his lower lip and smiles back, knowing his angel so well at this point he can almost read his mind. “We will do that again Cas. I promise. And hopefully more,” Dean offers.
“This is a serious competition Cas. This isn’t Cirque Du Soleil or Bozangas’s Gentlemen’s Lounge. I’m not wearing anything with sequins or glitter,” Dean barked.
When Dean smiled at him, a wave of affection spread through Cas’ veins. “No, Cas, I’m pretty fucking fantastic. But I need you to move Angel.” To prove his point, Dean spread his legs even further apart and cupped Cas’ ass with both hands to pull him in even deeper. “I need you to
Sam looked up from his laptop as Dean entered the kitchen. “Hey man, what are you up to,” Sam asked.
Dean pressed his lips together in a quick tight smile, looking down again. “Trust me, it’s really not anything impressive.”
“Great! We’ll get back to that. But tonight I wanted to go over what to expect for the actual competition and show you some pole basics and a few exercises to start strengthening your core. Why don’t we pop a squat for the first bit?”
Luckily, Cas had been too eager to get Dean’s clothes off in the back seat, so he didn’t notice anything odd. Dean reached inside his pocket and wrapped a hand around the black velvet ring box. He couldn’t wait to give it to Cas later tonight. He hoped with everything he had, that Castiel said yes. Because he couldn’t wait to have the time of his life, for the rest of his life.
“Luckily for you, and for me too I guess, I just have one more step that I want to test,” Dean teased, finally lightly stroking his own neglected cock. “And then we both get to come.”
“Heh, um. Maybe. We’ll see. It was good to see you Charlie,” he said with a nervous smile, waving as she left the store.
He and Gabriel happily accepted an invitation to the annual Winchester Fourth of July party, held on Bobby’s property on the northwest side of town. Meeting Bobby was like meeting a teddy bear wrapped in grizzly bear packaging and it was easy to see why Sam and Dean looked up to him the way they did. He’d only embarrassed himself once when he moaned obscenely as he bit into one of Dean’s famous cheeseburgers, only to look over and find Dean staring at him, fighting back a laugh.
“Yeah. Sorry to be calling so late. I just wanted to let you know I’ve been thinking about it. Talking about the logistics with Pam and Charlie. And, uh. If you’re really serious, then...I’m in. Let’s do it.”
“In fact, I’ve been thinking about it for a while now too. Getting my mouth on you,” Cas said in a low and ragged voice while his eyes travelled up and down Dean’s body. And with that, Cas brought his mouth down to Dean’s nipple, bit down lightly, before sucking hard.
“Come here. Let me get a closer look at you,” Dean requested with open arms. Cas went without hesitation and stood in front of Dean, watching as Dean reached up to brush his fingers over Cas’ hips and down to his thighs. Holding Cas in place, Dean pulled the navy blue fabric down, just an inch or two on his left side, and leaned forward to place a soft kiss on the exposed skin there. He felt Cas flinch and heard a quiet whimper. Dean looked up through hooded lashes.
“Oh good, you’re here,” Dean said rolling his eyes. “And let me guess. You being here probably means you know everything that happened this weekend.”
Several hours later, Castiel parked his 1978 Lincoln Continental in front of Lazarus Rising pole studio. He gripped the steering wheel and forced himself to take several deep breaths to keep his heart from bursting right out of his chest. He still couldn’t believe he was doing this. But, perhaps that’s why he wanted to present this idea to Dean in the first place. He knew he needed to step out of his familiar bubble. And of course, there was Dean. Castiel barely knew him, but already he could see how strong and good Dean was. He had been through so much and if anyone deserved to have their dreams come true, it was Dean. If Castiel could contribute even a little bit, it would be worth the hard work.
Of course in the back of his mind, Dean knew he was dangerously close to a state he could only describe as contentment. He could feel himself falling farther and farther into a place that might be impossible to climb out of again.
Not five minutes later, there was a knock on his door. Cas stood outside his door holding out a coiled charger with a smile. He must’ve just showered, his hair still damp and smelling like hotel shampoo. He wore faded jeans and a soft looking Rolling Stones shirt.
Still seated in between Dean’s legs, Cas turned his head to one side so that he could look back at Dean. “Thank you Dean. You’ve been really patient with all this. I just don’t want to let you down after all our hard work,” he admitted quietly.
“Oh, well I did as a child. Then when I was about sixteen, I started training in aikido. It’s similar to karate but different techniques in fighting styles,” Castiel answered him. “I haven’t really practiced in about two years though,” Castiel looked down at the floor, hoping no one would make him explain further. He was saved by his sister.
“Um. Yes,” he answered quietly. “I didn’t know what kind you’d be in the mood for so early in the morning, so I brought apple and pecan.”
They were each planning a solo routine, on top of their duo. If they won that, they had agreed to split it evenly. Lisa was a single mom to a kid named Ben. She was planning to add the money to his college savings.
Dean giggled again, softer, but no less beautiful. Castiel had never considered himself to be a funny person.
Castiel’s mind swirled with this new information. Dean had been through so much in his life. So much had been taken from him. No wonder he was so afraid of getting his hopes up and letting himself be happy. He was always waiting for the next shoe to drop and the inevitable disappointment that followed. It made Cas’ chest hurt. Dean deserved every good thing life had to offer.
He wasn’t sure who moved first. He frankly couldn’t care when a minute later Cas’ tongue was teasing his own. Cas cupped his jaw and gently urged him until he was on his back and Cas was pressing him into the mattress. Dean spread his legs to let Cas settle against his body, fitting together so naturally like they’d done this a thousand times already. Dean ran his hands over Cas’ strong back down to grip his ass and pull in him closer, resulting in a delicious grind. Dean happily swallowed the noises coming from Cas, only breaking their kiss to come up for air.
“Be that as it may, I have to agree with Rowena McLeod. I’ve seen you boys rehearse for months. But Sunday, something was definitely different. I don’t know what happened between you two, but you need to fix it so we can get to work. We have eight weeks until nationals in San Diego. We have to develop a whole new routine. So, boys. We’ve got work to do.”
Half an hour later, Dean and Castiel sat side by side on the king size bed. Dr. Sexy was in the middle of a life saving emergency brain surgery, and Cas was rolling his eyes and yelling about how completely ridiculous the whole scene was because Dr. Sexy wasn’t even a brain surgeon. Dean couldn’t help but laugh at him in between bites of his warm apple pie.
So, each night they explored each other a little more. Of course, Castiel already knew Dean’s body and soul like a well worn map, but that didn’t stop him from looking again. And again. And again.
One lazy morning in the bunker found Dean and Cas alone in the kitchen. Between them sat a fresh pot of coffee and a boxed cherry pie from the supermarket. Dean was already scanning Sam’s laptop for new possible cases.
“Heya, Cas.” Dean swivels around in his seat to face Castiel. Cas is standing in the middle of the empty room, commanding the space. His eyes are warm and intense as he gazes back at Dean. The room is silent, the tension building as Dean breaks eye contact to look down at the floor, like a little boy who just got caught doing something bad. “How much of that did you hear?”, Dean asks cautiously. Cas’ face softens as his lips form a lop-sided smile. “Enough,” he answers. “I heard you say my name. It sounded like you might be praying to me, so I continued to listen. I didn’t mean to eavesdrop on your conversation, Dean. I’m sorry.”
After a few seconds of silence and a side-eye directed towards her brother, Anna admitted, “No... but my point still stands. It will be fun, I promise. Pole studios are a really popular fitness alternative to gyms nowadays and my supervisor loved my idea about doing a feature for the Chronicle,” she concluded as the car came to a stop at a red light. She looked over at Castiel with that same pleading look she had perfected years ago when they were children, knowing it worked on Cas every time she wanted something.
Dean noticed Cas’s face drop just a bit. His now tight smile no longer reached his eyes. Castiel wrapped his hands around the empty coffee mug. “I’m sorry I assumed,” he said, bowing his head a little. “You two seemed to have great chemistry during your routine, so I just figured that came from somewhere, ya know?” Castiel continued staring at the bottom of his coffee cup while the conversation lulled. Dean took a sip as he looked to his right, inwardly cringing a little at the awkward silence and trying to come up with anything he could use as an excuse to stay here with Cas. After a minute, Castiel’s mouth pulled up in a smirk.
“On the way back to Dad’s hotel, we got t-boned by a drunk driver, on the passenger side of the car. Somehow, I was fine, just some cuts and bruises. Dean was pinned. He was unconscious, but he was breathing. Dad didn’t make it. They said he died instantly.”
“Uh, yes. Aikido, specifically. Growing up, our father insisted we know how to defend ourselves properly if the need ever arose. It hasn’t, but that’s beside the point,” he said, rolling his eyes. “My brothers practice karate, but I found aikido to be more enjoyable in study. It teaches one how to take down an attacker without mortally injuring them. I don’t believe in using any more violence than is necessary, unlike my brothers. I’m still fairly proficient, although I stopped practicing about two years ago. Now I mostly just run in the mornings before work.”
“Hmm? Wha-no! No, we aren’t like together together,” Dean interjected, feeling his face flush for more than one reason. “I mean she’s an awesome girl and Ben is really cool for a twelve-year-old. But we’re just friends. She tried to make it something more at first, but there’s no way I could be in a relationship with anyone right now. That’d just be a disaster waiting to happen.”
“I...just...wasn’t expecting to see all of...that,” he whispered, waving his hands in Dean’s general direction.
He helped Cas get his legs out from under him and massaged his calves for a moment while Cas squirmed and gently humped the mattress when the toy hit at a different angle in his new position.
Dean looked into those blue eyes, knowing that whatever the judges thought of their performance, he was still leaving here with the best prize of all.
Castiel was actually briefly grateful when Dean interrupted and rambled on. “I met your sister over there talking to Pam. She said she’s writing an article for the studio. That’s pretty awesome, Pam deserves to show this place off a little.” Dean paused for a moment, never breaking eye contact, but looking a bit lost at the same time, as if he was trying to get his thoughts in order. “I’m Dean,’ he said a bit softer after taking a breath, his smile dropping a bit but not completely.
“I thought I heard the door open,” she said to herself, walking over behind the desk. “Welcome to Showcase Night, guys! Are you friends or family of one of our performers tonight?,” she asked, looking between them expectantly.
Cas kept his eyes on Dean while he backed up until the mattress hit the back of his knees. He lowered himself gracefully onto Dean’s bed, resting his head on the pillow. Dean retrieved the cuffs from where he left them on the night stand and stood over Cas, taking a moment to admire the view.  His fingers were itching to touch, but Dean knew if he did, there would be no stopping and this whole thing would be over far too quickly. He wanted to make this good. Take his time. Play.
“Thanks. I will,” Castiel answered, giving a shy wave goodbye before getting in his car and starting up the engine.
Leave it to a bar tender offering free drinks to get Dean to start talking about his real feelings for Castiel. Dean should have realized, however, that Cas is listening.
“Yes, Dean. I understand,” Cas replied after a deep breath. “Good boy,” Dean answered, turning the toy off again. He reached for the lube on the bed and let it drip over the toy. Holding the plug with one hand, he spread Cas apart with the other and lightly brushed the vibrator over Cas’ spit slicked rim.
“Um,” he stuttered. “I-I’m not sure. I do own a bookstore on south Lamar. Angel’s Books? I don’t really go anywhere else, so that kind of has to be it,” he offered with a quiet self-deprecating laugh.
“Yeah. Night Cas,” Dean replied with a soft smile before climbing into the driver’s seat of the Impala.
Dean could only hold on as Cas set a quick but hypnotizing rhythm. Their position meant Cas’ cock hit Dean’s prostate perfectly with each thrust.
When he finally gave in this afternoon and told Gabriel what he was planning, they had gone over all the pros and cons of taking on something like this. And bless Gabriel; he only teased him for a few minutes before realizing how serious he was. One of Gabriel’s concerns (and another reason he’s a good big brother) was Castiel’s crush on Dean. Gabriel had never even met Dean so Castiel had to admit that maybe he wasn’t as subtle as he thought he was. He couldn’t deny it. And he knew going into this that there was a chance that nothing would ever come of it. If Dean wasn’t interested in him as any other kind of partner, he would have to live with that. That all being said, desire sure was one hell of a motivator.
Thank God airplanes come equipped with tiny bottles of alcohol. That’s the main reason Dean got through the three hour flight from Austin to San Diego. Cas only teased him a little before offering to share an ear bud and tilting his laptop towards him. Dean spent the rest of the flight leaning in close to Cas and watching three classic episodes of Dr. Sexy MD that Cas had already downloaded for the trip. Before he knew it, they were touching down in southern California.
“You look so good like that, Angel. So perfect.” As Dean stood to admire his angel, a quick wave of emotion rushed over him. His pride swelled, knowing that this magnificent creature of Heaven had given him this kind of power and trust.
To anyone else, Castiel would have appeared no different than on any other day.. But no one else was as nosey and attuned to Castiel's moods as Gabriel.
“Um, I mean I didn’t really think it was appropriate to ask for details. I just know that he was in a coma for a few weeks after.”
“Well, young Padawan, there’s the scary part. You have to talk to him. It sounds like you’ve been giving him some pretty mixed signals. I think an apology is a good place to start.”
Castiel suspected Dean’s pouting was all for show since he quickly fell right into the choreography, showing as much excitement for their new plan as Castiel had when he suggested it in the first place.
Dean stares down at his drink, watching the way the light hits the glass. After a moment, his face changes and a sliver of a smile appears on his lips, clearly enjoying some private thought. “Yeah. There actually is a good one,” Dean confides warmly, his smile gradually increasing, causing the skin around his eyes to crinkle.
“Just go with me on this okay. Give me your hand.” Castiel offered Dean his hand, palm up, which Dean took and placed flat against his own chest. Dean silently cursed himself for immediately thinking about how large Cas’ hands were.
Castiel hesitated, refusing to look his brother in the eye. “No, it wasn’t bad,” he mumbled. “Actually it was,...the best sex of my life.”
It turned out that Dean was right. Castiel still couldn’t believe it himself, but they had this. Perhaps luck was on their side because a lot of the other teams made errors that the judges took off points for. But Dean and Castiel nailed every trick in their routine. And hours later, they had the trophy to prove it. Dean’s face had been radiant in pride ever since the winners were announced at the closing ceremony. Dean, Castiel and their little cheering squad gathered outside in the parking lot, ready to split up for the three hour ride back to Austin. Their precious trophy found a spot on Baby’s front seat.
“Well I certainly didn’t expect that when I came in tonight,” Cas said a minute later, pulling Dean out of his spiraling thoughts. He slowly sat up to find Cas walking back toward him. His jeans were back on and his blue button up was halfway done already. Maybe Cas was panicking too and couldn’t wait to get out of here. Dean wouldn’t blame him. He had gone too far, taken advantage of the situation, and now Cas would be too uncomfortable around him. What if he quit? Dean’s chest ached at the thought of Cas walking out of here and never coming back, all because Dean couldn’t keep his hands to himself.
“Yeah, sorry. I’m good, just daydreaming I guess. What’s up,” Castiel asked, glancing back toward the privacy door, only to find the previously occupied space empty.
After rinsing away his mess, he quickly dried off, brushed his teeth, and pulled on clean boxers. Finally pulling down the crisp white linens and tacky duvet, he flopped onto his back, enjoying the coolness of the sheets. The anxious butterflies made a quick flight around his belly, reminding him that tomorrow he would be competing on a national stage. Luckily, his weariness won out as he pulled the sheets up around him. He was asleep in minutes.
“Thanks, Sam.” He still wasn’t used to hearing so many people say that in such a short time frame. When Bobby told him he was proud, Dean had nearly started crying.
Dean lazily worked it out of his hole, revealing a solid plug made of clear glass swirled together with crystal blue. He held it up to better show off the color. “Your grace.”
“Now, I don’t want you coming yet. Not until I’m ready,” he instructed. “So, if you get to that point and you feel like you can’t stop it, I need you to tell me, okay?”
Dean closed his eyes and counted to ten, taking in a deep breath and slowly exhaling through his nose. When he was on eight, he got an idea. It was silly, but it was worth a shot.
As he made his way back to the bed, Cas tugged his jeans and underwear off his hips and stepped out of them.
Castiel made a hasty retreat for the little office hidden off in the corner. It wasn’t much. Just big enough for a desk with an old computer, a few shelves, and coat hooks. Calling it an office was a generous term as it wasn’t much more than a moderately sized closet. But it gave Castiel some semblance of privacy when he needed it.
“Good. You should stop being so nice to me Cas. You’re gonna make me like you too much. It’d be easy to fall for a guy like you,” Dean whispered.
“I’m gonna head down and find some food. I’ll see you in a bit and we can head over to the convention center and get checked in.”
“Okay, here it is,” Dean started, shaking his head and looking down at the dark wood floors. “Cas, I’m sorry about this weekend. I acted like a dick, and you didn’t deserve that.”
“Sweet! Just fair warning, Dean is my other BFF, so you guys will have to share,” Charlie said with a smirk.
“Cas! Tell me you’re close, baby. I want us to come together, so you gotta tell me,” Dean said in between breaths.
What felt like a lifetime passed in the few seconds while Dean was pulled in closer to Castiel by some invisible force. Dean’s heart pounded in his chest when their lips brushed together, barely touching. Castiel’s lips felt like a live wire that sent a course of electricity through Dean’s veins that he could feel in the tips of his fingers. He studied Cas’ face for any signs that he had misread the signals and crossed a line. Finding only want in those big blue eyes, Dean leaned forward again to seal their mouths together in a soft but heated kiss. Kiss after kiss after kiss, they sat, Cas leaning back against Dean’s chest. Cas brought a hand up, reaching behind him to card his fingers though Dean’s hair. When Cas’ tongue brushed against his mouth, Dean let out a breathy moan, quickly parting his lips to let Cas in. He let his hands wander over Cas’ ribs and around to his belly. When he lightly traced over a nipple with his finger nail, Castiel shivered in his arms and arched his back, bringing his ass in direct contact with Dean’s groin. They pulled apart, panting against each other. Dean looked down, over Castiel’s shoulder, to see Cas’ cock tenting obscenely in his tiny black shorts. Surely, Cas could feel that Dean was under the same effect from where he sat, Dean’s entire length trapped between his belly and Cas’ back, throbbing.
