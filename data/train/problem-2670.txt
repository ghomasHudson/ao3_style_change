There's about a minute of silence, broken only by the occasional bang of John depositing the shopping in any non-contaminated, available cupboards he can find.
"You didn't
"Sorrysorrysorry, please continue."
John scowled at Sherlock. "That's not true at all, you arse."
Sherlock nodded mutely, a random shiver coursing through his innards as John's eyes met his.
"Working."
"You know what to do?" Sherlock said quietly.
Sherlock pushed back again with a long groan, shuddering as John filled him.
"If you wanna long-term it, I mean, that's the way to do it. Smart," Topher said.
Sherlock grunts in reply, still absorbed in the text he’s composing on his phone.
"Sherlock-"
"No. You’re a spoiled, arrogant prick, and I’m tired of your shit. I’m leaving and you’re
He was trying for 'commanding' but it came out as needy. Scared. It made John want to destroy him, want to shatter him apart with pleasure. Keep rubbing and rubbing until Sherlock came with his cock untouched, writhing and fucking himself on John's fingers.
"More than five but no more than ten."
After about a minute he has convinced himself it was just the old building settling in the night, or that he was hearing things. His mind is too relaxed and pleasantly sleepy to think about going to investigate. Soon after that he drifts into a comfortable, dreamless, satisfied sleep.
John fixed Mara with a hard stare.
John let out a long breath, just standing and watching. "You look like a cross between Michelangelo's David and a wet dream."
A short period of quiet and stillness follows, the only sound their breathing, the only movement John’s lazy fingers trailing slowly up and down Sherlock’s chest.
John shook his head, grinning. "Why the hell didn't we do this sooner?"
John curled his fingers again and rubbed his fingertips in small circles inside Sherlock, finding his sweet spot with unerring doctorly accuracy.
Sherlock lay in stunned silence for a moment, then tentatively called, "John?"
"You like being observed, don't you?"
John frowns deeply. "You think that’s what I want?"
sick of it," John grits out, wrenching his arm away. "I’m done with this."
John’s mouth stalls for a few moments while his brain flashes him some (quite graphic) images of Sherlock fucking himself with his long fingers, or with his intimidating black dildo.
," Sherlock makes a frustrated, expansive gesture which John supposes is meant to encompass the whole awkward current situation.
They get into a cab as true partners for the first time, thighs touching on the back seat, and drive off into the London night.
"I said, you
He groans softly and pushes his hips up, grinding his hardening dick up against Sherlock's abdominal muscles. John hears his breath catch; it's clear that Sherlock wants this as badly as he does. John parts his knees and Sherlock takes the hint, slides up his body, resting between his thighs.
"Pleasantly, I ho—
Sherlock finally looks up, meeting John’s eyes. He stands and moves over to the table, settling into the chair opposite John. His voice is a low rumble when he speaks again.
"Didn't work? Specify," Mycroft said.
. Your shirt is creased, one extra button undone, and you have beard rash on your neck."
He wants Sherlock in every way imaginable, and he's sure Sherlock could come up with a few ways beyond that.
"Fuck me, John. I want you inside me..." Sherlock groans out, and John can hear his exertion in his voice.
John finally looked at him, his eyes dark and filled with turmoil.
"John-" Sherlock starts.
"More than five? More than ten?"
friend, and
"Tell me where you're going. Please."
"That's... reasonable."
"Well, the virgin thing, which I'm a bit embarrassed about to be honest," John said softly. "I assumed and I guess that manifested somehow."
Sherlock felt a hollow in his gut, thinking of John sleeping in his bed, mourning him, wanting him—making the decision to go into a virtual world for as long as possible to be with him. The thought that this could have been where John died was like a stab to the heart.
"That's better," John murmured against Sherlock's neck. "Molly's bag of feet can wait."
"Oh," John breathed as Sherlock inched inside him. "Ohh
"I want to crawl under the table and suck you off, and what’s more, you want me to."
"I'm okay."
John walks for about ten minutes before making up his mind what he’s going to do. What he’s going to do is walk into the next pub he sees and get nicely, comfortably pissed.
The facsimile was kissing John, deeply, passionately. Sherlock looked away quickly, feeling his face flush, but found his eyes magnetically drawn back to the kiss. When it broke, John and the facsimile murmured some more, Sherlock frustrated by his inability to eavesdrop or lipread due to the angle.
"Easy, easy," John whispered, one steady hand on the small of Sherlock's back.
"Good night, Gabe."
me. Wanting to consume you and be consumed. I wanted it before I fell, but in a gentle, slow-burning, searching way. Once I was away it was so much
, John thinks,
"Sherlock..." John said, exasperated. "I don't do that."
"Are you going to take me home, then?" Sherlock said, smoothing his hands down the front of John's shirt.
"Yes. You’re a distraction."
"Stop what?"
John frowns, looking at Sherlock, and replies in a hushed tone of voice, "Because I like women?"
"Do I need to?"
Once he started, he couldn't stop. The trail of bites led down John's shoulder, down over his chest, John inhaling sharply as Sherlock's teeth rasped a nipple, pausing to suck and lick and tease, then biting and licking over the trail of hair leading down. John's breathing was coming in gasps, his hips writhing under Sherlock, Sherlock's large hands pinning him to the floor.
John pushed his hand under the empty pillow beside him, retrieving Sherlock's phone.
"I swear you leave it behind deliberately," John said, holding it out to Sherlock.
Being around Sherlock throws him off-balance. The protective instinct he’s always had toward the man has evolved into something more, much more, but it’s obvious that John is nothing more to Sherlock than a hired gun without the pay, a sounding board for his deductions, comfort and tea and convenience and... property.
"No, you kinda haven't, actually. But then I guess apologies aren't really your strong suit, are they?"
and not stopping, at the most intimate erogenous zone of his body that he
John’s cock buried inside him to the hilt, Sherlock stills.
"Is that an invitation?" Sherlock asked quietly.
John breathed out heavily, his hips rocking, controlling how and when Sherlock pushed against him. His eyes squeezed closed and he stilled as the head of Sherlock's cock breached him.
"You needn't bother going after her, John. She left because she knows it's true, and you were thinking about finishing with her anyway.
Reverie Sherlock looked at Real World Sherlock, held his gaze for a long moment, then looked away again before speaking.
Angel is suspended.
"I... Oh
John remained in hospital for a further week.
He looks at Sherlock’s bedroom door, thinking for a long moment before pushing it slowly inward. John has never been in Sherlock’s room before and he’s interested to see what it’s like, all of a sudden. At least, he tells himself it's just idle, inexplicable curiosity.
"Obviously," Sherlock muttered, and then smiled as he got the provoked harder thrust. He pushed back, hard, against John and rocked his hips, moving John's cock inside him.
John twists his hand on Sherlock's cock and he cries out, his whole body tightening as he orgasms, his fingertips digging into John's shoulders, his cock shooting streams of white over John's chest and neck. He's so tight around John's cock that he can barely thrust into him, can barely move at all. John quickly follows him over the edge, curling in on himself as he comes deep inside Sherlock's superheated, incredibly tight body, the detective's movements dragging ragged moans from his throat, making him cry out against Sherlock's sweaty, slippery chest.
* * * * *
"I... I can't do that, Gabe. It wouldn't be right," John says, but
This is a completely different beast; desperate, feral, and
"You were dressing to the right as usual when you left the house," Sherlock says, nodding toward John's groin. "You're more to the left now. That doesn't generally happen when you visit the gents', which means an outside influence caused it. He
"And then?"
John flees the room, his heart inexplicably racing as he climbs the stairs.
John pulled back, Sherlock letting out a disappointed little whine.
And thanks again to
"Of course he knows it isn't real," Sherlock snapped. "What kind of simpleton do you take him for?"
John closes his eyes and slides one hand blindly up under his spare pillows on the unused side of his bed. His fingers touch the casing of his fleshlight and he swallows, closing his hand around it. He slowly pulls it out from under the pillows, then turns onto his side, looking at it.
, John," Sherlock breathed, "I'm as surprised as you."
John cuts off Sherlock’s explanation with another long, thorough, unhurried kiss, a smile on his face.
. He stubbornly sits at the table, attempting to stare Sherlock down.
away from
, and anything but gentle. In fact, beast is the right word, exactly the right word, because this desire is purely animal in nature. It’s all about gratification and power and need. He doesn’t want to gently cherish Sherlock the way he did any of the ones who came before. He wants to take out all the sexual frustration he's felt over the last few weeks, on the person who caused it. He wants to fuck Sherlock until he grunts, until he comes, until he shows that he’s human, an animal, just like John, after all. He wants to mark him and be inside him and own him. He's swept away by this incredibly visceral need, stripped of all control. He wants to make Sherlock understand, make him feel it too.
John frowned more deeply, tilting his head a little. John's pupils dilated as he looked at Sherlock, and his cheeks were flushed—desire radiated from him even in his confusion. Sherlock could feel his breath on his face, the heat of it, could almost taste it. So
"What about me."
"Am I making you uncomfortable?"
"It's all looking really good, Dr Watson. You'll continue physiotherapy after discharge, but I think you'll only be here another couple of days at the most."
John's hands tightened on Sherlock's hips and his breathing quickened as he started fucking Sherlock steadily, pulling him back onto his thrusting cock. Sherlock moved his hands to grasp the top of the bedhead, his arm muscles tightening as he pushed back against John, groaning each time he was filled.
' and '
"Hello," Sherlock murmurs and slowly sinks down, taking just the head of John’s cock inside his tight, hot hole.
"No. It's puzzling."
He moved through the kitchen which was spotlessly clean, no microscope on the table, no scientific equipment of any kind on any surface.
"I'm not entirely sure how these things are supposed to work, but yes, I think you need to. I'm given to understand that it's the done thing."
"Sherlock?" John repeats, worrying now, already halfway to the door, his coat in his other hand.
" John hisses, flicking his eyes to the closed door, not really believing what he's saying even as he says it.
, Sherlock thought as he rolled over and flicked on the bedside lamp. He fished in his bedside drawer and pulled out a foiled strip of six condoms and a tube of lubricant. He turned back to look at John, finding a small smile on his friend's lips. He gave John a questioning look.
Sherlock swallows thickly before continuing.
He rolled the broken condom off and opened another packet, rolled a fresh condom onto his cock. He then swore under his breath as the same thing happened again. Sherlock growled in frustration and grabbed the box, looking at the expiry. He closed his eyes and breathed out slowly, trying to lessen his disappointment.
"Uh. Yes. Hmm. Well, then. Yes. I'll be... off, then," John stutters out, jerking a thumb toward the door behind him, eager to escape this awkward conversation. "Bedtime. Big day." He adds a yawn-stretch combination for good measure.
"'Be mine' doesn't work?"
John stands, abandoning his tea and toast, heading for the door.
"God, yes," John breathes. "This is
"That’s a very tempting offer," John murmurs, and it really is.
"Yes," says John, like it's the most obvious question ever asked. "This is
Sherlock smiles a little, not even pausing in his list, "An excellent marksman, undeniably. Cool under pressure. A revelation in bed. Oh,
It really was only a matter of time until it all came out.
"I don't have time to talk about that now," Sherlock says without even looking up.
John frowns, becoming uncomfortable with the early-morning interrogation session.
John turns and glares at Sherlock. This isn't how he'd seen tonight going.
"God, I want you... I want to make you fall apart... I want to make you come..."
"I see Sergeant Peters finally worked up the courage to give you his number."
"Christ," John exhales. "I
John sets his mouth into a determined, thin line, and calls Sherlock’s phone again. Straight to voicemail, again. This time he leaves a message. "Sherlock, it’s John. John Watson, remember me? Your err... flatmate. If you could give me a call at your earliest convenience, I’d appreciate it, so I can stop imagining you dead in a ditch somewhere. Thanks."
"A claim I dispute. That monograph generated quite a buzz in the forensic community."
Sherlock frowned, the memory of the sound of John's anguish at watching him 'die' still painful.
"I wanted this, but I didn’t want...
"I thought as much."
"Okay, that was a bit weird."
, but he wants it. It’s nothing short of terrifying, and he clings to Sherlock, clutching at his pale skin, his fingertips leaving even paler trails in their wake. The idea of Sherlock taking him is enough to have him panting and desperate. The thought of Sherlock inside him, possessing him in a way nobody else ever has, likely in a way nobody else ever will.
"Of course," John says, a little defensively, unconsciously plucking at the front of his shirt, "Why wouldn't I make an effort?"
He turns his head to the side and catches a whiff of the scent of Sherlock's hair. The smell of the man jerks something inside him with a strong sense of longing. He wishes Sherlock was still with him and wonders where he might be. He catches himself thinking this and frowns at himself.
"But you-"
"We can move on to the sex now?" Sherlock said, sitting forward in his seat, his pale, unsettling eyes seeming somehow even more alien when filled with desire.
," Sherlock groaned, unable to hold in the exclamation.
Sherlock went down to the laundry to wash the sheets, frightening the life out of Mrs Hudson who slapped his face and then hugged him tightly, sobbing into his chest. He smiled and closed his eyes, holding her close.
John shudders, thrusting his hips harder. The bed is creaking, the floor boards will be carrying the noise straight downstairs to Sherlock, and John doesn't care if Sherlock hears him. In fact, he
"Mmm?" John breathed, then bit Sherlock's bottom lip.
"Pupil dilation when looking in my direction: an extra ten percent, regardless of lighting conditions. When looking at me in my charcoal grey pinstriped trousers: twenty percent. You know the ones, they're a little too tight over my posterior and thighs, accentuating my gluteals and quadriceps."
"Things can go back the way they were, anything you want," Sherlock says, starting to sound bafflingly close to begging.
Sherlock looked at his hands again, pushing back the cuticle of his thumb with his other thumbnail.
"John?" Sherlock said softly, tensing.
Sherlock's eyes sweep quickly up and down John's body and John shifts uncomfortably under the scrutiny.
"Nope. No problem," John lies. "No problem at all."
"How long have you wanted this?" John breathed roughly, pressing gently against Sherlock's hole. "Tell me."
John had physiotherapy again that day and Sherlock wordlessly followed along. He watched in awe as John worked through what was obviously a great deal of pain and muscle weakness, the look on his face doggedly determined. He was reminded yet again just how remarkable the man he'd chosen to love actually was.
John took a breath, squeezing his eyes closed, then looked at Sherlock again, fixing him with a hard stare.
, I do
John is speechless.
As he leaves the pub alone, John doesn’t see the tall figure cloaked in the darkness of a doorway across the road, watching, his pale face tight and worried.
"You couldn't have called from a payphone?"
He slept on the couch every night after visiting hours ended, unable to face sleeping in the bed where he'd held John in his arms. It was good, if a bit strange, to be home, but he wouldn't truly be home until John was back where he belonged.
John slid up closer to Sherlock's side and breached his hole with one fingertip. He kissed Sherlock's moist cheekbone softly, then breathed in his ear, "This night could never be long enough for all the things I want to do to you, Sherlock."
John dipped his head again, licking Sherlock roughly, once, from tailbone to testicles. Sherlock's whole body arched in response.
John doesn't answer. He angles his head away from Sherlock, evasively, looking out the cab window. Sherlock's mouth forms a surprised 'O'.
"When one person is fond of another person, I understand that it's traditional to demonstrate that fondness in the form of favourable observations about appearance, and a show of interest in that person's life."
"The night is young," murmurs Gabe, "and I want you..."
"Thank you," she said as Lestrade loosened his hold on her forearm.
He can tell by the look on Sherlock's face that he's not even slightly fooled.
"Nope," said Topher.
The last crime scene is Sherlock's favourite of the five, a fact made obvious by his highly-inappropriate glee upon arriving. He actually claps his hands and spins in a circle upon seeing the body. The killer has made a mistake, a glaring one apparently, so glaring that John and Lestrade are at a loss to understand what it is. Of course.
"You’re the one who wanted this!"
"Predictable, boring,
"It’s a start," he murmurs, his mouth moving very slightly closer to John’s.
"For three days, though? Never for three days. Not since the pool."
"I don't know how else to be."
John smiled a little.
"Tell me, Sherlock, and I'll give it to you..."
. I'm giving you carte blanche with my body and all you want to do is touch me?" Sherlock said in a voice that wasn't as bossy as it was trying to be. "Have at me, man!"
"- Shut up now," John says, shaking his head and grinning despite himself. "You never know when to just... stop."
John crouches down on the other side of the body and it's then that he realises why Sherlock took his coat off. The tiny smirk on his (full, kissable) lips tells John all he needs to know. Sherlock saw him (not) looking at his (luscious) arse, in fact, that was his desired reaction.
"What?"
"I had handlers in place," Mycroft said. "A string of 'girlfriends' who John never kept around for long. Then neighbours. Mrs Hudson went abroad to visit her sister for a month, and the handlers took that as their cue to derelict their duty. The last handlers have been reassigned in light of the poor job they've done."
"Narcissist," John muttered, smiling a little, seeing right through him.
"You're an exception. You know that as well," John said seriously.
Sherlock jerked awake the next morning, sprawled on the couch. He blinked as John came into focus, sitting at the desk with a mug of tea and some toast.
"Got your breath back?" Sherlock murmurs.
"I do not."
"So we're back to that again, are we?"
"No," John said, shaking his head quickly, an angry smile on his face. "That's a cop out and you know it. Tell me."
"Obvious."
. Like a wife. Like a boyfriend. John doesn't know what he and Sherlock are to one another, but he knows they aren't even close to that stage yet.
kiss him," he says, a reproachful note to his voice.
Sherlock moved to the darkened living room without another word, sat in his armchair, and watched as John poured two large glasses of whisky. John came into the living room, handed Sherlock one of the glasses and sat down.
"If you can talk this much your mouth isn't.
John fumbled blindly on the covers, his hand searching for the condoms, his eyes firmly fixed on Sherlock's rock-hard erection.
"I can barely... breathe, Sherlock," John manages, gooseflesh spreading all up the left side of his body.
"No," John chokes out. "No problem."
"I don't know what I would have done without Reverie," John said. "Probably ended up in hospital a lot sooner. Or worse."
"Do you want me to go against what I feel and treat you poorly?" Sherlock said.
Sherlock was deep in his mind palace when John returned, soaking wet from the torrential rain London was prone to.
“Sherlock, can you do this for me?”
“Sherlock, do come in! Your man is doing some great work!” Cynthia exclaimed over her shoulder at Sherlock.
But John kept his fingers still. He must accept that he’ll never be allowed this from the stoic detective.
John nodded sagely.
John gasped.
“I’m glad you asked Dr Kelley. I was in Afghanistan as an army medic in the RAMC. One of the soldiers had been blasted in the face and sustained a fracture in the mandible as well as injuries to his face. His airway was swollen. The army provides us with a cricothyroidotomy kit with a scalpel and an NPA tube. While I did not have a forceps or anything fancy, it was better than a ballpoint pen like in the movies,” John joked, sending a wink towards Cynthia and Maria.
John tried to scan the room looking for clues, like Sherlock taught him. He was shite at this, but damn if he didn’t try. Then he spotted the anatomy teacher sitting alone at a booth. He seemed angry. He probably had witnessed the glass shatter situation and concluded that blonde waitress and Sherlock were banging or something. Which was ridiculous, Sherlock was gay. Or at least for this case he was acting like he had a boyfriend. Who knew what Sherlock really was….
He was in pain. Shot. His fellow soldiers. Shot. Sherlock. Shot.
John didn’t need to go more into detail about what that meant, he knew Sherlock understood. It meant, “We have done so much for each other and we will keep on doing so”. It meant, “You’ve witnessed my worst nightmares and yet you’re still here”. It meant, “Sherlock my use of adjectives is sincerely what I think of you”. It meant, “You can deduce which side of the bed I’ll chose before I even see it myself”. It meant, “Our love saved us in ways we didn’t think possible”.
John huffed, which seemed to deflate his whole body. He dragged his feet to the kitchen and turned on the kettle, shuffling through the drawers and cabinets to find edible sustenance. Sherlock took this opportunity to observe as John rattled the boxes behind Sherlock’s finished slug experiment.
Sherlock was curled into a ball on the room’s only armchair, watching the television with tired eyes.
“It’s just a scratch Sherlock,” John tried to reassure.
“Good morning, class. Welcome to your lesson on airway emergencies. We will as you probably already know if you’ve studied your course booklets, be speaking not only of tracheal intubation and tracheotomy, but also of cricothyrotomy. Or what is also called coniotomy, or emergency airway puncture.”
Sherlock blushed and pushed his luck. "Even the bit about being detained captive?"
His knees had started shaking.
The air needed to be cleared, despite the fact his heart ached for Sherlock. He did not know when Sherlock would be this open with his emotions again and had to grasp at this rare opportunity. The fact that they were supposed to leave Cambridge this evening made clear the urgency of resolving this now.
John was taken aback by this suggestion. It hurt that he’d send John home and continue investigating on his own. John would not allow Sherlock to continue on his own with a murderer, it was too dangerous!
Sherlock was looking here and there, from the window to John and back, drumming his fingers on the window ledge. The silence was not as comfortable as John knew it could be. John could sense Sherlock’s anxiety. Was this because of the change in their relationship? Was this going too fast for Sherlock?
That night John had a nightmare. It was a nightmare he was familiar with, but the nightmare was just as terrifying every time as if it was his first. It always started in Afghanistan and always ended in sudden noise and blood and suffering.
John was extremely irritated. And one of the reasons why he was irritated, irritated him even more, if that was possible.
John cleared his throat, shifting from one foot to the other.
“Oh lovely! Just what I needed so soon before getting married to my fiancée!”
Sherlock rabbled his deductions to Scotland Yard officers, prompting Sandra to confess.
John was not happy to see the suit presented to them by the hotel staff.
in capital letters?” Cynthia smiled at John as if to stop herself from bursting out laughing. Others in the room had a similar reaction.
John did not understand. He knew Sherlock did not care for sentiment, but were they not friends? Sherlock suddenly looked angry, which confused John even more.
“Okay.”
He felt his jaw tighten.
“Then you can write it off in a clarification on your blog. It doesn’t mean anything and won’t affect our professional image,” Sherlock replied cooly, “Besides, I think the reverse can be true. The amount of readers, and therefore clients, might surge!”
Damn it, sentiment!
All that rage inside! It wasn’t healthy. It wasn’t sane. He didn’t know who was worse, John or Culverton. And he was a father! Rosie deserved more than this. Sherlock deserved more than this. He was letting everybody down.
John jumped out of his chair at the kitchen table and pointed his fork accusingly at Sherlock. He had that dangerous little smile playing at his lips, and Sherlock knew he was in trouble.
“Yes?” John asked when Sherlock stopped speaking.
Sherlock then instead of speaking, turned around, sat on the edge of the bed and started unbuttoning his shirt.
“Well if you must know Mycroft was originally planning to attend with Gavin Lestrade,” Sherlock said with a huff, rolling his eyes.
Sherlock had his mouth open in shock. This was the face John had privately nicknamed the “drama queen face” because it was precisely that. He turned on the overhead light. Sherlock took a few moments before composing himself and directing a piercing eye stare, mentally cataloguing John’s countenance.
John couldn’t stand the awkwardness. Sherlock was already dressed and ready when John had woken up. He had said he was going to look for more evidence he could use from the crime scene while John was at a seminary on cricothyrotomy.
“I couldn’t – couldn’t… I had to be quiet… So quiet, John… Not a word… It hurt – so much… But they couldn’t touch you, I would never – never let them…” Sherlock said desperately labouring through his words.
“Well then Sherlock! If I am so wrong, I’ll let the universally acclaimed genius do the deducing! Deduce me Sherlock!” John demanded.
“Hiya, I recognize you from the introductory class last week. How are you doing?”
"Christ."
“This is the only logical way forward! The murder of the famous scientist Ferdinand von Brugel so close after his nomination for the Nobel prize can only have been done by someone close to him. He had no living family, spending most of the time in his lab. He had no family and preferred to work alone so our suspect must therefore be someone else, someone attending the Nobel prize banquet! Going there together as a couple is our only chance to investigate the murder!”
“Mary has already agreed,” Sherlock tried.
"Amazing. Truly amazing, " He gave a little chuckle and gazed at Sherlock fondly, "God you're right of course."
“Ah but I’m a ‘lazy-bum’ as you call it, it is a chronic condition I am told,” Sherlock quipped.
John rolled his eyes and turned around, his face turning up towards the ceiling, clenching his fists. Took a deep breath.
"Oh but Mary is interesting John, unlike your previous women. And besides, don't take it personally, I doubt I'd enjoy any kind of wedding celebration"
“Yes, you seem off and Sherlock is trying his best to cheer you up. He really is enthusiastic about everything since your case went so well and you seem…well, kind of out of it. Is something wrong?”
So for this final chapter they get to be soft. Some sadness slipped in but they are ok in the end.
Maria graciously saved the situation by informing the table she was going to the loo, to which John jumped on the occasion to follow her there. Once they were at the entrance of the gendered bathroom doors, Maria turned around facing John.
Sherlock was never a monster. He wanted to fix this, he wanted to be good to Sherlock. He did not want to see Sherlock flinch at him again.
“Doctor Watson! I didn’t know you were the
John was as surprised and he was irritated. With his eyes squeezed shut he growled, “What about her?”
John and Sherlock arrive in the poshest hotel in Stockholm and discuss the case. Both worry about their public image.
“Has this body been autopsied? That does not follow regulations on full-body donation. How come?” John asked, keeping to a professional tone.
“Ow! Jesus…Oh right, yeah.” John got the hint and slipped his hand into Sherlock’s.
Sherlock broke into a devious grin.
So he had agreed to what they had said without thinking of the consequences. Great, one more opportunity to fuck this all up.
Sherlock huffed, but saw no way out. He really had to go piss.
John had gained several pounds, but this did not serve to make him look healthy, on the contrary he looked tired and weak. John had large bags under his eyes and had not slept in a while despite his comfortable bed and fiancée. Sherlock hoped it was not nightmares again.
John was pained that he was the reason Sherlock looked like this. Sherlock must be trying so hard. He was strangely reminded of his vow to Mary. The problems of her future were his privilege. Sherlock had made a similar vow to Mary, but also to John. He knew he wanted to blame Sherlock for the Fall, for deliberately putting himself in danger with drugs or at the hands of villains.
George the teacher entered the old anatomy theater and indicated they all sit on the benches around the autopsy table.
John was starving for their usual banter, so he replied “I saw you using the same spatula and pan to fry some human fingers yesterday, your hygiene protocol is atrocious.”
This -- the cases, the thrill, their shared humor, the chase, the takeaway after -- was what they lived for. John would miss it once he was married. John felt a queasy swoop in his stomach. He did not want to lose this.
Sherlock went on:
“Good day Doctor Watson. And do send my regards to my brother.”
The echo of Reichenbach was not lost on Sherlock, who managed a wobbly smile and opened his eyes. The sight of John made him immediately start crying again. John’s hands found their way towards Sherlock’s shoulders which were shaking like leaves in the wind.
John did not know what to do with himself. He had talked through it all with Ella, but of course that did him no good. It had been terrifying what Sherlock had done to himself, but also terrifying that John was capable of hurting Sherlock on top of it all. Enough to get Sherlock all bloody in hospital and at the mercy of one of the most dangerous men alive.
Her rings, which she wore even asleep, were twisted in the wrong directions from her anxious spinning of them. Her clothes not ironed, her hair it's typical early morning mess. Judging from the clock however, it was not anywhere near morning any longer. His Matilda had left their house in a rush, and had forgotten even to make her traditional black, no sugar, no cream, in her favorite mug. All the data fit perfectly to what he already knew; he’d been shot and it was common, and tedious and horribly predictable.
“I know.”
"Well yes."  He said, rolling over in their bed, stretching as if he'd only asked her if she wanted tea or coffee this morning.
Second
“Yes. Children.”
The double doors to the door burst open then, “I came as soon as I heard, where is he? How is he? Sherlock?”
"Of course, you idiot. I already have the invitations." He chuckled, wrapping an arm around her.
She looked down, but continued smiling nevertheless.
During one of John’s mini-naps, his dreams included a large grape and a small orange, speaking in hushed tones about what they were meant to do about someone called “Mikerot”. Upon waking John realized it was not in fact fruit, but rather the gray haired woman, Matilda, and Sherlock. He sat up quickly, embarrassed to be seen sleeping by someone who was essentially a stranger. As he did so, he noticed someone had lain a fleece blanket over his form.
"Lets."
“I expect to hear you've done it, and in full.” She left with slow, calm strides. As she passed, she lay a slim fingered hand on John’s arm. “Good day to you John.”
“Of course.”
“Well it wasn't my idea to be shot, was it?” He sniped back, heart not truly in it. His body felt disconnected from his mind, and his mind itself felt floaty and not completely all there. It was disconcerting, not to be operating at his usual 100%.
John rested his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands as he rubbed vigorously at gritty eyes. To his left Sherlock paced a tense line back and forth, hands ruffling his hair, crossing across his chest, uncrossing and fluffing his hair yet again, before the cycle repeated. As much as he pretended he didn't care about his brother, it was moments like this when the human beneath the aloof act he put on peeked through. It warmed and worried John all at once.
Sherlock did neither. By his estimation John hadn't eaten in a good seven hours, by which point he was usually tearing apart the kitchen for food. The omelette was easy enough to figure out, as was chopping the peppers to go in it. The tea was a simple matter of water warming, and if a rare three biscuits was put on the side of John’s plate, Sherlock figured his partner wouldn't be making a fuss. By the time John opened the bathroom door into their bedroom to get dressed, he could smell the food, and Sherlock had even popped a piece of bread into the toaster.
John didn't take another nap that night.
“Now you ask.” She giggled, head flopping beside their entwined hands, her body seeming to lose a bit of the tension it had initially held.
Fowling and Aaker were like water and oil. It was both exhausting and quite amusing to see them at odds with each other. But alas, Mycroft only got a show for a day and a half.
“How is he?” She managed to barely whisper, her hands coming up to her mouth, as if preparing to block any noise that came out in the chance of bad news.
"Well, have a good day!"
"No, it's fine." He cleared his throat, "But thank you for aiding me in picking them up." They rose simultaneously and she stacked her pile on top his.
Her hollowed cheeks tinted pink. Her eyes widened, and even through the fog of happiness John felt, he noted that she looked better than the last time he’d seen her.
Disclaimer: I don’t own Sherlock.
Matilda is a very tall, thin, middle-aged woman, with hair that is entirely gray, and a face that is sharp and bird like. She is beautiful, in the same alien way that many consider Sherlock to be. She wears a multitude of different styles, but most commonly, a pencil skirt with some shade of blouse and a mid-length wool coat the color of Afghanistan Sand. John has met her a total of 4 times, and it is not till the 5th that he realizes who she is.
“You idiot man.” She scolded, scowling. “If you ever actually die, I will find some manner of haunting you while I walk among the living, am I understood?!” Mycroft knew his wife, and while he could appreciate the threat, he could also see how shaken she was.
“Well, you know me rather well, I suppose."
“How terribly common.” Matilda knew Mycroft wasn't going to wax poetic about living through a near death experience, she knew it wasn't his style. But she’d rather hoped for something more than that for his first words after backing away from the brink of oblivion.
“You haven't eaten in some time, and if you go to bed without food tonight you’ll be unbearable in the morning. Tea?” John nodded, a soft smile on his lips as he sat down. Sherlock set down his plate before turning to the kettle in order to pour.
The funeral was hardly necessary. John went, Sherlock came along as moral support, and Clara stopped by, another woman at her side. “I heard, what happened…. Figured I’d pay my respects.” But John could see even she had no real remorse. He knew his sister had been in possession of a certain spiky personality, one that kept those that loved her just far enough at bay. He and Clara were prime examples.
She leaves not five minutes later and when John asks who she was, Sherlock replies with a clipped tone.
“You better wake up, my love. Who's going to tell me which students cheated on their final if you don’t?” Her words were softly spoken, and breathy with the pressure of fear in her lungs. When  John had called her about the shot through Mycroft’s shoulder, she’d felt every muscle in her body clench, and every organ in her body go ice cold. It easily took place for worst memory…..  The rest of life could never be as terrifying as that moment.
"So you're bored and this is a distraction, then? I'm a distraction?"
jeans. Making an effort."
"We can live a lifetime before that happens, Sherlock. We can have the life together that we
Sherlock bit his bottom lip, looking at John. He shook his head quickly.
Yet? John mentally chides himself. Talk about putting the horse before the cart. He's not even sure he wants that with Sherlock.
"Like what?" Sherlock said.
Mara could feel her face heating slightly. Alexis narrowed her eyes slightly, watching Mara.
Sherlock moved into the kitchen and rinsed out the kettle before refilling it and turning it on. He got down two mugs, put tea bags in, went to the fridge and said a quiet thanks to their not-housekeeper for stocking the fridge with milk, butter, all the essentials. He walked back over to the mugs and waited for the kettle to boil.
"Mmm..." Sherlock breathed into the gap in John's jeans. "You smell delicious..."
He hears the shower turn off and the low creak of the glass shower door opening. His eyes snap open and he looks down at the physical evidence of his and Sherlock's shared wank session, congealing as it trickles slowly down the wall. He grabs an old t-shirt from his washing basket and cleans up the mess guiltily.
"Wait-no. No I'm not."
John breathes out very slowly, looking up at Sherlock.
"Evening."
"No experiments on my ex," John said, laughing.
"Oh, a couple of days ago," Mycroft says airily, "but I’m sure he’s fine."
. Then he thinks,
Two days later Sarah breaks up with John. He's not really surprised, and if he's honest with himself he'd seen it coming a while back. She's been getting more and more distant, quieter, and finally that night at her house she sits him down on the couch and tells him all the reasons it isn't working out.
," Sherlock said. "The pull toward you is so strong that if I come any closer, I doubt I'll be capable of holding back."
I had the potential to... carry out. Deeds which were necessary, but will always be a stain on my conscience. Things I
"There you have it, John," the facsimile said, gesturing at the real Sherlock. "He must be the real Sherlock because, as you have insisted on numerous occasions, nobody other than me has any interest whatsoever in that monograph."
Sherlock breathed out heavily, knowing the pet name wasn't for him, not the
best friend. Why isn’t it a big deal to you?"
After a little while, Sherlock pushes John to lie down on the bed. He looks down at him for a few moments before gently lifting off and moving to lie beside him on the bed. They lie in silence for several minutes, on their backs, John staring at the ceiling and Sherlock with his eyes closed.
"Sherlock..." John gasps. "Please..."
"I'll get you a glass of water. Get some rest," Sherlock said, and left the room, pausing just outside the door with his hands clenched into fists and his eyes squeezed closed, desperate to re-enter the room and take what he wanted: touch John, hold him,
"Mmm, we absolutely should."
"You haven't asked about us," John said. "Me and the other Sherlock."
. You were ripped from my life just as suddenly as I was from yours. Like we'd both died that day."
"And you like that, don't you?" Sherlock murmurs against his lips, before kissing him fleetingly, barely a kiss at all.
He potters aimlessly around the flat for most of the day, unwilling to admit to himself that he's worried, tidying up some of Sherlock’s old experiments and cleaning out the fridge. He ventures out in the late afternoon to do a Tesco shop. While waiting in line at the checkout, he thinks he sees Sherlock walk past the plate-glass windows at the front of the supermarket. He abandons his basket and races out to catch him, startling the random man-in-a-long-coat he’s mistaken for Sherlock. He apologises profusely, embarrassed, and makes a hasty retreat, forgetting all about the shopping until he’s already back at home.
All too soon the smile was gone, but Sherlock felt its after-effects, could almost smell the sunlight on his skin. He sat, sipping his coffee and enjoying the evidence of John's returned appetite (trying not to concentrate too much on his mouth).
Sherlock breathed out slowly.
John swallows, staring at Sherlock’s mouth.
"No reason why you can't anyway..." John breathes, raising his head, trying to brush his lips against Sherlock's.
"Ordinarily, yes, I'm using version 2.0 of the system. It's only used in extreme cases."
"I imagine it'll be an adjustment from how most things were in the Reverie, to how they are in the real world," Sherlock said, avoiding looking at John, focusing on the detritus on the coffee table.
yes."
"Yes. I'll... I'll get dressed, I'll go to the shop."
"Mmm.
"It's not as simple as that," John says, running a hand through his hair, trying not to think about just how much he enjoyed himself.. "I wish it was, but I have
Sherlock merely gapes at John, both his brain and mouth in neutral for once.
The next thing John knows, he's pushed up against the kitchen counter, Sherlock's half-naked, warm body pressed against his back. He didn't even hear him come in.
Once the implant was embedded, Sherlock waited.
Sherlock smirks and joins John on the bed, lying on his side beside him, trailing his fingertips down the front of the t-shirt John sleeps in. John swallows, watching the pale hand slowly, slowly moving down his torso. His cock gives a highly interested twitch when he thinks about the possibility of Sherlock curling his long fingers around it.
"You know how I get. The black moods. The frustration. The boredom," Sherlock said. "There have been times when I wanted all that to just... end."
command probably won't work at this stage."
Sherlock smiles a little and then he’s off to his bedroom in a swirl of blue silk dressing gown, leaving John clutching at the edge of the table, his heart pounding rapidly.
Sherlock is still looking like he’s just been slapped when John slams the downstairs outside door.
"I’m busy. Maybe later."
"Ligature marks around the neck. Petechial haemorrhaging in the eyes, consistent with asphyxia from strangulation," John says, confirming what Sherlock has no doubt deduced already. John lifts the body's right hand, examining it. "Dead about three hours, based on lividity."
John looks at Sherlock, eyes narrowed. "That’s not fair. You can’t say that."
"Tell me something nobody knows."
," John cried, and his hips stuttering against Sherlock's arse, his body shaking as he let go, groaning as he spilled inside of him. Sherlock pushed John back to kneeling and rode him, wringing every last drop from him, relishing John's reaction. John clung to Sherlock's torso as he shuddered his orgasm deep inside Sherlock's body, his face pressed against Sherlock's back. "Sherlock... oh my
Y O U P R I C K
"Tell me you don't want me
"I know I claimed not to have one," Sherlock said without looking at John, "but I think we both know that isn't true."
"I see," Sherlock said, looking away.
"Mmm. Can't live with them, can't have heterosexual sex without them. Or so I've read. Not really my area," Sherlock says, arching an eyebrow and adding, "As you know."
. I'm not good at that, but you are, and you make me a better person," Sherlock says, looking uncomfortable with this admission of weakness.
"I was under the impression that talking was the last thing we needed."
"No, not... not as such," John says, starting to get confused about his reaction.
' and '
John jolts a moment later as he thinks he hears a dull thud in the hall outside his bedroom door. He freezes, hand still on his cock, heart still racing from his orgasm, eyes wide in the darkness as he listens.
"Yeah, I read the manual. If '
"No," Sherlock answers for him, "you haven't. But you like the idea of it, don't you? You like the idea of a part of me inside of you..."
John swallowed, clenching his jaw.
Sherlock chooses that moment to slip his hands into the back of John's pyjama bottoms, cupping his arse cheeks with both hands, squeezing and parting them as he pulls John’s groin against him. John swallows, looking slightly panicked for a moment, and Sherlock lifts his head and captures his parted lips in a sudden, hard kiss, forcing his tongue against John's before he can start thinking too much.
"Always," Sherlock murmured. "Pant lines ruin my suit."
"That doesn’t mean I hate you all of a sudden."
"Expired," Sherlock bit out as he removed the broken condom. "Some time ago. It's been... a while since I've had occasion to use these."
She knew that the user had prepared quite thoroughly for an extended session in the system, and she had been briefed on the stubborn nature of the man in question prior to his use of Reverie—his addictive, thrill-seeking personality. She had no doubt that this would be quite the challenge.
After thinking for a moment, he turns the key in the lock and leans back against the door, breathing out slowly. He unbuttons his jeans.
"You're angry with me," Sherlock observes.
Sherlock pauses momentarily, looking up at John.
"Not really, but since you ask, I've been working."
"That wasn't what I meant-"
close.
John is straight, after all, and certainly not attracted to his (amazing, gorgeous, dazzling) flatmate. He's definitely not considering sliding a little closer to Sherlock on the cab seat so that their thighs will touch. Not even for a second. He's not filled with anticipation, excited by the possibility of contact, thrilled by the knowledge that Sherlock would not pull away.
"I’m not your
"You look at me instead of your girlfriends when they're unfortunate enough to occupy the same room as me, and your body language is entirely focused on me: feet pointing in my direction, your head positioned so that I'm on your right-hand side at all times (you have slight hearing loss in your left ear, not enough to be noticeable to anyone but myself, including you, consciously at least), you half-listen to the mindless drivel your vapid conquests come out with, but always focus your full attention on what I have to say, a fact demonstrated by Whatshername's having left twenty seconds ago without your noticing."
"Clearly you didn't handle it, or John wouldn't be in a
"That was... amazing," John says, careful to keep his voice low as he leans over to Sherlock.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and John gave up on that argument.
John went to walk toward Sherlock and stumbled slightly, Sherlock moving quickly to grab his biceps and steady him. Sherlock breathed in, getting a lungful of the fresh scent of John's sweat, and sighed softly. John froze, looking up at Sherlock.
"You'd better call us a car," John said, without looking at Sherlock.
"Smartarse. Oh, but
"Would you like me to stop?"
"Don't say straight, John, it's a tiresome untruth and it's beneath you. As I hope to soon be."
"You- what?" John blurts out, his brow creasing, cup of tea paused and forgotten, halfway to his mouth.
"Tell me why you did it."
"Before we met, you were contemplating suicide."
to Sherlock. Not ever. Not when he feels like this. Not when Sherlock can
"Understandable."
"I knew you weren't him," John said. "I knew the instant you kissed me."
. You can't stay in here," Mara said, getting the sense that she was fighting a losing battle.
"I disappeared."
John just blinks as Sherlock illustrates his point by pushing his erect cock against his thigh, through sheet, blanket and pyjamas.
"I'm attracted to you, you're attracted to me..."
"One moment," Sherlock breathed, irked.
"If I may interject," the facsimile said. "Sherlock, describe to me the difference between Trichinopoly and Bird's Eye ash."
"So I take it the case is...
"That-
In Sherlock's scrawled handwriting, it reads:
"Because I want you, John. I need you," Sherlock breathes, moving his face closer to John’s.
John shakes his head. "I didn't change."
, I can't stop it..."
"To connect to the system the user has an implant, known as a 'BCI'—a Brain-Computer Interface—installed. It sends data via the central nervous system to the cortical neurons, but crucially, integrates with the user's tissue. Shutting down the system would result in the brain connecting to... nothing."
"I suppose you'd better start by telling us why you're here," the facsimile said.
Sherlock shook his head slightly and reached for the bottle of lubricant, almost sending it flying in his eagerness. He squeezed more than he intended onto the tip of his cock, breathing out slowly as the cool gel started trickling down his hot skin. He put the bottle aside and stroked the liquid down his shaft, letting out a shivery breath. He then moved his fingertips to between John's parted legs, seeking and finding his target quickly. John breathed out heavily as Sherlock pressed against his entrance with a fingertip.
He stood in the doorway, looking away as John stripped off his jeans and shirt, then slipped under the covers. Sherlock looked at John again, finding himself being watched in return.
"Don't be like that, John," Sherlock murmurs, then he pulls his thin inside-out t-shirt up and over his head, dropping it on John's bedroom floor. He looks down, a slight smile quirking his lips as John looks him up and down, taking in the expanse of pale skin over toned but lean muscles. His eyes rest on Sherlock's own trouser-tent.
Those are the last coherent words John manages to get out for a while. Sherlock is tight and hot and responsive and before long, John has managed to sit up, has wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s thin-but-strong body, has hooked his hands over Sherlock’s shoulders and is pulling him down hard onto his dick. Sherlock has dropped his head to kiss John, a constant, demanding kiss, both men groaning into it as they move together. Sherlock’s thigh muscles tremble as he rides John’s cock, resisting John’s strength as the shorter man drags him down, forces him to take his thick, hard dick inside him over and over and over.
"You invaded Afghanistan, John," he murmured against John's skin. "You can do this."
John feels lost in the best possible way. He's surrendered himself utterly to the lust coursing through his veins, energising every atom of his being. He wants this man more than he's ever wanted anything; more, he thinks, than he ever
"He gave me the slip," Mara said.
Sherlock nodded again.
Sherlock shrugged slightly.
Prominent on the bedside table is a pump bottle of lubricant. The top drawer of the bedside table is hanging very slightly open and John tells himself that he’s not going to look inside, but he just can’t resist. He pulls gently on the handle and the drawer slides open.
"My own good isn't my primary concern anymore."
"What do you want me to say?" John asks slightly awkwardly, walking over to the window, draping his coat over the back of his chair.
John tries to keep his breathing steady and even as Sherlock moves above him, slowly raising then lowering his hips, taking John’s cock inside him inch by agonizing inch, a little deeper with each rise and fall. The look on Sherlock’s face is like nothing John has ever seen during sex; completely present, so utterly focused on John that he feels like the centre of the universe. All that exists is John and Sherlock and John inside Sherlock, and Sherlock sinking all the way down onto John’s iron-hard shaft, and John with his breath taken away and Sherlock all around him.
"No," Sherlock says simply, then kisses John until he’s on his back, breathless and clinging to him and unable to argue.
"And no body parts in the fridge."
John blinks and sits up, stretches his neck and looks down at his phone in his hand, frowning before cancelling the message, saving it to drafts. Mycroft indulges himself in a private little smile, giving John the distinct impression that he knows what the message contained.
"Mmmhmm," John agreed between licks. "One of my favourite things."
"John—"
Mara was just starting to really enjoy herself, commencing her fifth bank holdup of a planned series of ten, when one of the waiting customers tackled her as she pulled out her gun. The man wrestled her to the ground, knocking the pistol from her grasp and the wind from her lungs. She struggled against his surprisingly strong grip and gasped as he pulled off her ski mask.
He’s only been at the clinic for two hours. He’s still confused over their breakfast conversation that morning and even more confused about his epic pre-work wank session, so he’s less inclined to tolerate Sherlock calling him home to make a cup of tea, (or pass him his phone, or find his skull, or help catch tarantulas he’s let loose in the flat [like last month – John’s still not forgiven him for that one]), than he would otherwise be.
"Of course I followed you. I care about your wellbeing."
Sherlock heard John flick off the kettle prior to boiling and get down the bottle of Talisker from the top shelf of the cupboard, with two glasses.
"You weren't using them," John murmured, slipping his free hand down past the side of his hip, pulling his right leg up, exposing himself in a way that had Sherlock digging his fingernails into his thighs. "Seemed a shame. And you did leave me
"Well, no..."
"Duty calls," John said with a grin as Sherlock hailed a taxi and one appeared out of thin air.
"But what about you?" John said. "What about Rosie?"
"We can't exactly just turn the thing off!" said Topher Quinn, a harried-looking Onira-Tech UK technician.
"Hold that thought," John said, then slid off the bed and disappeared into the ensuite.
Sherlock closed his eyes, listening to John's breathing, enjoying the weight of the head against his shoulder. He turned his head, pressing his nose into John's hair, breathing in the scent of him.
"Not amusing."
"You're eager," Sherlock comments, in a not-entirely-approving tone of voice.
"This is perfect," Sherlock murmured after a few moments' silent thought. "I wanted it ages ago, but... I wouldn't have changed it."
"It's really fucking not."
"Oh. I see."
"If he doesn't look after you," she said, "you let me know."
John just watched Sherlock, a sleepy frown on his face.
"It was quite a big load this morning, wasn't it, John? Been a while, has it?"
"We could order some food," Sherlock said.
"Yes, I have."
"I couldn't even if I tried," John concedes, looking back up into Sherlock's eyes. "Come here."
going to follow me."
John stills his hand and orders, "Take it. Ride me. Fuck my hand."
He leaves for the supermarket without another word.
, you
"You may be comfortable in denial, John, but I’m not."
"I'm sorry."
"Good night, John," Sherlock murmured.
John slowly moved back to pushing and pulling, fucking Sherlock with his fingers but avoiding his prostate. Sherlock regained the power of speech.
They exchange the barest pleasantries at their rare coincidental mealtimes, Sherlock’s behaviour utterly cordial, formal even. John just goes with the flow, because that’s always been where his strength lies - in compromise and denial, in making-do.
"The two of you were so similar in so many ways," John said, "but so different in others."
Mara could understand the attraction to this type of Reverie. She'd always loved detective stories as a child, in fact, it was part of the reason she'd taken such an interest in psychology and its applications in law enforcement. She could understand wanting to play the lead role, the hero—she'd seen it hundreds of times in every variation of James Bond or Poirot fantasy.
As he looks out the window of the taxi, trying to distract himself, John tries very hard but he can't stop picturing that arse. Remembering the way the cheeks clenched, tightening the fabric as Sherlock moved on his hands and knees. Imagining peeling down the expensive trousers and exposing those firm cheeks. Imagining biting them, licking them, running his hands over them. Imagining gently parting them and rubbing the head of his coc-
, that mouth.
Sherlock reached for John, his fingers running through his hair, pushing it back from his forehead. John looked up at Sherlock as he slowly stretched the waistband of the shorts out, over, down and off, grinning as Sherlock half-helped, half-hindered, his long, usually-graceful legs ungainly in that situation. Sherlock's heart pounded double-time as the cool bedroom air hit the superheated skin of his eager cock. John looked down at it and licked his lips, and Sherlock had to shove the heel of his left hand into his mouth to keep from begging.
Sherlock's response is a low groan and a quick shove forward to take John deep into his mouth again. This time, John's fingers tighten in Sherlock's hair, stopping his movement. Sherlock's lips tighten around John's shaft and he sucks hard, his cheeks hollowing as his head is slowly pulled back.
They both paused for a moment, a little surprised at Sherlock's honest answer.
"Oh fuck, yeah, you like it," John breathed, moving his hand faster, pushing his fingers deeper with each thrust.
"I want you to fuck me," John groaned out, too far gone to use any flowery euphemisms.
John's eyes slowly travelled down Sherlock's body, caressing his pale skin in a way that was almost tactile. Sherlock swallowed loudly in the silence of the room as John's eyes focussed on his boxer shorts and the steadily increasing tumescence therein. John's tongue darted out to touch his bottom lip and Sherlock's eyes followed the movement jealously, with longing.
Sherlock squeezes John gently when he feels a series of gentle taps and pauses, made by John's index finger against his spine. A slow smile creeps across his lips.
"You enjoyed it, I take it," Sherlock says.
John feels Sherlock pull back, gasps quietly as the cold kitchen air hits his saliva-slick cock and his hands are released. He cautiously opens his eyes and looks down at Sherlock, who is now sitting back on his haunches. As he watches, Sherlock drags one long, white thumb along his bottom lip, looks at the smear of collected semen closely for a moment before sucking his thumb clean. Then his gaze raises to John's face.
"Want you to come with my cock inside you... Do you want my big, hard cock, Sherlock?" John is shocked at the words coming out of his mouth.
Sherlock glances at John for a moment like he’s about to speak, then shakes his head and returns his attention to his mobile. John is too busy clenching his jaw and staring out the cab window to notice anyway.
"What was
"You don't think it'd make things... weird?"
, Sherlock," John said softly. "Where else would I go?"
"J, O, H, N," Sherlock said. "Did you really think so little of my deductive reasoning and pattern predicting skills as to imagine you wouldn't be caught at the bank managed by Nicholas
John swallows hard and looks up at Sherlock’s face.
"That’s not true," Sherlock says, grabbing at John’s arm.
John dipped his head to lick along the shaft of Sherlock's cock again and curled his fingers inside of him at the same time. Sherlock's whole body clenched.
"Are you telling me you didn't enjoy yourself?" Sherlock murmurs, "Because I know that's a lie."
"That’s what I have you for," Sherlock murmurs with a small smile. "Frankly, I know how terrifying I will most likely be in a courtship situation, so I wanted to spare you that. But if you won't be talked out of it, I suppose I have no choice," Sherlock murmurs, then clears his throat. "John, come home with me. Be mine."
"Let me touch you..." John breathes. "I need to touch you."
"I can, and I will," John said, smiling slightly as he watched Sherlock walk away to hail a cab. "This is where I belong. With that mad bastard over there."
The coat is back in place, hugging that long, lithe body- err. Keeping Sherlock warm. Obviously. Nothing more than that. Certainly not removing temptation, acting as a frustrating barrier against John's magnetically-drawn gaze.
"You’re obviously not my equal in an intellectual capacity, but if I wanted someone like that, well -"
"Never again, John," Sherlock breathed. "
"You don’t want to acknowledge what’s happened?"
"Have you given him a reason to leave?"
"If you hated me, I couldn’t bear it," Sherlock murmurs, avoiding John’s eyes. "I couldn’t function. I wouldn’t survive it."
Sherlock pushed John off him and rolled onto his front, his legs still spread, his hips instinctively thrusting, grinding his cock against the mattress.
"Nope, can't think of anything you could use, right now," John breathes.
"Right," John sighs, exasperated.
"Is it?" John said, anguished.
Mycroft rises from his chair and twirls his umbrella thoughtfully between his perfectly manicured fingers before meeting John's eye.
Stop the fucking press!"
"Oh, I knew that."
Sherlock nodded once, a little taken aback. "Too right."
"I really didn't. I didn't even... it wasn't my intention," Sherlock says, almost apologising, but characteristically not quite saying the words.
"The American failed. Arrangements have been made."
"I will," John lies. He can tell from the expression on Mycroft's face that he's seen straight through the lie.
Mara was mystified as to why someone with all the power of Reverie at their disposal would choose to play not the dashing hero, but his sidekick. Sensing her moment to approach, Mara weaved her way through the gathering crowd.
Sherlock glances back over his shoulder, looking supremely uninterested, and grunts quietly before turning his head back to the wall.
"A conversation was what started all this. I’ve been trying to avoid an escalation in tensions by avoiding talking to you unnecessarily."
"You don't want that."
"If you had any idea how many times I've dreamed of this..."
"I think it would make things
"Sherlock..." John said, rubbing the bridge of his nose.
Sherlock gasps, a soft, surprised sound, then groans, "You have no idea, John."
"Good?" John murmured, rubbing his thumb in small, gentle circles against the underside of Sherlock's shaft.
"I didn’t think so. Once, my dear brother disappeared for two weeks. He lived on the street for that time, without any ill effects. He’s quite capable of looking after himself, you know. Despite all appearances to the contrary."
"Sherlock?" John breathed. "You're shaking. You okay?"
John moved closer and steadied himself with one hand on the small of Sherlock's back. Sherlock could hear wet sounds as John slowly stroked his cock. He shuffled closer on his knees.
"Other than that."
Moriarty was right. He’s Sherlock’s pet.
"Yes, I did. And a certain part of your anatomy seems to appreciate that rather a lot," Sherlock muses, grinding his groin against John’s. "I hadn't envisaged you being quite so willing in light of our earlier conversation..."
, in my world that I cannot bear to be without. You may not believe me, but I mourned for you too. I did. I would find myself thinking about nothing but what you must be thinking, must be feeling."
"Yes, I would," Gabe murmurs, nodding sincerely. "Will you let me?"
"Sherlock, look at me," John said, his voice rough.
John Watson was fucking him with his tongue and Sherlock Holmes was sure this was how he was going to die. He could see it clearly in his mind: stiff, formal, dignified Mycroft Holmes ordering a headstone engraved "Here lies Sherlock Holmes, killed by anilingus".
Sherlock couldn't answer with his voice, all he could do was to plant his hands on the headboard of the bed and push, forcing his body down the bed, forcing John's fingers deeper.
Sherlock watched as John squeezed a large amount of the thick lube onto his fingertips. John shuffled a little closer and Sherlock gasped as the cold gel touched his hot skin. John wasted no time in working a finger inside of Sherlock who just watched him, his eyes slightly unfocused, his hips undulating slowly in time with the invading digit. A second finger joined the first and Sherlock held his breath, trying to push down, trying to take both fingers deeper.
After a few long, silent moments, John slowly sides the drawer open again. He stares at the dildo and his first, honest thought is,
"It seems that he self-installed a series of automated feeding drips and a catheter prior to 'logging in'. His extended use of your little system is unequivocally intentional and calculated."
One more choked-off moan (John’s pretty sure Sherlock just came) and John’s coming himself, not even caring as he shoots streams of white on Mrs Hudson’s wallpaper. He leans heavily against the wall, breathing harshly, his eyes squeezed closed as he strokes himself through his orgasm.
John moved one hand slowly and ran his fingertips lightly down the side of Sherlock's throat. Sherlock gasped, then breathed out heavily as his body broke out into gooseflesh.
"Yes, John," Sherlock breathed, "Oh god yes..."
"This isn't you making amends, Sherlock," John said softly against his skin. "It's us making love."
"A connection which isn't there, I assure you. I don't see why you're so upset, anyway. It's not the first time I've been unreachable."
"You are, as ever, the most determined man I know," Sherlock said.
"No, he’s not. I take it you don’t know where he is?" John asks, eyes narrowing as he attempts to gauge the veracity of the elder Holmes brother’s response.
," John said. "If I had..."
Gabe smiles naughtily and moves away from John, then sprawls on the couch, his erection tenting his black trousers, his thighs parted indecently. John swallows, staring openly.
It just makes John angrier. He walks into the sitting room.
"But you
After a few long moments, John's arms tightened around Sherlock's body, stilling him. John's breaths puffed harshly against Sherlock's sweaty skin, pressing messy, lazy kisses to his back, tasting him with his tongue.
Sherlock sat in the chair at John's bedside as the doctor prepared the equipment for the procedure.
want this."
He's such a nice guy, but she never feels like he's really there with her. He always seems like he's getting ready to run off, which is true, he admits. He's a great friend and she’s attracted to him, but she doesn't see a future with him. She wants marriage and children and she doesn't see John settling down. She sees his future involving running down darkened London streets at all hours, chasing criminals and following Sherlock. A life of danger and intrigue isn't what she wants.
"Why?" John says, keeping his voice flat.
Sherlock smiles an unguarded, slightly goofy smile and kisses John's cheek quickly before walking to the curb, arm already raised to hail a cab, which, of course, appears from nowhere and stops for him. He's got one leg in the open door of the cab when he pauses to look back at John.
"Yes, Moriarty,
John looked to his left, at the space on the sofa formerly occupied by Pamela. The downstairs door slammed a moment later. John looked at the doorway, then back at Sherlock, his thin lips pinched together with barely-suppressed fury.
He walks. A fast walk, a purposeful one. The purpose being escape. Not to anywhere in particular, because Sherlock knows all the places he would go, and the last thing he wants right now is to be found.
"Why not?"
Trouble?
"For the next time I eat you out?" John asked. "Good to know."
And then what? Make his move? Sneer? Both are equally likely. John doesn’t know which prospect frightens him more. Over the course of the afternoon he’s managed to work his way back to being firmly in denial and has every intention of staying there indefinitely. It’s just a phase. He’s confused. He’s lonely and too attached to the only friend he really has.
"John," Mara said, walking toward the table.
Sherlock’s eyes widen and he looks abruptly away as John says the word ‘hate’.
"It's too early in the morning for this," John grumbles, shaking his head as he rubs his left eye.
"No," Sherlock says, "but I've been enjoying it nonetheless..."
"If you like. I'm the exception to your self-imposed rule."
," the facsimile said. "You can
"I can’t have you hating me," Sherlock murmurs. "That just wouldn’t do."
That mouth is currently speaking to him.
John stops on the landing and looks up at Sherlock. "Meeting Tony for drinks."
John doesn’t dare masturbate, doesn’t even dare think about it. He’s convinced that Sherlock could be listening to him at any moment and doesn’t want to give him any further ammunition.
"For you," Sherlock mutters.
"Nope, I'm good," John says quickly, frowning as he backs toward the door, bumping into the door frame in his haste to get away. "G'night."
And then,
"I've said sorry for that."
"I would kill for you. I mean, I have killed for you, but I would do it again, without hesitation," John said. "I would kill every last fucker in this building to protect you."
... taboo?"
"That’s all this is to you? Fuck you, Sherlock."
"I want you like this forever," Sherlock said. "I've
going to give you what you need..."
"My bed was occupied."
"I may not always care about
Sherlock's hand went to John's upper arm and pulled him closer, on the verge of desperation, trying to bring their bodies together. He let out a low groan as John pulled away again. That teasing smile of John's was back in place, almost infuriating in its allure.
"I didn't turn it off, John," Sherlock breathes fervently, moving closer. "I didn't turn off anything. I pushed it to the back of my mind, so I could focus on something other than you. Do you honestly think you've been any less overwhelming than I?"
Sherlock's forehead creased and he pushed his face into the pillow, trying not to speak.
"Sherlock, I'm about thirty seconds away from coming."
"Mmm," Sherlock hums, not looking up from his mobile.
"You were all I could think about. Even now, it's a struggle not to get lost in you."
"Told you you'd fuck your back," John murmured through a mouthful of toast and jam.
"Tony?" Sherlock says, his head tilting to one side in query.
, he wants to.
Sherlock smiles breathlessly as he moves against John, "I wonder how tight your virgin body will be for me..."
Sherlock pulls away slightly, a teasing smile on his lips. "You're magnificent when you're angry, by the way..."
"A rather special twat."
"Mmm?" John said softly, his lips brushing against Sherlock's ear, sending sparks all down his right side.
Sherlock searches John’s eyes, his thumb stroking the doctor’s cheek.
John unzips his fly. This will be his second wank of the day and it's not even gone ten. He almost wishes he had a shift at the practice, just to distract him and get him away from this damnably... inspiring... man.
than that. Writhing alone in hotel beds, touching myself in a way you would never, torturing myself with thoughts of you, of your body, of your love, of your lust."
"That's enough!" Sherlock roars, surging to his feet.
"True, but he has a reason to come home now," Mycroft says, a slight, polite smirk curling his lips. "Unless my sources are mistaken as to the nature of his... attachment to you."
John frowns.
"Yeah," John said. "And then you disappeared and the
"I don't want it easy," Sherlock said urgently, "I want
"Just an observation," John said with a small shrug.
"But you..." Sherlock said.
"Have I said the wrong thing already?" Sherlock said softly.
, Sherlock thought.
When John arrives home from the supermarket an hour later, he ignores Sherlock. He's still hunched over his laptop and doesn't seem to have moved an inch in the hour John's been gone.
"Apologies, Mr Holmes," Dague-Ross said, shooting Topher a warning look. "What my colleague means to say, is that the user knew the hazards involved in use of the system. All of our users do. He signed paperwork acknowledging those risks."
"I'd probably be dead if it wasn't for Mycroft. He's the one who found me. He visited from time to time, after... After," John said. "We've become friends."
"Quite."
"Mara Kint."
Sherlock walked through the hospital corridors with Mycroft at his side. Mycroft had gotten the message pretty quickly that Sherlock wasn't interested in anything else he had to say, and stayed mercifully silent as they walked.
"Anything..." Sherlock murmurs. "Everything."
Thanks for reading. Hope you enjoyed. :)
"That's the thing, I never did want kids," John said, then paused for a moment, frowning a little. "My childhood wasn't... happy. As you know."
"John, I just need to talk to you. Will you give me five minutes?"
"Sherlock, where are you?"
"I always
John ignores Sherlock's reaction, moving to kiss his neck desperately.
Sherlock raised his head, frowning slightly as he met John's fierce gaze.
"It's strange," Sherlock said. "I
"I would have
"No, please..." Sherlock whispers, his body starting to tremble. "It's too much..."
"Anything at all. Suck me, fuck me... Hurt me..." Gabe whispers urgently, his breath hot on John’s lips. "I'll suck you... eat your ass... anything."
"Well..." Topher started.
... fuck..."
Sherlock moves closer still, his lips only fractions of an inch away from John’s. John unconsciously parts his lips, breathing out gently through his mouth.
"Did you just sniff me?" John murmured sleepily.
"I would never think less of you for feeling the same," John said quietly. "If we'd been together..."
"Right," John murmurs, frowning.
"Good morning, Doctor Watson," Mycroft says. "I was hoping to have a chat with my brother, but I see that he isn’t in."
"Fine," Sherlock said, his eyes narrowed. "I'll buy a second refrigerator."
Another sulky grunt.
"I did find that box of toys under your bed," John breathed.
, Sherlock thought.
John licked his lips quickly but remained silent.
"Right..."
His face creases into an expression of concern when Sherlock's only answer is a long, shaky exhale.
* * * * *
"What?" he said angrily. "What do you want?"
"Would you?"
- How do you-" John says, then stops himself, saying, "Scratch that, don't tell me."
"Rosie was a brilliant, bright little girl. She grew so fast, and she took to you," John said. "You'd read stories to her, and explode things in the kitchen for her, at least until I stopped you. You told her all about our work, and loved her like your own."
Sherlock doesn’t respond, doesn’t even give any indication that he’s still aware of John’s presence. John lets out a huff of breath and storms out of the flat.
He let out a slightly hysterical giggle and John took that as a signal to probe alongside his tongue with a gentle finger. Sherlock froze and tensed, but also let out a moan of enjoyment.
Sherlock frowned deeply, the apology on the tip of his tongue held back, knowing as he did that John didn't want to hear it.
John pulled back from the kiss again and tore his vest top off, over his head. Sherlock's eyes roamed over his chest, the patch of pale chest hair, the nipples the same colour as his lips, the scar tissue on his left shoulder, the sparse trail of hair leading down past his belly button...
"Tall, nicely-built, big blue eyes and dimples? Yeah, not my type at all. Ugly fucker."
"Dating."
"I've got you, Sherlock," John murmurs, one strong hand rubbing the detective's heaving back. "It's okay."
John moves into the kitchen, putting the groceries away, not looking at Sherlock, not speaking to him, not acknowledging his presence in any way. He hears an extended break in Sherlock's typing and knows he's being watched, but he doesn't acknowledge that either.
Sherlock took a mouthful of whisky before starting to speak.
Sherlock glances back at John, then narrows his eyes slightly before returning his attention to the corpse.
The danger is part of it. He knows how dangerous it could be, letting Sherlock in, giving an emotionally stunted self-declared sociopath the power to really hurt him, a power nobody else has ever held. He knows, but his hands are steady if a bit sweaty, his body is flooded with adrenaline and he wouldn’t dream of ever saying anything but
"You fucking won't."
. Utterly intoxicating,
, and then little by little pushing his tongue inside. Sherlock was letting out embarrassing whimpering moans that he couldn't stop, his right leg flailing off to the side and forgotten about, his left hand gripping his left knee, pulling it tightly against his chest, his other hand grabbing his own hair so hard he was sure he was going to end up with a bald patch.
"There aren't any words for the ache inside, mourning the loss of even the possibility of something more with you. For the absolute emotional devastation of knowing that even if I could come back to you, you might not want to know me anymore."
"I could go right off you, you know," Sherlock said, hiding his face in the pillow.
Sherlock's body started to tremble slightly, tensed and tight like a coiled spring, the electricity in the room affecting his central nervous system.
"I want you to come home."
"Right away," Sherlock said softly.
"God yes."
"Still, it saved on lubricant..."
There's movement downstairs, Sherlock's bedroom door opening and closing. John recognises the sound of the dry hinge creaking and the door fitting itself into its frame. Perhaps Sherlock is going to bed after all.
John frowned and started to speak again, but Sherlock cut him off with an irritated flick of his hand through the air, as though casting away John's protests.
Sherlock's cheeks flushed a little. "Spoken like a man who's never had a wet dream over High Renaissance art," he murmured with a mad smile.
"Drama queen," Sherlock muttered.
"Anything," John begs, offers, prays. "Sherlock, just…
"Sherlock," Mycroft said gently, "Why do you think he threw his life away?"
wanted you like this. I
…" John whimpers, his body tensing, staring up into Sherlock’s eyes.
"You know this is a new jumper, because I bought it yesterday and you saw me take it out of the bag when I got home. What's with the compliments?"
"Good night, John," Sherlock practically purrs, turning onto his side on the sofa, looking up at him with what John would probably describe as longing, were the expression on any other face.
The facsimile looked at the real Sherlock, a pleased smile on his face.
Just thinking about that look sends a shiver through John's body and he starts stroking his cock in earnest.
"No, I don't mean that. Tell me you're sorry you didn't take me with you."
"That's not the point! I thought you were dead. It properly fucked me up for a long time, Sherlock. You were
John was not stupid, he knew Sherlock to be attracted to criminals and psychopaths. Irene Adler was a criminal and he knew Sherlock was attracted to her cleverness. John was so dull and boring compared to the intellectual games to be had with someone like Irene or Sandra. John admitted to himself that what he was feeling was jealousy. Which was the most stupid feeling to have so close to one’s wedding.
“I was going to tell you now, you needn’t change your clothes as you’re not in lab today. You are playing an older medical student and do not usually wear suits anyway since you wear scrubs at the hospital,” Sherlock explained.
“What if I don’t want to be safe? What if I joined you? You said so yourself, I enjoy Dangerous. Why did you keep it from me? Or did you want to be the Great Sherlock Holmes who does not need a faithful sidekick? ‘Alone protects me’ and all that shite?”
“I love you John Watson,” Sherlock proclaimed fervently.
“I will not speak more about this John,” Sherlock interrupted, “Now go back to sleep, you need your energy to tackle the case.”
John tried to stay engaged but acting was proving rather difficult. Maria tried inviting him into the conversation by asking his medical opinion on something interesting, but John had to admit he wasn’t following which earned him a scoffing groan from Cynthia and an eyeroll from Sherlock.
On day 17 after the Culverton case (sober, unless you count the secret cigarettes and nicotine patches), John had decided the restrictions placed on Sherlock would be lightened. He could now leave the house unsupervised, but had to be back home by nighttime unless John was with him on a case. He could also do what he wanted around the house and start using chemicals in his experiments. However, John would still supervise.
“Your bedroom is ready for you,” Sherlock blurted out suddenly, “At Baker Street.”
“Sherlock, did they do anything else besides whipping?” John knew this maybe was not the most pressing question as Sherlock was in so much pain already, but it was something he had to ask before they could go further.
“They are, John.”
Sherlock’s hand slipped out on the table next to his tray. When John didn’t respond, Sherlock kicked him in the shins under the table.
He had been unhappy to find out there was only one bed, which was ridiculous, of course as a newly married couple they would need to sleep in one bed. But apparently John had failed to account for all the details of their trip and had simply forgotten that sleeping arrangements would be different. Sherlock could not help but roll his eyes, shaking his head.
“Oh, I’ve already performed this surgery on the field. Maybe somebody who hasn’t tried it before should be given the opportunity to try it out? I wouldn’t want to steal the show.” John admitted this as a modest gentleman to his peers, while giving a subtle calculating glance towards his teacher. George caught the glance and gave John a smug look.
Sherlock looked at John with shining eyes. John recognized the same expression as in the tube car from the case he’d called The Empty Hearse. John had then confessed that Sherlock had been the best and wisest man he’d ever known. Of course it ended up being a ruse, the bloody bastard. But somehow he knew the teary-eyed expression was genuine. Sherlock – for all his great acting ability and charm – could not fake the look of surprised gratitude that had graced his face then.
“Now you’re being voluntarily obtuse John! Because of Sandra! Sandra needs to know we are her allies so we can get close to her and catch her!”
“What! What the bloody—What?” John gaped, slamming his fork on the table.
Sherlock had deduced the blonde waitress was around 25, had a degree in anthropology but as a true millennial had found no work beyond unpaid internships in her field, which forced her to work low-paying jobs to stay afloat. She lived alone in a low-cost apartment and had a siamese cat. She seemed to be grieving somebody she had loved, maybe a close friend. She prized her independence and it wasn’t as if a professor in anatomy were swimming in money, but if they lived together it would be better than her finances at the moment. Unfortunately the professor had yet to pop the question about living together, which was complicated by the fact he was strongly allergic to cats.
“Sherlock how much does this room cost?”
There was a soft knock at the door. “…John?” Sherlock’s voice breathed through the keyhole.
John had to accept that he could both chastise himself for hurting his best friend and accept that Sherlock thanked him for his apology.
Sherlock must have seen the glint in John's eye that meant he was actually curious and ready to be amazed by the detective’s cleverness. Sherlock stood impressively illuminated by the streetlamp under the window.
“Damn you and your Excel sheet!”
So this is how he came to decide to make breakfast in bed. He hoped John would enjoy it, even though breakfast was a rather pedestrian routine.
They slept soundly that night, tangled in the sheets until noon.
“That’s not what I meant John, I meant if this act is too much for you we can both leave together and forget this case, if you so wish.” Sherlock spoke tentatively, looking concerned.
John found this task surprisingly easy to follow as Sherlock changed the subject and started to ramble about a case from last week, explaining his deductions. John was rivetted.
"You have been in the army, therefore you enjoy -- or rather require-- a semblance of control and order. This is why you insist on choosing the same side whenever you need to, namely with your girlfriends. That side has usually been the right, but since you did not really care about any of your girlfriends and would not be comfortable demanding a side from them, i will disregard that point. You have ptsd from your time as military captain, and wish to spare me from your nightmares by having the easiest access to the door and the loo. You usually sleep with your back against a wall and turned towards the door and windows, as indicated by the creases on the right side of your pajamas at Baker Street. This is because you were undoubtedly captured at some point of your army adventures and have remnants of claustrophobia. You hold a gun in your right hand and like to have it close to the drawer on your bedside table when you sleep alone. However you are left-handed despite your intermittent tremor, and your gun is in your coat, so you’d prefer to have your left hand free. You would therefore intuitively choose the left side in the configurations of this room."
Sherlock had of course run off and John ran out on the pavement but to no avail. It was pouring and John went back in the restaurant with damp hair, sending a text to Sherlock.
“I palpate the V of the thyroid cartilage at the Adam’s apple and plan my incision slightly below the cartilage. The incision is made in an area that should be slightly elastic, right there,” John continued, demonstrating as he went.
********************************************************
John just sat, fully clad, on the toilet seat. He crossed his arms and scrunched his eyes shut. What a nightmare. He pinched the bridge of his nose with his left hand.
John sighed.
There was a moment of silence where Sherlock and John just stared at each other, breathless from the stream of deductions. Just when Sherlock looked about to get embarrassed for possibly hurting John's pride, John smiled.
“I’m the one who should apologize.” John declared.
George fell like a sack of flour. Sherlock and John stood silently over the unconscious body for a few moments.
They laid his body among some empty bottles to look like he’d passed out drunk. They then scattered into the night.
“Um… Sorry about the bed being a bit not good and all but I do need to use the loo,” Sherlock rushed on, “Let’s make this simple for both of us. Drop the act. Just forget about the implications turn off the lights and go to bed. We can do the pretending to be boyfriends again first thing tomorrow at breakfast.”
Sherlock was standing by the window in the moonlight, his hand outstretched towards John as if to touch him. Or to placate him. Same thing.
John thanked the dishwasher and left the kitchen just as he saw George get up and walk through the back door. Christ! Sherlock was now out there with both suspects of a double murder!
Just as John turned around, Sherlock slipped away to the bathroom. That voice had been so soft and tender it could not have belonged to the detective. John shook his head to rid himself of the memory. Sherlock was in the bathroom brushing his teeth by the sound of it.
Sherlock took his hand and slowly kissed his knuckles.
John looked at Mycroft in the eye and nodded, determined to make things right.
“O-kay… but why was it so important we kiss?” John’s cheek was burning from the contact. He felt slapped rather than kissed. He’d imagined kissing Sherlock in many scenarios and this was disappointing in comparison, but he’d have to accept this was the best he was going to get.
Honestly when he first met Sherlock he thought Sherlock had started flirting with him. Shows how appearances can be deceiving. Sherlock was married to his work and would never be interested in him.
“That’s not what people usually say,” Sherlock’s mouth quirked into a grin.
Maria gasped a theatrical gasp, Cynthia screamed. The other medical students stood up, some rushing to the door.
Everything hurt. He was aching for some morphine. That was enough to send him to rehab if he went back to Ella.
After spouting out his deductions, Sherlock had stormed away as he usually did on crime scenes and left John to pay. The genius never ordered anything -- which grieved John – but at least John was not wasting his own hard-earned money for it. But this wasn’t any case. This case required “kissing” and “dating” if one could call it that.
They had both been through a lot and the distance between him and Sherlock sometimes felt impossible to cross, but John was proud that he had made a tentative first step in the right direction. He realized they were both staring at each other’s faces, so he coughed to clear his throat and walked toward the kitchen to make tea. Tea was always a good stand-in for normalcy in this flat.
Sherlock pulled out his laptop and plopped himself on the large bed to start researching the Nobel ceremony attendees. This case was interesting from the prestige behind the suspects. Everybody was there for a reason, be it wealth of power, wealth of intelligence or… wealth alone. Sometimes intelligence could translate to cleverness, sometimes not at all. Sherlock rolled his eyes. He really hoped they were clever.
“Is that supposed to be helpful? Or just another chance to inflate your own ego?”
John had to stifle a cough.

"Alright alright I admit, but now with Mary it'll be good, we have a very loving and committed relationship." John said defensively.
“No… I’d say it was clever of you,” Sherlock remarked.
This was Sandra’s ex.
This was surprising, not because of the doctor’s request (predictable as always), but because nobody was allowed in his office without invitation. Most meetings occurred in the lounge or tea room. The former captain had retained his courage, but must have lost his recognition of hierarchy somewhere along the line.
That sentence was familiar. John felt his stomach churn, but Sherlock merely looked at John with questioning eyes as if to say “Not good?”. John shrugged it off and focused on Sherlock.
John’s alarm clock went off at 8:30, as it did every Saturday. He allowed himself that extra hour on weekends; no more, no less. He made his bed with his usual hospital corners. He then dressed, clambered down the stairs and went to the loo.
That was when the sound of breaking glass interrupted his musings.
“Why didn’t you catch her when you were having a nice little chat in the courtyard then? She already sees you as the best of chums!” John shouted back.
However before they could get very far Dr Cynthia Jones and Dr Maria Kelley caught up with them.
“The things I do for you, you daft berk,” John conceded with rolling eyes, shoving Sherlock’s shoulder playfully.
He opened his eyes. Sherlock’s eyes were mesmerizing, a sea of blue with a constellation of islands and lagoons. They looked sorrowful, but not –as John had feared—pitying.
John groaned and gritted his teeth. It was a bit-not-good but Sherlock enjoyed sparking reactions out of John: so predictable, yet so satisfying. It was almost as good as impressing him with his deductions. He knew he had to be more careful nowadays of saying the wrong thing though, as he’d found out the hard way.
“Lestrade?”
"O-kay... Didn't know you were an expert in romance, mister know-it-all." John replied exasperated.
The anatomy teacher seemed to notice Sherlock and made a beeline to their table..
Sherlock finally came out of the bathroom to find John staring blankly at the television. John stood up suddenly, rubbing the back of his neck.
John put his hands on top of Sherlock’s on his thighs.
Sherlock turned towards John, his face looking down. He gave John a small nod. He made no move though and stood still like a marble statue.
Sherlock kissed him, right there and then.
John nodded. He knew Alicia had been a medical student and probably had consented to donate her body to science, however she had not consented to being murdered by her own teacher and her ex. They’d probably worked together on this. He wished Sherlock was there to do some deductions.
Sherlock kissed John square on the lips. John smiled a bemused smile against Sherlock’s mouth. As soon as they broke off, Sherlock charged breathless into a passionate confession.
George seemed to think up another idea. He ran behind Sherlock, wrestled his arm around his neck and pressed the knife to his throat.
“Sherlock! Hey…” John was waving a hand in front of Sherlock’s eyes, seemingly having tried to get his attention for a minute or more, “You okay?”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricothyrotomy
But once they returned to the table, an upset Cynthia was sitting alone with Sherlock nowhere to be seen.
“John I had to do what I did, Moriarty had snipers who would have shot you, Mrs Hudson and Lestrade, had I not died publicly as I did. As it kept you alive and safe, I cannot apologize for it. However, I’m sorry and deeply regret causing you grief,” Sherlock said with a penitent look away from John.
“If I help you with this, you must promise to apologize to my brother. He has not heard an apology from you for nearly beating him to death and is rightfully upset at that,” Mycroft’s said with a frown and tight lips, “Now who will be the lucky parents?”
"Ok then I keep you as best man, just out of spite!"
Sherlock was speaking to him over the haze.
John was so stunned all he could do was cup Sherlock’s face and whisper:
Good thing Sherlock had not touched him, it was Lessons on PTSD 101 to not touch a soldier in the midst of a nightmare. But John very much craved his touch right now. For reassurance, for comfort. For belonging.
Cynthia chewed her lip and muttered back, “I know. But Sherlock doesn’t strike me like the sensitive type. So I thought he would find the case interesting…”
However, John knew this could not fix everything. This was unlikely to be the last time he apologized. It was even unlikely to be the last time Sherlock apologized. Sherlock still held many secrets hidden that seemed to give him a lot of pain. He sometimes wore a look on his face that could only be described as haunted, and he had overheard Sherlock at night waking up from a fitful nightmare shouting foreign words.
“You did all of this, and that put me on the edge, so to speak. But that did not warrant the -- what I did to you in the morgue. That was cruel. You did nothing wrong. I – I hit you, Sherlock. I beat the living daylights out of you!”
They looked so soft. Surely it would not be a crime if he just touched them?
Sherlock snorted. Clearly he found that idea ridiculous.
Sherlock looked highly affronted at that, but there was a slight glimmer in his eye that showed he understood and appreciated the distraction.
“No I won’t let you go alone!” John cried out.
He looked at his bloodied hand as if in slow motion. He was panting, watching the small dent he made in the wallpaper ridges. Good thing old buildings had strong walls.
" On the cheek John, that is a romantic place, isn’t it? Not too passionate, but sweet enough to show we are tender in love."
“You faggots better tell me where Sandra is! If you do, John, I let your boyfriend go!” his arms were shaking, his eyes fearful. Sherlock had the decency to take the bored look off his face, hardened his features and gave John a solemn nod.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Sherlock could not bring himself to stand at the window and watch John.
Everybody either dead or dying. Eyes unseeing from either agony or lack of life behind them.
“That wasn’t going too well, was it? Is everything ok between you two?” Maria asked bluntly.
Sherlock bounced out of his trance with an excited the-game-is-on smile. He positively leaped down the steps towards the front door.
“Sherlock,” John started nervously before Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and put out a warding hand, forming a barrier between them, stopping John in his tracks.
“I want to, John. I want you to see,” Sherlock told him earnestly, “To see me,” Sherlock added in a whisper.
Sherlock was in danger, but John was also in danger. Both of them were with a killer. John decided he had to stay put as Sherlock was on his way to him. He would just need to be extra on guard.
"Then forget her and keep your eyes on me."
Cricothyrotomy/coniotomy is something anestesiologists love to mention but have never performed:
Sometimes Sherlock wished John could have hit just a little harder, if it meant John felt good enough to reveal some more. It was a frightening thought. But it was a thought worth considering when there was so much dullness and boredom. He could do with a smoke. Just to take off the edge. Just one…
Culverton Smith, the most abject of criminals, confessed to his victims because he enjoyed the thrilling and liberating power of confessing. Maybe John was as just as low and disgusting as Culverton. Like the final fly Jesus saw as he died on the cross. John shivered at this. Comparing Sherlock to a religious figure he was confessing to felt in no way empowering to John though, so he must have retained some sort of moral spine. After all, Culverton had no remorseful regrets while John had many.
“You mean – we…we will be sleeping in the… in the same bed?” Sherlock stuttered, “And… see each other first thing? When we wake up?”
John then let go of the arm slung around Sherlock to let his hands cup Sherlock’s face gently. Sherlock’s eyes shone in their enticing blue. He turned Sherlock’s face towards his own and kissed him.
John’s alarms started to blare. He’d wanted the first time he saw Sherlock shirtless to be in lust, but he had a strong foreboding feeling this was not what Sherlock wanted him to see tonight.
He had flinched, even at that distance from John. Even though he was in no immediate danger. Even a month after the morgue.
“I did not boil an egg, I scrambled it John. You have a preference for scrambled eggs, don’t you? Did I get it wrong?” Sherlock frowned as he placed his plate on the table.
Sherlock still was in the same position, but John noticed Sherlock’s hands were trembling where he was clenching his own thighs. John placed himself on his knees in front of Sherlock, who still had his eyes tightly shut. He looked like he was holding in a dam of emotion.
Sherlock appeared at the corner of his visual field. When John looked up the stairwell, Sherlock flinched.
“Erm—hello?” John replied, overwhelmed. Sherlock was still flitting and twirling in the kitchen making tea, as if performing some intricate dance where only he could hear the music.
John nodded with a smile. Sherlock seemed overwhelmed by emotion and to be frank, John was also having a hard time convincing himself this was reality rather than a dream.
When this was done, John slumped into a chair. The students around the theatre fell silent. Sherlock fell to his knees by John’s side with his hands hovering in the air, shaking. He took some gauze from the instrument platter and gingerly started dabbing at John’s cheek.
Gavin crossed his arms and replied:
“No, John. This is an apology for yesterday. I hope you can forgive me for making you angry. Besides John you know I don’t eat on cases,” Sherlock took a big bite of pancakes to prove his point.
Then Sherlock started to snore.
“Dead,” Sherlock responded without hesitation, “Syria.”
But he was the monster. Being a good man rather than a monster took a lot of energy and he did not have much to spare. He did not feel ready to apologize today. He would try to make Sherlock feel at bit more at ease and try again tomorrow.
“You utter madman, of course I’ll move back in ‘directly and without hesitation’!” John said in an imitation of Sherlock’s drawling voice.
“Good, thank you. May I present my boyfriend, John Watson?” Sherlock said with a sugary smile.
It was Sherlock who’d dropped the glass. A few people turned to stare, including John.
No he was not okay. But it is what it is, his mind supplied.
Sorry or the wait, I'm moving and am sitting between boxes writing this!
John bristled.
This could be all right. This was better than all right.
He had done this for Rosie, sure. But he had also done it for Sherlock.
These women were a
“I am sorry, you are so skilled at everything from surgery to crime-solving I lost my wits for a moment. What I meant to say is that I have attended several other medical courses where Dr George Sampler was the lecturer and I am very glad you have arrested him. He made some unsavory jokes which I dismissed as I thought it came from being an anatomy teacher, but they made the female students uncomfortable. But then he—he--” Cynthia stopped and seemed at loss for words, suddenly gasping for air. Maria touched her forearm lightly, lightly rubbing her thumb in small circles.
So John was back from his social interaction of the day and had not spoken to Sherlock other than give a hi, preparing tea and drinking it in silence from his chair. Sherlock observed him in equal silence.

“Oh as you know Doctor Watson, I do not have access information to how she died, according to patient secrecy. All I know is that she has signed a consent sheet before her death,” George replied smoothly.
“I should not have done that. You are worth more than this shit I gave you. I’m terribly, terribly sorry.” John said this in a subdued voice.
“Sherlock, let's take you home,” John spoke with a voice he meant to be no-nonsense, but ended up quite hesitant and weak.
Sherlock’s face seemed to shutter up into the cool, impassive wall Sherlock hid behind. John wanted to know more to better understand, wanted to argue. But he had to resign himself to the fact that Sherlock would not open up more tonight.
John looked at Sherlock with a warm smile on his face. How glad he was to have Sherlock in his life. Lestrade had come in to make the arrests, but John found that was mere details. He had only eyes for Sherlock.
She glanced up at Maria, who smiled at her and then gave her a small gentle kiss.
“You don’t have to,” John said quietly.
Sherlock sighed, feeling ashamed of his relief. His thoughts had been disorganized and chaotic all day, even after sorting and filing a few of his more pressing feelings away into his mind palace. This had been at least enough to stave off his need for cigarettes (or anything far more potent than that, if he was honest with himself) but he had been woefully bored and jittery. Mrs Hudson had offered him tea and scones on no less than three occasions, undeterred by Sherlock’s irritation.
" Oh John, does it really matter? We are just out having a good time!" Sherlock rolled his eyes with a hint of amusement.
John approached the scene cautiously. Sherlock rolled his eyes and drawled: “He’s not a killer John, look at his non-existent biceps. He knows how to handle a scalpel, but in no way a kitchen knife. Just let him go.”
Thankfully, Sherlock had thought to text John where he was. That was incredibly smart and brave of him, and John told him so. Sherlock replied with a non-committal grunt.
John whacked his head with the butt of his gun.
Sherlock seemed to have lost the ability to speak. The awe in his eyes made him look young and candid. Sherlock was blushing, actually blushing, and it looked lovely on him. John felt the love he had for Sherlock swell like an impossible golden balloon in his chest. This was meant to be. There was nothing else like this, and nothing else than this.
