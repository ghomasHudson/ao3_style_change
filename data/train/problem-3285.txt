They were in Ohio, fighting against one of the last vampires to exist on earth, they just didn’t know it yet. It was rather difficult for Cas to watch and not put himself in between the Winchesters and the fanged monsters. He just had to watch, no matter how bad it got, all he could do was watch.
"We have, and I hope that it doesn't end here"
“Dean, I’m so sorry" He didn’t know what to do or where to even stand as his face contorted with guilt and pain.
Their kiss is hungry and hot, and Dean can hardly think as he guides Castiel back into the house and to their empty bedroom.
.......
Dean can never not be fascinated by them, they’re like a thousand ravens huddled up on the man’s back, each feather smooth and glistening like silk underneath the dim lighting.
Urging me to taste it
“I was curious,” He shrugs his shoulders, his eyes peering at the ground beneath him as if he were thinking of telling Sam his real answer.
“We don’t see each other the whole day and Trainor is what you want to talk about?” Dean doesn’t mean to sound jealous, but it’s quite thickly laced in his voice making it hard for Cas not to notice.
outshining even the brightest star as I promised to be yours forever.
“I just wanted to check on you.” Sam says before Dean could even begin to express his agitation. He makes sure to keep his distance, wanting Dean to invite him over and willingly tell him what the matter is.
think about. His love for Dean runs as deep as the ocean, and as wide as the deserts.
“Are you okay, Dean?” he questioned as Dean stood to his feet, perplexed beyond comprehension. He had so much to say but where was he to start? It was all happening too fast for him to keep track of.
Miracle, could sense his sadness and it wanted nothing more than to take it away as it cuddled up against his new owner and licked his face. It brought comfort to Dean, it was the only thing that brought him comfort since Castiel died. It wasn’t the comfort and love he craved for but it numbed some of the pain and he was grateful for that, grateful that he could breathe, even when it was just for a moment. A moment felt like an eon after all.
“Let me give it to you then.” He says, surely, looking up at Castiel who has never looked as holy as he does now. There’s something gracious and enchanting about the way the florescent light casts down on him, creating the halo he’s once had permanently wrapped around his head.
There’s a soft knock on the door a few feet away from them, and when they look up, they meet Castiel’s soft blue eyes. He has a lazy smile on his face, his hair is a curly mess, and his cheeks are tinted with red.
Life and death
Dean feels his blood run cold, and his heart stops for a second or two. He gapes his eyes up at Castiel who’s still on top of him, and he wishes that he heard those words wrong— that Cas said anything, but
They stand together in peaceful silence before another person requests for Dean’s attention. He decides to leave Castiel behind this time, and watches as he saunters off to where Sam and Eileen are grilling the meat.
"You're the best thing that ever happened to me. You changed me in ways that I can't begin to explain. I've wanted to tell you these words for so long but I could never find the words, or the courage" Cas continued and Dean listened intently as his heart slammed against his chest.
“you need an ambulance. I need to call you an ambulance now!” he tried to let go but Dean wouldn’t let him, the fear of going through all of that alone was evident in his eyes and the way he pleaded. He needed someone there, to be with him as he takes his last breath.
They entered the barn they believed the vamps used as a nest and held tightly onto their machetes. The barn was big, dark and had an odd stench. It was probably old dried blood but they weren’t certain. They turned on their heels and marched forward. Their eyes darting from one end of the barn to the other.
"I know you won't let anything happen to me, and I'm grateful for that— for you..." Castiel's eyes never leaves Dean's and the grip he has around Dean's knee tightens as he tries to finish his sentence without choking up.
“How about you give me a kiss as compensation.” Dean smirks when they get to his car. They both get in and Cas doesn’t waste any more time as he hovers over the gearshift and places a soft kiss against Dean’s lips.
“You must wish that Sam had come instead of me.” Castiel speaks, his words grabbing Dean’s attention, immediately. Dean gives him a frown, a
He inches down, slowly capturing Dean’s lips as their chests press together, the skin on skin contact plus the way their hips roll together in perfect tandem making him moan against his mouth. The sound so gratifying that it almost sends Dean over the edge.
In perfect harmony
Cas didn't say anything as he watched Dean in contentment, wondering how he ever got so lucky to call this man his own. He was stupefied by his beauty and by the happiness souring through his veins that he could barely say those three words without his tongue twisting in his mouth.
Castiel can't quiet make up his mind on which jam flavor he likes best. Heck! Who's he kidding, he definitely loves them both.
He was tempted to let them know that he was there. ‘Just a little whisper’ he thought to himself. He could have done it, fast and easy and maybe Jack wouldn’t have noticed a thing. Maybe he would have been too preoccupied to even notice.
Dean talks his way out of the man’s unnecessary questions, and the second they step into that house, they feel the unnatural cold air hovering above and around them. Dean’s hand twitches and he wants to grab the shotgun hiding in his coat, but he doesn’t, he looks to Castiel who seems as calm as ever, his hands not even taut from yearning to put it around his gun. He somehow finds comfort in that, in the way Cas still carries himself like he’s not in any sort of danger.
"You could've given me a heads up"
T H E   E N D.
It’s just the two of them now, like it used to be, hands intertwined and souls interwoven, their eyes glowing with love and devotion.
Everyone stares with wide eyes, half of them—the hunters that Dean got to know along the way— didn’t ever expect something like this from him, although they were all suspicious about his relationship with Castiel, they thought it was more of a fling than anything else. They stay put and listen, though, intrigued by it all.
“I don’t think there are words to describe how you make me feel, and how much I appreciate and adore you, but I’m hoping that these three words would be a start.” He’s now at least an inch away from Castiel, and he starts to feel everything and everyone around them disappear, as if non of it mattered anymore. It doesn’t. He has everything he needs right in front of him.
"I'm grateful for knowing you. You've tought me so much, about loyalty, friendship, love—"
And engulf your sweet savory essence
“You had faith in me, and now look. I will bring paradise on earth as I have promised to do. Thank you for believing in me" and with that he disappeared again, leaving Castiel alone to watch over the earth.
Their lips meet again but this time only for a short moment when Castiel proposes heading out to their room where it’s more private and where they can get a lot more done.
The scary thing isn’t Castiel telling him that he loves him, but rather the fact that Dean still feels like he doesn’t deserve to be loved, or that he can’t possibly love another person as honestly and wholly as he wishes he could. He fears what lays beyond those words, the commitment, the promise of everlasting hope and happiness— something he’s never been able to get or give. He fears Castiel waking up one day and realising that Dean just isn’t worth anything.
“You know what? I’d just like all that crap behind me.” Dean says, placing a hand on the former angel’s thigh under the table, seeking the comfort his touch would bring him.
“Forget I said that.” Dean speaks, his words accompanied by a light chuckle.
“You were always meant to rebel, weren’t you Castiel? Maybe I could stop you but maybe I can’t because maybe, this is your destiny— to throw away everything you have just for one man” Jack spoke, his eyes locked on the angel’s. He felt sorry for him, sorry that he was so broken and that no amount of fixing and rebuilding could ever repair that tiny crack in his chassis.
Dean opens the door, and they both muster up their best smiles as they are greeted by their guests. Sam embraces Dean first, like a large puppy, and almost knocks him to the ground. They haven’t seen each other in almost a year, and Sam can’t contain how much he misses his brother.
“I hope you’re not burning them.” Cas says as he approaches, and Eileen offers a guilty shrug.
My hands are slightly wrinkled compared to yours, my years already running out before my life with you really began.
“I don’t think I can leave them behind. I don’t think I can be the angel heaven wants me to be"
I thought I saw love
I can’t stop thinking about it— about you and how we danced under the moonlight
“I’ll– I think. I should go shower too.” Castiel falters, feeling the heat rise on his cheeks, and his heart beginning to beat fast and loud against his chest.
They say there are only two certainties—
Castiel sucks in a sharp breath and Dean can tell that he’s fighting to keep his tears at bay. “I’m sorry.” Is all he can say.
"You do... and I love you Dean" Castiel admits. His hands are sweaty and shaky, he feels sick to his stomach but he also feels so much lighter too.
“Happy birthday, Dean.” He smiles as he pulls back from the hug, his smile stretching from ear to ear. He almost looks like a kid again with his eyes sparkling with glee. He turns to Castiel next and gives him a tight hug as Dean greets Eileen.
Dean gives him a smile, and nudges Castiel’s arm so he could do the same. He reaches for his identification in his jacket pocket and pulls it out, showing the man his FBI badge as he introduces himself.
Dean realises what he’s doing. He’s making excuses, stupid ones, to explain why Castiel can’t love him, but he knows better, even if he didn’t know it this morning, he definitely knows now.
The music is loud and catchy, the beat and the lyrics about being someone’s end game and first string—whatever that means— appealing to Dean, forcing him out of his seat and over to a clear space where he can move as freely as he wants. He doesn’t realize what he’s doing, if he had he wouldn’t be dancing in a room full of strangers, carefree like there’s no tomorrow. Castiel watches in complete fondness, the alcohol not working quick enough for him to join the hunter on the dancefloor.
“I can’t intervene, Cas and neither can you. You need to look at the bigger picture. Everything has it’s story and everyone has their own path, some might have longer journeys than others and that’s fine. It’s how it is and how it should be”
“Forever is a long time” you told me, but I didn’t care
Dean’s heart jumps.
I think I found the one.
Dean almost glares at him, but he gives him a questioning look instead, inclining his head, hoping Cas would catch his eyes.
Life, death and falling in love with you.
Dean urges himself not to but his mind has already started going to work, the words he wishes to say out loud forming short poetic paragraphs.
He doesn’t say a thing as he forces Castiel to climb off of him. The air around him is thickening by the second, and he can’t seem to breathe anymore. “Cas, I—” he falters, refusing to look at him while he speaks.
He looks beautiful as the florescent light creates a halo like glow above his head, putting emphasis on the fact that he’s a real life angel and that out of all the places he could be right now he chooses to be here with Dean— a mere mundane man.
“I had a stressful day,” the angel says after a while. He breaks his gaze with Dean and looks to the floor. “I’ll make myself scarce if you’re scared that I’ll embarrass you.”
He opens his mouth to say something else but nothing but air escapes, his words halted by the touch of cool and soft flesh caressing against his own. He looks down, shocked, his eyes falling on Dean’s hand wrapping itself around Castiel’s.
He can’t find his gun anymore, and when the ghost appears in front of him once more, he feels the air begin to leave his body. Castiel's eyes widen, and they start to look for the shotgun but before he does, David catches him off guard and shatters a glass vase over his head. If it were any other day, he’d let himself fall to the floor and writhe in pain, but not today, not when he’s sure he can still feel the last bit of grace flowing around in him, not when Dean is being killed right in front of his eyes.
His pulse soon steadies and his heartbeat slows, going back to normal as he grows tired, the sound of his angel's faint breaths lulling him into a deep and peaceful slumber.
The hours pass like minutes and before they know it, they’re back out on the field, working their asses off to solve this daunting case. They had to split up for a few hours, Cas needed to follow detective Trainor and his leads, while Dean had to speak to the victims’ parents, and everyone he was close with. It felt tedious, not being near each other never bothered either of them as much as it did now.
“Well, you did.” Dean says to him, though he wished he’d kept it to himself.
“You’re not even listening.” Dean calls him out, throwing his shirt in Castiel’s face to grab his attention. There’s a tint of red on Dean’s cheeks because he couldn’t help but notice Castiel’s eyes scanning his bare torso as he spoke.
And as I lay here watching you, trying to take note of every possible change your body has gone through,
Dean swallowed hard. Seeing that chair occupied by someone other than the angel was like having his heart sawed out with a butter knife. He couldn’t endure it, not even a second of it.
Like a baby taking it’s first steps, Castiel spoke reluctantly. He was not sure what he would sound like, if his new voice was different from the last but it wasn’t. It sounded the same and every inch of him looked the same.
He watched the earth go round, the mountains slowly crumbling, the sea washing over cities and men commit the ultimate crime, it was almost like he was right back where he started— just an angel observing human activity.
They kissed, slowly and so passionately that it felt like what people described complete euphoria to feel like. It was actually better than that but neither of them could find the words to describe it. All they could do was show it, and so they did from that day on till the end of their endless journey.
“Oh, I know. We drank together after all.”
He lets out a soft moan, a cry, feeling Dean swell against his own shaft as his legs wrap around Castiel's waist. “I need more.” He doesn’t mean to sound greedy. He opens his eyes and pulls away from the kiss just to see Dean’s reaction, to see if he’s curling his nose in disgust, but all that’s on Dean’s face is a certainty and a hunger Castiel had never seen him show before.
"...If you think I'm ever letting you out of my sight then you don't know me." They're not any better than the first sentence he wanted to pour out but at least they don't indicate that he wants to sleep with his best friend.
His fingers gently caresses each curve of Castiel’s wings, their feathery texture soft and ticklish against his rough hands. He smiles, in awe and admiration as his long fingers trickle down from the blanket of feathers to the angel's back, the sudden change of texture sending chills  down Dean's spine.
“He fell off a cliff, tumbled down almost twenty feet. By the time he got to solid ground, he was…” Sam says over the phone, he’s on loudspeaker and as he explains what happened to Marcus Strand a year ago, Castiel picks up on Jack’s voice in the background, singing while he imagined his fingers to be pulling at the strings on Dean’s guitar.
Dean’s machete made a clean cut and with a thud, one of the vampire’s heads landed on the ground. They had it under control, but again, only for a moment. The monsters were suddenly coming out of nowhere. Dean took care of two, Sam took on the other three— two in time and one too late.
“No sulfur, no signs of ghosts, no bite marks or scratch wounds on the victims, no damn detection of anything we’ve ever dealt with in the past,” Castiel begins again, voicing the concerns Dean has had for the last couple of days. They’re on the crime scene, surrounded by the local police, CSI, and a
It’s the way you told me you loved me, making me come undone
There's a very pregnant pause after Dean's words and neither one of them can find it in them to speak now. Not that they want to break the silence, it's comfortable with just a pinch of sexual tention in the air but they dwell on it, making no effort to break it just yet.
"Bullshit, Cas. You're not an angel anymore. You get stabbed, you die! And right now there's about more than a dozen of those feathered fuckers itching to put a blade through your heart so I'm sorry if I'm being overprotective but I'm not watching you die... not again"
Castiel thinks it's sweet and Dean can't manage to hide the blush on his face.
Dean lifts his hand and traces a finger over Castiel’s bare arm until he reaches his collarbone. His finger hovers in the same spot for a while before he flattens his hand against Castiel’s chest, feeling his skin become taut from under his touch.
Dean’s hand lingers on Castiel’s face for a while and if it weren’t for the noise around them— a reminder that they’re not the only two beings on the planet let alone this diner, his hand would’ve stayed longer. He pulls away, and as if missing a peace of himself, Castiel’s heart shatters at the loss of contact.
Their foreheads are covered with beads of sweat as they lay quietly underneath the white linen sheets, their bodies tangled together. Dean’s chest heaves as he tries to regain his composure, the angel’s head rising and falling along with it, his head pressed so tightly against the hunter’s that he could feel the way his heart beats.
“Pizza, movie, sleep.” Castiel dots down their tasks for the night, letting Dean know that he’s onboard with it all.
They reached Canton in about 15 hours and camped up at a cheap motel. It felt strange for the both of them, the feeling of them doing it one last time was bittersweet. They always hated these motels, the cheap food and the long hours on the road but now that it was their last, they already missed it. They have bonded greatly over the years, the days on the road played a pivotal part in their relationship and now it was slowly turning into nothing but memories. It was a big step for them to take, having counted and leaned on each other each day to going their separate ways was tough as nails, but it needed to be done. They had to break up the band and work on their solo projects.
Dean let go and they both looked to Sam, a petrified one. He still hadn’t processed his brother slipping away a few moments ago. It was beyond traumatizing and not even Castiel’s appearance could shake it right away.
“you should get back to Eileen. I’m sure she’s waiting for you"
“My god. It’s been a while.” Sam says after pulling away, and he finds himself looking around, curious to see if their old Kansan home looked any way close to the way it was when their mother had been alive. It does, but it’s different too— brighter, with a big promise of hope and happiness.
He draws in a breath, it’s heavy and it wavers as though he’s being ripped apart from the inside this very moment. He doesn’t look it. He rather looks tired than anything else, and it is why Sam frowns at him and peers at his blue eyes as if trying to read them, desperate to figure out what the matter is.
“Jack, are you God?”
“I don’t know how you two did it.” A smile forms on detective Trainor's face, and his eyes beam with a newfound respect for them.
There was light all around him, his eyes burning as he peered into it. It was painful and he felt it tear off layers and layers of his skin until there was nothing but his grace left. The ball of energy hovering in all it’s broken glory, following the path the white light lead him to. It was instinct. He had no idea what was happening and where he was going but he went, unable to resist the demand.
“Dean, I’m so sorry,” Castiel’s eyes glisten and the guilt is clearly laced in his tone. He sits up and rakes his fingers through his hair, “it just came out. I didn’t mean to burden you with this.” He adds, panic flushing through him.
“And I you.” Cas returns it without a second thought.
“I love you too, Cas. So damn much" it felt good to say and for Cas, it was the best thing he had ever heard. It brought tears to his eyes as he let Dean cup his face and kiss him.
I want to kiss every inch of you
“You’ve got new freckles.” Cas ignores his words completely as he looks to the side of Dean’s ribs and his breasts that has been etched with more than a dozen new tan dots. They look quite beautiful, and if he were brave, he’d ask to touch them.
“Uh, wait. I’m not done— sorry.” He says awkwardly and lets out a laugh. No one minds, honestly, Dean just talking can be quite entertaining.
“Cas, I love you. God, I fucking love you so much that it hurts. I know I probably don’t deserve to even hold you right now, but It’s all I want to do, and I will do it, all of it, for as long as you’ll let me.” Like a heavy cloud lifted off his shoulders, Dean feels the relief, the happiness, and pride in saying these words to Castiel. He can feel the tears threaten to fall, but for the first time in his adult life, he lets them flow like they’re supposed to.
They got used to it. Of course, they got used to it. Eventually, it just became one of Cas’s many little quirks. Cas didn’t get movie references. Cas took things too literally. Cas had a problem with personal space. Cas had a thing about staring.
“I’d very much like to kiss you, Dean. If you would allow me to.”
When he does, he notices multiple things at once.
Dean was going to have to get used to that because it was a damn headrush, feeling Cas’s soul in his hands. And she was so
Yeah, they could do a hell of a lot better when it came to being happy. They would. Dean was sure of it.
A voice whispered in Dean’s head. Maybe it was better that Ezekiel made them kick Cas out. Because despite his dirty clothes and the fact that Cas needed to breathe now…he’d get his grace back eventually. He wasn’t human. He didn’t have a daemon.
“Dean wait,” Sara’s voice was deep, calming. Hagar felt immediately put at ease by it, and then reprimanded herself. No human, nor daemon, should be able to affect how she felt. She shouldn’t feel at all. She was a weapon, not built out of the same things humans daemons were built out of.
-///-
Finally, Cas sighed, his expression morphing into a gentle smile as he met Jack’s eyes, “but it is not something I dwell on. I do not have my own daemon, but I have Wendy, and Quin and Abigail, and I have you and Dean and Sam to keep me company and act as my family. I do not need anything else.”
he can see Quin perk her ears up, staring at what would be a taboo had it been anyone but Cas’s Son’s daemon touching him.
He didn’t.
he’s still human.
So Sara leaned forward and nosed at them.
Around them, something dark and ominous began to encourage. Which was bizarre, because
He wouldn’t have stayed.
he realised that there was going to have to be some kind of speech involved before they could reach the Happy Ever After bit? Dean was an idiot. No, worse than an idiot. He was stupid, stupid, stupid—
Was the silence getting louder? Pulsing? Was that a thing it could do?
Dean snorted, “at least you’re politer than Cas.”
about that now. No taboo subjects. Just them. “One moment of true happiness, or something like that.”
Dean can feel her eyes on him as she trots behind him, following him to prepare Cas’s body. His hand still hurts from where she bit him. Dean remembers, briefly, that Cas once said he didn’t need a daemon because he had all of them. Because he had
“We love you,” Quin spoke up before Dean could gather his thoughts together. Apparently, she thought he was taking too long. He shot her a glare but found only smugness staring back at him. She was lucky that he loved her.
– into one of those crushing bear hugs.
She blinks up at him, tilting her head in a way which is so, so
his own fears? His own want to leave? Or something more sinister? It would be nice if it was the latter, but Dean wasn’t sure it was.
“Hello, Quin,” Castiel addresses her a while later, and there’s a small smile on his face.
Once, Castiel was the Angel of Thursday, a Warrior of the Heavenly Host. Now, he is a father to a boy with all the powers of the divine surging through his tiny body.
“This can’t be the end,” Dean murmured, “this can’t be. We have to get him back, Quin. He’s got to come back.”
“There is no need to worry, Castiel. Amara is at peace and so am I. As long as we live together in perfect harmony, the world will be at peace— complete peace"
Dean is seated right beside Castiel. His hand very often and unconsciously sliding up and down his thigh as he speaks with his mouth full of the chewy candy.  Sam catches him in the act several times but doesn’t say anything, he doesn’t need to. It all feels perfectly natural, like it’s meant to be, so he keeps quiet and listens to his brother talk about how much he already misses the beach.
means.
White fibers of wool were found in the tracks left behind by size 10 combat boots, and as Cas eyes the carpet, he is sure that there’s where they came from.
It’s sitting right in front of me
“Dean"  he almost pushed Sam away as he grabbed onto the dying man. His heart broke as he saw the fear in Dean’s eyes, the fear that he might not even make it to heaven, that after how much he gave into trying to move on and trying to heal from his past and trauma, it meant nothing in the end, it meant that he’d die, that he’d get washed back into the ocean just as he reached the shore.
Slice!
The floor cracked somewhere behind him, and if he weren’t a trained and excellent hunter, Celine Strand’s quick and quiet movements would have taken him by surprise, but just as she swung an axe in his direction, he managed to duck and watch it go through the wooden door instead. Her eyes flared with panic, and she wanted to run, to scream, to cry and say that she didn’t mean it, but she stood there frozen instead.
Forever isn’t as long as you made it out to be.
I thought I saw love.
“Castiel, baby. You have been my rock for as long as I’ve known you, you’ve always been there for me even during my darkest days, and I can’t thank you enough for it all.” He begins as he slowly walks to the back, his eyes never leaving Castiel’s.
"You love me?" Dean puts emphasis on the word love, not wanting to take Castiel's words out of context. There's absolutely no room for that.
“I’ll call this in and wait for Trainor to come. You get the kids.” Cas says and before Dean could run off, he pulls him back by the wrist and tells him. “Be safe. I love you.”
“I know I’m not a good hunter, and I know that if I weren’t here adding onto your stress, you’d have found the killer already.” He berates himself, eyes refusing to meet Dean’s.
“Couldn’t you make an exception for me?” the angel walked beside the new God, the God that he help raised. He looked at him and he still saw Jack, his son, no matter how different he was.
“Okay, I’ll be there in jiff,” Dean says, and as if Cas can tell that he’s not done speaking, he keeps the phone by his ear, breathing into the speaker to let Dean know that he’s listening. “I miss you.” The words finally come, and even if Cas tried to hide it from Trainor, he knew he wouldn’t be able to suppress the smile that Dean had put on his face.
Eileen appears and takes a seat near Castiel as she signs something about how Charlie can’t get enough of playing with Jack. Dean signs back, slowly and carefully, not wanting to say the wrong thing like he always used to when he first started learning ASL. She chortles at his response and both Dean and Castiel joins her in laughter a second later.
“I’m hurt"
“We’re at a crime scene in the middle of a murder investigation and you two are bringing your marital problems to work? As if we haven’t got enough on our plates already.” Exasperation comes from him like breath from a newborn’s mouth.
Dean rises at some point too, and he strides towards Castiel, who may or may not have drank one too many glasses of whiskey in the name of relieving the stress.
“Your guests are starting to arrive.” He says to Dean as he leans against the threshold as though his feet aren’t able to carry his own weight. Sam stands to his feet first and heads out the same way he came in, passing Castiel on the way, and not missing the stench of whiskey in his breath.
I think I found my destiny
“It hardly looks like our old home.” Sam continues as he turns around to face Cas who has followed him through the corridor instead of upstairs where Dean and Eileen are now.
He licks his lips as Castiel locks the door behind them before turning to face him again. His heart thuds loud against his chest, and the excitement brews in his belly as the angel pushes him down onto their bed. He falls back with ease, almost eagerly, and sucks in a breath when he feels Castiel’s hand cup around his growing erection.
“I really hope you can forgive me, Cas.” They’re still outside, surrounded by flickering lights, as Dean speaks with that kicked puppy look on his face.
The way you kissed me there and asked me to take your hand
, he thinks to himself, but he couldn’t dare say it out loud, especially not when Cas has his piercing eyes fixed on him like he’s trying to look right into his soul. For all Dean knows, he'd done it before, and he’s doing it right now.
Perhaps things would be easier for them both if they tackled their guests separately, but Dean refuses to even lose sight of Castiel as he snakes an arm around him, making sure he’s close as he starts chatting with his other friends whom they both haven’t seen in ages.
He puts his hand on Dean’s chest and caresses his soft skin, feeling his smooth chest swell beneath his touch, his heart beating so fast that it scares Castiel for a second.
Dean turns his gaze from his brother and takes a second to wonder if Cas had given them away, if he told Sam about what he said this morning. It’s possible, but Dean knows that no matter what hell Castiel goes through, he’d suffer it alone if it meant keeping Dean’s secret safe. His lips almost twist up with gratitude, but they stop somewhere in the middle of it, realising the pain that Cas must be going through right now.
“You didn’t have to"
As if sent by the universe, there’s three knocks on the front door. They know who they belong to, so they fix themselves up and get dressed as quickly as possible before heading downstairs.
“I guess, he’s worried about you, and so am I. You hardly said a word to anyone today.” Sam says, still standing in place.
He stops himself halfway through then decides to test the waters. “There’s Cas, and we’ve both seen how much he can love, how much he cares and—”
Cas doesn’t deny it, but he doesn’t speak about it either, knowing that Dean wouldn’t want anyone knowing about it.
feet in the sand as the waves collided and crashed before us.
The night flies by quickly, and by the time the clock hits 12am, Dean gets ready to give a small speech and greet everyone goodnight.
“I didn’t get to say it back" he began. His hands cupping Castiel’s face.
“I’m sure there’s plenty of space for you two to crash here for the night.” Dean says after Charlie tells him that she wouldn’t be able to drink much being the designated driver and all.
About a few hours have passed and Dean has disappeared to the garage where he’s trying to distract himself by cleaning the place up and giving his Chevy a wash. He finishes up sooner than expected and he lets out a frustrated groan as his eyes peer to the watch on his wrist. It’s 5pm and his guests are arriving only at 6pm.
Detective Trainor doesn’t say a word, just gives them a nod and steps away from them to continue his search for any possible clues he and everyone else might have missed.
“Talk!” Castiel demands and then watches as he pulls a simple black necklace over his head and fiddles with the dove pendant on it, as if saying his last goodbye. He hesitates, but eventually hands it over to Dean who burns it right when the ghost appears again.
“Nah, I’m not hungry" He glanced at Sam for just a split of a second before looking back at miracle who’s tongue was hanging from the side of his mouth. It was cute and it brought a smile to Dean’s face.
Cas eventually lets him go and allows him to embrace Dean as well.
Dean quickly pulls away, his lips swollen and his cheeks red as he looks down at his one-button-less shirt. He doesn’t complain though, Castiel could ruin his whole outfit for all he cares.
“I don’t understand, why does the FBI care about my son’s death?” The man’s bottom lip quivers, along with his hands and his legs. He looks guilty, without a doubt, but they can’t act without being 100% certain.
Castiel releases a muffled moan against Dean’s mouth as he feels his hair being tugged on, the light sting making him crave for even more. He moves his hands up and down Dean’s chiseled torso and tugs onto his shirt so vigorously that one of the buttons snap.
He smiles, looking at everyone and then looking back at Castiel who can’t seem to hide the blush on his cheeks.
Sam watched in anticipation, a proud smile forming on his face.
Castiel was perplexed yet amused by the way his blood rushed through his body as the hunter swung him around like a feather. It was exhilarating and the feeling of being manhandled felt strange yet oddly exciting to the angel. He felt small but not in a bad way, he rather felt fragile, like a bunny up against a wolf that wouldn’t dare hurt him. No one, not a single soul, has ever made him feel that way, and in all honesty he wasn’t complaining that Dean was the one to bring out his submissive streak. Dean was, after all, his first of many.
Castiel doesn't say anything after that. He doesn't know what to say actually. All he can really think about is the feel of Dean's lips against his own. He feels terrible for letting his horniness overcome his whole body like this especially given the fact that he's having these feelings for his probably straight and definitely not into him  best friend.
“Why are you pushing this? No person could do this, Cas!” Dean’s voice distracts him from his thoughts, and he looks up at him, wishing that he’d just stop for a second and see the hurt in his eyes. That he’d maybe pull Castiel close and wrap his arms around him.
“I can tell.” Sam doesn’t say anything about the pictures, not exactly sure where to begin.
Why did Castiel have to confess today out of all days? How selfish of him to do it on Dean’s birthday, now there’s no way of moving forward if Dean doesn’t repeat those words right this instant.
He does just that, stroking Dean’s cock as he starts to kiss and suck onto Dean’s jaw, moving down to his throat and then his collarbone, tainting his skin with purple bruises. Dean’s moans are messy and loud, and they become worse when Castiel pushes himself inside of him, fucking him nice and slow.
They exchange smiles and hugs, and Castiel makes a comment on how beautifully Eileen’s skin is glowing. She’s four months pregnant, her belly small— barely noticeable but Sam can’t seem to keep his hands off of her, gushing about how fast the baby’s growing. The excitement clear as day in his eyes.
“What’s the point in all this if you’re not going to celebrate with me?” he says softly, and even though he starts to hear his guests’ voices, and the music getting louder, he doesn’t want to leave without making at least one thing clear to his boyfriend.
“How can a dead kid be a suspect?” Detective Trainor gives his famous scowl and Dean replies with rolling his eyes.
I said I missed the beach but I lied
It’s calling
Dean agrees eagerly, nodding like a child with a wide grin plastered on his face.
It must be the Florida air, Jack thinks but Sam and Eileen knows exactly what it is.
The hand resting on Dean's knee jerks away so rapidly almost as if it got burned. The tears brimming the boarders of Castiel's eyes are evident and he doesn't try hiding his heartache. He couldn't even if he tried. His world has shattered and his biggest fear has just taken it's first breath. He suddenly tastes the PB&J sandwich he had earlier and luckily he spots the trashcan near Dean's desk right on time. Now not only does he feel embarrassed for being so naive but he feels embarrassed for being so affected by Dean's words that it caused him to barf out his whole lumch.
And in that moment Dean feels like a proud father watching his son grow up to be the man he always wanted him to be. He couldn’t have imagined this in a million years and yet here they are. His heart swollen fat with gratitude as he takes it all in.
His lips are covered with barbecue sauce as he munches onto a double cheese burger for the first time. His eyes are big and innocent, the color blue so perfect in them as if it was only made for him. His hair is disheveled, sticking out in all directions and even though he looks quite a mess, Dean still thinks he’s the most stunning character he’s ever come across.
“I love them,” Cas interjects, his words as sure as the first ones he’d offered to his fellow angels after rebuilding Dean with his own two hands.
“No!” he interjected. He turned from the scene before him to look at Jack. “I am not going to let him die. Not after everything he had been through, not after everything he had sacrificed to finally live the life he deserves" he added, anger clearly laced in his tone.
Yes, Cas, there are other rooms but I want you to sleep in here. With me. These words don't make it out of the comforts of Dean's head and he tries to find something less homoerotic to say to Castiel.
Each and everyone has their own destiny
“It won’t happen again.” Castiel humbly apologizes for the both of them because he knows that Dean wouldn’t dare give the other man the satisfaction of knowing he’d scolded them and gotten away with it.
Dean’s chewing stops, and his loud breathing becomes even as time passes by. He’s asleep.
There was nothing but blackness, so deep and so dark that it felt endless. Along with it was pain, sorrow and regret amplified by a thousand. It felt worse than hell, far worse and Castiel couldn’t believe that he was back there. He felt almost regretful of his last choices as a living being but he knew that if given the chance he would have done it all over again, without hesitation. There was no question to what lengths he would go to save Dean Winchester. He was always willing to put the hunter’s life before his own, believing that it was his destiny, that it always was and always will be.
Next to Jack, Cas was there too, smiling at his son (God, Cas had a
And the fourth is that – if Quin and Abigail are on the other side of the room – then that’s not who he’s holding.
She doesn’t.
He’d expected it to be too hot and too dirty and too loud. He’d expected it to be some sort of hostile landscape that would trip him up on branches if he wasn’t careful.
“Is that all you’re here for? ‘Cos I gotta be honest, I’m running low on shut-eye as it is,” Dean’s words were dismissive, but he was staring at her quizzically as if trying to figure her out. She wondered if he might let her in on whatever he found; she had struggled to place herself too as of late.
Jack’s question though, disrupted the calm.
It was one of those moments that made Dean feel like he was floating. They were sat around in the library of the bunker. Sam and Dean both had a drink on the go, their daemons curled up together on the floor like they used to back when they were kids who could only find comfort in each other. Meanwhile, Jack’s daemon – currently a hummingbird - was flittering in between his fingers, playful, her feathers iridescent in the low lighting.
But jeez, it was so
He started singing, eventually and it wasn’t long before Quin joined in beside him to harmonize.
And now, here they were.
Hagar ruffled the flames of her feathers, drew herself to her full height, “I am Hagar. I am Castiel’s right hand.” The showmanship of her introduction was somewhat dampened by the fact that she couldn’t stop squinting at the daemon who had recognised her without a thought.
” he breathes. Because that’s who this is, in his hands. Cas didn’t have a daemon when he became human before, but now? Now he does. Now he’s sacrificed his grace to the empty – it’s gone for good – and in return, apparently, he’s got his own daemon.
And it was also, incidentally, the first time a human daemon had ever touched an angelic one.
One step in front of the other. That’s what he’d been doing for the last four months anyway. Just one step in front of the other, until his steps led him to Cas.
He blinks, shifts, turns on the bedside light. The soft glow illuminates the bedroom; shedding light on a couple of stuffed toys Jack left in there throughout the day and the trench coat hung on the back of the door. There’s no threat, no monster, no manic with a gun. There’s just…this. The stupid domestic turn his life has taken.
Sara’s ears had perked up again, her tongue slightly lolling out of her mouth. Hagar tried not to feel warm at the obvious display of happiness from Dean’s daemon, even if the man himself looked mildly uncomfortable.
) and seeming content to enjoy the moment without anything to keep him busy.
“I like her too, you know, Cas,” Dean murmured, in prayer, “I just pretend I don’t. But she’s actually alright. We get you out of here, you can listen to her 24/7. I won’t say a damn thing to object,” fuck he just wanted to get Cas and get
Hagar was not trying to be polite, only truthful, but she let it slide without comment. She should not be so affected by humans as to find meeting them a nicety, let alone letting them in on the fact.
-///-
Which was easier said than done because there was
And so Cas had died, thinking he was unloved.
“Get the pyre ready,” Dean grunts, finally, because there’s nothing else he can say.
-///-
It takes him a moment to place what woke him up at all.
“Not my name,” Castiel’s daemon quips, “but yes. I am Castiel’s, I believe.” She hopped around, turning to face an open-mouthed Sam, Cas, Abigail and Quin. “Hello.”
He’d been waiting to see if Cas had a daemon.
Because if Dean’s ever had a blessing in his life, it takes the form of this idiot angel next to him.
– really had died with him, gone up in dust never to return.
Castiel snorts, and it’s a reaction he definitely inherited from Dean. It makes Dean feel warm all over. “You’re insufferable,” Cas says, fondness in his tone.
“Yeah? That what you were doing, huh? Praying?” Seems a bit redundant, now, when the only people worth praying to are a) Cas himself and b) the baby in the crib.
The second is Cas himself, looking shaken, but there. Alive. Breathing.
“Yeah. Well. Hi,” Dean finally replied after a moment of prolonged silence, dropping the gun onto the bedspread beside him. His hand did not leave Sara’s fur.
He’s hearing
it’s him. There are few other people who can move him to tears so easily, after all, even with the aid of supernatural singing abilities.
He’s grown up facing the supernatural. And this sort of thing? It can’t be ignored. Yeah, maybe it
And there’s no reason why Dean should assume that it’s him, except
He blinks and lowers his gaze to the being in his hands.
Coming back through the portal feels like someone is ripping Dean’s own skin off.
“How will we find him?” Quin’s voice too, despite the whisper, seemed like the only thing in the whole universe.
“I know you are conflicted about what heaven has asked of you and your brother recently,” Hagar spoke, and though she was looking at Dean, she was speaking to both of them. The words poured out, unbidden, to this stranger, this human, this small inconsequential soul who she could not deny her pull towards. “You have followed orders before, but that was from your father, and upon the death of your brother, you began to wonder if even those orders were meaningful.” These were the facts she knew about Dean Winchester’s life. She knew them as if she had been there. She knew them intimately, because she knew
He’d sort of expected it to be like purgatory; monsters and trees and fighting for his damn life to get to Cas and
She takes one look back at Dean, leans down to affectionately peck his finger and then flies and finds perch on Cas’s shoulder.
“What’s poetic?” Quin was asking, pulling Dean out of his thoughts.
Through all of it, Dean had been waiting. Or—well, maybe waiting wasn’t the right word. He had been patient about it, and happy to go along with the ‘We-Got-Cas-Out’ party. But he knew that they had a hell of a lot to talk about when they were finally alone, and Dean could feel the words on the tip of his tongue the whole night. Ready. Waiting.
Dean wondered if Wendy would ever settle or if Nephilim daemons got to choose not to. There was so much they didn’t know about Jack’s kind, particularly considering the fact that Heaven had a blanket policy on killing them before they reached puberty. Dean sort of hoped she never did. There was an innocence that watching her shift brought into their lives, and innocence was in poor supply, these days.
“Look, Cas,” he took a deep breath, “me and Quin got in here, but it’s like purgatory, right? It’ll be pretty damn hard to get you out, cos you ain’t human. Even more so, ‘cos you belong here.”
So fuck knows why he’s awake at two in the morning when he can’t hear a baby crying.
“I could hear you,” Dean finally breaks the silence as he pours the water in, watching it turn dark from the teabag.
But this one is. And he sings with the voice of the heavenly host, with all the power of the divine, for the ones he loves.
Now he protects the needy.
“Yeah,” Dean murmurs. “Yeah.”
“—you gotta get rid of your grace. You’ve got to let the empty have it.”
Quin yipped beside him.
On the floor, Abigail raised her head slightly, in curiosity, mirroring the way Sam swayed slightly forward, pretending to not be as interested as he likely was. Wendy landed on the table, shifting into a cat as she did, Jack’s fingers immediately finding purchase in her fur. Everyone was staring at Cas, except Quin who seemed content to continue to doze. Maybe she already knew the answer. Maybe that was one of the many things she and Cas used to talk about under the cover of darkness all those years ago.
“Did you know?” he asks Quin, after what could have been hours just standing there. Time feels weird, like it’s slowed down and sped up all at once.
Dean had a sudden, awful feeling that Cas’s confession wasn’t what he’d thought it was, that he was misremembering somehow…
-///-
“Will you do it again? Sing, I mean.” Dean asks, much later. His limbs are entwined with Cas’s to the point where he is not sure where he ends and Cas begins. It is a glorious feeling.
“Thought humans couldn’t hear your true voice,” Dean finally murmurs. He’s under no illusion that his words alert Cas to his presence. Cas is more aware of his surroundings than Dean is, and considering Dean’s upbring, that’s saying something.
Okay.
noise, but it gets…clearer, as Dean clears the corridor, peeking into various rooms. He’s already making a b-line towards Jacks, but he stops to peek his head into Sam and Eileen’s and all he finds is his brother snoring (Sam’s lucky Eileen can’t hear that, or she’d probably kick him out).
And that daemon is sat in Dean’s hands like it’s the most natural thing in the world.
He wasn’t leaving without Cas and that was final.
“Okay, it’s okay, I’m here.” Dean murmured, “don’t panic. We’re gonna get you out, alright?” he began emptying his pockets onto a floor that wasn’t there.
Dean pulls back from the wall and nods.
Of course, she sobered immediately afterwards.
“Occasionally, when I see the bonds that you all have with your daemons…yes. It can be.” Castiel glanced towards Abigail and Quin curled together on the floor, back to Wendy sat staring at him on the table. For a moment, such grief and longing clouded Cas’s face that Dean wanted to…do something. Reach out. Comfort.
Except it sorta still is the end of the world because Cas is gone. And everything he said is still ringing in Dean’s ears like static, blocking everything else out.
Quin lifted herself up, finally. Dean could feel the effort it cost her, her muscles weighed down by exhaustion and sadness. She looks up at him, bright eyes shining. “Then we better get to work,” she says, “because if Cas can annoy a cosmic entity so much it lets him go, we can do the same. We’re practically made for it.”
“I won’t be chased away,” Dean gritted his teeth, uncertain if he was talking to himself or not.
Castiel shakes his head, lifts his cup to his lips to take a sip, “not quite. I was…singing, to him. The first songs ever uttered, the prayers for a peaceful world and protected souls.”
He pulled it away, biting at his lower lip. He felt like he was blushing. Was he blushing? That was ridiculous, he hadn’t blushed since he was a teenager and he’d put on those pink panties with the lace and—
Angels were not made to be gentle.
The baby in Castiel’s arms is proof of that; folded up neatly in a badly knitted yellow blanket.
“It was beautiful,” Dean is getting better at this, the whole complimenting Cas sincerely thing. He’s probably never going to be as good as Cas is, but he’s trying and Cas isn’t complaining, so he figures that’s a start at the very least.
-///-
“It is nice to meet you too, Abigail,” Cas’s Daemon – his
Castiel rolled his eyes, “You can’t be jealous of your own daemon, Dean. She
Dean woke up to a bird in his hair, and Cas stroking his hand through Quin’s fur beside him.
Quin raised her head, doing her best not to nudge the robin off her as she pressed herself to Cas’s thigh.
“Well, we’re here now,” Dean murmured. His voice echoed in the vastness of space, too loud, too loud, too loud.
Quin shivers. She’s curled up on his feet, and he knows she’s just as miserable as he is. “I think we both knew,” she murmured.
Hagar almost wanted to laugh at the reaction. She let out something of an amused huff.
“Isn’t it lonely?”
“They are divine flames. They will not burn you.”
“Hello, Castiel,” she says, solemnly, “I am sorry for the loss of your – our – grace.”
“I’m gonna walk this damn place for all eternity before I give up,” he said, out loud, mostly because then at least he’d be able to hear his own voice. It was still disconcertingly loud, but he took comfort in it this time.
insufferable since you figured that out,” Castiel says, but he’s laughing, and Dean is too, quietly, because Jack’s hearing is far too perfect for his own good, but still.
And now here they are. End of the world, except not, because now Jack and Wendy, Cas’s son – no,
Cas didn’t have a daemon.
“So we gotta make it so you don’t belong here. Dude, I don’t wanna ask but—”
And then he realised his hand was still over Cas’s mouth.
It’s later – a lot later – that they find themselves in Dean’s room. Quin and Doretha (as Cas christened the little Robin a few hours back; “
Quiet fills the space between them, comfortable and poignant until they are ready to retreat back to the bedroom.
The wall in front of them where Cas disappeared – was taken – after admitting that he fucking
He’d been expecting to run into Cas; trench coat, dark hair, same Cas from when he’d been pulled from Dean in the bunker.

you, in every way that counts. I bonded with her more quickly because I held your soul in my hands when I pulled you from hell. She recognised me easier than you did.”
– quips with the utmost sincerity. She still hasn’t left Dean’s hand.
They were speaking in hushed murmurs again, just like they used to.
What was unexpected then, was Sara’s reaction.
But that has to come later.
The kitchen lights feel a tad too bright, but Dean’s used to bad lighting (motels weren’t exactly known for having great light fixtures, particularly the don’t-ask-don’t-tell sort they used to frequent), so it’s okay. He puts the kettle on, finds Cas’s mug with the painted bee’s on the side of it.
Dean knows there are parts of Cas that he might never access, and it tears him up sometimes. So getting this little piece of him…
“Yeah? Pretty sure I’m the guy you love most in the whole damn world,” Dean countered, cheeky, incredulous that he could
Castiel shakes his head slowly, “a miracle,” he decides. Dean’s never much believed in miracles – there’s always some hidden cost – but watching the way Jack happily sits in the park and pets the ducks that flock to him even when he doesn’t have bread, makes him think that maybe things have changed. Maybe God needed the innocence of a kid all along. Maybe that’s all miracles really are; little pieces of innocence; of a child who is also God shining big blue eyes at the world around him.
Nobody has to tell him who this is.
For them, it did.
That night, when Cas had disappeared from their lives once more, Dean held Quin tightly in his arms and told himself over and over that neither of them were crying.

There was a lot to do before. There was greeting Sam and Abigail and Eileen and her daemon Roger. There was seeing Jack again, and Wendy’s excitement as she flew in the air above their heads with Doretha. There was a big family meal, and plenty of hugs, and drinks.
-///-
“It didn’t hurt. I mean, it was sort of an emotional roller-coaster, but my ears are intact,” Dean shrugs. There was a time he might have been worried about
It wasn’t the wings, shadowed and silhouetted against the doors. It wasn’t the sparks of light falling down around them. It wasn’t the fact that all their gunshots didn’t slow him for a moment, or the fact that the wind was rattling and howling more than any storm Dean had experienced in his life.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel takes his hand, begins to trace absent patterns on it.
Some part of them had known – had known that they felt the same way too, since Cas was killed by Lucifer – and they’d done nothing about it. They hadn’t even done something when Cas had been confessing in front of them.
here was dark and ominous because everything was nothing. But this…this felt worse. There was a rumble, like Dean might lose his footing and fall forever.
“It’s serious, dude. If you’re feeling that unstable—”
Maybe when Cas died, a part of her – a part of
Instead, she took a deep breath and let it happen. Sara’s nose was wet, but her eyes were wide and blue, and there was – in her gaze – not quite wonder, but something that might be…kinship. More kinship than Hagar had ever felt towards other angels.
“Please, Quin,” Dean begs because if she keeps this up he knows he’ll fold. He’ll lay down on the floor next to Cas just like she is, and he’ll rest his head on Cas’s chest like he never got the chance to do when Cas was alive, and he’ll just not move ever again.
Dean seemed to dislike her explanation too. He made a face, hand tightening fractionally on Sara, “yeah? You and Cas finally decide I ain’t worth the effort? He using his ‘weapon’ to get rid of me?”
“Cas,” he breathed, and the warmth intensified around him.
Cas who doesn’t even need to sleep, and parenting is still running him ragged.
Dean sort of feels like he’s looking in on a private moment, but the little robin is sat in his hand so there’s not much he can do but hold her out to Cas.
like him – more than his own voice does. It takes Dean an embarrassing amount of time to put two and two together and realise why.
When Dean looks over to her, Quin is still staring at the butterfly on Cas’s cheek.
He’s not hearing Cas’s vessel’s voice box or whatever.
Once, in an alternative future of 2014, Cas had told Dean he would know his soul anywhere.
“Quin?” Dean questioned.
He forces his feet to move, one step in front of the other, but when he goes to pick up Cas’s body, Quin growls at him.
The third is Quin. She’s pressed herself up against Cas’s leg, uncaring about Sam seeing her touching him apparently. After a moment, Cas lowers his fingers to brush through her fur in greeting, and Dean feels a shiver run through his whole body.
Castiel actually looks up then, bright blue eyes startled. “You—you can hear me?” there’s something like guilt flooding his features, and the noise dims and quiets. If Dean thought he was close to tears hearing it, this is worse. He has to try desperately hard not to openly weep from the loss of it.  “I’m sorry, Dean, I know my voice is unpleasant for human ears. I had no idea I was projecting it so.”
“I said
No, it was none of that. Dean had been dealing with freaky since he was a kid, after all. What he hadn’t dealt with in his time was someone so human-like not having a daemon to speak of.
“Yes, Quin. The empty did a passable imitation of yourself, but it could never get Quin quite right.”
He eases his gun out from under his pillow (some habits never die) and heads out the door to check out what’s happening.
It’s about as far from that awful screeching as Dean can imagine.
“Hello,” Cas manages, finally. He stumbles on his way across the room, but Quin is there by his feet to lean upon when he needs it.
But then, there was light all around them and Quin growled and then jumped towards the Cas-light-thing protectively and Dean cut his arm to finish the ritual and barrelled headfirst out of the cold.
Angels were not made to be gentle, but things change.
-///-
Dean used the hand that wasn’t cradling Doretha to cover Castiel’s mouth, effectively putting a stop to whatever he was going to say. It might have been a slight mistake, considering Dean’s brain short-circuited when he felt Cas’s breath against his palm, but he couldn’t think of a better way to shut him up.
When Castiel did his damn dramatic entrance into that barn, there was one thing above all the others that truly freaked Dean out.

“Hello, Dean,” she intones, and her voice breaks the otherwise silence in the room (or at least, it breaks the ringing in Dean’s ears enough that he can hear again).

So Dean had tried to shoot her. From the little she had gleaned from Castiel, this was not unusual behaviour for a boy who had grown up knowing that the Monsters under his bed were real.
The first is Sam. He’s helping Cas –
So he drops Sam off at Eileen’s with a smile, and he tries not to wish that Jack was coming home with them because the kid had a bigger destiny than that now and didn’t need the Winchester’s holding him back. And when he and Quin are safe, back in the bunker, Dean gets out the whiskey and drinks like the world really did end.
“Yeah,” he finally echoed, throat feeling far too dry, “we love you. And Cas…your idea of happiness? A little shitty, man. ‘Cos you can have me. And then we can work on making you as happy as possible, huh? I reckon we can do better than a deathbed confession.”

It buried its way into her chest when it should not be there and was tearing her to shreds. It was why she was here in the first place.
But the daemon turned, and her ears perked as she did, “right?”
And then…
Sam’s not said anything – not about Quin's reaction or about…this. Abigail is hanging around his shoulder like she always does, but she’s curled her head in on herself in her grief.
They’re getting Cas back, or they’re gonna fucking die trying.

are curled up together, the robin resting on the German Shepard’s large paws.
He could crush her with his fist, something he was oh so painfully aware of. Yet, Cas apparently trusted him enough for this. Despite all the violence, all the ways Dean had been cruel and an asshole in the past, Cas still let him hold his soul in his palms.

like he can see inside Dean.
he or Quin want, and Dean’s damn certain about that. Touching other peoples daemons isn’t a done thing, and it certainly ain’t something that happens in company (unless you’re a three-year-old half-angel who doesn’t know any better). He and Quin are happy with just each other, always have been, always will be.
And now…
“Look, you had your turn, yeah, give me mine,” Dean took a deep breath and—shit. He probably should have practised this. No, he definitely should have practised this. Four months trying to get Cas out of that shit hole, and only
Cas smiles.
“No, Cas, you don’t get it,” he set the freshly made tea down in front of Cas, sits next to him. “I could

His legs ached. Had he only just started walking? Or had he walked for an eternity already?
There was…
Because it did.
“So. Look at you. Proper human now. The soul to prove it,” Dean nods at Doretha as he sits on the edge of the bed.
“You’re not. Sam’s fast asleep,” Dean moved further into the room so that he could lift the sleeping Jack out of Cas’s arms. He places a small kiss on Jack’s forehead before putting him in his crib. This isn’t a conversation they should have in front of the baby, mostly because he doesn’t want to wake him. “Come on. I’ll make us some of that tea you like,” Dean holds out his hand, and feels that familiar warmth when Cas takes it. The warmth that says
He stumbled over nothing, the words stuttering to a halt too.
All of which to say, Dean is sleeping better than he ever has before, in the few moments where he can grab some shut-eye. He’s honestly not sure how regular parents do it; they’ve got Sam, Eileen, himself

intimately, for all this was their first encounter. “Now heaven is working to stop the breaking of the seals, yet they are being broken anyway. You fear that the angels are not telling you everything.” She should stop there. She had to stop there. If she said anything else, it would be too much. It would be something she could not come back from.
It was approximately three AM on some ideal Wednesday morning that Hagar – The Right Hand of the Divine Angel of the Lord Castiel, his weapon, his Daemon – first met Dean Winchester.
with.
This was nothing like purgatory.
-///-
“What the fuck, Sara, move,” Dean grunted at the husky who had jumped onto the bed and was blocking the barrel of the gun from Hagar’s body almost protectively. Hagar tilted her head (a vague approximation of Cas’s own held tilts) and tried to understand why.
It takes a monumental amount of effort to raise his head from where he’s curled over the warm heartbeat against his fingertips. His eyes hurt from the bright light that was Castiel’s angelic form. He’s half worried that they’re burnt out, and
Dean has been used to Cas not having a daemon since they met – it’s just another one of his quirks - but somehow, seeing her there, it’s like she’s been there all along, sat on Cas’s tan trench coated shoulder.
Yet as she disappeared from the motel room, the feel of Sara’s snout in her feathers followed her like a ghost.
looking forward to the kid when he became a proper teenager. He’s pretty sure grounding someone doesn’t work when they can pop across the world in the blink of an eye whenever they fancy.
Dean leaves the room before he finds out if Sam actually plans on following his order.
Dean steadies his hands, holds them up in surrender, then – quietly, praying even though the only thing worth praying to is now dead in front of him – that the kid can’t hear him as he murmurs, “we can’t let him rot, Quin. We gotta do this properly.”
“We’ll look.”
“I think you have become even
“It is poetic,” Doretha piped up, flying to land on Dean’s palm without shame and
Here’s how it was supposed to go: they’d enter the Empty, guns blazing, and they’d fight their way to Cas, tooth and nail. When they got there, they’d drag him out and nothing – no cosmic horror or entity – would be able to stop them.
was the only other thing Castiel had said to him before leaving, tasking himself with setting up decorations all around the backyard.
Castiel moves his lips to the side of Dean’s mouth, his jaw and then his throat, leaving a trail of wet sloppy kisses behind as he works his way down to Dean’s collarbone, sucking gently onto the skin sending goosebumps down the hunters spine. Dean’s hands are entangled in Castiel’s hair, guiding and showing him where to put his lips next.
“That’s not very reassuring” he looked to Jack and they traded an uneasy look.
“You’re quite the chatterbox.” The sarcasm rolls off of Trainor’s tongue, but Cas doesn’t let it get to him.
Dean never thought he could despise someone as much as he does that reaper. Not only did she take Castiels virginity but she took his life too, and even though he tells himself that it's all okay now since Castiel's back he still can't get it out of his head. Losing Cas is the second worst thing that could happen to Dean, the first being losing his brother so there's about 0.099% chance that Dean would ever forget about this.
the words echo in Dean’s head, the cracks in Castiel’s voice already haunting him. He bites down onto his bottom lip, his jaw clenching tightly as he does so. He wants to tell Castiel that it’s okay, that he understands, and that he’s sorry that he can’t say those words back, but as Dean’s mouth parts, he is unable to utter even a single word.
Castiel assures that they were all looking at Dean who looked ravishing in his short sleeved button down rayon shirt and blue cuffed skinny jeans. He insists that Dean’s mesmerizing emerald eyes, his little tan freckles dotted across his crooked nose and rosy cheeks, and that dazzling boyish grin was enough to have anyone gawk like a fool— he sure did.
He shoots his body out of his seat and just as quickly, pulls the gun from his coat and points it at the ghost. A loud bang follows his swift and deft movements, and like a mirage appearing and disappearing, the ghost is gone. He knows exactly how much time they have left until it appears again, Castiel knows it too and that’s why he turns to the man and urges him to tell him where his son’s bones had been buried.
It’s been three days and they just couldn’t tell what was happening. Castiel, at some point, made a comment about how it might not even be a monster behind the killings, how he’d seen humans do malicious things since the dawn of time.
He takes a breath and reads his words off the piece of paper so quietly that it disappears into thin air before barely reaching his own ears. Sam isn’t anywhere in sight and neither is Castiel but still he’s silent and shy as if he’s at a school recital and it’s his turn to take the stage.
He wiped the angel's tear, looking down at him as they continued to swiftly sway in the middle of the dim lit library. It was quiet, the comfortable silence only drowned out by the soft lull of century old tunes exuding from the vinyl player.
They lied
Their bodies are pressed together as Castiel inches forward, slowly and steadily capturing Dean’s lips. It’s like nothing he could’ve ever imagined. It’s slow, passionate and driven by love and lust. Dean deepens the kiss, his tongue invading the angel's mouth as his hands move to the back of his head his finger roughly raking through Castiel's hair.
His moans soon become raspy as he feels Castiel move in and out of him, going deeper and faster with every thrust. He rolls his hips, craving for more— for all of it— and he can hardly think straight as his eyes roll back while his long fingers dig into Castiel’s soft and milky skin.
feel like a burden, though it shouldn’t. They’re both complicated in a complicated situation. First of all, they’re not even supposed to be in the same bed right now. Their relationship is a secret. Secondly, it was never meant to last. They were supposed to fool around a few times and then come to their senses at some point. But here they are, 11 months later, living together and sharing a bed, so candescently that no one even stops to think twice about their situation.
“So, Mr. Strand. Is there anything you can tell us about the day of your son’s death? Is there anything you could possibly know that the police doesn’t?” Dean realizes too late how accusatory his words sound, and by the frightened look on David Strand’s eyes, he can tell that he knows it’s over.
“I can’t go anywhere, Sammy” he struggled, his breath slowly slipping away. It took Sam a minute to figure out what was happening and when he did… he felt his world shake, like an earthquake putting an irreparable crack in the core of the planet.
He watches Dean do the same, and the sight drives him insane, urging him to undress faster and pin Dean down to their bed.
He didn’t though. The Winchesters got into their car and drove off without any knowledge of the angel being right there.
Dean starts to heave as he goes in and out of Castiel’s mouth, the pleasure washing over him like a wave.
“How many people have you used those lines on?” Dean lets out a scoff, as if to try and convince himself that he’s just ordinary, that an angel as experienced and old as Castiel couldn’t possibly look at
"Cas, I  don't—"
He doesn't know how to cope and he wonders how the Winchesters do it. He suddenly has new found respect for the both of them. Castiel can't imagine ever going through what they've gone through, let alone coming out the other side stronger than ever.
look.
And feel the weight of your ribs between my hips
“Please, don’t leave.” And their fingers intertwine, the simple gesture sending sparks through their veins. He closes the gap between them, breathing in Castiel’s tainted breath before placing a soft and lingering kiss against his lips.
"...April is gone, you took care of it, and whatever other angel is after me. I can handle it."
In the way you looked at me
People say that everything has its purpose
He pushes himself up and launches forward to where the shotgun is, he fires, first at the ghost, to save Dean, and then at David to slow him down and keep him from doing anything stupid.
"Dean. I don't want to talk to you right now. I have nothing to say and whatever you have to say, I don't want to hear it"
“You two have an amazing home.” Jody smiles and makes sure to offer Castiel her praises as well. He’s standing awkwardly behind Dean with a glass of water in his hands, and he grins politely, thanking her silently for her compliments.
Dean feels defeated so when Castiel tells him to let go, he does exactly that. Watching Castiel walk out of that door, unsure whether he's ever coming back or not hurts Dean more than he ever thought it would. Regret washes over him and as he hears the pitter patter of his best friends footsteps become quieter by each passing moment he is comvinced that that's the last time he would ever hear them.
“Collins, Andrews.” An authoritative voice comes from behind them, and they both turn around to meet the eyes of detective Larry Trainor, his eyes fixed on them and his arms folded against his chest, clearly showing them his disapproval.
His tears flowed down his cheeks, uncontrollably as he sobbed. His heart, mending, breaking and mending over and over again. He had him back. But only for a minute. He was still dying and no amount of fighting could save him, it was too late and he could feel it.
“Come on, dinner’s getting cold.” Sam says and watches as they follow him to the kitchen where the food had been set.
When nightfall came, they were quiet. Excited yet slightly nervous. It was unusual, the fact that after all they’ve been through, a simple vampire hunt still made them nervous.
The way you smiled and told me I looked pretty
look, it burns bright in his eyes and is visible in the way the corners of his mouth tugs down, but Castiel misses it all, his eyes rather focused on the tar road under him.
The warm Florida water washes over their feet, the sloshing like music to their ears. They’re shirtless, dressed in matching Hawaiian shorts as they play like kids in the ocean, splashing each other with water and tackling each other to the ground. Their faces are starting to turn red from too much sun exposure, and even though Castiel can just take it away with a click of his fingers, he doesn’t. He loves how human it all is, this moment with Dean, the heat of the sun stinging like pins into his skin, and the way his heart almost jumps out of chest when Dean pins him to the ground and hovers over him, blocking out the sun with his large and sturdy physique. He could flip him over without breaking a sweat but he doesn’t move a muscle, clearly enjoying the way the other man has his hands pinned down above his head.
The rain begins to subside as the grey clouds disappear, making way for a bright yellow sun and a ray of light with seven different hues. They’re seated, just about an inch apart, with their knees pulled up to their chests. They’re both glowing with joy, their eyes bright and gleaming, their smiles wide and gleeful.
It’s the way you hold me down, your fingers bruising my hips as they dig deep into my skin
Still promising to love and cherish me even after forever is long gone.
“I want you to fuck me so bad right now.” Dean doesn’t think to listen to how greedy and lascivious he sounds— he doesn’t care— as he closes in and kisses Castiel with every ounce of passion inside of him.
Their first meeting was just as the first time Dean and Sara met Castiel himself. Appearing without warning likely was unhelpful in creating a calm atmosphere. Hagar had simply appeared at the foot of Dean’s motel room bed, red flames licking at her golden plumage, eyes trained on the hunter and her talons clutching the weak metal of the bed stand.
Hagar was almost confused. No. Why would they ever decide that? Dean Winchester was the righteous man, and they had raised him from hell, carved him from dust, made him perfect once more.
Maybe Quin has given a part of herself to Cas and now she doesn’t know how to be only Dean’s again.
He’s not sure if it’s beautiful or if it’s sort-of-terrifying but he’s damn sure it’s peaceful.
maybe it was his thought, maybe it was something outside him. He couldn’t tell. He kept walking.
“Yeah, well, you two have always been close,” Dean coughed.
But she was, of course, she was.
Nothing at all. There was…nothing. Just nothing. On and on and on, nothing and nothing, stretching not just to the horizon, but above and below them as well.
The suddenness of the sound startles everyone. Dean can feel it. The tension in her shoulders. The pain in her eyes. Fighting with your own daemon is a bad sign – particularly in company – and he knows Sam will clock it and want to talk about it later. But Dean gets it. He does. If Quin lets Dean pick Cas up, then Cas will be really truly dead.
“Drop it, Sammy.”
“Are they real flames?” Sara broke Hagar’s downward spiral. Hagar glanced at her, wondering when she had gotten so close. The wetness of her nose was barely a few inches from Hagar’s feathers.
The noise doesn’t get louder, exactly, because it
It was as simple as that.
It had never felt so final.
Dean wished she weren’t right about that.
(Well, maybe he could think of a better way to shut him up. But words first, then they could move on to gratuitous amounts of sex, if Cas wanted that.)
Eventually, after Cas had yawned approximately twelve times in the span of five minutes, Sam had announced that he should get some rest.
“Cas, is that really you?” Dean can feel his voice shaking. If this is some damn shifter, then he’s going to tear out its damn throat.
But he’d never been great at either of those things, so he settled for just taking another sip of his beer.
Cas was just as alone as ever.
Dean felt a smile cross his lips, “fuck yeah.” He murmured, leaning in and meeting Cas halfway.
Angels were not made to be gentle.
“They can’t,” Castiel whispers back, careful not to disturb the child in his arms. There’s no halt to the melody when Cas does, it continues unbidden and beautiful into the night. “Jack’s not human.”
Dean tries not to tense as Wendy jumps from the table, turning mid-air into a butterfly and landing on Cas’s cheek.
son, Dean’s son too, and Sam’s – is God.
Shit. Only one person who had ever made Dean feel like he had any religion to disrespect.
The angels had fallen, and Cas was somehow to blame, and it didn’t matter really because there was so much else going on (see: Sammy almost dead in Dean’s arms, Abigail shivering around his neck, scales looking dried out and eyes lifeless as they stared at Dean).
Here’s how it actually went: they were cold.

His mouth isn’t open; he’s not even indulging in the gentle humming habit he has when he makes eggs in the morning, picked up some time since he got back from the Empty. Instead, he’s just sat, bright blue eyes staring with such adoration down at Jack.

He’s on his fifth glass of whiskey when he stumbles down the corridor to the room where it happened. Everything is exactly how they left it.
He blinks.
Cas isn’t in bed beside him like he was when Dean fell asleep, but that’s pretty normal. Dean’s well aware that Cas often excuses himself when Dean drifts off, because, well. It’s gotta be pretty boring lying awake for eight hours not doing jack shit.

“We should talk about what happened, Cas.”
Like a human might. What was happening to her? She did not know. It felt like rot, overtaking her, pulling at all the things she had once known to be solid and real and collapsing them down.
He reaches out a hand again, she goes to bite it. He feels her draw blood, the hiss from both of them as they feel the pain in it.
But it’s gone before he can get a good look.
The Angel of Thursday, the one who gripped Dean tight and raised him from the depths of hell; was it any wonder that his daemon would take the form of an animal who already had fire licking at its body, who was born to walk through flame and pain;
Something familiar.
It’s the most beautiful thing Dean has ever seen.
They were warriors. They were weapons. Their light was like the suns; dangerous, necessary, violent. They did not answer prayers. They did not soothe the weak and weary. They did not protect the needy. They did only as they were told.
“No,” she finally answered. “I simply wanted to…meet you.”
By the time he reaches Jack’s room, he really is holding back tears. Whatever the fuck it is, it’s stirring something big within him. Dean really hopes he’s not gonna have to fight it, because somehow, despite him not giving a damn in general about faith and belief and, you know, the fact that he’d
