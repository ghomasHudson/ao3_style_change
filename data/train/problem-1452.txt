“I'm told that the vaporizer is top of the line.” Mycroft said. “It's a convection vaporizer, which is vastly superior to a conduction vaporizer.  Start with the OG Cush, and then the Blue Dream. When you start feeling more yourself, move to the Cannotonic. The rest you can play around with.”  John found the idea of Mycroft Holmes speaking about various cannabis varietals enormously surreal, and yet, there is was.
John looked at him blankly.
He observes:
“Sit, Heather!  John budge over, give her some room!” Molly said, beaming at her friend.
John clears his throat and chokes out,  "What was that you said again?"  He looks almost stricken,  and surely that wasn't supposed to be the outcome of a few provocative sucks on a lolly.
.  He privately refers to his wife Hilda as She-who-must-be-obeyed.  I grew up watching it with my parents on PBS and I'm sure John would have been acquainted with it as well.

“Yeah?  And when did this happen?”
“Hmm,” he intoned, taking the opportunity to take her hand in both of his.  Using the moment to brush his fingers through hers, to barely graze the skin between them before scratching his index finger just so against the middle of her palm, his smile growing even more predatory as he watched her pupils dilate. “You may not know this, but one day I delivered something into your lab for Molly.  Left it on your desk.  Which was very tidy, almost military in its precision.  There was one photo on it, of an older man and woman.  Who I assume are your parents.”
“On the contrary.  It is emotion that I understand most of all.  It is emotion that I mold and shape and use.  Mycroft remains unaffected by me because he disconnects with his; he can separate himself from them.  You simply don’t understand, which makes you immune. It is your greatest protection from me and, at the same time, your greatest weakness, brother mine.”
“We don't use nannies,” Sherlock spit acidly. “Molly and Mrs Hudson sit with Rosie.  Harry's had her a bit.  They babysit, Mycroft.  A world does exist beyond the Diogenes Club.”
John sighed. “Yeah, we both decided to chalk it up to an unfortunate date with a really great person and call it an early evening.”
John felt he had just caught up with the conversation. “I’m sorry,” he broke in, “did you say that she had an IQ of 170?”
John stared open-mouthed at Heather for a few moments while he composed himself. “Being a bit abrupt, wouldn’t you say?”
“John,” he’d said, taking her hand, her long fingers tipped with red lacquer. “And I hear you can thank Molly for that.”

So not much to set him off, really.

“I do not! I know everything about a person within a moment, John! And I've known Tinsley since uppers, so your observation is irrelevant!”
When he'd looked in her eyes and found a release from his staggering grief over Sherlock.
This is un-beta'd, so there's most likely mistakes.  Also, thanks to the people who are leaving kudos.  They are most appreciated.
She leaned in even closer, a conspiratorial look on her face.  “Just so you know, Molly’s been talking you up for a while now.” She said, her breath ghosting his ear.
He's quiet when he answers.  "I said that I wanted you to be happy. "
When it came to actual emotion, however, Sherlock was out of his element – the only time, really, that he was ever out of his element.
Oh, and let's not forget that she was behind everything Moriarty had done and, therefore, Sherlock jumping from the roof of St. Bart's.  Which gave his current state of mental health some sort of twisted symmetry, really.
John smiled and said, “Thank you, Sherlock, for arranging this, even though it is a bit - strange. It feels better starting this up again – dating – if I know that you approve of the woman.” He cocked his head and said, “It shouldn't, because you have terrible perception when it comes to this type of thing -"
Yes, John and Rosie have moved into the flat.  Yes, John and Sherlock are still totally clueless about their feeling for each other.  Yes, John still insists he isn't gay - he's not ready to admit that he finds both men and women sexually attractive.
the way to you.”
And can we not forget that his chosen target was in fact Sherlock's criminally insane sister who can manipulate minds like some sort of deranged super-villain.  Because of course she was. His entire life had been one fucked up moment after another if he thinks about it too hard.
John was called into A&E on the day of Rosie's 15 month exam because of some understaffing crisis,  so Sherlock, being a Good Godfather,  told John he would make sure Rosie made it to the Paediatrician's office, reassuring John as he bustled out the door to the clinic,  but not before giving Rosie a kiss on her head and telling her to be a brave soldier for Sherlock.
Greg was smiling knowingly at John. “I know.  She’s a bit – overwhelming, isn’t she?”
“One could say the same thing about you,” he said cautiously.
Mycroft let out a long-suffering sigh. “Don't be such a drama queen, Sherlock.  It really doesn't suit you.”
“You understand so much, Sherlock.  You can look at a person and know everything about them with just a glance.  Yet when it comes to your own mind you are completely lost.  You struggle with the most basic emotions.”
And yet he had made a promise to himself and to her that he wouldn’t leave her, at least not of his own volition.  He had no control over Mycroft’s whims; she knew as well as he did that if Mycroft deemed it necessary she would be moved with no input from Sherlock or their parents.  If Mycroft deemed it necessary, she would be hidden away, never to be seen again.  Mycroft had made it quite plain to him that if he even got a whiff that Eurus was attempting another insurrection that it would be ended swiftly with a bullet to the back of the head.
John is smiling and it's beautiful.  John is beautiful; he's the sun and the earth and all that Sherlock has ever wanted,  will ever want.  And Sherlock realizes he's smiling.
“Much more than just a one nighter with Molly, John.  She’s the real deal.”
The cancer drug for those who are BRCA gene positive is called Lynparza (olaparib) in the U.S. It was approved by the FDA in February of 2018, so it's pretty new to the scene.  If that sort of thing interests you,
"I love you, John.  I wanted you to finally be happy."
And then she did something that she had never done, in all the weeks that they had been playing for one another.  She stepped away from her own free form music, her own communication, and she played something that sent shivers up Sherlock’s spine.
It was John reaching for Rosie that brought him out of it. He didn't want to hand her over. Because Rosie Watson was his, too.
“It was an exciting time.  The Human Genome Project was formed in ’90, so I got in on the ground floor, so to speak.  The early years were mostly developing the technology accelerating the elucidation of the genome.  We spent a lot of time sequencing small-scale models, using that data to develop the methodologies used in the large-scale sequencing of the human genome.  Then in ’94 I joined a team at the NIH studying the BRCA 1 gene. I’ve been studying it ever since.  My focus is on whether we can manipulate the gene before birth to prevent its effects entirely.  In addition, I look for ways we can treat those with the gene to prevent the development of breast cancer.  They’ve just recently released a cancer treatment for those with metastatic cancer who exhibit the gene; I want to catch people long before that and prevent the disease entirely.”
“And how about you, then?  What sort of man do you need?”
“Only if you’re a man,”
"What?" he asks,  still fully prepared to fall into himself,  to flee.
“You know,” he said, looking meaningfully between John and Heather, “that
“I have no idea why you are insinuating that I had anything to do with Tinsley being here. But she is quite tolerable so yes, I am happy for you, John.”
John's nostrils flare and for the quickest of moments,  his mouth falls open and his face is totally unguarded.   It's  full of years of want and lust and, with a very uncharacteristic crack in his voice,  he whispers,  "Jesus Christ,  Sherlock."
“What was that?”
She looked over the violin at him and played something very elementary, a tune that resembled something that a beginning violinist would learn.  This was new.  He waited.  She continued in this way for a time and then started playing something quite complex, a tune that required his full attention to understand.  She wanted his attention.  And she believed that he didn’t know, or needed to learn, what she was trying to say.
“There’s a time for innuendo and there’s a time to be abrupt.  You haven’t answered the question.”
“I am well aware, Sherlock.  John is showing interest in dating again.”
“He will if he finds another woman to care for.  You and I both know that John puts a great deal of importance behind romantic and sexual relationships.  And he will be looking for a mother for Rosamund.”
Everyone was happy to see him. He was happy to see everyone.  He hadn’t felt like this in a long time.  He felt a puff of pride that the old John Watson was back, at least for the time being.  He settled in opposite Molly with a grin.
She tilted her head at him, looked at him as if he were a scientific specimen, and said, “I’ve so many plans for you, Sherlock.  And I’ve just gotten you.”
John smiled back, warmly and genuinely.  Yes, he missed pub nights with Greg, his friendly mate, his listening ear, likely his (second) best friend. “Happy to be here, mate.  How many pints do you have on me?”
Hah!  A pun!
And then there's lips, soft, hesitant, and a tongue,  (which was softer than it should have been for such a strong,  large muscle), and it's hot and dizzy and a high pitched whine comes out of his belly and John is grasping at his hair and neck and face and it's almost too much and then it's over.  And he feels John's exhalation on his cheek when he doesn't immediately open his eyes.
"But you don't - it's all transport!" John almost shouts,  gesturing wildly at Sherlock's body.

Thank you for the kudos and comments.  I'm so happy that so many of you are enjoying the story.
But an intimacy with Irene would require much more work than Sherlock could put into it. She deserved someone who had the time for her. He had The Work and John and now Rosie to think about and there simply wasn't enough room in his life to add her to the equation.
“The talk show hosts would mostly just ask me trivia questions.  You know – name the presidents of the United States in order, name all of the state capitals – it was insulting, really. Carson was nice, though.  He liked talking to children and he actually asked me some real questions about my life and who I was.  Hollywood Squares was fun, too; I got to meet Betty White and Richard Simmons.  But mostly I was just some sort of child freak who could answer any question that you threw at her.  It was uncomfortable and embarrassing, and they really didn’t care at all about
Since her return to Sherrinford their conversations had consisted of the plaintive notes of their respective violins.  She was an exceptional musician, able to entrance with the draw of her bow.  They would sit, him on one side of the bullet-proof glass, her facing him on the other, and play for hours, becoming reacquainted with each other.
Their eyes met.  After a moment, he remembered to breathe.
John came home rather earlier than Sherlock was expecting. He had just put Rosie down (she had fallen asleep on the ear diagram) when he came through the door.
Still no beta.  So there's bound to be mistakes.
“It was Great Ormond inter-office communication. Unless an interloper made it happen, a very important document from Great Ormond in inter-office communication would not end up here.  Ever.  Under any circumstances.”
John was still squinting at him, but he said, “Alright. You know you can talk to me?” When Sherlock didn't answer and instead seemed to be studying Rosie's face, John said, “Are you sure you're fine?”
"I'm going out on a limb,  John," he answers,  surprised by the rasp in his voice.   "One of us had to. "
He sat.
It always threw him a bit when people brought up bits of himself that he hadn’t freely offered.  It must have shown in his face.
Dr. Heather Love.  The American genomics researcher studying the BRCA 1 gene, down the hall from Molly for several years now.  The first time John had caught sight of her had been shortly after he’d began working with Sherlock, shortly after Sherlock had returned.  She’d been bent over one of the counters in her lab, completely engrossed in what she’d been doing.  She’d taken John’s breath away.  But John had been engaged then, in love with Mary, and so after a perhaps longer than necessary look he’d moved on.
He came back to himself when John handed Rosie to him.
’” she mimicked with a small, breathy laugh. “James was my creation, my beautiful creation -  I created him to
"You were dead,  Sherlock!" John sighed heavily,  closed his eyes and took a breath in through his nose.   "I know we've been here before,  we've had this conversation, but I watched you die, Sherlock, I had your blood on my hands - it was warm and - and then I buried you and drank myself into a stupor and forgot why I was supposed to try to keep living." Another pause. "When I met Mary,  you were dead and I was alone and she helped me forget - and then you came back and showed up at that restaurant and then you HELPED TO PLAN THE BLOODY WEDDING! Why would you do that,  Sherlock,  why! If this really, "  John gestures between the two of them and ends with,  "Why, Sherlock?"
Holy Christ, had it arisen.
It had happened before. More times than he could count, that exchange of looks, but before there had been a hint of self-loathing or sexual identity crisis or fear. There had been none of that this time. Instead, there had been fondness, and also a bit of an unanswered question. There had been a shift in resolve. It had been quiet and peaceful and like everything was as it should be.
After a moment, John was standing beside him, rocking back and forth on his feet, hands pushed into his trouser pockets, giving him one of his grins.
A player is introduced, and the game takes an unexpected turn.  Rosie is a genius.
Sherlock stopped cold and stared in anger at Mycroft before flopping down into a sulk on the sofa.
“Just put her down. She is a genius, John. She knows the entire anatomy of the inner ear.”
He looked at Sherlock in accusation. Sherlock maintained his innocent posture.
“If you lose him, you will be lost for good.  He is your light, Sherlock.  Your strength.  If you lose him, I lose you."
John was smiling politely back and forth between Sherlock and Tinsley and giving Sherlock the “give me a minute, would you?” look so Sherlock walked away from them and looked at some pamphlets smiling smugly to himself. Of course he would be good at matchmaking. He was brilliant. And Tinsley was - well she was tolerable at least. And not an assassin with a covert ops group who would eventually shoot him. That bit was good, too.
John smiled back, laying on the old Watson charm, giving a bit of a lopsided grin and then biting his lower lip (that always worked on the women Sherlock had observed) and taking her hand.
“She wants to know if you’ll be back tomorrow.  She reminded the control room that you were the one that insisted on talking.  Said she’s perfectly content simply playing her violin.”
“Are you, now,” John asked Heather, quirking an eyebrow.
“Been over three months now, at least.  Got up the nerve during that case with the produce manager,”
Sherlock had made the comment that he didn't care about cannabis – it dulled his senses and if he wanted to shut down heroin was much more interesting. Which, strangely, didn’t worry John all that much, considering Sherlock never shut down.  Mycroft had actually laughed – it was more of a grunt, but still.  And then he'd given Sherlock the cannabis and texted Anthea, who arrived with bags containing a vaporizer, a grinder, and five storage containers.
John huffed a laugh and looked at Heather, who was looking at him, smiling, looking just as amused.
Back at 221b, after John had come home from a short shift and after Rosie had been dosed with paracetamol, fed,  and placed in her cot for a nap (the jabs had made her grizzly and tired),  Sherlock remembered that he had a cherry lolly in his pocket and absentmindedly begins sucking on it while reading a book on forensic anthropology.
From there she went on to graduate studies in genetics, still at Harvard. Graduated at twenty.  Then Bethesda, Maryland where she joined the National Human Genome Institute.
about it.
John is staring again,  and Sherlock watches the many emotions play across his face.   He's always been able to read John like a book but it's all happening too rapidly and he's trying to commit it all to memory and he can't predict the next words out of John's mouth.
Not beta'd, I'm not receiving money, all that legal blather.
. I couldn’t give a shit about John Watson, but he
Sherlock would answer with apologies.  He apologized for having forgotten her.  For erasing her existence from his memories, for not knowing that he had such a brilliant, fascinating sister – a sister who idolized him with a ferocious, terrifying ardor.  Those notes were spare and plaintive, slow and often gentle.  He refused to beg for her forgiveness; he felt that, underneath it all, she desired that above everything else.  Her actions during the prison siege had negated any chance of that ever happening, however.  That conversation had been sharp and forceful.  He had broken a string trying to get his anger at her actions across.  He had played with so much fury that day – telling her in song that what she had done was viewed as unforgiveable by most, that she had nearly taken away the only people in his life that he truly cared for, that no matter how brilliant he thought her, she could not have made up for the loss of John or Molly – or Mycroft.  He berated her for John’s deteriorated mental state (which she had taken a sick delight in initially, but was now repentant for, now that she knew that she had Sherlock, that he wasn’t going to abandon her again).
She was his.  He’d forgotten how heady it was to draw them in, to hold them in his grasp, to turn off kind John and turn on the lady-killer.  He relished in the surrender; it made him feel masculine and virile.  And to have a gorgeous woman under his spell, someone who could give as well as she got?  That was the greatest prize of all.
“But you did know that I was gorgeous,” she observed, teasing John.
Sherlock's face got hot and he stared at John, who was now searching his eyes for something, looked as if he were working out a puzzle, the slightest smile on his face, his head tilted to the side. Sherlock felt his heart rate elevating and he felt the need to take a deep breath, but something kept him from doing it.
"No,  before you said that bit.   What you said before that. "
John is sitting there,  eyes boring into Sherlock's, lips a tight line.  Like he's nervous.   Or challenging Sherlock to say or do something.  Or - yes! - John is resolute.   He's made a decision and he's seeing it through.   A soldier going into possibly hostile territory.
Also that he and his precious, innocent daughter were the flat mates of Eurus Holmes’s brother.
Sherlock didn't move. He couldn't answer. Everything that he knew would somehow have to be re-ordered. He remembered that first stake out at Angelo's, the stilted conversation about Sherlock's sexual preferences and his answer that he was married to his work. How could he have known what John would become to him? Was John still under the impression that Sherlock was that same person? Surely John, who had a better command of human emotion than most, had seen that things had changed, that they were both completely different people. Surely John understood -
Sherlock looked at him in complete innocence. “It was totally coincidental that Tinsley was here. She works in hospital administration -”
“Yeah?  And why’s that?”
Sherlock buried himself more into the couch as he tried to convince himself that yes, he was ready for that. It didn't matter anyway, it was all sentiment, and John would never really abandon him.  He couldn't.  He was his John.  His blogger.  And Rosie was his Mendelian masticator.
". . . saw John chatting up that blonde nurse in A&E,” Mycroft was drawling out rather loudly
“Jesus,” John swore, closing his eyes and breathing on slowly through his nose.  Now was not the time to get angry.
“I believe, nutkin, that the game has taken an unexpected turn,” he said to his otorhinolaryngology prodigy, who squealed in what Sherlock was sure was complete understanding. She was, after all, a genius.
She-who-must-be-obeyed is a nod to the classic British show
On the way back to the booth, he received numerous ‘Eh! Johnny Watson’s’ and back slaps.  More than a few Yarders raised a pint to him.  Sally shouted, “Sherlock off to see his sister, then?” which John answered with nod and a thumbs up.
He rushed into the atrium and brushed against her, eliciting a pleased, “Sherlock Holmes?” out of her.
Over the next several hours and pints, John learned the following about Dr. Heather Love: she’d grown up in Appalachia, the only child of a single mother who was rarely emotionally stable.  During routine testing at her school she was identified as having a genius level IQ.  After that, the school started to notice the unusual bruises that she would show up to school with and the way she had trouble sitting down (because of frequent canings).
“Perhaps you can explain to me why I shouldn’t be pissed off that Molly disclosed something like this to someone I hadn’t even met yet?” John challenged, the anger rising in his voice.
John grinned and said, “Caught ya, Sherlock.”
So he’d followed Stewart’s advice and he'd learned that some places in the world had already legalized its use. He knew about Amsterdam, of course, but Canada?  That Colorado allowed it for medical use and most likely recreational use would follow.  That California was a major legal cannabis grower. That in addition to it helping the intractable nausea of chemotherapy, it was a medically sound treatment for depression, anxiety, certain seizure types, pain syndromes including migraine cephalgia, irritable bowel disease, fibromyalgia, and PTSD.
Tinsley Chesterton was pleasant to look at with rather symmetrical features. She was blonde, so John would like that. She was witty and quick with a comeback. Had an impressive family tree (a negative in John's book BUT) she was incredibly modest, kind, and approachable (giving her positive characteristics for a mate). Loved a good, dark, small corner bistro, she could pick the venue – it would impress John. She worked in health care administration, giving them mutual interests. Their features were comparable. Was barely plump (Sherlock had noted long ago that John preferred women who were at the upper end of an acceptable BMI). She was a flirt and would probably initiate the date. She had used Sherlock on an extortion case before he had met John and had been forever grateful. She was very sentimental.
The silence that followed that statement set upon the kitchen so swiftly, it was as if someone had turned down the volume. It seemed that even the birds outside stopped their squawking momentarily.
So, maybe they are a couple of sorts. But John isn’t gay (much as that might make things easier), and neither (he thinks) is Sherlock, and they aren’t . . . well,
“They are standard fare for stab wound victims.”
Sherlock grunted, which translated to.
Before he could think better of it, John blurted: “I feel like I’m trampling over ground that needs to be tread softly.”
It felt, unnervingly, a lot like love.
John swallowed, then nodded. He turned his gaze, but not his attention, back to the screen. “Sure.”
“Because . . . I don’t like people telling me what I am or am not. Or what you are, for that matter. It’s aggravating.”
“Yeah. All right.”
need a definition.”
It was an expression that John knew he himself wore often, when looking at Sherlock. To see it reflected back to him was too powerful for words.
John tore himself away from the NSY member trying to call him. He sprinted over to where the paramedics were loading up, one climbing in the back and about to close the doors—
.” His eyes drifted from John’s face, towards the blue flowers on the bedside table. A dark brow rose. “Flowers?”
So, he’d phoned Greg and suggested they meet up at a new pub that opened up just four blocks from Baker Street.
“I’ve been wondering.”
The pregnant pause that followed this question seemed to stretch infinitely, and John suddenly felt as though he was in over his head. Sherlock knew him better than anyone—and, at long last, he felt he could say the reverse as well. He
, it has, Sherlock.”
had just swallowed a mouthful of lemon juice, and promptly shoved a hand over John’s mouth to keep him quiet. So, John nixed that one.
John sighed again and shook his head. “I don’t even know.”
, I won’t stop you from trying, and will give an opinion on whatever you come up with, if requested.”
The case was solved within a matter of days. It was done up in dramatic form, with Sherlock and John arriving just in time at a crime scene-to-be. It looked like it would have been a right fucking mess: the murderer, one Andrew Hollingsworth, was using a basement in an abandoned apartment building, where he’d set up gurneys and a barrage of medical equipment. The victims were laying on the gurneys, out cold, and Hollingsworth was about to cut into the first when John and Sherlock arrived. John promptly levelled his Sig Sauer at the man, whilst Sherlock cuffed him. It had then been left to John to see to the victims, relief and a second wave of adrenaline washing over him when he found that both of them had strong, steady pulses.
More ineffable staring
John knew he should drop it there; but he was on a roll at the moment, and if he didn’t ask now, he’d probably never actually know. And he might be the only person in the universe that Sherlock would discuss it with. “What kind of asexual?”
Sherlock picked up the paper that John had discarded earlier and opened it. “I used the marmalade for an experiment, but I think we still have jam.”
“Tipsy,” John corrected.
“Sherlock!”
Sherlock met his gaze as he reached the top of the stairs. He quirked an eyebrow, and John grinned sheepishly.
When John stumbled home that evening (that last pint had been a doozy), Sherlock was (of course) still up, seated at the kitchen table and bent over his dissection microscope. He was dressed in grey wool pajamas and his blue silk dressing gown, looking rumpled and sleep deprived. John leaned (read: sagged) against the doorway, just watching him. It took several minutes before Sherlock looked up. There was a wrinkle between his eyes that smoothed out at he gazed at John, taking him in.
Sherlock gave an eyeroll that was fonder than it appeared at first glance, and ducked back into the living room, calling over his shoulder: “As I stated previously, I don’t care. But if we could refrain from further dissecting my sexuality, or lack thereof, in our
“Oh, fuck off.”
“Congratulations, you have deduced about yourself the most patently obvious.”
He had looked up then from the second victim to see Sherlock, who had forced the murderer to his knees, staring at him. It was a look such that John had seen before, almost never directly; he tended to catch it in his periphery, presumably when Sherlock though he wasn’t paying attention. Only once or twice had he glimpsed it before, yet here it was again: a look completely devoid of any pretence, open, raw, joyful, and completely transfixed. As if John were something amazing.
John struggled to relocate his tongue, which seemed to have jumped down his throat in panic. This was ridiculous. Sherlock had to be taking the piss. He’d said outrageous things like that before, just to make John laugh. So, John forced one out now, manufacturing levity and saying, “Oh, right, you’re joking.”
Sherlock tore his eyes from the screen to give John a look that clearly reciprocated the sentiment, and then asked, “Your search history. Am I to expect a declaration of undying devotion in the near future?”
in detail,” he said, holding up his hand in panic as Sherlock lowered the paper incredulously. Lord, he did
“I suppose we could always describe ourselves as ‘partners in crime’—”
It held all the connotations of friendship, but was casual.
Right. John knew that, after several years of living together, after everything they had been through, there was no way that Sherlock was not familiar with
And, with that, any tension that had lingered in the air dissipated, and it was like any other morning at 221B Baker Street. Sherlock took another drink from his tea before pulling apart the paper and handing John the sports section. They finished their breakfast mostly in silence, Sherlock occasionally piping up to ridicule a political figure or two. Once they were both done with breakfast, Sherlock left the table and wandered into the living room. As John dutifully cleared away their plates and began the washing up, he heard the sound of a violin being tuned, and soon after the first slow notes of one of the few pieces Sherlock had taught him to recognize: Elgar’s
this might be for anyone else who was
John clicked to the next channel. A reporter in a bright yellow dress was standing in a torrential gale trying to make the most of it.
It bothered John in a way he couldn’t explain. Shouldn’t have to explain? It was annoying as all hell to be constantly and consistently misinterpreted—almost wilfully, as in the case of Mrs. Hudson, bless her. John was a relatively easy-going bloke (a quality which made living with Sherlock at all possible), and there were times when he knew it was a lost cause and hurting very little to let people carry on with their assumptions. A part of him gets it, he really does: what he has with Sherlock is . . . intense. Unpredictable. Devoted. In short, it has been the most important relationship of John’s life, and it continues to be so. Sherlock surprises, consternates, delights, and knows John in ways that (as he has come to suspect and accept) a potential romantic partner may never do.
“What do you think about?”
The thought was clear, even while the sights and sounds surrounding John were not. His vision was unfocused, dizzying. He could see the flashing lights of NSY, the large white outline of an ambulance. He could hear sirens, but they seemed to be underwater. Someone was accosting him, trying to talk to him, but—
John couldn’t help but give a quiet chuckle at that, which caused Sherlock to shift until John squeezed his ankle reassuringly. “Puppy love,” John said softly.
Sherlock’s precise and deliberate enunciation made John grimace. Why did that word have to sound so bloody awkward? “Yes! Most people think of… well, other people. Sexy scenarios. But you have no interest. So, what do you think about—
“Well . . . are you totally against anything sexual, or just sex with other people?”
John blinked in surprise. Sherlock brought his tea back to his mouth and took a soundless sip. He continued to watch John with the same frank blue gaze, nearly unblinking. It would have been unnerving, if not for the fact that . . . well, it was Sherlock. And, for John, Sherlock’s intense stare was not the threat that most people perceived. It was. . . .
Left ear, high pitched, frantic. Mosquito.
“Did you get it?”
Then John went quiet. There was no movement for what felt like a long time.
“Where is it, Sherlock?”
“I think so.”
But, he couldn’t see it. He couldn’t see much of anything; it was the middle of the night.
“John?”
Sherlock reached out, letting his arm fall where it may. It landed on what felt like John’s forehead. John’s sweaty forehead.
“Morning,” John said as he entered the kitchen. He stood next to the kitchen table, suddenly unsure if he should sit down.
“Person’lly,” Greg said after they had settled back into their seats, “I find that love is like an orgasm.”

He had not been overly surprised to learn that, like sexual orientation, romantic orientation was a rather broad spectrum. However, he did have trouble imagining romantic attachment without, or incongruent to, sexual preference.
There was security detail from NSY posted outside Sherlock’s hospital room, and he nodded and stepped aside as John approached. John had practically lived in that room for the first twenty-four hours, and had made damn well sure that he was allowed back without question.
“Masturbate?”
Sherlock shook his head. John could see the drugs still clouding his mental faculties, and Sherlock’s annoyance at them. “Not much. Gallery. Chase. Cezanne painting. Pain in my abdomen.” He brought a hand up and placed his fingers gently on the edge of the gauze. He looked up at John. “Bad?” he questioned.
His initial Google searches, ham-handed though they were, lead him to websites that he (now with the full knowledge of Sherlock’s scrutiny, and having been exonerated from explanation) clicked through with interest and without hesitation. Sometimes it led him to things that were . . . well, just not his bag; but, for the most part, it was extremely informative.
“You should sleep.”
“You don’t like it.”
And John did, turning the subtitles on for the crime docu and settling in. At some point, Sherlock removed his leg from John’s lap and put it back under his thigh, and it was not a rebuff, but a reassurance. Later in the evening, as part two of the show was ramping up, Sherlock closed his laptop and put it aside. He asked John to turn up the volume so that he could abuse the show properly, and rearranged himself to spend the rest of the evening with his head on John’s shoulder, and then on John’s left thigh.
And we're done! Except there will be one more wee chapter after this :)
“On occasion, yes. I am certainly not as prolific as you.”
As John brought his fork to his mouth, he studied Sherlock, or what he could see of him over the paper. Sherlock was, unequivocally, an attractive man; lean, with a face chiselled out of marble, piercing eyes, and a meticulous overall countenance. Definitely good-looking. It was a thought John had had before—hard not to when women (and men) on their cases went gaga over Sherlock before realizing that he was a complete and utter bastard— but, with John’s current line of research, the thought came with baggage that he had never had the nerve to unpack.
Arsehole, to you. Now shut up so I can work.”
“Seems like the right attitude to take, in my opinion—fuck yes!”
Greg looked at him sidelong. “Or,
John raised an eyebrow. It was unlike Sherlock to repeat himself.
And there are only so many times that a man, even as patient a man as John Watson, can allow himself to be misidentified without wanting to do something about it.
“I do love Sherlock,” he said, and he wasn’t so drunk that he didn’t instantly regret saying it, and he felt a blush rise immediately to his cheeks. He should stop now. Just take it back and change the subject.
“Because you think they’re too simple.”
John considered this, sipping from his pint of Stella. Greg wasn’t wrong. Though John didn’t necessarily think the idea of soul mates was rubbish, that was a can of existential worms he was not prepare to open, and he certainly didn’t need the term applied to him and Sherlock.
And, maybe it was because he was tipsy, or maybe it was because he was just so used to being able to say
That was absolutely
— immeasurably heightened. He was both pleased and disturbed when, with complete insouciance, Sherlock stretched one of his legs over John’s knees in an almost possessive manner. This, too, was not entirely unusual, nor was John placing his free hand over Sherlock’s socked ankle whilst his other clicked the remote.
John blushed harder. “Stop being obtuse. What do you think about when you—” He made a vague hand gesture.
Instead of trying to unpack that, John simply replied “Ah,
John grimaced. “I didn’t really know what I was looking for.” He was aware, on a peripheral level, that there was a whole culture of terminology that he was unfamiliar with. He just wasn’t sure where to start.
Seeming to grow bored with John’s fumbling, Sherlock pushed back his chair and stood, taking his mug of coffee with him as he exited the kitchen. As John sat at the kitchen table, stewing in his own embarrassment and horror, he heard Sherlock set down the mug, and then the sound of him picking up his violin. A bow was drawn experimentally over strings once, twice.
“You’re not bothered by the violin by any chance, are you?”
“No love, not at all.”
...A middle-aged woman sipping sparkling water (frugal, or financially restricted) at a table to her left, leg angled towards the empty chair in front of her (waiting). Comfortable well-worn clothing and purse indicate likely meeting a long-time lover or a close friend, boring,
“It was not a guess, it was deduction. A rigorous scientific process I assure you, the same way I monitor my act and my audience, or a detective breaks down a crime scene,” Sherlock huffed. Internally though, she was preening, and she made sure to flair her skirt outwards with her next few steps so that they would float about her more attractively. Conversing with Johanna was much more enjoyable than she expected, and she had already redirected them to a longer route home three intersections ago. She hadn’t even felt irritated when her deduction about the sister Harry Watson turned out to be a brother instead –
I finally finished! Possibly still some edits in the future, but for the most part I feel good about this. Thank you for waiting, and I hope you enjoy!
. Ummmm caramel,” her eyes fluttered as another faint breeze wafted the warm scent throughout the alcove.
“That was amazing!” Johanna exclaimed as they rounded another corner. “I can follow the leap from my accent to my London childhood, but my grandmother? And guessing elemental magic from water stains on and uncrumpled newspaper, that’s just, amazing!” She smiled up ad Sherlock, leaning infinitesimally closer in her excitement. The movement was so subtle Sherlock almost didn’t notice. Almost.
(See the end of the chapter for
I hope you enjoyed the story! It was very fun to write, if a little slow at times. Next chapter is the picture I promised from Ch1 which was a big inspiration for me, as well as a short epilogue!
“Of course,” Sherlock nodded, “your grandmother was clearly very important to you during your childhood in London.” She allowed a charming smile into her expression. “I’m terribly sorry for causing you distress. My apartment is only a few minutes from here. Stop by and let me offer you some warm food and dry clothes.” She refused to glance in the direction of mug, vaguely wondering if she could vanish its insultingly warm contents without being noticed.
“I'm terribly sorry to bother you, but it seems you have my umbrella." The woman, Joanne, held out her hand in greeting as she waited patiently for Sherlock’s response. Sherlock took her hand, intrigued. Her warmth was a pleasant spark of sensation against Sherlock’s palm, and their eyes seemed to lock across the space between them. Caramel Sun met cerulean Earth. Two planets crossing paths, slotting into their new orbits as natural as gravity. (though Sherlock could never bother to remember which went around the other). Her fingers tingled, and the place where Johanna’s fingers just brushed the inside of her wrist seem to have strung a thread that connected directly from her pulse to her heart. Sherlock took a steading breath.
Sherlock had been caught up in Johanna’s blissful expression, but quickly recovered. “It’s something new I’ve been working on, an illusion of sorts,” she explained, “I started with simple physics, waves, interference, optics, reflection and refraction. I wanted to see how much of it I could apply and use in my techniques with water.” Her breath suddenly became shaky as she felt Johanna’s thumb gently stroke her palm.
Suffice it to say, Johanna couldn’t keep her eyes off her. “I simply find your abilities so incredible that they seem to surpass science and approach the fantastical. Speaking of which,” she stepped beyond Sherlock’s arm and turned to face her, “I was wondering if you tell me more about elemental magic.” She grinned sheepishly, hoping her request wasn’t rude by some unknown magical social convention. “My grandmother passed away when I was still quite young, and no one else in our family even knew about her gift. I only have these magical objects she’s left with me and some vague childhood memories of her stories. I would love to know more about her and how all this,” she gestured to the mug and umbrella, “works.” Sherlock stopped walking as well.
“Sherlock,” she greeted. “Thank you for waiting. Usually I wouldn’t chase someone down the street for this kind of thing, but that umbrella is an heirloom of sorts for me, and I would be devastated if it was lost.” She shuffled and adjusted the soggy newspaper under her arm. Perhaps she was not as unaffected as she wished to portray either. A plan for answers quickly took shape.
To the restaurant's benefit, the cozy little establishment was a comfortable respite, it's warmth made even more appealing in contrast to the harsh weather. Men and women sat across circular tables ensconced in dim lamplight like partners intermingling on the dance floor. Intricate, carved wooden panel walls between the floor-length windows added to the ballroom feel. Servers periodically appeared and disappeared from the folds of a large velvet curtain covering the back of the room with trays and glasses, so what lay behind must be the kitchen. The atmosphere was casual but tasteful, and soft jazz drifted from a hidden gramophone. Sherlock gestured at the nearest attendant for a warmer refill of her beverage, and casually crossed her legs, allowing a little extra breeze to catch on her dress skirt with the motion. She allowed her gaze to drift over the other customers while she waited, toes wriggling in relief as water finally cleared a little from inside her heels. In the background a more familiar song came on...
“Of course, pardon my word use,” Johanna replied, sincere. Sherlock’s intelligence was captivating, and yet her hesitant and awkward interactions showed her nerves, and how unfamiliar she was with compliments and flirtation.
she had sighed,
“Every reason?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“How did –” Johanna’s voice cut off as Sherlock pulled her under the umbrella by their still clasped hands. Before she could react, Sherlock reached around for her own rather ineffective umbrella, folding it up and casually letting the motion carry her arm to rest gently on Johanna’s shoulder. Johanna blinked and seemed to lose her train of thought. She changed her line of inquiry, “but I couldn’t possibly impose-” Sherlock interrupted her again, guiding her slightly closer so that they were both completely out of the rain. She resolutely ignored the sound of her own heart pounding loud enough to reach her ears.
“Move in with me.”
“The senses are redirected from a known source you see, same with the smells. The light from the streetlamps can be filtered, concentrated, and distorted, the temperature I can control with air and humidity, and of course the pines come from the public park a few blocks down which could have complicated things because of the distance except I know exactly where the trees are located.” She was babbling now, but Johanna had closed the distance between them with a step and she could not stop, kept babbling, “Although, I do apologize for the caramel, I hadn’t meant to do that but we’re right beside a bakery and I must have been distracted by the colour of your eyes –” she finally fell silent, horrified and embarrassed. Johanna simply reached up and cupped her cheek with one hand.

- the thought came unbidden, and Sherlock blushed at her reaction as the woman offered her hand.
She could see her apartment from where they had stopped. There was no more time for delay.
The waiter had returned with another cup of Jasmine tea, but Sherlock ignored it and reached for her wallet. She was dry enough, and clearly tired. The storm was unrelenting but at least she would be able to use her skills freely at home. Drying off would only take a few seconds instead of minutes of slight of hand. She stood up, put on her trench coat, and grabbed her umbrella from among the multitudes in stand before heading out the door.
“Sherlock,” Johanna breathed in wonder. “This – this is
, she chided herself.
Sherlock blinked in surprise, the fabric of her blouse sleeves fluttering for a fraction of a second as her attention shifted from air drying them. Why did she stop? What had caught her attention? She examined the evidence again. Her age, lack of company (single), the newspaper, hair colour, beverage, nothing seemed out of place. Normal. Boring. Except Sherlock had subconsciously determined that something was out of plac- the newspaper! A second look confirmed it. The newspaper was completely dry and unfolded. The woman had to have bought it from the stand across the road recently, and yet it shouldn't be possible for it to be untouched by water even if she had transportation, not with the wind as it was. The mug too seemed strange. The homemade tea was steaming hot, but it was very unlikely that any insulation would've been sufficient after traveling in this weather, and then being left in the open. Her jacket and shoes were completely clean and dry, no mud or water splatters to be seen. Stranger and stranger. It was almost as if -
No, she was being ridiculous. Normally Sherlock would never dismiss her deductions so carelessly, but the chances of her meeting another elemental were so negligible they frankly did not even warrant consideration. She was an elemental, a true magician, the only one in the world, and that was that.
“Alright, yes. Let’s go see your flat tomorrow.”
Dream a little dream of me
...A woman (same age with an error range of 2 years) seated alone at a table across the room, figure partially obscured by the newspapers in her hand (most likely from the stand across the road), only blond hair visible behind the pages she perused and a steaming mug of homemade tea beside a croissant on the table, borin- wait, no.
(See the end of the chapter for
Johanna smiled. “Yes,” she said simply, realizing the truth of it, and her eyes closed. As she waited, the sound of wind and rain grew muted and silent, the drip drop of water from roofs and into gutters ceased their sounds. Suddenly the air seemed crisp and cool. A gentle breeze carried whispers of pine, conjured in her mind images of forests and flowing rivers and snow capped mountains in the distance.
But in your dreams whatever they be
Johanna smiled, still holding her hand.
Sherlock mentally braced herself against the cold and wet, wrapping her collar up high against her neck and clutching the umbrella tightly. Luckily it seemed the wind had died down a bit and she walked quickly towards her apartment, only a few minutes away. As she turned the corner, a faint voice called out in the distance. Looking back the streets were empty save for a few runners on their way home like her, so Sherlock kept walking. But the voice slowly became louder.
Sherlock couldn’t help laughing with her at the ridiculous situation, and couldn’t ignore the sinking feeling in her chest when she then revealed she would be flying back tomorrow now that her visit was done. More pressingly, she couldn’t will away the blush she was sure was still colouring her face, had been since two streets back when Johanna had casually slipped a hand in her pocket with an offhand comment about cold fingers and warm dry coats. Surely, she had not fallen so far as to let her transport be affected by these clichéd gestures. Sherlock refused to meet those beautiful caramel eyes staring up at her and looked resolutely forward.
“You can open them now,” Sherlock squeezed her hands lightly. Johanna did, and gasped. Around her the rainwater seemed to have lost their direction, dancing freely as they came together and split into bodies of water in different shapes and sizes. Dancing spirals, smooth spheres, and faceted jewels cut so sharp they seemed like ice floated free of gravity, perfectly formed for seconds before they dissolved back into raindrops and transformed into something new. The little alcove seemed to glow with refracted light, and Johanna would have believed it then if Sherlock had told her it was early dawn instead of nighttime. The darkened and damp Paris streets outside their little bubble were forgotten, reality rendered a mirage.
“Why?”
John punched him in the shoulder, but Greg just laughed.
“What is it?”
“John.”
They were opening the back door of the ambulance, two paramedics hoisting in a gurney. A body on the gurney. A body strapped down, with bandages covering one of its arms, its side, an oxygen mask going over it’s face—
Two days later, John entered the inpatient ward of Bart’s hospital. He had a messenger bag with Sherlock’s laptop and several books, and a handful of flowers—
The paramedic shook her head, holding up a hand against John. “Sorry, I can’t—”
, I would be most grateful. And, if you’re really that curious, go ask Mycroft; he seems to think that he has my psyche inventoried well enough.”
Sherlock put on such a front for the rest of the world. He seldom presented himself without a full suit of armour (minus that one trip to Buckingham Palace). John always felt oddly privileged to see Sherlock like this: unadorned, unconcerned. Content.
John considered simply the term
The question caught John off guard. Truth be told, he had gotten side-tracked by terminology to define their individual . . . well, beings that he somewhat neglected his original search. “Bromance?” he hazarded.
am not bothered by what other people think of us. As far as I’m concerned, we are Sherlock Holmes and John Watson and, whatever that means, the rest of the world can bugger off.”
“Nothing else?”
Thinking that they had reached the abrupt end of the conversation, John had put his hand over his mouth and was staring at where Sherlock had been sitting, contemplating his own self-preservation instincts. He nearly jumped when Sherlock called from the other room, over the sound of a plaintive g minor scale:
“They already think we’re dating.”
with him, you know?”
,” John said, authoritatively, even angrily, giving emphasis to the word, “and I’m going with him.”
“What do I think about what?”
“Yes, but now you’ve given them concrete proof. You might as well buy me a ring.”
John laughed, an incredulous bark. “
show gratitude for the first, but would definitely be disdainful for the second. He would appreciate both, though, John knew.
Despite himself, John felt a blush creep up his neck. He
was out. That was fine with John. It felt like a throwaway term, anway—more flippant than was desirous and, upon further reading, seemed (in some contexts) to have similar connotations as
Namely that Sherlock, for all he knew, had never had a relationship or encounter that John knew of. And, there was a very Sherlockian explanation for all of that, but there could also be another. . . .
In fact, John managed to put the issue more-or-less on the backburner for several days. A new case had come up, which helped immensely: a string of murders, done in pairs, all the victims couples, and linked by seemingly nothing. Sherlock was all in a frenzy over it, spending all night in the morgue with the bodies (and Molly), running experiments in both the lab at Bart’s and at their kitchen table, and in general having a grand time. John, as per usual, got sucked into the imbroglio, was more than happy to come along, really. But, as it happened, the last two couples that were murdered were gay; this, somehow, heightened the scrutiny of all involved on John and Sherlock, and John once again began to research and re-evaluate.
John gave a slight nod. “So should you.”
“A bit, yeah.”
“I continue to be baffled as to why you care what other people think.”
“That’s the entire point. People make all sorts of assumptions and it’s just . . . not
Sherlock frowned and, surprising John, stood up from the table. He walked over to where John was leaning and didn’t stop until he was right in John’s space. The wrinkle from earlier made a reappearance and, this close up, John could see clearly the dark circles forming under Sherlock’s eyes. But the eyes themselves were clear and alert, and he surveyed John intently.
joking. . . .”
No one, but John.
Once John stopped coughing, he stared into his beer and sighed, somewhat pathetically. “Yeah, right.”
“Lestrade, I presume?”
Sherlock sat back in his chair, looking lazy and lofty. “Frankly, I don’t care what people think. You know that.” He studied John for a moment before continuing. “But, if it bothers
Sherlock continued to watch John watch him, and for several long moments, neither of them said anything. Finally, it was Sherlock who broke.
to Sherlock, but John found himself blurting: “I still don’t know what to call us.”
Sherlock continued to stare, his gaze utterly reptilian.
It didn’t matter how or how many times he said it, people just seemed not to get it. Even his slew of girlfriends (who, though their association was short-lived, usually had ample and earnest example of his heterosexual inclinations) exited the relationship with the accusation, almost admonition:
, or because you’re . . . ?” he couldn’t actually bring himself to finish, not wanting to put words in Sherlock’s mouth. He needn’t have worried.
“I’ll go to bed if you will.”
After that, John had let the conversation go and joined Greg in enjoying the game. He still wasn’t satisfied, but it was pointless to stew over just now, when there was easier conversation to be had and a close match to watch.
John was just beginning to contemplate how pathetic that seemed when Sherlock, with a shrug and lassiez-faire that was almost shocking, said, “All right, then.” He gestured to the hallway leading to the stairs. “After you.”
“Perhaps, another time.”
This, thankfully, dissolved some of the tension in the room and caused Sherlock to snort. “Too right.” A thoughtful pause. “And yet, here we are.”
“So, what? Your goal is to find a term that explains away,” he mimicked John’s earlier gesticulation, “
Sherlock waited.
“You should sleep.”
“I’m sure there’s a bird out there who doesn’t mind that you’re—what was it—
He looked over at Sherlock then, who was staring at him intently over the screen of the laptop. His pale face and crystalline eyes were eerily illuminated by the blue of the screen; it should have made his expression more intense, but there was a softness about his gaze that couldn’t be described.
“Wait!” John yelled, possibly too loudly, but he didn’t care. “I’m coming with you.”
Sherlock turned the page, still not looking up. In a bored (and slightly annoyed) tone, he asked: “Whatever do you mean?”
Sherlock blinked, an odd mix of weariness and surprise flitting across his features. He crossed his arms over his chest, tilting his head. “It’s still bothering you.”
When he entered, Sherlock was laid back on the bed. As John approached, Sherlock’s closed eyelids flickered. And, as John sat down, they finally cracked open, the blue of them appearing almost too bright in the harsh hospital lighting. Sherlock licked his lips.
John shook his head, smiling slightly. “Nothing.”
However, whilst DI Lestrade definitely fell into the category of NSY, Greg the drinking buddy was fair game, and John found himself bringing up his latest predicament over pints a week later.
“You’re . . . not interested in people. . . .”
Sherlock rolled his eyes but John, in his dru—
He didn’t
I know fuck all about rugby, I am sorry.
Sherlock swept further into the kitchen, his blue silk dressing gown fluttering around him, before settling into the chair opposite John and reading aloud, “’More than best friends’?  ‘Nonsexual partnership? ‘Intense male friendship’?”
John felt the colour drain from his own face. “You’re
John nodded with relief. “God, please.”
“Why do you hate all my girlfriends?”
John nodded, something like relief flooding him. “Great.” And then, because he could think of little else to say and desperately wanted to change the subject. “Toast?”
“Mm.”
“. . . because you’re—” and here, John waved a hand at him, “—
John picked up his fork, hesitating briefly before stabbing into the eggs. He began eating quietly, watching as Sherlock doctored up a cup of tea with milk and a teaspoon of sugar. It was only when he was done stirring and bringing the tea to his lips that Sherlock finally looked over at John.
“Well, if I ever got another girlfriend, it would be their business too. But maybe that’s a big If.”
want to know. “Just— in general?”
Sherlock was quiet, considering. “It’s never bothered you before.”
John blinked. “Is that my laptop?” It was a stupid question.
Sherlock, knew him more profoundly than he had ever known another human. It often felt that there were no secrets between them, but this conversation was causing John to realize that there were, perhaps, boundaries that they had not yet pushed with each other, places in each other’s minds that they had not explored. Were they ready for such a thing?
The words were said with such a matter-of-fact tone that John couldn’t help the bark of a laugh that escaped him. Sherlock stopped briefly to look over at John a grin before returning to his work.
“That’s
They had been standing in the closet for several minutes, waiting for all signs and sounds of the watchman to fade, when John found himself whispering doubtfully:
“Oh, we’re not a couple,” he found himself saying yet again, this time to the mother of one of the victims. He shouldn’t have said anything—the woman was in utter distress and had thought it sweet that John “and his boyfriend” were so invested in solving this case, which she mistook to be a hate crime against homosexuality. It wasn’t— the previous three couples had been heterosexual— but John really should have just kept his mouth shut, because the woman looked rather embarrassed and crestfallen all at once, and had dissolved into tears again, precluding any further questioning.
Sherlock kept his attention on the eggs, but offered his own “morning” in response. Sherlock was still dressed for bed, his white undershirt rumpled and his blue dressing gown hanging off his narrow frame. His hair was wild, curls spilling everywhere. He was barefoot.
been asking whether or not Sherlock had any kind of sex drive, but this question got at the same issue. “Erm, yes.”
Sherlock clicked around whatever page or document he was perusing and answered distractedly. “I don’t hate them, I simply find them annoying.”
After a few seconds, Sherlock began typing again, and the sound lulled John into the sense of ease that had previously enveloped them. He had just landed on a crime docu when something made him ask.
“Is there something you’re trying to tell me?” he asked. His tone was somewhat bored, but it usually was at this time of morning, on Sundays when there wasn’t a case on.
“I see.”
The next morning, John awoke with what he might call a very wee, very insignificant hangover. He groaned as he turned over, mostly for the sake of groaning. He was more than a little surprised to find a tall glass of water and paracetamol on his bedside table.
state, thought he could detect a certain amount of affection there.
of John’s habits, even his masturbatory ones. He was sure that Sherlock was completely aware of each time John did, though he generally considerate (or careless) enough to not deduce it to John’s face. This was actually one of the few times he had ever mentioned it, and it was not derisive, but still somewhat embarrassing. If John had decent self-preservation instincts when it came to Sherlock, he would have, again, dropped the conversation there; but his own curiosity was a killing force, apparently, not to be denied. He found himself blurting:
romantically involved. And he was staring at the TV listlessly, contemplating this, when Sherlock piped up:
At this, Sherlock lowered the newspaper and looked squarely at John over the edge. His expression was oddly patient. “You mean, ‘Do I masturbate?’”
His voice was scratchy and dry. John got the cup of water and straw from Sherlock’s bedside and, once Sherlock had raised his bed to a gently reclining position, John helped Sherlock drink some of the water.
“Not patently obvious to everyone,” John pointed out, spearing one of his kippers. He had made a large batch this morning and, though Sherlock insisted he wasn’t hungry, small pieces kept disappearing from John’s plate when he wasn’t looking. There was also more syrup on John’s plate than he remembered putting there in the first place.
“Yes.” There was a tilt to Sherlock’s voice that suggested he was frowning.
, he thought to himself,
about Sherlock. And everything else. And, by the time they were finishing their second pint, John was spilling to Greg this “new”
The tone of the question was gentler than John had expected, and when he looked into Sherlock’s face, there was a genuine and un-snide curiosity there.
The thought stayed with him for some time, as did the ghost of the feeling. That overwhelming rush of sensation in the heat of the moment, which faded into a quiet sense of comfort once they were back at the flat. The strange, easy feeling which John now recognized as utter contentment when he and Sherlock were simply sitting in the same room. It felt familiar to John.
“How are you feeling?”
In a slow and deliberate manner, Sherlock folded the paper and set it on the table. He picked up his Bart’s mug with both hands, and took a purposeful drink of his coffee. He then looked at John over the rim of the mug, which hid his mouth as he locuted in the most exquisite deadpan:
“Sherlock?”
, a term that Harry had thoroughly disabused him of many years hence.
true? Do you even know? Maybe instead of defining it for other people, you ought to define it for yourself. Assuming
“I don’t see why you need to name it,” Greg said somewhat distractedly, watching a ruck on the screen. “People are gonna think what they want. They already do.”
John cleared his throat. “But, no need to tread further if you’d rather not.”
John clambered into the cramped ambulance, relieved, trying to stay out of the paramedic’s way as she got Sherlock’s vitals, applied pressure to the wound at his side, but still
Later, as they were both (respectively) going to bed, John looked up on his phone a term that he had read several days ago:
But it did occur to John how, perhaps,
“Oh, the usual. Experiments. Murder.”
Sherlock watched John assess his own intoxicated state without a trace of annoyance—which was strange, but becoming less so as time wore on. His voice, when he spoke next, was not necessarily gentle, but it lacked Sherlock’s usual stringency.
“You arsehole.”
“No, I’m just— I’m just tired of people making
Greg hummed to himself and downed the rest of his beer, setting the glass with a
“Have you ever been in love?”
Not the way people think of. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. It just isn’t them.
there.” A flicker of memory passed across Sherlock’s face.
“We’re not a couple,” John said. Found himself saying. Repeatedly. Weekly. On a case-by-case basis. To several people more than once.
With some bemusement, John made his way up the stairs leaning heavily on the bannister, Sherlock following behind. He said nothing, not even to chide the obvious listing in John’s climb or the slow clumsiness of his ascent. When John reached the top of the stairs, he waited for Sherlock to climb the last few steps for reasons unknown to himself.
occurrence, but it happened rarely enough that John could name every instance.
John frowned, his blush deepening. “What else was I supposed to say? I was scared they weren’t going to let me come with you.”
Sherlock considered him for a moment, blue-grey eyes nearly unreadable. (John thought, for a moment, that he detected a spark of mirth there, but it was gone before he could examine it more closely.) Then, Sherlock turned his attention back to the paper.
