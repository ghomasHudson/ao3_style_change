Sherlock raised his head and kissed the other boy gently on the lips. "Thank you," he whispered and hugged him.
John tried to be as reassuring for Sherlock as possible while they were in the car, smiling back and rubbing his thumb over the back of his fiance's hand. When they finally came face to face with their lawyer, John smiled at her and shook her hand, waiting for Sherlock to do the same before he gently pulled him over to the table. He sat down side by side with Sherlock, keeping a tight hold to make sure that Sherlock knew he was there for him.
John squeezed Sherlock's hand, slinging his bag over the opposite shoulder. "As I'll ever be," he said. As he had said to Sherlock before, it was one step closer to finally getting Moran the punishment he deserved. He was actually very ready.
John let out a sigh of relief through the kiss. He still felt like a jerk, but at least Sherlock didn't blame him. That made him feel a bit better. After a moment he pulled away, resting his forehead against his fiance's. "I'm also sorry...so sorry...that he ever touched you." He stroked his fingers down Sherlock's face as his eyes started to glisten with tears again. "But I also want to tell you how much I admire you. I can't think of anyone who would even still be here after everything that you've had to deal with. You're so strong, so brave...You're my hero." He gave Sherlock a watery smile.
Sherlock shook his head, "no, I'm not," he murmured, looking down at their joined hands. He knew better than to lie to John again, his fiancé knew him better than anyone. "I really want your father to like me. I realise that sounds completely juvenile, but... I do." He bit his lip and rubbed his thumbs along the back of the other boy's hands.
Sherlock grinned widely and dunked one of his hands under the water. He grabbed onto John's crotch and started stroking him underwater through his trunks.
Sherlock refused to move, he wasn't going to leave John to face this alone. Sebastian's grip on the gun got tighter. "Shut up! Just shut up! It's all your fault! You fucking
Sherlock continued to pound into his lover, unable to do anything more than pant and moan at this point. He could sense that they were both close to the edge and let go of the headboard, grabbing hold of John's right leg and propping it up on his shoulder. He widened his stance a little in order to hit his fiance's prostate dead on with every thrust.
John took Sherlock's wrist in hand, holding it there so he could turn to kiss the palm of his hand. "You aren't a coward. There's nothing wrong with not wanting to talk about something that scarred you like that." He looked up at Sherlock and smiled, sliding his hand up to lace their fingers. "I'll be fine tomorrow. As long as you're there."
Sherlock groaned as John's finger penetrated him, remembering how amazing this could be from the last time John had fingered him... had it been just this morning? Didn't matter, this was...
John leaned into the touch and kissed Sherlock back. "Morning," he said when he pulled back. He looked up at Sherlock, seeing his bed-tousled hair and the sleep just barely present in his eyes. Sherlock was gorgeous like this. "I quite like you being the first thing I see in the morning," John said, running a hand through his curls.
Ms. Rodin was shuffling papers and had moved all chairs but one to the other side of the room. She looked up as they entered and smiled, "John, take a seat here next to the table. Sherlock, I need you to sit over there." She pointed to one of the chairs at the far end of the room and Sherlock swallowed but obeyed, looking back nervously at John.
Sherlock moaned softly and pulled away after a few moments, resting their foreheads together. "Okay... unless you want to be late for school, we really have to stop," he murmured.
Sherlock grasped onto John's hips, pulling him up into a kneeling position as he increased the rate of his thrusts. "Ohhhh, yes, love. Come for me... Let me hear you.
Sherlock smiled, "you really don't ha-..." he started, but was interrupted when John flipped them over. "Well, okay... if you insist," he chuckled and it quickly turned into a moan as he felt John's lips on his skin. He reached down to stroke his fingers through his boyfriend's hair softly.
John moved up Sherlock's thigh, passing over his groin without stopping, and then hit the other with the same attention. He was going to make Sherlock crazy, he knew, but it was too much fun. John moved back to the center, lips inches from Sherlock's cock. "Lift your hips for me."
"Or to punch him in the face," John added. He'd forgotten that during the trial they would actually have to come face to face with the bastard who almost killed both of them simultaneously.
... John! You're so good... s-so incredible." Sherlock groaned and arched his back into his lover, starting to rock his own hips to meet his husband's thrusts.
Sherlock sighed and pulled back far enough to look down into John's eyes. He cupped his cheek and smiled, "I'll see you at school tomorrow, yeah? Meet you out front." Sherlock leaned down and gave his fiancé a loving kiss, then rested their foreheads together. He didn't want to let him go, wishing that they could just stay together all the time. But he knew that wasn't possible, at least not right now.
"Mmm," Sherlock hummed, "maybe... how long does it usually take your father to cook dinner?" He nuzzled into John's neck, inhaling his scent.
John didn't understand what Sherlock meant until he started to undo his trousers. He bit his lip as Sherlock's fingers ghosted over him and he let go of him for a moment to brush Sherlock's hands away. He opened his trousers, pulling them and his pants down together and kicking them off. John straddled Sherlock, rocking into him with a groan.
Sherlock smiled at John and turned towards the minister, "I'll go first." He took a deep breath and cleared his throat a little.
John grinned back at her, though her sitting with them had been rather unexpected. Though he guessed that this sort of thing was going to start happening more now that they weren't the target of a crazed bully. "Hi, Mary. We're fine. How are you?"
John sighed, resting his cheek in Sherlock's hair. He still felt terribly guilty, and completely unworthy of Sherlock's love when all he had brought him since they got together was pain. "Are you sure I'm not an idiot?" he asked softly.
He gently laid him on the bed before climbing in with him and pulling him into an embrace. Of course, he was careful to avoid all his injuries as he did so. "How do you feel, darling?" he asked gently, stroking Sherlock's hair.
John's head whipped around to face Mary at the touch, eyes wide with fear and worry. But she was right, nothing he was doing was working, and he pulled out his mobile to call for an ambulance. When they said they were on their way he pulled Sherlock into his lap and cradled him close, crying softly into his shoulder. Sherlock's limp body was bringing back horrible memories from the day of the shooting, and he had to grab his wrist, keeping his finger on the other boy's pulse to remind him that he was indeed alive.
John smiled up at Sherlock and took his hand to stand. "Well, this is convenient since we're in the shower already," he said with a light laugh. He lifted his hand toward the spray, rinsing off Sherlock's cum where it had splattered on him.
"Let me guess. That Moran bastard attacked you because of your relationship with Sherlock?" Mr. Watson said before he could say anything.
"You're not an outcast anymore," John pointed out. "In fact, you're probably considered popular now, or on your way. People are probably going to want to talk to you, and you might get separated from me in all the commotion..." He looked up, the worry genuine in his eyes.
"Yes, it is... Ow!" Sherlock grabbed John by the wrists, "not fair," he said and stuck his tongue out. He let go of the other boy's hands, "no more," he murmured and brought his hands up to rub his sore nipples.
Sherlock smiled up at John and took his pants off with his teeth, knowing how crazy it drove his lover when he'd undone his trousers like this. Once the pants were off, he licked a line up the underside of John's cock, right along the pulsing vein there. He lightly kissed the tip of his arousal, but then switched to kissing along his hipbones. Sherlock gripped to his lover's waist, pushing him down into the bed to keep him from bucking up as he teased him.
Sherlock grabbed John's hand as they went down the stairs towards his motorbike. "So... your father knows we're already having sex?" He said, eyes twinkling as he tried not to laugh.
Sherlock lead them through the foyer to the side dining room. It was smaller than the dining hall where they had dinner the other night and was reserved for more intimate dinners like this one. He pulled out a chair for John, "Mother and father will be joining us any moment," he said and took his seat next to his boyfriend.
John felt his heart break listening to Sherlock. "No, Sherlock, look at me," he said, gently turning his face back. "Of course I don't regret helping you. I wouldn't change anything that happened that day." He leaned in and kissed him softly.
John shivered at Sherlock's voice in his ear but he tried to keep cool. "Watch it, Sherlock, or I might just drag you to a broom cupboard and pin you to the wall." He rolled his hips back subtly, so that if anyone saw it they would think he was just shifting his position.
"I would have to agree with you on that," Sherlock said and kissed him quickly again before moving off of his hips. "I've gotten some clothes together for you," he nodded towards the end of the bed, "you can grab some breakfast before we head out, I think I smelled french toast cooking after I got out of the shower, I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
"Where'ya goin' so fast?" one of them slurred. "We jus' got here, an' you're lookin' sexy." They all laughed as if she had said something hilarious, and he found himself getting sick with the alcohol on their breath. He took the opportunity while they were swaying unsteadily with giggles and ran off, managing to get away from the dance floor and to the edge of the house.
Sherlock stepped in after John, his front to his lover's back. He reached up to begin massaging his shoulders, leaning forward and kissing the nape of his neck.
John was already shaking as Sherlock continued to stretch him out. He clutched at the leather of the ottoman, pushing his hips back as far as he could.
John finally found a spot outside at one of the older benches where no one sat. He set his tray down and started to eat, looking up at the passing clouds overhead
Sherlock came at the same moment that John reached his orgasm and he closed his eyes to focus on breathing properly again. He panted for several minutes and pulled John fully on top of him. "Christ..." he breathed and rubbed his hands softly up and down his lover's back.
John held Sherlock close, pressing their foreheads together. "I couldn't have said that better myself."
Sherlock hummed in agreement and moved forward to grab onto John's hips, kissing the top of his shoulder. "Yeah, I don't think I could spare another drop." He chuckled and rested his chin on the other boy's shoulder.
"Now, John... I can't have you going to prison for assault. How would I live without you for that long?" Sherlock said firmly. "I know it will be hard, trust me... but you'll have to try and contain yourself."
! His head fell back with a moan and he bucked up into Sherlock's mouth. For someone inexperienced he was incredible at this.
John moaned and let Sherlock keep going, having a feeling he knew what was coming. And the prospect of it only made him more anxious for it. But he stayed patient, relaxing under the soothing touch of his lover's skilled hands. "Bloody violinist," he muttered with a smirk.
Sherlock hissed in pleasure as John's nails dug into his skin. He gripped tighter to his lover's hips in response and started moaning steadily as John kept slamming himself down onto his cock.
John shuddered as Sherlock's fingers trailed down his body and he made a choked sound when Sherlock's hips rubbed up against his. Alright, he was definitely at least bisexual, because he had absolutely no problem with the growing bulge he could feel in Sherlock's trousers. He let himself be pulled down and licked his lips before capturing Sherlock's, rocking his hips forward.
John frowned a little in thought. "Well... I mean, I'm sure he'll be fine. He approves of us, so I would think he would approve of everything." He rested his head on Sherlock's shoulder. "If he doesn't, I'm going to marry you anyway. Nothing and no one can keep us apart."
Mycroft nodded, "good... Let's go back in now, before he gets suspicious." He led John back into the room and smiled at Sherlock, "he's all yours, Sherly..."
"Okay, I think we should be good now. Wanna head up to the house and grab a quick shower before the lawyer gets here?" Sherlock asked and stood, holding his hand out for John to take.
Sherlock chuckled and nudged John's shoulder, trying to get him to look at him. "Really? Why did it scare you?" he asked, genuinely curious.
did he love the feel of John underneath him. He moaned and let his head crane back, giving his boyfriend more access to his long neck. Soon the movements of his hips got more frantic and he reached down to grab onto his lover's sides, pulling him into harder thrusts.
Harris was having a serious think about using his socks as a gag. Risking frostbite seemed worth the trouble.
Aftereffects of the cabbie's drug, he knew, tricking his body, weakening his control, not his fault, and he thrust away a lingering dream fragment: strong hands holding him down, his hair pulled tight, his throat exposed, teeth on his nipple, a voice murmuring, “Brilliant. Amazing. Brilliant.”
“—depression and anxiety. Do not give me that look, Mycroft Holmes. They are serious and well documented sequelae of a heart attack and they increase your risk of sudden death. Do you understand me?”
John had so far been irrationally resistant to Sherlock's suggestions that he dispense with the social niceties of courtship and simply hire a professional when he felt the need (which would accomplish the same goal but take up far less of John's time), insisting emotional connection was integral to his enjoyment. Sherlock had very nearly questioned how John's masturbation fit into this frame, but a certain tightness about John's jaw suggested his mind had already beaten Sherlock there and Sherlock's kidneys would become intimately acquainted with John's boot if those words were ever uttered.
“I'm here, I'm here. My phone was charging. Ah, my back can't take one of those pub chairs, but I'll bring beer if you want to watch the game at your place.”
his motherfucking careers. And now his heats. One fucking bullet, and everything that made him worth anything at all, gone.
. It exists whether or not we ever acknowledge it. I choose to accept fact and acknowledge it, however inconvenient it may be, in this part of my life as in all others. I’ve told you this repeatedly. Do you not listen at all?”
thought John, because even as his gut twisted with fear for Sherlock, even as he acknowledged he could never hope to match wits on equal terms with the men playing this game of little kings and kingdoms, even as he checked his gun and accepted that someone might die tonight—himself, Sherlock, the colonel, some other man by John's own hand—even so, he felt the bright thrill of excitement and pure joy that right now, whatever came later, at this moment he was alive and fully engaged and his world was not boring at all, not in the slightest.
Greg stripped off the condom and flipped him onto his belly, smearing the fine sheets. “Let me fuck you,” he said, and it came out less commanding and more pleading than he'd intended. “You can manage twice tonight, yeah? You can have me after,” he promised, and shuddered because oh, God, yes,
"There y'are, sir. Looks right smart on you, that does. Should do it like that at home." And the barber had tried to sell him a tube of product that smelled subtly manly and cost fifteen pounds. John had declined but had been tempted, because women liked it when a bloke made an effort. It really had made his hair look...good. Great. Sexy, even.
"He refused to be treated until he could see you, Sir," the bodyguard offered with an air of a man ensuring that responsibility for possible gangrene would not fall to him.
John crouched and bent his head to peer at the soil, giving Greg an unimpeded view of the deep purple bitemarks that covered the back of his neck from hairline to neckline. He lifted his eyes hastily and intercepted Sherlock's smirk just before the git dropped off the railing, stepping up close behind John to lean down along his back and point to the ground.
He stepped into the hallway to phone his brother. "Stay at the flat and don't go haring off," he said. "I may have located him and it would be beyond ridiculous to miss him in passing. Furthermore, you and I are going to discuss revised security measures because this absurd series of coincidences could be deliberately manufactured with remarkable ease."
Not having had any basis for comparison at the time, Sherlock had dismissed John's remark about sex being better with someone you cared about as more of the cloying nonsense he was given to spouting when discussing his refusal to take a more practical approach to obtaining sexual release.
Shut up. For once, Christ, shut up and listen because I can't see any way this," he gestured between the two of them, "can work if you don't get it: my work matters. It matters to me, it matters to my patients, and it fucking well ought to matter to you because you told me you wanted everything and this is part of everything. You don't get to pick and choose if you say I have to give you everything I am."
"You maintain there's some expression of truth in what bodies do, how they respond to each other," Sherlock said, breath hot on his neck and hands fisted in his shirt. "You need to be sure of it all, you said, of what you're getting. Then come to my bed."
"And destroy himself to get free, yes. He has done once already, or nearly so. I know you've little reason to trust me, but we are on the same side in this matter, you and I. I'm not a villain, John, despite what Sherlock thinks, and I cannot abide the waste of human potential."
The barber hadn't given any signs of noticing and John thought the sound of hairdryers had drowned him out. The rest of the cut had gone as usual, except that when the barber put away his clippers, he'd briskly slapped some unfamiliar product onto his palms and done...something...and at the end of it John's hair in the mirror was fashionably spiked.
"You're not serious," he said, but it was halfhearted at best, and Greg shut his eyes but could still hear the rustle of cloth that accompanied one grown man's shoving his hand into another grown man's front pocket.
“Uh, hi, Sherlock. This is Bill, Bill Murray. Um, our bank called to say that a rather large deposit was made into our account today, and I wondered if you'd done that? Because like I told you when we talked about it, I was there as a favour to John, you know, no payment necessary. Although it's very much appreciated; the roof's needed a bit of work and that would, uh, cover it. Also our daughter's just been given a scholarship to a public school and, you know, new uniforms and such, it all adds up. Yeah. Well. I just wanted to say thanks, if it was you, and, um, say hi to John for me. I hope his kidneys are better soon, and that you two are very happy together. Congratulations, by the way, in case I didn't say it before. John's a good man to have at your side. You won't find better.”
He'd see a solicitor on Monday, get the divorce started. He supposed it should have been harder, sadder, to put an end to things, but really, Holmes (twat though he was) had been right. She was cheating, had been for a long time, and the marriage never had been what it should have been. No, it wasn't hard.
"You're so good to me," Sherlock said and sighed happily. He stood and took John's hand, leading him to his bedroom. Without a word, he started undressing and got under the covers. "Come here... I don't want to do anything sexual, I just want to lay with you." He looked up at the other boy with a smile.
John went to sit next to him, hands on his knees, fingers tightening. "Is someone dead?" he blurted finally.
The defence lawyer relented and decided to pursue another angle. "In the short time you'd known my client, you had a few opportunities to have some conversations with him... Is it not true that at one point, you said that gay males 'freaked you out'?" He again glanced over to the rugby players, silently pointing out that he again had witnesses to the fact.
"Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock said, following John down the hall. He easily fell into step with the shorter boy, their arms brushing occasionally as they walked. "Your name is John... Watson, right?" he asked, his head tilting a little. He still felt nervous, not knowing how observant John was and trying to keep his thoughts in check, though he still maintained steady eye contact with him.
"What's that?" John and his father both asked at the same time. John was still confused as to how Sherlock could have possibly known what was going on, and what he could have planned.
Sherlock shivered and shook his head. "N-not at all, love," he said and forced a smile. He didn't move or turn his head because he knew if he did, his self control would shatter completely.
Mr. Watson grinned at him and patted Sherlock on the back. "Don't mention it. Now sit down and eat. You need some meat on those bones." John laughed a little and resumed his seat. He may have been missing a mother figure for a long time, but he was glad that he had his father instead of her.
John immediately snuggled back into Sherlock's arms when he returned and smiled up at him. "That would be very nice. I feel like you already have some ideas in mind," he teased, poking Sherlock in the nose. He tucked his head under Sherlock's chin and closed his eyes. He was so happy with him.
Sherlock whimpered, reaching up to tangle his fingers in John's hair as they kissed. He needed to feel John all over him, needed to forget all about the attacks. He bucked his hips up and slid both hands to his lover's hips, still keeping things slow and loving.
As John saw Moran preparing to kick the boy, he stood and pushed him backwards. "I don't beat up on people unless I have a good reason. And right now the only person I see who deserves a punch in the face is you." John stared defiantly at the older boy, arms crossed over his chest. He just wished he were a bit taller to complete his look of intimidation, but he did see some of the other rugby players backing away nervously.
John parked his bike outside and went up the stairs into the flat. "Da?" Mr. Watson was sitting in the living room, on the couch with his face in his hands. He looked up and sighed. "Come here, lad."
"It's alright. You needed to rest up. I wouldn't want you to hurt yourself for me." John giggled a little when he felt Sherlock sniffing him. "I probably smell like sweat and sex," he said.
Sherlock furrowed his brow in concern and laid a hand on John's shoulder. "John? Are you alright, love?" Siger stood from where he was sitting on the desk, "We can take a break if you need to," he offered.
Seeing John overcome with lust and writhing from his ministrations had brought him pretty close to the edge and he focused on backing himself away before settling himself between his lover's legs. He adjusted himself until his cock was pressed lightly against John's entrance and looked into his eyes. "Ready?" He said breathlessly, his body almost trembling in anticipation.
After a while, Sherlock let his head fall back onto the pillow. He gasped for breath and let out a shaky moan. "I love you so much, John Holmes-Watson," he breathed.
The next morning, Sherlock woke first and smiled at the face of his sleeping fiancé. He managed to get out of bed without waking him and tiptoed over to the window to grab his violin. He lifted it and rested it under his chin, raising the bow to start playing John's song.
Sherlock made his way down his lover's torso, kissing and nipping the skin until he made it to his trousers. He rested his hands on John's knees and unbuttoned and unzipped the trousers with his teeth, making sure John was watching him the whole time.
"Any time, dear! You're always welcome here," Mrs. Holmes said and smiled warmly at him. Sherlock grabbed John by the wrist and drug him out of the dining hall, trying to avoid his brother, but as they reached the door Mycroft was standing there with his arms across his chest.
Sherlock smiled, "I'll be right beside you," he said softly and leaned in to kiss his fiancé on the lips. He kept it slow and loving, closing his eyes into it.
John's eyes widened as he watched Sherlock's skilled mouth undo his trousers. "Oh, fuck..." He pushed his hips up, that last display of talent making him fully hard in an instant. "Please, Sherlock..."
John let his mouth fall open for Sherlock immediately. His hands settled on Sherlock's chest as their tongues tangled together. He was careful, however. He wanted to be extra gentle with Sherlock after his revelation. In no way did he ever want their intimacy to remind him of those terrible attacks.
yes... But don't think this is the only time I'll want you tonight," he smiled and winked up at John. "Right now though... I want you to ride me," he breathed and grabbed tightly to his fiancé's hips, pulling him into a slow grind.
John found his mouth hanging open a little as he watched Sherlock and he licked his lips. After a moment he blinked out of his trance and smacked him playfully on the shoulder before leaning close to whisper in his ear. "Don't get me started, or I'll wind up ripping that suit off of you in front of the whole party," he said, voice low.
... Sherlock..." This was certainly never something he would have thought could be so amazing, but it was. It
John smiled and laughed a little bit, "good to know." He pressed a few more kisses to Sherlock's lips, soft and gentle, showing just how scared he had been that he would never get to do this again. "God, Sherlock...I love you so, so much. I don't know if I could have lasted another day."
They spent the rest of the reception dancing, mingling with their guests, and sneaking in as many kisses and touches as they could. By the end of the night, John was pretty tired, but one fact kept him awake. They'd soon be on a plane to Paris, where they'd be spending their honeymoon.
John leaned into the touch, his arms encircling the other boy. "I don't see damages when I look at you. I see a handsome, brilliant, loving, strong, and all around incredible man, who deserves so much more love than he gets. It's my pleasure, my privilege, to love you."
John sighed when Sherlock decidedly wouldn't eat any more. He followed him back to his room and started to change. But when Sherlock was unusually quiet, he stepped over to the other boy and hugged him from behind. "You alright?" he asked, nuzzling his face in Sherlock's back.
Sherlock groaned and started fumbling with John's shirt. He finally got it off and started running his hands along his fiancé's back, pulling him closer to bring their bare chests together.
Sherlock smirked for a second before he straightened his face and got down on his knees in front of John, bowing his head. "Yes master," he said in a low voice.
Sherlock gasped as John straddled him and a shiver ran through his body at the other boy's tone. He smirked up at John and ran his finger lightly down the front of his shirt, "just because I don't have experience, doesn't mean I don't know how to use my looks to my advantage." He bucked his hips up once and pulled John down by the back of his head until there was just a breath between them. "It also doesn't mean that I don't intend on finding out every little detail of how to pleasure you, John," he breathed against his lips, smirk back in place as soon as he was finished talking.
... So tight," he whimpered. Once he was fully seated inside his lover, he leaned forward to give him slow, languid kisses in an attempt to calm them both down. He wanted this to last more than just a few seconds.
!" He cried out in pleasure as Sherlock hit him one last time in his prostate, pushing him over the edge. He came hard, body tensing and nearly convulsing as he spilled out over his and Sherlock's hands.
Sherlock decided then and there that the sound of John screaming his name in pleasure was his favourite sound in the world. He moved his head up and down, swallowing occasionally, trying to evoke more sounds out of his lover.
Sherlock smirked at his reaction and tightened his hold as they sped out of the lot. He'd never ridden on a motorbike before, but it was very exhilarating and the speed coupled with how tightly pressed he was to John caused adrenaline to flood through his system. He leaned forward and rested his chin on John's shoulder, smiling. He was extremely happy and hoped that John was okay with the closeness.
Mycroft nodded firmly and released John's hand. "I want you to know that after tonight, you will no longer have to worry about Irene Adler. She will be out of the way for good." Mycroft smiled and walked away without explaining further.
Sherlock smiled sadly and grabbed a wash rag, soaping it up. He started washing John, rubbing the cloth along his upper back. "I'll be back soon, love. I'm supposed to be able to get the stitches removed in a few days." He leaned in and kissed the side of his fiance's neck, the skin soft and wet.
Sherlock added a second finger and scissored them, stretching open his lover. "I love it when you talk dirty to me... It makes me want you even more," he murmured and added a third finger, pushing them in deeper.
John made his way down Sherlock's body, nipping, sucking, licking, kissing. He wanted to hit every inch of his lover's skin with something. Where his mouth couldn't reach his hands roamed, trailing ghosting touches or pausing in spots to massage the skin.
Sherlock waved until John was out of sight then sighed, shoving his hands into his coat pockets and heading back down the stairs. He got into the car with Mycroft, staring out the window the entire ride home.
I want more..." Sherlock groaned and in a few seconds he was straddling his lover's hips and guiding John's cock to his entrance. He didn't bother with preparing himself and just sat down completely, crying out as he was penetrated.
Sherlock pulled away from his lover's lips after a few moments and turned him over onto his stomach, running his hands over his back and cupping his arse. He laid himself on top of John, rubbing his erection between his arse cheeks as he kissed the back of his neck. He made his way down, kissing each vertebrae as he went.
Sherlock bit his lip and blinked the tears away. "Do you... regret it? Stepping in that day and helping me? I mean..." he sighed and looked away, "If we hadn't met, you would still be at home and your father wouldn't be upset... You would be... happy," his voice tapered off at the end and he shut his eyes tight, trying to stop the tears from falling.
When he was finished, he pulled the other boy on top of him and kissed him lazily. "Mmmm... that was... wow. I can't even..." he murmured and finally gave up on trying to describe it, just leaning forward and locking their lips together again.
John shook his head, hating to think about it. He brought one of his hands up to Sherlock's chest and put it over his beating heart, needing to feel the pumping muscle. "I was so scared..." he said softly. "When they carried you out, I really thought I had lost you. I'm grateful everyday to even hear you breathe."
John was glad not to have to hold back his moans and whimpers as Sherlock drove him wild in a foreign tongue. When he was given the upper hand, he bent down to kiss him on the lips, down his jaw, and his neck, slowly undoing his shirt buttons.
Sherlock nodded, "thank you." He walked swiftly through the flat and into John's room, his heart breaking at the sight of him. He instantly ran over and wrapped his arms around his fiancé, pressing kisses on his head. "Shhh... It's okay love, it'll all be alright."
Sherlock pressed kisses along the side of John's face as he finished. When he was completely spent, he lifted his lover's hand and licked the come off of it, humming in content at the taste.
He pulled his clothes on and followed the other boy out of the bedroom. "Did we have to do this first thing in the morning?" he asked around another yawn. "I was enjoying sleeping with you." He caught up with Sherlock and leaned on him, eyes closed.
He found Sherlock, hooked up much the same as he had been earlier that week. As John had been as well. He brought a chair over and took Sherlock's hand, relishing in the fact that it was warm, full of life. He laced their fingers, his other hand carding through Sherlock's hair. He would wait as long as he needed, he wasn't leaving this spot.
Sherlock smiled at everyone who greeted them, only knowing about half of the people they talked to. He led John over to the table at the head of the dining area and pulled the chair out for him, sitting down after he did. He grabbed John's hand, twining their fingers together and bringing the back of his husband's hand to his lips to kiss it.
Sherlock's eyes widened slightly, he'd thought they'd been one maid short since the shooting and now he knew why. His father must have fired her. Helen turned back to John, "please, continue," she said with her hand stretched out to him.
"Oh, come on... Have a little fun!" The girl tried to grind against him, but Sherlock grabbed her by the hips and pushed her away. "I said...
Sherlock chuckled and kissed his lover's nose, "hence why we're the most attractive couple at school." He grinned and wrapped his arms tightly around John, pulling him into a hug. "I can't believe how lucky I am. You're the most kind, handsome, perfect person I have ever met. Every day I thank whoever's out there watching over us that you were brought to me." He pulled back and cupped his fiance's cheek again, "It blows my mind that someone like you could ever love me as much as I love you."
frighten you." He held his breath in anticipation of John's reaction, he could hear his heart pounding in his ears.
John shook his head again, panicking. "It's fine, I've done this before," he said to Mary voice a higher pitch than a moment before. "Sherlock, wake
After the lawyer had left and Sherlock's father went with her to walk her out, Sherlock wrapped his arms tightly around John. "Are you okay, love?" he murmured softly into his hair.
John's smile faltered a little as he remembered that the private dance was what got them into this in the first place. But the way Sherlock was talking, it seemed like he didn't even remember it, or when they got separated. "I love you, too, Sherlock," he murmured, rubbing his thumb over his fiance's cheek.
John kissed Sherlock's shoulder blade and gently rocked him. "I don't want you to hide that from me. If you have a problem, I'm supposed to make it better." He turned Sherlock around so that he could look into the other boy's eyes. "I know you don't want to talk about the dreams or the memories, but I want to be able to comfort you when they upset you."
John knew there was nothing more that he could do besides what he was doing. He rocked him, kissed him, and whispered sweet words of comfort. But hearing Sherlock cry like that was making him want to cry too, and a few tears escaped his eyes. That sick bastard Sebastian...he would pay for everything he'd done, someday.
Sherlock growled, shifting his hips to try and help hit his lover's prostate. "God, yes... That's it, love, ride me harder...
John bit down on Sherlock's neck out of reflex. He was close too, the sensations all coming together in a whirl of amazing pleasure. He bucked hard against Sherlock, trying to get more friction from his hand and length. "F-fuck...ah...Sh-Sherlock..."
Sherlock closed his eyes at the feeling of John's lips on his neck and he moaned softly. After he had pulled John's clothing off, he began kissing every inch of skin he could. Memorizing every bit of him and noting what spots made his breath hitch and which ones made him moan.
John blushed at Sherlock's admission, wondering what he had in store for him. He looked up at the other boy and smiled. "I love you, too." He kissed the underside of Sherlock's jaw tenderly.
Sherlock laughed, "wouldn't that make for the talk of all of London?" he said playfully and winked at John. He finally relented and ate most of his meal, even stealing a couple of bites of John's dessert when it came. As they finished up, a slower song came on the radio and he smiled, standing and holding out his hand. "May I have this dance?" He grinned down at John, hoping he would accept.
John continued to moan and rock his hips up as Sherlock slowly took him all the way in. He liked the gentleness of tonight, even though he enjoyed being rough as well. But sometimes it was nice to truly show love over lust.
John," Sherlock moaned almost like a mantra and the nails of his free hand dug into the other boy's hip in his attempt to warn him how close he was to climax.
Sherlock smirked, "Oh yeah? Well, in case you haven't noticed, he feels the same about me as I do about him, so just piss off Moran." Sebastian raised an eyebrow, "Oh, I see. We'll just have to do this the hard way then." He grabbed Sherlock's apple off his tray and bit into it violently before turning and walking away.
Sherlock cupped John's cheek and kissed him lovingly on the lips. "We don't have to go to the party if it makes you uncomfortable," he murmured.
"John..." Sherlock said softly, his heart breaking at John's defeated tone of voice. He wanted nothing more than to erase his fears of rejection, knowing how it could feel. He pulled John close to him and hugged him, unable to think of anything else to do. "I don't care," he said firmly and released him, grabbing his face and turning his head to force him to look him in the eyes, "you are the first person to even want to spend time with me. All the others mock and tease me, beat me up and send me to the hospital with several broken bones and a concussion... You were the first to show any kindness towards me and I am grateful for that. How much money you have doesn't matter to me in the least. Please don't worry about that." He spoke softly, but determinedly, trying to convince John that there was nothing that would make him ask him to leave. He'd only known John for a short time, but he already felt such a connection to him that he knew he would always want him in his life, no matter what.
Helen nodded, "then he became angry and pulled the trigger?" Sherlock was biting his lip from his chair, nervous for his fiance as it got back to the part where he got shot. He wished he was there by his side to comfort him this time.
"He... he'll be back soon, he just went to talk to someone," Sherlock stuttered and swallowed. Sebastian grinned, "Oh, you mean Mary? Yeah... They'll probably be a while." Sherlock furrowed his brow, "What do you mean?"
John rubbed a hand over his eyes. "I think I'm alright for now. If I need more sleep, I'll tell you." He grinned up at his boyfriend and pressed his palm to Sherlock's chest. He could feel his heart beating beneath it, and he suddenly realised how much he loved the feeling, that Sherlock's heart beat for him alone, just as his did for Sherlock.
The sounds of John coming apart brought Sherlock to his own release, his hips jerking sporadically through it. After he was finally finished, he released his lover's leg and collapsed on top of him, breathing hard and heart pounding. "Holy shit..." he mumbled into John's neck, still panting.
!" He couldn't even form words anymore as sobs wracked his body. Finally the sound of sirens appeared and the door was broken down as not only paramedics but a team of police stormed in.
Sherlock hummed and slumped his head forward so John could wash his neck too. "I really enjoyed myself last night. I wonder if your father heard us..." he said and smirked.
Sherlock groaned and arched his back into his lover's touches. John could reduce him to a puddle within seconds and he
John pulled Sherlock's trousers down to his knees, and then pulled away to look into his eyes. "I can leave the pants on, if you want," he said, voice husky. He wanted Sherlock to be comfortable and he didn't know how he felt about being completely exposed.
John had expected a little more of a reaction than he had gotten from Sherlock, and he thought maybe he was doing something that he didn't like. Sherlock seemed to have liked this before, but John stopped. Maybe it was hurting him and he didn't realise. Looking up at the other boy, he tilted his head in question. "Did I do something wrong?" he asked, letting himself drop over to the side next to Sherlock.
Sherlock chuckled and put his hands up, backing away. "Alright, alright... Sorry, dear." He smiled and pecked John on the lips.
"I've never brought anyone here before. This is my special thinking spot, I come here when I've had a particularly bad day and need to clear my mind," he murmured, his head on John's shoulder. He kissed him gently on the cheek and tightened his arms around him, "I wanted to share it with you."
"What happened then, John?" Helen asked, her voice low. Sherlock knew this would end up being the most difficult part to remember and he made his breaths slow and deliberate so his fiancé could see the movement as well as tapping his finger lightly on the table in front of him, mimicking his heart beat.

John closed his eyes, leaning as close into Sherlock's embrace as he could. "We drove for a long time...Harry kept swerving and speeding up and I started crying because I was so scared. I wound up crying myself to sleep after a while. I don't know what happened but when I next woke up..." His breath hitched and he took a moment to swallow.
John's heart fluttered as Sherlock pulled him in for a hug, and he couldn't help himself. He put his arms around Sherlock and stayed there, face pressed into his shoulder. Sherlock smelled like clean laundry, a little like cinnamon, and just faintly like cigarettes. Somehow the combination seemed fitting and he relaxed a little because of it. He let Sherlock keep his face locked on him and listened to his deep baritone as he spoke. John's heart filled with warmth at the explanation, and sadness as well. He could see the sincerity in his eyes and he nodded, pulling Sherlock in for another hug. "Thank you..." Looking up at him without breaking away, John spoke with more determination. "I promise, I'll never let anyone come after you again. From now on, I'll protect you, ok?" He hoped that the vow wasn't too forward, but he just felt like it was something he had to do. Something about Sherlock was special and it drew him in.
"Morning," John said, grinning and lifting his head to kiss Sherlock tenderly on the lips. He then went right back to where he was before, working his way to Sherlock's collarbone. "Are we going to Mary's party tonight?" he asked against his lover's skin.
The whole courtroom was silent and many people were looking at John sympathetically. Sherlock was gripping hard on the sides of his chair, trying to keep himself from running to embrace his fiancé. Helen gave him a few moments before speaking again, deciding to help him along. "So, Sherlock was hit instead?"
Sherlock grinned, "yeah? I mean... I know it was fantastic for me, but I've never done anything sexual before," he said and chuckled. He pulled John closer to him and nuzzled into his hair.
Sherlock grinned and turned until he was hovering over his lover, "Yes, I have turned you into quite the little deviant, hmm?" He leaned down and captured John's lips in another kiss, sliding their tongues together nice and slow.
Sherlock walked into the kitchen after John, standing beside him at the sink. He grabbed a dish towel off the counter to dry off the dishes as the other boy cleaned them. "Dinner was very good, Mr. Watson," he said over his shoulder.
Sherlock sighed happily and fell asleep quickly to the sound of his lover's heart beating beneath his ear. He slept soundly that night, without a hint of a nightmare.
Sherlock managed to maneuver them over to the ottoman, still managing to see them both in the mirror. He continued to prepare his lover, adding a second and then a third finger.
Sherlock just laid there panting for a few moments, trying to catch his breath and gather his wits. He pulled John close to him and kissed him, "that... was the single most amazing thing I have ever experienced," he said, grinning like a mad man.
John lifted his face a little, but not all that way. "I don't know. I think a lot of guys are scared of it, gay or straight or whatever. I mean, technically it's not 'natural' and I read more than once that it really hurt and could be dangerous."
John fought with Sherlock's tongue, pushing it back so that he could invade his mouth, even going so far as to nip the end of it. He gasped and squeezed Sherlock as he felt the pressure building around him and in another moment he had reached his climax, thrusting through it until he had fully released. He could hardly breathe with how hard he had come, and it took all of his strength not to collapse completely on top of Sherlock.
Sherlock let the corners of his mouth quirk into a smile briefly before going serious again. He gripped John a little tighter, still staying outside of his trousers. He'd been John's lover for about seven years now and knew every little way to touch him to get him aroused.
Sherlock grinned, "yes, indeed." He took John's arm and walked back towards the dining area. "There you two are!" Sherlock's mother sighed and grabbed her son, dragging him over to a round table set up in front of the crowd of people. The chef brought out the cake, which was a beautiful four tier dark chocolate cake with fresh strawberry and chocolate filling.
"Oh, love..." Sherlock sighed and wrapped his arms around John, running his fingers through the short, blonde hair. "I'm sorry, I should have known better..." he apologised and pressed a kiss to the top of the other boy's head.
"Unngh, oh fuck... C-close, John," Sherlock breathed. He bucked his hips up once and moaned softly. He was so close, just needing that little bit more to push him over.
John stood and took the offered hand. "Sure. Just as long as you mind your hands," he said with a wink.
John squeezed Sherlock's cock as he felt the twitches and used all his power to buck up into his lover. "You have no idea what you do to me, Sherlock. You're so fucking incredible." God, he was so close. But he wanted Sherlock to come first.
John would never have admitted to believing in soulmates before, but there was no question in his mind now. Sherlock was his perfect match, the only person that he could ever be with and be truly happy. He kissed him back passionately, and then kissed the tear from his cheek.
he thought and focused on that voice, pushing the other ones aside. His shaking slowly became less intense as he worked as hard as he could to hone in on John's voice alone. "John..." he murmured softly.
John let out soft cries, clinging to Sherlock as they continued to move. "More, Sherlock...need more..." he begged softly.
There was a knock at the door and Sherlock stayed still. He nudged John in the back. "I think it's your father... If I'm right, you should be the one to respond," he whispered.
"Sebastian Moran! Stop that right this instant!" Sebastian stopped and looked back at the commanding voice. It was one of the professors, Mr. Lestrade. He panicked and got up, running away with the other players not far behind.
John smirked. He could have fun with this. "Imagine me touching you, everywhere. Every spot that makes you go crazy," he said, voice low. "Go faster. Squeeze just a little tighter."
John returned the kiss firmly. He never thought that someone's words alone could bring him to tears but Sherlock had just done so. He pulled back after a moment and caught his gaze again. "Sherlock...I never thought that anyone I'd ever meet could mean so much to me, or would care about me in return the same." He sniffled and let out a soft chuckle. "And I'm so lucky that you were there to be saved. If we had never met...I know I could never have been as happy with anyone else." He tightened his arms around Sherlock, tucking his face into the crook of his long neck.
The weekend went by faster than either boy wanted it to and on Sunday evening Sherlock was in a chair in the sitting room, burying his face in his hands as his mother pulled out old photo albums and showed John pictures of Sherlock and Mycroft growing up.
John licked his lips a bit nervously. "Well, I never said that I only like boys. I still see appeal in girls," he admitted, hoping Sherlock wouldn't take it the wrong way. Then he added with more confidence, "Sherlock is very special, though. It wouldn't matter if he were a girl or a boy, I would still love him the same."
John made a sound between a whimper and a moan when Sherlock started to move. "Sherlock...oh, God..." He nipped at a pale patch of unmarked skin, which was hard to find since he had been very busy marking Sherlock up lately. Already he was getting close, the swell of emotion combined with the incredible sensations of their love-making bringing him to the edge.
Sherlock let out a low moan and opened his eyes to look down at his lover. "Shit..." he breathed, absolutely loving the view he had. It was funny, in a way, that even though John was down on his knees with Sherlock's cock in his mouth, he had the most control right now.
He hummed in content, inhaling deeply. Sherlock just loved the way that John tasted and the way he responded when he kissed a particularly sensitive spot.
Sherlock continued to kiss John as the song played, softly stroking his skin and keeping his movements slow.
Lunch went by without further incident, but Sherlock could feel the glare coming from Sebastian a few tables over and he watched as he whispered something into the cheer captain Mary Morstan's ear. She nodded and looked over at them briefly before walking back to her own table.
The two boys stood by the exit door and said their goodbyes and thank you's to everyone as they left and his mother came over to give them one last hug and kiss before sending them off to go back to the house. Sherlock led John towards the limo, arm in arm, just as they had arrived.
John fell asleep fast, smiling even as he was swept into his dreams. But things didn't stay peaceful and soon what was a happy dream of he and Sherlock turned into a nightmare.
"Mmm... So are you," Sherlock replied and leaned down to kiss John on the temple. "Somehow we're going to have to clean this up," he murmured, looking down at the water.
"You're so sexy," Sherlock murmured and let his thumb slide over the other man's slit. He wished very badly that he could get away with ducking under the blanket and sucking his husband off, but he knew John
John looked at Sherlock, eyes shining with tears still trapped in them. When Mr. Rodin was sitting down and the defence lawyer was standing, he took the opportunity to mouth 'I love you' to his fiance. He was a bit calmer now that the hardest part was over, and he reminded himself that he needed to be even stronger now that he was on the defence. He swallowed thickly and wiped his eyes, steeling himself for what was to come.
John paled at the sight of the gun, but he didn't back down. Moran wouldn't really...would he? "I didn't ruin anything. You ruined it for yourself. You didn't have to beat on me or Sherlock, but you did. And just because you can't deal with the consequences doesn't mean that you have to take it out on us."
There was a pause and then, "Maybe. I'll check." His father's footsteps moved away, but then turned back. "Did Sherlock go to school already?"
Sherlock smiled and shook Mr. Watson's hand in return, "you are quite welcome." He wrapped his arms around John when he turned to him and rested his cheek on the top of his head. "No one's going to tear us apart, yeah? I love you, John and I'm here to take care of you, no matter what it takes." He pulled back and cupped his fiance's cheek, looking into his eyes and smiling, "I told you I keep my promises."
"I love you, too John." Sherlock helped the other boy finish washing and once they were both clean, he stepped out of the shower and grabbed them some towels. As they were getting dressed, he turned to John and hugged him tightly. "Thank you..." he whispered and kept his hold on the other boy.
John felt his heart breaking at Sherlock's tone. He must have been bullied by more than just the rugby players,yet John just couldn't understand why. Sherlock seemed harmless and pretty normal to him. "Is that what they call you?" he asked gently. He rolled onto his side, reaching a hand out to rest on Sherlock's upper arm. "I heard Moran saying it before. He's talked about you, now that I think about it. Never referred to you by name, only as...well, that." John could tell that the word really bothered Sherlock, so he avoided saying it. "But I don't get it. Why?"
"Mmm... I just my have to take you up on that," Sherlock said and smiled. He ran his fingers softly over John's lower back and pulled him a little closer. "Do you need any of your pain medication? I can get some for you..." he said and kissed his boyfriend's forehead.
John rubbed very slowly up and down, biting on Sherlock's pulse as he did so. "Enjoying yourself?" he murmured softly. "I'll bet you like the danger factor here. Any second, one wrong move, and someone could realise what we're doing. Does that make you more excited?"
"So.. the trick is to keep rotating it, that way you heat up the entire surface." Sherlock guided John's hand in circles over the flame. "See?" he said softly next to his fiance's ear, eyes fixed on the beaker.
John tangled his fingers in Sherlock's hair, pushing him lower, getting him closer. There was always too much space between them.
John turned around to see his father and Ms. Rodin and smiled softly. "That's the first time he's ever purposely talked to a woman like that since Mum," he said. "It'd be really nice if that worked out." He leaned his head against Sherlock's chest, ear over his heartbeat, his favourite sound.
Sherlock's breath hitched at his fiance's words. He moaned as he started to stroke himself harder. "
John stayed snuggled into Sherlock's side as they rode home. He hugged him back, cheek nestled on Sherlock's shoulder. "I know, love. I wish I could too." Especially after the night before, he didn't want to leave Sherlock alone overnight to have another nightmare. John pulled back after a moment, taking Sherlock's face in both hands. "I want you to call me, alright? If you have a nightmare or even if you just can't sleep, I want you to call me."
Sherlock broke into a grin and leaned down to whisper in John's ear. "I will try to keep my hands off you... But you have no idea how irresistible your body is. If we can't control ourselves however... Well... I think we can be quiet." He pulled away and winked again, squeezing the other boy's hand.
"Heard you won the trial, that's so great! I... Oi! What'd I tell you about dancing on the tables, Kev? Gianna, I told you, you're already cut off, ya caner! Sorry... I have to go take care of this, make yourselves at home!" Mary ran off in the direction of a dark skinned girl, sneaking a bottle of vodka from the bar.
John felt a bit better when he caught Sherlock's gaze. He was past the tough part now. "He dropped the gun and ran. That was the last I saw of him."
John turned out towards the bathroom, pushing Sherlock behind him. Dear God, they just couldn't escape without someone breaking in and trying to kill them. He waited, seeing if the person would be able to get in the door. He had locked it...
As soon as he felt his lover was stretched enough, Sherlock removed his fingers and spit into his hand. He reached down and coated his erection in it and then grabbed onto John's hips. Lifting him up, he angled his own hips until the tip of his cock pressed against his lover's entrance and guided him down onto it.
"John?" Footsteps came towards them and his father emerged from the hallway. "John, dear God. Do you know what you put me through yesterday?" He hugged his son and John let go of Sherlock's hand to hug him back.
"Well... That was... unexpected," Sherlock said once she was gone. He wasn't used to being invited to things, especially by the popular kids.
John moved from Sherlock's chest to his stomach, down to his hips. But he passed over Sherlock's crotch and went to his legs, teasing them open. He placed soft kisses to the inside of one of Sherlock's thighs, hand smoothing over the skin of the other.
John leaned back into Sherlock as much as he safely could, glad for the comfort. They finally made it to the flat and John parked the bike outside and climbed off. He helped Sherlock off and kept hold of his hand as they walked up the steps to the door. His father should be home today, his one day off. John unlocked the door and walked in. "Da?"
John looked up at Sherlock and swallowed, shivering in anticipation. He kissed him back, arms firmly holding him in place as he slowly had his senses taken by his lover. When Sherlock pulled away and spoke, all he could do was whimper and nod weakly. Sherlock was far too good at making him melt.
Sherlock reached down and undid his own trousers and pants as he worked, managing to kick them off and he released his fiancé's cock, kissing his way back up his torso until he planted one final kiss on his mouth, instantly delving his tongue inside.
look like a demented sea urchin, fuck you very much, Sherlock. The technical presentations were over his head, so he watched the crowd dynamics to amuse himself.
"It's not a night for sleeping. Too much—" he ruffled his hands through his hair sharply. "I can't settle tonight. My mind is whirling and there's nothing to do all damned day when all the criminals appear to be icebound."
Gleefully, he snatched up his violin and skirled ecstatically until Mrs Hudson came up with tea and sandwiches (“Just this once, dear, as you've not had time to go to the shops.”) and asked if he knew any Glenn Miller.
Sherlock actually looked up from his newspaper and beamed at her. “Quite right, Mrs Hudson. You see, John? We should talk.”
Once he saw the evidence, Sherlock would know who in Mycroft's household could be trusted to detain Fitzhugh, and Mycroft's phone would give him clearance to place the orders to do so.
The man turned from hanging up his suit jacket and came to the bedside, where Greg had been invited to sit but was standing instead. “There are condoms and lubricant in the nightstand,” he said, not touching yet. “I must insist—”
He knew what his younger self would have made of a man like him: middle-aged, wedding ring recently removed, too carefully shaven, clothes too carefully chosen, too nervous. He'd never gone home with that sort of man, never wanted to be somebody's bit on the side. He'd had the luxury of choice, back then.
In the car, he switched on his mobile and ignored the 113 text messages from Sherlock. They would all come down to "Get your arse home and entertain me" and "We're out of milk" and were pointless since he was on his way home without any sodding milk.

“John,” he said on hitched breath. His hands were splayed against the wall, and he pressed into them to hold himself up as he bent his knees and slid down a few inches to give John better access. John's thighs burned sympathetically but he was not stopping. Not now.
"Oh, God, I want a hot shower. I want, wanna put my feet right into the fire. That would feel so good. And dry. I remember dry. Dry was nice."
"We shouldn't have this conversation right now because Mrs Hudson is going to interrupt us, but we shall have it, John," he said reprovingly. "You haven't been honest with me."
“Robert MacIntyre,” she says, “do you mean to tell me you've left your poor dog cooped up for the last two and a half hours whilst we were sat around in a bloody pub?”
John stood rigidly as the lab door slammed shut, the words “Oh, and the impotence is just a post-traumatic symptom, like the limp. Nothing to be concerned about. I imagine you'll begin having spontaneous nocturnal emissions a few weeks before achieving voluntary erections, so watch for that, if it's of any importance to you” hanging in the air.
Sherlock ran possible scenarios in his mind's eye. "It accounts neatly for everything..." It also provided the perfect social barrier to oblivious idiots who would otherwise make entirely inappropriate advances towards his John.
When he gets home that evening to start his leave, he finds that Casey has quietly and—he knows this is the truth—
"Anthea will ring you with the address. Is an appointment this morning acceptable? Very good. In return, I wonder if you would be inclined to do a small favour for me? There's an event tomorrow evening, a gathering of new-media users like yourself, John. I understand your blog has a small but devoted following. I would be interested in knowing what you think of the presenters. Your new suit would be acceptable attire."
“I know,” Sherlock said. “I know. I just....” He slid his gaze from over John's shoulder to his face, and there was something in his expression that John wished he could place because it was important, he knew it was important but he couldn't pin it down. “Mycroft never got to you.” His mouth twisted into a hideous parody of a smile. “I managed this all on my own.” He stood. “I just wanted.... Goodnight, John.”
Sherlock's expression was half pity, half disbelief. "You actually think that's true. What must that be like, to persist in a delusion in the face of all evidence to the contrary?"
to walk you through that deduction?” He huffed. “Most people checking for concussion just ask who the prime minister is, but I suppose in your family that's never mattered much.”
Sherlock, of course I'd try. I just...I don't think I could be convincing and we really need to carry this off."
Several minutes later, his heart at last slowed to a mere gallop and he regained sensation in his extremities. His sense of hearing appeared to be returning as well, because he could finally make out Sherlock bitching at him.
He rubbed his sore face again and once more wished for dry pants. "Okay. Can I borrow your phone? My, uh, my flatmate'll be wondering where I am."
After a few moments of silence, the bastard mused absently, “Your new Chief Superintendent is known for such...rigid habits of mind. Little tolerance for unconventionality, particularly for...proclivities that could be said to be the cause of marital dissolution. So difficult to prove discrimination when one's superiors simply argue that one's current rank is the one beyond which one has not the talent to advance. However should such a thing be refuted?”

The man was vaguely familiar, but John couldn't quite—“Stamford, Mike Stamford,” he said, offering his hand, and now John could place him. “Heard you were abroad somewhere dry and sunny. Why on earth did you come back? Come on, come on, get out of the rain. I'll buy you lunch and we can catch up, if you've nothing on.”
, I will leave and not come back. I swear it. I won't be, be trapped like that. It will be all over. Do you hear me? I will
“I swear to God I wouldn't have hurt him,” Harris said. “Watson, I swear I wouldn't have hurt him. I just wanted to be the one to bring him in, okay?”
“A medical air-evacuation for two was ordered at Mycroft's.” To Tobin, in the driver's seat, he said, “Hoxton. Gopsall Street. Come on!” John's shoulders smacked the backrest as the car leapt forward. “John, phone Bill Murray and ask what's happened to Mycroft.”
Bracing his hands against the wall of the shower, he let the water run over his head until his breathing slowed. It was possible he was...overreacting a bit, because after all, this was good news on the whole. Sherlock might be an absolute cowardly knob-end, but now John knew his interest was returned. And he reminded himself he always did get irritable when his blood sugar was low, so probably he shouldn't make any important decisions before he'd had breakfast.
it. He was standing in his own bloody kitchen in his pants and undershirt with a rotting hangover while the same flatmate who'd given him the best blowjob
As usual, Sherlock was sprawled over the entire sofa in his I Am Thinking Important Thoughts pose, which both blocked the best view of the telly and cunningly made him the focal point of attention in the room. John had long since developed his own way of dealing with this, which was to lift Sherlock's legs by whatever fabric they were encased in, sit, and redeposit the limbs across his lap without comment. He rested his plate across Sherlock's shins and settled in for the evening.
The ice had melted, John's knee was supporting his weight, his concussion-induced headache had gone, and Sherlock had scouted out a suitable location days ago. Yes, it was time.
Monitors shrieked, the door flew open, dark shapes piled into the room, Sherlock shouted—John ignored all of it and concentrated on breaking every fucking bone in Banks' right arm.
It was highly unlikely John could achieve orgasm or even full erection again tonight, given the refractory period required by his age and intensity of recent climax, and manual stimulation would probably be uncomfortable. Sherlock was careful to keep this in mind as his hands nudged a thigh up to give him better access. John's breath stuttered as a slick forefinger circled him delicately.
In the morning, before he left, he hobbled stiffly to the lamp to which Sherlock's gaze had strayed when Mycroft's need to use the lavatory during the seventh hour had become too great to ignore. There was a small glass vial within the pipe, snugged tight against the cord.
Shit.  Decision time. Continue to follow the mad genius with a tendency to risk his life to prove his cleverness who was currently headed into enemy territory with no other backup, or follow said genius's urgent instructions (no punctuation or capitalisation—therefore very bloody urgent) and turn back to protect a high-ranking member of the shadow government who was, incidentally, his brother?
John, who whilst still an idiot on distressingly numerous occasions could occasionally rise above the ocean of stupidity encompassing the part of the human race not named Holmes to something approaching competence, had said, "Surrender."
, his mind chanted as he scrubbed and gowned, and then he had to put it all aside and concentrate on the damaged body in front of him. He was very good at that.
She tells him to ask again next year, and three weeks later she takes him to meet her parents. He's not sure, but he thinks this is a good development taken as a whole, and he’s happy.
She starts at the site of the blood-scent, smart girl that she is, but casts and casts and casts without responding. Jason makes a rookie mistake and starts getting stressed; she picks up on his tension and starts getting anxious herself, starts trying to please her handler instead of trying to find the scent. She assumes
He'd learned the most interesting things. His John, his warm, bright, good John, was also a creature of intriguing shadows and glinting hard edges, camouflaged with moral codes and strict rules. This was not a surprise. John had courted him by killing a man for him, after all, although he hadn't realised it then.
She let him out in front of his building. There was absolutely no reason for him to feel so flat when he got off the lift and unlocked his own door, when he walked into his perfectly nice living room with much better furniture than he'd lost in the fire.
dropped him dead. And whilst Harris could imagine being pissed off enough to kill somebody you knew, there was something more than a little scary about watching a bloke do it so calmly. He tried to imagine doing that to his girlfriend's brother and thought he couldn't, not without being really drunk and really angry. Couldn't do it in cold blood.
When he noticed Sherlock had taken his phone in exchange, he shook his head and grinned to himself in a way that made Adrian Jameswood blink, give him a second look, then rejoin their conversation with considerably more interest.
Even though it's dark and there’s no body to find this time, out of habit he takes Ava to the most deserted spot in the area for reward-play, finds a stretch of grass for her to run on. He tosses her ball and she bounds after it joyfully.
"Hey," Sherlock said softly and tilted John's head up, "no one is ever going to take you away from me, okay? I won't let it happen. I told you I promised to be here for you and I intend to keep that promise. I will fight for you, no matter who tries to tear us apart." He smiled lovingly at his boyfriend and kissed him on the forehead.
John followed behind Sherlock, wondering all the while where they might be going. He kept a tight hold of Sherlock's hand, and he thought he could see something in the distance, but then Sherlock stopped and turned to him. John looked up into his eyes and without hesitation he said, "I do." In fact, he might just trust Sherlock with his life.
"God, you're so sexy," Sherlock breathed and pulled off John's jumper, swiftly undoing the buttons on his shirt and pushing it aside, not even bothering to take it completely off before he attacked his torso with his mouth.
John bit his earlobe and then went back to speaking. "I want to have you everywhere. I want to pin you against the wall, I want to find a secluded corner of the school. Anywhere we are, I would throw you down and fuck you so hard."
he thought, intrigued by John. He found himself analyzing him without thought, taking in his full appearance, but looking away after his thoughts took a more personal turn. He had always known he preferred males over females, although he had never been involved with either romantically, but this was not the time to let his look linger too long. He still wasn't sure how John would react to that sort of attention.
Mycroft sighed dramatically, "I suppose," he grabbed his keys and headed out the door, "come on, then." Sherlock followed him out to the car and shoved the envelope in his inner jacket pocket before buckling up.
"Never...Though we probably won't be able to go three times in so short a span when we get older," John said with a breathy chuckle. He choked out another groan, already feeling close. It wasn't too hard to finish this time, since it hadn't been that long since they had done it in the hot tub. He rubbed his thumb over their slits, gasping at the feeling.
"Oh, it's a bit much, especially when it comes to the upkeep, but we manage." Mrs. Holmes said and laughed softly. "Sherlock, how come you've never mentioned your friend here before? I was beginning to think you didn't have any!" Sherlock felt a lump form in his throat, his parents were blissfully unaware of his struggles to find friends, never having time to actually talk to him. "Well, we actually just met... John was walking down the hall when..." he paused and looked over at John, "when we got off school and we started talking, so I invited him home with me." Sherlock's mother smiled, "Well, it's lovely to have you, John. You're welcome to stay over any time you want. Consider this your second home!" Just then the butler and cook came in with a cart filled with food. The butler passed out bowls of soup while the cook began to carve a large turkey.
John smiled up at him, so happy that he didn't have to leave Sherlock. He leaned into his touch, heart soaring. Not only had Sherlock saved him but he made things better. "You are amazing. Absolutely amazing."
John squirmed a little, Sherlock's kisses tickling. "Hey, cut it out!" He pushed Sherlock's head from his stomach and sat up. "You make it like I'm a dog or a baby or something," he grumbled, ignoring his stomach making another unattractive noise.
Sherlock groaned and pulled on John's hips, bending him over. He proceeded to slick his fingers with his saliva and stuck one of them inside of the other boy's entrance. "You're so fucking sexy," he growled, leaning forward to kiss his lover's lower back.
Sherlock sighed happily and leaned into John's touch, "I'm fine now... Thanks to my wonderful fiancé." He smiled down at the other boy and leaned down to kiss him again.
Helen finished taking notes and closed the notebook, "I think that should be enough for today. I'll be back tomorrow afternoon to run through questions the other lawyer might ask you." She stood and gathered her things together before holding her hand out towards the boys, "I look forward to helping you put this monster behind bars," she said and gave a sad smile.
John slowly moved downward, taking in more and more until he was halfway. Part of him was chuckling on the inside. He'd always been the one getting, not giving. It was so different, and yet now he found he could give to Sherlock exactly what he'd want done to him.
John's heart just broke at the sight and sound of Sherlock. He was like a frightened child the way he was curled up and begging for John to stay. "Sherlock..." He leaned forward and kissed him slowly, cupping his face in both hands. When he pulled away, it was just far enough to look into his eyes again. "Relax. I'm not going anywhere, ok? I'm right here." He attempted a smile and smoothed his thumbs over Sherlock's cheekbones. "I'm the one who should be sorry. I said something to make you this upset, didn't I?" He kept a hold of Sherlock's face and kissed his forehead, then the tip of his nose, then moved to his lips where he gave him a few slow, tender kisses to try to convince him that he was most certainly not leaving.
As soon as they were finished dressing, Sherlock took John's hand and led him outside and down to the pool area. It was a closed in pool with glass walls and a glass roof, the hot tub sitting off to the side and a sauna further back. They had a diving board and a slide, as well as a shed with pool toys and floats in it. Sherlock laid his towel on one of the chairs and went to the steps to start getting in.
John was glad that Sherlock would be staying close to him because the moment he stepped out of the limo he was in awe. They were at a castle, a real castle! He shouldn't have been that surprised really considering that Sherlock's house was already like a castle on the inside. But not on the outside, not like this.
Sherlock led John down the hallway and into his bedroom which was at the end of the hall. He had insisted on it being decorated in black and royal blue, his two favourite colours. There was a desk at the far end of the room with papers scattered on it and a full chemistry set next to it on a table. His bed was king sized and had black Egyptian cotton sheets and a plush velvet quilt in royal blue. He took off his coat and tossed it on the back of the chair, toeing off his shoes and looking back at John with a smile. "Make yourself at home." His smile faded quickly when he saw how nervous and unsure John seemed to be. "Hey... what's wrong?" he asked, his brow furrowed in confusion. He walked over to John and grabbed his shoulders, leaning down to try and make eye contact with him.
When the final bell rang, they walked into the hall together, but they were stopped by Mary before they went outside. "John, can I speak to you for a moment? Alone?" she said sweetly and glanced over at Sherlock.
Sherlock gasped in pain, but stayed focused on John's face. "I promised to protect you," he whispered, "I love you more than anything, John Watson." He felt his eyelids getting heavy and felt light headed. He was struggling now to stay awake until the ambulance arrived.
John kissed Sherlock back, pouring his love for Sherlock into it. He wrapped his arms around the other boy's neck. No, his fiance's neck. That sounded so nice. He pulled away, and gave Sherlock a few quick, soft kisses before opening his eyes and smiling at him. "Now I just need to get you a ring."
"That next Monday, we went to school together and we didn't hide the fact that we were in a relationship. But Sebastian didn't like that," he said, face going serious again. "After school, Sherlock and I were walking out of the building, and a girl- Mary- came up to me and asked to speak with me alone. I didn't realise it but she was trying to lure me away so Sherlock would be more vulnerable."
John groaned into the kiss, nibbling at his lower lip and sucking on Sherlock's tongue as it invaded his mouth. He pulled Sherlock's hand off of his cock and let go of his lover's so that they could grind together. This left both his hands free to reach behind Sherlock and peel his cheeks apart, teasing at his entrance with a few fingers.
Sherlock groaned and wrapped his arms around his lover's neck, "How would you like to tie me up? I have some scarves in my closet... Or I could look around for some rope..." He ground his hips down into John's and moaned softly.
John stayed completely still as Sherlock moved forward, only closing his eyes as their lips touched. He could hardly believe this. He met this boy only hours ago, and now they had kissed. John felt his entire body light up at the connection, and he just
John stroked Sherlock through, making sure that he was completely empty before slipping under the blanket and licking Sherlock's release off of his hand. He popped back up, resting his cheek on his husband's shoulder and snuggled close. "How was that?"
John hummed softly, holding onto Sherlock as the other boy kissed his neck. He let his eyes flutter shut, just listening to that beautiful deep voice. "I don't know. We can do anything really. Just as long as I'm with you." He rested his cheek in Sherlock's hair, loving how soft and silky his curls were.
John shook his head a little. "Fine have it your wa-eep!" He jumped and squeaked as Sherlock pinched his nipple, hand coming up to swat Sherlock away afterwards. "So that's how it's going to be?" he said with a smirk, and reached across to get both of Sherlock's at once.
Sherlock didn't react to the kiss, just kept staring off. His expression was blank and he didn't move, didn't speak or make a sound. "John? Should we... call an ambulance or something?" Mary asked, her voice getting more concerned by the second.
Mycroft stood in the doorway, observing the whole scene for a few moments before he entered the room and sat down next to John. "He loves you, you know. He may not have admitted it yet because he feels like it's too soon and he's used to holding everything in, but he does."
Sherlock searched John's face and thought long and hard before he spoke. "You've been playing sports all your life, so you're very athletic. You're a very caring person, which means that you probably want to go into some field where you're helping people. Most likely a doctor, based on your advanced skills of taking care of injuries..." he paused, unsure if he should continue, but decided to give him everything, after all he asked for it. "You're also unsure of your feelings towards me, you think you may be attracted to me, but you're not sure. You're not gay, you have never had feelings for another boy before so... it frightens you.
Another minute brought in John's father. He ran forward and hugged John. "This has been happening too much," he said, kissing him on the forehead. He turned to Mr. and Mrs. Holmes. "How's Sherlock?"
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's legs, pressing his cheek against Sherlock's hip. "Well, he only made things worse for himself. As for you, my dear..." He got up and kissed Sherlock softly on the lips. "I only wish we could have met sooner." He smiled softly at his fiance. "I should probably get dressed now. Don't want to be late for school," John finished with a sigh.
Sherlock couldn't hold on any longer and bucked his hips up again as he came all over his husband's hand. He whimpered softly and when he was finally finished, he slumped back into the chair, breathing hard.
John swirled his tongue over the aroused flesh, leaving a gentle nip at the end. Then he moved to the other one, doing the same. He knew Sherlock must be dying to touch him, and he wanted to be touched as well. But he also liked being in control, because Sherlock squirming underneath him was extremely sexy.
Sherlock instantly wrapped his arms around the other boy and tangled their legs together loosely. He ran his fingers through John's hair and pulled him in for a slow kiss, keeping it soft and loving. "I love you," he whispered and let his eyes take in every detail of his lover's face from this close up.
Sherlock chuckled, "I suppose that was a logical assumption, given the situation." He smiled and kissed John on the lips again, "now let's see... The first day we met... Well, I also thought you were really handsome, brave and very kind. I also thought about how great you would look without a shirt on." He grinned down at the other boy, "and I was
John groaned just from the way Sherlock was looking at him, and he pulled out his fingers. He reached for the lube again, slicking his cock, moving to position himself. He pushed in and groaned again, bending to kiss him hungrily.
John kissed him back, making a soft sound. He leaned up so that he could press in further to the kiss, and as they pulled away, his eyes were sparkling. "You're very welcome, love," he said, wiping his tears away.
John kissed him back gently and then settled his face back in Sherlock's hair. "Sorry, but you're a lovely pillow. I'm going to sleep now."
John nodded, leaning down to peck Sherlock on the forehead. "Don't worry. I won't let him keep me." He followed Mycroft out of the room.
It wasn't long before John's father was calling to them saying that dinner was ready. John heard it first and drowsily nudged Sherlock. "Sher...'sdinner time." He honestly was pretty content right here, but he was a little hungry too.
The dining area was elegant, with many round tables surrounding a large dance floor. John paled a little. He'd forgotten that there would probably be dancing. He didn't know the first thing about dancing.
John flushed a little, realising he'd overdone it. "Sorry, love. You just had me worried for a while." He let his own hand approach Sherlock's, gently lacing their fingers as he stepped closer.
Sherlock held on as long as he could but was soon coming hard and fast across John's hand. He cried out his lover's name as he rode through the pleasure.
Sherlock inhaled sharply as John's finger penetrated him and he groaned again, overwhelmed with all the sensations. As he went deeper, he felt him brush against his prostate and arched his back off the bed in pleasure. "Shit! Oh
John squirmed and moaned, still half-asleep. He didn't know if this was a dream or real so he just kept his eyes closed and didn't try to fully wake up. Sherlock's mouth was warm and talented, and he tilted his head over, trying to give him more skin. He really hoped it wasn't a dream. He wanted the mark that would inevitably be left by the attention to the spot. As Sherlock started kissing his face, John's eyes fluttered open at last and he smiled up at Sherlock.
Sherlock moaned and wrapped one hand around the back of John's neck, pulling him closer and pressing their torsos together. His other hand migrated to his lover's hip and he held on tight. "Hang on for me, love," he whispered, continuing to thrust and bring himself closer.
"It's good to have you, son. I don't think you've been here on good terms yet, so welcome." Mr. Watson smiled and served the three of them before sitting down and starting to eat. "So, you just went back to school for the first time yesterday, right Sherlock? How was that?"
When they got to the hospital, the nurse took Sherlock away for them to run a few tests before they got him settled in a room. Sherlock's parents were out of the country for a long weekend, so Mycroft was going to be there at the hospital as soon as he could. John was led back to Sherlock's room a couple hours later, where he was sleeping. The doctor had given him a sedative after all the shock his brain had gone through.
"I'll dance for you in private this time," Sherlock said and smiled seductively at his fiancé. He started rolling his hips again, standing just a couple feet from the chair that John was sitting in.
Sherlock swallowed when he realised he'd said the wrong thing again. He cursed himself silently and focused on eating as much as he could stomach before excusing himself to the restroom. When he got there, he closed the door and leaned up against it, sighing heavily.
Sherlock moaned softly and continued to kiss John, caressing the other boy's tongue with his own. He pulled away to place kisses to the bruises on his face and neck, then placed one on his nose. "I love you," he whispered and closed his eyes, resting their foreheads together.
Sherlock bucked his hips up into the touch and he let loose a loud, throaty moan. His fists were clenched in the bed sheets, "God...
John obliged, grinding harder into Sherlock with a groan. "Fuck...Oh, Sherlock..." he choked out. "I want to...I want to make love to you," he said softly.
Mycroft drove as fast as he could to the hospital and pulled the car in front of the door to the A & E. He got out and opened the door for John so he could carry Sherlock inside. "Take him in, I'm going to park the car and I'll be there to fill out the papers," he said sternly to John and got back in the car.
"Mycroft eventually found out and threatened to tell mum and dad if I didn't cease at once. I got mad, bought the strongest stuff that my dealer had and..." he paused, looking away and shuddering. "Myc found me a few hours later, lying on the floor of my bedroom, passed out in my own vomit." Sherlock sighed as tears began rolling down his face, "I haven't used since," he murmured, unable to look John in the eyes as he finished. He didn't want to see the disgust that was surely written all over his face.
Helen nodded, "right, okay... The trial is this Friday, as you know. So... let's go through the rest of it, shall we?" She started pacing again, "now, let's talk about the morning that Sebastian broke into Sherlock's house. He came in, holding a gun at you both, correct?"
Sherlock kissed his husband back, pulling him back in for another kiss once they parted. "Mmm... I really can't wait to get you to the hotel," he murmured against John's lips.
Sherlock looked up at John with tears in his eyes, "do you have any idea what I would go through if anything bad were to happen to you? If you were killed? It would destroy me..." he whispered. "I can't lose you, John, and I can't live without you. Ever."
Sherlock nodded, "okay... I'll come with you," he said softly and hugged John to him before letting him go and walking back towards the table.
John let his head fall back, a low moan escaping him. "Yes, I do...I love it..." He whined a little at Sherlock's instructions, wanting to go harder, but he listened, stroking from base to tip and keeping a steady pace.
Mr. Tabling pursed his lips, "but you sat with him at lunch, you even agreed to come hang out with him one day after school. We have several witnesses that can attest to that." He nodded over to the rugby players sitting among the other people watching the trial.
Sherlock shook his head, "wow... I wouldn't want to be in her shoes right now." He turned to John and smiled, "come on, then... let's go dance!"
John was just elated. There was no other way to describe the feeling of pure happiness that filled him to see the little gold band on his finger. He admired it with Sherlock, smile never leaving his face. "I don't know," he said. "I wonder how our parents will react."
"Nothing. Well, nothing much; it's annoyingly heat-resistant. I've only been able to melt the pull on the zip so far, although I have hopes for the explosive antimony if it's concentrated on—"
John didn't see how it happened, but by the time they arrived at Moorgate there were six heavy black cars surrounding their own battered one, and he was politely but insistently edged out of his lane and onto the side of a road that was utterly deserted. Tobin made two more calls and exchanged three more passcodes before he holstered his gun and told John to unlock the doors.
“It gave you some slight measure of protection. Mycroft can't do anything to you that he can't do to me. Of course, you've seen what he can do to me.”
A haughty sniff, and his brother turned away to leave. He stopped with his hand on the doorknob. Examining the brass minutely, he said, "He doesn't...like suits. He likes jumpers."
Sherlock had known how John felt about him. Had probably—no, make that definitely (because this was Sherlock, after all)—known long before John had admitted it to himself. And he'd done nothing.
And Mycroft was not thinking—he was not—about Montague Street, nor about how Sherlock had never once apologised for making his brother find him like that, nor about the years Mycroft had been coming home to an empty house and a cold bed because he could not run the world and protect his brother and still have anything left for himself. He was not. He was not thinking about any of that when he stopped at the kerb beside the car, plucked the vial from his pocket, dropped it on the pavement, and held Sherlock's eyes as he brought his heel down on it with a good deal more force than he'd intended.
That was it. John couldn't stop himself anymore. He stood again, tears streaming down his face. "You son of a bitch! You sick,
Sherlock grabbed John by the wrist and pulled him off the dance floor and out the door. He speed walked to the driveway, demanded the keys from the driver and instructed him to leave for a few minutes. His hands were shaking, so it took a little while to get the door unlocked, but once he did he jumped inside and pulled John in with him by the lapels of his jacket.
"Amazing," Sherlock murmured and turned to kiss John on the forehead. "I love you, darling... Have a good rest, we'll be in Paris soon." He relaxed in the chair and rested his head on top of his husband's, falling asleep within minutes.
The judge nodded and looked at the papers in front of him for a moment before looking up at Ms. Rodin. "Is the prosecution ready to present their case?" Helen stood and smoothed out her skirt, "we are, your honour. I call the first witness, John Watson to the stand."
John grinned, following Sherlock to the room and not expecting at all what he saw. There were arcade games all along the wall, the billiards table, a ping pong table, and even a big television with game consoles hooked up and a cabinet filled with games. "Sherlock...This is awesome! Why haven't you taken me in here before?" He went straight over to one of the arcade games, an older one that was one of his favourites when he was younger. "Wanna play me? Bet I can kick your scrawny little arse."
Mr. Holmes nodded in agreement, "you won't have to worry about him anymore. I just spoke with the lead detective on Sherlock's case and they have Sebastian in custody. He'll be tried as an adult for attempted murder." He placed his hand on John's shoulder, "we called your father, he should be on his way now."
John still hadn't opened his eyes, afraid that if he did a vision of his dying fiance would be lying in front of him, blood pooled, eyes dim. He finally did open them when Ms. Rodin asked her next question, and he nodded silently. He looked at Sherlock and watched the rise and fall of his shoulders, the way his eyes moved.
John let out another cry which morphed into a moan and he started pumping his hand faster on himself. "Th-Then I'm very lucky that I found you...
Mycroft nodded once and stood. He patted John on the shoulder, "you'll be good for him. I'll be watching you both, make sure you take good care of my brother," he said firmly and smiled a little before walking out of the room.
"Really?" Sherlock said and yawned, pulling John close once he was in bed with him. "When did you last carry me?" he asked and rested his head on his fiance's shoulder.
"John, although we've never talked before and we haven't really met, I have observed your interactions with my brother. I feel it's safe to say that you care about him enough that you would not intentionally leave him to get hurt. Now, stop blaming yourself, it's not doing any good. Do what you can to stop that bleeding from his head. In case you haven't noticed, it's flowing rather heavily," he reached around to hand John a rag to press to the wound.
Sherlock smiled and continued to dance, occasionally rolling his hips back to grind his arse against his fiance's groin. He closed his eyes and threw his head back, focusing on the music and the feel of John behind him.
Mary squealed happily, "brilliant! See you both there!" She picked up her tray and waved goodbye, headed back to the table with the other cheerleaders.
John kept his eyes purposefully averted from the bar and the girl with the bottle, and turned towards the dance floor. He grinned and tugged Sherlock over, for the first time feeling confident in his abilities. As soon as they hit the floor, he turned his back to Sherlock's front, putting the other boy's hands on his hips, and grinding to the rhythm of the song.
Sherlock awoke with a soft hum and his eyes flickered open to look up at his wonderful fiancé. "Good morning, love," he mumbled sleepily and stretched his legs.
Sherlock beamed and leaned in to kiss John on the lips. "I love you too, darling. More than anything in the universe." He rested their foreheads together and closed his eyes. Life couldn't be more perfect than it was right now.
Sherlock slept soundly the rest of the night and woke relieved that he was safe in John's arms. He began placing kisses along his jaw and hugged him around his waist.
"But I want to. I'll find a way to make it work." John thought about it for a moment. Maybe he should get a job. Since he wasn't doing rugby anymore, and he didn't have to spend much on anything but gas for his bike, he might be able to save up enough over the rest of the year for a ring and still have money for school...That is if he worked every single day for eight hours. He sighed, wishing that he wasn't in such a sorry financial state.
"Well, I don't know about a stick, but I think father has a cane he doesn't use..." Sherlock joked and smiled brightly down at John.
Sherlock moaned into the kiss and started rocking his hips. He pulled away with a gasp and breathed heavily against his fiancé's mouth. "If I knew no one would walk in on us... I would take you right here on the sofa," he murmured huskily.
"Want to play another round? Or..." Sherlock sat his controller down and moved to straddle his lover's lap, "would you rather go to my room and collect your prize?" He leaned in and nipped John's earlobe, breathing hotly on the wet skin afterward.
arse. The longer he spent in Sherlock's company, the more attracted to him he became. He felt heat shoot downwards as Sherlock took on the new position and he went over to the bed, deciding to straddle Sherlock. "For someone without any experience, you are very good at this," he said, voice a few octaves lower.
John pulled away from Sherlock long enough to hug Ms. Rodin as well. "Thank you, but..." he said as he pulled away. He was feeling some of his guilt returning as they all praised him on doing so well. "I almost ruined everything. And because of me, Sherlock had to testify after all." He bowed his head. "I really didn't do well at all."
In mid-January, the night before he would be leaving to perform surgery in Bruges, John came to Sherlock's bed for the first time in weeks and slept with his head on Sherlock's pillow. He woke to long, splayed fingers on his abdomen under his shirt, and he thought his heart would break when Sherlock noticed he was awake and looked as if he didn't know whether he could leave his hand there or not.
They check for brain-scent next. She investigates the stones, the wall, the street. She's thorough and focused, attention slipping only once when a baby with a ripe nappy goes by in a pram, which is good for her age. After fifteen minutes she's given them no positive response so they conclude Holmes' skull hadn't cracked open when he hit and call her off.
Mycroft remembered Montague Street, remembered hunching over his brother's body and hyperventilating as he dialled 999, silently begging
They were so very quiet. The only sounds in the room, this cocoon of warmth and privacy, were the soft, wet noises of their coupling and the even breathing of two men falling into rhythm. John's expression was peaceful as Sherlock slipped in and out of him slowly, meditatively, entering him again and again for the sheer delight of John's almost imperceptible quiver when he seated himself fully.
"I thought you might like to review your patient's progress," Mycroft said, handing John a paper medical file.
Once he'd cleaned the mess and washed up to make tea, he sat with a mug and an untouched apple and realised he'd decided to fight after all.
Pixie's a fine young bitch with a good work ethic and a businesslike sense of purpose that all the best dogs have. When Jason asks her to find blood-scent, she goes straight to the flagstones without even putting nose to ground and assumes the
He left a message on Sherlock's mobile as well as notes in the kitchen, bathroom, both bedrooms, and on the sofa, and took a taxi to and from the shop, expense be damned.
"You know," John said, even though the smarter part of his brain was urgently waving its metaphorical arms
He shifted a pile of journals from the chair seat to the floor, then from there to the top of another stack on the desk. That left him holding the headphones, about which he dithered momentarily before tossing them onto the newly emptied chair because he
more than we can possibly repay, you and I, but let's not give her a promissory note since we all know how that sort of thing turns out, okay? My heart couldn't take it. All mistakes and blunders are entirely my own.
He had many regrets, but few things he could have done differently. He'd had fewer options in the past, less experience, less influence, a shorter perspective.
at me, and I absolutely cannot get rid of the beer whilst I'm being watched but I'm going to cramp in the worst places if I don't—"
He supposed he should have been offended to have his person used to slake desire engendered by a bovine dairy product, but John was becoming pleasingly skilled at fellatio and it gave him a chance to reacquire his phone.
"Well, of course he has. He's certainly not foolish enough to leave it with my brother." Mycroft was very careful not to touch him, not to move into his personal space. "John, walk with me."
“Stay down!” Tobin roared, shoving at Sherlock's head and wedging his shoulder above it. “Give me the phone,” he said, and John fumbled to pass it back even as he hunkered over the steering wheel. “Just drive, keep going, I'll tell you where in a minute.”
Greg indulged in something dangerously, embarrassingly close to cuddling as their sweat dried. His arse burned and tickled with lube. He stretched and sighed, debauched and contented, drunk on touch, and ruffled dark, damp hair affectionately before the man rolled off. “Thanks for that,” he said. He could feel himself smiling, feel peace and optimism settle over him like golden light. “For all of this. Thank you.”
He takes a deep breath. Right. He's not going to judge. It would be hypocritical, just the sort of thing the know-nothing dicks do to his dogs. He won't be like that.
“I set Lestrade's flat on fire, so he'll need to stay here until he finds a new one,” Sherlock informed him. Mycroft noted the absence of the word “accidentally.”
"Well, I mean, if it was just family there then of course I wouldn't have expected an invitation but you could have told—"
leftover takeaway box he'd opened faded before he tried eating. There would have to be another talk with Sherlock about labelling. The contents had been...vivid. And squirming.
Harassing the swans. He was going to get another ASBO, and it was going to be for harassing the bloody swans that had knocked him near-senseless. He glanced again at the calendar of John James Audubon prints hanging behind the constable's desk and knew he had no chance of getting out of this one. His requests to make a phone call had been punted into administrative limbo and he was certain that if he tried to make an issue of it the constable would find a reason to leave him sitting in his wet pants for another three or four hours.
John looked over at Sherlock as the car started to move, feeling guilty. He hadn't wanted to hurt Sherlock's feelings, but he knew that if they got into anything he'd never make it home. He scooted over towards him, putting a hand on his shoulder. "Sherlock?"
John smiled, kissing him back. "I love you, too, my heart and my life." He gazed at Sherlock in silence for a moment, memorising him, and then reluctantly got out of the car. He headed into the flat with one last wave.
Sherlock groaned and removed his fingers. He kissed the back of John's neck again as he reached for the lube. Then he coated his erection in it and guided himself to his lover's entrance. He moaned loudly at the sensation and braced once hand next to John's hip, his other one next to his head.
Sherlock felt his heart breaking again when he came outside and found John. He immediately walked up to him and wrapped his arms around him, pressing a kiss to his temple before resting his cheek on the top of his head. "I'm so sorry, love... I'm sure he'll come around," he said and rubbed the shorter boy's back soothingly.
John kissed Sherlock in return, slowly and lovingly. He pulled away and smiled up at him, bringing one hand to cup his cheek. "Are you feeling better?" he asked softly.
John squeezed Sherlock's hands, using his position to hold him in place. This was a moment he never wanted to forget. Their first time making love as a married couple. He slowly started thrusting, his own tongue tangling with Sherlock's, the familiar taste of his filling his mouth.
John nodded. Sherlock was right, of course. There was no reason he should hide it. Worst case scenario would be a little fight and not speaking for a bit. But his father did love him, and he should be happy that he found someone he truly cared about. "I'm sorry, Sherlock. You're right." He looked up into his eyes, biting his lip. "Forgive me?" he asked softly. "I'll bring you home with me right now and we can tell him together, if it will make you happy."
Sherlock moaned and gripped onto the rail tighter, "and y-you're so big, I... ohhh, I love how you feel inside me," he panted. "Ohhhh,
John could tell as soon as he saw Sherlock's eyes that he was trapped in some fantasy of his sleeping mind. But he hadn't expected him to shut down as he had that first day they were together. He set the flowers down and ran over to Sherlock, immediately bringing his mouth close to his boyfriend's ear. "Love, it's me. It's John. I'm right here with you." He wrapped his arms around Sherlock, rubbing his back to try to soothe him.
Part of John was still surprised not only by Sherlock's eagerness to full on snog, but his talent for it. The other part of him was completely lost in the sensation as he sucked on Sherlock's tongue, even going so far as to gently nip it. His hips continued to roll against Sherlock's, trying to get friction between them, and his hands moved to his chest, smoothing up to his shoulders, then down his body, over to his sides.
He didn't have any nightmares that night, miraculously and the rest of the week went by without incident. Soon it was Friday and he was sitting on a bench outside the court room with John, grasping tightly to his hand as they waited to go inside.
Sherlock watched as John pulled on his clothes, raising an eyebrow at his choice in pants. He sensed something was wrong and when his fiancé told him that his father wanted him to come home that afternoon, he was pretty sure he knew why. He smiled up at John and kissed him goodbye, "Later, love."
Sherlock picked up his fork and started eating. "I think what I'm most afraid of is seeing him again. I don't know if I'm ready for that," he said softly.
Sherlock snuggled into John, "I'm a little sore, but okay otherwise." He looked up at John, "how are you? You're the one who had to find me... like that," he said softly and started tracing patterns on John's chest.
Helen shook her head, "I'm sorry, no... If something happens while he's up there, you can, but you can't be next to him." Sherlock swallowed and grabbed John's hand tighter. "Are you
John groaned and pulled down Sherlock's trousers. He started to grind harder now that there was only the thin fabric of their pants between them. After another minute he started to move his lips down to Sherlock's collarbone, sucking a mark there while his hands trailed to his lover's hips, fingers slipping under the elastic of his pants.
John's breathing was laboured as he nearly sobbed with the sensations. "Ah...Oh, yes...Fuck, yes, Sherlock!" With a few hard slams between both of their efforts, John was coming hard, spilling out onto Sherlock's chest and abdomen. He made sure that he clenched his muscles tightly around his lover's cock as he rode his orgasm.
Sherlock chuckled, "yes, we do. I plan on tutoring you to help your grades so you have a better chance of getting into Uni. Besides, I get to go back with you today, remember?" He kissed John on the forehead and jumped out of bed. Then he grabbed the bottom of the comforter that was covering him and yanked it off. "Get up!"
Sherlock smiled, "sure am." He held the shower curtain back and held out his hand, "after you, dear," he said cheekily and winked.
Finally, he brought his mouth to his fiancé's cock, hovering over it and licking his lips before sucking just the head in his mouth. He swirled his tongue around it and listened to John's reactions.
John looked up at Sherlock as the other boy rolled them over. He smiled and put a hand to his cheek. "Do anything you like. I trust you." He knew that Sherlock would take good care of him and he would listen if John needed him to stop.
He started to whimper audibly, the shaking getting more intense as he tried to focus on something else,
John couldn't continue. He let Sherlock hold him as he fully turned and burrowed against him, crying softly. After a while, he finally had gotten himself together enough to speak, but he kept his face against Sherlock's neck. "That whole story," he said. "It was part of the reason why I was afraid of telling Da about us. Because I knew that he'd be thinking about me winding up the same way. But I would never drink, not after that. It terrifies me."
Sherlock wrapped the towel around John's shoulders as he came out of the shower and gave him a kind of backwards hug before releasing him to finish drying off. "I have to say I feel a lot better about you going to school now that Moran won't be there."
Sherlock sighed, "my bed actually feels a lot colder without you here... this really sucks," he murmured.
John smiled, heart warmed and chest swelling in happiness. He snuggled into Sherlock and sighed in content. "I'm lucky I found you. To think one minute could have changed everything and I might have missed out on you."
Sebastian had gathered up a few of the rugby players and walked over to the bench where John was sitting. He clenched his jaw and knocked the tray out of the shorter boy's lap to get his attention. "Where's the freak?" he growled and smirked.
John grinned. "Yes, I guess I will." He tilted his head up to capture Sherlock's lips in a tender kiss.
Sherlock chased John around the pool until he cornered him in the shallow end, pinning his wrists to the wall. "Alright... Surrender now, or else," he said breathlessly.
John's cheeks took on a rosy glow as he realised that this was the song playing the first time they made love. He took Sherlock's hand and smiled, moving in close to him when they made it on the floor. He was getting the hang of dancing now, and really enjoying it as well. He rested his head on Sherlock's chest as they swayed to the music.
Sherlock relaxed, glad John didn't ask him what he meant. That was a part of his past he wasn't sure John could accept. "Don't linger on them," he said, sensing what John was trying to do, "you give them more power when you do that. Just... think about something else, something that makes you happy."
It was like a switch was flipped inside Sherlock's brain at John's words. All of a sudden, it wasn't his fiancé beneath him, but Sebastian. He gasped loudly, his eyes widening and he fell backwards onto the floor. "N-no... You can't hurt me anymore," he said, voice shaky. He scrambled to his feet and started running as fast as he could, not looking back.
John had to keep his eyes closed as the world was spinning, but he had a smile on his face. He opened them once Sherlock had kissed him and smiled back at the other boy. "I don't have anything going on today. I'll stay as long as you like." He pulled Sherlock down for another quick kiss, finding his lips just couldn't get enough contact with his.
"Well, it's a good thing that the feeling is mutual, then." John moved his hands down a little lower, lightly cupping Sherlock's arse.
Sherlock groaned and grabbed onto John's hips, guiding him down onto his cock. He threw his head back, panting and trying to calm himself down. "
Mary's eyes widened a bit, "okay... Let me ask around, maybe someone's seen him. Be right back," she said and ran off to start questioning the guests.
John squeaked a little when Sherlock poked him and rubbed his side. He decided to play along with Sherlock's fake anger. "Aw, Sherlock. Of course it's not, I was teasing." He scooted close and kissed his lover's ear. "Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?"
Sherlock smirked and reached a hand down to stroke his lover's thigh. "Come on, love. Finish for me, I want to hear you shout my name when you come." He leaned in and started nibbling on John's ear, breathing hotly against it.
"He thought that someone was trying to hurt him," John finished for him. "He separated himself from what he thought was going to happen." It all made sense now. It was scary for him to see Sherlock like that, but at least now he knew better. It was just a defence mechanism.
Mycroft did not look up from the report he was poring over when Sherlock dropped insolently into the chair, merely slid a copy of the registrar's document across the desk in response. "Explain about Victor, and he may forgive you for this."
To every single person who read, subscribed, lurked, gave kudos, bookmarked, and commented:  Thank you.  No fanauthor writes in a vacuum, and the feedback and encouragement you provided was essential.
person—a bloke might make a fairly accurate stab at why his flatmate was in bed with him, sound asleep, one hand on the back of John's neck, face buried in his hair, inhaling short, deep
He took another look in the box. “It's got six legs,” he observed calmly, which he thought was really admirable under the circumstances.
Then Lestrade was there with a serial suicide and a note, and Sherlock had been in a cab for ten minutes before he thought of John Watson's questions again.
John recovered first. "Good," he said, a bit breathlessly. "That's good." In a firmer tone, he commanded, "Now stay still." He maintained eye contact whilst his warm hands slid down the body laid out beneath him, thumbs flicking over flushed nipples, fingers curling through damp hair below the navel. He made an obscenely satisfied noise as he slicked Sherlock's erection.
particular tone was a conditioned reflex inculcated by drill sergeants and senior surgeons the world over, but he was still annoyed to find that his legs had carried him over the threshold without conscious decision on his part. He went far enough from the cabin that the noises from within wouldn't mask the sounds of anyone approaching, although the rain was still falling steadily enough that they'd have to be in a Humvee for him to hear anything until they were right on top of him.
“Yoo hoo, boys, your milk's come, and one of your papers. Oh, and Mrs Turner's married ones have sent you a wedding present.” She offered it to Sherlock, who waved it towards John and took the paper instead, snapping it open to read the headlines and ignoring John's tightly furious expression. “The way you boys went about things, we didn't have a chance to throw you a proper reception. Of course you have everything you need, I suppose. Not like you need another toaster or a set of monogrammed towels.”
He sent the text, counted to ten, and nodded to Tobin, both of them ducking inside. A quick scan told him Sherlock had no immediately obvious injuries, thank God, but he was less than pleased to see them.
Sherlock hadn't planned to use the handcuffs. He'd stood up to face the stairs when he'd heard a key in the door, and when his fierce, stubborn John had come over the threshold and dropped his bag against the wall Sherlock had just stood there, breathing more rapidly than usual because he'd been sucking on the latest patch to soothe his anxiety but instead it had only been getting worse.
Not knowing who to trust meant no backup, either, beyond the colonel whose name he didn't even know, much less what his background or skills were or, for that matter, if he was actually Mycroft's man for certain, although it looked that way.
Sherlock stood up and looked at him intensely for a long moment. “You should feel honoured, Inspector,” he said at last, mockingly. “He doesn't often invite any of you
“Believe me when I say names are hardly necessary.” The hand in his clasped firmly, warm and dry, and all right, an anonymous shag wasn't what Greg had been hoping for, but it would do. He let his fingertips brush the inside of the wrist just below the cuffs and didn't imagine the quick indrawn breath from the other man. “Would a thirty-year Talisker suit your refined palate?”
He couldn't bring himself to look at John directly, but the window made a perfectly adequate mirror. He noted the stress lines around dark eyes, the tension in the set of the unshaven jaw. Impossible to miss the rigidity of the spine, the fixed stare out the window. Sherlock still had enough self-control not to actually cringe but something under his sternum clenched and made itself into a small, tight ball.
Astonishingly, the frame was not the most horrifying aspect of what he now held. That distinction was reserved for the newspaper page matted beneath the glass, a newspaper page on which, under "Public Announcements," it was printed for all the world to see that amongst the other noteworthy events of the day a civil union had been contracted between the parties of—
On that day in June when everything goes so very badly so very fast, Robbie's not in on the chase, and he's glad for that at least. He's at NSY when they bring Watson in for questioning, though, and a more wrecked creature is hard to imagine. When Robbie hears about the jump off Bart's, he understands why.
I had to do something. It's your fault it had to be something drastic. If you'd just abided by the agreement—”
Oh, bollocks. Brain death was the only one that mattered, and he'd been full minutes away from that. Sherlock scoffed. Tried to. The endotracheal tube had badly irritated his throat and the sounds he made were not the ones he had intended.
The odds of either of them living to forty-five were slim. The best working compromise they'd come up with involved cocaine and divorce papers. There was a fucking human placenta spread over the six-pack of nice beer John had bought for watching the game with Greg and had explicitly declared off-limits to experiments.
and he sounded so scared that John knew it was bad, very bad. Then the pain grabbed him by the guts and tore all the air away everywhere and he tried to roll to cover but his arm—his arm wouldn't—
A shame to have had to make the dahlia comment, but John really could not be allowed to go out looking like that. He'd been very irresponsible lately, often leaving Sherlock alone and bored at the flat while he went to the pub or cinema or some tedious restaurant or, as had nearly happened just two days ago, home with whatever forgettable individual he happened to be with at the time (although that had not
to John, you can't take it, he needs it, it needs to be here when he gets back, you don't understand, don't
Sherlock looked as delighted as if it were Christmas and his birthday wrapped up with high explosives and a diseased pancreas. John felt like he'd been dragged behind a lorry from Bristol to Bath without a chance to shower afterwards and then expected to sit exams in theoretical physics. He followed the conversation a bit better when "tactical counterstrike" came up, but the brothers appeared to be communicating in a high-speed shorthand of their own in which few sentences were completed and entire plans of action were referred to by single phrases.
As if it physically pained him to say the words, Sherlock choked out, "Cabled ones." They both winced.
And Robbie hadn't liked Anderson from that moment on because the way he talked about Holmes had reminded Robbie of the way some of the constables used to talk about Jamie when she was just doing her job and doing it damned well. Besides that, he had heard the man use “bitch” as an insult, which was not a fit way to think of woman nor dog.
Damnably hard to breathe.  He really couldn't keep this up much longer.  “You were quite useful, you know, in the negotiations.  Your vehement outrage over our fine young soldiers smeared to a red paste—aren't the media convenient?—allowed me to argue that the insult to our national honour would result in a nuclear option if accords were not reached at the table.”
When in the small hours of the morning he fell into a fitful doze, he dreamt of a t-shirt, rank with the stench of terrified alpha, undertones of piss beneath apocrine and adrenaline, and barely rolled off the side of the bed onto his hands and knees before he vomited bile.
So, with their eyes locked, he shook his head fractionally and felt the fragile, newborn rapport between them flare and die. Face tight, Sherlock shoved open the door and kicked it shut behind him. Footsteps pounded down the corridor, and all the oxygen in the room drained away.
Sherlock continued to stare, waiting for something. "The case," he repeated, with more emphasis, "is over."
A dark shape dropped from the plane tree behind the gazebo and observed dispassionately, "Less surface area to dissipate the kinetic force. Luckily you have ample padding to absorb the impact. Clavicle?"
Christ, how green are you? You realise there'll be an automatic alarm when the second scheduled patrol misses check-in? We need to get out of here now." He rummaged in Mycroft's suit pocket. "Got it. Let's go, fuckwit,
An accident report filed for the cab John had taken allowed them to find the relevant CCTV footage. It appeared he had voluntarily entered an ambulance to assist a patient and had then been refused exit. It was not clear if force or coercion had been involved.
Once, long ago, a rugby ball had hit John's solar plexus very, very hard. For some reason, he remembered that now.
M/M sexytimes herein, darlings. If you've read this far and are still telling yourself that kind of thing isn't for you, please research the phenomenon known as "denial."
By 03.00, it was simply absurd to go back to the bedsit for a few hours' sleep before moving his scant possessions to Baker Street, and when Sherlock yawned and said, “Mrs Hudson put my spare sheets in the linen cupboard; you may as well take them upstairs to your bed,” John yawned too and nodded and slept that night with Sherlock's faint scent tickling his still-stuffy nose.
“Ta very much; just my life we're talking about here. And you’ll have to find another flatmate if I get killed.”
Sherlock briefly contemplated John's state of mind upon waking with a hangover in the bed of an infatuated young man who had offered his body on the assumption John shared his sentiment. It would be Spectacularly Not Good.
John rolled his eyes. Yes, of course the man who thought putting product in your hair meant you were gay would think having diabetes meant you'd specialise in endocr—
on the far side of the pond would likely be spent by the time he was able to walk that far, given that merely pulling on his trousers that morning had left him breathless and trembling for fifteen minutes.
"I—" John was so empty. There was no-one in that shell sitting on the edge of the bed, the bed that was still rumpled and wet, that smelt of pleasure and warmth and soft murmured words. Didn't those words mean yes? Didn't their mingled semen on the sheets, the touch of John's lips on his neck mean the same as that stupid word? Why couldn't John see that? He was losing
“I have no experience to go on in this area, John. I am not able to predict...anything. Tell me—” John heard him swallow. “You don't trust me now. Tell me what I’d have to do to fix this.”
Omega arrogance radiated from the sharp, thin figure leaning ostentatiously on an umbrella, leaving no doubt as to his race and sex. With the detached hypervigilance that had slid over him when the bedsit door had opened, John noted the bespoke tailoring that could not conceal a gun, and the empty chair—just one—offset to the right. There were three points in the room at which an unseen sniper could be positioned. Of course, it could be they'd just go for a close-range shot in the chair once the suit left.
"I hope you like it. If the two of you didn't want a fuss then I certainly don't want to make one. Just your brother and John's sister there, I expect, and perhaps John wore that nice suit of his. I wondered why he was getting such a fine set of clothes and I—well, of course I
"I might have preferred that particular announcement to have been something more than a point in that bloody game of yours. And for you to have waited until I'd actually said yes."
The look John shot him had made mere corporals piss themselves. With a glance at Mrs Hudson, he pressed his lips together and popped open the flaps of the box. The card on top of the gift read,
Mycroft continued, "You would of course wish to begin making connections, talking to parents about school choices and the like, planning for the future."
"Lumbar sprain, sounds like. Rob'll take care of that. Let me see your wrist." He deftly got the cabbie's coat off and slid on a splinting cast. "Up you get, now," he told her, and he and John helped her into the back of the ambulance. Once she was settled, he said to John, "Looks like you got knocked about a bit."
The thing was, he understood why Sherlock hadn't said anything to him. Sherlock to that day didn't understand why Constable Lestrade hadn't left the shivering, starved smart-arse who looked like a damned
They made meaningless small talk for a few more minutes, John so distracted by Sherlock's tapping that he could not have said later exactly when Mycroft left. He could hear the popping of the logs in the fire, the patter of rain against the windowpane, the hiss of car tyres outside.
John was rather looking forward to it. It wasn't as exciting as chasing murderous villains over the rooftops but it was a damned sight better than yet another bloody run to Tesco.
said to surrender to get to enemy headquarters. Patently wrong.” Sherlock had started tapping again.
John frowned into his whiskey glass and set it on the side table. "What do you mean, you panicked him into—?" Almost immediately his lips thinned. "It was the bloody armour, wasn't it?"
It was efficient; it was elegant. Sherlock, the Work, and John. Yes. And John would like it. He would see how very clever the plan was and shake his head admiringly and say, "Brilliant!"
take a bullet when they were supposed to, but have you considered that if they're going to die either way, they might prefer to let the obnoxious bastard that is your good self die alongside them?"
"Certainly, Dr Watson. I know just the place. Excellent quality, surprisingly affordable." Since Mycroft would end up subsidising the lion's share of it, it certainly would be. In fact, any of this particular tailor's other patrons would be very surprised indeed if they ever discovered the pittance John Watson would actually be paying himself. "And might I inquire if you will be needing the services of a jeweller as well?"
Draped bonelessly over the sofa, Sherlock heard footsteps on the stair, heard concern and resignation and irritation, and heard too that yes, John was more than a little drunk.
The solution was, of course, obvious once the third data point was factored in. Sherlock examined the plan from several angles. Oh, it was
"Congratulations, John, you've not attended a single forensics course in your life and you've just surpassed Anderson's observational skills, although really that's faint praise as the same could be said of a hydrocephalic lemur. Now you know how he got out, Lestrade; even you can take it from here. And Lestrade?" Sherlock openly raked his eyes over John's arse behind the doctor's back.
On his slow perambulations along the bleak garden paths—exercise had not grown any less hateful since he had last resorted to it—he often wondered what might have been.
He had to swallow repeatedly until the nausea receded. “You know how it is when your heat’s coming on, how you want to protect them, make them feel better, make them feel safe.”
He'd felt a whisper of touch as Sherlock had moved off, and when he casually slipped his hand into his pocket his fingers closed over slips of embossed metal on a chain.
John considered this, then shook his head. “Nope. That's not all of it or you'd not have kept it a secret. You'd have told me and tried to steamroll me into agreeing retroactively.”
“Mrs Hudson, why don't you leave now before John scalds himself further with that tea? The next injury may occur in his lap.”
He slammed the refrigerator door shut, clapping a hand over his mouth and trying not to breathe through his nose.
.  I've said it before:  this would have been a completely different story without her, and a poorer one.  If you've enjoyed this story, you owe her more than you know.  Kiss kiss, sweetie.
Sherlock raised a miserable face and John could have laughed but it was too heartbreaking. "I'm not leaving you. I just...don't know if this is the right thing just now. That's all. All right? Please use your voice, I'm worried I've scared you mute. I'll get struck off for that."
The blip on Mycroft's phone led them to an abandoned car on a spur of road behind a hedgerow. After some investigation they found John's mobile switched off and wedged deeply between the seat and backrest on the passenger side.
This is Victor all over again. Not this time, Mycroft. You're not the only one with influence anymore."
Tobin clattered up the stairs before John answered. Sherlock would have been considerably less distracted over the next few hours had John said yes.
Cocksucking wouldn't ever be his favourite kind of sex, but oh, he'd missed this—Sherlock, hot and wet and
fling it at his unrepentant, foolish head. At last he blew out his breath and said, "I can't fix this one for you, Sherlock. I could have made the register entry disappear but too many people have seen the announcement. He will find out. It will be much worse if it doesn't come from you first." He rapped the pages of the report square and dropped the folder into his briefcase. "You have until tomorrow afternoon. That's when we three will be hosting a small luncheon, ostensibly to introduce John to the people you'll be investigating. Someone is bound to mention it to him then."
Life with Sherlock was like being continuously concussed. He wondered idly how he would ever be able to tell if he had traumatic brain injury, given what passed for normal on any given day.
Now Sherlock did turn around, and he dragged his eyes across the floor, up the line of the desk, to Mycroft's face. "Sometimes he wears cardigans."
Meanwhile, Sherlock had deduced River was Rory's daughter and the killer in the spacesuit but as the programme still had the full series less one episode to run John probably wouldn't appreciate his mentioning it. There had been a sharp and emphatic discussion about how
Greg had fervently hoped to decant John from his car into Sherlock's tender care and leave immediately for home (where five cans of good beer were waiting to dull the pain of the last little slice of eternity), but God was still holding a grudge and he'd instead been press-ganged into getting John up the stairwell and settled into the flat.
Author's note: M/M sexytimes herein. If that's not your cup of tea than I don't know how you missed it in the previous chapters but you'll want to be going now.
Even as he was jerking upright, trying to kick free of the blankets and roll, Sherlock's voice was saying, "Car, John, backfire. Just a car." Sherlock's arm was still flung over his waist where it had been when they'd fallen asleep, but wisely he had not tried to restrain him.
Intriguing. Why would John Watson be in need of a good suit? Besides the obvious fact that his current clothing was beyond deplorable, he was rarely in circumstances that required one. Mycroft observed more closely. Oh.
him facedown onto the bed. "You could have let me piss first," John panted. "It's been a long trip and I had coffee."
"My apologies." Mycroft tipped his head but his eyes never shifted from the angry pale ones in front of him. "If you agree, we could use you today, as soon as you can be ready to travel. A rather delicate situation involving reconstruction in a dominant hand; an excellent candidate for experimental surgery, I am assured."
John sat and, being practical, spooned eggs onto a plate. You simply never knew when you were going to get a chance to eat whilst running around after Sherlock.
Sherlock wandered into the room in his dressing gown, hair wet from his own shower. He saw Mycroft, grunted sourly, and continued on to the refrigerator, where he extracted one of Mrs Hudson's currant buns and began pulling off bites with his fingers, noisily popping them into his mouth and spitting out the fruit.
Though there wasn't any reason for awkwardness, John thought, running his hand lightly over shoulders that were far too thin. The two of them had slept together before, back when things were still—well, you couldn't call it
Mycroft closed his eyes briefly. "Yes, we do," he said patiently, "and I am proposing to make you one of them."
It was sheer chance that the mirror usually over the fireplace was propped on the floor at an angle that showed him Sherlock, weariness in every line of his body, hanging up his coat and pausing for the smallest moment to rest his head against the wall before settling his spine back into the familiar arrogant carriage and schooling his expression to indifference.
Minutes later she plucked it back out, smoothed it, and put it away in her keepsake drawer. She would throw it away. She would. Just not yet.
“Your therapist,” said the suit as he reached into the inner pocket of his jacket and withdrew a small brown notebook, “thinks you have suicidal tendencies stemming from depression. For God's sake, get rid of her. She can't even tell that the reason you're losing weight is that you've inadequate funds for meals.”
There were lancet marks on Banks' fingertips from checking his glucose levels and the outline of an insulin syringe in his pocket and yes, some diabetics did carry one around but he couldn't take insulin without eating soon afterwards so why—?
There was a bottle of thirty-year Talisker on his kitchen table when he got home that evening. He sat with his head in his hands for a long time.
He's been working on the Dog Squad with his new partner for over a year when he gets a call from DI Lestrade: can he
And so Harris, the idiot, never questioned Sherlock's tucking his bleeding hand in his trouser pocket as he limped slowly around the car to the passenger door.
John put a hand to his head. "Did I miss something? No, no, wait—you always do this when you're trying to change the subject—"
John remembered, and no-one had taken Tobin's place by Sherlock's side. He shuddered. Yes, this was ugly and complicated and far, far above his head; what had Mycroft been thinking, to involve the both of them in something so important?
Take a minute, Sherlock. Take a damned minute and consider that you just shocked four homicide detectives. Christ, two of us remember the shit that used to come out of your mouth when you were high, and you still—” Greg shut his eyes and sucked in a breath slowly. “Get out.” He slammed the door, then had to lean one hand against the aluminium and press the other into his ribs until he could stand straight again.
In front of a door midway down the corridor was Murray, sat in a plastic chair with his revolver resting in his lap. John frowned. Mycroft ought still to be in surgery, oughtn't he?
He could do this for hours. He could do this for days. He hoped he'd have a lifetime to do this, to explore this man in every way possible, to let quiet passion run through his hands and his mouth and his cock, because Sherlock needed it, needed to be shown what he felt since neither of them was likely to say the words. Absurd but true: neither of them could choke them out, despite everything.
“I don't think it's a good idea for us to do this now,” John said. In the shower, he'd realised he still had dried come on his stomach from just before he'd walked out at Mycroft's house all those hours ago. Nothing was better since then, nothing was fixed, and he was angry and exhausted and he was indeed pissing blood and he just knew Sherlock would push all his buttons because that's what he
When he was feeling particularly egotistical, he let himself think that maybe Sherlock had also needed to get out because it was becoming harder to resist shagging like ferrets and he was still adamant about not raising John's blood pressure. Through sex, anyhow; he had no problems raising it with a tripwire minefield impeding urgent trips to the toilet and with unspeakable things done to John's favourite kettle. John had pointed this out. The resulting domestic had definitely raised his blood pressure.
