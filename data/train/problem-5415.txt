“Hey,” Deanna says, holding the machete, watching some of the Campbells head towards where they think the lair is. “Maybe, you know, tone it down on the freaky psychic shit. Just while they’re watching.”
Gabriel ignores the first question, but Deanna’s too busy hauling Cas up to notice. “That sigil is outdated,” Gabriel finally says. “It only works on angels who are – pure, for lack of a better word.”
Things get pretty busy after that, what with the young kid who sold his soul to an angel for a piece of the Staff, what with how Victoria cocks a gun at Cas when she tries to root around through the kid’s brain, what with how Cas’s wings flare out in enormous shadows and how Victoria’s hand quakes but does not lower. What with the way Cas is cold and not at all unsure like she was the last time Deanna truly spoke to her, and the way Deanna can’t look away from her – she holds herself more like a soldier than she ever has. If what she says is true, she started a civil war in Heaven. If what she says is true, she’ll do anything to win it.
, Michael will say, voice soft and quiet, like Castiel’s, like Mary’s, like a friend.
The girlthing laughs. “Not quite, but I’ll still help you out. This is your apocalypse, yes, but I’m not sure it’d be so fun for the rest of us.”
Deanna doesn’t say,
Deanna had illusions. Sammy was perfect, dad was right, mom was beautiful. Deanna knew those things like clockwork. She didn’t question them for a long time. Maybe she should have.
“I’m hanging up now.”
“Be quiet,” Sammy whimpers from the back. “
And this – this is what finally breaks Cas.
, De.”
Deanna closes her eyes. She is, possibly, drunk. “No, look, I’m just – I’m sorry. We shouldn’t have brought you with us.”
, Deanna says, articulating carefully.
Sammy can’t seem to expel the demon from Bobby, and one of Deanna’s hands is pinned. She kicks up, squirming like he always tells them to do when someone’s on them.
(Later, it will not. Later, she will contemplate it. What would she do, for her younger sisters? Would she do this?
When Cas leaves, Sammy speaks up. “Don’t, De.”
Ada shrugs. “I don’t know yet.”
Deanna sleeps for two days straight. It’s not restful; it is instead filled with memories that feel like dreams and dreams that feel like memories, angry fathers and bickering siblings, whispered words in a language Deanna shouldn’t know but does. There are teeth and shapes burned into the backs of her eyelids, and when she stirs, she is forced back down by gentle fingers to her forehead, and a glimpse of gold and spun-sugar. When she does wake up, it is the inverse of drowning. Suddenly, she can breathe, and yet she wishes she couldn’t.
“My mother,” Crowley says, “is a perfectly nice woman.”
“Sure,” Deanna says, to empty space. “Yeah, go ahead.”
Yeah, Deanna remembered. John had lost his shit, for one. It had almost seemed like he’d cared about them.
Deanna thinks she knows where this is going, even though the metaphor is kind of the worst ever. “Having Lucifer in your head was like – ”
Cas looks up. There’s blood dribbling from the corner of her mouth. It sparks with that echo of wings and terror, of lightning and pouring rain. “Yes,” Cas responds. She steps back, and gestures to Victoria – a hand, sweeping, clean lines and flashes in the dark. “I believe, as they say, the floor is yours.”
Jamie’s dying, a gunshot wound in her stomach. “Take me,” she pleads with Cas, in little Cliff’s body. “Give Cliff a life, please. Let my little brother live.”
Deanna huffs.
. Or maybe that’s just what Deanna’s hearing.
me do anything!”
Jo is sitting in the back, head in his hands. “I need to leave,” he finally says. “I can’t – I need to get out of this.”
Haniel reaches forward, gentle. They rest an arm on Ada’s wrist and it glows, fractured but healing – reminds Deanna of something Sammy told her about, broken pots repaired with gold. It doesn’t quite work, though, and Haniel sits back.
Sammy’s eyes are reflecting how Deanna feels.
Deanna’s vision flickers, splitting in two like a weird hallucination. There’s an overlay of black and gold, melding in the air, shimmering and reflecting. She frowns and shakes her head. Her vision refocuses, but the headache is back. She must make some noise, because Ada glances at her.
Deanna knows what her answer, always, always is.
“We were away,” Sammy finally settles on.
Neither of them know that Deanna can hear them, even if she’s not quite sober enough to process it. She will have bruised knuckles from breaking seven fingers and two noses.
She stitches up her arm, and Sammy leaves, muttering something about Walmart, so of course Ada and Deanna get into an argument.
Her tone is soothing, even so blunt, and Deanna’s headache recedes just a bit with the reminder of
There’s a voice on the radio that belongs to Cas. Deanna’s mother has a blank smile and an empty room. Was this what home was? Deanna can barely remember it, can barely discern where her father’s stories and the reality began. She’s met her mother – how strange a statement that is – and this pale reflection is not Mary. She can’t imagine how this would be paradise, and she wonders for a moment if she will ever have a home, she who has only known the road that stretches ahead. Zachariah’s face fizzles into existence in front of her, and there’s the touch of knives and cosmic power, blood on her skin. Deanna closes her eyes, because this, this
“Who are you?” Deanna asks again.
“Do you swear allegiance to Heaven?” Castiel asks. “To the Lord God, to the holy plan?”
“Hey,” comes Ada’s muffled voice, and a thrown bra. It looks dirty, and it catches Deanna in the face, which,
Reverence in her voice.
Cas blinks at her. “I am well, thank you.”
Deanna glances at the mirror, and recoils. The side of Haniel’s skull is caved in like somebody took to it with a crowbar, red hair sticky with blood and brain-matter. The angel in question frowns, perplexed, and then says, “Ah. This is not a vessel, you see. I pulled a few strings.” And then the injury is gone.
“Come on, get up,” Ada says. “We need to get Sam in the car.”
“There is nothing I need from you.”
Neither Sammy nor Deanna know how to respond to this. Samuel seems vaguely thrown off by their engaging in banter with a demon, but Deanna doesn’t really care. In fact, she thinks, she’d rather he be thrown off – Deanna’s lived a life defined by men, and she doesn’t mind another one being afraid of her.
“Hasn’t He done enough?” Joshua asks, turning on them. He’s soft edges and worn shirts, but his eyes are cold and empty, like the sun on a winter day. He is just as much an angel as all the rest, he simply hides it better. “He brought back Castiel for you, He saved you from annihilation when Lucifer rose. I think He deserves to take a step back.”
“Ok, and?”
(Later, Cas will ask why Deanna started praying.
Anna raves.
, but she can’t. Not when Cas looks so vulnerable. Not when she looks so horribly human and so horribly within reach.)
“Are we having fun yet?” Zachariah snaps at her. His form is flickering, and the words are breaking and splitting into chords of voices that tear at his vessel’s throat. “Are we having
Cas tilts her head at Ada. Ada steps back, and Deanna doesn’t fault her for it. The intensity of Cas’s eyes are not the only thing that shift her from heart-attack-attractive-secretary to Goddamn-angel-of-the-Lord, but the glow sure doesn’t help. “How curious,” Cas says. “Another Winchester.”
(They will have this argument many times. They are, always, saying the same thing.
They both frown at her, their stare-off broken.
“Well,” the girlthing amends. “Your world is ending.”
Because Sammy wasn’t perfect, but Sammy was good. Sammy was always good. She didn’t say it.
Ada slumps.
“No,” Ada says, and then she puts a hand on the muscle of Deanna’s shoulders and neck, where her tattoo is. The pain in Deanna’s head lights her whole body on fire, worse than memories of Hell, and she jolts back against the door, instinctively curling
Victoria lets the silence stretch out. “Fine,” she finally replies. “You’re paying.”
Victoria said once.
“Cas,” Deanna tries, but Cas just steps forward, full of might, slamming Deanna and Sammy against the back wall of the 7-Eleven. Fingers to their foreheads, and –
Deanna raises an eyebrow.
“I have no doubts,” Castiel says peacefully. She throws back a shadow, and there are her wings and in the dark her eyes are glowing circles of blue. Sammy’s in the doorway, screaming like her own eyes are burning, like she can’t stand in front of the holiness of it. Castiel throws Ada against the wall, the last demon left standing, and Sammy makes a wounded noise and holds out a shaking hand. The demon swarms from their littlest sister, though not without dropping her on her arm with a crunch, and Castiel turns away, uncaring now, towards Sammy.
, and Deanna’s still laughing when Ruby and Sammy drag her out of there, still loose in the chest and loose in the fists, wondering where her guardian angel is.
She wakes up terrified some days, now. She watches her father die, and watches her mother kick ass, and she thinks about confronting Sammy about the demon blood running through her veins, and she wonders who her mother even was if she was making deals with the Yellow-Eyed demon.
Lucifer half-shakes their head, which is, so horribly, a Sammy-motion.
Deanna’s stomach sinks.
Cas frowns. “Dead?”
Deanna half-smiles at her, and Sammy hesitantly smiles back.
The door swings open, even though they locked it. Cas walks in, all five foot two of her filled with coiled power and a miffed expression like she can smell roadkill. Sammy’s hanging off her shoulder, high as a kite or drunk off her ass, either way completely out of it.
“ – but unfortunately, this weapon is angelic, and I don’t think you can handle it on your own.”
Deanna had replied, because theology was not her strong suit.
(Cas will show up in their motel room, many times. Deanna and Sammy both have guns under their pillows and trained on Cas before they’re even awake. Deanna, slightly more trigger-happy, shoots.
“Little violent, there,” Ada observes. It’s judgmental and younger-sibling-ish and kind of annoying, which, they haven’t even known her that long.
“Leave it,” Ada says, and this leads Deanna back to the fact that she’s still not entirely sure how Ada managed to wrangle an archangel into helping them.
“Stop calling me that,” Deanna snaps.
Deanna jumps, startled out of her skin, and sees Sammy on the stairs. “Nobody.”
The pizza tastes like cardboard in Deanna’s mouth.
. They’re all too slow to react to her, and she kicks the first one in the balls and takes a punch to the face. It feels good, it feels better than good, it feels
Anna is curling into themself, whispering and murmuring and tearing their red hair, and they slit their wrists and press their palms to sigils that banish even angels, and the first thing Sammy asks is how to write them again.
“Yes,” Deanna replies. “We do.”
for this.”
Deanna’s starting to realize that they never did in the first place.
“Yeah,” Gabriel says. “And I do have a plan, but first you two,” she points at Ada and Sammy, “better check up on Cassie there, and Deanna and I are going to have a nice little chat.”
“Your car is back at the motel,” Cas says, before Deanna can even ask.
is this!”
Ada grits her teeth. “It was horrible.”
“Holy mother of – what the

Deanna wants to rage at her, wants to rip into her and tear at her and be
Deanna half-smiles, bitter. “Probably.”
to you three,” Balthazar asks, just like Magnus. Unlike Magnus, he sounds impressed.
“Sure, anything,” Deanna says immediately. “Favor for a favor, right?”
Cas dumps Sammy on the floor. Deanna shoves forward to catch her, then winces when the pain across her hands puts bloody handprints on Sammy’s tee. She doesn’t even know how her palms can feel anything anymore; she’s sliced them open more times than she can count. Ada puts gentle fingers on Sammy’s shoulders. Ada actually likes Sammy, has taken a shine to her. Too bad she has to see the reality of them now – unable to talk to each other, high or drunk or angry all the time, so bloody-handed.
“Can you help her?” Ada asks, because Sammy’s out cold and apparently Ada’s not quite as fazed by the angel. Maybe she’s atheist. Deanna would find that funny. “Is she on something?”
“Yeah.” Deanna grits her teeth. “Yeah, I got her.”
Ada bulldozes onwards. “It’s still the – what’d you call it?”
Deanna finally understands. The states that have been ruined – they are battlegrounds of an angelic war.
So now Ada stretches her legs out in the backseat, all just-past-teenage snark. She’s barely got anything with her other than a laptop and textbooks, but she managed to hold onto some leggings and tee shirts. “I don’t need to dress like a hobo along with being one,” she says, and looks disdainfully at Sammy and Deanna’s matching flannels and bootcut jeans. But she steals Sammy’s old Stanford sweatshirt when they’re not looking – which is blatantly unfair, since it’s the comfiest thing Deanna or Sammy own – and Deanna realizes one day that the tank top she’s wearing is actually Ada’s, not hers. Ada fits in, somehow, like she’s their missing piece. Like they’ve been looking for a third, and now she’s here, even when she doesn’t understand their jokes, even when her memories of John don’t match up with theirs, even when they bicker and yell.
For a moment, Michael too is weary of this endless fight. Memories swirl through Deanna’s – their – head, of stars collapsing and harmonious choirs, of grooming feathers made of intangible things and the once-time when laughter was joyful. Deanna cannot escape it, forced to stay at the forefront of their mind as she is, and the memories start bleeding together. They’re not so different, are they? Not after all. Not after everything.
They’re bad at talking, about things like this. They always have been.
“Oh, she’ll be fine,” the Trickster says flippantly. “It’s you two I’m concerned with.”
Gabriel will snort.
, Jo asked, gesturing to a silvery triangle of scar tissue on Deanna’s arm.
Ruby looks rebellious in the backseat. Deanna snickers. This is the first time the angel has come in handy at all, and of course it’s in order to make the demon jealous. Castiel tilts her head, looking at Sammy, and in the mirror Deanna sees eyes on her cheeks, eyes on her neck, eyes on her lips. She glances back to the road and swerves into her lane.
Jo is gone, and Bobby is dull-eyed, and the house is empty.
, Deanna.”
Everything goes to shit after that.
Fine, sue her, so she was her father’s daughter. Wasn’t that all John had ever wanted?)
“I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition,” this Castiel says, and her gravelly voice is like the tolling of bells in the church-tower, like the cries of the hawks in the cold north, like the howling of the wolf in the wood that is not something monstrous but rather something wild.
Cas opens her mouth, then closes it, human and not. Teeth protrude from her neck, breaking through the skin. Her face shuts down. “I don’t have time for this.”
, everyone I’ve ever loved has left me. It sucks.” She winces, trying to wrap her wrist, but her face is set in the same stubborn lines that Sammy’s are, sometimes. “So no, I’m not going to leave you.”
, sugar. You looked so much prettier with razors in your hands. Such wasted potential.”
Deanna will not say,
Castiel ignores her. “You should not have done that,” she says, voice low and rumbling.
Ada slams the door viciously, as Deanna slides into shotgun. “You died,” Ada says flatly. “So no. It’s my car.”
“Well,” Gabriel says cheerfully. “Good for you, he’s dead now.”
future-Deanna tells her.
“Michael,” Ada says.
? Cas,” her tone is suddenly so much more frantic than she wants it to be, “your
Samuel’s body falls to the floor, his face a smashed mess. Deanna breathes out, the headache lessening, her body singing with it. She’s disconnected. She doesn’t care. On the other side of the wall, Sammy’s biting at her skin and painting a devil’s trap with her own blood. When the demons come to get them, Deanna’s got red crusted up to her wrists, and Sammy’s still wiping it off the corners of her mouth. Deanna doesn’t know how she ever fooled herself into thinking she was a good person, thinking that what her dad did was right. Humans are monsters, just as monsters are humans. Maybe Deanna’s one, too, but at least she protects her family.
So Deanna and Crowley go to Chicago.
The Alpha is laughing.
“I don’t really trust Cas, De,” Sammy says. “And Cas sure doesn’t trust us, not after the stunt we pulled with the archangels.”
“Oh, Deanna,” Alistairs says in the barn. He’s in the body of an old white man, the kind who’d try and stick his hand up Deanna’s skirt when she was little. “Oh,
, Sammy said. This was before everything, wasn’t it. Eyes made of pure light, shining white out of her eye sockets. The Morningstar – that had been the thing about her fall, the thing Deanna hated. Darkness wasn’t about darkness, it was about the absence of light.
Deanna’s future self has hair cut short, so no one can grab it. The world is full of demons and full of plague, full of people running and full of people hiding. But most terrifying of all is the complete lack of Ada and Sammy, how the Deanna of the future does not even mention them. Just barks out orders with natural authority, shoots one of her own soldiers in the back of the head, and cuffs Deanna to a wall like this is normal. And Cas – Cas is human, in what Deanna knows to be her own clothes, with hickeys on her neck and the smell of weed on her breath and a semi-automatic in her hands.
, her mother used to say.
“Just haven’t been sleeping well,” Ada tells Sammy. “Just – dreams. You know. Zachariah.”

“Oh, yeah,” Sammy says. “You

“John barely showed up more than once a year. I’d show you the birth certificate but, you know, I wasn’t really expecting…this.”
Sammy scowls and rocks the baby aggressively. “None of your business, De.”
“Righteous.”
Sammy’s stuck on one bit though. “De, you’ve…what?”
Getting the other vamps out works, until it doesn’t. Samuel and the Campbells find them, and surround them, and shove them into the room with the Alpha. All their ducks in a row. The Alpha’s barely strapped down, and Sammy snarls when they decapitate the last girl. So much for getting Samuel to trust them. Gwen puts a gun to Sammy’s head and the bullets fall right out. The building shakes. Sammy doesn’t even bleed; there’s hellfire in her eyes nowadays.
Future-Deanna leads them into a trap. She does not apologize. All of them die.
she’ll say bleakly
Deanna glances at her, but jerks her head back as the Trickster throws her head back, just laughing. “So,” Deanna says. “Who are you?”
“Fine,” Deanna calls back through the doorway, because getting the last word in arguments like that is important.
They sit in a bar with Ruby, who’s pretty and dark and smiles like she wants to eat you. Deanna’s not into girls, not really, and while that might be a lie she’s definitely not into
“Right,” Deanna responds.
Deanna’s voice comes out small, smaller than she would ever let herself be in front of her little sisters. “That I’m…good.”
"Oh, she’s somewhere in here. Haven’t seen her yet?” The Trickster glances around. “I wonder where she went! Maybe she fell down a rabbit hole. Or maybe she got out, left your two sorry asses behind.” She sticks a tongue out at them, bright blue. “Guess we’ll never know.”
Cas raises an eyebrow, and she presses a quick, smoky kiss to Deanna’s cheek, lips dry and chapped. Deanna’s heart nearly beats out of her chest.
“Shoulda called me earlier,” Bobby says, his voice gruff. “Would’ve liked to hear from you kids.”
“It’s back, and it’s turned up to at least ten.”
“Nothing,” Ada says. “You should get some sleep.”
“Yeah,” Deanna says. “Yeah.”
“Then speak,” Castiel intones.
Ada stands up.
"Ok,” Deanna says. “Ok.”
“He sounds off,” Ada says quietly. She’s walking on eggshells around Deanna, more concerned that Deanna will be mad than Sammy, whose current attitude is oscillating wildly between repentant and
“Thanks for the help today,” Deanna says.
(Deanna hated this, hated how she couldn’t help her. She used to get like this, when she was younger. She was six feet of nerd, but there were fights after which she made herself quiet.
The next day, in the Impala, Deanna’s phone rings. She doesn’t look at the caller ID before answering.
Castiel says, “I can’t.”
“No,” Ada says. “I’m not going to hunt down the – whatever he called it.”
(That scar will never leave, and she will seldom go without her scarf again. No matter what, Cas will always be branded with the mark of what she did to her siblings.
“You haven’t seen Deliverance, have you?”
.” Lorna insisted. “And there’s three stones. Well, four if you count the one I broke in half.”
“I just want to assure you that your job is not in jeopardy here, Castiel. My staff is fully aware of the situation and they’re nothing if not discreet. Just like your former housemates, they’re keeping an eye out for any… unexpected incidences of bad faith on Dr. Morningstar’s behalf.”
“Don’t you huff at me, Rainbow Brite. You did good.”
“Damn, I wouldn’t be, either,” Dean replied.
The chances the hot doctor will ever call him are about as likely as snow falling in Hell, but Dean’s got a great imagination and doesn’t let reality get in his way. He imagines the doctor wandering into his shop on a slow afternoon, maybe to get a tattoo but also maybe just to see Dean again. In his mind, Dean vacillates between rendering their meeting as the meet cute they could’ve had if they’d met almost anywhere else, and something along the lines of the first five minutes of every porno he’s ever seen. He’s kinda torn as to which version he’s enjoying more.
They were actually taking a break from their GBBO marathon to have dinner when Sam finally called back. The connection wasn’t great, and it didn’t help that Sam sounded like he was fighting through a massive headache to talk.
Sam glared at him, but also conceded the point. “What Dean’s trying to say is that just because they found a ghost in the woods and made up a scary story for the show doesn’t mean there wasn’t actually a ghost there. Sometimes the official records just don’t cover that shit.”
Amara looked down at the bag, and then up at Dean.
A slightly manic laugh escaped Dean’s lips at the euphoria of hearing Cas’s words, seeing the heartbreaking honesty in his face, and wondering how long it was polite to wait before kissing him. Cas gave him a relieved smile, as if he’d been holding it all in far too long, and Dean let out a sigh as he pulled Cas to him.
Cas smiled at that and sat back in his seat, contented. “That sounds nice.”
“One more thing,” Sam said, as Dean was about to get out of the car again. “Why didn’t you say anything sooner?”
“Yeah, she hacked NORAD once and didn’t get caught,” Dean tells him with a fond smile. “Nick doesn’t stand a chance.”
Sam thought about that for a minute and conceded. “Yeah, I guess, but
Amara grinned wider. “Ooh, he hated it. For his sake, I really hope he gets over that. Humanity is full of possibilities in a way that even omnipotence isn’t.”
Melanie was only a little disappointed that Dean hadn’t come to town with him, but she happily filled Sam in on everything she knew.
“Uh, sorry to interrupt, we’re all very happy for you both, but… uh… I have a question.” Sam hesitated, giving them both an apologetic smile as they turned to him. “I… I just need to know what it was like in there. What being trapped in that stone was like.”
Sam shook his head, but once again, Cas beamed at him while Ed watched on, taking mental notes. They ate in silence for a few minutes before Ed finally spoke up again.
Dean just sighed at that. “Okay, so what are my other options?”
anymore, but I wouldn’t attempt it under any circumstances. The risk isn't worth it. I do trust you. I just need to know that you won’t share anything you might see with your brother under any circumstances.” He glanced back toward the bathrooms where Dean still hadn’t emerged yet. “Our relationship is far to important to me to put it at risk for any reason. Do you understand?”
“Got any big plans for the weekend?”
Cas stared in horror for a moment, but then he laughed. “Or we could write one of our own.”
She flicked her fingers at the lightbulb illuminating the bunker’s entryway, and nothing happened. She turned to Jack with a broad grin. “No, I think I’m human. Isn’t that amazing?”
Lorna looked as if she were about to say something, but then just shook her head. Eventually she gave Wulf the only thing she had left. “I’m sorry.”
Dean snorted at that. “Yeah, those sorts of families are a dime a dozen in LA.”
And it wasn’t as if he didn’t also have a Quadrophenia poster buried in that bin, too. It was simply that his personal history wasn’t something he was interested in putting up for public debate via metaphorical association. He knew that wasn’t entirely rational, but this box of random bits of paper was pretty much all he had from his childhood, everything that had been his own before he’d given himself permission to go out into the world and build his own life.
He shifted in his seat and looked anywhere but at Dean. “I’m not particularly familiar with vehicle makes and models, outside of 1967 Mustangs.”
Cas glanced down at himself, whipped off the towel and tossed it on the counter. He nearly dropped the soap as he plucked it from Dean’s slippery fingers, but climbed into the tub with determination. Dean smiled at him as he set to work, soaping up his hands and running them over Dean’s warm skin.
“Lawyer,” Gabriel replies, already at work on something else on his computer.
That’s good. I had a rough night’s sleep last night too, so I think I’m gonna go lie in bed and watch a few episodes of Unnatural until I pass out. I’m gonna start keeping that list for you, though. I’ll send you anything I come across. Thanks again for the beta, and for the sneak peek at your fic. It’s gonna take me a few days to get over that one. Incredible work, as usual. :)
Cas let out a little sigh and Dean realized they were just standing there staring at each other. Getting lost in the twinkling shades of deep blue in Cas’s eyes was definitely a vast improvement to staring at the picture he couldn’t see, but he’d already spent enough time avoiding the one thing he really needed to handle.
“He’s probably out cold already.” Dean shrugged, sipping at his own coffee. “So do you wanna go back to the sofa, or back to my bed?”
Again, Impala had hesitated on replying, and Cas’s heart sank just a little bit. He was considering breaking his rules for Dean, but he hadn’t been expecting Impala to seem… hurt? It was often hard to read emotions behind text conversations, but Impala definitely seemed at least disappointed. They’d been talking online for years, and Cas had rarely even allowed himself to share entirely innocuous and generic information about himself with Impala. And now he was talking about bringing someone who knew him in real life into the fandom, and giving Impala nothing more than he’d ever had before.
“You left all the recording equipment out there,” Ed said. “Do you have a way to listen in on them from here?”
Ed leveled him with a look. “Only if you’re not about to get to the point. Now I know what you guys meant by
“I’ll follow you anywhere you want to go, Cas.”
Dean just nodded dumbly at this, but Wulf’s smile broadened.
The rest of the day went a lot more smoothly. He replied to a few more emails, fielded a phone call from a distraught parent who’d lost the packet of registration forms they needed to fill out for their child, and began working on his short speech for orientation day. Dean only needed to stand up in front of the entire incoming student body and their families for a minute or two to introduce himself, but sitting there staring at at a blinking cursor on his computer screen wasn’t helping him get much past, “Hi, I’m Dean Winchester, the new guidance counselor.”
: Right. Okay. I have a real-life friend who’s a writer, but is unsure about publishing. He thinks there isn’t a market for the kinds of stories he wants to tell. He’s not in it for a career in as an author, but I also think he simply craves an audience.
Cas ignored him and went on with his line of thought. “Azeban bathed in the water, but he’s not exactly human, and it was his spell to begin with. He might be a trickster, but he’s also not a liar by nature. And Penthia had no reason to lie to us either, since she wanted us to help with her plight. She’s also not yet entirely human, and as a creature bound to that water and with some power over it, she may not have been affected either.”
It had been a long time coming. It had been nearly five years since Marie’s high school production of Supernatural: The Musical had opened more doors for her than she could’ve ever imagined. That night, she’d met the mysterious author of her favorite series of novels and learned there was more than a kernel of  truth in the pages of those tall tales.
Cas remembers Dean’s car, the beautiful black Impala. He understands Dean’s appreciation. Dean still hasn’t noticed him, though, and he wonders if maybe he and Gabriel shouldn’t just leave and come back another day. He’s not exactly ready to confront both Dean and the stress inducing experience of shopping for a car all at the same moment, but he has no idea how to explain to Gabriel why he’s suddenly lost his power of coherency. And then he realizes he wants nothing more than an excuse to get a closer look at Dean’s tattoos. If they happen to be conveniently on display beside the exact car he’s most interested in checking out, then logically he should be hurrying over as fast as his feet can carry him. Instead, he stands there frozen, as if his shoes have been bolted to the ground. It surely wouldn’t hurt to compose himself for a moment first, he thinks. He tries to convince himself that it’s the wise and reasonable decision while his heart pounds in his chest and his palms go all clammy.
: You’re one of the best writers I know, Dean. OF COURSE you need to be friends with the nearest librarian. It’s just logical. You love words, HE loves words. It’s a match made in heaven. Even if it’s just as friends. You need some real life friends, if you’re still gonna refuse to come LARPing with me, or even come to one of our Unnatural watch parties.
“Just… try to think unsexy thoughts anyway,” Sam said with a shudder. “For my sake.”
“The only crocodiles in south Florida are along the coast, by the nuclear power plant. The Everglades are home to alligators.”
Jack smiled at him contentedly and felt the relief in Cas. Cas looked at his own fingers with a sense of wonder, rubbing them together and marveling at them, like shaking off the prickling sensation of feeling returning after his hand had been numb for far too long. Jack knew from personal experience that that was just the tip of the iceberg. He understood completely what having full possession of his own human soul had done for him, and he wanted desperately to get Cas out of this place of desolation before the full force of his choice settled over him. Amara sympathized, and they both felt a pang of anticipation for their own liberation. For the first time, they both were united in their resolve to carry out the plan they’d set for themselves, without any regret or remorse for what they were leaving behind.
Dean wishes he could see Cas’s reactions, wishes they were having this conversation face to face. He doesn’t doubt Cas’s honesty, he just misses seeing the reactions in Cas’s eyes, watching his face shift with his thoughts. There’s no logical reason he should feel this strongly about a guy he’s known for two whole days, and spent a grand total of
Cas poured them coffee while he got started whipping up a massive stack of pancakes and a mountain of bacon. The smell eventually drew Sam and Ed in from the library where they’d apparently been sitting long enough for Ed to have started to feel at home in the bunker.
“Years ago, when I’d lost my grace, I was asked if I wanted to live. I couldn’t imagine giving up on life, even with no power and no grace. I’d resigned myself to that fate once before, but it was only when I was forced by circumstance to become an angel again that I truly regretted the loss of my humanity. It was easier to be an angel, not to have to feel the full weight of humanity. But if I could’ve chosen, I would’ve remained human, to stay by Dean’s side as his equal instead of just a weapon to be wielded against our enemies.” He paused for a moment, looking down at his feet. “If Dean would even have me that way.”
Dean had girded himself against several possible outcomes for when Cas realized he was snuffling against Dean and not into an inanimate pillow. Worst-case scenario, Cas would be mortified and upset with himself, and Dean was ready with assurances that he was fine, no harm done. More than fine, in fact, but he’d wait to see Cas’s reaction before deciding if that was something he’d share with Cas.
Cas knows he’s standing there frozen just inside the door, overwhelmed by the interior of the shop plastered with a disarming array of artwork and concert posters in equal measure, and suddenly entirely unsure of what he’s even doing there. It shouldn’t surprise him that Dean’s reaction is to frown and cautiously approach him as if Cas could explode if he makes any sudden movements.
Dean thought about that for a minute. “You made the choice, though.”
Dean felt his phone buzz in his pocket and resisted the urge to pull it out and read what had to be the new schedule hitting his inbox. He and Cas both exchanged a glance, knowing the other was experiencing the same frustration.
Ed stared at him for a few moments, processing all of that, and then finally shook his head in total disbelief. “Are you sure? Because I have eyes, and I’m not totally useless at noticing shit.”
Dean and Cas just stood there for a minute, staring at each other in disbelief.
“This is exactly why I hoped you’d come. You understand more than anyone else ever could what I have experienced myself.”
“You’re the Winchesters and the fallen angel Castiel. My name really is Wulf, and I desperately need your help. My story is too long to give you the details, but I’m trapped here and powerless to free myself and… and my true love.” He said that part with resignation, as if it was a shameful thing to admit to, but then smiled up at Cas. “But I hoped that you of all people would understand my predicament.”
a little bit, so I can’t imagine dumping those feelings all over him.”
Dean nodded and tried not to let the truth of that overwhelm him. “I still don’t get it, but if this makes you happy, I guess I feel a little less guilty about the whole dragging you outta Heaven thing.”
“Considering I have a finite surface area, I suppose I should take it slow, then.”
His morning run had given him too much time to let his thoughts wander down dark alleys. Cas persisted through his usual route, though, trying to focus on the town around him waking up for a Saturday filled with family outings and first dates and life in general. He felt like he was just running through it, his headphones on listening to his own soundtrack, instead of truly letting himself participate in it. He waved to the occasional jogger he passed going in the opposite direction to him, and it constituted the most human connection he made in the half hour he spent running before returning sweaty and spent to his house to hide away from the world again. Even online, surrounded by people he considered friends, he was still hiding. He’d spent years getting to know these people without allowing them to know him. Everything in his life rang just a bit hollow.
“Yeah, no thanks.”
“You can probably still see them, Dean,” Sam replied. “So that’s something.”
While Dean and Cas hatched plans for research into the curse and whether they could reverse it, little stray notes of concern crept into each of their minds, only to be forcefully squashed down and redirected into safer lines of thought. Sam, unfortunately, bore witness to all of them.
: At least we’re both on the same page.
Cas rolled onto his back and turned his head to stare at the back of Dean’s. The blanket sagged at the release of tension, reducing the draft considerably.
Sam brought a few essentials from the Impala’s trunk and stashed them in the truck, too. Spare shotguns loaded with salt rounds, extra salt, and a box of witch killing bullets just in case. He handed Ed an antipossession amulet, but Ed just shook his head.
“Was that okay?” Cas asks, and Dean chokes on a laugh, resting his forehead down on Cas’s unbandaged shoulder before looking back up and kissing him again.
Cas understood completely. It was ironically similar to his own approach to writing. Not that he’d ever share the details of that with Dean, or with any coworker for that matter. He’d found such a liberating joy in writing for himself, for fandom, that he wasn’t sure he could go back to trying to write for a specific market again. He didn’t want to have to factor in market saturation or commercial viability when he sat down to create fictional worlds. And he’d found an eager audience in a thriving and productive fandom. That was more than good enough for him.
Dean grins, apparently delighted by Cas’s impatience. But he proves equally impatient and accedes to Cas’s wishes, letting himself settle down gently atop him, propping himself on his elbow to avoid hurting the tender tattoo, but grinding their hips together. Below him, Cas lets out a low hissing sound that has nothing to do with pain, rocking his hips up to enjoy the slow drag of his cock alongside Dean’s.
“I haven’t been a demon,” Cas replied. “But I was an angel for several billion years, so I can empathize on some level.”
Dean sighed behind him as cool air rushed into the newly created blanket cavern between them. He whispered so as not to wake Jack. “Dude, I don’t think the blanket’s big enough for both of us.”
Dean knew that. He’d seen it. It was even one of those huge old claw-foot jobs. It would take forever to run enough water to fill it up, and they both really needed to get cleaned up if they were gonna share the bed again. At that thought, a hundred new connections zinged through Dean’s head, giving him ideas he wouldn’t have dared to think before they’d kissed. No, before they’d gotten so distracted making out that their cocoa had congealed. He was tentatively hopeful that he was even allowed to think such things now.
: Great, fine. Not sure I want credit as the inspiration for the fic or not, at this rate. But Feathers just messaged me, and I gotta get editing this thing. You wanna see the draft when I’m done with edits?
“I don’t think I understand why that’s upsetting you so much, then.”
Their first kiss is soft, shockingly gentle considering the landslide of feelings they’re barely holding back. Cas slides his fingertips up Dean’s cheek and into his hair, both pulling Dean closer and holding on with everything he has. Dean wraps an arm around his waist and pulls him even closer. The kiss doesn’t stay soft and gentle for long, and Cas slips his other hand under the hem of Dean’s shirt, dragging warm fingers over the skin of Dean’s lower back. Dean sighs into his mouth and pulls back, laying one last sweet kiss on his lips as he leans back to catch his breath. He lets out a quiet huff of a laugh and smiles at Cas as he rests their foreheads together.
Cas glanced at the bin of posters on the coffee table in front of them, giving it a little nod. “You mentioned you were uncomfortable with the idea that your previous housemates didn’t respect your valued possessions, and I want you to know I feel rather honored that you believe I will. You’ve known me less than a week, and already trust me enough to have shared that with me at all. I wouldn’t do anything to break that trust. Least of all bring strangers into our home.”
Cas stopped what he was doing and looked up at Dean, scandalized. “I-- I’ve never… I wouldn’t…”
Cas shook his head, squeezing Dean’s hands. “I definitely don’t want that, Dean. I will always be your friend, but I want this too.”
“I really hope so, Cas,” Dean says.
“Go save your precious car from that unthinkable fate, and bring my backpack when you come back.”
“I guess I’m sorry about the whole cockblock thing I tried to pull at the hospital last night. Cas seems like a really nice guy.”
>>I already got mine on the plate. I’ll be over in two shakes.
wanna drink some of this? You look like something the cat dragged in, and we ain’t got a cat.”
“Well then,” Dean said, clearing his throat and hoping his cheeks weren’t turning pink under the praise from a group of people he’d never even met before, “I hope I can live up to her expectations.”
He frowns at the road ahead of them and grips the wheel tighter. At least he’s not the one buying the car today. It doesn’t matter what the finance jackass at the dealership thinks of him. He’s just there for moral support. It’s Sam that needs to look like a responsible, upstanding citizen to qualify for the car loan.
It was ridiculous to assume that Dean Winchester participated in the Pinefest just because he’d used that phrase. The man had been struggling to compose a two minute speech, after all. How likely was it that he not only was a fan of Unnatural, but that he would devote his free time to writing 20,000 word fanfiction pieces for it? Dean had offered to explain
Dean stared at him for a second. “‘Course it is. Cold baths aren’t exactly romantic, Cas. Kinda the opposite, actually.”
Cas frowned down at him and made a move to slide away, but Dean held him tight and shook his head.
Jody sighs and waves a hand at Dean, as if to say,
“You know where to find me,” Cas said. “That goes for book recommendations as well as any questions you might have about the school in general. I tend to be more available during the first week of school than most of the classroom teachers. Student library visits don’t start until the week after next.”
“Well, then, you’re in luck,” Dean replied with a grin, reaching out to pat Cas on the knee. “We’re living in Miami, and from what I hear, they got lots of boats down here.”
Cas shrugs. “I can’t explain it either. I can’t explain my handprint on your shoulder, or the connection I’ve felt to you since we met. Maybe some things are meant to be.”
“This is someone you knew before you moved here?” Cas asked, assuming it was a friend from Kansas, someone he couldn’t physically check in on now that he was a thousand miles away.
“Can it wait until after I kiss you again?”
Cas sighed and stood up from tying his boots, and headed out to the library. As he expected, Dean was already there, and he and Sam were just waiting for him. Sam gave him a curious look, which he believed may have been mild concern, or at the very least curiosity, while Dean sat awkwardly trying not to look at either of them. Cas understood, Dean hadn’t said anything to Sam, but it was clear to Sam that Dean was uncomfortable about something. Rather than try to explain, or risk accidentally making the situation worse, Cas sat down beside Dean and waited for Sam to begin his presentation.
Cas nodded as he rinsed the last of the shampoo from his hair and then switched places with Dean again to hunt down the soap. “I’m glad you did, for more reasons than just discovering how thin this wall is,” Cas said, giving him a little smirk as he knocked on the wall in question with a sudsy knuckle.
“You have my word, Cas,” Sam said solemnly, which seemed to relieve Cas’s mind a little bit. “I’m just gonna step outside for a minute to give Rowena a call. The sooner we get this fixed, the better.”
“I guess they’re okay, but you love ‘em, so it’s not gonna kill me to live with a couple slimy fake marshmallows once in a while,” Dean shot back. “I should probably just spring for a bag of the real ones and make proper hot chocolate sometime.”
They touched down at the top of the road right outside the bunker’s door. Cas wobbled on his feet, and Jack reached out to help him balance himself.
“The front desk? Are you kidding?”
“Does this mean you trust me to take care of your most prized possessions?”
“Yeah, I’ll make sure he’s not on time,” Dean replies with a leer.
Dean tugs the collar of his shirt down, revealing the star inside a circle of flames on his own chest, surrounded by glimpses of other images spreading across his chest and shoulder. “This one supposedly protects against demons, but me and Sammy both got ‘em years ago.”
Dean nodded in resignation. He wasn’t sure when Charlie would have the time to help them out. She was likely being run just as ragged in residency in LA as he was in Miami. Though the chances Dean’s old hospital was carrying on some sort of long con on her entire department were pretty slim. Nobody wants to fuck with the neurosurgery department they way Grace Memorial was screwing over the trauma center.
Cas shook his head, horrified. “That sounds like a traumatizing experience. But no, I haven’t met my roommate yet. I assumed they’d be moving in after orientation today. For all I know they’re already up there getting settled in.”
“Well, neither am I,” Gabriel sighs and leans his elbows on the table. “I didn’t bring you here to drown your sorrows, Cassie boy. We’re here to do damage control.”
With Cas now standing there, fully human in what was nothing more than a graveyard for Chuck’s failed vanity, Jack turned back to the Entity.
Dean had only known him a few hours, and the thought of losing Cas already hit him like a punch to the chest. He’d been about to get ahead of himself and let himself wonder about Cas’s relationship status, just because he happened to be thinking about him as he stripped off the rest of his clothes. He stumbled as he struggled to pull his jeans off and they tangled around his foot. He cursed his exhaustion and the stupid part of his brain that was already obsessing over someone he knew almost nothing about.
Dean closed his eyes for a moment as Cas’s hand trailed suds down his neck and across his chest. They flew open again when Cas gently brushed a soapy finger over his nipple. His gasp brought Cas’s attention around from his intense focus on getting Dean clean. The moment they locked eyes they crashed right back to where they’d been before they’d hit the roadblock at Dean’s belt. Dean finally took a good long look at Cas, in all his wet, naked, and fully aroused glory. When Dean had drunk him all in, he reached out to Cas, looking right into his eyes, and slowly slid his hand down Cas’s side again. Cas shuddered at the touch and stepped closer. Still holding the soap, he wrapped his arm around Dean’s waist again and pulled him in close. At the first touch of warm, wet skin, the soap slipped out of his hand and landed forgotten on the floor.
“And there aren’t any civilians around to get in the way,” Ed added as Sam and Dean got out of the truck.
Out in the hall, he saw Cas already headed toward the break room. It was Jody who caught up to him first, before he could take off running to catch up with Cas.
Cas frowns, taking a closer look at Sam’s shoulder. “I suppose you should feel lucky there was no traffic, then.”
Crowley shrugged. “The business suits decided to use your own flexibility against you, seeing as it
Charlie scoffed. “You’re gonna fly, okay? And it’s gonna be great. Now go to sleep.”
Deal. But you’re gonna have to tell me about your librarian, now, you realize this.
“Yeah,” Dean replied. “I got that.”
“There are many spells that can’t be broken by true love, but in this case, I definitely agree it’s worth a try.”
Cas took that for the invitation it was. He rested his hands along Dean’s jaw and gently leaned in for a kiss. It started out slow, but within minutes they’d worked back up to the intensity that had driven them to the bath in the first place.
The door to the apartment at the top is already open, so Dean tugs him inside and kicks it shut behind them. He turns to Cas and suddenly looks uncertain. “We can really just watch the movie if you want to. Sit on the couch, maybe make out a little.”
Dean looks over at Cas with an I-told-you-so raised eyebrow, and Cas replies with a look of fond exasperation before mopping up the last of the syrup on his plate with his remaining pancake and shoving it in his mouth. Dean collects his plate and sets it in the sink with his own, giving Sam a few more minutes to enjoy his little existential crisis out on the stairs before putting him out of his misery.
“You do know how fucked up that was, right? You couldn’t have just dug me out?”
Cas nodded slowly while processing all of that. “And would you say that this was your happy place?” His brow pinched as he recalled what Dean had said earlier.
Dean frowns at him, his brow pinching together. “Huh, yeah, right. I guess you would’ve. But you don’t wanna be too aggressive with the ointment. Don’t want the ink to come oozing back out, you know?”
Ed looked disturbed by this revelation, so Dean sat up, absently reaching over to pat Cas on the knee as he did.
Jerry in Pennsylvania with the low-res demon? You’re really digging into the past now.
about it. Isn’t that incredible?”
There’s a single box sitting on the bed, the only one marked in Gabriel’s distinctive handwriting, that’s labeled
Just as Mildred had told him their school was like a family, he’d felt exactly the same way about his old school back in Lawrence. He’d only worked there a few years before Sam called him up with the news that he’d landed a job clear across the country. Dean had considered relocating to California once or twice while his brother had been in college. After Sam had decided to stay out there for law school, it had become a serious consideration, but Sam had never been sure where he wanted to settle down when he graduated. If Dean was gonna pick up his whole life and start over somewhere new, he didn’t want to have to do it twice. He could wait for Sam to figure out his own life first.
: As a matter of fact, it did. I’d thought the final chapter would be… bigger, I guess. But I think this will work as an ending.
“Well, you’re stuck with me for the next four years, and I cook a lot, so you’re welcome I guess.”
“You didn’t fuck up your hellhound, did you, Sammy?” Dean says, getting to his feet to move in for a closer look.
“Difficult for
“You were thrown off?” Cas asked, a confused crinkle forming between his eyebrows. “About coffee?”
He struggled to push his own shoes off, but didn’t worry this time when he stumbled. Cas finally let them both fall onto the bed, still fully dressed.
“Ooh, ouch,” Dean said, wincing. That was one way to snap himself out of his own self-inflicted daydreams. Tired as he was, it was getting harder to keep acting like a normal human, but an absent and controlling father was definitely something he could relate to. He patted the back of Cas’s shoulder in solidarity. “I know how that is. If my dad hadn’t taken off when he did, I don’t know that I wouldn’t still be working for him, wedged under his thumb. Sorry.”
After a quick shower spent visualizing the angel’s perfect form, silhouetted against a yellow moon in an inky sky filled with undiscovered constellations, he is honestly looking forward to the end of the day when he can commit the image to paper. At least he’s got the rest of the day to think over the little details. He makes a short detour to the kitchen for a bowl of cereal and the rest of the coffee, and then collects his notebook and heads downstairs to the shop. At least down there he’s less likely to get stuck on the clouds in his own imagination. From the moment he unlocks the door for Jody and Donna, he’s all business.
Cas gave a little shrug. “If you had, I likely wouldn’t have been dreaming about you. Your letters made me… they made me care about you, Dean, and it grew from there.”
Dean explained that his only family left in Kansas weren’t actual blood family, but the close friends who’d raised and supported him and his brother after their mother died and their father effectively abandoned them. He’d soothed Cas’s shocked reaction to that with a smile and a shrug.
bathroom now. Cas had relieved him of the burden of inventing excuses last night, so Dean extended him the same courtesy now. He shrugged.
“What the hell is going on?” She asked him quietly as they both picked up their pace. “I was in the middle of treating a diabetic shock patient when I was relieved by Dr. Fey. She told me to get my butt over here. I guess you got a similar request?”
Dean pulled the phone away from his ear and double checked the number calling him, and yes, it was technically the extension in the Emergency Room’s staff break room, and not even Dr. Crowley’s cell. He breathed a small sigh of relief that he probably wasn’t being called in to work, before wondering why the fuck Crowley was calling him from the break room on what amounted to his first day off in a week. It seemed prudent to figure that out soonest.
“Yeah, I get it. Surrounded by kids all day, you gotta keep something in your life that reminds you you’re a grownup.”
“For lack of a better plan…” Sam said, finishing the potion and setting down the spoon, staring around the room as if hoping something better would leap off one of the shelves.
The afternoon shift began with the head of the department checking up on all of them. Dr. Crowley was nowhere near as warm and welcoming as Dr. Jones and Dr. Fey, following each of them in turn as they worked their way through the waiting room full of patients. He mostly stood off to the side, making judgmental faces and once even a disappointed sigh when Dean correctly made it through an entire diagnosis and got his patient successfully admitted for observation, as if he’d been hoping that Dean would fail so he could swoop in and handle the case himself.
“You know we’re aware that residents are expected to adapt to any scheduling assignment,” Jody said. “We’re here at the whim of the hospital. So why the big to do about it?”
If someone had used that line on Dean, he’d have a dozen snappy-- if entirely inappropriate-- comebacks at the ready. He wisely chooses to employ none of them in this situation. This poor woman has already been traumatized enough for one day.
“Demons could’ve done that?” Ed finally asked.
He took his time, giving Cas absolutely everything he had to offer, and learning exactly how to wring every drop of pleasure from him. Cas shook and moaned above him, eventually tugging at Dean’s hair to get his attention.
The morning went surprisingly smoothly, all things considered. He figured there were still parents holding back from contacting him until after meeting him at orientation, and his inbox would be flooded again on Friday afternoon, but for now he was grateful for the chance to better acquaint himself with all the nitty-gritty details of his job. Paperwork might be boring, but it was still important to know his way around the Edlund School’s filing system and chain of command.
“Did you forget how to send a text?” Dean asked, pulling out his phone and sending Cas an eye-rolling emoji.
Cas glanced up at Dean, still standing over his shoulder, still staring intently at the computer screen, and clicked the next article down on results page just to look like he was actually accomplishing something. He wasn’t even really focusing on the words on the screen, thinking more about how to make Dean feel better than finding an excuse to get them both out of the bunker. But while Cas was busy worrying about Dean, Dean had been reading.
Five minutes before his alarm was set to go off, Dean woke up and silenced it. There was no point in being lazy in bed long enough for it to potentially wake Cas up, too. With a groan he got dressed and headed to the kitchen to make coffee. If he was going to have to brave the Saturday morning grocery crowd, he’d need fortification.
When Cas had taken his final plunge into humanity, Dean had been worried at first. Unlike the last time he’d been human, though, Cas took to it well, probably because Dean hadn’t kicked him out this time. He’d eagerly made the adjustment, letting Dean give him every lesson on How To Human, answering all his questions and even commiserating with him over some of the less enjoyable aspects of humanity. It had actually been nice, being able to take care of Cas through his first bout with a cold, exploring the variety of foods he’d never had a chance to appreciate before, and generally helping Cas settle in to his new life. It had all been going well, maybe
As comfortable as Cas had been in the library when it had just been the two of them, seeing him surrounded by kids who almost universally seemed happy to see him again and share what they’d been reading over the summer, Dean had no trouble understanding why Cas would’ve abandoned a writing career for this job. He was so genuinely pleased by each of his students and their obvious joy in what they’d read. And to them, Cas was an adult who fostered that joy in them. It really was a gift to have that sort of power to inspire young imagination so directly. Sure, publishing the books that potentially millions of children would find inspirational was great, but actively being part of their lives and directly instilling that love of reading was something else. Being able to see the results of his work reflected back to him in their excitement and happiness every day was pretty damn rewarding, even if they weren’t reading stories he’d written himself. It was just a different kind of rewarding.
Cas finally set the box down on their coffee table while Dean pulled out his pocket knife to open it. Inside was a printed copy of Crowley’s emailed order, listing what Dean confirmed were the contents of the box as Cas pulled each bottle out and set them on the table in a little line. Below the order information was a more personal note that Dean read out while Cas admired their sudden and rather extravagant collection of whiskey.
Cas shrugged. “It’s immaterial at this point. But I need to confess that when my control inevitably fails, there are things that you may see that are potentially… compromising.”
Cas nods, touching his fingertips all around the edges of his tattoo like he can’t really believe it’s there. “I do, yes. Very much.”
“Unless you’re planning on leaving right now, at least let me rinse it off for you.”
Sam makes a grumbling noise as he riffles through stacks of papers scattered across the tabletop until he finds his phone. “Yeah, I’m texting her now.”
Cas studied him while he finished brushing his teeth, eventually dropping his toothbrush into the cup on Dean’s counter. “We could set up your stereo in there. You mentioned your uncle was shipping your record collection. It could be a music room.”
So no hints on if he even swings in your direction?
Some of the people she’d met had gone on to become hunters themselves, like Michelle Tilghman who’d saved Dean’s life and watched her husband turn into a monster. If she could spare anyone else having to suffer through what she’d lost that day, Michelle considered it a job well done. Others still had devoted their spare time to keeping tabs on the Winchesters, and on the supernatural community in general. Such as Jamie, a bartender from Pennsylvania who had a remarkable encounter with a shapeshifter with a movie monster obsession, and Tina, a teenage girl who’d been in her 30’s before she ran into the Winchesters and a witch. Jamie left her old life behind and opened a sort of halfway house for people who’d had their entire lives uprooted by the supernatural-- both humans and unfortunate monsters who were doing their best to live their lives in peace. Tina had found Jamie shortly after beginning her own life over again. There were now all kinds of people in their ever-expanding support network.
Cas gave a knowing nod as he took a big bite and chewed with deeply contented relish.
Sam glares up at Dean. “You remember her major, and not her name?”
“You made it loud, and then you disappeared before I could punish you for that,” the Entity said, its face morphing to resemble Jack’s as it turned toward him at last. “Don’t worry, though, this one is more than happy to take your punishment for you.”
On the drive to the restaurant, he kept checking his rear view mirror to make sure Dean was still following. It made it difficult to think clearly, but he was certain he was making the right choice in spending more time with Dean, even outside of school. He repeatedly had to remind himself that having a real friend as opposed to anonymous internet friends was a good idea that he should’ve acted on sooner. It was still hard, erecting this tentative bridge between his work life and his social life. The chasm seemed unsettlingly broader than he’d remembered it being. For Dean, though, a major bridge construction project might just be worth the effort.
“I appreciate the fact you think you’re appeasing me, but I must remind you that Caesar salad drenched in parmesan cheese isn’t exactly health food,” Cas said as Dean selected his first slice of pizza. “Besides, I honestly don’t have some weird health food kink. I just thought it might be nice to have something else to eat that would compliment the pizza. You’re not required to eat it, and I won’t think less of you if you don’t. I promise.”
Dean took the opportunity to press himself against Cas, to let him feel just how aroused he was. Years of frustrated longing surged to the surface, and Dean frantically tried to convey all of it to Cas through touch, through the movement of their lips together and through his hands trying to hold every bit of Cas at once. Cas ground his hips against Dean’s, proving that the arousal was entirely mutual.
They’d never really seen Ed at his hunting best, but had to trust and assume that if he hadn’t gotten himself killed in the last six or seven years, then he probably wasn’t going to be a liability. Dean figured at the very least he was qualified to set up the tech stuff without putting all their lives in imminent danger. For the rest, he’d reserve judgment until after they all made it home safe again.
Dean gathered all the ingredients and set them down in front of Sam. With Cas’s assistance, they were confident that the spell had worked. The only thing they needed now was to figure out how to carry out the final step.
Dean shrugged and took another gulp of his beer. Sam let out a long, low laugh. Cas looked right at Ed and said, “There are things in creation far worse than demons.”
Jack did as he was bid and set about explaining the entire last year that she’d missed out on. He explained how Chuck had been manipulating all of their lives, inflicting every last horrific choice on them to try to force them to enact the tragic story he wanted them all to relive again and again for his own pleasure. The horror of it all hit Mary when Jack described his own death and the process of transformation he’d had to endure to regain his own soul and make himself into a perfect weapon to destroy Chuck. By the time he reached the end of his story, Mary had tears staining her cheeks but a relieved smile on her face. She reached out and rested a hand on his shoulder.
Cas nodded. They made love for hours all while whispering secrets of love and desire to one another.
Dean smiled as Cas tried to keep his balance. Before they got onto the bed Dean slid his hands under Cas's coats and slowly removed them, leaving the angel in just his white button up.
“It was pretty amazing right?” Dean said, smirking.
“I just told you I was an angel and you couldn’t hurt me,” Cas said smiling.
Deanna sets her jaw. “Just – don’t. I need someone to…to remind me. You know. Other than the brat back there.”
“De,” Sammy breathes out.
“Doesn’t seem like you want me back!” Deanna snarls in return.
Sammy blinks, head quirking towards her.
Gabriel does not smile, does not laugh. “There’s other ways,” she says, and her voice is tinged with – desperation, Michael-Deanna notes with satisfaction.
Sammy says, taking a deep breath.
“Your body is dying,” he replies indignantly.
Deanna shakes her head. She wonders if she should pull over. “What?”
“If she’s working with Crowley,” Sammy says. “What does
and the Campbell weird-fucks.”
, Deanna says, because she doesn’t. It’s a lie. She doesn’t know it’s a lie. She shifts her gaze back to her fingernails, free of black, and full-body flinches, hearing screams. The handprint on her shoulder throbs, and she wonders if she tears off her shirt, will the tattoo of wings on her back still be the same? Does she deserve it, anymore, or will it break through her skin? Is she alive, is she alive –
The grace-high surges through Deanna, and the reminder of it in conjunction with Sammy’s pained groan is enough to make her think of the panic room and want to puke. Meanwhile, Ada just looks mildly itchy.
Sammy’s silent.
“Can’t even go a few hours without fighting?” Ada asks, slipping through the mudroom door.
Deanna suddenly finds she couldn’t speak even if she wanted to. She glares instead.
“Yes, I heard what you said,” she yelps. “Jesus, I’m not into that!”
“Great,” Deanna says.
, at least not as much as Sammy is, so it’s a little strange even beyond the whole demon-in-the-room. Ruby eats her burger fast, same as Deanna, instead of talking. Sammy’s got a salad and a complaint about their latest dead end of Lilith-research, but Ruby interrupts her to say, “Fries.”
There was always too much between them, her family. A lifetime of hardness, even after Sammy ran away to California. The kind of calluses that only pain wrought by those you loved could create.)
“Why not?” Her face is pleading. “Give me a reason, De.”
, Deanna thinks. Just an angry bald man. An angry and ugly bald man. God, Deanna can’t believe they’re related.
? Lucifer asks, and spreads their arms to the sky. Thunder crashes, and rain spatters the ground.
“What were you doing up?” Deanna asks.
She will not say please.)
, John whispered before he died.
, future-Deanna says. And that’s that.
“I’m really starting to hate that,” Ada says.
Cas tilts her head, staring intently. “No matter what choices you make,” she says, quiet and intense. “You still bear my mark, Deanna. Though what you did was horrible and regrettable, you are mine, not his.”
"Your kid?" The woman raised her eyebrow and turned to Jack again. "Are these men your parents?"
"Need anything?" I asked when Dean pulled out the first aid kit, sanitising all the tools.
Sam finished his witch off and came over to try and help us out. I spotted Cas' face drop and a flash of an angel blade then the witch ran, I heard the gun shot but I was running to Cas. His shirt was quickly turning red and he was lay on the dirty floor. "Cas!" I yelled, please let that just be a cut and not a stab. I quickly knelt down, pulling him so his shoulders and head were resting on my knees as I tried to get to the wound.
"I don't see why you're flinching, it can't even hurt you." Dean chuckled.
Dean hadn't been mothering Cas for a few hours and Cas hadn't picked a fight with Dean for at least twelve hours. It all seemed fine. Almost back to normal. If they just admitted their feelings for each other it would be so much easier, Dean would have an excuse to give Cas on why he was being so overbearing and it would be easier for everyone all round. I felt like locking them in a room most of the time.
I rolled my eyes. "Ruining business." I muttered.
"I don't know. He just keeps looking at us weird I guess. I could be over thinking it." I shrugged, and stroked Cas' hair before leaning in for another kiss. God I missed him when he would go away. He'd already been back for two days but it barely felt like five minutes.
"Is the castle real and can we go and see it one day?"
"What's wrong?" Dean asked.
"But-what about all the strippers, waitresses?" Sam stumbled over his words, his eyebrows mushed together.
Ignorant idiots don't know they're in love.
I kept seeing Sam looking back at us through the mirror, that annoyed and weird look on his face. It was starting to piss me off. If he had a problem he just needed to say it. He'd never said anything before. I focused on getting Cas into the motel and lay down without waking him up.
Sam is a moron.
Cas sighed and turned back to the stove. "I'll just burn it on purpose if you carry on."
“We’ll give ‘em the heads up tomorrow morning, and we’ll keep really close tabs on them, but hopefully we can keep our bigger plans under wraps. They won’t be in any more danger than they’ve been all along.”
Dean gave him a conspiratorial little nod, and then grinned. “Who am I to stand in the way of tradition?”
“But I
It was Cas’s turn to blink in surprise. He couldn’t believe that Dean remembered the first conversation they’d ever had. He nodded slowly, and Dean grinned at him, finally having forgotten his earlier worry. If nothing else, Cas had at least succeeded in that one mission. He’d made Dean smile. But now that they’d established that they were both in the Unnatural fandom, at least by association with Charlie, Cas couldn’t hold back his curiosity any longer.
Cas shrugged. “Stranger things have happened.”
One who hopefully has more of a social life than I do. At least with claims happening tomorrow.
“It’s been more than 20 minutes, I think,” Dean said softly when he was right behind Cas, one hand up and hovering a few inches above the angriest looking abrasion  along Cas’s shoulderblade.
“At least give me ten minutes to go unconscious before you two do anything…” he waved his hand around and grimaced at Dean.
He got up and stretched, staring down the bureau across the room and wondering if he even owned enough clothes to fill it. In his half asleep state, he sorted out the rest of the essentials from his duffel and linen tub, and then stashed both of the containers in the modestly large walk in closet. Dean debated whether he should change out of the clothes he’d slept in before wandering out of his room, but decided he wouldn’t set any precedents he wasn’t prepared to live with for the next four years and shuffled to the door as is.
Dean grinned at that and sat up. “Yeah, I don’t really wanna shoot you, either.”
“You go get yourself taken care of, and give me a call when you’re feeling better. I’ll take you out for coffee to thank you for not pressing me to death like a common witch.”
“If it’ll make you feel better, we can change your number, too, but we’re leaving it as is for now in case Nick tries to contact you again.”
“Maybe next weekend we should get coffee before we pick out perishables,” Cas suggested. He nearly regretted it for a moment until he turned around to see the hopeful look on Dean’s face. It disappeared the moment he’d seen it, but Cas was certain it had been there. There was a stiffness in his shoulders, too, and it may have been mere concern for his cart escaping his grasp in the parking lot, but he seemed to be holding on to it for dear life. Dean composed himself quickly, though, and turned it back around on him.
Dean looked over at Sam like he’d just confessed that he only went jogging so he could have an excuse hide in the woods and secretly binge on Twinkies. “Dude, she said the first case was a guy who’d been camping out at the lake. Stands to reason the source is somewhere in or around the lake.”
“Thank you for this, Dean.”
“I was gonna change and then heat up the rest of last night’s dinner. You want me to fix you a plate?”
Their first morning on shift, Dean was too worked up to make a decent breakfast. Cas seemed to be of a similar mindset, joining him in the kitchen not long after he figured out how to work Cas’s convoluted coffee maker and set a full pot brewing. Dean had been engaged in a debate over whether or not it would be weird to just start opening cupboards to see if Cas had bought any cereal, or granola bars, or anything he could consume for sustenance without having to think too hard. Seeing Cas emerge, also fully dressed for the hospital right down to the white coat with his badge clipped to the pocket, and also apparently as restless and nervous as he felt, helped Dean ground himself. After recovering from the surprise of discovering Dean having beaten him to the coffee maker, it seemed to have a similar effect on Cas.
Dean laughed at that and shook his head, turning the computer back to himself to try a few more things before giving up on the search for Lydia.
called you a dumbass to your face. That doesn’t seem like the kind of behavior of the type of person to file formal complaints.”
“So, you’re a tattoo artist?”
Cas snorts and takes another drink.
Sam shifts in his seat but doesn’t look up at Dean. “I, uh, don’t know if I should even be talking about it with you.”
As they all strained to hear whatever was being said on the radio, Cas referred back to Wulf’s letter.
Cas smiled at that, looking as relieved as Dean felt that they were finally on the same page. They finished quickly, and then Cas gave Dean his address just in case they got separated on the short drive. Dean drove the entire way with a growing anticipation for what was to come. It wasn’t some random hookup like the people at the bar had offered him. It wasn’t settling for someone who only cared about half of him. This was Cas, and Feathers, and years of want that he was finally allowed to sate.
Dean frowned, remembering he’d left his phone on the charger back in his room. He deflated like a balloon. All the cheer flowed out of him in an instant.
“You haven’t met your roommate yet, have you?” Dean asked as casually as he could manage to fill the slightly awkward silence while he shuffled through his disorganized paperwork. “Had a chance to scope them out a bit?”
It had been the same wary introduction that Dana had eventually extended to Marie when they met in the same chat room a few years later. It was almost like a secret handshake for the initiated, or in this case the secret knock that opened the door to the fandom beyond the fandom.
, in the bath first, we’ll never get clean.”
Dean waited, but when Cas didn’t immediately provide the answer as Dean had clearly expected him to, Dean sighed again and pinched the bridge of his nose and muttered under his breath. “And now we’re back to square one, I guess.”
Dean perked up at that. “So what brought you to the area?”
“I was still there,” Cas replied. “You only arrived after the cake exploded.”
“It would be highly inconvenient if we both needed to do laundry at the same time,” Cas had argued.
“You don’t think some bored psycho could’ve found a bunch of abandoned cabins in the woods and turned it into his own personal murder playground?” Dean asked.
“You got a backup now.”
“We can do gentle,” Cas replies, sliding his hand up under Dean’s shirt and dragging his fingers up his side. “As long as we can do it naked. You have the advantage, since you’ve already seen me without my shirt on.”
Dean stepped into the shower recalling the piercing blue of Cas’s gaze on him in that first moment he’d turned and wondered if he’d nodded off during that presentation and was dreaming the gorgeous man sitting next to him. He was about to turn on the water when he heard a distinct tapping sound from the other side of the wall, and then water running. It sounded like Cas was brushing his teeth, which was confirmed when Dean heard him gargling a minute or two later. He’d nearly laughed, until it registered that any noise he made in his own marble echo chamber of a bathroom would carry directly into Cas’s room on the other side of the apparently paper thin wall. That moderately embarrassing realization put an immediate damper on letting his exhausted mind-- not to mention his hands-- wander.
“So option three?” Dean asked.
“Look at our lives, Dean,” Sam replied. “Just walking through our front door is technically paranormal shit. We live in paranormal shit central, and we’ve got work to do. But it can wait until after breakfast, at least.”
Dean made an undignified noise that passed as a laugh. “Yeah, but would you have believed us, or thought we were just trying to scare you off to horn in on your big story, or whatever?”
“Dean. Dean, wait. Wait.”
“Dean,” Cas said, stopping him at long last. “after reading all of my letters, do you really think I’d be here with you right now, after reading all of
Dean had to clear his throat before he could respond. “Uh, yeah, sometimes I don’t.” Dean tried desperately to think back over the last ten minutes of his life. He wasn’t even sure what he’d heard, but surely he would’ve heard Cas prompting him with a song. Unless maybe he really had been just that out of it. It could happen, but Dean decided to go with his gut and guess anyway. “You didn’t sing either.”
printed across every license plate in the state, and only through Sam’s relentless calling and polite begging did they find someone willing to rent them a small cabin for the week. Dean had argued that it would’ve been easier to just find a remote cabin to squat in for however long it took them to find the bad thing and gank it. Sam had countered that it might not be camping season, but it was still deer hunting season, and it was probably a good idea not to be found uninvited at someone’s hunting cabin either.
Jack was surprised by Mary’s easy offer, and within him Amara snorted. Of course Mary didn’t harbor a grudge, or blame him for what happened. Of course she forgave him, and still thought of him as her own. Amara had come to understand this as a cornerstone of motherhood, at least as exemplified by Mary and Kelly. When it came to answering her, Jack hedged.
. And as easy as that, they’d casually worked out the details of their lives like a couple of people who’d been living together for years. Both of them just ran with the assumption that they’d just do everything together, and neither of them seemed in the least uncomfortable with it. After they ate and cleaned up, by mutual silent agreement they migrated out to the living room, where Cas pulled out a notebook and did his best to work out a schedule they could both live with.
He stares at the phone in his hand and feels like the entire day has taken a turn for the worse. There’s no point to attempting to read for pleasure now. There’s no way he can avoid thinking about Nick, or the patient he all but murdered in front of Cas and Gabriel both, and now might be trying to pin on him. He debates even sending the messages to Billie for one crazed moment before deciding that Pamela should be the one to do that, submitting them officially as part of their records.
“My college roommate was spectacularly inebriated one night, and confused the directions for cooking a bag of frozen tater tots with microwave popcorn. He kept pushing the button, restarting the microwave, not understanding why it wasn’t popping. By the time the smell of burning potatoes reached my room, they’d been reduced to a mushy, grainy pulp.”
“Dammit, Sammy, just hold your fucking horses,” Dean barks at him as he dashes around the car. “Your gimp ass can damn well wait two more goddamn seconds. It’s probably gonna be an hour or two before they see you, anyway. That's what you get hurting yourself at rush hour.”
“Oh, right,” Sam says, looking around like he’d forgotten what they were there for. “And yeah, I think I’m gonna test drive the Honda, actually.”
With that unsettling bit of advice, the meeting comes to an unofficial end. Billie offers to review the surgical notes and critique Cas on his presentation for the Morbidity and Mortality panel. Sam volunteers to stay and take notes on that, as well, as much for his own edification as for their official records. By the time Sam and Billie finally leave, Cas slumps down into the plush sofa cushions, emotionally and physically drained. He perks up a bit when Gabriel waves a plate of reheated leftovers from their lunch under his nose and the two of them share a companionable silence while they eat.
Dean was about to ask what sort of obligations he meant when they rounded a corner and were overwhelmed by the smell of fresh pastry and coffee, and confronted with a small crowd of people waiting for an elevator. He made a note to ask Cas about his family later, when he had more brain power and more privacy, and treated his new friend to a revitalizing jolt of caffeine.
Cas finally extricated himself from Daphne’s clutches, frowning at Dean as he passed by in Crowley’s wake, stopping only long enough to mutter to Dean, “That sounds ominous.”
Gabriel nods, gulps the last of his drink and tosses the cup in the trash. He lays a hand on Cas’s shoulder and pushes him toward the door. “What do you say we discuss this over a drink or twelve? My treat.”
Lorna snorted. “Yeah, sure. A demonologist with a few good conjuring tricks up his sleeve is what, communing with the dead? Save it for the show, Wulf. You’re not fooling anyone.”
“I got you a rabbit food pizza with all the vegetables on it, but we had a lot of shopping to do. Ran out of time for actual cooking,” Dean said, before taking another bite of his meat-laden monstrosity.
Cas rolled his eyes again as he turned on his heel and headed back to the living room. “I swore I would inform you about the Lincoln’s arrival the second I had the information, Dean, and I stand by that.” He turned in the doorway and narrowed his eyes at Dean. “As long as you still swear not to mock my car.”
Dean laughed and rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah, it’s been a while since I’ve been out for karaoke. Maybe next time I’ll see how well my speech goes over with that crowd.”
The friends he’d made in California were great, but they were all in the same boat he was. They’d all met and been thrown together on the same journey into life, but each of them had known from the beginning that all their roads would eventually head out in different directions. While they’d shared the same stretch of highway they’d been able to find comfort and support in one another, but when it was time to go their separate ways, Dean didn’t feel it like a traumatic loss. He’d stay in touch with some of them-- the core of his friend group like Benny and Charlie and Aaron-- but he couldn’t imagine what it must’ve felt like for Cas being cut adrift completely with no tether to anything he could think of as home.
Cas nodded, resuming his careful soaping of Dean’s arms while Dean simultaneously tried to scrub at his back, working his fingers into the muscles in a gentle massage, the way he had with Cas's shampoo.
Cas nodded thoughtfully as he carefully set his own shoes down in their appointed spot on the rack. “If that’s the case, then I don’t know that we’ll ever be able to get to the bottom of this. If the attending physicians were unable to get the board to see reason, I don’t know what hope a handful of displaced residents have.”
“We should probably find someplace less dangerous if we’re gonna keep going…”
What a fucked up day. It had been going so well. He should’ve been coming home from dinner with Jody and Donna and settling in to obsess over his drawings from this morning. He’d been close to a breakthrough on that angel, or at least it feels that way now. But the vision he’d felt so tangibly that morning in the shower feels like a distant memory that he can’t quite grab on to again as he squeezes his eyes closed and rubs the bridge of his nose. He walks himself through a recap of his entire day trying to recapture that lost glimpse of his angel.
Sam shrugged. “They offered to clean and repaint mailboxes all over town. No charges were filed.”
“I’m unsure if I’m still able to see the true faces of the fae,” Cas replied. “I can still see angels, and if I know to look for it, I can spot demons. I haven’t had the occasion to observe the fae since I fell. They’re typically highly secretive and avoid the mortal plane.”
“Your room is closer,” Cas replied.
Dean grunted. “Yeah, apparently you were one of the first picked. Congrats. I talked to WitchySis to ask if she’d seen you around.”
Benny nods, and then shakes his head. “There was a lot that wasn’t adding up if the pattern Gabriel hit on was just about a power trip at work, playing god with people’s lives. His notes only covered half the story, the stuff he saw go down at the hospital. Turns out Nick had a whole other life outside the hospital, and a lot of the incidents in Gabriel’s notes connected those dots for us, nice and tidy.”
“I’ll have a pic-a-nic basket ready just in case,” Dean said with a grin.
Sam shook her hand and pulled out his badge. “We’re with the CDC, here to follow up about the water testing you ordered a few weeks ago.”
Cas nods along, and Dean catches him smiling with a faraway look in his eyes. The two of them met under some mildly irritating circumstances, and Cas showed up at the shop today under some shady circumstances as well, and Dean is sure the result has been more than worth it on both counts already. When he turns back to Celia, she gives him a knowing smile which he pointedly ignores and gets back to work.
“Good night, Dean, and thank you again.”
Dean gave him a proper kiss, with a promise of more for later. “Then let’s get this show on the road.”
Dean watched him for a moment while he bit into his pizza and realized Cas was telling the truth. “Yeah, I think I might have some weird baggage I picked up from my little brother. Kid was always on some health food kick or other, and it only got worse when I started med school.” Dean mimicked a whiny voice. “
Cas snorted out a laugh and shook his head as he turned and headed toward the elevator at the far side of the lobby. “Only on Thursdays.”
“You need to hold it close to your face, relax your eyes, and slowly move it away until the image resolves,” a deep and rumbling, and highly amused voice said almost directly behind him.
“Was your classmate a criminal mastermind?” Jody asked, leaning over Donna’s shoulder to see Dean’s handiwork.
Dana Wallace was the single mother of a young boy. Her husband had died mysteriously and terribly more than a decade earlier. She’d moved to St. Louis to be closer to her family, and to take a teaching job near the university. For several years she’d believed her husband’s death had been a horrific accident, until one of her colleagues turned her on to the Supernatural books. She’d devoured the series as a bit of escapist fiction over one summer break, and the entire world titled on its axis when she’d started the novel titled
“I’m sure we could spend the rest of the weekend analyzing my sexuality, but would it be possible to settle on dinner and get cleaned up first? I don’t think I can handle that discussion on an empty stomach while smelling like betadine.”
Dean opened and closed his mouth a couple times, running this development around in his mind before finally blurting out, “What, you gonna throw me in the shower and scrub me clean?”
“I’d ask if you wanted to grab coffee, but I got ice cream in here,” he said, pointing at his cart. “Rain check?”
Cas nodded in agreement, and brought the nearly empty bottle with them, as well. He followed Dean back to the Dean Cave, where Netflix was waiting for them to decide whether or not to play the next episode. Dean hit play but turned the volume down so it was more background noise than anything they were paying attention to.
Dean stood there, leaning one hand on the counter as he guzzled his coffee. He’d need all his brain cells awake for this. Donuts wouldn’t hurt, either. And that’s when he remembered Charlie lived walking distance to his apartment, and to the best bakery in town.
“That’s the one,” Dean replied, grumpily shoving another fry in his mouth as he spotted the guard in question across the cafeteria, eating a ridiculously oversized slice of coconut cream cake.
“Heh, good,” Dean says. “Because unless you plan on wearing your ratty jeans and a t-shirt to your thing tomorrow, I think you’re gonna be stuck wearing my clothes.”
“We’ll get a day off eventually,” Jody replied.
Dean just nodded and picked up the book Sam had abandoned when he’d stormed out. Twenty minutes later, Sam came back and joined them without a word. Twenty minutes after that, Cas sat bolt upright in his chair and set the book he’d been going through down in front of Sam.
“How about GBBO, then? Watch a bunch of people make cake for an hour or two.”
“What the fuck was that?
“We were just getting ready to bring this over to your place,” Jody said, holding up a big platter covered with foil in one hand, and a huge slice of strawberry cheesecake in the other. “But since you’re here…”
“The place just won’t feel like home without Donna giving a running commentary on every show we watch, and reminding me to eat dessert once in a while,” Jody said. “It seems like a stupid thing to complain about the apartment being too quiet after a busy shift at the hospital, but it’s gonna be too quiet.”
“What’s the plan for tonight? Cooking or researching our little mystery?”
“Ooh, looks like Cas picked out something different for you,” she said, peering around Dean’s shoulder at the slices of chimichurri steak as he moved them around the pan.
. Dean had been there. He knew. It kinda tarnished the illusion just a bit.
Cas can’t help but grin at this, but it also draws his attention to the empty closet. His face falls at the sight. “I appreciate everything you’re doing for me, but what about the rest of my things?”
Dean groans as if he’s been physically wounded by the reminder, but gives Cas one last kiss before pulling out his phone and answering it.
“Well, you two stay put for now,” Pamela says. “I got some work to do. I’m gonna have someone drive past your house to make sure Nick’s not there staking the place out, and I need to call Billie and update her on the threats he made against you. Do I have your permission to access your voicemail and texts, and hand them over as evidence?”
“I don’t think he’s gonna be coming back here any time soon, anyway,” Dean said, gesturing around at the empty cabin, now complete with two shattered doors. “We need to start hiking back before he skips town altogether.” He cast a glance at Sam and added, “And see how far Sam’s psychic radio range extends. If he’s gonna be picking up all our stray thoughts, I’d like to know if there’s a limit.”
Cas poured the milk into both mugs and rinsed out the pan. He stirred the chocolate and wondered if they had any of those small marshmallows. Somewhere deep down, he knew they didn’t, but when he opened the cupboard to put the box of cocoa back, there they were on the shelf. He only hesitated for a moment before reaching for the bag and dropping a handful of marshmallows into each of their mugs. Something was definitely not right.
“It’s cold,” he says, stepping out of the spray the moment he’s let it wet his skin, leaving Dean to shuffle around under the cool water.
Dean laughed at that and clapped Cas on the shoulder. “Dude, maybe after I’ve had a chance to sleep for a couple hours. At this rate you’d end up dragging me semi-conscious through the halls, and that’s probably against hospital policy.”
“What, you don’t enjoy the company of everyone you work with here?”
Dean laughed, but it was more of a pained sound than anything happy. “So for at least one of us, no news is good news.”
“And alligators,” Cas added, returning the bottle to its place on the table. “We should stop at the berry farm on the way and stock up on the good bread. I’ve missed the good bread.”
Cas looked up just in time to catch Dean’s frown before he worked his face back into something more neutral. Dean set his mug down, too, and crawled out of the blanket cocoon Cas had wrapped him in. A moment later, Dean was on his knees beside Cas, sifting through the rest of the gifts. Cas watched in confusion as Dean pointed out that half the gifts were from each of them, to the other. Kneeling there on the floor, shoulder to shoulder, holding gifts that neither of them could remember buying, they slowly turned to look at one another.
Dean grinned at Cas as they took their seats near the front of the tram. “You get lost in a corn maze as a kid or something?”
“Yeah, and I ain’t volunteering for that job again,” Dean added.
“Yeah, well, Sam’ll be studying, but he’s used to doing that above a tattoo parlor. Noise ain’t an issue. But you won’t be watching tv, either.”
“I thought you planned to put the food in the cooler?” Cas asked.
Dean shrugs, knowing the eventual questions will come and for once feeling like giving an honest answer. Cas already knows most of his history anyway, but this functions as an effective visual aid. Show and tell, Dean Winchester style, it is.
Cas scrunches up his nose at that. “Yeah, that’s true.”
Donna shrugged. “No idea yet, but we’re gonna find out. It’s the only way we’re gonna get our lives back.” She looked eagerly at Dean and Cas. “And neither of you have any idea what it could be about?”
Dean’s day starts off with a bang. Or rather, with a screech, when Sam somehow manages to set off the smoke detector while toasting up some of his weird healthy birdseed bread. Dean bolts out of bed and out into the kitchen to find Sam trying to smother the toaster with an oven mitt while fanning a cloud of acrid smoke out the window. He skids to a halt in the doorway, his robe hanging open because his hands are too occupied trying to keep the piercing scream of the smoke detector above his head from blowing out his eardrums. He risks his hearing to reach up and push the reset button to silence the alarm. That, at least, finally gets Sam’s attention in the form of a disgruntled but relieved sigh.
“We can always try again later. I’m looking forward to taking my time studying every inch of you, but this is verging on an emergency right now,” Cas replied, once again hooking his foot around Dean’s thigh and pulling him down into a full-body kiss.
One of the contestants on a baking challenge show had made something layered with whipped cream, and after a series of innuendo-laden comments from the judges, Cas had turned to Dean with a frown.
There were photos they took at half a dozen other bars that hadn’t made the cut and wound up on Charlie’s blog, for one reason or another. She’d taken a few covert pics of him talking with various people. Or rather, him being chatted up by various people he’d politely turned down when they asked what he was doing after the tour. He hadn’t gone there for a singles meetup, after all. It was supposed to have been a date, and turning it into a random hookup hadn’t appealed to him at all. The first time it had happened, Charlie teased him and asked if he’d struck out. Dean had just frowned down into his beer and shook his head. She’d let up after the third, and stopped poking at him with questions about his apparent lack of a love life. It helped that she’d connected with Gilda by that point and had her own good time to focus on rather than pushing at him to forget his woes with some random stranger for the night.
