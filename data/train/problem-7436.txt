Tony got up and pulled Steve to his feet. “‘Night,
Bucky ran a hand through his hair.  It was another Steve-gesture, and Tony’s heart ached a bit for him.  After Siberia, Tony had never thought he would feel anything but hatred for the man standing before him, but now, seeing him here, talking to him,
They wound up back at the Avengers Compound.  Those of them that were left, that was.  Rhodey, Bruce, Thor, Natasha, himself.  There were others that hung around or that they were in contact with.  Thor had brought a foul-mouthed little raccoon-like creature named Rocket with him.  T’Challa’s general Okoye, Carol Danvers, a friend of Fury’s, but of the original team, his friends, his
"He did?"
Tony’s back arched when Steve touched him, touched his hard length, moving his finger just over the tip. “Didn’t--god, baby--didn’t want to stop to fumble around in the drawer looking for something that might not even be there.”
“Hey, do we
loud.”
“That’s cold.”
What if Tony thought the same thing?
Tony snorted frustrated laughter. “Or they don’t.” He ran his hand through his hair. “Okay. Don’t worry. I’ll be there, Pep. I’ll make the meeting.”
“Oh, yes he can,” Ross said.  Victory was writ large on his face.  The White Whale, at last.  “Fury, arrange for transport immediately, please.”
“I know the way I see things isn't always right,” Steve said against his stomach, his voice choked.  “I know there's nothing to be scared of with the doctors and hospitals and stuff, I just....”  He hitched in a watery breath and hugged Tony tighter, as if he was afraid he’d float away if he let go.  “Just don’t give up on me, okay?  I'll do whatever you want.  I'll go to the doctor.  I'll do the therapy.  I’ll be better, I will, just don’t give up on me.”
Steve laughed again, and cuddled closer into Tony’s chest. “Throwing him under the bus? Classy.”
She gripped his wrist tightly.  “Don’t ‘no’ me, Stark.  I’ve been going to say this for a long time.  It’s the anniversary tomorrow, so, no time like now, right?”
If you want to stop here on this cheesy little happy ending (yeah, I know it is, sue me), please feel free to do so.  However, if you choose to continue on the rest of this ride with me, please know that several of the remaining stories in this series contain some very dark things that may be upsetting to some people.  At one point, I was so upset myself I stopped writing for two weeks.  I debated whether to post them at all, but decided if I was going to do this, I would see it through until the end.  I will do my best to tag each story appropriately to let you know what is in each one in case you want to tap out.  The ratings will also go up.  Not only for violence.  There are some nice things in here too.
“Come again,” the salesman said dismissively, and as Tony left, he saw him sweeping the gorgeous vintage watch back into the case. He felt a little pang. He would have bought it for himself if the guy hadn’t acted like such an asshole.
like Tony. And the cat-like purr he made convinced him completely. Nobody else had ever made a sound like that when Steve touched them. Nobody else had ever arched so completely into his touch. Just Tony. He did it again just to be sure. The result was the same.
Twenty minutes.

Tony released his shirt and slid his hand down to clasp Steve’s fingers briefly. “Coffee is a good place to start,” he said. “I like coffee."
“Okay, number one,” Tony said, “you didn’t let
“Yeah?  Tell me what to write, and maybe I’ll say it again.”
Steve kept his eyes on Tony.  “I didn’t mean to get so mad.  I just...the things they were saying…”
Tony ran his finger over Steve’s cheek.  “Speaking of scruffy.”
Steve stood listening, watching Tony’s indecision, the way he bit his lip nervously, the way his shoulders tensed. Steve moved to his side, gripped his upper arms gently, and turned him slightly so he could look into his eyes. “Tony,” he said earnestly, “you don’t have to go with him.” His eyes moved to Howard, swept him stonily. Howard gazed back, and Steve looked at Tony again. “I’ll take care of you.”
Tony shook his head. “Uh-huh,” he muttered. “In your dreams.”
“Mrs. Rogers. It’s good to see you again.”

Why not make it an even ten chapters? This is nothing but fluff.

Tony looked at his watch again, and closed his book with a snap. He wasn’t coming. For some reason, he-
He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, hands loosely clasped between them.  “FRI, would you throw up Baxter’s files, please, angel?”
He skirted around the sofa and made for the kitchen.  He wanted some ice for his hand.  He had plucked out the bits of glass, washed it out, and poured half a bottle of peroxide over it, gritting his teeth against the acrid sting.  He’d looped a bit of gauze clumsily around the wound.  It was lightyears from the efficient job Tony had done for him before, but it didn’t matter.  The serum was already at work.  He could almost feel it stitching his skin back together like a weaver at a loom.  In a few hours, it would be healed.
Tony tossed another log onto the fire, then took hold of the chair and righted it.  There was a dent in one metal arm, the plastic housing shattered.  Tony ran his finger over it and sighed.
“Not like that, no.”
Sam sighed.  “I guess.  Look, call me if you need me.  I told him too, but whatever he needs, you call me.  Okay?”
“Can we go get hot chocolate now?”
“I’m not scared of you, Steve.
Tony pouted a little, but nodded. “Fine. But call me after?”
“Tony!”
Tony held his hand tighter, his eyes grew darker, his voice rougher. “I need you to tell me we’re your first priority. Me. Morgan. Your mom. Dodger. The
Tony bit his lip to keep from smiling.  It didn’t work.  “Steve,” he said, “don’t make me spell it out for you.”
“How’d I do?”
She stood up and grabbed Steve’s hand. “Come
Tony let him drift for a while, working up his own courage, then he nudged him in the shoulder.  “Hey, you.”
Tony wanted to grab him and shake him, but instead, he put his hand on Steve’s back.  Gently.  He moved his thumb in little, soothing arcs.  “I don’t like it,” he whispered, and Steve turned his head to meet his eye.  The humor was gone.  Now he looked sad, sadness touched with worry.  Tony edged closer.  “Will you please put it out?”
Now he wasn’t so sure about anything.
“Maybe,” Tony murmured, and his voice sounded as dazed as Steve felt. His fingers were still on his cheek, rubbing across it. Steve’s lips felt warm. Tingly. Like Tony’s skin had held a slight electrical charge. Maybe it did. Maybe that’s why Tony kept touching it. Maybe he had felt it too.
“You wouldn’t mind?” Tony asked, his voice neutral.
He scraped his toe through the dirt at his feet, tracing a couple of circles, tracing the shape of a star. He sighed, thinking about Tony, wondering what he’d done to make him mad, wondering why he’d-
“Did you sleep?”
“It was fucking amazing,” Sam said. “You should have seen the blood spurt out of Ross’s nose when Tony hit him.”
“It’ll be okay,” Steve said. “You’ll be okay.” But he didn’t look at him. He couldn’t. He bowed his head and looked at Tony’s hands instead. Saw the way they lay on his own knees. So perfect. So pretty. So finely-made. He wanted to hold them again. Kiss them. Run his lips over the pads of the fingers, trace the lines of the palms with his tongue. He shook his head minutely. No. No. Stop thinking about it. He couldn’t do it. He could never do it again.
about it. How could something that had once been so important just fall by the wayside like that? How could something that had been almost his whole world get so lost?
they were alone.  They knew what tomorrow would bring.  They didn’t have the Sword of Damocles hanging over their heads.
“Is there anything new?”
The sun was sitting low on the horizon when Steve stepped out of the prison.  He was carrying the same old ruck-sack.  He was wearing the same old leather jacket.  At least, the weather was more appropriate for it this time.  It was June now.  Just barely, but June, all the same.
“Twenty-three.  How old are you?”
“These are some very extensive files you have here, Doctor.  Very detailed.  I’m impressed.”
He opened a can of Coke and poured it over a single ice cube, then grabbed a bottle of water for himself.  “Here,” he said, and handed the glass to Steve.
Steve ran his hand through his hair, pulling it between his fingers. It was hot in here. With Thad pressed up against his back, his arms around him, his mouth now working over his shoulder and neck, kissing, biting, sucking, leaving marks and bruises, it was hot. Too hot. His skin felt tight, sticky with sweat and Thad’s come. It had never bothered him before. And it had only been an hour. There were nights when he laid there for three, four, sometimes five hours in the same state, and it didn’t bother him. Only an hour tonight. An hour lying in bed, his arm over his eyes, listening to Thad get up, shower, change, call his wife, go into the kitchen, eat an apple--Steve’s stomach grumbled a little while he listened. They hadn’t eaten dinner. Just went straight to the bedroom. The only thing he’d had in his mouth tonight was Thad’s cock--listening to the water turn on, fill a glass, then clunk down onto the countertop. Then Thad came back into the bedroom and got into bed. An hour. Only an hour.
Tony clung to him and nodded. His tears were hot, dark, and so very painful. “Yeah, baby,” he said, ignoring how much it sounded like a sob. “Yeah. One more night. One more night for both of us. Okay?”
“I have to leave.”
“I want to see you too.”
He slipped his fingers between Tony’s, lacing them together for a brief second before turning his hand and scratching his nails along Tony’s palm. It seemed unconscious, movement just for movement’s sake, as if he was trying to calm his own nerves by touching Tony, the only problem was, his touch was anything but calming to Tony. The delicate scrape of Steve’s nails on his palm was intensely thrilling in the same way feeling his tongue in his mouth during their all-too-brief kisses was thrilling.
Tony laughed and cuddled closer to Steve’s chest. “Do I look like I give a fuck?”
I haven't abandoned this story! I've been so bogged down with work and boring adult stuff that I haven't had any time to write, and this chapter shows it. Sorry. I'm trying hard to get back into a normal routine again, so hopefully regular updates and better writing will happen:)
He slid an experimental hand along the length of the body lying against him. It certainly
“Tony,” he whispered, and there were tears just on the threshold. Held back by only his desire to not be watched by the pretty, friendly receptionist while he cried. Watched, and then talked about after he was gone, because she might not talk about the guy who came in to give Mr. Stark a message, but if the guy

He reached out and squeezed Steve’s ankle softly. “Probably.”
“What about this, though?” Tony asked softly, touching Steve’s chest with delicate fingers. “You said it’s lonely. Don’t you want...this? You never liked hiding before. You hated it. You were so sweet to do it for me, but you hated it. You said it was lying. You-”
“Yeah,” Tony said, and lifted himself up on his knees. He grasped Steve’s cock and lowered himself down onto it, breathing through the stretch, exhaling out little gasps of pleasure as he sunk onto him. “Okay, baby."
Steve shifted beneath him, giving off waves of discomfort. Tony wanted to say something to ease him, but he didn’t. He needed to know the answer.
(See the end of the chapter for
Clint snorted.  “Dolphins, Nat?  Really?”
“Please, baby?  For me?”
Captain America was taking the time to talk to him.
“Steve,” Tony said softly.  “Steve, come on.  It’s okay.  It’s me.  I’m here.”
“Oh my god.”
“Too bad,” she said.  “You should have come out with me.  My nights are only rough when I want them to be.”  She smiled at him, the curve of her lips as suggestive as the words she said.
“That ship has sailed, baby,” Tony said. “Or pretty close, anyway. She asked me if I didn’t want her to just ‘trim it a little’ three days ago.”
He never spoke during these meetings.  Nothing he could have said would make either them or himself feel any better.  He just sat and listened to them talk, arms folded, head down, taking it as a penance for not being strong enough, not being fast enough, not being where he should have been because of stupid decisions hastily made.  Their grief was his fault.  Their losses, because of him.
This one is a bit short, but it IS technically only half a chapter XD
Tony’s mouth dropped open.  For the second time in a very short amount of time, he was speechless.
Her voice drifted to them from where she sat on the floor with Doctor Strange.  It was frightened, unsure.  “Steve?”
“No, man.  Those
Tony thought about the deal they’d made.  The deal that got Steve out of prison with all charges dropped.  His record expunged.  He thought of the restitution money that Ross had agreed to pay.  Five million dollars, put into an account in Steve’s name.  He thought of the complete overhaul of the Accords that was going to be put into motion.  At least three Avengers had to be present at every meeting held, and the only items put into the new version of the Accords had to be unanimously agreed upon before becoming a part of them.  It would take a long time, but it would be worth the effort, in the end.
Tony held his arms out to either side and spun in a slow circle.  “Free and clear,” he said.  “You?”
, not
“You’d wanna go with me?” Steve asked.

“Is there something I should know about you and the bagel-guy?” Steve asked. He was still touching the button, toying with it, and looking at Tony from under his long lashes.
Rhodey said Steve had asked him to come pick Tony up.  But here he still was.  Steve had to know it wasn’t going to happen.   He was a stubborn son of a bitch, but he wasn’t stupid.  And he knew Tony.  He knew he’d never leave him here alone.  At least, Tony thought he knew that.
Tony guided him through it, showing him with soft touches and whispered words how it would be between them, how it would always be.  It was excruciatingly slow, excruciatingly sweet, like heaven, heaven having Steve here with him like this.  Heaven having Steve above him, around him, inside him.  His heat, his scent--good old Skin Bracer, byyy
Tony stood outside the kitchen, watching. His heart was in his throat, pounding out the names
Flashback time!
you talking about, Mr. Stark?”
A look of discomfort passed over his face. “I don’t know, Tony. I can’t really afford a place like this.”
He tucked his phone back into his pocket.  Then sat still as the plane banked, then pointed its nose toward the ground.  Beside him, Steve slept on, oblivious.  He’d been exhausted.  It had shown in the lines around his mouth, his eyes.  Tony wasn’t sure how to wake him, wasn’t sure whether he even should.  It was his jet.  If he wanted to spend the night in it with one sleepy ex-soldier, he’d do it.
Steve looked at him with shining eyes. “You did?” he asked.
“You’re no fun.”
American
“I sure am. He’s my little boy.”
“Okay,” he said and grabbed his keys from the bowl by the door. “Tonight?”
“Yes, sir,” he said with absolutely no trace of sarcasm.  As if he were addressing a superior officer.  Tony supposed he was.
Steve’s fingers lingered on the floor.  “Strange said I thought you were Johann Schmidt.  He said that’s why I did it.”

hand.
. That’s never going away.”
. And that helped. Helped him feel a little more under control. A little more centered.
“Hey,” he said.
Strange called him on Friday and told him he was working on something but still had nothing concrete yet.
Clint rolled his eyes. “That doesn’t mean I have to think about it. Or care about it. Or listen to you blather on about it. Or-”
“Stop deflecting, Stark,” Steve said. “But anyway, it doesn’t really matter. What matters is you.
?” Tony cried.
“But--”
Steve pressed the make-shift ice pack against his hand.  “What do you care?”
“I said I’m not avoiding you,” Steve said, enunciating each word with deadly clarity.
Tony squirmed uncomfortably, debating.
Relief coursed through him and he leaned forward, capturing Steve’s mouth with a kiss.  “No,” he said.  “I want you in there.  With me.”
“Two more minutes, Nat,” Steve said.  “Please?”
“What is going on?  What happened?”
Tony huffed out a quiet laugh and lifted the cigarette up to Steve’s mouth. They locked eyes as Steve took it from his fingers with his lips. “That would be interesting to see,” Tony said softly.
He nodded again. “Yeah.”
, himself, was doing. “I can’t say it,” Steve whispered, his mouth still on Tony’s, their lips brushing together as he spoke, “but you know I do, right? You know I always will?”
He tried to ignore the nose so close to his face. He also tried to ignore that he could feel eyes on him, but finally he couldn’t stand it anymore, and cracked one of his own. “What. Are. You. Doing?” he asked.
“No,” he snapped, “I’m serious,” then let out a heavy, sudden sigh. His shoulders fell and he smiled a little. “Sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean to jump on you. I’m worried too.”
“I don’t want to go back.”
A little a
He pulled Tony onto his lap.  "Shut up."
Tony cocked an eyebrow.  “Well.  Not here, anyway.”

That wasn’t new, but the clock said 2:45, and
“Steve--”
Tony sighed.  “Yeah, well, I

She lay beside him after they were done, her perfect breasts bare.  “You really don’t feel good, do you?” she asked.
Tony tilted his head. “Too bad you don’t know anybody closer to your own age.”
with no problems whatsoever. So Steve just let him take over for a while. And it worked. It worked really well right up until the Wednesday in January when everything went to complete and utter shit.
“Are you sure?” Steve asked, but he was already standing up, already shoving his feet into his shoes, already putting his keys in his pocket, already grabbing his jacket from the chair where he’d thrown it when he came home.
Steve blushed and hugged her.  “You’re right.  Sorry.”
“Uh-huh.”
on trial would be the lead story on every site in the world!”
Strange was shaking his head before the words were even past Tony’s lips.  “I’m not listening to this, Stark.  This is dangerous.  You want that girl to go prospecting around in Captain Rogers’ head like some kind of treasure hunt?  My god, Tony, he has just barely started to come back from the brink.  Did I not make myself clear last time we spoke?  He bit his own wrists open less than six weeks ago.  He lost thirty pounds trying to starve himself to death.”
“Yes, boss.”
Steve kept his head down, but he nodded slightly.
“Uh-huh. Just remember you said that.”
Steve smiled a little. Blinked back those tears. “I think you proved the theory.”
“Maybe not as long as you think.”
“He’s right,” Strange said.  “Let’s go.  We should take a breather.  We need to process this, it won’t do any good to go off half-cocked.”
“Alright,” he muttered. “I understand. It’s okay. See you later.”
When the news was over, they’d go to the bedroom.  More often than not, they’d make some kind of love--sometimes fast and hard, sometimes long and slow, sometimes it was just a quick hand-job.  Steve was particularly fond of the nights when Tony would lay him down on the bed still fully-clothed, open his jeans just enough to suck him off, then masturbate until he came all over Steve’s chest and face.  It was messy, dirty, and so very, very good.  Steve usually came again just from the sensation of Tony’s release hitting his cheeks and lips, leaving him a shuddering, weak puddle unable to move for fifteen minutes.  Those nights necessitated a lot of laundry the next day, but Steve never complained.  It was worth it.
Steve forgot his nerves as he helped guide Natasha down that short walkway.  He saw Tony standing next to Bruce, and suddenly, there were no nerves.  Tony winked at him, just a quick, subtle, drop of an eyelid, but it was for Steve, and he caught it.  Caught it and held it near his heart, and after that, it was easy.
“No,” Steve said with dreadful finality. “I’m not going to let you put your life on hold.
Bucky slid a little closer. “Wanna pretend we’re a thing?” he asked, in a low, sultry tone that made Steve roll his eyes. “Come on, Stevie,” he said, and turned in his seat so he lay back against Steve’s broad chest and rubbed up against him. “Let’s put on a show of our own."
Behind him, he dimly heard Clint choking on something, but Steve’s smile had turned shy, and his teeth had closed on his lower lip, and Clint didn’t seem to be dying, so Tony kept his focus right where it wanted to be. Right on Steve.
Tony eased in his grip, eyes shining with a bright, brilliant love that was like looking at the stars on a cold, clear, winter night.
“And what would Captain Rogers think about your wandering eye?”
Tony made a sudden gagging noise.  “Sexy?  Oh-oh my god, Pepper, I think I just threw up in my mouth a little.”
“Then that’s what I’ll give you,” he said, and kissed him deeply. He pulled away long enough to get rid of the rest of his own clothing, then kissed Steve again. First his mouth, then his cheek, his ear. “Turn over,” he whispered, and Steve rolled obediently onto his stomach.
Steve took the stairs two at a time, but he wasn’t sure if his feet touched them at all.  When he neared the top, he stopped and said, “FRIDAY?  Are you there?”
“She’s still sleeping, and she will be for a while yet, but you can see her for a moment.”
He smiled, shyly now, that blush back. “Yes, master.”
She laughed, and again he wondered how he had ever been able to resist her.  She was amazing.  Immaculate.  He didn’t know what he would have done if her name had ever appeared on that Times Square list of the dead.
?” he moaned, dramatically.  “What the hell?  He’s a total douchebag!”
“Want to watch a movie?  It’s
“That’s what I just said.”
Tony let out a breath.  “Fuck,” he muttered, and ran a hand through his hair.
“I signed up for you.  This is just part of it.”
“No! No, I’m just surprised, I guess. You know, ‘cause before. When we spoke before…”
Tony forced himself to take a breath. “Huh?”
Steve pulled him over the threshold, and leaned past him to close the door. He did it softly, but the sound of the latch seemed very loud in Tony’s ears.
Pause. “Maybe.” Pause again. “Is that bad? Do you not like that? Should I loosen up?”
was the one going somewhere. He was floating. Floating away into the ether. Into the never-never land on the other side of that sunrise that was Tony’s voice.
“You’re here with your mother,” Howard said, once he was settled to his liking.
“Easy, huh?”
Tony grinned triumphantly. “Ha. I knew I loved her.”
It was seven a.m.  He hadn’t been propositioned this early in the morning for awhile.
“It was harder with the chair.”
“I can get a scholarship, Dad. You don’t have to pay a fucking dime.”
“Yeah.”
JULY, SUNDAY 11:43 AM
Tony smiled, scraping at the label on his beer.  “I guess.”  He shrugged.  “I wouldn’t know.”
team in town thought that was bullshit.  Tony had already spoken to Jack about this issue.  He didn’t tell Billy about that, though.
“Because it’s weird.”
“What?”
365 days.
I just wanted to say that even though you guys are pretty upset at this story, I looooove your comments so much! I can't tell you how much it means to have you as passionate about this as you are. I hate making you sad, but I am in love with you all right now for being so amazing! I wish I could just gather you all up and hug you!
But things were different now, and Tony finally understood his parents a little better.  He understood that even though you loved someone,
Tony handed the kid a twenty.  “At least take this for yourself.”
“You okay?” Tony asked.
He didn’t sleep. But he replayed their conversation--and every other conversation--over and over in his head, and that made it okay.
He’d designed the layout of it, of course. Made sure there was a private workout space, plenty of big windows to let in the air and the natural light, an office where Captain America could work on his star-spangled plans. Or whatever it was that old song used to say. Beyond that, Tony hadn’t thought much about these rooms. He had assigned an interior designer to be at Steve’s disposal to make sure it was exactly what he wanted and needed, and had assumed it turned out okay because when he asked Steve how everything was, he had just smiled and said,
“I loved her too.”
“Don’t worry. I’ll take care of everything here.”
“Sorry,” he said, giving Tony a soft, puppy-dog look out of the corner of his eye.
Tony moved, trying to lift his legs up over the lip of the bathtub. He thought he was in some kind of shape, but this little endeavor was proving him totally wrong. “Fuck, Steve,” he muttered, grabbed Steve’s ankle to brace himself with, and
“And stay away from Tony Stark.”
The bulb over the sink in the kitchen was on so there was enough light for him to see. He could have found his way unerringly in the dark, but there were a few boxes sitting around the living room. Some were full and taped shut.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She sure won’t.  Whose idea do you think this was?”
“You don’t have to
Tony laughed as he ran his hands up and down the line of Steve’s back. The fabric of his sweater was so soft, the muscles beneath it were so hard, and Steve smelled so good--fabric softener, and menthol shaving lotion, and a hint of that cedar rose bath oil, which meant he’d taken a solitary bath at some point in the last few hours--that it was making him feel a little delirious. Almost drunk.
Nat squeezed Tony.  “Eighteen hours.  Okay?  I swear that’s all, and then one of us--at
“No, Mr. Stark.”
Tony nodded.  “Yes.  He was.”
“I hurt you.”
“I will,” he managed.
“Fuck,” Tony muttered under his breath as he climbed out of the shower and toweled off.  Because, of course, he hadn’t planned on sleeping on the couch.  He’d planned on sleeping here, right here in this bed with Steve beside him.
“Do you mind if I work for a little while longer?” Tony asked.
“Well, fuck me.”
Steve laughed a little and kissed his shoulder. “Better be careful, saying stuff like that,” he said. “I might get used to it, and then where would we be?”
“Tony.  You came.”
“I don’t remember that part, at all.”
“Because you’re
The hallway outside his mother’s room was empty, so he slipped through the door. She was still asleep, but her cheeks seemed pink, her breathing easy. He went to her and kissed her. She stirred, but didn’t wake. In the chair by the bed, Sam rubbed his eyes. He opened them and saw Steve.
“It’s okay,” Tony said, still standing, the officer behind him looking at them both now, unsure, his youth winning out over his training for the moment.  “Baby, it’s okay.  Everything’s going to be okay.”
“But--”
“What’s wrong?”
“I am
Someone was knocking on his door.
There was the sound of clicking nails that he recognized from the other morning on his own hardwood floors, then a soft whine directly through the door.
“Smartass,” Steve sighed, and shook his head with a very familiar look on his face, half-irritated, half-fond.  Tony would never be able to calculate the number of times he’d seen it, and he was a genius.  It was only recently that he’d realized how often the fond part outweighed the irritation.
“Hey,” he said. “Talking, right? Isn’t that what we’re doing now?”
Steve turned his head. His eyes were the same blue, but they looked darker. “Hey.”
Wanda giggled.
There was absolutely no chance of him falling over, they both knew it--the shove had been really no more than a nudge, and Steve’s reflexes were awesome--but Tony grabbed him around the shoulders and held onto him anyway. Steve let him hold on. In fact, he eased backward into his grip, resting against him, relishing the way Tony’s arms tightened around him, the way he burrowed his cheek into that magical hollow between Steve’s shoulder blades. Steve thought this was what Tony had wanted. Just a reason to put his arms around him. A reason to hold him. And that was fine with Steve. It was perfect.
“And take care of yourself.”
Tony stood up, groaning a little at his stiff knees.  Concrete and blow jobs did not go together after twenty-five, but he felt good.  He felt like he was whole again for the first time in a very long time.  Steve held his hands out, and Tony helped haul him up.  Steve immediately wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and buried his head in his neck.  Tony held him.
,” he said pointedly, ignoring Clint and Nat completely--he had principles, after all--and Bruce, who had stayed silent during the entire thing, gave him a tiny smile.
Bruce sighed.  “I don’t know,” he admitted.  “I just know he’s there.  I’m not even supposed to know that.”
“What?” Tony asked. “I mean, you’ve got the rah-rah part down, obviously.” Steve snorted. Affectionately. “Now you just need to look the part.” He touched Steve’s cheekbone. “A little sparkle here,” he said. “A pom-pom there…”
But not October, baby. That’s blasphemy.”
Bruce came over to the work bench.  He picked up a piece of a thruster, tweaked a wire, then put it back down.  “What are you working on?”
She poured another cup of coffee and dumped cream and sugar into it.  “I’ve got to go.”
God, what the fuck
“Good afternoon, boss.”
A word about Paris: that is not what I had planned.  It just happened. Or didn't happen. 🙁.
Slipping into the kitchen, Tony carefully slid open the junk drawer.  Like every other kitchen in America--the world, probably--this one held all manner of detritus that had no other place in the home.  Paper clips, twist ties, coasters, half-used rolls of duct-tape, loose batteries, loose change, an old roll of Certs that had probably belonged to Howard--did they even
“Shh,” Morgan said quietly and pointed at the television. “
Tony felt a hand on his elbow, and when he turned around, he realized how ridiculous it had been to wipe his eyes. He fell right into her arms. Just like he’d done before. And she caught him, just like she’d done before.
“Daddy?”
Tony nodded.  “Yes.”
“Well, no fucking wonder, then.”
Then his phone rang.
“Oh, I do.  I don’t see the point in watching a bunch of grown men play catch and spit all over everything, but SI donated some money to one of the same charities the Yankees did, and they gave me season tickets.  Apparently, they’re starting to get pissed that no one has used them yet.”
“You’re sure?”
, he thought desperately.
Tony sunk his teeth into Steve’s neck just a tad too hard.  Steve sucked in a breath.  “Quit while you’re ahead, Steve.”
Steve slowed to a stop.  He was breathing a little heavier, but only a little.  He smiled.  Maybe it was the endorphins, but a sense of peace had been steadily filling him, brightening the dark places inside him, and he welcomed it with a whole heart, like he welcomed the sun each morning.
“I’m not giving in at seventy!  I’ll still look good at seventy.”
Steve touched the glass.  “Sometimes.”
Tony slid his hand down Steve’s chest, over the dip of his stomach, to the top of his jeans.  He hooked his finger through his belt loop, delighting in the sweet irony of that, and tugged Steve closer.
Steve had his eyes closed.  His head rested against the seat-back.  He’d fastened his seat-belt like Tony had told him to do.  “Sounds like he knows you pretty well.”
“Don’t be an asshole.”
“She looks to be very kind,” Thor said.  “Very soft.”
“Three months,” Nick said.  “He goes in January first, he’s out April first.”
“Are you going to go over and say hi?” Josh asked. His hand had found its way back onto Tony’s thigh. He kissed his cheek. His ear.
“She didn’t see anything but your tongue in Steve’s mouth. We
old,” he continued. “For you. It's not right.”
So, why couldn’t he remember if he had kissed him this morning?
He had another smoke on the way.
“Well.  Relatively okay.”
“I know,” he said, nodding.  “But it’s okay.  I’ve got my pension from the army.  I don’t need it.”
wolf.”
"Good?"
“You mean…” Tony said, then leaned in and whispered intently into Steve’s ear.
“Wait,” Tony broke in.  “What are you talking about?”
No. Better to just relax. Just wait and see.
There was a long deck jutting out from the back of the house.  Some worn but serviceable furniture and the grill Tony had sent up from the city took up most of the space, but there was still plenty of room to move around, and Steve had wheeled his chair to the edge.  The view of the lake was unobstructed from here.  The trees had been trimmed away and there was a lawn leading down to the beach.  There were a few lights in the distance, bright ones at the ends of the docks that led into the lake.  They had one too, just as bright.
“What can I do for Steve?”
“I asked FRIDAY,” Steve answered.  “She said you were here, and that you were alone.”  He turned his head a little, not meeting Tony’s eye.  That pale light outlined the smooth plane of his cheek.  “She’s pretty, by the way.  Seems nice.”
Steve laughed a little. “I don’t know what I was thinking with the stupid aquarium,” he said. “I mean, Christ, you guys are from California. It’s not like it’s nothing you’ve never seen. I just-” he shrugged, but he didn’t let Tony go. He kept holding him, kept rubbing his back.
“Yeah.  I need to practice more," Tony muttered.  "Get down here a couple afternoons a week.”
“Good,” he said, and kissed him again, their mouths moving in perfect tandem, both giving and taking, using and being used. Steve held him tightly, pinning him between the sink and his own body. Tony could feel the counter digging into his back, but he didn’t care. He liked it. Liked that little bit of pain. Especially if it meant Steve was pressing so tightly against him, so tightly he could feel the hardness growing between them.
At first, it wasn’t really even a kiss.  At first, it was just two sets of lips brushing against each other, barely touching, softly, so softly, it was like the touch of a feather.
.” That pouty lip made an appearance as Tony curled his hand into Steve’s shirt and pressed his head into his chest. “Will you please, please, please lie to me and tell me you’ll never leave me again?”
There was no way around it.
“I took her to the doctor,” he said, his voice muffled in Steve’s shirt. “She was fine. I knew she was, but I just wanted to be sure, you know?”
"Yeah," Steve agreed.  "She kind of reminds me of Nat."
Title from the Harry James Orchestra song...as if you didn't know😉!
welcome here. Any time of the day or night.”
The simplicity of those words were like a heavy boot crushing Tony’s heart into dust.  He looked around at the other inmates.  They wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for Steve Rogers.  After Thanos, half of them were gone.  Which ones were dust a couple years ago?  Which of the wives?  Which
"Yeah," Tony said. "You are."
“Come back to us,” she said.
Tony glanced up at the server, pulling his glasses down on his nose so he could see her better.  “Sure.  Thanks.”
Steve kissed his shoulder, relishing the heat of Tony’s skin under his lips.  He licked the same spot, tasting him, burning it into his memory, then kissed him there again.  He had no right to do it.  He knew that.  Tony was no longer his.  He had a young, pretty girlfriend.  He had a life that did not include Steve Rogers anymore.  But he couldn’t stop.  Couldn’t stop his traitorous hands from caressing his stomach, from settling on the cool, blue glow of the reactor.  Couldn’t stop his mouth from travelling over his skin.  Couldn’t stop his heart from beating out the rhythm of Tony’s name just as it had for years and years.  As it would continue to do for the rest of his life.
“All kinds of mental healthy,” Tony had responded.  Had this been brewing even then?  Tony could not bear to think of Steve lying awake while he himself slept the blameless sleep of the oblivious, thinking about how he would end his own life.
“Okay.”
"Okay, Tony. G'night."
“I believe I said, ‘sexy lumberjack’.”
Tony popped another piece of bread into his mouth and chewed thoughtfully, watching out the window.  Steve had taken off his flannel and just had a t-shirt on. It clung lovingly to his chest and back, but not as tightly as it had a year ago.  He'd lost some weight. Tony didn't think it was really noticeable yet to anyone but him. For the most part, Steve still looked as god-like as ever.
Steve smiled at him again.  “It’s okay.”  He looked around at the place.  “And it really is perfect, Tony.  I’m just surprised.  Before, you said places like this were too--”

happy?”
It had started while he, Nat, and Bruce sat watching
“She hung it up,” he said. “I didn’t think she’d hang it up.”
He cut out the “fuck yourself” part, added a little more to it, and took out the “Dear” in the greeting, but everything else was better than anything he could have come up with on his own.  He didn’t say “Love” at the end, either.  Tony had just been joking about that--he hoped--and after much interior debate, he settled on the original “Sincerely”.  It seemed formal and polite.  That was what he wanted.  Formal.  Polite.
When he was done, Tony touched the scrape over his eyebrow. “Maybe right here, too.”
He just hoped the cavalry would be a friendly one. He
Tony slipped his hand between Steve’s thighs and grasped his hard cock, while he plundered Steve’s ass, making him shiver, making his muscles tense and quake under Tony’s tongue.
“Don’t you want to be with him?”
“I wish I could have deserved that more back then,” Steve said.
, and he wanted him so much he would have given up another fifty percent of the population just to touch his hand.
Tony took his hand. “Come on. It’ll be nice. I’ll get it nice and hot. Just for you.”
Tony was quiet while Steve thought about it. His mouth wanted to open and ramble, but he wouldn’t let it. He just waited, eyes open, staring into the corner at the jumble of their discarded clothing--t-shirts, jeans, socks, Tony’s boots, Steve’s sneakers--waiting while Steve arranged his thoughts into a pattern he could then reveal. Like an art piece.
Tony nuzzled into the crook of Steve’s neck and kissed him there, nipping at his skin.  His hands, his worrisome, eager hands, trailed over Steve’s back, his arm, pausing at his waist before slipping under his shirt and touching the bare skin of his stomach.
Steve straightened his shoulders and headed for the lab.
When he trusted himself to speak, Tony said, “Okay.  That’s okay, we don’t have to talk about it right now.”  He put his hand on Steve’s head, running his fingers through his hair.  Steve stiffened beneath the touch but said nothing.  “Just come to bed, huh?” Tony went on.  “Come on.”
“Then you won’t know if I’m
“Come here,” he murmured, and Steve came to him, giving in to Tony’s insistent fingers until they stood flush against each other.  Steve, taller, broader, looming over Tony’s slighter frame.
Steve nodded. “Yeah.”
He slipped out of Steve’s hand and left the house without looking at Howard, just shrugged past him and out the door, grabbing his jacket from the hook on his way out. Howard stood there for another moment, glancing around the small apartment. Steve saw his eyes light on the photos on the wall, the handmade curtains, the worn-in furniture. He looked at Sarah and nodded. “Mrs. Rogers,” he said.
we talk about it later?” Tony asked. “Or are you going to put me off again? ‘Cause I really think we need to.”
Fury and Strange exchanged a look.
“Oh, he doesn’t expect it to stick,” Clint said lightly.  “He just needs enough to get you put in a holding cell for an hour.  Enough for the press to get your names and photos and put them on-line.  How long will it take, Tony?”
“And why would you do that?”
but Steve heard them anyway. Sarah nodded a little, knowing he heard.
Steve sighed out a breath, bit his lip. It was getting harder to concentrate on what Tony was saying. That fuzzy, floaty feeling he sometimes got when they were together like this was back, wrapping around him like a cocoon, safe and secure. It was hard to talk when that happened. Somewhere between his brain and his mouth, the intricacies of speech seemed to get lost, but it was okay. There were really only two words he had to say. Because he was safe. Tony would never hurt him. Tony would take care of him, so Steve could say
Tony curled his hands into the blanket and brought it to his face.  It was Steve’s and it smelled like him, the spicy, menthol scent of his aftershave and good, old-fashioned soap.
Once inside, Tony tried to take her, but Morgan buried her head in Steve’s neck. “
“Let’s eat.”
“Since we found all this stuff on Baxter’s computer, she said.  “Tony and I had a bet.  He said there was no
They were due at Jen's by 11:00, but when Steve didn't come back by 10:45, Tony gave up and left.  Steve was already there when Tony pulled up. They gave each other a terse "Hey" when Tony got out of the car, and that was all.
Howard nodded. “Of course, you should,” he said, then tipped his head again. “Is there anything I can do for her? I could have my doctors examine her.”
“Just look at it.”
“Talk to me, baby, what is it?”
Tony sighed again. What the fuck was he doing here? “I
And Steve wasn’t even looking at him.
?  With me?”
Tony sat at the bar and lowered his head carefully into his hand.  He thought a few of the wasps might have got to sleep.  “He’s a tool.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll go,” Nat said, but he shook his head.
“Doesn’t matter. This is what, your eighth? I can’t."
Tony dropped his head theatrically against Steve’s shoulder.  “Fuck my life,” he muttered, and Steve laughed.
“I can’t believe it’s been a year,” he said glumly.  “I mean, I guess I really only had him for a few months, but--”
“I love you.”
Tony ran his hand through Steve’s hair again.  The tears were there, a flood of them, a fucking torrent, but he would not let them fall.  He grinned instead, a wicked little gleam in his eye.  “Guess there’s only one way to know,” he said.  “Ask me now, soldier.”
“Good.”
“Be patient.”
Tony nodded, his eyes still on Steve’s. “Yeah. Okay. Far be it from me to cover up
“Do you?  ‘Cause we’re not kissing yet.”
“He said when he hit Ross it was like there was a light behind his eyes.”
“It’s not right, Jeff,” Steve said.  His hand was filled with bills.  Five hundreds.  He held them out.  “Please? This is beautiful,” he said, gesturing to the flower-bedecked cake.  “It had to’ve taken you hours, plus the cost of supplies…”
Tony shifted in his arms.  "Then grab my ass or something.  Let me know you care."
SEPTEMBER, TUESDAY 2:00 PM
But he’d see Steve tomorrow.  Ten a.m.  Bright and early.
“Jarvis?” he asked quietly.
“I--”
by you too. For the same reason. And I realized I’d misjudged you. And I kind of wanted to make it up to you, ‘cause that thing? That connection? It didn’t go away when I realized it was you. It got stronger. And I wanted to try and make things easier for you, if I could. If you’d let me. I wanted to-” he squeezed Tony’s hand, “-make you smile. For real, though. Not the PR one you gave the waitress. A real one.”
“I can’t.”
“Don’t you dare be sorry.” She touched his cheek with trembling fingers. “We’ve missed you so much.”
He gave her a squeeze, and despite how hard he was trying, one tear escaped his lashes. “I love you, too.”
He squatted in front of her and brushed her hair from her forehead. “Are you okay, Daddy?” she whispered.
Tony felt the weight of that responsibility settle onto his shoulders.  It was heavy, but it was good.  Warm.  Sweet.  It was a burden he wanted to bear.  He wasn’t sure if he was strong enough to carry it, but he wanted to try.  He nodded.  “Yeah,” he said.  “I am.”
“Hey, Barnes.”
--had ordered it down.
“You know, I worried all night about what I would do if you kissed me.  Every time you held the door for me or brushed up against me, I thought you might do it.”  He smiled and sighed.  “I was a fucking wreck by the time we got home.  You were tearing me apart, you jerk.”
“But it’s what it would look like,” Steve said, his voice rising. “To anybody. To
He gasped as Steve bit his neck, and clenched a hand in his hair.  His eyes flew open, and…
He didn’t want to think about the years they’d been apart. Years that had equaled almost half his life. A lot had happened over the course of those years, and his feelings over them were wildly diverse. Anger, fear, pain, pride, despondency, terror, confusion. He’d felt them all--sometimes all of them at the same time.
Finally, the music level came down.  The door slid open and Steve stepped inside.  As many times as he’d been in here, he still felt overwhelmed by the sheer complication of machinery and equipment that took up every available surface.  But almost worse was the reek of ideas, the stink of knowledge he would never, could never, understand.  The fact that Tony knew everything in here, the fact that it was he, himself, who gave off that nearly physical aroma was the most overwhelming thing of all.  Away from the lab, that was lessened, and Steve could even trick himself into believing it wasn’t there at all.  But here, in Tony’s place, the place where his true nature was allowed to not only thrive, but run wild, Steve was almost afraid of his mind, afraid of him.
The waiting
“Fifteen minutes, Tony.”
He almost pressed ‘send’ on that one, but in the end, he didn’t. In the end, he just took a deep breath, and typed:
(See the end of the chapter for
ready…”
‘just tired’.” She rubbed Nick’s back and shot Tony a meaningful look. “And if Sam or Steve asks, that’s what you tell them. If there’s more to tell later on, I’ll do it then. Okay?”
to move--then spent the night slowly and methodically taking him apart, then keeping him as close to the edge as he could for as long as he could.  By the time Tony finally let him come, Steve was a sweaty, shuddering, panting mess. But he was better. He felt better.
“Yeah, to our faces, but they all would have gone home wishing they’d thought of it.” Tony wiped his mouth with a cheap little napkin. “Then they’d all do it for their next party. We’d be trend-setters.”
The guy--Jack--touched Steve’s arm. “I like that name.”
“Not really.” He took another drag.
Tony breathed out another laugh. “I am
“Damn, baby, this is heaven in my mouth, right now.”
Tony laughed softly.  “If the shoe fits, baby.”  He ran a finger over Steve’s jaw.  “Now, I want you to do something else.”
“I trust you,” he said, and was relieved to discover just how true it was. Because Tony would keep him safe. No matter what. He knew that down to the very marrow in his bones. He knew that if he knew nothing else. Tony would keep him safe. He was always safe with Tony. He might lose his heart, but that was a sacrifice he would eagerly make. In fact, he’d already made it. Months ago. The thought settled him even further. He wasn't losing anything while he was here with Tony. He was giving it to him.
Tony nodded.  “Yeah.  They searched the house.  They didn’t find anything here.”
Sam buckled his seat belt. “Where’s Nicky?”
feeling--lit up his chest again. “Yeah?”
“Knock it off.  Don’t talk stupid.  You’re going to be okay.”
“Great,” Tony sighed.  “Chick-flick.”
“Umm. That’s great.” He folded the sheet with jerky movements. “I’ll clean this up,” he said quickly. “I shouldn’t have it out. I know. I’m sorry. I just...I’ll clean it up. Okay? Sorry. I didn’t think you’d be home for a while. I’m sorry.”
Ross’ stay at The Raft wasn’t official, then.  His was to be an off-the-books imprisonment.  One that only a handful of people knew about.   Even without drugs being pumped into his system on a daily basis, a year in The Raft would be hell for a man like Ross.  Especially since he was being put into isolation.  Only two other men had stayed in that cell.  It was practically factory-sealed.  Just for him.
Steve chuckled and leaned back against the arm of the couch. His t-shirt pulled taut against his chest, and if Tony had not been so distracted by the task already at hand, he would have been more than ready to start another task. A very hands-on task.
“Are you awake?”
But it was beginning to crack now.  And if he didn't get some answers soon, he couldn't be held responsible for what happened.
call you,” he said. “Right after-” he gestured with his hand to his own side. The side where Bucky no longer had an arm. “But they told me you were gone. That you’d been transferred."
” Steve barked, clapping his hand over Tony’s mouth. “Tony!”
“Yeah, you made fun of me.”
“I don’t want you spending any more time with him,” Howard said with a deadly patience. “You’re done.”
Steve shrugged, that disappointed, resigned smile on his face intensifying for a moment. “I’ll see you in the morning.”
“Come here,” he said, and pulled Tony closer.  He kissed his forehead, his cheekbone, then his lips, lingering just a moment before pulling away.
“Yeah, but why?  Wanda didn’t just stir up all the Ross stuff, Tony.  I saw all the rest, too.  How ungrateful I was.  How...cold.  How hard I was on you all the time.”  He sighed.  “Why did you stay?”
He looked out the window at the gray sky. It may have lightened a little, but his mood didn’t. “How can you tell?” he muttered, and threw himself onto the couch. He knew he was being childish. He
“What was that about?”  Steve asked as they got into the car.
“He’s gotta say yes first.”
it now. The water lapping against the tiles, sounding so much like paradise that--
, baby,” Tony groaned, and then he was doing things--doing everything he could think of-- to make it happen. Hours later, by the time he was done, and Steve was lying on his back, an arm thrown over his eyes, drained so completely he could barely move, Tony sat beside him, touching his bare chest, smugly thinking that he had never heard anyone howl quite so loudly in his entire life.
“Paprikash,” Wanda said, coming into the room. Her red hair was held back in a loose ponytail, and she came toward them, untying the dishcloth she was using as a make-shift apron from around her waist. “You must be
“But what if he needs us?”
Tony clenched his hand in Steve’s shirt, then stretched up to kiss him. His eyes were still closed, his mouth soft and supple with sleep. “I like waking up with you,” he said, then slipped back down until his head was on Steve’s chest again.
They wheeled her out of her room early the next morning. Dr. Mickelsen came in first, and they went over the surgery again, just so they all knew what was going to happen. Steve wasn’t sure if this was SOP for all patients, or if Sarah was getting a little more personalized treatment since she worked here, and he didn’t care. All he knew was that he was grateful. He liked knowing there was a clear-cut plan. The doctor seemed methodical and precise, and Steve liked that too. It called to his own military mind-set. It put him even more at ease.
,” he said. “But it’s the way it is. You know?” Steve nodded, and Tony slipped his hand into Steve’s, curling their fingers together. “Come to bed.”
Steve nodded. “Yeah.”
“Steve.”
. Somehow, he swung his legs into the tub and settled them at Steve’s side. He leaned back against the porcelain and lay his head back, giving Steve a weak thumbs-up. “See?” he said without looking at him, “Told you I could do it.”
“We are,” Tony said, assuring him with words and a few strategic kisses. “We’re fine. Okay? Don’t worry about that. Please?” More kisses. Touches to his face and neck. Soft. Soothing. Gentle. “Steve. Baby. We’re okay. More than okay.”
Behind him, Steve sighed, deep and heavy. Tony turned to look at him. His hands were shoved into his pockets, his head against the door. There were lines between his brows. Frown-lines.
“Uhh.”
Wanda reached for Steve and brushed his cheek with the back of her hand. “Igen,” she said, then kissed his cheeks just as she’d done Tony’s. “Nagyon jó.”
“Just let me handle it, okay?” he shot back.
"What?"
The end of the beginning.  There's arguing, pining, and hand-holding.  All good things.
“It’s okay,” Tony said, “but I need you to promise me something.”
“Good,” Tony sighed. He ran his hands over Steve’s back, through his hair, lifted his head so he could kiss him again. And again. “So?” he said. “What do you say? Wanna live with me?”
Steve sniffed, tightened his hold even more.
want you. She’ll always want you.”
Tony stood up and walked closer as if being drawn forward by a magnet.  He was at the counter paying.  In cash.  Tony felt himself smile at that bit of old-fashioned charm.
--said, “Are you alone?”
As usual, the last place he looked was where he found him.  Tony went through the glass walkway, enjoying that heat as he went, and came out in the garage.  Steve was there, standing by the far wall where Tony worked.  He had his hands in his pockets, an old flannel shirt billowed around his thin frame.
Tony burrowed his head further into Steve’s chest, almost afraid to continue, but definitely afraid to stop. “So you’re...just never coming home? You’re just going to stay over there forever?”
Tony started toward the elevator. Steve followed behind, holding Tony’s hand. “Goodnight, guys,” he said with a quiet, happy smile.
“It’s okay, Tony.”
“Why not?” Sam asked.
“Okay.”
“Why not?” Nat demanded, putting her hands on her hips. “And don’t give me that ‘I’ve got to work’ bullshit again. You don’t have to work, Steve. None of us are working tonight.”
“He wants me to take pills.”
He sighed now, into the phone.  “Yeah,” he answered.  “In a roundabout way, I guess it is about Steve.”
He squeezed his eyes shut tighter, and groped his hand out until it could curl around a fold of her pajama pants. He clutched it in his fist, feeling the heat of her calf through the fabric, and he drew as much comfort from that as he could. His other hand slipped into his pocket and grasped his sobriety chip. He drew comfort from that too.

She opened her mouth to answer, but the sound of a quiet knock on the door stopped her. She looked at Steve. He looked back.
“You.  The things you say.  I like listening to you.”
“Okay, okay,” he said, laughing quietly. “They do, but I’m not a superhero. Just a kid from Brooklyn.” He kissed her forehead. “But I

Tony kicked one leg, splashing the water. “It’s not fair to blame it all on Clint,” he said.
She smiled then took his hand. “It
He lifted the corner of the blanket and slid underneath it. He moved close to Tony, as close as he could, and curled his arm around his waist. Steve tucked his nose into the nape of Tony’s neck and inhaled deeply, taking in his sleepy bed-warm scent. He breathed, his arms tightening, his lips pursing just enough to kiss the soft skin that was there underneath them.
“How do you look at it?”
Thank you all for reading this!! I hope it was worth coming back on this ride with me again.  I've got one more story in mind.  Just the one.  It's going to take me a minute to write it because I really want to do it justice if I can.  Look for it sometime in mid-March.  Until then...i love you all, and thank you again!❤❤❤
“Don’t you dare leave this house again, Tony.”
Steve shook his head. “I don’t think Josh would like that, do you?”
Steve looked back over his shoulder at the house.  The fairy lights twinkled in the dark between the fluttering leaves of the trees.  It was beautiful.  Magical.  It cast its spell even here.  “That,” he said.  “
“I’ll talk to you later.”
, an almost physical thing between them. “I’m so glad it’s you.”
Strange shook his head as she walked away.  Tony ignored him.  Just barely.
Tony thought of that now, lying next to him, slowly kissing him, how big he’d seemed in the face of a pissant Nazi-wannabe, yet so small when he’d sat, chastened, next to Bruce in the booth.  How menacing, how sweet, how proper, how passionate.  He was a study in duality, this man of his.  And he was his.  The thought made Tony burst with a happiness that was so encompassing it was almost scary.
“It’s still the military.”
Tony sighed, and Jen squeezed his shoulders.
Tony broke reluctantly away, and bent down to gather Sir Purr up into his arms.  The cat gazed at him adoringly and Tony cuddled him, kissing the top of his head.  “I love you, too, Sir Purr.”  He looked at Steve.  “Baby makes three, right, daddy?”
He exhaled.  Good job, Steve.  “Well, I should--”
Steve clasped his hands together, and tried to imagine that it was Tony’s hand holding his. He remembered exactly what it felt like. Exactly. He remembered the strength in those hands. How steady and firm they were. How they always made Steve feel better whenever they were on him. How they made him feel cared for. Loved.
“Mm.  That’s okay, then.  Kinda nice.”
They got the tire fixed as quickly as possible, and everyone climbed back up onto the bus. It was twilight, shadows dark and lingering, crowding around them all, wrapping them up in a shroud of silent gloom. They all felt it.
He opened his eyes, startled in the gloom.  The thought was his own, but it had seemed to come from outside of himself, and for a moment, he thought he saw the image of a man standing on a green bluff, the deep blue of the ocean behind him.  One eye was covered by a patch, the other bored into Steve’s eyes, into his soul.  Even though the man was old, he exuded a vigorous strength that was almost frightening.  And then Steve saw himself on a dark, broken field, ash and blood and rubble surrounding him.  He saw himself with his shield in one hand, and Stormbreaker in the other, saw himself lift it high, saw himself lit in a corona of lightning.
“So good,” Tony agreed, and with that, Steve’s world was completely full. Completely happy. Tony was happy, so
They left the building and climbed into Tony’s car. It was a little easier for Steve to get in this time. A little easier to ride beside him even with the prospect of spending the entire afternoon with him hanging over his head. Tony chatted as he drove, just like he did on Saturday, and Steve listened. He liked listening to Tony talk. He liked the way he spoke, and the way his mouth moved. He liked the timber of his voice, the quick, confident way he said whatever was on his mind--nothing like the way Steve himself spoke. He usually mulled things over for a moment before speaking. He liked to weigh his words in his mind before letting them out of his mouth. Tony wasn’t like that. Steve admired that.
“No, you want me around,” Steve agreed.  “‘Cause you need a project.  You need something to fix.”
“A few.  I don’t really remember.  They kept me drugged for a while in the hospital.  It makes it hard to know for sure.”
He stood up, already fitting the com-set into his ear.  “Who else is on this channel?  Anybody I know?”
Tony shrugged. “Most of it, I guess. At least this side. I’m not sure where the property line is, but I’m pretty sure it’s a bunch of it.” He gestured vaguely behind him, at the small house and what lay beyond that. “It goes into the woods back there too. There’s a fence. I followed it a couple times when I was a kid, but I got tired and had to turn around and come back.”
“I’ll bet we can make it work.”
Natasha pushed against him.  His skin was hot, burning even through the fabric of his undershirt.  How could he be so hot?  How could anyone be so hot without simply combusting?  “He’s gone, Steve.  Thanos is gone.  It’s over.  Look.”
It did, though.
. For everyone’s sake.
, but we’ve never gotten this far. I never wanted to.”
He reached out and touched Tony’s fingers.  It felt like he was reaching not only across the couple of feet that stood between them, but across the years, as well.  Back to that night when he’d held Tony’s sleeping hand in his.  There had been so much possibility in that touch, so much promise, and even though a lot had changed between them, he hoped--prayed--that had not.
He drove slower today, though.  Tony was with him, sitting in the passenger seat with his feet up on the dash, looking out the window, holding his hand.  And that was enough. Enough to make him feel like he was flying again. He wished they were on their way somewhere else. The ocean.  The mountains. Hell, even the mall an hour away, but this was okay. As long as Tony was with him, it was okay.
blood on your hands.”
ego wouldn’t let him go that far--but he would be a fool to think he didn’t have something to do with it.
Steve nodded as nerves began to flutter in his stomach.  This was important, so important, and he didn’t want to mess it up.  “Right,” he said.  “Look, I’ll understand if you say no.  It’ll be okay.  I won’t make it weird for Pepper or the team, I promise.  It’s just--” he stopped, breathing deeply once, then went on.  “I tried not being around you, Tony, and I don’t want to do that anymore.  I hated it.  I
about someone’s supposed “crush”. It wasn’t about someone else’s (ie. his own, although he had never admitted to it and never would) reciprocal feelings of crushiness. No, this was about practicality and the safety of the good old U.S. of A. on her birthday.
He laughed.  “Can you blame me?  I’d never been asked out worse.  If that makes sense.”
“Yeah.  Not to spy on you or anything, just to make sure you were alright.”  Tony let out a breath and ran a distracted hand through his hair.  “I should have asked you who you wanted to be your contact.  Sorry.  Sometimes I do things...well, you know.”  He raised his voice a little.  “FRIDAY, change Captain Rogers’ contact for Protocol 713-B to Natasha Rom--”
“Three times a week?” Sam asked.
When Steve was pulled away, most of Tony’s heart went with him.  Soldiers threw him to the ground and locked chains around his waist that caught his hands in cuffs, his feet in manacles.
“Come here,” Steve said, and folded him into his arms. Tony's first thought was that he should resist. That he should immediately go down to the lab and start redesigning Steve’s space here to better reflect the warmth of the man himself, but he didn’t. He relaxed into him instead. Put his head against his chest so he could hear that steady, reassuring heart beating in his ear, and when Steve bent his head to whisper in his ear, he sighed contentedly. “Do you want to hold off on dinner for a little while?” Steve asked. “I could run
He squeezed her tight one time, then stepped away. “I’m gonna go take a shower, okay?” he said, trying to make his voice sound normal and not choked with tears. “Then I’ll come help with dinner.”
“Yeah, since about the day we met when you sat in my lap and told me how soft I was.”
you do,” Tony said. “Pretty sure Mom is sick of me moping around the house by now. She’s not saying it, but she gave me a look this morning that said it all.”
“Yup,” he said, checking his watch. Five forty-five. “Party-time.”
Steve smiled and closed his eyes. “He did?”
Barely.
Steve’s eyes opened.  They were dark and possessive.  He curled his arm around Tony’s waist and rolled them both over until Tony was pressed into the mattress and Steve was on top of him, kissing him with hot, heavy abandon.
Even with the sub-freezing temperatures, and the water, and the sealed hatch, Tony wasn’t sure if he’d give in.  He stood silently looking out at the ocean, lip quivering with the cold, hands shaking, his whole body shaking.  He was probably calculating how long he could stand out here.  How long he could wait for someone, anyone, to come pick him up.  Would they make it before nightfall?  It came fast out here in the middle of the big blue.  How long could he stand it with just that jacket?  How long before he’d have to go bang on the hatch and ask to come back inside--
Steve laughed.  His eyes crinkled at the corners.  Tony’s heart fluttered again, and his stomach did a happy little roll.
He smiled at him instead. Just a tiny one, just one corner of his mouth. “Sorry I missed movie night,” he said softly.
“Why don’t you just hear him out, Thaddeus?  He already said he’d go.”
like you don’t like it much anyway.”
up from?” Tony muttered.  “Like father, like daughter, I guess.”
Morgan nodded. “Okay.”
Steve frowned.  “Like what?”
“Don’t talk like that,” Tony said and pulled himself up from the chair’s depths and perched on the edge.  He reached for Steve’s hand and held it between both of his own, marveling at the heat that came off it, how just holding his hand was enough to warm his entire body from the inside out.  “Seriously.  Don’t.  I don’t like hearing you say stuff like that.”  He ran his finger over Steve’s jaw, then over his plush lower lip.  “Please, okay?  I need you.”
“God forbid you shouldn’t be in control one hundred percent of the time.”
to. Touch me, I mean. If it's weird for you-"
isn’t
Steve sat up straight and looked at her with a raised eyebrow. “Mom,” he said in an amused tone. Dodger thumped his tail on the floor at the sound of it. “Did you just give me your blessing to be in a three-way relationship?”
Steve hummed against him, and the vibration of his lips sent a jolt down Tony’s spine. “Yeah,” Steve breathed. “Talking. Or something.”
Steve stopped laughing. A smile remained around his mouth, but his eyes were sharp and alert. “You’re serious.”
had been when he answered.
“Maybe,” Tony answered.
He finally turned down the long driveway and coasted to a stop in front of the cabin. He had called the caretaker while Steve was getting dressed and offered him two hundred dollars to run down and make sure everything was clean and there were no dead mice or something in the bed. He was pretty sure he was being silly--Howard still owned the place, still had the guy check on it every couple of weeks just in case--but he wanted this to be perfect. For Steve.
“No.”
“Nat--”
?” Tony muttered fondly, and rubbed his hand over his face. But he didn’t retreat. Not this time. He didn't want to, and he knew Steve didn't want him too. In spite of their current positions, he knew. He eased himself down until he was sitting on the edge. He took his shoes off and tossed them behind himself, then did the same with his socks. “I’m sorry about that, by the way,” he said, as he started to roll his pant-legs up so he could put his feet in the water. “The party? I tried to say it last night, but I mean it, Steve. I’m sorry.”
Tony’s thumb brushed along the underside of his jaw. “You okay?” he asked, and Steve nodded.
“Really?”  Steve looked at him finally, a tiny rueful smile on his lips.  “‘Cause it seems like every time we do, we wind up like this.  Pissed off and tired.”
And then he was there, standing in the doorway smiling, and Tony let the breath out, calm rolling over him. That was new too. Nobody settled him the way Steve settled him.
Pepper turned to Strange and laid her hand on his arm.  “Stephen, would you…?”
Rhodey put a friendly hand on the back of his neck.  “I do know, but you can’t always save someone who’s drowning.  You can throw them a life preserver, but if you jump in after them, sometimes you both go under.”
“That’s probably true,” he agreed, taking a sip from his own cup. “
Tony hoped she was right.
Rainy afternoons aren't ALL bad...
“Nothing.  Never mind.”
P.S. The translations from German are going to be given in the next story.  But, of course, you are welcome to Google them before if you'd like:)
Steve thought about it. Or pretended to, anyway. “Um. Favorable.”
“Call and tell you how
That could be.
“Baby?” Tony said quietly, and Steve finally looked at him. His eyes were dark and filled with fire. If it hadn’t been directed at him, Tony would have found it knee-bucklingly sexy.
“That’s the one.”
” he repeated, and he’d lost the pout. He was teasing now. Softly and sweetly, but still teasing. “Yeah, how old are you, grandpa? Twenty-one? Twenty-two?”
“No, ba-Steve, it’s not. I know it’s not. But it’s not exactly the way you think it is either.” Steve let out a harsh breath, and Tony pressed his shoulder against Steve’s hard bicep. “I know I can’t change your mind. Not right now. But I just want you to remember that you’re the only one who feels that way. Nobody, including Bucky and everybody who was in your unit, thinks it was your fault. They trust you. Present tense, Steve. They love you. Everybody loves you.” He brushed his fingers through the fine blond hair at Steve’s temple, then tapped it with the tip of his finger. “So get out of
“Be happy when I
“Just a little right now.” He paused meaningfully. “But, I’ll bet you could get me there.”
Steve laughed a little. “Buffalo.”
“Straight out of the battered-wives handbook.”
The shocked looks they had received when they first came to town had tickled Tony pink, but after the initial surprise wore off, nobody seemed to care much, and that tickled
“I don’t want you to do something you don’t want to do.  That’s not what this is about.”
Tony laughed again. It was soft, and low, and fond. Steve had never heard anything so nice in his entire life. “I’m sorry I didn’t show today,” Tony said. “I’m so sorry.”
innocent.  We’ve all fallen,” Natasha said.  “She’s proven herself enough since then.”
Steve’s breath hitched in his throat. His whole body stilled. Tony held him, running his hands through that short hair, down his back, soothing him as best he could, but at the same time, could not help but feel the hardness of Steve’s cock against his thigh. He wanted it. He wanted to feel it moving inside him. He wondered fleetingly if Steve had ever done it with anyone else. They’d never done it together, but had he ever been with anyone else like that? Or would Tony be his first? His only? The idea was fiercely attractive. Even if he was his “only” for a little while, he wanted it. He wanted it so badly.
“You’re right,” Tony said, coming up next to Clint.  “It is a public space.  But if you come near my friend again, I’ll call in some favors and find something on you.  Now, I’m sure you upstanding young men don’t have anything serious on your records, but all I really need is an unpaid parking ticket.  Just something to get you detained.”
“You’re right.  It’s not.”  He cupped the back of Tony’s neck with his hand.  “But it almost is.  Hitler murdered thousands because of some grand vision he had.  This guy...this guy dusted billions, Tony,
“He fell?  Is he okay?”
before you met him.”
Steve broke a piece off of his muffin and popped it into his mouth. The “blueberry” gritted against his teeth when he chewed. He washed it down with a sip of coffee, and turned the page in the book. It was one of his mother’s books. An old copy of
Kisses. Many kisses to make sure he knew he was kidding. Kisses until Steve laughed in the back of his throat and put his arms around him.
you?”
“I’m sorry,” Tony said.
Steve scrubbed a hand over his face.  “We were pretty happy, weren’t we, Tony?” he asked.  “I didn’t just make that up, did I?”
The steaks were perfect, if Tony said so himself, fatty, juicy, tender bits of deliciousness that maybe weren’t quite worth what he’d paid, but still pretty damn good.  Tony was especially gratified when Sam, who was always perfectly friendly, but never truly warm, wrapped him in a surprise hug and declared it was the best meal he’d had since his momma had passed away.  The others agreed unanimously, and Tony indulged in ten minutes of preening glory.
Tony raised his head, slipped one arm up around Steve’s neck, and pulled him down to kiss his lips. It was small, conciliatory, but sweet. “Nothing you need to worry about, baby,” he said.
“They were asleep on the couch, and--”
“I never stopped,” Steve said.
“You’re gross.”
Mr. Stark, loud and impatient: “Tony. Let’s
-- “Tony said.  Forget it.”
Then Tony turned his head and saw him standing there. He stood up straight, his lips curving into that smile that Steve loved so much, the one that felt like Tony reserved just for him, and Steve tried to etch that into his memory too. This one came a little easier, because he’d seen it before. Of course he had. He’d seen it almost every day for an entire school year six years ago. Steve smiled back and came the rest of the way down the hall.
Tony turned, heart picking up its pace again.  He knew what he would see, and wasn’t disappointed.  Or, rather, was exquisitely disappointed.  In himself.  For not preparing Steve for this eventuality.
“I wish you could have too,” Steve answered on a wistful breath. “They were-” He cleared his throat. “They were good guys. Smart. Strong. Just...just
Steved exhaled slowly.  "How about the next forty years?"
Tony exhaled as if Ross had punched him in the gut.  “What did you just say?” he gasped, and a mean, diaphanous thought sailed through his head--
Steve felt the anger flow out of him on a rush of breath. “Hi, Nat.”
“Maybe.  That depends.”
One hour a week? Tony thought darkly, wishing Ross would roast in hell as he watched Steve--
“Don’t you think you should go find out?”
Wanda bore down suddenly on Steve’s hands.  Her eyes flared a misty red, clashing with his icy blues.  “I lost my mother and father,” she said deliberately.  “I lost Pietro.  I was used by both Ultron and Thanos.”  Steve winced, but he stopped trying to pull his hands away, and simply looked at her.  “And I lost Vision.”  She looked at him fiercely.  “You helped me carry all that.  Let me help you now.”
And now they were getting married. And Steve was standing beside Bucky, listening to a priest laying out a framework for the rest of their lives. Helping Bucky and Nat make promises to each other. Helping them tell each other that they wanted to be together. Together forever.
“Yes, boss?”
“What did you mean?”
Steve squeezed his hand.  “I’m glad you’re here,” he said.
Steve lay flush against him. He brushed Tony’s hair back. “I’m here now.”
“Language, Rogers,” Sam said, and they both laughed, leaning into each other, their heads together, Sam’s arm around Steve’s neck. When the laughter died down, Sam tightened his hold, hugging Steve to him. “I’ll tell her to back off a little, okay? I know you’re not in that headspace right now.”
Steve’s body fell back again, but he was smiling.  “My-My mom was the only one who ever called you ‘James’.”
“Let’s go!”
Natasha slipped her shoe back on and bent down to adjust her stocking, straightening the seam that ran up the back. She was watching Clint openly now. Laura too, but mostly Clint. She pushed her hair behind her ear. “What’s our play?” she asked. “I’ll back you.”
“Look, I’ve done this with you for days now.  Are you ever going to let it drop?”
“Don’t worry,” Tony sniffed. “No snot. I promise.”
Steve’s hands were soft on his back, soothing and warm.  “What’s the matter?”
They had another barbecue on the 4th.
He dropped extravagantly, suddenly into Steve’s lap and lifted his feet into Natasha’s, sprawling across them both.
(See the end of the chapter for
her,” Tony corrected, and pulled out of Steve’s arms. He took a few steps down the counter, away from Steve. It left Steve feeling cold. For the first time all day, he felt cold. “We’ve talked about
He stretched a hand out and put it on the sheet where Steve had never laid. It was crisp under his fingertips. Pristine. Cold. He scratched his fingernails over it very lightly, wishing with a deep ache that it was Steve’s back he was touching.
“It is,” Steve insisted, and it sounded like a lie even to himself. “Just friends. Just coffee.”
Tony stood behind the workbench, a piece of the armor in front of him.  The hot smell of a soldering iron permeated this corner as he applied it to the metal.  He didn’t look up, but he didn’t tell Steve to leave either.
He shifted on the bed. He was on his back now, Tony’s warmth right beside him, pressed up against him. He was thirsty. Tired. A little sore. He felt drained, but not empty. No. Never empty with Tony here with him, just...
“And you,” Tony said, kissing him once more then grabbing his shoulders--those
Tony let out a sigh, the smile becoming a little softer. “Oh. That’s nice.
“Bucky?” she asked, holding out her hand and arching one eyebrow.
the ‘them’ that was Steve and Tony, Tony and Steve, anyway--but dictated every second of their lives.
to talk to me,” he said.  “I tried.  He just...won’t.”
“Yeah.  They put us in the same room.”
She shrugged lightly.  “I gave him my number.”
Steve sat forward and Tony grabbed one of the two pillows.  He fluffed it, then put it back, fixing it in place.  “‘Kay.  You’re good.  Lie back.”
Steve drew in a hot breath. “Are you caught up?”
Right now.
“Has that ever happened before?”
“Again?” Tony asked quietly.
Should
Tony ran his hand through Steve’s blond hair. “Baby,” he said. And that was all. There was no other answer. In Tony’s heart, he knew there would never be another answer to anything. Just that.
“Um.” Steve blinked as Tony shoved a paper cup of coffee into his hands.
They made out for two hours after that.  Tony’s orgasm had been earth-shattering.
He put his hand on the knob and turned it.
Steve watched him go, then reached across the table and took a pinch of the spilled salt in his fingers.  He tossed it over his shoulder.  They’d need all the luck they could get.
probably tired.  I did just wake you up, after all.”
“Just good?”
He dropped the dog’s leash, and Dodger nudged his cheek with his muzzle before trotting off toward Morgan. She brightened considerably when she saw him coming, and knelt to hug him again. Tony smiled. He couldn’t help it. He didn’t like dogs--or maybe he was scared of them...whatever--but he didn’t mind this one. And Morgan was over the moon for him. He could see that. He was
He squeezed his shoulder.  “Yup, it’s me, Steve.  Just me.  Do you want to come inside?”
“Mmm. No. I’m starving.”
“No?” Tony asked, and Steve could tell he was trying too. Trying to get past the idea of the July that wasn’t. “You don’t want to swim with the fishes, huh? Better than sleeping with them.”
"Steve," Tony began, but Steve held his hand up.
“But I didn’t.  Steve.
“Because look at him.” he said, and now he looked over his own shoulder at Steve. His face softened when he did into something gentle and filled with the love of a brother. “Look at the kind of man he is. Strong. Decent.
“‘Kay.”
He woke up before the alarm. That never happened.
wanted. He just hoped Steve wanted the same thing.
Tony nodded. “Yeah.”
“Oh,” Steve said, smiling himself now, shyly.  “Umm,” he ran a hand through his hair, “yeah, at least I think so.”
“Wanda?”
“Let’s get together tomorrow.  We have a lot to discuss.”
“I need to hear that one more time.”
The bed was large, but the room itself was sparse, almost monastic.  There was a dresser.  A chair.  A TV.  It was very much like the room Steve had lived in at the hospital.  Steve might have thought so, too.  His eyes moved restlessly, taking in the familiar walls, the bed, the few books on the shelf.  A lone Yankees pennant hung on the wall.
Sarah smiled, running her hand through his hair. “He’s downstairs,” she said. “After you called, he was...pretty restless.” Steve ducked his head guiltily, and she laughed softly. “Don’t feel bad, honey. He’s fine. He just needed a distraction, so I took him down to start packing up some of your books and things.”
“You’re still keeping score?”
“Don’t leave me,” Tony said desperately.
“Bruce is a good guy,” Steve said lightly, glancing at her out of the corner of his eye.  “He’s smart.  And nice.”
“Baby, you’re not giving her enough credit.”
Tony laughed low in his throat. “Yeah. I remember. We’ll see if
Steve closed his eyes.  “Yeah.  You might as well just say, ‘Hey, you’.”

plan helped Steve and Doctor Strange just happened to be there,” Tony amended.  “How’s that?”
“Then you shouldn’t go tomorrow,” she said, curling up against his side. “Daddy will get lonely when you’re gone. You need to stay
Bruce had never looked happier, Tony thought, and if he could look like that while the woman he loved was in the arms of another man, then Tony certainly couldn’t feel upset about it.  Especially when Steve caught his eye and winked.
“Hey,” Tony said sharply. “Hey, you need to stop. Stop talking about what you can give me, Steve. I don’t care about any of that, and you know it.” He grasped Steve’s arms. “Baby. Baby, you’re all I ever wanted. And, it’s not like you’re the only one who’d be working. I’m going to be working at SI after I graduate. I’ll have plenty of money. More than we could ever even spend. You wouldn’t even have to work if you didn’t want-”
He clutched her hand, his fingers a vice-grip, grinding the bones together.  “Are you sure?  We have to be sure they’re all dead.  If any of them are alive they could re-group.”
Steve drained his glass and turned away.
His eyes were still sparkling with residual laughter but when they met Tony’s, they seemed to soften just a bit. His lips did the same, easing from that million-dollar grin to something gentler but no less captivating. Tony felt something inside his gut do a little flip-flop. Probably just indigestion. Yeah. Indigestion. It had nothing to do with that smile. Those baby blues looking at him so sweetly. Nope. Not at all.
“I just wanted to say I’m sorry.”
“I guess-”
“Okay,” Tony said, and closed his eyes, rubbing his temples with one hand. “If we’re not calling it an ‘episode’, what are we calling it?”
Steve put his hands on Tony’s hips and pulled him flush against him. He bent until his forehead was pressed against Tony’s. “I’m not dumping you,” he said. “I’m telling you that’s why I’m so nervous around her.”
Steve nodded. “Yeah.”  He reached up and touched one of the buttons on Tony’s shirt. “You were going to work,” he said with a wry smile. “Why didn’t you tell me you were going to work?”
“He’s thinner, but yes, that’s him.”
"No, I'm not."  He held onto Steve's arm when he tried to pull away.  "They're here. They're right here. Oh my god."
“Goodnight.”
Tony glared. “‘Kay, first off, I’m going to kick your ass for being a sarcastic dick,” he said, and Steve laughed. “And second, it’s October, and you
jokes. Just his. Not some stupid fucking soldier-type with a jawline as strong as Steve’s, and blue eyes that Tony thought looked just a little less soulful than Steve’s, but maybe more prone to sarcastic humor of the type Tony himself specialized in, and just what the fuck, Steven Grant Rogers? Huh? Trading up? Is that what he thought he was doing?
“But we’re not done. You said you’d be Batman
“You’re an easy man, Sam.”
It all sounded like good news. Steve could see why Tony would think it was. Because it sounded like Howard was giving Tony exactly what he wanted. “But?” he said. Because there was a “but”. Of course there was.
“Is everything alright?”
Nat, Bruce, Sam, Clint, and Rhodey all sat watching the two of them go at it, their eyes ticking from one side of the room to the other like spectators at a tennis match.  None of them had witnessed a full-blown Steve/Tony yelling match in a long time.  It was funny that they could get so passionate over such a little thing.
“I would have punched you in the gut, but you don’t have one.  My fist would have just bounced off those goddamn abs.”
Tony kissed Steve again then settled back against him. The beat of his heart was soothing in his ear. The perfect sound. The perfect feeling. “Just give them to me now.”
Tony left.
“Mom?”
“What the
“Baby, I
“You should come out with us next time,” he said. “Let Sam beat
Tony reached up and pressed his mouth to Steve’s.  “You really are adorable.  How can a grown man be so adorable?”
"Yeah.  A gray hair."
“Captain Rogers?”
They went into the deli.  “I’ll just be a few minutes.  Sit down.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. “You’re not getting my point, baby.”
Steve’s brow constricted again, a look of sheer longing on his face.  It was the look of a starving man at a banquet.  The look of a man dying of thirst contemplating a freshwater stream.
Steve stood up. “Not me,” he said. “James here, might need one though.” Steve swallowed the rest of his beer. “I’m going to go find the restroom. Keep him in check while I’m gone, ‘kay, Nat?”
“Jesus fucking Christ,” he muttered, and Steve laughed, pulling out of his arms. He went back to the stove and stirred the stew. Tony looked at his phone.
“Tomorrow?”
Steve got to his feet, and the two men stared at each other over the table.  “When?” Steve asked.
Steve’s frown of concentration became almost dangerous, making Tony’s heart hammer in his chest.  The laser-focus of Steve’s full attention sizzled within him, singeing his nerve-endings.
Tony watched him sleep.  Watched the rise and fall of his chest, the twitch of his fingers, the subtle movement behind his closed lids as his brain shifted into the REM cycle.  What would they say when they spoke?  I love you?  I need you?  I don’t want my life to be without you?  Or would it be “Thanks for the ride, Tony.  I’ll see you around”?  He had no idea.  Wasn’t sure what would be best, even now, seeing him sleeping so peacefully across from him.  What did Steve want?  Or, better question, what did Steve
The back of Tony’s neck prickled with pride and pleasure at being included in a “we” with Jeff.  It was a feeling he hadn’t had in a long time.  Not since Jarvis was alive.
Steve’s lips curled in a slow, dark smile.  “Yeah.”
Tony pressed closer.  The thought made him cold.
Steve.
“Um.  It wasn’t just him.  It was--oh god, Tony, that feels--Doctor Baxter.  He was in on it--don’t stop--He was in on it, too.”
“‘Kay,” Steve said into his skin. His own arms crept around Tony’s waist and held on. “Good. ‘Cause I don’t want to.”
“Throw some over your shoulder,” Steve said automatically.  Clint looked up, surprised, and smiled sadly.  He pinched a bit in his fingers and threw it over his left shoulder.
“Good,” she said. “But then yes, I definitely need to meet them. I need to make sure they’re good enough for you, don’t I? Gotta make sure they’ve only got the best intentions.”
Steve winked, tiny and secret, and she smiled back.
He climbed the stairs, just like he’d done last night. He loosened his tie. He’d done that last night too. Last night, he’d gone to bed alone. Hopeful, but alone. He hoped that wouldn’t be the same.
Laura and the Tiny Bartons picked bunches of wildflowers and attached them to the chairs along the aisle and arranged some at the altar near the lake where the ceremony would take place.  When they were done, and the kids started to get bored, Bruce showed them how to fold origami cranes, and they spent the evening folding paper like mad.  One thousand made wishes come true.  They didn’t quite make it, but it was okay.  It wasn’t really the number that mattered, Bruce told the disappointed kids, kindly.  It was the feeling behind it.
Has it been worth it?
two months older than you, asshole. It’s weeks.
“You always say that.”
“Yes, it does,” Tony said, and his voice sounded sharp in his own ears. Much sharper than he had ever wanted. Steve shifted, but didn’t move from where he was pressed against the door. Watching him. Just watching with those blue eyes. “Sorry,” Tony muttered. “I’m sorry, Steve.”
Fury put a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
furniture? What if it was
Steve smiled at him, looking both hopeful and unsure. Tony’s heart melted, and he kissed him again, much more thoroughly. “I love you, baby.”
Tony let out a breath almost like laughter, and pressed his forehead against Steve’s chest. “God, Steve,” he muttered. “You and me. How the fuck did we ever get together in the first place? Huh?”
Tony got out and stretched.  Steve wasn’t wrong: it was definitely quiet.  Birds chirped in the surrounding trees and the breeze through the leaves seemed like the loudest sound out here.  He looked across the lake.  There were a few other houses around, but not many.  He’d had FRIDAY do back-ground checks on all the neighbors.  So far, everything looked good.  There was one guy who was evading taxes, and a Mr. from one side of the lake was spending afternoon sack-time with a Mrs. from the other side, but that was all.  Boring stuff, really.  He’d keep checking, but they should be fine here, for now.  Boring was what Steve needed.  What they both needed.
Not that it was boring now. Not now that Tony was here. And he was scared. Scared because soon Nick was going to send him the new parameters of his mission, and even though he was still position three, he was scared that the new parameters would include watching
“Love,” Tony said, smiling a little at him. “You can say it, Rhodey.  We’re past all that toxic-masculinity-I’ve-got-no-feelings bullshit, aren’t we?”
Tony was standing by his locker when Steve came around the corner, just like he said he would be. Steve hadn’t been one hundred percent positive he would be, but there he was, looking as pretty as Steve had ever seen anyone look, his hair falling over his brow, his leg bent and propped against the lockers, his head down, headphones in his ears. Steve lingered a little way down the hall, his heart jogging a bit in his chest. He stood still, not wanting to disturb the picture Tony made, wanting to remember the way he looked right now, wanting to always remember, just in case things didn’t turn out the way he wanted. Just in case he only had a year with him. Or six months. Or six weeks. Or six days. He just wanted to remember the way he looked right now.
Steve breathed out a slow breath. Trailed a hand down Tony’s back. “Where’s Morgan now?” he asked.
“I knew I shouldn’t have left you two alone together,” Steve mused, his eyes slipping shut.
“Stay with me.”
“They don’t know what the fuck they’re talking about.”
Tony smiled into his lips.  “Then what’s the problem?”
They sat down, side-by-side. The TV had switched to morning game shows, and they both stared blankly up at the screaming, gasping contestants winning cars and losing solid oak bedroom sets. Sam kept his hand locked firmly on Steve’s wrist, giving him an anchor, and Steve concentrated on that more than anything. Just that touch, that point of contact that meant he wasn’t alone in this. He had someone here with him. A friend. A
“Well, she doesn’t have to kiss you, does she?” Tony said.
“I don’t know.  A long time ago, I guess.”
“I have tried.  I bought it toys, and treats, and I feed it every morning, and when it scratches on the window at four-thirty in the damn morning, I get up and let it in--”
“I shouldn’t do this,” Tony whispered, even as he put his arm around Steve’s neck and pulled him closer.
Steve looked at them.  The serum was helping, and they’d heal soon enough, but they still looked bruised and swollen.  Blood had crusted in an ugly gash across the left one.  The right just looked mangled.  “Oh,” he said.  “I forgot to wrap them before my workout.”
Tony nodded, his worry easing for now, and gestured at the place.  “Well?  What do you think?  Howard bought it forever ago, but I don’t know when anybody ever actually stayed here.  I partied here a few times when I was a kid, but since then…” He trailed off with a shrug.
Indecision fluttered through her body, making her shiver.  She reached out and closed her hand over his.  He looked at her with wild, grief-stricken eyes.  “Sam went to find Tony,” she said.  “Maybe with the suit--”
Steve smiled and laid his head down onto the table, resting it on top of their clasped hands. “You deserve a damn medal for all you put up with from me,” he said.
Some answers, and some other stuff...

“I was asking if you know how crazy you are in the form of a rhetorical question.”
Tony ducked his head. “My father,” he mumbled. “I think we’re going back to California when school gets out.”
Once he heard the rattle of the shower curtain and the tinny thunder of water, he slid off the counter.  He didn’t feel slighted by Steve’s attempts to keep him at bay over the last hour.  It was temporary, and every particle of his being knew it.  Steve wanted him.  His wanting had been coming off him in warm, relentless waves, like the ocean on a quiet Mexican beach.  He wanted him, and he’d have him tonight, maybe tomorrow, surely by the day after that.  Tony would wait.  He
Sir Purr was lounging in his cat bed by the door.  Steve absolutely refused to let him sleep in their bed, and Tony was smart enough to let him have his way on that point.  Besides, Sir Purr seemed to enjoy having his own space.  Maybe because he was an old tom who had never shared a bed before.  Tony was an old tom too, but he adored sharing a bed.  He supposed he and his cat-child couldn’t be in sync on every point.
