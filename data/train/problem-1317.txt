"You must understand that Eric and Victor...that in the time I spent with them, they were only ever allowed a facsimile of myself."
The next thing John knew, he was being awoken by the sudden stabbing of daylight to his face and the skittering of rings on a curtain rod. He grimaced against the light and made to move, only to moan at the aches that sang out in his tight body.
John had merely walked straight up to the General in the customary manner to discuss the terms of battle, and instead plunged a large curved stiletto that had been hanging from his belt (the only weapon he had brought) right into the man's throat.
"Ah. You are speaking of these I take it? Here. Have a look." Brother Michael smiled and brought over the leather roll that housed individual pockets for all of his curious vials, laying it out over John's lap for inspection. As he stood, he placed his hands on his round belly in fake contemplation and patted it kindly. "The virtues of fasting to the pleasures of eating . . . you can see which I prefer.
Sherlock cupped his face with his large hands, examining him. Smearing his thumbs where John's wetted cheeks reached his wet chin, while light eyes sliced through his brain and saw particulate galaxies that John could never ever hope to see within himself. And as if no other choice would suffice, Sherlock pulled and stretched up and kissed John as soundly as he possibly could in answer.
But what were they going to do if it went badly? John was certain Sherlock wouldn't have any trouble returning back to normal. He'd do whatever he did to the celestial physics of the universe and blink it away. What would a bad idea between friends matter in comparison?
"Hail goodly brother, it is a fine day." The monk said cheerfully when he was close enough for conversation. He fumbled a bit over the roughened earth in his loose sandals and had to readjust the hinged spectacles precariously perched upon the bridge of his nose as he came to a stop, extending his hand. When he moved, the little circular pieces of glass caught in the sun and shone brightly. "I was wondering if you might help me..."
Amused and intrigued, Sherlock looked him over, reading him the way he'd done so many times before, but now to the freshly peeled back layer of naked John held on display.
Splayed fingers swept gently across the swells of his pectorals. Hands claiming sensation that was not his to claim. Stuttering over Sherlock's nipples through the thin fabric of his shirt and making Sherlock flinch, drawing a tiny breath in surprise. Charles had always been delighted by his body's sensitivity.
John flexes his hand by his side and blows out a breath, nodding, knowing what Sherlock can't say. "There have been a lot of things in my life that have tried to put me in the ground and they haven't managed it yet, but what they have managed to do is to make me regret some bloody enormous things in the process. Which I'm not willing to let that happen again.
"Maybe. I mean, how come you never treat him with open derision like Donovan and Anderson? You've got to be tempted sometimes." He felt Lestrade's eyes fall onto him and turned. "You're always so collected."
"Oh," John was laughing through his nose. "That's a good thing to know. But what I was really going to ask," he continued, "was what you were planning on using them for?"
Sighing, John clicked open the cabinet, fished out his toothpaste, and when he shut it again started sharply. Sherlock had silently moved to stand very close behind him, grim and pale as a spectre. "Jesus Sherlock!" John growled, having to twice now recalm his racing heart.
The lick of dark in the dim of the window turned his head, acknowledging the small creature with newly opened eyes that seemed to shine with no light, the color of the moon. And with a shifting only seen between the black shapes of the ephemera around him, a single candle was lit with the flick of firesteel.
They stood back as they watched Sherlock work, watching him swoop and duck, lean in and tilt back. He looked at everything from different angles, different distances. He disregarded certain areas outright, while others were practically focused on to the point of melting under his scrutinizing gaze. What difference there made between the areas, no one but Sherlock could tell.
It felt glorious, how the silken hose rolled so smoothly up his muscled thighs. How delicious it was to tuck himself into his new braies and not be scratched by them. How it changed his entire posture to don the velvet doublet and cinch the belt, before sliding into the cloak.
Huffing out a laugh he very much needed to release, John turned his head to nose into Sherlock's hair. His breath catching short as he felt Sherlock release his towel with a flick and leave him standing naked once again.
From its resting place, the bird could not see the rivers the castle shouldered; it could only see the breaks of their crashing waterfalls as they poured from the cliff side before it, like tears down cragged cheeks to land upon the bailey below.
"It is one of Mendelssohn's better ones." Sherlock accepted the praise in his own way, sounding slightly out of breath.
"Good evening Dr. Watson." The woman says while he continues to stare. Her voice is as brittle and light as a salted wafer and so damned familiar. Her pronunciations are clear and concise with the well-defined cadence of a monarch. And her smile, that peculiar and one-of-a-kind smile, that rancid grin of all brown teeth--
"Hardly." Sherlock snorted derisively.  "You merely startled it before. Approach calmly this time and you won't have a problem."
It rose like a warm summer wind, pulling at his soul in the same way the Adhans, the calls to prayer he'd heard being sung in Afghanistan had all that time ago. And suddenly his dreams were being painted by memories long forgotten. By shifting sands and trickling sweat and a sun that had burned so hard it had been a white hot hole in the sky.
"No worries." John responded with a smile. "I'm with someone anyway." The casualness with which he said it was incredibly satisfying.
John had been tilting his torso over the edge when he'd found it, delighted that his new home provided him a beach access. Of sorts.
"Sherlock. I swear to God. You'd better stop talking right this minute." He hissed. A quagmire of emotions bubbled inside him. Denial, longing, shame, obstinacy, dismissal, and just the tiniest breath of appreciation. He didn't know whether Sherlock was being true to his word or was just miming something that he thought maybe John would want to hear in his moment of panic. The man was quite daft when it came to social cues, after all.
"He was face down in the water when we found him that morning. There was nothing we could have done." Miles' words as he finished speaking were solemn, but more contemplative than sad. Long ago having come to terms with the inevitability of it. He was spinning his mostly empty wine stem on the bar top between his fingertips, both men focused on the soft scrape of glass on glass as if it were a metaphor for something they couldn't explain. "I don't think I blame him, really. But I don't know if I would have had his courage y'know? Doing it like that. Choosing to end it in that way. I suppose he wasn't wrong, it's what he wanted, anyway. I mean, it was his life. His choice ultimately."
"Having a cigarette. Obviously." Sherlock said, taking a deep, indulgent drag and letting it out like it was the best thing he'd ever tasted.
The only thing that had remained exactly the same were his sky blue eyes, which had never lost their luster.
So when the endless dragging finally ceases and they come to the room at the end of the hall, he's overwhelmed with the thought that he's been brought directly to the massacre. And it doesn't even phase him.
"You, as a child, would have then witnessed the resultant discourse would have had upon your family and chosen very consciously to suppress any 'unnatural' feelings you might have had towards other men, choosing to burden yourself with becoming the quintessentially upstanding young man your father looked on you to be before your mother's death. In essence, Harry's coming out drove you to seek a medical profession and later to enlist in the Army in an effort to live up to expectations set upon yourself by you and your father combinedly."
It was of two men. Both of them handsome and regal. One man, the one with the strongly curved nose and plucked-back hair, stood slightly in the foreground with one hand on his hip and his gaze settled out as if looking over the room. His other arm was propped gently upon his companion's shoulder, the man with a softer countenance and a head full of iron gray hair. This second man was leaning back on a table to support them both and only had eyes for his partner.
When his body stopped curling, he was as small as he could get with his head buried between his knees and his face smashed into his hands, the muscles of his shoulders and arms rippled beneath his skin. On the verge of imploding. "I didn't get to say...anything. Not a fucking /thing/! I mean...Jesus!...I should have fucking been there /at least/ to save him. To say what I needed to before he went...he wasn't--I couldn't save...aw fuck! Sherlock." His name as John said it was barely more than a devastating cry, his hands reaching up to fist his own hair in desperation.
"So could it have jumped? Maybe didn't like the water? Do they even have the means to replicate ocean water nowadays? I suppose they do."
John continued when he could, but only just. "We were going to move in together when we came back. Find each other after our tours ended. It's stupid, isn't it? To plan. That's when it all gets cocked up. That was the last time I saw Bill. He was killed a week later." He sniffed harshly and crushed his eyes with the heels of his hands. If he couldn't stop himself from crying now, he was determined not to make it a spectacle.
Mycroft had simply put a stilling hand on his husband's thigh as Lord Gregory had made to rise and asked Sally to leave the room. Waiting stoically for Sherlock's tirade to end. Or at least for the young man to require another breath. "Why would you do this Mycroft?!" Sherlock had raved. "What could have possibly forced you to agree to this?"
"Someone went through an excessive amount of trouble to clothe these men, only to kill them. The time constraints force us to consider premeditation and thusly further confirms my previous theory that the killer is developing a pattern. One which is escalating quickly.
This command was given to William, for John saw from the corner of his eye the way William rose quickly and stepped outside the door.
John licked his lips. And then respun the string back on, making his final decision. "No," he spoke aloud to the empty flat. "If Sherlock wants me to know. He'll just have to tell me himself."
The bone-meeting-bone THWACK! of their skulls colliding permeate the room. A perfect hit right to his crown makes  Sherlock go instantly limp and John grunts at the sudden weight sliding through his arms. It's a near thing that he doesn't drop him completely, but is able to muster enough strength through the pain in his forehead to help ease his lover down.
Slightly relieved, John dismissed him and the creeping flush still crawling up his neck. "Okay. I'll see you after work then."
The tea tray is set on silent wheels and not a single utensil moves out of place as he comes towards John. It's set with bone china tea cups, a tea pot, stirring spoons, loose tea leaves, a tea strainer, and a pair of pliers.
While the DI talked, a man with a distraught face and large glasses could be seen edging his way in from the side of the screen. He seemed to hesitate briefly before sidling up alongside Lestrade, deciding he was the person to tell, and cupped his hand over his mouth to whisper something discreetly in his ear.
A third voice startled them both; Sherlock having silently poked his head out the door. "Given the abysmal state of your marriage, Inspector, I would ask that you refrain from deluging John with your biliary ignorance concerning relationships and focus solely on your police work.
"Oh was it now?" She asks with a bit of a laugh. She's intrigued by his anger. "Because I rather remember you trying to trick my dog with a decoy Mr. Holmes. You sacrificed an innocent man whose only purpose in life was to delay John Watson's death for just a little bit longer. Was it worth it? To find him here so close to dying anyway?"
He was dressed in a silken swath of dark gray and yellow that switched emphasis at his waist, a pair of fine white chausses, and pointed shoes that were adorned with large gray rosettes. The large black robe lined with fur that was fastened at his shoulders was long enough to cover his horse's croup.
"What do you enjoy, John Watson?" He asked seductively, dropping his voice into a rippling baritone and squeezing both hands into firm meat simultaneously.
so one more chapter of smut before I lower the boom on these lovesick fools. and if you'll notice, there' a definitive chapter count now so we're finally getting closer to the end. yay!
John scrambled to think of another title. Something else to call him by that would still show the respect he was to be afforded. "No . . . my Prince. I--"
The woman is short and a little stout, swathed in a light gold dress suit and standing perfectly prim before the curtain a few feet away. She's old, with curled white hair and a softly powdered face. But in her shoulders and demeanor she states that she is anything but fragile. Her crepe paper hands are clasped before her suit jacket and a string of pearls with a matching brooch lay against her lapels.
Instead, a prickly sort of feeling thrummed up the back of John's neck just as his eyes became locked with the penetrating gray gaze of a young man sitting at a booth in the front corner of the room, which placed him at John's rear left. His seat was offset enough to just show him at the very edge of the mirror, but his intense stare seemed to have taken up all the space in the room.
"There now. You see? She's never too far off." John smiled broadly as the little calf met her mother and immediately began to feed from her swollen udder. John reached out and patted the tenacious creature on its strong neck while she ignored him.
Not a single person walked the streets. No voices came from the houses. The doors and windows all remained shut.
Understanding, but not caring in the least, John took him by the lapel and pulled him down into a kiss to ease his anguish, making it count. He backed off after a little while, just as Sherlock had begun to want to make it heavier. It had seemed to work wonderfully for calming him down. He kept it in the back of his mind to use later. "God, your lips are freezing. Open." And when Sherlock begrudgingly obliged, John slid the thermometer beneath his tongue and tapped his jaw for him to close.
Sherlock was breathing loudly through his mouth now, temples crinkled beneath the forearm thrown over his eyes, only occasionally tipping up his neck to mark John's progress and he moved down, down, down.
"Uh," Sherlock stuttered a bit more and took it back down from his eye, blinking. He looked it over like it was brand new in his hands. Like it had never been in his possession at all. "It's, well, a ...looking glass, I suppose. I haven't named it. I just--It's meant to help me see things that are very far away."
"Yes. I got that much." John crossed his arms, licking his bottom lip. "What about the fish though? Some elaboration might be nice."
"Hm. I did not realize that a Captain was also fit to be a messenger as well?" Confused for a moment, John glanced down to see what Sherlock was looking at and then jumped to hand it to him. He'd forgotten the parcel was even there.
A viola da gamba was lying on its back in a red velvet lined case. Its lustrous body was roughly the size of John's torso and gleamed as bright as gold. At the very top of its neck, for a finial, the viol had the carved head of a basilisk. Appledore's sigil.
"I mean...fuck. And do you want to know the most twisted thing about it all? That day it happened, that was the /same/ day Bill was back in Afghanistan bleeding out from a bullet. The EXACT same day. It was almost like ...like we were connected or something and I could /feel/ him dying and it woke me up." His brain caught up to his mouth, his eyes realizing that he was still staring at that flat little bud of skin and suddenly his ears smouldered with embarrassment. Embarrassment at his fear. Embarrassment at his actions. Embarrassment at having spoken the words aloud now making them /real/. And Jesus if that idea didn't seem utterly RIDICULOUS in daylight.
"That's where the Lorazepam comes in." Sherlock interjected, his gory hands squelching as he put his palms together. "I believe it was administered to shut down all extraneous brain functions to put the victims on a sort of auto-pilot, just enough to make them motile. It tricked their brains into forgetting about the fact that they were dying. The murderer only requires his victim's to remain alive long enough to gift them a suit, lead them to the intended location, and then dispatch them before they can talk."
"But the killer's been caught." John found himself protesting, then immediately reprimanding himself.
"There's nothing further I can think of for us to do." Sherlock said with an upset breath. "We've no choice but to wait and observe. However loathsome that plan of inaction. That dealer had no information of any value, the club itself was a dead end, and tonight, overall, has been a waste of time." He grumbled. "I had Lestrade send us copies of all pertinent information regarding the two previous shoving victims and anything else they had on Sterling Sipe that may be of use to us. I'm missing something. I know it. I just don't know WHAT. It's aggravating."
"Indeed. From a very gifted individual." Something popped and sputtered in the pot and brother Michael went back to stirring, dipping the little finger of his other hand in and giving it another taste. "You swore your knighthood these seven and twenty days past, is that right?"
And his mind begins to spiral anew. Dark thoughts of helplessness and hopelessness bubbling up like choking oil. He's broken again. He's damaged...
John was so struck by the strangeness of the question that he stayed there. Unsure whether or not he should answer.
That done, he stands and stoops, lifting John by his chest and is careful to keep his broken right arm cradled in his hand, bringing it up with them and pausing every time John lets out a distressed noise. By the time John's standing, his legs are watery enough that he has to use Sherlock as his main support.
John remembered what Sherlock had said about the peculiar smell of the Mr. Jones' suit and subtly leaned over the table for a cautious whiff, drawing back with no more insight than he had had before, though curled his lip slightly at the sickly barbeque smell he inhaled instead.
After a frantic smattering of chords, Sherlock's bow drew a high trill on the upstroke and he pulled the instrument pieces away from each other as if they would melt together if they touched for too long. His nostrils dilated minutely, his shoulders rising and falling with breath. Sweat appearing on his temple.
John and Lestrade both responded at the same time with completely opposite responses, confusing their words and leaving Molly caught wanting between their two explanations. She turned more to John to speak next.
John's motionlessness spurred Sherlock to explain further with an exasperated sigh. "You have my word that it's well acclimated to people, John. It came from a family farm to be sold at the Covent Garden Market for Christmas. It needs fed. Before you run off and abandon me."
Sherlock slyly maneuvers his thigh to strategically be a pressure point for John's lightly rutting hips and the crest of the building tension pulls John back from the freefall.
"I would have never considered orgasmic wailing to be any sort of an enhancement to a song. And it seems my point has just been proven." Came a dark rumble and John was not in the least bit surprised somehow to see Sherlock standing in the doorway to the office he'd /locked/ an hour ago. Hands behind his back. "That was hideous."
"Still up for some coffee?" Asked John, turning back to the worktop in time with the swoop in his stomach. He heard Sherlock give a noise in agreement and slide into his chair, the distinctive snapping of a slide being replaced on the microscope's stand.
Directly under the windows and to the side of an oak armchair, stood a tall candlestick that was obviously Sherlock's most frequent companion during the night, for there was an absolute mountain of dripped and hardened wax cementing the entire stick into place.
She made to swat him playfully on the arm, but took one look at his red raw nose and extra baggy eyes and reconsidered. "Oh love. You look terrible. Have you been here all night?"
But John just found himself blinking, his mind catching up slowly before his mouth moved. "Uh, no." His contradiction seemed to surprise them both in equal measure. "No in fact."
What he saw first was the squad car lights ricocheting against the buildings and as he sidled up to the barrier tape there were a handful of people huddled together, gesturing in hoary clouds of emphatic breath. Met officers scratched at their notepads, taking eye witness accounts and trying to piece together what had actually happened.
He lapsed back into the time he had spent floating idle in the supermarket, having stood in the crisps aisle deciding why he felt the way he did, fighting the panic of having left Sherlock alone in the flat, and what he was going to say to him once he saw him again. "Sherlock?" John began after clearing his throat.
Sherlock sighed again, almost a growl, while they all shifted against his genius like barley in a breeze. "Why must you always insist on never seeing what is NOT HERE! Where's his coat? Nobody in there right mind would come out in this weather dressed as insufficiently as this. Not if they were being driven. And there's the lack of money, identification, and Oyster card in any of his pockets. So, again, /missing/ evidence that CLEARLY means something to us. What his mode of transportation was.
The filmy, earl gray warmth of dawn was creeping into the windows of Baker Street now. Telling John that he had slept soundly throughout the entire night. A rare occurrence anymore.
Anderson gaped in insult, before turning to Lestrade. "I don't know how they got here before you did sir. I didn't notify him!" His drawn face screwed up in irritation as he turned back to Sherlock. "I didn't text /you/! You're not suppose to be here. How did you even know to come here?"
"Upon my investigations, I inadvertently revealed Victor Senior to be a fraud who'd passed his son on an entirely false name, an embezzled fortune upon which his father had built the Trevor dynasty, and revealed Victor Senior as number seven on Interpol's fugitives list. Needless to say, I exposed the secrets that existed to send my friend into financial and emotional ruin." He said all this through a mouth that fell, when closed, into a line so sharp it rivaled his violin's strings.
"Ah. Ordered out for breakfast eh?" John joked, slightly wary as to its possible contents, while Sherlock ignored him and snapped on some nitrile gloves. Seeming to be completely oblivious to the chill in the room.
John gave him some time, but decided it would do neither of them any good to spend the rest of their afternoon like this. So cautiously, John turned to him and put out a hand to grasp Sherlock's bicep. He let it slide down slowly over his elbow, over the silken fabric of his gown, trying to convey in his touch that he wanted to give comfort and would like Sherlock to come back to him.
John let the air punch out of him, sweeping right past the shock and hurtling straight on to honest curiosity, tinged with a bit of incredulity. "How do you know I only got on with blokes in Afghanistan?"
His sister had been his estate agent. A hackneyed try at her fourth consecutive interest when she could never keep away from the booze long enough to make it a vocation. Before this it had been unsuccessfully running a sweets shop that had closed down six months after it'd opened. Two years after her marriage. Her wife's final gift before divorcing his sister had been paying off her debt and suggesting real estate instead. All the best, well wishes, I can't watch you disappear.
"The ambulance called...said they were just pulling up to the lift. Should be here any second. Would anyone fancy some coffee? I can make a run--" but down the hall the lift doors pinged and two paramedics wheeled in a gurney with a corpse zipped into a black body bag. "That was quick."
"Yes sir, that's right. If you'll just follow me." There was a hushed conversation behind him as he led the man and his two companions upstairs, directing them to one of their chairs.
Charles smirked. Pleased to have peeked his interest. "You will have to wait and see . . . but first, you must be prepared." Charles moved back to the chamber door and opened it wide, revealing two servants carrying a large half barrel bath between them. Standing in a queue behind them was a line of ten more servants, all hefting two full buckets filled with steaming water. All ten servants were panting heavily, having had to run up all 17o steps from the kitchen on the main floor to bring him water that had started its journey boiling.
He wished he could be more proactive. Return the favor. Wanting to run his hand down the smooth of flesh of Sherlock's back while Sherlock sucked him. Wanting to participate.
Sherlock flipped the biscuit in his tongue and pulled it into his mouth, chewing around his words and the only wafer he actually managed to fully swallow. John did notice. "Only because it gives me the opportunity to solve a locked room mystery from a continent away." He said coyly and John replied with a more confused face. "Unless, that is, you happened to buy two round-trip tickets to Tokyo from Tesco while you were out. No? Hm. Didn't think so.
This last bit had sobered Sherlock. No longer was he beaming in triumph at the idiocy of his brother, instead he was listening closely. Staring at John like he was something to be understood.
John shifted lower in his seat, wiping back the comforter to let his own erection bob free in the tent of his boxers. Wanton. Allowing Sherlock to see what he was doing to him. He found himself panting, part from increased blood flow and part asphyxiating congestion. Witnessing the moment Sherlock's eyes caught fire, his mouth falling open to mirror him, but it was the Stradivarius that moaned.
And without a thought, without focus, without HIM, John's body moved. Working a tight and frantic rhythm between those two glorious hands. His hips thumped against the vanity, his eyes threatening to close as his moans vibrated with ardour.
It started as all other days in this hellish prison had. The quiet knock. The screaming bolt. And the absolute revulsion when the High Stewards' gaunt form slithered in first.
John had insisted on it all the more and sent her away to begin the paperwork immediately. Making her buy it before someone else did.
John was only vaguely aware that they had just come to a cursory agreement on...whatever it was they were  to partake in. Did it have a name? Friends with benefits? Partners? What had he just been thinking about?
His world funneled down into that tenacious heel of hand pressing firmly into the mottled mess of his left subscapularis tendon. Over the puckering, starburst scar that lie just beneath his clavicle, where all his ghosts took shelter.
It wasn't until what looked to be his final days that the miracle came from an unlikely place. It had been brother Michael, the high priest of  Castle Appledore, who had been called in to absolve Sherlock for death. And was instead the one to make him live again.
He tightened his grip and stroked himself deftly, putting his teeth into his bottom lip to dam back any other sort of incriminating noises he might make as he imagined Sherlock penetrating him from the other side. His whipcord body pressed in close. His long thin cock sinking deep into John's body, probing farther than he'd ever been previously explored.
"Come on. It had to have crossed your mind at some point. I assume you would have had some experience while on leave to visit brothels in the area during your tours."
"I knew of your plan to go to them the moment you met me at St. Bart's. I knew of your plan before /you/ had even thought of it, I'd wager. But you were generous and you gave me an entire week. So for that I thank you. I thank you and I'm sorry it had to end like this."
"By the final stage you will become incontinent, unable to swallow, unable to sit, and generally become unresponsive to your own surroundings. You will - in essence - become a disease-ridden shell of the person you were and there is NOTHING you can do to stop it.
"We have to leave now John." Sherlock says. He's looking around the empty hallway, almost as though he's expecting company at any time. "But you'll have to walk. Ambulances can't be seen anywhere near this property, they'll raise too many questions with the press. There's a car waiting for us in the underground car park, but we just need to get there. Can you walk?"
His hands took no pause as they sank down towards their prize, the ribbon coming with it still looped about his neck as he never took it off. His hands were practically trembling with delight as they touched the cock cage cupped around Sherlock's groin.
Maybe Sherlock just took longer to get worked up, which was fine. It took him ages to realize his body was screaming for sustenance and rest after all, so what was one more denial? Nothing to worry about. They were on a case, after all. He'd made that point very clear. Don't confuse assumptions with facts. That was the number one rule.
The sound Sherlock made was a thick cracking groan of realization, as if he HAD forgotten. His arms meaning to release, but unable, sure that he would be left unbalanced and go toppling from the chair should he let go, he pushed his arse out to make room. "Take it out. Please John take it out. Ah!" Sherlock spoke through gritted teeth, fingers kneading harshly into John's shoulders, anchoring his awkward crouch.
"No." Sherlock flushed pink with embarrassment. Caught out. Taking a steeling breath he stood up straight, looking John directly into the eyes. "John I--, I feel that this would be an opportune time to... I believe I have come to the conclusion that there are certain aspects of my life that I would like to share with you in an effort strengthen our relationship so that we may take things forward. I encourage your own input as well. I am interested to know whatever it is you wish to tell me. And clearly, I mean those facts that are not readily available for me to deduce. That is, if you're not too fatigued."
Never being a fan of sugar in his tea, he pursed his lips and calculated his options. If he poured it out in the sink, Sherlock would know. Even if he aimed specifically for the drain holes, somehow that only made it seem like he'd find out for sure, as he probably had it rigged or something. If he poured it down the drain then proceeded to wash the dishes over the top of it, Sherlock would know, because the sink wasn't /nearly/ full enough to spur an impromptu dish-washing session from either of them and even John knew that. And suppose Sherlock was still in the flat? (It was still piping hot, so there was a very good chance.) He would hear it, he would know what was happening, he might confront John about it and then John would feel like a complete arse.
"The Queen Mother's health began declining soon after she made her last public appearance. A few weeks later she developed a chest infection and a bad cough which she found hard to throw off. She became increasingly frail and soon was confined to a wheelchair. The funeral arrangements have not yet been announced, but the service is expected to be held at Westminster Abbey after a lying in state at--."
He was soaked to the bone, but did not want to remove his boots in fear that he wouldn't be able to put them back on. The small fire he'd made sputtered and hissed as rain made its way through the branches.
"Since you're not going to ask, I should tell you that I won. Well, the hand that we actually finished. Not cash, but..."
As he knew it would, saying this rouses Sherlock enough for him to shift over and create a perfectly-sized hole with his curled body to accommodate John sitting on the bed. John does so and waits until Sherlock squirms close enough to be pressed fully against him.
"Yes," he wanted to be past this now, a dark feeling was starting to twist around inside him, one that told him he might have just done something 'not good'. And he scrambled to make it okay. "But I've spent years building up an immunity to the effects of it, at least until the source of that particular inquiry ran dry to me and I gave up the pursuit. But I assure you that my methods are exact. I'll feel no side-effects from it. You see," he put his arms out for display, "I'm perfectly fine."
translated it means 'the elixir of love'. I feel this song in my bones when I listen to it. hopefully you will too.
"Oh, that's so nice of him. I didn't know it was you birthday. You should have told me! I'd have baked you something."
John, blinked, then blinked again, and in that moment of John realizing what he had just confessed, Sherlock gained intimate knowledge at just how quickly discomfiture could overtake a man's face.
He gasped a little gasp as Sherlock divested himself of his bottoms and gown in a calculated flurry before climbing straight into the chair with him. He'd been pantsless, his cock parallel to his lean belly. He wrenched John's own boxers down by sheer force, nearly ripping them in his haste and John could do nothing but scramble to make room and get his knees tangled in his underwear. Sherlock's feet took purchase between the seat cushion and armrests,  essentially pinning John into place.
He grew dangerously thin during this time, able to feel the edges of his bones with greater clarity every time the physician's assistants came to turn him and his hands slipped uselessly against his body.
John nearly choked mid bite, suddenly insulted. "I--*cough* Listen, Sherlock. I have never had a problem getting a leg over and I certainly have never sulked about it out loud. Besides, Sarah and I hadn't even--no. Stop." He realized what he was unconsciously revealing and halted. "This isn't the place for this conversation. In fact, I'm not even having this conversation. Let's go back to where I'm eating and you've apologized and neither of us are talking about any of this. I don't need to discuss my love life with you."
He turned back to the enraptured detective, who was peeling open the corpses eyes, revealing the starburst cataracts that had formed as the result of being fried. "So, what's your secret to putting up with him for this long Greg?"
He cradled his face in his hands, staring at the wall between his fingers while his mind shifted and dredged up that impassioned kiss they'd shared in the kitchen. The exultant high of a body pressed close against his and then the immediate plummet of seeing Sherlock's untented pyjama bottoms.
His chest and neck were draped with the same thousand pearl collar he had worn the day before and his powdered, coaled, and rouge-painted face looked somber but not displeased.
"Yes. Home. I can hold onto this one while we walk," Sherlock assures him, gingerly touching his right arm, "but I'll have to tie up the other one. Hold on." Judiciously, he's whipping off his scarf and tying the ends together to create a loop, infinitely careful as he slides it over John's neck and maneuvers his relocated arm into the makeshift sling.
Charles' face, while not ugly, was absolutely monstrous in its conviction. "You fill me with such desire. Don't you see? To see you happy is my only pursuit. You must know this." His words were sweet, if only to mask their venom. Sherlock thought briefly of tearing off that lingering finger with his teeth and Charles smirked as he saw it too. "You have a strong will. One of the many reasons why I find you so irresistible. But my patience and my persistence is stronger yet. And soon you will see that there is no denying this."
"M'fine." Like being overcome by the ocean, John suddenly remembered all that had transpired last night. Able to map the lingering soreness in each of his muscles to what had occurred; the shoulder molestation, the rimming, Bill and the heartache and the promises he was instructed to make but could never quite say. He smiled wistfully. "You do know you can't exactly fuck the guilt out of someone yeah?" He felt the octopus crush of Sherlock's limbs squeeze tighter around him in response. A long thigh throw itself up across his hip. A huff of laughter against his hairline.
"No I--" John began, but could not finish. The hurt of it was still too fresh. A wound still lurking beneath the first cover of scab. "No."
"Ooookay. I have no idea what any of that means." John gave it up for the moment. "Well, I can put some lidocaine cream on this if it's hurting, there's some in here. Sherlock? Oi! Ground control to major Holmes, do you copy? Are you in pain? And don't just write it off as some inconvenience of your /transport/. You need to tell me if it is." He squeezed his shoulder, drawing him back.
Without him noticing, Sherlock had stood from the bed and crowded John back until they were out into the sitting room, walking him all the way through the kitchen until the backs of his knees hit the seat of Sherlock's chair and made him sit with a whump.
He managed to towel off and make it upstairs wrapped in his robe. Even managed to change into a fresh vest and boxers, slip into his cool sheets, lay his head down on his crisp white pillow, and feign sleep for approximately 3.56 seconds before he simply couldn't /take it/.
John did his best to keep his composure as the trio made their way up the long, spiraling staircase.
"Rubbish, he wanted the fish. That was his prize. No, it was something else. His house has all the latest security monitoring available, along with armed guards at the front gate. There was nobody reported entering or leaving the residence the night it disappeared. Mr. Asano, a light sleeper, was the only occupant and claims to have heard nothing at all that caused a disturbance." Sherlock explained.
The sound of John's metal gauntlet against the soft wood of the door seemed like a thunder stroke in the silence. The pins in the hinges groaning terribly as the heavy door swung back and John took the last breath he would ever take of his old life as he stepped inside the room.
Charles released his finger immediately, letting Sherlock's hand slide from his. It thumped deadweight against Sherlock's thigh.
John sat back finally, unable to garner anything more. When he spoke on his confusing findings aloud, he was met with the most minimal of hums. A small flick of his eyes had him following the sea glass gaze which was looking back up to the bridge.
John faintly remembered the grinding pain he'd endured for four hours as the indelible ink had been etched into his own arm with his tattoo. The married emblems of the Fusiliers and RAMC that he'd asked Harry to design for him before he'd left to Afghanistan. At the two-hour mark his endorphins had been depleted and he'd had to sit through the rest calmly gritting his teeth as his arm was turned to hamburger.
Having caught and eaten its meal, the octopus began to head back the way it had come. Slipping through the lid and traveling slowly back down into its own tank, disappearing like a thief in the night.
He scratched the back of his neck and wondered what they would do now. Maybe he'd get lucky and Sherlock would spend the majority of his time sulking in his room until another case cropped up. John was loath to admit it, but perhaps it'd do them both a favor.
holy crap lovelies! do you even remember what's going on? cause I don't. but set your phasers to finished anyway!!
With his knuckles blanched white, John pressed backward and reveled in the feeling of Sherlock's perfectly tight hand sliding back up his cock to its glans and those ridiculously long and knobbled fingers sinking back into his arse. John's jaw was lost to the ground by now and it was a miracle he wasn't drooling.
"You do." He smiled. He reached up and cupped the side of Sherlock's face, pleased when he felt Sherlock lean into it. "You disappear in there. But I don't blame you. If I was trapped up here all alone, I would have gone mad a long time ago."
The man presumably called Caddyshack was bear hugging John's side, practically climbing on top of him. He was wearing only a pair of very short blue shorts and aviator sunglasses. Caddyshack was taller and skinnier than John, handsome with a prominent mustache.
"Obstructing what? Where's your evidence? Did you know we were obstructing something John? We can get out of the way of the door, if that's what you're implying."
Three massive but delicately spindled chandeliers drooped heavily from the vaulted ceiling. Their many candled arms throwing out golden throbs of light that while luminous in their own right were nothing compared to the gargarntuesque fireplace that roared with an inferno to John's left.
"You could always get naked and get in here with me." Sherlock suggested and then had the audacity to raise a suggestive eyebrow. "Skin-to-skin contact /would/ be the most efficient way to get me warmed back up."
"Well, that's it for me then." John shut the laptop lid pointedly. His mind running on fumes and wanting to avoid another row.
Little did the quaint men from Umberland of the North know that they would not have wait long to see it in use.
Splitting the apple with his horse, John lowered his mouth into the water and took large frigid gulps that quenched him utterly.
John swallowed the brittle lump on the rise in his throat and looked pointedly over to Molly, /praying/ that she too hadn't seen. But luckily Molly was standing with her back turned to the scrub room, busy calibrating the hanging scale pan up on her tiptoes, completely oblivious to it all. She had donned all the gear necessary to continue the autopsy internally. The large, black smock contrasting almost comically with her khaki trousers, thick-soled white trainers, and polka dot socks.
It had been SO long since someone else had touched him in this way. His prick so much ignored, even by his own hand, that he'd hardly had a wank that he could describe as anything more than desultory since he'd come home. Languishing in hospital once the virus had cleared his bloodstream, ravished by fever, he had wallowed in the vast depths of his brokenness and isolation.
John felt a great swath of affection overcome him as he looked across and smiled warmly at his partner, letting his hand linger just a little bit too long on Sherlock's as he took it. Sherlock cleared his throat pointedly and nodded back towards the corpse, clearly affected but obviously saving it for later.
"In a way." John slid his half-full glass onto the counter, letting the full understanding settle into his dignity. "Makes me sound like a bit of a coward doesn't it?"
"The Americans had quite a scare of it in the beef industry a while back, when it was discovered that they were feeding their cows their own dead. Still not ringing any bells? Hm? Then perhaps you're more familiar with it being called Cruetzfeld-Jakobs?"
"Noooooo, Sherlock. That was the least tactful I've seen you do yet, which is saying something. Now, don't get me wrong, that was at the same time absolutely bloody fucking amazing! But no, 'tactful' doesn't even come close to describing what you just did back there." He stabbed a thumb over his shoulder, like what they were retreating from was wreckage.
Sherlock still ignored him, instead he opened the little book to the front page and scrawled something quickly into it with pointed flicks of his wrist, ensuring that it would be the first thing John read whenever the little book was opened. "After much deliberation on the matter, you really should consider beginning a new list John." He said to him finally, turning the book towards John and showing him that he had written: 'Sherlock Holmes - January 29th 2010'.
"Not avoiding." Sherlock mumbles, before turning over and clearly /avoiding/. "I take it she's dead then?"
The water was so crystal clear, it made John want to jump into it and drink enough to parch his dry soul.
Mrs. Hudson smiled kindly, setting it down on top, then held up a finger and dug into her deep house coat pocket. "Oo! Almost forgot! Here's that baby food you asked about Sherlock. You didn't specify on a flavor, so I got you corn puree and oh, what's this," she squinted hard at the label on a jar that looked ambiguously purple, "spaghetti. Hope that'll do."
"Oh, I was SO worried!" Mrs. Hudson frets, her eyeliner already beginning to run. "My boys. I'll never be able to let you out of my sight again! Look at the state of you."
Nervous people began to speak of spies as they crouched over their tallow candles in the dark and ate their pottage. Serfs far out in the fields, breaking their backs, talked of lies and deceit and wagging tongues. Old maids with herb-stained fingers spoke of witchcraft.
"Don't lie John. We both know you couldn't do it to save your life," Sherlock pointed out, "and even if you could, it's an aspect of my life that vexes you very much and has for some time now. You don't know anything about any relationship I've ever had and yet you have never attempted to ask. Why?"
He is dressed in his coat and his scarf. Sporting a great purple bruise in the center of his forehead that's bled down into his eye and turned his socket dark. His eye seems to glow all the more brightly for it.
John turned back at the sound of his crisps dropping and fished them out, before heading back to his office, just expecting Sherlock to follow. He turned off the radio completely while Sherlock surveyed his office with a wandering eye, inspecting everything in the manner that was over in a matter of seconds.
After a long while, John finally met eyes with him. His gaunt face pale in the firelight. "But, who'd want me for a Captain?"
"I would, but it's important." Sherlock said softly. His voice a deep rumble with trace amounts of hesitation.
John searched his brain. "It's used as a sedative and I think an amnesic for people who have anxiety, to help calm them down. It makes them forget that they're getting a procedure done. But I'm not totally sure. I never prescribed it." He paused, frowning. "So does this mean that the night bus pusher is looking more like a dentist then?"
Caddyshack's right leg was hitched up with John's help and held tight across John's hips. His face smashed against John's cheek hard enough to bend his glasses askew as his lips were puckered enthusiastically to plant a crushing kiss onto the doctor's temple. An act that had produced a fool hearty smile on the young Captain Watson.
While Sherlock feigned passing interest with a shrug, John could tell he was taking a mental photograph of it with his very particular squint before he returned to his seat and said nothing more. There was the sound of the door opening and closing and Dr. Sipe stretched the loops of his paper mask across his face. "Alright then, we're ready to begin if you're ready Dr. Watson? Good man. Let's begin."
"Everyone gives off unique pheromones, body odor, excretions from the skin, that sort of thing. But the man's scent and the one on his clothes were mismatched. It usually takes about a day and a half to fully saturate the fabric with a distinct odor, the only variable being what's being done in the clothes while the person wears it. Exertion would let it saturate more quickly as opposed to inactivity."
He felt loved and alive when he'd forever thought that he never would be again. And it was truly terrifying.
It was then, at the end of it all, as he felt his paradigm shift, that John's fingers finally slipped loose and Figure A. (page thirty-five) of the bifurcated human heart suffered pericardial effusion at the hands of milk and black tea.
John quickly singled out a woman slumped boneless in the back of an ambulance, buried under a blanket, sobbing openly into her hands. He recognized the other woman with the wiry hair standing next to her, and offered a small smile when Sergeant Sally Donovan met his gaze. Not at all surprised when she rudely brushed him off and turned back to the weepy woman, muttering something with a vexed air into her radio.
"Well?" Sherlock asked after a moment, looking positively maniacal as dark shadows cut harsh lines into his face. "Tell me what you see."
He stopped dead again, arms screaming, sweat beading his forehead with strain and heat and sickness and FOCUS. Needing Sherlock to see. To hear him.
Sherlock's breath hissed in and out through his nostrils, curls dancing as he fought to find his voice again as John swept his finger pads against his inner walls with renewed fervour. Sherlock's legs were shivering with strain, his mouth cracking open and stretching a single silver thread of saliva between two impossible lips. He gnashed his teeth together as John began finally to slowly lower him.
"Yes. Yes." Sherlock answered curtly, preoccupied with pulling out a twelve inch chef's knife and repositioning the brain to his liking.
"Your Majesty." John greeted into the stilted silence. "I have come to serve you and his Highness, Prince Sherlock. At your behest."
By July he would have this furlong bristling with barley for the winter crop. And for the first full year since he had worked it, a larger portion of his harvest would be his. Now that he was a freeman. No longer a serf to the Lord of the Manor. No longer a slave to be encumbered with taxes and tithes so steep they broke his soul as much as the work broke his back. He was now a master of the lands and the home he kept.
"Y'know when the bottom of your rubbish sack falls out 'cause it's wet and too heavy?" Lestrade grimaced. "He sort of /came apart/ in the same fashion."
One turquoise eyeball peaks out from over the sheet's edge. "We are." Sherlock pouts. "I'm staying here with the witness and you're going to go investigate the crime scene. Thus utilizing our strength in numbers."
"Through the foramen magnum...amazing." John suddenly said, the muddled lens of evidence wiped suddenly clear to him. When his eyes flashed up to Sherlock's, he was gracing him with a gorgeous close-mouthed grin.
"I did." Sherlock breathed, confused by the utter adoration that had overtaken John with such a simple tool. Did peasants not know of--?
Lestrade barked a laugh. "Nah. He just sort of, /showed up/. Wouldn't tell me how he knew, but I didn't pry too deep. Seems to be in a bit of a strop as much as I can tell. Well, more than usual anyway." He cast a sideways glance to John. "Bit late for shopping in'nit?"
The bulbous head and rolling, pulling tentacles outlined an octopus making its way across the top tier of tanks. Momentarily pausing at each aquarium, bundling itself and seemingly stopping to check that each lid was securely fastened.
"I believe he's allowing you to do so, yes." Mycroft said and that stopped John's thoughts in their tracks momentarily. Mycroft continued. "When you first met him, my brother had been engaging in, shall we say, suicidal proclivities. He did not sleep and rarely ate, conscientiously choosing to put himself in harm's way whenever possible. You are aware now that his pension for this behavior has only subsided since your moving in together, but it has not stopped entirely."
"Well?" Prince Sherlock asked, his voice taking on the tilt of the weary. "Aren't you bored of being down there already? It must be murder on your knees."
He squatted low, holding a piece out on the tips of his long fingers, trying to get it to come closer. This had been an ongoing experiment.
Sherlock cradled the back of John's skull so softly in his long, thin fingers that it could have been a cut diamond suspended in the tines of a ring, but, incidentally, it was for the sake of efficiency; allowing Sherlock to position their heads in the exact counterpoint to have their salient noses slide right past each other's and strike home. Which in itself was quite impressive.
He tugged at the hem of his jacket to cover himself, took a loud breath, and poked his head out the door to check that the coast was clear. Before immediately freezing in place.
"We were in formation; Murray and I had the prisoner between us, this kid, a nineteen-year-old Lance Corporal flanked us. And the two others were ahead, scouting for IEDs. Just...normal stuff."
Roaming up towards the neck, John found that the neck aberrations that he'd been so intrigued with on the head's flesh corresponded exactly with the torso's. Smooth single cut around the throat, only to turn jagged at the nape. These were definitely two parts of the same man.
"Mycroft." John said darkly, glancing up at the glowing windows of 221B before sliding into the opposite seat.
He looked as though a boulder of burden had been lifted from his shoulders. He was bright eyed and well-rested. Not at all the bedraggled and mudcaked thing that had shuffled into his chamber yesterday. He was a new man that shone so bright and so true that he rivaled the morning sun in its beauty.
"Right. So you're content with this." He waved a hand, gesturing between the two of them. "So friendship is all you need? Nothing at all would make you happier than this?" He put his hands up at Sherlock's twisting face. "No. It's fine. If that's what you want. It's just that I'm willing to, y'know, if you ever change your mind. I'm willing to ...to wingman for you if you'd like."
True to its nature, in the white hot panic of the moment, John's mind went utterly calm. He forced Sherlock's bum back to sit at the top of his thighs, taking him by the scruff of his neck and drawing him down against his shoulder instead, despite Sherlock's desperate whine. He bent the tall man awkwardly in half and held him there.
John spoke of his life until the water went cold, giving every detail he could manage to remember and leaving no subject untouched save for one; William.
There it was, right when he'd dropped his defenses. John tensed minutely. "Y-yes but--" He made to turn, to face his accuser directly, but Sherlock had crowded in, effectively trapping him in.
Sherlock felt one of his fingers dip into the soft wetness of Charles' mouth and shut his eyes. Feeling like a bag of wretched bones. Sifting through it to find what was left of his resolve.
John was relatively small in stature, though his decorated military career had taught him how to grow to easily fill a room if he need be. He was solid and strong, with a short cap of gray blonde hair and a knee-hammer face. Unassumingly handsome with the deep, fathomless eyes of an old soul who'd lived a million lifetimes and was waiting to see a million more.
"Look here. S'alright." John hooked his finger and rubbed his knuckle gently across a rosy, mountainous cheekbone, striving to keep his hardened gaze. "It's alright to not want it. If you never want to have sex, we don't have to."
The radio was turned down low. Advertisements burbling nonsensically as John finished up his patients' notes in the quiet sanctuary of his office. Nothing but the calm scribble of indelible words and the intermittent hum of the heater coming on.
"Oh, yes! Any of the non-orchestral ones; those ones are Sherlock's." She raised her hand and dropped her voice into a good natured stage whisper with a wink. "Good for nodding off to, but not my usual cup of tea. I prefer the newer stuff." She stared at them adoringly as if they were children she hadn't seen for a long while. "Oh, I bought these back in Florida. Frank loved them. We use to sit on the floor and listen to them for hours. I remember we had a whole wall of them." She smiled nostalgically. "These are the only ones that came back with me after he was executed."
It felt good, to be testing out the boundaries of this new relationship. And it gave him hopes as to what might be allowed between them when they were seen out together now. Obviously Sherlock wasn't embarrassed by semi-public kissing, given how he'd practically /climbed/ into John's mouth at the morgue. Though that had been only for a small audience and for admittedly practical purposes. Would he show the same affection around others now that they were together? How were they expected to act at crime scenes? The Work came first, of course. So perhaps it would be best to let Sherlock make the first move...
"You seem to think pretty highly of yourself." John said pointedly, teacup still held aloft. Of course, it was all true. But he wasn't going to tell him that. "You told me you were married to your work."
He set the coffee down at Sherlock's elbow, pre-mixed with sugar and milk, and allowed his curiosity to overtake his caution. If Sherlock hadn't blurted out something by now, either he wasn't in the mood to talk about it, or he didn't find it important enough. Regardless, John was relieved.
"It's been a long while since you played, I take it?" John asked, having guessed by the  amount of dust that had been gathered on the parchments he had shifted.
The last prospective folder had been the one to keep his attention. The landscape paralleled how he looked (how he felt) scarred and isolated with its soft stone cliffs slowly eroding through time and weather. As if one day he might be able to look out his window and topple off the edge of the world. Fairly certain he'd let the ocean just take him.
John was a man of facts and figures, as much as Sherlock was. Able to line things up in a row and tackle them one by one. His military medical training had taught him the delicate, merciless art of triage and he decided to take the simplest task at hand and apply himself to it, with whatever energy he had left. Give himself a break and tackle something inherently simple.
"Well," John sighed, the brevity in Sherlock's voice told him that the Prince had thought long and hard about his circumstances and had seen his way through every possible result. And he also knew that if a man this smart had had the opportunity to escape, he would have. Prince Sherlock did not need some lowly knight to rescue him. "I wouldn't be able to bear those outcomes either."
"I could carry you, if you wanted." Sherlock offers into the hesitant silence and the comment is just arrogant enough to get a snort out of John.
"Oh." John let that sink in, unconsciously looking back down to the docile penis and pondering what that meant as if it might explain the issue itself. If there was an underlying medical condition going on, surely Sherlock would choose /now/ of all times to bring it up? But as he waited for it to come, nothing did. Maybe there was something psychologically wrong. Maybe something he didn't want to discuss...something he wasn't willing to initiate. He looked pretty damn tense.
"Yeah, alright," Miles accepted easily. "Hey. Thanks for letting a barmy bugger spoil your night. You were a big help."
Sherlock's head nearly spun on his neck to look over at him. "Tact! What are you talking about? I was incredibly tactful."
Sherlock welcomed the tangent easily. "It's to test my theory on the longevity of electrolytes after death. Although, it would be preferable to use a brain at the exact moment of death." He produced a small LED on a solderless puck and connected one end to his crude circuitry. "But this is going to have to suffice."
John made a pitiful sound, forcing himself to continue. "He's the one who saved me. When I was shot." John bit at his lower lip before it could tremble and pulled stiffly at the hot, sucking sensation of tears in his eyes.
Sherlock scoffed and moved past him towards the window. "And yet you're addressing me formally once more, though we agreed that such pleasantries were unnecessary. Something has changed..."
Last night was the first night since coming back from Afghanistan that anyone had seen him shirtless. John, himself, didn't dwell much on his own torso nowadays. He avoided looking at it in the mirror as much as he could, dressing perfunctorily for his day and went on with his life like it wasn't even there at all.
It's Sherlock's keen eyes that allow them to find the seam in the wall where no one else would have thought to look.
Mycroft studied him with a thin lipped bearing, still Holmesian unreadable. "I don't know." He eventually replied, but whether it was meant as an insult or a conundrum, John didn't know. Mycroft went on. "Although, it might interest you to know that he did not even ask about your own medical records. I daresay he thinks you'll simply tell him anything important."
"So this vic we're about to see was found at Russell Square tube station just around two forty this morning by a maintenance worker. He was dead when they found him." The unmistakable smell of acrid dead flesh met them like a wall as they came within closer vicinity of the post-mortem wing, yet none of them seemed to notice.
Sherlock, feeling him fidget with discomfort, wrapped his arms more tightly around John's torso. Nearly impeding his breathing.
The susurrus of his fine clothing indicated that he had bowed, before moving towards the door. He paused with one spidery hand curled around the wood however, "but be aware that I will require Sir John when you are finished with him. Be gentle with him for now. It has been a long while since you have had a guest and I find it regrettable that your brother should wish to bring you something so damaged."
Spying something, Sherlock bent down and plucked up the picture of John and Bill that had been lost to the floor sometime last night, laying both it and the book gently onto his bedside table with incredible reverence.
Strewn haphazardly around the table tops was an array of different skulls, the vast majority belonging to large and small animals, except for one in particular, which lay close to the candlestick. It was a human skull which rested on the pedestal of Sherlock's upside-down crown.
"Yes. Sorry. I saw the lights while I was walking home and thought I might be of help. I'm a doctor." He craned his neck and stood on tiptoes, his heart skipping a beat when he finally clapped eyes on the wraith-like figure standing in his signature Belstaff coat off in the distance. The Consulting Detective all ready for his close up. Still managing to put off a six foot swath of attitude despite being buried in heavy wool.
John rolled his eyes. "I'm going to Tesco with Mrs. Hudson for the shopping before I have to go to work. Do you--" but there was already a piece of paper thrust into his face and a ferociously large grin behind it. John took it and gave it a cursory glance over, immediately disregarding the obviously impossible requests. "Sherlock. I'm pretty sure they don't sell hydrochloric acid at the supermarket."
"Oh?" A gathered rivulet of sweat took that moment to escape the sheen from across John's brow to track down his temple. "Not good?"
He dreamt about the particular time when those melancholy promises had travelled out across the baked air, when Bill had leaned in close and translated everything that was being said as dirty whispers in John's ear. Replacing Allah's name with John's own like an American heathen. Defaming the beautiful words:
Like a shot, it took off! Threading through the tight gnarl of branches with keen precision. Piercing its way through the thick blanket of fog like a needle through wool.
He gave Sherlock one single nod and worked hard to fall limp in his hands. He'd only ever trusted one other person so completely before and now he knew for certain that he never would again. For it would be the death of him.
In a brief dance of movement, he consumed the scene with a quick shuffle of his eyes. Cataloguing, referencing, absorbing. Pale hands fluttering like nitrile butterflies. He sniffed at the body, scrutinized its suit, he shook the corpse down and felt it up. He probed inside the man's mouth and palpated on his misplaced stomach.
'Radix pedis diaboli' is from "The Adventure of the Devil's Foot" which i turned into a mushroom cause i think that's cooler than just a plant.
The High Steward had tried everything he could. Every physician had been summoned from in and around the Kingdom. All of them either making up a diagnosis or outright admitting that they had no idea as to what could be happening. There had even been a time amidst all these visits when so much blood had been drained from his body that Sherlock was sure that the next time he fell asleep, he would not wake again.
John takes a deep breath, reaffirming himself, his convictions. John could never leave him, and would never change a moment, not in a million years, not unless he was asked point blank by Sherlock alone. "I believe you. And I forgive you. You tried what you could think of and it didn't work. Everything you tried to do was to keep me safe. I'm not angry with you. You did what you thought was right."
It could not be . . . it could not be! . . . he was not important enough to be granted this gift . . .
The little brown thrush came awake quickly. Untucking its beak from its shoulder and stretching up on thin legs, spreading its wings to cast off the sleep from its feathers that had accumulated in the night. Taking a cursory look around.
But it did little to encourage him, for what he saw boiling around the high needle of Sherlock's tower, were pregnant thunderclouds that looked like they wanted to do nothing more than drown the earth.
"Jesus! Are you wearing a plug?" He paled at the tenacity with which Sherlock had wanted to immolate himself just moments before and how they'd just barely skirted disaster. "Did you forget?"
John slapped the folder down on the sitting room desk with a sigh, rubbing his hands across his face before tunneling them through his short, coarse hair. The act made it stick up in starburst spikes, but he took no notice. Mycroft's visit had both angered him and intrigued him.
John laughs a bit. "Mm. No. Chianti, I think. More fitting." He doesn't expect Sherlock to get The Silence of the Lambs reference and is more than a little surprised when Sherlock lifts his head and pulls back far enough to reveal a concentrated frown.
Charles was brushing his lips back and forth over the corner of Sherlock's jaw now. Gentling Sherlock back as he resurfaced from the depths of his mind. He was murmuring to him beneath his breath, pecking soft kisses as he whispered dark words. Reveling in the way Sherlock's body had broken out into goose flesh. "Death is everywhere, my lambkin. All around you. Swift and blind in its taking. And in times of war it is far less likely to promise back the ones who leave us. It will do you well to remember that. Shut up here safely in your tower where the war will never reach you. . ."
John wilted slightly, feeling like an interruption more than anything. Knowing by the look in Sherlock's pragmatic eyes that his words were true and had to turn away. "I believe you Jeremy. And I'm sorry." Doing what he thought right, he produced his wallet from his back pocket and pressed a fifty pound note into Sherlock's hand. "Here. Get what you need."
From the folds of his tabard, brother Michael produced a small scroll of parchment spun between two black rods. Finally unveiling the true cause for his mission. Its seal was a thick black dollop of wax that had been pressed with the insignia of the basilisk, a symbol known far and wide to belong to the Royal Holmes' Family.
"You're looking well." William had said, breaking the silence. His eyes had shone with pride as he gave John a once-over, only giving him a hint of that devastating smile that had warmed John on countless occasions like the sun.
The driver stands solemnly in a pressed black suit, sporting a steel gray beard and mustache. His hands are tucked politely before him and John doesn't hold back the incredulous smirk as he recognises this man.
"And then there was one time, towards the last of my stay at the hospital, when I awoke to a man standing over me, prying open my eye. He was old. A soldier, I think, with one side of his face burnt black and peeling. This was death, I remember telling myself, coming to take me.
Sherlock hummed in approval and dropped his voice as low as a lorry's rumble, sliding his teeth over the shell of John's ear. "You were masturbating."
Exploring his edges gently, he rocked his body, trying to find a rhythm between the water, the fingertip, and the stripping of his flesh. He turned one nipple into the spray and shuddered as it created a trifecta of stimulation, riding  that brighter burst of arousal like a shockwave.
Sherlock sat back on his heels, smiling to himself and placing his fingertips together before him as his brain stirred in his head. "Yes. I believe the rest of the cavalry should be arriving shortly. They'll be expecting answers."
John's face took on that peculiarly becoming shade of red, but it did make not shy away. Instead, he reached out his hand and let Sherlock take it.
And the nucleus of it all was that of all times to be on the brink of another crazy case, there was the incredibly terrifying, totally outrageous, and potentially amazing possibility that he would share his bed too. Be a half in the most intimate of intimate things that the world's only Consulting Detective could share...and it rocked John Watson to his core.
"Simple." Sherlock began coyly, delighted to flex his skills now that his experiment had reached the tedious stage of observation. "You haven't updated your blog for four days now and you're worried about waning public opinion, it doesn't take me to see that from the way you looked around the kitchen for you laptop, that you're gasping to check your e-mail.
"You would have been air lifted initially to Camp Bastion where you would have had to be stabilized before risking travel again and then transferred to Selly Oak Hospital in Burmingham for further recovery, as is the typical procedure for wounded soldiers. From there you would have been sent to Headly Court for rehabilitation, but something happened to you before you got there, something delayed your transfer, you didn't make it to Headly for a long while. But what was it?
What did that infernal git think he was doing? Leaving horrible cups of tea randomly for John to drink? Not only just ignoring, but /avoiding/ John completely with no explanation or even HINT as to what it was that he had even done. John was spoiling for a row now. Something to do. /Anything/ to get some answers.
Sherlock met his eyes, deciding that he would not let John know that he had just rocked his entire foundation. "Sorry. What?" John let out a snort. "Nothing. Never mind. Do you want to get out of here? I'm stuffed."
The violin screamed beside Sherlock, upon him, because of him. The sounds he couldn't make from his mouth were drawn from heated metal. The next best thing. They threatened now, to drip like molten steel onto his chest, down his legs, and flood the room. To smother them both in rich and poignant sound and drown them together forever.
This doorway was the only way to reach the North and rarely opened its doors except to those of the most import. The only other choice was to go several hundred miles out of the way to where the cliffs no longer stood sentinel over the land and should any such attacker choose these alternative routes, they could be seen and dealt with by the castle's far reaching eyes long before they ever posed a threat.
The fingers idly stroking the High Steward's chest stopped in mid-motion, his gaze finally flicking to John in distaste. "Of course not you moron. There is only one opinion that I seek from you."
Sherlock met his eyes at that, searching his gaze before giving a little nod and turning back down to his phone. A moment later, Sherlock produced a hundred pound note from his pocket and threw it in John's direction carelessly.
"I don't know, perhaps I had assumed you were still ...going steady? Or whatever the parlance is these days."
The minute breadth of a single finger did all it could to electrify the nerves around his hole. Lighting him up like a switchboard to transfer waves upon waves upon waves of sensation up his spine and out into his fingers. He had to come back to himself twice before he lost his balance, reminding himself that there was nothing solid to grab onto should he capsize and the thought of being sprawled out in exploit was sobering.
Alarmed, John took him firmly by the chin, desperately wishing that he would look at him. "How? How could I not love you?"
All it takes is one shout, one startled yelp from Sherlock and John is up, swiping out his hand for a weapon, and moving before the drugs know to stop him.
But there's a heavy thump and Sherlock is over him with black curls hanging like a frame about his face. His large long hand smoothing through John's hair. Trying to comfort. Trying to soothe. His mouth is moving. Muttering. Mumbling something in that deep baritone and John has to really focus to hear what he is saying. Has to focus enough to cancel out the high-pitched whine he didn't realize he was making through his teeth to understand the other man's words.
John's head snaps back into the cushions. His shoulder whines and Sherlock's mouth works him with the solitary focus of a man who solves crimes for a living and has found something more interesting than a crime scene. Inside his jaw is hot and wet and soft and moving so rapturously that John can't even feel the rest of his body. His cock is the only thing that exists of him. And it is bright and it is pulsing and it is so fucking close to going off that he ---
John gave his tooth another lave, rolling his eyes at Sherlock's back. "Yes, in fact..." he looked about to explain his idle standing and his eyes fell upon the stack of records on the floor in the corner. It was a project he'd always had tucked away for doing and now seemed a good a time as any. The day was yet young. "I'll just sort these."
Sherlock glanced up just as John pried his anchored stare away, too afraid at what Sherlock might see when he looked at him. John took to watching him surreptitiously through the reflection of the window, trying to parse his feelings and sort himself as the shadows washing over the taxi made Sherlock's face swim from back and forth from dream to reality.
John sat back, realizing something. "You won't. That's what it is, isn't it? You won't touch him because he's more valuable to you out in the world causing trouble." He sneered, absolutely disgusted, folding his arms across his chest. He made note of the car's continual right turns, figuring that it was circling the block. His blood was boiling. "How do you sleep at night? Knowing you could do something about it and instead doing nothing at all? Hm?"
He studied its contents as though it told Sherlock's deepest secrets. Swirling it like wine. "If you were to drink this, do you know what it would taste like?"
When a new High Steward had been found and a hasty yet decadent coronation been afforded, Sherlock received word of a very peculiar decree that the new High Steward Charles Magnussen had requested before he was to take the throne.
Whomever the artist had been, they had clearly taken the time and put to use their considerable skill in making a man who was wholly menacing in person look downright sinister in oil. Everything about him had been perfectly recreated, from the cold slice of his eyes down to the exaggerated bulge of his codpiece.
With a pointed look, Sherlock was clambering over John's knees and out of the taxi like a dark flash, leaving John to pay and trundle slowly in after him as he shot up the stairs two at a time. If it hadn't been for the residual heat lingering on the back of his hand, John wouldn't have been so content to let Sherlock have a moment to get his thoughts together.
With his muscles sufficiently loosed, his body purged, and the warm jaggedness of Sherlock lying across him, plundering his mouth with the acrid aftertaste of cum and arse, the threat of sleep overtook John quickly. His mouth grew slack and his hands leaden, slipping from Sherlock's head eventually. "I need to feed you up" he muttered against Sherlock's face, his tongue turning heavy, "you're all bones."
"But he has John." Harriet had said all the more ardently, looking up from where she was fastidiously  slicking the armour piece by piece with ox urine and then summarily soaking it with oil, getting the dark metal to shine without light. "He's going with you. Whether you like it or not. You won't talk him out of it."
It was still quite surreal to know that the man who'd just done a bang up job on John's tooth was languishing in a cell right now. About to have the book thrown at him for his unspeakable misdeeds.
It strung out all the amazing and terrible and wonderful things that his life had suddenly become since his moving in with this madman. How only four months previous, he'd been sitting in his therapist's office, pathetic as a mongrel with a cane he didn't truly need, having trust issues and claiming that nothing ever happened to him.
"It took a bit of convincing, but Geoff was eventually persuaded." Sherlock sniffed proudly. "I can be very persuasive."
Sweet molten arousal burst anew through John's loins. His mouth finding purchase in the swirling depths of Sherlock's hair once again. He scraped his teeth against Sherlock's scalp. Sherlock had been planning this almost all day. "How else? Did you do anything else? Tell me."
As he came back to himself, John noticed he was grunting and gasping wantonly as Sherlock sucked him. His fingers having found their way curled around the front of Sherlock's ears, squeezing his temples and setting a rhythm to which Sherlock seemed only obligingly to match. John stopped just as the deep sharp feeling resonated through his pelvis like the beginnings of a conflagration, tugging at Sherlock's head. Too soon. Too soon.
John, eager to distract themselves, leaned over to whisper. "Did it never occur to you that I might like to know that you've made me an appointment with a serial killer Sherlock? I mean, for Christ's sake, he's going to have his hands in my mouth!"
His shrill cries and pleas for mercy during his long journey seemed to darken the very air around them as he passed.
He pressed his palms into the table, taking deep breaths in through his nose to calm himself back down.
A pall spread over the congregation as the King unfurled a scroll between his spidery hands and read it aloud. His soft voice never rose above the level of intimate conversation, but because of the complete silence, he was clearly heard by all.
And it belongs to the man he'd seen at the bar. The one he should have noticed from the start, with the slick dark suit and the throat tattoo and the fire-coloured hair. And he is grinning and grinning and GRINNING like a cat in the catnip garnished cream saying something John can't hear and so he turns to get closer and the voice becomes clear:
"Two birds. One stone. I get it...well," John says. "I understand why you did it, at least. Can't say I enjoyed being the test subject. But I have to say, it was rather clever."
He looked deceptively young, with a diamond shaped face and thin, wispy limbs wrapped smartly in a three piece gray suit that he chose to wear tieless and garnished with a white silk pocket handkerchief. A shock of torchlight orange hair was slicked back into a mound at the top of his head, exuding an unnatural elegance that was simply intriguing.
The King offered no greeting as they brought their horses to a stop. The only thing he gave was a cursory glance at William, before letting his flat, lifeless eyes rake up and across the entire breadth of John.
The steep embankment ran up into a taller vertical wall, plum-bob straight and built as though it intended to block out the sky.
"Alright. Take it easy. I'm just trying to understand. But you said 'usually participate in', have you EVER enjoyed sex?"
When he looked up again, Sherlock was sorting out two different types of nails into zinc and copper piles and had a mess of alligator clips set before him. Oblivious to John's sudden feelings of quiet outrage, acting as if nothing had even happened, as of their lives hadn't been in danger at all. And it made John angrier.
Moran's sneer had transformed into something predatory, his eyes foreseeing a battle already won. "Very well, Lord of Umberland of the North. I am Marshal Moran. I come under the blessing of King James of Westwood. You and your people will have a decision to make by this time tomorrow: side with King James and his Crusade or be slaughtered. The choice is simple."
"It seems as though I owe you an apology Anderson." Sherlock said vacantly to the awaiting silence in the act of peeling off his gloves. He was lost in a far-away stare, looking upstream at a spot in the murky, icy water as if he could see through its dark depths. Missing the moment when all three of the other men's jaws dropped in unison.
"If you would be amenable, I would very much like to fellate you now. Assuming you have recovered enough."
And it felt so utterly wrong to see him depicted in this way that it twisted something deep inside John's stomach.
"Sorry, but I am. I can't think anymore and I have to work this afternoon. I need at least a little bit of a kip to keep me functioning. Unlike some people." He generously waved a hand towards the skull on the mantle. "Talk to Billy if you're so keen. You two need to do some catching up anyway. I think he's getting jealous."
"You've not eaten anything substantial in sixteen hours. And it seems I still owe you dinner." Sherlock said idly. "Is that boring enough?"
"Um, yes. Though I'm ...open to not being one. Er, I mean, switching. Or whatever they call it. If you're comfortable with that."
To Hell with Umberland of the North. Moran could have it and all its worthless peasants. As long as John regained his beloved in the midst of the bloodshed. . .
John approaches him, tilting up his chin as he gets closer, sizing this larger man up and making sure to look at him in both his eyes. Letting him see that John H. Watson former Captain of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers and friend/colleague/blogger/lover of the World's Only Consulting Detective is not afraid.
John smiled beautifully and agreed. It was nice to put to rest the worry that Sherlock's reciprocity had been misplaced. That all the one-sided erections had not been for a lack of interest, but simply a misunderstanding. Had Sherlock always been so misunderstood? Certainly John couldn't have been the first to assume.
"Say it John." Sherlock insisted again. He felt silken gut catch ever so slightly at a dry spot and immediately withdrew, shoving his fingers back into his mouth and re-lubricating them with an overabundance of saliva before they pierced John again. "Say it!"
King James was a man with a ravenous appetite for death and destruction and as his army carved northward, he promised to decimate any town or village he came across that would not claim loyalty to him. Slaughtering all those who refused to stand at his side. His sanguinolency seemingly unstoppable.
Sherlock stood tall and turned to them, drawing in a suggestive breath with his light eyes turning to saffron in the halogen. His hands coming up to steeple before the soft blade of his face, almost as if in offering. "Our murderer chose these two men because they possess nearly identical traits; same height, same physique, even the same hair color.
"Mmmm ready...please....I'm ready." It was a struggle to be coherent, to be heard above the lust. "Fuck me." He gasped.
"Extraordinary." Sherlock finished and John followed his pale, transfixed eyes down to the placket of his own jeans where the heavy fabric was  straining against his tumescence.
John had always enjoyed it immensely when previous partners had paid attention to his testicles while giving him head. A supplemental grope or stroke to assist in his climb to orgasm. But this solitary attention paid only to his bollocks alone was stirring the blood hot heat in his body to positively volcanic temperatures.
John's thoughts immediately realigned themselves. "Damnit Sherlock." And he snatched the phone away, reading the message before dialing. He stepped out into the sitting room to take it and came back when he was done. "Dr. Banerjee's had a family emergency and Sarah's asked me to come in to cover for him this afternoon. I told her I would. You don't mind, do you?" He said somewhat apologetically, looking at his watch. Space between them would do them both well. "Which means I've got about a fifteen minutes to get to the train."
John wanted to keep him occupied, keep his mind straining between two opposite directions and leave his senses floating untethered somewhere in the middle. Sherlock answered just as John's meatus touched his hispid center.
those of you ambitious enough to look up where Sherlock swanned off to will possibly get an idea of where this story's headed. ;} so hopefully you approve.
"I am." Closing his eyes, John tried hard not to think about how strange it was to have the Prince of Castle Appledore pouring warm, sweet-smelling water over his shoulders. How, as he'd done with his clothes, Sherlock treated him so gently as he worked the cloth up around his throat. Combed his long fingers through the tangle of his beard and now began to work one finger at the fine creases in his face.
"Sherlock." John said softly, soothingly, kissing lightly at the corners of his sneering mouth. "Sherlock. C'mon." He used variations on his name to punctuate each touch of lips. Kissing and prompting and kissing and prompting until that impossible mouth became lax again under his patient touches and finally Sherlock could not help but give the tiniest kiss back.
"No one would accuse you of vanity, John." Sherlock scoffed. "A bespoke RARELY get dry cleaned. That's entirely the point of them. Chemicals would only warp the wool. Besides, the smell was all wrong. It smelled like steam iron press and something...organic. I can't place it exactly, which is irritating.
Sherlock spun on Lestrade, practically vibrating with pleasure. "I assume that the victim had his back turned towards the tunnel when he was shoved, yes? Possibly engaging in conversation with the disguised man?"
He released his knees and threw his hands up over his face as Sherlock gave his arsehole its first ever lick. Most surprised by the sheer delight he found in its filth. The warm, wet sensation so shocking in the hot grin of his cleft,  he had to desperately fight to keep from closing his legs.
After all, Afghanistan had been at the bottom of an ocean millions of years ago. Change was bound to happen.
Sherlock laid a heavy eye on him. "Since you so hastily turned down my previous attempt in favour of someone more reprehensibly boring, I'm giving you a second chance to redeem yourself."
A once thriving and industrious town; it had since become an occupied ghost town. And all within the last four years.
Sherlock came forward and tipped his head over John, his face close, utilizing his height and reaching up to rub his thumb across John's cheek. "You do not have to hide from me." He stated, taking turn to look into each of John's eyes separately for emphasis.
John resumed his seat at the bar, signalling the barman over. What he wanted desperately was a good old fashioned pint to try and drown himself in, but he got something else instead. "I'll have another of those ...truffly things please."
"I've discovered I like the taste of your ejaculate..." Sherlock shrugs as if this is no great deal. Tongue rudely continuing. And there's just enough gargle in his voice to make John realize that he's holding some of the come his mouth. To /savour/.
Sherlock flexed his mouth in a somewhat answer, off kilter for the second time tonight, unable to find the words. The tip of his large nose was burnished to a rosy pink and he was folded more tightly into his coat. The cold was finally getting to him.
"When Charles Magnussen was selected to take the throne in my brother's stead, he vowed that he would only do so if Mycroft agreed to give him my hand in return. Do you see now, John? I am betrothed to him whether I wish it or not. And the only thing that can break the decree is for Mycroft to die in battle or for myself to give in to the High Steward's wishes and accept him."
"Aha!" He boasts. His hand claps down on the table and he startles himself a bit with the noise. He waves a finger at her rudely. "I've seen you on the telly!"
"I am him." John said finally, pulling his shoulders up to look the part. The sway in his stance had not helped though.
After that, the flat fell into silence. John stood in place for a long while, far enough away it seemed not to disturb Sherlock's pout and resumed his previous position of staring at the head the world's stroppyist Consulting Detective.
"What the fuck! What the bloody goddamn fuck have you done?!" John came barrelling down the stairs, meeting all six feet of the wounded detective at the bottom. He got up right into his face, stabbing an accusatory finger in proximity to his eye. Sherlock merely held up his hands in protest.
He made quick work on the plain of John's belly, the small wrinkles of folded skin. Smearing his mouth over everything he could reach and finally secured in his knowledge that he'd stalled all he could, he leant up onto his elbows and asked in a hoarse, dark voice. "Enough time has passed, I take it? I'm allowed to make you come and you'll keep your dignity intact?"
Swallowing his surprise, John and William both made quick work of getting John redressed in his new garments. And John marveled at the feeling of the soft textiles as they slipped over his battered skin.
"Very much so." John blurted. He had nearly said 'my Lord' but caught his tongue just in time. "That is...I have never worn such fine things in all my life. I do not know how I will ever repay you."
"I will not require your company any longer today." Sherlock said gently after another comfortable silence befell them. His hands were cupped into each other behind his back and he did not turn his head. "Go and get settled in your new chambers. Have rest, for tomorrow shall be a long and tiresome day. And please do not feel the need to wear any of that ridiculous armour in my presence again. We are hardly liable to be attacked by anyone all the way up here. Good day to you, John."
Sherlock's fine-boned fingers raised in such a way as to splay tip-to-tip before his chin. A gesture akin to prayer, but different enough to not be mistaken as such.
"I'm...I..." Sherlock stutters. And he's looking down at his cock which is standing straight out against his belly. Much to his own surprise, to go by the look on his face.
"You're having me on." John says after a beat. Not able to stop himself admiring the tiny wrinkles in the twist of Sherlock's long white neck.
It was unwillingly losing himself to the drug. His body going lax without his consent. His mind suddenly refusing to care.
He kissed him until the man begged for breath and breathed for him when he tried to stop. John didn't stop to investigate the tears that occasionally ran down the man's temples. Only worked his hips more softly and made it his life's work to hit every sweet and glorious spot inside to get that mountain of man to crumble.
"Yes my Lord." John answered and watched as the High Steward's feather-wrung head disappeared down the steps.
"This is from this morning. Fresh enough to still be warm." The High Steward remarked, holding it up by its neck to scrutinize before the firelight. The rings on his fingers tinkled    against the glass as he turned it.
Words from a lifetime ago come floating back to John, conjured up as if by ghosts: '/when you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield/' It strengthens the resolve in his plan.
"I'm sorry." John whispered in congested, open vowels. "I didn't mean to disturb you. I just...it's beautiful."
"I'll just get that then, shall I?" John tried and groaned as he got up on screaming legs. He took up Sherlock's discarded robe and pulled the ribbon tight before answering. Feeling the necessity to be decent when conversing with another human being, even over the phone.
The tears burn hot and hard in John's eyes, some of them spilling down and slicking onto Sherlock's pale face as he presses apologetic kisses to the hot red blotch high and center on Sherlock's forehead. He has no doubt it's going to turn into a pretty nasty goose egg in a little while.
He stood to his full height, looming very closely with his back towards the window that showed Molly and Lestrade chatting over the corpse. And John could do nothing but stand frozen, jaw slack, as one long hand swooped in and took him gently by the back of the neck, while the other was pressed around the side of his hip.
with the music, i'm trying to incorporate certain songs i've chosen into the chapters like they did with Sherlock episodes 2x3 and 3x1. but i'm slowly introducing them where I feel they will fit the best.
The Prince of Castle Appledore had rooms here? Like this? Behind what might as well be a dungeon door?
"You forget too easily about the Battle for Umberland of the North. Where Lieutenant Moran's head was cleaved clean from his shoulders before the fighting had even begun. Moriarty's Crusade was stopped in its tracks by little more than two hundred townsfolk. Hardly unassailable." Sherlock continued, eyes narrowing. Scoffing with a certainty he was no longer sure he felt. This shard of hope had begun to lose its luster the longer he clung to it. The battle itself having happened so long ago -- nearly two years now -- he secretly feared that it had been nothing more than legend. But he clung to it all the same.
John wants to wrap him in his arms, pull him close, but if he does he won't let go. And he /has/ to let go. "I know, love. But it's not meant to feel like that. It's meant to feel good. Next time it will be better. It'll be better for the both of us. Alright?"
John's hand groped drunkenly until he could put a loose fist in Sherlock's hair while Sherlock drug the tip of his tongue through the ejaculate, splitting it apart. "Jesus." John picked his head up to see, but it fell back again, too heavy to keep aloft. "Aw Christ."
"Ah." John had the sudden thought as to what David Attenborough might have said in an effort to describe their courting ritual.
His anus fluttered again, empty and beckoning and then his idle finger had moved to his entrance, prodding at the ring of flesh which tightened like a flirt before opening slightly and allowing him in as he exhaled.
"They're looking for and providing highly specified criteria for the murders; are already acquainted, or at least visually familiar with the victims, and have a general mode of operandi with which to off them. But why? There's something I'm not seeing. Why are these men being killed with such specificity?"
The monk suddenly beamed with joy. "Ah! I am in God's favour then. I was told I would have good luck scouring the fields. By chance, I met your sister and her wife in the village. They directed me here. I was warned you were a bit reclusive for a war hero."
"What have I ever done," John said, placid in a way he had not felt for years, "my whole life, to deserve you?" He could not hope to describe the feeling his chest. Give name to the  happiness that flowed through his veins.
John heard the strike of the match against the book, the hiss of a burgeoning flame and the sizzle of lit paper before he opened his eyes fully. His brain coming back to itself as he smelled smoke. "What do you think you're doing?"
The buttons of Sherlock's shirt had been finicky and swear-inducing with his cold fingers and Sherlock had apparently lost one of his shoes to the muck, but after finally getting him stripped completely naked, John worked a shock blanket roughly over his skin, drying what he could with what he had before wrapping the Belstaff around his shoulders and tucking the heat packs into his armpits and between his thin legs, apologizing when the back of his hand brushed Sherlock's shriveled cock accidentally.
Sherlock had been skeptical when he had learned of its signing. But when he had seen the paper with his own eyes. His family's sigil pressed deep and clear into the sealing wax by the ring on Mycroft's hand, making it indelible, he had been beside himself with shock.
"Oi! Did you do this while we were out?" John was grinning up at the new windows, which made it look as though nothing had ever happened to 221B.
But Charles' voice responded to this command before John could move, for it had been directed at the High Steward.
John knit his fingers together and rested his forearms flat on the table, as if grounding himself before electricity arced between them. "The consulting detective who's /supposedly/ a genius. Haring off in the middle of the bloody night - brandishing /stolen/ missile plans - with the intent to give them over to a serial bomber. Sound about right?" He stared fixedly at the mop of dark curls floating above the grayish, gelatinous brain now separated into six equal sized slabs. "The thing I can't seem to understand though, is why on EARTH you would ever think that would have been a smart idea."
John let the smile fade on its own as Lestrade's demeanor came back to sober, thinking more on the initial question. "But also, you have to look at it from Sherlock's point of view. To him, it's all about the clues. The case. It's just what his life is.
So when Sherlock slid out of his coat and only seemed to grow more lean and lithe in the diamond light and when his soft lips curled up at John in a way that sent his stomach afloat, John had the sudden, wistful urge to reach out and take Sherlock's hand. To claim him.
John hummed in surprise when Sherlock's hands fell to his hips and he began guiding John forward while he stepped backwards across the room, careful to never let their mouths part.
"The physician will come for your urine once you're finished." Charles said as the servants who had filled the tub filed out, having never made a sound, leaving him utterly alone with his captor. As he seemed always to be. "Until then. Your bath is ready."
John accepted them with embarrassment, realizing they came from when he'd disarmed Sherlock in an effort to keep the walls intact. "Oh...um, thanks. Sorry about that."
"Nuh uh." John stopped him with a hand on his sleeve and gave his exam table a slap with his palm. The paper crackling. "Coat off and hop up. Let me take a look at that bandaging before we go. At the rate it filled with blood this morning, it's probably overdue to be changed again. I've better stuff here to treat it with anyway. Alright?"  The sparkle in John's eyes relayed his intention to not put Sherlock in a difficult position tonight, but also that the man's stubbornness would make it impossible to resist forever.
The noise resounded in the empty waiting room, following him into the break room where the vending machine buzzed indifferently. He rummaged through his pockets for some pence and in the final crescendo, Page moaning in ecstasy, John looked over his meager choices of crisps versus crisps and decided on crisps.
Any attempt to gain access to the castle from the South by an invading army would be immediately thwarted if Appledore chose to bring down these columns. And with an entrance so small as to only allow six people abreast (or three upon horseback) to enter at one time, the rest of the waiting army could only hope not to be picked off as Appledore's archers rained down arrows and molten metal from the dead ground above.
"Oh." Lestrade hadn't expected a full-on admission. "Well that's...good. How long has this been going on? If I can ask..."
And this man sitting across from him had declared all that just by observation. By watching. One look to truly /see/.
When he rose, the King's eyes had finished scouring his person, but he gave no indication as to whether he had found any fault.
Not in his wildest dreams could he have imagined his body orgasming this much in a twenty-four hour period and still being able to function, post-injury or not. He hadn't felt this virile since he'd been in his late teens and certainly never so satiated in his entire life. And it made him feel foolishly giddy.
When John checked his watch, he was surprised to see that it was almost two in the morning. That in itself made him yawn. "Are we calling it a night?"
John fingered through them initially, wanting to get an idea of where he might start and furrowed his brow. The stack was a confusion of music; orchestral albums were shuffled in with classic rock, oldies with compositional symphonies, opera with ...heavy metal? "Sherlock? Are these all yours?"
"It certainly helps that I narrowed it down for them." Sherlock found his brain tugged in half by both paradigms. He snapped his fingers in agitation. "What are the main attributes for Lorazepam?"
"Right," John shook his head smiling, not at all surprised if Sherlock had used complicated algorithms to come up with such names. And there was a certain joy in hearing the world's only Consulting Detective say 'willy-nilly'. "Because /I'm/ the one being ridiculous. Of course." He checked himself before Sherlock could take offense. "So, do you want to tell me why we've come to a club incognito then? Is it some sort of role play thing?" He ventured cautiously. "Or are you afraid someone's tailing us?"
Licking his lips, Charles slipped his hands around his lithe body, pressing the loose linen shirt up against his skin. He wanted Sherlock to feel the unbridled desire he felt for him with every slip of his many-ringed fingers, so he let his hands explore slowly and surely and at his own leisure, sliding them around to his flanks, lingering at the waist of his long braies, before going down and brazenly taking two handfuls of Sherlock's buttocks, lifting them apart enough to elicit a tiny gasp before pulling Sherlock's body against him. He pressed his stiffening sex hard into Sherlock's hip and felt the solid shape of the cock cage in return.
It took a long while for John's legs to hold his weight again. He'd managed to shoo Sherlock from the bathroom after several reassurances that he was fine and a joke that he'd need to be alone in order to properly clean himself up again. But when the door had closed behind him, John had had to move quickly to rebrace himself against the vanity before his trembling legs could drop him.
"You never need to ask me to." John said in a breath, his hands sliding down his arms and settling around his elbows. He looked vulnerable standing stark naked with his head down.
"Uh, nothing." John startled, suddenly needing to be in action. "I just thought I'd make a fire then a grilled toasty for lunch. Fancy a cheese and tomato?" He stooped at the hearth and set to work, pointedly not returning Sherlock's interested gaze as he barrel rolled to face him.
Sherlock's sea glass eyes were staring off into the middle distance, getting concerned glances from Dr. Sipe and Ygritte every time they crossed their path and John did his best to simply shrug and implored them to ignore him, that he did this sort of thing all the time. Which was certainly true, but this particular severance of the detective from reality was putting John on edge.
John turned back to Sherlock, who had an oddly serious look schooling his sharp features. As if he were trying to process what he'd just seen in the man. "What's wrong? Sherlock?" But Sherlock didn't answer.
The shorter man was obviously John with golden stubbling prickling his chin. Despite his hair being lighter than it was now, noticeably less gray, and cropped incredibly short. It was wrecked into spikes, having apparently just received a manhandling of some sort.
"That road there will take you straight on to the castle. Can't miss it," he said, pressing a finger to his spectacles as they tried to slide down his nose. There was not a chance that any but a blind man might miss the breathtaking grandeur that was Castle Appledore crowning the top of the cliff, curtained as it was by weeping waterfalls. "William. John. I trust I will see you again."
Though he admitted silently to himself that he was touched. Vocally, he opted for humor, or what he could only find as a close approximation. "To symbiotic relationships then. And, of course, the BeeGees." He raised a cheeky toast.
Sherlock juttered at this new feeling, his eyes threatening to roll into the back of his head as the angry flesh of his outermost insides were suddenly touched with kindness. John was speaking to him again.
Suddenly the silence of understanding is not enough to soothe. He wants the man beneath him to be beside him. Pressed close.
John shoved a single ibuprofin and a glass at Sherlock forcefully, gathering up his supplies with a lot of noise and throwing it onto the table on his way out. "Take that. I'm going to bed. Wake me up if you go into shock."
"At thirty-six, it would be egregiously premature for you to consider yourself old as you've not yet even reached middle age. By my approximation, you've still a good forty years of mobility left. Your previous and current lifestyle have kept you physically fit, so you're unlikely to fall ill. Injured, perhaps, but that's nothing more than problematic. We can certainly deal with that when it happens. Helps that you're a doctor, surely. But that's not truly your reason for hesitation, is it?
Tearing his eyes away, he headed toward the roaring fireplace. He took a long pair of iron tongs from the wall and pinched up three large stones that were glowing red with heat before dropping them into the half barrel bath his servants had left him  from this morning. The mysterious gray water hissed and the herbs that floated at its surface rippled softly.
Sweating sickness, a terrible plague that announced itself in cold shivers, sweating, heart palpitations and then exhaustive collapse that generally killed those that had been afflicted, had been sweeping across the country from the West and decided (before moving on) to take the last of William's kin from him.
It was only then that he noticed that by Sherlock's other elbow sat a half-eaten hard boiled egg in its cup. The tooth-pitted top was liberally salted, as if Sherlock had prepared it sometime earlier only to promptly forget it.
"Turn away." Sherlock said and John only blinked at the pearl-encrusted bust of him that rose above the elaborate screen. Sherlock was looking from John to his waist, trying to do something there. When John still did not move, his displeasure grew. "Have you become deaf Captain? I said turn away."
"But our murderer knew this and calculated that he would have to shove our victim with enough force to get him fall over three other rails. He's smart. His victim was solidly built with a low center of gravity, it would have taken a lot of force to get him up in the air and across a distance of three meters.
As subtle as it was, the tightness in Sherlock's musculature was instantly noticeable, only enhanced by the skin tight wrap of his clothes as his whole posture changed into whipcord. Instead of simply watching the door, he was now staring pointedly at it, as if he could melt it down with his gaze alone and take apart whatever it was that he'd just seen.
The crowd fell back into silence. Wiping the filth from their hands and the spit from their chins, they gathered up their children and spouses and returned to their houses in silence. As if they had not been there at all.
Somewhat comforted in the idea that they were in the right, John relaxed a bit. "So how do you know this guy's the one? Did you call up the Red-Headed League hotline or something? Ask for a dentist that fit the description?"
John's eyes popped open under the rush of adrenaline. "Sherlock?" He shuffled back as the arms fell loose, hissing when he moved his shoulder a little too quickly. "What about your rules?" Sherlock's mountainous cheekbone shined with his moisture in the dawnlight.
Their mismatched chairs sat facing each other before the hearth. One soft with red brocade, trussed up with pillows and a blanket. The other dark and plush and bracketed with the hard lines of chrome and gray leather. They were set both in harmony and counterpoint as much as the two men that occupied them. Separate and together. Each other's better halves.
Sherlock took his torso into his lap, folding him up and tipping his long jaw against John's temple, taking long pulls of breath to lead John to do the same. Breathing together. Slowing their hearts into unanimity. John's spine felt severed from the apricot of his brain, bundled like a child.
She gave a sympathetic pout at the state of him before heading towards the kitchen for the kettle, speaking to him through the open French doors. "I'm going to have a word with that boy when he gets back. He should be here taking care of you not beetling off into the night to-- wait," she reconsidered, "maybe he'll just want to experiment on you in this state, knowing how curious he is. Perhaps it is better that he's stepped out."
To this, John merely raised his eyebrows. For what did he know of physician's educations and Princely deductions? He did not have an answer that would suit, he was sure.
"Since you seem to be lingering on the subject anyway; I saw the condoms you purchased. You have come to a decision, I take it." John fought the crawling flush that warmed his neck, but couldn't manage a nod, which didn't seem to matter much, as Sherlock was speaking rhetorically. "Magnum size? Really? You are aware that that is nothing more than a marketing ploy, right? They're not any larger than the regular size."
Behind the secret door was a hidden room and its contents were bedazzling. This was where Sherlock actually lived. John could feel it.
"Not really. Nice of you though." John shrugged with his back turned, more focused on willing his erection down.
now obviously, Sherlock didn't invent the telescope. it was really Hans Lippershey of the Netherlands ... and historically not until the 1600s. but i really liked the idea of the boys bonding over a phallic object. so hee!
John reminisced on how he had awoken that morning, called to consciousness by the single soft syllable of his name, spoken from his bedroom doorway. Drawn up like a fish on a hook. He'd blinked at the mad detective, needing a moment to orient himself and sit up. "Sherlock?"
"War is different." Sherlock tried, standing up a little straighter. Still willing to guard John's dignity.
"Bathroom's not turned into a bloody jungle when we need to use it and we can break in the new sheets." He smirked and rose and held his hand out, leading Sherlock up the stairs and through the threshold, taking a seat on the side of his bed and only having a moment to admire his new high thread count bedding before he couldn't care.
Slowly, as if through a fog, something plucked persistently at his focus. It was soft and sharp as it peeled back the layers of sickness and made itself be known. It was coming from downstairs ...something ...nice. John pressed himself up, leaning an ear towards the door. Yes it was. Sherlock was playing his violin.
Sherlock took his pause as though it were lingering unease, speaking more candidly. "I don't do anything I don't want to do John. You know this." He leaned back to match shoulders with John, pulling his phone from his pocket. "It was a comfortable moment between us and I acted accordingly. Isn't that what you're suppose to do?"
John took him by the face after that, allowing the first tyrannical intrusion into Sherlock's body to ebb into something much less shocking for the both of them. Setting their breathing pace. The action left Sherlock effectively pinioned, unable to run and hide now. "Shh.Sshh. Easy. Sherlock. You need to tell me what's going on."
"You feel so good, love. This feels SO good." John encourages. It hurts a bit and it's a bit overwhelming but it feels /right/ and he loves it. "C'mon. Move now. You can move."
"Uh...a mess?" Lestrade stated lamely and Sherlock didn't even bother to give him an eye roll, his gaze was locked fixedly on John, willing him to be the more observant one. John set down the remaining coffees on the counter in order to be able to focus better. "Um," he followed the progression of the organs from the top down, hoping something would simply jump out at him.
Between one blink and the next, John became alarmed by his forehead bumping the medicine cabinet, completely unaware that he'd lost all faculties in his neck muscles and hoped that he hadn't just made that small whine that he'd very positively heard just happen.
He tromped up the stairs, shivering with adrenaline. It was going to take a good long while for him to come back down from this, he wasn't going to count on getting to sleep any time soon.
After a while, the molestation subsided, his sobbing ebbed, and he was lead bonelessly to the couch offering no protest. His legs and insides having turned to jelly. His shoulder ached maliciously, but even still it was a new kind of ache. A sharper, necessary one. One that when it faded, would fade away completely and leave him in a peace for longer than he had ever been granted.
"You can do it John." Sherlock says, seeing him waver. He presses his lips against John's temple. "Just this little bit more and then we can go home."
"Most people try to hide aspects of themselves, thinking it will make them a better person or more well liked as an individual within a group dynamic. But they hide themselves poorly. You, however, are an open book, even without my abilities others see who and what you are as easily as it if it were broadcast. You have no secrets and yet you are unfathomable."
Under the harsh fluorescent light it was easier to see than it had ever been in their bathroom with two light bulbs burnt out. John was able now to look over the laceration with new clarity and fresh eyes, frowning at the unusual markings. "Sherlock? Did you try to stitch this up on your own last night?"
But John had turned and run. Out of the orchard and away from his ex-lover and into a despair so deep it took almost dying to see him out again.
It carefully surveyed the interior of the circular solar with its empty walls and hollow girth. Its black eyes looking over the only piece of furniture in the room: the imposing oak hulk of the intricately carved four-poster bed set back against the far curve. With its green velvet curtains pulled back to expose its neatly tucked linen sheets, its perfectly folded embroidered silk coverlet, and the perfectly plumped down-filled pillows. Clearly having remained unslept in.
Once inside, brother Michael began readying a fire for cooking and pulling down the Watsons' only cooking pot, spitting into it to clean away something with his sleeve.
At that, their eyes had been the meeting of two storms. A long practiced skill of reading each other through silence. Conveying messages while words lay unspoken and John hoped that above all else William understood that John was no longer angry at him. That William had been forgiven for breaking his heart.
Sherlock was painted and pearled and sparkled like the royalty he was. While John looked not dissimilar to a drowned cat someone had lifted from a rut in the road.
Unlike the black and gold of Appledore's official knights who wore simplistic (yet no less stunning) battle armour, John's armour was polished silver with only the merest touches of gold to offset them. An understated construction that made it all the more gorgeous.
The sun itself had yet to bloom over the far horizon, but the sky before it was haloed with a gentle purple dawn just bright enough to light the way.
"Right. I'll just, uh *ahem* ask the others." John told himself aloud, trying to reassert his intentions.
And given his position in the castle now for the last four years, it was a rather fair description. He seemed to be content in waiting for Appledore to die in its languish, so that he may feed from its offering.
"No." He said thickly, coughing into his tissue when his throat tickled before taking it in hand. He held it up, looking it over though it appeared to have remained unchanged. "No, he never said. Only that I would be able to figure it out eventually."
"What appointment?" John was now just as confused. Droplets of jostled coffee splashing on the floor and miraculously missing his shoes.
i'm hoping to have it finished by the Christmas special...so keep fingers crossed for that. next chapter's got A LOT going on it.
"Mm." Sherlock sighs as he slips off. "There's a Buffalo Bill joke in there somewhere, but I'm too tired."
"Yes my Lord." John said. He practically shivered with excitement. WHOLE days left alone with Sherlock. It was unfathomable.
And now it was Sherlock's turn to frown. "I was experimenting John. And besides, digestion slows me down."
John was thanking the heavens that Sherlock was up and moving, clearly lucid, but John vaguely recalled that conscious patients found in hypothermic conditions could suddenly develop ventricular fibrillation without warning. He needed to minimize Sherlock's movements, prevent dysrhythmia, and get him dry and warm immediately.
There was no way possible he could make this climb every day. Not if his and William's chambers were clear down at the bottom like the High Steward had hastily mentioned when they had begun their ascent. He was certain that he would expire upon the stairs within a fortnight.
"Was he the one to break it off then?" Sherlock gave a nod of appreciation to John's obvious attentiveness concerning sentiment.
By the time John caught up with him, Sherlock was out on the kerb sitting in a taxi with the door open, his nose buried in his Blackberry.
It had been two whole days since John had got a proper look at him and to know that he was alright made something inside John's core soften in relief. Sherlock could still be mad at John, if that's what the issue was, but at least he was /here/ to do it.
John could have sworn that his lashes were clumped with moisture, but Sherlock was looking down between them now, scooting closer, shaking his head, bringing a surprised yelp out of John as Sherlock took them both in hand and began a steady stroking of their cocks pressed together. "If I look at you I'll start to think and if I think, it will all be lost. Please John. Now. I need this now."
Sherlock blundered for a moment, making him look all the more endearing before he clasped his fidgeting hands behind his back in an effort to stem his coltish behaviour. "I, uh, you'll be pleased to know that the goose has been removed and returned to the Oakshot sisters while you were away. It had *ahem* coughed up the goods shortly after you left. The reward money should be wired into our account by the morning. Mrs. Hudson took the liberty of cleaning your floor and all your bedding has been replaced. The soiled ones have been thrown in the bin."
Sherlock topped the stairs with soft steps and after a brief moment of hesitation, held out an envelope over John's shoulder for him to take between two long fingers. But John only gave it a brief glance before turning back to the spot on the wall he'd been staring at with a grimace. He didn't need to look at it too closely, after all.
"Partially." Sherlock smirked. "While you were dithering about getting coffee orders I cross-referenced all dentists located between the places of death of both victims. Balance of probability being that he would not have strayed far from his familiar location. Only suspect to fit the description with such ostentatious hair and meet all other criteria  was HIM." Sherlock held up his Blackberry, displaying the webpage of the very office who's waiting room they were currently sitting in. A Mr. Sterling Sipe DDS in a white dress shirt sporting a shock of vivid red hair was smiling kindly back at them.
"So I'm going to say this now and I'm going to say this to you as often as you need to hear it to get it through that idiot, genius brain of yours: I love you Sherlock."
"Oh please! That would be lovely!" Molly acquiesced. "Heavy on the milk and lots and lots of sugar for me. 'Til the spoon stands up' like my dad use to say."
John couldn't help it. He threw his head back and gave one throaty laugh at the ridiculousness of it all.
"John?" Mrs. Hudson's harried voice came stabbing in through the kitchen, sounding close, as if she were only standing on the other side of the French doors before something had stopped her. "John! Sherlock? Oh! Are you boys decent?"
"Of course." John said, eyes still sweeping over the tables. Taking it all in. "Though, I have been meaning to ask..."
Two thousand pounds? What on earth could Sherlock need that much money for? If it was to buy something more for his wardrobe, John figured he would have just used the credit card, told John about it, as he always did, and John would have immediately transferred the money from the checking to pay for it. That was their routine.
The man sighed at his want to hold conversation with this little thing and herded the thrush back into the solar by merely walking towards it. Noticing how it was careful to keep a generous distance between itself and him, despite the breakthrough they'd made today. Perhaps it blamed him for this interruption.
John clearly had experience with sex, Sherlock noted, being able to read it in his every move. He estimated John to be a confident lover who knew exactly where to put things and how to do it.
His neck turned to water and his eyes slid closed as the pang conjured up images of Sherlock recklessly hoisting John's legs over his shoulders so that he could eat John's hole like soft fruit. Tousled black hair sweat-slicked against an aristocratic brow, jutting up between the firm muscles of John's thighs. Wild eyes closed with such utter sweetness as if no meal on earth could have been more worth eating.
Looking up the taut length of John's body, he met the doctor's eyes and smiled when John licked his lips. His Adam's apple bobbing tenuously. He was going to have to keep John focused on the physicality of what they were about to do and not let him slip into self-consciousness. Or John would quickly lose his nerve and perceive it as his feared inadequacy.
"Trivial." Sherlock had waved a long hand in dismissal, "we've a client coming at three John. I expect--" then he immediately stiffened up, his ear cocked towards the stairs.
"Yes. This morning,'' John says, not even bothering to worry about how he could possibly know. "'Natural causes' apparently. So if that doesn't make you mad enough to rouse you out of bed then I don't know what will." He picks at the bed linen a bit and goes for a cheap blow. "I thought you agreed that we would work together."
