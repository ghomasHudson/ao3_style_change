John pointed at the man behind the glass. "He's... Smith, I presume?"
While he had inspected the lady's ankle with solemn focus, Mary had not taken his eyes off him. "So I will be able to dance again?"
"Then you must’ve gotten one of the steps wrong."
John's eyes fell from her to Sherlock, a question tilting his head.
John's gaze followed the girl and her parents for a while before his eyes travelled around the station, watching. Crowds filled with women and men, in dresses and suits, enfolding their loved ones in their arms with a desperation and relief that was written across their whole appearances. John could only feel a dull ache in his chest. Sometimes, he wished he could feel something like this again. Love. Longing. Anything that could make him feel as if he was living an actual life with meaning and purpose. But his last wish had exposed itself as a lie, not having been his last wish at all, and now … now he was staring into the void.
It was the silence that startled him the most. He did not know what else he had expected, but somehow the sudden dominance of cold air and quiet surprised him. His nerves were on edge. The light in his hand flickered over the room with care, as if not to disturb the stones. He took a few slow steps into the room and gave it a once-over. Not much to be seen here. Opposite him, at the end of the room, a large shelf was facing him. It was filled with vessels, conical flasks, tumblers and jars.
Their lips meet and open for tongues starving to dance with each other. The passion of their kiss heats up quickly and grows into lust as one kiss melts into another and another, their joint moans filling the room filthily. They have started moving, and when John's cock slides against Sherlock's and they are chest to chest, Sherlock has to break the string of kisses to pull him closer.
As they start moving together, again push and pull, up and down, rutting back and forth, it can't even be called kissing anymore. They both have their eyes closed in pleasure, mouths hanging open and are just moaning against each other. Occasionally (but eventually always) coming back to each other, tongues twirling, and orgasmic noises are joined by the sounds of wet suction.
He hesitated. With his head bowed it was hard to tell what he was thinking. Eventually, he did speak up, his voice smaller than before. "Why?"
, little
"I hear these two often go hand in hand," he murmured, but a little smirk flashed over his lips.
"Uh, Sherlock?" He turned around, already halfway into the hall that led to the bedroom.
He doesn't. Has no clue. If he wouldn't still be pretty invested in the simple task of gaining back his common sense, he would probably even feel very self-conscious and maybe think about sulking about it for at least a week. He must look embarrassing. How could he let John see him like this? How is he not disgusted or shocked by this sight? But in fact, he even looks only more turned on, and that makes something inside of Sherlock feel impossibly warm and sends a light shiver down his spine, knowing he has done this to John, knowing the hunger in that dark blue pair of eyes is meant for him, and with that thought all the rationality gets blown away once more in an instance.
John let out an unbelieving laugh. "Why? I lost him. He got away."
"Yes?" he asked with a smile. The red wine was preventing it from leaving his face for quite some time now.
in the morning, calls him
His eyes screamed of desperation as he slowly sank down with him, holding him until they were both on the floor. He pressed his hand over James's to stop the bleeding and watched out of helpless eyes as James tried to breathe through the blood that drowned him.
Sometimes John calls Sherlock little secret names in his head. Greets him with
"Is everyone coming?"
Sherlock appeared to be wanting to melt through the floorboards. "...Yes."
The answer comes in a rumble that vibrates through his whole body. That should be the only thing that will be heard of him for the rest of the night.
It's his body he cannot believe. His actual, naked body that is above him, so close, and he not only feels but sees him breathing. The chest rising and falling. While, in the darkness of the room and the pale moonlight shining through halfly closed curtains, his skin appears in mostly blue shades, his chest and face melt more into fading purple colours – flushed. Hints of John's arousal.
"You know why I'm asking," he said to Sherlock as he came back from the kitchen. "What affects me far more than this is that I still don't know what happened to you. To
He took a look around and counted. There was Sally Donovan next to Lestrade, Anderson and Mrs Hudson, Bill Wiggins in the corner. That made it three people missing. Janine and yes, Molly Hooper and...
They reached the end of the stairs and walked past Mrs Hudson's flat and out of the front door. Speedwells was literally no more than one stone's throw away and one minute later they were sitting inside the coffee shop and by the window, opposite each other. John ordered breakfast and a cup of tea, black, no sugar. They brought the tea in next to no time, and he almost burned his tongue on the steaming hot first sip that would hopefully bring him through the morning. He closed his eyes at the taste of bitterness and warmth on his lips and endured the pain the burn caused him. All this time he had not noticed that Sherlock would not take his eyes off him. Was he trying to picture how it tasted? Would he ask him again to let him drink a sip, like he had done with the wine? But the look on his face did not speak of wonder or longing as much as of … observation? Was he studying him? Or just making use of his
"You too," he remarked, and his tired eyes grew softer with worry.
Sherlock swayed them through the room to the pace of the music.
"Are you bored?"
Sherlock. It couldn't be! This was the body he had left back. And in the center of him there was a blood pumping heart. It shone bright red, a burning sun made of ruby, just beneath his ribcage.
Sherlock, who had bowed his head in – well, it certainly was not shame but an apology perhaps – turned his head to John. John knew the look on his face. He was about to unravel something difficult. Something from the heart.
John hurried over to him. "Tell me what to do."
The world shifted as his head wrapped itself around his name, driving him into bits and pieces of a memory and a fantasy intertwined. The blood was washed from his skin, and his skin felt dry and warm against the rippled fabric of another man’s tanktop. His muscles were evident through the single layer of khaki cloth, and John pressed himself against it further. The wall behind him was cold against his bare back, but he, he was so warm.
John raises his hand, reaching out for him. The back of his hand meets a sharp cheekbone, and he lets it smooth over the tickling layer of stubble around his chin.
"As I said, Doctor, I wish it would be that easy to kill this
"Very good."
Just when they all shut their mouths and looked at her did she realise what she had done. She seemed a little embarrassed. But also a little proud. Now calmly, she continued, "If Sherlock's new friend is going to be with us from now on, I believe we all owe him an introduction and an apology for behaving like tactless animals."
"Ever heard of James Moriarty,
John took the first steps on the rungs before he looked over his shoulder.
detective? The one who went missing?"
He looked almost offended at this. "Oh, good Doctor. No, no, no. You cannot wildly theorise without having all the facts at present. You would be dead already if I was what you suggest I'd be."
"You never read any newspapers, Dr Watson? You will have no trouble finding my name. The news is my business."
"Of what?"
Sherlock Holmes?"
Honey! Honey?
"Lucky for us, I have already mixed such a poisonous emulsion for precisely this kind of opportunity. As it is, Doctor, you are a true conductor of light at this moment. In the literal sense."
"Oh, really?" Sherlock didn't sound convinced. "Excuse me then, for not introducing myself sooner. My name is Samuel Higgins, this is my friend and colleague Dr Watson. We are here with the police for the investigation of the murder of Mr Woodbridge. One of your colleagues, I suppose, Mr...?"
He would like to think that pyjama pants, an old tee and a dressing gown are just about appropriate for what he is doing. He is working. He can't remember when he has last done that. But it doesn't matter now, he reminds himself, and it doesn't matter what he is wearing, either. No matter if in nightwear or in one of his tailored suit, he is still Sherlock Holmes and he will still be a detective.
"What?"
"Fine! I … apologise." It must have physically hurt Anderson to get this out. He began to make little and careful steps through the room, past Molly and Greg Lestrade. "I'm just going to sit over there now."
. She had since learned that Sherlock wasn't like that, wasn't that kind of man. And that it was fine. He didn't have to be in order for her to care about him. But Sherlock had always seemed so... lonely. His happiness came second, or third or fifth. The work always came first.
John stomps away to the door and opens it with force.
John went on quickly since Smith was making his hairs stand on end, and he had started talking to him from behind the glass with his high nasal voice,
Neither did John. He had ached to see him again, but still, he came unprepared. "You're here?"
"Erm." John didn't know what to say to this.
– for now I knew the weight of a sacrifice. I was too weak to bear it. That's when he found me again."
John must have noticed that Sherlock is staring at him. Question remains, however, if he also catches a glimpse of
John's gaze is open and he smiles up at him. Sherlock is so lost in this dark blue eyes of his, shining and sparkling ridiculously beautiful, reflecting the light of the stars. He tries to focus on the evenly dark sky again, because intense staring at each other in an alley by night is not something John would embrace, he thinks. But the sky, yes, it is almost as fascinating. He has never felt all this: all this freedom. Never has he been truly free, and he knows he isn't now. He is a complete prisoner in his own head, which has him under its full, brutal control at all times. But right now, it is freedom.
When they rounded the corner, Mrs Hudson opened another door for them. John could feel a wave of astonishment rushing over him as they entered a huge sallon that was greeting them in dim light, the ceilings high, and furnished with chairs and round tables. The floor was dark wood and some of the floorboards sighed or grunted beneath the weight of their feet. At the very end of it was a stage with two emerald curtains on each side. There was a handrail, and therefore a second floor, but it was too dark to see if it led anywhere.
"He's... telling the truth," Irene realised.
He went a bit pale there, turning his head to Sally Donovan in some sort of search for moral support. She only frowned back at him and shrugged, the look on her face saying,
"He had me," she murmured, and then, louder, "Parts of me. I remember everything, but it was always a foreign substance that I felt my body shuddering against. I multiplied and multiplied to keep the bits of myself that were still clean, but it has left me weak."
“You’re unbelievable.”
Mrs Hudson knocked on the open door just after she entered, making the gesture quite unnecessary but charming. She looked at her two boys with little surprise and let out a sigh of her own that ended in a loving smile.
"And you know what I do," John added warmly.
John throws his jacket at the back of his chair in obvious distress. It falls off immediately. He is clearly angry with him, Sherlock has observed the ragged breath and flaring nostrils long ago and drawn his conclusions. He wonders what exactly he’s done wrong to upset him so much. The fact that he (technically not quite) stole a boat or that he managed to fall into the Thames? He himself is just upset about having been forced to sacrifice his woollen coat in order to save himself from drowning. Of course, he owns lots of coats. You never know when an accident like this might occur.
More and more knights came running, fleeing out of the street that was now fully covered in a grey fog glistening in the blue moonlight. They positioned around the statue of Cupid, grabbed the shields from their backs and placed them above their heads. The more that came the bigger the circle grew, with Cupid and his bow at the centre. Screams filled the space between them and the smoke, bestial and furious. The smoke had reached the rooftops. Vampyres jumped out of the clouds and ran towards them like they were coming out of nowhere.
of you. To London. We are at war, Sherlock. How?"
He cannot allow himself to moan out loud, so his desperation comes out in quiet whimpers that he tries as good as he can to
Sherlock more or less got the hint now and reached out in reluctance. " … Yes?"
"It won't be necessary, believe me. Just do me a favour, would you?"
"I am a …
"You are not a freelancer, are you?" the man asked, and jolted him out of his thoughts. John was starting to get more and more uncomfortable with the odd curiosity of him. "No," he continued, answering his own question, "No, not with that pretty uniform of yours..."
"Oh. Yes," John replied lamely. Had Sherlock deduced that he had indeed fancied some tea? How had he even known he was coming?
"Hmh?"
"Here, this is what you are. Substitutable."
"With you? Oh, no. Pardon me, this is my work face," he murmured, pretending to be twice as captivated by rolling the bandages around her ankle and heel than he actually was. It was a task he had done a thousand times, could probably carry out in his sleep. "I tried a different face once, but it turns out people get a bit frightened when I'm smiling all over while treating their flesh wounds, so I-"
"I, uhm, I am not actually sure of where it is I need to go."
That warmth shot John right through the chest. "Do you?"
John turned his head as his eyes narrowed in suspicion.
. “No, that’s not it.”
"I demand you speak!"
On his command, the planks beneath Moriarty's feet fell away and he fell with it. John had walked Sherlock backwards and closer towards Moriarty. The guards were just about to grab him and end this fight when suddenly, Sherlock jumped backwards and through the hole Moriarty had fallen through. John's sword missed Sherlock's head by a few calculated inches and tore through the rope instead, bringing Moriarty to his feet beneath him. Below John, Sherlock helped a coughing James Moriarty to get his head out of the noose with the now cut rope that had almost choked him to death.
The elderly lady that was awaiting them behind the transom was wearing a smile that felt so refreshing to John that it made him realise he had not seen an expression so genuine in quite a while now. It made him want to smile back at her, and that feeling on his face appeared to be almost foreign. John liked her in an instant, which was quite remarkable.
"You're just so hot. Your voice, the sounds you make when I reduce to desperation, your body trembling beneath me,
"I'd be very sorry if you had."
"Sherlock, what's wrong?"
, was his explanation, and John had decided that there was little else he could do but to believe him. It was settled that he had now mentally quitted working for this
“I don’t!”
John was still breathing in the wind that struck his face, hoping it may clear his head enough to say something useful. He was sure the look he gave him was one that a man would give a supernova far out on the night's sky – awestruck, marvelling and terrified – and he was so lost for words to describe what he was feeling. There was so much he was seeing in him. So much beauty and hope and
"Are you good?" John asks before he presses a kiss just below his jar.
"Why do you ask, then?"
, sinks his teeth into his flesh and moans, as his movements became frantic and they are so close and wrapped in each other with tangled limbs and desperation, and
"But-"
"Anything ya wanna know, Dr Watson. Ask away."
"What do you mean 'do about this'? There is nothing to do about this," Sherlock insisted.
She took yet another step forward, and John's hand felt the dangerous comfort of his gun against his palm. She was so close and never one with clear intentions. She might either kiss him or bite his head off.
him down,
That smile …
They left the graveyard in conjoined silence and the dove flew off, letting herself be taken by the wind.
The wine arrived as if on cue. Not in the hands of the pretty waiter from before but held by a grey haired, big man with a broad grin on his face.
"No, I did not."
The taller man bid him to follow. The saloon was just as dark as before, and his eyes struggled at first to see in the dim light. All the empty chairs were only underlining the size, the power of it all. But there was one person he knew.
The cab drove off, seemingly in a hurry as soon as John got out. He was standing in front of a dark green door of a red-brick building, approximately three floors high. The numbers on the door were standing out rather charmingly, for they were shining golden in the warm light of a setting sun. He was at Baker Street. This was 221B.
And the rest of existence fizzled away.
"Positively edible." Charles took the sudden liberty of sinking his teeth semi-hard into the firm muscle where his shoulder met his neck and reveled in the shocked exhale of Sherlock's breath through his nostrils.
John scoffed. "You could have just swapped yours and my fake names, been who you wanted. I still could have been David."
John couldn't help but feel slightly saddened by this, the way Sherlock merely accepted his role in something that John's conscience told him he should actively WANT to be a part of. But Sherlock's tone brooked no pity and it was a clear fact that he had simply come to terms with it long ago, made the best of it, and held no grudges against it.
Not even a window had been spared in this bleak tower. Leaving only the sparse and sputtering wall torches to light their way. It gave any who trespassed here the foreboding sense that if they were to go much farther, they would simply tip off the top of the world.
He pressed his palms into the table, taking deep breaths in through his nose to calm himself back down.
John finally turned fully at that, his eyes still boiling in their sockets. But Sherlock could feel the miniscule way he decompressed a bit, and knew he'd already won.
Sherlock's eyes were absolute crystal. "I don't go anywhere John."
Most people squirmed uncomfortably under that look his flatmate gave him, seeming to find it on equal comparison to being flayed alive for inspection, but John found that he simply didn't mind.
Finally the High Steward's eyes drew away and back to his edict, confident that he had made his wishes known. Instilling in John that should he take any action that was contrary to this man or his wishes in any way, regarding anything; it would absolutely result in the end of John Watson's life.
John didn't know what sensation came back to him first; each overlapping as all at once he was slumping, staggering, fighting, and moaning in a terrible, shameless voice that was not his own. A strong arm held him upright, large hands fought his protest, his face was buried against riotous black curls onto to which he openly wept through the pain.
"Sorry?"
Bigger issues pressed back into his mind, unable to be dazzled away any longer.
"As the newly appointed Captain of the Yeomen of the Guards, you are to wear these."
"What have I ever done," John said, placid in a way he had not felt for years, "my whole life, to deserve you?" He could not hope to describe the feeling his chest. Give name to the  happiness that flowed through his veins.
five more fics in the pipeline. not to mention the three currently in progress.
John's thoughts immediately realigned themselves. "Damnit Sherlock." And he snatched the phone away, reading the message before dialing. He stepped out into the sitting room to take it and came back when he was done. "Dr. Banerjee's had a family emergency and Sarah's asked me to come in to cover for him this afternoon. I told her I would. You don't mind, do you?" He said somewhat apologetically, looking at his watch. Space between them would do them both well. "Which means I've got about a fifteen minutes to get to the train."
It carefully surveyed the interior of the circular solar with its empty walls and hollow girth. Its black eyes looking over the only piece of furniture in the room: the imposing oak hulk of the intricately carved four-poster bed set back against the far curve. With its green velvet curtains pulled back to expose its neatly tucked linen sheets, its perfectly folded embroidered silk coverlet, and the perfectly plumped down-filled pillows. Clearly having remained unslept in.
He made quick work on the plain of John's belly, the small wrinkles of folded skin. Smearing his mouth over everything he could reach and finally secured in his knowledge that he'd stalled all he could, he leant up onto his elbows and asked in a hoarse, dark voice. "Enough time has passed, I take it? I'm allowed to make you come and you'll keep your dignity intact?"
Sherlock still ignored him, instead he opened the little book to the front page and scrawled something quickly into it with pointed flicks of his wrist, ensuring that it would be the first thing John read whenever the little book was opened. "After much deliberation on the matter, you really should consider beginning a new list John." He said to him finally, turning the book towards John and showing him that he had written: 'Sherlock Holmes - January 29th 2010'.
He knew deep down that Sherlock wasn't physically ruining anything he deemed of value. The list at the back had long since been burned into his mind. And it wasn't as though he was adding himself to John's death list. But still, he found himself staunchly annoyed. John had pushed up onto his elbows, ready to leap to his feet should he need to. "Sherlock?"
He startles a bit when Sherlock's hand presses against the small of his back. It's the first time since they're conversation at Bart's that Sherlock has touched him so softly. Everything from Buckingham Palace to the hospital until now had been helpful, necessary, strategic, but not soft. And it makes John's heart peel a bit more as to why it's so hesitantly offered.
He led John to the window and took the book from his hands, clearly satisfied that John knew what he would be looking for. He threw the tome a bit carelessly onto the bed before grabbing something else John hadn't been paying enough attention to see when he'd come in.
"Case files?" Lestrade asked, still distracted in his search and with an unlit cigar between his lips.
"How about a hollow client?"
few mistakes was not reading between the lines. Had he done so, he could have realised that with money and magic, trust is always built on fragile grounds."
from it. "Oh, bugger," he said, partially joking, "I left my hat at the house. We have to go back."
Of course, John couldn't tell her that his mood was actually only improving with the help of this one undead detective who was also a genius, and yes, also partially a cyborg these days, and that it had little to do with the tedious work in the clinic. Instead he simply claimed to have moved on, whereupon Sarah told him that the lady must be a lucky woman. That was when John began to think that perhaps he was being a bit too obvious.
They jumped off and circled around Sherlock who was still clinging to John's arms.
John blindly grasps for him until he feels the collar of his woollen coat beneath his fingers and pulls him up in a single motion. He still can’t see anything except for a few stripes of smooth skin that the light outside throws through the door of the locker, but he knows that Sherlock is, probably quite self-satisfied, grinning down at him. He pulls him even closer until his lips brush his ear. He hears Sherlock’s sharp inhale and a grin washes over his own face. Then he goes in to bite down on his earlobe. Sherlock whines.
"Her Majesty's knighthood is currently doing its best to prevent as many of them from breaking through the wall as they can. Dr Watson, I understand you were a part of the Order not long ago."
Something else matters now, and he knows. He knows why he has to solve this. Not because he is
Mycroft sighed. "I know. Just don't do anything stupid."
The grin never leaves John's face and he gives a nod towards the book laying on the living room table. He walks over to it, carefully lets his flat hand slide over the front to fully reveal the cover of the seemingly brand new book underneath a bunch of papers, letters and note sheets. "
John definitely eyes him up and down and up and down again, and he definitely looks pleased with what he sees. Why does this cause a rather pleasant twitch in Sherlock's gut?
"Sorry." John had just stepped on Sherlock's foot.
"What is he doing here?" John breathed.
Irene's eyes widened in pleasant surprise.
"Then why are you here?!"
Sherlock shivers at this and he feels goosebumps running down his arms. There are shivers, running down his spine, there are sparks trying to blind him, and his heart beats and beats so fast he can't move.
John tries to adjust to the fact that his life is now regulated by different kinds of maniacs. He decides to be where Sherlock Holmes needs him to, and once he realises that Moriarty will put his dubious plans into action much sooner than they expected, he knows that there is no other way. He has to be involved and fight.
"You're not a soldier, you are a doctor."
John let out a sigh, having hoped the detective would pick up on the actual message behind his words. "Look," he tried again. "I've met people like you before."
So that's why he is shocked,
He has lowered his newspaper, so that he can give him a once-over, which makes Sherlock feel as naked as he just has been barely ten minutes ago. At least he did have the decency to put on a dressing gown (the blue one, his and John's favourite, he had deduced this quite a while ago), but right now that does not help at all.
"He tried to persuade me into working with him again. Argued that Victor's death served a greater cause, and only I could help him explore it."
When he finally comes back to himself, he just sinks to his knees and inhales deeply, shaking and a ringing in his ears confuses his senses. The water washing away the mess he made. The ceramic of the tub is hard and uncomfortable. He doesn't give any damn about it.
by a strange woman. He should have asked the
. Human then. A human being among these dark halls, living in the basement? Or was it a prisoner? Who would imprison someone in a place like this?
He stretches all his limbs and rolls onto his side to throw an arm over his eyes. In his unconscious state he tries to pull the covers up once more, but he's puzzled for a moment when he realises that he isn't wearing any clothes. The bedsheets around the lower part of his body feel warm and tender. They feel so close without any layers between the fabric and his own skin, and he lets out a soft breath of contentment while his head is sinking deeper into the pillow.
"You don't think he is?"
He feels so small. Seconds elapse and he keeps on staring into the sky, starts to find himself trying to count stars, trying to disguise his attempts with logic. Trying to calculate if it is really possible for him to see millions of stars at the same time, when he has just established that it isn't, that it doesn't even come close. And yet, he can't get over the feeling that if he would have the time, he would count every single star to prove himself wrong.
He knows that the shape of the universe looks quite like a brain cell. He knows that a full moon is nine times brighter than a half moon. He knows space is not a complete vacuum, because there are about three atoms per cubic metre of space, and that there are as many oxygen atoms in a breath as there are breaths of air in the atmosphere. He knows that the sun burns hundreds of tons of hydrogen every second. He knows that Saturn is the only planet of all planets in the solar system that would float on water. He knows that the universe is rarely so lazy. (Not now - go away, Mycroft!)
"Alright. I'll... see you then." He supposed that was where they parted ways for the time being. But Sherlock called him back, baffled amusement in his voice.
John tried to process this. Before his arrival, he would have liked to say he had seen the most harrowing, the most horrific, the oddest of the odd. Yet he felt weak for being shaken by Sherlock's words. But he was. And how he was. He knew things were hardly always what they seemed to be at first glance, but to imagine a dancer with a pretty face turning out to be a villainous creature was anything but easy.
John wasn't sure in how far that was actually flattering. "Thank you?"
Sherlock stares. Sherlock blinks. His mind stays blank for a worryingly long amount of time. Then he remembers. He’s wet. Soaked, in fact, completely down to his bones, and freezing too. It’s taken him a little long to catch up because these words, words spoken in the tone of an army captain, are something he’s last heard two days ago, half asleep and desperate in his own bedroom. Another one of those nights in which his imagination filled in for the needs that reality doesn’t meet.
He began to move, stepping closer to the stage, and watched in genuine surprise as the people started to step back, making room for him to get through. If there was one moment he had wished for attention, it would literally be any but this one. He met Irene's eyes as he reached the stage, her smile scarier in its falsehood than anything she could have done to him. Soon he stood in line next to James Moriarty to his right and the witch to his left, forcing himself to look as far from uncomfortable or outright horrified as he could manage.
All of a sudden, he seemed to realise what he was sitting on, grimacing as the paper rustled beneath his buttocks. "What am I even doing?"
"On what?"
And then, suddenly, he dropped out of the narrative.
Now Donovan had finally taken notice of who else was in the room with them. "Oh, bloody hell!"
John's heart jumped against his ribcage.
Anderson looked once again over his shoulder to Donovan, but she was avoiding his gaze. Instead of her, Molly was the one to face him now. She stepped up to him, displaying all the anger that John had tried so hard to suppress. "You may leave any time you like."
"Oh no, I didn't- I've only met him," John started explaining and reflecting for himself as he thought about how long he knew that man, "...yesterday." He felt like it could have been months.
John couldn't have been more impressed. "That's Silverblaze," he said. "The General's horse. I've read about it."
. But having a man as clever, as brilliant and intelligent as Sherlock Holmes right in front of him who doesn't know, or rather doesn't care, about something as big as the solar system, has always fascinated him. He will never stop being able to do this to him.
He could not believe his own eyes as he turned around and found himself even more surprised by how naturally he stood up and gave his old friend a smile. When his expression changed to confusion, the man began trying to explain himself.
"Yes, he figured it out. There is no doubt it is him."
In the moment of unveiling, the shadow of a dark cloud revealed itself as a shock of hair, untamed on top and now illuminated by the dim light like an auburn halo above his head. John himself was the target of piercing eyes shifting in colour, holding a knowing gleam and brightness. Pale skin was stretched over sharp cheekbones, and full lips formed a small, intrigued smile. The man was dressed in white linen, a rough fabric, crumpled from where he had to have lain down on the ground.
Before Lestrade could answer, Sally Donovan stood up. "Not quite. Even if it may appear otherwise there are not enough of them to circle the entire city. They are moving in circles growing smaller, like a spiral. Look," she explained and marked the recent attacks in chronological order. They all drew closer around the table to watch.
that has happened in the shower earlier...
of her, why she is able to come back. She has the skin of a snake. This is what she is."
John was not surprised. He had long assumed that Lestrade had to have picked up on it, or that at the very least Molly Hooper must have given him a hint. Yet, as he looked over, he saw that the very great and very good Sherlock Holmes was sitting there with wide eyes and a faint blush travelling up his cheeks. Then he shook his head and smiled.
But not what he was searching for. Not what he wanted to see.
"There he is!"
Sherlock took a deep breath. "Lestrade and I have made a deal a long while ago. I used to solve cases for him – still do, in fact – but things became … stranger around London. He and I both noticed. Whenever they couldn't make sense of a crime committed, they consulted me, but Lestrade was the only officer smart enough to know that when even I failed to connect the dots, because there
but that wasn't so easy when there was coffee in one's mouth. He put the mug down on his desk, which was completely overflooded with what appeared to be the papers and case files. "Oh, so you really are a colleague then? And I even thought you are far too well dressed and clean-shaven for a rough sleeper! Smelling better, too."
It’s Sherlock about to give a blowjob in DI Lestrade’s office. Obviously, this stupid idea involves John. Hence, giving him joy will give Sherlock
John goes over to the living room table. Then he stops in his tracks. It’s happened again, hasn’t it? More and more often he finds himself giving Sherlock silly petnames in his head. He was never a friend of those, can hardly explain why he is doing it now –
"How are you?"
, actually. Provided that you will let me
"Do you feel alive?" he asked quietly, not wanting to risk blemishing a question of such sensitivity with a voice too loud or too harsh. He didn't know but found himself desperately wanting to know what it was like for him, what he felt, thought about having been exploited like this. Of being out of his body but still in his own mind.
"Actually, I think this is more of a meteor shower. I mean, there are lots of them up there. Haven't seen something like that in decades. Maybe we're having a special night or..." John lets his gaze wander to the brilliant view he is talking about. He begins to feel much less pressured when he is avoiding thinking about being the centre of Sherlock's attention. But soon, Sherlock follows his lead and watches the sky just as closely.
"And why is that?"
"And of course," Moriarty's voice came through again, exclaiming loudly, "What a show it would be without our beautiful jewel in the crown: Ms Irene Adler!"
When John did not move, she threw him a glance over her shoulder. "You staying here won't do him any good, you know?"
"Well, now you do. Feel free to leave anytime."
"Oh, and pardon me for keeping you from your work for just a moment longer, but then again, I'm not actually sorry. There is one more person worth noting, and I think they deserve their little round of applause as well for what they're doing here."
was only a minor idea to get used to in comparison to what would follow, of that John was certain.
," Mycroft was pleading. Never in his life had he done that. "Please. Look at me."
. It did not feel like it. Looking out of the window, it did not look like it. It looked like every other day in London. But the streets were empty. What was a city without its citizens? There was one question he really wanted to ask, though.
Sherlock's eyes were empty and, for the first time, truly cold.
"You know Mrs Hudson? Is she all right?" Sherlock asked, sounding so human for a second that it startled John.
"Simple. By killing them all."
"Sherlock, sorry. I'm sorry, did I do something wrong?" He hears John's soft, apologetic voice over the droning noises chasing each other in his head.
"This is exactly how they wanted us," Sherlock growled.
It was a surprise, therefore, that Sherlock's next words had absolutely nothing to do with what he had said to him just a minute ago.
to know about me." She let out a huffed chuckle at the end of this sentence, and he thought he had seen her wink at him.
"If we hadn't listened to your nonsense in the first place, maybe an innocent man wouldn't have died!"
But Donovan spoke first. "You really should leave."
“I thought you didn’t like my jumpers?”
John blinked up at him, forcing himself to take in the words he was saying and to recognise the reality of him being here, with Sholto, after all this time.
as the back of his head banged against the door. In the few seconds of dizziness from the impact he didn't realise that he was being pulled up and
The man tried to look the other way, believing for a second he could still come up with an excuse. Sherlock was having none of it. "Oh please, I could hear your disparaging snort from where I was standing."
He pulled James Moriarty from her caring hands and shoved him towards Molly. "I'm warning you-"
Sherlock's eyes were wide open and blue. He was staring into a pair full of aquamarine water, one side sprinkled with two drops of amber. They hadn't been there before, the sprinkles and the tears. His replica had not captured him in all that he was. From then on he knew. He knew this was Sherlock Holmes,
Only seconds later, he hears how the bathroom door quietly closes and steps coming closer, but he just tries to press his head deeper into the blue fabric. A low chuckle finally throws him out of his sleepy state. Because he recognises the voice and suddenly he is wide awake and the smell around him is even stronger than before.
John pictured Moriarty with a hundred pairs of eyes and shuddered. Something about this story did not add up at all. "You tried to...
"Mr Holmes!"
After being chased around London by the responsibilities he has imposed on himself, John goes to face the most challenging task of today: Meeting Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard and, to everyone's great surprise, a few more new and old faces than expected.
"Jesus.
myself. By the time I had gathered a new wardrobe, they had enough new information, including information about you. I knew, of course, that you are currently also working at a clinic near Brook Street. Obviously, you wouldn't have quit your job there yet, so you will go there first tomorrow. And yes, obviously you would have a cheap flat located farther away from Central London. You were sent home from war and the Order might be generous, but not that generous. Any further questions?"
. Of course, Tom was the third one missing.
He held the ear out for John to take like he had done with the eyeball and waited, for once patiently, until John opened his eyes again and looked at him. His gaze was open and maybe even a bit apologetic. It hit him, just then, that there was Sherlock was actually placing in him was his trust. That he was everything he had left. He could have turned away, could have killed him even, for knowing his secret, but instead he had decided to confide only more secrets to him.
the gun!
"Dr Watson," he said in his paper-thin voice. "You remember. I'm honoured."
The bathroom door flings open and Sherlock almost takes a hit to the head. He steps back a bit and gulps as he locks eyes with John. His grin could be described as
"Dr Watson!"
is almost enough for him to get off on. He keeps stroking him, pulling back his foreskin.
He held out a hand for him before John had gotten the hint to get up and introduce himself properly, rather than being introduced by the one he should get to know. The chair gave an uncomfortable squeak as its legs stroke the floorboards. John took his hand as long as it was still being offered, and then they all stood together a little tensely. Mrs Hudson had excused herself quietly.
What? Who fell? The only fallen person he knew was … But hadn’t their just talked about…
But what does it actually look like? There are four more or less logical possibilities.
"You were kidnapped twice during the last forty-eight hours, endured life as James Moriarty's prisoner one night and day, followed by the introduction to my insufferable brother. Are
John swallows loudly behind him, makes a wanton noise in the back of his throat. "Holy
The Fall. The Wedding.
"But-"
"Oh, you would have found another way to bring me here, I have no doubt. But you didn't. You thought this was funny." He sounded more bitter, more rough than he was aiming for. He wasn't that angry. It was, after all, kind of impressive of him having pulled that off.
He pushes in farther. Sherlock feels the burning sensation returning with every extra inch John pushes into him, he feels himself opening around him, and the more John glides inside, the more he stretches because the size of him only seems to increase. And he hasn't even taken half of it yet.
John was exhausted from all the new faces and being on his feet for so long, not being used to it anymore, but he was still gleaming at her praise. She was too kind to be
"And since when can you do that?"
"James..."
A great wave of heat is washing over him, his skin tingling from the surprising but not entirely uncomfortable sensation. Whenever John is moving against him, another wave rushes over his whole body. The air between them keeps getting hotter and almost uncomfortably tropic. That is, if Sherlock could give the slightest damn about something as irrelevant as atmospheric humidity right now. All he cares about is John, John's hands, John's mouth, their hips moving together, and when they suddenly find the perfect angle he lets out an embarrassingly loud groan. John's pyjama trousers are thin and he isn't even sure if he is wearing anything underneath, but all he knows is that everything between them is still too much.
Insecurity turns into panic, and his face looks even paler than would be considered healthy. How would he be supposed to go out there? John is out there, possibly naked and possibly still manipulated by some sort of higher power he never dared to believe in, but if you eliminate the impossible then-
Sherlock pulled him by the hand and shot one last glance into the room, which was now completely invaded by this wild cluster. They were running towards the window full speed ahead. Somewhere in the back of his head a small voice tried to tell him that this was the point of no turning back. They had to break through, they had to jump. He didn't think about it. He didn't try to think anything because he knew that if he dared to think about it, he would stop, hesitate, and this would be the end.
"Who is there?"
"You realise the insanity of it all, don't you, Sherlock?" Mycroft stomped after the angry detective, followed by Lady Anthea who did not bat an eye.
"Major." He saluted.
"Come along, John!"
Sherlock was about to interrupt him, but at John’s last words he stopped himself and eyed him with interest. As though anyone else he had met before had told him that there were plenty of things wrong with that. With him.
"I am sorry I lost you," Mycroft said.
"Substitutable." She was coming closer.
"You have already died once, Sherlock," John breathed in awe and despair. "You are not going to die on me, too."
"Let me show you how much you mean to me," John whispers gently, tickles his skin. "I want to show you that I love you more than anything in this world."
All be damned, his words were like an incantation spoken to summon him. It worked perfectly. "Oh God,
. Sherlock was still sucking it all in, out and in. And then he saw him.
He has said his name for the third time now, and John realises that his brain is now activily refusing to process anymore. For the moment, it has narrowed down to facts about Atropa belladonna when, in fact, it should finally start to
"Who is 'we'?"
Irene got up and ambled through the room until she was by the door. She turned around before she left him with another wink, "James is going to be delighted!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I have answers."
And Sherlock whimpers again in desperation, but then John’s thumb is stroking the head of his cock, gripping it tighter between thumb and the side of his finger, and Sherlock makes a strangled sound in the back of his throat.
“Is this a threat or a promise?”
Moriarty somehow felt the need to speak up from where he was lying to Irene's feet. She was still stroking his cheek, closing the wounds, it seemed.
What John heard Mycroft say was,
"Did you find anything?"
He was not as good at this as he had thought. The man was getting much more out of him even when John thought he was giving him nothing. That was proof enough that he and Sherlock were related, but this information did not help him at all.
"And how would you know that?" he asked and turned around to face her again.
He caught him.
He feared he would hear another apology from Sherlock. He didn’t need to hear more of them anymore. He had forgiven him a long, long time ago, and he hated that he still dreamed of Sherlock’s regrets and mistakes. It didn’t do any good to anyone, after all.
Not very helpful, though, as he doesn't care about the world in general, never has. He cares about John, only ever John, who is, unfortunately, the one sharing this space with him, and now he has finally drawn his attention. Goddamnit.
, he hopes. But the scent. Masculine and somehow incredibly sweet, something too holy to lick off him, but he would try. He wouldn't even hesitate and try and lick and taste. Everywhere.
That was exactly the kind of attitude that John had wanted to avoid. "I would not, actually, no," murmured John, not in any way motivated enough to engage in this discussion about human rights and prejudices.
because of the way they had looked at each other earlier. Nothing would surprise him anymore.
John nodded in silent acknowledgement. The past was the past. He himself needed to learn this once more now. The past is much more than a fragment of ourselves but sometimes it had to be left behind in order to see a future.
The Criterion was loud and stuffed at this time of day. Or evening, to be more precise. John had arrived by train in London around noon, threw his one piece of luggage onto the small bed by mid-day to leave the petty flat that the Order had provived for him, and walked out of the building as soon as he had thrown on a pair of new clothes. Standing out was about as far down on his list of desirable events for this night as it could be.
He eyed the hand in front of him with suspicion. And yet, he did not back away. "I am not going to carry you,
. For a few quiet minutes, he would have done anything to fall asleep and embrace death. Lying here with a cold body, it felt like the only right thing to do was to become a corpse himself, for someone to find them like this. Rotting away together. But soon, something began to feel... unsettling. Sherlock Holmes had just died. It felt so strange thinking it just like that. There was no weight to the statement. But there should be. There should be an unbearable weight to it that came at least close to what John was feeling. There should be acknowledgement. A sign in the sky that showed the world England's greatest man had fallen and everyone should bow their heads in mourning. The sun should not shine for at least a week, dipping the world in blackness. Instead, here they were. Alone.
The taller man still held his arm in his other hand and gave a huff. "Not how people usually characterise me. They tend to mistake my sharp tongue for discourtesy." He waved the arm that was unmounted from his shoulder blade, gesturing through the room with it as he was pacing. "To think they knew anything about the detective who solves their murders... But I am not so obvious a trick."
Sherlock doesn't know why he can't hear himself speak up again. He always makes sure the last word of a conversation, of an argument, it can be nothing more than a friendly discussion, but the very last word must be on his tongue. Not this time. Because everything is so different with John and he knows it. They know it. Which is why they are gracefully listening to the rare silence in a darkened alley.
“You’re my posh boy now,” John murmurs right before he feels himself drift away.
Now his initial paranoia seemed a little silly. Still, he did have a slight distaste for lifts. Especially those going underground. There was an uneasiness growing within him, but now a hand was brushing his own, and as he looked down he was surprised to find Sherlock's hand next to it. It grounded him, set him back into the present and out of his head. His stomach felt funny. He knew the man liked to pretend he lacked a certain kind of empathy, but he could undeniably feel John enough to know when to bring him back to him.
"Then leave, for all I care, if you're so displeased with how the real work is done!"
John looked up at Sherlock and nodded.
"Why do I care so much?" he mumbled against the glass.
But did he say sorry? No, this is all wrong! John has nothing to feel sorry for, it's all Sherlock's fault. And yes, he admits it. Because he has to, and because it's the truth. Running through London in the middle of the night, taking John with him and get absolutely nothing out of it, because he
“You always did.”
Sherlock blinked. Once, twice. His voice nothing more than an untamed rumble.
Kate crossed her arms in front of her chest, obviously upset. "Not I," she stated shortly. "James Moriarty did."
John is still not looking down. There is a reason for this, apparently, and he wouldn't have to wait long to open his cloudy mind up and give in to the things he should've seen sooner. "Look up."
"Well then..."
himself to be just the brain. To live alone and swallow down those looks that people would give him. Looks that said everything by people who kept their mouths shut, because they still needed his help. That's what he was there for, after all.
The image of it was quite sharp. There was just a drop of purple liquid on white ground. But when he concentrated and looked closely, he could see that there was movement to it. "It's moving?"
John kisses his neck again now, hungrily, and he loses it. His long fingers run through the short grey strands over and over (they look golden in the firelight, he notes absently), and the lower John sinks down on him to kiss and lick the skin where shoulder meets neck, above his collarbones, above his solar plexus now, the less friction Sherlock can get out of his movements, the less effectively he can press his throbbing erection against John's body.
The door clunked shut, and John was left in a room that was far too enormous to not feel lonely all of a sudden. His hand was still buried in his bag, but he couldn't find what he was searching for.
Lestrade led them through a hallway and they passed by other police officers who were standing guard. When they came into a small room, he closed the door behind them and took off his brown suit jacket. Underneath he was wearing a light blue shirt with narrow, vertical stripes and a brown waistcoat fitting his jacket and trousers.
Sherlock has begun taking drugs again which have somehow damaged the synapses in his brain and therefore manipulated his memories.
But he didn't think. The only command that could control him now was in Sherlock's voice. And there it was.
He does. Sherlock does
And John found himself out of the lift in about two seconds. Sherlock must have been very proud of himself. Catching up with him, he wondered if the detective had this effect on everyone he met or if it was just him. Into the black they went. John strained his ears at every sound, a soldier’s habit, but it was only shoes on stone. Yet, he still almost walked into Lestrade.
"Well. After you, then," John more ordered than suggested, "Feel free to lead the way."
"Shut up."
"Hah!" Mrs Hudson laughed at that. "You are probably the first who listens to a story of Sherlock Holmes and try to make sense of him. Had he known you, my dear doctor..."
"Who- er, Mary. Ms Mary Morstan."
It was fast, but he would shoot it. This was war.
When John got up to put back the utilities, he intended to do so slowly, so that he could keep his back turned to her. Innocent flirtation drifted down the road of something that made him feel examined and dismantled in a way he passionately hated, in a way that made his skin boil. He could hear Mary putting her shoes back on while he was opening and closing various drawers to kill time and possibly this thing that hung in the air between them.
"Sherlock," John warned him and then addressed the General. "It is good to see you again."
"May I have this dance?" He didn't demand this time. He asked. Putting himself in a position in which the answer could be a rejection, could be a
"And my bag!"
"Oh no," Sherlock breathed.
"This whole thing is a set up trap and we fell for it," John realised and hated himself for underestimating them. Now that they had found their vampyre queen, they had found strength.
Sherlock snorted. "True. Though she stayed longer than we have." He looked at his own hands, before warmly meeting John's eyes again. "And I've got you."
Once she turned her head in his direction, she smiled weakly. "Oh yes, dear. Just a little overworked, that is all."
“Have
engraved in it.
"I know," Sherlock said, like he had known him forever.
The room nodded in silent grief. Then they gulped it all down.
he actually got here, he noticed something. Looking left and right to ensure no one was paying him any attention, he walked towards it. He had not been mistaken – the door was open! Just like the first time he was here, the door was open just a gap. Had something happened? A break-in?
) must have felt in the one moment, from the very first second when the feeling would sink in, to the when he finally realised it was too late. The moment James Sholto had found him bleeding out on the dirty ground. He didn't want to think about the sight that at other occasions he would have craved, treasured. The sight of the mask shattering, desperation clinging to his voice as he yelled out and shot the monster that did this to him.
. Someone to wake up to. Something he cares more about than the work, the cases, silencing the loud noises in his buzzing head. These days, his head is buzzing quietly. So, luckily, nowadays he is more than fine with being wrong sometimes. If the result is only half as fulfilling as this.
Now his head snapped around. It was hard to think of something to say to this. That was rare.
“I love you.” A kiss. “I love you, Sherlock. I love you.”
"John."
“Sherlock-”
"I think I could've caught him. When he was running around the corner, that could've been the moment."
John nodded, taking the glass in hand, examining it with half-hearted interest as emerald transformed into a lighter shade of green.
This time, though, he only seemed to have scared his receptionist a little.
Sherlock scrunched his nose and sniffed the air. John did so involuntarily and coughed.
Sherlock read it from his eyes. "Can you not imagine why?"
"Do not fire!" she told her men.
Clouds were shoving one another in front of the sun, making the sky appear like a chaos of grey, blue and white. A weather almost as English as the storm that had accompanied him for the first part of his ride, and one John Watson could as well approve of. One could nearly conjecture where the famous outline of familiar London might have hidden behind dark clouds of the steam the train breathed out. Being back here at last always felt like coming home, even though home was rather associated more with people than places.
"And if you are not doing it for me," Sherlock said, "do you at least want to feel it again? The thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through your veins like it used to?"
And even though John climbs in the double bed on his own, he feels happiness stretching a smile across his face. He knows he will fall asleep twice tonight.
"God, I've missed you so much." His voice is muffled by having his face buried in the fabric of Sherlock's coat. He is a little surprised to find he is crying, but when he looks up he sees that Sherlock is, too.
Offence now very visibly taken. "You don't believe me?" He lets out a groan as if in pain when John isn’t answering, then starts off to explain himself with an insult. "Really, sometimes I don’t know why some of you people were given a brain if you’re not planning on using it. Sister, John! It was obvious as soon as he started to mention his ex-girlfriend. He was convinced his sister was avoiding them every time he had her over because they don’t get along. He said those were the only other times when he didn't see much of his sister for a long time before her disappearance, completely missing the obvious here, of course. He sees less and less of his sister for the time he’s in a relationship, then after the ex dumps him it's only a matter of days that it takes for his sister to be ‘missing’? She and his ex weren’t avoiding each other because they didn’t get along. They did so because they couldn’t stand their feelings for each other with him clearly standing in their way. Now that he is not an obstacle anymore, they have started an affair, possibly even before, and she is afraid of how he will react to that, so she is hiding at his ex’s and now her girlfriend's place to flee from her responsibilities. Solved."
Sherlock takes a long shower after this incident. No, not because he has to take care of something. (Well, technically yes, but not in the good way. John was still in the kitchen after all and he had to cool down.)
Just as Sherlock feels his chest rising and falling quicker and more uncontrolled and the frustration starting to boil inside his veins, creeping up his neck, there are suddenly steady hands on both his hips and something warm is pressing up against his back.
"I'm staying." Sherlock's tone left no room for objection.
"Murder investigation at the museum," he explained then, surprisingly underwhelmed considering how much he loved those.
So his answer, thanks to John, only turns out to be a string of desperate moans in different pitches.
"Begging your pardon, Doctor...?"
Occasionally Sherlock doesn’t even let John change before he is on him, longingly rubbing his cheek against the soft fabric of his jumper. John lets out a wholehearted chuckle.
In the middle of the screams and the sound of the licking flames and explosions, John heard Moriarty's voice.
Sherlock swallows down the big lies he was going to tell John. (
without having told a word to anyone. He wouldn't have expected him to have many friends, and he didn't have to wonder why.
John gave a sharp nod. She was right. Irene Adler might have the talent of storytelling and reading minds, but a battle was not her field of expertise. Luckily, it was his. Taking a look at the map on the table, his gaze shifted over to Lestrade.
On the next note he pressed him closer and they were chest to chest. Sherlock's mouth fell open by a gap, his eyes widened a little. Had he impressed him? He wanted to ask,
And it's a wrap! A MASSIVE thank you to all the readers, who have left comments and Kudos, you've been a true inspiration during that journey <3 <3 <3
In short – the perfect evening.
“Let’s face the facts – in one way or another, everyone uses Sherlock for his own purpose. Even his brother does!”
Step by step, he got closer to his target, until he could have picked it up if he wanted to.
John doesn’t want to hear him anymore.
He couldn’t believe his ears. Or his eyes, for that matter.
For all the time they have known each other, Greg has only set foot once or twice in Mycroft’s office. He remembered very well however the unpleasant impression which struck him every time he did. The feeling of fitting in in this stately, delicately luxurious environment – nothing crude or over-the-top about it, it wasn’t really Mycroft’s style – as well as a bull in a china shop.
“Unless it’s meant for you?” he asked, stirring sugar into his cup.
“Stop calling me that!”
Then, without waiting for John’s answer, he turned on his heel and rushed again upstairs.
“I don’t know!” Sherlock practically wailed.
“Stop.”
Except that, if John’s theory was correct, Sherlock has precisely done so before."
And it's OVER! *throw confetti*.
“Nice establishment,” Poshy retorted, who obviously didn’t believe a word of it. “But that’s a private affair between me and my little brother.”
“Harry… I don’t want to fight, okay?”
He cursed his inability to express himself. Of all times to find himself short of words!
“Shhhh,” John softly said. And without thinking about it too long, he silenced him with the tender touch of his forefinger on Sherlock’s mouth. A calm as strange as it was unexpected suffused John’s soul as he observed the ever-changing landscape of Sherlock’s eyes – widening in surprise before becoming shockingly open and trusting.
“Oi, you fucker! I forbid you to destroy anything else, you hear me? Not my fault you made a mistake…”
She suddenly stopped, staring at him with hard eyes, cheeks still flushed.
“I’m afraid it’s a kind of family business…”
“That’s not my doing, all right? Mycroft sent us both here and…”
He could hold his liquor, after all. No problem, he snorted, trying to get up from the very comfortable, a bit misshapen blue sofa taking up half the place in his living room. After a few unsuccessful minutes during which his legs were apparently wobbling for no reason, he finally managed to stand up, shooting a victorious grin at the small statuette which has gained a place of honour on the shelf after Greg’s last moving.
She snorted.
“Mycroft?”
“Good. Come on then, let’s eat while it’s still hot.”
“How are you?” he suddenly asked.
He has rarely heard Sherlock’s voice laced with so much venom.
He rolled his eyes. His brother was
It was only a whisper but John grinned, especially when he could feel Sherlock’s hand stroking once again his hard member at a much slower pace.
A surge of heat made Joan arch up into her lover. Sherlock took this opportunity to roll them over, lying flat on her back. She put her hands on Joan’s arse, lightly squeezing her cheeks.
He laboriously typed, cursing his clumsy fingers when he had to go back to erase some typo.
“Joan, you’re really an idiot.”
“What do you say, John? Can we take this risk together? Because if you think for one second I’m not as involved as you are…”
Lost in his thoughts, Sherlock hasn’t been aware that his companion has come closer. From where they stood, a single lamplight revealed John smiling at him.
When people looked at John Watson, they often only saw the man tagging Sherlock. They made fun of him, shaking their heads with amused pity. Some well-intentioned souls have even tried to warn him against Sherlock, whispering in his ear or frankly saying, not bothering to lower their voices, even when Sherlock could hear them.
He gave up midway, his mind buzzing with such obscure terms he was quite sure half his teachers at St Bart’s would have been lost as well.
“Will”, she said, pronouncing his name in a way which made John frown, “if you would be so kind to listen to this gentleman…”
He pulled his own phone out of his pocket and without thinking about it too much, he called the DI. Lestrade answered just in time before Sherlock got the recorded message.
He turned round just in time to catch a glimpse of a flat, white belly disappearing under a T-shirt - “Don’t keep calm, just go crazy!”
“No problem,” Ross answered. “Good luck for revising. And you know, if you need to take a break, you can always check his website.”
He needed to touch him like he needed air.
He might be a nutter, but John had to admit this guy had balls. Appropriate compensation, indeed. He gave a snort of laughter while typing
A feeling so powerful that it would drive him to his knees, tears sliding down his cheeks, if he dared to dwell on it.
She wanted to hurt him as much as she could.
He replied instead “I’m still here, yes.”
Interest.
“But I think now that they changed their tactics,” Greg carried on, oblivious of John’s train of thought.
“Irene?”
He admired the fact that his voice didn’t shake, didn’t betray his nerves.
9 a.m. – that’s tomorrow morning by the way – whatever is contained in the box will be automatically destroyed.”
“Please what?” Sherlock groaned in his ear. “Tell me you’re hungry for my cock. Tell me you want me to fuck you until you see stars.”
“What’s so remarkable about it?” he has replied before swallowing the rest of his beer in a gulp, taking the time to calm himself down. “Don’t know if you’ve noticed it, but he
He has believed himself stronger than anyone.
Whichever question Mike had in store for him didn’t seem to interest Will, as he didn’t look up from the list he was currently examining. Amidst his embarrassment, John felt a surge of annoyance – what was so interesting in this bloody list, anyway?
At this moment, John would have given everything to be able to flee and never come back to the
“It already does.”
“Don’t tell me you sent him off on holiday. Because, in this case, John Watson deserves all my sympathy!”
“You know it is, why do you ask then?”
“A little bit. Such a drama queen – she had all the necessary proof to put Cox under lock and key. His fingerprints on the tableware, all the hints he couldn’t stop himself from dropping during our little chat…”
“Oh. That’s lovely”, John replied, already wondering how he could get rid of the old codger before he tried to tell him his whole life.
“And how…?”
“Watson. But I’m not a captain any longer.”
Completely delicious.
The man who has ordered his guards to throw him out of his office before he later that day set foot in Greg’s flat and kissed him.
But no.
Goodness.
“You’ve already said that.”
because Detective Inspector Lestrade has been babbling about, no doubt recasting the events in such a way that Mycroft found himself the butt for ridicule.
Gosh. What was he trying to do, exactly?
His voice.
Irene squeezed Molly’s hand in a way she hoped was soothing. She noticed that the other woman didn’t seem uncomfortable. Neither did she try to move away.
“Sherlock,” he repeated in the most authoritative voice he could muster, “I swear to God if you’re not out in five minutes, I’d suggest your name as godfather the moment Greg and your brother’ll speak about adoption.”
“I’m all right, John, thanks,” he replied.
Mycroft looked at him oddly.
. He entertained himself for a while trying to discern a sign, a clue which would reveal enough about their owners and he would deduce the rest. But it was getting too dark and thanks to the lights around the Honeybee’s bar, it was simply too tempting to glance at John’s reflection in the window.
Molly shook his head, a light smile playing on her lips when she imagined the scene. If Irene was right, Sherlock would certainly endure months – even years – of relentless teasing.
Dave must have made a mistake. Or the camellia, for all its red loveliness, has another more scientific – or more strategic – meaning.
Or rather he would have exploded as soon as they have left the crime scene, ranting at Sherlock until being left out of breath.

All of this faded from his sight however when, turning his head, forgetting his usual caution, he met John’s gaze.
“The address is 221b Baker Street and the name is Sherlock Holmes.”
His lover chose this moment to put his forefinger into his hole alongside with his tongue.
UST? Which UST? I don't know what you're talking about...
“Hey, mate. You ok?”
“Won’t you at least tell me what happened?”
“Come back here,” John growled, furious with himself.
It was after, when she saw John’s devastated face, Mrs Hudson’s tears, the black coffin that she knew to be empty that Molly started to realize what she has done.
It abruptly stopped a few weeks ago in Hory, a little town in Byelorussia, a few miles away from the Russian border.
“Come along, my brave soldier.”
Joan gaped at her before pushing Sherlock away. She took a few steps back – it was better for them both if they remained apart from each other at this moment.
“I never said…”
“Yes but…”
“It was signed into law by Putin on 30 June 2013.”
“Sherlock, I…”
Greg nodded.
He walked back home slowly, his mind buzzing with all kinds of possibilities, from the most logical ones to the most far-fetched, concerning the small wooden object currently holed up in his pocket.
I loved you. There, I've said it. Took me long enough.
When Irene's sweetness is discussed.
“I got you, John, it’s okay… Everything’s okay…”
Or perhaps it was the thought which has started to take shape in his mind – a thought which made his heart constrict and pulse hard in his chest.
He can hear him breathing hard, as if he has run all the way from the cold gates of Death til Baker Street’s safe haven. He’s getting closer, John realizes with a start.
You’ve branded me as yours, Sherlock, since this very first day and I’m only sorry I never dared to acknowledge it until today.
– for this man, who in the blink of an eye, has turned his touch from alluring to reassuring.
“You seem very sure of yourself,” Sherlock quietly replied, observing the first participants in the
That for once he hasn’t lied?
Lost in thought, he trudged across the pavement, already groping for his keys when he heard the chime of his mobile.
“Brilliant.”
The rule is clear – he says “No”, she obeys. Or rather she tries to. Not her fault the gifts under the Christmas tree last month were so shiny, after all.
It was maddening. It was passionate. It was also suffused with a tenderness John has rarely experienced with his former lovers. He closed his eyes, his mouth seeking Sherlock’s until their lips met again in a crushing kiss.
He calls out her name, just to be sure.
During a fleeting moment, the image of John – golden-haired, blue-eyed, lovely John – danced before his eyes, but it soon faded, replaced with dreams he has long kept jealously for himself, for fear someone – like Mycroft, for instance – would find out and deride them.
“Would you like to join us, Miss Watson?”
Joan stared at the screen of her mobile phone.
John approached it slowly, finding back his reflexes of soldier, back in Afghanistan, when he had to enter an area which had not been yet secured. If anyone had seen him at this moment, he would certainly have come across as completely ridiculous, considering suspiciously this inoffensive bouquet as if a bomb was hidden in it. But John didn’t care.
“Gotcha!” he growled before taking the Browning out of his holster and aiming it at his prey who was currently pinned below him.
“Sherlock, I’m sorry. I’m sorry to have said what I said…”
I’m going to tell you everything I’ve just written here.
“Gladly,” Mycroft whispered, looking around him with a faint air of distaste. “But first, I have to talk to you.”
Ross didn’t take offence at his tone.
The wonder washing across John’s features – which counted among John’s expressions Sherlock loved the best – strongly contrasted with Mrs Dubusson’s renewed calm.
“I’m here, in case you’ve forgotten. And that’s quite enough on this subject, ta very much,” he said, a hint of steel in his voice.
The gall of that man.
At least he has waited until he has been alone in the small flat, where a damp smell always seemed to permeate through the walls, to allow himself to crumble under the pressure weighting on his shoulders, falling to his bony knees and crying his heart out.
“Okay but I still don’t know…”
“Like he was a regular bloke!” Greg has replied, punctuating his words with a wave of his hand. “Of course, we know he’s not, he’s a genius about it, but to like him for his human qualities…”
It was the most natural thing in the world to put both hands around John’s dear, beloved face, to watch the sudden shift in his attitude.
A bold statement which made John smile, before he became lost in an extremely detailed analysis of the various brands of tobacco ash.
“It’s okay, you know. You don’t have to tell me.”
“A price I’m willing to pay if it brings you at the end some happiness.”
“John?”
He wouldn’t.
Or rather, as his subconscious was taking a malicious pleasure in whispering in his ear, he could imagine all too well.
“You’re brilliant.”
In spite of the last message – “Challenge accepted” – John has thought he would never hear again of SH.
But it didn’t explain everything as far as their companionship was concerned.
“Might be.” He tapped the suspect on the cheek. “Be sure that we will go through your computer log files with a fine-tooth comb.”
He couldn’t resist. He ran again, picking up speed until he drew level with Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded. He has suspected as much when Mycroft has told him that his “friend” wouldn’t like the police to be involved in that case; Mrs Dubusson seemed calm and composed, but this appearance was betrayed by the minute trembles he could observe in her hands. Her amused and slightly challenging demeanour has disappeared, being replaced by a nervousness against which she struggled, now that the time has come for explanations.
what had happened this afternoon in his office.
Molly clenched her fists.
Without taking her interruption into account, Sherlock said
Their half-dressed state was driving her crazy. She wanted Sherlock completely naked, finally discovering her body in all its glory, from the long legs to the soft curves of her hips she could feel through the thick fabric of her trousers.
She sighed.
Sherlock Holmes.
“The night is young and…”
But he could admit that if Will was sitting in front of him, staring at him with this clear gaze John had admired when he has talked to him earlier, he would have ticked the box “Want to keep in touch with” in a heartbeat.
Pouring all the love which has been hidden until today in every gesture, every whisper, every whimper.
Before he could think about it though, he heard soft footsteps getting closer to him. It was way too early to believe it was one of the volunteers. His heartbeat quickened, he crouched down, ready to spring out of his hideout and pounce on his prey. Finally, his wait was over!
“Very good idea! And in the meantime, you can tell me what is going on at Islington…”
This… This couldn’t be real. It was a joke, surely.
“You might have learned how I seem to have developed a
“These won’t be necessary,” she whispered, yanking on Joan’s pyjama bottoms. Too far gone to say something, Joan arched up her hips. Finally naked, she opened her legs and sighed with pleasure when Sherlock slowly pinned her down to the bed, her hands on her wrists.
“It’s Greg. Or Gregory, as you prefer,
Mycroft didn’t trust him. He didn’t consider Sherlock strong enough to stay clean. A belief which incensed him and undermined him at the same time. True, he hasn’t been the model child his mother hoped he will be, but everyone made mistakes, after all.
“Especially that we’re together, aren’t we?”
“An unexpected visitor. However, I think you’ll welcome him with open arms,” she retorted, laughter in her voice.
He should have chosen Harry.
At this point, John realised he was well and truly on his way to being smitten with his unexpected date.
“Worse? How could they be worse when he has been “kicked to the curb”, as he so charmingly put it?” Sherlock stood up, agitatedly waving his hands. “You don’t understand John, I had to be sure!”
“Don’t be silly,” Sherlock retorted with a frown. “You know that…”
“Another one of your classics movies, I take it?”
“If it’s any consolation to you…”
“You,” he immediately replied.
John concealed his smile. Oh, well. Two could play this game, he thought, not resisting the impulse to cant his hips upwards, plunging into Sherlock’s tight fist.
Startled by Sherlock's words, John glanced up at him.
– and how he tried to hide it with his next question.
“Am I to assume you fluently speak Italian among your many other talents?”
I might as well ease matters for them, Irene thought before plastering on her most winning smile on her lips and giving a Facetime call to
None of this has been true.
He closed his eyes, forcing himself to stay focused on the present.
"I really hope you know nice places to go out.
Sherlock imitated him and saw immediately that John was right. Something – probably a logo – has been meticulously wiped off until a mere shadow only remains. It was nearly imperceptible and one had to have eyes like a hawk, Sherlock thought, looking fondly at his friend, to see it.
Sherlock felt an impish glee as he noticed Mycroft’s cheekbones getting pink. It wasn’t so easy to fluster his big brother. That’s certainly why he was making it a point of honour to attempt it every time he had the misfortune to come across him.
“That’s what I thought,” Sherlock viciously muttered before jumping out of his seat and getting off the train. Of course that was the moment for John to find back his voice “I said
Or was it just in my head?
He deliberately caught Sherlock’s hand, still outstretched, in his. He ignored the whispers arising behind him – “Goodness. Now I’ll have to scratch my eyes out.” “Shut it, Donovan!” – and said to Sherlock, blue eyes twinkling with mischief “Ready when you are.”.
“These kids, honestly!” Harold grumbled in a tone which made John want to laugh.
And the burning desire to know.
Mrs Dubusson started to get up from her chair - “Well, in this case, I’ll go up and fetch it” – and John was already offering his help, when the office’s door banged open. Another woman came suddenly in, carrying in her arms a screaming child. She flashed a smile of apology to Sherlock and John but her attention was focused on Mrs Dubusson.
“My pleasure,
Listening to Sherlock’s laughing voice calling her companion.
“Oh yes, of course!” John exclaimed, getting up.
And John was the only one who could help him.
Arousing as hell.
He hasn’t yet decided and now he was afraid that this disastrous situation would cheat him out of this choice.
“Don’t worry, baby bro, you’re still their favourite child. Their
“What are you doing here?” Sherlock growled as soon as he got his breath back. Before Mycroft could answer, he cut him off “No, in fact, I don’t want to know. Go away!”
A joke. A nasty, wretched joke.
John instantly slapped his hand over his mouth, successfully stifling the laugh bubbling in his throat in spite of the circumstances. He doubted Sherlock would appreciate or that he was even able to see the humour in that situation. However, he would never forget that day, as he set his eyes on his completely inebriated lover, who was watching Greg with a dopey smile. His glazed eyes had lit up at John’s sight.
He finds himself lifted off the ground, his own fingers clutching the rough fabric of the Belstaff coat.
The young girl behind the counter – which has been recommended as the only one able to talk to him without all the horrible “ze” and “tis” that French people used to say when speaking English - peered at him doubtfully, as if he was the only specimen left of an odd alien people, too dumb to understand her language.
Now that the time has come to say out loud what he has privately thought for months – or has it been years? – Sherlock found himself overwhelmed. How to describe what John represented in his eyes? His heart raced in his chest.
“Sherlock, God help me, if you don’t answer me, I…”
And she didn’t want to.
He felt straight away a twinge of remorse when he saw the distress in her eyes. Mrs Hudson has always been an active person – up at first light, taking part in a myriad of social activities and clubs without speaking of her regular visits to her sister.
And Sherlock was enjoying them, raising a dark eyebrow, always ready to retort something which would send Joan into fits of laughter.
He has caught the uncertainty looming in his date’s gaze.
“I know, Molly. I haven’t forgotten.”
No, let’s correct this – I
Startled by the familiar smooth voice, Greg gave a little jump before turning to the man he has been looking forward to see since John has called him and who was currently standing in the half-open door.
Better to catch than to be caught, he reminded himself.
“No!” he cried.
was an incident by the way, unlike what Mrs Hudson assumed. But she didn’t believe me and she even obliged me to go to the hairdresser…”
Always Yours.
“What a poor baby. If he wasn’t such a fag, I’d love to try to comfort him…”
John didn’t want to pry, really, but on the other hand, he couldn’t be satisfied with this kind of answer.
John took a deep breath. Now that he had everything at his disposal to finally solve the mystery which has dodged him for several days now, he felt strangely reluctant to take this last step.
This mere idea made his blood boil.
This chapter can be described as pining and... I'd leave you the surprise! :)
Snort of laughter.
“Got yourself a date, then!” Harry cackled before starting to laugh out loud when she glimpsed his face.
Her impulsive question was followed by a few seconds of silence. Just when Joan was starting to get unnerved – why did she have to ask this? – Sherlock suddenly let out a booming laugh. Even though Joan secretly loved this sound, a sure sign that Sherlock was trusting her enough to let her guard down around her, it now grated on her nerves.
So trivial and so needless at the same time.
“Okay, end of the game Mister Holmes.”
John didn’t waste any time.
Her green eyes met John’s and whatever she could read in his gaze made her smile get wider.
As though he has sensed John’s surrender, Sherlock trapped him into a tight embrace, putting his large hands on John’s arse, mercilessly squeezing and fondling his cheeks. At the same time he canted up his hips, rubbing his still clothed length against John.
The other woman has found her during a party, a few months later, staring at Sherlock, who was heavily flirting with another student, and feeling the familiar heartbreak.
When she was younger – and a lot more naïve – she has made the mistake of falling in love with a university friend. Irene couldn’t help but cringing when she remembered how the girl, after she has not so subtly tested the waters, has shot her down.
The voice suddenly booming in the loudspeakers made her jump on her seat.
He suddenly felt a hand under his chin, forcing him to look up.
Of course he won’t, Rosie thinks. Silly Daddy. If she’s sure of one thing in her comfy little world, it’s that her dad will always be there for her.
pretend!”
“I see in your file you’re entitled to several days off…”
From this moment, the Islington Community Garden was integrated into John’s routine. He went over there twice a week, greeting the volunteers and other plot holders chatting in the tea hut before tending to Mrs Hudson’s little garden. He learned how to differentiate the weed from the other plants, how to tackle them without harsh chemicals. He also learned never to say again “Roundup” among his fellow gardeners.
, John was still leaning on the counter. Reeling from the shock induced by this unexpected visual contact.
Fortunately – or unfortunately, it remained to be seen – John wasn’t most people.
“How many times do I have to tell you all the costs of this charming, impromptu trip are borne by his Highness, hum?” Sherlock retorted irritably. “Really, it’s enough that we find ourselves buried in this little French hole!” he added, not paying the slightest attention to the receptionist frowning at his derisive comment. John tried to placate her with a smile, but considering the way she nearly threw the room’s key at them, her feathers weren’t so easily smoothed.
Greg’s voice immediately changed as soon as he heard the name and John allowed himself a smug little smile.
“Next time, then? I’m game if you are,” John promptly replied, hoping to hide his sudden fit of nerves under a bland voice. Sherlock gently chuckled and John remembered he couldn’t conceal anything from this man.
“The police don’t consult amateurs.”
She walked to him, putting her hand on his arm.
Before John could answer though, Sherlock replied “He’s with me.”
“You’re right, Mister Holmes,” she replied, holding out her hand to him. “I’ll inform you of the lab results. In the meantime, I hope you’ll both enjoy the many
“Together,” John whispered. “And now kiss me.”
“You’re gorgeous.”
“You know you didn’t have to… I mean, if you didn’t want to…”
His right hand slipped beneath the waistband of John’s pants. At the first touch of Sherlock on his cock, John cried out. Pleasure was engulfing him in a fiery embrace, dissolving any fear, any doubt which has burdened him since his return in London. Blood was roaring in his ears, a harsh symphony with Sherlock groaning his name as counterpoint.
The Clos Lucé’s garden was really a beautiful place. Thanks to the lights spread out all over the gentle slope, he could see beautiful flower beds, a river wounding its way over them as lovely wooden bridges were stepping across the water. The perfect place for a romantic moonlit stroll, he thought, except from the weird, enigmatic machines whose presence was even more emphasized by the spotlights trained on them.
“Nothing. Enjoy your date then.”
“Hey, Johnny!”
Greg hasn’t realized he was holding his breath until he saw the answer to his question in Mycroft’s gaze.
“Sherlock…”
He was about to unzip Sherlock’s trousers when his companion drew away just enough to say
“See, boy? Still got it!”
John felt an unpleasant shiver running through him at these words.
Or maybe, he thought, it wasn’t so stupid, after all.
He hated how his voice betrayed his inner turmoil, sounding more like a teenager’s, unsure of himself and what he was feeling, than the grown-up’s he was supposed to be.
“He? Who are you talking about?”
“Telling them what?” Ross replied.
Irene shook her head, swallowing the bitter pill with a disgusted expression.
and unlocking the 221’s front door.
Molly turned round. A young woman was sitting at the other end of the counter, coquettishly smiling at the man in front of her, wiping up a glass. Molly was no sleuth, but she didn’t need it to be to deduce that the other woman was three sheets to the wind. And far from restraining her consumption, the barman was nudging her into sharing another glass with him.
So John remained silent about it.
He was drowning in pure pleasure until he heard right behind him “Shall I bring a bucket of water or will my voice be enough?”
Everything was different.
In fact the only person who has truly caught his eye since he has entered the room… All discretion forgotten, John craned his neck, looking straight ahead, above the rows of the
Trite words to be sure, but they sounded so earnest in Sherlock’s mouth…
He wanted this like he has never wanted anything else before.
Sherlock took his time to answer, raising instead John’s hands to his lips and brushing butterfly kisses on his reddened knuckles.
Noticing how blue his eyes were – one more thing to know about him.
No one answers.
Forget me not. Think about me.
golden lights shining in the winter night.
You changed so much you didn’t recognize yourself when looking in the mirror.
“No!”
Meals late at night in John's flat, looking at each other in the eye, both enjoying the unsaid and unresolved tension between them.
“You’re really the devil, you know.”
Joh, who has stopped dating six months ago, who has glanced at him more and more frequently before suddenly stopping meeting his eye.
He tuned her out.
Unable to stand still, he paced up and down his flat’s living room, not seeing anything else than the piece of paper on which he has written the phone number.
– into chatting him up, he has chosen the wrong person to do so. Mycroft would generously forget this unfortunate incident and next time their paths met, it would happen in the most cordial and professional fashion.
Discreetly, so as not to alarm the estate agent who was currently telling their ears off with all the advantages of the brand new flat they were visiting - something Mycroft has insisted on since "they couldn't be left to live in the hovel you're both currently occupying" - he slipped his hand in John's. Squeezed it once. John glanced up at him, his gaze directly focused on Sherlock's.
Well, John thought, in for a penny, in for a pound.
Once again, THANK you lovely readers, you truly make my day!
As I think about you, John’s traitorous mind replied.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. The self-consciousness he was exhibiting vanished in the blink of an eye, a mien of haughty annoyance taking its place.
“I… I can’t do casual with you. I thought I could let myself jump into bed with you or just do whatever you wanted to do and it would be enough. I know you’re not interested in something… long-term and it’s okay. I understand. However, I’m… I’m in too deep, Sherlock. I…”
“No thanks… Wait!”
And he waited.
She has died and woken up in an alternate universe, she thought. There was no other explanation.
When he finally came out from the tube station, he was panting for breath. He was getting his breath back when a familiar coat appeared in front of him.
Glimpsing her puzzled face, she let out a small laugh.
John remained motionless, unable to keep up with what the young man was saying. He hasn’t stopped staring at him, a strange mix of commiseration and amusement shining in his dark eyes.
“And you’re Hussein, right?”
Sherlock remained frozen during a few seconds before clasping Joan in her arms and kissing her back with a heady mix of enthusiasm and inexperience.
The violin’s song has echoed afterwards till late in the night.
It's my first mystrade story as you might have known and I have to admit I was a bit afraid of depicting these two. I don't know if I have managed to do it well with this chapter, but one thing for sure, it was a lot of fun to write!
She walked to Sherlock, still babbling about Lestrade and DNA traces, and grabbed her face between her hands.
Greg picked up immediately.
“Don’t worry, it’s just a scratch. I’ve endured worse,” she said, remembering her broken ankle when she has once fallen down the stairs in pursuit of a suspect.
The flirty grins sent his way received nothing more than a polite “Thanks but no thanks” smile in return.
“What do you mean he’s…”
That’s how he found himself looking right into the eyes of the man who has never stopped watching him.
And wasn’t it the crux of the matter, he thought.
Such a beautiful sight, he mused, as Sherlock’s gaze widened, looking back and forth between John’s face and the box.
bed in it,” he silkily whispered in John’s ear.
“What were you thinking of just now?” he whispered in John’s ear, his voice a weapon of mass destruction, setting fire on John’s remaining nerves. “Tell me, John, what do you fantasize about when you’re stroking yourself in your bed?”
John bit his lower lip, praying that whichever deity willing to hear him would give him a helping hand.
Interrupting herself mid-speech, the estate agent looked at them both quizzically.
“Not even for a trip to France, all expenses paid?” Mycroft had retorted, pretending to examine his nails. “Of course, should you be successful, your bank account would be credited with a fine sum.”
You would think that, with their experience – the company was after all one of the leaders in their market – they would have opted for some originality. Or at least a modicum of good taste.
“Just a love-addled one. It’s my duty to inform you, as your mate and personal agony aunt…”
“Ha bloody ha. You’re so very funny.”
They stood there, simply looking at each other, their breaths slowly mingling until Sherlock’s hushed voice broke the silence.
“Of course, it is!”
John doesn’t answer. He doesn’t know how. The silence grows between them. A silence loaded with tension. Sherlock is becoming restless and John dreads what will come next.
“And are you satisfied?”
She was looking forward to catching this abuser and leaving him in Lestrade’s care before going home and taking a very hot bath.
Molly has realized afterwards it has been the final nail in the coffin of her impossible infatuation.
“And what do you think I’m doing, exactly?”
“You were speaking of this art historian,” she said as if there had been no interruption, “who claimed the Mona Lisa was based on the portrait of Da Vinci’s male lover. In relation to this, I made the mistake, when being interviewed on that matter, to say that yes, it could have been plausible. After all, we know so little about Da Vinci’s personal life, there have been so many assumptions about the Mona Lisa… so why not? Of course, as for every theory in the artistic world, it should be corroborated with solid, tangible proof. I didn’t think anything of it until I received a call from my brother. He seemed to have considered this little speech of mine as a challenge to him.”
Without a doubt, John thought, while making some indistinct noise which might be interpreted like he was commiserating with the young woman in front of him. It was obvious she still wasn’t over her last break-up and while John could feel some sympathy for her – been there, done that after all – he wasn’t here to offer her a shoulder to cry on.
“Hey, kiddo!”
“Mycroft?”
John remained silent for a moment before bursting out laughing.
in this case, but we also help the police when they’re stuck and let me tell you…”
On a more serious note, I'll be away for a few days, so no update until next week. But don't worry, I promise I'll come back to this story as soon as possible :)
“Sherlock…”
He swallowed several times before replying “Yes. I’m here.”
The most aggravating fact in this whole mess was that he couldn’t read John anymore. Every little modulation in his voice, every glance he shot at Sherlock when he thought he couldn’t see him, every little change in his routine has turned as muddy as the Thames on a rainy day.
She suddenly stood up, smoothing out her skirt before glancing at Mike, who was staring at her, dumbfounded.
As Sherlock entered the
It was a whole different matter with Sherlock, however. The man who declared himself “married to his work” and proudly stated that “sentiment is a chemical defect found on the losing side” was the same one who fought tooth and nail to ensure that his landlady would never have to see again the face of her former husband.
She turned on her heels, feeling completely lost. Her anger has disappeared, leaving only in its wake intense weariness and the certainty of having shown her hand far too much.
How could he distract his attention in such a way?
He groaned. Lovely.
It shouldn’t have felt so good to finally pronounce his name out loud.
“What are you trying to do?” he asked her in the sternest voice he could muster. “You only had to call out to me when I was in the hall, I would gladly have kept you company downstairs!”
[You must be warned you are currently hindering a police investigation. SH]
She started isolating herself, seeking and finding refuge in her work. Gradually severing the links with John, Lestrade, the persons who still were important to her.
He dared peeking at her and smothered a laugh just in time – Harry looked completely poleaxed, as if someone has pulled the rug out from under her feet.
Sherlock spluttered in his drink, nearly choking on his last gulp of coffee. Mycroft observed him in silence, letting out a slight sigh before perching himself on a nearby stool.
Yes, he could understand. It didn’t mean that he wouldn’t take the golden opportunity which was offered to him simply because he might hurt the pride of others in the process. Oh no, he would take his due and enjoy it to the fullest.
It’s really not a wonder then that growing up, you decided friendships – or any kind of relationships, really – just weren’t worth the time and energy.
He was already walking towards her when he stopped “Wait!” He turned to John. “Mate, you’re going to be left alone for the next rotation, then!”
The same sentence the pupils of St Clare’s school used to say to Harry after she went running to the teacher, complaining about the pranks played on her.
Harry would never stop running.
“Don’t stop!”
“After all I’ve deduced in your regard, you really think I would work with an amateur?”
An instinct which was born of many evenings spent together in the comfortable cocoon of Baker Street, teasing each other, watching crap TV together. The same instinct which has snapped Joan out of her apathy when she has met Sherlock at Bart’s, pushing her to accept to meet her later at 221b.
for your taste.
Sherlock abruptly turned his head, taken by surprise by John’s soft voice as much by the warm hand the doctor has just put on his. He has done it twice now, Sherlock absentmindedly thought, his attention focused on his friend’s face.
Provided that he could find him first.
? Are you kidding me?”
Charming, ruthless, cunning Max Adler who, with a smile and a jest, has turned Joan’s perception of Sherlock upside down.
She laughed a little when she saw the heavy flush across Molly’s face.

“Maybe. (He gave a loud sigh.) Moriarty might have killed himself, but his network of minions is still active, you know. Even if they recently suffered heavy losses.”
He has rung off, satisfied that he has at least managed to rile Mycroft.
“What do you mean?”
“Of course not!” Sherlock protested, struggling to stand up and putting on her blouse again before making her way towards the kitchen, where she put the kettle on. “Myrcella has sent me backup. I was surrounded by her men and Lestrade’s team.”
And the desire which was never far from Sherlock’s thoughts when John stood by his side, laughing and smiling so openly as he was wont to do, roared once again in his heart, suffusing his whole body with the desire to touch and to own this amazing man. Their gazes locked in a scorching embrace, electric tension crackling between them. All trace of amusement fled John’s face as he hungrily looked at him.
She shrugged, quite obviously pleased with herself.
John closed his eyes. He didn’t want to follow this path again, didn’t he? But how to interpret differently everything which has happened, then?
What was he playing at? Trying to transform his drab interior into a cosy nest, in the hope that, should Sherlock follow him home tonight, he would be… what? Not being repelled by a down on his luck, injured former soldier with a streak of black humour? That he wouldn’t turn John down at the earliest opportunity?
For a moment, John pictured him – he could as well indulge in his fantasy of tall, dark,
They sneered, they taunted and mocked, never stopping before Harry finally snapped, running away from home. She came back after two days, promising never to do it again, but it was too late – Johnny saw it in her eyes.
“I’m all right, thank you for asking. Now what do you want, Mycroft?”
They’ve finally found the strength to undress, getting off their stained clothes, before slipping under the sheets. To John’s great pleasure – he has done his best to hide it from Sherlock, but as always, it has been in vain – Sherlock has directly pulled him close, cuddling like some big, sleek cat, his curls in complete disarray. John was still able to smell the persistent odour of his cum on Sherlock’s skin and one dark, primitive part of him was purring with contentment.
John is walking towards him. Slowly, like he means to break him. He might.
"Yes, please," said Sherlock, still holding John's hands.
John had taken his hand to lead him through the living room and the hallway of Sherlock's bedroom. As soon as he closed the door behind them with his foot, Sherlock was spun around and pressed against the wood, could feel the doorhandle pressing into his side and not caring in the slightest. He moaned into John's mouth as he kissed him with parted lips and a tongue as addictive as honey, making his world slow down like the golden liquid dripping from a spoon.
, because to him he was so lively, so wonderful.
Mrs Hudson chuckled and patted his arm soothingly. "They all think of me as this jolly old woman too innocent to be aware of any danger in this world. You thought it, too. And I'd much like to keep it that way."
"John Watson."
"Sherlock." Mycroft addressed him calmly. He had finally let go of his arm. There was something else in his face. A rare emotion. As rare as any emotion at all.
Felt it all.
The smooth fabric of John’s shirt and the rough one of his jeans that presses against the lower part of his body. Against his thighs and hipbones and the growing bulge in his pants. John’s one hand is rubbing back and forth over his inner thigh and the soft spot where it dissolves into firm buttocks. A soft spot that draws a quiet whine from the back of his throat. He places his other hand on his face to hold him. Lifting his jaw ever so slightly, his thumb is stroking over one sharp cheekbone, and he kisses him again.
Sherlock and John are running through the next dim lighted alley until they come to a stop, eventually. John's first reaction, after having chased a very athletic murder suspect through half of London's streets again, is a brace of his arms on his knees and a gasp for air.
They grinned at each other.
"Tell me more about him."
Today, as he has come to take in the living room properly, he has found none of it. Now it is covered in bits and pieces of what has remained in his memory. It isn't a lot to work with, frankly. It seems pretty clear by now that his latest memory before waking up naked in his bed this morning is that scene of him and John, chasing some possible suspect through dark alleys of London. When he has asked himself how he was feeling at the time (seemingly pointless question, but it could still be helpful), his mind appears to be caught in a spinning brainstorm. He feels...
? A treasure was usually something shiny and appealing in form and value. John Watson did neither appeal nor did he shine. He was a broken man, overshadowed only by his former self – a state he would never be able to reach again. At least when one was to ask John Watson.
way and partners in every way, he has found himself getting close to completely mad on many occasions, feeling the enormous need to
Their next turn brought them into a bright and otherwise empty room with one single painting on a wall. It was said to be the highlight of this month's exhibition. John remembered himself skimming through it in the papers recently. Up close he really couldn't see what would make it so special or significantly different from all the other pieces they had seen. Names, he supposed, might have been the most important factor in the process of this decision. As they were in so many other cases.
"Well, about that. We are still … I guess you'll see for yourself. Just follow me. It's at the courtyard."
"This is a war, inspector. The matter is outside of your division, and therefore out of your hands. Major Sholto of the Order will be in charge of this city in its current state of emergency as soon as he arrives."
"Allow me to introduce myself, Captain Watson. The Major had already made yourself known to me. I am General Elizabeth Midnight."
Sherlock's eyes widened. "What? Why didn't you tell so before?"
Irene crossed her arms with a bemused smile. "Maybe he followed you, too."
. This was all he had left of him. He looked up between the dogtag, still smeared with dried blood, Sherlock on the floor and Sherlock behind the glass tank. The necklace fell to the floor and John picked up the crowbar. He hammered it down on the tag and it split in two. Two halves. James and Sholto. Picking up one half, he pressed the sharp edge of the metal to the glass and rose the crowbar again.
?! I thought you were dead! For weeks, Sherlock! My God, you could have said something, let one of your homeless lot leave a hint somewhere, anything!"
"Oh? But I thought you- Wait. Hold on, are you saying you are
"I love you, too."
He gave a slow nod, hesitating, or calculating the odds of John telling the truth.
John finally came to his senses and sat half-upright on the sofa on which he had slept. That explained the back pain. Stretching and rolling his head from one to the other shoulder didn't do much either. Which explained the headache.
, as Sherlock had called Professor Moriarty, (
He calls him
The smile was washed from John's face in one cold wave of shock. "Wait, what? What did you say? How are we at war? With whom?!"
Sherlock's eyes quickly snap from the door to the face in the mirror that suddenly looks back at him full of insecurity.
Anthea walked him to a huge building with a beige stone facade once they left the cab. A glass sign next to the door read,
Sarah gave him a smile full of sympathy, and he was tempted enough to buy it. There was something he quite liked about her. She was disciplined and kind to even the most obnoxious of patients, would never lose her temper and followed orders excellently. She was clearly overqualified. That, however, was the kind of decision that was beyond her powers. That was the world in which they were forced to live in.
"Because you," he sighed, "you cannot bleed because … you're a cyborg." John tried to get up and off the detective beneath him to get out of this
Sherlock lifted his shoulder with a small shrug. "I've deleted most of the data."
Sherlock tucked back his lips, knowing precisely too what it was that would not take form in words between them. And he had only needed John to confirm it.
"It's meant to be useful John. A visual cue." Sherlock replied dryly. "I can't be expected to keep everything in my mind palace."
Their mismatched chairs sat facing each other before the hearth. One soft with red brocade, trussed up with pillows and a blanket. The other dark and plush and bracketed with the hard lines of chrome and gray leather. They were set both in harmony and counterpoint as much as the two men that occupied them. Separate and together. Each other's better halves.
board to see what images have been inspiring the story.
Into his own large hand, Sherlock shook out ten quality mushrooms. All of them precisely the same colour and shape of the ones that he had shown John from his book. All of them perfect specimens. More than he had asked for.
The Queen Mother only raises her thin eyebrows in concession.
John smiled and gave his pert arse a comforting pat. "You can take them back down to the kitchen if you want. Otherwise you're already breaking your cardinal sin of mixing work and sex."
The next words he says are chosen with care. "THIS is war."
Without him noticing, Sherlock had stood from the bed and crowded John back until they were out into the sitting room, walking him all the way through the kitchen until the backs of his knees hit the seat of Sherlock's chair and made him sit with a whump.
"Not poisoned, John. Drugged." Sherlock corrected.
John reveled in the singular focus of the lashing tongue and clinking teeth and the mad scrabble for purchase from Sherlock's pouted lips and wide, pan-encompassing hands. They collided as soundly as the polar opposites they were.
"Yes. But why is she in a list with thirteen other people? They're the only thing written in the book."
"Ah. Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" The Queen Mother announces delightedly. "I had wondered if you would make an appearance. Oh dear. You look a little worse for wear since I last saw you. Did you run out on somebody else when the stakes got too high?"
John's hand flew up in surrender. "No. Sorry. I'm not making a face. Just...go on. What did he look like? This Eric Crenshaw?" He asked instead, committing the name to memory for whatever purpose. Keeping his face very still.
"I hear you're to be knighted." William had finally said into the silence and it had made John glance up at him, shuffling in place as his stomach swooped. It made sense that the Lord of the Manor would have received word that one of his serfs was no longer to be considered such.
"By all means." John play-acted easily and stepped aside. The sting of her nickname for Sherlock seemed to linger longer and more harshly now than it had when she'd last dropped it casually at NSY when they'd been concerning themselves with the pips. Was it the change in their dynamic? Or the tanacity with which she said it? A LOT had changed in such a short time after all.
"You sure you don't need anything?" John eyed Sherlock's placid cock tucked back into the foreskin. A secretive knob of flesh that John wanted very much to see fully erect, but felt now he was pressing his luck.
John hisses out a breath through his clenched teeth and nods, putting the words to their reasons. He recalls this same thing having happened to him back when he played footy as a kid. He remembers all the other boys' faces above him. Crowding in. Gawking and gathering, but not helping. He remembers it hurting and hurting until he'd finally been taken to A&E by his mum, blessedly not remembering anything after the injection they'd given him to take the pain away.
This could be very, VERY good.
Into John.
"I have my methods." He said as the means to a diversion. "Let's talk about something else."
From that day forward they would no longer work on the Lord's land in addition to their own. They would see only to their land, allowing them all more time to better tend their crops and to accomplish other chores. And, in addition, be allowed to keep a larger portion of their harvest and supply and money.
And then, just as his brain was drifting, tripping on the edges of sleep, an aria being sung by the man alone began that was so sweet and pure and forlorn that it grabbed John by the solar plexus and squeeeeezed.
"Never left. John! You said: never left!"
"I'd bet the stars on it."
"You were on Royal property! Basically a stone's throw away from Buckingham Palace! Jesus. Only you wouldn't think anything of it." John laughed to himself, delighted by the whole affair in a way he hadn't been expecting.
