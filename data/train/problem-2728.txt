"Well, not like that. That makes it sound terrible. It was a joke, sort of, between us. 'Poor Dr Watson.' It was...I needed it. I was wallowing."
And, as he saw, she was right. Mother and father killed in the middle of exams. Sherlock could hardly blame him. He went back through the newspapers to find out if the rest of her story held up.
"People in my line of work hardly live past their forties," Sherlock interrupted, walking again.
"Familiar with the male form," John murmured, adding a third finger.
It was something he thought on often; when the urges arose, when the companionship of a loyal hound wasn't enough and he longed for a body in his bed, a male body.
John laughed too and they melted back into an embrace, John kissing Sherlock gently, pulling at his bottom lip with his teeth.
I APOLOGISE FOR CROSSING A LINE. MH
Finally!
Sherlock glanced up quickly and took in the tight smile, how it didn't reach John's eyes. "You believe you have too many for anyone to want to stay."
Sherlock grinned, and then moaned when he pressed himself down to rub against John's stomach. John was still writhing with his release, but had the sense to wrap Sherlock in his arms and encourage the action.
John nodded towards the far trees. "Took off like a rocket. He'll be at the water already, I'd bet."
The pain came and went; that was the problem. Sometimes she'd be fine for hours on end, and others she would hardly be able to stand up from a chair without it shooting through her like lightning.
He looked over at her with disbelief, and vanished. Poof. Like a plume of smoke.
Taste.
GOODNIGHT, MYCROFT. TRY NOT TO DREAM OF MY BOSS. SH
John licked his lips and unbuckled his belt, eager for what was to come. He heard another grunt and the bed squeak and something fall to the floor.
"Nothing," Sherlock said, pouring the water and bringing the steaming mugs to the table.
John scrunched up his nose and shook his head. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
"The strap off your book bag!" he shouted.
Sherlock pulled at his hair and kissed along his neck, breath hot and ragged against John's skin, and started picking at the buttons of John's pyjama shirt. John pushed him back and yanked it over his head, grinning as Sherlock wrestled his own shirt off and sat back, breathing roughly and nearly glowing.
The other writers looked up and Sherlock moved them further away from the small crowd. John was clenching his fists and frowning and Sherlock wanted to kiss the frown away.
"You know her?" he asked in a stage whisper.
"Need your help on a case. Didn't mean to interrupt," Greg explained.
Sherlock groaned and started to stroke his cock in earnest and his imaginary John giggled again.
"She's not so bad," John said as they left the building.
"What the bloody hell is going on?" she demanded under her breath. "I just saw Mycroft Holmes kiss you on the cheek. Are you two fucking?"
Sherlock continued to work wonders on Jane's shoulder and Jane was soon leaning back against her more and more.
"He won't come," Greg said, the line scratchy. "Says he knows it's a surprise party. Maybe next year we can-"
"I'm not looking for that. If I had been, I would have married long ago," John said, squeezing Sherlock's shoulder.
"I drink mine with milk," Jane said.
"You look rested," Sherlock pressed, speaking as they walked slowly back to the cabins.
"How did you know to come?" John asked.
Sherlock pushed past him, eyes far off as he picked apart a seed pod, and John couldn't help watching him go, sleeves and pant legs both rolled up and shoes tied to his hip belt loop. He looked the perfect picture of schoolboy innocence.
"Well?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock looked to him, and then back again with record speed. "Man on the corner. He's talking to the woman in hushed tones because he doesn't want anyone to hear what he's saying."
"Would you like to?" Sherlock asked, more than willing to get the man off the streets and back into what he was sure was a small house in the suburbs with a perfectly manicured front garden.
"Didn't like the last vicar?" John asked.
"Things change," John replied.
"And now you're taking me to your posh club for a date," Greg teased, "because you're a bloody romantic."
Sherlock tapped at the screen and stood to spin on the spot. "Here. Wonderful. I'll get us some books so that we can start right away. I can't believe I didn't think of it when you first appeared. This is going to be wonderful! Brilliant!"
"To battles won, or some such nonsense," he said, catching John's eye and holding it.
John, because he did, but rather that he liked him a bit too much. He could see John pushing his way into his life. He could imagine John nagging him to clean the house, could imagine staying in bed late into the afternoon on the weekends and reading the paper together, he could imagine John across from him at the kitchen table, licking marmalade from his fingers. He could imagine all that perfectly, and then he could see it all going to shit.
'Dear S,
"God, you're unbelievable," John cooed, breathing hotly against Sherlock's neck.
John shook it and looked around.
"Sherlock Holmes!" Mrs Hudson squeaked from the sitting room. "Put your clothes on this instant!"
"Bloody last thing I need is-" The man stopped speaking and looked between Sherlock and John for a few seconds.
"Well?" John asked.
"Oh?" Sherlock said, grinning and looking a bit mad. "We're at three-quarters now. Hardly full, if you ask-"
Really, though, how could he? How could he go into that room on John's first day back in London and ruin everything for the both of them?
"I just met the most...well, he was just, so very...I don't actually know how to explain-" John tried, thinking back through their walk and becoming even more confused.
"Do you want lunch?" John asked. "Mrs Hudson has made something up."
"I'm leaving," he said, taking the last swig of alcohol and standing to do just that.
"Sherlock doesn't allow security," Greg said.
"How was your meeting?" she asked, eyes not lifting from her mobile.
By the time they made it to Sherlock's flat, the man felt more himself. The cloud of arousal was starting to fall and he wondered what on Earth he was doing. But, God, how he liked the man. He was a challenge, guarded and hesitant to open up. He was the best kind of mystery.
"I'm not sure-" he tried.
"You act like an adult all the time," Sherlock said, "and that's why none of the children like you."
"You promised me a cold case," he said, eyes moving haphazardly around the room.
The doors were summarily closed and Greg walked closer to the fire, fingers cold and reaching out reflexively.
"You'll tell everyone?" Sherlock asked, trying to reassure himself.
Friday came and John had become a bit worried. What is one to do at their significant other's parent's house if they can't be seen. He'd jumped up and down in front of Mike several times in the days leading up to the dinner to make sure he couldn't be seen by a random stranger. He couldn't.
"If I get pneumonia," Sherlock asked, raising his eyebrows and walking backwards, "will you care for me, or pray for me?"
"Well, it is rather romantic, don't you think? The universe won't allow it until I'm in danger," Sherlock said softly, smiling tightly to himself and looking down at his feet, then up again at John bashfully.
"Years, darling," John whispered, "years."
"What am I meant to do?" Derrick asked, taking the pen hesitantly, as if it might bite or change into something strange in his hands.
"I'll put in for a replacement tonight," John replied. "Could take longer than three months."
Mycroft was at Sherlock's front door when he got home, standing there with his smarmy grin and his stupid umbrella. Sherlock wondered for a second if he should have taken John up on his offer of dinner.
Your first letter was a surprise. I admit that I only wrote back to amuse myself, as my boredom was starting to make my skin itch. I never intended to start up a correspondence with you, let alone one that would encompass so much.
He pulled the mobile from his pocket and opened the email.
It was honestly the last thing he really remembered before he was coming. John was swearing up a storm above him as he spasmed over and over, barely any come left in him to spill after the day they'd had.
I hope all is going well, as I'm not sure what I would do if it wasn't, and I'll write you again soon. After, of course, I have another story to tell you.
"They remedied it the next day," Sherlock replied, arranging his hands carefully in his lap. "I spoke with the editor."
"The tab is on Greg tonight," she shouted, "cause he married into money!"
Sherlock watched the sedan pull away from the stoop, not wanting to miss any last message or decision John might make. But it did pull away, so he went to start his experiments.
Sherlock shook her head, hands clasped behind her back. "Oh, no. She tripped on the stairs and died on impact."
John placed a hand on his knee, doctorly, and Sherlock fell silent. After a beat, John nodded and Sherlock nodded back.
There was a porter at the door arguing about the situation when John pushed his way past. "I'm a doctor! Out of the way!"
So he watched Watson read through the letter, speaking the words to himself and laughing, and thought that was good. He couldn't give Watson what he needed, after all. Not then, and possibly not ever. Who knew if Watson would ever come out of the closet. And hell, that wasn't a jab at all, because he himself was gay through and through and wasn't letting that on in the least. It was just...with someone like John Watson, you thought about changing that.
She hadn’t recognised the man until he’d shown his face, and now she was wondering if calling off the backup had been such a good idea.
"I don't sleep much myself," Sherlock admitted.
"God knows I would have remembered him, if we'd met," Sherlock said, eyes wide.
Marriage really was about compromise. Their first had been a bit of a quid pro quo; John admitting to his middle name being Hamish in exchange for the knowledge that Sherlock didn't, in fact, drift down, fully formed from the heavens, but was born just like every other human. Well, the knowledge of the date of said birth.
John snorted and shrugged. "People with nothing to hide."
"Can he come now?" Samuel added.
Something strange flickered in John's eyes and he reached over and pressed hard to set the lift in motion, and then hit the button for the next floor. Seconds later the doors opened and he walked out, leaving Sherlock there, confused.
“No one likes the  person you can’t hide your secrets from Johnny.” Lloyd offered his son a sad  smile. “But she knew how to hide and how to keep you safe. Even from me.”
“Not to worry, beloved,” Mycroft  replied with a secretive smile, “it is possible to block me if you  wish but I sincerely hope you never feel the need to do so.” His  eyes turned soft as he gazed at his lover. “I could not be sure how  strong the bond would be. I could only hope and wait for the power of  our connection to be revealed. I cannot say I am surprised however.  There has never been a light in my life as bright as you.”
They soared lazily over London only catching up with  Sherlock as he slowed to circle over a crumbling church situated at the edge of  a rundown industrial area of the city. The two dragons eyed each other then  descended to land gracefully in a weedy courtyard.
John struggled for a moment then gave up and relaxed in the  dragon’s grip. It wasn’t the first time Sherlock’s impatience had earned him a  surprise flight. It actually felt rather pleasant cradled in the Dragon’s claws  with the wind from beneath the elegant wings swirling around him.
John tightened the hand around Lloyd’s throat. “No you sorry  sodding bastard! This isn’t at all about you.”
"Don't answer it. Put it on silent," Sherlock urged.
"A little romance wouldn't be putting me out, you know. I'd like to take you to dinner sometime,” John said softly, breath hitting Sherlock’s neck.
He wrote back, platitudes and understanding. And spent the rest of his lunch staring at the wall and thinking about how it had all gone wrong. How he'd thrown it all away for a man he'd known less than a week. He thought back on the encounter with the ponce in the warehouse and realised that he was right, well sort of, when he said John trusted Sherlock very quickly. The fact was, he'd fallen just as quickly as he trusted.
"Suppose so," John agreed softly.
Somehow, the words just wouldn't form.
Greg pushed Mycroft back against the door and climbed into his lap, seatbelt deserted, kissing him soundly on the lips and clutching his hair in both hands. Mycroft wrapped his arms around Greg's waist and let the tears that had been threatening to fall for, honestly several years, do so.
"God isn't opposed to fun," John said, patting the blanket next to him and opening the picnic basket.
"You're police, then," he murmured, looking on the back of all three pages.
"Gregory," he said, sounding shocked.
"Go get it, then," John said, pointing behind them to a large box on the entryway chair. "We wouldn't want to be late to the work Christmas party. Sends a bad message."
"God," John choked, head falling forward as he started to thrust slowly.
What kinds of scientists worked in the army?
By the time they made it home, stopping at a small bistro to pick up food and phoning Anthea, or whatever her name was that week, to bring over Greg's belongings, they were both close to starving. Mycroft helped Greg out of his outerwear and knelt to unlace his shoes for him.
She chuckled and went about cleaning off the kitchen table. "Yes, very busy. Busy enough that you've taken up a second job as a gargoyle, I see."
He breathed against Sherlock's forehead for the remainder of the night, figuring that he would have to bring up the issue of his being a ghost the next day. That night, though, he would have Sherlock in his arms.
John looked into his lap and steeled himself for more painful revelations, but Sherlock fell into silence next to him. John hoped they were equally uncomfortable.
Sherlock took a hesitant step back as Terry’s bodyguard pulled out some rope and nodded to the only chair in the mostly empty car lot. A chair that was apparently there for a purpose. She was blocked on three sides by concrete, and her only chance of escape seemed to be overpowering the goon. She was just thinking of whether she could use her necklace as a possible garrote when her hand began to burn.
I studied Chemistry and Medicine in uni and am currently working with the Met. It would be useful for my work to add to the long list of injuries I can identify. Of course, photos would be extremely helpful, but it's difficult to get those, no matter how important, unless the person has died.
"What makes good ones kill?"
His face held a look of pure, unadulterated awe, and suddenly John was able to breathe again.
"Go on," John said, lips parting against Sherlock's fingers.
He kept his eyes on the back of the seat in front of him for the rest of the ride, his mind flitting between the secrets his congregation had already entrusted him with and the ones Sherlock had seemed so close to admitting.
"Are you alright?" John asked, cocking his head to the side.
"You saved my life," John interrupted, lips pursing as he looked at the cane.
At that point, he couldn't really imagine anything more. He was sure he would balk at the chance to take it further, and figured that that would make him a horrible boyfriend. If he'd never be able to touch Charlie intimately, never be able to satisfy him, then what was the point?
It never took long unless Greg meant it to, and this time he didn't hold back, pushing Mycroft to the edge several times in short minutes before pulling off.
Sherlock nodded and watched as John went to sit next to his wife. He saw the way her spine straightened and her jaw clenched, all of it matched in John's posture, and tried not to think about it. Instead, he made his way over and sat next to Sally, putting his napkin primly in his lap and looking at his plate.
Tight, bloody hot and tight.

"I told you I was working," Sherlock replied for effect, lugging his suitcase to the open shack door.
"I will be," Sherlock replied as honestly as he could manage.
"That would be fine," John said, sitting back in his chair.
Sherlock's mouth tensed and he shook his head once, no. John sighed and took a large bite of the sandwich in retribution, and they sat there in silence while he finished the whole thing.
"Brilliant," is what came out in a near gasp.
"Only a few times with a, with a, with another person," Sherlock admitted, holding onto his knee and pressing his arse back as John's forefinger pushed into him. "Lots of times by myself."
Sherlock worked her way higher and Jane steeled herself. 'You bloody asked for this,' she told herself. 'Keep it professional.'
"You're adorable," John teased as he pulled away to look Sherlock in the eye.
"Alright," John said with a sigh. "I'm feeding you up."
Rough fingers threaded through his hair and he sighed deeply at the pull of them. The fingers massaged his scalp and he breathed deeply through parted lips.
"Only ten minutes, vicar," came the reply.
Sherlock started to grunt softly and John leaned in to trade his fingers for his tongue, hand going to his pocket where the handkerchief had been stuffed earlier and getting it ready. He let Sherlock suck on his tongue as he focused again on the head of the man's prick. It took less time than he'd expected to break him down. Sherlock was coming seconds later, pulsing into the dark paisley square and bucking.
John tuned the man out and started to count the holes in the tiles on the ceiling.
My favorite story was the case I've come to think of as the missing egg. Sherlock was contacted by an elderly man named Richard Tollance. He had a large home in the country that was full of expensive artifacts from his travels around the world when he was younger. His prized possession was a diamond and ruby encrusted egg from China. It had, as you can guess, gone missing.
I'm not sure what to write here.
Sherlock caught John's arm as the man's legs gave out and sat him on the edge of the sofa to go pour the water for tea. He tried not to let the situation spin out of control. He simply had to decide on what truth he would create, and then spin it. John would believe him. John could do little else.
"I have a feeling we'll be needing this as well," Sherlock said, pulling a pad of paper from one of the drawers. "So that you can tell me how very wrong I am about your beloved Bond."
“Greg,” John gasped his voice ragged and hoarse.
John’s gaze turned suspicious at  Sherlock’s lack of argument. “His pri-do you mean Greg?!”
“You can’t do that! You don’t have any evidence to hold me.”  Lloyd’s skin glowed brighter turning from copper to red and then back again as  he yelped in pain.
Lloyd breathed a single word into Lestrade’s ear. The rhythm  of an ancient language wound around Lestrade’s thoughts and he stiffened as  tendrils of power seeped into his skin. He struggled to resist their command but  his body shuddered and went limp.
John snorted and scrabbled upright. “Right. Where  the hell are we?”
“Look there’s no need for this!”  Lloyd croaked as his fingers scrabbled at the claws around his neck,  “You have to understand John, everything I’ve ever done, I’ve  done for you!”
John ignored Sherlock’s demand, turning to put on the  kettle. “Meant by what?”
John paced angrily around the walls of the small cell. “Yeah,  well I didn’t know that until fairly recently did I? It’s not like you said  anything.”
Lestrade squeaked and yowled until Mycroft fully transformed  and leveled out in flight. He hung firmly gripped in the dragon’s claws as  Mycroft’s powerful wings stroked cleanly through the cool, crisp air.
Sherlock closed his eyes and sought out John's mouth with his lips, sucking and biting as they rutted against each other there in the entryway. It wasn't long before they were both grunting and close to a finish that was a year in the making.
Well, here we are at the end of things. I'm so happy these idiots worked it all out. Catch you guys on the next one.
"Yes, sir," Sherlock squeaked, mind going a bit fuzzy as he was overwhelmed with the dump of chemicals in his system from those words. Good little soldier. He thought perhaps he was dying.
John looked at him, exasperated.
"It doesn't look haunted," Sherlock replied, refusing to look over his shoulder to meet the man's eyes.
John looked on as he turned to walk away. "I'm, uh, heading this way," John said, pointing in the opposite direction and scrunching his nose up at the fact that Merrick was looking between them as if to say he didn't know who to follow.
"Fuck," John huffed, head falling to Sherlock's chest. "Yeah. Yeah, yes. I'll just..."
He hadn't really drank enough to be in this bad of shape, he thought. It hadn't seemed like that much alcohol. But he was sure as hell feeling the after effects and regretting it. Why he hadn't said no to Greg's offer to buy shots, he didn't know.
_____
"And what would a student hypothetically throw?" Sherlock asked, confused by the whole interaction.
John laced their fingers together and waited for his heart to stop doing those frightening little jumps. "Tell me, tell me about the case."
Greg thrust up into the tight, leather clad fist and let himself get lost in the drag of it. "Christ, that's good."
"No, John. I'm the one who's sorry. I was there to catch the killer you knew as Doc before she injured anyone else. I wasn't fast enough. I failed you," Sherlock said, head hanging again as he shifted on his feet.
Jane allowed herself to be led, if only to feel the warmth of the strange woman pressed at her side, and kept her mouth shut.
"I know. Has the therapist prescribed anything to help you sleep?" Greg asked, letting his hands fall to his sides.
"No. Absolutely not. You don't get all the perks of being in a relationship with me because you aren't. You don't want to be. So go take a shower and then please leave...and don't come back."
_____
"No," John said, eyebrows furrowed and lips pursing on the second letter.
"Mmm. Inside. I'd like to get to know you whilst in the vicinity of a heater," Sherlock agreed.
"Yes, well, there happens to be a great deal of water falling from the sky at the moment," Sherlock replied snidely.
John swallowed and sat back as she left. She knew who he was, and, more than that, who he was to Sherlock. It was complete a surprise.
"Do we really have to go?" Sherlock whined, not wanting to move an inch away from John.
"Missing-" Anderson tried, but Sherlock was already out the door and headed towards Lestrade's office.
His plan was to invite Rachel to the jazz concert and put her into the bit of hollowed out space in his heart that Sherlock currently resided in. Nothing to do but keep busy. If he pretended that he cared about her, he certainly would eventually. Eventually was soon enough.
"I won't tell..." John began, chewing his lip before going on, "if you promise me something."
Greg surged forward and kissed him, hands finding purchase in expensive lapels. That, it seemed, was enough to shock the usually unflappable man, and when Greg pulled back he was met with a gasp and searching eyes.
Sherlock paid the delivery boy and stomped back through the house without answering his brother.
"You've stolen my dog," John said, looking down at Merrick. "Now I'm alone."
"That good?" John asked, voice far from even.
"Does it hurt?" Sherlock asked, all but a whisper in the small space.
They were just about finished with breakfast, both of them feeling prematurely that they were starting a new life, when Sherlock perked up. His focus turned intent and John could've sworn he'd seen the same look on Merrick when the random bird landed in a tree nearby.
Christ, Sherlock hadn't been lying about that bit. There they were, his drawings in frames that outshone them tenfold. He couldn't stop himself from walking across the room and reaching up.
John leaned up and kissed him gently before sitting back.
Stop! Stop! Abort!
It took another date, this time at an equally small pizza shop, for John to get up the nerve to kiss Sherlock. They'd made it up to his flat, his roommate out for the night, and were sitting on the sofa watching a movie. They were also holding hands. That was very nice, very nice indeed.
John snorted and stood. "Alright, genius, lead the way."
"Just didn't realize how believable you'd be," John said, wondering if he should look down on this behavior.
“Don’t call me that,” Sherlock spat.
The high profile cases kept coming and soon they'd put together quite a nest egg. Mycroft admitted that they were better off with Sherlock's newfound form of success and secretly delighted in the fact that Sherlock had finally, finally, found his way in the world. He hadn't meant for Sherlock to continue to write, after all, but rather knew his disdain for it would be the catalyst for greater things.
"Are you always this insistent?"
"Practically sewn up. Fine, if that's what you call arresting the wrong suspect, I'll find my way out," Sherlock said. He turned as if to leave and gave Lestrade the precise amount of time it would take him to second guess himself.
It had been years since he'd fallen so thoroughly for someone, and he felt, at the time of their painful parting, that it was a good thing. Victor had been his friend in university. They'd become close during Sherlock's last year and had even kissed on several occasions. Victor saw no reason for things to change when he was married the following year.
reading a book on a small bed, legs crossed underneath her and hair pinned up close to her head. She looked up as they knocked, and came to answer the door.
Mycroft's steps faltered once more and Greg smiled at being able to surprise the man. It was quite a feat.
With the memory, talking late into the night like bloody teenagers, came a warmth he had yet to place. He felt young.
"I hope you aren't going to eat with that hand," John said, picking up his sandwich and laying back to rest on one elbow.
"Stop flirting with the readers," John said, face dropping. "It's...it's just..."
He wondered then if John would be angry if he'd been some other woman, if the medicine would go down a little smoother that way. His fear was that it would, that the thing that would break this would be his gender.
That caught Mycroft's attention and he cocked his head to the side. "Is that any way to talk to your superior? I would have thought the military had taught you better."
Sherlock slipped further into the water and lay the phone on the lip of the tub, on speaker.
John'
An hour later Sherlock's limbs were loose and a grin wouldn't leave his face. John was feeling very nice as well, and had got up twice to push their chairs closer together, the last time making it so that he literally had to climb over Sherlock's lanky thighs to get back into the chair. Their knees were pressed together and Sherlock was touching his mouth ridiculously often, and John felt that maybe honesty could actually be achieved between two men.
"Says the Head Teacher with his prick up my arse," Sherlock replied with a snort. "Harder."
When he was done with the flowers he brought the vase to the sitting room and walked back through the kitchen to what looked like his bedroom. John waited while he changed, feeling fuzzy and muddled and fantastic, and then they headed out into the world, arm in arm.
She let herself remember talking to Sherlock in the alley, believed she could smell Sherlock's cologne on her skin. Remembered her words; just your sort of thing, Captain. And, oh, that did it. Dark mesmerizing eyes, plump bottom lip, and those fingers sliding up her thigh.
The next day the picture of Sherlock and John kissing appeared in the newspaper. John's blog the same day announced their new relationship. They were assaulted with a throng of admirers for the rest of the convention but they secretly didn't mind.
I'm sure this will come as a shock to you, but I beg you to think everything over before you make a decision. If you want to know the truth, I will tell it to you. If you're content writing to the person that I am, content to hear about my life and have no interest in secrets, then please, please write again.
In a surprising turn of events, the main attraction of the Writer's Convention being held this month isn't a seasoned writer with an award winning novel. Instead it is the unexpected electricity between two of the lesser known writers. John Watson, writer of the Detective Miller novels, and Sherlock Holmes, writer of The Death Of Daniel Carson, have been spending their days running off to have romantic meals on the roof rather than meeting their fans.
Sherlock feigned a shiver and shook his head, lighting up a cigarette and leaning back in his chair. "If it does rain, we'd be much better off out here; the dining room ceiling leaks."
'I want to know more about these characters. Are they in love? I've never been in love, but I have a feeling that you were writing them as such. How does one know if they're in love? Have you been in love before?
"I think I know the next intended victim," Sally said, pressing in to whisper into his ear.
Sherlock waved his hand dismissively and John scrunched up his nose, but followed.
"She's my best man, and we don't know anything about the local cops. They could be completely incompetent, and someone might notice them," Lestrade replied.
"Are you leaving?" Sherlock gasped, jolting out of his seat and stalking behind John to the stairs.
"Night," John shouted from the hallway.
John started to pass the tea over and Sherlock held his hand out. "Try it."
_____
"You'd damn yourself to a life of secrecy?" Sherlock asked, voice faltering. "Abandon the life you want for yourself? Abandon the word of God?"
John peered into ever changing eyes  that gazed at him with possessive fondness. He smiled and sighed.  “Let’s go home Sherlock.”
“Does that usually work for you? It won’t in here.” Lestrade  asked the question politely, folding his hands together on the table top. “What  were you doing in the warehouse?”
They swept past John and Sherlock,  bickering as they headed for the back and obviously expecting the  other fey to follow.
John halted, tilting his head like a  flower striving to reach the warmth of the sun. Something about that  single word, the sound of that familiar voice, drew him from the  cocoon of his father’s overwhelming authority. He had to think.  There was something missing. His vision grew misty and he ran a hand  down his face. As his eyes cleared he reached out to cup the cheek of  the concerned face of Sherlock as it swam into view.
“Sherlock!”
John’s tone turned deadly. “Right.  And what kinds of things would that be dad? Do I get to be your  lapdog instead?”
Lestrade grabbed Lloyd’s arm and pushed him toward the door  while John distracted their foes but the man twisted in his grasp pulling  Lestrade down in a tangle of limbs.
“I object.” Lloyd said as he  stepped from the shadows behind the altar.
Lloyd absently rattled the cuffs against the table leg,  jumping a bit when they emitted an annoyed growl. “You might say that. We met  online. Are you a gamer inspector?”
John roared and shook off his father’s touch as he fully  transformed into a golden beast. He leapt for the trio that stood calmly  between him and Sherlock’s unmoving form but cried out and twisted in mid-air  then came down hard restored to his human form. He raised pained eyes to  Lloyd’s face. His father stood over him flexing a right hand that dripped lines  of blue sparking light.
“How much control does it have  over you?” He asked bluntly.
John Watson held an unshakable  belief in love. He knew what it was. Love was what you lost. It  either burned bright with an intensity that charred you to ashes or  insinuated itself into your heart with a warmth that slowly leached  away until that muscle stilled in your chest. Love was betrayal. The  things John Watson loved either left or refused to love him back in  the way he needed them to.
John gave a sharp nod. “Um yeah, I just said …”
John stared at him in disbelief.  “Since when do you care about duty and responsibility? What the  fuck, Sherlock?”
Sherlock started to protest but John held up a hand and gave  a resigned nod. “It’s alright Sherlock. I’ll answer what I can Greg but I  haven’t seen the bastard in years. He left my mum before I was born and only  showed up periodically to cause everyone a lot of grief.”
John raised his claws and for the first  time in his life saw fear in his father’s eyes. He dragged the  razor tip of one across Lloyd’s cheek. A thin line of blood welled  up and spilled down the collar of the man’s coat. The cut healed  almost instantly, leaving a raised white scar puckering Lloyd’s  skin from ear to chin.
Mycroft tutted. “Such a bother.” He swept the fox into his  arms and stepped off the edge of the building.
Mycroft called from his seat on an  antique sofa as he sipped delicately from his own glass and perused  an array of fabric samples. “Now, now John no need to be crude.  There are things we all must endure for crown and country.”
John stepped forward shielding his father and brushing the  accusing fingers aside. “He’s an arsehole but he’s my Dad and you’re not taking  him anywhere.”
“Magic taxi summoning thing? Really John?” Sherlock sniffed  then stopped still in the middle of the sidewalk and flexed his shoulders. His  body vibrated and the cool autumn air shimmered around him.
Snatching the map from Lestrade’s hand, Sherlock swirled the  edge of his coat and was out the door while ignoring Mycroft’s cry of protest.
I suppose the map didn’t show us an easy way in,” Lestrade  said rubbing a hand through his silvery thatch of hair.
John’s powerful hands wrapped around  Lloyd’s throat and lifted him from the floor.
Lestrade favored Mycroft with a wink and bumped shoulders. “Only  my pride dragon boy. Getting that message out really did the trick. I’m feeling  much better. The pain is gone and I have two furry friends inside me who are  starting to feel awfully restless.” His grin turned predatory. “They want to hunt.”
“Despite his actions  against us he is not severely injured son of the lost one.”
Lloyd strolled around the altar,  removing his green top hat and twirling it in his fingers. “Mycroft,  you old goat,” he grinned, “I’ve gotta say I have to admire the  frankly masterful machinations that brought us to where we stand  today. From one trickster to another, I salute you.”
John lifted Sherlock’s narrow feet and maneuvered his way  beneath them until they were nestled in his lap. He rubbed and stroked the arch  working his way up to pull at his long toes. Sherlock melted beneath his touch.  “Lestrade chose Mycroft.”
“I want him found and then I will personally see to his  disembowelment!” Mycroft was breathing smoke and fire into the air after every  word and his face was wreathed in red scales. His clawed hands were gripping  the handle of his umbrella and each time he tapped the floor with it the entire  room shook.
Lestrade’s sarcasm was of course completely lost on Sherlock  who replied with a satisfied smirk. “You’re welcome.”
Well here we are again after a very long time. It's been almost two years since I've updated this story though not because I didn't want to. In my early 30's I needed several surgeries on both eyes. One eye survived, the other did not. Almost 20 years later I experienced problems once again in my good eye. I needed surgery, and due to complications was left blind for several months, almost a year. The good news is that I have regained the sight in that eye and I'm just starting to write again. So thank you all so much for your kind comments and sticking with me for so long. Every word and kudo means a lot to me and I truly appreciate all of you. - Mary
“We have no quarrel with you House of Dragon. Give us the lost  one and his spawn and we will go.”
“Enough,” He said in an even  tone, “the bonding is complete. The requirements are fulfilled.  Consider your answer carefully. Do you recognize the right of the  house of Dragon to ascend the throne?”
Lestrade grabbed the keys with his teeth and headed down the  hall. Thick iron doors ran down each side and Lestrade stood still for a moment  with ears cocked. He huffed and snorted as the sounds of arguing filtered  through the air regretting his wolverine form’s inability to roll its eyes. He  trotted down the hall until he located the cell the irate sounds were coming  from and shifted back into his human form. It took a few tries but eventually  he found the right key and turned the lock unable to help a grin at the  surprised looks of John and his father as the door swung open on rusted squeaky  hinges.
Sherlock surrounded John like an endless sea so deep and vast he would never find its end. Yet he wasn’t drowning. On the contrary, he thought perhaps he was breathing for the first time. The only thing John was sure of was that he would do anything for Sherlock Holmes.
“Mycroft?!” Sherlock flopped onto the couch his arms crossed  against his chest and his lips turning down into a pouty sulk. A thin curl of  smoke escaped one nostril. “I ask you to remember one thing and you choose  Mycroft?!”
John couldn’t resist the grin that spread across his face.  He leaped down the stairs and took the jacket Sherlock was handing him. “Lead  on MacDuff.”
John sighed and stepped out of Sherlock, looking the man up and down with exasperation. He'd been talking to John almost nonstop for the last few days. He was sure that if he could solve John's murder (not murder, damnit) that John would be free to go to the afterlife.
"Milk," Jane said, clearing her throat.
Several hours later, Sherlock returned with a good stack of books. John hadn't made tea, still not sure if he was comfortable with giving himself away completely, but Sherlock didn't even seem to notice. Instead, he simply lay the books on the bed and started in on another experiment.
The second the door was locked behind them, John was pulling Sherlock close by the collar of his shirt and kissing him. Sherlock huffed into his mouth, feeling dizzy and as though he wouldn't be able to stand much longer. The feeling intensified as John went to his knees before him and pressed him bodily to the wall, fingers opening his flies and pulling his prick out.
It was a nice cafe, yes, but Sherlock didn't feel like it really fit John. Then again, he did join his employees in the cafeteria.
She pulled her gloves off as she stumbled through the front door of her flat, tossing them to the floor in a fit, because the mark was still there under the plaster.
Sherlock finally left the room when she had got her fill, and walked down to the shop to hurry through her list of projects. She had several spells to make up, and a great deal of thinking to do.
He'd only just levitated to the attic when he heard Sherlock running up the stairs. It was like someone let a buck in; clack, clack, clack. Sherlock burst through the door and walked right into John, standing with John's shoulder poking out of his chest as he readied the soil for examination.
Sherlock's cheeks pinked up and his hands tightened on the glass.
"God, you're amazing," John said, turning Sherlock and starting on his flies.
"You love me," Sherlock said, as if trying to soothe himself.
Another hand rose hesitantly and he pointed to it.
They collapsed to the side and Greg's started to giggle again. "You ruined my arse."
"I think I might just become obsessed with your arse. It's bloody perfect," John said, tossing his condom in the bin and hopping into the shower behind Sherlock. He picked up the small bar of soap and lathered up a flannel, running it over Sherlock's chest and arms as the man let his head loll back and closed his eyes.
"Who are you hoping to hear from?" Molly chirped, tucking a lock of hair behind one ear and trying not to sound overly keen. Everything she said sounded overly keen to her own ears.
When she'd finally listed all the things she hated about it, she found herself able to speak. "I don't know why you're here."
"They hold a room for me, gorgeous, and I can get a table at any restaurant in the city."
"Thought you might want to see this yourself," he said, noting how John's hand slipped naturally onto Sherlock's thigh as he read over the man's shoulder.
"This is ridiculous. We're going to be in so much trouble," John said as he pushed the door open and walked out to the edge of the roof.
"Injured in combat," Sherlock said aloud.
And John paused, because social niceties were burned into his brain.
“Your assistance was appreciated, let's leave it at that,” Sherlock replied quickly, picking at the edge of the plaster on her hand.
"Yeah, well, that goes double, then. My interest in your brother has nothing to do with you and I'd like to keep it that way," John said sternly. "Now if you wouldn't mind buggering off, I need to get back to my station."
When they pulled up outside a building with ornate pillars and men at the door Greg smiled and exited the vehicle, waiting for the assistant to do the same. Once she met him under the overhang they walked inside, Greg not missing the looks from some of the patrons.
YOU'LL BE LUCKY IF YOU DON'T CATCH COLD
"Where have you two been?" Sally asked, suddenly beside Sherlock and making him jump a bit.
They hadn't really had much in common. He had no idea what she would write that would take up so much space. He couldn't remember if she was in medical school or not, didn't remember much of anything, to be honest, and wasn't even sure what to write in that first letter. It was a long shot.
"What are you even saying?" John shouted, turning and going to stick his head through the window.
And, oh, that caught Sherlock's attention. The word coming from John's lips was like an aphrodisiac, and he bit his lip hard as John slipped his mobile back into his suit pocket.
On the next to last page, in the entertainment section, there was a picture of the front of the convention center under the headline, 'Love Is In The Air'. Sherlock snatched the paper up and read through it quickly.
'Dear DoctorJohn-'
"John...it's a good story. Go on," Sherlock murmured, worried he'd finally ruined things with his whining.
"This will take forever to boil," William said, fiddling with the knob on the stove. "Why they don't just have an electric-ow!"
WHICH AD WAS IT? I'VE PUT OUT QUITE A FEW. TELL ME THE EXACT WORDING.  -SH
"Hey," John said between giggles, "she ruined real and fake marriages alike."
Sherlock was honestly shocking himself, asking for what he wanted and taking initiative had never been his thing when it came to possible romantic entanglements. That was why he'd never had a boyfriend, or even anything more casual. He just couldn't get the words out. But now, it seemed that was all in the past.
"Love?" John asked, the word feeling fragile on his tongue.
Sherlock was already behind him, helping to pull his jacket all the way on and smooth down the shoulders gently. John huffed and closed his eyes, happier than he'd been in, Christ, yeah, years.
Mycroft let his hands slip below Greg's shirt and rub up and down his back, sneaking down every once in a while to pull his arsecheeks apart before scratching up his back again. Greg let him, hissing when fingernails pulled at his skin, and slowly added a third finger.
Sherlock nodded brusquely. "Indeed."
The elevator bell rang and the doors opened onto the third storey and Sherlock backed out slowly, watching John. John rolled his eyes and stomped past the man and down the hall. He entered his room and slammed the door, not noticing that Sherlock had walked to the room next door, a room that was connected to his by a locked door.
How on earth was his life turning out this way? He'd spent years feeling numb and unimpressed by those around him, and now he had two men in his life that were constantly taking his breath away. He breathed in deeply, just to assure himself he was still capable, and wrote back.
"Don't act like you didn't come begging for something from me last week. In front of the whole squad, nonetheless," Greg shot back.
Sherlock ended up walking in the rain for an hour, ducking below overhangs as best he could, but growing wetter as he went along until he was soaked. When he got home he trudged up the stairs and stripped, getting into a hot bath before it was even full and grinding his teeth.
When he turned around he found Mycroft standing quite close. He looked over his shoulder guiltily and stuck his hands in his pockets.
"Shut up," Sherlock growled.
"Into the library," he said. "It's important."
When Mycroft finally entered the room some fifteen minutes later Sherlock was in his chair, rocking it back and forth and sipping his best brandy.
"I don't need a wheelchair," Sherlock said, trying to stand but finding it difficult with such a strong hand keeping him from doing so. "I told them I don't need a wheelchair."
"Oh!" Molly replied, suffused with relief. "Well, that's fine. I'm sure they're just going about their day! Sometimes I have to wait a few day's time to get answers to questions I pose online."
"In me," Sherlock whimpered, his prick pulsing against John's. "Please."
"Breaking into kitchens?" he deflected with a strange laugh.
Sherlock's entire body bucked at the thought of John inside him and he moaned and spread his legs, hips rolling in the air.
"Want to break into the office?" she said at last.
London wasn't horribly hot, the hotel had a fan in the corner to combat the slight warmth. It was, by most accounts, a pleasant day, one meant for lazing about. Sherlock found himself walking back and forth in the main room. It was almost the size of a small flat, a whole storey of one of the most expensive hotels in the town, and a present from Mycroft. The idea that his brother might know what was to go on in the bedroom made Sherlock gag a bit.
And here he was; not annoyed. He wasn't comfortable, that would be obvious to even the most unobservant onlooker, but it wasn't annoyance.
The man looked close to passing out, eyes flicking this way and that and a sheen of sweat on his brow noting more than the weather. "Do-do I know you?" he sputtered.
Jane sat for a second, not sure why it felt like a threat to her self image to say yes. She did need the money, and getting out of that terrible bedsit would be nice, but wasn’t this too much?
"I can undress myself," Sherlock noted groggily, letting John pull the confining thing over his head.
He picked up the pace, feeling the first few drops of rain and cursing at how this always seemed to happen, just as a dark sedan pulled to the kerb beside him and a door opened to block his way. He was in the middle of stuttering out a curse when he caught sight of the woman sitting in the back.
John watched as Sherlock took out a small looking glass and inspected first a pair of earrings. The woman sat across from them and watched him intently.
"Fine," she said. "Eight o'clock tomorrow at the Met."
"Heat, then cold. I promise it will do you some good," Sherlock said.
The second she was out the door, plastic bag in hand, she felt like hitting the brick wall. Sherlock was draped against the building, hands in her pockets and cigarette drooping from her lips.
"Please tell me you returned the hand," John said, voice giving away his full grin.
"Beautiful," John sighed, thrusting harder and deeper as Sherlock began to tighten around him.
The doctor smiled slowly and held his hand out, enjoying how quickly the pace of the conversation had changed. "I'm Doctor Watson."
It stung, and convinced him that it was his role in life; the disappointment.
_____
"You're not leaving the house," John reminded him. "Doctor's orders."
"What do you suppose it is," Sherlock continued, looking Jane over carefully, "the thing that makes you feel familiar. Don't say your face, which isn't at all memorable. Except maybe your eyes, but no, that's not it."
“Do I have to worry about you?” he asked, looking her in the eye for the first time.
"I would...like...that," Sherlock said, mind racing.
"And instead you have to sign books for uninterested readers," John replied, holding his hand out. "I'm John. John Watson."
The lackeys knew not to mess with the big, bad, illusion of a wolf, and let him trudge to the staff loo to dry himself off. The face he pulled when he saw himself in the mirror would have been comical to anyone else, but to the man standing unnoticed behind him, it spelled out nothing but trouble.
Jane had come out of nowhere and Sherlock was starting to think Mrs Hudson had a hand in it. She always did want Sherlock to have a friend. A friend besides her skull, at least. Had she secretly known Jane? Did she think Jane might like her?
"Have they checked you for signs of seizure?" John asked, going to the other eye.
There were whispers as Sherlock and John made their way into the convention center but they were so wrapped up in each other that they didn't notice them. What they did notice was the surprising smile on Greg's face when he walked in.
He'd been to the Tesco down the street a half hour prior and lugged back a good amount of food. Mrs Hudson, Sherlock's overly cheery landlady, had warned against using anything in the fridge, without telling him why. He'd have to talk to Sherlock about moving things around a bit in the fridge, as it was cramped with things he was hesitant to touch, but he'd figured that would wait for later. A later that he hoped still involved him moving in.
John poked him in the side and rinsed his mouth. "That sounds like a complaint. Strange, coming from the man who preens at every look."
Mike choked on his coffee, some of it going onto his paisley tie. “Beg pardon? Jenny isn’t pregnant.”
The temperature dropped again; barely noticeable, but still.
"Sherlock Holmes?" he asked.
John started to laugh and Sherlock laughed along with him.
"I didn't expect you," John said, words soft and tinged with a sadness Sherlock still didn't quite understand. "I really didn't. I keep wanting to pinch myself."
He knew Mycroft wouldn't abide it. He wasn't used to having to look after more than himself, and often did that poorly. Now, for instance, he was running on nothing but tea. The fast, even if not in name, was exactly that. The difference was that his fasts happened to be praise to something other than the Holy Father. It was much more praise to the scientific mother, the inner workings of his mind and the precise nature of his work seeming only to fuel his intent.
John laughed and gripped Sherlock's arse in both hands, eliciting a moan from the man as he squeezed hard. "Noted," he murmured, pushing his hips forward to prove his point.
Ten years later.
"What? Nothing!" Sherlock squawked, flushing a bit and stuffing his mobile back in his pocket.
"The bad news?" Sherlock pressed, already tired of this game.
_____
The smile John gave changed his whole appearance. It softened his eyes and he seemed younger instantly. If that made something clench in Sherlock's chest he didn't say, but then again, who ever comments on emotion with a crush so near. He cleared his throat and turned the key and they made their way up.
"I did," Mycroft replied.
"Where are you going?" Sherlock asked, for all the world sounding truly worried.
Sherlock smiled at them. "I should like to meet her."
He ran back to his laptop and opened up a new search, the words mocking him even as he wrote them; can you get an erection from embarrassment?
“John Watson?”
That was how he ended up dating women again. Whether it was intentional or not, he simply couldn't put himself in that emotional position again.
"Soon," he murmured.
"You really want to hear about it?" he asked, more to the universe than to John in particular.
"That's not fair!" the woman said.
John flinched and took a step back, Merrick looking up at him curiously. "Miss what?"
Sherlock stood and walked through the door into the back. He frowned at the dental assistant and sat in the chair he was directed to with a huff. The man rolled his eyes to the receptionist behind Sherlock's back and clipped a piece of paper around his neck for when they did their procedure.
"Yeah, well at least I have readers. My cases might not be as brilliant as yours but at least people can get through more than FIVE PAGES! If you're writing were any less palpable it would be used as kindling."
John watched him go and then closed the door and went to loom over Sherlock. He hadn't meant to loom, really, but his curiosity got the best of him.
What she didn't say was that it was intentional. She only needed a bit of blood for her next spell, a bit of her own power, and the guilty party would be struck dead. (At least she knew that admitting that was a bit not good.) She'd been wondering how she could watch, and hadn't noticed Jane coming down the stairs.
John dropped onto the sofa next to him and looked at the screen.
'Dear DoctorJohn,
He stepped in and went to sit in the plastic, uncomfortable looking, chair next to John's bed. He fidgeted, eyes still on the floor, unable to look up. It was all he could do to cup his slowly cooling coffee in his hands, the paper of it growing cold. When he heard John rouse he finally had to look.
'To dream about him,' Sherlock thought bitterly.
"Not...sure," Sherlock settled on. "We only bickered at dinner."
"You should at least-" Mycroft said, lip curling.
"Different kind of partner," Sherlock said, taking John's hand.
John sat startled at their little dance. It hadn't occurred to him that they would know each other, but in a small town like theirs it was inevitable. It was touching to see how sweet Sherlock was being to her, though.
"Your hand is warm," John said, taking a step closer.
"Do you do that often? Take advantage of men for your own benefit?" Jane asked, not sure why it was bothering her so much, but feeling it tangle with the roiling attraction in her belly.
"The war happened. And then my injury. And...well, he was sent home just after that, but he'd moved to some place out in the bloody woods and wouldn't take my calls."
"Stop, just," John said, stilling him with a hand on his back, "sit back down."
Sherlock stuck out his hand and then wiggled it until John took it in a firm shake. John was sure he'd just lost some sort of bet, but he couldn't be arsed to care.
They were still laughing seconds later when said DI burst through the door.
There was only one man outside of Bill Murray that John spoke to. That man's name was James. Major James Sholto.
Years —redacted— through —redacted—.
"Your beer," Mycroft spat, sitting primly on the sofa next to Greg.
"Oh, that's happening again," Sherlock squeaked, falling against John's chest with a sigh.
Sherlock's smile turned conspiratorial and he leaned towards the body again. "We'll tell him when we suss out the suspect. Cause of death, Doctor?" he whispered, unaware of the multiple uses of the word 'we' and his almost complete conviction that he and John were now a team.
"I'm meeting someone," Sherlock said, as gently as he could manage. He wasn't in the habit of outing, or shaming, anyone, after all.
"Yes, exactly. Because humans are taught to disregard the work of women, and to trust men. Which is what?" Sherlock asked.
"Several times a week. I mostly come to people watch," Sherlock explained, leaning back in his chair and crossing his slim arms. "New Scotland Yard is just around the corner. The most interesting people come by."
"Who knows," he said, "perhaps my humor will work on live subjects."
This suit was a much brighter blue pin stripe than he'd expected, double breasted and cinched at the waist. The shirt underneath was an unsurprising bone white, but the tie more than made up for it with its diamond pattern and orange and beige colouring.
Stupid, he'd been so incredibly stupid.
"Yes, well," Sherlock mumbled.
Mycroft's mouth opened and closed like a fish. He swallowed once and then nodded.
"Why isn't the building black anymore?" Jane asked as she walked through the doors, nearly tripping over a fern.
"Molly," Sherlock replied, nodding to a few students on the way.
"Half the sandwich," John said, prying the laptop from Sherlock's fingers and setting the plate on his spindly knees.
Misunderstandings. Of course.
He felt like burning his flat to the ground. He felt like never speaking again. He felt like dirt.
"I believe you've met my brother," the man said stiffly, looking around the room.
He fumbled opening the mobile and almost dropped it. When he finally opened the email and started reading he huffed and nearly threw the mobile to the floor.
His words were cut off by John pushing home. Their mouths were a breath apart and John swallowed his greedy moan as he started to thrust. Their teeth clacked together and Sherlock's hands ran through John's hair, gripping and letting it go, gripping again.
The door to Jane's right slapped open with a loud bang, the wind holding it that way as a large figure cloaked in black stomped in. Jane watched as said figure cursed colourfully and pulled the door closed with two loud grunts.
"You thought I'd say no," Greg said as he realised they were now driving away from his flat.
"Slipped out just as the sun started to rise," William answered. "Fifteen minutes. I like the mornings, especially so close to nature. Things are quiet."
It didn't make sense that the idea hurt so much. He was stupid to become so attached so quickly. It had started off as a lark. When that all changed, he couldn't be sure. It was somewhere between getting the second letter and writing back. Somewhere in that impossible few days he'd constructed a relationship in his mind. A friendship so easy that he'd been blind to its very construction.
John peeked around Sherlock's shoulder and then leaned back quickly.
"But I can't seem to get a good cup. I would swear it was because of the new barista but his coworker made mine tonight. Used to be my favorite place but now the coffee is just terrible," Sherlock said, sulking a bit.
"Dead," Greg replied. "I know it's a leap, but we need your eye. Wouldn't have called if it-"
"Yes," Sherlock whinged.
"Yeah, good," John said, taking a step forward and holding his hand out.
Something in his voice pulled at John. He wasn't one to leave a comrade bereft. "Course. Yeah, see you in an hour. Same place?"
Jane smiled at the answer, because, yes, some days did feel that way.
"Do you box?" Sherlock asked, seemingly managing to read John's mind a bit.
"I've missed you," Sherlock admitted, breath hot against John's neck.
He picked up a fresh bluey, set his pen to it, and told what was as close to the truth as possible.
Care for each other and cultivate art.
"Maybe, maybe some other time. The, um, coffee," he said pinching himself and scowling as he did.
The word cane had turned Jane's stomach sourly, but she was so overwhelmed by amazement at the end that it didn't seem to matter. "That was..."
"I need a hand," Sherlock blurted, trying to find some reason for them to stay together longer and mind, honestly, still a bit set on the morgue.
"Look, I think this has all been one big-"
A servant walked into the room and handed Greg a pint, already prompted by the other man as to what to pour. Greg pulled on it and closed his eyes.
"Janey," Harry echoed.
Mycroft looked between his eyes and then to his lips. Greg swallowed and walked around him to the unoccupied chair in front of the fire. It felt like a win, if a small one. Especially so when he heard the scrape of wood as Mycroft pulled another chair close to him. If he was going to have a drink with the posh git, he was going to do it on his own terms.
"You'll have some pain. I want you to take three paracetamol every four hours for the next two days," John said, hands slipping into his pockets. "For supper you should stay with cool, soft foods. Yogurt, applesauce, cottage cheese. Have any of those in?"
Lloyd hid his surprise behind a grin. “Ah inspector I like a  man who gets right to the point. I was there to meet a friend. Unfortunately  someone else found him first.”
“You great scaly bastard!” John shoved Sherlock hard enough  he stumbled though the man just grinned at him and laughed. John smiled and  shook his head, turning at the sound of a shout from the interior of the  decrepit warehouse they were standing in front of.
Lestrade laughed. “Yeah I know what he meant.” He peered at  John with an assessing tilt of his head. “Are you OK?”
From behind him, standing like a statue in the doorway and unable just then to manage a single breath, was Greg. He'd been worried about Sherlock, knew he was taking pretty much any case, and had finally broken down and come by with a bit of a peace offering; a stack of late nineties' cold cases. What he saw, a muttering man crouched over a torn envelope, hair unruly and cooing at the paper, only worried him further. He watched as Sherlock taped the envelope and was thinking about leaving and just calling Mycroft when Sherlock convinced him he needed a sort of intervention right then; he'd kissed the paper. Kissed it.
Tendrils of gray, oily smoke seeped from Lloyd’s ruined flesh  and then exploded outward shattering the blue bubble and flinging the  inhabitants several feet away and to the ground.
“Wish I could choose which one.” Lestrade clapped a hand on  John’s shoulder who responded with a half-hearted chuckle. “See you at the  yard.”
“Let me talk to him.” Sherlock regarded Lestrade with a  fierce expression. “He’s not your killer but there’s a connection. He’s no  innocent bystander.”
“Come on,” Lestrade urged barreling past them and heading  for the front door, “I don’t know how long Sherlock and Mycroft can hold them  off.”
John squared his shoulders and forced his jaw to unclench.  He took a few deep breaths then opened the door.
“See for yourself.” John’s hand fell away as Sherlock  stepped forward and examined the now broken circle. The body lay on its side  and the green haze was fading fast.
“Um, look, forget I said anything.” Lloyd licked his lips  with a nervous dart of his tongue. ”Let’s just concentrate on getting the hell  out of here.”
Sound and motion returned around them as the Followers fell  beneath the onslaught of the ravaging beasts. The remaining acolytes surrounded  the two but John and Lestrade were swept up into the sky by two bristling  dragons who layered the courtyard with walls of searing flame. Sirens rent the  air but by the time the first truck arrived there was nothing left but a black  crater filled with a bed of thick ash.
The priest cleared its throat and  resumed its litany of platitudes and exhortations. Sherlock pulled  John closer and brushed a kiss against his cheek. “John,” he  breathed, “this seems a bit drawn out even for my brother’s usual  level of disregard for the patience of his audience.”
Lestrade stared after him and called out a sarcastic reply. “Thank  you for rescuing us Greg. That was very clever Greg. We’re forever indebted to  you Greg!”
Lloyd awkwardly made his way over to John and fell over on  his side in front of him. “Thanks for making me crawl.”
Lloyd smirked. “You should be. Go on a few raids with  someone and they start to open up you know? Especially if they’ve had a few. It  gets boring waiting for shit to happen. They tell you stuff. You tell them  stuff. We got to talking and it turned out we had a few things in common.”
He rounded on the Followers his calm, steel-edged words cleaving  the silence like a weapon. “If you don’t release him I will crawl down your  throats and gut you from the inside.”
