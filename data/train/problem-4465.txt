Dean wondered how much of what happened he should share. Should he tell his mom about Cas’ insane theory about John being still in love with her? Dean quickly decided to leave that for now and just tell her the basis.
“Who knows? He probably had his head stuck in a book somewhere. That reminds me, I invited Castiel to join our ‘Daddy Issue’ club,” said Dean with his mouth half full.
Cas had just finished filling all of Dean’s friends in on what happened the day before when Sam, who’d been mysteriously absent all morning, walked in, head held high and his body vibrating with confidence. He grabbed his food and sat down with his friends at the jock’s table and soon after, the table burst into laughter.
, Dean. You can’t be serious?” Dean pinned her with a stare, making Charlie swallow back her giggles. She coughed, then licked her lips before asking, “Did Sam say they were dating?”
“Ho-how bad is it?” His heart was beating like crazy as he waited for an answer. Surely Cas and Charlie would’ve been more upset if it had been life-threatening? But what if no one had told them how bad it was yet… Sam swallowed hard and wondered if this was why his dad had run out of the house last night like a mad man. Though, for the life of him, Sam couldn’t figure out
“I don’t know, Sammy… if you’re not going to tell me what you were calling for, I might have to make up for lost time and start to--”
They’d been driving for a while when Dean figured he should try to calculate how far away from town they’d gone. At the very least, it would keep him from thinking about how screwed he was -- that wasn’t helping him at all. He figured about ten minutes had gone by since he’d been taken. They drove for about another ten before the car started slowing down and eventually coming to a complete stop. The knot that had been forming in his stomach ever since he got taken just got a whole lot bigger.
“Deaaaan, why do you hate me?” she whined, pouting out her bottom lip. “You don’t want to drink with me, you don’t want to talk to me… Here I thought you were the Frodo to my Sam! And now I find out that I’m the… I’m the… I’m you’re freaking
“-- fantasize and -- wait.” Dean paused, eyebrow raised as he studied his little brother’s face. Sam looked anxious, scared even, and was desperately seeking approval. “I know we haven’t been together all that long but, Dean, it feels
“I... umm... I didn’t realize they were so big!” said Castiel in awe, that Dean could tell was fake, and Dean couldn't help but laugh. ”And... and it’s so shiny! You obviously take good care of it.”
“I hate you,” said Dean as he sat down and snatched the plate Castiel had just put in front of Charlie before she could take a bite.
The worst thing John did was come back. Dean would’ve been perfectly happy growing up and resenting an absent father, angry at a stranger for leaving his mom and him. But, instead of resenting him, Dean hated him with every fiber of his body. In returning, Dean was forced to watch him and Sam live the perfect life right in front of him while he and his mom were struggling.
"Dean-o! Sam-a-lam! Thought you two had fallen back asleep!" Gabriel greeted them, grinning wide. "Though I was going to have to break out my rendition of Dominic the Donkey!"
He was five steps away from the table when Castiel said, “You sure? That’s too bad… Oh well, more pie for us then.” Dean turned to see him digging through his backpack.
When Dean, in between yawns, finally agreed to her plan after she promised to take all of the fall if they were caught, she rolled onto her back and reached over to shut off the light. Dean sighed, settling back into the pillow and letting his eyes fall shut.
“You’re so hot like this,” Cas whispered, resting his chin on Dean’s hip so he could look up his body. He smiled as Dean met his eyes and shivered at the look he found there. Cas’ lips brushed over his cock, but left him waiting, making Dean break his resolve to stay quiet and a loud moan burst from his lips. “You’re lucky this isn’t a very public place.”
Dean was grateful for a second to be interrupted from his own thoughts, until he recognized the voice.
met someone he likes. I’m not going to let Sam ruin that,” Charlie huffed out as the two of them walked to math class together. They had discovered out earlier that day that Castiel would be joining the two of them in that class. Therefore, math class was the perfect place to talk to Castiel. If Charlie’s plan was going to work, they needed to talk to Castiel. Without Dean finding out.
Claire’s eyes widened and she broke out into a wide smile, turning her head to look at her mom. “Uncle Cas has a
“Shit! What did you do?” asked someone and Dean felt someone crouch beside him, helping him sit up and get the pressure off his arm. If he’d been paying attention to anything other than the pain he felt, he would’ve heard the slight panic in that voice.
Cas chuckled softly. “And this former patient is grateful. I do believe this was our first disagreement.”
“She sounds amazing, Sam,” Castiel said, his heart already breaking for what Sam would say next. He remembered cautioning Lucifer early on in their relationship after knowing his new love interest had lost someone close, so he knew how this story ended.
“Well, minus the hard time you gave me when you were under my care,” Dean teased with a chuckle of his own, laughing softly when Cas shot him a playful glare.
“Claire!” Amelia scolded her again just as Castiel came back into the living room, carrying two large pizzas and balancing plates and napkins on top.
“Oh. They must have taken it.” When all Dean did was lift an eyebrow, Charlie explained, “Benny thought the other boys might try something from the way they were whispering and looking at your stuff, so he took it for you instead and left a note saying that he would leave it with me. Of course, he asked me to already be here when you were supposed to be done, but, uh, something came up.”
“You can’t promise to talk at school and than ditch half the day before you have the chance to talk to me,” said Castiel as he sat down next to him.
He rocked his hips forward, sliding his body up and down Cas’ length, his own cock bouncing between their stomachs with each jerk of his hips. “Touch me, Cas,” Dean breathed out against his lips before moving back, using both of Cas’ knees to move up and down.
What happens next? Stay tuned for tfw_cas' chapter on November 23rd!! (Eat pie and read good fiction, Dean Winchester approves).
year, and Dean was glad when he looked over to see Sam relaxed in his chair, cutting up Anna and Fergus' son, Gavin's, French toast while the parents were busy trying to get Sasha to eat in her high chair. At the end of the table, sitting beside Claire, Ronald was nearly vibrating in his seat, shoveling his food in as fast as he could so he could be excused to go and open his stocking.
Mary pursed her lips for a moment, thinking. “What happened yesterday can’t happen again. If it does, we’re moving and I mean it,” his mom said. “I’ve already yelled at everyone at your school and threatened to sue their asses off if they don’t do something about what happened.”
Castiel let his eyes fall closed and leaned his head back, opening them once the blanket by his feet was lifted and his sister-in-law curled up against his side. Amelia was quiet for a moment, resting her head on his shoulder and looking down at Claire and Dean.
The moment Castiel got out of his car, Dean said: “I don’t think we can be friends,” in a teasing kind of way.
, you are going to show up! Take your stupid geek squad with you, I don’t care. Just get Cas to come!”
“God that took forever,” Castiel rumbled as he nipped at Dean’s jaw. “You have no idea how hard it was for me to keep my hand limited to your thigh. The things I wanna do…” Castiel trailed off with a groan. “We better get inside before I drag you to the backseat.”
“Sorry? That’s all you are going to say? Do you have any idea how worried I was when Crowley called and told me that you had just ditched school without any reason?”
When there was about an hour left of the movie, they decided to take a bathroom break since both the girls and Castiel needed one. Charlie and Cas went to the bathrooms in the back and Jo ended up going to the staff bathroom at the bar--being the boss' kid had its perks. That left the rest of the boys in front of the TV.
But… why was that photo in some guy's journal? To say that Dean was curious would be an understatement.
The next month and a half went by quickly. As Castiel and Dean grew closer, Sam and his friends continued to leave Dean alone. That was until the day after Sam found out about Dean and Cas’ relationship... but that had been expected.
“No thank you, my car is still outside,” said Gabriel as he grabbed Castiel’s shoulder. “Let’s go, Cassy. Naomi is gonna have a fit if we aren’t home soon.”
When he got there he tried to find something to bring back with him so it wouldn’t be as obvious that he was hiding out in here.
“Isn’t it better to sit in the front?” asked Castiel, glancing to the high top tables but following after Dean, “That way we won’t miss anything?”
Their lips crashed together, Castiel moaning into Dean’s mouth as he tasted the other man on his tongue. They kissed until their lips were numb, until their hands hands thoroughly mapped out the others body, until the early morning hours.
“I don’t care!” she cut him off, practically hissing the words at him. “The thing is, even though you started this for all the wrong reasons, I really enjoyed hanging out with you, Sam. And I think you did too. I really was starting to believe you were different, so I don’t get how I was so stupid to-”
Sam grimaced and replied, “There isn’t enough brain bleach for that, jerk. I’ve seen more of you than I ever wanted to see.”
Dean couldn’t help but smile. Anyone that appreciated his baby was immediately awarded brownie points. He jogged around the back of the car, getting into the driver’s seat and turning over the ignition.
“He’s through here,” said the nurse as she stopped in front of room 494. “He will be a little out of it for a few hours so try not to let it get to you. Also boys, there will be an officer coming by to talk to you and take a statement about what happened. Don’t worry, you’re not in trouble or anything. We just want to find out what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.”
The cast on his arm made cutting the pancakes up one handed a lot harder than he anticipated, and the syrup certainly didn’t help. “Cas is coming here straight after school, so I won’t even be alone all that long.”
Once everyone was situation, Dean half expected it to be chaos. And while there was a multitude of paper being tossed everywhere, Gabriel taking delight in balling up the wrapping to chuck it at each of his siblings, Dean and Sam in turn, it was actually the calmest Christmas Dean had ever been in. Since it was hosted at Castiel's house, Cas became the point man, picking out a present for everyone in attendance. Even the kids were patient, waiting until everyone had a gift to open before they were given the go ahead. Dean took on the role of picture taker, and made sure to get a picture of everyone with each gift after they were opened.
“One of John’s ex-girlfriends works in the hospital. She never approved of me and John dating, let alone having Dean, and she likes to cause trouble. It wouldn’t surprise me if she called John,” answered Mary. “Listen, I’m on my way. If John shows up, don’t let him near Dean.”
“It’s a good job I have my good old British stiff upper lip, or I might be quite wounded by your words.” Balthazar interrupted, smiling mischievously at his friend, before using his stethoscope to listen carefully to his chest.
have invited Castiel if I had known he would bring Sam,” started Charlie as soon as she closed the door.
"Jimmy isn't the only one," Amelia started again, drawing Castiel's attention back to her, "I really like Dean, too. I think he's good for you. Hell, for this family. I don't think I've ever seen Gabriel prank someone so quickly, or Michael be so invested in talking about
"Uncle Gabriel!" Claire's screech broke through Gabriel's obnoxious singing, followed by the slam of a door and a muffled scream, "Shut
“Yeah, probably.” Castiel laughed as he nodded. “Seeing as how both Mr. Thompson and Miss Abner get up with the sun, I’d say there's a good chance one of them would throttle you if you started up a chainsaw.”
"Oh, I can hear him now. But you know, he would've been the first in line if she asked to do a makeover."
with the most bizarre looking D. Dean saw the recognition come over the side of Sam’s face. He knew the other Winchester realized that underneath the new name had been a Sam. Sam turned and came face to face with his 'brother'.
“No, I swear, I had no idea. Which is weird since Sam and I have been best friends since we were little, we practically grew up toge--, I’m sorry. You probably don’t want to hear that.” Apparently Dean wasn't as good at hiding his feelings as he had hoped. “Look I’m sure he would have told me about you, now that I live here. We just didn’t have a lot of time alone together and that small time we had, he used to tell me all about this literature class that the kid--” Dean saw the wheels in Cas’s head turn and Dean knew he had figured it out, when he found himself in the center of Castiel’s attention. It felt like Castiel could see right through him. But the weird thing was, he didn’t seem angry just curious. “--that you signed him up for.”
The conversation in the car was light, both of them lost in their own thoughts, anticipation thick between them. Castiel’s hand was warm on Dean’s thigh, causing a slight buzz in his blood that made him push the gas pedal down just a little bit harder.
“Your teachers tell me you weren't in class this morning. Care to tell me why?” When Sam didn’t offer an excuse right away, Principal Crowley added, “Sam, you are one of the smartest students we have in this school. It would be a shame to screw up all that hard work now. I get that you want to impress those morons you hang out with,” he ignored the disapproving look thrown at him from the officer, “but you
“Nothing I can’t handle,” replied Dean, just barely sticking his fork into the next bite before his mom pulled the plate away and stood up.
Dean put the first tree back, picking up the second one and giving that a slow twirl between them. “Personally,” he said, leaning them both against the wall and moving to stand at Castiel’s side, “I like taller trees. I feel like the spacing between the ornaments is better and there’s something…” he trailed off, looking down at his feet for a moment.
“Where is he? I mean, he didn’t get any worse, did he?” A pit of anxiety is forming in Dean’s stomach and he’s starting to feel slightly sick. First Ellen, now if Castiel has gotten worse before he got the chance to talk to him properly…
“No, he doesn’t know yet,” answered Dean. "Castiel and I talked about it last night. We don’t want him to hear about it from someone else, so Castiel going to tell Sam about us after school tomorrow. I just have to hope Sam doesn’t kill me after he finds out.”
Dean choked and took a moment to catch his breath. He pretended to look offended and turned to Castiel. “It does not taste like ass.”
Charlie was at a loss for words. It was so… so neat and organized! The total opposite of Dean’s -- they got opposite ends of the gene pool there. Charlie had lost count of how often she had watched Dean turn his bag upside down to spill everything all over his desk just because he couldn’t find a piece of paper in between all the others. A few times, she had taken his bag and organized everything into his folder, including this afternoon to make
Dean bent down to pick up one of the balls that was on the floor next to him. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll see you tomorrow. That is, if John doesn't kill me.”
As they made their way through the huge underground network of buildings and walkways, they had to follow a series of maps, which were posted periodically, in order to find where they were going. Their tour with Charlie had been helpful, but the place was simply too large to have been able to commit much of anything to memory in such a short amount of time. It would be quite a while yet before either of them could confidently navigate their new environment unaided.
Al continued chuckling, not bothering to get up from the floor. “But,” he panted through cracked and bleeding lips, “don't you wanna hear about how he begged? How he
they've got me in. What the hell?!” He turned to Charlie, who had finally looked up from her notes in order to take in Dean's dramatics. “Charlie, man, do I really have to wear this?”
“No! It's not okay, Dean. They never should've put you in that position, to begin with. It was an absolute horror show!”
Cas shifted uncomfortably, his ears turning red. “I did not... um...” Unable to refute the accusations, he simply cleared his throat and said, “I'll go make myself a plate.” With that, the Alpha got up and did as he said.
Cas was ready for this one. “He was upset after what happened, so I drew him a bath to relax. He's still in the bathroom now.”
“Ah!” Hector exclaimed in understanding. “Yeah, that happens. And that would explain your progress. I was starting to think I wasn't given you enough info to go on.”
“Yes,” Meg intoned, “he has. And it's not something I'm keen on enduring myself. It's this hell or a completely different kind of hell, and I've gotta tell ya-”
Benny and Jody politely greeted the new members halfheartedly, but there were a million questions that needed to be answered. None of this made any
“Dean!” Cas put his arms around the other man just as Dean lost his balance, and was able to lower him to the floor. “Dean?! Dean are you-”
And how could Cas deny anything to this man when he begged so beautifully? Dean spread his legs, and without a word, Cas reached down with one hand, lining himself up with Dean's drenched and waiting hole before pushing in, burying himself to the hilt in one long, glorious thrust. Once fully seated he immediately started up a fast pace, unable to control himself from pounding into Dean's deliciously tight heat. He let out a feral growl when Dean's errant hand started roaming again, even though the naughty appendage was
“Alright,” Dean swallowed a lump of nerves that had suddenly formed in his throat. “So, I take it I'm s'posed to be the mechanic?”
“That's great!” Amy said. “It seems like Alphas are the only ones with some sense around here. But what about the Omega facilities?”
Benny stopped his pacing and whirled around to face the smaller Beta. He was breathing heavily after his rant, his pale, blue eyes were piercing and wild as he pinned Jody with an intimidating glare.
“Well, that was an ordeal,” Jody commented as she sank back down in her chair once they were safely back in Conference Room A.
I just had to go in so the medics could confirm that I'm still fit for work, and to give me a, uh, shot of sorts.”
Dean just stared at her, not having a clue what she was going on about. When he didn't answer her, she looked at him from the corner of her eye, then pointedly shifted her eyes to the coffee table with the discarded handbook still resting on top.
Once they were sure they were alone and had absolute privacy, Jody whirled around to face Benny, saying, “It's all a sham! The Council. Gabriel's death, Anna's resignation. I'm sure you've figured all of this out by now?”
“Make it an hour, then,” Jody amended. “We've got a lot of ground to cover. I don't want to delay any longer than we need to.”
It was a hunt well done. The tulpa had been destroyed, and there was nothing left to do, except head back to the bunker and maybe start looking for another hunt. Later.
He walked for just a few minutes by the time he'd reached the end of the hall. Flipping a mental coin, he decided to go left again and continued on his way.
Dean's stomach, once roiling and miserable, suddenly chose that moment to growl loudly, demanding to be filled. “Sounds like a plan.”
Jody and Benny waited patiently for her to get back, but they didn't have to wait long. A short while later, Donna returned, looking a bit irritated.
“Uh, yes. Of course,” Cas said. He turned around and led Dean back to their bedroom to wait for the Councilmen to call them again. They sat on the bed with their backs resting against the headboard and Dean rested his head on Cas's shoulder.
!” After each request the waited, but nothing ever appeared. “Well, son of a bitch.” He huffed again before saying, “Well what now?”
Benny hopped off the bus and headed for the kitchen, hoping that Amy was still there so he didn't have to track her down. He'd drag her back to the bus by her blond ponytail if he had to, just to keep her from causing any more mayhem.
It's like all of his senses had left him. What if Dean was pissed at him again? What if he had really hurt him? “Yes, Dean?” Cas finally answered. But his fears were once again unfounded as Dean spoke.
Dean was panting and sweaty. The places where Cas's body came in contact with his were on fire. He rolled over to face the other man, causing Cas's arm to fall from his side, his breathing loud in his own ears. As he shifted, a wetness gushed from his backside, wetting his buttocks and thighs. “Cas...” Dean called. Cas was still sleeping, but his breathing was just as ragged as Dean's, maybe even a little worse. When he didn't rouse at Dean's first call, Dean shouted louder, this time shaking the man by the shoulder. “Cas!”
Oak and cinnamon. That was the scent that Dean woke up to. It was home and it was safety and comfort. It was also highly arousing. Dean let out a low growl as he opened his eyes and met Cas's with a hungry, almost feral gaze. “Cas!” Dean was immediately breathless and breathing hard, a thin sheen of sweat suddenly broke out all over his body, his cock instantly gaining diamond crushing abilities. He grabbed the Alpha and brought their lips together in a bruising and desperate kiss. “Cas... I need... you to... fuck me...
his mate, were going to leave the walls of the facility for the first time since arriving. And just when he was getting used to the idea of never seeing the light of day again. He was getting out!
“Right, right, ya don't know yet. But you will. I promise you, once those little ones are out in the world, they're gonna be the love of your life. Mark me on that.”
I'm SO sorry about this guys. I just hope this chapter was worth the wait. Let me know what you guys think in the comments below. *fingers crossed* And this chapter was actually so long I decided to break it up into two chapters. Seriously, it was over 11,000 words, and I usually only do between 4,000 and 6,000 words. So yeah, had to break that up.
Since they didn't really feel up to doing anything anyways, they decided it would be best to just lie down and get some rest before anything
“Yes,” Amara said, clearly not shy about making her voice heard, “Gordon and I thought it would be worth revisiting policy numbers 3698 and 3699, regarding Phase Two and Omega mates, respectively.”
, was each other. Dean very nearly got lost in the cinnamon and oak scent of his Alpha and Castiel was strongly drawn to the sweet berries and honey scent of
“I'm sorry Dean. I was looking forward to it as well, until I realized we'd have to wear these suits.”
pups. I don't like other people's pups, just my own,” the Beta added at the look of confusion on Dean's and Cas's faces. “Other people's kids are loud and messy, and don't get me wrong, mine are too, but... I dunno, it's just different when it's your own, ya know?”
It was a set of four diagrams of reproductive organs. They were labeled clearly as “Omega Female Reproductive System”, “Omega Male Reproductive System”, “Alpha Female Reproductive System”, and “Alpha Male Reproductive System”.
“Oh, that's just because they were brought in together from the tailors' department. They had your measurements, and they sent down your clothes when they were done. But whoever's responsible for stocking this place does a piss-poor job of it. They could've left them in a place where they'd be easy to find, but
“Okay, so,” Charlie began, “you, Dean, are an Omega male, so we'll just be focusing on that diagram for the moment.” She pulled a small laser pointer out of one of her pants pockets and used it to indicate the sections of the diagram she wished to discuss. “Here you can see the uterus of the Omega male... which leads to the cloacal flap... which opens into the rectum.
choose, I just wanna know what my freaking options are here! Is this place even equipped for something like that?”
Cas obliged, drawing his cock back out until he had almost completely withdrew from Dean's tight, wet heat, and then snapping his hips forward burying himself once again. They both moaned filthily as Cas set the pace, the heat building in between them causing a thin sheen of sweat to form on their conjoined bodies as they moved together. Cas fucked into Dean, and Dean bucked hips up to meet each of Cas's thrusts.
“I mean, think about it. When women are aroused, they produce their own lubrication to make sex easier and more satisfying, right?” Cas supplied.
“Dean!” Cas answered from the living room. He jumped up from the couch and headed directly over to his mate, worry etched into every line of his face as he rushed over and embraced his pregnant mate. “I've been given an assignment!
“Silas, call this in to the Administrator, and somebody get that body covered up until the medical examinator can get to it.” Silas moved off to do as he was told and another of the guards went to find a sheet to cover the body. A sheet was found in the linen closet in the hallway of the apartment, and it was immediately draped over the body. Once that was done, the leader looked back at Cas, eyebrows raised expectantly, and said, “Well?”
They walked down the winding, cement staircase side-by-side, not stopping until they reached the bottom. It let out into a wide hallway that ran left and right. A series of doors, some opened and some closed, lined the bare, utilitarian walls.
Dean took a deep breath to calm himself and just sat back to wait patiently as they made their ascent.
“Oh yeah,” Charlie said, pointing with her pen. “The red and black goes to Castiel, and the teal and forest green goes to Dean.” Instructions given, she went back to her papers, scratching furiously with her pen.
“Yes. This was all very unexpected,” Cas commented. He glanced at Dean accusingly, though there was no heat in his glare. The Omega responded with a small shrug, but said nothing on the subject. He did however walk away, mumbling something about some 'damn pickle juice' and left his mate to converse with his colleague. “It's nice to have another familiar face on this trip though,” Cas continued, returning his attention to the Beta doctor.
When Sam woke up, he immediately checked on each of his mates, paying special attention to Jess. The feisty Omega had to shoo her mate and bondmates away when their hovering began to grate on her (though she secretly loved it). Gabriel cursed Jody and Benny under his breath for nearly causing him to lose this. His family. The happiness he'd found after the disaster of a mating he'd had with Zach and his bondmate Kip.
“So,” Al asked conversationally, that oily smirk once again plastered to his face, “what is it that you two would like to discuss?” He lounged back, looking far too comfortable as he looked down his lashes at his hosts, though he paid greater attention to Dean than he did to Cas.
“Well, that's my best estimate. It's really hard to keep track of time in this place with no windows or clocks. But yes. Like I said: a lot has happened.”
Benny turned and made his way over to the space behind the bar. Just like before, he reached underneath the bar and let the fingerprint scanner scan his finger. Once the beep sounded, the hidden panel in the bar slid open and he quickly punched in the code that once again opened the wall behind him. The mirror and shelves slid to open and the lit passageway was revealed once more.
!” Little Dean was standing at full attention. How did he not notice that?! Upon further inspection, Dean saw that Cas was at full mast as well, although it looked like the other man had already discovered that fact since he seemed to be inspecting it.
After that, they each relaxed a bit more as they talked – though Dean was the one who did most of the relaxing since Meg had already seemed as relaxed as she could possibly get. They ate more fruit together (Dean only grumbled slightly), and gossiped.
“Well...” the usually perky Beta sighed and crossed her arms over her chest. “There's not really much to say. You guys messed up, but you owned up to it. You apologized – multiple times – and the ones you hurt the most have given you their answers: they don't forgive you. Yet. And some of them probably never will. I can't imagine Castiel having anything nice to say about either of you. And I...” she took a deep breath before she continued, “I don't condone what you've done, but I understand where you're comin' from, I really do. But it's gonna take some time before you're back in anyone's good graces.” She met each of their gazes and said, “You're just gonna have to give it some time. There's no other way around it.”
Dean nervously runs a hand over the back of his head before extending a hand out to Blue-Eyes. "I'm Dean," he says.
Cas picked up the pace even more, ramming in and out of Dean impossibly fast, pounding his abused prostate with renewed fervor again and again and again, until Dean was sure he was going to pass out before Cas delivered the promised relief. Then suddenly they were coming. Together. Cas let out a strangled, but controlled wail, while Dean seemed to shatter underneath him. He didn't just come, he exploded. His cock, which had turned a ruddy purple spouted a geyser of come from his overly swollen balls. He gushed onto his and Cas's stomachs and even got some on his own chin, Cas's chest and the door to the Impala, and he thinks he even saw some getting on the ceiling. None of it mattered though, because the next thing he knew was the darkness that claimed him as he slipped blissfully into unconsciousness.
“Hm,” Dean said thoughtfully. “Well, in that case... I wish we had a way out of here!” He exclaimed loudly, bending his arms up at the elbows and spreading his arms out, spinning around to face the rest of the room expectantly. When nothing happened he said, “Exit? Doorway? Open says me?”
“You're not gonna hurt me, Cas,” Dean interrupted, suppressing an eye roll. “Come on, lie next to me.” When Cas still hesitated he added, “Please.”
In front of them were dozens of abandoned cars, to the left and right. A crew must have came through and pushed them all aside, creating a path, since the way ahead of them was clear down the middle of the road. To the right, he was able to get a better look at some of the cars as they passed by. Many of them were empty, and some were completely burned out, leaving nothing but a rusted metal frame behind.
He shifted. Ah, there it was. He gasped as a fresh wave of pain soared through his body, leaving him wheezing and struggling for air.
Cas just wanted to protect his mate from whatever was about to happen, but when he looked into Dean's eyes, all he saw was anger and... betrayal? No, he didn't want that. He wanted to protect his mate, but not at the cost of pushing him away. Cas heaved a heavy sigh, shoulders slumping once more in defeat, but he gave Dean a small, almost imperceptible nod, and the spell was broken.
it disappeared to was another mystery, since there was no hole or other opening for the water to disappear
Sometime later, Dean and Cas were able to finish their abandoned meals. Then, the same Omega who had served them – with the emblem of two concentric circles on her sleeve, a symbol of service status – came and took away their dishes. Afterwards, the three of them took a short bathroom break, each of them using one of the three lavatories – one for each of the primary designations: Alpha, Beta and Omega. It was surprising to see that there were actual toilets and sinks in the bathrooms, instead of the strange fountains that they'd become accustomed to.
“Okay, doc,” Dean said with a sigh as he met the doctor's eyes, “so what's next?” Cas squeezed his shoulders tighter, reassuring his Omega with his presence.
Not when Cas was nowhere to be seen. The only other times he had ever felt this way was when he and Cas were being commanded to-
Dean sighed again as he returned Cas's embrace. “Just... I dunno. I guess everything that happened yesterday is finally startin' to sink in.” Dean seemed to tremble just a bit and his voice hitched in his throat.
Dean was the first to recover from the surprise. “Oh, um, I'm Dean and this is my mate, Cas,” he made the introductions, pointing first to himself, then to his mate.
!” He enunciated each word of the last sentence, trying the best he could to properly convey his distress to his mate. He knew Dean must have been able to scent his distress in the air, so why wasn't the Omega more upset than he was?
“Hmm.” Cas thought for a moment before he asked, “What are we supposed to be doing here? Do you know?”
Dean's arms dropped back to his sides before he turned to look incredulously at Cas. “Yeah, well it was worth a try.”
“You got the buttons, Gabe?” Benny asked. Gabriel stumbled out a yes, and pressed a few buttons on a sleek, black remote, and a few moments later the entrance was groaning open.
” Dean leaned back as he gave the go-ahead, leaving just one arm stretched out on the table, while the other elbow was hooked over the back of his chair. “
Benny and Jody looked at each other, their gazes full of meaning. After a few moments, Benny said, “Would you guys give us a moment? There's some things we need to discuss.”
Cas growled at the other Alpha's retreating form. Whether or not Alistair heard it remained a mystery since he just kept moving away, giving no indication one way or the other.
eradicated that portion of phasing, now they were bringing it back before any Omegas could even be spared the atrocities. “Wait-”
Charlie huffed out a tiny laugh and Cas smiled fondly at Dean's displeasure as the Omega's pout deepened. Dean didn't know why, but he felt like he'd like to cook... something. Was that part of being an Omega? Or was that something that he liked to do, even before all of this? He didn't know and he didn't really care, he just wanted a proper kitchen, but it looked like he wouldn't be getting one.
to be doin' with that knowledge, Jody?” He shook his head at the thought and leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes as he did so.
“Hm? Oh, nothing,” Donna answered as if she'd been pulled from a thought. “I found them all in the kitchen. They said they're on their way. But I just got the suspicion that Amy's starting trouble again.”
one more time before he left. Eileen and Jessica were both strong Omegas, but they were still very close with their bond-mate. They'd no doubt be just as devastated as Sam. The Alpha loves all of his Omegas dearly, so this was no doubt a huge blow.
Intellectually, Dean knows that the other man is just as much a victim as he is: neither of them gave their consent, they were both literally forced into their current positions against their will, but that doesn't make Dean feel any better about what's happening. Especially since he is still
The fields bordering either side of the street had been scorched and nothing was growing. Everything was grey and lifeless. Blackened wooden pillars stood sentry at random intervals. It took Dean longer than he'd like to admit to realize that they were the remnants of trees.
Also, I'd like to mention that it has come to my attention that there was also a blond woman named Amy in the show. She was Sam's friend when they were kids, then Dean killed her. I'd forgotten about her, and she is NOT the Amy in this story. She just so happens to be another blond with the same name. I'm sorry for any confusion this may have caused.
large, there was still plenty of room between its edges and the walls. After a few moments, Dean, who deemed it safe enough to join in, made his way over to Cas. He had to hold out his arms for a few steps to catch himself from falling, but once he regained his balance he confidently strode around the area, bouncing playfully here and there.
desperate. Just how I like 'em,” Alistair crooned against Dean's ear. “Maybe I'll even get you to cum,” Alistair licked a strip up Dean's neck. “If that happens, maybe I'll get to keep you. Then you'll
Al chuckled, clearly amused by the pair's blundering. “It wasn't a full...” he paused, looking for the right word, “I guess you could call it a
to orchestrate all of this. The more he thought about it, the more he believed that Gabriel couldn't have
When he was finally sure that nothing was going to happen, Cas spoke to Alfie again. “Alfie, put your ass down, and get up.”
Jody nodded, seeming to know where Benny was going with his train of thought. “The guy's mates aren't gonna be happy about it.”
“Oh, I heard we've got some new neighbors. I've been off work since yesterday and I've got some time on my hands. Just I thought I'd stop by, say hello. Be sociable, you know?”
“I think this is the most amazing thing in the world,” he said with complete ease and more than a little awe. “I think the most wonderful thing that could ever happen is for there to be more of
The air seemed to leave the room. He was getting a prickly sensation all along his back. “What the hell do you mean? Each one of those can't be a kid!”
But, the biggest factor that contributed to contracting the virus, was that delayed effect that it had. That delay allowed people to come in contact with the more and more people each day, as they went about their business, blissfully unaware that they were carrying and spreading a deadly pathogen. It moved amongst the population with the speed and effectiveness of a biological weapon.
After a few minutes, Cas began to relax. His muscles, which had tensed up to the point where they were nearly cramping, loosened a fraction. He was still wary though. He didn't want to relax completely, in case they were just trying to catch him off guard before forcing him into position. He waited a few more minutes before moving or talking again, just to be sure that he and Alfie were both safe.
“He's right over there.” Caleb pointed down the aisle to a Beta male leaning against another Jeep, his arms were crossed and he was watching the exchange between Dean and Caleb with mild interest. “He's already been informed of the situation.”
he is. I just know he's safe. That's a message I have to give you. So you don't worry too much. Although, you're gonna worry anyways, no matter what I tell you. That's what Alphas do: worry about their mates. Nevertheless, I am to give you peace of mind in this regard. Your mate
“Don't be so dramatic, Dean.” Cas rolled his eyes at his mate's antics. Dean couldn't see the gesture from the backseat but the Alpha couldn't hide the amusement in his voice.
Cas became tense when he heard that. He was expecting it, but the thought of them speaking with his mate, while the Omega was in such a fragile state of mind, caused Cas's protective tendencies to manifest themselves in the form of aggression. He scowled at the other Alphas in front of him as a low growl rose up from his chest and the singed scent of anger seeped up from his pores.
“Alright, darlin', I see your point,” Benny conceded, nodding a bit, deep in thought. “So... gettin' rid of the Alphas, huh? That's big.”
Dean grunted at the extra weight and shifted uncomfortably. Cas apologized and lifted up again, rolling and bringing Dean with him so that they were both lying on their sides. Once they were comfortable, they waited, sated and content, in each other's embrace for Cas's swollen knot to shrink enough to release them.
Halfway across the room, Charlie stopped, suddenly realizing that her charges were no longer by her side. She turned around in a complete circle before finding the pair right where she'd left them by the door. She rushed back to them, a knowing smile plastered to her face. “Yeah, I know. It's a lot to take in, right?”
“Are there any other requirements or recommendations?” Cas asked. “Dietary restrictions, bed rest, anything?”
at first!” They shared a laugh, then after a few moments, Hector said, “So, you ready to get started?”
“I know, that's Amy” Benny groaned. “I couldn't find Hector. And Caleb couldn't come because he has to oversee the garage with Hector gone missing.”
anywhere in order to attend. Braving the harsh wasteland that used to be Earth was not something that he wanted to do again any time soon. He'd lost two members of his party the last time he'd gone out.
uncomfortable,” Dean grumped unhappily, his voice muffled by the layers of hard plastic between his mouth and the ears of anyone listening. He crouched and pulled at the yellow material between his legs, trying to force more space in the area for his goods. It was no use.
it a long time ago? He still didn't know exactly how long it had been since he'd seen Dean and he was beginning to miss his mate terribly.
“Why all the hostility?” he asked. “Surely a couple of neighbors can have a friendly chat in the halls.”
Some of Cas's senses returned to him at the knowledge that he'd scared the boy so badly. He took a deep breath to steady himself, breathing through his mouth, to avoid breathing in any more of the scent of fear. Once he felt he was calm enough, he knelt down in front of the small, sobbing creature in the corner and spoke to him as softly and reassuringly as possible.
like it, huh?” Gabriel retorted. “Didn't you notice how odd they were acting right before the attack? Jody was looking around like she was
“Thank you,” the doctor said, though still slightly gruff. “Tell me if anything hurts.” Dean nodded and the doctor proceeded to poke and prod at Dean's sides and abdomen, paying special attention to the space directly below his bellybutton. “Hmm...” the doctor intoned, pressing a little firmer into the area, though still not enough to cause any pain.
“Cas-” Dean tries again, but is cut off as another orgasm rips from his body. “Fuck!” he shouts. Head thrown back, back arching off the seat.
“Stow it, you two. No time for that now.” Charlie gently scolded without looking up, although she did have to stifle a small chuckle and a grin at their antics.
“Are you...” he paused, swallowed hard, “are you sure you don't remember anything from when we were separated?”
By this time, Cas had eaten his fill from his own platter of food. He stood up, collected his and Deans mostly empty platters, and replaced them on the counters where they came from. Then, he went over to the newly-formed flow and drank his fill in the same fashion as Dean, tilting his head back to catch the water in his open mouth.
At one point, Jody, who had been looking out her window, saw movement in the trees to the left of the bus. She swiveled her head as she tracked it, wondering if it was some of their own people, or the Alpha Councilmen's. As quickly as she saw it, whatever it was, soon it was gone as they continued their journey, and Jody swung back around and continued her surveillance.
The accompanying pain-pleasure caused Cas to involuntarily thrust his hips forward again as another pulse of cum was rocketed out of his cock, which was still buried to the hilt in Dean's tight hole. He groaned and ground his hips against Dean, making his knot rub up against Dean's prostate and forcing another orgasm from him as well. He moaned against Cas's neck, clamping down into his flesh even harder, as a few more ropes of cum coated their conjoined bodies.
What the hell was that? How did he know what Alistair had said to Meg as they'd mated for the first time?
Just when he was about to give up and head back the way he'd come, he started hearing voices up ahead. His first instinct was to hide, his heart rate sped up a few notches and he could feel the organ persistently clawing its way up his throat. He was caught! He should definitely hide!
He and Cas had been the last ones left in the supply room. The others had already gotten fully dressed out in the large, one-piece, yellow suits which were worn over their uniforms. It was a little harder to tell everyone apart, since the only part of them that was visible were their faces through the large, plastic masks attached to their hoods. But the built-in oxygen filter covered the lower half of their faces, which made individual identification even more difficult.
bite. It just seemed like the right thing to do. The whole situation just seemed instinctual, like they didn't even have to think about any of it: the respective shows of dominance and submission; the marking and cleansing, seeming almost ritualistic.
, except more bare walls. "I guess not," he admits. He seems to deflate a bit, suddenly looking like he doesn't know what else to do. He almost seems a bit defeated.
“Um... yes.” His shoulders, which had begun to relax, stiffened once again. “A shower would be nice, thank you.” Alfie had seemed to gain a bit of himself back after Cas asked him if he was alright, but now the robotic facade was back in place.
“Cum for me, Dean. You can do it. Come on, sweetheart,” Cas said through heavy breaths, whispering his encouragement into Dean's ear with his lust-husky voice.
?” Lilith scowled at the Beta before her, signals of anger and distress pouring off of her in waves so strong that even Benny's Beta nose could detect them. “Those assholes killed my mate and you want me to be
Dean reached up to Cas's hand, still resting on his shoulder reassuringly, and gave a small squeeze for comfort. Cas squeezed back before letting his hand fall and taking a step back to give Dean some room to move, while still remaining within reach.
They drove out into the open, and the door shut closed behind them. This time, however, there wasn't an air of unease coming from the Beta Councilmen. Benny was relaxed in his seat behind the wheel, and Jody wasn't scanning the landscape looking for trouble.
a very strong and very new sensation, though he managed to maintain control of his baser instincts – but only barely.
He panicked. He shouted in alarm and banged on the panel, trying to get it to open once more, but it was no use. It wouldn't budge. He grabbed the screwdriver out of his pocket and tried wedging it between the panel and the edge of the opening, but there was an airtight seal around it, and the tool simply wouldn't fit.
“I'm going with him,” Jess announced. She got up on her own, despite her bulging belly, and quickly followed after her bondmate out.
“The Alpha Councilmen and their guards have all been apprehended. As for the rest, those are very good questions, and believe me, I asked. So did Sam, Gabriel and the others. But Benny and Jody are keeping their mouths shut at the moment. They won't tell us anything.” Cas's scent turned slightly sour for a moment before settling down again. The Betas' silence was obviously grating his Alpha's nerves.
Cas couldn't say no to the pleading look in Dean's eyes. He leaned down and kissed his mate tenderly before beginning to thrust into him once more. It didn't take long for him to resume his previous pace, and before long he was back at his breakneck speed, fucking into Dean with reckless abandon. Beneath him, Dean was jutting his hips up and down, meeting each and every one of Cas's thrusts with his own, apparently still desperate for more.
Charlie, the perky little redhead, turned back around and bounded off again. Dean and Cas looked at each other, shrugged, then followed after her. Dean took one last look behind them, getting a look at their room from the other side of those four walls. They were on the opposite side from where they came down the ramp. Dean was amazed to discover that he could see straight through! The walls must have been two way because he could see everything! The room was raised up a few feet from the floor where he currently stood. It was in the center of an even larger room with nothing else in it.
Meg nodded in agreement and the trio fell silent. They watched as others who were there before they got called back with their youngsters in tow, silently wondering when it would be their turn. After a while, Dean spoke up.
“Yeah, seriously!” Dean vehemently agreed. He waited his turn to shake Benny's hand as well and then gave Jody a crushing hug for good measure.
“Oh, yeah,” Charlie chuckled a bit, relieved by the innocence of the question, which could potentially lead to calmer discussion. “We've affectionately started calling children 'pups' around here, because of the similarities that the Alphas and Omegas share with wolves. You know: mates, knotting, heats, biting, et cetera.”
Dean extended his wrist out to the doctor where it was scanned with a little device from his pocket, very similar to the one the nurse had used, but this one was slightly larger and had a tiny display screen. The doctor input a few commands then placed it back in his pocket.
“Ah, ah, ah,” Alistair admonished in a sing-song tone. “What did I say about naughty Omegas, hm? Naughty Omegas don't get to orgasm.”
“Oh shut it!” Dean demanded playfully. They both chuckled in a friendly manner for a few moments before Dean asked, “Can you get off of me or what?”
“Yeah, thanks,” Dean mumbled. Once the nurse closed the door, Dean turned to Cas, who had taken a seat in one of the provided chairs. “Now I've gotta wait some more? What the hell is this crap?!”
Dean smiled indulgently and dropped the empty duffle bags he was still carrying on the floor. Cas noticed them for the first time, but before he could question Dean about them, the Omega wrapped his arms around his panicking mate and guided the Alpha's head to the crook of his neck, hoping that his scent would help to calm his nerves. It worked, and the scorched scent of distressed Alpha quickly dissipated.
“And,” Cas continued, “being in close proximity to Alistair and reminiscing with his mate about past abuse... all of that probably triggered some of your own memories. We were warned that memory erasure is a tricky business.”
He didn't want to leave his mate alone for too long. The Omega seemed nearly catatonic, but there were things that needed to be done. While Dean soaked, Cas gathered his mates bloodied clothing and dumped them down the laundry chute. He then made his way back to the living room where the bloody remains of their neighbor lay, still leaking like a sieve, staining their floor.
Their own little haven, where it was just the two of them and nobody else. It was where they mated and became one. Hell, it was where they'd met after Dean woke up in the room, and Cas was led down that super long corridor and-
Dean thought about it for a moment but came up blank. “I have no idea, Cas. I just... I don't know.”
There were a number of different reactions. Benny paused despite his protesting bladder and stared at the Alpha in disbelief; Jody flat out guffawed; Amy rolled her eyes with a smug smirk and stalked out of the room; Donna giggled and followed close behind. Benny just shook his head and turned to leave and Jody followed behind him. The woman was still cackling, though, to her credit, she was
Benny was grateful that the Omega had decided to clam it. He was upset with the man and just didn't want to hear his voice at the moment. There was too much to do and there wouldn't be enough time to do it all if they had to keep stopping for distractions. And Dean had been a
Dean looked up and smiled at his mate. Unable to resist, the Alpha pressed a chaste kiss to the Omega's lips. Dean returned the gesture and the two of them pulled away, smiling lovingly at each other. Dean leaned up and pressed another kiss to Cas's lips, this one less chaste, more heated.
Without another word, the Beta turned on her heal and continued walking away. Dean and Cas looked at each other for a moment, before quickly following close behind. They were just happy to be out of that room and just going somewhere – on their own two feet, no less. So, with equal parts excitement and trepidation, they followed the small and energetic woman.
Benny mentally shook himself and refocused his attention on the irate Omega in from of him. “Look, I'm real sorry about what happened to your mate, but I still need ya to go back to your home, alright? I still need to examine the scene and talk with the witnesses – if there are any – and I won't know what to do about any of this until then. I know how impatient you must be, how angry you are, but I'm gonna have to ask ya to be patient with me. Can ya do that?”
“Guys, guys, everything's fine,” she held her free hand up in a placating gesture. “Nothin' to get worked up over. I just understand now why the doctor was a little concerned.”
He burst into his office's anteroom, where his secretary jumped up from his desk, started by the sudden entrance, and said, “Sir, the rest of the Council members have already rung in. They're waiting for you now.”
Gabriel barked out a laugh in response, and just like that the mood was lifted. Everyone chuckled or openly laughed and even Dean smiled against Cas's neck, his stomach having finally settled down again.
Dean gulped down the glass of water greedily as Cas talked, then sighed in relief. That was much better. After a few moments, Dean frowned as he thought about what Cas had just said. Then the memories came flooding back. The ambush! The Alpha Councilmen had found them. Had attacked them. And then... and then...
There was a metal cart sitting in the hall across from the elevator, so once it was opened he wheeled the thing into the space ahead of him. He wasn't sure how big the jar of pickles was, and he didn't want to work any harder than he had to, so the cart would come in handy. Once inside, he pushed the button for the doors to close, then the next button had the elevator whirring to life and carrying him down to the next level.
“Nope. Nothing much, just the usual, y'know? No heavy lifting... no runnin' faster than a jog... no alcoholic beverages... although you'll be hard-pressed to find any of
Frustration built up even more in Dean's chest, and tears prickled the backs of his eyes, threatening to fall, but he refused to let them. He leaned forward, placing his elbows on the table and resting his head in his hands once again. He was feeling lost and defeated. He could argue and protest the injustice of it all until he was blue in the face, but it wouldn't change anything, would it?
see your precious Alpha again. Wouldn't you like that? To be constantly denied over and over, not allowed to cum unless
“You ain’t subtle about the fact that you look for someone, even when we’s in the hallway just walkin’ and talkin’ you just look for someone. Always lookin’.”
Dean drops to his knees next to Cas, grabbing onto his hand squeezing it tight. He shuts his eyes trying to hold back his tears.
Dean protests this of course because A) he’s an excellent driver. Daylight or not. And B) Finally! Something to do! He hates feeling bored, even though he thinks he should be grateful for it. But still, Sam insists that they wait.
Cas lets out a heavy sigh, “I know you mean well Dean, but I’ve come to the realization that I will never understand your human references and I will have to live in the dark about it.”
They never spoke about what happened or acknowledged that they had a full-on make-out session against the wall of the communal bathroom. But Dean noticed Cas leave extra space between them that was never there before. And sure Cas has had a problem with personal space in the past, but Dean’s gotten used to it. It was their normal and now for four days straight Cas has made an effort to keep a distance between them both. The only thing bouncing back to normal was their ability to bicker without any heat.
They sit and wait in their desks. Castiel doesn't turn around to look at Dean, nor does Dean ask him if he knows what's going on. It isn't until everyone files out of the room that Mrs.Anderson then shuts the door.
“Well… Consider this a wedding present…” He pulls up along a curb to a white two-story victorian style house. With a porch along the front and huge windows. There’s a driveway off to the left side, bushes separate the neighbours from each other. The Impala sits there on the pavement, freshly waxed Dean can see.
“Yeah but the both of you-” Sam’s voice drips with haste “were freaking out cause neither of you know how to act without powers. You've both lost your grace before I really don't-" Sam sighs "never mind. Not worth it."
But now, sitting in front of it, he couldn’t believe the barn was still standing after all this time.
Dean lets Sam drive back to their motel in town. Well, Dean’s sat wet and silent in the passenger seat covered in blankets with the heat cranked. He doesn’t say a word to Sam on their drive back, but as they pull into the parking lot Sam suggests that they take their time and go check out the city.
“CAS!” He tries to shout but again, silence. Cas’s face is looking at him so innocently yet full of affection. Dean starts to panic, “CAS! CAS! CASTIEL CAN YOU HEAR ME!?” he shouts.
Every night when they’d come home Dean or Cas would take turns cooking, the odd time having a kid or two help. They’d eat, have the girls fill out their journals they had to do for school and then get ready for bed.
“Don’t eat it all! Did angel school not teach you sharing is caring,” Dean says half-joking, half-serious.
“Uh should be landing in the next hour,” Dean said while chewing “we’ll go get him when he texts that he’s landed.”
Dean needed the escape. Too many thoughts at once swirling through his mind. Jack going off to college? Cas wanting to be human? Him being in love with Cas and admitting it to himself? Damn Winchester, you sure know how to make a situation even more complicated.
Dean and Cas take this at face value and head upstairs, following Gabe and Jack. They grab their suitcases from the trunk and give hugs of thanks and goodbyes. The two younger boys leave as Dean and Cas stand on the sidewalk looking up at their lit up house.
Dean flashes him a curt smile before he goes back to painting. Trying to ignore the ring of ‘you and Cas are pretty much married with a kid right now’ that his inner voice screams at him.
Dean is careful in walking into the room, not wanting to wake and spook the kid. But it’s such a sad sight, Dean’s heart feels like it's shattering with every step he takes, slowly taking a seat on the edge of the bed and putting a hand on Jack’s back.
Dean resists making a smart remark towards Cas, but the guy is bouncing there like he wants to flap out asap. Dean decides that’s enough of a punishment.
Dean slips his hand into Cas’ as they leave the barn, when they exit there’s a slew of family members all standing by the Impala.
They stay like that for a few moments only breathing heard before Jack mumbles “m’sorry… really sorry… I didn’t mean to push you.”
The following morning Dean went to check on Sam only to see Jody feeding him ice chips. Jody smiled and Sam tried too, but still grimaced in pain.
Cas looks up at him, “Thanks” he grins, then proceeds to wink. And for a split second Dean thinks, this is it. Finally, it’s all gonna happen. That Cas is going to let this happen for both of them because Dean’s so ready. He’s semi-hard in his jeans, his brain is screaming of wanting to touch Cas in any way possible, to feel the guy on top of him, to kiss him senseless literally everything that’s been going through his mind for years.
They walk hand in hand until coming up to the old barn, the door creaks as Dean pulls it open. He lets Cas step in before him, inside there are fairy lights hung around the inside of the barn. Glowing against the decaying wood, Cas steps in and looks at the walls. Some of the sigils are still visible, others faded.
“Castiel is more or less a battery at this point... he needs to stay up here to keep Heaven’s energy levels at bay.”
Cas is lying there, his arms across his stomach. His face is sunken in, his hair a mess, and his lips almost a grey color. He looks like he’s only sleeping but the color of his skin is telling that he isn’t well.
“Then tell the kid what’s wrong with him you bitch!” Dean growls. That last comment gets Dean’s voice revoked from his being. Only able to wheeze at this point.
What they didn’t do was talk about Cas. It’s too much. Dean can feel the anger still pulse inside him from the DVD incident. After Sam had talked him down, he opened up each case to see if any were broken, luckily none were. Now they sit on his desk as a painful reminder. It's been three weeks since the last time Dean had heard from him— Dean never bothered in trying to reach out.
It was the third period on the first day of senior year. Dean had history and was walking with Jo to class, he had stepped into the room the odd smell of old tea came from the steaming cup on Mr. Youngman’s desk with a stack of papers ready to be handed out. Dean wasn’t looking forward to learning on the first day. They’d just left summer mode yesterday, there was no way his brain was working. That’s when he turned to look at the desks, Jo called him over to a set of two in the corner but all Dean could notice was the brunette man scribbling into his notebook on the other side of the classroom. It was like the guy knew Dean was staring when he looked up and piercing blue eyes had met his green ones. Taking Dean as far back as ever, Dean just knew he had to know this guy. Except he did the exact opposite, ducked his head and went over to sit with Jo.
But Dean ultimately does feel a little better, and the permanent worry line in Sam’s face has relieved itself a bit. Plus they killed the snakelike-humanoid that was terrorizing the town, so it’s an overall win of a road trip.
They also kept up with Sam and Jody. Making sure that Sam was doing okay and that Jody wasn’t ready to ship him back off to Dean. But no, they were doing fine. Sam was up and walking again, Jody had gone back to work. They were easing into some kind of normalcy for them both. Dean was happy for them.
Dean mutters some other gibberish about how he wants to smite her before finding the keys and settling.
“It’s good. Got midterms next week so more studying of course. But I got an A on my cultural anthropology essay so that’s something.”
When they return back to the real world, Jack picks them up from the airport. Dean being slightly out of it from drugging himself to last the 6 hour flight. He just needs water and sleep he’ll be fine. He hugs Jack and Cas does too. Jack starts asking about how their trip was well loading their things in his jeep. All of them climbing in while Cas goes on and on and concluding about the romantic sunset dinner Dean set up for them on their last night there.
With Cas’ mojo and that's about it they get the place all suited up that night. Everything’s in its spot like Dean imagined it, including Cas sitting in one of the recliners.
They gear up, Dean holding onto the bronze dagger in his jacket pocket. Their holding large machete’s in their hands along with flashlights. But guns are tucked into their belts as a precaution.
When he steps further into the rotting building, a sprinkler system starts pouring water from the ceiling. He spits out the water as it keeps coming, like a torrential downpour indoors. He opens his eyes but barely can before water is seeping into them, blurring his vision completely.
That’s when Charlie and Cas begin a not too bad rendition of I Want To Know What Love Is by Foreigner that gets the whole backyard swooning. And Cas, Cas doesn’t sing too badly Dean almost enjoys it so much that he sways a little bit with the tune imagining all the bumbling in love messes he and Castiel could be.
Shit. Shit too much thinking Winchester. “What no! I mean- I do. I do like the idea of them together. It’s good for Sam, to have someone. He deserves to be with someone that understands the life but can also pull him away from it.”
Dean’s positive he could hear the smugness in Jack’s breathing, Dean knows he’s walked into a trap with this one.
“Sure!” Jack replies with a grin but not before hugging Dean and Cas again “So happy to have you both back” Then he’s skipping off. Literally.
“Cas” Dean tries to argue. Cas can’t give yet another thing to this fraud of a place, Cas owes them nothing for what he’s been put through, it isn’t fair at all. “Cas don’t” Dean croaks, bringing himself to his knees still clutching at his stomach.
Dean stays quiet. Not wanting to startle Cas in case something bad has happened and Cas is having a panic attack. But then all of a sudden there’s the sound of wind in the room and Dean is suddenly on the couch instead of the recliners.
Dean sputters, “Jack don’t give these assholes what they’re wanting okay! They always get their way and they still manage to fuck it up.”
Naomi ignores him, “Heaven has no power supply, this place will start to crumble with all of you inside it.”
Dean was busy making sure the bar stayed cool enough for patrons but also invited in people off the street to come in and take a breather. Dean swore off shorts long ago but today he had to put his morals aside and do what was comfortable.
For a week straight, Sam and Dean work at trying to find a backdoor into Heaven, something that will get them in without alerting the dickbags in the garrison. While researching Dean tries to hone in on that feeling or glow Jack was talking about. He feels for it every morning when he wakes up and every night before he passes out. It’s the one thing that lets him know that Cas is still alive.
Now it’s Sam's turn to growl “So you got turned down! Whoopdefuckingdo! We all suffer heartbreak! I don’t know why you gotta suck everyone else into your shit. ”
“How could we not have fun at a Harvelle party?” Dean smiles and winks at her. “Awe Winchester flattery will get you nowhere in my house. Now drink!”
Dean waits a few moments before turning to look at Cas. Eye’s trained on the TV, looking cozy on the recliner. Dean did grab blankets for both of them even though Cas doesn’t get cold yet he’s still got his legs covered.
Dean nodded before looking over at Cas, “yeah I guess. But Cas got a promotion at the museum. He has his own business cards now” Dean said while pulling one out of his wallet.
Dean creeps closer, Jack’s hands are clenching and shaking with adrenaline. Dean’s familiar with the feeling so he knows better than to pry. Instead, making cautious eye contact with Jack, letting him know silently he’s okay before scooping him into a forceful hug.
When Jack isn’t around, they still search for local cases to work. They did a few smaller ones in neighboring states, returning to the bunker within 48 hours. That routine lasted a total of 43 days and Dean was grateful for the domesticity of it all. But now at 8 pm on a Thursday, Dean’s going on out of his mind.
“Um… Yes? I wanted to test that theory. I asked Sam for clothes but he told me yours would fit better?” Dammit, Sam!
When Dean opens his eyes, all he sees is Jack leaning against the table with his hair in his face breathing hard.
Cas’ eyes meet his and Dean sucks in a short breath. Without fail, Cas’ will always look absolutely breathtaking. Dean feels the urge to look away again, knowing his body is going to betray him by making his heart skip a beat. But he stands his ground, looking directly at Cas with minimal faltering.
“Welcome to the Dean Cave Sammy” Dean chides earning him a grunt from Sam. “Yeah, thanks for the invite…. Wait! You’re watching Raiders? Dude you know that’s one of my favorites!”
Dean sipped on his third beer of the night, feeling incredibly good and buzzed which was nice. He sang lowly along and laughed as Cas did little dance moves and spun Charlie around. The crowd roared clearly loving the show they were getting. Even Jo was standing by the outskirts of the crowd bobbing her head along. She never got drunk at her parties, she knew better that. She had to look after the house but she had enough crazy in her that she didn’t need to get drunk.
Dean follows Castiel over to a secluded part of the backyard, only one couple making out in the corner. Dean grimaces and tells them to get lost, which they do. His voice has seemed to get deeper these last few months making it more dark and frightening but deep down Dean knew he's all bark and no bite.
Dean looks at the digital clock and sees that it’s 2:30 in the morning. Groaning to himself, he grabs his coat and heads to the elevator and out onto the street. It’s true what they say, that this is the city that never sleeps, so Dean doesn’t feel guilty about walking around at this hour.
“Not sure how you did all that but good job” He turns to back to Jack, but Jack shakes his head “wasn’t me.” Dean looks at him confused as he unlocks the cuffs off of Jack’s wrists.
“Sam maybe had the music playing in the war room one day and I searched where it was from okay! Don’t judge,” Dean protests but Cas chuckles, “You’re secret’s safe with me, Dean.”
There’s a minute of nothing and then a low whoosh is heard around the room. Cas suddenly appearing in the room looking disheveled.
Naomi stalks up to him, “You have some of his grace. You both triggered it to be a permanent tie somehow. Castiel’s grace won’t leave his body till he gets it all back.”
Four days later they’re on a hunt in Arizona, looking for a vamp den somewhere in the middle of the desert. They come across tall red rock mountains, bushes, and cacti all in small clusters over hills of red dirt. Sam spots the car that one of the vampires had gotten into with what they assumed was their next feed.
Dean walks closer slowly, feeling like he’s gonna scare the kid as if he’s a lost animal. Cas’ mumbling comforting words to Jack that Dean can’t quite hear but they seem to calm him down. As Dean inches closer he hears Cas say softly, “Let's go inside” as Jack nods and releases Cas from his hold. Only to look up and see Dean standing there smiling genuinely.
“You’ve seen this movie haven't you?” Cas blurts out after Elsa had built her ice castle and had claimed to Let it Go.
Dean detests this new Cas ‘cause for as long as Dean’s known the guy he’s been this formal, stock, and brash being. Even when he was fully human he had a certain naivety around him; all due to the lack of knowledge of human behavior. But now, he’s found himself in this niche of practicing human functionalities. And on top of all that, he’s picked up different ways of expression and behaviors from all the characters he’s watched.
Dean runs a hand over his face, peering down at the digital alarm clock on the bedside table. Reading 3:32 am. About 4 hours of sleep. He yawns before getting up and shrugging his robe and slippers on. He pads out of their bedroom, passing the empty bassinet and down the hall.
Dean takes a deep breath, “Do you actually wish to have all that. Y’know the house, the job, the apple-pie life.”
“DEAN IS CAS WITH YOU!” He shouts from the other line. Dean pulls the phone away from his ear at the volume of Jack’s voice.
The show went to commercial when Jack spoke up “I think you two should have a kid. One that’s actually under 18 at the time of adoption.”
“Tiny fragments of his grace were what pieced you back together. You’re healed but the grace, it’s still there. That’s why you can feel him.”
It was the hottest day in June, literally ever. The temperature was breaking records on multiple accounts.
Cas moved his hand to Dean’s thigh, “honey, you may have changed in different ways but you’re still the same person.”
Dean nodded, “I know. You two are good for each other. It’s strange but this— it’s new beginning for all of us.”
“I don’t remember the last time I sat down to watch an actual movie on a TV. It has to have been years,” Sam says sighing as the Lucasfilm title appears on the screen.
Cas’s coughing fit slows to a stop as he tilts his head to look at Dean, that confused head tilt that Dean was certain he would never see again. He chuckles because he’s already crying and doesn’t know what else to do, “Cas why? Why are you looking at me like that?”
They both exit the car, Dean coming up next to Cas to hold his hand. It’s chilly out with the wind, so it’s a good thing they’re both in their coats. Dean’s in his signature navy zip up. And Cas in the same style, but with less pockets and green colored.
Dean’s been going out of his mind. He’s giving Cas space which means not texting or calling him. While Sam’s been trying to find a case for them to go on but it’s either been taken care of by someone else or doesn’t seem worth checking into. He’s sat on the edge of his bed, his phone in his hand as he tries to focus on something. Literally, anything else that will take his mind off Cas, even for a minute.
“Can I come stay at the bunker for the weekend? I’ll tell everyone there’s a family emergency in San Fran. They’ll buy it and I’ll zap myself there?”
On the fifth day of zero Cas, Dean wakes up at 10:30 and finds Sam in the kitchen typing away on his laptop.
When he sits up he’s on a pristine white couch, the room’s dark though with minimal light coming from the dark hallways.
The sun had finally started to go down, making the air go still and the pavement sizzle even by looking at it. At least it seemed that most of the working folk had gotten home and the streets were as vacant as they were at 2 am.
“Damn some eager beavers you two are,” Dean comments mostly to himself before throwing his bag in the trunk. He slams it shut just as Sam says, “Crap. Forgot my phone. Hang on.”
“I know what you told me! But when you sound heartbroken on the phone because he left I can’t let that go.”
Claire and Kaia hugged them both, promising they would be absolutely responsible. And Dean was surprised that he trusted both of them to take care of the place.
Sam liked to pester him about it, seeing how happy Dean was for once in his life. He radiated this glow as Sam had said and Dean flipped him off. But genuinely Sam couldn’t be happier, for the both of them. That is until they would start kissing a little to heavily in public space and Sam would beeline it out of the room.
“Oh fuck” Jack muttered quietly “I’m so sorry. I totally forgot- I just. This wasn’t really planned- I didn’t know where to go” The tears continued to leak down his cheeks.
Dean pauses, “Wait he was texting me a few days ago— asking how to tell someone nicely that they’re being annoying…”
“But I didn’t cheat!” Dean yells, furiously. “You taught us the same formula that’s why it looks similar! And we both did well which means that it would look the same because we both got it right.”
Dean feels like a big jerk all of a sudden. All he's wanted is to have the courage to talk to Castiel and maybe get to know him cause the kid does look interesting and he does have a pretty face but Dean knows there’s so much more to that.
Carefully, Jack leans over Dean putting his right hand on his chest. Jack inhales slowly, then closes his eyes. Dean does the same.
Although, through his suffering Dean begins researching looking endlessly through books in the library. Trying to find a sure way to contact Cas that would guarantee him a response. He considered summoning a demon (which Sam talked him out of) for information. Then he thought he found a spell only for it to blow up in his face, literally. He even tries calling him, holding his breath through the rings hoping that maybe this time he’ll pick up. He doesn’t though.
“You sure Jack?” Cas questions “We don’t have to meet you there if you’re uncomfortable?” “Oh okay. Got it. We’ll be there soon. Hang in there,” then he pockets his phone.
This was not what Dean was expecting when he answered the phone. Jack usually calls or texts about movies, or candy or to complain about Cas but school?
But then Dean couldn’t get it out of his head for a while, that maybe it was time. Cas had caught him being weird for a week after that news and told him straight up “I don’t need a ring or a document to show how much I love you. If you want too then that is your choice but I don’t need anything, only you.”
Jacks half way up the sidewalk by the time Dean and Cas get the courage to leave the car. Meeting around the side to both walk up, following Jack.
Dean clicks his jaw, “It’s whatever. He talked to Jack apparently. Jack gave him a piece of his mind which I told him not to but still. It’s whatever. We’ll deal with it when Cas ever decides to show his face again.”
“I couldn’t have done it without you guys, and Sam. So thanks both of you, a lot. I’ll have to call Sam and tell him.”
Cas has been wearing more and more human clothes, something different every day and Dean still will never get used to it.
“My mojo still works,” Cas says out loud “But I’m not sure how I’m drunk off of such little beer and-” he runs a hand over his face, “and the facial hair.”
“Come on better get going if we want to save anyone,” Sam says as he begins the trek into the foliage.
Sam frowns at him, knowing that Dean is withholding information but he moves on, “Maybe he’s figuring that out. He might be up in Heaven getting checked over?”
That heat underneath Dean’s plaid shirt doesn’t disappear and his heart swells with the fact that he’s just speaking to the boy he’s had a crush on all year. But he takes a deep breath and walks to catch up with Castiel ready to make this night worth every minute.
They hadn’t taken any real breaks since the girls came to stay with them, even Christmas became too hectic with the bar and Cas’ studies and life in general. So they had mailed their gifts and faced timed on Christmas morning to at least see everyone’s reactions.
Dean hums in thought, trying to understand if that has a deeper meaning than it sounds, “At least I won’t be John Winchester” Dean snorts suddenly curious if Jack has beer in his fridge.
“I know. I know you both are. And honestly thank you for being there when I was at my lowest. But I think I needed this trip, me and him.”
“No, of course not. I think I knew that.” Castiel frowns. “Something just doesn't seem right. The way he talks about her…”
Later, as they all crowd around the table with party hats on and cheesy music playing in the background, Dean catches Castiel’s eye while pouring another glass of wine and they exchange a warm, secretive smile.
. What could go wrong? He has the most fucking insanely awesome house in the world, the most handsome fiancé he could want, and a job he's excelling at. Life is damn good. It's especially damn good tonight because the twins are with Jimmy in their shiny new bedroom in Jimmy’s shiny new house, which means Cas and Dean have had a real, official date night with the house all to themselves. They've cooked dinner together, laughed and grinned their way through games of Scrabble and Jenga, and now they're relaxing in the evening starlight and Dean thinks life doesn't get much better than this.
. Something he never thought he would do again. He's shared his worries with Dean already, his concerns about him screwing things up and ruining it all, and Dean had been so adamant that would never happen that it had sated Castiel’s fears at the time. But now a gnawing anxiety is eating away at him and he's struggling to keep it at bay. What if he does screw everything up? Sometimes, when he looks at Dean playing with the kids and laughing with such carefree joy, he feels an ugly knot of envy in his chest that he can't unpack. He should be overjoyed at the connection Dean shares with his children. He is. He was. But now sometimes he feels like he's being pushed aside, and his exhausted, rattled mind can't work out if that's actually happening or if it's a figment of his imagination. And if it isn't happening, if it is all in his head, what kind of partner and father does that make him?
“St. Barts. Wow. I’ll have to up my game soon, Dean, if this is how the Winchesters roll. And I thought our weekend in Dallas was something to write home about.”
And he’s gone, scampering off down the corridor with so much energy that his perfectly combed hair bounces in spite of the pomade slicking it back, and Dean can’t help but chuckle to himself as he lets himself into his suite. The boy is kind of sweet. A little bit like an irritating little brother. But still.
“We gotta go through there? There could be like scorpions and stuff,” Dean says quietly expressing his concerns.
“Go checkout upstairs alone. We’ll relax down here” Jack smiles. They nod before heading upstairs slowly. Coming to a bonus room that has a few instruments along the wall and a couch along the opposite wall. A window parallel with the front of the house offers some light.
So he turns quick on his heels and out of the backyard. He crosses the front lawn and grumbly finds his way to the sidewalk. Ready to walk home if he has too but he stops at Benny’s pickup first to take a breather. What the fuck. He couldn't believe Jo, that she mettled in Dean Winchester's love life and he knows it’s probably sickening to watch him be all gaga over some blue-eyed boy but the least she could do was wait till he figured out how to deal with this himself.
He took a cooler of ice to Ms. Johnson's bakery down the street and some bottles of water. He checked in with them to make sure they were surviving or making the best of what they had. She was very grateful for the check-in and Dean didn’t expect anything for his kind gesture. But she brought out a day-old apple pie and put it in a box for him. “No one’s coming in for a hot baked treat right now anyways sugar, you and your fellow enjoy it.”
He began to frantically stuff the key into the ignition, feeling the itch of the open road beg for him.
Jack couldn’t come home for the weekend, said he was covering for someone at work who was sick. Dean thought he was fine with it, that was until Friday night hit and he didn’t know what to do with himself.
Jack shakes his head “too late. It’s your home. Everything you need plus it’s only 20 minutes from the bar. Everything is moved out of your upstairs apartment. I thought Cas you could use it as an office? If that museum archiver position pans out then you’re gonna need a space?”
Dean’s was too busy being turned on by Cas’ words to really understand them. Ended up parking the Impala at the motel and immediately walking across the street to a bar. He drank himself silly before realizing that Cas was right.
Dean hums, unsure if he should say anything but the words come out anyway “You’re drinking light beer and I think you’re kinda drunk off it?”
Cas’s eyes are full of confusion as he stares at Dean and all Dean wants to do is hold him and explain himself.
Cas comes up behind Jack, putting his hand on his shoulder. He makes brief eye contact with Dean that says a lot and nothing all at once. “Let's head inside and talk.”
“Is that the movies with Dr. Evil?” Cas says. Dean must look surprised based on the glare Cas gives him.
“You’ve been out for about 5 hours. I think it had to do with taking the grace out of your body. You needed some rest that’s all” Cas says off to his side, he’s petting Dean’s hair and nothing has felt better.
“I took good care of her while you were gone. Promise. Not a scratch. Even cleaned her and got her waxed” Jack jumps to defensive mood.
He couldn’t say no to that and on his way back he genuinely considered not telling Cas he was given free pie today.
Dean huffs, “Alright fine. Let’s start basic, ask Sam in the car about how movies came to be. It’ll give him something to focus on, rather than reading out loud some old book.”
He looks around the park, noticing no movement anywhere. He lets in a large inhale. There’s something he hasn’t tried yet. It’s worked countless times before. And hell, maybe Cas will hear him but won’t respond and Dean won’t blame him. But he has to scratch that itch that’s been under his skin for days.
“Dads it’s fine” Jack cut in making both of them stop talking. “If he hadn’t called me and wanted to work things out, I wouldn’t have given him the time of day.”
“That’s awesome Jack. I’m happy for you” Dean smiled, taking a sip of his craft Califorian beer. It isn’t that bad considering some of the wack stuff he’d tasted before.
“Fucking hell Cas, you’ve been around us for how freakin’ long! Learn how to knock!” Dean curses, glaring at him from under baby’s hood. While Sam picks up the 100-year-old book he just dropped.
Dean’s sipping at a glass of rum in the library alone, when his phone vibrates against the wooden table.
“Hey boss?” a gruff voice called from behind him. Dean turned to see Ricardo his main chef holding out the bar’s telephone.
“Please stop apologizing! It’s not going to fix anything! We need to do something! We- maybe I should’ve gone when they asked me too. Maybe he needed help then? I don’t know why they wouldn’t have said that they had him… ugh fuck! I’m so angry and tired and I miss him and I hate seeing you such a mess without him. I’m so… over it all.”
“Did you and daddy get to cuddle this morning?!” Dean coo’s to the little one “Yeah, he’s a pretty good cuddler huh. He gives the best hugs too. When you’re older you’ll see how much better his hugs make you feel. It’s like magic.”
Dean removed his hand from Cas's and folded his arms in front of himself. Cas wrapped an arm around his mate's back and rested his empty hand on the Omega's hip.
now.” It was said in a near whisper, and if they hadn't been so close, Cas was sure he wouldn't have heard.
“This happen during Phase One?” the doctor asked Dean, ignoring the Alpha. This appointment was about the pregnant Omega, after all.
Sometime later, when both of them were clean, dry and pleasantly drowsy, they stepped back out of the flow. It shrank back to its normal size and faded back to its base color of crystal clear as the two stepped away from it. They paused when they spotted a new addition to the room. There was a cylinder in the floor, parallel to the food wall (which had been cleared of the uneaten food). It was about 3.5 feet in length and was just as white as the rest of the room. Glancing at each other, the two of them took a few steps forward to inspect the object, but stumbled slightly as the texture of the floor suddenly changed.
“Oh, I've already eaten dinner in mah office,” Benny informed as he took a seat next to Charlie on the opposite side of the circular table. “I just wanted to come and meet ya both before ya turned in for the night, an' I figured Charlie'd bring ya here to get somethin' to eat before showin' ya to yer unit. Turns out I was right.”
“Not now, Cas!” Dean snapped. He was beginning to regain control of his temper, but Cas's voice wasn't helping matters. He just wanted to be left alone.
They walked for a minute or two before turning left and into another section of the garage. There were some shelves on one side that were stocked with empty duffles and backpacks, MREs, and some spare toolboxes and other essentials. On the opposite wall were bright yellow, plastic hazmat suits of varying sizes hanging from hooks.
“Uhhh... Right.” Dean had finally gotten the tiered display between him and Stranger and felt a little better for it, but for some reason, he still didn't feel 100% safe. “Well, um, my name's Dean...” he announced, hoping that an introduction would ease some of the tension.
Hector's eyebrows rose in appreciation. “I'm impressed. You caught on to all of that pretty quickly. Hell,” Hector chuckled, “I didn't even tell you that last thing.”
Anyway, hope you enjoyed this chapter. Leave a comment to let me know what you thought. I love hearing from you guys!
Jack pauses before stepping around looking down at Dean “I’m not sure if this will hurt but I’ll try to be as gentle as I can.”
Dean’s whole body quakes with nerves, he breathes in sharply finally finding his legs moving across the room. He lifts his hand to grab at the sheet, shutting his eyes and taking in another deep breath before opening it.
Gabe swallowed his bite of food “Actually. A friend of mine, her parents are selling their establishment in San Fran. It was a restaurant but with some elbow grease I’m sure you could switch it up.”
Sam stands, holding his closed laptop under his arm, “I’m gonna shower and pack. When do you wanna leave?”
They say nothing as they descend the stairs, both automatically walking back to the forest they had landed in. But as they come up to the edge of a mass of trees Dean says, “You think you could mojo us to bunker for a rest? Then zap us back to Sam in a few hours?”
and there he’d be missing. Dean and Cas would stick around the bunker, then when he got back they’d go on a hunt.
All three of them sighed before Sam cleared his throat, “So if that’s what’s new on the Jack front. What about you guys? Feels like years since the three of us have sat down.”
“Cas?” Dean tries. He wants to have hope that Cas came, he came to rescue them, to come home with him. It’s like a bad prank but god Dean would take anything for Cas to come home right now.
He froze. Wasn’t expecting that to come from Sam’s mouth so quickly but his tone was certain. He had put a lot of thought into it.
“Monsters are real. You, Sam and Castiel were hunters. Same with Jody. Claire and Kaia still hunt. Actually they should be around town in the next few weeks. Oh and Castiel was an Angel and Jack was a Nepilim. Half Angel, Half human.” Gabe says smoothly.
“Everyone knows Dean, the way you make googly eyes at him, always become this macho man when he walks by you’ve been dying to talk to him I can see it in Maths and last semester in History and I just have a feeling that he may like you too.”
Cas sighs, looking down at the floor before gaining the courage to speak “... Jack’s out there, making friends, applying for jobs, going to college. He’s young and so full of life. He’s about to experience so much good of humanity because he’s out of this mess” He gestures to the three of them “And sometimes, I get jealous of that. Cause yeah Jack has powers but he’s also part human. So once he’s out there he gets to make mistakes, to learn from them, gets to feel emotion, and body sensations. And maybe one day, he’ll love someone, he’ll get a real job, he’ll get a house, he’ll retire, he’ll have grandkids. He’ll live a full life going through some of humanity's greatest obstacles and greatest adventures, all in a different way than I’ll ever get to.” Cas sighs sounding defeated, “The human part of himself is thriving and sometimes I wish I still had apart of that in me.”
But then again. Cas was at the museum, probably running off his feet to make sure artifacts and documents were staying preserved in their temperature-controlled environments. It was all hands on deck today according to their brief texts around lunchtime. They also were letting the main foyer be a cool-down space for anyone who needed it.
Dean lets out a long sigh, trying to figure out a way to break Cas out of his dream. He squeezes Cas’s hand with both of his wrapped around it. Hoping, praying that Cas will feel him being there.
“Is this your new bedroom?” Cas asks curiously. Dean now notices that the guy isn’t in his usual trenchcoat and suit get up. Dean pauses, realizing that he hasn’t seen Cas in anything else since Cas was a human.
“You’re not John Winchester. You’re not John Winchester” he repeated to himself. Hoping that one of the sentences would sound like Cas. A phrase his husband had said to him long ago but Dean retained in order to keep himself grounded.
Jack hums, “Uh couple weeks. But I told him not to tell you guys- Cas it’s probably in Sebastian's truck did you ask him?”
“Cas” he chokes out. He whips around, shining the light in every corner but there’s nothing except wet walls.
“We may have had a moment and he said he couldn’t do this. Us. He stuck around for a bit after that, we ignored what had happened. He was acting a little strange… I think he was drunk. But he took off. Like he always does.”
With a minute left in the last quarter, they’re down by just a few points. This touchdown could get them another win which they need to make playoffs.
Jack grabs at Dean’s hand and puts the keys there “It is your forever home. Come on, I wanna show you the inside. You’ll both love it.”
Sam collects his big brother into a tight embrace. And it’s like everything comes tumbling back in ten folds. That he’s been masking his hurt for days because it’s what he’s supposed to do, but he can’t do it anymore, he only wants Cas back. For them to talk it out, to come to some solution because as time has told them again and again, they’re it for each other. There’s no way to separate them and even if they have to stay platonic, Dean’s okay with that cause at least he has Cas back.
There’s a warm glow from the crack of the door that leads into the nursey. Dean is careful in pushing the door to open, only slowly peeking around the corner.  When this routine started to take place a few weeks ago, Dean had gotten up to check on the other two. He had barged into the nursey, scaring Cas enough to let out a physical yelp. Thus ensuing a shrill of screaming cries from a three month old Grace. Dean’s not shy to loud noises like in movies, or music in the garage but the set of pipes on their kid is enough to kill someone.
“That's what I told her. She said it wasn’t enough, that my debt has not been repaid in full. I still refused, told her to figure it out on her own. But then she said it.”
Dean can’t control the tears leaking from his eyes, but Cas wipes them away, “I’m here. No need for tears.”
Eventually, Cas looks up at Dean, “I- I don’t know how to explain it, Dean. I felt… like... I needed space okay? I was feeling overwhelmed and I didn’t want to get into an argument with you over all this.”
“No! NO!” Naomi screams “I refuse to do this bargaining anymore!” She sounds nothing like her usual kept together self. “I promise you- no I swear to you, on my Father's life that this is the LAST you will hear from me— from any Angel. I CANNOT let Heaven die. This is our home and this home is the protection to everyone who deserves to be at peace.”
Dean likes Jo, she's the ultimate package. Pretty and sweet but also has this snarky side to her that makes her unbearable sometimes. She can wit her way through any situation and yet get that person to be best friends with her. She is the captain of the cheer team but also plays a mean beer pong, loves to party and entertain, and gets away with pretty much everything. Dean could not love her more.
Sam tries his best to get Dean out of his destructive behavior by finding new cases for them to go on. But every time he would find one, Dean would make up some lame excuse for Sam to go without him.
Dean pulls his phone from his face and taps the speaker button on the screen. He glances at Cas concerned, well Cas is also sporting a confused look.
Dean feels frozen especially with two sets of eyes on him but he’s trying to process all of this. Cas wants to be human? Or included in some parts of it? And he wants a job? A house? Someone, to share that with? He wants to forget heaven and hell and monsters, something Dean’s been internally craving for years but could never gain the courage to do. But Cas… Cas wants that?
“You’ve had this… glow inside you. The first time I saw it, was a couple of months ago. I thought it was apart of your soul but... it’s different. I couldn’t place it but based on my findings...”
“I know it’s easiest to think the worse, hell if he was dead at least I’d fucking know where he is but he’s not. I know.”
Dean cannot believe what he is hearing right now, the words all make sense and ring in his ears but he’s for real for real tied to Cas. “Um…” Sam clears his throat while smirking at Dean. Dean feels his cheeks flush “We-uh. We uh kissed. Finally.”
Dean was up and out of his chair quickly but not without reassuring the little ones “It’s just Jack. This is his house too remember.”
It’s a mix of both of them. Dean can even see a photo of baby hanging on the wall by the master bathroom. Jack is officially the best son.
“Maybe if you two could take your heads out of your asses and communicate, then things might be different.”
Dean feels so lost about how Cas is processing any of this. If they can’t because Dean is a male or because Dean is a human or worse because Cas just doesn’t want him. Dean’s not sure if he’ll ever know. 'Cause Cas is clearly okay with sex, he had sex with a reaper once. But that was so long ago, they haven't even talked about that since it happened. Dean’s not even sure what he’s thinking even more. His thoughts constantly turning to contradict the next.
Cas continues to laugh at the movie, snorts, and hiccups escape his mouth. Dean daringly turns his head to look at Cas, beer in hand wearing jeans and a t-shirt, hair not brushed, a little scruff on his cheeks, he even looks tired?
Dean chuckles “Fair enough” he pauses, letting the room ease around them “I called Sam, let him know about Cas. He said he’ll head back first thing tomorrow morning.”
Dean stood quietly, padding over to stand over Cas’s shoulder and look at their daughter, “She’s pretty remarkable huh” Dean whispered.
“But being scared doesn’t make me or you weak. It makes us aware, to gain more control, and eventually, stronger. I don’t have to accomplish or be good at what I’m afraid of, I just have to do it and try my best. That’s all anyone could ask for.”
But when they’re in a small town on the New York - Pennsylvania border, things seemed to be much odder.
“Cas said you guys have slowed down a bit since um… Mary” He says her name like he isn’t supposed to.
The bunker is the safest place for him with it being heavily warded against everything. Dean shouldn’t be so frantic but he can’t help it.
Jack stood from the couch, smiling down at both of them “You both are great parents. You would make some other kid, if it’s your own or adopted— the happiest kid out there. So think about it?”
Cas is quick in pulling their mouths together, only breaking apart when their daughter coo’s between them.
Cas pipes up to continue, “Um, but there is another reason that I’m here. I think I found a case. Four bodies of investors for a museum have shown up dead in the last two weeks. Sounds like a vengeful spirit.”
Jack lets out a snicker, “Alright, I’ll phone him. Uh, thanks again, guys. I’ll talk to you both soon.” “Bye Jack,” Both Dean and Cas say at the same time before Dean hangs up. Cas lets out a large exhale, “What a relief. I’m so glad he got in.”
The house is quiet and still, and Castiel immediately feels guilty just being there. He calls Dean’s name quietly, closing the door behind him, but gets no reply. The living room is devoid of life, as is the kitchen. He tries one bedroom, which looks to be a guest room, then another. Then the bedroom that must be the master, with the door to the en suite open.
Blocking out Dean’s slightly wild detractions as Jo continues to needle him, he checks out the cop again over his brother’s shoulder. The guy is smiling demurely at a girl who is posing next to him, holding up her phone for a selfie, before encouraging her back onto the sidewalk and safely behind a barrier as another truck passes by. The roads have been opened again for a few hours and cars are starting to drive past, weaving their way between rainbow flags and placards and people taking photos and dancing and embracing. The cop says something into his radio, then turns to look over his shoulder as though he senses someone’s eyes on him and Sam looks away quickly. Damn aviators, he can’t tell if his snooping was observed or not. He needs to invest in some of his own.
“Because Dean isn't Cole.” Sometimes Jimmy really wants to slap his brother. For all his intellect, he can be incredibly obtuse on occasion. “Dean loves you, all of you. It's obvious, from the way he looks at you to your track record. You've been through some shit together already, Cas. That counts for something.”
,” Sam hears her say, and looks back at the ship himself for clarification. In his opinion, it certainly does. He had never sailed on the RMS
Now, lying in bed surrounded by the warmth and familiarity of their own home, Castiel runs fingers through Dean’s hair, leaning over to check the time on his phone.
Meg had consoled Gabriel through her own shocked tears, while Dean tried to help the firefighters clear out the remains of the mess and salvage what he could - which wasn't much. They had closed the place down, and six weeks later after all three of them worked twelve hour days alongside a team of workmen, they reopened with a new name, a new logo, and a new layout.
“No time like the present!” She smiles at him. “Just gran someone if you need a hand with any of the machines. And have fun!”
“You’re corny as hell, Cas.” Dean laughs, allowing himself to be backed up against the countertop and lifted up onto it, leaning back and allowing Castiel’s kisses to trail from his jawline down his neck, then his t-shirt is being tugged down so his clavicle can receive the same treatment. “Cas, we can’t. My family will be here soon. Mmmm, but that feels so good…”
As she says it, she leans against the doorframe and folds her arms - a clear gesture that she doesn’t want him to come in at all. He glances at the sleek black Impala in the driveway.
Standing in the hallway beside the table where Dean has left his cell, she drops it onto the tiled floor where the screen shatters instantly and the phone goes dark. Then, for good measure, she grinds the spiky heel of her shoe into the broken pieces.
is that I’m still standing here listening to your shit,” he says icily. She actually glances away from her phone for that - hallelujah - but he’s done. He is so fucking done. Feeling like he can’t even look at her anymore, he storms past her, wincing when he accidentally bumps against her shoulder and then doubling his pace when he hears the clicking of her heels following after him.
, Dean, that you're so lazy you can't earn enough to look after this family.” She's hissing at him like a snake, all venom and ice and he can't move away. The knot in his chest is building, tightening, threatening to choke him. His back hits the counter and he realises she's shoved him, crowding him, unfinished. “All you do is work at that crappy garage. No wonder we never have any money. What kind of career is that for a man? What kind of
“It looks like they'll just sell tickets to anyone these days, doesn’t it?” Amara says, her eyes raking coldly over Meg. They both wear red, but look starkly different. Dean can't help but think that Meg looks much more comfortable in her own skin, confident in a way that doesn't appear arrogant or self-involved. The polar opposite to Amara. “But I suppose it would be silly for a charity to refuse donations, no matter where they come from.”
Cas trails off again and a tremor shudders through him - and in an instant, Dean knows. He doesn’t know
So he winds up in the one place he hates the most and has to grit his teeth throughout the entire experience. He leaves with every cut and graze cleaned thoroughly and a few stitches to the one in his arm, stitches that the doctor tells him will dissolve naturally. He barely says a word. All he could think was that Castiel’s hands had felt so much more comforting when they wiped the blood from his skin and pulled shards of broken glass from his flesh with tweezers. With Castiel, it almost hadn't hurt. The doctor was proficient, quick, and British, and there was a look in his blue eyes and a tone to his voice that made Dean feel like they knew each other. But he lay silently on the bed as instructed, gazing at a point in the distance while Amara held his hand, and the doctor left without much further ado.
Wednesday afternoon finds Sam slumped over his desk, sweating buckets thanks to broken air-con and a despairingly inept handyman, with his cell phone in his hand and a grim frown between his eyebrows. His hair is sticking unpleasantly to his forehead and whenever he brushes it back it just sticks to the nape of his neck instead. Maybe Dean’s onto something when he tells him to get it trimmed. He works for an hour longer then gives in to the heat, telling his assistant he’s going to finish up the day at home. He works in the city and it’s a short train ride home, one made even more uncomfortable by the heat and the number of people who have also apparently given up on work for the day. He holds onto the strap above his head, body swaying with the movement of the train and tries to read a page or two on his Kindle app but he’s too distracted by thoughts of Dean. He manages to snag a seat when a lady with her children gets off, and before he knows if he’s almost home. He should call Dean when he gets back, maybe try and grab dinner together.
When he'd gotten home, she had been out of the door and down the path before Dean’s taxi had even pulled away from the curb. She'd stopped with a hand over her mouth then pulled him slowly inside, taking in the cuts on Dean’s forehead, his cheek, the blood that had seeped through Castiel’s soft t-shirt. He hadn't been able to put his own back on, it was too stained with blood and it would have freaked out the cab driver. She has collapsed into his arms when they'd got inside, sobbing and holding him and crying that she was sorry, so
“Go to your room,” Cas commands, his voice thick with definite emotion, and for one bizarre second Dean thinks Cas is talking to him. “And don't come out until I come get you.”
“Well, either way,” Castiel wraps an arm around his waist and pulls him close. “I wanna shower with you. Even if that’s all we do. Please?”
, then out at the glorious summer’s day and the sun reflecting off the water. It must be a hundred degrees out; everyone is in shorts, tees, or dresses, yet inside the bakery the atmosphere is surprisingly festive. He's not sure if he's the one losing his marbles, or if it's his boss, Gabriel, who is currently in the kitchen rolling out another sheet of cookie dough to cut into reindeer shapes. Earlier, it had been Christmas trees. Later, it will probably be holly bushes or candy canes, and by then Dean may very well have strangled him with the first thing he gets his hands on. Some goddamn fairy lights, probably.
“Oh, nobody.” She sips her wine, enjoying the warmth of the evening sunlight on her skin. “Someone trying to sell their valeting services.”
“You've been working so hard, baby. Why don't you go back to bed, and I'll take the kids to the library in town?” More neck kisses and Cas melts into him. “Try and get some shut-eye. You look kinda dead on your feet.”
He takes the kids up to their room while Cas talks to Jimmy. The twins love their bedroom here: it's spacious with lights strung across the window ledge, the walls a pale grey with hand-painted elephants making their way across one wall (turns out Jimmy is something of an artist) and the beds are comfy with soft blankets and stuffed animals already waiting for them. Lexie runs across the room and jumps onto the bed, already reaching for the fluffy owl Jimmy bought him and waggling its wings, chatting happily to himself. Billie doesn't move, just scuffs his toe on the painted wood floor and looks at his feet.
Irrationally irritated, both by Sam’s peculiar behaviour with Ruby and at the strange conversation with this unwelcome stranger, Dean turns his back and heads for the door on the opposite side of the room. All around him, men are standing in small clusters, laughing and conversing and visibly revelling in their own successes. They all clutch crystal glasses filled with whisky, brandy, Scotch, gin, anything strong and alcoholic, and Dean’s skin itches with the desire to have just one more as a nightcap. Perhaps he can have something sent to his cabin. No, he corrects himself, his
And it's true: the account is in joint names. It ties him to the wildly increasing debt and he fights back a wave of panic at how it could affect the garage if it can't be paid off. Which, right now, it can't be.
“I don’t doubt that. And the ‘fun’ element is what makes me think Cassie would be the worst guest you could hope for. He doesn’t exactly do ‘fun’, at least not in the traditional sense. His version of fun is watching beekeeping documentaries on NatGeo.” Gabriel shrugs in a ‘what can you do’ gesture and Dean’s brow furrows.
But he can’t move. He’s frozen in place, waiting to be yelled at or pushed off the property or, worse, for the cops to be called. But so far, Castiel has shown no signs of doing anything like that. In fact, as Dean peeks up at him through his lashes, his face seems to have softened and he looks almost… sad. Why sad? Has Dean upset him so much? A knot forms in his chest and clenches tightly. He never wanted this,
Her nails rake lightly down his back and he flinches as they graze a scratch from the other night. They'd got carried away in bed and she'd drawn blood. She presses another kiss to the nape of his neck then steps away.
head to the gym more often, she thinks, taking in the slight softness at his hips. The worst of the cuts on his face and hands are healing well now, and shouldn’t scar too badly. She hopes not, anyway. She doesn’t want to be on the arm of someone with noticeable scarring which people would stare and wonder at.
“Yeah, well, you know me. I like a bit of drama here and there.” He wraps an arm around Cas’ neck and draws him close to kiss his forehead. “I just wish I hadn’t been such an ass about it, and that you hadn’t had to go through all this shit alone. I’m sorry. You shouldn’t have been alone.”
He can’t wait for them to arrive in New York. No, that isn’t accurate. He can’t wait to leave New York, to head back to Kansas to the place he calls home. It’s been too long, way too long, and he misses the familiarity of the streets he grew up on, the buildings he knows by heart, the voices and the faces of the people who he’s seen almost daily since he was a child. He misses Ellen and Joanna. He misses the dirt beneath his boots and the warm air in his lungs, the wind pushing through his hair and the dry heat chapping his lips during the summer. He misses the wide roads, the sprawling farms, the cattle trails. He wants to go home.
“Dean!” Castiel’s voice snaps sharp down the phone and Dean manages to focus. It sounds like Castiel had been saying his name a couple of times already. “Are you alright?”
“Probably to some people in this room. Not to me. Once you scratch the surface, most people are just the same. Rich, poor, it doesn’t matter much. We’re all just trying to survive in the lives we’ve been given.”
He gets up to pour himself another glass of mulled wine, takes a mulled cider as well because it would be rude not to, and returns to his movie. He has a soft-spot for what Sam calls ‘chick-flicks’ and if left alone long enough will binge on them to his heart’s content.
They sit there for a long time, until eventually Amara stirs and pulls him to his feet, walking them both back to bed. She falls asleep immediately, curled in his arms, and he lies awake for the rest of the night watching the red liquid numbers on his alarm clock shift from one to the next.
On reflection, it seems foolish to miss a meal. Is it his imagination, or do his pants already feel a little loose? Damn European food. He would love to sit down to a burger with Ellen right about now.
He lies back, holding the note to his chest, a million thoughts spiralling through his mind as he tries to imagine where Dean is right now. Wherever that is, Castiel just hopes he's safe.
“I don't think you can, kiddo,” Cas sighed. His hand had stroked shiny dark hair back from Billie’s forehead before he kissed his temple. “I think it might be broken.”
There's a self-deprecating note in her voice, something woeful and forlorn, and Dean knows it well. He turns and appraises her, smiling warmly.
In that moment, as Dean realises where he’s to be sitting, he regrets being late for dinner. But he risks being incredibly rude if he turns and walks away now, so he plasters a brittle smile onto his face and sits down where the waiter directs him, unfurling his napkin and spreading it on one knee. His glass is filled almost instantly with gently bubbling champagne and he drinks half of it in one gulp before remembering where he is.
“Neither was I. But Amara wouldn't let me hear the end of it if I didn't. She thought I was joking when I said I’d rather stay in and watch reruns of Dr. Sexy.”
“His white count is up,” Dr. Bradbury had said, her eyes wide and a tentative smile touching his lips. “And his temperature is down half a degree. It’s… unbelievable progress, but progress nonetheless. We’ll continue to monitor him every hour.”
“He is. My apologies,” Sam had held out a hand towards Jack who had instantly pressed his billfold into it. “Will this cover any inconvenience?”
Cas pauses before hitting send. He doesn't want Jimmy to worry; he's perfectly fine and just going through a weird phase. He's always been prone to nightmares, or night terrors as his parents used to call them, so this is nothing new. He just hasn't suffered with them in a long time. Since right after Cole’s death. In the months that followed he had been like some macabre animated corpse: pale and thin and plagued by horrific nightly visions of his husband lying dead before him, of his children crying, and himself collapsing to his knees with his baby boy in his arms unable to look away from the scene before him. It had been the worst period of his life, and the fear of ever feeling that way again is causing him more stress than he dare admit. He can't pinpoint where it's all come from lately, but the worry of what could happen in the future and the ‘what if’s that slink in whenever he's alone and his mind wanders. Sipping his mint tea he shakes his head dully, trying to come back to himself, and erases the word he's typed.
“1305. It’s the end unit,” Cas says pointing down the hall, starting to take off that way. But Dean puts his hand on his shoulder to stop him.“Hey, Cas wait.”
“It’s from Grease. This movie that came out in the ’70s. It’s a classic, it happened to be on TV countless times when me and Sam were bouncing around with Dad. The songs get stuck in your head, the plot is easy to follow and it’s got friggin’ John Travolta like come on man. It’s worth your time to watch.”
Dean whipped his head to look at Cas who did the same. Both of their eyes searching for an answer from the other.
Cas frowns, his lip quivering like he’s going to start crying “Dean I” Cas starts “I want... to forget Heaven. I want to die one day, but I want it to be with you and I can’t do that if I’m still an-” he pauses.
“Yeah” Jack replies sounded defeated. The same way Dean does. “We’ll talk soon alright? Go study then maybe go for a walk okay?” “Yeah” he sighs again “Sounds good.”
“See if you were human we would’ve had to let the paint dry overnight and move everything from the garage here one by one. It would've been exhausting.”
“Me and Gabe got into a fight. He probably has to move to Seattle, I didn’t take that well. I think we broke up” More tears fell while Dean could feel his own heart shattered for the kid.
“She’s such a know-it-all I hate that she talked to you like that” Dean grumbles as he stands racing to find the keys for Jack’s cuffs.
“Dean I-” Cas then coughs, it’s terrifying. His whole body shakes, looking like he's one breath away from shattering into millions of pieces. Dean tries to frantically do something but only ends up petting at Cas’s arm in comfort. “Dean I’m-” Cas starts again but then the door Dean had walked through is busted down by Sam getting thrown through it.
“Oh?” This peaked Dean’s interest “Why would they say that?” “So we could have a cousin to play with!” Sadie exclaimed.
She hands them both beers and pops the lids off with an opener and tells them to drink up before leaving. Dean momentarily checks her out and Benny gives him a look, “Really? Jo?”
So much has happened while Dean’s been blindsided by the fear of something continuously coming after them. That there was always a bigger threat on its way, but in the last few weeks they’ve stepped back and it’s given Dean time to think.
“Oh my god, Dean!” Cas’ voice booms well Sam’s cackling echoes throughout the room. Dean hesitates on getting up for a second, feeling like maybe he should fake falling asleep or something. But decides against it and grumpily gets up, sitting back in his seat.
Cas is careful in tucking the baby blanky over the little girl and Dean’s shoulder as Dean finds himself settle in the rocking chair.
“Thanks for coming guys. Really. It means a lot,” Jack says. Cas looks at him, “Hey anytime. You say the word, we’re here.”
Dean pauses, “You can talk about her Jack. It’s okay. But yeah kind of, we’re still picking up some small cases but there are younger hunters out there now. Gotta pass the torch sometime.”
Dean lays back in his bed, staring at nothing. His room is pitch black with the light off and all he can see is Cas’s vibrant eyes staring into his own. It felt so real, but Dean knows it’s only stress manifesting what he aches for. He doesn’t fall back asleep, just lays there in silence till his alarm blares.
Naomi stops in front of Jack “Heaven on its own is dying. We need grace to keep us afloat, but with having newer Angels our power is still faltering. We need old grace to keep our home alive. Otherwise, we’d have lost souls with no direction to go in and there’s no way Hell wouldn’t find a way to put them into their pit of torture.”
And yet, still Dean will find him up at 2am without waking Dean to take care of their kid. It still annoys Dean most times that Cas just won’t let himself, let others help him. It’s been a on-going thing for years. As long as Dean has known Cas, its been the root of their problems and to this day it keeps haunting them.
Dean literally didn’t breath the whole rescue mission. It took some careful planning and risky moves to lure the vampires out of their den. Sam almost breaking his leg running in the woods as Dean was in the middle of untying Cas from a chair. He was unconscious, they had fed on him and Dean felt sick to his stomach.
“I don’t want to make this about me, but I wish I could tell him something comforting from experience but I have nothing.”
“Oh, Cas I’m so sorry. I’m- I’m so sorry for being so angry with you, I- I should’ve looked for you I should’ve tried harder. I didn’t know- I thought… you hated me. That I was disgusting and selfish for…” He pauses “For loving you…” he gulps, finally he said it “I should’ve said something, we should’ve talked. But you know I’m not good with all that. Especially to you— god Cas.”
