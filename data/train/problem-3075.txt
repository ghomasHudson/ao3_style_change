Thrusting hard and deep Castiel wrapped his arm around Dean's chest once again pulling him up into him. "Say my name" Castiel whispered into his ear
"C'mon Cas, you can to better than that. Fuck me hard! Smack my ass." Dean pleaded.
"Sam, you are not in love with Cas. What are you even talking about? You're straight, you've never even looked sideways at a man before, let alone Cas!" Dean exasperated, he closed his laptop, not needing the distraction of it right now. He was going to get to the bottom of this confession. There was no way that Sam had fallen for Cas, he just couldn't. Sure, he thought, Cas was an attractive man, and Sam was right, he was a good, if not sometimes misguided, person... uh... Angel. And it wasn't like Cas was unlovable... he was very lovable. he just wasn't Sam's kind of lovable, at least not THAT way.
Castiel leaned forward and wrapped and arm around Dean's chest, pulling him into his own chest "Say my name" he whispered into his ear.
"What do you mean what happened? What happened when?" she asks, her voice becoming more clear as she woke up.
"that, Dean. Is what I feel when you touch me like that."
He shook his head, pushing away the memory of those first few nights after he left the bunker. He stripped his cloths off and walked to the shower, turning it on as hot as he could stand it. This was something that he did enjoy about being human, showers. He loved the way the water felt running over his body, how his muscles would relax under the pulsing warmth. He grabbed the wash cloth and soap, and began washing his body. As he ran the washcloth over his skin he started to think of Dean in the shower, only minutes ago, doing the same thing.
Cas just wants Dean to fuck him, but thats not what he gets.
How Dean sank to his knees before him, lifting his leg over his shoulder before sucking his cock into his mouth, taking him down in one swallow. Leaving Cas so lost in his desire that he had to grab Dean by the hair just to be sure he didn't fall over. How Dean's dirty little mouth was able to make him feel so much pleasure that he was left speechless above him, moaning incoherently. Dean pulling him out of his mouth, licking lower until his tongue runs over Cas' sensitive opening, teasing only briefly before pushing a long digit into him making Cas gasp, tightening his fingers in Dean's hair. Dean stretching and opening him up until he  begged Dean to "fuck me". How Dean looked at him with burning passion as he stood up, slamming their mouths together with a growl. Fingers digging deep into his ass as he rolls their hips together, Cas' sensitive cock rubbing against the course denim of Dean's jeans. "Dean" he moaned into his mouth and Dean pulled back eyes wild with lust, just before...
Dean wondered how in the world he had let Charlie convince him that he needed to be here. It was Meg's birthday, and while he had been extended an invitation, he knew it was simply a social nicety, he wasn't really wanted here. That fact was glaringly obvious as he sat alone at the bar with a glass of whiskey in his hand.
"Damn baby, if you arent the most beautiful creature in the world. I love seeing you like this." Dean licked his lips. "Cas, baby look at me." Cas' eyes met his, and Dean could see how close he was. " I want you to watch me as I suck you. Ok baby... I'm gonna make you feel so good." Dean took Cas' full length into his mouth until he could feel the tip at the back of his throat, only when he heard Cas moan did he pull back up, hollowing his cheeks and swirling his tongue over the tip before taking him in again. He only managed to do so three times before he felt Cas' hips buck up into him, buring his cock in his throat as the salty warm liquid shot down his throat, Dean swallowed hard around Cas' cock, holding him there until his body fell back onto the bed. Using his mouth he cleaned Cas up, before inching his was back up his body to claim Cas' mouth in a sweet kiss.
The other events that had occurred that night, were not brought up by either of them. Though Dean had noticed on more than one occasion subtle changes in Cas' behavior toward him. Oh, there had always been the lingering looks, and the invasion of personal space, what was new was the touching. Cas had been taking every opportunity to touch Dean. It was always subtle, and in no way overtly sexual, but it was happening more often and every time it did, Dean felt an immense warmth wash over him. He tried to show Cas he was open to whatever he may want, but he wasn't sure how to do that without taking charge. Dean had always been the take charge kind of guy when it came to relationships, but he didnt want that with Cas. He was certain that Cas wanted to take their relationship to another level, but he had long decided, that Cas would have to be the one to do that.
I want to say thank you for being such a creep, for it has allotted me the opportunity to take your gorgeous date home. hope you enjoyed your evening, I know I'll be enjoying the rest of mine!
Castiel sat up as much as he could with Dean's fingers still in his ass and took Dean's face in his hands pulling him forward and kissing him sweetly. "No gag reflex" he winked "Over there" he nodded toward the door "Is a condom and extra lube. I need you in me now" he kissed him again before pushing him back, whimpering at the sudden loss of Dean's fingers.
WHAT HAPPENS in those missing hours?
Dean's expression is one of surprise, his eyes are wide, and his mouth gapes a little after Cas pulls away. Cas hears a small huff escape him before he clears his throat. "uh, Cas?" Dean asks slowly "What exactly was that?" His voice is surprisingly calm.
Dean decides he simply cannot take any more of the slow torture. He sits up, pulling away from Cas as he grabs the fallen angel and pulls him up onto the bed laying him flat. Dean kisses him hard before trailing his lips down Cas' body. He swirls his tongue around Cas' delicious cock getting him nice and wet before positioning himself on top of him once again. He looks into Cas' eyes as he slowly lowers himself down onto Cas' dick. He moves slow, adjusting to the intrusion, and is soon sitting flush with Cas' hips. He lets go of the breath he was holding with a low moan. "mmm... feels better than I ever dreamed Cas" he says leaning forward taking the fallen angels lips with his as he starts to slowly rock his hips into him. Cas slides his tongue into his mouth as he runs his hands over Dean's thighs up to his hips holding tight as Dean's pace started to pick up. He let out a low moan into his mouth as Dean lifts up and slammed back down.
Dean stood frozen as he took in the sight of Cas, he swallows again before finding his voice, finally speaking "You're a fucking vision Cas"
"And this?" He asks pulling out the black blindfold.
Cas inched up the bed until their knees met. Dean reached out with one of the ear buds and placed it in Cas' right ear, making sure it was in place. His hand lingering on the side of Cas' face, probably a little longer than was completely necessary. Dean pulled the other bud up to his ear, but the cord was shorter than he thought and he had to lean in a little in order for it to reach. Cas mimicked his movement and their foreheads were less than six inches apart. Dean looked up at Cas, catching his soft gaze, a smile playing at his lips. "Are you ready to listen to some amazing music Cas?"
"Dean?" Cas manages to ask. Dean looks at him, confusion followed by a looks of horror and humiliation crosses his face as he hops off the bed and moves across the room. "Cas, I.... I'm sorry man, I thought it was another dream. God, this is embrarrassing" Dean says, covering his face, his entire body flushing red.
Dean ran his hand over Castiel's chest and to his stomach. "What do you say we jump in the shower and get cleaned up?"
"Um, why?"
"If I'm in it, it's mine. I'm the expert remember?" he said with a wink "Now, go"
Dean's expression is one of surprise, his eyes are wide, and his mouth gapes a little after Cas pulls away. Cas hears a small huff escape him before he clears his throat. "uh, Cas?" Dean asks slowly "What exactly was that?" His voice is surprisingly calm.
Not knowing what to do with his hands Cas runs them through his own hair, back arching off the bed as Dean brings him closer to orgasm. The heat pooling in his stomach and he holds onto it, not wanting this to ever stop. Dean leans forward, hips studdering in their slow but hard thrusts. "Let go baby, I've got you.... Come with me" Dean says softly in his ear.
"Y---YES!" Cas gasps, wrapping his leg around deans thigh and rutting up against him.
"Actually" Dean said, grabbing his phone "I think it's time for the cookies to come out of the oven. Why don't you take the expert out in the kitchen and see what he thinks."
Cas stepped a little closer and simply said one word, "Us"
"How can you be sure he's into you?"
Castiel found himself looking forward to spending Sunday afternoons with little Dean Winchester, he was a good kid. And even though pie wasn't his favorite dessert to make, he found he didnt mind so much because it made Dean happy.
"But Dean... I don't under..." Dean cuts him off with another kiss as he turns Cas around so he's under the flow of water. "Oh..." Cas gasps, caught off guard as his body first tenses, then relaxes under the warmth of the spray.
Castiel stood up, his hand slapping Dean's bare ass once, before he slowly pushed his dick into his wet ready hole. They both moaned as the tip of his cock pushed in. Cas paused a moment, but when Dean rotated his hips, he slipped the rest of the way in, and again they moaned together. Dean was lost in the sensation of Castiel filling him up, thrusting slowly.
'I won't be making it to lunch, but I've sent someone in my place. Never would I stand between you and your destiny. I love you, call me later'
Dean smiles again, running his lips over Cas' jaw to his lips kissing him deeply as his fingers continue to play with his nipples. Dean pulls back, leaving them both gasping as he kisses his way down Cas' neck to his collar bone, teeth scraping over the skin. He places wet open mouth kisses down his chest, finally leaving his nipples alone. He grips Cas' hips as he slowly runs his tongue over Cas' leaking cock head, which is peaking out the top of the lacy panties. "mmmmmm.... you taste so good baby." he says before wrapping his lips around just the tip, tongue flicking at the slit.
Dean returned the smile "There's a t-shirt and some sweatpants laying on my bed if you wanted to change."
"Hmmm? " Castiel moaned, "No Dean, you are the amazing one" he leaned forward and kissed him.
There lips were barely separated when Cas grabbed the back of Dean's head with one hand, pulling him back into his mouth, as the other wrapped around his waist, pulling their bodies together. Cas' tongue aggressively pushed it's way into Dean's mouth, and he swore he actually saw sparks as his warm tongue touched his for the first time. There was no hesitation as Dean let Cas take control of the kiss. 'God, I'm such a girl' he thought as he moaned into Castiel's mouth, his own arms wrapping around Cas.
Dean sauters off to the bathroom slowly, heat building in him again at the thought of Cas watching his ass as he walks away. He could have never thought he'd be able to feel this way so openly. This was so much more than just sex, though that was definitely awesome. He never wanted this night to end, he wanted to just stay here with Cas forever, never have to go back to the horrors of their day to day life. But he supposed, now that Cas was here, and they were together, it would make the life they led seem not so bad.
"Y.. yes Dean... I... mmmm.... I understand." Cas stammers out. "Pl... please ... dont stop..." His hips rotate in Dean's arms and Dean gives him a smile before lowering his head once again.
"It's good to see you. Meg told me she had hired you to run this place for her. She made a good choice" Castiel says with a side smile as he looked dead into his eyes.
Castiel spent the morning tidying up the house and then the afternoon preparing an apple (of course he remembered) pie for Dean, all the while thinking fondly on the time he had spent with the Winchesters as neighbors. And all the times Dean would come over and help him around the house in order to get his pie. Sweet adorable little Dean Winchester, only Castiel guessed that he probably wasn't little anymore. It had been nearly 6 years since the Winchesters moved. Castiel thought about it, Dean would now be nearly the same age he was when he had moved to Lawrence. That thought right there had occurred to him as the timer went off and he went to the oven, removing the pie just as the knock came at the door.
Castiel took Dean's hand and led him down the hall to his bedroom. Once they were in the room, Dean pulled Castiel into him hard. Dean's hands ran over and down Castiel's body,  finding their place once again on his ass,  grinding their hips together. His devilish tongue was doing amazing things in his mouth and Castiel soon realized that air was completely overrated compared to the things Dean's mouth was doing to him.  The effect Dean was having on him was one that no other man ever had.  Lust and desire was building in him quickly, his own hands exploring Dean's muscular form.
Dean could feel those same old feelings starting to stir inside his gut as he looked into those blue eyes. 'Fuck! stop it Dean' he chides himself, but it was too late, those feelings were back and he knew he wouldn't be able to do anything about it.
Dean immediately grabbed the base of his cock with his hand and started flicking his tongue over its length,  Castiel's face flushed with embarrassment at his desperation. But Dean was too distracted in running his tongue,  lips and even his teeth ever so gently over his dick that he didn't seem to even notice. Castiel pushed those feelings aside and reveled in the sensations running  through his body. His hips rocking gently into Dean's touches,  whimpering noises escaping his parted lips.
"You looked so peaceful, I didnt want to wake you, and I didnt want you to get cold. I figured I'd stay a while, didn't want to just head out without saying goodbye." Dean sat up on the couch and stretched a little.
I hope ya'll enjoy it.
Dean lets out a low groan, "I want you to fuck me Cas." he casts his eyes to the bed briefly before looking back up. "But you're going to have to go slow at first. I've never done this before."
"That sounds good to me" Castiel hummed, pressing his face into Dean's neck.
"And what's the first Dean?" Castiel asked, his breathing already quickening.
Castiel sighed at the loss of warmth when Dean pulled his had away as they pulled into the driveway. "You wanna come up for awhile?" Dean asked, turning off the car.
Cas' eyes shyly darted to the floor beside them. "I, uh... It's what you like isn't it? It's how you kiss, I was just reciprocating what I could feel from you." His eyes looked up and met Dean's.
you want something? -C
"I hope so! Merry Christmas Castiel!" She said hugging his leg before running back down the hall to her room. He watched her and met Dean's gaze. Dean crooked a smile and shrugged slightly before following her.
"Cas, I need you too." Dean said breaking the kiss. His tongue flicked over his lips as he caught Cas' curious gaze. "I heard you in the shower earlier. God Cas, do you have any idea the effect you have on me." Dean rotated his hips, grinding his trapped erection into Cas' thigh, a moan escaping both their lips as he did. "Its overwhelming, I never thought you'd want me like this. Hell, part of me thinks I fell asleep on the couch over there and this is all a dream." He ran his hands down Cas' back and grabbed his ass, pulling him forcefully into his body, and another moan escaped them both.
"No, I get it. We went to church when I was really little. My dad went through a phase where we were going pretty regularly. By the time I was a teenager though we stopped going. My dad and I would have conversations about religion and he just wanted us to be exposed to it, so we could make our own decisions on what we wanted to believe."
"ugh, not so loud Char" Dean groans
"Morning Dean. Did you get any sleep last night?" He smiled softly, knowingly. Dean raised an eyebrow and Sam chuckled. "Look, I'm going to go and get some breakfast and then head to the library."
Cas hears a growl at the back of Dean's throat as he presses their bodies together, walking them backward, until Cas' legs catch on the bed and they are both falling onto it. Dean's hands slowly run over Cas' body as he kisses his jaw and down his throat. A shutter runs through Cas' body as Dean's thumb grazes his nipple and Dean smiles against his skin, running it over again and again until Cas moans arching his back into Dean's touch. "You like that?" Dean asks, his teeth lightly grazing over his collarbone, as his mouth moves down to his other nipple. Dean's tongue swirls around the sesitive flesh and Cas' moan is enough of an answer that Dean doesnt stop. He licks and sucks his nipple until its a hard nub and then he takes it gently between his teeth, biting gently.
"I've already got you, I don't want anything else." Castiel places a soft kiss on his lips.
Deans tongue flicks over the head of his cock, "Do you need me to stop?" he asks, teasing his tongue over the sensitive skin.
"Thank you Castiel." She said smiling up at him, putting her phone down and taking the gift from his hand."Can I open it now?"
Dean heaves a heavy sigh, "Jesus Cas. Why didnt you tell me? You can't be living at a gas station."
This pie was different though, this pie was a going away pie. John had gotten a really good job offer and the family was moving away. Castiel was sad, he was going to miss the Winchesters, he had become pretty good friends with John and Mary, and of course he was going to miss Dean coming over and begging for his pie.
Dean let out a low growl "I do now." he said slipping his tongue into Castiel's mouth kissing him until they were both breathless again. At some point during their make-out session, they had moved to the couch, and their kissing transformed from fast and needy to slow and lazy. Neither of them took notice when exactly the kissing had stopped and it wasn't long after that that they both dozed off, Dean laying back on the couch with Castiel tucked snugly between his legs, arms wrapped around his torso, head resting on his chest.
"But, it doesn't have to be a burden Dean." Cas was up behind him now, and the words were spoken softly in his ear. "I'm trying to tell you, that you don't  have to hide your feelings, I want you to share them. Share them with me, because..." There was a pause and Dean felt Cas' other hand rest on his waist. "Because Dean, I feel the same about you. You do something to me that I don't want to fight. If you fight, I have to fight... why must we always fight?" Cas rested his head against Dean's.
"Dean" Cas breathes just before Dean runs his tongue over his hole, slowly pushing inside of him. Cas' back arches off the bed as he throws his head back, fingers still grasping and pulling at the bed sheets. Dean licks and sucks at Cas' rim, his tongue pushing in and swirling around, drivng Cas mad with pleasure. Cas holds his breath as Dean slowly slides a finger into him and when he rolls his hips fro more, Dean is eager to give it to him, pumping and scissoring, stretching him open until Cas is Chanting Deans name. "Dean... please... " He begs, pushing his ass back onto Dean's fingers.
Dean closes his eyes moaning softly "My Angel"
He softly kisses the tip, his hand griping the base before he slowly sucks it into his mouth. It's soft and salty and tastes purely of Dean. He runs his tongue along the underside as he slowly slurps on the soft flesh. He so very rarely gets to do this. Their sex life is fantastic, and they both are almost always at least semi - hard when they are around each other...  Its very rare that Castiel gets Dean's cock when it's this soft, and he loves it. He sucks and slurps on it as it as it starts to harden, bobbing and twisting his head,  running his tongue along the underside of his cock, grazing his balls when he can before his cock is you hard and he can't reach them anymore without taking Dean's dick out of his mouth. He moans softly when he feels Dean's hand in his hair and smiles knowing that he's awake. He pops his mouth off looking up at Dean, his green lust blown eyes looking down at him. "good morning Dean" he says softly before taking him into his mouth again,  working a little rougher now that he's awake...
Dean swirled his warm tongue around his mouth as his hands wandered over his back, hungrily pulling their bodies closer and closer. Castiel's body still trembled wanting more, needing more. Dean broke the kiss and looked in Castiel's eyes. "Cas, you're shaking" he said kissing him gently "Are you ok with this?"
There wasn't a moment's hesitation before Cas' mouth was on Dean's again, with a little more force than the first time, but still tender. This time when Dean opened his mouth he met Cas' tongue with his own and deepened the kiss. A shudder ran through his body as Cas moaned into his mouth and ran his hand into his hair, trying to pull him in even deeper. When they broke the kiss, they both were left gasping for air, foreheads pressed against each other.
"Sure Dean, but please, don't call me by my first name."
Sam finally looked up at Dean. "And why exactly is that Dean!? What's so wrong with Cas that I cannot be in love with him?"
Dean turned his attention to the last of the whiskey in his glass. "Dammit Charlie, where are you?" he mutters as he sets his empty glass down and slid off his stool. The room dipped a little and he thought 'maybe I shouldn't have had that fourth glass without eating.' After regaining his bearings, he heads toward the bathroom. Thankfully it was empty and after relieving himself he turns to the sink to wash his hands and splash water on his face.
"Oh ok!"
"Cas, seriously, there's no way Nora pays you enough to practically be living there. Besides, you've had kind of a rough night. Let me take you home so you can get some sleep."
I am writing to you to let you know that I am coming home to Lawrence to visit some friends, and I was wondering if maybe I could stop by and see you as well. I know it's kind of short notice, and will not be able to wait for a response. So I have an idea, if you are ok with my stopping by for a visit, you could bake me a pie. You know my favorite (or at least I hope you remember), that way when I do stop by, if I can smell the pie baking I'll know it's ok to knock.
Dean reached his hand up and cupped Cas' face. "Yea Cas, you can do it again."
Dear Mr. Novak,
Today was going to be the day, Dean just felt it. He immediately wove his fingers into the feathers, and grabbed ahold of his wing, running his hand, massaging the warm hard bone that was there. He was so lost in the feeling he was getting just from touching them that he almost missed it. Castiel moaned softly, turning to give Dean a look of warning. This was the first time he'd gotten that reaction, hell this was the first time he'd gotten any kind of reaction. Dean didn't relent, he pushed his other hand into the feathers, massaging and teasing the wings, elating in the way they began to tremble. This time the moan was louder and Dean couldn't help but smile.
Castiel walked through the kitchen door, leaning back against it as it closed. He let out a heavy sigh, he didn't know what had come over him, but there was just something about the green eyed man with those perfectly pink lips that he couldn't resist.
"What?" She says, again a little louder than necessary, considering he's sitting right next to her, her head whips around wildly. She spots the woman and she chuckles. "Nah, that's just Dorothy, she works over in marketing." She says turning back to Dean and calls the waitress over to order another drink.
"Yea, it was.... was it that obvious?" Dean inquired, then "Was it bad?"
"Patience tiger. Don't you worry, I'm gonna take real good care of you" He says sliding a finger into Dean's hole, causing his breath to catch. He hooks his finger rubbing it slowly over his prostate, eliciting the most beautiful whimpering noises from Dean as he does it over and over before pushing in another finger. Dean's cock is fully hard in Cas' hand as he starts pumping harder as he thrusts his fingers in his ass, stretching him, adding a third finger. Dean throws his head back gasping "p..please Cas" he begs. Cas pulls his fingers out suddenly, leaving Dean's ass gaping. He walks over to his dresser opening a drawer rummaging around a little before pulling out a thick black cock ring, a bottle of lube and a couple condoms. He turns around looking at Dean bound on his bed and his cock twitches. He knew he was going to look beautiful laid out on his bed, but god damn, this boy was sent to him straight from heaven.
"You coming Cas? Or are you gonna make me wash myself?" Dean teased before walking to the bathroom, he could feel Cas' eyes on him, and knew there was no way the Angel wouldnt follow him.
"I want you to fuck me... hard...against the wall" Cas says
Dean sits frozen in place when Cas pulls away, just far enough to look into Dean's face. "Dean?"
"No Dean, I really would like to listen to this one again. I really enjoyed it. Please."
Ok, be over soon -C
At last the last button was done and Dean placed his hands on Castiel's hipbones, He looked down and moaned at the thought of kissing them, "later" he thought as he ran his hands across his soft firm stomach and up his chest to his shoulders once again. Finally shedding that last layer separating their upper bodies and pressed himself into Cas, warmth rushing over him as his arms went up to hold Cas' head into his neck.
This pie was different though, this pie was a going away pie. John had gotten a really good job offer and the family was moving away. Castiel was sad, he was going to miss the Winchesters, he had become pretty good friends with John and Mary, and of course he was going to miss Dean coming over and begging for his pie.
"Ok, well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow, and we can discuss this movie." Dean smiled, it would be interesting to see how different the brother's taste in movies were.
"you look incredible angel. I don't think you realize the effect that you have on me." Dean says as he strips off his own clothes. His hard cock weighing heavy between his legs.
Dean licks his lips and swallows before nodding his head. "yes" he says, his voice low. Cas growls as he picks Dean up, flipping him over on the bed. He moves to his dresser, pulling out a cornflower blue tie before walking back to the bed. He straddles Dean's back, letting the fabric of the tie drag across his skin, Dean's body shudders. Cas knots the tie around each of Dean's wrists before tying it to the headboard, making sure that he can easily move his wrists around.
Cas had felt him every time he silently yearned for the angel. Every stolen look, every thought that had crossed his mind. The adoration that Dean held onto for Cas, he had experienced it all with him. Had always wanted to share it with him, but had to wait, wait for Dean to realize that they both needed it. Cas had tried to show him, tried to let him know that he wasn't alone in his affections. But Dean, always down on himself wouldn't see it, or rather wouldn't allow himself to believe that it could be true. That Cas could possibly want him the way he wanted him, oh but he did. Cas thought about him just as much as Dean did the angel, wanted to know what it would be like to kiss him, to touch him, to taste him.
Castiel chuckled at his foolish thoughts as he walked down the hallway to the front door. There was another knock, a little more urgent this time. Castiel opened the door, and was immediately taken back by the 6'1 blonde man with green eyes that was standing on his door step.
Castiel walked through the kitchen door, leaning back against it as it closed. He let out a heavy sigh, he didn't know what had come over him, but there was just something about the green eyed man with those perfectly pink lips that he couldn't resist.
Cas adds more saliva to his fingers as he presses a third into him. Dean presses back into him greedily as Cas slowly pushes his fingers in and out of his stretched hole.
Dean's eyes followed Sam until he was out of sight. Then he had no choice but to look back at Cas who stood frozen in the same place, his head cocked to once side, eyes intently looking at Dean.
"well, consider that done Cas, I just fucking came in my pants, from a single touch."
"Thanks, but I'm afraid the church may burn down if I step foot in. I'd hate to ruin Christmas for everyone." Castiel chuckled.
"Oh ok!"
"Talk dirty to me Cas." Dean moans leaning down kissing him hard as he continues to ride him at a full gallop.
Dean swallows the thick cum with a moan as it slides down his throat. Pulling his mouth off him slowly, licking every inch of him clean as he does. "Fuck Angel, you're so damn perfect for me." Dean says as he slides his body up Cas' and kisses him deeply, fingers pulling free of his ass to remove the blindfold.
"Dean, I... was it to your satisfaction?"
"I don't have any clean clothes Dean, there's no point in me cleaning up if I don't have anything to change into."
Cas lets out a soft whimper at the loss of Dean's cock in his ass. He wraps his arms around Dean, afraid that at any second he's going to wake from this dream. But that doesn't happen, Dean kisses him softly as they both catch their breath. Cas smiles looking into his green eyes. "Dean?" Cas says
Cas stood frozen by the door for a long while before moving further into the room. It was small, but clean. There was a small couch on the far side of the room and a small dresser as well with a tv on top. By the window to the right of the door, there was a table with two chairs. To the left of the door there was a small nook with a very small stove, a refrigerator that sat on top of a cupboard in the corner, and a single basin sink, sunk into the small counter top. Cas ventured into the room and sat on the edge of the bed and waited for Dean.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"hey Darla, why don't you ask Cas if he wants to stay for some cookies?"
The room quickly fills with the sound of skin slapping again skin as Cas slams his cock inside Dean,  both panting and moaning out the other's name. Cas shifts his thrusts and Dean screams out his name when he slams full force into his prostate.  He's so happy he agreed to the date with Crowley,  because otherwise he would have never met this amazing angel who was making him feel things he'd never felt before.  He pulls hard against his binds,  wanting desperately to see Cas' face. He forces his hips down to the bed,  Cas' cock sliding of of him with a wet popping noise, quickly rolling  over and wrapping his legs up and around Cas' waist, rolling his hips up into him.  Cas looks at him stunned "I...  I needed to see you..."  Dean says,  his eyes searching Cas' ocean blue ones for forgiveness.  A mischievous grin spreads across Cas' face "look at you, all desperate and needy"  he breathes out running his hand along Dean's body.  Dean bites his lip whining,  hitching his hips into Cas' again,  his ass catching Cas' dick as he does.  He's able to push enough to get the head of his cock back in his ass,  but the tie binding his wrists prevents him from pushing back further.  "please Cas....  N.. N.. Need your fat cock inside me..."  Dean locks eyes with him,  desperately pleading with him which Cas apparently  can't resist as he thrusts hard into him,  ramming the head of his cock right into his prostate "Oh fuck Cas! Oh god! Nungh.... "  he moans as Cas continues to slam into him.  His hands roaming his body,  tweaking his nipples sending new pleasures through his body until his cock feels like it's going to explode.  "C.. Cas...."  he moans out watching his angel's face above him.  "p...Please... I need to come,  please let me come"  Cas breath quickens as he leans down bringing his face close to Dean's as they share the same air between them.  "not yet tiger,  I'm... Mmmm...  So close....  Wanna taste you"  he stutters out as his hips keep up their bruising pace.  Dean's lost in his staved orgasm,  he feels like he might bust his load through the cock ring,  but the promise of being able to come in Cas' mouth  is enough  to encourage him to hold on.
When the kiss broke, they both stood there, panting heavily, pink flushing their cheeks. "Damn, Cas, where the hell did you learn to kiss like that?"
Castiel knelt down to look at the doll. "She is beautiful Darla." His hand wiped the hair out of her face, "But I know a certain little girl who's even more beautiful" he winked at her.
Original imagine (unknown author)
Dean opens his laptop and brings up messenger, clicking on Charlie's name he types "I'm so screwed!"
"So what is Sam's punishment for hitting this boy?" Dean asks
Dean moved further down, lips softly grazing over Cas' ribs, to the soft skin on his stomach, he could feel it quivering beneath his lips and he kissed it, and slowly ran his hand to Cas' back pulling him up further into his mouth. He groaned as he felt Cas buck his hips up toward him, his hard cock jabbing him in the chest. "Oh Cas, be patient, I'm getting there baby. " He said into the soft flesh, his other hand moving down to Cas' hips pushing him back into the bed, and Cas let out an impatient sigh.
Jimmy took one last step toward him and in one swift movement slipped his hand down the front of Dean's shorts, grabbing his very hard dick. Dean couldn't hold back the gasp that escaped his lips and more than he could control how his hips rotated shoving his dick harder into Jimmy's hand. "You want this, don't deny yourself." Jimmy said softly, then whispered in his ear "Let us make you feel good Dean"
"Baby, I'm just getting started" Dean says as he flips Cas onto his stomach, spreading Cas' legs wider with his knees, he takes a moment to slick his cock with lube before sliding deep inside him with one smooth thrust.
"But it's your 18th, you've gotta let me do something special."
"Ok Cas, we'll stick to Zeppelin, since you obviously already like them." Dean sits up on the bed against the headboard and presses the shuffle button on the remote. Robert Plant's voice comes through the speakers, and Dean can hardly believe it. "And if I say to you tomorrow. Take my hand, child, come with me."
"it's ok Cas, you dont have to say anything. I'm not even sure what to do with this information. I mean, yea, obviously I .... Shit! this is hard, Cas. These chick flick moments aren't my forte" Dean ran a hand through his hair, scruffing the back of his neck.
She giggled again before running over to Dean and grabbing his hand, pulling him off the couch and toward Castiel. "Now it's your turn daddy. You gotta give Castiel a kiss too!" Castiel felt his face flush, and was surprised to see color rising in Dean's cheeks as well. "C'mon you gotta, its the rules"
As the music faded at the end of the song Dean realized that he had leaned forward and his forehead was now resting against Cas'. How long had they been sitting there like that? Dean took in a deep breath as he sat up sharply, the ear buds falling out of both their ears. "I'm sorry Cas, guess I'm more tired than I thought. I'm going to call it a night ok?" Dean shifted back, breaking all physical contact with him.
"Oh, what's the matter, does Jimmy get jealous?" Dean teased, a smirk tugging at his lips.
This time it was Cas who chuckled. "But I like you like this.... vulnerable. " He rolled to his side, running his hand over Dean's sticky stomach, pulling him in closer as he nibbled on his neck.
P.S. I still think of you and your delicious pie often!
"Thank you." Castiel threw back the blanket and stood, coming face to face with Dean,  he felt the blood rushing to his cheeks and ears and he swallowed hard. God he was so beautiful.
Dean felt the deep pooling warmth in this stomach as Cas continued to ride him. "Oh FUCK Cas.... I'm so close.... ungh!" Cas sat up, forcing Dean's cock in far as it could go and stared rotating his hips, grinding their pelvis' together, and started doing that delicious thing again where his muscles fluttered and twitched around him. Dean felt his orgasm build from his toes and it racked his entire body, lifting him off of the bed as it rushed through him. His load filled Cas so full, that it was leaking out of him even though neither of them had moved. Dean collapsed back onto the bed, breathing ragged as Cas milked his cock through the rest of his orgasm.
"Ok, baby." Dean pulled back again, his hands going to either side of Cas' face again, Green meeting blue once more. "It's your turn, just let go, I'm gonna take real good care of you." Dean took a step forward, pushing Cas back until the edge of the bed caught his legs. He felt the angel tense up for a moment. "It's ok, I've got you" and Cas fell backwards onto the bed.
"That you will be mine,
"You love me Cas?" Dean says sitting up a little
"Not yet Dean, I'm not ready for that yet." Cas repositioned himself, spreading Dean's legs, resting his left leg over Cas' right shoulder and settled in, face buried in the crook of Dean's groin. He inhaled deeply, breathing in Dean's musk. He smelled like leather and the deep woods. Cas nuzzled his nose into the warmth there, before running his tongue over the soft skin around his balls. He reached his hand out without looking, searching for the lube. Dean's breath hitched as the cool lube it his hot skin.
“Or they merge and time starts to die.”
“yeah of course, anything”
“I was ‘rescued’ by a local, she’s a midwife,”that prompted a soft chuckle from Dean.
“I’m starting to wonder why, I’ll see you later.”
“To say I’m sorry, I’m not good at this. I didn’t mean to make you feel bad” Chris risked a glance at his reflection, utter dejection. She bit her lip, feeling guilty over her angry reaction and knowing where that anger came from. She was going to die.
“Yeah we are very proud.”
“Dean, no.” Sam disappeared into his room and came back with his gym bag. “I have to go, I’m teaching Worf’s Mok’bara class tonight.”
“You think I’m a moron?” It was said seriously, but Dean saw the ghost of a smile tugging at Cas’ lips.
“I could fix you,” his eyes raked her body, a lecherous smile twisting the bearded lips.
“I love you too Dean, but I do fear we may have just made things more complicated.”
“The arch angel Gabriel.” Asmodeus’ eyes bulged at the name, Chris’ grabbed his tie and yanked the demon closer.
“Why bless your black little heart, I can and you know it too” Chris let the energy crackle between her fingers “Maybe you need a little persuasion,” she leaned forward and laid a finger on Asmodeus’ forehead. Chris sent liquid fire running through his bones, the demon screeched and jerked.  She dropped her hand after a few seconds, Asmodeus slid bonelessly from his seat and crumpled to the ground. He looked up at her, utter hatred shining in his eyes. “Was that good for you?” Chris permitted herself a small smile.
“What kind of choice is that?”
“Thats it get it down you kiddo” Gabe turned to the brunette on his arm, “Now Susan-”
“He drowned, the fishing boat he was on capsized. Lost all hands” that explained the smell then and the faint roaring of waves echoing in Cas’ ears.
“Just a bright light, and my family at home.” Cas felt a sudden panic in his chest. “do you have a cell phone? I should ring them.”
“Possibly, it’s Cas who knows what kind of repressed bullshit goes on inside that nerdy little angel brain of his.” Dean cracked open another bottle from the six pack on the table, “Maybe he just needs to get laid” he grinned at Sam.
“I love you” he told her, wanting to say it while he still could, loving the fact he could say it at all.
“Cas, what the hell is going on, who is she?” Dean demanded, but Cas had no answer for him. Slowly Asasa allowed her wings to fade and the light to die in her eyes. She sheathed her sword and leaned back against the counter top nonchalantly playing with the end of one of her sliver bound dreadlocks.
“I’m sorry baby girl, I had to make a deal. You won’t see him again.” Chris pulled herself upright and walked to the brow of the hill, in her head she could hear the angels calling, but one voice stood out from all the others, different, but some how still the same. She smiled to herself and took a deep breath.
“Okay well then that’s great” Dean jumped out of his chair, he couldn’t handle the way he was starting to feel right now. “Put her in Jack’s room, she can’t stay on the table. I’m going to check in with Sammy and I need a drink.”
“Ariela, we need you to come to the bunker. Chris is really sick-”Sam held up his hands “She hung up on me.” There was a sound like a thunder clap, followed by a rush of feathers and Ariela was there, her eyes blazed and wings shone monstrously large against the walls . The Arch-angel was projecting a maelstrom of rage, Dean could feel it plucking at his brain. he resisted the urge to cower as Ariela raked all three of them with her golden gaze, breathing a sigh of relief when she seemed to dismiss them as unimportant. The glow faded and Ariela’s expression shifted from rage to profound sadness as she regarded her sleeping daughter.
“Don’t hold your breath, Cas.” Chris leaned forward and turned the radio up “Love this song”, she explained. Cas listened to the words frowning.
“I know Sammy, I’m not taking things seriously enough for you, but the whole things damned weird. I think he’s piling all his crap into saving this girl, like that will make things right or something.”
"Merry Christmas!" She exclaimed  as she ran around the car to get in.
The first time Dean touched himself thinking about Cas, in the back seat of the impala, Cas could almost feel the sensations, and it drove him wild.
Dean bucked his hips into Castiel slowly, moaning and reaching down running his hands through his hair. When he just couldn't take it anymore, he reached up, unbuttoning his jeans, he needed to relieve some of the pressure. His dick was trapped in a denim prison and being tortured by the most gorgeous mouth he'd ever seen.  Castiel looked up at him, his face flushed, his lips pink and swollen, and "Fuck Cas,  you're so fucking perfect"
The kiss was brief but full of fire. "Cas" Dean growled "you need to stop doing things that make me want to eat you. Just being near you is hard enough, but when you bite your lip like that, and look at me with those beautiful blue eyes... I... Just... I dont know if I'm going to be able to control myself." Dean planted a softer kiss at the corner of his mouth.
Castiel quickened his pace again, placing his hand on Dean's lower back for leverage, Dean moaned again, louder "fuck" he said turning his head back once again "fuck me harder" he whispered and Castiel obliged, pounding into his ass hard and fast. He leaned down first kissing then biting Dean's shoulder.
Dean cocked an eye brow "I can think of many things I'd like to do now. But you may have to give me a little time to be up to the task" He winked.
Dean growled, pulling him back in for a deep kiss. "53 days" he said as Castiel pulled away from him.
Castiel kept his eyes locked on Dean's as he took him fully into his mouth. He tasted amazing and Castiel loved the feel of him in his mouth, the tip of his dick pressing hard against his throat as he bobbed his head down. He watched Dean's face his perfect lips forming an 'O' as he in turn watched Castiel. He ran his hands over Dean's thighs,  reaching back and cupping his balls and Dean thrust hard into his mouth, shoving his dick even further down his throat. Castiel pulled his mouth off taking a deep breath "Fuck my face Dean"
"Uh, you can just drop me back at the store, I've got to open in the morning anyway." He says quietly, hoping that Dean wont notice the time, which of course he does.
"Damn Cas, be careful with that forceful tone, you're giving me tingles." Castiel squinted his eyes at him, in an attempt to look stern. "All right, I'm going" Dean reached around and slapped his ass "But you better be ready for me when I get back" he winked at him and headed to his room.
"God yes Dean, please!" Castiel moaned beneath him.
Dean Winchester
I wasnt sure at first that this was going to happen, but then I decided I needed one more really steamy scene between these two... I worked on this off and on for a couple weeks... I hope you like it. Though, I do feel like the tone is a little different than the rest of the story. If I ever go back and edit this, that will definitely be something I work on. But for now, this was fun. And I hope ya'll have enjoyed my very first Destiel fanfic!
"So did you and your family have your holiday party?"
"Yes my angel?" Dean replies, running his hand through Cas' hair.
Cas opens his door pulling Dean in behind him. Dean slams him against the door as he closes it, smashing their mouths together. Cas pushes him further into the apartment, hands trailing down his body, holding his hips throwing him against the wall in the hallway. "Now now tiger, I'm in control of this ride." His nimble fingers pop open the button of Deans jeans and he slides his hand in over his hard cock. Dean hisses at the touch. "Thats a good boy, let me take care of you." Cas licks at his neck, sucking a red mark before moving down further to his collar bone. His hand slowly massaging Deans dick.
When Cas pulls back Dean is panting, and he realizes his pants are gathered around his ankles. "I need you inside me Dean" Cas says head tilted back slightly and his eyes closed.
"Dean, I'm not going anywhere. We have all the time in the world. Just breathe, I've got you."
"Close your eyes Dean, I'll watch over you"
"What is it Cas?"
Castiel had moved in next door to the Winchesters about 6 months ago fresh out of college and living on his own for the first time. John and Mary had been wonderful neighbors, helping them with anything that he had needed, and their sons Dean and Sam helped as much as they could as well. It was as a sign of appreciation that Castiel baked his first pie for them. A classic apple pie, still warm when he brought it over with the tub of vanilla ice cream. Everyone seemed to thoroughly enjoy it, but it was Dean who went back for seconds and even thirds Mary informed Castiel the next day when she returned the pie plate.
"Tempting Cas." Dean said, pulling their bodies apart as he sat up. "But there's much fun to be had in the shower" He slid off the bed and stood, turning to look at Cas over his shoulder. He looked absolutely wrecked hair mussed, beautiful blue eyes wide, lips swollen and red, marks all over his neck and chest, perfect cock laying gloriously on his thigh, legs spread. It was all he could do not to climb back on top of him, his own cock perking with interest again already.
I hid away from the world, trying to get a handle on the fact that he would never be mine. When I finally called my sister back, I lied and told her that I had bad sushi. After a brief conversation she begs me to meet her for lunch and I reluctantly agree. How am I supposed to hide this from her. How can I sit back and watch her fall in love with him, when I wanted him so badly. I resolved to simply not tell her that he was in fact the guy I rescued that night.
He watched as the future him snapped his head back looking at Cas "Cas!" he growls
Dean excuses himself from the table once more, grabbing his leather jacket as he heads toward the back door once again. He hasn't given himself any time to think about what hes doing, he just needs to look into Castiel's eyes, to feel those full lips against his skin, to hear that rough sex lined voice again. When he opens the door to the back alley he doesn't see him, but suddenly there's warm breath on his ear "Are you ready for the night of your life?" Castiel asks walking past him smacking his ass. Dean's speechless, as he follows him. When he gets to the car Castiel grabs him by the waist pulling him into his body as he leans back against the car. "What's the matter beautiful, cat got your tongue?" he asks him before kissing him deeply.
~No One Like You
Cas thrusts hard and deep into Dean as he feels his orgasm coming on.  He locks eyes with the beautiful green eyed boy as he feels the pressure building inside him.  His breath hitches at the same time as his hips and he thrusts once more deep inside of Dean "nungh....  Ah..  Ah.... Ahhhhhh! Dean! Ohhhh!" he cries out as his orgasm rips through his body.  He burries his head into the crook of Dean's biting down on the tender skin as he comes inside him.  Dean let's out a deep groan,  hitching his own hips up.  As Cas catches his breath he looks up into Dean's eyes,  seeing the desperation for his own release.  He licks his way down his body,  his softening cock pulling out of Dean.  He pulls off the condom,  knotting it and tossing it in the trash before turning his attention to Dean's thick swollen red cock.  He runs his tongue teasingly over the head before wrapping his lips around it and taking him into his mouth completely. Dean writhes under him "p.. Please Cas...  I..  I gotta....  Ungh....." he begs.  Cas wraps his hand tightly around the base of his cock as he pulls the ring off.  He looks up at Dean's face.  "ready tiger?"  he asks  flicking his tongue over the slit gathering the precum that had worked it's way out.  Dean nods furiously,  desperately,  his bottom lip caught between his teeth.  Cas smirks "give it to me"  he says wrapping his lips around his cock,  his hand letting go of the base. Dean let's out a primal cry as his orgasm tears through his body,  bucking up into Cas' mouth,  shoving his cock deep into his throat as hot cum pours out of him.  Cas swallows quickly to save himself from choking on the what seems to be gallons of cum shooting down his throat.  When Cas has finally milked the last of the cum from Dean's cock,  he pulls his mouth off,  leaning up to kiss Dean as his body still shakes.  "you're fucking perfect" he says kissing him. Dean moans, his eyes fluttering open to look at Cas, green eyes meeting blue.  And even though they both just had the most amazing orgasms,  they knew this night was far from being over.
Once two fingers were sliding in and out easily, Castiel tentatively started to press in a third, and he heard Dean's breath hitch. "There's lube on..." Dean's voice caught as Castiel forwent the lube and instead plunged his tongue into his opening next two the two fingers that were already there. "Mmmmm.... oh yea, Oh God Cas! Fuck... yea... fuck me with your tongue. Oh God that feels delicious." Dean's hips were hitching erratically, as though torn between pressing back onto Castiel's tongue or thrusting into his hand.
"What did you mean earlier when you were talking to Sam?"
Dean licks his lips and he notices Cas' eyes move down, following the movement. "Cas..." he says softly, not knowing what was happening in this moment.
Cas smiles shyly leaning in and pressing his lips to Dean's. "I want you to, I need you to." He says kissing him again. "I need to feel you" he bites his lip, eyes flicking down to the front of Deans jeans then back up. "All of you"
He looked up at Cas who was sitting toward the foot of the bed and smiled. "Cas, you're going to have to scoot up here, I only have ear buds, so we're gonna have to share, you need to be closer."
"I think I might be in love with Cas." Dean's eyes snapped up to look at his brother as he tried to process the words that had just come out of Sam's mouth. They were sitting at the table in the library in the bunker.
"I left him a note thanking him for being a douche." Cas laughed starting the car.
His hand holds just tightly enough to move it to the side as dean runs his tongue down his thigh, sucking a deep red mark. Cas' hips buck up into Dean's touch, his head rolling back as a low groan escapes him. Dean's mouth moves over, his tongue lightly running over Cas' balls and a choked "Dean!" escapes Cas this time, which only seems to encourage Dean further as he sucks them into his mouth. When Dean pulls back, Cas' balls sliping from his mouth with a loud pop, Cas looks down at him.
Castiel set the pie on the stove and walked to the door to let Dean in. He was taken back when Dean looked up at him with tears in those green eyes. "Everything ok Dean?"
"It's not like that." Castiel said casting his eyes down.
Pleasure ripped through his body as Dean slowly began thrusting into him. Castiel wrapped his legs around Dean's hips tightly, trying to pull him impossibly closer. "Fuck Dean, God your dick feels amazing. Fuck me, fuck me hard, please Dean, fuck me with your huge cock." Castiel breathed as Dean began fucking into him. He wrapped his arms around Dean, grabbing his ass, digging his fingers in, still trying to pull him in even closer. Dean shifted slightly and thrust hard, hitting his prostate, a scream ripped from Castiel's lips and filled the room "Fuck yea! Do that a... Aah.. Ahhhh!" Castiel screamed again as Dean continued to hit his prostate. "Dean, Oh dean" he began to chant as Dean fucked him into the counter, his legs and arms still wrapped round him, as though he was afraid Dean was going to float away.
Cas gasps, mouth gaping at the intrusion. Dean hold still a moment, letting him adjust. He can feel Cas twitching around his finger, and his cock jumps with jealousy. As soon as he feels Cas start to relax, he begins moving his finger, slowly in and out, eliciting soft moans and gasps from Castiel's lips. He pushes all the way in and wiggles his finger around, and Cas squirms, pushing back on his hand as if trying to get even more of him inside, Dean takes this cue and slips in another finger, scissoring them, opening Cas up. As Dean works his fingers in and out of Cas, nuzzling into his neck, Cas' breath is getting ragged and his hips start moving into his fingers, slowly setting the pace.
"Not if you keep your hair down." Dean tells her. "So are you going to see her again?"
The room quickly fills with the sound of skin slapping again skin as Cas slams his cock inside Dean, both panting and moaning out the other's name. Cas shifts his thrusts and Dean screams out his name when he slams full force into his prostate. He's so happy he agreed to the date with Crowley, because otherwise he would have never met this amazing angel who was making him feel things he'd never felt before. He pulls hard against his binds, wanting desperately to see Cas' face. He forces his hips down to the bed, Cas' cock sliding of of him with a wet popping noise, quickly rolling over and wrapping his legs up and around Cas' waist, rolling his hips up into him. Cas looks at him stunned "I... I needed to see you..." Dean says, his eyes searching Cas' ocean blue ones for forgiveness. A mischievous grin spreads across Cas' face "look at you, all desperate and needy" he breathes out running his hand along Dean's body. Dean bites his lip whining, hitching his hips into Cas' again, his ass catching Cas' dick as he does. He's able to push enough to get the head of his cock back in his ass, but the tie binding his wrists prevents him from pushing back further. "please Cas.... N.. N.. Need your fat cock inside me..." Dean locks eyes with him, desperately pleading with him which Cas apparently can't resist as he thrusts hard into him, ramming the head of his cock right into his prostate "Oh fuck Cas! Oh god! Nungh.... " he moans as Cas continues to slam into him. His hands roaming his body, tweaking his nipples sending new pleasures through his body until his cock feels like it's going to explode. "C.. Cas...." he moans out watching his angel's face above him. "p...Please... I need to come, please let me come" Cas breath quickens as he leans down bringing his face close to Dean's as they share the same air between them. "not yet tiger, I'm... Mmmm... So close.... Wanna taste you" he stutters out as his hips keep up their bruising pace. Dean's lost in his staved orgasm, he feels like he might bust his load through the cock ring, but the promise of being able to come in Cas' mouth is enough to encourage him to hold on.
Two weeks later and  I still felt bad just leaving him there alone, but I wasn't sure how he'd feel with some random stranger sleeping on his couch. In hind sight, I should have at least left a note. He's all I can think about lately, I'm not sure if it's some kind of hero complex or what, but there's a part of me that just wants to know he's alright. My sister thinks I should just show up at his apartment and explain, but how weird would that be? 'Oh, hi, I helped you home after you were beaten and left in an alley, but was too shy to leave a note, and now here I am stalking you because I want to know you're alright, and think you're really cute.' I can just see how that would go over, he'd probably laugh in my face.
Dean nips at his lips, "uh-uh, you've got to earn those. I wanna hear you, how else am I going to know you're enjoying this?" Dean says running his thumb over Cas' nipple again.
When the movie finished Dean sent Darla to her room to get dressed and get her things around to go to her mother's. The moment he heard the door close Dean pulled Castiel in for a kiss. "I just can't get enough of these damn lips Cas."
Dean moaned into the kiss, he was laying next to Cas, his left leg draped over his body, his hardening cock resting on Cas' hip. An occasional shutter still running through Cas' body as he lazily kissed him back. Cas looked at Dean. "Thank you Dean... that... that was wonderful"
"MMMmmm.... mm..mmmoree... D.. Dean.... mmmmmMM... mmore!" Cas pleads, and Dean is happy to oblige, he slips in another finger and Cas hisses softly at the stretch, but he's soon rocking his hips once again so fervently that Dean doesnt even have to move his hand. He grinds his cock into Cas' thigh, its rock hard due to the intoxicatingly sexy noises that Cas has been making.
She giggled and took his hand, pulling him toward the tree "Come see what else I got Castiel" Castiel willingly followed where she pulled him, watching as she swooped down grabbing her gifts and telling him about them. Dean had moved to the couch, it was his turn to watch. When Castiel looked at him, he saw a softness to his face that was reserved for Darla, one of love and admission, only Dean wasn't just watching Darla, he was looking at him too. Castiel got lost for a moment looking at Dean, when all of a sudden Darla squealed. "Oooh! Daddy look!" both sets of eyes quickly moved to the little girl who had a huge smile on her face and was pointing above Castiel's head. He knew in an instant that he had once again stopped under the mistletoe. "Mistletoe Castiel! You know what that means right?" she giggled.
Cas looks up into Deans eyes, "why are you so good to me?" he asks panting.
As much as Cas desperately wanted Dean, needed Dean. He didnt want to force Dean to do anything he wasnt ready for. "Dean, it's ok. I'm not expecting anything from you. I would still like for you to stay with me, but it doesn't have to anything more than that."
"I think we should move this to the bedroom." Dean hummed in approval as he nipped at his jawbone."And Dean..." Castiel turned his head looking at him. " I really think you should call me by my first name. Mr. Novak makes me feel old. " Castiel licks Dean's lips. "And if this is going where I most certainly hope it's going. The last thing I want to feel is old."
Dean Winchester
"Yea man, I've had a few of those."
Dean smiled and reached his hand out to Cas's chest and gently touched his nipple, Cas' breath hitched and he looked down. "Looks like I'm not the only one with a few bruises" He bit his lip and looked up at Cas. "I marked you up good Angel. Now everyone will know you're mine." He said as he leaned in for a soft kiss.
"Well actually Dean, Cas is an angel, he's a celestial being, the whole gau/straight thing is merely physical. And while, no, I wouldn't say that sexually I am attracted to Cas, but there is more to love than just sex. Besides, maybe... I don't know... have you seen him? I mean those eyes alone are enough to make the straightest of straight men a little gay for him." Sam still was staring at his screen. Dean just gaped at him, dammit, Sam was right, everything he said was true. But still, Sam couldn't be in love with Cas...
"Would you like to stay Cas?" Dean asked softly after a few minutes.
"Hello Dean" Castiel said, taking a step closer, and hanging the towel on the handle of the fridge.
"have you finished your daily list?" She asks as she turned from the desk with the paper she was looking for in her hand.
"Dean, what you told Sam... that you need me, you know that you have me right? That even if Sam were in love with me, which is completely absurd, that you would still have me... I'm always here for you." He took another step, stopping just inches in front of Dean. "Always Dean, I'm yours."
"There's no one like you
"Yeah..." Cas nods as he tries reaching for another kiss.
Charlie blushes bright red and giggles "is she really checking me out?" she asks as she sneaks a look over her shoulder.
Dean pops the driver's door and slides into the seat behind the wheel, where he looks more at home than any place Cas has ever seen him. Without a word he closes the door and starts the car, the engine roaring to life, and sending the familiar rumble through Cas' body. Every passing moment is one closer to having to say goodbye again, and Cas just is not ready for that. He turns and looks as his profile, light moving over his face highlighting different features as they drive down the street.
Castiel smirked "Well, it was" he paused leaning in flicking his tongue across then pulling Dean's bottom lip between his teeth teasingly. "From a girl at least." his smile widened.
"Cas, I... Uh..." Dean started and Cas shook his head
Cas licked his lips ad nodded his head, "Yes Dean, I very much..... ngh..." Dean thrust hard into him again, hitting his prostate. "I want to make you you feel like this. I want to...." Again Dean thrust into him "OOOhh! Dean, I want to make you feel like this!" Cas' threw his head back, exposing his neck to Dean, who immediately began running his lips and teeth over the sensitive skin, then licking a line up his throat to his chin and then taking his mouth hard again. Tongue wildly laying claim to his mouth.
Let's spend the night together."
Dean flicks his tongue over the head again before firmly gripping the base and taking him into his mouth in one quick motion, pulling back just as quickly with a gasp.
Dean smiled deviously and placed the pie on the night stand. He turned and gathered Castiel into his arms kissing him deeply with renewed passion. "That sounds like a deal. Have I ever told you that you make the best pie ever? It's the second most delicious thing I have ever tasted." Dean smiled again before taking Castiel's mouth into his again, grinding his already hardening cock against his thigh.
"The first time you showed me this song, I knew..."
"Mmmm yea... I love that" Dean says kissing him deeply. He runs his hands down, letting out a low moan as he feels the fishnets encasing Cas' gorgeous thighs. "So many things I want to do to you baby." he says against his lips.
Dean sees that pink flush that he loves so much, paint Cas' cheeks as he casts his eyes down for a moment and then raises them back up to Dean's, blue meeting green and Dean swears he sees those damn sparks flying again. How does Cas have this effect on him?
Cas grabs the lube squirting some on his fingers before pressing them back into Dean's hole,  sliding in with ease,  fingers on his left hand fucking him while he scratches his other hand down Dean's back until he's laying in a full out submissive position begging "p..p..please Cas! I want you...  I NEED you inside me! P.. Please fuck me!"  Dean's voice sounds completely wrecked and Cas can't deny this beautiful boy any longer.  He once again pulls his fingers free of his ass,  grabbing a condom ripping  package open he quickly slides it on squirting more lube over his hard cock before lining himself up with Dean's more than ready and willing ass. "God damn tiger,  you look so fucking beautiful"  he says playfully running the tip of his dick over Dean's fluttering hole. Dean whines,  pushing his ass back,  trying to obtain more contact.  Cas smacks his ass again "I told you,  I'm in control of this ride Dean" Dean groans,  trying not to once again push back into Cas as he finally presses the head of his cock into his ass. They both moan as Cas slowly pushes inside Dean's hot tight ass,  letting Dean adjust to the intrusion,  stopping when Dean holds his breath... moving forward again when he hears him take another until he's balls deep in his ass. His hips flush with Dean's and he groans out,  fingers digging deep into Dean's hips,  leaving bruises as he starts thrusting slowly in and out of him,  picking up his pace as Dean begs underneath him.
Dean's movement was quick when he pulled away, Castiel's mouth chasing the skin as it moved. Dean took Castiel's hand and quickly slurped two of his fingers into his mouth, getting them nice and wet before pulling them out. "I want you in me Cas. I need you to be in me please!" Dean turned, kneeling forward with ass toward him, he took Castiel's wet fingers and pressed them against his opening. The moan that escaped him was so dirty that if Castiel hadn't already been turned on, that moan would have done it. Castiel pulled his legs up, kneeling behind Dean, his spit slicked fingers working around the puckered ring of muscle, pressing and sinking into him slowly. Dean's arms gave out from under him and he lay forward on the bed, ass up in the air. Castiel continued working first one, then two fingers into him, while reaching under him and playing with his cock because he just couldn't get enough of it.
When Cas cleared his throat, Dean's eyes snapped up to meet his. "Dean?"
"Sam! you can't be in love with Cas! you just can't be ok!"
Dean heaves a heavy sigh, "Jesus Cas. Why didnt you tell me? You can't be living at a gas station."
"Does it feel good? hmm? You like your fat dick in my ass? Come on baby, tell me how much you like me riding your cock." Dean says letting out low dirty moans in Cas' ear.
"Well actually Dean, Cas is an angel, he's a celestial being, the whole gau/straight thing is merely physical. And while, no, I wouldn't say that sexually I am attracted to Cas, but there is more to love than just sex. Besides, maybe... I don't know... have you seen him? I mean those eyes alone are enough to make the straightest of straight men a little gay for him." Sam still was staring at his screen. Dean just gaped at him, dammit, Sam was right, everything he said was true. But still, Sam couldn't be in love with Cas...
Cas lowers his head, breaking eye contact as he licks the taste of Dean off his lips, sucking the lower one in savoring it before he speaks. "I'm..." he starts, hes... he's what exactly? sorry? no, he's not sorry... he wants Dean, he'll never be sorry for that. "I just wanted to know what that was like. I... I'm just lonely Dean. I've been so alone, and I've missed you." Cas looked watching Dean's face soften. "I'm not going to say sorry, I'm not sorry that I kissed you. I've wanted to do that for a long time, and since I lost my grace, since becoming human, those feelings have only grown stronger, you are all I think about." Cas waits for Dean to reply and Dean just stares at him. "It's ok Dean. You don't have to say anything. I just...I just couldn't hold back anymore. You were here, you were holding me, and that felt so nice. After all of those years of me comforting you, it felt nice to have you do that for me. And you're leaving me again, I just wanted to take a little bit to carry with me... It does...."
