Brook reached around Sherlock and picked up his bow with the broken string. He twirled it lazily around in a circle. “Victor turned out to be so ordinary.”
Sherlock remained silent, but grabbed his smoking jacket and wrapped it tightly around his frame. He grabbed his pipe and began to fix himself a smoke.
“This baton was made for Queen Victoria after the grand opening of the Conservatory. Isn’t it beautiful?” He handed the baton to Sherlock, who gingerly inspected it from all sides.
Molly ignored the fact that Sherlock didn’t look entirely convinced regarding her little white lie. He instead motioned for her to get into the cab.
The two men lived as if they were married, sharing a bed, but John still worried about appearances. In the beginning, he kept up the pretense of inhabiting the second bedroom, though Sherlock insisted it was not necessary. Mrs. Hudson knew the situation and frankly, didn’t care one bit what they did behind closed doors. Yet, John continued the facade, until one morning Mrs. Hudson finally spoke up.
“I wouldn’t tell just anyone this, Dr. Watson, but you seem to care for him quite a bit,” said the officer. “How much do you know about what transpired in Transvaal?”
“You’re the new concertmaster!” Brook said grinning, giving Sherlock a friendly shake. “Only it’s a good idea to show up to practice so you can actually be the concertmaster.” Brook looked at him expectantly. “Aren't you excited?
The two men didn’t dare discuss the matter until they were back in Lord Sherlock’s bed chamber, alone and dressing for breakfast one morning. John was fastening his lordship’s vest when Sherlock broached the subject, rather clumsily.
Brook smiled, but then, his face contorted into a sneer as he shouted. “That’s enough!” He glared at the room. “Reichenbach Concerto, from the top.”
John nodded. "We're fine.” He leaned forward again and his hot tongue invaded Sherlock's wet, swollen mouth. Their cocks kissed each other, wet and hard and throbbing.
“Of course,” he said. “You need to get a little stronger for the journey but it won’t be long now. You’re on the mend. You’re going to fine.”
Felipe settled back against the wall and was soon asleep. John watched his broad chest rise up and down evenly under his crossed arms. His long legs were stretched out in front of him, his booted feet propped up on the tiny stool. John curled up and gazed at his kind face, his tiny wrinkles now smooth, his well-defined jaw lax and making his lips form a soft pout.
John walked around the room sipping his tea and stretching his legs. He went to the window and looked out. He was thrilled to see young Siger, now fourteen, running along the grounds with Oliver, the tiny family bulldog.
“And this one, with the carved oak handle and spindles, belonged to Daniel Turk. He used to wave the baton so high he would hit the chandelier above his head and shower himself with glass!”
"I saw you, this morning,” he said somberly. “I was on the way back from rounds. I saw you walk out of the flat.”
“That’s not the point,” John interrupted. “Please, give me two minutes. Then, I'll buy us another round.”
A brief silence passed between them. Both men could feel the emotions of the past fighting to get inside their moment of happiness. Sherlock sat up weakly and laid back against the cold stone wall.
“Yeah, it's completely fucked,” John said softly. “I've done things I'm not proud of either, Sherlock. Lots of things." John suddenly looked very sad. He took Sherlock's hand into his and squeezed.
“Master Siger has grown into a fine young man, m’lord,” said John, pleased to see the boy in good health, but rather confused at why he was being asked to watch the boy play catch with his dog.
“You want to forget, but your mind won’t let you,” he said. “You can have your guard up during the day, but at night…” He trailed off, but reached for Sherlock’s fists and gently pried them way. He laced his blunt fingers into his slender ones.
William stood near the window by the old dressing table, a hand clamped over his forearm. His shirt was torn at the sleeve and was turning redder by the moment. A bit of blood dribbled into the floor. He was not only surrounded by broken glass but submerged in it. Shards of it glistened in his hair and over his shoulders, and John could already make out a couple of tiny cuts bleeding on his cheekbones.
It was in the middle of the day when Captain Lestrade appeared in the doorway. He knocked on the open door.
"My - oh. I must've forgotten it. I just started walking," he said. Slowly his face softened as he realized Sherlock was holding onto him. He smiled weakly. "I guess my autopilot brought me here."
He went to turn away, but the doctor caught his hand. Felipe's dark eyes burned intensely, his expression fierce. He placed a hand delicately on the back of John's neck, his breath quickening as he licked his full lips.
Mr. Thomas opened the door to 221B and greeted Holmes and Watson warmly as they spilled out of the cab. Marie followed closely behind. Watson observed both seemed rather rosy and vibrant.
Slowly, he was lowered down onto the side of the wooden beams. William was wedged between two of the pillars, with the lower half of his body submerged in the water. John’s feet touched the lake, and he cried out from the cold.
John stared at Sherlock with his puffy eyes and swollen nose, and tried to compose himself. He shook his head, and swallowed, then tried again.
Garrett trembled violently as the tears bubbled out of his eyes. He stumbled out of his chair, picked up his trombone case, and practically ran out the door.
Sherlock bit his lower lip. John moved to the bed. He was on his knees to between Sherlock’s legs. He began to snip, beginning at one ankle and moving on up to Sherlock’s crotch.
“The medical school in Tangier,” said John softly, as he ran his fingers through wild, dark curls. “Captain Lestrade found you at the village school and brought you here.”
Sherlock took a step forward but John grabbed him, pulling him back by his shoulders and out the door. They fought and pushed at each other but John refused to let him go until they’d cleared all the stairwells and were safely outside the main hall, arguing and shouting in the courtyard.
William’s crystal eyes flicked back and forth between the two men, unsure of how to respond. John held his breath.
“Now this young man’s future hangs in the balance of his doctors,” continued Brook, a tear slipping down his cheek. “Let’s all hope and pray Victor Trevor has a full and speedy recovery, and is back in the concertmaster chair very soon. Let’s have a moment of silence for Victor.”
John froze, listening to his own breath rattling in his chest as he looked up into Felipe's eyes. Those big brown irises smoldered with want and lust. The man leaned over to kiss him again, this time showing him how much he was affected by John's self-pleasuring.
“All clean, Mr. Holmes. You should get some rest,” she said, looking down at his arm disapprovingly. “After your long journey and this debacle, you’ll catch an infection if you're not careful.”
Sherlock lowered his mouth to the thin shirt. He felt with his lips until he found a hardened nipple. He licked at it, dampening the cloth with his tongue.
“And this one  - the long one - was handmade for Henry Wood. 24 inches. Can you imagine, handling 24 inches?” Brook dug his hands into the pockets of his impeccable trousers, a smoldering gaze holding Sherlock's attention.
“Nope,” he answered, accidentally flashing the torch’s light directly in Sherlock’s eyes. “I closed it halfway and propped it open with a rock. That’s as closed as it’s gonna get.”
John realized he was getting nowhere with the nobleman. He wasn't used to swallowing bitter truth, like John had learned to over the years.
“Billy,” John continued. “Stay with Mr. Holmes and see him safely to Rosenlaui.” He laid a gold coin in the young man’s hand. “You’ll get two more once he’s safely arrived.”
It was in that moment, unbeknownst to both men at the time, that Sherlock Holmes fell in love with John Watson.
“John Watson, sir,” John replied. “Northumberland Fusiliers 5th regiment under the command of Captain Clinton.”
The machine was cold but low on petrol. Sherlock found no petrol can as he explored the inside of the cave. He snapped a quick photo of the generator with his phone before walking around to the pool of water.
John's own lips curled and a puff of laughter breached his cheeks."Well, you did get something wrong,” he teased.
“John,” he whispered. “I offer everything I have to you. You already have my heart. This school, it can be ours, yours and mine.”
He immediately turned around and went back into the house, frantically searching the drawers and cushions of the home. He made his way into the kitchen where he opened every cabinet. He searched the bathroom, the second bedroom, their bedroom. Nothing.
“Then, he plied you with some strong, sweet alcohol, sucked your cock, shoved some Brown under your nose and fucked you until you passed out.”
Her engagement ring was small yet pretty, and she admired it as she wiped the teapot down and poured in the hot water.
“Moriarty slipped up,” Sherlock said softly. “He made a mistake. He thought the one person that didn’t matter at all to me was the one person who mattered the most. You made it all possible. But you can’t do this again can you.” Sherlock said glanced down at her engagement ring.
John reached for the bottle but he was too late. The last of the whiskey fell away, and Mr. Thomas dropped the empty container next to the growing piles of mail.
John watched as Sherlock relaxed in his chair, his speech a little slurred, his movements slow and melty. He seemed soft and content.
Sherlock glared at him as he twirled the brandy glass on his knee. John reached forward and snatched the snifter. He slammed it on the table between them.
Sherlock was relaxed and pliant and smelled wonderful. John breathed him in and tenderly brushed the damp tendrils from his forehead. “I think I’m going to set up an apothecary.”
A rare exception occurred one cold morning in March. Sherlock convinced John to accompany him to call on a cousin who was interested in donating money to the surgery.  Venturing out into the weather, they quickly determined it was better to take a cab than to catch their death by walking.
John watched the wheels turning, thoughts connecting in Sherlock’s mind as he processed this new information. The bartender slapped another gin down for each man. Sherlock didn’t hesitate, and took a generous swig from his glass.
William tried to speak, but failed. John picked up a glass of water and helped him drink. William sputtered and coughed, and then didn’t stop hacking for the next five minutes.
“Aye, finally we’ll get to fire our rifles at a real target,” said his friend Bill. “Hopefully our inactivity hasn’t atrophied your eyes.”
In Edinburgh, he found a ride into Currie. It was late by the time he reached the pub. John found Mr Thomas’s sister immediately as she looked just like him. She charitably put John up for two days, allowing him to rest, and happily replenished his food basket before sending him on his way.
Several days passed with little excitement. After a particularly grueling surgery, John stepped into the tiny sitting area to rest. He sat on the stool and unbuttoned his shirt, rubbing his scar with his palm and massaging the back of his neck. He needed a bath and a good long walk.
Suddenly a pale glow ahead of them made them both curious. As they approached, light poured from a grate in the passage’s ceiling. All the more curious, the passage abruptly ended a few meters just ahead.
A strange look flashed across his mother’s face. “Of course you should,” she said. “We shall go together.” She paused for a moment, then continued. “Do you think of him often?”
“This is brilliant,” whispered Sherlock, his senses cataloging every detail. He barreled down the hallway to his right.
“It’s not obvious, if you’re worried,” said Sherlock, picking up his violin case. “Your accent is near perfect when speaking English.”
When Sherlock did finally walk in, he found John at the bar drinking tap water and glancing at an old flip phone.
They kissed and touched and explored each other’s lips until John decidedly gripped Sherlock by his narrow waist and laid him back on the bed. He crawled on top of him, his body weight pressing his firm, substantial arousal into the dip of Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock gasped at the pressure, running his arms down John's back and settling his two large hands on two thick and muscled arsecheeks. John’s lips ghosted along Sherlock’s long neck and rested on a sharp collarbone, suckling on alabaster-colored flesh.
Sherlock began to stir as John’s palm glided up to stroke his long elegant neck. John felt the smooth skin first with his fingers then with the back of his hand, appreciating the softness, the warmth.
John felt the waves approaching. His hips thrusted up violently a few more times as he cried out Sherlock's name over and over again, filling him up for the first time and making him his.
John slid his calloused palm over Sherlock’s thin, bare hip. He stirred as John budged up behind him.
He knew the young musician had to have invaluable information about Brook, plus Sherlock wasn’t so sure Victor was as enamored with the professor as he pretended to be. Considering Victor’s sizable secret, the one Sherlock had guessed by chance, the young concertmaster might actually be a victim of blackmail. Plus, Brook was dangerous. It was for those reasons Sherlock finally chose to confront him, walking up beside the Victor as he was preparing for the concert.
John Watson's living space was a mere 300 square feet, but a full-sized couch, huge flat screen, large wooden desk and a double bed were crammed in the space, leaving little room to slide into the tiny kitchen and bathroom which took up the rest of the square flat.
They came upon a large pond that had a small dock built out a few metres into the water. Sherlock stopped his horse and jumped off, removing his bag from the saddle.
“All of the evidence, the clues...I could see it, in my mind, exactly how it had transpired, like some horrible, disgusting play on a stage. Like the murderers had set it up just for me to see.” Sherlock covered his eyes with his hands. “I felt, I felt so...”
“But you do,” John earnestly replied. “You could marry. Have children. Stay away from... temptation.” John again finished his drink too quickly. His face and neck were flushed and he was perspiring.
When the young Muslim didn't respond, John threw open the sitting room door and stormed inside. Ahad sat up, bleary eyed and confused.
John took off running back toward the bridge, leaving the monster to Donovan. He stumbled and fell in the muck, but kept going as the rain poured down his face. He flung himself up the steps to the bridge but slipped, falling head first onto the stone steps and hitting his head, hard.
As of July 14, sorry to anyone who is reading this today. I made a tiny change on something and it completely jacked up the formatting due to some problem with AO3. Completely maddening. I'm working on it.
He stretched his huge arms above his head, and John couldn’t help but notice the expanse of his long, muscled torso, the flat planks of his abdomen that led to a lovely curve of his hip…
He stroked and sucked and licked his way around Felipe’s body until he was a writhing mess of trembling muscle and breath. He easily bent the taller man over the barrel and skillfully spread his legs with two quick taps of his foot.
“Can’t hurt, can it?” he mumbled, as he picked up a small pile of papers from his desk and handed them to William.
The man was responding kindly to Mrs. Hudson. “He’s coming ‘round. See?” He cradled Sherlock’s head. “Sit up, mate?”
He’d watched enough films and pornography to know how to make Molly feel good. It would be an interesting experiment. And it would definitely repay any debt he felt towards her.
The orchestra was large and the players hyperfocused. Sherlock caught a glimpse of Victor in the front row, his violin resting on his knee as he awaited his cue. His eyes searched for Wiggins, but from that angle he could only see half of the brass section.
John couldn’t help but steal one more glance as he left. Sherlock’s smouldering gaze was on his body and flicked up to catch his eyes as he turned to walk out the door.
It was a Sunday morning when he knocked on the open door. John looked up to see the officer in full uniform, his hat tucked under his arm.
John sat quietly by lamplight, writing the last of his story for The Strand while the case was still fresh in his memory. He laid down his pen and yawned into his palm.
Sherlock pulled him up to his feet, letting his tongue explore the inside of John’s hot little mouth.
Being expelled from Cambridge had come as a complete surprise, and it wounded him more than he’d ever care to admit.
John cursed as he hurriedly packed his bag, grabbing a handful of day old bread and cheese to temper his rumbling stomach as he made his way out the door and down the stairs. He was momentarily bewildered at his luck as a cab pulled up and stopped right front of him. Maybe his luck was changing; maybe he was going to make that train after all!
The walk would no doubt take him all day, but he didn’t mind. The landscape was rolling and beautiful, peppered with olive trees and fields of perfectly rowed grapevines. The innkeeper gave him a name and place to stay for the night, and John thanked him and set off down the road.
The main thoroughfare was bustling with people and animals. Men in turbans were selling fruit and grains. Women with covered hair walked by with baskets full of wash or food balanced on top of their heads. Burros carrying burdensome loads stood patiently as their owners talked animatedly in the streets. Dogs slept peacefully in the shade as children played in the arched doorways.
Mrs. Hudson was especially concerned regarding Sherlock's health. She insisted on creating special menu for the ailing patient and called for hot water baths for the both of them. No one argued with her, including John. He felt a lot better after washing the weeks of travel of his poor, tired body. After a few hours, he woke Sherlock and helped him into the bath. He washed his hair, scrubbed him down and dried him off.
Oh gods and oh nos and Holy Mary's echoed through the room. Sherlock continued to glare at Brook. Tells were all over his silly, overwrought performance.
He pressed the heart of Sherlock's palm to his lips and kissed, then buried his face in his lordship's long, lean knuckles.
Anderson took his place next to John in the courtyard, who was standing arrow-straight, making sure his cane was well-hidden by the sides of his coat.
He sat the full bottle in front of John. John looked at it, and then picked it up and took a generous swig. He grimaced as he swallowed it down. He started coughing as the liquid caught his chest on fire.
He barely noticed the perspiration gathering along his neck and backside as he stroked and pressed and made himself feel good. His fantasies felt all too real as he teased himself closer and closer to orgasm. He heard himself moan a little, and he forced his mouth to close, breathing heavily through his nose.
“My lord,” said Roberts. “With all due respect, I cannot have a lame footman. It’s not fair to the others.”
Just then, Sherlock’s fingers ambled passed a piece of loose stone and pushed into an invisible hole in the wall.
He pulled himself out of Sherlock as gently as he could. He glimpsed the bruises on his shoulders and thighs. He suddenly felt deeply ashamed.
The room smelled of varnish, soap and old paper, and John was trying very hard not to sneeze. He held his sleeve to his nose as he huddled alongside William behind the greeter desk at the British Museum of Natural History.
Sherlock inspected the largest coffin, and touched the lid. It slid open easily. He shined his torch’s light inside, just as a strange sound made both young men momentarily stop breathing.
“Oh my God, Sherlock,” he said, his chest expanding but no air filling his lungs. “I can’t...I just….”
He forced himself up and through the window and flopped onto the ledge next to Wiggins, who was already halfway passed out, a ciggie hanging from his lip.
It was the walking contradiction that was John Watson that intrigued Sherlock the most, since most people bored him to death. John seemed kind and clever, but there was an edge to him that Sherlock hadn't quite figured out yet.  Sherlock wondered for a brief moment if he had romanticized their initial meeting to the point their date, now less than 24 hours away, would be a disappointment. But then again, he’d never been on a real date, so he didn't know what to expect. Sebastian had driven him out to the country a few times, but they had never gotten out of the car.
Sherlock cried out, the sound muffled by John’s tongue plundering his mouth. His calloused fingers finally found their way back to Sherlock's poor cock, which was now a deep red and leaking all over his abdomen.
It burned in that familiar way that he knew would taper soon, once Felipe was all the way inside him. He worked his hips until his behind sat flush with Felipe's thighs, and began to roll his body slowly, back and forth.
John was touched at Mycroft’s sentiment. He looked over at Sherlock, who seemed to be struggling with his next words.
Sherlock got up to stoke the fire, and refilled his brandy glass while pouring John his first. “So you aren’t regretting being here with me.”
Sherlock sat up just a bit against the headboard. He reached up and pulled at the string on his nightshirt, letting it unravel in his fingertips.
Sherlock’s eyes were drawn to the one in the middle, the initials J.H.W. stitched in blue in the corner.
Most mornings Sherlock went to the stables. He enjoyed riding all over the estate and always went alone, usually packing a lunch and returning right around tea time.
The doctor shook his head. “I was writing for my readers. I made him more dramatic, exaggerated his tendencies to use logic and reason over emotion.”
But that smile soon diminished as John found his leg growing worse. Over the next week the pain became unbearable as his muscles began to spasm, sometimes catching him off guard while carrying a tray or heavy items on the stairs. The leather straps began to rub his skin raw while the unbendable metal of the brace sometimes forced his knee to lock up.
“Come on, let’s get the hell out of here,” said John, breaking the kiss and again grabbing Sherlock’s hand. They made their way along the corridor in silence until the warm glow from Sherlock’s lit torch signaled that they had finally reached the open cavern.
“Stop, stop,” he begged, as he felt himself close to climax. He forced himself off of Felipe’s lap, and fell ungracefully onto the hard ground. There he lay, catching his breath, and giggled.
Bored, he observed with great detail the items in the library. First edition novels, some scrolls, even family photographs. It was then while scanning the portraits that he made an incredible discovery...one that caused him to pause and reconsider everything he’d ever known about John Watson.
“So,” said Victor, afterward. “You alright?” He gave the young man a knowing look, and lowered his voice. “Professor Brook told me he heard you play the other night.”  Victor looked around to make sure he was out of earshot of the others. “Being concertmaster has its perks.”
“Oh, not expecting that,” he said excitedly. He ran his fingers gently through Sherlock’s curls, then grabbed a handful of his hair and jerked his head back.
This all came none too soon. Sherlock Holmes was narrowing in all his calling - and it was just as outrageous as the man himself.
John’s eyes dipped. “Your lungs. They’re damaged, and some of it will remain permanent. You won’t be the same.”
“How have you been?” Felipe questioned. The words were carefully said, and it was obvious Felipe expected more than a shallow response.
“Holmes - “ he began, as if to explain himself, but the taller man, as usual, guessed what he was about to say.
After his obligatory drink with Mycroft, he chose to spend his evening downstairs. It felt good to catch up with Dimmock and Molly. Both had recently received promotions, and John got the impression that each seemed rather infatuated with the other.
John placed Sherlock's hand on top of his, and together they stroked and thrusted and grinded in unison.
Sherlock left Concert Band defeated. He managed to make his way to the dormitory, pull himself up the stairs and unlock the door to the Sliver, where he immediately dropped his violin, slammed the door shut and collapsed onto his bed.
“-It was in your left coat pocket the entire time,” said Sherlock, his voice low and rumbling in her ear. He pressed her small frame against the kitchen counter. “You were creating a situation that would give you time to be alone with me.”
Two weeks later, a large box arrived for Mr John Watson. He took it up to his room and opened it up. Inside was a metal brace about 30 centimetres long with two leather straps at either end. John immediately placed it around his bad leg and fastened the straps. He pulled trousers down over the top of it, pleased it was unnoticable from the outside. He slid the empty box under his bed and returned to work with a hopeful smile on his face.
He then convinced John to stand, and after wiping him down, dressing him and wrapping him in his coat, took him back to the Sliver, where he helped him shower and put him to bed for the night.
John awoke as the train pulled into the station in Barcelona. He grabbed his simple baggage and made his way into the station and outside to the city, determined to find a nice, clean room for a good long nap.
John got out of the bath and went into the adjoining bedroom. There on the bed were silk pyjamas. He rubbed the fabric between his fingers, then carefully slid them on his body. They were a little long for him, but they still felt glorious against his tired skin. He padded out to the sitting room, where Sherlock sat in similar clothing in front of a serving tray of food.
Sherlock looked around the tiny dorm room, but his eyes finally landed on the bathroom floor. He reached forward and turned off the shower spray.  “Carl Powers was murdered, but no one noticed. No one cared. A young man’s life was taken away, for no reason, and I knew if I had the time and the resources that I could figure out who did it.”
“Carl Powers drowned in my room,” he said suddenly. He looked up at John, who had a mouthful of noodles, half which were still hanging from his lips. He almost choked trying to swallow them down.
As soon as the door was shut and locked behind them, clothes began to hit the floor. Sherlock wore more layers but somehow managed to be fully nude before John, who was, to be fair, gawking longingly at his lover’s impressively thicker frame.
Surely he had. He couldn’t remember offhand, but he was sure that they’d had a conversation about it at some point.
John’s eyes grew wide. “That’s the office the tunnel led too...that’s his office.” Sherlock didn’t confirm nor deny, so John continued. “Don’t play dumb, Sherlock. I saw the nameplate.”
"Here’s the rules," he growled hotly into Sherlock's ear. "I even feel a graze of a tooth, I snap your neck." He forced Sherlock’s head back, his chin in the air, but Sherlock kept his lips pressed together tightly.
“I hate to impose, John. Tell me if I am. But I would be most appreciative if you would continue with your practice here for the time being.”
“Watson, you’re a bloody genius,” remarked Sherlock. He threw the packing straw all over the floor as he pulled out a set of large, leather-bound books with gold lettering.
Sherlock shook his head. “Yess,” he answered honestly, openly, his defenses finally gone. "John, it feels… Oh!”
John stood to move around the chair. He joined arms with Sherlock. They began walking toward the bedroom.
John grunted and lightly gripped Sherlock's jaw with his blunt fingers. Sherlock pulled off with a pop and looked up.
Sherlock, on the other hand, was in his element. His observational skills mixed with his nobleman authority and increasingly good looks opened almost every door to him in the city. Unlike John, who focused solely on his surgical practice, Sherlock infiltrated all sorts of professions and trades, as if trying to find a niche for himself that didn't include being an heir to a earl.
The next day John did as he was told, and sure enough, Mr Frank was waiting for him next to the ice house. He followed the butler without a word into the back of the hall, up a narrow staircase and into a large, cavernous room with marble floors. The space had floor to ceiling windows covered by dark drapes that barely blocked the bright afternoon sunshine. Painting after painting adorned the walls, and beautiful wooden and stone tables held ceramic and glass vases and figurines and busts. Mr. Frank finally stopped about the middle of the room, and nodded with his head toward the large painting on the wall.
John slid his arm underneath Sherlock's knees and stood up, easily carrying him into the next room. He laid him on the bed and settled on top of him, pulling the robe off within seconds. John, still fully clothed, pressed a naked Sherlock into the bed, kissing him and stroking him and pushing his elegant, white knees wide open with his palms.
Victor again laughed without humor. His voice shook when he spoke. “I’m terrified. I haven’t been home in two days,” he said, looking down at his dirty shirt and pants. “I went to Barts because it’s on the other side of town to get my arm treated.  I’ve just been hanging out here since,” he admitted. “Can you help me, Sherlock?”
“I’m really sorry about what happened,” he said. “My new mate doesn’t know his arse from an ankle tap. I’ve never seen a ball go flying like that in my life, let alone nail someone in the head as squarely as it did yours.”
“I know,” John said softly. “London isn’t the best place for him. His lungs are too weak. I’ll need to take him back to Land’s End.”
John flattened up against the rocks and hid. He heard the Afghans shout at the man, but what they were saying he couldn’t quite make out. He pulled his knife from his boot and readied his rifle.
Victor clasped his hands together and sighed. “He probably told you how boring you were. How you were like all the others?” Sherlock shook his head in agreement. “Like I said before, Brook is tough, but he’s brilliant. An incredible teacher, and an amazing composer.”
The rain began to fall right as Lestrade and and two of his men departed from the hospital. Felipe warned them not to dally but to return immediately due to the flash flooding. They set off into the city towards the gates, their khaki uniforms already soaked by the time they’d reached the grand mosque.
John teased him lightly at first, but slowly and gently slipped his middle finger inside. Sherlock began to stroke himself as John varied his caresses.
A moment of silence passed between them, the sound of the city street wafting in through the closed windows of the flat.
John’s face turned crimson as he processed the information. The thought of being alone with Sherlock where no one would know them made his stomach flip. His mind momentarily began to wander into that fantasy, but he then pulled back. His mind was made up. Some things were just simply out of reach.
John reluctantly sat, trying to hide his agitation. He only had an hour to make the train to Alnwick, and he’d have to stop by the flat for his bag before heading there.
John ground his hard length into Felipe’s bare backside. The man groaned and pushed back against him.
Sherlock then spent a good fifteen minutes in his mind palace, standing like a statue on the stairs. Molly leaned patiently against the railing; he looked beautiful deep in thought.
“No, you’ll need to leave, as soon as you are well enough to travel.” John hesitated, but decided it was as good of time as any. “You could always go back to Land’s End.”
“I received a telegram from The Earl of Cornwall, Sherlock's brother,” he said, holding up the paper. “He is requesting I come immediately to the estate, but he doesn't say why.”
John slipped his hand in between their abdomens and gave Sherlock several slick tugs. He continued to stroke him as he made love to him, his hips grinding and trembling as he took his pleasure from the body pinned beneath him.
Sherlock realized what John was saying. “Oh, John,” he said sadly. He brushed his hand over his cheek and pulled him close.
John was reading in the chair next to the bed when he heard Willam’s breathing change. He glanced up from his book to see crystal eyes staring back at him.
Mr Thomas scoffed good-naturedly. “It seems you both enjoy appetite-inducing activities, especially those that take place in the wee hours of the morning.”
"Now," John said matter of factly, leaning in to give Sherlock a long kiss on the lips. "Show me around your fancy music school, yeah?"
John sat down awkwardly. He looked at the tray of food and his stomach betrayed him by growling loudly.
Sherlock nodded in understanding, but felt the familiar feeling of his stomach twisting into knots at the thought of such intimacy. But instead of dwelling on it, he caught John’s lips with his own, and kissed him sweetly, trying to show him with his mouth and lips and tongue how much he wanted to be with him.
John lived the next several months in one small corner of the flat. His routine was simple: Monday thru Thursday, clinic shift, drink, sleep. Friday thru Sunday, sleep, drink, sleep.
“Yes” Sherlock rumbled in John’s ear. “I had them made to the exact specifications of my mass body index. It’s so precise I can’t even wear pants”.
“Welcome everyone,” he said. “I see some familiar faces, I see some new faces. We are here first and foremost to learn from me, from the music, and from each other. To become the master not only of our one instrument, but of becoming one with the orchestra as a whole.” The director raised his baton. “So let’s begin. Scales please. ”
John shook his head, sighing as he held out his hand to help Wiliam over the shrapnel. “It’s not your fault, William. It wasn’t attached to the dresser. It was removed for - it was removed and not put back properly. I should have warned you.”
His breath caught in his throat as he caught a glimpse of Felipe sitting at a table along the window. He wore small spectacles and was reading what looked to be a journal by lamplight. A glass of untouched white wine sat in front of him.
Felipe laughed, a hearty sound that filled the room. He placed a hand on John’s shoulder, much like he did in the dream. “Come, let’s eat while we have the time.”
Mr. Thomas had opened the window and was unceremoniously draining the contents of the liquor bottle onto the street below.
“Mr Thomas…” began John. Tears started falling again from his eyes. He leaned forward and embraced him. “I shall miss you,” he whispered.
Sherlock had begun to leave when he heard it; a beautiful piece of music, full and brazen, pulsing against the stone walls and echoing off the marble-floored hall. The delicate strings, the pulse of the brass, the roar of the cymbal made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He approached a doorway and peered through the tiny window.
“Don’t,” Sherlock whispered, a fresh set of tears flowing from the sides of his eyes. “I don’t deserve it.”
Sherlock immediately went to speak to Victor during the break, but he was nowhere to be found. He checked all over, even the rooftop, but he seemed to have disappeared. Sherlock resigned himself to a smoke outside by the dumpster. A bad feeling came over him, but he decided he was overreacting. Victor would reappear at 3:30pm to play the last solo, and then, Sherlock would invite him out for a drink. Maybe he could convince him to turn Brook over to the police.
The dark-haired man seemed amused at first, then realized Sherlock was not joking. "Excuse me, but I just offered to buy you a drink."
Weeks of travel wore both men down, and by the time they reached Meiringen, a little Swiss village nestled in the Alps, they were both ready for a rest.
Sherlock felt a muscled leg snake around his milky thigh. Hot lips brushed his graceful neck, his defenseless nipple squeezed between a forefinger and thumb.
John took a deep breath and released it, obviously moving on for Sherlock's sake. “7am tomorrow. A young girl named Sam. I met her this morning,” he said, his eyes deep in thought. “We’re repairing a heart defect she was born with. After the surgery, she’ll be able to run and jump and swim like a normal kid.” He smiled to himself. “Sometimes I wonder how I got so lucky, getting to do the things I do.”
****more physical violence. In fact, it just gets worse from here to the end of the story, so please be forewarned regarding triggers for both physical and sexual violence.****
Sherlock, rather pleased with the morbidity of the story, smiled. It encouraged the professor to continue.
“Well, you’ve just got to listen to the greats then. Fritz Kreisler, Perlman. You know, Toscani became “The Maestro” because Viotti threw a baton at his head.” Brook moved in closer, violating Sherlock’s space, his lips centimeters from Sherlock’s ear. “You see what I’m saying?”
He reached down and gave John’s bursting trousers a long, generous stroke with his palm. “I know you are, too.”
“Interesting,” said John, his eyes wandering the room. “I’ve read about apothecaries in garrets. Medicinal herbs stored in places like this to keep the rats and the mildew out.” He stopped to inspect a large pile of petals in a scale, then stopped to read some of the literature left on the table. “It says here they found poppy pods in the rafters years after it was abandoned. They assume it was an medicinal storage unit of some sort, but they can’t be 100% sure.”
John blinked, an errant tear escaping down his cheek that he quickly wiped away. He sniffed and coughed and stood up straight, managing a brief nod.
Felipe shut his mouth in surprise. John took the opportunity to jump up from his chair and look Felipe dead in the eye.
“Oh, it's not useless,” said Brook dangerously. “You just have to use your imagination.” His gaze lingered on Sherlock just long enough to make the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.
They both eased back into the train and found their seat. They both sat in an uncomfortable silence for a good hour before speaking.
The young man played as the maestro hovered over him. Sherlock looked around the room and was shocked to find that everyone was afraid to watch. Only a few players dared to glance out the corner of his or her eye.
Raibert smiled, and looked down at himself. He cocked an eyebrow at Sherlock, and leaned in, whispering. "Aye. But when you're done practicing with the ponies, this stallion is always ready for a ride."
But John knew in his heart that Sherlock awoke, possessing every memory he ever had, that he could not go back to the way things were.
“Stop staring at the door and start at bar 72. Everyone…” His arm came down in a fluid motion and the orchestra sounded off, the brass finally hitting their mark as a grin spread across the director’s face.
Victor visibly relaxed. “Thank you. My history is rather...colorful. And best left in the past. I’m not exactly what I appear to be.”
John then looked up, shooting a look that could maim at Anderson. “I’m not sure what you’re babbling on about, but I can assure you that I am not going to South Africa.”
Brook cleared his throat and stepped heavily onto the podium. He observed the orchestra, looking thoroughly bored.
It was all quite simple, really. John didn’t want to deal with it. With him. Sherlock had been mourned and buried and John had moved on. William was nothing but an inconvenience. A living, breathing, terrible inconvenience.
“What?” John looked down at the cigarette in his hand. He handed it to Sherlock who eagerly took it.
John pulled off of his length, panting, his chest flush all the way to his abdomen. Sherlock could see the outline of the doctor’s arousal trying to burst out of his tight trousers.
John got up and sat down next to him, leaning back against the tree trunk. Felipe passed him the bottle, and John took a generous sip.
Sherlock groaned obscenely as the pressure built inside him. He pulled John even tighter against him, and it was then he lost control. He was suddenly gone - a momentary loss of his surroundings, a white light, bucking and writhing under his partner’s weight, gripping the young medical student’s ass so roughly the tips of his fingers left dents in the fabric of his jeans. When he finally fell back to reality, and realized what had happened, the dampness in his pants, his erratic breathing - he was mortified.
John’s mouth expertly worked his prick up and down as he gently fucked the younger man's tight center with care. Sherlock lost his breath as the fingers brushed against an intimate place deep inside of him, causing fireworks in his cock and pleasure to radiate through his arse and thighs.
Brook slowly shook his head. “No you didn’t.” He approached Sherlock and placed his hands on his thin shoulders. “Sherlock, stop fighting this. You’re in.”
Stefan followed suit, casually sliding in beside him, blocking John. “I have a personal carriage. I am happy to take you home,” he whispered in heavily accented English.
Sherlock put down his plain lo mein and grabbed his phone. “Carl Powers,” he repeated, shoving the phone in John’s face.
He crawled on top of Sherlock, who was sitting up, a looked of bewilderment on his face. He wiped Sherlock’s face, neck and chest with the flannel, then threw it on the nightstand.
He ran back to the ward, weaving through the patient-filled cots to his surgical unit. He tore open the cabinets, searching for medicine.
"As it should," said Sherlock, pulling him inside and closing the door. He unhooked his Belstaff from the coat rack and wrapped it around John, rubbing his shoulders vigorously in an attempt to warm him.
“One he will not be able to resist,” the detective said, leaning back against the carriage’s seat. “He’s the most intelligent criminal I’ve ever encountered . I dare say he is at times more clever than even I. But I know him. And he won’t be able to resist my invitation.”
John rubbed the tip of his cock against that plump lower lip, before pushing himself into that warm, open mouth.
John looked down. He was standing on his own, with no pain. He looked back up at Sherlock, his eyes wide in disbelief. Sherlock smiled at him, and without a word went back up the stairs.
“I respectfully request that I be called William, instead of Sherlock,” he said softly. “It is my name, my first name. I feel this is reasonable to ask of you all."
“Why?” asked John, though he’d already grabbed his scarf as Sherlock helped him with his coat. He positioned the bowler on top of his blonde head and waited for an answer.
John’s expression remained stoic, though Sherlock detected a flicker of vulnerability underneath. He placed the coffee cup and bun on the table in front of him.
A Watson family secret is revealed.  Neon green headphones make everyone’s day, sort of. John and Sherlock christen the crime scene.
“Yes, of course,” mumbled John. “Just a little tired. Out of practice, I guess.” He yawned and ran his palm over his face.
Ten years they had been in London, living in a cozy little flat together with Mrs. Hudson and her delicious biscuits and coffee. John was living a life he thought not possible. He had his practice and he was writing again, and the love of his life, his brilliant, striking Sherlock, second son of an Earl and the most exciting, perplexing, infuriating man he’d ever known, had been by his side the entire time.
"-Paulo killed Sven's wife. And both unaware of each other's plan," John gaped. He slammed his empty glass on the tiny kitchen counter. "Amazing, Sherlock. Absolutely brilliant."
His blond hair has been shaved down close to his head. He’s dressed in a dark suit with a bright white collared Oxford, his old duffel bag draped over one shoulder.
He wiped the sweat from his brow as he felt a familiar, ominous presence in the room. He turned to find the locked door wide open with Brook in the doorway, tapping a large, wooden baton against his palm.
He laid there for a moment, relishing the quiet and the soft sheets, until he smelled smoke coming from the open window above.
John didn’t even try to act indignant by Donovan’s seemingly callous remark. They were both practical men, and they were both thinking the exact same thing.
The ride back to Baker Street was done in silence. By the time the men got Willam home and into bed, it was apparent the injured man was in an extremely precarious state.
Sherlock felt John’s hands on the back of his thighs, holding him steady as his stubbled jaw brushed against Sherlock’s exposed arse.
“Yes,” said Brook. “Even the bulb. One continuous piece, smoothed and molded. Though one could never use it for conducting. It’s too heavy.” Brook took the baton back from Sherlock, and caressed it tenderly. “It’s my favorite,” whispered Brook, as he gently gripped the baton and ran his fist slowly up and down from the tip to the bulb, up and down. He looked up at Sherlock, his eyes dancing.
Sherlock stepped carefully onto the wide, three tiered staircase that led up to the large main doors. The sweet sound of the violins swelling in his ears made the noisy students swarming around him tolerable. He was about to pull open one of the main doors when a sudden movement behind an overgrown set of bushes along the building gave him pause. Sherlock slowed and discreetly peered around the landscaping.
Well-versed in techniques to intimidate. Controlled approval, fear, verbal abuse, criticism, possible isolation and activity pedagogics -
“His fever’s gone,” said John. “You should leave knowing he should recover. I just wish he’d bloody wake up.”
Sherlock nodded. Brooks clapped, when out of nerves, Sherlock accidentally struck the strings early.
"Mm," answered Sherlock. "And then they would seal the stump with tar or boiling oil." He stuffed his hands in his trousers, his lithe frame bending and stretching as he took in the surrounding operating theater. "Most still perished. All that pain, for nothing."
The rain, the thunder, the rush of the water all fell away. He could only hear the beating of his heart.
John wiped his sweaty face with his elbow, as his hands were dirty. He made himself look directly at Felipe as he spoke.
Within moments, the two men were hoisted up, suspended in mid air over the stormy waters of the reservoir. John held on to William with all his strength, and when they reached the top and collapsed together onto the bridge, John cried out:
Sherlock’s head fell back against the sofa as John’s lips wrapped around the tip and began to suck. He licked and sucked and held gently onto the base of his shaft and stroked it up and down like he did his own. He was embarrassed at first of the noises he was making, but Sherlock didn't seem to mind, so he licked and sucked some more.
John’s eyes searched Sherlock’s. “I know there’s something you’re not telling me,” John said. “I wish you’d trust me enough to let me in on it.” Sherlock fed him the rest of egg roll, and Sherlock kissed his lips as he chewed.
The students laid Felipe on the operating table because it was the only free bed besides their own cots. Blood ran between the Spaniard’s fingers as he pressed on the wound. He tried to speak, but it caused pain to radiate up through his neck and into his head.
Felipe seemed relieved once John told him William had stirred. The two men looked at his sputum again under the microscope, and both men concluded his condition had turned. He was going to live.
John barely stifled a groan. He hesitated just for a moment, then grabbed the back of Sherlock’s head and pulled him down for a kiss. The men stripped off the rest of their clothing and fell into the bed, skin sliding against skin.
He was grateful when he finally reached the Inn. He didn’t deter for one moment and pushed through the main door into the lobby, collapsing a bit onto the counter where Peter was writing in his ledger.
He found a small bed and breakfast on the outskirts of Barcelona and slept hard for the rest of the night. The next morning, he ate breakfast with the owner who gave him directions west to the tiny village.
One of the maids led them up three flights of stairs to the servant's quarters, where at the end of a narrow hallway was a room just big enough for two beds and a wash basin. A window overlooking the east courtyard made the room cheerful, and John happily jumped on one of the beds and smiled at his mother.
Felipe laid down next to him, naked. He pulled John close and kissed him while unbuttoning his shirt. He slipped his trousers off and pulled him on top of him. They explored and melded together, being as loud as they wanted since no one could hear them anyway.
John stroked his chest and hips slowly and softly, waking him. His kissed the back of his neck and nuzzled his curls.
“For now, yes. I’ve convinced my father to try several new grapes this year, so I’ll go back in a few months.”
The disappearing trail of blood followed almost perfectly with the position of the body in the rocks. When John reached the man, the trail stopped. He fell to his knees, out of breath, dropping the lantern into the mud.
So when John left England for the third time in his life, it was to head south instead of east. The two-day ride to Plymouth connected them with a steam ship that sailed around France to the Bay of Biscay where they debarked in Bilbao, Spain. A train took them to Madrid and then on to Seville, where Sherlock hired a driver for transport to Cadiz. From there, they boarded a small boat and docked in Tangier, Morocco.
Felipe led John away from the crowds as they walked home, the path lit only by moonlight. Leaving the celebration early guaranteed them some much needed time alone. The Spaniard slipped his hand into John's as they meandered along the path, enjoying the cool evening and privacy.
Autumn had just settled in, and the gardens bloomed in rusty orange and bright yellow. A path led through green bushes and withering perennials to a group of small, white structures that looked like simple rectangular wooden boxes. The boxes immediately caught William’s eye, and he approached them with a demeanor of disbelief and reverence. John followed behind, hoping for the man’s approval.
It was then John realised though his drunken haze that he felt more than friendship towards Sherlock. He wanted those large, elegant hands running through his hair. He wanted those pale, pink lips pressed to his forehead.
Sherlock, shocked, wasn't sure what to do. John wasn't fighting back; in fact, by his disposition he seemed to be giving in to the giant's affections. He instead asked the obvious:
Sherlock also seemed just as fascinated with John. He was quick to include him in all of his activities, including his teaching. He would call Watson “his assistant” in front of the boys and girls as he did experiments that made them ooh and ahh. He taught them biology and chemistry and even German, since the students had full access to the books during class.
He made his way down the rows and rows of small practice rooms. A skinny glass window was on each wooden door covered by a privacy shade from the inside. He glanced side to side, sometimes catching glimpses of the musicians inside the tiny rooms when a shade had been opened or accidentally knocked crooked. Sherlock hoped to find an open room that faced the courtyard, but the only one vacant was at the end in a corner near the back door.
So much heat, tongue applying pressure in all the right places, so wet. John released within seconds into Felipe's mouth, his hips bucking helplessly into his generous, firm lips.
“Read it,” demanded Sherlock. John glanced at the small, thin book in his hand. “Keep it hidden, but read it.”
“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said sadly. “Unbeknownst to me, Victor Trevor suffered a serious accident yesterday at the Royal Concert Hall while awaiting our second performance.”
Lestrade nodded. “Jean Pierre. He said Sherlock showed up at the schoolhouse a few days ago. He passed out in the doorway with this pinned to his collar.”
When he’d first arrived home after the fall, he tried to enter their bedroom. He opened the door, and the smell of Sherlock’s lavender sachets made his knees give out. Miss Turner found him doubled over on the hardwood floor. She helped him up and sat him down in the parlour and gave him a good stiff drink. He accepted it gratefully and drank it down in a few gulps.
Brooks slammed the door shut again as Sherlock threw his bow down on the music stand and collapsed heavily into his chair.
“Dr. Watson, Mr. Holmes,” she said kindly. “Welcome home. With your permission, I’d like to start unpacking your things. Mr. Holmes, you will be taking the front bedroom, and Mr. Watson, the back?
It had been one month to the day since he’d left. At this point, John knew there was a chance Sherlock was no longer alive.
He had chastised William for manipulating him, but hadn’t he done the same? His idea that the former detective didn’t have to recall the memories of his previous life in order to be happy was sound in theory, but were his own intentions pure? If those memories stayed buried, did John’s responsibility end there?
“We’ve monitored the reservoir,” he said. “So far, only one sighting, not confirmed.” He placed his glass carefully on the mantle. “You don't think…”
“I meant to ask, who was the woman on horseback with the giant Jesus?” he asked. “She kept giving me strange looks all evening.”
John finally pulled down his pyjama bottoms. His tongue licked and tasted the tip of the organ. John moaned with pleasure as he licked again.
He held the note over his heart and wept, until his eyes grew heavy and he fell into a fitful sleep.
“No, it would be rather...cumbersome,” answered Sherlock. He knew Brook was enjoying the flush appearing on his cheeks from the blatant innuendo.
John visibly shook as he shut the door, his back heavy against the old bulwark. His knees gave way as he slid to the floor.
“Everything is in order, Lord Holmes,” said the woman. “Your meals will be delivered as requested at 8am every morning in the kitchen. Your valet is welcome to put any items you would like serviced outside the back door. And your bath is ready.”
Their heated gaze gave way to a sudden, deep moan as John licked and sucked the man's lips. He undid the man's belt and trousers and dropped to his knees.
Sherlock nodded. John helped him sit up and held the bowl to his lips. He drank it down without hesitation. John reached up and tenderly stroked the back of his head. Sherlock sighed in pleasure, dropping his head to rest on John’s shoulder.
Her tone brought him to his senses. “No m’lady,” he said, his voice choked. He bowed slightly and then turned and walked out the door.
Felipe turned at looked him with eyes full of exhaustion. “Nothing,” he said, trying to smile but failing. “Just tired is all.”
Yes, sorrow remained, but even his anger had dissipated. It was then he knew he could never go back.
John huffed out a nervous laugh. “I don’t want to do anything involving that place.” He shifted uncomfortably. “I don’t know if I can do anything.”
“That’s it, that’s how you’d work those gorgeous hips,” John whispered, releasing his wrists, bringing one to his lips and kissing it tenderly.
He turned to the Earl, searching for some indication of a prank, a welcome home joke done in poor taste, something to explain what he was seeing plain as day out that window.
Sherlock’s eyes skimmed over John Watson’s wide-necked jumper thrown over his sweaty shirt clinging to his sturdy shoulders, his powerful thighs filling out the tight rugby shorts, a glimpse of skin on his flat abdomen as he bended forward to tie his shoelace. Sherlock chuckled. “Actually, he is a pretenious arsehole. Excellent observation.”
William sat down his tea cup and walked over to the large binder he’d placed back on the bookshelf some weeks before. He flipped through the pages and began to read aloud:
Felipe stroked John's shoulders as he watched him play with his body, every few moments bringing him close for long, wet kisses, then head falling back against the wall as his sex was worked thoroughly by his surgeon’s expert hands. He released within minutes of John’s ministrations, shaking violently as his muscles spasmed, holding onto and staring at John like he was the most precious thing in the world.
“I knew I liked blokes,” John said thoughtfully. “I didn’t want my mum to know I was poof, especially since dad had died and we were struggling. Didn't want to lay that on her too, you know? And I truly thought it would all go away if I fucked enough girls.”
Felipe collapsed back into the bed, taking a come-soaked John with him. The headboard slammed against the wall, leaving a dent in the wood.
“I shall endeavor to rebuild my life. I’m content to do so without morphine, or cocaine, or brandy. I do not wish, however, to do it without you.”
John smiled. “Aye, I learned that in service.” Felipe shot him a curious look. “I was a footman for a marquess before joining the army,” he explained.
"Idiot!" he hisses, as his fist strikes his temple in rage. After several self-berating moments, he manages to rally, his bony elbows in his shirtsleeves protruding like pencils as he packs up his violin.
“Then what?”said John, growing impatient. “Sherlock, I can’t protect you if I don’t know what’s going on.”
John’s domination of his aching, sex-starved body ironically filled Sherlock with a sense of freedom.
“William’s recovery will be arduous,” said Felipe. “You know as well as I do he may never return to full health.”
“What did I say?” he growled, pushing both of Sherlock's arms above his curly head and pinning his wrists firmly into the grass.
John trudged forward, following spatters closely with his lantern. He heard the water splashing against the boards below him as the wind blew. The railings along the bridge were but rope strewn on either end, with a fastener and loop on a wooden pole every six feet.
Raibert set another drink in front of Sherlock, which he gladly put to his lips. "What happened between you two?"
So he stayed there and cried softly into his sleeve, watching as the shadows became long and the sun lowered behind Land’s End in the distance, enduring his final moments of mourning for the man called Sherlock Holmes.
“Hello boys,” she said, her voice cracking with age. “It’ll be five quid for the self tour. 10 for the guided.”
“I know about your little operation underground,” Sherlock threatened. “I bet even Scotland Yard wouldn’t botch up such an open and shut case. Now tell me where Victor is.”
It was very late, so Sherlock expected the fourth floor to be deserted. The automatic lights flickered on as they entered through the glass doors. Sherlock showed John the practice rooms and the view of the gardens, the room he normally practiced in near the back door, then walked him to the opposite end of the floor to the group practice rooms.
Both were unusually silent during the ride home. Once back in the room, Sherlock poured two brandies and handed one to John. John took it with shaking fingers.
The Inspector gathered it up and handed it to the doctor. In turn, Donovan helped John up the stairs, and they met Felipe on the bridge near the guardhouse entrance.
“Yes,” said John, gladly accepting another tumbler full of gin from the barmaid. “A consulting detective. The only one in the world.”
William slumped. “I think about her everyday. Hanging in that cell from the hem of her torn dress.” He looked up at John, his eyes full of pain. “She hadn’t done anything wrong. I thought I was clever, discovering she was having an affair with the guard who gave that
“John I know it may sound foolish...no it definitely sounds foolish, a man of my age asking you, for you too-” his voice quivered.
One week melted into two, and the third week, all hell broke loose. The hospital was overrun with patients. Even the floors were filled with those suffering from the sickness. John kept watch on those progressing into the third stage. In the beginning, he was in surgery every few days, but now he was averaging one every 18-24 hours. Perforated bowels mostly. Some were lucky and had already pulled through. Those patients were sent home with strict instructions on what to eat and drink. Most, though, were still in the thick of it, and more were pouring in.
“Watson,” whispered Sherlock. He stood there helplessly, wishing his valet would say something, even if it were in anger.
“Yes, I know,” he said impatiently. “But was your performance lacking? Did she give you a reason other than your mother’s passing?”
“Her back is broken,” he said sadly. He pulled out a small bottle and filled a syringe. He stuck it carefully into his patient’s ribs.
He poured himself another drink. “The Earl of Cornwall has informed me that Mr. Holmes wished that I inherit this flat.”
John nodded his head. Fresh tears spilled out of his eyes. “Sam…” he said between sobs. “She’s dead. And it’s all my fault.”  John’s eyes search his own for anything to stop the pain, to relieve him of the guilt.
John Watson had fallen face down onto the cold, hard ground in between Anderson and Dimmock. His cane lay haphazardly in the middle of the Courtyard.
But the hollow threat had backfired. Sherlock hadn’t known about the Spaniard. Dr. Felipe Canales was everything John ever wanted to be and more.
An officer stepped forward and called for the soldiers to lower their weapons. He approached Felipe and John carefully, eyeing the pistol in John’s hand.
The passageway was fairly straight, but narrow enough one had to follow the other. John brought up the rear, glancing back often to make sure they weren’t being followed.
John went downstairs and greeted the service staff. All were happy to see him with the exception of Anderson, who scowled and disappeared when he saw John enter.
“Not sure, but St. Petersburg most likely,” answered Sherlock. He paused, then said, “I accidentally intercepted a letter from his wife. She was letting him know that his four children were doing well and that she had become pregnant during his furlough.”
The weather had been bloody awful for a week, with temperatures just above freezing and the clouds bringing nothing but rain and sleet. Everyone was on edge with a raging case of cabin fever, including the director, who was within a breath of tearing his hair out.
John grinned at Sherlock's reaction. He stopped for a moment and leaned forward, kissing him deeply and without preamble all over his lips, cheeks and neck, then returned to stroking him, fucking him with his finger.
John didn’t look convinced. "If you're not going to tell me what's really going on, at least promise you won't go down there alone."
Sherlock turned over onto his back and pulled John down to him, nestling him between his spread legs. He held onto John’s behind as he slowly began to rock his hips. Their arousals, trapped between their bellies, pressed and easily slid against each other.
“He sells fresh honey to all the bakeries in a three block radius. I’ve been studying bees for quite some time, ever since…” William stopped himself, as if forcing himself to stop rambling and make a proper point. “I think I can double his honey output just by configuring the placement of the hives. You see, the bees need access to the plants in the park, so -“
He knew meeting Felipe had changed everything. John had been living deep in denial regarding Sherlock's addiction. He was desperate to hold on to his new found freedom, and Sherlock was determined to keep the tragedy in South Africa buried deep. In the end, both men were responsible for the destruction of their relationship.
Sherlock glanced at Molly and grinned. “Yes. Friend.” His eyes flickered down her body for just a moment, and then in a split second he was out the door.
John looked back up and committed as much detail of the animal to memory, from its long tail to its strange hooves to its bushy neck. Its long face and lips reminded him of Mr Thomas, but he felt it would be rude to say so.
Sherlock stood in front of the fireplace, slowly peeling out of his wet clothes. John could tell something was wrong. His shoulders were slumped and he seemed weary.
John shook his head. “No. Peter, if he fell, he’ll freeze to death if we don’t find him. We can’t leave.”
He pulled John's hand away as he covered the smaller man’s body with his own. His lips caressed along John's jaw as he held him close.
John was lost in the admiration of Sherlock’s body when nimble fingers began unbuttoning his pyjama bottoms. John immediately backed away.
“Take the stairs up to the garret. Watch your step,” then looking at Sherlock added. “And your head.”
Again, Sherlock swallowed John's cock, and once again, Sherlock gagged. John quickly pulled out as Sherlock gasped for air. Tears streamed down Sherlock's cheeks as he wiped saliva from his chin. He gazed up at John feeling powerful and sexy, relishing the pressure of his own prick now thick and heavy and pressed against his fly.
“Wait,” he said. He pulled a satchel from the camel’s saddle. He slid open the pouch and discreetly revealed a bottle of liquor.
“So you are,” said Mycroft, turning to the pale and rather thin man at his side. “How are you feeling?”
Felipe kissed him and stroked his chest. His fingers lingered over John's bad shoulder, inspecting the mangled tissue. They settled into each other's arms, the safety of the cot serving as a brief respite from the chaos outside the tiny sitting room. They kissed lazily off and on, resting and enjoying each others soft touches and caresses.
His lips continued to lavish tender licks until Sherlock's body was supple and relaxed. John ended with a long, deep kiss, and tenderly placed his fingers back inside of him. He licked his way back to up to Sherlock’s sex laying red and leaking on his belly, and sucked him and sucked him until he was a writhing mess of glistening pecs and whimpering lips.
A short ride later and they exited the train and bounded up the stairs at London Bridge station. Above ground the wind was sharp but the sun was warm, and The Shard, a massive crystal stalagmite jutting from the earth, glistened brightly in the sunshine. Sherlock walked quickly, but John slipped in next to him, both settling into a comfortable stride as they walked a few more blocks, until they came to an old brick church with a tiny sign hanging above an ancient door that read The Olde Operating Theatre Museum and Herb Garret.
John awoke with the sun halfway in the sky. It was the latest he’d ever slept without being ill. He jumped out of bed and found Sherlock in his robe reading the paper and drinking tea.
“No, I mean it. I could see through it. I could see you,” he said adamantly, his voice reflecting reverence and awe. “You were a soldier that came home from war, but no one was there to take care of you, not like we were able to care for my father. You saved his life but you yourself suffered. Greatly. I could see the lines of starvation in your face, how your leg shamed you. You were in such pain.”
John then took Sherlock’s hands in his own and kissed them, managing a weary smile.  He led Sherlock back to the bed where he wrapped them both up in the blanket and they laid together, just breathing together and getting warm again. Eventually they began nuzzling and kissing, forcing the ominous presence of Richard Brook out of their minds. John lifted Sherlock's chin gently with his finger.
Sherlock’s body quivered in his mouth and in his hands. His translucent eyes were heavy-lidded and raw, his red lips wet and parted as his fingers opened and closed in the soft sofa cushions. John locked his deep blue eyes with his lordship’s as he continued to suck and lick gently, his technique messy and uneven. Sherlock, grateful to feel John's lips in any capacity, squirmed underneath him.
Mycroft nodded. “Roberts is right. I feel for Watson, but we do not have an open position for which he is suitable.”
Sherlock’s expression went from excitement to guilt-ridden. His eyelids fluttered as he began to speak.
Sherlock heard himself whimper as John kissed him, his partner delicately parting his lips with a gentle tongue. He reveled in the sensation of John’s hand slipping up his back and gently rubbing his neck, then fingering his dark curls. Sherlock sighed and squirmed in the young man’s arms, kissing him back and holding on to him tightly.
John groaned at the contact.  His entire body felt as if it were on fire. He dropped the wine bottle and wrapped around Felipe’s thick neck with both hands, deepening the kiss.
John threw open the door to the guest bedroom. He yanked out his bag and began stuffing it with clothes.
They stared at each other for a long moment, engaged in a battle of wills. John finally looked away.
“By the end of the week,” answered Anderson, staring at John, who was still buried in his bowl. “His lordship said they’ll be gone for months.”
