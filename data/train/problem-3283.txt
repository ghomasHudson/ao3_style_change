Maybe Sam had been biting his tongue on this conversation for a long time. Dean certainly had. He had told himself they never had to discuss it. He was happy enough with women, he never had to deal with the bisexual elephant in the room. Of course, he hadn’t ever considered that Cas might want him back, so it was easy enough for him to just shove it away. To deny it until that denial felt like honesty. As he had been for the past twelve years.
Dean sighs. He thinks he was perfectly clear, but he supposes the day a Winchester opts for the less self-loathing interpretation will be the day hell freezes over.
It’s Sam who moves first. He gets to his feet, walks tentatively towards Dean, the silence hanging heavy between them.
It’s another few weeks before Cas decides he can’t just let it drop. If not for Sam’s sake, then for Dean’s too. He figures, sure, Sam will probably hate him at first, but hey, if Cas is Sam’s brother too, then that sort of comes with the package anyway.
Still, he watched as they kissed. Watched as something slow and sweet turned into something heated and burning. He watched Cas push Not-Dean back onto the bed and climb on top of him before he pushed further back into the closet, sitting with his eyes wide open and facing determinedly away from where they were.
He has no interest in seeing the other two, particularly not after having Lucifer inside his vessel, but he figures if they’re useful, that’s the most he can hope for.
Cas couldn’t stop it, a grin pulled across his face. “Yeah. Yeah, I think we could arrange that. I’m sure Sam will help. Sam?”
He brought one hand up to rest against Castiel’s cheek as he kissed him. It wasn’t some perfect, magical moment. Miracle kicked Dean in the stomach and he spluttered, and they both pulled back laughing.
Castiel felt like he might’ve actually begun to glow with pride. If Dean had internalised what he said, if he believed on any level that he was the good man Cas thought he was and not a monster, then Cas had done his job. Dean was good, and loving and selfless. He wasn’t always the best with his feelings, but he was good. He deserved to know that. He deserved to feel like he was worth saving.
That it was overwhelming to be carried like this, to need Sam and Cas just to be able to get into his own home. There were steps all around the place. Unless they could fix it all, Dean would continue to be reliant on them.
Was Cas meant to be making heads or tails of this? Because he wasn’t. He just blinked at Dean, waiting for him to tie this back to what happened in some way, tie it back to them needing to talk.
“I’ll text her myself, Sam. Get her to come here. I’m not above it…” He paused, “Did you even tell her? Or did you just drop off the map?”
“That’s… really sweet, Jo, and I hate to disappoint, but there’s nothing going on. We’re just… I don’t know, we just… get along well, like you said.”
Honestly, Dean isn’t sure he wants to know. He’s allowed himself to very briefly consider the possibility that he does it out of love, rebels out of love, but he’s spent too long hoping for something that won’t happen-- and frankly, hearing Chuck confirm that it’s Dean that ‘broke’ Cas only makes his own self-hatred worse.
The second Chuck’s eyes land on him, Cas can feel it. The slight smirk on his face, the knowing look. He knows-- he knows what happened. How they got rid of Billie, what Dean said. He knows and he’s looking at Cas with that smug expression. He’s happy about this. Maybe this is his writer's ending. Sam’s brother, Jack’s father, the love of Cas’ life. Dean means too much to them all and he knows it. To let them all fade into nothing riddled with guilt and helplessness, with no family, no friends, and no one left to save.
He wasn’t sure when Rowena had become an actual ally. A no holes barred, would help them for nothing ally, but she was. A friend even. Dean actually cared about her too. As he had grown to care about Crowley. It was weird, and Dean sort of resented it, but there team also had an angel and a nephilim, so he figured… eh, friends in high and low places.
“Could you have told me…?” Cas asks quietly, and the three of them break out into laughter. It sounds forced, and sad and emotional, like a smile at a funeral, but what else can they do? Cas sure as hell didn’t know before now, but he’s glad he does. He’s not sure if it would be more painful to lose Dean forever without knowing, or if the knowing is worse.
Dean isn’t sure he has the power to convince someone to betray their cosmic purpose, and he’s not sure he’d want to.
Because Dean’s lips were surprisingly soft, and his skin seemed to shiver where he felt Dean’s hands on his face. How the hell had he not just done this before? Twelve years of sneaking glances at Dean, twelve years of watching him. Twelve years of wishing and hoping and he wondered if he actually was still in the Empty and was just dreaming somehow.
“You don’t have to,” Cas cut in, a frown on his face, afraid to hear it. Afraid of what it would mean to hear it. Afraid of how it would break his heart. “You don’t have to say anything, it’s… it’s fine.”
He knows Dean even better now, misses him already, for all that he is and isn’t. Dean is an awful communicator. He makes constant juvenile jokes. He can be harsh and snippy and overly emotional at times. He can be superior. He can be reckless and thoughtless. But Dean is also hilarious and sincere and loyal and moralistic and genuinely, inherently kind. He always has been. He’s done nothing but try his best since Cas met him.
It felt like a lot of time passed before something happened. He kept an eye on Dean, as was his way, the Angel watching over him since he had first met him.
He told them what he could. What he was able. Dean made a deal with the Empty -- Jack knew that part -- he sacrificed himself for Cas. No one was surprised. This was what Dean did. What he had always done.
He thought back to the kid he was at twenty-six, the one who had stood outside Sam’s room for hours out of fear of rejection, the one who had had no one else in the world, but who hid all that insecurity behind bravado and cocky smiles. He thought about the man he had been at thirty, trying to stop an apocalypse and carrying the weight of the entire world on his shoulders. The man he was at thirty-five, still blaming himself for every bad thing, every lost life, every apocalypse. He thought about himself even only a few months before. The man willing to pull a gun on his own brother for a chance at freedom. The man who felt it was always his duty to protect someone else. To do the right thing. He was in his forties now, and had died more times than anyone -- besides maybe Sam -- could count. Castiel had once told Dean that he didn’t think he deserved to be saved. The angels had told him he had poisoned Castiel, corrupted him.
“You’re right.” He says slowly, but doesn’t move. Instead, he asks another question he needs to know the answer to. “Did he say whether he…?”
If this was how his freedom had to end, so be it. Dean didn’t want it to end like this, he didn’t want this to be his legacy, but he figured there was some kind of poetry to the whole thing.
Dean smiled a little, “You say that as if this won’t just go in a cyclical fashion forever. As if you, me and Sam won’t just live in a bubble of each blaming ourselves for each other, just like we always have.” He waited a moment, as if trying to figure out how to proceed with the conversation. “They’ve been teachin’ me how to use the wheelchair.”
at, and shit changed. I realised that I couldn’t let my Dad ruin my entire life. Neither Sam nor I have spoken to him since Sam was eighteen and I was twenty-two.”
There was only one more room down this side of the hall, and when Dean pushed the door quietly open, he saw… what appeared to be a master bedroom. Totally normal. Nothing out of the ordinary. Except, of course, for the big canvas picture of Dean and Cas hanging above the bed. Both wearing tuxes, Dean was tipped back off his feet, dipped by Cas, who held him with an arm around his back and another holding one of his hands. They were kissing, Cas leaning down over Dean, and both looked like they were smiling despite the kiss.
“She had a way of calling him on his shit, which, as you all know, we Winchester brothers need sometimes. Anyway, I don’t want to go on for too long, I’m not much for speeches and it’s not really appropriate to do a Braveheart speech here, so I’ll keep it short and sweet.”
There was little in the universe that Castiel loved more than Jack. He had done everything he could to protect the boy, to keep him safe and stable and alright. He would have been willing to give up anything for him, which was why he had made the deal with the Empty to begin with.
“I suspected.” Sam manages, shaking his head, frowning at the table. “If only he’d said something sooner…”
Once Cas got up to go to the bathroom, Dean quietly let himself out, pacing nervously as he waited for Cas to return, waited to tentatively try to pull him out of this. Dean had realised on his own, but things seemed to be different for Cas. Maybe it was a different strain of djinn. Maybe it was different because Cas was an angel.
glad.” Cas finally answered in a sort of half-sigh, his eyes resolutely shut. His voice was scrubbed rough and smoky by fatigue and distraction, and it ignited merciless sparks of delight along Dean’s spine.
“Jesus Christ, Cas...” Dean gasped in barely-contained horror, “Hey look at me! Cas?! Open your eyes, dammit!”
,” Cas mutters somberly. “It’s rather annoying actually. Though if you’d prefer doing housework, I am not opposed. I would be happy to help; I can tend to them later.”
It’s only then that Dean realizes he’s shaking with relief, sudden and irrational as it might be, and that tears have erupted. They scorch his cheeks as they slither towards the water. Cas meets them with his lips and soothes them back into his skin before he trails lower.
He knelt down to Cas’ eye-level. It was his turn to violate the personal bubble commandment, and he ducked through the wall of feathers to get to Cas’ closed-off face. From this new vantage, it was instantly obvious why the angel wasn’t in a talking mood anymore. Namely, he was covered in sweat, strong jaw locked tight, while tiny fault-lines of creepy luminescent blue spidered up his neck, threatening to spill onto his face. He looked about ready to shatter from the inside out, into a thousand glowing angel-puzzle pieces. Dean couldn’t stop himself from framing Cas’ face with his hands, as though his mere mortal grasp might hold him together.
“Fuck me, that feels nice…” Dean eventually babbled against Castiel’s thigh, while strong hands kneaded at the taught cords of his neck.
Dean thinks he manages some noise of agreement, but it’s a softly stuttered breath in a gale. He can do little else but concede while his every facade crackles, bright and sudden.
Shit, hadn’t Dean just fixed this? Or was shredding feathers an international declaration of flying accountant war?
He’s happy of course. Ecstatic really, because his brother’s ears are tinged pink and Cas seems to be grinning the best he can while his lips are otherwise engaged, and goddamnit, Sam is man enough to admit that it’s all pretty fucking adorable.
, actually,” Cas corrected him. “It’s a collection of testimonial essays about the history of baking as both a result and expression of culture.”
A familiar flapping sound, like laundry hung out to dry in a light breeze, draws his attention from the right.
Dean had come to learn that timeless a creature as he was, Cas spent much of his time unnervingly motionless, simply waiting, watching as the Earth spun, pondering millions of things Dean could never truly fathom. He wasn’t sure if this was one of those times, but in his unsettled haste for distraction, he glimpsed a few stray feathers in his periphery. The huge wings had shuddered inwards around them again, to contrast the angel’s seemingly tranquil immobility. Dean had to wonder if the things were great big mirrors of Cas’ sometimes cryptic mood, sending up feathery hints of emotion while he composed his other features into their usual placidity. He wondered what could be read into them. How much he’d missed with Cas keeping them concealed all the time. How much hurt they carried.
He was having trouble not getting too Oprah about the whole thing in fact, because these things were
“But hey man, you might still have a shot,” he blurts through teeth clenched in false cheer, “don’t let me stop you. It’s an hour ‘till close and I saw how that bartender was lookin’ atcha.”
Dean sighed deep into his bones as he dumped the bread he never got last night into the toaster and poured himself a cup of blissfully hot coffee.
“I haven’t seen him since he left your room last night,” Sam needled. “Y’know, to tell me that we wouldn’t be needing the spell after all. Because he was able to ‘help’ you.”
Dean ran cold and unsettled at the readjustment, but obligingly climbed off him too, since he’d seen fit to kiss him through a couple of galaxies and straight into the damn mattress. Stumbling like a newborn calf, he sank wordlessly back to his knees on the garishly carpeted floor. Meanwhile, Cas righted himself in one swift, stiff motion, a somber jack-in-the-box, until he was perched rigidly on the side of the bed. Dean's forehead had found the bend of Cas' knees for a brief moment while he caught his breath, but all too soon, the inevitable wall of awkward silence touched down, merciless and devastating. After a painfully long minute or ten, Cas finally spoke.
Dean smirks at the banality of it all. A sublime, winged vision from the pages of some unknowable, hallowed legend dutifully watering his spindly Charlie-Brown of a tomato plant, while he blows the steam from the filter-coffee in his gas-station bumblebee mug. Gettin’ his tan on. It's utterly ridiculous, but Dean kind of loves it. (And that’s where he very deliberately puts a stop to
“Just uh, I was passing by and thought I should, uh… check on you, I guess.  I know you’re all tanked up now though so I’ll just-”
It figured that the angel would make with the ridiculously sexy voice stuff only when he was about to explode, or whilst holding Dean in a death drop over an incredible sunrise.
help on that front, celestial or otherwise), but he did know that Sam had fully 180’d from Disney to HBO.
“It would have been unfair to you,” was all he said, very quietly. Dean only got a fleeting glance of the painful twist of his features before the angel was gone.
Ten minutes later sees Dean appropriately dosed with Claritin, changed into his car-washing shorts and marching straight past Sam and his smug grin. There’s a slight bounce in his step as he takes stairs this time, and the door clanks brightly behind him as he reaches the roof once more.
Dean felt a soft gasp finally -finally- rise from Cas’s fluttering throat, just under where his lips explored.
Cas’ grip on Dean had retreated to the platonic safety of his shoulders, and the angel refused to meet his eyes.
“Well Cas,” Dean eventually grinned, “If this blanket proves anything, it’s that you probably looked pretty decent in a toga. I vote Ancient Greece.”
The words he wanted to say stayed lodged in his throat, sliced deadly and rough like uncut diamonds. All he had power left to do was to retreat a few scant inches while the world flushed bright with every electric touch of the angel’s fingers.
“Ugh, let me HAVE this,” Charlie pleaded, pawing at his habitual green plaid overshirt. Her puppy eyes could rival Sam’s… or maybe the traitor had taught her.
“I want to make sure I understand,” Castiel tiptoed after an age, weighing each word with the gravity of a newborn planet.
Dean. The spell was suppressed thanks to the soul transference, though apparently there are some residual side-effects. Nothing permanent. I think. I feel…. better. Thank you.”
Dean scoffed suddenly. It was a ragged and bitter sound that startled out of him as he finally choked on the panic he’d been nursing all night.
Mortification aside, Dean had no idea how he’d managed to help raise such a grade A human, and he let himself feel goddamned proud for a second. He gave Sam a grudging nod.
“If you’re telling me you can’t recognize a feather when you see one, we got bigger problems than you not gettin’ your coffee yet, Sunshine.”
By the time Charlie was done with him, she’d wrestled Dean out of two subsequent layers, until he’d been shucked down to his black undershirt. He was also wearing honest-to-god eyeliner (it enhanced his scowl, she claimed) and donning a “distressed” hairstyle which had consisted of her pretty much shake-and-baking his head until she was satisfied. Charlie had spared him the lipstick, but it had been a close call.
“Calm down Big Bird, no need to get personal. I’m just saying, it’s like an engine. You can’t just throw it into overdrive right off the bat, you have to work your way up the gears. Y’know. Ease’r into it.”
who just happened to look like a goddamned Renaissance masterpiece emerging from the receding shadows of waning dawn. Considering the dazzling effect, Dean could be pardoned for gaping like a gutted fish for several seconds while he recovered his wits (and his man-card, barely). He took a steadying breath and stooped to pick up the knife he’d dropped. He'd come shamefully close to chopping off a toe in favour of watching Angel Gone Wild.
? I found it in the garden this morning when I was getting tomatoes for Sam’s hippie sandwich. Ro' keeps saying they're good for spells and - wait,
Dean Winchester, the Righteous Man, the Michael Sword, Chuck’s favourite pet, fell in love with a fallen angel, and there’s no going back.
Dean groaned, and someone patted his head. “There, there, little hunter, you’ll be up and ready to try to fight the sun again in no time.” The familiar Scottish voice told him.
“But uh, guess it didn’t take me too long to figure it out. Maybe on some level I always knew.” He breathes heavily; trying hard not to notice the panic and confusion. The way Cas tips his head.
“And why is Jo a kitty?” He asked, glancing up at Jo, whose shoulders he could see shaking as she looked away, not acknowledging the conversation.
Castiel learned about how Jack had become a vacuum. How Michael and Lucifer’s power had become a part of him. How every bit of power Chuck expended hurting the Winchesters had gone to him. He explained how they had left him alone there, to age and rot as Chuck had left the rest of humanity to do. He explained how Chuck had attempted to bait Sam or Dean into killing him, into finishing the story at least somewhat in his image, and how they had refused.
Dean had spent the better part of fifteen years trying to figure out exactly how to take ownership of his own feelings. He thought he got it now. He could’ve been gone. Really, truly gone. He might never have seen Miracle again. He might have missed out on Sam and Eileen’s inevitable wedding. He might never have gotten to explain to Cas how he felt about him. How he properly felt, beneath all of his bullshit attempts to cover it in seven layers of flannel and friendship.
The pain was excruciating. Blood instantly pulsed from his artery, pouring down and mixing with the lamb’s blood on the floor. He watched it slither down his limp fingers and he had to concentrate very hard through the pain to not buckle over and vomit.
“Yeah.” Jack’s voice quivered a bit, but he straightened his back, looking into Lou’s eyes with his jaw set in determination.
He had to close his eyes for a moment and take a deep breath before he straightened up himself and pulled his knife out, flipping it open. He swallowed again, looking at the bloody floor before him.
She beckoned Jack and Dean towards her and they walked up to the edge of the blood-puddle, knowing what had to be done now.
Dean nodded back and balled his hands into fists, trying to stop the panic coursing through his veins but of course not managing it. When Jack stepped forward to stand next to him he turned around again and watched Lou put her long light-brown hair into a high bun, then take of her shoes, socks and shirt. Seeing her move around in just shorts and a bra it made the situation feel even more surreal.
Dean obeyed, swallowing hard. He fastidiously buried that precious little discovery somewhere deep and forbidden while the spark of fire in his belly roared.
Dean could think of about two dozen other “responses to stimulation” he was wishing to instigate with his fingers, but he refrained.
Mercifully, Sam heaved a lengthy sigh and nodded his floppy head. Dean half-heartedly resented the pitiful look aimed his way, but the ensuing silence was consolation enough.
“Are you trying to give me a heart attack? You’re way too gutsy for a guy who just learned how to do this five seconds ago!” Dean whined, his eyes somehow having closed again.
allowed to leave the building - remember what happened to your buddy Cyriel? He went snap crackle pop and we’re not doing that. We’re
“You’re leaking mojo like a broken toilet here; save it for yourself, you idiot!” he berated him tepidly.
“I’m not sure in which universe you’re picturing me getting involved in this,” Sam grumbles, letting Cas by. The angel treats the younger Winchester to a soft smile before poking Dean in the shoulder. His finger looks particularly smite-y.
Dean growled in annoyance before urgently fumbling into “Can’t you put your wings away then?” as though the angel hadn’t thought of that.
Thoughts whirling, Dean did his best to refocus on the topic at hand. He nodded. This wasn’t an enigma he’d ever come close to solving before, and he certainly wasn’t going to tonight. He plodded onwards.
And while Dean isn’t one for prodding this hard at something that makes him feel actual feelings, he really can’t help his curiosity.
“I’ll drop YOU once we get back down there,” Dean sniped in a voice about three octaves higher than usual.
The flip had been worrisome enough to tear Dean from the brief sanctuary of Lisa and Ben’s and hit the road again, though that had been a long time coming. Months of retrospect later, Dean had been forced to make amends with the fact that the last year spent as Mr White Picket-Fence had served its purpose, but that he wasn’t suited to being domesticated. (Big fat duh on that one, but sometimes, a guy had to try.) It had been nice for a while, to pretend he was someone whose everyday involved rides to school, dishes, and the Maddisons' annoying cat who always shat in the rose bush, as opposed to the
And, just because he could in this strange little moment they’d chiseled out, Dean hugged at Cas’ firm frame once more, tilting his head so that his lips might hover next to his ear.
Compared to the glimpse of wings he’d spied last night, this version, freed from the dusty motel room filter, was freaking spectacular and was pretty much wiping away any coherent thought he had. The wings moved like enormous, slow-motion sails attached to Cas’ back, floating idly on the breeze, curving towards the emerging sunlight. The entrancing vision was only enhanced by their contrast to Cas’ lightly bronzed skin, which shimmered faintly with sweat and rippled with the practiced movement of lean muscles beneath. Dean soon found that exactly
Dean grimaced, and before he could reason the reflex away, he insolently pinched one of the feathers. Was it immature? Yes. Was it a petulant little gesture compelled by his juvenile, bullheaded need to always have the last word?
“Well, I figured you might choke, so when I saw the Batmobile I thought I’d come over and lend you a helping hand.”
He’s already rolling up his sleeves with gusto, delighting in the idea of spending the afternoon outside and being useful with Cas at his side, even if it’s menial physical labour that’s involved. He’s already picturing the satisfaction of cracking a pair of cold beers once they’re done when he notices the angel’s expression. Castiel seems crestfallen. His wings have somehow folded themselves perfectly against the limited real estate of his back and there’s a curiously sheepish expression veiling his features.
against him, kept brushing over his lower abdomen with every bassy word spoken, through the too-thin cotton of his shirt. He was practically non copos mentis by the time he registered that Cas was still talking, and about things that actually sounded like they needed hearing.
“Thanks for breakfast,” Sam muttered with a distinct lack of gratitude. He slammed the fridge door and made a dramatic show of retrieving his grilled tomato egg sandwich.
“I’m just saying,” Sam insisted, “you haven’t been watching from the emotionally-constipated sidelines for the past ten years like I have. The guy loves you. It’s stupidly obvious. Only someone with your level of self-loathing could miss that, because I know that you’re not THAT dumb.”
sure he’d never sucked face with an angel before thank-you-very-much, but flashes of red hair and big brown eyes imposed themselves mid-thought.
Before he could talk himself out of it, he settled himself carefully behind the angel and, cheeks pinking, wrapped the blanket around his shoulders. He was grateful that Cas couldn’t really see him from this vantage because his face outright began to scorch once he’d decided not to retract his arms. Instead, he squeezed the Cas’ solid figure with what he hoped was a fortifying hug. This was perilously outside the scope of things he’d thought possible with Cas, but he was encouraged when the angel seemed to melt back against him with a relieved sigh, and gently squeezed his arm in response. Nevermind that Dean’s heart was thrumming faster than a hummingbird’s wing, or that Cas smelled so fucking good - like sticky summer thunderstorms - that he was tempted to throw caution to the wind and bury his face in the guy’s neck like an amorous tick. For now, he managed to content himself with the warm, comforting press of closeness. It was far more than he deserved, but he was glad to do it for Cas’ sake.
Dean realised he would need to get inside the house. These people didn’t look too much like hunters, so maybe Dean could sneak in without too much interference.
He thought of Sammy, and how his brother had only ever wanted a family and a normal life. A career. Sure, it was still weird not to live in the same place anymore, but it was a good weird. Sammy who had believed he was a monster. Who had fought for himself even through his own insecurities. Sammy who had been molded by God and by their father just like Dean. He watched Sammy now, the absolute giant looking lovingly into his pregnant wife’s eyes. The boy who overcame the demon blood. The boy who fought against Lucifer. One of the men who stopped God. A husband. A father. A man with a life. A man with the life he always wanted.
Scarred, bow legged, ageing, lined, with blood staining his clothes. Despite all that, Cas can’t think of anything he’s ever seen that’s more beautiful than this. Dean, living and breathing, back in the world.
The barn only reminds Cas of that. It reminds him of Dean and everything about Dean that makes Cas love him so much. His fight, his fire, his determination.
‘Cas, you got your ears on?’ Cas always had his ears on for Dean. Dean, who wouldn’t pray to God, but who prayed to him. Who trusted him enough to pray to him. To call for him. Cas waited for more, waited for an explanation. He figured he’d have to face it eventually, the awkwardness of what had happened. He figured Dean might just… sort of stop talking to him after this. Been uncomfortable or overwhelmed. After all, Cas had hurt him so many times. To turn around and have to see that?
Sam was telling him to hold on, telling him he could get help and Dean was trying to convince him that it was okay, that it was the end and that that was okay, because at least they were free, and because things were different, and because Sam having a life without him couldn’t be so bad. All these years of having nobody except each other, of slowly growing their family outside of themselves, outside of blood… Maybe it was time Sam got to live a life outside of worrying about Dean. Outside of their priority always being each other.
Not-Dean got up, got dressed, and left, but Dean still waited till he heard the familiar growl of the impala’s engine until he risked speaking to Cas. God, this was going to go so badly.
Their relationship had undergone so many sharp changes and contrasts, times where they were best friends or times where they were gunning for each other. In truth, a part of Castiel had tried to resist it so many times. He’d tried to remind himself of who he was. He was an angel. A cosmic, celestial being, who had lived a thousand lifetimes more than this one man could ever imagine. He told himself, and Dean, that he didn’t serve him and that he never would.
“I… didn’t know,” Cas says finally, and he can feel tears threatening again. He can feel the indicative tightening in his throat. Oh, to be a real angel again, to forget about all this pain and heartbreak and all this emotion. But no, Cas knows he wouldn’t trade back a single second he got to spend with Dean. A single second he got to spend by this family’s side.
The last time he had tried to leave, he really thought that would be the end. He thought often about how after everything, after giving up any home or life he’d ever known, again and again for him, Dean had turned his back on him. Hadn’t even been able to look him in the eye. He knew Dean was struggling. With losing Jack, with losing his sense of identity and free will, his hope for his future, but Castiel realised he couldn’t sit around and wait for Dean to realise that he had been here forever. That he had been by his side and that he had fought his entire human-adjacent life to try to save him.
When Dean pulled back, Cas couldn’t bring himself to feel excited or pleased or really anything other than… sort of sad. This couldn’t stay. It wouldn’t last. He saw the way Dean looked at him. He was a friend, most of the time. But sometimes, he was a burden. Sometimes, Dean would go off with some girl from some bar and Cas would be left with Sam, to hang out or go home. Cas never held Dean’s attention long, and he knew that was how it would be.
Dean swallows, and Cas’ eyes are wide and afraid. Dean thinks maybe he’s starting to realise what’s happening.
“Cas, come on man…” Dean urged. “You’re gone for months and this is how you decide to make your entrance? Stop being a drama queen and wake up.”
The day was bright but overcast, and Dean found the angel perched on the concrete, as was his habit. He sat still as a statue with his arms civilly folded over his lap and his legs dangling precariously over the edge. He was skywards as Dean approached, as though he could read something in the thick blanket of cloud. He probably could.
about 15 feet away from his starting point, and it took every ounce of restraint Dean had accumulated in his entire lifetime not to burst out into hysterical laughter. He failed.
noticed about ten years ago, and hadn’t stopped noticing since. That wasn’t the problem. The problem was Cas being reckless at the drop of a hat, even despite his recent and potentially fatal handicap.
Increasing concern soon overriding his ponderings, he hastily pulled on a fresh t-shirt and poked his head out the front door. He gained nothing but the retina burn of a sun-scorched concrete parking lot for his efforts. However, now that he was outside, he was privy to a vague gasping sound which sent his stomach plummeting to his bare feet. He hastily equipped his knife in anticipation of some otherworldly encounter going wrong (because fuck his life, obviously) and bolted out the door.
“Perhaps later, once you’ve rested. And showered,” Cas agreed, a smirk evident in his voice. Dean was still not over how lucky he was. He was working on it.
“Please tell me again, then,” Castiel asked, “I’ll believe you this time.” By the time he leaned in, Dean was already there to meet him.
He’d have to properly examine their little family group’s disturbing tendency for self-sacrifice later, but for now, he was just grateful it had successfully plucked Cas from the abyss.
When Castiel’s focus reluctantly returned to Dean, the hunter found he was at his usual loss for words in these situations. Still, all drafts under his dead-guy robe aside, Dean was feeling particularly ballsy that morning. And well, if he could relieve Cas even minimally of all the grief and worry he carried, Dean would happily do what he could, even if it meant acquiescing to some obscure angel malarkey. For Cas, he would do almost anything.
The sign for Lebanon zipped by and his heart hurled itself against his Adam’s apple. Whether it was in protest or anticipation he wasn’t sure, but either way dread knotted itself at the back of his throat as they made their final approach to the bunker.
I'm cheesy, but I try to be funny. Let me know how that comes across, if it works at all ;) And also, I'm very much aware of how many Destiel tropes/clichés are in this, but I'm kind of okay with it, lol. Still, always curious for feedback. Thanks for staying with me, still!
, Cas, not because we give a shit about some heavenly cat-fight. And not for nothing either… look what happened to you!”
“Look, I’m not trying to make you feel like a freakshow here but, aren’t those… y’know, heavy? I mean I
To demonstrate the point, Cas knelt down and beat his wings with gusto, resulting in a wind-tunnel that almost knocked Dean off his feet. The exercise granted Cas about 4 feet of height above the ground before he was unceremoniously expelled into the grass like a bug from a windshield. He seemed a lot less concerned about the violent impact than Dean was, judging by the number of craters pockmarking the lawn. He was already brushing himself off by the time Dean reached him, helping hand and shit-eating grin in tow.
Perhaps it was the drain of this most recent job. After all, this nest of vamps in particular could all have had prom dates for how disturbingly young they looked. Perhaps was it the frigid, psychopathic detachment with which Sam had dispatched these literal children of the night that evening, heads falling as easily as rose stems. Or maybe it was just that powerful longing for normalcy which breached him every so often, especially after particularly gruesome jobs, which in turn, fed the upsetting realization that he had no idea what
He was thankful that his hunting habits were providing something to talk about to fill the imposing silence.
coughing. Every heave seemed to cause a static spike in the room, accented by puffs of errant grace exiting Cas wherever they could - eyes, mouth, nose, pores - as though he were a wet sponge continually being stepped on. It didn’t take whole lot of Dean’s finely-honed hunter instinct to diagnose that these symptoms were a boatload of Not Good™.
Dean couldn’t help himself; decades of dad-joke defense mechanisms were hard to subdue. Castiel, meanwhile, had the look of forced patience reserved for overpacked subways and screaming infants on airplanes.
“Of all the things I have seen, sunrise is one of my favourites, now that I am allowed to indulge in saying so out loud” said Cas, with a solemn reverence that washed over the hunter like a warm tide. "I'll have to return to my post soon, but I wanted to show this to you."
For his part, Jack wears the same innocently delighted expression he dons in regards to most things. At Sam’s coaxing, he takes one last fleeting glance at the pair before replying “With pineapples, please?”
the scowl stretching on Cas’ face, since his own cheek was so carelessly crushed against the stubbly surface around Cas’ mouth.
“Look, I dunno. I brought it for you, ‘cause it seemed to help last time. But I get that you’re all good now so ….”
His giant hands still slick with vamp guts, Sam had insisted on doing his own thing straight after the last job, “to unwind”, he’d said. Usually, Dean would have been alright with that, because Sam’s thing typically involved dusty local libraries, bricky computers from the 90’s, and general nerdery that the elder Winchester only partook in during times of
“Dean,” he breathed right back, oh so softly. Dean’s eyes were compelled to his, as inevitably as gravity. “It’s alright. I know this is a spell at work. You must let me help you now, because the summoning might take more time than you have, given that you have fought the spell for so long already. Your body is at its limit.”
In that moment, Dean instantly recognized the warmth pooling in his chest, and for once, he wasn’t afraid. He wanted to see this kind of reaction in Cas as often as he possibly could, wanted to be responsible for giving him these rare bouts of untainted happiness in an existence sublimated by blind, self-effacing devotion to others. Something heavy and self-negating had been dislodged in his chest, as though the toothy angel grin had somehow been the last heave necessary to send Dean teetering over a self-imposed edge. In fact, feeling the affection and adoration flood over him like winter thaw, Dean felt compelled to spew all the sappy Samantha stuff he'd kept bottled up right at Cas and see what would happen.
He rustled up what courage he had left, took one of the angel’s hands in both of his and brought the battle-rough knuckles to his lips. He kissed them with slow reverence, so there could be no mistaking his intent.
eventually devolved into lazy groans of delight. That was just fine with Dean, and far more than he’d expected from this garbage fire of a day.
Shaky and vaguely sickened as he was by the height and the aerial seesawing, Dean knew he hadn’t any choice. There was something too pleading and sincere in Cas’ words… like he’d held onto this tiny, impossible dream for an age. And Dean well, he was not a man to disappoint any angel currently keeping him from plummeting to a certain, messy death.
“We’ll find the summoning ritual as soon as we get in. I already called Cas when you were out and he’s looking through the library now. He DID ask
As nonchalantly as the angel was in trying to explain it, as though they’d merely been discussing the weather or the ingredients to an omelette, his words saw Dean’s alarm levels spike through the roof in an instant. The hunter’s hands immediately slid from the top of Cas’ head to his cheeks, forcing the slumping angel to peer up at him.
“Yeah.” Dean admitted quietly. “He booked it right after - And get your head outta the damn gutter by the way, it’s not what you think -” he added, tossing a perfectly innocent grape at his brother’s head. Its perfect trajectory did not lighten his mood.
“JESUS FUCKING CHRIST ON A CRACKER CAS, PUT ME DOWN!” he bellowed roughly, his throat Sahara dry as he watched his feet now dangling helplessly above the parking lot.
Dean deposits the two coffee mugs he’d carried onto the table, and crosses his arms towards his brother.
funny,” Cas insisted, grass stains smudged into his chest and arms. He looked like an entire kindergarten class had held him down and doodled all over him with green wax crayons.
after months of sustained absence. None of it added up to anything good, including the unprompted speculation about what the wings looked like attached to Cas’ naked shoulder blades. Fortunately, Dean’s well-honed preservation instincts kicked into overdrive and banished any further queries. He dove to the pile of angelic road-kill.
He felt the wings still above him for a moment before they exhaled inwards, pressing him close. There was a long silence where he felt the angel tense beneath his fingers. For a moment, Dean was desperately afraid that despite his assurances and warm touch, Cas would vanish.
, because of the whole curse thing. And I get you’re an angel and all,” he sputters, “but like it or not, you ain’t exactly used to being vulnerable… And still, you keep taking the same risks because you’re a stubborn sonovabitch Cas, and you know it.”
Cas’ hands seemed to roam of their own volition as he watched Dean from this new vantage, framing his jaw, embracing his shoulders and sweeping over his chest with veneration and care so profound it stunned Dean into silence. He could only meet them with his own, squeezing tightly at their passage.
Dean stumbles and rights himself just in time to catch the plummeting mugs, but he can’t say the same for his jaw.
” response as an olive branch. That's practically an act of treason, but the brat deserves it. Eventually, after puttering in place longer than is strictly natural, he relents to the sibling standoff with a sigh. It’s too goddamned early for Dean to be feeling like he’s been caught with his pants down (not in the fun way), and he’d really like to make an exit.
His fatigue was an ever-present truth barely worth noticing anymore, but it sometimes crept up and startled Dean when he looked hard enough. His viridescent eyes seemed foggy and red that night (and not just because of the booze). They were haloed by far more lines etched into his tan skin than he’d anticipated; markings earned through blood that recorded long decades of encounters with dark things. Speaking of, he began with wiping his face clear of the Pollock-like spatterings of red marring his face. Seeing his features re-emerge from beneath the gruesome war mask made him feel fractionally better, even though the myriad of cuts still disrupted the boyish freckles. Sighing, he painstakingly peeled up his formerly white t-shirt and winced a little at the sight. He was covered in all manner of scratches and bruises thanks to those fanged emo tweens.
to be terrified of travelling at 300 miles an hour in a steel toilet paper tube, 5 miles above the ground.
“I rotate between the pairs I manifest,” Castiel reveals wryly, “So you might be forgiven for assuming that. Having three pairs out at once is taxing, especially given my current state. But when the sun is out, I have found that it feels…
- with an amused sort of mischief as he considers the angel's argument. Sam grimaces visibly as Dean's face turns unmistakably wicked then, just before he proceeds to launch a positively wolfish grin at Cas. He looks like he's found the goose with the golden eggs; except
He doubted Cas even noticed, but the proximity was becoming somewhat distracting to Dean’s increasingly flustered and alcohol-fuzzed senses. He’d have chosen swan-diving back into hell in a tutu over admitting it, but physical closeness was a craving more powerful than any vice Dean had. He hadn't been able to get his usual fix under the guise of sleazy one-nighters lately, and unfortunately for him in that moment, certain bed-headed angels with no respect for personal bubbles had a funny way of quietly dismantling his usual boundaries.
The angel had long since b-lined to the top of his mental shit-list, but there was not enough whiskey in the world, never mind this lacklustre town, for Dean to pick at that scab. Suffice it to say that the Cas’ sustained absence due to Heaven’s civil war had been more than noticed. It had festered into a hot, ragged wound in that nameless place under Dean’s skin, where the angel had long since taken up residence without asking. Like some sort of fungus, but with better hair.
“No… no that’s not it.” He swallowed, trying to compel the mess in his brain into something more cohesive, but the immensity of the experience was hard to parse. So was this delicious closeness, veiled in the soothing privacy of shadow. His fingers had laced themselves around Cas’ by their own volition, and he realized he’d been holding them to his chest, tight.
“And what if we end up needing to strap you to Baby’s roof and take you through the car-wash, do we need to perform some sort of ritual first?”
“Your uh… your wings are still…” Dean muttered, jerking upright. He swallowed hard as he cast a shaking, accusatory finger at the twin shadows blooming behind Cas’ shoulders.
A moment later, he’s clapping his hands together with a burst of enthusiasm that surprises him, and seems to perplex the angel a little.
The embrace deepened, and a tide of warmth that felt like his heart liquefied, or grace, or both, drowned out all the background noise. The entire world - the entire freaking universe - had been reduced to the elation of kissing Cas, to breathing Cas in, to devouring him from the inside out as his lips and tongue and teeth ravenously sought him out from all possible angles. He shook and gasped at the feel of it, reeling at his explorations being returned tenfold, being made whole by the sudden certainty that this was right and divine and immovable. He poured everything he was into that kiss, and let Cas take what he needed from the ineffable blaze erupting between them. It was everything he had, everything he was, and Cas could take all of it. And, thusly lost and found all at once, Dean let himself fall, tethered to the angel he’d loved with every molecule since before even knowing his name.
Cas was serving him the tired, glassy-eyed version of the (Celestial) People’s Eyebrow, but it was interrupted by another bout of just,
that Big Bird,” Dean assures him - he’s no idiot when it comes to angel lore by now - “but you never wear ‘em out, that’s all. I thought it was, I dunno,… a metaphor or something. Like halos and harps and togas, y'know, like lore or whatever.”
Fireworks exploded in Dean’s gut, frantic and joyous, but he managed to tamper them enough to compose himself, even while discomfort radiated off his best friend in tangible waves. He hoped he could soon abate them, if only he could successfully trudge through the swamp of feelings laid bare before him.
Sam fleetingly considered disobeying his brother and just letting the Oscar-worthy shit-show happen as he was unceremoniously abandoned to Castiel’s scowling wake.
Dean scoured a hand over his weary, blood-smattered features. He was crusted in dried sweat and gods knew what else, and his weathered skin still crawled. He longed for a shower, but his feet remained solidly planted.
“Stupid magic arrow or not, it’s always been you, okay? That’s what I’m saying. And I know I’ve been a scared, unworthy piece of shit Cas - still am - but, I want to try, if you do. I just… never thought you did. Or could.”
Because, yeah: being “touched by an angel” was pretty fucking bewildering to put it mildly, even though the pain was curiously beginning to ebb, replaced by something else entirely. By the time Dean could wrap his limited human consciousness around it, a plume of liquid heat had begun to swell in his chest and he was suddenly sure, in that surreal, heart-stopping moment, that Cas was
Obviously, the angel ignored him. Insufferably stubborn as always, Cas wordlessly hoisted himself from the ground, using the great wings as makeshift jacks. Even with their help however, he struggled to get to his feet, but Dean was upon him in seconds. He slung an arm around his waist for support, though the exercise proved to be much more tricky than usual: he actually ate a face-full of feathers before finally succeeding at depositing Cas onto one of the sad little beds. He took a seat beside him. For a long while, Cas sat there with his head drooped forward onto his soiled shirt, as though trying to collect himself, the occasional wet cough escaping him. Perhaps his vessel was even more damaged than it had first appeared, seeing as it showed both angelic and mortal wounds. Dean was more than a little curious about this (and the impromptu midnight drop-in), and his patience vis-à-vis the angel’s silence broke mere seconds later.
Dean felt the ghost of a smirk reach him at the borrowed expression, regaining his feet after that. He cleared his throat loudly and brushed off his rumpled tee; a portrait of painful, bewildered self-consciousness. For a long while, his sense of limitless unworthiness prevented him from even looking at Cas and his swollen pink lips, his floofy hair and his huge, expectant eyes. Dean being Dean though (ie: a stubborn bastard), he eventually did anyway, concern overriding his mortal embarrassment. He clamped adrenaline-soaked hands on Cas’ shoulders, as though to confirm to himself that the angel was actually still whole.
It all makes sense of course, but Dean has absolutely no frame of reference for how ‘grooming’ even looks, or works. For the briefest second, his brain conjures a vision of Cas splashing around in a bird bath and he just about loses it right there and then, but manages to swallow down his laughter. Cas looks particularly embarrassed right now, and he figures it’s probably some obscure angel thing around which he should tread lightly. Tentatively, he places a hand on one of the folded wings, calling back Cas’ attention.
“Okay well since you’re stuck here, if you wanna fly, let’s work it out,” Dean proposed with a clap of exaggerated enthusiasm, designed to dispel his reverie. “I think you’re probably flapping too hard, for starters.”
Dean felt some of the tension drain at the unexpected admission. For the entire duration of Castiel’s war for Heaven so far, he’d not once heard him admit to lacking that disturbing, feverish televangelist sort of conviction in the cause. As such, even if it was rooted in what he could only imagine was immeasurable bloodshed, this raw, discouraged side of Cas was oddly refreshing. Perhaps his old friend was still in there, somewhere. Encouraged, Dean wove his fingers through Castiel’s dark locks in a show of comfort.
one I can trust. Not because you were some backup plan, Dean. I assumed you understood that by now, though I am sorry if this is inconvenient for you."
Fortunately, they were already halfway home when the effects started to kick in. Had he not already been paying close attention, he might have missed his symptoms entirely. It was nothing but a sudden spike in temperature; perhaps a light tug coming from the doldrums of his stomach. So far. The grudging gift of experience dictated that it would likely get much worse before it would get better.
On cue, the angel seemed to falter, head sliding just south enough for Dean to pull the emergency brake and yank him back up by the armpits.
“Cyriel is dead. His grace seeped out of him on contact and then once he was mortal he was impaled on-”
Sam’s eyebrows made an attempt for his hairline, but Dean felt no satisfaction. He crossed his arms and leaned heavily on the counter, toast forgotten.
“You’ve put me back together before,” Dean reminded him gently, in a tone almost tender enough to quell the agonizing despair screaming behind his chest.
“No no no, this can’t be happening… Cas c’mon, please,” Dean begged him, cradling his distorted features helplessly.
To emphasize his point, he reached over and lifted Cas’ stubbly chin, revealing a few endlessly Grace-spewing slashes down the column of the angel’s neck. It almost looked like he had gills. Cas said nothing, but those blue eyes bored into Dean mercilessly. Dean swore the angel had leaned into his touch, but he released him before he could confirm the impression.
Dean’s breath stilled for a moment as the gentle press of a palm caressed his cheek in answer. Unthinkingly, his own hand rose to cover it, pressing it to him in a rush of urgency, as though to confirm the touch was real under the dreamlike cover of dark.
Dean finally rose from the hard mattress to go to the bathroom, desperate to distract himself from his self-sorry meanderings. His worn frame roared in protest, barely numbed anymore by the warming hum of alcohol. Still, he was filthy and needed to rinse off that day’s particular horrors anyway. The way his bones deeply ached with every step, he momentarily found himself longing for the instantly-effective ministrations of his angelic counterpart, but quickly rebuffed the thought. How easily he’d become instinctively dependent on Cas wasn’t something he cared to dissect just then either. Besides, Cas barely deigned show up anymore unless it was to ask a vague but-always-ridiculously-dangerous favour in the name of his Holy Featherduster Crusades. Maybe that was a good thing. The distance would give Dean time to recover; to find solace in his old, pre-Cas routines. Perhaps he’d gotten careless or lazy over the years; no other hunter had the luxury of a literal angel on their shoulder after all. Still, Dean’s body had suffered a lot lately as a consequence of fighting his way through Cas’ “errands” (aside from the usual slew of Awful that tailed him on the regular), and the trench-coated douche hadn’t even bothered restoring the merchandise. It left the elder Winchester feeling much like a revolving door of ancient weapons and thankless celestial chores. That night, the booze and resentment even led Dean to question the depth of their ambiguous relationship; to wonder if their so-called
What the hell was he thinking? Dean’s attempts were damn near laughable, but he’d felt so- well. It didn’t matter. Cas was cured now. No more rabid red-eyed Hulk smashing, no more fever, and certainly no more need for Dean’s paltry human comforts. Rowena had seen to that with a few fancy words and a wave of her perfectly manicured fingers, before poofing off into oblivion. That was a problem that would surely bite them in the ass with all its ginger might later, but a more pressing one was at hand.
“Whatever, Sammy. Is there even a case here? It just sounds like a bunch of rave-kids coming off their uppers. I mean, we thought there were a bunch of cases in Florida, but it was just
He could almost hear the angel’s spine go rigid as he nervously licked his lips, looking up and away once more.
this apology is going well, he thinks sourly. He’s already resorted to quasi-yelling and name-calling. Maybe he oughta really cement his expression of regret with a punch to the jaw. Not like they haven't been
Cas clearly needed more power, to tide him and his hungry wings over until the spell wore off, or until a better option presented itself. And just like that, as he beheld the terrible spectacle tenting them, the solution struck Dean like lightning. Even if it was just a bandaid for now, it was all they had. Because he sure as shit wasn’t going to let Cas go nuclear alone if this failed.
He had to get away, but he knew it was pointless. Cas had borne witness to almost every iteration of Dean’s lowest point; he didn’t see why this would be any different, despite how much he may have wished for another outcome. Again he would fail Cas at being better, at being worthy. He could feel it as surely as the simmering in his skin.
He marvels at all of it, this creature of light and pure devotion crashing against him like he is the only shore in the world.
“Are you alright?” Cas’ expression immediately knits itself into something somber and worried, which finally compels Dean to speak. He hates making Cas worry; the guy’s default is already set to constipated jack-in-the-box, after all.
Too exhausted to deal with any of it anymore, he buried his face into the polite pleats of those boring pants the angel wore. He felt Cas’ sharp intake of breath, and he couldn't really blame him. While they’d crossed certain lines recently, after a long decade of tiptoeing around each other, Dean’s unpracticed bids at affection were still as unpredictable as the rusty weathervane that spun over Bobby’s garage during summer storms. Cas welcomed him all the same, every time, thunder and all.
When Dean finally mustered the nerve to look up at him, the stony resolve engraved in Cas’ features only made everything that much worse. The entire world seemed to shrink down into focus on his unrelenting gaze, helplessly sucking Dean in like a whirlpool. He knew it was the magic’s doing of course, but he also recognized that its effects were redoubled because of a decade-long flame rooted in his gut. As much as he’d resisted all these hours, it immediately struck him that he was already lost. He was a sandcastle in a hurricane. He took a teetering step back, desperate for escape, but Cas followed, sure as the tide.
There’s a pang of disappointment that rolls through him as the sweaty, angelic groundskeeping fantasy crumbles, but he resigns himself.
The narrow-eyed head tilt that followed made him falter, but he was determined to hold that infuriating cerulean gaze until it would yield.
He’s about four beers in after all, though at this point they’re warmer than the bath. It’s oddly fitting to his state of mind; halfway to numb, even though the pain crippling his body is barely buoyed by the hard water. He knows he’s lucky to feel it at all, but can’t find it in him to be grateful right now.
. I ain’t one for math but… I’m just…they’re kinda pulling some Tribbles stunt right now aren't they?"
Dean barely registered the amusing way Cas had emulated the air quote, even though his execution had been understandably half-assed. No. Stupid, based human that he was, Dean was far too intensely preoccupied with how the angel’s lips, thusly
Castiel turned to leave, hastily buttoning up his wrinkled shirt and retrieving his shorn clothing from the floor. Dean was still catching his breath but managed to grab an armful of the angel, and spun him around.
“Just warn me next time you guys are gonna be doing mating rituals in the kitchen, I’d really like to keep my toast down.”
Dean is still studying Cas’ profile when he realizes for the countless time, with as much dizzying clarity as the first, how much he fucking loves him. Of course, that’s not new. Every once in a while though, in quiet moments when Cas is just,
It was only the sobering crash of the cheap side-lamp as it ricocheted off the wall thanks to an untamed wing which saw Dean’s eyes bolt open suddenly... only to be left staring directly into the angel’s. The angel who then sheepishly detached himself from Dean’s lips and
The mantra had grown tattered and thin over the past few hours, but he persisted. He’d fought the Mark, for fuck’s sake. He could damn well fight this ludicrous situation. After all, Dean liked his room, liked the Bunker, and wasn’t too keen on spending the remainder of his already difficult life hiding under a rock because of a chubby guy in a toga, thank you very much.
“That’s…. awesome,” Dean eventually agreed, his arms falling to the delicious assault on his head. “I kinda wish my head had a 20 foot wingspan now.”
misunderstanding me,” Cas declared rigidly from behind him, “I came to you because in Heaven or on Earth, you are the
“He’s on the roof,” Sam announces from behind his book. He’s got his giraffe gams comfortably parked on the maps table, and only bothers to glance up at Dean insofar as a long-suffering eye roll is capable of doing so.
“Cas. Talk to me,” Dean insisted, as gently as he could. He loosened his grip some, but found himself reluctant to release him. It always seemed like such a risk.
He knows how good a liar the angel is first hand. Dean sighs. Crosses a distance he usually wouldn’t, without much of a thought.
Sam thinks back to the way Dean’s battered features had landed on Sam’s in a flood of gratitude and honest-to-god embarrassment, like this had been some sort of rookie mistake. He also remembers how his brother’s expression had shifted then, practically melting, once his eyes had found Cas’, wild with concern.
Cas launches a perplexed, tilty-headed look at him. Dean would usually feel fond at seeing the old, familiar gesture, but he’s too overwhelmed by the feathered spectacle that the angel is being so infuriatingly laissez-faire about.
“But no. I was fascinated of course, but not allowed to participate. There was never a good enough reason to disobey, back then anyway.” he added significantly.
Uncharacteristic as it was, there was definite hurt in Cas’ voice, or disappointment in the least. Dean said nothing even though his heart sank, letting the angel continue. He knew a thing or two about being disappointed in the actions of beloved siblings.
actually. You were right. But I can’t exactly see you and well, I just… I...there’s some things a guy has to say face to face, you uh… you get me?” he sputtered, cursing himself for his lack of eloquence. “We … we gotta talk for a minute, man. On land, so I don’t accidentally ruin the upholstery mid-sentence.”
He tapped his face, called his name… but there was no response, for long enough that Dean was considering calling his erratic yeti of a brother for back-up. He swallowed the thought down, owing to the fact that Sam lately had been even more of a mess than Cas, just of a different sort. And Dean well, he wasn’t too good at emotional multitasking. He opted instead to grab Cas’ unmoving shoulders and shake them, probably more violently than was advisable for any human. Despite all his grievances with anything remotely celestial lately, his heart pounded with dread. Dean was always a little irrational when it came to Cas, even though the guy was technically supposed to be ungankable. It was just… with all the evil things in the world (and their uncle) doing their damnedest to test that theory lately, Dean shook harder.
Indeed, he held fast to the angel as the great wings beat a steady, slow rhythm which generated a reasonable amount of lift without catapulting Cas into the next county. He was maintaining a safe few feet off the ground now, without much trouble.
The involuntary whimper sent molten lava plummeting south, and all at once Dean had entirely forgotten why he’d felt so slighted. Or how to speak.
“You’re worth it,” Cas reiterates. His hard blue gaze is sharpened to an icy point, daring him the hunter to contradict him. Dean is pinned into silence for a long while. He eventually nods, defeated. He’s so fucking tired.
As amused as he was by the cowboyism, Dean was totally outgunned. The twitchy need to flee chewed at his innards, but he was pinned by Cas’ earnest gaze.
lit in Tron blue. Even though last time he checked it was early December, it was like Halloween, Comic Con (or both) had thrown up all over the joint. Some wore ensembles of pure white, while others donned colourful contact lenses, even crazier hair, and some others still, wore almost nothing at all. Stranger still, some guests wore the modest head-to-toe vestments demanded by strictest Christian denominations, patiently waiting for entry even while they shuffled uncomfortably against their wilder, latex-clad neighbours.
He licked his lips nervously while he let that settle in, before going on. "Look it was all real, okay? I just... What I meant was that I wish it hadn’t been a damned love spell that finally kicked me in the ass - I mean do you even know how stupid that is - I may never live it down, but the point is: I’ll fucking take it, okay? If it means that we- well, I’ll take it. ”
He’d regained some semblance of stability for the first time since before his mother had burned on the ceiling, but had traded it for the next big bad as soon as he could get behind the wheel.
Dean’s gaze flickered up, eyes burning and his jaw clenched under Cas’ hold. The angel’s gaze bore into him, shockingly ravenous and slightly unhinged. Dean gasped at the sight, which up to that point, had only existed in his most private dreams.
The other bed was left gloriously unmentioned while feathers pulled inwards, encasing Dean in a blanket of living, pulsing warmth. Perhaps they were both feeling bolder than usual.
Dean felt a soft, downy tickle as Castiel plucked the feather that was perched over Dean’s ear and retreated to a safer distance. The angel’s gaze was positively accusatory as he reiterated through bared, hissing teeth:
“Look,” he reasoned, “why don’t you just tell me why you’re here so we can get you on your way? What is it, another weapon goose chase?”
Cas peered at him from a tantalizingly close distance, the beige swaths of his trench coat shifting against Dean’s bare legs. Dean stopped breathing altogether when the angel’s hand swept up towards his face. His eyes closed of their own volition, both out of paralyzing fear and delicious anticipation. So help him, he was sleep-deprived and halfway to sporting a
Thankfully, despite the ill-timed boner fog, his brain had deemed the terms “vessel” and “failing” important enough to register.
Now, as he threw a mangy duffel onto an even mangier motel bed, that brief sliver of peace felt alien; a distant exit long past in the rearview mirror. He was back in his element: Exhausted, every nook of his body caked with dirt and a nest’s worth of vampire blood, and of course, absolutely crushed with the isolating burdens of his ensnarement between the violent wills of heaven, hell and every dark, slithering realm in between.
At this reminder Cas’ expression faltered, and Dean cursed himself for the faux-pas. There was silence long enough for Dean to wonder if he should just cut his losses and leave. His feet unconsciously shuffled backwards, but he stopped himself at Castiel’s crestfallen look.
He dug his fingers even deeper around Cas’ neck, far too terrified to even preoccupy himself with the full-on body sandwich press they had going on, and tentatively opened an eye.
“I’m going to go now,” Castiel growled, though his features were glowing redder than Dean had ever seen them. Did angels really blush this much?
He maneuvered around the motel’s spectacularly drab units with well-honed stealth, creeping silently towards the back yard. He peered around the corner, which gave onto a small grassy clearing - complete with sun-bleached plastic chairs that hadn’t seen a bum in at least two decades - which sloped into a dense wood.
“No. I need to recuperate,” the angel explained tersely, “I disagreed, but my battalion insisted I hide for a while since I now seem to be the enemy’s primary target. There was nowhere else to go. ”
just for shits and giggles, even though the situation had forced him into closer quarters than his nebulous heterosexuality might have preferred.
vulnerable, are the easiest ways to access the soul, other than literally tearing into it,” Castiel provided, lacing his long fingers together and setting them primly over his knees. He stared at his impeccably-pressed pants, as though their polyester folds held the secrets of the universe.
Cas did the head tilt thing while his brows quirked in confusion, and a tentative flap confirmed the lingering presence.
“Yeah,” Dean conceded, letting himself flop gracelessly sideways onto the dusty mattress with a dull thud. He couldn’t bring himself to care about the residual blood spatter on the pillow, or about how his legs brushed Cas’ lower back as he indulgently stretched himself out, head still humming pleasantly.
necessity. That Sam enthusiastically volunteered for that kind of research was one of the more welcome perks of being brothers with a total geek. Lately though, Sam’s idea of unwinding had forgone books and defunct websites entirely, and mostly involved dive bars and cheap hookups. Dean
The black wings trembled and creaked overhead, cast in the same ethereal luminescence. Cas’ skin grew disturbingly transparent due to the azure blight searing through him, the iridescent flow of angelic power pulsing from his shuddering center towards the great appendages in long, glowing veins. The light seemed to be fading from his torso, replaced by those brittle, scaly crevasses tattooing themselves onto his frame in their wake. The wings were as giant willows; firm, unforgiving roots steadfastly sucking the life from where they’d been planted, leaving crumbling, ashen pieces of what was supposedly unbreakable behind. Dean suddenly cursed them beneath his breath, eyeing them hatefully.
His sulking was nevertheless interrupted by the muted sound of fabric being draped; a soft flutter of air. Before he could process it, a soft expanse of heated weight settled atop him as the bed lurched in all its rusted, squeaky glory. Feathers tickled his nose, but the smile cresting upon his face in the dark was for vastly different reasons.
The angel is grinning now, and so is Dean, and he decides not to question where that surge of courage came from. He instead decides that he might actually like flirting with Cas just a little. The exasperated wing-thwack he receives directly to the ass is more than a little encouraging, after all.
The angel’s mournful eyes were resolutely trained heavenwards as he spoke, and Dean was beginning to regret this entire attempt.
It’s so anticlimactic that Sam actually sighs out loud and rolls his eyes, not even bothering with the “finally” or the pretending to be surprised.
Dean and subsequently dispatching the demonic underlings that had sought to prove themselves by trussing up the Winchesters (seriously, hadn’t they learned their lesson yet?), he might have figured it out.
even was anymore. Normal for Dean fell anywhere on the spectrum between ordering a burger at a quaint roadside diner and stabbing some undead teenager through the brain. Sometimes, that could wear on a guy.
He opens the doors, and at first, he can’t see Cas. He looks around into the open space, regretting the fact that it’s night when he has to handle this issue.
But something about this did feel final to Dean. All that time being pulled along like a puppet of Heaven or Hell. It was just him now. Just Dean, living the consequences of his life. Just a person, like any other.
His recon had gone from being about getting Cas back to being about wrapping his head around all this.
“Deanie, will you come sit with me and Cassie?” He asked, his head tipped to the side. He looked like the walking incarnation of a puppy, and Dean folded instantly on a personal level.
“I leave you two alone for ten fucking minutes and you nearly get ganked by a fucking nest?” He throws the machete halfheartedly and it hits the floor with a clank, making both Cas and Sam jump slightly. Dean’s brows are furrowed, but neither of the other two answer for a moment.
“I’m not your Dean.” Dean said quickly, and Cas stepped back, surveilling him. Instantly, his demeanour changed. He was as Dean usually saw Cas. He stood straighter, his expression grew colder and less expressive. All that light and happiness drained out of his eyes.
Okay. Not-Dean was happy. Not-Dean was happy and domesticated and normal. Not-Dean was married. To Cas.
Still, being awake in the Empty wasn’t ideal. It wasn’t exactly what Castiel thought he would be doing. He had hoped for sleep. He knew the Empty wanted to return to sleep, and he hoped he would get to go along with that. That things could be quiet. That he could forget how vulnerable he had made himself, and how, as happy as he was to finally give Dean all that love he had inside of him, he was also extremely lonely.
Cas sighed, figuring it was all out there already for him anyway. It couldn’t get any worse by telling the truth. By just saying it out loud. “You saw what… what I want. You saw it in that djinn world in my head. I understand that you can’t give that, but… I don’t want to get my hopes up because you’re… feeling bad or curious or confused…”
Not-Dean was the enemy, because Not-Dean was keeping Cas in this place where he’d die. Besides, actual-Dean hadn’t been that happy in years. Hell, this Dean hadn’t even pretended to be that happy since before he went to Hell. He didn’t think Cas had ever known him so happy.
Well, well, well, Cas thought to himself, if it wasn’t the consequences to his own actions knocking on the door. Consequences he had truly never thought he would have to face. The beauty of his final confession was that it was final. He never had to deal with it, never had to see Dean let him down gently, never had to listen to the hunter tell him that this changed everything. He never had to get rejected by the first and only man Castiel had ever or would ever love.
Cas laughed then, as though it was hilarious, and Dean glanced over, smiling back at him almost instinctively, sort of proud to have elicited that full, happy sound from him.
He figured that Cas would’ve told Sam, but hearing Sam say it now feels totally different to Dean, and he has no idea how Sam will even react.
Maybe he had a crack in his chassis. But that crack was made of love and humanity and compassion. And Dean adored him for it.
“‘Cause she’s nice.” Again, Jack seemed to think this was incredibly obvious, though Dean couldn’t figure out how the hell that could be true. “And Benny is a shark because he’s cool and scary.” After a moment, he looked at Dean. “And you’re a tiger because tigers are my second favourite.”
“Yes.” Cas sounded stern, more like the version of himself he was when Dean first met him, “I forbid it. You’re not allowed to feel guilty for how it affected us. We’re worried about you.”
“I thought maybe… it was a world in which… you hadn’t lost everything.” Dean explained, “Because of us, I mean. That’s what I thought I was walking into… I had no idea…”
“You don’t… owe me this.” Cas said quickly, “And you don’t seem entirely confident in your decision to…”
“Heaven.” Jack supplied. “Chuck… didn’t believe in free will. He was a writer, and he wanted to dictate a story. Even in death, his characters were in a prison. Trapped in their own lives. I don’t want that.”
Cas half smiled a little, because it was sort of cute to see Dean so flustered and struggling for words. He wasn’t used to seeing Dean like that, and it was a softer side to a usually gruff and in-control man.
Before Dean closes his own eyes and tries to sleep, he looks up at the ceiling, mumbling in a voice quiet enough not to disturb either Cas or Miracle, but he realises quickly he needn’t have worried, they’re both out like a light. “Thanks, kid.” He breaths out, “Love you.”
“Remember that time I pulled my pants down and yelled pudding on that hunt?” Dean asked quietly, forcing a smile onto his face. It was Dean’s way. His primary instinct was to soften the blow as much as he could for his loved ones, rather than going through it all himself.
Really, he’s already made the call. He already knows what he’s going to say. At least kind of. He’s winging the specific words, but that’s sort of Dean’s aesthetic anyway. He says whatever’s on his mind and inevitably regrets it later.
“Sammy. You’re my little brother. You’re my best friend. For a long time, family was just you and me. Just a set of initials scratched into an impala. It was cereal in a motel room at two o’clock in the morning and pranks on the road to different hunts. But our family expanded. To include everyone else in the room… Someone really wise once told me family don’t end in blood. Our family never did. But if there’s one thing I’m really sure of… it’s that I couldn’t be happier to have Eileen joinin’ our family. Officially. ‘Bout time we had another female Winchester. And just remember, if you have a son, Dean or Deanna. Either works.” He flashed a grin, and he heard a few people whooping and cheering as he took a sip of his drink.
“Since I was like, twelve,” Sam admitted with a small smile, “Never knew how to bring it up. But uh… If you want to be with Cas, I think you should be. No one’ll ever know you better… or understand what it’s like for you more. Plus, he’s… he’s family already.” Sam seemed like he was treading very gently, and Dean couldn’t help but laugh. It was watery and weak, but a laugh nonetheless. “You deserve to be happy, Dean.”
Cas, for the most part, has barely done anything. He’s sat around, he’s tried drinking, though it does nothing for him. He’s tried to read, but it doesn’t help. He stares at that stupid etching of Dean’s initials for too long every day, and he knows Jack and Sam have seen him do it.
He was freezing though, so wherever he was, he should’ve brought a bigger coat. He wished Cas’s fantasy world could’ve at least involved the sun.
Dean has let him down in so many ways. He’s failed to show Cas how much he means. He’s failed in saving him. He’s failed in being a best friend even, he’s said unforgivable things too many times. Telling him to leave the bunker. Saying Cas was dead to him. Dean knows he never meant any of it, that he never, ever wanted to lose Cas. But he also knows himself well enough to know he has a tendency to lash out, to self sabotage. Especially when he’s grieving, especially when it’s about family. Dean would honestly give anything to go back. To fix it all, to be the kind of person Cas deserves in his life.
He’s adorable, Dean thinks, and that’s where the problem began. Bright blue eyes and a kind heart and an inquisitive mind. He had been so naive to the world when they met, despite his age, and Dean still remembers with fondness the way Cas’ defences slowly chipped away. Nights spent talking or car trips together. He remembers how empty his life had felt whenever they’d lost Cas, how he’d never been able to get over it. He remembers how losing Cas felt like losing a limb, and how he would wake up with the phantom sensation that Cas was still beside him, only to realise he was totally alone.
Standing in front of him in the same yellow jacket he often wore, with one hand held up at his side and a friendly hello.
It was Freedom. It was the things you loved. It was a home and a place to see your family again. That was what it always should have been. It should have been home, a place to find yourself and your love and your peace.
Just like that, Cas can’t take it anymore. Overwhelmed by all his emotion, he virtually stomps out of the barn, like a child having a tantrum.
“So, you all know my brother.” Dean held the glass up in front of himself, looking out over the little group of people. It had grown slightly larger than expected, but truly not by much. It was only ever small. “You all know the stories about us, the legends,” People laughed and Dean laughed along with them, “But what you don’t know is that Sam used to be short.” This drew out more of a laughter, not just from their guests, but from Sam and Eileen themselves.
Dean wasn’t ashamed to admit that it was difficult for him, that his life had taken such a sharp and intense shift in another direction.
He crept further down the hall, looking for either his own or Cas’s room. There was one that was clearly a spare, untouched and clean. It had Cas written all over it in its decoration; simple, clean, neat.
Later, when they walked back to the Castle, Dean had Jack thrown over his shoulder, hanging upside down while the child giggled wildly, ineffectually kicking at Dean.
“Don’t.” Cas was saying quickly, “Our son— our son is real. He’s yours. He has your eyes. Your freckles.”
Castiel still didn’t fully understand how Jack had swung this. He supposed he had all the power now, that what he said went. But maybe it was really just that the Empty wanted to sleep, and that Castiel had a habit of waking it. Either way, Castiel was allowed to leave, and the Empty was returned to sleep, per Jack’s promise.
Jack told him about how Dean and Sam were safe. How Dean had adopted a dog and called it Miracle. About how Dean was applying for a job and they were living safely in their homes. About how they were starting over.
The group of them, their family, have become so intrinsically linked to each other. It’s not normal, Cas supposes, but what about them is. They don’t have jobs and lives and homes and children and Christmas days. They have each other. They’ve only ever had each other. Whenever one of them was missing, they could never be whole.
He has no idea how long it’s been, but the fact that he’s here means it worked at least. Maybe he can go to sleep. He knows he fought his way out last time, but this is different. He’s made his peace with this as his ending. He figures his last act should be one of love rather than violence. He figures that’s a far nicer fate for him, and if he got to choose his own legacy, that’d be it.
Cas sees himself out, figuring this was his only real part of the plan. This is, essentially, what he hoped would happen. He wouldn’t have been mad is Sam had hit him, he knows Sam is struggling. That he’s weighed down by it all as much as Cas himself is, but when Cas settles into Dean’s bed that night, he finds that he can barely find the smell at all. He finds that the room feels emptier somehow, and the weight on his heart feels far heavier.
Sam and Cas both looked on the verge of crying, which only made Dean less comfortable about it all. Less confident in where this was going.
This is his true happiness. Leaving his family as okay as he possibly can, leaving them all knowing they were loved. By so many people, and so, so much, but never by anyone more than him.
“Dean didn’t kill him…?” Castiel suspected he was giving something away with this question, but then, Castiel didn’t actually know what Dean had told him. Maybe Jack knew already. Maybe he wouldn’t read anything into the question at all. After all, in the past, Dean was usually the one to take charge in such a way. He never wanted the burden of doing something so hard to be on Sam or Cas or Jack, he would rather take all that burden and blame and guilt on himself. That was something Chuck had known since the very beginning.
“I… I never really understood what love was growin’ up. I mean, not really. You know my Dad was never really there and when he was… we weren’t better off for it. I never really knew how to… how to do anything except to protect Sammy. I spent my whole life trying to protect, since I didn’t know how to love properly. Never could… say the words. Or even really understand the feelings. If I’m bein’ honest, I didn’t believe in any of that good stuff. Romantic love or… angels or Heaven or anything I know you’re s’posed to believe in. The only thing I had worth believing in was me and Sammy.” He can feel tears wetting his face all over again, and he thinks it’s all over now. Now that he’s started digging into this place, this place of self hating, of sheer, raw vulnerability, there’s no going back.
it feels like, Jack.” Cas corrected fondly, and he could hear Cas laughing a little as Jack let out a dramatic groan.
“I’m in love with you too.” Cas says quickly, and he’s trying to hide a smile, but he’s failing, because it’s bright on his face still. “Like, give up on Heaven and Hell in love with you.” He teases, and Dean wonders how he didn’t see that sooner? Cas is right to tease, it was right there. Still, Dean can’t resist.
Dean’s words must’ve given away that he had no idea what was going on, because she sighed. “It’s okay if you like him, y’know.”
He crept closer to the house, keeping away from windows. If he lived here, in Cas’s dream, Dean had to assume this was a better version of himself. Maybe wearing a cardigan and drinking tea, with none of the same chaotic, bloodthirsty energy Dean had never had a say in. At least that would be an advantage.
“For Jack.” He goes on, “The Empty told me… when I allowed myself to be truly happy, it’d come for me. In exchange for the kid.” His throat feels rough and painful, but Dean ignores it. He’ll be damned if he lets his stupid, fallible human body ruin this when they’re already running out of time.
Sam doesn’t ask any questions when Cas begins sleeping in Dean’s room. Maybe it’s an invasion of privacy, he isn’t sure, but Dean is gone and Jack didn’t stick around for them to ask him to bring Dean back. Besides, he now knows that Dean loved him. For years. And if this is the last of Dean he has, he wants to actually have it.
“I’m nearly forty, Dean.” He answered with a laugh as Dean pulled him into an affectionate headlock that sort of almost doubled as a hug.
They were forehead to forehead, nose to nose, and they appeared tangled up in each other. Not-Dean looked content and safe there, like he couldn’t possibly belong anywhere else.
There are more vampires than they realised there were going to be, and things go south relatively quickly. Sam is unconscious in the corner and while they’ve taken out more than half of the vampires, it’s still Cas vs three of them now.
Cas stood and he watched and he begged Jack to let him go, to let him save Dean Winchester one last time.
Sam rolled his eyes about him, “Thoughts about your best friend’s dream world having the two of you married, asshole. What do you think about that?”
At some point, Dean stirred, and rather than jumping awake with a knife and a scream, his eyes fluttered open, all green hues and long eyelashes. Cas took it as a testament to how comfortable they were together, to how much Dean trusted Cas to keep him safe and happy, and it made him smile.
But still, he hadn’t really been alone with Cas since it all happened, and they hadn’t had much time to talk. Any, really. Dean had about a thousand questions, but he had been trying hard to steer clear of the worst topics.
“Oh, no!” Jack is quick to fill in, though he still sounds like his excitable self. “I’m fine. I came here by choice.”
He came to care about Sam too, and others in their group, but never in the same way. At first, he attributed that to his and Dean’s bond. He attributed that to the fact that he had pulled Dean out of Hell and that he and Sam just didn’t have the same basis to their relationship.
So Cas spoke. “Rebar? Really?” He asked with a slow frown, “I left you alone for one week and you…” It would be easier to joke, or to be mad, but really, he just felt heartbroken. Dean didn’t deserve this. He didn’t deserve any of this. “You should’ve had a life. A family. A wife. Kids.”
Dean tells himself that he is toxic. That he hurts people. Dean has made too many mistakes. Dean has caused too many apocalypses. Dean’s life has always been about keeping his brother alive, since he was four years old-- and then, as an adult, it’s about saving his family. What is left of it after so long losing over and over again.
And so Castiel accepted it, because he had no other choice. But somehow, mourning Dean was worse than dealing with his own death. Because Dean was supposed to live. Dean was supposed to finally be free.
“You’re back, honeybee,” Cas said softly, crossing the room before Dean could even blink and kissing him. The kiss was surprisingly soft and gentle. Dean couldn’t remember his last real kiss, let alone one with real feeling. And, surprised as he was, Dean could feel it. Cas’s real feelings, poured into all of this. The look on his face, the gentle press of his lips, the pressure of a hand on his neck.
He stalks forward, and he’s only inches away from Dean when he talks again, poking Dean in the chest, probably too hard.
“Okay…” Dean croaked out, either unable or unwilling to elaborate. His own panic was only growing. The seriousness of this all started to set in.
Cas shook his head, “It isn’t that simple. Nothing with my family is. And I know it isn’t something you really understand but--”
Dean’s family had always been everything in the world to him, and he knew why now more than ever. They weren’t perfect. They weren’t functional. They weren’t undamaged and they weren’t special. Not anymore, anyway. They were just people. Just people who truly believed that they should leave the world better than they found it.
Castiel had been. Or rather, enjoying the side-effects of his altered state a little too much to acknowledge it as a more pressing issue before it was too late. It wasn’t like
Instinctively, Dean clenched every muscle in his body and attempted to release the angel’s wrists and ground himself, but he found that he couldn’t. He shot a terrified glare at Cas, who merely grinned in reply (the bastard), and tightened his hold on Dean’s forearms.
The lazy jerk finally stirred. He gurgled and choked awake, his impossible blue eyes striking Dean’s face like annoyed lasers. His expression seemed to show more irritation than any real suffering, though even that was saying something for the usually stone-faced angel. He had to be hurt pretty bad.
Cas’ tense voice barely registered over the clatter of the slammed door, but Dean was deeply relieved to hear it, nonetheless. The breath he'd been holding for hours finally escaped, and it was an effort to keep himself from trembling too hard. He kicked off his boots and dropped his duffel without ceremony, and hung up his coat beside the trench by the door. Soiled weapons clanked in cacophonous protest, but he’d just have to clean them later.
There’s a subtle crinkle in the angel’s posture at being acknowledged, as though he expected otherwise. He shrugs, but doesn’t turn. Hungry for distraction, Dean relishes the small movement. He maps out the tightness of Cas’ jaw, the solid line of those shoulders steeled in concern even as he sits quietly against the grimy tile. Cas is feigning calm as much as Dean is; it’s a familiar dance by now.
After a fitful night’s rest, Dean donned the most casual approximation of “aggressively blasé” he could muster before facing his brother in the kitchen. Predictably, Sam countered with his patented “concerned smirk” at him (honestly, how did he even-), but Dean cut him to the quick.
” the angel begins, and the finality in his tone informs Sam that his poor, whipped older brother is just done for, “that there are a great number of things you once thought
“I’m just saying Dean, you’re mother-henning so hard you’re gonna start laying eggs.  Cas probably just wants some space. He’s been around since before dinosaurs were just an idea and you’ve been nagging him…
Dean rested his elbows against his knees and worked at the copious knots at the back of his neck, mostly for lack of anything else to do in the awkward silence. He couldn’t remember the last time Cas had stayed so long, and it was ironically unsettling.
is what I was talking about,” Dean groused. “Ain’t good for business when we’re both constantly worryin' about each other.”
If anyone had informed Dean even 12 hours ago that he and Cas would be engaged in a mutual, 3AM scratching session on a grubby motel bed, he’d probably have stabbed them in the eye with a knife dipped in lamb’s blood. Still, it had been a long, weird night, even by the standards of the long weird nights he was used to. He still didn’t know what to make of the mess of emotions left in the wake of all this, and at this point, the solution either required copious amounts of beer or about 6 years of sleep.
He’d of course been going for ‘bitingly detached’ rather than ‘whining pre-schooler’, but it was what it was. He perhaps would have cringed at his own neediness had he the energy, but instead, he silently reckoned with the cold rush of disappointment as his reply soon came. It was in the form of Cas’ weight lifting off the end of the bed. Dean damned the tiny ember of hope that had treacherously lit in the hollow of his chest, now stamped out cold at Cas’ departure.
“Something about how the light gets filtered through the atmosphere as it crests the horizon,” the angel went on dreamily, “It’s one of God’s finest spectacles. Even better from the upper Thermosphere, actually.”
to fly,” was the explanation, bathed in tones of determined annoyance. “I’m not sure how long I will be ‘stuck’ like this,” he clarified, “but it’s become painfully clear to me that celestial flight is far different from physical lift. I know the physics of it by heart, down to the atomic structure of air molecules as they move, and I know that my Grace should compensate for the heaviness of a human body but I….” At this point, the endearing grimace was too much for Dean not to comment.
As he reaches Jack in the map room, he finds himself wondering if the past decade of barely-repressed pining was actually better than these jarringly-opened floodgates of unrestrained flirting, dirty jokes, and wow- LOUD smooching. (And dear god, how in the multiverse is it that he's able to
“Vamps, nothing seri-” he attempted, but Cas had lifted a hand to meet the hunter’s concern-knitted features. Dean froze, his pulse thundering in his ears and his cheeks burning, for some reason. Two fingers gently poked his forehead, but before Dean could bat them away in realization, the blissful relief cascaded through his body. Cas then proceeded to cough like emphysema was going out of style.
. And did Cas unexpectedly utter a sound in response that Dean would remember to his dying day? Shockingly, also
“Dammit Cas, it’s not that,” he scrambled peevishly, staring at the side of Cas’s crumpled expression.
the latter was enough to fill a couple of phone books, but they kept going. That was the important part:
Cas, for all his infinite celestial wisdom, seemed at a complete loss. Even while it was Dean who’d been forced to act like a horny schoolboy, it was Cas who was suddenly a rigid portrait of embarrassment.
Though pointless an effort it might be, Dean finally dabs a warm cloth over the wound festooning the angel’s chest. It fortunately already seems to be closing over, but he finds himself marveling at the exercise. At Cas here with him, allowing him his these intimate, long-sought comforts.
They lapse into silence for a while, staring out at the horizon while they enjoy their brew. Cas stands as close as he usually does, despite the tripled forty foot wingspans crowning him. Three wings are carefully angled around Dean’s frame, meticulously careful not to touch him. Dean finds himself sort of wishing they would. He can feel their sumptuous warmth radiating from all around, somewhat like the comforting aura of a fireplace… or a blast furnace really, if angelic strength has anything to do with it. He feels safe and protected, berthed in their shadow.
His meandering words were met only with thick silence. Curious, he glanced over at Cas just in time to catch him with his eyes closed, head tilted slightly back. Even in the relative darkness, there was no mistaking the blissful expression lighting his features. Dean’s stomach coiled, propelling a draught of heat which reached his face (and elsewhere) in record time. He didn’t pull away. Despite his trepidation, it was nice to indulge in something comforting for a change.
“C’mon angel, just humour me. Flap those chicken wings nice an’ easy, and then gradually Grace it up.”
letting some douchebag egomaniacs from above, below and between dictate life on Earth, slimy as it could be. Since this was his cursed lot, he’d decided to keep pushing back in any way he could, kicking and screaming and gritting his teeth, and punching the gods right in their ugly, mysterious faces. It was vulgar but effective. And if the result was that the blissfully ignorant masses perched on his shoulders still retained their free will, well... On most nights, that kept Dean warm enough.
There wasn’t any warning before the electric blues were upon him again, launching tendrils of current down to his very bones. Dean was pondering whether or not Cas did that on purpose when the eyes in question began flashing again, from cold brimstone to the usual Cas blue (which, to Dean’s mind, someone should name a coloured pencil after). The effect was eerie, as though the angel himself were experiencing some sort of brown-out. He looked away quickly, seemingly self-conscious.
The end of the sentence was left to be devoured by the merciful roar of the Impala’s engine. Sam however, wasn’t so sparing.
The sentence rambled into silence, though Dean knew too well what he’d insinuated. It was a feeling he was very well-versed in.
“Hello, Dean,” he said anticlimactically, once he realized where he was. That low, sandpaper voice stripped away Dean’s anxiety in an instant. He actually chuckled a little but the feeling of relief was fleeting, making way for something much more typical.
yelled in a very masculine tone, his feet swinging around in panic as he tried to forcefully pull the angel back down. Like anyone could pull an
he surmised ridiculously, as his brain struggled to process the astonishing sight. The numerous miracles he'd seen Cas perform over the years seemed swallowed up by the sheer presence of these symbols, and it took Dean aback for a few moments.
of his usual de-escalating mantras were helping to reign in his near-Biblical levels of fangirlish admiration at this point. It was like watching an angelic Harlequin novel unfold in front of him, and he
Dean could be opaque sometimes, but he wasn’t completely dense. Just not completely brave, in matters of what he considered to be his undeserving heart.
“Let me at least help, then,” he finally decides, hastily dragging the angel to his room before the implications can catch up to him.
Dean felt his stomach lurch as he took in Cas’ state more closely from this new vantage. His “holy accountant” get-up was mostly shredded thanks to the wings’s seemingly unexpected appearance, but also due to what seemed like the remnants of battle. Long slashes ran across his chest, where an ethereal blue light leaked from the disruptions. Grace. Bizarrely, an alarming amount of what seemed like human blood was
Forcing him to relinquish his cozy resting place, a cough rattled through Cas until more blood ran from his lips. In a quickfire gesture that almost seemed self-conscious, he unceremoniously wiped it off on his torn tan sleeve. Unthinkingly, Dean reached through the curtain of feathers for the tissues suspiciously-placed at his bedside and wiped away the residue dribbling from the corner of the angel’s mouth. Now, he’d done so out of concern - he was certain of it - but upon noticing how the plump flesh of Cas’ lips pliantly stretched beneath his fingers, he -
grabbing onto his soul somehow, like some sort of metaphysical lamprey. Of course, he wouldn’t have put it past himself to have an out-of-body experience about kissing Cas, honestly, but this was something else… something
Dean might occasionally have proven dense when dealing with Cas’ confusing signals, but he wasn’t obtuse enough to ignore the way Cas’ arms had squeezed in ever so slightly, or how there was now a gentle scuff of stubble pressed to the joint of his neck as they wafted on the breeze, to and fro. His heart swelled, and not just from the height. But before he could deal with any of this, with the heat in his gut, with the dizzying throb of hunger and affection in his heart, he had to know. Had to hear it. Dean liked things simple. Killing, screwing, eating, driving, he liked it all as straightforward as possible, even though his association to Cas was anything but.
Dean would have laughed but he was too drunk on trying to map out Cas’ pulse point (if he even had one) with his nose.
“So that was. Uh. Th-that was.” He never finished the sentence. God, he was going to hate himself later. More so than usual. He spent a few more seconds desperately contemplating what to do with his hands and ultimately failing, because his fingers kept travelling to his stubble-scoured lips.
Tonight the years bear down upon him, heavy with endless twisting loops of regret, violence and loss. The near-missed opportunities flash before his eyes in merciless focus, scrubbing his habitual safeties away. He lets himself falter, for once.
“Cas, what the hell?” he balked while the angel hummed thoughtfully. His eyes were still doing the odd overloaded transformer thing, like Cas had swallowed a plasma globe.
Dean squeaked in protest but had learned long ago not to argue with Charlie, lest she choose an even worse outcome. After all, had he not complained, he might have gotten to keep his precious flannel. Regardless, it was too late and the merciless tyrant had finally peeled it off him, leaving him feeling all kinds of exposed.
, he thought of setting his hand on fire for how unscrupulously it had betrayed him. He’d need that hand later however, for Reasons (perhaps involving suspiciously-placed tissues), so he resigned himself to the blush spreading over his features. For his part, Cas hadn’t protested.
Wordlessly, he beckons Cas to follow. The angel does -almost instantly- but forgoes sitting altogether. He somehow manages to stuff himself, wings and all, onto the couch and onto Dean, with one of the glorious feathery sails hanging loosely off to the side. Dean would find it almost hilariously blasphemous if his flustered heart weren’t so preoccupied with trying to shatter his ribs.
“Well, as you said,” Cas sighed eventually, the resignation evident in his tone, “you got to me in time.”
And so it was that Castiel, Majestic Seraph of the Lord, Sacred Warrior of Heaven and Upsettingly Attractive Michelangelo Painting Personified, landed with a muted
A soothing hand was on Dean’s forehead then, and Dean implored himself not to melt into it while the cooling hum of grace cleared his brain. Amazing how that stuff could either cure all your ills, or raze an entire postal code in an instant. Tomato, tomahto.
Palms frame his face, fingers sift through his wet hair. Cas kisses him with a reverence he doesn’t deserve and Dean breathes for the first time in hours, maybe years.
