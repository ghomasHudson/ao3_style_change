“Breathing got easier,” he said as he closed his eyes, letting out a sigh in his deep baritone voice.
"Mycroft? What is it?" Mrs Hudson said, slightly irritated.
“Suicide of Famed Detective”
“Don’t want to,” Sherlock said stubbornly like a child.
John smiled contentedly as he leaned out of the bed to kiss Sherlock tenderly on the lips. As he leaned back, Sherlock cupped his hands on his face as he kissed him again, letting go reluctantly.
“From this day forward until death do us part.” They said in unison.
“Oh- r-right,” Sherlock uttered, clumsily turning around to close the door.
Third person POV
“No, you can’t, I’m sorry, Sherlock, you’re not calm enough,” Lestrade explained.
That’s it. I was going to kill myself. Once and for all.
Throwing on his dressing gown, he sauntered down the stairs, fixing his hair with his hand. There was Sherlock, with his violin, facing the window and his dressing gown floating to the beat of his footsteps. He ended the song with a flourish and turned around to see John gaping at him.
“I’m calling an ambulance. You can’t walk to the hospital like this.” John said frantically, still soothing Sherlock who was shaking.
“Don’t want to.” Sherlock muttered obstinately.
“Since when did you dance?” John shot back.
He doesn’t want to be with you.
I scraped the soft bedding beneath me, I wanted to get up. But John was approaching me, reaching out with some.. something.
“Sherlock- please, wake up,” John said, gritting his teeth, trying not to sob.”
Do not show sentiment.
“Okay,” John whispered, gently tipping the cup.
“Well, looks like we’re stuck here for two hours,” John said as he turned to Sherlock, who flashed him a grim smile.
"I thought you hated nature," John said.
Sherlock impatiently shook his phone as the line rung.
“I will,” John mumbled as he laid his head gently on Sherlock’s.
He’s in this flat.
Sherlock bustled in the kitchen, doing one of his experiments, humming Bach as he made himself tea. John shoved open the door with his shoulder, carrying groceries.
Too tired to react, he let John put his hand down by his side.
“And that’s how you waltz,” Sherlock said, letting go of John’s hand.
“Gosh, you’re a good teacher,” John gushed, plopping on his armchair.
“YOU, AND ME!”
Where am I.
“Yes,” John said before chuckling.
“Can we go?” Sherlock said as John finished the paperwork for him.
Right after the door clicks shut, I empty the contents of the plate into a wad of newspapers, but I stop at the peas. They reminded me of John, who always became annoyed because I never ate peas, which always leads to me leaving the peas untouched. I remember him trying to shovel them into my mouth once, when we were in the flat alone. We ended up laughing as the peas ended up all over the floor and many of them were smushed by our shoes. We spent the afternoon scraping the floor clean.
You are doing this for your own good.
“You are very aggressive, Mister Holmes,” John said playfully.
“Sit beside me.” Sherlock hoarsely whispered.
Why am I here?
“They sound like that to me,” John said as he went into the kitchen, and started to make tea.
“Room for two, please,” John said to the innkeeper.
“Christ! You’re cold,” John said as he flicked into doctor mode, checking Sherlock’s pulse.
“Am I really,” Sherlock said, secretly bursting of happiness.
“I’m dying to,” Sherlock said as he fingered John’s face. He tried to lean in, but John pressed his finger on his lips.
The paramedics came trudging up, John gripping Sherlock’s floppy, unmoving arm, as they strapped him to a defibrillator and shocked him.
This is the end of the story, I hope you liked it! Check out more of my works if you have time!! Thank you for taking your time reading this, I really appreciate it!
“Oh, since forever,” Sherlock said, a charming smile on his face.
————-
“You behave, and sit down, before I call your brother here,” Mrs Hudson demanded as she took her phone out. “No…” Sherlock mumbled as he continued stumbling towards his room. Suddenly, his knees buckled, as he took a lunge for the wall, blinking hard to get rid of the black dots that riddled his eyesight. He leaned on the wall as he slowly slid down, losing consciousness.
Sherlock plodded out of bed, throwing on his dressing gown.
Falling onto the floor, I scraped the floorboard with my fingernails, with so much effort that the floorboards let out a squeak.
“Trust me,” John said, as he removed Sherlock’s pants and slipped dry ones on him, replacing the wet shirt with a soft t-shirt.
Had to inhale.
“Yes, I sure did mister,” John answered, tipping his head down awkwardly, giggling.
Without hesitation, he pulled Sherlock out of the tub, his face pale blue,  checking his pulse. Irregular.
“Now people will definitely talk,” John muttered, looking at Sherlock, who was still supported by his arm.
Desperately trying to get oxygen, I inhaled more and more, only feeling the painful, heart wrenching pain that stabbed me again and again, each stab more deeper and forceful. I felt dizzy.
“Yes Sherlock.” John said, rolling his eyes. Deductions. Ugh.
“I think I’m gonna die, John, what if it falls down? What if.. what-“ Sherlock squeaked, his voice breaking.
Blinking his eyes, he read the message again and again. Immediately, he dashed out of the house, hoping that this was a ruse to get his attention.
"T-thank you," Sherlock added sheepishly.
Running as quick as he could, he tried to reach Moriarty. But the faster he went, the faster Moriarty disappeared farther and farther away.
He is dead.
“H-how long was I asleep for?” Sherlock mumbled, his eyes fluttering open to see the meadow swathed in mid-darkness, the setting sun glowing over the horizon.
“I- I missed you. It couldn’t wait. I had a- a nightmare…” Sherlock said ruefully.
I open my eyes but I can't open them more than a slit. I see someone in white.
“You and me,”
Chokingly, John started to weep, sniffing and letting his tears drop onto Sherlock’s unmoving body, wiping away his tears with the back of his hand.
“Drink this, it’s honey with water,” John said, as he bent down and gently held the cup to Sherlock’s lips.
“Oh- um- yeah of course we’re getting single beds… yeah!” John said, laughing awkwardly.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Why did you do that," John said his voice starting to break.
"You're okay now," John said, the tears glistening in his eyes. Not tears of despair, but of overwhelming joy.
The white lights of the hospital blinded him. Nurses and doctors bustled around in front of him, as he nervously rapped his fingers on his lap. He hated it here.
“Mr. Holmes, you may go in now,” the doctor’s voice boomed, a tinge of concern in his voice.
“I hope you’re feeling better now,” John said as he shifted the stack of pillows that Sherlock laid on, and tucked him in with a warm blanket.
“It’s going to be fine. It’s fine. I promise.” John assured as he wrapped himself around Sherlock’s shivering body as the paramedics came trudging in.
“Come on,” John beckoned, pulling him up from the bath.
“Yes- I think so, I wasn’t there,”
“Why are you always embarrassed about our relationship in front of other people? Why can’t we be a couple?” He shouted.
"You almost drowned, Sherlock," John said calmly. Taking a good look at John's face now that he adjusted his eyesight, he saw John's bloodshot eyes, rimmed with dark circles. He must've not slept for some time.
Then my vision snapped black.
Oh John, why did you die? Why did you leave me alone? Why?
“When was the last time you had a bath? Or ate?” John shouted from the kitchen.
“Yeah, he came in unexpectedly,” John said, anxious. “I don’t know what’s wrong with him, he’s shivering and wheezing and pale,”
Rushing towards him, Sherlock enveloped John in his coat, and pressed his scarf onto his abdomen.
“What is it?” Mycroft said as he warily stepped into the investigation room, the bags under his eyes dark, the creases on his forehead increased. Lestrade’s staff around multiple tables, investigating, searching for evidence.
After Sherlock finished his drink, John gently unbuttoned Sherlock’s shirt, putting it aside.
Just breathe. What’s damn wrong with you? Go to sleep. He scolded himself in his mind. He gulped down some Aspirin and tried to go to sleep.
In a fury, I felt the emotions swirl in my body. Anger. Uselessness. Helplessness. Loss. Depression.
"it MUST'VE been that, Sherlock, no matter how smart you are, you will not know better than me in anything medical!" John demanded.
The searing pain in my neck was increasing, like fire searing into my skin, tearing it apart.
“John?” Sherlock hollered, scouting the living room, then the kitchen, then John’s room.
I stood on the stool, a badly made noose that I could barely slip my head through.
“Look- Sherlock, there are neighbours and-“ John bickered.
“Actually- do you want to learn how to do a dip?” Sherlock asked, setting his intense eyes on him.
Dragging his blanket and himself to the sofa, he tried to ignore the pain his his chest as he started coughing, trying to stifle it with his blanket.
John unlocked the door of 221B, the door squeaking. Everything was just as it was before they left, Mrs Hudson must’ve not dared to move anything.
“No.”
“Oh dear, I’ve got your friend,”
“Dr- drown yourself.” John stuttered, putting down his book, locking eyes with Sherlock.
“It’s time to take your medication, Mr. Holmes,”
“You’ll never catch me,” Moriarty said in a sing-song voice.
“That was lovely, play that more, not those screeching noises that you play more than enough of,” John complimented.
“Oh my god,” John said as he cursed repeatedly under his breath.
"We'll stay here for the night," Sherlock butted in.
Do not show sentiment.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, that’s not good, you’re breathing too fast, way too fast since you got here,” John stated. “Sherlock, look at me,” John said.
“Your cheeks are very red, and that cough- you are not okay,” John said, placing his hand on Sherlock’s forehead, with Sherlock too tired to even intervene.
“Hello? What emergency services do you require?”
“I am informed that you are very close to John Watson,”
“Always,” John said. “Go to bed, and rest. You are not going to work or going to think about it whatsoever. You need to rest. Alright?” He kissed him on the forehead, caressing his face with his warm hands.
Plopping onto an armchair, Sherlock felt tired, feeling his heart pound against his chest rapidly. He put his hand on his chest, his breathing turning into uneven gasps for air, as if someone was seizing his throat.
He headed down the road back to 221B, hearing one set of footsteps clicking in that lonely alleyway, rather than two sets that arrived and should have left together.
“Please don’t, I NEED YOU,” Sherlock cried, wrapping himself closer to John who was getting colder and colder.
"John's dead."
“I found cocaine.. on that day, on the floor. And these marks, cuts.. I’m sorry you had to go through all of this.. it’s my fault. I’m supposed to be looking after you… I’m sorry,” John said, his lower lip trembling, sniffling as the tears fell from his face, dripping onto Sherlock’s face.
“It’s a flower crown,” John replied as he weaved the last flower into the wreath, gently settling it on Sherlock’s head. “You look beautiful.” John said as he fixed Sherlock’s fringe.
“Okay,” Sherlock whispered, getting up and taking John’s hand gently, slipping his fingers through his.
“Stop crying, let’s push these two beds together, alright?” John reassured, weaning Sherlock off him as they pushed the beds together.
Sherlock turned his head to see John crashing through the door, exasperated.
“I’m- sorry I scared you..” Sherlock muttered, his gaze turning to John’s eyes, the blue in his irises enhanced as his tears glimmered in the dim room.
Sherlock opened the door, his face drained to a shade of white.
At last.
“I wish it was now.” Sherlock scowled.
“Yes, let’s go home. Mycroft provided us with a car,” John said as he entwined his fingers with Sherlock’s.
He won’t come here anyways.
Without comment, I slipped into my room and closed the door with a bang. Though it was summer, I slipped on my suit jacket so the blood stains didn’t show.
He’s moved on.
Sherlock fingered John’s bandaged hand, letting go of John.
"Sherlock?" She whispered, slowly walking towards him.
"I've been meaning to say that too- and I'll say them now," Sherlock declared, as he laid his head on John's shoulder, and whispered in his ear,
“Mm,” Sherlock mumbled, following John into the house.
“You can wear this for a bit,” John said as he took down his bathing robe from the rack and covered Sherlock with it.
"This is- nice," Sherlock said, inching closer to John.
Snapping awake after falling unconscious, I let out a yelp as the water from the bathtub overflowed and splashed onto me. Impulsively, I slammed the tap shut, the excess water trickling down to the full tub of water. Too high to care, I sunk myself into the water, ripping off my coat.
Sherlock acquiesced with a sigh, pulling John up the stairs to 221B, helping him shed his suit jacket and his own coat before sandwiching him against the door to the sitting room. He wasted no time in nipping at lips, licking his way into John’s mouth, his hands grabbing at any part of John he could reach. The man went limp beneath him, letting Sherlock take complete control, only pausing once in awhile to remind the taller man to let them both get some air. He was mostly staring at the ceiling in awe as his husband laved his neck in wet, loud kisses, his body jerking when Sherlock bit down on his collarbone.
“Please, god, Sherlock, I don't think I can keep this up any longer,” John pled, and so Sherlock stood, wiping his mouth clean with the back of his hand. He pulled his husband the short distance over to the sofa, positioning him so he was lying on his back, his head supported on the arm. “Ah, not the bed then?”
Sherlock could feel John's cock already filling back to full mast, beating down the surprise at the nonexistent refractory period to make way to the self-satisfaction of potentially giving John his second orgasm in less than an hour. The movement of their bodies served to provide adequate friction to the erection sandwiched between them, prompting Sherlock to make the slightest angle adjustment, bringing the head of his cock to press against John's prostate with each thrust.
John pulls back, puts some distance between them. His hand shoots up to muffle his voice as a fresh wave of tears glisten and threaten to overflow.
John, seems to have worked it out all by himself and instead appears to be on the verge of another nervous breakdown as he says, “
“Almost there,” John promises, kissing Sherlock long and hard, sucking on his bottom lip and bringing his mouth around to nip on Sherlock's earlobe and then making his way down the strong line of that jaw to press a firm kiss on the freckle near the base of that pale, sensuous throat.
Well, he and John aren’t together yet, per se, but maybe after tonight, their relationship may - or may not - officially cross the threshold from platonic to romantic. Sherlock would be lying to himself if he says he didn’t feel any different at the thought of being in a romantic relationship with John.
, should alarm him - well, it doesn’t matter now, does it?
And the cherry on top of the cake? He is bleeding out, alone, with no way of calling for help.
Sherlock picks at his pasta with a fork, his face flushed with slight embarrassment. “I said something about the Work and myself.”
And because whatever they had was so new and utterly
It is blissfully quiet in his mind palace, Sherlock realises, as he stares down the endless corridor lined with doors on each side.
were the words, a clap of thunder in the quiet of Sherlock’s hospital room.
And yes, it was raining, but Sherlock had calculated that precipitation was going to increase by 15.53% in the next 10 minutes, and he
“John-” Sherlock cuts in, wanting badly to rip his own hair out.
And, as usual, send me feedback on how I'm doing. Any form of criticism keeps me striving to give you all my best I can offer in this story. Much love to everyone <3
His eyes get to work immediately, scanning through the first paragraph - wait. He pauses, rereads from the beginning. He scans the words above it to confirm what he thought he was reading.
“Wait, wait, Sherlock - where are you going? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!” he holds tight to those narrow hips. “I wasn't making fun of you, alright, it's just.. You're
And and! I am always open to criticism! Two months away from this fic may have set me off plot-wise, things may not make sense or are not realistic. I've never claimed to be writing my John and Sherlock as perfectly in character as in canon sooooooo don't be afraid to shoot me a comment below so as to steer me in the right direction, yeah? :)
“How does it feel?” Sherlock prompted. It was their first time using a plug on either on them, so he had to ask out of concern for John’s comfort.
"You're not getting our daughter a hazmat suit," John narrowed his eyes and Sherlock smirked.
"She has a fever. And it's only gonna get worse from here." John sighed, letting Rosie rest her head back on sherlock.
"How do you feel?" Sherlock asked.
She nodded, sitting up on the bed and waking up her dad in the process. "What happened?" his speech was incoherent and his curls were sticking up in all places. John was so in love.
John nodded. "Yes, I am. She's in good hands," she nodded before passing Rosie's backpack to John who took it and muttered a quick "Thank you."
"I love you," Sherlock yawned, kissing Rosie's forehead then John's lips once more.
The drive home was short and loud -- as are most car rides with his daughter. While Rosie was showing the symptoms of someone coming down with the flu, she still somehow had way too much energy in her.
"I'm meeting with a suspect tomorrow — a potential serial killer. I can't get the flu," he said as if it was the most obvious answer to that question.
Her eyes snapped open, "But I don't have one."
"Yeah, I figured," the nurse chuckled awkwardly. "You're a doctor right?"
"Good, until I started feeling icky," John could hear the frown in her voice.
"Wake up, baby. You have to take this medicine before you can fall asleep."
He set down the pen in his hands and picked up the phone. He recognized the number as Rosie's school and it was confirmed when the person on the other line answered.
Sherlock had a habit of sneaking out of bed while John was asleep to work on cases. John's used to it by now, but he always had to make sure that while Sherlock wasn't getting eight hours of sleep every night, he was at least getting
"Papa's wearing a helmet suit!"
Sherlock snorted, turning his head to look at John, "I have a guy."
"How are you feeling love?" He asked as they made their way up the stairs.
he pushed the door open and was met with his five-year-old daughter laying on a small bed, a hand in her stomach and the other on her forehead.
John paused. "Yes, this is he."
The nurse looked mortified as Rosie sighed dramatically, resting her head on John's shoulder and he quickly said, "She's joking of course. She's never seen a dead body before."
Pulling up in the school parking lot, John decided to send Sherlock a text letting him know he was picking up Rosie, not knowing if he was home or still currently working on a case with Lestrade.
Rosie would be getting a hazmat suit for her birthday.
Rosie turned her head and sat up on the bed. She was smiling but John could see that she was slightly paler than usual. He reached forward to touch her forehead before picking her up in his arms.
After her bath, Sherlock carried Rosie to their room and dressed her while John headed to the kitchen to make some soup for her. He came back to a sleeping Rosie and Sherlock while a random episode of SpongeBob played in the background.
"No I couldn't finish all of it," she said sadly.
"You need to get some sleep, love. Or else no interview for you tomorrow," he said softly. "And tell me where in the world you got a hazmat suit from."
"Daddy," Rosie cried and John's heart ached a little. It was never a good feeling seeing your child cry while ill and not being able to do anything.
"And may I ask why?"
The school wasn't far from the clinic and neither was 221b Baker Street. After a lot of consideration for Rosie and their future, he and Sherlock decided that Baker Street was the best place to raise her-- at least until they decided it was time to grow their family. Which John was hoping would be soon.
"Sorry, we fell asleep. I'm positively knackered," he said softly, letting out a small yawn.
"She has to eat," John said, taking a seat at the edge of the bed with the bowl of soup in his hand. Rosie sat up and scooted closer to him while sherlock gently rubbed her back.
He placed the water in Sherlock's gloved hands and watched Sherlock gently brought it up to his daughter's lips as she sipped half of the cup. It was quiet for a while, as sherlock held the cup in front of her and John sat in a chair facing the two.
"And how was school?"
"Do you still need to throw up?" she shook her head. John sighed, picking her up and setting her down in the tub gently just as Sherlock walked inside the bathroom, dressed in normal clothes.
When he came back, the two scooted to the edge of the bed and there was a spot for him. He smiled and made his way into the queen-sized bed, giving Rosie's hand a squeeze and Sherlock a peck on the lips.
John found the medical kit and took out the thermometer. He turned around and saw Rosie sitting on Sherlock's lap at the kitchen table, her head resting against the yellow material covering Sherlock's chest while he rubbed her back.
The door opened before he even got a chance to take the keys out of his pocket and John was met with his husband in a hazmat suit.
John just smiled and nodded along to everything she said thinking about how she was so much like Sherlock. She could go on and on for hours about all types of nonsense but she could also shut down for just as long. John absolutely loved every single similarity between the two.
Rosie was still crying but her sobs softened as John held her. He carefully sat her on the counter while he turned on the water, making sure it was the right temperature.
"Oh Daddy, I'm dying," she said.
Making his way through a long, narrow corridor and into a room marked
"Do I even want to know?" John asked.
The three laid in comfortable while SpongeBob and Patrick's nonsensical chatter filled the room with Rosie's soft snores soon following.
She ate about five more spoonfuls before she declared she was full. John wasn't going to push because she might get sick again so he took the soup back to the kitchen leaving Sherlock to give her the medicine.
"Daddy?" Rosie whispered, slowly opening her eyes.
Watson was Sherlock's nickname for her, but every once in a while, John would use it. Even though it was technically
"Hmm," Sherlock said. "I do recall someone's birthday coming up if I'm not mistaken."
"My tummy hurts but I feel fine," she replied.
It was a slow day at the clinic. Ever since he started his own practice, his job as a doctor has felt slightly more fulfilling. He absolutely loved that it gave him more time to spend with his family and he still had time to occasionally help his husband on whatever outrageous case he needed help with.
"Baby," John said sadly reaching forward to remove her from Sherlock's lap and standing up on the hardwood floor. Sherlock got up from the chair and began to remove the ridiculous costume as John took off Rosie's soiled clothes. "Let's get you in the bath okay?"
"Is she alright?" John asked, an uneasy feeling settling in the pit of his stomach. Rosie did seem a bit warm that morning but he waved it off as she still seemed her usual chatty and lively self while chugging down orange juice at the breakfast table.
And as an answer, he got a lap full of vomit.
John chuckled and shook his head fondly at his daughter. "I wouldn't say
"Okay, I'm on my way," he took off his lab coat and made his way to his car, turning the keys into the ignition.
Watson," The ventilated voice said. Sherlock moved out the way to let the pair in and John's eyes never left his husband.
In response, he got a grunt from Sherlock who pulled Rosie's sleeping body closer to him.
John snorted because sure, 'decomposing corpses' she can pronounce but not 'Hazmat'.
"I have her clothes ready in our room. I figured she could watch SpongeBob in there instead of the living room," John smiled, taking the purple washcloth and dipping it in the water to wash Rosie.
"I'm calling about Rosamund Watson-Holmes. She's feeling a little under the weather and has asked to call you."
"I'll see you in a few days, Rosie. Get plenty of rest and stay hydrated."
"Sherlock?"
"My tummy hurts, but I'm okay."
Rosie was still sniffling, her eyes closed as she leaned into her father's touch, "I'm sorry I got sick all over your helmet suit, Papa."
John was already out the door by the time the lady, the school nurse he was guessing, finished her sentence.
"Three whole hours. Can you believe your Dad?" John snorted, looking at Rosie and pointing the spoon at Sherlock behind her. She was quiet but that got a small giggle out of her.
He’d watched, eyes widened in genuine surprise, as John admitted to having cheated on Mary.
, over and over, waiting for Sherlock to catch up, and when his lover starts rutting against John’s thigh on his own, John lets go, holds tight to those bony hips and slots his face under Sherlock’s to press his nose into sweaty skin and inhale the sweet, slightly spicy, musky scent that is unmistakably
Sherlock blushes even more at the directness of that statement, but he gathers himself to say what he knows John wants to hear. “He probably doesn’t, mainly because he hasn’t asked if I’d have him as my boyfriend, yet.”
The two men scrambled to get out the car, John hissing as the movement jolted the plug inside him. He barely managed to get the door open, throwing himself forward to waddle in an ungainly way to the front steps, hands fumbling to find the keys in his pocket and open the door. Sherlock followed closely behind, but not before knocking on the driver's window and throwing a wad of cash at the suited chauffeur.
He sees Sherlock’s face from yesterday afternoon, the normally unsmiling face riddled with crinkles old and new, a small upturn at the corner of his mouth betraying a small, fond smile. His eyes were alight with fear, uncertainty, but his arms where they were wrapped around John’s shaking form were steady and protective.
“I don’t want to talk about it. Please, just- leave it.”
“Ah, I see. It is that John Watson, then. He’s your boyfriend, you say?” John quips. “Lucky bastard.”
“Oh.. okay. Rosie’s all sorted, already bathed her a short while ago.” Molly gets to her feet, reaching out for her bag.
“No war out there is of higher importance than your welfare, brother mine,” Mycroft replies, his voice subdued, as if it pained him so to express something as trivial as sentiment.
“John!” Sherlock whines, pouting and trying to wriggle his way out of John's grasp.
He watched - no, more like
Their thrusting has now increased speed, and John can feel himself hurtling towards the precipice, he is almost there, right at the very edge. Sherlock is moaning little “
“-love you-”
Sherlock nods, too out of breath with arousal to speak. He squirms against John’s hold, hips moving in minute thrusts, seeking friction on his own aching cock.
While Sherlock works to comfort his friend, his eyes take in every minute detail: John’s eyes, though already red from crying, look more tired than Sherlock’s ever seen him. His normally tidy, slicked back hair is in disarray, as if John had been running his hands through them again and again; The worry lines where they decorate his familiar face are more pronounced, his mouth pulled in a deep grimace, as if every part of him are hurting.
John reaches out once more for his left hand, and Sherlock lets him.
"Bleeding-! Yes you could have at least said that!" John splutters.
John makes the decision then, that he needs to get his act together if he ever wishes to continue being the father Rosie deserves in her life. If he and Sherlock were never to reconcile, the very least he can contribute to this life is to be there for his daughter, to be her pillar of support through thick and thin.
I feel like I've let you guys down with the huge delay, but a promise was a promise, and I promised I would finish this story.
“Hey. Sherlock,” John drops a kiss atop the detective’s nose. “My love. Do you really want to know?”
please.
Sherlock could only watch, unmoving in his chair, as John Watson fell apart in front of his very eyes.
“He sounds like an interesting fellow.”
“Thanks Molls. Let me know how Sherlock is doing in a couple of hours yeah? I was planning to get everyone together tomorrow for a small celebration - did you know it’s his birthday?”
“Forget it, John. Pretend it never happened.”
“I've got you,”
Apologies for the way-overdue second chapter. I know I have a history of leaving works incomplete, but I sincerely want to see this one through to the end. Personal life, you know. It was being piss poor the last few weeks.
Sherlock winces at the alarming tone in John’s voice. Breaking eye contact through the mirror, he attempts to escape through the bathroom door that opens to his bedroom, only to have his plan thwarted as John plants himself in his way, his eyes burning with intensity and his lips pinched tight in barely restrained rage.
Satisfied, John pulls his fingers out, adding a bit more lube to his eager cock before laying a gentle hand on Sherlock's hips to get him into position. Settling on his knees, he drapes himself fully on top of his lover - John has to pause to absorb this new piece of information - to mouth at the back of that long neck.
Slowly, John mirrors his lover, pulling his legs up to kneel on the sofa, closing the distance between them. He reaches out and takes Sherlock’s free hand, the ring in the other splendid and elegant in its beauty; his eyes are shiny with unshed tears, and Sherlock struggles to keep in the emotions threatening to burst out of his chest any moment now.
. “C- can’t wait till we get home this time huh?” he grinned weakly, letting loose a small moan as Sherlock’s small thrusts coincided with a particularly firm press of their hands against his groin. John’s other hand was shaking, the umbrella sheltering them starting to sway unsteadily.
“I can’t possibly argue with that, John,” Sherlock chuckles, a welcome warmth blooming in his chest and spreading through the rest of his body, leaving his extremities tingling. At their feet, Rosie thumps her hands impatiently, sending more baking flour everywhere. John grins at the sight, bending down to pick up his inquisitive daughter, seemingly unbothered at getting his clothes in a mess in the process. He croons to her and she answers with her typical baby talk, patting John’s cheek with a flour-caked hand until half of his face is ghostly white.
John stares at Mycroft, the twinge in his shoulder flaring up out of nowhere. He clenches his left fist, trying to dispel the ache.
Minutes passed. Just before he succumbed to endorphins and the deep pull of sleep, John Watson reached out to grab the sketch, and blindly held it up for Sherlock to see. “Do I get your approval?” he slurred, only to find that a snore answered him.
“Oh my god, John.”
, Sherlock tells himself, certain yet unconvinced.
wtsnhlms <3
. He squeezes his eyes shut, fighting the pain, his nails scraping against the cold ground as his body arches in agony.
Sherlock was decidedly
Sherlock, who had just, barely an hour ago, confessed to having feelings.
Sherlock is silent. John smiles, twining their hands, he kisses Sherlock once more.
Literally.
Sherlock looks utterly vulnerable at that moment, and John
In John’s eyes, it starts with Sherlock’s forgiveness, and while the man in question has readily bestowed it upon him, John is still unable to accept that Sherlock was so quick to grant him absolution when, by right, after all the hurt that John has dealt him, forgiveness should be the last and hardest step on the road to reconciliation.
, Sherlock-“ John’s eyes widen at that, quickly moving to close that gap between them, wanting badly to take it all back and start all over again.
John startles awake to the sounds of banging and the rattling of his front door, only to wince as he realises that he’s been sleeping on the unforgiving floor, and not his bed.
John acquiesces, nuzzling the taller man, kissing him slowly, gently, quashing his fear that he just did something wrong. “You alright?”
“Please don’t do that,” John pleads, halfway towards the bed, both hands raised in a placating manner. “You- you don’t have to!”
"I wasn't expecting you to proclaim your love for me. I never saw it coming, Sherlock. You remember, that very first day, when you made sure I knew that you were
Sherlock can’t help it but laugh at the unorthodox choice of words, but oh he loves John so much and yet - “Are you sure you want this?”
“That's not the first thing you deduced wrong about me. Remember the thing about Harry?” John counters with a wink. He tries to tuck himself back in but finds himself frozen under Sherlock's scrutiny. “Uh.. So, all this while I thought you weren't open to the idea of sex, I come home to find you in my bed.”
“Sherlock?” John asks, nudging the detective to face him.
As he takes a few tentative steps forwards, Sherlock finds himself feeling unusually disconnected from everything; Where normally he sees whatever is hidden within each room with perfect clarity, this time everything appears hazy to his eyes, blurred at the edges.
!” Sherlock wailed into his husband's neck, thrusting and pounding once, twice, three times hard, his limbs screaming of exhaustion, before opening his mouth and sucking hard on the side of John's neck, breaking the surface blood vessels, nursing the beginnings of what was sure to be a brilliant bruise; He released the skin in a silent cry, hips jerking in quick, minute thrusts as his body stilled, his cock spurting a copious amount of come, coating John's insides, leaving no doubt as to whom John Watson belonged.
John is fully seated now, and both men are as still as they can be, still coming to terms with what is happening, both basking in the love radiating from the other, both overwhelmed with so much need and also disbelief that they have made it to this point, that they are joined, they have filled the gap in their hearts and that certainly one cannot possibly live without the other.
,” Sherlock purred, lips brushing the soft lobe of his partner’s ear. He nudged forwards just a little more, bringing his groin flush against John's arse.
"Yes, well, maybe not a
“Was it too much?”
” every time his arse met Sherlock’s groin. The younger man grunted into John’s neck, sucking new bruises into the otherwise unmarked skin, the hurried pace of their coupling doing nothing to slow the sparks of heat zipping from the base of his spine to his cock, nestled in the tight heat of John’s body. He lowered his head further, latching on to John’s nipple, the rosy pink bud hardening further under his ministrations. He bit lightly and soothed it right after with hard licks, paying the same attentions to the other nipple, spurred on by the encouraging curses and moans spewing out from the man above him.
He lets out a loud groan as he comes down from his high, letting the ghosts of Sherlock's orgasm wring the last few spurts of come from his still-twitching cock. He doesn't want to pull out yet, so he rolls them to their sides.
John hates the distance between them, the mere metres between him and Sherlock feeling more and more like an inescapable chasm with every second that passes. He watches as Sherlock balls up the blanket covering his legs, breaking their gaze as he looks down and away.
Deep down, John knows that if he does not do this, both of them will end up hollow and beyond repair, and the last thing he wants to do is cause Sherlock more hurt. He owes him this much, at least.
Sherlock scrambled to get ready, throat closed too tight in excitement to say anything than grunt in agreement. Retrieving the lube, he coated his fingers, bringing them to John's hole, two fingers slipping in easily.
“Finally! We’ve been trying to reach you by phone for an hour!” Lestrade chokes out, gripping the doorframe tight in his grasp. “It’s Sherlock.”
twice
“Oh? What’s got you so worked up then?” John asked, but he had this look on his face that usually meant he knew the answer. Sherlock stared as the knowing smirk returned, accompanied by a flash of pink as John licked his lips. Unwilling to give up the fight just yet, he turned to face the window once more.
Sherlock raises his gaze to settle on John's. The world stops spinning. He nods, almost imperceptibly.
Sherlock is still moaning softly, his hands now grasping at John's shoulders and back. John on the other hand, is alternating between lightly nipping at the hard nub and swirling his tongue around it, one hand caught between Sherlock's body and the mattress and the other grasping a bony hip. He grants the same treatment to the other nipple, delighting in the way he leaves them glistening and flushed pink in oversensitivity.
“Beautiful,” John sighed against Sherlock’s lips. “Breathtakingly so. Out. Of. This. World,” he reiterated, giggling as Sherlock attempted to hide his face in John’s neck, bashful and tomato red.
, John!” she’d cried.
“John!” Sherlock howls, one hand finding its way to John’s head where he tries to hold on, the other scratching nails down John’s back. John worries the bite with his tongue, soothing the burn, kissing and licking his way down to Sherlock’s chest, pausing at a darkened nipple, wasting no time in pulling it between his teeth. He sucks it into his mouth as he gives his first thrust, moaning deep against Sherlock’s chest as he feels Sherlock’s hardening length against his own.
John - but with every minute that passed, the urge to stalk forward and put an end to this and
,’ John thinks, shoulders slumped in slight disappointment. As if on cue, he hears a muffled moan coming from his bedroom. John stills, posture alert, straining to pick up more sounds. It never occurs to him to wonder who could be in his bedroom in the first place.
“Well.. This is awkward,” John states, matter-of-factly, fumbling to right himself and pull up his pants. “What am I saying… sorry, shouldn't have stood there but I couldn't help myself-”
The two men moved in perfect synchrony, their moans and the slick sounds of skin-on-skin filling 221B. A few more thrusts later, Sherlock could feel the stirrings of his orgasm at his lower abdomen, radiating outwards onto his extremities, flooding his brain with endorphins, blurring his vision. John, sensing how close he was, clenched down hard on where they were joined, hands flying up to scrape deep marks down Sherlock's back.
He thinks back to the day of John and Mary’s wedding, when his very best friend had pulled him in for a hug after Sherlock delivered barely the first part of his speech as Best Man. The hug had started off in reverse then, with John the giver and Sherlock, the recipient. On the outside, the embrace had seemed to be one borne of joy and appreciation, but only Sherlock, and Sherlock alone, was aware of how his heart throbbed and ripped itself to shreds, thinking John was lost to him forever, berating himself for never grabbing the chance before it was all too late.
“Fuck, I've been dreaming of this for so long, and it feels even better than I imagined,” John gasps, mouth full of Sherlock's collarbone, hands squeezing Sherlock's butt cheeks on reflex. “You have no right flaunting these in public.”
I can't promise it will never happen again though, because ANGST >:D
I'm sorry, but I had to do it ><
, John did not dare ask more of Sherlock; he would never put himself first and pressure Sherlock into taking their relationship further. Even if Sherlock decides he never wants a physical relationship, then it’s fine. It’s all
John turns back to look at him in shock before facing Sherlock once more.
“Of course, John,” Sherlock replies, grinning. “Will Rosamund be coming along?”
He walks, and thinks, and barely catches himself as he stumbles up the stairs to his home.
“Yeah, I’ve got you, Sherlock, don’t worry, I’m here, I’ve got you,” John gasps, hand reaching behind him to locate the bottle of lube. He finds it, single-handedly flicking the cap open and inverting the bottle just enough to squeeze enough onto his open palm. He throws the bottle into the shadow of the bed behind Sherlock, and somehow manages to warm up the lube. John brings this hand downwards steadily towards Sherlock’s arse, insinuating his fingers in the warm, warm crease between the two cheeks and further down to glance over Sherlock’s entrance and to the perineum. The man in his arms lets out a full body shudder and moans loud enough that it almost sets John off like a rocket.
“Oh, love, yes, please do,” John said, pulling back to stare into his eyes. “Do what you need to do. I’ve already got ‘Property of Sherlock Holmes’ stamped on my heart and on my ring, why not my body too?” he laughed, light-heartedly, stilling Sherlock’s hips and laying a light teasing kiss on the tip of the detective’s nose. “But first we need to get upstairs before Hudders gets an eyeful, yeah?”
It takes another ten minutes for her to drift off again to sleep, but over her drooping head of downy curls, Sherlock’s eyes meet John’s in a look so open and vulnerable, that John takes a deep breath, gathers all of his courage, and swings his left hand upward to find Sherlock’s in the dark where it rests on Rosie’s lower back.
“Uh..” John tensed, grabbing Sherlock's hand where it was now minutely rubbing against John's steadily hardening cock. He blew out a breath, pressing the hand firmly down. “You're unbelievable..”
He had come out all the way here, to the far reaches of North London, in search of his usual supplier, desperate for something,
Sherlock lets out an embarrassing squeak of surprise.
“But you love it.”
Despite having crossed beyond the realm of a platonic relationship, neither John nor Sherlock have dared voice out their affections; instead they made it known through actions alone - an adoring nudge here, a playful hair tousle there, to the extent that Sherlock would linger at John's periphery until John opened his arms for a cuddle.
The detective smiles wide as he recites the significance of each of the flowers. “The light red one symbolises admiration and heartache whilst the deeper red carnation stands for deep love and affection.”
He watches as Sherlock opens his eyes, those steel blue-green-gray eyes shining bright in the light of dusk streaming through the windows of 221B.
He lifts the duvet- ah, trust John to divest him of his suit and redress him in well-worn pajama bottoms and nothing else. Sherlock grins to himself, stretching languidly, getting rid of the kinks in his stiff joints. He tosses aside the duvet and gets up to throw on his dressing gown, but before he can reach for the doorknob of the bedroom, the door opens to reveal Rosie, her tiny feet pitter-pattering as she barrels straight into Sherlock.
The smile that genuinely reaches his eyes, that tells John everything will be
Now here he lies, dying from blood loss and a broken heart. Again. Sherlock is a fool for trusting John Watson, letting him in, unlocking his true self underneath; the Sherlock that craved affection, and companionship, and someone to love and be loved in return.
“Wait, wait, shirts off, everything off,” John gasps, making to undo his shirt buttons but Sherlock beat him to it, ripping the shirt off enough to make the buttons go flying. “Was that even necessary?!”
Seeing his cock disappear into John's mouth, stretched wide to accommodate his girth, Sherlock could feel the early stirrings of his orgasm low in his belly. John’s face was flushed, his body mottled red with arousal, and when Sherlock pulled back a little, he could see John's other hand working on bringing himself off.
He isn’t about to admit that he is almost disappointed that it isn’t John by his bedside this time. Speaking of which-
He stands, pulling Sherlock up with him until they stand facing each other. His hands come up to caress the familiar cheekbones, sweep aside the curls that will soon require a haircut; his thumbs come to rest lightly on closed eyelids.
A hand reaches out to pull John back to eye level with Sherlock. “John, John,
“Speak for yourself,” the army doctor gasped, his knees almost buckling as Sherlock slipped two fingers easily into his hole with a barely audible
“Yeah, alright,” John grinned. “Remind me to attract other girls more with my impressive criminal-tackling skills if it’d get you this riled up all the time.”
The hand sweeps from his left to his right to settle on his right arm, unhesitant and purposeful in its journey. Its owner pulls ever so gently, and Sherlock lets himself be turned, and his gaze lands on his doctor, who stands so close that there is barely any empty space between them.
happy.
The two men stand there, wound around each other for what seems like ages until they hear the unstable pitter-patter of tiny hands and knees approaching them, quickly followed by a tiny grabby hand latching onto Sherlock’s leg, followed by John’s, and finally with a mildly entertaining huff, Rosie pulls herself up and starts demanding in her baby talk as to
They lock gazes, eyes wanting and soft, yet   desperate and heated.
translate to the fact that something happened to the two of you, something unsavoury, quite certainly, that drove my brother to his old habits without hesitation?”
John’s mouth formed a perfect ‘O’ as he bottomed out on Sherlock’s rock-hard erection, squeezing his arms tight, bringing their mouths together. Sherlock groaned at the tight warmth around his cock, barely having the strength to restrain from driving into John like an animal.
John positively
Sherlock is panting now, fucking himself on John's fingers, and still he’s asking for more, and John relents, inserting another finger alongside the first two. The stretch must be getting to Sherlock now, the taller man blowing harshly through the nose, eyes squeezed shut and holding on tightly to John's back.
“Go on,” John prompted, shifting his hips ever so slightly, both men breaking apart from the kiss as the movement made known their growing erections. The air was starting to get stifling; The heated gasps against skin coupled with the dimmed light of the corridor only serving to fuel the desperate rubbing of one body against another, punctuated by soft moans and light teases of tongue. “What do you need?”
“No, no, I’m exactly where I want to be,” John says in a rush, eyes lowering in mortification. He cuddles his daughter close, breathing in her lovely baby scent, the warmth and weight of her in his arms doing wonders to his stammering heart.
“Oh fuck, Sherlock, there you go, just--” he prompts, pushing his right hand between Sherlock’s torso and the mattress to come up the other side and together with his left, unabashedly grabs those two pale perfect specimens of arse and
Sherlock ponders alarmingly, fidgeting under John’s gaze. It is not unpleasant, but intense enough that he can’t help but squirm a little bit under the attention. It is as if John-the-soldier has come to the forefront, undeterred and intent on his next conquest. The thought of being under that gaze in a more intimate setting comes unbidden to the fore, and Sherlock hurriedly pushes the thought away lest he embarrass himself. He clears his throat and shakes his head slowly from side to side, all the while maintaining the eye contact.
Sherlock doesn’t realise he has leaned forward to kiss her forehead until the moment he inhales her pure baby scent and pulls back to gaze down on her with a tightness in his chest. His head is awash with a confusing mix of feelings: adoration, anticipation and just a hint of heartbreak. He can’t comprehend why, but he is sure that the crux of the matter stems from the little girl’s father.
,” John breathes, his hand moving on its own accord, raised as if reaching out for his distressed friend.
That same morning, Sherlock took cocaine for the first time. He lost all semblence of self-control, and petty things like emotions, he shoved to the back of his mind palace and left them there to gather dust. He was broken, his demons taking over him. He trusted no-one, not even himself.
The detective let go then, using his large hands to grip the back of John’s thighs; he pulled them up, bringing their groins at level, prompting the doctor to wrap his legs around Sherlock’s hips, the Belstaff still around Sherlock’s shoulders providing an extra coat of friction ensuring that John’s legs did not slip from their hold. John reached out, quickly wrapping his arms around his lover’s neck, keening as their erections slid together, the contact between their hot flesh electrifying.
As the shockwaves reverberate through him, the searing pain in his chest is enough to startle Sherlock into tears. He groans, crying out for something, someone, to
The moans switch to whimpers, and keening that are steadily increasing in pitch, and it is now very warm where Sherlock is rubbing himself hard against John’s thigh, and he needs more, he wants more
“Hmm. It’s raining. Do not wish to see you get wet.”
Perhaps it’s time Sherlock take the leap. After all, he has nothing left to lose. He and John may never be the same.
“Jesus Christ.”
Until the next morning, when he woke up expecting to be wrapped in the arms of the man he loved, only to find Victor's side of the bed cold, and a hasty note left on it, the message it contained leaving Sherlock devastated.
“Oh, you’re a bad man, John Watson,” Sherlock sneered, connecting their lips in another passionate kiss, his hands grabbing and kneading two handfuls of John’s arse, pulling the other man onto his lap in the process. His own erection was leaking precome, and he adjusted himself, willing his arousal to reduce to a steady simmer.
“It's alright, let me hear you,” John soothes. “If it ever feels like it's too much, let me know, okay love?”
Sitting back on his heels with his knees on the bed between both of Sherlock's, John flexes backwards to grab ahold of the detective's ankles. Once he is certain that the detective is not at risk of flight, he reaches his fingers further back to brush the tips very, very lightly on the surface of each foot, watching Sherlock's face as he does so. On the third sweep of his fingers, Sherlock's mouth twists into a tight line and his eyebrows furrow. On the tenth sweep, that nose crinkle John loves makes itself known.
Rosie, innocent, adorable, fascinating and all-around, the centre of John’s world. John knows someone else shares that spot with her, and that person is in pain, and hurting, and John is not there to make it all better.
and get his partner back grew to almost cataclysmic levels.
John’s made himself a vow not to follow in his father’s footsteps, but recent events proved otherwise.
He wanted John to come first however, so Sherlock quickly braced John against the wall as he adjusted the angle of his thrusts so that with every push, the head of his cock pressed right on John’s prostate. With brutal accuracy, he pistoned his hips, driving John up the wall inch by inch with every thrust. He licked the sweat beading on John’s skin, the salt just under his jaw. He licked his way into the soft lobe of John’s ear, mouth hot against the skin behind it. With every minute, John’s keening grew louder and louder, and Sherlock knew what he had to do to help John come.
“Sherlock, I
“Yes?” John parrots, his hands tightening their hold on Sherlock’s hand and ring, respectively.
sex, and this was no different. This time round though, Sherlock's possessiveness and jealousy promised for more than just great sex.
John would be lying to himself if he said he didn’t miss the detective, too. Quite badly, in fact.
, leaving goosebumps in its wake.
It’s what most ordinary minds will find short and sweet, but after all they’ve been through, direct and straight to the point is all they need to be in the end.
They lock lips, the kiss soft and languid, sucking hard on bottom lips, tongues caressing teeth and caressing each other. Sherlock sighs into the kiss, and he stares into John's gaze as they pull apart. John grins, then, delighting in knowing that the one unbelievable thing in the world right now is that Sherlock Holmes has chosen him, John Watson. It is the two of them against the rest of the world, after all.
Another bright ember catches Sherlock’s attention. He turns to it, cradling it in his palms as best as he could as the memory assaults his senses. Sherlock gasps as he recalls the morning John made it known that he considered Sherlock to be his very best friend. The kitchen is alight with the smell of burning flesh and the birds outside the window have gone quiet. Sherlock had been so startled by the revelation, that he had to take an embarrassingly long time to reboot his hard drive and react.
Sherlock sat up immediately, creases forming between his brow as he attempts to deduce what the papers inside were. John rubs his back, the touch a soothing balm, easing away the tension building and threatening to suck the air out of his lungs. Sherlock gives up trying to think his way through it, unceremoniously ripping the sealed end of the envelope open and pulling out the crisp stack of documents inside.
, Sherlock thought in wonder.
A big disappointment.
John gulps hard, giving a sharp nod and rewards his lover with a deep, searing kiss as he removes his fingers. Sherlock automatically removes his leg from atop John's hip and shifts onto his back on the bed, pulling John along until he is kneeling between Sherlock’s legs. “I want to do it like this. I want to see you,” Sherlock pleads. His eyes are blown, irises dilated to the point of black and nothing else. Lips bite-swollen, glorious curls plastered to his forehead and his mouth --
“It's just a scratch, it's nothing,” the consulting detective had reassured, grasping John's wrist where it was about to examine the injury. “Scratch or not, let me take care of you,” John had whispered, but it was the
Before he can say more however, Sherlock waves away the apology with a pinched smile.
, it is only at Sherlock's explicit consent. Having had his fair share of intimate relationships with a few partners, John is quick to admit that none of them made him feel the same as how he feels for the man in his arms now.
He buries himself deep in Sherlock's body over and over, the sounds of bare skin slapping against bare skin obscene in the heated air of John's bedroom.
good.”
But it is in the here and now, with Sherlock finally,
It took all of his willpower to pull away, pulling the older man to his feet, leaning down to rumble directly into John's ear. “Not yet, John, not until I have you riding my cock.”
After some scissoring motions followed by the introduction of a third finger, John's enthusiastic nod gave him the green light. Sherlock braced his knees just under his husband's arse, pulling him into his lap, ensuring the best angle for penetration. His heart thudded loud and insistent in his ears, and his world narrowed down to just the two of them.
Mycroft stares back at Sherlock, his features softening before throwing a final glance at the monitors surrounding his brother. With another minute shake of his head, Mycroft saunters out, his steps fierce against the linoleum floor.
“Home,
His breath puffs warm clouds into the cold air, and with every second he finds it increasingly harder to ignore the stabbing pain in his side. His hands, where they were clasped over the offending area, come away a stark red.
He pokes and prods until Sherlock huffs a heavy defeated sigh and twists to face John. His eyes are red and his nose sniffles. He drops his gaze. “I've done you so much wrong, and yet you choose to be with me. Why?”
John bristles at the threat. He stands his ground, defiant.
“I bet it was.” John winks. “That night, I decided then and there I wanted to marry you. It was only ever you, Sherlock. You made me into the man I’ve ever wanted to be. Who I want to be, Sherlock, is your life partner, your
“John!” Sherlock hissed, squirming.
“You are my whole world, John, you and Rosie both. Never doubt that. I’d do anything for the both of you. And to celebrate, dear husband, I believe I was promised another present; apparently it has something to do with the phrase, “a romp in the sheets?”
“Sherlock?” the voice asks once more.
Again, the Belstaff would do nicely as an extra layer of protection from the incoming downpour. It was also a convenient cover for something else that has come to attention.
of his umbrella the only sound in the otherwise quiet corridor. The elder Holmes looks calm, as he always appears, but after a few years with Mycroft as a somewhat-acquaintance, John has learned to read the smallest of signs that belie the true state of the man’s mood.
Slowly but surely, he edges forward to position his knees on either side of Sherlock's thighs, not quite straddling him yet, and proceeds to turn his attention to the pale chest in front of him. He lowers himself to his elbows, caging Sherlock in. Keeping himself steady, John kisses his lover once more before trailing open-mouthed kisses down that long expense of neck, across the hollow of the throat and onto that broad chest. His mouth hovers over one pert, pink nipple, his warm breath ghosting over it. John glances up to catch Sherlock's gaze before he closes his lips around the circle of flesh and sucks
“Indeed, Doctor Watson. This marks the second time now that my brother came close to essentially leaving this world permanently, with you being more or less the reason why he came close
!”s, a moment later, his heart stutters in its beating as a familiar hand comes into contact with his back, right over where his frantic heart is.
Sherlock's eyes crinkle in that way they do when he is utterly happy and his mouth twists in a sad smile. “John Watson, I love you.”
“My, my, someone has a secret kink,” Sherlock heard from above him, the voice a mere rumble sated with pleasure and endorphins.
“God, thank you, Sherlock, thank you,” John sniffles through a rush of tears as he struggles to focus on Sherlock’s ring finger, slipping the silver band on, snug, right to where it belonged. “God, I can’t believe - I love you so much, you have to know that. Thank you for giving me this.”
, of all people.
“Nothing. Happened,” John replies, his stance straightening in defiance. He will not let Mycroft bully him like this, he cannot let the man blame him every time Sherlock takes an unprecedented tumble into oblivion. “Is that what you think, hmm, that I’m the sole cause? You don’t have the right-!”
For the fifth time that night, Sherlock Holmes found himself letting out a small noise of utter frustration.
“He is, he’s the most interesting person I’ve ever come across; so much so that he’s almost still entirely a mystery to me, one that I find myself trying to solve up till this day.” Something about Sherlock’s answer seems to have affected the other man, but the look in the doctor’s eyes is gone as quick as it came.
Of all the times Sherlock had imagined dying in a dark alleyway, it was always during a dramatic chase with a criminal, and not during a pathetic and desperate attempt to acquire cocaine, for
, if your homeless network had discovered you a minute too late-!” Mycroft fumes, the umbrella held tight in his grasp, the man’s posture ramrod straight, poised for a fight. “What happened, Sherlock?”
. Adoration blooms anew in his chest, creeping up his throat, threatening to choke him. John squeezes his eyes shut. He needs to get a grip, he thinks.
“Come for me,” John whispered, right into his ear.
“John, I'm close, harder,
Yep, you read that right. The great detective Sherlock Holmes is a cuddler.
Sherlock lunged, grabbing John and flipping him around so that he was practically kissing the wall, dragging his teeth and placing light teasing kisses on the smaller man’s well-muscled back as he ground up against him, the bulge in his pants rubbing against the cleft of John’s arse. “Oh god, John,” Sherlock moaned, thrusting in minute motions, locking his arms tight around John’s waist, meeting him halfway as John turned his head to gasp and whimper into his mouth.
“Wha-? Er, Sherlock?”
Sherlock kept quiet, body tensed, a new kind of energy thrumming in his veins.
His husband had quickly lost all coherent thought, muttering and gasping unintelligible words barely loud enough for Sherlock to pick up. The detective smiled against the trail of hair leading down to John's cock, flushed almost purple, close to bursting. He gave it a sympathetic lick below the head, eyes turned predatory at the sight of his husband writhing, hips lifting off the sofa in a pained cry.
Sherlock is rooted to the spot as his mind attempts to keep up with the onslaught of new data. His mind palace is trembling on its foundations as the detective scrambles to process and file away the conversation they've just had.
“Holy fu-!” John hollered into Sherlock’s neck, mouthing at his clavicle, inhaling the scent of their lovemaking. Sherlock grinned into the blonde man’s hair, nudging his face up to lock their lips once more, this time round tender and slow as the two men took a moment to bathe in the intimacy and closeness of the position.
“I know that face,” John teased, his face mere inches from Sherlock's. “You were jealous.”
“No, but I understand that Sherlock was already in cardiac arrhythmia when the paramedics were alerted to his unfortunate state by a member of his hateful homeless network.”
“I’m not leaving him. Not now,
“Whenever we start snogging here, you never fail to make sure we're on the bed before either of us orgasms,” Sherlock shrugged, reaching in between the sofa cushions to retrieve the half-full (or half-empty, really, by way of being smug) bottle of lube, squeezing a generous amount onto his hand before flinging the bottle onto the coffee table.
I wonder what John has to say for himself...
“He is my flesh and blood, Doctor Watson. I have more right over his wellbeing than you ever will. You’re just his
“What are you on about?” Sherlock squirmed, gasping when John’s hands reached out to grasp his wrists, pinning them against the door. “Why would I be jealous? You’re my husband, not hers.”
Sherlock is clenching down on the intrusion into his body, and John can do nothing more than bite down on his lower lip to keep from crying out at the feeling of arousal that is threatening to pull him down under. His forefinger unerringly brushes over the bundle of nerves deep inside Sherlock, and the detective
He startles when Sherlock
John whined, desperate for relief, scratching his nails down Sherlock’s back as he tried to turn his lover’s attentions to his weeping cock. He gasped as Sherlock finally gave him a light stroke from root to tip, crying out, “God, Sherlock, just fuck me, something, anything,
Sherlock doesn’t answer because he doesn’t want to. This does not help things whatsoever, because John has long since been able to read Sherlock like an open book, and Sherlock’s silence seems to be the only answer he needed.
They make haste towards the A&E, and after a few urgent words with the counter staff, both men find themselves outside the operating theatre, with Mycroft pacing the floors, the
of Sherlock’s come leaking out drove the detective to gently roll them over so he was hovering above John.
“John!” Sherlock rumbled, his deep baritone sending shockwaves down both their bodies. “I don’t like it. It took us a long time to get where we are and I don’t like feeling like I can lose you anytime to some strutting, buxom woman. You were a ladies’ man most of your life and…” he cut off, connecting their lips in another bruising kiss.
His chin propped on John’s shoulder, Sherlock murmured nonsense into his ear as John writhed, caught between the fingers buried in his arse and the hand pressing against his cock. Suddenly, he pulled his hand out from John’s pants, only to reach into his coat pocket for the anal plug he stashed in there just before they rushed out of the flat for the case. One-handed, he coated the plug with lube from a small bottle, throwing the empty bottle aside and snaking his hand back down the doctor’s pants, telling him to bear down before carefully inserting the two fingers along with the plug.
“I'm perfect,” Sherlock smiles, flipping onto his stomach, much to John's surprise. “Now
-” and with a startled shout he came in thick rivulets down Sherlock's throat.
“No, I had her cot situated in my bedroom so she was within reach if and when she woke hungry in the middle of the night and I was in the kitchen experimenting. And before you ask, no, I did not conduct any toxic experiments, nor anything involving dead or putrefying flesh. I wouldn’t do anything that may compromise Rosie’s environment,” Sherlock admitted, cheeks flushing slightly at the show of affection. “Also, your bedroom had barely been touched since you moved in with Mary. Mrs Hudson only did the necessary dusting once in a while.”
“Okay.. okay.” John gives two small stuttering nods. He knows that he has to take this slow, that taking care of Sherlock is his top priority. He has been hinted here and there that Sherlock has close to nil experience in intimate relations, let alone romantic attachments with anyone else, and that if he and John were to do
Evidently, no one wants him. Sherlock accepts this truth with a heavy heart and a hollow feeling in his chest.
That had only been the first of many memorable candid moments of Sherlock and Rosie stored lovingly in John’s thoughts. He looks down at the toddler now, at her fragile, tiny fist curled beside her head, and John’s hand beside hers, gigantic in comparison. Something about that image made John’s skin crawl.
The detective cries out internally, mystified that John has seemingly turned him into a creature thoroughly affected and sensitised by another’s touch. He pulls himself back into the present just in time for John to ask: “Yes, they are. What do they signify, love?”
The two men sat together pressed hip-to-hip, Sherlock’s hands at John’s nape and jaw, tilting their heads, changing the angle of their kiss. He moaned, working John’s mouth open with his tongue, nipping at his lips, leaving them red and steadily bruising. John whimpered, hands flying up to grab the lapels of Sherlock’s coat, breaking the kiss when he felt Sherlock’s hand drop to rub at the small wet patch at the front of his jeans.
It was absolutely filthy, and Sherlock
- as he recalibrates his senses. Eyes fluttering open, the bright white colours fade into the background, bringing the familiar figure of one Mycroft Holmes into stark contrast. He lets out the strained breath from his lungs in one rapid gush, taking in deep lungfuls of life-giving air to calm his frantic heart, the beeping on his right decreasing as the minutes ticked by.
“Why do you keep saying that?” the baritone voice replied, quieter than before. “I am anything but.”
The two of them had recently discovered that post-case adrenaline led to
He only remembers it then - his promises to delete everything. To delete his affections for John Watson, his love. Sherlock doesn’t know what spurred him on to give voice to his insecurities and suggest even doing such a thing, but John being there became too much and Sherlock couldn’t help but rise on his hackles and defend himself the only way he knew how: with a direct blow to John’s emotions, and his own.
His jaw drops.
“I bloody hell wish I was! His brother tasked me to personally pick you up. We’ve been trying your phone for ages!” Greg grouses, already pulling John by the elbow, out the door. “Well, what are you waiting for?”
The thought of him sends Sherlock's pulse skittering again, and he gasps and tries to delay the inevitable. Loving John Watson has been simultaneously the most rewarding, and most painful thing Sherlock has ever let himself experience, and he can't help but wonder if he could have saved himself the heartbreak a long time ago, and stayed dead after he fell from the roof of St. Bart's. He could have died in isolation somewhere in Europe, and no one would be none the lesser. John would be happy with Mary and the family he's always wanted. Sherlock would have suffered, yes, but ultimately his sacrifice for John Watson was for the sole purpose of keeping him alive, and alive, John
,” Sherlock almost barked, pulling John along with him, out into the cold January air and flagging down the first available cab in sight. They got in, the both of them pressed shoulder to toe for the whole cab ride to Baker Street, the tension palpable in the air.
“Buggering fuck, yeah, that's it, Sherlock,” John growled, reaching down to grasp as much of Sherlock's bottom as he could reach, holding on as Sherlock pounded into him at an unrelenting pace. His head had dropped to press against John's clavicle, mouthing against his skin,
Sherlock released John’s hands, dropping them to wrap around and press John’s crotch against his, his head dropping to rest on the other man’s shoulder, mouth working, trying to leave a mark through the exquisite dark blue dress shirt he had proudly gifted to John for his last birthday. It was his favourite shirt on him; It brought out the indescribable blue of John’s eyes, making him look undoubtedly attractive and simply irresistible. Now Sherlock only wanted to rip the shirt off him, for apparently the shirt made him too irresistible for strangers to ignore, and that would not do, because John is his, his partner, his lover, his husband.
A minute later, Sherlock caught sight of their ride in the distance, immediately withdrawing his hand from underneath John’s and drawing back, nudging John to pull his own coat tighter around himself. The darkened skies overhead worked to their advantage, ensuring that one could barely tell they were both sporting impressive hard-ons.
I awakened, my eyesight foggy. I tried to get up, scraping the floorboards with my fingernails, groaning as a thumping pain pounded my head, my stomach twisting and turning. I don’t remember much other than the pain. Days were blurred. They only consisted of Mrs Hudson forcing me to eat on a daily basis and sleep. There was no one to guide me. I lost the incentive to my work. The light in my life. Everything I did felt like a jolt that thrust me deeper and deeper into a dark, dark hole that had no bottom, and I couldn’t crawl out of it, no matter how hard I yelled or scraped or tried to climb the slippery surfaces of nothing.
Then it stopped.
“I found this… in Sherlock’s fist. It was held when he died. He wrote it. I thought.. you might want to see it,” Lestrade said as he handed over a scrap of paper.
“Am I?” Sherlock said innocently, tilting his head.
The lock popped open, as Sherlock leapt into John’s arms, snivelling, his eyes red from crying.
Slowly, Sherlock opened his eyes, still overwhelmed by what happened. Suddenly, he started to choke on water, vomiting the water he swallowed during his near-fatal drown.
“That’s not going to help.” Sherlock said, his attention turned to the lift, a tint of panic in his tone.
“How’s your cough?” John asked as he took Sherlock’s pulse, back to its normal rhythm.
“Everything’s going to be okay,” Lestrade whispered as he closed the curtains and told Mrs Hudson to keep an eye on Sherlock as he left.
Loud noises. Can’t think. Can’t think! “It’s just you and me now,”
Searching his room, the kitchen and his room, he finally turned to the bathroom. Barging in, he saw the vomit in the unflushed toilet, dripping down the edge.
"You need something? Gosh, your coat! Is that blood?" Mrs Hudson exclaimed as she tried to take off Sherlock's coat, but Sherlock dodged her hand, slightly growling.
“Now!” He roared, slamming the phone down.
Three Days Later
"All right then, you guys, I'm leaving, bye," Lestrade said, slipping out of the conversation.
“Sherlock?” John hollered.
“Is this Mycroft Holmes?”
Sherlock felt an uncomfortable bulge in his throat. Drowsily, he tried to tug out the tube that laid by this cheek.
This is it...
Sighing, Mrs Hudson gave up, going into the kitchen to make Sherlock some tea.
The next morning, he felt that searing pain slowly creep into him again, his lungs feeling as if they were going to burst. He tried to keep the nauseous feeling that was starting to crawl up his throat. Don’t, he thought, as he ran out of his room, feeling the thud of his heart beating so hard. He could barely make it, as he jerked the lid of the toilet open, letting the contents that made him nauseous flow down the side of the bowl. Sliding down the the floor, he clenched his fists as he slammed them on the floor, trying to breathe normally, hearing his heartbeat rapidly flutter. He breathed shallowly, feeling the sour tinge that always lingered after vomiting.
“Sherlock… it’s fine. But next time, please wear more clothes to not repeat what just happened! And how on earth did you find the keys to my door?” John said exasperatedly.
“I heard a thump, oh god,” Mary said as she dashed back to the living room, to see Sherlock slumped on the armchair with no sign of movement.
“And you said breathing was boring,” John said as he stood up, checking on his oxygen prongs and his IV.
Wearing his overcoat on top of his t-shirt and dressing gown, set off, careful not to wake Mrs Hudson.
I got back up again, my heart thumping against my chest, biting my lips. I looked at the room for the last time, the afternoon light shining into it..
He lived with Mary now. Right.
Everyone dies.
“You sure?” The innkeeper said, his eyebrow raising.
Sherlock’s POV
“I was just searching that for fu-un.” John said awkwardly.
“Double or single beds?” The innkeeper said as he smirked mischievously at John and Sherlock.
Suddenly, Sherlock felt his vision go blurry, black flashes blocked his vision as his eyes rolled back, slumping on the chair.
“They’re not screeching noises,” Sherlock argued.
“I can’t even remember the last time I was hugged..” Sherlock admitted, his stone-cold face that never showed emotion, was cracked by the warmness of his companion.
“You will drive me. Now.” John said as he thrust 50 pounds in the driver’s face.
“It’s.. good,” Sherlock said.
“I’ll leave you guys alone for now, either of you just call me if you need anything,” Mary said as she slipped out of the room quietly.
A murky green mucus clung to it, but thankfully, it meant it was just a cold. Whatever. He was probably just overreacting, he thought. But the pain in his chest worsened, as if a knife was seared through his chest, blocking his airways.
“Yes. You need to rest. Now go to your room,” John commanded, placing his finger on Sherlock’s lips.
“Al-alright,” John said, quickly retreating his extended arm. Sherlock bowed his head as he shakily took deep breaths, his palms so slippery they kept sliding off the rail despite his tight grip on them.
“Sorry, your legs must be very numb,” Sherlock said, sitting up, wrapping John in his coat. “What are you making?”
“Hey, I’m off duty,” the driver drawled.
“Yes,” Mycroft said, wondering why there would be someone informing him about John.
“Tea?” John asked.
"No..." Mrs Hudson stuttered, realising that what Mycroft said is true. "Oh god, what will Sherlock say? Does he know?" She continued, her voice down to a whisper.
—————
“Sherlock! Why have you left a knife on the floor- and blood on it too! Your experiments are getting way too out of hand,” Mrs Hudson muttered as she picked up the knife and threw it into the sink.
“You are really not okay, please tell me what’s wrong,” John said desperately, the tone of his voice more worrying now.
“I missed you too,” John whispered back, his voice hoarse.
“Okay, I’ll be you and you be Mary, I’ll dip you first to let you know how it feels,” Sherlock said, as John felt his arm wrap around his shoulder blades, slightly trembling.
Cocaine.
“John… was it something I said? Did I do something wrong? Come out, please! I really want to tell you about this-“ Sherlock yelled as he banged on the bathroom door. He tried the handle which should be locked- but wasn’t?
I know you will never come back to my side, so I’m coming back to you.
“Sir, we-“
“Not until you heal,” John whispered, shaking his head, as he put his chin on Sherlock’s head. He felt Sherlock breathe on his neck, gently settling into his chest, sighing in approval.
It was another typical rainy day. The rain pattered down on the windows. I don’t even know what day it is. What time it is. Mrs Hudson lays down my lunch beside me.
The road of healing is not easy. But John’s by my side, and that’s all that matters.
“I don’t even want to take a bath. You forced me.” Sherlock muttered.
“I have to focus on the case, so please, do not make any comments on anything whatsoever,” Sherlock said, waving a taxi.
Overwhelmed by the sudden flow of food, I gagged as the peas ran down my parched throat, lodging themselves, as I stumbled to the sink, placing my head under the tap, gulping down the cold water that was now flushing away the peas. I felt dizzy, as I gripped the sides of the sink, clasping my eyes shut, the fury, sorrow, and rage swirling in my brain, rampaging and storming.
“She’s due for her nap very soon. I had Mycroft’s minions pack enough of your clothes for a week’s stay. What happens afterwards is all up to you.”
Sherlock loves John’s scar. That single imperfection is a testament to the doctor’s bravery, strength, selflessness and iron-will.
. Rosie is almost due to wake any moment now, and if Sherlock can get John to kindly let him go so he can get himself ready before the little one calls for him-
“But-”
Sherlock had to take a moment to catch his breath, his mouth going completely dry at the sight. He had never done this before, but he knew what he often liked every time the two of them made love, and so he was determined to make this good for the both of them.
John laughs. “Oh?”
“O-okay. Keep going.”
He feels Sherlock’s cold, spindly fingers, and ever so gently, fits his own roughened ones in between to clasp their hands together - it isn’t much, but if Sherlock’s answering upward twitch of his mouth is any indication, it’s a good start for the both of them.
“I’m not stupid, Sherlock. I’ve seen my fair share of patients with a background of domestic abuse, to know that those things-” he stabs a finger in the direction of Sherlock’s back, “Were caused by someone repeatedly whipping your back. For fuck's sake, Sherlock-!”
He latches onto a pale collarbone with his mouth, sucking hard, bringing blood to the surface and soothing it with his tongue. He does the same higher up at Sherlock's neck. God knows how long John has wanted to do that, to leave his mark on Sherlock and announce to the world that the detective is taken.
He feels invincible.
The buzzing sounds stop, and his eyes fly open.
John casually flung one leg up onto the back of the sofa, baring himself to the detective, face adorned with that smirk again. “Get over here, you madman.” With that he pulled Sherlock down, bringing their groins together into blissful contact. He groaned as their mouths connected, both of them hungry for their bodies to touch, their heated skin flushed with arousal, limbs clumsy.
it, preening under his husband’s praise, his head awash in relief that he was doing well so far, but they had a long way to go yet. He pressed his tongue in, massaging and coaxing the tight muscles to loosen, saliva dripping from his mouth onto the floor. He alternated between fucking John with his tongue with none-too-gentle bites to both arse cheeks, his actions making loud wet sounds, rubbing his hands up and down John’s thighs, feeling the man tremble under his ministrations.
John raises an eyebrow in response, the man quite clearly struggling not to grin over the rim of his glass of wine. “‘Might’, you say?”
Three hours later, Sherlock stands in front of the mirror in his room, eyeing his reflection from head to toe. He’s dressed in his maroon dress shirt - one of John’s absolute favourite shirts on him, this Sherlock knows to a tee - and an all-black suit. He still has half an hour to go before the two of them are due to head out to Angelo’s, but Sherlock could not resist taking the extra time to properly groom himself: shaving the hint of stubble just barely shadowing his face and styling the curls on his head so that each and every strand stays put in impeccable waves.
, tackling Sherlock, kissing him hard and rough, covering the taller man's body with his own. He pushes down, and down some more, until Sherlock has no choice but to lie down, whimpering at John's show of dominance and the slide of his heated body against John's own. The feeling of their bodies pressed together is exquisite, and John can't help but surge up and bite down on the unmarked skin of Sherlock’s neck, giving in to the need to mark Sherlock as his own.
“Why?” asked Sherlock, propping his head on the hands folded on John’s chest, his intense green-blue eyes meeting John’s deep cobalt blue ones.
Hello dear lovely readers.
Love,
Now here they are, John and Sherlock, though it feels as if it will never be the same again. The shadows of Mary’s existence will continue to haunt them, and for all Sherlock knows, they could be walking on eggshells for the rest of their life.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait, what’s this one got to do with me?” John gasps, his voice raising with every word that left his lips, unwilling to be blamed when he cannot see the link between Sherlock dying in the middle of nowhere and himself.
John can hear the thudding of his heart in his ears. As Rosie’s cries start to taper off into the occasional wet sniffle, John’s feet act of their own accord, propelling him forward until he is pressed gently into Sherlock’s side. Rosie looks up at him with wet eyes, the hand not grasping Sherlock’s sleepshirt reaching to grasp John’s pinky finger instead.
Evidently his wrung-out body decides for him anyway, tricking his mind into prompting him to lean against the door for support as he attempts to pull up his pants and jeans; the door swings inwards, sending John sprawling onto the floor in front of a flabbergasted Sherlock, his bottom half still bare and his face as red as a beet.
“Mycroft, I- I need a favour,” John speaks, spine straightening, guts clenching in anxiety.
With a gasp, Sherlock pushed in, careful not to go too deep too fast, letting John get used to the stretch and fullness. He leaned forwards, folding John down further, opening up his hips until their faces were a breath’s apart. As he stared into the deep cobalt blue eyes he loved so much, Sherlock gritted his teeth, pushing in all the way until his groin was flush against John's arse.
husband - and frowned when he saw the teasing smirk he both hated and loved so much.
John heaves a deep breath and does not reply, only moving back into the kitchen to place the cake in a thankfully-clean-section of the fridge. “The cake can wait,” he says with a smile, returning to where Sherlock and their daughter stood in their tight embrace. “Come on Rosie, give papa a big birthday kiss, and I’ll bring you to see your nan downstairs.”
He tries to push himself back up, but a second jolt paralyzes his body but for a few seconds, and Sherlock can do nothing but writhe on the linoleum floor as his body thrums with newfound life.
Sherlock, is fully naked, lying on his stomach, on John's bed. The sheets are tangled around his long legs and are rustling with every thrust of bony hips against cotton. One hand is grasping needily at the sheets while the other is partially hidden, wrist flexing, fingers causing slick sounds at the general area of Sherlock's arse.
“Are you kidding me?
It is obvious to anyone with eyes that Sherlock loves Rosie very much, and vice versa, and John doesn’t know what could have possessed him to think of a future where something untoward happens to him, but then he’d have nothing to worry about because Rosie would still have Sherlock, and he knows Sherlock would never let anything happen to his godchild –
First night at Angelo's, redux ;)
“Can you shift your right leg backwards, let it sit on the armrest? Yeah, just like that. Your left elbow, tuck it in a bit more under your chin- okay, perfect,” John instructed, his gaze lingering on the curves of Sherlock’s impressively round arse -
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fuck, fuck, fuck!” John huffs, bringing his arms under and over to grab Sherlock’s shoulders, his face buried in the curls at the base of the neck, mouth puffing hot, heavy breaths as he speeds up his thrusts, just on this side of too much and finally he is
"So... Care to explain your end of this great big cock-up we have?" John prompts, his mouth tugging at the corners.
- as John spun their murder suspect’s beau all across the dance floor, a flirty grin plastered all over the blonde’s face. He even had the cheek to meet the detective’s fierce gaze as he was kissing the back of the lady's hand, asking her for a dance.
"Of course it did! Yes, I wanted to kill you for putting me through that hell for two years and then showing up like nothing had happened, but I'd never have pushed you to the floor if I had known you were injured," John huffs, his stance almost confrontational, his face flushed with exasperation. He heaves a long sigh, visibly trying to rein in his anger as he reaches out for Sherlock. "What else did they do to you, Sherlock? Please, I need to know."
and then
“Unhh,” Sherlock moans into the pillow he's shoved his face into. His hips stutter downwards and forwards, seeking friction against every part of his body he can get. His fingers pick up speed, and all the movement causes the covers to slide off of Sherlock's lower torso, exposing his bottom to the air.
“Mmh. Ready for me?”
God, that letter
“John, now is not the time for your ego to get in the way. Mine is more than enough for the two of us. If you truly want things to go back the way they were before, then you need to trust that I want to know each and every time something bothers you, no matter how unpleasant it is. It’s time we be honest with each other. What’s done is done. There’s no turning back.” Sherlock steps away, the air between them suddenly fraught with tension. “Or do you think so little of me now?”
“Joooohnn!”
John doesn't want to draw it out. He knows they both need it hard and fast this first time round, and so he withdraws all the way until only the head of him is buried inside Sherlock before his hips snap forward, aiming directly for Sherlock's prostate.
, you know that?” John teases, trying his best to kiss that pout away while he caresses a sharp cheekbone. Sherlock stops wriggling, and lays back against the pillows once more, but he refuses to let John kiss him properly.
“To cut the long story short, since we both know you hate it when I’m long winded; The paler-coloured one represents what I felt for you that very first time we came here to Angelo’s, and the darker one quite simply tells of how my feelings have evolved for you over the countless times we’ve returned to this restaurant. The deep red carnation symbolises all that I have to offer you tonight, Sherlock,” John proclaims, his eyes suspiciously misty in the dim lighting of their surroundings. “That very first night, you’d already enraptured me; There you were, beautiful and clever and you were so out of this world, Sherlock, that when I couldn’t sleep a wink that night because I was struggling to comprehend that you were real, and not just a figment of my imagination. I hope you’d remember why ‘heartache’ came into play - for me - that night?”
John does not need to know about those scars.
“Your refractory period is impressive,” John points out, nibbling his way back to Sherlock’s mouth for a kiss. He rewards the man writhing between him with another thrust, releasing a shuddering breath as he struggles to comprehend that this is really happening.
Maybe Sherlock’s brain had gone offline without warning, because the next thing he knew, John is kissing the knuckles of his right hand, the touches featherlight and all-consuming.
“Well you’re doing pretty well for someone who hasn’t had sex before,” John points out, releasing his hold on Sherlock’s wrists, shuffling down his body to settle on his stomach between Sherlock’s legs. He eyes Sherlock’s cock, almost salivating at the sight.
He hears it again, this time sounding more pained. He'd recognise that underlying rumble anywhere; John sidles his way up the stairs and takes a careful peek around the slightly-opened door.
Studying to become a doctor had enabled John to view the human body one way; the life drawing class provided an entirely new insight altogether. He learned to appreciate the minute nuances when different muscle groups move to flex and arm or bend a knee. The human body was beautiful, and Sherlock Holmes’ was a perfect example.
“Your daddy’s not going anywhere, Watson,” Sherlock sighs in that voice he reserves for conversation with Rosie. “Is he?”
Sherlock is
“An eternity with you, my family, by my side.” This Sherlock announces, with certainty and fierce willpower.
“God, Sherlock, that’s brilliant, unh, it’s touching
When John finally opened his eyes, Sherlock rewarded him with a passionate kiss, smoothing back the hair plastered to his forehead.
John’s gaze snaps up to meet Mycroft’s, mouth agape in disbelief. The elder Holmes turns away to look at the doors separating the three men from the one person that has bound their lives together inexplicably. He continues, “As a matter of fact, I suggest you go home to your daughter. You have someone else to care for, now. I’ll be taking Sherlock in until he’s fully recovered. Have a good day, Doctor Watson.”
“But, John, are you sure you want this, with me?” Sherlock says, timidly.
Sherlock likes to think that he’s saved John in return.
John continues, "I still wish you'd taken me along with you, when you went away. You wouldn't have been alone, and I would have been there by your side every step of the way. Perhaps I wouldn't have been able to stop you from the torture they subjected you to, but at least I would have shouldered the burden and the pain with you, because- because you see, Sherlock, I have been in love with you since before you chose to die for me, and probably after we were at the pool with Moriarty. I loved you and I would have followed you to the very ends of the Earth if it meant I could keep you. I loved you then, and I still love you now."
The weekend crawls by, undisturbed by neither clients nor cases from the Yard; Sherlock doesn’t mind one bit, for he is then able to make full use of the two days to direct a small portion of his innate knowledge of the world towards the clueless toddler that is Rosie Watson. Sunday evening finds them winding down with a nice walk through Regent’s Park, followed by a messy-but-enjoyable dinner at Angelo’s, after which the two of them head back to 221B with a satisfied grin on both their faces.
“You're an idiot,” Sherlock smiles, eyes flashing. “and yes I do,
She’d sent him on his way the next morning with nothing more than a few quiet words and a kiss to his forehead, just like she always did when she watched him walk to school on his own all those years ago - the two of them having only started fending for their own selves after their mother disappeared and their father started coming home drunk and violent almost every night, too upset at himself and too plastered to care about his children’s wellbeing.
The way John had looked at that moment in time - Sherlock would never forget it.
John is dressed in a suit Sherlock has never even seen before - midnight blue, coupled with a crisp, white shirt - and the outfit brings out perfectly the sparkle in John’s eyes, the blonde of his hair, and not to mention, the brilliance of his smile; so much so that Sherlock has to physically refrain himself from melting into a pool of enchanted consulting detective.
As if right on cue, Sherlock’s phone vibrates from its spot on the nearby table. He picks it up, his breath hitching at the name flashing on the top of the notification. It’s John.
John received that scar because he was working hard to save an injured soldier in the midst of a hailstorm of bullets. John has saved so many lives as a doctor and a soldier, but most importantly, as a friend, he has saved Sherlock, saved him from his demons.
Sherlock can only keen in response, eyes scrunched tight, his arms now circling John's torso to grasp at his back. He claws hard at the skin, leaving unmistakeable angry red marks, but the intense pleasure that John feels right now wonderfully overrides the stinging in his back. He pushes forward to press their lips together once more, teeth now biting lower lips and tongues seeking entrance.
“Mmhmm.”
The two men took their time sobering up, but not before Sherlock found himself caged in with John's arms at his sides as the shorter man plundered his mouth with firm, wet kisses. He wrapped his arms around John, reaching down to knead his arse, pressing down just below his sacrum, reminding him of the plug and what was to come. John groaned into his mouth, resuming the thrusting of his hips onto the long thigh Sherlock had conveniently nudged in between John's legs.
“Ugh, sticky,” Sherlock winces, discovering the wet spot on their bellies. John laughs, grabbing a stray piece of clothing and wiping them down. He tosses it away and pulls the covers up and over, enveloping them both. They snuggle and kiss until the sounds of the city outside the flat dies down and they drift off to the reassuring sounds of their steady breaths.
If the fact that Sherlock has archived each and every moment he’s spent in John’s presence, no matter how small or big,
(See the end of the chapter for
, Sherlock thinks.
“You mean this?” Sherlock grins, pulling John's hands from his shoulders to settle on the top of his perfectly round arse.
John’s eyes are trained on him, fierce in its intensity, and something about it makes Sherlock want to run away and build his walls back up before either of them can do something they might later regret. Maybe John sees Sherlock’s building panic in his eyes too, because his grip on Sherlock’s bicep tightens ever so slightly and he keeps pulling Sherlock in until the taller man has no choice but to lean in and stand still as John’s arms lift and wrap around him in a hug that feels neither firm nor reluctant; It is as if John wanted to give Sherlock the choice to pull away and reject the embrace.
John couldn't be sure but he thinks there's a “-
“I can’t look at that coat the same way ever again now, it’ll only remind me of when I was being fucked into blissful oblivion by my brilliant, gorgeous, sexy-as-all-fuck boyfriend.”
Then he hears it, a sob, and he looks up to see a tear trail down a high cheekbone.
“Yeah, well, I managed to squeeze myself in on an earlier flight so…” John scratches at the back of his neck, still mortified at the situation they're in. “H-how was your day going?”
Not a minute later, John Watson pushes the door open, and steps into the room with his shoulders slumped, his face the unhappiest Sherlock’s ever seen him.
,” the curly-haired wonder says, bringing their lips together with increasing need. “You're wearing too many clothes.”
Sherlock stirs to the sounds of muffled squeals and hushed whispers from the kitchen of 221B. Twisting in the sheets, he glances to the windows and confirms that it is indeed already past noon. He isn’t entirely surprised; a case had kept him going without so much as a quick nap and barely any food for three days straight, and it had taken only a light nudge from John for the detective to pass out on their bed.
John stopped trying to figure out the man a long time ago and learned to just take it as it is. Maybe both of them were just afraid of bursting that little bubble of contentedness, satisfied with their bond that blossomed with each day that passes by.
He spots a particularly intense halo floating to his right: the night John killed a man for him - without hesitation, his hand steady and true where it is wrapped around the handle of his Sig. John feigning innocence whilst surrounded by the police, Sherlock staring at him as the pieces fell into place.
John pushes up from the floor in as dignified a manner as he could attempt, launching himself onto the bed and attaching himself to Sherlock's plush lips. “God, you were magnificent, you madman. My bed, though?” John voices in between heated kisses.
The sun is just beginning to break through the horizon as he and Greg speed their way down the mostly-deserted streets towards Royal London Hospital. The two men don’t talk; Greg is obviously uncertain of the circumstances as to how Sherlock got injured, and John is struggling to comprehend how anyone could land themselves in hospital twice in a matter of days.
Sherlock groans, already dreading bumping into his landlady and having her gush to him how happy she was that the two of them had finally ‘
He waited for the final push, the one he needed to make the tension snap-
“No, that John is. He probably has no idea how much of a catch you are.”
“John. Thank you for letting me have this. I love you,” Sherlock whispered, loud enough for John to catch.
It takes a whole minute for John to speak up, and the words that came out are not what Sherlock was expecting. He’d predicted that John would ask what caused them, or who. Instead John, clever, clever,
The pet name throws the detective off once again, but he recovers quickly, throwing open the file in his mind palace where he’s stored the meanings of all the species of flowers he’s aware of, courtesy of an intricate police case from some years ago; Mind palace-Sherlock pulls out and holds up the sought-after paper in triumph.
that he had seen reflected in Sherlock's eyes that had made him pray to the gods above for luck, and thus had brought his lips to brush against the other man's, much to both of their shock, and evidently, relief.
Sherlock gathers the sheer amount of data on John Watson he has in his mind and lets them saturate his very being.
“You silly thing,” John laughs, softly. “You're the genius and I'm the broken ex-soldier. It is me who should be doing the thanking.” He leans forward to kiss the tear away, gently unwrapping Sherlock's legs from around his waist and pulling out his now-softening cock. He doesn't pull away, not yet, twining their legs together to stay close for as long as they can.
John pumps his cock in tandem, his eyes closed and teeth biting down on his lower lip enough to draw blood. He tunes out everything except for the sounds of bed sheets rustling and the beautiful sounds erupting from Sherlock's pillow-covered mouth.
“As is yours, even for an old man,” Sherlock laughs, opening his mouth to allow John’s tongue to sweep in as their lips wrestle for control.
“I’ve no choice, do I?” John fake-laughs, pulling away and patting his former landlady’s hand in reassurance. He turns back to the car to fetch Rosie, gifting his daughter with a tearful press of lips to her head, indulging in her lovely baby-smell and committing every detail of Rosie’s face to memory, from the tiniest flutter of her long lashes, to the perfect dimples dotting her chubby cheeks. “I’m going to miss you so much, little Miss,” John sighs, smiling as Rosie prods her stubby fingers into his hair. “Behave for Sherlock, and Nana Hudson, won’t you?”
“-so-”
Licking his lips, Sherlock pressed a firm kiss on the whorl of skin, reaching a hand out to steady John as his knees threatened to give way from the sudden influx of sensations. “
John bends forward to press his lips in a soft kiss in the middle of his daughter’s forehead, the gesture lingering and tasting of salt from his tears.
John watches, mouth watering at the sight of Sherlock's gluteus muscles flexing with every desperate thrust alternately forwards into the pillow placed under his hips and backwards, impaling himself on what looks like three fingers.
He kisses all over Sherlock's sternum before focusing on the rosy pink buds, sucking hard on each and rolling them a little between his teeth. Sherlock writhes, trying his utmost to push back to meet John's every thrust. His moaning does not stop, and he lifts an arm to push against the headboard to steady them as John speeds up, chasing his release.
, John. Don't stop.”
“Really, John? Acting all casual about this like you didn't just admit to having watched me masturbate? Never took you for a voyeur, honestly,” Sherlock rumbles, voice dropping impossibly lower the more he talked. He lays his hands casually in his lap, head tilting in mock appraisal.
Now nothing is more important in his life than
That's all Sherlock has ever been, his whole life.
“I see it now,” Sherlock hiccups, his voice barely audible over his suppressed sobs. John’s heart breaks. “You never would have chose me. You’d rather have anyone but me.”
Despite having heard the words uttered out of John's mouth the other night in the hospital, Sherlock is not entirely convinced that John is being sincere. After all, he would rather not have a repeat of what happened when he first declared his love as John was falling apart in his arms the morning after the Culverton incident.
"Mycroft had them taken care of." John's gentle grip on him tightens and relaxes as the doctor pulls him in so Sherlock has no choice but to look at him. John's gaze is more open now, dark blue irises dilated to the point of black and the tiniest hint of wetness at the corners of his eyes.
“I won’t have you see Sherlock once he’s out of surgery. You've damaged him enough.”
His lover nods repeatedly and pulls John's head down to press his mouth close to the shell of John's left ear and whisper, “
His nerves are set alight, and Sherlock can’t help but worry that he may not make it through dinner without spontaneously combusting.
, groaning Sherlock’s name as he seizes, groin pressed impossibly close to Sherlock’s arse, shifting in quick minute thrusts as he feels his come flood his lover’s insides, eyes prickling at the corners with tears as he rides the force of his orgasm.
“Fuck, Sherlock, your hands, uh..” John whined, his fingers leaving red marks all over Sherlock’s hand as he fought the urge to unzip and pull down his pants
Sherlock deserves all the love and attention John vows to bestow upon him this night, and certainly, for the rest of their lives together. He brings their lips together again, reaching blindly to link their hands before walking himself backwards to lead Sherlock to his bedroom.
John to understand, to accept it for what it is.
As I pulled the trigger and said
He touched Sherlock’s slim wrist gingerly, and he saw words. Curiosity drove him to look closer.
More clients we had.
“And yes, just dump him on the street. Let’s cross our fingers that someone will be kind enough to treat him, or he will really die. Saddie, saddie…” Moriarty referred to John.
John drank hard in the pub that night. He was so drunk he could barely walk. He remembered getting on a cab, which brought him to 221B Baker Street.
, you are not capable of love. And… you know who John’s heart is with. So you shut him out.”
If he could numb himself, maybe it wouldn’t hurt so much. Every hit on John meant a stab in Sherlock’s heart, only one hundred times more painful.
John is silent for a while.
There were tears in my eyes but I hid them with a blink.
“Yes.” The Voice said. “Look at yourself. What plan did you have to win Greg’s heart again? What have you done? You can’t even remember his birthday. But think. What plan did you have to win Sherlock’s heart? Oh, the ridiculous plans! Remember how you spent days reciting the 243 types of tobacco ashes, to impress him! Though you failed. Ha. How many times you’ve wondered about Sherlock’s birthday? Even going as far as to ask Mycroft?”
you to take action. I have had past experience of being whipped, and I can stand it longer than normal people.” Sherlock smiled. “But… I
He felt the blood flowing out from his wound and stars were dancing in his vision as his eyes were readily closing. He slowly slipped into unconsciousness, with the last sound he heard: the sharp cry of Sherlock, “JOHN!”…
“NO! There is not a moment to lose! Let’s go!” Sherlock suddenly yanked open the bathroom door and threw me my coat and my hat. I was in my boxers.
“J… Jo… John?? Why… why are you… here?” I asked, unsurely. He just shook his head, although he opened his mouth and attempted to speak, no sound came out. He walked towards me, and hugged me tightly. He brushed his hair on my cheek, and snuggled his head into my folded arms. “Sherlock, Sherlock. I missed you so so much, and I was so so sorry.”
Sherlock stands up as well, clutching John’s wrists. “John,” He hesitates before rolling up his own sleeves. On his arms, from the wrists to the upper arms, lie dozens of ugly, poorly-healed scars. Some of them are from drugs, some are cuts, some are scratches. “I’ve been planning to tell you about this for a long time. It was a big chunk of my life that I think you should be entitled to know.”
Geoff I feel sorry for you
What had I become?
Silently Sherlock walked towards the chains and knelt down. He slipped his hands and legs into the cuffs. “Lock me up, you bastard, and take John to a bloody hospital.”
Sherlock reluctantly followed Moriarty out the room. They were in a long hallway, Sherlock noted that down and worked to construct a mental map of whatever building he was currently in. His furrowed brows caught Moriarty's attention and he quickly produced a black cloth out of nowhere and blindfolded Sherlock with it. "Sorry, dear, but I can't take risk, can I?"
“I apologise for making you uncomfortable yesterday,” Sherlock whispers, just loud enough for John to hear him. “I will never mention it again.”
Sherlock turns, gingerly picks up the letter John had asked Molly to give him shortly after Mary’s death from where it sits inside the skull on the mantle.
“You alright, love?” he asks.
“There you are,” John gasped, crying out when Sherlock bit down with the slightest pressure on the skin just below his jaw. “I was wondering when I would get to see this fierce, sexy side of my husband. I should have demonstrated my impeccable flirting skills
The taller man swallowed all he could, suckling hard and coaxing every last drop out of his husband, his fingers kneading John's hips. His own cock throbbed, red and neglected, twitching against the leather where it brushed the sofa. As he felt John’s cock softening, he let go, crawling back up the sturdy ex-army doctor's body, kissing and biting playfully, giving the man space to come down from his high.
!” Mycroft warns, and John lets go of Sherlock’s wrist, looking on in horror as Sherlock snatches his arm back and turns on his side, facing the window. Hateful sobbing wrecks his body, and before John can do anything more, he is being dragged away by a man too big to fight off.
Sherlock hid a smirk, pulling John tighter against him. The truth was, ever since the two of them got together properly, like a proper
“John, it’s nothing.”
’s from behind him, shaking his head in fond exasperation. After collecting their respective coats to bundle up from the chilly autumn air, the two men lock up the flat and thanks to Sherlock’s taxi-hailing skills, are soon making their way to Angelo’s.
***Please let me know in the comments if you think I've gone too far plot-wise. My default mode on johnlock is angst because it makes the happy ending all the more worth it, but sometimes I do worry that the latest update ruined the story for my readers. I appreciate each and every criticism, so yeah. Let me know your honest opinions <3 I'll then try to improve the story :)
“Um.. okay. I’m sorry. It’s just.. Never mind. So. Shall we do this now..?” Sherlock trailed off, giving John a look that betrayed his nervousness.
John let out a full body shudder at his words, whimpering when Sherlock switched their positions, pressing him back against the wall. They kissed then, needy swipes of tongue and noisy pecks of lips interspersed with loud gasps and low, deep noises of pleasure permeating the warm air of the sitting room. Sherlock ran his hands all over John’s torso, from the erection that was flushed red at the head to the heaving chest, taking his time to worship the sturdy time-worn body before him. He paid particular attention to the ex-soldier’s scar, every fold of scarred old skin and new skin receiving equal attention from his talented tongue.
They were barely inside their flat before Sherlock started ripping John's clothes off.
“I'm ready,” Sherlock says.
"There's more to labels that just plain old 'gay' and 'straight', Sherlock. Surely you know that?" John teases, his tongue darting out to lick his lips, Sherlock both loves and loathes when John does that with his tongue. "I'm bisexual. 'Gay' just isn't quite the most accurate term to describe who I am."
“Sherlock.. Alright, it's safe to say neither of us ever thought we could have this. We were both idiots, frankly, and could have saved us both a lot of heartache if we acted upon it earlier, but what we had to go through to get here, it's all worth it in the end, is it not?”
“God, yes.”
“Brilliant,” John praises, and the open expression on his face immediately reminds Sherlock of that very first fateful night in Angelo’s all those years ago, where the two of them were none the wiser. “Want to know why I chose these two, Sherlock?”
Something about Victor made Sherlock put his guard down, and little by little, Sherlock found himself harbouring feelings for his closest, and only friend. Innocent study sessions at each other's apartments eventually encouraged his curious, untested mind to go further, testing the waters between them by initiating that first kiss. By the tenth study-cum-sleepover, Sherlock found himself flat on his back in his bed, crying out in pleasure-pain as Victor grunted above him and pushed inside him, hard and quick.
"Whenever someone assumed we were a couple, you were quick to rebuke that you were
As Sherlock's words bounce off the bathroom walls, the pitiful sounds of hitched, clogged breathing accompany them. The detective brings his right hand to his eyes, and it comes away wet with salt and tears.
“Come
“It’ll keep you nice and open until we’re home,” Sherlock promised, his mouth kissing every inch of John’s face he could reach.
“Be patient, John,” Sherlock drawled, grinning against the other man’s sacrum. “What was the saying, ‘good things come to those who wait’?” He continued thrusting his tongue in and out of John’s entrance, feeling the arousal throb painfully in his groin as he fondled John's bullocks, hanging heavy and full. Trailing a finger down his perineum, Sherlock added the slightest pressure, teasing John's prostate from the outside, eliciting a yelp and a hand grasping desperately at his hair.
did that to you.”
He hates himself all the more for it.
“Yes to us, and yes to Rosie,” Sherlock nods, a sob ripping from his throat. “
“You were so brave earlier when you tackled the culprit,” Sherlock rumbled, his left hand stealthily making its way down John's side, hovering at his hip bone, near enough to the crotch of John's jeans. “I couldn't help myself. Everyone saw how you left the man begging to be let off. God, John, you leave this effect on everybody, and then, one of the female officers had the cheek to approach you right after.”
He had been away for a whole week in Belgium for a medical conference he was lucky to have been given the chance to attend. Not only is he mentally exhausted; he misses his bed, his comfy jumpers (one doesn’t get to wear anything less than a suit at a medical conference), a good cup of tea, and mostly, - admittedly -,
“Papa, papa, papa!” she laughs, dimples present on her ever-chubby cheeks, her blonde hair bouncing in her excitement. Sherlock’s face lights up in adoration, a noise of pleasant surprise escaping him; He bends down to pick her up and swing her in the air, feeling the warmth spread and spread through his chest as he brings her close to pepper kisses in her hair, and on her closed eyelids, and round button nose - entirely John’s nose, he thinks.
“J-J- John!” Sherlock whined, his body tightening with impending release, their hands interlocked in a painful grip that kept John’s eyes open, desperate to see his lover come undone.
“Wait, but I vaguely remember you saying you were the only consulting detective in the world. Now, you said this fellow chases after consulting detectives, and as far as I know, there are two men who do that: a certain detective inspector and some ex-soldier named John Watson,” John clicks his tongue, thumbing his lip, as if deep in thought. Sherlock adores him all the more for it.
However, he was determined to solve this case for the incompetent Scotland Yard, and as he spotted a flash of silver at his periphery, Sherlock was up and out of his seat, trailing his main suspect and cornering - not to mention, subsequently coaxing out a confession and handcuffing him - in the loos. Firing off a quick text to Lestrade, Sherlock strode over back to the large main hall, where the guests was oblivious to the silent arrest of their host.
“What--?” he groans, checking that Rosie is still asleep, despite the ruckus. Pushing himself off the floor, John takes a moment to stretch and loosen the cricks in his back. Rubbing the unwelcome twinge in his bad shoulder, he drags himself down the stairs and to the front door, grumbling his acknowledgement at whomever had the gall to disturb him at this ungodly hour.
After the last update, my work life went haywire. The clinic I work at moved in to a new building, a multi-storey one, and coupled with moving all the equipment and handling the transfer of patients and running up and down one floor to the other, I found myself too worn out to sit in front of my laptop and churn out a chapter worth letting you guys read. It didn't help that the worst case of writer's block slammed its way into my head. I got flustered over nothing and everything and my anxiety and moodswings grabbed hold onto me and wouldn't let go.
John’s deep blue eyes flicker back and forth between the ring and Sherlock’s face, the worry lines on his face deepening and loosening. As Sherlock shuffles forwards on his knees, the worry lines disappear altogether and his smile widens and the crow’s feet on his weathered face crinkle in what has to be hope. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and opens them, and Sherlock gasps at what he sees.
He’d watched, as John spoke to a Mary that wasn’t there.
“Sher-!” John cries out, desperate to get back to his best friend, but truth be told, John no longer trusts himself to do anything right anymore.
Sherlock's erection is trapped between their bodies, and John feels it it twitch and slick their bellies with pre-ejaculate. He picks up the pace now, adjusting the angle just so, aiming directly at Sherlock's prostate. “
,” before shuddering and stiffening as his cock hardened impossibly, releasing impressive amounts of come into John’s waiting hole, the force of this orgasm one he’d never felt before; Still his hips worked, letting John’s fluttering entrance milk him empty of all he had to give. It took almost a full minute before Sherlock had nothing left in him, collapsing in a limp jumble of limbs with John’s weight a comfortable anchor above him.
“You are something else when you're jealous, my darling bumblebee,” John laughed, smoothing his hands down the other man's cheeks and neck. “And now it's your turn. Come on, I'm done waiting for you to properly mark me.” He adjusted himself, pulling his leg down from the back of the sofa and bracing his hands under his knees, pulling until he was almost bent in half.
John’s eyes are widened almost comically, though nothing about that moment is funny. His jaw is clenched, his hands in tight fists against the sides of his body, his forehead creases visible. Sherlock thinks he can see a vein angrily pulsing in John’s temple, and he is not surprised when he finds himself overwhelmed with the need to crowd the older man into his arms and assure him that whatever he’s seen is not actually there, that he is only imagining it.
Sherlock had been the root cause of John's life going downhill.
“No, no, I'm fine,” Sherlock rasps out. “It's just…”
Where his mind is concerned, deleting unnecessary bits and bobs of information is simple enough - all it requires is a cursory flick of the wrist, and the offending item is gone. It does not take much to rid his hard drive of rubbish. Sherlock quite enjoys the immense satisfaction of filling every nook and cranny of his mind palace with information the ordinary human mind wouldn’t even be capable of storing.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow when the doctor didn't bother removing the top half of his clothes, choosing instead to drop to his knees with a wince, deftly unbuttoning Sherlock's trousers while mouthing at the impressive bulge right in front of him. Sherlock banged his head against the wall behind him at the humid, wet heat against the length of his cock, taking in shuddering breaths as he heard the sound of the zipper being pulled down and assisting, eyes closed, as John pulled down his trousers and pants in one go, throwing them in the general direction of their chairs.
Did John mention that he loves Sherlock's freckles? He'd like to kiss every single one of them one day.
The sound of the door closing behind him echoes through the still air of the room. John remains where he is, unwilling to move closer unless Sherlock asks him to. Instead he takes the lead, opening the conversation.
,’ John realises. His pulse is picking up, and sweat starts to prickle at the back of his neck. His breathing starts getting shallower; John knows he shouldn't be watching, but frankly he has always been curious about this side of Sherlock, and damn if this is not the sexiest thing he's ever seen.
“Oooooh,” John moaned, eyes wide open in pleasure as he widened his stance to adjust to the feel of the plug inside him, nudging his prostate and sending shockwaves through his entire body. Sherlock removed his fingers, wiping them on his own trousers before caressing the doctor’s sides, soothing him, suckling on John’s neck, waiting for him to relax.
“John, mmph, get on with it..” Sherlock moans, turning his head to press his flushed face into the pillows underneath them. “Bossy,”, John chuckles, finally settling his fingers on the rim of Sherlock's entrance. He massages the whorl of skin, coaxing the muscles to relax. After about a minute or so, he strains upwards to kiss Sherlock's temple.
He lays her in her cot, one or two tears dripping onto Rosie’s romper. Grabbing her favourite plushie, John tucks it in by her side and sings her to sleep, hiccuping in between the words. His heart clenches every time his daughter cries, and knowing that he’s the one who caused her distress tonight, John works harder to pacify her, soothe her, love her. He pours all his love he’s set aside for Rosie into the song, and when he’s wrung out and empty and the toddler is breathing evenly in peaceful sleep, John eases himself onto the floor by her cot and curls up in self-hatred.
“Sherlock- I know the past year hasn’t been the easiest. We’ve been through more than any decent human being deserves to endure in his lifetime. We’ve lost the ones we love; we gained new ones along the way. But through it all, you were the constant in my life, Sherlock. You never gave up on me, even when I was being a dick and only caused your more pain. You didn’t hesitate to welcome me back into 221B. You embraced Rosie as if she was your flesh and blood.”
I can't thank you all enough for the emotional support. Really. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
,” Sherlock says, now sitting up on the bed, still fully exposed and not bothering to cover himself up. “You weren't supposed to be home until later tonight, I even calculated your arrival time!”
Sherlock had opened his arms, allowing John to see into his heart, full and bursting of love to give, and John had pushed him away, too afraid and filled with shame to accept that love.
“Git,” he scolded, fondly, as always, holding it tight as he let Sherlock’s quiet exhales ruffle his hair.
“Yup,” John says, settling Rosie into her high chair before sidling up to the detective. “I asked her before I came up. She was delighted to have Rosie over for company, and even moreso when I told her we were going on a date. She also managed to hint that she’d be happy to keep Rosie there overnight, if need be.” The last sentence John gushes out in one breath, his eyes averted to a spot to Sherlock’s right and the slightest hint of colour dotting his cheeks.
“John.”
He can’t stay there any longer. With a brisk, “Goodbye, Mrs Hudson,” John blows a kiss to his daughter before returning to his seat in the car, closing the door and nodding at the driver. The car sets off, and it takes him a full five minutes before he realises that he is covering his eyes with one hand - hot, wet tears dampening it while his right clutches Sherlock’s letter where it sits by his side.
John still attends sessions with his new therapist Marlene. She had been a big help after Mary’s death, but with the new developments concerning Sherlock and John’s violent bouts of anger, they’d had no choice but to push back John’s progress. He took it all to stride, knowing that he is now no longer just doing this for himself and Rosie, but for Sherlock as well; John wants to give it his all, to prove himself and everyone else that he is a changed man.
