The car drove up the driveway where mummy and daddy were standing. They were waving enthusiastically.
A person of the art, by the power which he had himself, no less, that I should go, and his name is mentioned, Sherlock.
“Yes, he is in my body eating hay!” John was getting angry now. His ears where in his neck and head lowered. “Help me get back into my body!”
The sun is setting and the street lights turn on. It’s cold. This moment reminds Sherlock of her birthday. She doesn’t like it when there’re too many people around so she only invited John. She said she couldn’t come because she’s meeting her boyfriend, but that Sherlock could have fun with her other friends. Sherlock lied to her parents that she was having a party somewhere else, so they wouldn’t worry about her. There was no party, no other friends and nowhere for Sherlock to be, so she had just wandered the streets with snow falling in her curly hair, and icy wind blowing in her face. That was the saddest birthday she’s ever had. She’d never smoked that much in one day.
“Ah, good, you have cigarettes. Would you mind giving me one?” Jane puts her mobile away and smirks at Sherlock.
Harry caught the promotion of poison textiles through his body, he hit his hand. However, he, he knew it was too late. White heat sore gradually spread, injury always. Although he wears a lap, his own Nokochi, it has his gloomy vision. Lack of color, whirlpool in the room.
“I’m done studying for today. Let’s go outside and have a smoke.” Mycroft stands up and grabs her bag.
John extends his wings, arms and neck. For the neck, and then cracking sound. It was too long, in the chair. It is interesting to write a blog, but a lot of work. He put his laptop on the desk next to him around the apartment. Sherlock No. He ceases to be always on the road, do not break. John, as he calls it, most people only after they say that it is lazy, a little bit more "relaxed".
“If we go this way and walk back the playground it will look like we came from the oak trees. This way your mom will never know that we were near the river.” Sherlock answers.
Is it true? Did John go with Seth? Did John forget about her? “What do you want from me?” Sherlock is getting angry
“Come and meet my friend”, Sherlock said. “This is Maximus, my old buddy.” He pointed at John, even though Maximus probably doesn’t understand the concept of names. “And this is John, my boyfriend.” Sherlock felt butterflies in his stomach every time he called John his boyfriend.
It is your refuge. "Sherlock is, are you doing?" Mycroft puts a light by night. A purple darkness, who sits on a large bed.
Sherlock looks at the clock. “Yes, thank you. John, I’m going home.” Sherlock stands up and waves at John.
“It’s my favourite colour”, Sherlock says. “Now I want to make you something. Come!” She grabs John’s hand and pulls her along to the river where lots of flowers grow.
Sherlock gasps. “Thank you!” she says happily. She hugs her best friend tightly before trying on the bracelet.
Too much touching the end of his nose, too much, separating them, leaving the bed, scoop carpet smoothly. Harry discovers that he has a good sequence of old pill agreements between them.
He was about to leave and close my laptop, I came up with this idea. We can talk about colleagues! mythical creature write a lot of them!
“I’m not going to kill you, Sherlock. I’m disappointed in you! How can you even think that?” Jane puts on a fake pouty face. She steps towards Sherlock. Within a second, Sherlock is against the tree, Jane’s hands on either side of her head.
“Mummy also says that pink lipstick is better than red, but we both know the truth.” Mycroft laughs. “Come, I’ll teach you how to smoke.”
The volume it has, can look at the hands of sherlock sleeves is now before us. Blue is the actual shape.
Draco took a cold, wet Harry. It deviates to kiss. Harry closed the distance between them and brushed his lips against Draco. The blond-haired boy Harry pulled and pushed closer to their mouths.
Sherlock looks at John, who sits up a bit. She brushes some hair out of her face. “I’m going to miss you too”, Sherlock says.
"Oh, it's wonderful," Ah, I'm glad you're two fighting crime. " And he gave a kick on the cheek and Jan of Sherlock nose.
“Isn’t it obvious that I’m staying here and that I don’t want to see him?” Mycroft hands Sherlock the cigarette. It feels warm against her fingers. Mycroft taught her how to smoke some time ago. It’s relaxing to breathe in cancer. The death stick in Sherlock’s fingers glows like a star in the night sky.
“I can’t believe this. You two are not going outside tonight. You’re grounded”, mummy says, “both of you!”
At first John had complained about being brushed, he hated being treated like a horse, but it had become a bonding moment for both of them. Now that John was a horse they had decided to end their sexual relationship so they both craved physical contact.
“Mycroft Holmes, I do not want that kind of talk under my roof!” Mummy yells. She had just walked in on their conversation and she didn’t like what she heard. “Don’t say things like that. Especially near your sister! Don’t give me that look, young lady! You know how I feel about murder.”
They arrived at the stables where john still sleeps because it’s the most comfortable place with his huge horse body.
He must have been staring because when he looked up Sherlock was staring at him hard, studying, observing, seeing more than should be possible. He still winced at the plaster on Sherlock's cheek. "Sherlock, do you... I mean are you... bollocks... I can get you-"
"No Sherlock, I was never kidnapped, he comes in here about six days a week on average, at 7 sharp, even if it's just a takeaway order. He's always been very polite, but I had no idea you were related, in fact he's never even mentioned you. The most personal thing he's ever said about himself was that he's a clerk to the minister's undersecretary. Until you said his name I wouldn't have connected it otherwise, 'Holmes' is a rather common last name after all."
"In a week or less they were all intentionally starved to death. It's not possible for all of them to have naturally died of hunger in such a short amount of time, they were too healthy. Your murder weapon is insulin, laced with steroids, and possibly even adrenaline, LSD, and THC. He kept their bodies in an extremely heightened state of panic and need to consume energy, and then he didn't feed them, or if he did, he made sure there wasn't enough for everyone, in order to make them fight over it for his amusement. They didn't have high fat reserves to begin with, so their bodies would have begun burning muscle for energy as well, and if he didn't water them often, the ketoids from the fat and muscle burn built up higher and higher and resulted in the ketoacidosis. They would have all been desperate with thirst and hunger, the muscle pain and stomach cramps would have been unbearable, the headaches, nausea and confusion would have made it hard to fight back, a few of them, already doped up on steroids, became even more combative and started fighting each other, the lucky ones were knocked out, the unlucky ones slowly had their blood sugar keep dropping until they either seizured or their brains just shut down and slipped them into a coma until they just stopped breathing because their brain couldn't give the command. With how close together they died he knew exactly what he was doing. He also stayed to finish the job once they started dropping dead. Judging by the beard growth on the men, I'd say they were kept here for about five to six days before he finally let them die. It was a tortured way to do it, and he enjoyed that pain.
Sherlock was already digging through his closet when John returned and started putting his pants and trousers back on. "What did yours say?" He asks as he starts pulling his trousers up over his hips.
Welcome to the Final chapter for this story. That's right, I finally found a way to finish this story after a truly ridiculous wait time. I last updated this in 2013. Yikes! I am SO sorry for the wait. If any of you are still around, I do hope that you enjoy this.
"I have to admit, John, that I have been rather... disappointed in you of late. I had thought my previous actions had been enough to impart upon you what I was expecting from you. For your sake I have buried three counts of murder, two counts of manslaughter, illegal possession of a firearm, illegal possession and acquisition of ammunition, multiple counts of discharging an illegal firearm in public, breaking and entering, theft, destruction of antiquities and public property, assisting in the deaths of foreign intelligence, fraudulent impersonation to gain access to a top-secret government facility, an ASBO, disturbing the peace, and several other charges that happen to accrue when one takes up to running around after my brother. I made everything go away John, no jail time, not even any inquiries, made it legal for you to have your gun, got you a promotion, made sure you would still get your pension, made it so no authority save the Queen herself could stop you from doing what I asked you to do. And I only asked you to do ONE thing John, do you remember what that is?"
John was currently resting after enjoying his hard won success with the others who had saved the agent's life, and honestly Mycroft didn't think a group dinner at a nice restaurant was enough. Then again none of them were aware of who they had saved or what exactly had been stopped or recovered.
"Get back to work Love, and remember that eating and sleeping are necessary if inconvenient requirements for that 'transport' of yours which I am so inordinately fond of to work properly. I'll see if I can get Mycroft to surrender my mobile tomorrow so you can keep me updated on the case alright?"
“Ah is this the point where you tell me if I break your brother's heart you will inflict gross personal harm on me?”
"Good you're here. No needle marks on the arms. I need you to confirm something for me help me start lifting their shirts and pulling down trousers."
"Yes." John murmurs against his hair, "Yes I do." The words filled with such certainty that there isn't room for an atom of doubt.
The symptoms of hypoglycemia are: weakness, fatigue, dizzy spells, aching constant hunger, stomach cramps, muscle pain, headaches, shaking, nausea, vomiting, impaired mental and cognitive abilities, combativeness, mood swings, possible violence, and loss of consciousness. And I have experienced them all. to my knowledge my blood glucose level has never dropped below 40, and I was hospitalized that time.
put cameras and bugs in the flat again and were afraid of the fallout because you know how much that pisses me off! How many of your little kidnapping update meetings have I gone to since it started and all it would have taken is two fucking seconds out of your day to tell me that Sherlock was fucking with my head, and I could have fixed it? Instead you played along! You kidnapped me from the flat at fucking gunpoint with thugs and nearly slit my throat for hurting him, when the whole time you knew the truth and even then you Didn't. Fucking. Tell. Me. Why? For blackmail so you could keep playing your little head games? Because you weren't man enough to tell me yourself, so I had to hear about it from an almost complete stranger? If I didn't respect your mother and elder brother so much I would give you a whole lot more than a busted nose, something you would most likely never fully recover from, and you would fucking deserve it. Now you will tell me why you did it, and if you are
"You, get me suction and a bladder, you sutures and needle, and as much gauze as you can carry. Who is the best with blood work?"
Fortunately their brother Sherringford was simply brilliant with finances, besides that he had taken after their mother, and it was no secret he was closer to her than Sherlock and Mycroft himself were. He truly hoped it was a comfort to her to have a child she could somewhat relate to.
In the bathroom, Sherlock removes his clothes entirely and takes stock. Pressure abrasions around his wrists, more so on the right when John had immobilized his dominant hand behind his back, it would bruise on the inner wrist, easily covered with long sleeve shirts an inch longer than he usually wore them. Left shoulder, strained from wrenching, be easy on it the next few days. Another pressure mark on the back of his neck from John's forearm to hold him down, insignificant, it would disappear in the next few hours. Bite mark on the back left shoulder, broken skin and bruising, disinfectant and a bandage, invisible under a darker shirt. Several marks on the pelvis and hips from the table edge and John's hands, most would bruise, wear trousers with a slightly higher waistline so they aren't irritated. Bruises already forming on kidney marks, sleep on side or stomach the next few days just in case. Anal discomfort from friction and hard penetration, ointment, briefs, and some paracetamol tablets. And finally, crescent-shaped mark on his left cheek from the blasted mug. Definite bruise, dark purple and red abrasion, small cut but not truly bleeding, already swollen. Annoying, hard to hide, possibly a plaster, wearing hair a bit more forward, maybe even makeup. Annoying. All in all he's had it worse, but the ones he has are still going to be noticeable over the next few days.
“Of course you did.” John took a couple of very deep breaths and then accepted that this really was his life. “Get undressed and lay down.”
"I don't care how you do it but find anyone else who is type A Pos or O Neg that is clean and willing to donate even just a half pint. I need another three pints to have a chance of stopping this bleeding and stabilizing his BP. Everyone else, lets wheel him to the surgery room, cut off the rest of those clothes, clean him up as best you can so I can see what I am doing, and prop him higher off those nails with rolled towels. Support everything that isn't pierced, I want absolutely no pressure on any of them. Leave a 4-6 centimeter gap between every nail head and the table in case we have to resuscitate him again."
A/N: So Happy Yule/Winter Solstice to all of you, I hope a 7,000+ word chapter less than a week after my last posting counts as an acceptable gift to you, even if it might have been more Halloween appropriate with all the gory bits in it. I hope that you enjoy celebrating the wintertide festival of your choice with the people that you love and that you all have a safe and happy new year.
Autumn Casserole- A robust blend of flavorful seasonal vegetables, chicken, and potatoes in a light cream sauce, covered in melted cheese.
The next day Robert Fletcher was recovered to the point John felt fine about signing him over completely to Mark, Carl, and Michael's care, with strict orders for all four men to keep in touch, and the contact information of one of the best physiotherapists he knew in London.
Five course Holiday feast. Start off with your choice of seasonal or daily soup and a fresh crisp salad followed by an entree of three thick slices of slow roasted turkey, (white and dark meat both available) and glazed ham, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and green bean casserole, comes with turkey gravy, cranberry sauce, and a bread basket. All this is followed with one of our desserts and an after dinner drink to finish your feast. vegetarian friendly options are also available upon request.
yep really, just like chapter 6 said, Sherlock started all of this over wanting John to give him another sponge bath. *Slaps the idiot upside the head*
"Yes, and I assume you were the closest surgeon who had clearance. Welcome to Iron Town. This really is an emergency, we have sterile facilities and some basic surgical equipment, but we only specialize in minor surgical placement and recovery of microchip data hidden in the subcutaneous tissues of our operatives, things that usually wouldn't even require full anesthesia most times. I don't think Mr. Holmes understands the fact that just because you are a medical doctor who works somewhere with an operating theater, doesn't mean that you and the facility are qualified or ready for any emergency that comes up, especially one like this. The medical staff here consists of myself, four lieutenants, and a second lieutenant they are all RN's. I'm the most highly trained here, since I am a doctor, but I'm locum work, emergency first aide, A&E at most, not trauma ward, and definitely not something this seriously advanced. We are a Military Black Ops information base, not a medical facility designed to handle this sort of thing, but we are the only secure base with any medical facilities that we could get him to immediately. We will assist you however we can, but guess who gets to beat back Death and order around a superior officer today?"
"John, this is my mother, Violet Holmes, my eldest brother Sherringford, his son Tosland, and daughter Allyenda. Mother, Sherringford, this is Sherlock's John Watson."
“You were fucking with my head, I get that, but the fact remains that there's something there inside of me for you to fuck around
Three cheese fonduta: fresh Mozzarella, Parmesan, and Romano cheeses, baked to bubbling and served with sliced baguette.
He had wanted to scream at John, grab him by the shoulders and shake some sense into him, and when they got home he had challenged him, tried to force John to see reason, that he could never be among the lowly, that he was so far above them they couldn't even dream of touching him, let alone of dragging him down to their ranks.
Root Vegetable Medley- lightly sauteed cubes of potato, burdock, carrots, parsnips, rutabaga, onion, and baby turnips in a rich and flavorful vegetable herb stock, served with fresh baked bread.
"You did the right thing, she'll be alright, I promise. I have several friends in the department, she won't fall through the cracks. Trust me, this is only a temporary measure unless you decide otherwise, and you'll still be allowed to visit. Once you are back on your feet and able to take care of her and yourself then you'll be able to get her back, and until then she'll be a lot safer than on the street, especially with winter coming. Kids like her get snatched up and put into worse things than you ever want to imagine, you are lucky to have kept her safe for as long as you did. It's going to be alright, you aren't a bad parent, in fact this just proves that you're a good one."
And Sherlock felt frozen. No. NononononoNO! He hated his brain as it made another connection that he hadn't considered.
Stuffed mushrooms- Mushroom button caps stuffed with marinated artichoke hearts and baked with fresh cheese.
And now it seems as if Sherlock had finally come to his senses, John had obviously said or done something that had been able to lead Sherlock's unceasing tangle of thoughts to the fact that what he was doing was wrong. Now it was all a matter of damage control, and Mycroft was VERY good at damage control, especially when it came to Sherlock.
John smiles at the dapper gentleman and his assistant as they come in promptly at seven just like always. "Good morning Mr. Mycroft, a booth is ready for you if you will be staying today."
John laughed and the rest of Sherlock's anxiety dissipated. There was no inflection of speech tone to indicate that John was hiding anything or being coerced in any fashion, and John was not a brilliant liar.
It's just a bit after noon and John moves slowly through the shop with a limp, more pronounced having set aside his cane to carry the tray, obviously he had had a busy morning. Sherlock of course has read nearly every detail of John's life from all the various clues and evidence scattered about his person that went unrecognized by anyone else. It had been over a year ago since he had first done it, yet Sherlock continued to read the signs and all the other new ones that appeared every time he came by. John's clues were welcome, familiar, and still endlessly fascinating for some reason Sherlock couldn't explain.
please review, comments make me so happy, and I like knowing what is going on in the readers' heads so I know if I am doing things right or not.
She gave him bad stuff once, he'd been so sick from that hit, discovered later he nearly died, but while he was still half conscious, three 'police officers' came in and caught hold of her, because she was about to make a run for it. They had made it sound very official, but at the same time they had also given her a large shot of the same drugs he'd just taken, much larger than the one he himself had done, and she was much smaller than him. They dragged her out as if arresting her, and she never returned. Her belongings disappeared from her dorm the next day and her files held a very abrupt resignation from the program, citing family emergency as the only explanation. Shelly had told him she had been a ward of the state since she was five. There was no mention of her death, but Sherlock knew that she was dead, there was no antidote to combat the effects of what they had taken, and if a regular dose had nearly killed him...
The arms are warm and safe and absolutely glorious around his shoulders. Sherlock buries his face into John's jumper and just breathes in the man's scent. This is it, this is what he loves most about his Noble Soldier, when the warmth from his hands and arms seeps through into his skin and he is surrounded with the scent of John. When he can feel all of that strength contained in a frame that shouldn't be able to hold a fraction of it, and that strength is holding onto him, it makes Sherlock feel invincible.
Lestrade and Sherlock shared a Look. Sherlock's movements were always tailed to a degree, so why would Mycroft not have confronted John yet? Repeated contacts were always sized up, it was just the way of things, and now Mycroft was messing with the system, disturbing the proper order of the universe, and it was throwing him off.
Sherlock would have known better, but it wasn't Sherringford's fault, he didn't know John very well yet, and certainly not his tells. Sherlock knows that John is his most angry and deadly when he goes calm, especially when under stress. Mycroft would have known too, but he hadn't been there to observe the change. So neither brother is expecting it when John, calm and collected after politely requesting and getting his mobile back, punches Mycroft square in the nose at full strength with a very satisfying crunch that leaves the British Government sprawled out on the floor, broken nose absolutely gushing blood. He's very much tempted to follow him to the floor and keep pounding Mycroft into the ground, but that would undoubtedly result in Sherringford getting involved and John actually likes the man, not to mention that their mother was an absolutely lovely woman, and killing one or two of her children would most likely put a damper on her affections towards him. So he made the one punch really count.
But I can't leave you either, I can't. I'm not strong enough. You have become as necessary as AIR to me and I can't just choose to stop breathing. I'm the worst kind of addict, and you're my fix, my drug of choice. So you have to be the one to end it Sherlock, because I never will, and I don't know how to protect you from that dark thing inside of me. So I am begging you to please, leave me and walk away and never look back, because if you don't, if you stay, I'm going to live in constant fear of hurting you, and that one day I will snap, and then I will eat a bullet to neutralize the threat, and I really don't want to make you see that, so please, just leave, let me save you one final time okay?”
It looked like he was planning a party or something. Well he should be by in the next couple of days or so, he could return it then. John made sure everything was neat, in place, and ready for tomorrow, the cooler had all doughs prepped and ready on trays, chicken and beef marinating in their stocks in the fridge, vegetables clean and prepped, dairy still fresh. The pantry was organized and taken stock of, and the list of items to order was made, then printed up three new recipes he wanted the chefs to make for testing purposes.
They waited there in full silence for several minutes, seemed a small eternity of course, but he made sure to keep his breathing steady and even, no hint of fear, no showing of nerves. Though he could feel that his hand was as steady as stone. Mycroft must be pissed about something to have these guys pick him up instead of the aloof assistant, and he had been trying to puzzle out why when he remembered the one way mirror and almost broke out into a cold sweat as he figured it out. Big Brother was always watching. Mycroft had bugged the flat again from the last time Sherlock had done a surveillance sweep, he had seen what had happened to Sherlock last night. Oh great buggering fuck, not even Sherlock was going to be able to find the pieces of his body.
One swipe, just one single swipe of the damp sponge going up and over Sherlock’s hard and flushed cock, with John’s warm breath only inches behind it gently murmuring those words against his skin was all it took. Sherlock was undone, gripping the sheets and crying out as he came, hips thrusting up into the air, John kissing the soft and tender part of Sherlock’s thigh as he rode out the orgasm.
'Damage Control' he'd said, and Sherlock had remembered too late the one time that had included another person, a young woman named Shelly when he'd been in Uni, she'd been his supplier, and had been slightly less tedious than the rest of the droning chattel there so he didn't object to her giving him a discount if he let her stay so they could get high together.
Dedicated to youcantsaymylastname, who has been awesome enough to review all the chapters so far and set me smiling most of the day. Thanks for the support!
John chuckled as he'd seen that Sherlock had shoved a hundred pounds into his hand, again. The man's tab was set for the next couple of months at this point, he'd been keeping it in a jar in the safe, taking out what was needed and leaving the change. Sherlock was one of his favorite regulars, always dashing about on some mad adventure. Part of John wished he could join him, but that chapter of his life was over, he didn't need excitement to make him happy, or so he kept telling himself. Maybe one day, he'd believe himself.
"Sure you did, that's why there are finger marks on your wrist instead of cuff abrasions, and why John looks so guilty instead of embarrassed. How many times has he apologized so far? Because John would NEVER hurt you, Sherlock, he CARES too damn much, you know that right?"
His mum was abused by his father, and he's studied injuries, forensics is his life's work, and so he knows, he just KNOWS that the horrid looking crescent-shaped bruise, semi black eye, with the small cut in the center on Sherlock's face that was revealed when he took off the mask and the plaster fell off with it, wasn't from a fist, and with the lack of marks on his knuckles, if Sherlock had been hit, he didn't fight back. He remembers with vivid clarity the night his father had backhanded his mum in the face with a vase, and the day after it looked startlingly similar to what Sherlock's face looks like now. Then he saw the man reach for his coat and the bruise around Sherlock's wrist, his skin so fair that it was showing individual finger marks, made him gasp.
Sherlock got undressed while John fetched the needed supplies. Sherlock was surprised to find himself shaking a bit as John soaked the soft sponge in the basin of hot, soapy water, squeezed it out, and began gently washing him down slowly. Every touch seemed electrified, lighting up his nerves and hitching his breath. This was all definitely John’s doing somehow.
"Do not move, Potter," Draco laughed. Harry Potter jumped nearly half wet and half on fire, if history is a fun pleasure.
Sherlock ran his hand through his hair. His parent’s manor was coming closer. The building lay higher than the grasslands surrounding it. The sunshine made the windows shine proudly.
Just before Sherlock can reach her classroom again, the bell rings. All door in the hall way burst open and students stream outside, off to the freedom. Sherlock searches for John. She sees the smaller girl standing on her tiptoes, looking for something or someone.
“I have to talk about it with my parents, but if they say yes then I will go. I’ll be gone for three whole months”, Sherlock says.
Do not stray from the shore for two or more days. There is nothing for me. For a moment, it does not have an adventure. Do not want the incident. I want John. I want you near me. I want to hug him.
“My name is Mister Hudson”, the man says. He writes his name on the board in the front of the classroom. His handwriting is neat. “Now I’m going to read your names from the list to see if everyone is here today and then we’re going to get to know each other better, okay?”
Year-old black girl screamed "However, I'm afraid." Curly hair was falling into the sea, the wind is free. Trees, peace and joy to see and hear Anna, a time to laugh. It is time for him, nothing else in this world. His eyes were closed, it still faces. So breathe. The improvement of the houses, and the soul is filled with cold air. Flying Bird. The sound of flexible wings. Anna opened her eyes. As a branch of the hill, they are bad.
Sherlock looks at the rope. How is she going to do this? If she only holds the rope with her hands, she won’t be strong enough to lift her body into Mycroft’s room. She decides to grab the rope with her hands and her feet, and hang underneath the rope. She steps onto the windowsill. One more time Sherlock makes sure the rope is secure. There she goes. As careful as possible, she climbs to Mycroft’s room. Her hands are hot and sweaty.
It's the first one I'm talking about. "I think it's safe to say that he's got an atmosphere right now."
Harry is the one to open the door. He’s wearing all black, and his black and red hair hangs in front of his face. “Sherlock, come in”, Harry says with a heavy, sad voice. Sherlock notices messy black make-up around his eyes.
“Seth Sawyer? Really?” Sherlock asks surprised. Seth is normal boy and John is an extraordinary girl. They just don’t fit together.
Sherlock felt bad for John. He wrapped his arms around him. It felt like home. Sherlock had spent most of his teenage years with his arms around this very same neck. A wave of nostalgia washed over him and he almost forgot he was holding John and not Maximus.
“Willow, don’t hit your sister. Mycroft, don’t tease your sister like that”, mummy says with a strict look. “Mycroft, will you set the table. Dinner is almost ready. Willow go get daddy from his study, okay? No more fighting”.
‘Sometimes,’ Sherlock observes, ‘I find that the people who appear to be the most sure about things are actually the least confident in their conclusions.’
Mr and Mrs Allen are a quiet, soberly dressed couple who look older than their years.  They both have faces like Lancashire cheese, and I don’t know whether this is as a result of worry about the loss of their only child, or their normal appearance.  They live in a tiny cottage on the hillside, set back above the luxurious villas of the incomers who have populated the village.  Their front garden is devoted to vegetables, not flowers.  They seem a fiercely practical couple.
Josh eyes him warily, and then says, ‘last I saw of him, he was up Tipsy Copse, on the Down.  He used to go there to read.  Get out of the house.  Get away from the hymns.’
‘We wouldn’t tell them where he was if he didn’t want us to,’ I tell her.  ‘It would be up to him to contact them if he wished.  We just want to be able to reassure them that he is safe, that’s all.’
There would have to be a nice kitchen, or one that could be refitted, because I like to cook.  And a bathroom that was big enough for a large shower and a tub that could accommodate two – we do most of our ‘relationship’ discussions sitting in the bath, although these are often sabotaged by Sherlock’s passion for sucking my toes, and that leads to, well, things.
I watch him as he reads.  Frowning.  His curls flop over his face.  There are fragile lines around his eyes now, little crinkles etched over the tops of his cheekbones that weren’t there when we met.  For a moment I wonder what he will look like as an old man.  I imagine his hair white, swept back from his forehead, cheeks as sculpted as ever, eyebrows bristling like barbed wire.  His mouth will still be beautiful, that pinched upper lip, the square, cushioned lower one.  And something happens to me then that I never expected to experience, never dreamed would happen.
I have the sea bass, because it is too hot to eat steak.  Sherlock steals morsels off my plate.  He has the scallops.  He eats delicately, nibbling.  I can tell he isn’t really interested, just putting on a show for me.  I order the assiette of sweets.  He is more keen to steal mouthfuls of that.  Which is why I ordered it.  You have to be cunning to get calories inside him.
John-Matthew clearly feels he must act the host.  He passes out the tea.  It is strong, but not bad and certainly very refreshing after that long walk.  We sit for a little longer in silence.
‘We are called upon to witness to lost souls, that they might be redeemed,’ Mr Allen says righteously.  His wife nods in sweet agreement.
She glances at me as she passes, smiles.  Her teeth are creamy and even.  She wears a little silver heart on a chain around her neck, so simple, emphasising the sweep of her collar bones, and it makes me want her even more.  Crouching against the cool wall, I realise I am half hard just watching her retreating rear as she walks away, the luscious globes of her buttocks giggling under the thin cloth.  She must be wearing a thong because I can see everything, and I’m pretty sure she knows it.
When we are walking back down the hill towards the main road, Sherlock looks at me out of the corner of his eye.
He wants me.  All of me.  Regardless.  I can see it in his eyes.  This is the turning-point in our relationship that I have both longed for and feared.  He has let down his last defences.  Time I let mine down too.  I don’t know whether he will be able to accept what he sees.  But he must see it.
‘Well, Josh said John-Matthew wanted to find things out, didn’t he?  Maybe he was experimenting.  Religiously.’
‘Of course I can bloody swim,’ I snap at him.  ‘What does it bloody look like I’m doing, carpentry?’
‘Yeah,’ he says, and sips his tea.  ‘Anyway, I don’t want to go back there.  At least not if they’re going to go on about bible college and serving the Lord through mission and all that.  I thought about it, and I don’t think that’s me, y’know?’
‘Excuse me,’ I call to her.  She stands up.  Her bleached hair is knotted crudely atop her skull.  Her skin is tanned, her belly striped with the stretch-marks of pregnancy, but she seems delightfully un-self-conscious.  It is not till she stands up, of course, that I realise she is naked from the waist up, but by then it is too late.  And it really doesn’t help my poor genitals.
‘I’m sure you’d be rewarded equally for helping his parents. His mum is making herself quite ill with worry.’
‘Thank you so much,’ I tell her.  ‘We promise we will respect his wishes, and we’ll leave your name out of it.’  Not that we knew it, of course, but my saying it made her feel better.
When it comes, my climax takes even me by surprise, violently bursting out of me with even less warning than I had expected.  I writhe and scream his name, and it feels like my balls are being ripped off with silk.  I ejaculate comprehensively down his long, sinuous throat while he clings to my pelvis, fastened on like a limpet and emitting a droning noise that denotes sexual delight.  He has to push me down with all his weight to stop me bucking both of us off the bed.  He sucks me dry and then slurps off me, smacking his lips, and I lie there, whimpering with shock and pleasure.  He slides up the bed and lies at my side, watching my chest heave, watching me suck air in through my gaping mouth like a beached fish, helpless and boneless.
Because he knew I’d always wanted to go to India and never managed it.  I’ve wanted to go since I was a kid.  I saw a rerun of ‘Gandhi’ at the Woking Odeon because, when I decided I wanted to join the army, my Mum said it was important to understand the alternatives to violence.  Anyway, there it was, my fiftieth birthday present.  The chance to finally follow in the footsteps of Gandhiji after forty years of putting it off and having other things to do, like scrape lads of the battlefields of Iraq.
‘You promised me bees,’ he said.  ‘And besides, sooner or later the villains are going to outrun us.  We can’t allow our legend to be compromised.  Quit while you’re ahead, isn’t that what they say?’
‘You always have a choice, my darling.’  It is the first time he has used such an affectionate term towards me, and it sends a little shiver down my spine.  Impetuously, I pull him into my arms and look up into his sky-blue-sea-green-silver eyes.
Detective Sergeant Stubbs is obviously sitting out the last few months of his service behind a desk, and is not particularly interested in John-Matthew Allen’s case.
‘You’re going to die,’ he sobbed in the A&E unit at the private hospital, where the Mumbai police carted me in some style after the arrest had been made.  He was so upset that the nurses were not sure which one of us to treat first.
The man laughed a bit, and it was evident that the fentanyl was taking effect. John smiled and then stepped back to allow Mycroft forward.
The fire in her eyes, her desire to punch him, Sherlock kept pushing her to try it, wanting her to get her well earned retaliation. But knowing that John would break her wrist if she tried, she held her temper. Pity. She lifted the tape and pretended she wasn't affronted. At the evidence prep John put on the required coveralls, booties, gloves and hair cap, Sherlock grabbed a pair of gloves and a thin face mask once he learned it was being considered a possible bio-hazard.
"That's right." Mycroft nodded to Steve who still stood behind John, and grabbed his hair, forced his head back and pressed a vicious looking Bowie knife under his chin. Dead serious, steady, a trickle of blood trailing down his neck from the razor-sharp edge. Yep he was fucked.
Your life not only feels ruled by food, but you also have a hard time putting on weight or gaining it back if you get sick for awhile. I've had an overactive pancreas resulting in chronic low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) since I was a child, and will most likely be an insulin dependent diabetic when I get older because it is a common result of my condition. The body makes too much insulin then it wears down and doesn't make enough or stops altogether.
Yet Sherlock had been completely unable to understand why getting so badly hurt and coming close to death could upset their mother at all. She'd been completely inconsolable after Sherlock had asked. She was a Holmes by marriage after all, she couldn't understand yet that Sherlock was a Holmes through and through, and that this was simply the first of many such instances to come and it had nothing to do with her capabilities as a parent.
"Yes, I purchase boxes of lost mobiles from Heathrow in bulk every month, wipe the memory clean, and also have a deal with an electronics recycling company for the chargers. I then give them and a phone card out to my network. They take out the sim cards when they aren't in use, in case they get stolen, but also so they can sell the phones if they have to, it's not like I can't get them another one, I have two full boxes at home."
"Perfect, I want you to find a main vein and start a picc line, the more lumiens the better. Right arm would be ideal, but I'll take whatever I can get. Is anyone blood type A Positive or O negative?"
"I'm sorry." He murmurs, and the words feel so completely inadequate to describe the feeling of utter regret he has, no matter how much he means it. Sherlock says nothing, doesn't even look at him or pretend he heard as he haltingly stands up with a slight hiss of pain as he holds his shoulder and slowly walks to the bathroom, trying to hide the slight limp in his step as he makes his way, before quietly shutting himself inside. John feels like his heart has been ripped out of his chest.
"I don't know Sherlock. Damnit, I'm sorry, I am so, so sorry, but I just don't know. I don't know why I did it. Would you like me to go, stay somewhere else? I don't want you feeling uncomfortable. You don't need to be afraid in your own home, I... Christ, I'm Sorry."
"Fetch it. I hate to use it but it's the best we've got right now, not like he isn't already going to feel like shit if he wakes up anyway. Also add a unit of potassium, magnesium, A, B and C vitamins, iron, and calcium to his drip, start him on a round of general antibiotics, and give him a tetanus shot, his system doesn't need another thing to fight right now.
Anthony Jones was obviously a body builder and very physical athlete, most likely rugby, possibly wrestling, too bulked for football, and he'd need more data before he could determine if he was just a vain showman who was compensating or if he actually had a spine to go along with those muscles. The lack of a fake or excessive tan or any signs of enhancers was promising. And even if he wasn't in the same league as the others he would have made a competent beta or gamma enforcer in this particular situation.
What, he wanted begging, pleading, excuses? That wasn't John's way. He doesn't run from his mistakes, he doesn't hide from the truth, he doesn't make excuses for his own faults or play pin the blame instead of taking responsibility. He's a regular, ordinary, flawed human being, and Mycroft is an idiot if he thinks John ever believed himself to be anything but that. Sherlock would be safe now, the dark beast inside him would never be able to hurt him again. Mycroft had succeeded where he had failed.
And you want me to believe that the leading trauma hospital in Britain miraculously had an open operating theatre on short notice, along with almost immediately being able to recruit three of the best surgeons in the hospital and their fields to perform an over twenty hour, four person tandem emergency operation, spanning three specialized areas, and switched with no other surgeons until we finished just
It was only an experiment, he had gotten a certain, completely unexpected reaction out of John once, and all he'd been trying to do was to duplicate the results, he couldn't let John know what he was going for, because to manipulate the variables would change the data and therefore the outcome, even if John had reacted in the desired way, and that just wasn't scientific. But what he hadn't considered is how everyone else would see it since they didn't know it was an experiment in reactions. They saw it as John losing control, John hurting him, abusing him, and that made Sherlock so ANGRY that anyone could even think for one second that John had it in him to be abusive.
Fresh Crab cakes- Three made from scratch crab cakes using fresh lump crab and our own blend of seasonings.
Seafood chowder- Our take on a Cullen Skink. Smoked haddock, scallops, and clams with onions and potatoes in a delicious cream broth. Served with fresh brown bread.
Davis shook his head. "We deal with locals, mild sedatives, and nitrous oxide for the most part. If someone needs to go under they bring a specialist and their own supplies. The closest hospital is a thirty minute flight out from here, and they don't have clearance. Mr. Holmes has the list of approved hospitals. We've got only the most basic supplies, and I can get more pretty quickly, but the thing is I really don't know what exactly we would need for this, this is way beyond my level of training, so you're the expert right now, and officially in charge unless Mr. Holmes says otherwise."
They were air lifted to a remote storage area out in the middle of nowhere, there hadn't even been any visible roads nearby. The huge shipping containers were piled up to four high, four long, and eight across. The blocks were intersected here and there with single rows of other containers instead of just all being stacked in rows. As if a giant had made a block city out of storage containers. After they landed in an open space designed to hide them from any outside observers, John realized it wasn't storage at all, it was a facility in disguise. The doors of the containers opened up on several levels, all facing in towards the helicopter, filled with armed special forces that were all aiming at them. The facility he could see through the doors was completely modern and VERY high-tech. Mycroft didn't even hesitate to get out with John right behind him, and walk straight towards one of the opened doors. The men all stood down at once and except for the ones at the door they were heading to, they all disappeared back into the structure and the doors closed once more. John was reminded of trapdoor spiders.
No, and honestly the fact they never went back to 'not kissing' afterward had also filled Sherlock with more emotions and feelings than he was technically comfortable admitting he had.
Johnathan Mitchell was a fireman judging by the varying ages, shapes, and sizes of the burn scars he'd observed on arms and neck, and Margaret Wileston he was sure had been an active duty armed police officer. He knew that type, John was that type, especially in an emergency. These people were the very definition of 'take charge', the alpha protectors, the heroes or group leaders, the ones the others would have immediately looked up to in a crisis, the ones who kept their heads in bad situations, the ones who don't care if they got hurt if they were protecting others.
He motioned John forward again and he administered the rest of the painkiller. "Rest easy soldier." Moments later, Fletcher was deeply asleep and they moved back out into the hall.
"I can't understand how he doesn't have a million more customers." Lestrade commented absently. "He's got some of the best stuff in town, has new promotional and seasonal items every month or so, he's attentive, polite, the store is always spotless, and to tell you the truth I would pay a lot more than what he asks for, I just don't get it why it's always dead in here."
Sherlock is no ones punching bag, he always has to be in control of every situation even when it seems like he isn't. You probably know this better than most. You aren't abusing him John, for whatever reason he’s got going on in that head of his, Sherlock has been goading you into your actions and you've been reacting exactly how he wants you to, probably from the very start. I couldn't tell you if it's for an experiment or if it's something he likes, all I know is that things aren't what they seem. He's the one who has been hurting you, though as I said before, it’s likely he doesn't understand it. I would tell you not to be mad at him, but I know I was pretty upset when I found out. It's why we had you brought here, we wanted to give you some time away from him in a safe place, to tell you the truth, and to let you have some time to process things before taking action. Mycroft thinks very highly of you, enough to bring you here, which I have never known him to do before.”
"So few people, away from their compound, without an astronomical event, note, video, any sign of connection, or the signs of a suicide ritual? John do try to keep up."
"Remind me to punch Mycroft when this is all over. Do you have oxygen, basic vitamins and minerals? Blood or plasma?"
"Allyenda Marie Elizabeth Diana Eloise Holmes. I'm four. I'm going to be a princess, uncle Mycroft is going to make me one, so I'm going to marry him."
"Well for the parts you tuned out there's going to be press there, they apparently found the bodies before informing police and took advantage of their luck, and most likely tainted the crime scene horribly in the process. Lestrade is sending a car, no arguments, and begging you to please not make a spectacle of yourself, and that we are denying the harpoon photos of you are actually you at all apparently."
John returned a moment later with two of the glucose monitors and Sherlock grabbed one and tested the closest victim he could. The readings were unmistakable.
And he pushed through the two of them, shoving hard into John with his shoulder and near sending the shorter man falling down. Good. John hadn't denied a word of it after all, and he refused to be afraid of John.
going out of my mind with fear. He was only upset over the fact I was pissed as hell when I found out about it. I don't really put much of anything past Sherlock these days, however he is definitely going to get a piece of my mind the next time I talk to him. Where is Mycroft again?”
"This one was at twelve before she seized out and choked on her own vomit." John announced from the victim he had checked.
"How is that when they don't know who you are and can't see your face Dr. Rumstead? You also don't exist so I doubt your name will come up. Erect a quarantine tent over them, and you have medical resources available. Draw blood, and give them shots of saline and vitamins, they'll never know the difference. You have them for up to two full days if you want, that is up to forty-eight hours of media silence, and if anyone else breaks the story before then you'll have another person who was in that room besides the blond woman in the purple suit. Here, give this to Anderson, have him put some on his gloves before he touches her, and makes sure he touches her hands. Don't look at me like that it's just powdered rose hips, common itching powder. It will give her a scare and probably teach her to go poking about things she shouldn't, and when you take their clothes and personal belongings before their decontamination shower you'll find the wallets of the two missing men in her pockets. And since they willingly surrendered their tapes you can check them for further evidence to see what else they tampered with. A high-powered magnet will ensure that her tape is unusable, or just insert a blank one. You're welcome." And with that Sherlock turned around and headed back into the building to view the crime scene.
"Known him for nearly ten years now, and I can honestly say that's the only kind and considerate thing he's ever said to anybody that wasn't  complete shite because he was after something. Congrats mate, I think you've just proved that Sherlock Holmes has a heart in there somewhere. Never thought I'd see the day he'd show it. Ta." John barely managed to nod towards Lestrade as he left, but afterwards he sat down in the chair Sherlock had occupied. It took him another minute or so to see that Lestrade had left twenty-five pounds on the table and he realized they had been going to split the check. For some reason that made him laugh. He had been fond of Sherlock for awhile now, it was rather nice to know the man liked him too. He gathered the money, went and locked the door, set the alarm, turned off all but two lights, and then went to wipe down the table and chairs. There was a small notepad and biro Lestrade had forgotten on the table. It was open to a page.
He doesn't even notice until pain mixes with the pleasure and somehow makes it even better, that John is kissing and licking at the marks on his hips and Sherlock arches, head spinning. It takes ages for John to literally cover every inch of his body with tender strokes and gentle lips, and by the end of it Sherlock is so close to crying that he's had to cover his eyes with the crook of his arm. There isn't a spot on him that hasn't been absolutely loved by John, and he's hard as marble and yet even as John takes his cock into that skillful hand and with a few strokes has Sherlock cumming so hard the edges of his vision blank out, cumming isn't the best part.
"Oh it's good to finally meet you Doctor Watson, I was beginning to think Sherlock had invented you!"
A/N: Um this chapter actually needs a squick warning this time. I figure if MY stomach turned a bit while writing it, even with how desensitized I am, then yours definitely might. I have been in the medieval study and re-enactment field for FAR too long, so when I describe something as TORTURE, you can be damned sure it's accurate and that I MEAN it. I will mark that part with *WARNING* and finish with *SAFE* so you can skip it if you want to. I am a benevolent author, I will not squick you without your consent. So here you go:
"I have to admit, John, that I have been rather... disappointed in you of late. I had thought my previous actions had been enough to impart upon you what I was expecting from you... "
"Ah so you have been kidnapped, good. If he breaks his pattern too much it makes me worry what he's up to. Odd though, he usually doesn't give out his name. Please tell me you accepted the money and didn't turn it down out of some preconceived notion of honor or respect or whatever noble reason tried to take over your senses, it's not like you could tell him anything he could use against me anyways, and I'm sure you have bills to pay. Besides I like wringing him out of every penny he has, the bastard deserves it."
That was the definition, and Sherlock realized with gut wrenching horror that he'd been doing almost all of that to John, intentionally finding all the soft spots and chinks in his armor and needling them just so, in order to get what he wanted, not caring how it affected John. He himself was abusing John, and that was the most sickening realization he'd ever had.
"Detained and Tortured Black Ops. That was Mark Hamsfeld, he's a buddy of mine from Afghanistan and one of the best combat surgeons I've ever known, we worked tandems together for six months. His security clearance was level five before I even GOT to the war, so you shouldn't have a problem vetting him. I'll call you when Fletcher can be moved."
One by one the grumbling reporters and cameramen set their equipment down at Lestrade's feet and followed John to an open area off to the side where chairs were able to be set up completely away from the rest of the activity.
“That sounds very like him. So what's the point? You aren't telling me all this just to reminisce on your youngest brother. There's something else.”
"I miss you, nothing new yet. I want to tell you that if you give in I will never forgive you, and to make the bastard work for it, but pointless works too. So go ahead, make him look like an idiot of you want to. And I promise I will eat later. I-I'm glad you're alright John."
The funny thing is these chapters up until now were all finished last year, I've just been polishing them up from their original rough draft state off of the kink meme. And I don't care HOW short of a time it might have been between updates, I NEVER rush. The last one I spent five days making all pretty, fleshing out some parts, adding details, fixing continuity errors and writing an additional 1,200 words to the chapter as well. But the really amusing thing to me is that chapter 11 DID take me a month to write, it's the most heavily researched chapter I've done, which is why it was so much longer and more detailed than any of the others. The previous ones had mostly all been done in a week or less and got a LOT less attention from me for the polishing up stage because they were so much shorter. Amused writer is amused.
‘Hardly – seeing as I just profited by it considerably, while you are as yet uncared-for.’  I pull him against me, and kiss him.
And let me tell you, it was fantastic.  All of it.  Every bloody minute.  But I’m not going to tell you about it, because this isn’t the story of how we travelled across India, and how we came to know new sides of one another in the brilliant sun.  This is the story of the Bee House.  So all you need to know is that it was the best holiday of my life, right up until the moment where we were chasing an antiquities smuggler through a slum in Mumbai, and I slipped on something that I don’t even want to think about, and tore the cartilage in my right knee.
"Yes." Sherlock seemed relaxed. His mind was absorbed thinking about how he found himself enjoying this. Doing little nothings with John, chatting with him, through the computer or in real life really distracted him. He wasn't
“Look at me, John,” Sherlock interrupted, carefully not touching the man in front of him as he gestured to his own body. “You know what’s happening to me, and you know the reasons. So look at me and tell me: do you still want to know what I’m thinking? Because you know what’s going to happen to my body when I tell you.”
. Last night, his body was doing exactly what his mind was commanding it to do! Since everything started there, his body only followed his mind’s instruction! This was
John sighed again, the piercing stare from the detective next to him wasn't helping, quite the contrary. "There is... this line..." he began, trying to calm himself down, "... a bloody line, Sherlock, I don't dare to cross it. I don't know if you want to cross it, I don't know if we should cross it, I don't even know if the bloody line exists..." he sat straight on the couch now, throwing his unused arm in the air and slapping it back over his own knee.
“Oh,” he said, understanding John’s original question. He cleared his throat and his face was quickly back to normal, a soft smile playing around his lips. “You heard what Chloe Hilton described. She’s being poisoned, obviously.”
, since Sherlock was still wrapped in his sheet. He had informed John about an experiment he ran in the afternoon, but then avoided the topic the rest of the night. He also told him that he had been asking some cases' request from his mail, and had resolved three cases online. Everything was...
“All the paths point to the States,” John sighed, taking his own phone and waving it at Sherlock, “There’s more in the recording. I didn’t think this was relevant to the case until you told me that grass bit, but I recorded it anyway.” He tapped the play button and Sherlock listened intently.
"Ahm... yeah, sorry to bother you on your day off..." Lestrade heard a loud thud coming from Sherlock's room, he hurried to the door to see if everything was okay, but then he heard a loud laugh resonating around the place... and a curse from John. Lestrade chuckled standing outside the detective's room.
“You show me that at home. I’m not taking anything else from your pockets today,” John smiled. Sherlock snorted. It was the first time they locked stares for this long today.
And Sherlock’s face was… actually priceless. His mouth was open a little, his head tilted to the side with a frown, but then he closed his mouth with a snap, swallowed heavily and let out a deep breath through his nose. Then he blinked rapidly as he opened his mouth again to talk.
"I'm forever indebted to you!" Another man spoke getting closer to Sherlock. They gave each other a solid handshake.
Once inside the flat, Sherlock took off his coat, his jacket, scarf and disregarded everything over John's chair. He was hesitant; he wanted to go curl on his chair and think. Mycroft knew something else, he felt it in that brief hug, Mycroft never did that. Only possible solution he came up whilst in the cab, after eliminate fifteen others theories, was that Mycroft knew something he didn't. And it had to do with Moriarty plans. And probably someone else was involved. Perhaps himself, or someone close to Mycroft.
Sherlock stood up and realised his legs were a bit shaky. He felt as if he had been drugged, he looked over at his forearms, no nicotine patches... nothing. He walked to the bathroom and closed the door. He knew he had to remember something, but couldn't quite make out what it was.
Sherlock followed, his nose telling him something definitely was not okay. He was feeling that burn in his gut, unwanted and unjustified arousal pooling between his legs.
He came the second his hand closed for the second time around the head of his penis and, even so, his hips were still thrusting, his mind was still conjuring up John’s body, his touch, his voice, his face against his own.
“The picture on the jar,” John said, clearly amused now. He had relaxed a bit after all the tension but he was still exhausted. “There was… a black… hol – circle, in it. Printed. In the label.” He couldn’t help but laugh at Sherlock’s lost expression. “Sherlock, it said it was water-based…” As he explained, he could see now that Sherlock understood; his eyes were huge and he blinked a couple of times. “…long durability, sweet strawberry taste, doesn’t stain the undergarments, latex-toys friendly and… and it said, and I quote,
John looked down at his hand and got wide eyes; his hands had been unconsciously caressing Sherlock’s skin mid-thighs. He pressed the skin again with purpose now.
"Coffee will do. Meet me in the cafeteria. Two o'clock." Sherlock quickly stepped out of the lab, leaving an open mouthed Molly and an almost cracked test tube in her shaking hands.
"Okay. Where do you want me to touch?" At the answer, Sherlock opened his eyes. He really didn't know what to reply.
John shook his head. It seemed as if there was a voice there, convinced not to leave him alone. It was the same nagging voice that Irene Adler had awaked. He hated it. He hated it because it made him feel... a really
how tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last,—such a little
He loved John. He loved John with all his mind. John was his weakness and he could not conceive a life without him. That much was clear.
Sherlock had to stop at the thumb that slowly touched the back of his anklebone. John was strong. He managed to get both of Sherlock's legs glued to his stomach with one arm, as he tickled that little spot with the other. The detective fought back, desperate, trying to get a hold of John's wrist but couldn't do it. John was impressed; Sherlock trying to fight a laugh was really hilarious. The way his nose wrinkled and his eyes clenched, clearly trying to regain his control back. But after a couple of seconds, Sherlock was breathing peacefully, his nose came back to its normal state and he was inhaling and exhaling deeply. His chest was going up and down, making the buttons of his shirt to tighten and loosen up with each intake of breath. John frowned at him, but kept on moving his thumb there. Then he joined the other thumb at the other ankle. There was no more fighting, only Sherlock's controlled breathing and really concentrated expression.
“Of course there is, but Abby Slaney should be showing up any minute, and I have something more important in mind now,” Sherlock said, taking photos of various works. John was doing the same until Sherlock turned around and gave him an unexpected once-over. He cleared his throat and asked in an unusually small voice. “You alright?”
Rosie was already running to Sherlock’s side asking for a hug. He lifted her and kissed her cheek as she kissed back with a wet “
Sherlock was observing, as always; he could see all of the changes on his friend's face as the rest of the night passed. John's sleep was not relaxed before but after the kiss, John seemed a bit more settled for a couple of seconds. Sherlock couldn't help but wonder what was going on, even if he had a little faint idea.
His thoughts were interrupted with a little pinch pain at his ankle area. John playfully and unconsciously, had taken a little hair from there and was playing with it, moving it between his index finger and thumb. The corner of his lips lifted a bit and again, he realized his features had a deep frown. It was even painful to move the muscles of his face. Looking at John made his face to soften again. He
A moment passed in which Sherlock, even with the case right on, couldn’t stop but wonder if John was thinking about what happened this afternoon. He had recalled the feelings of John’s breathing on his neck, of the groan escaping from John’s lips, of John’s hands firm over his chest, the feeling of John’s nose right below his jaw. It was too much. The man in front of him hadn’t stopped looking at him either, so Sherlock looked down at his phone, breathing deliberately slowly.
. Savagely. He sat down on his chair. “The photos are right there, I had them copied so you can take those with you.”
Sherlock froze for a few seconds, knowing John was having this reaction was a whole new thing. “Paragraph before that one was…” Sherlock moved his face closer to John’s, their cheeks touching and rubbing. “But this time when I touched him something happened in him and in me which made this touch different from any touch either of us had ever known.” His nose travelled from John’s ear to the side of his eye. “And he did not resist, as he usually did, but lay where I had pulled him, against my chest.” His hands slid from John’s shoulders to his lower back. John was panting softly in his ear. He took one of John’s hands and placed it over his own chest, he felt fingers caressing the fabric and the pectoral found there, hard. “And I realised that my heart was beating in an awful way and that he was trembling against me and...”
Sherlock lost track of time as he felt, without a word, John filling him. The doctor's movements were slow and considerate, Sherlock held John's stare as he entered him, a look that spoke of friendship, of trust, a genuine look. Sherlock's raw expression made the task seriously difficult for John until there was a moment in which Sherlock couldn't keep it. His eyes rolled back in his skull as he moaned loudly, almost dramatically; his jaw opening in a deep gasp once John was completely inside him.
I did laugh my as* off at the first chapter from season two when John screamed "HAMISH!" Talking about jealous!John. The writers of the show are geniuses.
“Come on,” he purred, throwing his head back on the chair, eyes still closed. ”Just say it, you always do.”
Sherlock turned his torso completely to John, grimacing. He moved slowly, separating their hands and changed to a position where both of his hands were next to John's head, supporting his palms on the back of the sofa. John's eyes snapped open, at the same time Sherlock's narrowed his.
In 221B Baker Street there was Sherlock, quite amused, talking with John. The thought of having him on the other side of the phone was enough to put his mind at ease. He didn't know why – or how, for that matter - this game had started, but he was beginning to enjoy it. Sherlock heard John clearing his throat quietly.
"I know this man." Sherlock handled the picture of the same guy that stabbed him in the arm. Since he couldn't explain the homeless situation to Lestrade, he avoided the details.
John was not the one to start complaining; he just eyed at Sherlock with a frown and made his way to the kitchen. Coffee was good. Coffee meant at least some sugar inside the detective's body. No matter how he requested it.
John only felt a couple of strong arms around his shoulders and neck. Sherlock's face pressed to the juncture between his neck and his shoulder. He coughed hard, surprised. They almost fell over John's back, but he kept his balance with his palms over the floor, supporting his upper body's weight and now Sherlock's as well.
"Perhaps that's the way your little brain works." Sherlock turned to her and John couldn't help his lips twitching up a bit. "Since you can't even understand yours I can't ask you to understand mine, so please, save your useless inputs."
A growl of laughter escaped his mouth; a laugh that started from his belly and had him doubling over in a matter of seconds. Sherlock had been halfway about to check on him before he noted John was actually laughing so hard it seemed he was having a stroke.
matter and should not be discussed with people outside the family." Sherlock's voice was serious and deep... but soft. John hadn't heard this tone often. And giving the situation at hand, he found it extremely cautious and even a little insecure.
Abby and Craig were getting closer but they stopped when Craig asked her something. John cussed under his breath, but with his face pressed to Sherlock’s neck, he could clearly feel a low rumble inside Sherlock’s chest; it was laughter.
As he drifted to sleep, right at the border of slumber, Sherlock’s body came to mind, muted and trembling like the string below. He thought of Sherlock as a string about to snap, as something to make music with. And it was mute. John didn’t like mute strings. What was a muted allegro appassionato for, anyway?
Once they were outside 221B at last, Sherlock eyed around their surroundings one more time. He had been constantly looking back or checking on the showcases, using their reflection, for anything indicating that they were being followed.
Sherlock moved closer to the doctor, shifting his position in an attempt to make himself comfortable. "Exactly." He smirked and locked their gazes.
About half an hour passed when Elsie came down the stairs with notes in her hands and a few small jars full of liquid and white cream. She passed them to Abby to inspect. Both women were whispering too softly for John and Sherlock to hear therefore they stared intently at the cameras on Sherlock’s phone.
he'd had before. It was similar to the one he felt when The Woman had kissed him, on the cheek, but still in front of John. That time, he had the case of the plain and the camera-phone as a distraction, so he had discarded the thoughts that would eventually lead to a feeling. Now the distraction was
', but he couldn't. He knew what Sherlock meant. He just... knew. There was no possible way he would be mad about it. Following his example, John took another piece of cloth he had in the bowl and cleaned Sherlock's jaw, right below his ear, with hard movements. There was a disturbing little spot of red lipstick there. Sherlock's brows darted up, but he let John do that.
After a while, Jack got closer to them and replaced both empty glasses with new ones. Dark beer for John and light beer for Sherlock. Soon John noticed Sherlock staring at him for a couple of minutes. He lifted his brows at this, surprised.
The way John was working was slow but firm, probably the job’s instructions. His hands were steady and soft. Sherlock congratulated himself again this time for the idea of wearing thick, dark jeans.
Sherlock woke up with a strangled sound coming from his throat, panting and gasping; his breath caught in his throat as his fine ear got the last bits of "Stayin' Alive", Bee Gees' version, coming in from the bedroom window. The neighbours, apparently, they loved the Bee Gees. He coughed and noticed he had his own hand wrapping his erection under the sheet.
John lifted his eyebrows as if waiting for an explanation. When none came, he just snorted and started to take his phone from his pocket. He tapped on it a few times and placed it on the table.
Sherlock’s smile reached his eyes. “Two hours,” he turned his face towards the door but his eyes were still on John’s.
“If you have a… hunch not to believe it, then don’t.” Sherlock moved out of her reach, taking a single step back. “It’s usually your subconscious deducing at a speed your conscious self can’t. I’m counting on it.” Sherlock smiled at her and she smiled back again, wide and bright.
Panting heavily still, John rose a little from his position and concentrated in regaining his breath back. Sherlock was doing the same, staring at the ceiling.
"I know exactly where I have to go, Louis, but if I tell you, you'll be involved." Sherlock waved a hand dismissively.
Sherlock nodded and then got out of the car. He was the first to get into their flat - John and Martin were exchanging numbers in the car - and suddenly he felt ravenous. He walked into the kitchen and saw a big leaf of aloe vera on the table and a tray with sandwiches wrapped in plastic. His heart was in his throat when John’s words resonated in his mind
"Stop staring at me." He took his hand off his face and in one fluid movement he was back typing on the computer in his lap.
Sherlock started to walk with a little smile on his face. The wind was strong, it made the coat to move around the detective's long legs, the blue scarf to wave next to his head and some curls to dance freely in the air. Even John's short hair was a mess as well.
"It's fine, Sherlock. I'm only worried about you. You know, I think... that even a great mind like yours needs to have some fears. You are capable of feeling after all, but really, I want you to talk to me about it. Are you still troubled about Moriarty? You know, I've had nightmares about the night at the pool, too."
He imagined John touching him, massaging him, he remembered the slippery noise and conjured the contact of John’s delicate hands massaging his biceps, his free left hand moved to his own right arm and squeezed, hard. It was a simple move but his brain was deeply into it and, as he massaged his arm, all of the air in his lungs went out. His penis was almost half-erect now.
"I want my dressing gown. It wasn't in the bathroom so I assume you put it in here." He said, turning the handle of the furniture.
But there was another side of his mind telling him this was right, his body was sensitive and this was the most logical way out, he needed the release and the experimentation as his hand slowly travelled from his erection to his scrotum, he moved his fingers down there teasingly. His eyes were closed, he didn't dare to open them, he didn't dare to watch himself going there.
"No. Actually, I've got to go to Bart’s to check on some samples. I need Molly's help, I'm sure she can provide interesting data about the corpse".
“I know. I know.” He grabbed the cups and sat on the chair opposite Sherlock. He left Sherlock’s cup within reach.
"I don't want you to be. I’m not a fine china you have to take care of." Sherlock smiled despite his aroused state and John did too as he heard that same phrase he had said before. His lips were attacked once more by Sherlock’s, the detective’s tongue invading John's mouth immediately with a renewed urgency. John moved his finger in and out Sherlock's entrance intensely. The doctor was able to see the frown on Sherlock's face when he accelerated his pace. Sherlock growled as John's other hand moved a little to tease his erection. He pressed then his nose against John's cheek, panting hard, listening to John's gasps in his ear.
There was a hand moving down his chest to his forming erection. He didn't want it, but he couldn't help it.
He saw with horror his hand getting closer to John’s without his mind’s permission. He couldn’t stop it but gave John’s hand two little taps with his fingers to cover for it.
"I do." Armand tapped the back of his hand in a nervous gesture, he lifted his brows and chewed on his lower lip. He eyed around the flat and got even closer to John, sitting at the edge of the chair. "I think it's a passional crime" he whispered finally.
"Look, Sherlock... if you say the painting is there, how could we miss that?" Lestrade didn't comment on Sherlock's face at his question, he quickly added, "and by
And here's the kicker; copper plated steel nails, thirteen centimeters long, thirty-five of them total, either hammered manually or inserted with a nail gun into ball and socket joints and tendons to be used as probes for electrical torture, they all still have copper wiring wrapped around their heads. Four were hammered directly into the ball joints of the humerus on both sides of the shoulder, four through each of the femoral joints at the hip, two through his spine, one through the right popliteal fascia in the back of the knee, one through the left lateral knee, three through each foot, seven through the sacrum, and two through his scrotum, nailing his nuts between two pieces of copper sheeting to a wooden block. There is an estimated fifteen cm by two cm copper tube that was inserted in the penis like a catheter, and the flesh is melted to it with either second or third degree electrical burns. These bastards went for maximum pain and they sure as hell got it.
Having long since gotten used to Sherlocks' mad dashes off, he pulled out the takeaway hot cup he'd taken to keeping on the tray and poured in Sherlocks' just delivered order. Handing it off as Sherlock shoved a random few bills from his wallet into his hand and John also passed him a folded pastry bag before he ran for the door in glee to tell Lestrade. There was a bacon, lettuce, tomato and cheese sandwich on eggy bread with packets of mayo and mustard inside, ready for when he wanted it. "Case is done, eat something, you've earned it."
He tucked the pack back into his pocket when the man refused to take it back. The ride was completely silent, not even any radio as they drove who knows where. Silence is one thing, but awkward, uncomfortable silence is another matter entirely.
Lestrade just shook his head. "John, don't bother, seriously, he's not going to get it. Social conventions are beneath him and he did mean it. I'm currently the preventer of boredom, tolerated to a higher degree than most, and this is a step up from the masses, heck we are participating in a social activity together, that's practically unheard of, so let's not ruin the moment. As for me, my wife was very used to the fact I live on a 24 hour schedule, but the loneliness got to her and she cheated on me, finally left last year and took the kids with her. We're in the middle of divorce proceedings now. She'll probably win full custody with my schedule being so erratic and my job being so dangerous, I can't say that I blame her really, but I miss my kids."
Dear M, Sorry you don't like the fact that John said 'gods' instead of 'God'. And FYI it has nothing to do with me being narcissistic and trying to insert myself into my character, and stand out as being non-christian/ pagan/ 'look at me I'm a special snowflake!' or whatever. I intentionally use it in most of my writing so that I am not singling out a particular deity of anyone's faith in order to be respectful of people, and it tends to be less harsh of an expression. Not to mention a lot of people are polytheistic, not just pagans, do your research. So I'm sorry that's what you are using as a basis to leave this story over, my suggestion is to not make assumptions about the author's intentions, and also don't assume you know someone based on one word you read out of context in a work of fanfiction, it's an insult to your own intelligence, not mine.
Lestrade at least knew better than to automatically assume, he had listened to what John had to say. So Sherlock had gone and stabbed Anderson's sidewall nearest the curb with his pocket knife, shoving a large piece of glass from a broken bottle into it to hide that he had done it. He had also put a screw in the front passenger tire that would slowly deflate it, and slightly dug a 3 inch nail into the other rear tire and braced it against the asphalt so that Anderson would back over it. The whole thing had taken less than two minutes. John however was already waiting for him to go home.
"There are injection marks on the stomach, consistent with insulin injections, but I'm not seeing marks older than a few days at most, and their fingers show no signs of frequent blood test-..." Sherlock felt his eyes go wide as his mind stopped its train of thought and switched to a different conclusion entirely. "Oh clever, clever little murderer aren't you? John, there are three diabetic techs on this team, get their blood monitors and tell them I will pay them back for the lances and test strips if I have to, but get them, now."
They stayed for another two hours, ordering more drinks and snacks, talking with John since it was slow, and completely forgetting about the outside world. Soon the store emptied, John topped up their tea cups and laid down a fresh pot before he and his staff cleaned up half of the dining room for the day, pushed five tables together, and loaded the tea trolleys with the day's leftover food: soup, sandwiches, pastries, salads, even some hot boxed lunch items and desserts as well as coffee and tea. They also opened up a side office Sherlock had assumed was a store room for cleaning supplies, and set two chairs against the wall next to it. John came back over with a smile.
The case? Did John really think that he had given one single glance at the case when John had been missing and possibly dead at the hands of his own brother? He had been all over London searching for any possible lead about JOHN, not the mass murderer. And of course he hadn't eaten, he'd felt nauseous since he had woken up and John was gone. He had tried to make tea earlier so he could focus, but it had been wrong, all wrong because John hadn't been the one to make it, and then of course the cold tea had ended up tinting the wall. He'd have to replace the cup before John got back.
"Poached eggs, seven grain toast, bacon extra crispy and blotted, sausage, blood sausage, breakfast potatoes, beans, mushrooms, and grilled tomatoes?"
The first words he's spoken since the encounter began, and Sherlock knows it's true. He knows John loves him, he knows John is sorry, and he knows that no matter the bruises attesting otherwise, John is not an abuser. He's known abusers of every type; physical, mental, sexual; criminals of the lowest sort, they get into their victims heads, twist things around, and press all the blame back on the victims, making them afraid to fight back or speak up so the abuse can continue in a never ending cycle. Not his John. Never his brave doctor. There is no transfer of blame, there is no mind games or false pretenses. No matter what happens when Sherlock manages to hit the buttons just right, John willingly takes full responsibility for his own actions and soldiers through the fallout and guilt with all the single mindedness of his position.
A/N: Apologies my dear readers, I did not mean to be out of touch for so long, nor make you wait so long for an update or have it seem like I had abandoned this story. I haven't I promise. Many important and stressful things simply have come up one after the other these past few months, and honestly, writing fanfic has been one of the absolute last things on my mind. Thank all of you for your patience, and as a semi early Yule gift I will try to have the next chapter edited and posted within the next few days or so. Thanks again for reading and please leave a review if you like what I write. Feedback is muse food!
"No you didn't. You lost a kidney, some intestine, a bit of liver but that will grow back, and we recovered what we could of your genitals. Reconstructive surgery for that is an option for later on, but we didn't amputate any limbs or extremeties, though it was a near thing with your left leg. Whether you will still be able to use them we aren't sure yet. Earlier I would have said it didn't look good with the amount of nerve damage you had, but you have far more feeling and movement than we had hoped, and you may regain more after the swelling goes down. Right now there isn't a single part of your system that isn't inflamed either from injury or infection, and that puts pressure on your nerves and circulatory system, which in turn can make things go numb. As the swelling reduces, what sensation you can regain will return too. That is when we can make a better assessment of the damage. You already pulled off one miracle, something tells me you are just stubborn enough to go for a second one if you set your mind to it. Now, your boss wants to talk to you for a moment. I'll give you half of this now, to start getting you out of pain, and the other half when he's done, alright?"
Sherlock was standing in the middle of his room, observing himself in the mirror. He was blushing, embarrassing as it was, he
“I see.” John moved in-between Sherlock’s thighs again and took another bottle and to massage Sherlock’s upper arms, both at the time, softly, soothing them. “Red slide is roses.” Sherlock nodded again and John cleared his throat. “Sherlock… William. This… thing. Between us. Between William and Hamish. How do we keep on playing it without being suspicious?”
The DI sighed, placed both of his elbows over his desk and let his head fall in between his hands. "Fuck." He muttered for himself.
The tips of his fingers brush what is left of my skin.  I am scored and scarred there, in the depression between collarbone and breast.  What I didn’t expect is that the shattered nerve endings there are not merely heightened to pain, but to all sensation.  When he touches me with his beautiful fingers, it blows my mind.
‘I think he just wanted to find out,’ Josh goes on, following my look.  ‘Like your mate.  Wanted to find out about the world.  His mum and dad weren’t too keen on him doing that.  They wanted him to have a good education, yeah, but like, it was only so’s he could go and be a missionary somewhere.  Jonny dint want to be a missionary.’
‘Mmm?’  He is rooting about in his suitcase.  His rump is emphasised by the clinging towel.  I examine the curtain fabric on the other side of the room.
He’s right of course.  John-Matthew would not be welcome here, and the in-crowd would not venture any further into the woods, although they would not admit they are afraid to.
We flew home the next day, me on crutches and Sherlock in a fugue state.  It was hardly what you might call a perfect end to the holiday, but I suppose it was typical.  Nothing is ever straightforward around Sherlock.
‘Though I doubt we’ll need to stay another night,’ Sherlock huffs, when I suggest it as a sensible precaution.
I tread hard on Sherlock’s foot when he opens his mouth to speak.  He gives me a filthy look in reply.
He nuzzles my chest.  He is clearly beginning to wake.  I’ve got to get myself out of this.  I could just gently slide from under him while he is still half asleep and he’ll never know.  If I could-
The rest of the accommodation could be flexible, though Sherlock moaned on about wanting beams, despite my pointing out that he always cracks his head on them.
The Bay Tree Café is in a side street.  We sit in the back garden.  Actually, to call it a garden is a bit of a misnomer.  It’s a back yard, but since the building is on the side of the hill, it has an excellent view of the bottom of the town and the river.  The food is excellent, and roses flower on the pergola that shades us from the late lunchtime sun.  Sherlock is absorbed in the file while I eat.
A woman is walking up the street towards me.  She is dressed in white linen trousers and a white strappy top.  The garments cling to her figure.  She is probably in her forties, tanned and blonde, beautiful, one of those high-maintenance women you find in wealthy heritage towns like this.  Her hips swing.  Her makeup is subtle, elegant, a slick of lipstick, mascara, and naked skin that gleams with health.  She is enjoying the sun and the feel of her body moving through it.
