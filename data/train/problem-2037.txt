Now they were talking about Mary’s drawings. She was motioning towards her line work while John was nodding, clearly impressed but still uncomfortable with talking about his naked body with her. He nodded along to her words and started circling the room, quietly observing everyone’s drawing while Mary followed behind him, still talking about.. something (Sherlock couldn’t be bothered to listen) while John answered politely.
John reached down and took Sherlock in hand too, both stroking each other wetly and knowing at the pace they were going this wasn’t going to take very long anymore but enjoying every pleasurable second.
John hadn’t seen much of Sherringford since he’d known the Holmes’s family. He was always away on trips and neither Sherlock nor Mycroft talked much about him. And John didn’t dare ask anything about him judging by the cold atmosphere that took over whenever he was around.
The laughed quietly into each other’s mouths, trying to kiss each other but gently clashing teeth with their grins or missing and kissing each other’s jaws or cheeks, but it didn’t matter. Soon enough their joyful silly laughter died down as their kisses grew more heated and sloppy with every touch of their roaming hands.
He drew the cool and soft hands of his mother, lightly touching his forehead when she had thought he was sick so many mornings when he was younger and would do anything not to go to school to avoid his bullies. He drew her tightly pulled ponytail at the top of her head that always ended up messy as her hair was not long enough and strands of it would gently fall and frame her thin face. He drew her kind blue eyes that he longed to never see cry again after his father left them for another woman and another family. All of this he drew in a single portrait the day he moved out to pursue his dream in art school.
Molly shrugged, “Maybe he’s just nervous. Not seeing you after all those years. Must be pretty weird to have you here with him. He probably doesn’t know where he stands with you is all.”
“Sherlock there you are! Thank Christ!” he breathed, raising the yellow police tape so Sherlock could walk below it. “We’re stuck here. The man is on the 3
When Sherlock woke up he was still mostly enveloped in darkness. The first wisps of daylight from the sunrise were beaming through the gap between the white curtains. He shifted around, momentarily forgetting why he felt so exhausted and sated but he suddenly realized that what was underneath his head did not feel like a pillow at all and raising his head slightly he turned and was faced with the gorgeous sleeping figure of John Watson.
Sherlock bit his lip, remembering John’s shirt riding up during one of their practices, remembering his pink tongue snaking out to wet his lips after Sherlock said something particularly clever… Sherlock’s breath halted and he looked away, blinking fast. What was going
Panic rose up hot and sharp in Sherlock’s chest. He could picture the way he had left his studio perfectly this morning. Three finished paintings of John Watson decorated the walls. And a fourth one sat almost finished on his easel.
John sighed, a sob threatening to claw its way out of his throat as he pressed his forehead against the wood of the door with a soft thump. He could hear soft whimpers coming from inside of the room and the urge to break down the door and surround Sherlock in a hug was overwhelming. But Sherlock needed space. Even from him. Maybe especially from him.
quite shaken, but in the very best of ways.  He had never even imagined John would ever feel the same about him. And even if they still had to talk, confirm and discuss what they were and meant to each other Sherlock could not remember a time where he had felt more content than he did now lying across John’s chest, hearing his calming heartbeat and sleepy sighs against his hair.
“Yes sir,” they all said, some still grinning, others having the decency to look at the very least slightly guilty. They all rushed out, already whispering excitedly amongst each other, Molly looked back and smiled at him widely.
want to be John’s friend. More than anything he wanted that. But he wanted so much more too. He’d known for a while. Since before he and John had been in touch again, even. But now that John was here again, boyish round face chiselled into a manly, teenage boy’s rugged handsomeness, Sherlock had damn near got all his breath knocked out of his when he saw him sitting at the Gryffindor table that very first day he’d arrived.
Sherlock’s eyes widened. If he’d looked anxious to leave before it was nothing to what he looked like now. He struggled against the hold Anderson had on him, to no avail, and avoided John’s eyes as best he could.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks and bit his lip. It was now or never. John had to know how he felt. He simply had to. And if this was what was going to drive him away… better now.
The sorting ceremony progressed as it did each year.  The sorting hat sang a song and the very frightened pack of first years began shuffling one by one to the very centre of the stage-like platform to try on the hat and test their luck with the houses.
They both turned to look at each other in horror. “SHERLOCK! YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE UP THE ENTIRE CASTLE! DO SOMETHING!”
to spend time with Sherlock. Could it be? Sherlock thought it unlikely but unable to stop himself he blurted out, “Wait! Would you sneak into the greenhouse with me?”.
John straightened up and tried to clear his head of all the overwhelming emotions he was having. He had to find Sherlock. Now.
Sherlock potion has just begun to turn the apparently desired pearly white-lilac when suddenly hoots and flaps of wings could be heard from above.
“Not walk, John! Don’t be ridiculous”. They finally reached the edge of the ice, where Sherlock regretfully let go of John’s wrist and inspected the lake’s surface for a second before seemingly deeming it worthy. “We’re going to ice skate, obviously” he turned to look at John, a huge grin lighting up his face.
“So… you’re John’s friends,” he said a bit awkwardly, John’s heart almost burst with affection for the attempt at conversation.
“Sherlock?” John looked anxious now. He caressed his cheekbone gently with the pads of his thumbs, seemingly trying to soothe him but Sherlock only looked more distressed.
“Mate.. n’ffense. Like. I know you like Mary. But she’s a real jerk.” He stuffed more food into his mouth, still attempting to talk. “You could dho sho muchf beffer thfan her” he garbled out, shrugging.
Sherlock smiled. Every ounce of the self-consciousness he had been feeling vanishing with John Watson’s soft and fond gaze. “You’re welcome” he murmured back.
As soon as they arrived at Sherlock’s place hours later, the smell of Eliza’s chocolate chip cookies filled John up from the instant they walked in, and he was home.
“Oh god, drawing’s hard” John muttered suddenly. “How do you do this? It looks so much easier than it actually is”. He reached for the erased and began rubbing something off the page, much to the artist’s curiosity.
Sherlock straightened up and looked down shyly, his smile still very evident. He walked right up to John and stopped just as their chests touched. “So... are you just going to stare at me? Or are you going to do something about it?”
He drew the memory of their intimate moments into the light reflected from John’s neck and shoulders, the darkening love bites he sucked onto his neck, the remaining redness in his lip, his hair- mussed up by the movements, the squashy pillows and Sherlock’s pulling and caressing fingers. Sherlock lovingly sketched and shaded and drew every part of John into a couple of pages of his notebook.
Biting his lip and remembering the soft feeling of John’s lips against his he closed his eyes and pressed the button on the touch screen, heart hammering away at his chest wildly.
He expected everyone to groan, knowing that one of the student’s favorite parts was always the gesture poses due to their quick nature and lack of need for perfection, it was more about reacting as fast as they could to the way they saw the body before them. But no one made a sound. Turning around to look at his student’s he noticed everyone seemed pretty focused on their drawing, but they looked almost… too focused. As if faking it. As if haven been caught witnessing something they shouldn’t have.
Time slowed as the familiar body of Sherlock Holmes fell through the door frame, all ruffled curls and frowning scowls scrunching up his face. He straightened up, still not tearing his gaze away from Professor Septima. And by
After the mandatory pillow-fight followed they laid back down onto the pillows and stared at the ceiling. They breathed in silence for a few seconds, echoes of their laughter still beating in their chests.
) as he walked him as fast as he could to the hospital wing. The weight of Sherlock’s body on his shoulder was oddly comforting and it suddenly brought back fond (but momentarily unwanted) memories of the day they first met properly and consequently the day they became friends.
Biting his lip and taking a shuddering breath, he clicked it as fast as he could. The world didn’t explode, as expected. The only difference in the room were Sherlock’s brightly coloured cheeks and the button that now read ‘Booked’.
Eliza stayed behind speaking amicably with Angelo as Sherlock and John went out to explore some more for anything else they might need. They passed by the entrance to Nocturnal Alley, John having to hold Sherlock back by the end of his robes to hold him back from sprinting right into it. As much as John was curious, the wizards and witches lurking in the shadows of Nocturnal Alley weren’t people he really wanted to interact with just now.
“Oh. Hi, Molly. What’s up?” John sat up on the common room chair, the old springs on the cushions groaning under the movement. He’d been watching the fire flicker absentmindedly as he thought about Sherlock.
He landed on the ground, expecting Sherlock to joke about how he cheated and didn’t swat it down, but when he turned to look at him grinning Sherlock was just staring at him, gaping. John looked around himself, not knowing what the younger boy was looking so shocked about.
“Was it?” Sherlock shrugged, his eyes going back to his student's drawings as John’s eyes followed him around the room
“Don’t,” he said fiercely. “Don’t say it. Don’t even think it. We are going to figure this out, Sherlock.” He sat next to him, pulling his hands away from his face and finding that pair of remarkable icy green-blue eyes wet and surrounded by red rims. “We are going to figure this out,” John repeated, promising him ferociously. His blue eyes shining with determination.
“If you like I could show you the rest of the files I have on cases. Once, I got a solid 10. Took 2 months to crack the case and I slept around 5 times in total. It was brilliant”
John smiled, kissing his thigh reverently before reaching up and promptly licking a stripe up Sherlock’s length, wrapping his lips on the head, and sucking tenderly. Sherlock had had no idea he could make such a large amount of noise with such a simple touch, but the heat of the other man’s mouth around his was so intense, so incredible.
“Of course... This" he searched for words "This is incredible! I can’t imagine how it must feel to come to this classroom every single day”
John’s breath rushed out as he took in the beautiful image of his best friend. Of his beaming proud smile and the sparkling happiness in his eyes.
John snickered “shhh love, it’s okay” he raised Sherlock’s right hand to his lips and kissed it lightly “I’ll take care of it”. Then he calmly unbuttoned the rest of his shirt, Sherlock watched the process with wide eyes, taking in every sliver of tanned skin John revealed. The fact that John used the word ‘love’ thrummed in his mind in never ending echoes, he felt his blush darkening. Surely John had said it as a reflex, but that didn’t diminish the warmth or the fluttering in Sherlock’s stomach.
John’s lips tightened “I’m sorry, love. I didn’t mean to upset you. We’ll figure this out. I don’t want you to lose your mother over this… I know how important she is to you. But Sherlock. I won't let him get away with this. I don’t know how... but we WILL get your mother away from that man.”
Sherlock nodded, shivering and giving in to closing his eyes. His hands tugged again at John’s hair desperately, urging him silently to do it again. John did not hesitate to nudge at the sensitive nub again, prompting low groans from the artist, his inky curls sticking to his forehead with sweat and his mouth opening with a silent scream. The blonde didn’t resume his attention to the artist’s cock, knowing Sherlock would not last very long if he did, especially if he was reacting this strongly to solely the preparation. He worked from two fingers onto three into Sherlock with infinite patience, relishing in every reaction from the artist’s inexperienced sensitive body.
only. With trembling, excited fingers he turned it over again and broke the wax seal as carefully as he could and finally… pulled out the sheets of paper within the wrapping.
They stayed in comfortable silence for a couple of minutes, letting sleepiness drift back in and the warmth of the bed to diffuse into their bodies once more.
A man that was most certainly not Sherlock was standing there smiling, he was only slightly taller than himself and rather rounded. He had a thick black beard and his long thick hair was pulled back into a messy ponytail. All in all he looked joyful and… jolly for a lack of a better word.
“John.. I…” Sherlock had stood up now, he looked down at the floor as if unable to meet John’s eye. “I… Thank you,” he said.
The excitement within the crowd was now palpable. No other school had come to visit or stay in Hogwarts since the infamous last Triwizard tournament all those years ago when Harry Potter was still attending school.
And quite suddenly John couldn’t help himself any longer. He caught Greg’s happy, understanding eyes and grinned. He then politely but firmly pulled himself away from the team’s embrace and flew upwards into the air, red coat fluttering around his ankles. He zoomed in as fast as he could towards the Slytherin booth, air rushing past and stopped before Sherlock’s surprised figure.
Before he could even get a single word out, however, Sherlock shifted his eyes towards him quickly and said “It’s not Irene, John. I’m not dating Irene”
Sherlock’s face changed immediately, from anger to shock and finally concern. He jumped out of his seat and rushed to his mother’s side. “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry” he hugged her tightly to himself, only prompting more sobs to escape from his mother. She hid her face on his chest.
The blonde grinned up at him, eyes twinkling. “Well then. Let’s enjoy each other’s company. I hear the lasagna here is to die for”.
“You.. should probably get out there” Sherlock smiled. “And..” he hesitated for a second “Be careful” he finished.
Sherlock smiled, a warmth blooming in the centre of his chest at the ‘we’ of the statement. “Yes. We will”.
“Wait…” Sherlock’s eyes widened, trying to understand “Sarah didn’t give you her phone number?” he rushed out, not really meaning to say that but his mouth taking over Sherlock’s still frozen mind. Oh God no.
“WHAT?!” Sherlock finally snapped, but his voice cracked, still uncomprehending of this warmth that had bloomed inside of him at the touch of John. His mind, still revolving around this confusion and the tingling feeling on his scalp where his lips had touched. He begrudgingly turned to stare at his brother, trying to calm his expression and composure into one of pure annoyance and frustration.
Sherlock took a deep breath, willing himself to open his eyes and look at John. His eyes were glazed over and whilst he still didn’t meet John’s eye, he handed over the letter to the Gryffindor. John nodded, as silent thanks, and began to read the letter. Instantly, his blood froze over.
Sherlock hated to admit this. He seriously did. But he had to admit Sarah had a remarkable taste in Italian restaurants. The name of the place was “The Landmark London” and the artist felt chills from the moment they walked in.
He quickly made sure the door was closed with a glance before he slowly raised his hands and cupped Sherlock’s face between them both, “I’ve been waiting all day for this” he said.
When Sherlock woke he had graphite imprints on his cheek in muddled indistinguishable shape from where he had leant on his drawing that might or might not have been of John’s chest. He looked at his clock, knowing that he did not have a class again until Thursday (tomorrow), but still wanting to get ahead with the day.
Sherlock divested John of the rest of his clothing (he was already shirtless so it didn’t take too long) and John pulled insistently at the artist’s briefs until those too slithered to the ground once more. They then both stumbled their way upstairs into the artist’s bedroom.
As much care as John had given him, the first breach into his body was still quite painful, his eyes drawing shut immediately with the overwhelming feeling of the pain/pleasure and his mouth opening in surprise.
“And now we see Holmes and Watson finally getting their act together. About time too, I’d say. Captain Watson will finally have Holmes, and I mean this indelicately”
He stopped in his tracks as he realised he had never seen the model before so he was not sure what lighting would benefit the figure and how it was perceived in all angles of the classroom. He was not used to having new models as there were always very rare in the school’s old system. By now Sherlock knew every single one of them inside out, not just their bodies but their stories and backgrounds. Not that they liked that he knew that very much. No doubt by now the agency and the models had warned the new guy about Sherlock and his tendency to spew out their entire life stories while they posed and shifted under the glaring light of the lamps. Sherlock smirked, already excited about having a fresh new body to unearth secrets from. What you could perceive from staring at someone for hours could not compare to single glances on the busy streets of London.
The students scampered off, which was odd as they usually stayed in for lunch. But they clearly felt dazed and exhausted, the morning never being quite as productive as it had been today. Sherlock quickly asked them to set their homework sketchbooks on the table on their way out for him to check for next week and told them to take 15 minutes extra in their break. The students sighed but did as told, well… most of them. Anderson predictably did not have his homework and came up with a flimsy excuse which Sherlock waved away, not even bothering to look up from his own sketchbook.
Sherlock smiled and burrowed into his mother’s embrace. Perhaps coming with Mycroft had been the best idea.
Sherlock tried to focus on the student’s drawings and stopped in front of Sally’s. He could see some very serious perspective mistakes when it came to John’s upturned arm and how that had been measured against John’s back. His back look far smaller than it actually was, he should know. He looked up and compared the drawing to John silently, and promptly looked down again. On John’s back… he could very faintly see scratch marks. Scratch marks he remembered putting there himself.
But aside from all that… John was also immensely relieved. Relieved that Sherlock was now here with him, safe in his arms. That they had finally spoken about all these things that should've been said so long ago. That Sherlock had not forgotten about him or abandoned him, that he no longer thought John had done those same things to him. He kissed Sherlock softly, tenderly, relishing on finally...
Mrs. Hudson smiled “Its no trouble dear. But don’t get used to it. I’m still not your housekeeper. This is a one-time thing”.
“Look. Is it... other people that you’re worried about? Me finding new friends and somehow against all odds deciding we shouldn’t be friends anymore?”
He’d done all of John’s paintings from memory, and just a couple of quick drawings in class. But now he saw that having the man’s body, living and breathing right in front of him could simply not be compared. His mind could never draw justice to John’s beauty and strength. And the memory behind why John was in front of him now... Of why John was lying before him entirely nude in Sherlock’s bed. Tangled in Sherlock’s bed sheets.
“You know how to use spells?” John marvelled. “And… wands and everything?” his eyes widened in amazement.
“Still…” John shifted against the bed, feeling its soft surface slide against his back. “Are you gonna go... home? Or are you staying here?”
Sherlock scoffed lightly “Hardly. There’s got to be a logical explanation.” The soft huff of John’s muffled giggle followed him and Sherlock’s spirit’s rose a fragment.
“I took John around Diagon Alley to look at the shopth and explain magic.” Sherlock shrugged, straightening himself to try to make himself appear taller. “John’th a muggle born, older magical thibling”
John was flipping through the large drawing pages, mouth gaping in awe. “Sherlock… Every time I think you could get more talented and amazing… these are so wonderful” he looked up at him “It’s like…  I’m watching who I am. Who I am inside when I see your drawings, your paintings.” he said, remembering the many times he had felt that, and the times he had known when Sherlock was looking at him he was looking at everything he was, the good and the bad.
They reached the edge of the police tape, the shorter man rose it as high as he could and guided the artist under it, afterwards ducking down himself.
He opened his eyes, forcing the image of John’s neck and jaw out. This was entirely inappropriate. How would John feel if he knew Sherlock was doing this? It wasn't like he was thinking about John deliberately but still, it was not something Sherlock should be thinking about.
Sherlock nodded furiously, still unable to tear out the words from his throat but very decisively trying to reassure John that that was VERY much okay.
John grimaced, seriously considering ditching the gamer to go looking for Sherlock and tell him that he felt the same. that he had no reason to worry about John’s reaction because he had always felt the same. Even when he did not realize it Sherlock had always been a priority and like Molly had said.. wherever he was and whatever he was doing he would always rather be with Sherlock. Something his past girlfriends or dates had learned the hard way when Sherlock sent John Patronuses at all hours demanding his company whenever he was on dates. It all just seemed painfully obvious to John now why Sherlock had ONLY sent him Patronuses whilst on dates. The small little white glowing Hedgehog running in mid-flight gracefully around only him, never around Mary or Jeannette.. or was her name Amy? Not important.
“So,” John started. Sherlock couldn’t see his face as he coursed through the hotel’s lobby and approached the elevator, but he could tell John was probably looking at him uncertainly, still tentative as to how to act around the artist. “What are we dealing with here?”
If John expected him to book him because he knew Sherlock wanted to and he explicitly said so that would mean… he wasn’t bothered by it. On the other hand how could he not be bothered? So clearly he didn’t know about Sherlock’s little crush. Maybe he just
“Oh uhh.. yeah! I.. was thinking about getting one this summer” John quickly responded, ignoring the blush quickly rising from his neck to his cheeks and thanking Merlin that Molly had not spotted him spying on Sherlock and Irene. People would talk. And the last thing he needed was Sherlock hearing about his friend spying on him.
John shifted closer to Sherlock, his stomach feeling a completely different kind of heavy. Like he was falling all over again.
. They had walked in and the model had made them tea and they had sat on his minuscule couch and watched some crap telly as John coursed his lithe fingers through Sherlock’s curls in an attempt to soothe and make him feel better. John could obviously tell that Sherlock was very deeply upset. But he had not asked again. His eyes never left him, though. The artist wondered if the guilt of asking another woman out was eating at him. He wondered if he was postponing telling the artist until the moment they separated and wouldn’t have to do it in person. Smart John. Keeping his emotions safe. Not letting himself be influenced by other’s.
“Angelo?” Sherlock called, trying his best to look over the counter but so far nothing but his world unruly curls popped out. Angelo turned around and catching sight of them grinned widely.
John’s heart skipped a beat, and he felt his eyes widen. The jealous knot untangling and being replaced with fluttering warmth and hope. “Oh… right. That’s fine”
Sherlock himself was incredibly surprised by how easily he had taken to this new boy. How he had not immediately wanted him to leave him alone. Or how he hadn’t been tired and annoyed by his questions about magic and Hogwarts. John had allowed him to talk, to explain and to even slip in an experiment of his or two into their conversation. John…. Listened. He actually seemed to care? Sherlock found it hard not to stare at the boy in wonder and wonder if maybe this is what it felt to finally have a friend.
Sherlock snorted. “Right. Of course, you lot would think that. What we’re looking at here is clearly a murder.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and looked at him carefully but finding none of the tension he had seen in his friends shoulders and carefully controlled expressions from the past two days. John looked happy. Nervous but happy.
Taking a deep breath (and before he could think too much about it) he scrolled down his contact list until he found John’s number. He had found it on the model’s agency website... hopefully, John wouldn’t find that too creepy. Then again, he already knew that Sherlock knew where he lived so he guessed knowing his phone number was at least a little bit less intrusive.
CANT they just sit down talk and then make out? I'll write faster. The faster I write the faster we can get through this oblivious pining <3<3
“Me either,” said John, discreetly pressing his thigh against Sherlock’s. The Beauxbatons stiffened momentarily in surprise before pressing back shyly. He kept stirring his potion, absolutely not meeting John’s eye when he answered Molly. “I have no need to study for finals. Most teachers just take their information from the middle pages of each chapter, as memory experiments have suggested that the human brain retains the first and the last pieces of information given. Teachers tend to, therefore, pick things that we are most likely to forget in a feeble attempt to make their exams more difficult, and thus, be perceived as harder and more important subjects than they really are.”
John opened his mouth to plead for her to understand that this was in no way, love. Love wasn’t having someone force to move your family away for no reason after knowing how much his son longed to go to a school that had finally accepted him. Love was not to hurt your family, to make them feel less and afraid. He tried to speak. To somehow let her know that he loved them so much more than Sherringford ever could.  That he’d help them somehow. That the thought of not seeing Sherlock and her every summer was so physically painful he could not deal with it. That they were both such wonderful people and did not deserve to have such pain and abuse in their lives. But the words wouldn’t come out.
“No!” John was still laughing, not doubting for one second that Sherlock hadn’t spent his first day at Beauxbatons breaking every rule he could possibly think of at the age of 11.
As soon as John climbed onto the platform and the robe came off Sherlock began moving him around gently for the morning poses and to find the perfect lighting. He inspected John’s body as inconspicuously as he could, trying to see if he could notice any unfamiliar love bites or faint marks of passionate scratches on his skin, but those he found he had vivid memories of leaving there himself. Good. That lifted up his spirits considerably, knowing that at least this woman had still not laid a hand on his John.
John just looked into his eyes for a few moments, “What’s wrong?” he asked, his voice soft “Did Dimmock say something to you?” He paused. Sherlock opened his mouth but nothing came out.
This was the issue with having someone that was more observant than the average person. Sherlock wondered if this is what people felt when he deduced them aloud. Sighing, Sherlock shook his head “He kissed me”
She clicked her tongue, dropping the subject but sending him a sly wink anyway. A sharp memory of himself doing the same to John on his last class here rose in Sherlock’s memory.
“Oh! It’s even better than I imagined! I can’t believe we haven’t been here all year! Such a waste of time!”
Was it considered rude to stare at the woman across the street cooing at the large bat hanging from the dangling cords of her dress? Or was it even worse to stare at the man walking in front of him, who resembled nothing less than a giant with his massive stand and gargantuan hands? John peered at him discreetly; the man was holding in front of himself a large glass tub with a beach ball-sized.. egg? He wasn’t sure what it was exactly, but it looked soft and on the top of the tub, if John leant over, he could just make out the word “Acromantula”. What did that even mean? He shook his head, feeling very small and confused. Perhaps coming here with his sister Harry hadn’t been the best idea, “Diagon Alley”, she’d called it.
“Shut up, Greg” John laughed, swatting his friend on the arm with the back of his hand. Nevertheless, he made absolutely no move to tear his eyes away from the gorgeous crowd of students passing by before him, a quiet parade of beauty. If anything he just seemed more focused on them.
“So, that’s basically a fast version of what I’ve been up to these couple of years… that and Quidditch of course” Sherlock finished.
“Wait- okay? So you’ll stay with me?” John sounded so hopeful, so disbelieving. Sherlock simply had to look up and see all the doubt and hesitation, the anticipation and beginnings of delight forming. He nodded again, more confident this time.
“All okay” he confirmed, squeezing John’s hand and covering John’s top one in his. He wondered how the must look, all hands in a soothing intimate mound between both of their bodies, beaming at each other from across the small round table and leaning as close as they could. They probably blended in with all the couples around them, the artist thought. They probably looked as if they did this sort of thing every night. Easy smiles and shared space, comforting touches and warm gazes.
John smiled, thinking about finally getting to play Quidditch against Sherlock in a more serious setting. He and Sherlock had kept on playing each other every single Friday after class, though lately, John had found it a lot more entertaining to tease Sherlock during it rather than playing just to watch him blush prettily.
Sherlock had realized he was in love with John during a care of magical creatures lesson (of all places), a lesson Gryffindor and Ravenclaw shared for their third year.  Everyone’s favorite professor, Hagrid, had been demonstrating the many ways of approaching and treating a hippogriff, as was customary for a first lesson ever since he had done that with that Potter boy everyone talked about but Sherlock always seemed to delete. (“But it’s Harry freaking Potter!” John would always say. “You don’t understand. He’s a legend to us all! Every son and daughter grew up hearing about you-know-who and-” “I do not know who. Speak properly, John. Stop being tiresome” “You...you don’t know wh-” and the conversation would just go in circles after that). Hagrid now, however, opted for smaller less dangerous hippogriffs as for the students to be in less danger
“Sure thing” John bit Sherlock’s lower lip and pulled it gently, caressing the sting with his tongue and raised himself up to those gorgeous pink lips.
And now a week later, John found himself smack in the middle of the strangest place he had ever seen.
The bus took off and Sherlock frowned at the floor. What had just happened? He rose a hand to his throat trying to make it stop feeling so lodged up and to calm his still racing heart. He felt each thump under his fingertips, reverberating against his ribs and screaming out to him.
John smiled again, the fondness returning with full light to his eyes. “You were worried?” he didn’t sound teasing, for once, he sounded genuine, so Sherlock nodded, still unable to meet his eye.
Sherlock blinked, his eyes glassy. His breathing became ragged, his eyes filling with tears. He turned abruptly, leaving the kitchen in a sprint before anyone could say anything else. John could hear his steps thundering rapidly up the stairs, the hints of a quiet sob muffled through the walls.
“So what if he does? Look. The way I see it you made a connection with someone. Even if you never become anything more, isn’t it enough having someone you click with? Someone that understands you?”
“Whatever. I got them back for you from that Moran guy did I not? And you swore you would not tell him. And I most certainly won’t. So case closed” He sounded agonized, on the verge of a breakdown and it took all John had not to run and embrace him, demand what was wrong and how he could fix it.
Now John was able to stand up. He took the space Sherlock had run away from and wrapped his arms around Eliza, hugging her tightly. He knew it was not his place to tell her what to do. He knew that he couldn’t even begin to understand what had really happened. He knew he couldn’t help her. But comfort. Comfort, he could do.
“So... how was your class today?” John asked, clearly wanting to break the ice that had formed between them once more.
John grasped the back of Sherlock’s hair with one hand, teasingly pulling at the sensitive roots as his other hand travelled around Sherlock’s waist and rubbed soothing circles, inching down slowly. Their chests were pressed tightly together and their lips waking wet sounds into the surrounding space.
John hummed in answer, feeling Sherlock’s breath delicately graze his face. “Yes I…uh.. yeah”  he whispered. Sherlock’s eyes were in a trance, glazed over as he looked down into John’s face. John licked his lips, feeling his heart racing up onto his throat and the warmth emanating from Sherlock into his own body closing in. Sherlock followed John’s tongue’s progress with his eyes, his pupils visibly dilating. John gasped.
“Besides,” added Molly. “If you want things between you to be the way they were you need to confront him. And even more so if you want them to… develop.”
made it explicitly clear to anyone interested that he wasn’t one to introduce to your parents. He wasn’t one to fall in love with. Sure, John had liked a lot of people... some of them quite a lot, but he was missing something… he never quite felt a pull towards any of them. He was missing…
“Who the hell are you?” Anderson laughed. “Leave now. Or regret it blondie”. He grinned, looking pleased with himself. His other two friends didn’t look as sure, already backing away from John’s glare.
“Me too… oh god me too”. They kissed again, slow and unrushed as if they had all the time in the world to just hold each other and kiss.
The knot that for days had twisted Sherlock’s stomach in nerves and the ugly tinge of jealousy let go and in its place he felt the warmth of knowing John was here, he was not going anywhere with anyone else. Slowly, the artist slid his hand down, tugging lightly at the bands tying the model's robe together but John pulled his hand away gently. “Not here love, I'd like to take you to dinner. A proper date, if you will.” He smiled, sweetly, “After all, I already made the reservations.”
“You seem to be able to observe a man’s body well” the critic noted, the wolfish grin back in place and fully revealing his eerily white teeth.
So far John’s favourite shops had been “Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes”, where he’d seen what he believed to be a miniature dragon making the popcorn they sold, and “Quality Quidditch Supplies”. In the latter, Sherlock had rambled about Quidditch as soon as John brought it up, hands moving frantically as he explained the rules and the different balls and brooms and teams. John instantly wanted to play it, impossible as it seemed.
But underneath everything… under all the changes the years had caused in him he still recognised the boy he had known what seemed so so long ago.  A lifetime ago. The boy who had taught him everything he knew about the magical world before coming here. His best friend.
“What? Really?” he grinned, his dimples sinking and his eyebrows rising with excitement. Sherlock instantly decided he never wanted that expression to leave the blonde’s face ever again.
“There is another way!” John suddenly exclaimed. “You don’t have to stay with him! He treats you... he treats
Sherlock smirked, knowing that even if John made fun of him or didn’t believe him he would at least be distracted enough not to be in pain….For the benefit of the students drawing him that needed him to be perfectly still……obviously.
Greg jogged a couple of steps in front of his friend as soon as they reached the field and joined the rest of the team, blushing slightly as he spotted Molly Hooper in the crowd of fans they had gathered through the 2 years of not losing a single Quidditch game, thanks to Captain Watson. He was all set to at least try to talk to her when John commanded firmly that practice had begun in a tense, rather than his usual gentle, tone. The team, immediately sensing John’s mood, quickly arranged themselves in their brooms and bid goodbye to the girls as these backed away towards the stands where Sherlock usually sat, blue Ravenclaw scarf always wrapped up tightly around his pale neck during the fall and winter, to watch John play through his gray calculating eyes.
The greenhouse was completely pitch black. John reached for his wand but Sherlock stopped him. “Don’t,” he said. He came close and whispered into John’s ear, placing a hand on his shoulder. “It’s already dark outside and we’re supposed to be in our beds. Peeves or Filch could see the light.” His warm breaths of air grazed John’s neck softly and John tried his best not to shiver. Sherlock didn’t seem to notice. “Just… let your eyes adjust,” he breathed.
“H-hey!” Sherlock stumbled out. He stared at John in shock for a couple of seconds, blinking silently until John’s happy grin started to waiver.
The morning sunlight streamed through the flowing blinds and the soft wisps of summer air fluttered in, delicately ruffling the white silk. The dust motes drifted lazily in the gentle breeze, disturbed only by Sherlock pacing through them now and then.
He measured and moved and sketched and soon enough John Watson was staring at him from the page. His marked square jaw emphasised and marked by the strong shadows he remembered from the moment he stepped into the room, the sharpness and deepness of his midnight blue eyes and the shocking golden lightning of his hair falling onto his forehead. Even without colour, Sherlock was able to show the subtle changed in the skin of John’s sun-kissed face neck and arms with his slightly paler chest.
Hours later, they were exhausted. The event was doing quite well but Sherlock really couldn’t wait to take John home and rip off his clothes. John felt quite the same, not having been able to focus properly on quite anything since he’d seen Sherlock walk out of their room in those sinfully tight suit pants and purple dress shirt. They walked slowly through the gallery, people still pouring in and the complimentary wine not even near finishing. The interviewers clearly couldn’t have enough of him and kept interrupting him for more pictures, more questions.
“And Sally don’t snicker. I don’t know what on earth you’re doing either. You’re so focused on your drawing you’re not looking at the model at ALL. This is flat. You’re measuring is absolutely atrocious. And you know why that is? Because you’re not looking. Start over.”
A lot of the models surveyed the drawings during their breaks, something Sherlock usually did not even think about twice. But for some reason, he found John’s clear admiration towards the talent of his students very endearing to watch. The sudden urge to show John his own drawings was suddenly completely overpowering. He turned his back to them, trying to block them out again and shaking the ridiculous thought from his mind.
Sherlock had realized that maybe… maybe this was a game he could win. Maybe he could get John to fall in love with him. It certainly seemed like a possibility when the blonde was caressing the inside of his thighs with gentle fingers, and murmuring out encouragements as Sherlock came with a whimper onto his tongue. He pictured what it would be like for John to love him. It seemed... pretty close to what he had now. Except John would tell him he was the only one. Sherlock would
John dropped his glass. It shattered against the hardwood floors with a thundering crash, splinters of glass exploding in all directions but no one flinched. No one even took notice.
Said boy was muttering to himself, practically burrowed inside the book he cradled gently in his hands. John smiled, wondering why on earth he’d been worried and climbing down the rest of the steps on the ladder to make his way to him. He sat down next to him, much to the startlement of the Beauxbatons.
Sherlock stood, crawling onto the desk and next to the model in a desperate need to get closer to him. He already felt his suit pants tightening rapidly as John’s hands became bolder against his neck, caressing the skin up and down, trailing softly over a couple of hidden love bites under his shirt Sherlock had thanked god he had been able to hide from his students (especially Molly) by pulling up his shirts collar. John, instead, lowered himself onto the ground and pulled up Sherlock with him, taking a strong hold onto Sherlock’s waist before his hands reached down and took a hold of his arse, pulling him up and supporting his weight as Sherlock’s legs instinctively wrapped around John’s waist and gasped in surprise and arousal at the clear display of strength.
“Yes, well… I- shut up” muttered Sherlock, getting back into position, Quaffle held safely tucked under his arm and bat on the other, crouching so he could also hold the front end of his broom with the same hand. John held the other Quaffle and bat in a mirror position, flying to his own station gently to prepare for the next round. They’d been at this for a couple of hours, throwing both balls into the air and flying as fast as they could, batting as accurately and hard as they were able to score on each other's hoops and speeding back to protect their own. So far John was winning 150 to 80.
Just as he was rounding the corner he spotted them, three Beauxbatons boys surrounding none other than Sherlock Holmes himself. Sherlock Holmes, who was currently sporting what looked to be a rather impressive scowl considering they were three against one. John could definitely see the trace of fear in his eyes, but he knew that he was probably the only one of them who could. John, unfortunately, still knew Sherlock’s expressions like the palm of his hand after training himself for years to see past the seemingly cool mask of indifference.
Soon enough the students started coming in, carrying their massive sketchbooks and newspaper print paper inside their portfolios. Molly Hooper, as always, was the first one to enter the classroom, coffee in hand and a big smile on her face that contrasted completely with the fatigued looks on the rest of her classmates' sleep-deprived faces. He looked down at his attendance list and ticked the box for today’s class on the row of her name, smirking as she maintained her perfect attendance record while balancing being the most talented student from his class.
John would hastily comply, not willing to delve back into whatever had happened that night. It was a little murky in his mind. The hurt, the followed comfort and then Sherringford’s interruption, his anger. Anger at what? Sherlock? John didn’t understand. Had it been wrong to comfort Sherlock? Somehow… bad? But, why?
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July. Seems like magic does sometimes pick more than one sibling, Mr. Watson.
“Aha!” Greg hissed happily, effectively snapping John out of his mind and into reality.  “Sorting’s over. Bring on the food!” he rubbed his palms together, turning in his seat and facing the plates eagerly.
“NghIdontwanna” Sherlock slurred out, shifting closer into the other man’s chest and hugging him tightly.
“So wait wait.. you’re saying. I saw a man carrying the egg of a man-eating spider today!?” John cried, throwing his arms up in exclamation and attracting a couple of shocked stares from the witches and wizards passing by them in the dimly lit streets of Diagon Alley.
“Yeth, up to 5 meters large. They can eat people, too!” Sherlock grinned as if this was one of the most fascinating facts in the world and not the most horrifying thing John had ever heard.
After short fumbling hands on belt buckles and zippers, they finally managed to get each other naked.
The poses changed and the majority of breaks were forgotten. The energy in the classroom was tense as the students focused on John’s poses and the heavy silence in the room. It felt like an orchestra in crescendo up until the lunch bell rang, everyone blinking around and wondering where the morning had gone. Sherlock looked down at his drawing, seeming almost shocked that he had been drawing at all and not remembering a single second of it. At least not a second where he had taken his eyes off of the model.
The blonde immediately straightened and looked over at Sherlock, a smile already colouring his expression.
“I don’t know what you mean, sir” John’s composure was calm. Eerily so. As if awaiting the moment Sherringford would strike to strike right back. His back was perfectly straight, his hands still and unclenched.
“Christ, Sherlock” John tightened his hold on Sherlock’s hips and pulled him closer to meet the thrust of his hips as the latter pulled off his shirt and threw it across the room, flinging himself back into John’s embrace and claiming his mouth over and over again.
“For Merlin’s sake, Sherlock stop acting like a kicked puppy! Just stop whining and do it” Irene spat at him.
But how to even bring it up? They didn’t really hang out much outside of divination or their occasional Quidditch practices. Mostly because John couldn’t seem to find Sherlock anywhere. Not even the library. He even didn’t even know if Sherlock wanted to be found at all. If he even
A year later they properly met during the first Herbology class. John had seen in his schedule that instead of Hufflepuff this year he’d be sharing Herbology, Charms, and Potions with the Ravenclaws with dread, not a feeling he was alone in, however. “Oh boy. Looks like we have Holmes this year” Greg had muttered sadly.
The woman finally came into view, rushing towards them. She was very tall and slender, with kind green eyes and the same curls Sherlock had falling onto her thin shoulders. “Come, sweetheart, Mycroft had finally finished with his shopping and- Oh”. She suddenly stopped short, spotting John. “Hello,” she smiled, sending a curious and surprised look to the smaller boy next to him.
grew so did the increasingly filthy whispers, the shuddering sighs, the stuttered ‘ah’s drawn from their throats. The desire to soothe the ache to feel each other pulsed between them as their bodies glided sensually against each other.
?” Sherlock looked absolutely stricken at the idea that one could spend time in Hogwarts more than a day without breaking rules of any kind.
John joined him, tangling his fingers in the back of Sherlock’s neck and pulling him in to taste those lips again. They kissed blissfully, with no intention of carrying it any further, just basking in feeling each other's bodies pressed against their own and for once, in years and years of aching, no longer feeling alone.
Later that morning breakfast (a single piece of toast with some jam spread on top) Sherlock headed to his study once again.
The class was dead silent. All completely shocked by the powerful and potent effect the smell of the potion had had on the Ravenclaw. Even Sally stood transfixed staring open mouthed as John knelt beside his friend.
The experiments in emotional outbursts stopped, much to John’s both relief and disappointment. He had expected Sherlock’s mood to be all over the place, one second irritated and the next sulking. But he just seemed… off. For the past few days, they’d done little more than sit quietly together, reading books from the Holmes’s extensive collection on every subject imaginable. Since meeting John Eliza had made a point of purchasing plenty of Muggle-published books too, that Sherlock if anything found even more fascinating. He was currently flipping through a book about Apiology and bee-keeping, his back against their usual tree.
“That’s great,” John murmured, creeping closer still until his chest was pressed against Sherlock’s back, moving as if he just meant to peer over his shoulder at whatever progress he was doing with the padlocks. “Looks like you’ve already opened most of them. Quite brilliant”. Sherlock was frozen solid against him, not tense just… shocked. John could almost feel the boy’s rattling breath as he tried to speak, but in wake of his failure, he settled with a single nod.
Sherlock shook his head “No, I think you’re brave. I don’t think I could do that. And I imagine you left people behind. Your parents, sibling… significant other?”
“I work in the school cafeteria so it was really no trouble getting it from his room. I owe that man my life” Angelo beamed. “You take care of that more carefully!” he laughed, already turning away and raising a hand in farewell.
“Oh bollocks, sorry!” Greg let go of her and John took his place for his hug. Greg just joined and hugged them both. Molly laughed.
Mycroft had stopped reading. Sherlock didn’t know if it was because every sound had faded into the background into white noise and he too had noticed or if he’d finally shut up from his muttering about his potions homework.
galleries.” Sherlock said “But there’s so much unnecessary interaction. Look at the art. Buy what you like. Leave. Why do you need to talk to me?”
things. The last thing he wanted to do was show John how insecure he was about the bond they were slowly forming again. He was so scared he would somehow break it… again. After having barely survived all those years without John, he didn’t know what he would do if it happened all over again. And if John knew… if he
“Not your father then?” John prompted carefully, taking a long sip himself. The tea, as expected, was perfect.
Sherlock kept his eyes steadily fixed on the ground as to avoid looking directly at John. When he had offered to teach John to skate he really hadn’t thought it all the way through. Now he could feel John’s body heat through his gloves. He could feel his breaths drifting towards him as the misty words they exchanged intermingled in the air between them. Sherlock could feel John’s eyes on his face, but he just couldn’t look back at him. He couldn’t do it without giving it away. Without accidentally showing John that he was pretty sure he had fallen completely head over heels in love with him.
She shook her head slowly, unwilling. She gasped out a couple of breaths trying to compose herself. “Oh, Sherlock… my darling… I-”
One of the flower pots exploded behind Sherringford, causing him to startle and jump away from Eliza who’s head snapped in alarm at the sound. The flowers inside fell, some onto the ground and some onto the sink, covering everything in roots, petals, and soil. Sherringford snapped his head towards the door, spotting John for the first time. He glared, first at John and then at Eliza, finally standing up straight before walking out of the kitchen, shoving John unceremoniously out of the way. John stumbled, but glared right back at him, not backing down.
They walked back into the streets of Diagon Alley with pockets full of the candy Sherlock had pointed out Angelo. And before John could reach into his pockets Angelo had stopped him with a firm head shake. “On the house! Anything for The Holmes’s family and their friends”.
Sherlock attached his lips to the edge blonde’s jaw, hiding his scarlet blush. “Me too John… Even with all the hours I’ve drawn you, the hours you’ve modelled for me... it’s not enough. I need more.”
He looked down onto the ground and the mattress John had set out for him. “Right” he breathed in. He looked down, gulping. John stood beside him, clutching the branch of a massive tree where the house had been built on. “Are you sure about this Sherlock? You… don’t seem too sure”
Sherlock’s frown disappeared and he looked over at John as if expecting him to scoff and decline but John’s smile had returned and as his eyes met Sherlock’s the smaller boy could see a sparkle of hope in the deep blue irises. Sherlock looked him up and down, forcing himself to observe more from John’s stance and appearance. Clearly, the mention of his parents, along with his already given deduction about John’ long hair when summed up to John’s small clothes that he had clearly outgrown a while ago strongly suggested that John was unhappy in his family life. He didn’t know why but even when he barely knew the boy in front of him the sudden need to protect him from whatever kept that big smile off his face was undeniable and strong.
John nodded slowly, “I think so… back then I didn’t even know what I wanted. I didn’t know what it even MEANT to want but. I just wanted to be close to you. It was like a pull”.
“Great. We’ll begin immediately if that’s alright with you. The changing screen is over there” he motioned towards the left corner of the room with his head, trying not to blush at John’s easy going smile. Why had his pulse suddenly elevated?
They were just walking past Eeylops Owl Emporium, when John stopped, gazing at one of the owls within the shop with wide eyes. It was a white and gold barn owl, with a small pointy beak and two marble black eyes, staring at him intently. It turned its head, curiously as John did the same.
The tumult of information on “The magical world” was overwhelming. And Harry listened to every word as their strange visitor informed her of this world where she now belonged, and a mysterious school called.. what was it called? Hot-darts? Hogs-warts? Either was John barely understood a word spoken as he stared at the surreal scene before him on his living-room. He listened and he watched nonetheless, face scrunched up in concentration as he watched his sister smile grow wider and wider and his parents’ expression grow from confusion to surprise and finally set into neutral indifference. As they always managed to.
. He thought sadly, wondering how Irene connected with broomstick wood and summer if she couldn’t even play Quidditch and, as far as John knew she and Sherlock had never spent time together during the summer. Or had they?. Had Sherlock been hiding this relationship for longer than 5 days? Had he been hiding it for months? ...Years??
The Gryffindor crouched behind one of the heaviest, thickest books and leaned forward to observe, narrowing his eyes in annoyance as Irene shamelessly flirted with Sherlock. She was tossing her hair back and batting her perfectly curled eyelashes, laughing at his cutting and harsh one worded responses and stroking his arm. John was not happy.
John hadn’t been sure that taking divination had been a good subject choice but since Mary, a gorgeous blonde Beauxbaton, had come into the class and sat across from him he had been pleased with his decision.
John opened his mouth again. Perhaps to ask, to understand why Sherlock was looking at him in bemusement, in bewilderment. He leant closer in his search, their noses inches apart. But before he could get out any words-
had introduced you to. I felt robbed. Unreasonably betrayed. During my family's move to France my father gave away most of our things, my owl included. The only one that remained was the house owl, whom I was not allowed to use”. Sherlock swallowed, and sat up straighter, their thighs were still touching as they looked at each other, but there was no other point of contact.
“What can I get you boys?” the booming voice of the waiter resounded between them, bursting their tiny shared moment.
They kissed and kissed. Whether it was for minutes or hours they didn’t know, but by the time they pulled away gasping for breath night had enveloped the room around them. The city lights and the moon shone brightly, and slowly they both lied on their backs catching their breath, panting together.
Finally being here at Hogwarts, so close to the best friend he’d ever had was just so surreal. He’d thought of this, dreamed of this. He could feel John’s heart beating against his as their chests pressed together, somehow the reality even better than all of his imaginings. And there had been plenty.
The boy’s rosy cheeks darkened into a fierce red and he quickly looked down and mumbled a “thankth” clearly he wasn’t very used to receiving compliments. John’s smile grew wider, feeling an unexplainable fondness for the smaller boy. “I’m John, by the way. John Watson” he extended his hand, as he’d seen his father do when meeting new people.
“Team!” He shouted, catching their attention instantly. “Let’s stop slacking off and let's play some real Quidditch!” he grinned. A small part of him couldn’t help but want to show off a little bit in front of his curly haired friend.
He walked into the library, determined to focus his energy on his potions homework and searched for the section on the ‘drought of the living dead’ potion for his three scroll essay. He was just finishing up taking all the books he thought he would e useful from the top shelf when he heard some muttering coming from the other side of the bookshelf. He stepped down and removed some lower books from eye level. Instantly, he spotted none other than Sherlock himself.
“Of course!” Trelawney glided gracefully across the room and close to the entrance to her classroom. “I saw this coming, you know. That’s why I saved up an empty seat. Just for him”. She motioned to the only empty table, the closest one to the door. She looked quite pleased with herself, though John suspected one of the students that had filled up the class had simply decided not to show up and had thus left a vacated seat.
They both separated with a soft wet sound and whipped their heads around towards the source of the voice.
Sherlock smiled. “Well, some are definitely more entertaining than others. What’s not to love about a man-eating shark? James Bond, on the other hand…”
John laughed, nudging Sherlock with his elbow gently. Sherlock elbowed back huffing out his own begrudging laugh. Going camping had been Sherlock’s idea after John had described a couple of his camping trips with his grandparents and his sister. Mycroft had helped them build a small fire and they’d roasted smores, which Sherlock adored instantly, and dared each other to finish an entire packet of Bertie Bots every flavoured beans. In the end, John had only almost thrown up twice and Sherlock once. A true success.
That effectively stopped Sherlock’s rapid train of thought. John wanted him to follow? Where? What had just happened? He hated not knowing exactly what was going on. “Huh?” he asked, stupidly.
John had looked at the floor in disappointment and nodded as the woman bade him goodbye. He had sighed sadly but gone back inside, a spark of hope still fluttering inside him and pride for his sister shining through his ocean blue eyes.
Eventually, he had graduated from Baker’s Art College with honors and an immense amount of talent but  without finding that one thing he yearned for.
Much later that night John headed back to his room. Sherlock headed back to his own temporary common room with the Ravenclaws, though not before they both shared a charged goodbye that left John in something not unlike a trance throughout the entire walk to the Gryffindor common room.
known all along. Took him long enough to figure it out. Sherlock might be right… he probably WAS an idiot. But now the question was... did Sherlock feel the same? John wasn’t so sure that he did or didn’t. Either way, he thought, still bantering about it with his friends, no harm in some innocent flirting… a tease then and there... a brush of an arm… And John didn’t like to brag but Greg was right. He was pretty damn good at it.
“Me too. I’ll take uh- this.” Sherlock reached for a ‘peruvian instant darkness powder’ and handed it to the girl as she approached the counter, eyeing them both suspiciously as if they would suddenly just grab each other and start groping again. John didn’t blame her. It was what he really wanted to do, anyway.
Greg nodded alongside her. “Yeah mate, I was all the way across from the pitch and man… that was a nasty fall. I flew as fast as a could but Sherlock caught you first,” he smiled. “I like that bloke, John. He’s a keeper. I mean. Not literally. Cause y’know. He’s a Seeker. But. Y’know what I mean.”
“Yes. I should think so. We’ll start with 3-minute gesture poses and then with half hour ones. Would you rather do standing up poses in this morning session or in the afternoon session?” Sherlock asked, not making eye contact but pleased that his voice sounded completely natural and calm. He stood up from his chair and walked over next to John who was stepping onto the platform at the centre of the room. The students were also beginning to get up from their stools and were stretching their arms or choosing charcoal for the gesture poses in the first hour.
“Five serial murders and now an innocent husband. It’s Christmas!” Sherlock enthused, zipping up the bag and throwing it over his shoulder.
Whatever the reason Sherlock couldn’t just pass up on the opportunity to see John again next week. For two whole classes. Hours and hours of John time. Wonderful.
Sherlock had never in his whole teaching career booked a teacher twice in a row. Ever. He just hoped nobody asked why.
“This man was a serial adulterer who cheated on his wife repeatedly. She found out and thought murder was the best revenge. She paid the security guard to edit and change the tapes to show the second tape at a different time. The second tape, in fact, takes place only a couple of minutes after he arrives. The people in the distance having a conversation are the very same ones. The second tape is probably the man going out to collect his lover from the cab but it is just cut short as the man leaves the frame.”
John had been absolutely ecstatic about the broom and had hugged Sherlock for at least 5 minutes before he had had to push him away and adjust his school robes before John noticed that Sherlock was….physically responding, to put it delicately.
In front of one of the doors, several policemen stood, some discussing in quiet murmurs and a couple taking evidence photographs or taking notes of their observations. As Sherlock and John approached the room Sherlock could see another couple of policemen and women taking dust and DNA samples from the body sprawled face up in the center of the room.
Seconds ticked by. He forced himself to turn away again, to walk away from this boy and save himself from the inevitable hurt of Sherlock pushing him away again.
Beaming back, the expression still feeling slightly foreign on his features, Sherlock just shrugged “I told you it was psychosomatic. You just needed to be distracted”
