It was Commander Steve Rogers, surfing the crest on the wave of his popularity as savior of the planet, wielding his newfound political clout and power as America’s top cop with all of his usual subtlety – and the subtlety of a man who goes around dressed in the colors of America’s flag, is of course, close to nonexistent – who browbeats and hectors until Tony’s probable sentence goes down from execution, to life imprisonment, then finally to exile.
“Lying doesn’t suit you, Pinocchio. You know better than anyone exactly what’s been in my ass-”
There’s a part of Tony that finds that morbidly funny.
“If you say so.” Tony arches an eyebrow. “Who told you where to find me?”
“Your eyes are red,” Tony notes. “A few tears for your ex-boss?”
“Protective.” Steve nods. “They’re not my biggest fans, are they?”
“It’s not your turn tonight,” Steve says, but he budges over all the same.
is Steve doing this?
to take back; some differences that might be too far apart to bridge; mistakes that are too terrible to forgive.”
who’s ruining the moment?”
“With Hogan’s accident,” Steve says, and Tony’s attention snaps back to the conversation like a rubber band, stinging and smarting. He can tell that this question is one Steve has been marinating in for a long time. Tony wants to give Steve the answer that will make the strained contours of Steve’s features soften, but he’s rather sick of lying to Steve.
“I can’t-” Steve cuts himself off, swallowing spasmodically. “I can’t sleep with you if it’s just sex, Tony. I want more than that. I’ve always wanted more than that. I’m not like Pepper or Rhodes or Happy.”
Tony pulls back after a few moments, surveying his handiwork. Pepper’s breasts heaves, pebbling and glistening wetly. She has her head thrown back, face flushed, green eyes blazing like twin comets, glorious scarlet hair tumbling magnificently down her shoulders.
Tony shrinks away from his intent gaze. “It was never just sex with them.”
“I understand,” Steve says quietly.
“I know I’m not an evil person,” Tony says, which seems to surprise Steve into a fugacious silence. “I’ve made mistakes, yes. But I know I’m not Satan incarnate. If I was, you wouldn’t have fought so hard for me in court, and you wouldn’t be here now. But am I a
“Then what was it?” Steve snarls. “Because I wasn’t clever enough, is that it? You didn’t tell me because you didn’t think I’d be
Tony cannot do this. He cannot face them. It’s easier to envision them all hating him, one clean break and that’s it. He finds now that it’s more excruciating to be presented with hope at a time and place when he has little to lose anymore, to hang in that ambiguous period of suspension, waiting for his former teammates to make up their minds about whether or not they hate him.
Steve pulls Tony off the swing. Even standing on solid land, Tony still feels like the ground is undulating beneath his feet.
They used to live half in each other’s pockets all the time – at the Mansion and then the Tower. Sharing mugs and meals. Steve’s sketches and charcoals scattered in among Tony’s tools in his workshop. Tony’s favored coffee beans stocked in the kitchen cupboards in Steve’s apartment. But this execrable facsimile of those times, right here after everything that has happened, hurts Tony like a rusty knife to the stomach.
“Even worse.”
Pepper:
“Hard standard you’re asking me to live up to here,” Rhodey says, an edge of plaintiveness in his voice.
He’s an observer inside his own body, a puppet dancing on strings, a passenger in his own car with someone else at the wheel – not Happy, because Happy is dead, and that’s Tony’s fault as well.
person? I don’t know the answer to that. I don’t think you do either.
“Priorities, platypus,” Tony insists. “Damage control, now. Emotional heart-to-heart, hopefully never.”
“You’re right. Pep probably wants a turn.”
Tony turns to look at him, still speaking in that horribly empty tone. “I don’t fall in love with the people I can’t bear to lose, Steve.” A single tear slips down his cheek. “It hurts too much.”
“Funny things are.” Tony grins. Steve glunches at him until Tony subsides. “What do you want me to say, Steve?” he asks softly.
“I’m not,” Steve says.
Now that Tony is looking, other familiar figures jump out at him: Peter Parker, Clint Barton, Thor as his mortal alter ego Don Blake. Tony is at a loss. Why are they here? Tony’s done a lot of morally dubious things, made a lot of bad choices, hurt a lot of people in his checkered life. But arguably, in terms of personal betrayal, Peter and Thor top the chart of
“Seems like a nice sort of man,” Mr. Dickens would say if asked about ‘Tai Sandoval’. He’s the owner of the hardware store – an ancient man with a shiny bald head and brown tanned skin, with a genial grandfatherly air.
Out of the small tub, the puppy shakes himself violently, spraying water everywhere. Tony looks down at his plain white T-shirt, speckled with dark wet spots, and sighs in exasperation. He pats the puppy down with a warm fluffy towel, being very gentle when he reaches the puppy’s half-bitten right ear.
“You’re a pain in my ass,” Tony says to the dead spider.
There’s a lot of tongue.
Steve touches his wrist, fingers wrapping featherlight around Tony’s pulse. “I think you should read those before you decide for sure,” Steve whispers.
Steve runs a hand over his face. “I want you to be,” he confesses.
“She’s not my girlfriend.”
Well used to Tony’s numerous and motley eccentricities, Pepper and Rhodey merely accept the lackluster explanation and move on.
“Rhodey.”
“I was a bit pressed for time,” Nick says brusquely. “The world doesn’t stop needing to be saved just cause you two clowns ran off into the Canadian sunset together to play house.”
be forgiven.”
“Happy isn’t really the word I would use. Smug would be more appropriate. Complacent. Wisenheimer. Schadenfreude.”
“Oh, no,” Steve says, wrapping his other arm around Tony’s waist for good measure. “You’re not running away from this discussion, Tony. Answer the question.”
“How old are you? Four?”
Steve wipes away his tear. “And me?”
Nick Fury puffs on his joint. The end of his cigarette glows red and smoke plumes thickly in the air. Night is falling quickly, the daylight fading around them. Dressed all in black, Nick Fury blends in with the lengthening shadows and Tony can only pinpoint his position by the glowing red laser-like dot of his cigarette. The air is filled with the scent of burning tobacco. Tony clears his throat, waving the grey fumes out of his face. Fury looks exactly the same, as he always does – a trench coat over a standard SHIELD uniform similar to the one Tony wore during his days as Director of SHIELD.
“Maybe he doesn’t need to be the one to save the world this time.”
“Nah,” Tony says blithely. “The world’s pretty sick of Iron Men nowadays. War Machine – that sounds like a hero for the future.”
It’s not chaste.
“Well…” Tony says in a wheedling voice. “I might have… lethiminsideandagreedtotalkwithhimtonight.”
As much as Gerald loves autumn and summer, he turns out not to be a fan of snow. The puppy gets into the habit of slinking out of his Iron Man themed dog-bed (“It’s funny!” Tony insists to Rhodey, when he just sighs and shakes his head.) and into Tony’s own, the puppy curling up against his chest, shivering and whimpering pitifully until he caves and lets him stay there. Eventually, even Tony gets sick of the wintry temperatures, of shivering under the blankets all night, his face and limbs numb from the frosty weather, and their sleeping arrangement migrates to a blanket fort thrown together in front of the Stark-modified electric heater, cranking it up until Tony’s breath no longer fogs up in front of his face and he can feel all his parts again.
“An allergic reaction to the sound of my voice. I assure you, you’re not alone. You all should start a club.”
Okay.
“Who’s amused? I’m not amused. If anything, I’m disturbed to realize that Namor, Barnes, and I now have something in common. We can be the founding members of a club, get badges and matching T-shirts for all of Steve Roger’s morally dubious formerly best friends of the future.”
“Ouch.” Tony exaggeratedly massages his chest, making a wounded face. “Back to last names? I’m hurt, Steven. You’ve hurt me. I thought we were closer than this.”
Steve continues to gawk. It stops mizzling. Tony isn’t even lightly sprayed.
“Do you have a problem with it?” Tony arches an eyebrow, daring him to say yes.
each other. It’s a process that would probably be substantially accelerated by seeking counselling, something which Pepper brings up once, and Tony responds about how he thinks that drowning on dry land sounds more pleasant.
“No, because the only time you sound this level-headed is when you’re very decisively not.”
Tony narrows his own blue eyes. “I’m not taking you home with me.”
With a minimum quantum of shouting.
And just when the latest turmoil in Tony Stark’s life only barely starts making sense, Nick Fury shows up on his doorstep with a summons.
All the networks cover it live. Everyone on the planet sees it.
It’s very tiring. Tiptoeing around someone else in Tony’s own home.
“Of course, you didn’t,” Tony says flippantly. “Because you’re a very polite person.”
“What?”
“But you want to,” Tony observes, a wily cadence to his tone. “I’d recognize that pissed-off self-righteous look of yours anywhere. Well, go on. Don’t hold back on my account. But sit down first. I don’t want to stare up your nose while you do it. It’s not your best angle.”
“Tones.”
The two men part.
“Maybe these particular mistakes
Tony inattentively starts to clean his grease-stained hands on the hem of his shirt – originally white, but now so stained with dark oil that never washes out that it resembles an abstract painting done in black dyes against a backdrop of grey canvas.
“Tones.” Rhodey’s dark eyes are soft and understanding. “Call us, okay? Every week just to let us know you’re alive. And we’ll visit when you’re ready to see us again.”
Despite that, there they stand, Maria Hill on one side of Tony and Dum-Dum Dugan on the other, as they have so many times before in vastly dissimilar circumstances, when Tony was their superior and not a prisoner. The reporters try to swarm, but Maria and Dugan clear the way to the exit with liberal use of elbows and sneaky applications of feet against shins. Tony ducks his head and permits himself a ghost of a grin.
ically!) knowing what’s coming but still rooted to the spot, watching and waiting for the tsunamic wave to swallow him whole.
Tony meets his eyes evenly. “I can say that because I know what the alternative is.” He lets a mirthless smile curve his lips. “Did you remember when I told you about Project Wideawake, Steve?”
Tony has done the impossible. He’s rendered Steve Rogers totally silent.
“You don’t have to tell me where I fucked up,” Tony says morosely. “I’ve had plenty of time to figure that out myself.”
It’s at this low, low point that Tony realize, much to his own mortified outrage (and Pepper and Rhodey’s endless amusement) that he can now distinguish between Jack Pines and Red Pines and other disparate tree types. It’s come to that.
(No, Tony isn’t giving baby-talk to a
What can he say? He’s used to paying Pepper to manage every aspect of his life, including the style of interior decoration and choices of paint swatches.
The next day, Pepper and Rhodey turn up at Tony’s doorstep, luggage in hand.
“So, you
“Nick.”
Tony flinches, then tries to play it off as a shrug, though he doubts Steve is fooled. “No, it doesn’t,” He admits.
Tony doesn’t expect him to.
“Did they want it to be?” Steve asks acutely.
“That will be all, Miss Potts,” Tony says in a gracious tone.
In the end, the bad seemed to outweigh the good. Then Rhodey came with his suspicions and his subtle disapproval, and Tony started second-guessing his decision. After all, Rhodey knew him the longest and the best out of everyone, and if he thought there was something more to it –
Tony tilts his head toward the cabin’s open windows, through which he can hear Steve watching the TV at an aggressively loud volume. “He turn you down?”
“Colonel Rhodes.” Steve gets to his feet, eyes flicking down to the suitcases. “Tony didn’t mention you were planning to stay.”
“Do you have extra mattresses or something?” Tony hears Steve say, when his ears finally stop buzzing. “We can make a camp-bed. Or I can take the couch. I’m not thrilled about sharing a room with Rhodes or Mrs. Potts, if I’m entirely honest.”
On the other side of the world, a butterfly flaps its wings.
“You’re such a big baby.” Tony rolls his eyes. “I’m sure Pepper will kiss it better.”
His wife is a wispy slip of a woman with short silver curls, who never fails to offer ‘Tai Sandoval’ some of her homemade cookies because “You look half-starved, you poor boy! Do an old woman a favor and let her put some meat on your bones!”
Pepper’s hands find Tony’s own, traveling up his forearms, biceps, shoulders, stopping at his neck and digging her fingers into the tense knot of his corded muscles, kneading the stiff tendons at the junction of his shoulders and neck. Tony’s entire body shudders. He closes his stinging eyes, leans forward and rests his forehead against Pepper’s chest. Pepper Potts is all soft curves and pink jammies and slender wrists. Pepper Potts is diamond-hard eyes and spine of steel and heart of gold. Pepper Potts is a contradiction and a brain teaser and an imbroglio and Tony can spend the rest of his days trying to puzzle her out and die a happy man.
. Tony reckons he’s not the only one who’s unpleasantly recollecting old times.
“No loophole,” Steve says obdurately. “You’ll have me as long as you want me.”
surprise me, Stark? Rogers. I was so sure he’d jump on the chance to get back into the fight. Never thought he was physically capable of turning his back on a righteous cause and burying his head in the metaphorical Canadian sand.”
“Well, you did kind of deserve it,” Steve intones.
“Strength ordained out of the mouth of a futurist and all.”
All the blood in Tony’s body is rushing to his brain. His vision is swimming. The motion of the swing makes him feel sick. The coffee, burritos and blueberry smoothie he had for lunch slosh around in his stomach.
can. I
There was once a time when Tony knew every facet of Steve’s expression like the pages of his favorite book. He knew the way Steve smiled when he was happy, the almost languid cast of his facial muscles when he was relaxed or content, how his brows knotted in worry, the tightness around his eyes when he was stressed or tired, his clenched jaw when he was angry or frustrated, the way his blue eyes darkened or lightened depending on the changes of his mood.
“I’m not entirely surprised.” Nick sounds insouciant, for all that he keeps expounding on the dire global threat about to end life as they all know it. “But you know what
“Talking to you always makes me feel so optimistic about my life choices.”
“Speaking from experience, Tones?” Rhodey says dryly.
“Miss Potts.”
“Married couples fight all the time,” Tony says wisely. “Then afterwards they make up. Or they get couples’ counselling. And a select minority end up suing each other when they can’t agree on who gets what during the divorce, flaunting their private dirty laundry to all and sundry during months of tedious court hearings.”
“And Hogan…”
Hah. Happy.
The interruption is like a cold bucket of water, disrupting their reverie. Tony looks at Steve, who has turned away, his shoulders set, hands on his hips. He can’t see Steve’s face, but he can sense the super soldier all but physically withdrawing from him. A yawning chasm stretches out between them, and if Tony doesn’t do anything to close the gap now –
Tony’s eyes snap open. He looks at Nick wildly, irascibly, almost terror-stricken.
Carol Danvers, wearing a white jacket and an impressive scowl. Simon Williams standing next to her, red shades obscuring his expression. Natasha Romanoff, almost unrecognizable in a short blonde wig. Jarvis, looking somber.
Few Americans will ever forget where they were when Captain American was shot down at the courthouse steps.
“We got you a house. The documents are in the blue folder,” Pepper continues. “A property owned by one of our holding companies.”
“If I told you we could get you a pardon, would you want to come back?” Steve asks, out of left field.
, Rhodey. Don’t be ridiculous. He’ll crush anyone who insinuates otherwise.)
“And move your bike before it crushes my potatoes,” Tony says.
He tells himself.
Steve is the one to make Tony cry this time. Steve leaves. Then he comes back again.
It’s not like Steve at all. Steve Rogers is quick to anger and slow to forgive and forget. Tony would have put money on him leading the charge to see Tony properly punished for criminal negligence, instead, Rogers does
“You don’t pay me anything anymore,” Pepper says, the cutthroat.)
“I did,” Tony says in a shaky voice. “It wasn’t a matter of trust.”
“Stop it.” Tony admonishes himself sternly.
“Hm?” Tony says absently.
Steve sits in one of the leather couches, sketchbook on his lap and charcoal in hand. He looks up with a welcoming smile that stiffens when he sees exactly who Tony’s companions are.
“Sounds like a hard man to love, your buddy Wilson. He can give Pepper and Rhodey lessons.” Tony scoffs. “You know that before I gave him the shield, Barnes broke into my office on the Helicarrier and did his best to murder me?”
So, when Pepper’s address leads him to a piece of property
He needs to leave.
“I assume you don’t feel too bad about Rogers being there if you still have the energy to be this insufferable. Phew. For a moment there, I was getting worried.”
Tony pats Steve’s cheek. He wants Steve’s attention on
“I believed you when you said you didn’t know anything about it,” Tony says, sounding more defensive than warranted.
“Wow,” Tony says, inappropriately impressed. “I’m ruining your love life when we’re not even in the same country. I had no idea my influence has spread so far.”
Looking back, Tony doesn’t even remember what set them off.
“Tough choice,” Tony says scornfully. “One kills pests for me. The other two are nosy busy-bodies who can’t leave things well enough alone.”
say?”
Tony glances briefly at his name untidily scrawled on the topmost envelope, recognizes the chicken scratch handwriting, and feels all the blood in his veins turn to ice. His heart seems to stop. His lips move. His voice is barely audible.
They coexist.
“I didn’t. I told him I was late for work. Then I drove off.”
Then the golden portal – the glowing doorway –
Tony had this once.
“I can see why they call you a tactical genius.”
A muscle in Steve’s jaw twitches. Tony recognizes the constipated, slightly nauseated expression, and decides to wait him out. Steve has his teeth clenched together like he’s forcibly trying to keep whatever he wants to say in.
And he thought he couldn’t feel like a shittier human being than before.
Tony pivots slowly on his heel, looking around. He identifies most of the trees as being either coniferous or deciduous, plus a few flowering shrubs. The evening summer air smells earthy and woodsy, overlaid with the rich scent of pine needles.
Norman Osborne never comes into power. He and his Thunderbolts fade back into obscurity.
“They’re hurting me now,” Rhodey says cantankerously.
, Tony.”
“No, it couldn’t.”
Not because of pride either. Pride is not and has never been an issue between Tony and Pepper and Rhodey. Pepper and Rhodey (and Happy, but that still kind of hurts to think of) have seen Tony drink his entire life’s work down the drain, seen him at his most villainous during the Superhero Civil War, seen him at his most twisted and broken and stood by him even during the very worst and the lowest points of his life. Tony can be as prideful as he wants with everyone – everyone except them.
When night falls, the roof – which has several wooden planks missing and is thus open to the elements – emits a series of screeching sounds and a swarm of
“Worse than Skrulls?”
“There’s no use dropping hints with
“I’m sorry.”
. And the last time they spoke, Clint has made it very clear that he considers whatever friendship existed between them over.
Tony only half-heartedly tries to dissuade them before surrendering to the inevitable. “Hey, Steve!” he calls as they walk into the living room. “Look who turned up!”
“We’ve created a monster,” Pepper tells Rhodey.
“She thinks I’m unhealthily fixated on you because of our past,” Steve says candidly.
“No, Tony.”
Steve’s lips are unresponsive beneath Tony’s. But when Tony starts to pull away, Steve unfreezes like someone hit the ‘play’ button on a video, muscles flexing as he bodily hauls Tony to straddle his lap. Steve squeezes Tony’s ass, grinding their hips together. Tony gasps out of surprise more than anything else, and Steve takes the opportunity to claim his lips again, plundering Tony’s mouth, one hand gripping Tony’s hair to tilt his head however Steve likes it.
Rhodey is, in fact, still stuck on
It takes a while for Tony to hear him. “Sorry. What?” He makes himself stop staring like a creep.
“I sometimes think my life would be so much easier if you just stood in the corner and look pretty.”
. They manage to avoid major injury, but they knock over the TV remote as well, and Gerald seizes the narrow window of opportunity. The puppy pounces, fastens his jaws around the controller, gnawing. The screen, playing an advertisement for KFC’s chicken and waffle meal set, starts blaring at an unbearably loud volume. Tony wrests the remote from Gerald’s slobbery jaws and presses the red off button. The screen turns black and falls blessedly silent.
At one point, he isn’t sure when, he starts holding Pepper and Rhodey’s hands, the way he hasn’t held anyone’s since he was very small. Pepper and Rhodey don’t comment on it, even though the grip must be cutting off the circulation to their fingers. They sit in silence, counting down the seconds, listening to the rumble of the van’s engine, soaking up each other’s presence like sponges soaking up water, like sunflowers soaking up the sunlight, like a Roomba sucking up grit, like microfiber mops attracting dust, like tampons –
“Fine.” Tony shrugs, feigning casual disinterest. “Keep an eye on Gerald. He’s teething. There’s chew toys and frozen carrots in the freezer for his gums. Don’t let him destroy any of the furniture. I’ve fed him already this morning, so don’t give him any snacks no matter how much he begs.”
The sun beats down on them. The silence gets heavier and more awkward the longer it stretches on. Tony’s skin itches as a mosquito perches itself greedily on his arm. He swats the insect automatically, leaving a bloody smear behind. The lower branches of a nearby pine tree quiver as a tiny grey bird with a bright red beak alights on it, pecking hopefully at the needle-shaped leaves. A finch, Tony thinks they’re called. His foot feels soggy from puppy slobber. His palms are clammy. He hears Gerald bark from inside, scratching against the front door.
“Sorry.” Tony drops the sing-song voice. “Poor timing. But the point is, every time you two break up and date other people, you always end up crashing right back into each other’s lives. It’s always messy and dramatic and painful for your other girlfriends and her other boyfriends, but it always happens. You’re each other’s endgame.”
, Tony. I’m still here. You haven’t lost me. I came back. I’ll always come back to you.” He presses a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “There’s nothing you can do that will make me give up on you.”
They dedicate a keen effort to sorting through their issues, making fairly good headway until the next volatile argument explodes between them. There’s just as much shouting as the first time.
“Did you fall in the lake?” Tony asks in concern. “I didn’t think Gerald could swim.”
He can’t leave fast enough.
“Do we, Rhodey?”
They clasp arms, gripping tightly. Neither men have ever been big on physical contact, but this time, instead of pulling away after the handshake, Tony stumbles forward as if shoved, and Rhodey catches him, just like he did when he first met Tony, all of fifteen-years-old, puking his guts out in the bathroom of their shared dorm; just like when he caught Tony in the deserts of Afghanistan; just like he has always caught Tony.
“Your happiness is appreciated,” Tony says graciously. “But unnecessary. I’m not dating Pepper or Rhodey. And as far as I can deduce, neither of them are interested in dating each other.”
Steve looks wary. “Why?”
There’s at least one aspect of his punishment that suits him just fine.
“It sometimes surprises me too.” Steve tilts Tony’s chin up, fingers swiping the moisture on his cheeks. “I want this, Tony. After all these years, all our history, I don’t think I could bear to leave it like this between us. I want to try, at least. Don’t you?”
Rhodey makes his opinion on that known by a chary and suspicious silence.
“Like Barnes and Wilson are mine?” Tony counters. Steve huffs, but doesn’t refute it. “They’re my friends. My
“Have you tried turning it off and on again?” Tony asks earnestly.

Fuck.

? Or was it just convenient for you to let me go about my business in ignorance? How did that work out for you? You didn’t trust me and I stopped trusting you and now look where we both ended up! We tore the superhero community apart because you couldn’t find the fucking time to tell me what the hell you were planning!”
The tiny black Labrador-Husky puppy (Tony
Unfortunately, Rhodey is too well-versed in Tony's bullshit to fall for that. “
Tony ducks out of the repair shop during his lunch break and phones Rhodey, who picks up at the fifth ring.
“We’re not done talking about this,” Rhodey says darkly.
The bathroom door opens and Pepper steps out in a set of vividly pink pajamas – almost fuchsia really – that clashes magnificently with her flaming red curls. The sleepwear is obviously too big for her – the collar slipping down to expose the sharp angles of her collarbones and a bare freckled shoulder, the waistband slipping dangerously low, hanging precariously on her hips. Tony feels his breath catch, because the jammies that are too big on Pepper would be just the right size on, let’s say, a stocky and muscular former boxing champion with a clandestine predilection for unironically pink men’s PJs.
Oops.
Maria gives him a menacing look. “You didn’t get it from us.”
“Aw.” Pepper coos over the puppy, who soaks up the attention. “Taking to you always makes me feel so valued and appreciated, Tony.”
The residents of the nearest town – Conception Bay South – don’t seem to recognize or give much thought to the melancholic blond clean-shaven man who stays a week at their fanciest hotel (thank God for small mercies, room service, and a steady hot water supply).
Tony dithers and dallies until he starts to feel farcical.
With visible effort and undisguised reluctance, Steve removes his mouth from Tony’s neck and pulls his hand out of Tony’s pants. Tony almost whines at the loss. Steve still keeps Tony’s wrists in his grip though, probably to stop Tony from legging it. The thought does occur to Tony briefly. It’s possible he didn’t quite think this through.
The first snowmelt is greeted by raucous celebratory howling from Gerald. The air is still crisp and raw, but it stops being unbearably nippy to venture outdoors without being covered head-to-toe in so many thick layers that Tony finds himself making like a penguin and waddling. Hardy wild shrubs and undergrowth poke their vivid green heads out of the winter-hardened earth. Flowers bloom and leaves bud. Soon, the air is perfumed with the aroma of flowers.
“I can’t-” Steve murmurs into his skin.
Tony ducks his head. “What do you want from me, Steve?”
“I’m sorry,” Tony blurts out, without quite meaning to.
Sharon convulses, gasping, her eyes full of horror as they snap open. She’s alone. Her bedroom is humid, suffocating, the dark blue curtains drawn over the brightening daylight. Her pajamas stick unpleasantly to her sticky skin. The bedding is tangled tightly around her hips. Her hand drifts down to her abdomen, tracing the contours of her scar. The skin is unbroken, but the nightmare has left her with a phantom pain centered around her old injury.
They’re
“Yes.”
Tony locks Gerald back inside, turns around and immediately comes face to face with none other than Steve Goddamn Rogers.
Tony… should have seen that coming.
There’s a single loud juddering noise, like Rhodey has dropped the mobile, followed by an inarticulate tirade of invectives. Tony leans with his back against the brick wall, looking out of the mouth of the narrow alley, head turned unseeingly toward the grey-bricked shopfront with the red-and-white striped awning. The bakery sits on the other side of the road, popular with the locals for its rich, buttery Viennoisseries. Tony mostly ventures the store for its coffee and Jamelia Rodriguez, the pretty dark-skinned cashier.
Steve holds himself very, very still. Tony’s chest rises and falls with agitation.
On his right, James Rhodes: brave and relentless and stubborn. In front of him, Pepper Potts: brilliant and vicious and compassionate. There’s an empty space on his left where a third person should be standing – his absence felt keenly every day. Happy Hogan: steadfast and fearless and honest. All three of them more loyal to Tony than he deserves, more loyal than is wise.
how close they were to approving Project Wideawake, how much danger we were really in. What do you think would have happened if we’d all rebelled against the Act? Without anyone to moderate them, how long do you think we’d all last before they’d track us down and chip us like dogs? You saw the proposal. You know what they were planning. The dissections and experiments and obedience collars. There was nothing good about the SHRA,” Tony clarifies. “I’m not so deluded as to believe otherwise, Extremis or not. Registration might have been avowedly to guarantee the country’s security, but with people like Pat Mullet and Paul Grant and James Pertierra on the subcommittee and pulling strings, you really think I’d be fooled into thinking it was anything about anything other than leashing us? But it was a lesser evil between two hellish options, and I made the only choice I could. I’m not saying any of what I did was right, because I’m not. But not a lot of people know how much worse it could have been.”
Rhodey sounds phenomenally unimpressed. “You’ve never obeyed anyone in your entire life, and you avoid safety like it’s the Black Plague.”
“Rebuilding his old family cabin,” Mr. Dickens would say if prodded further. “Came in here to buy lumber and concrete, some tools and paint. Then he drove off with the whole lot in the back of one of Lewis Combs’s rental trucks. Look, that’s all I know. You wanna know more, you ask Lewis.”
It probably says a lot about their relationship that Tony has Pepper’s preferred fragrance memorized by heart.
“You didn’t,” Steve says.
“Futurist,” Tony reminds him, the timbre of his voice sub-fusc. “I’ve always known I was going to lose you – to death or to your morals… my lack of them.”
They lapse into quietude. A drop of rain lands on Tony’s cheek. He cranes his neck back, looking up with a jaundiced eye at the puffy clouds, a mite greyer than he thinks they were a second before.
“Steve Rogers just showed up at my front door,” Tony says. No point in beating around the bush.
“I’m going to leave you at a shelter and replace you with a less troublesome model,” Tony says to Gerald, who barks joyously, eyes fixed on the slimy controller in Tony’s hand.
“Doesn’t feel very good, doesn’t it?” Steve asks coolly.
Steve’s lips are soft but peeling. He hasn’t been drinking enough water. Tony keeps his mouth closed. The kiss is almost chaste, really. For some reason, he thought it would feel… different.
“Are you fucking kidding me?”
And it’s during one summer day, a year on the dot from when he last step foot on American soil, that he steps out of his cabin, a denim jacket slung over his shoulder. Gerald is gnawing on Tony’s white trainers, and yips happily when he tries to tug it out of the puppy’s mouth. The puppy seems to think it’s all a fun game. Tony wrestles for his footwear, propping open the front door with a shoulder while simultaneously blocking Gerald’s many bids for freedom. It’s not Gerald getting lost in the forest that’s the problem. The difficulty arises when the puppy chases after his motorbike and tries to follow him all the way to work.
Pepper gives a valiant attempt at pulling herself together. “Will that be all, Mr. Stark?”
The rough twine is tied in a basic square knot, courtesy of Steve Rogers’ boy-scout days. Tony’s hands don’t shake or fumble. Clint’s handwriting on the topmost envelope draws his eyes like a giant flashing neon sign. Below that there’s the unique texture of parchment and Thor’s large looping calligraphy, written with strong-smelling ink and using what seems to be an old-fashioned quill tip. Peter’s narrow and slanted penmanship beneath that.
Stark men are made of iron.
So, he gets a job as a blue-collar mechanic working for minimum wage, at one of those run-of-the-mills general repair shops that no one who knew Tony Stark before would ever think he’d be caught dead at.
He can make an educated guess.
Not his reputation though. That has long been fed into a paper shredder machine and the tattered remains flushed down the drain. The smear on his formerly good name – Tony takes full responsibility for.
Tony’s blue eyes sting. “It might already be too late,” he says. “There are some actions we can’t take back, that we won’t
“No!” Steve turns completely red. It’s delightful to watch. “No, that’s not necessary. It… it just took me by surprise…. a lot of surprise.”
Tony doesn’t know why.
Now, Tony presses his shoulder against Rhodey’s reassuringly and sneaks a sideways glance. At the small amount of contact, Rhodey’s face changes from homicidal plotting to vaguely constipated. Tony chalks it up as a win.
Throat tight, Tony tries to quip. “Who am I to turn down the request of a respected member of the United States military?”
Steve looks around at the wooden walls, painted an insipid baby-blue; at the inharmonious IKEA furniture: glass tables, carved rosewood chairs, leather couches. The collection is completed by the fancy white lounge chair Steve is still sitting in, appearing completely at odds with the rest of the room’s décor. There are framed pictures hanging on the walls: Pepper and Rhodey and Happy, with a marked absence of any member of the Avengers or Tony himself.
Winter arrives in a flurry of snowflakes and a bitterly cold chill. Freshly fallen snow blankets every surface; freezing over the woodland earth; making Tony’s cabin look like a recently frosted gingerbread house or something that should be inside a snow-globe. The snow lades down the boughs of the varied evergreen trees – the overall effect is something that looks like it ought to belong on a postcard.
The puppy gives him big soulful blue eyes full of betrayal, like he’s saying
, Tony doesn’t say.
Still, it beats being a drunk homeless person. Tony has been there, donated the T-shirt to Goodwill. Zero stars. Would not recommend.
“It was-” A lump rises in Tony’s throat. His eyes burn. “It was about trust.” His voice wobbles. “About being vulnerable and open with the people that I trusted. It was about connection and safety and intimacy. It was never about being in love with someone.”
Summer shifts incrementally to autumn. The leaves turn shades of reds and oranges and golds, shedding from their branches and carpeting the forest floor in a canopy encompassing all the colors of the sunset. Tony rakes up piles of them as tall as his hip solely for the purpose of watching his puppy frolic through them with gleeful abandon. He discovers a love of all things blueberry and bakeapples, and stocks up on jars and jars of jam to last him throughout the winter.
“I won’t come back,” Tony says simply. “I don’t want to. And honestly, I think you’re all probably better off without me.” Steve says nothing, complexion wan. “Why did you come here, Steve?” Tony asks gently.
“You picked Sharon over Maria?” Tony whistles lowly. “I bet Hill wasn’t very happy about that.”
He dislodges the furry black limpet on his shoes, turns right back around and opens the door.
He keeps tabs on the Avengers whenever he feels extraordinarily self-loathing or masochistic. James Barnes is still Captain America. There are several Avengers teams: New and Mighty and Young. None of them are headquartered in his old Tower. Tony expects to feel sad about that, but mostly he’s relieved. When he brings up the topic during his next phone call to Rhodey, Rhodey tells him his tentative plans to renovate the skyscraper as a science center, which Tony greets with exuberant encouragement. Then Rhodey tells him cautiously about the unofficial rumors of Commander Steve Rogers aiming to retire from the public eye and hand over SHIELD operations to Sharon Carter and Nick Fury. Tony stays silent. Rhodey takes the hint and changes the subject.
The rest of the fight after that is a livid red haze. Tony thinks he might have thrown his Char Kway Teow at Steve. Steve holds fast to his moral high ground and doesn’t throw anything back.
Inside, the television has stopped on a news channel. Tony is hyperaware of the open window just a few feet in front of him, and the possibility that Steve can hear their every word with his serum enhanced super-hearing.
The puppy licks Tony’s fingers.
“You’ve been through the mill, haven’t you?” Tony says quietly, as the puppy whines and buts his head against Tony’s knee. “No one wants you either?”
“I’m running late for work,” He says to Steve Rogers, thoughtfully standing right where Tony left him outside.
go wrong!”
to leave.
“Then you’d best take my word for it,” Nick says. Inside, Steve changes the channel from a screechy horror movie to what sounds like a nature documentary. “When I said we needed the best on this, I was talking about you too, you know.”
“Ugh. Platypus. Sourpatch. You know I’m allergic to emotional disclosures. They give me hives, rashes that itch, nasal congestions, a pain in my-”
Steve leaves after that, his face wet with what Tony initially thinks is sweat but eventually realizes are tears.
“That’s not what I-” Steve breaks off, pinching the bridge of his nose, looking like he’s nursing a headache. “This is getting is us nowhere.”
“I do.” Steve’s frosty tone is at direct odds to the way the arm around Tony’s waist pulls him closer, fingers digging into Tony’s hip convulsively, hard enough to leave bruises even through his clothing. “I want to bend you over this chair and make you take my cock. I want to drag you into my bedroom and fuck you through the mattress. I want to have you against the wall until you can’t walk without limping.”
Is it because of some twisted sense of debt? Does Steve think this is what Tony would have done for him? Well, if so, the Commander’s going to be majorly disappointed. Tony would have stepped in to stop Steve from receiving the death penalty, but everything else – including life imprisonment – would have been fair-game.
progressed to the acceptance stage of grief.
Then it’s just Tony and Steve and Gerald, rattling around in the cabin, without Pepper and Rhodey around to act as buffers.
Pepper’s fingers leave his hair, skimming down the side of his face, the shell of his ears, his forehead and brows. Tony’s hands fall to Pepper’s hips, wandering up to rest against the soft bare skin of her stomach and waist. Pepper kisses the corners of his eyes, where he knows lines are deepening into the beginnings of crow’s feet. Her fingertips skim over the bridge of his nose, his cheekbones, one fingernail catching on his lower lip.
Steve sets Gerald down, where the puppy parks its little butt on the floor and looks between them with great interest in its blue doggy eyes, still working on his stick of carrot. Steve gets to his feet, all six feet two of him, the military grace and tightly-controlled strength of his movements like a magnet to Tony’s eyes. Tony grabs the other man by the arm, pushes him away from the stylish white lounge chair, then takes his place. Tony feels his body sink down into the upholstery, the elastic memory foam contouring around him, and lets out a hazy groan of pleasure. Gerald climbs onto Tony’s lap, gross half-chewed carrot still in his mouth, nosing Tony’s hand until he starts stroking the puppy’s head.
He drums his fingers against his thigh.
In just four words, Steve kills Tony’s erection entirely. Tony was at least hoping that they’d go a few days before he’d have to address this. But no such luck. Trust Steve Rogers to ruin all of his plans.
“There’s nothing wrong with being young at heart.”
Fury is right. Tony can guess.
Now, Pepper doesn’t cry, because she’s all cried out. Her tear ducts have been wrung out and squeezed and twisted for every last drop. She’s moved on to the last stage of grief: Acceptance. Except that Tony isn’t dying, except he sort of is, but not really, maybe kind of in a different way –
He must lose track of time, because he blinks and Pepper is standing right in front of him, barely an inch of space between them. He reaches out, touches the hem of the pink sleepshirt, pinching the thin cotton fabric between his fingers.
Tony wants to drop to his knees and weep in gratitude. Rhodey understands. Rhodey has always understood, even during the times when Pepper and Happy have struggled to. Rhodey knows that Tony needs time, alone, to come to terms with everything. Now that Tony’s entire sense of self, of identity, has been stripped away (he is not the Golden Avenger anymore, not Shellhead, not businessman or philanthropist or billionaire). He needs to reinvent himself, tear down the walls of his persona and erect a new building from the foundations of old.
No, it’s because Tony Stark hates being idle.
“I should have let him drown,” Rhodey snarls, incensed. “You two deserve each other. All cute on the outside, completely depraved on the inside.”
“After all this time,” Tony says with something like awe, “you can still surprise me with your capacity for forgiveness.”
Three: Pepper will always support him.
But this is where things remain the same:
“What did he say?”
Not because he needs to. Pepper’s monthly deposit into his account (Tony has told her to stop, but she still does it) is enough for him to live comfortably in his little patch of deserted woodland without working a day for the rest of his life.
Tony can’t meet his eyes. He abruptly develops an unaccountable fascination with the swing-seat, moving his fingers along the hardened and dried bumps that formed from the unevenly applied coating of baby-blue paint. A chip of blue flakes off and lodges underneath his nail.
“Yeah,” Tony chokes out. He’s sure he looks a sight, sniveling all over the place, but Steve doesn’t seem to care. Tony manages a watery smile. “I want it too.”
Tony doesn’t look at him. He’s staring at a vague point somewhere in the distance, blue eyes dull and hollow, his mind miles and miles away. “We had so many close calls before that,” he says. “So many. Pepper had a miscarriage because she was tortured by one of my enemies. The baby – the baby could have been mine. Then Rhodey – God, Rhodey. He was injured so badly he was in literal pieces.
(“What do I pay you for?” Tony complains to her. He feels pride that even in bumfuck Newfoundland, he still gets full bars. Stark-phones are the
“But you’re not sorry for the SHRA itself,” Steve says succinctly.
“We fought about you.”
He buys a swing! Then he paints it blue too! Just because!
Tony smiles bitterly. “Somehow, I have trouble imagining that.”
be the type to intentionally buy uncomfortable furniture for the sole purpose of making life harder for your visitors,” Steve says in annoyance.
“Never got curious?”
“You just had to make it weird.”
A white Ford F-150 with a slightly dented front bumper comes coasting past. At the wheel, a barely legal teenager with a regrettably pimply throws a peace sign at Tony as the vehicle cruises by.
“I’ll have that carved into your tombstone after Pepper’s done with you. I enjoyed knowing you, Stark.”
Pepper Potts in Happy Hogan’s pajamas makes Tony feel like he’s bleeding and injured and
“What’s going on?” Pepper marches out of the house.
(Jesus, he’s turning soft over
“How many people know I’m here?”
“Don’t do that,” Tony tells Gerald, who rolls onto his back and bares his stomach for Pepper to scratch. “Don’t get all vainglorious with me just because you managed to get some bird to scratch your itch. It’s cheap and indecorous.”
“But that’s my specialty.” Tony’s voice is muffled, his face buried in Rhodey’s shoulder. Rhodey smells of aftershave and clothes detergent. Neither of them mentions the growing wet spot there. “I signed up for Moment-Ruining in MIT – top of the class. Seriously, though. Take care of my fortune, Rhodey. And my beach-houses; my private islands; my many, many penthouses; and my assorted mansions. I would have left you my company as well, but Pepper has that covered, so if you want it, you’ll going to have to take it up with her. Are you taking notes? You should be taking notes. Oh – I’ve left you Avengers Tower as well – maybe it’s Stark Tower now – unless you’re going to give it to Steve to use as a base. And in that case, I will act outwardly supportive and benevolently understanding but feel inwardly betrayed. And my Iron Man armor – those are yours as well.”
“How can you say that?” Steve demands, losing his poise. His knuckles whiten from how hard he’s clenching them. “After all the ways it could have gone wrong? After all the ways it
Rhodey chooses to express himself with a mumbled diatribe about where Tony can shove his Wisenheimer.
On the other hand, Rhodey has
Tony shifts in his seat, jiggling his legs. His butt is falling asleep.
“Does IKEA sell these too?” Steve deadpans.
Tony snaps a picture on his phone and sends it to Pepper and Rhodey.
! How could you put us through this again?”
Moving on.
More or less peacefully.
“That was a very credible and well-founded argument,” Rhodey states mildly.
The cold metal biting into the flesh of her wrists, restraining them above and behind her. Sprawling at an awkward angle – too steep to lie on her back and not slide down until she’s dangling by the arms; the tilt of the machine at such an incline that she has to use her legs to support herself but remains unable to stand up completely. Her stomach aches at the point where she’s driven a dagger into herself, the stiches tugging at her skin. Zola on her right and the Red Skull at her left.
Tony tugs experimentally at his wrists, but Steve’s hold doesn’t give.
“No! Don’t!” Tony laughs, drawing his knees to his chest. Steve grabs his calf. The super-soldier’s long fingers wrapping entirely around Tony’s leg. “I’ll tell Pepper!” Tony tattles shamelessly. “She’ll knock your teeth out with her Lamborghinis.”
Her soft beige-colored duster coat is knotted around the waist of her white summer dress like a wide sash. She’s in a pair of especially sharp-looking and towering pale lavender heels that Tony suspects she chose for the sole purpose of looming an inch over Steve Rogers. Tony dons his best victimized face. Pepper promptly rounds on Steve with an accusatory look.
“It’s that bad?”
friends, he doesn’t presume to see familiar faces amidst the crowd.
The puppy sniffles.
“Yeah. Him too.”
An edge of pity creeps into Tony’s voice. Steve holds himself braced and stiff, ready for a blow.
The light from the bathroom falls on them. Rhodey steps out. Behind Rhodey, Tony can see the steam still fogging up the sink mirror. Rhodey’s clad in only a towel around his waist, reams of peaty brown skin on display. He’s in mid-motion of toweling off his hair, but he ceases when he sees them, Pepper in Tony’s lap, her pink sleepshirt hiked up to expose her breasts. Tony meets Rhodey’s eyes, then, not breaking eye contact, very deliberately starts to grind against Pepper. Pepper lets her sleepshirt fall back down, raking her sharp fingernails up and down Tony’s back, so hard he can feel the bite of it through the material of his jammies.
“Steve.” Tony smiles somewhat patronizingly. “Do you need me to explain to you the newfangled custom of the twenty-first century where people have sex without being in a romantic relationship? I can use little words. Draw you a diagram. Give me five minutes and I’ll whip you up a PowerPoint presentation.”
“So, you’re really black under all this dirt.” The tiny black puppy barks and laps at the soapy water, then whines at the taste. Tony scrubs its back. “Doesn’t it feel good to be clean?” The puppy’s tail wags. “You good-” Tony lifts the puppy up for a look. “-boy. Who’s a good boy?”
“We fought,” Steve says, with an ugly grimace. “Before I left. A lot of nasty things were said from both parties.”
bad at metaphors.
Time passes.
“Worse. Worse than the Registration, even.”
to me!” Steve bellows. “All that time I thought we were rebuilding the New Avengers team. I thought we were getting closer – closer than we’d ever been before.” Underneath the fire of his rage, there’s real hurt and genuine pain, which makes Tony look away, pulse stuttering. “And all that time you had been keeping this secret from me. Did you ever trust me at all?”
Steve is silent for a very long moment. Tony gives him a challenging look, unwilling to be the one to lose their staring contact. In his lap, Gerald seems to feel neglected and whines for attention. Tony scratches the puppy behind the ears, eyes still on Steve. Steve’s blue eyes are dark and shadowed with profound emotion, something troubled and tired. The super soldier serum stops him from getting bags under his eyes, but Steve has the restless, jittery vibe of someone who has endured many sleepless nights. His blond hair has been hand-combed, but still looks a bit mussed from wearing a helmet. His hands rest on his knees. Every bit of him is tense, the cords of muscle in his shoulders and arms standing out tautly.
“Commander Rogers!” Rhodey says, with an expression of unconvincing surprise. “What an unexpected… pleasure.”
Tony’s face is expressionless. His shoulders don’t slump. His spine stays straight. His movements aren’t stiff. Even disgraced and publicly discredited, he will be damned if he lets anyone (the nine justices with their alternatingly accusing glowers and poorly-hidden pity; or the paparazzi swarming like hungry piranhas, scenting blood; the crowd packed into the spectator’s area rambunctiously cheering at his fall from grace) even a glimpse of his weakness.
“I forgot how exhausting you were,” Steve grouches, choosing one of the carved rosewood chairs.
The verdict from SCOTUS (unfortunately nicknamed) isn’t necessarily unforeseen. But it’s still a blow. It’s ending the way of life as Tony knows it. It’s taking away everything he has – his livelihood, the Iron Man armor, his company, his properties, his money, his citizenship, and even his friends… those little that he has left, which he can count on one hand and have three remaining.
Tony closes his eyes. “The Illuminati.”
Stupid of him, really.
“Like the way you and me keep coming back to each other?”
“You do have the tendency to unhealthily fixate on your past, that’s true,” Tony agrees serenely. “I don’t feel any different, being the object of your unhealthy fixation.”
Disquieted by Steve’s harsh tone, Tony’s electric blue eyes jump up to meet his. Steve stares at him, face writ large with lust and desire, but also pain and desperation.
“I’m running late for work,” Tony says again. “Employment. A means of earning income when one is no longer a multi-billionaire and owner of a Fortune 500 international company.”
Tony doesn't trust it.
“Tough.”
“Please stop.”
The people who glimpse him during the battle call it a miracle, call it divine intervention, call it a sign from God. The Sentinel of Liberty, the Living Legend, the American Dream rising from the dead and beating back the alien armada at their doorstep. News crews have the headline circulating globally in minutes: CAPTAIN AMERICA ALIVE!
Steve opens his eyes, looking at Tony with a cryptic emotion that seems fragile and torn and deep.
“I didn’t ask for it,” Tony says again.
In New York, Sharon Carter dreams and memories flit through her mind in sharp little pieces – the panicked screams of the crowd, the shoving and the trampling as they flee to relative safety, a gun with the barrel lit up red, her finger pressing down on the trigger.
Maria Hill and Dum-Dum Dugan speak in hushed tones at the front of the van, separated from Tony, Pepper, and Rhodey by a mesh screen. It’s probably against protocol to leave Tony unguarded, just like they’re probably not supposed to leave Tony uncuffed.
Tony’s blood thaws – smoothie-like sludge instead of solid ice, his heart pumping sluggishly. “All my friends are here,” he hears himself say. “All two of them. An argument can be made for three.”
Tony stares. “Are you feeling okay, Steve?”
hard, I think. And the harder I tried, the more errors I seemed to make, the more people got hurt. And the harder I tried to fix it, the worse it all seemed to get.” Steve takes a deep, shuddering breath, eyes closed. “So, my answer is no.”
“Not mine.”
Perhaps some of his thoughts make their way onto Tony’s face, because Steve’s countenance turns penitent, the edges of his frown suffused with sorrow. “I’m sorry for intruding. I didn’t mean to be rude.”
Two: Rhodey will always catch him.
(Tony can almost imagine Bruce lecturing him about the dangers of tetanus, but thinking of Bruce leads to thoughts of the Hulk and the Illuminati and Tony’s eyes start to itch, so he stops that train of thought hastily.)
“We sentence you to exile.”
Tony is abruptly aware of how stupid he must look with the sunglasses still clamped in his mouth.
Tony tidies up their mess in the kitchen, binning the leftovers and the takeaway carton boxes, appetite thoroughly gone. He feels sick and shaky. Steve’s motorbike is gone from the driveway. That’s probably the last time he’ll ever voluntarily seek out Tony again and their last conversation is a screaming match where Tony accused him of attempted murder.
“Heads will roll,” Tony says drolly.
Tony pulls back the throttle and roars down the road, glad the helmet’s tinted visor conceals his face.
“What?” Steve sounds stupefied.
“I’m not going to yell at you.”
“Here.” Steve hands them over.
happy either. If Tony has to, he would classify their profiles on the varying spectrum of conflicted.
“You’re asking me for romantic advice?
” Rhodey gasps in a choked voice, hauling him in for a bone-breaking hug. “You utter
America doesn’t want Tony Stark.
“If you expected a homecoming party, you should have called ahead,” Tony says.
“I never asked him to stay,” Tony says. “I never asked for it.”
“I miss him too,” Pepper whispers into his dyed blond hair. It’s Pepper Potts’ husband that is dead, not Tony’s, and yet it’s Pepper who’s stroking his head like he’s a very young child in need of consoling. It’s Pepper Potts who’s a billion – no, a trillion times stronger than Tony can ever hope to be.
“He wasn’t that happy to see me yesterday,” Steve notes.
Tony backs away until his back presses against the front door, fumbles behind him for the knob, turns it, staggers back over the threshold, and slams the door in Steve Rogers’s aggravatingly handsome and unreadable face.
“When I came out of the ice,” Steve begins huskily. “I had nothing. No home. No friends. No family. No community. I didn’t belong anywhere. But I had you.” Tony feels a lump rising in his throat. “You gave me a home. You gave me the Avengers. You… you made me feel like I could belong.” Steve’s voice turns raspy, his eyes are red. “You were the best and worst parts of the future, and fighting against you…” He stops for a moment to collect himself. “I wanted to know if there was anything, anything at all that could be salvaged from this, from us.”
“I hate you, Tony.”
He recalls when he was Hogan Potts.
“Why were you shouting?” Pepper demands, in a voice that would make drill sergeants cower.
Both feet now free, Tony picks up the black puppy by the scruff of his neck.
In other words, they’re kind of an eyesore.
Tony finds a moment to pull Steve aside later. “I’m sorry about them.”
But of course, he typically doesn’t get what he wants.
Steve gives him a dirty look. Tony’s innocent charade breaks as he starts to snicker.
“I swear to God-”
Two steps forward. Three steps back.
“Give it another month. I’m sure that’ll change.”
Not that it isn’t nice. Because it is. Very nice. Very… sweet. It feels a bit like kissing Pepper or Rhodey or Happy – warm and safe and slow, but not quite right.
“No, we were
“It’s so nice to know that I can always rely on you,” Tony says sarcastically. “You live with her, Rhodey. It’s illogical for me to call twice when you can just wait for Pepper to get off work and tell her then. Besides, I’m tactless. Gauche. Without tact. There’s a very definite statistical history proving that Pepper takes bad news even worse when it’s coming from
“The serum will grow them back,” Steve says, but he releases Tony’s leg. The silence between them this time is more congenial and tranquil.
him because some rich nut hired them to.
“I’m surprised by you as well, Steve,” Tony says playfully. “I mean, everyone knows about you and Sharon. But I always thought… Well. Sam’s objectively a very handsome man, even if his personality could use a bit of work. And all those years fighting the war with James Barnes, old timey soldiers Not-Asking and Not-Telling all over the place.”
But there’s one part that Tony recollects with crystal clarity.
The puppy barks joyously and runs circles around Tony’s ankles, wanting to play. Tony buries his head in his hands, accidentally poking himself in the eye with the frames of his sunglasses. Dismayed and injured, he gives serious thought to hiding indoors until Steve takes the hint and goes away. Gerald blasely goes back to gnawing on Tony’s white trainers, planting his furry behind on Tony’s feet to stop him escaping, the puppy’s furry tail tickling his skin.
"You would have died a horrible death years ago," Pepper deadpans.
“Comfy?” Tony asks guilelessly.
“What can I do for you, Commander Rogers?” Tony asks, and the tension in the room ricochets.
He’s running late for work.
“You started it first.”
Given the fact that the second to last time Tony has seen Steve before his death was when they were beating the snot out of each other in the middle of New York city, buildings collapsing and vehicles going up in flames all around them, the 180 degree U-turn Steve’s attitude has taken is downright alarming and had Tony questioning whether anyone has checked him for signs of mind-control or Skrull impersonation.
In the end, they never found out whether Rhodey’s qualms were ever true. Tony’s mind-scan came back inconclusive. Tony was uncertain – he’s
“I wouldn’t,” Steve agrees. “But you didn’t try very hard, did you? You never
“Then your girlfriend slapped me.”
Tony has seen a TV show once, a stupid competition where two teams competed to pump as much air as possible into a balloon without popping it, and the team who managed to make the biggest balloons wins. Rhodey reminds Tony of that one balloon, one more ill-advised pump away from going bang.
Tony gets rid of all the moss and lichens first – seriously, what is with all these plants? – and then walks around smelling of vinegar for days. Mindful of the diminished funds in his new bank account (and it’s a wholly novel concept, having to watch how much he spends; Rhodey tells him it’s character-building, Tony hangs up on him) he salvages what he can (which isn’t much) and rebuilds what he can’t.
Tony has a lot of labyrinthine feelings about Steve Rogers, none of which he feels at all feels emotionally ready to deal with now.
Camera flashes blind his eyes as the press starts firing questions at him. But he can’t hear whatever it is they’re bellowing through the dull roaring in his ears, only see their mouths working mutely, their microphones being thrust forward aggressively.
Tony squishes himself between Steve and the armrest, ending up half-sprawled on Steve’s lap, his head resting on Steve’s chest. He can feel Steve’s heart hammering against his skin. Steve seems to have stopped breathing. He’s a solid block of heat wrapped around Tony’s side and back.
“Not even a
“Because I don’t know what would happen next.”
(Tony can’t even… he just can’t…
“I think I’m going to call you Gerald.” Tony chuckles wetly. “You know, when Rhodey told me he thought I should get a support animal, I don’t think this is what he meant.”
“You fought for what you thought was right,” Tony says, when it becomes obvious that Steve intends to wait him out. “And the public crucified you for it. I… I was supposed to be your friend, and I led the charge. I hunted you and persecuted you and betrayed you because of it.”
it’s black, it could just be all the dirt stuck to its fur) whines pathetically. It lowers its face onto its paws, tail tucked between its legs and left ear flattened, giving him big soulful blue eyes.
“I’m glad to hear that my troubling love life is so amusing to you.”
Tony raises a hand and touches his face, his hair, before he can stop himself. After a year, being cleanshaven and his hair a perpetual store-bought blond doesn’t seem outré anymore. He’s acclimatized to his drastically different reflection, though he still mourns his punctiliously trimmed goatee.
“They’re not,” Tony says, giving Rhodey and Pepper stern looks. “They’re visiting. I’m sure Pepper and Rhodey have other businesses to conduct at a place far, far away from here. Don’t you, Pepper? Rhodey?”
Tony is squeezing his eyes shut tightly enough that the backs of his eyelids turn blood-red. He tastes blood in his mouth and realizes he’s biting down on his tongue hard enough to break skin, trying to keep silent.
“You’re a lot more trouble than you’re worth,” Tony says through the sunglasses clamped between his teeth. “I should dump you at a shelter to be some other bleeding heart’s problem.”
“You didn’t believe me, told me it would never happen, that the American public would never stand for it. But you know better now, don’t you?”
“Maybe. Maybe not. All I know is that I ain’t never seen the likes of what’s happening now before. I know we need the best on this. And with Reed Richards, Charles Xavier, Stephen Strange, Black Bolt, and Namor all gone rogue, pickings are slim.”
Steve Rogers is resurrected a week before the Skrull Invasion.
“I didn’t say much either,” Tony prevaricates.
The azure of Steve’s eyes are nearly swallowed up by his dilated pupils. But apart from that, he looks almost unfairly put together, whereas Tony is sure he looks like a debauched mess.
“Did you really think I had something to do with it?”
him to do it.
“I know you didn’t,” Tony says in a forbearing manner.
second-in-command – gave the order to have me shot and arrested! You trusted Reed Richards and Hank Pym. Why not me?”
He’s standing on a coastal shore, watching a meteor roll across the skies and plummet into the ocean, feeling the shockwave reverberate through the earth and salt water, up the soles of his feet, shaking the bones in his body until he falls apart like a poorly constructed straw scarecrow. He’s watching the tide recede meteorically (Ha!
“No use crying over the leaking coolant system, platypus,” Tony says with forced levity. “What I’m more worried about is if Steve can find me, so can anyone else.”
“Worse. I’ve been a lot of fucked-up, no-win, doomsday-esque situations – fought my way out of more of them than I can count – and I’m telling you now, this could be it. This is the worst one yet.”
Steve’s arm loosens around his waist. Tony makes a bid for freedom. Both men lose their balance and topple over, tumbling in a heap onto the blue-carpeted floor with a muffled
Tony smirks weakly. “I told you I’d grow on you, didn’t I?”
. But he wouldn’t have given up his entire life’s work to achieve it.
“What about me?”
“It’s like you think I can’t survive by myself.”
He’s a glass bottle full of Coke and Mentos with the cap screwed on too tightly to pop off. He’s been undergoing nucleation, the pressure building up higher and higher until the first crack appears in the glass surface followed by the explosion: messy and sharp and dangerous.
“Welcome to Canada,” Dugan says.
Tony Stark has never claimed to be a good man.
. That’s how it works.”
No one on the entire planet will ever forget what they were doing when Captain America, strong and righteous and good, epitome of honor and personification of justice, strikes down the mastermind behind the Secret Invasion.
Tony watches with a laudably straight face, as Steve fidgets in his seat, back ramrod straight, shifting minutely as the hard, unyielding wood pokes him in places that should never be poked, cutting off the blood flow to several critical extremities. Steve looks at the leather couches, which Tony knows are stifling in the summer heat and has the consistency of marshmallow, so one would sink right into it and be subsequently suffocated by the warm leather.
There’s a Harley-Davidson Street 750 parked in Tony’s gravelly front yard, sleek black and gleaming chrome, leaning dangerously close to his potato plants, green leafy shoots just beginning to peek out of the brown tilled soil. Tony flattens the capricious urge to tell Steve Rogers to move his bike.
Maria tosses Tony a set of keys and a black helmet.
“I did tell you, Steve.” All at once, the anger that fills Tony drains out of him, leaving him feeling hollow, and he collapses back into his chair. “You wouldn’t listen.”
. He wants
He harvests the vegetables of his labor, insists that they’re perfectly edible.
“Just answer the question,” Steve says curtly.
“No,” Tony says, frowning severely. “No. I refuse. First the bats? Now this? I’m not starting a petting zoo here.”
Tony changes his mind. He doesn’t want out of this van.
The prisoner transport van drives over a speedbump.
The van stops. The engine dies. The backdoors of the van swing open to reveal Maria, looking grim. Behind her, Dugan has his hands on his hips and is studying his toes intently. Over their shoulders, Tony sees an endless backdrop trees and little else.
Rhodey scoffs. “Hah! I’m not that self-destructive. Or that masochistic.”
“Nothing… just talking to myself.”
“You can’t.”
Perhaps it’s a good thing though, having so much that needs to be done.
Rhodey thumps him hard on the back. “Shut up. You’re ruining the moment.”
“Not Commander Rogers,” Steve elucidates. He’s watching Tony’s reaction very closely, waiting for… something. “As of today, SHIELD answers to Director Nick Fury and Deputy Director Sharon Carter.”
They both say some hateful, virulent things they don’t mean in the heat of the moment, and there are floods of manly tears from both sides. Nevertheless, slowly but surely, they get better at talking to each other instead of
Tony finds Steve in the living room, sitting in the white Wing Lounge Chair. Gerald is curled up in his lap and happily being patted.
Tony’s lips tingle, feeling swollen and bruised. Steve mouths down the long elegant column of Tony’s neck in a warm, slick trail, sucking at Tony’s pulse-point and making him shudder. Tony’s cock jumps.
Tony clambers out of the van with legs that threaten to give out under him, a little bit because of nerves, but mostly due to the blood rushing back into his numb extremities. Dugan has parked the van by the side of narrow dirt road bracketed on either side by woodland, a few feet away from a nondescript motorcycle.
What’s wrong with them, you ask?
Through the large windows of the bakery, Tony catches Jamelia’s eye. The dark-skinned woman has her long shining black hair in a ponytail and wears a shapeless bakery apron that would look ugly and unflattering on just about anyone else. Jamelia’s sensuous lips curve up into a gleaming white smile. Tony responds with a charming grin of his own, pointing at his phone, then splaying all five fingers:
Howard Stark had been a shitty father – emotionally negligent at best and just down right abusive at worst – but he’d at least taught Tony a few things right.
“You should want nothing to do with me. You should run as far away from me as possible.”
“I think this is enough hugging, don’t you?”
Rhodey’s face peers at them from Tony’s laptop screen, looking supremely unimpressed, and claims that his potatoes look like deformed fetuses.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
Tony very intentionally does not look at Steve’s face. “If you want to talk,” he says to Steve’s left earlobe, tone measured and tightly constrained. “It’ll have to wait until some other day.”
Pepper sniffs. Her long red hair is in curls today, and she shoulders unabashedly past him and into the house, pulling her suitcase behind her. “I don’t think anyone who needs me to remember their own social security number is technically ‘self-supporting’.”
On Day Three, Tony picks up a stray.
“You hear something, Hill?” Dugan asks jauntily.
Except it’s not their last conversation, because Steve comes back. Miserable, red-eyed, with dried blood caked over his knuckles where the serum has already knitted his skin back together – he looks like a hot mess, but he still comes back.
One word. Two syllables. It rings through Tony Stark’s ears, drilling deep into his skull, rattling his teeth. He can feel his heart hammering in his throat and ears, as if he’s just done a marathon. His expression remains blank and unreadable. His hands don’t shake as he folds them in his lap, smoothing over the crisp lines of his Tom Ford suit.
“Have you told Pepper yet?” Rhodey asks.
Pepper Potts sits on his right, dressed in her business best: purple blouse and professional black skirt. That professionalism is nowhere to be seen as she lays her head on Tony’s shoulder, long red hair spilling freely and smelling of her favorite perfume – Coco Mademoiselle Eau de Parfum.
