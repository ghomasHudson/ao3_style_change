Sherlock worked the plug in and out, lapping the lube that came with it from John’s skin and replacing it with his saliva. He spun the plug and moved it so it ground down on John’s prostate.
John agreed. First Christmas together. Although he was surprised that Angelo knew they were together. Perhaps Sherlock had stopped by or one of his network had said something.
“I’ve been dying to ask - you’re so devoted, being a widower for so long and still wearing your ring…”
After he tried on, accepted and paid for his uniform he went back to his flat. He had wanted to go to Harry’s and tell her he’d been matched in person but after all that he wasn’t in the mood.
He looked up, breathing through his nose, and saw John looking down with wide eyes and an open mouth.
Sherlock felt John’s warm breath over his hole. It lapped at it before circling again. Sherlock realized he was groaning and drooling into the pillow.
was added to the list of John’s qualities and Sherlock felt his chest tighten. He ignored it and focused on John.
Sherlock said, his command modulated once more. He helped guide John without moving from his knees. The sensation of the scarf dragging along John’s skin with every movement registered once more. John realized Sherlock had just given him a blow job while restrained and it made his cock twitch, a spasm that only brought a drop of fluid out.
“I’m fine,” he said flatly. Once it looked like John wasn’t going to have a panic attack he said, “I quite enjoyed myself. I just need to call my brother. I lied to James when I said I contacted him.”
He knew they couldn't be a human person, regardless of what they looked like. They'd survived for over five minutes on Mars's surface without a suit. It was still daylight out but the temperature had to be near freezing. Their breath had come out in frosty puffs when they spoke to him.
He needed to say something honest, to show John his trust in him. And hopefully, earn his trust in return.
“Four, five, six!” Sherlock bucked with the blows as John laid three down on one spot on his other cheek. The butt plug was jamming into his prostate instead of smoothly dragging across it. Sherlock could already feel a puddle beneath his hips.
. How odd. Sherloc wondered if the labels told other Terrans their jobs. Watson had been written on the rover and their Terran's suit. Perhaps he was a mechanic of some sort?
He pushed John face first onto the bed before climbing on himself. John rose to his knees and Sherlock went back to licking around the plug. He could taste John’s skin along with the lube. It made him salivate. He licked the saliva and lube mixture up from John’s perineum, dragging his tongue up and lapping around John’s hole.
Sherlock scrambled to his knees before John could finish his sentence, only slightly hampered by the bar. He flinched when a cold dollop hit his hole. John teased, circling endlessly before finally pushing in with only the tip of his finger. He held it there, moving back when Sherlock tried to push back and be properly breached.
“Please, John, turn it up! Please give it to me. I can take it! I can,” Sherlock seemed to be trying to convince himself.
It was a simple thing, really. He wanted to show John he treasured him, loved him, thought about him, hated being apart from him.
John dithered a bit, appreciating Sherlock’s normality but still afraid of himself, before turning off the light and settling next to Sherlock. If he left now, Sherlock would be distressed. John wasn’t going to lash out physically and then hurt him emotionally.
John took a sip of his drink. He didn’t intend to break Sherlock’s heart. He planned on being with him for the rest of his life, actually. He never wanted to be anywhere but Sherlock’s side. He was happiest when he was with Sherlock.
Both of Sherlock’s eyes opened and focused on his flatmate. John was in a bit of pain but still refusing to look at Sherlock. Sherlock turned his attention to the men on the screen.
John yawned as he browsed the paper. John was pretty sure there was nothing in there that Sherlock would consider of interest. Just political scandals and tabloid gossip. He was just considering getting his laptop from where it was charging so he could see if there was something on his blog when Sherlock strolled in.
John felt his chest freeze. Sherlock wasn’t wrong. He thought about it, once, but dismissed it as something to do later. It wasn’t like he was going to be looking for romantic companionship after that whole mess, and any one night stands always used condoms.
John was relieved, he let go of the breath he was holding. “Ok, that’s ok, pet. Just keep moving the sound.”
“Good boy, you’re such a good boy, Sherlock. You want the belt now or do you need a break?” John asked as he rolled his shoulder.
“Sorry, she’s sick. Come in.” John tried to blink himself awake. He didn’t know what Mycroft was doing here. Sure, Sherlock had been gone for two years, but that was par for the course. On the nights that John couldn’t sleep he reminded himself that Sherlock would be back when it suited him and no sooner. No amount of fretting would change anything.
I'm amazed by the response to this story. A big thank you to everyone who commented, kudoed and bookmarked. You are all really motivating me.
Sherlock came so hard he saw stars. He grunted as he worked himself through it. The relief was palatable, he could
Sherlock pulled on John's suit and John nearly fell. While he was stumbling, he saw O'Murtagh swing a giant pipe at Sherlock. "No! Don't hurt him!" John shouted once he'd found his footing.
Then they’d exchanged rings. His sub had been shot and had slight nerve damage to his left hand, his dominant hand. But the tremors weren’t just from that. And the cane wasn’t always in use the way it should be if his leg were actually injured.
"No, you say that, but everyone will remember you." O'Murtagh wriggled free of John's grip and held onto the latch. "I'll make you a deal, Watson. In exchange for me not opening the airlock, you'll let me dissect that
“Yeah? Me too. Clara wants me brought up on charges, says I’ve been emotionally abusing her. Have you ever heard such a crock of shit?”
“I can get other rings, or I can send these and get them sized,” Sherlock rambled, terrified that he’d messed something up.
It was madness. Sherlock was better than this. He reminded himself that he didn’t want a sub, he had no interest in sex and the only thing that mattered was the work.
He thought it was better to start out not like he was attempting to get John riled up and (hopefully) fired.
John felt his hand tighten and loosen. He did it a couple more times, trying to erase the memory of Sherlock’s hand in his.
“Fuck, Sherlock,” John gasped. He was close. So close. Sherlock had been working on him for some minutes and John was dizzy with arousal.
He started working his tongue against John’s cock and tried to angle his hips to hit John’s prostate. He fucked and sucked with abandon, trying to get John to come.
Sherlock cleared his throat and squared his shoulders. He’d seen porn and people did this every day. Normal, stupid people. It shouldn’t be difficult.
The driver had so much command too much. John found himself following the command. He was horrified with himself. He’d accepted Sherlock as his Dom. This couldn’t be happening!
Sherlock decided to let it go. He probably had rug burn or something. He was in pain and was embarrassed because he was a soldier.
If you like this version of the D/s world and want to write in it link me or put me in an inspired by. I would be honoured. Also, if you are just inspired by a line and write or draw something, even if it seems completely unrelated, I want to see it. Drop me a link in the comments so I can revel in your awesomeness.
Once the sound was pulled free of Sherlock’s cock John had him add more lube and let it fall back in.
The worry that they’d be caught by some passerby excited John. The fact that they might get caught by Lestrade lit up that part of his mind that loved danger.
He moved John so he was kneeling and John felt Sherlock’s shirt front against his back. Then he took some of John’s conditioner and started wanking him. Sherlock’s movements were slow, meticulous. He was in no hurry.
John realized he couldn’t take a shower without rebandaging and disinfecting his legs. He glared at Sherlock who showed no signs of remorse.
I’m thinking about editing this story, adding at the very least a scene where Sherlock milks John in the previous chapter. Having it beta’d and cleaned up. Do you think it’s worth it?
The hot spray rained down on Sherlock’s back. He felt warm, too warm. He wrapped the hand that wasn’t scrabbling over their erections around John’s back and carefully swapped their places. Now his back was against cold tile. He shivered but he now could lean back with legs spread and thrust against John properly. He took John and himself in hand and stroked.
“Yes, Mrs Hudson said the roof is stable enough now for us to put up a beehive or two. And if you tell me what to plant for them I can take care so they don’t swarm away and you don’t have to remember to water them.”
Sherlock was alive, pale, silvery and otherworldly below him. His clear colourless eyes were staring into John’s, reflecting the dim light from the streetlamps outside. He had his long fingers wrapped around John’s wrists, holding him back and keeping him close simultaneously. The corners of his mouth were turned down and his brows were furrowed in worry.
“You should have left it to someone else. You were a rubbish father, John,” Sherlock said as he hugged him back.
John thought. Sherlock would reach over to the bedside table grab the lube and start working him open…
He wanted to stay and get to know John better. He wanted to have more sex with John. He wanted to fall asleep next to him. He wanted to trace every line on his body, map his every freckle. He wanted to know what John did every day. Become part of his routine. He wanted to come back with John when he got his leave. To show John his flat. To…
Sherlock wasn’t particularly fond of video games but this case required it. Sherlock frowned as he downloaded Pokemon Go onto his phone.
Sherlock didn’t need to ask what John meant. John was holding the blanket Sherlock had gotten for his daughter. He had to have found the stash Sherlock had of things for her.
The feather danced over Sherlock’s nipple again and Sherlock jumped. John played with Sherlock’s nipple, ignoring Sherlock’s shaking chocked off sobs. He alternated between soft and hard touches so Sherlock couldn’t grow immune to the contact.
“Please,” Sherlock begged again and John wondered what he was begging for. Mercy? No, it was clear Sherlock was loving this. Attention to his cock? No, the denial was driving him wild.
John suddenly felt awkward. Considering some of the kinky things Sherlock had searched on John’s laptop and left in his browser history it didn’t seem like something Sherlock would be opposed to. But Sherlock was giving John an odd look.
Then he moved the wheel down Sherlock’s cheek, over the side of his jawbone, down his neck, over his collarbone, and up his shoulder. As John scissored the wheel up Sherlock’s arm Sherlock tensed, clearly resisting the urge to squirm. As the pins moved over his veins, making red marks over white scars Sherlock gasped. John realized the discomfort he was causing and he moved the wheel to the side of Sherlock’s arm, making a beeline for his pinkie finger.
John needed something that showed that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Sherlock. That he couldn’t imagine his days without Sherlock in them. That Sherlock was the love of his life.
Four, five and six all rained down the other side of his back. He barely had time to say the numbers before eight and nine hit against his arse. Ten struck a little lower, right over the crease, he’d feel that as he walked for the next few days. Instead of saying the number he groaned in ecstasy.
"Next time, John. I didn't think you'd want strawberry lube up there. Though we'll have to try that sometime too. I quite enjoyed rimming. I'll add it to the list."
“I didn’t want you to think I didn’t get you anything,” John said. “I just didn’t know the proper things to get.”
"Jawn," they said experimentally. They nodded to themselves, yes, Jawn was a good name. They liked it. "Jawn, what's this?" They asked and pointed to a green thing.
John woke early, usually found Sherlock already (or still) awake. They had tea and toast together on the days Mrs Hudson didn’t cook for them and looked at the newspaper. John had found that Sherlock got bored easily so he would point out possible cases. So far, they hadn’t gone on any but John would do it anyway because when Sherlock wasn’t declaring the stories boring he was telling John who the criminal was.
He rose to his knees and put Sherlock’s legs over his shoulder. Then he bent Sherlock in half and started thrusting hard.
Sherlock remembered that his parents wanted to hold a reception in the time between the ceremony and the first counselling session.
Sherlock held on to the praise as John swung the next hit up and across so it hit where Sherlock’s thighs met his arse. Once the pain had receded a bit Sherlock whimpered, “Four.”
“Sherlock,” John said quietly. He was on edge, he didn’t need to be quiet, no one in a car with the windows rolled up could hear him if he spoke normally, but he couldn’t help it.
“She was a lesbian, John. She was interesting and she thought I was some sort of kindred spirit. We were alike, in a way. I felt responsible since I made her hand her phone over to Mycroft so when she was caught by terrorists she’d blackmailed I saved her. Even if I were inclined that way she wouldn’t want more than to tie me to the bedposts and dominate me.”
John pulled on Sherlock’s bicep and Sherlock got the hint. He shifted and wrapped his hand around John’s cock, pulling with the rhythm that James was pounding into him. He wrapped his lips around his teeth and started sucking hard.
His sub had been abandoned. He hadn’t heard a command in quite some time. He was sure the government had counselling for subs that left the military, did they not give commands there? If not it was a grievous oversight. His sub had gone from hearing several commands a day to none at all.
Sherlock could feel John’s tongue poke and prod him but now that he was over the shock of it he wanted more.
He couldn’t do it! He couldn’t hold them back and get to Sherlock. It started raining, washing the blood down the street. God, there was so much blood.
He couldn’t really fit them both in so he lapped at them and rubbed them together, mouthing each of them.
A drop of sweat dripped from Sherlock’s nose onto John’s arse and he prayed John was close. He doubted he was, as John hadn’t tried to reach for his cock again. He tried to change his focus to something else, to recite the periodic table alphabetically backwards so he didn’t come first.
The cab pulled up to the kerb and Sherlock left John to pay. John pulled out his billfold. He knew full well that he didn’t have a pound to his name but he thought he should at least act as he did. He opened the wallet, the lie of forgetting his bank card already on his tongue when Sherlock’s bank card fell out.
Every little grunt and groan made Sherlock thrust harder. He could tell when people were faking enjoyment of sex. It made watching porn difficult. John’s moans weren’t fake. He wasn’t hard but he was enjoying this.
There was a loud hiss in the air and a crack. “Eiiighteen!” Sherlock said in ecstasy as pleasure ripped across his hip. Another crack and more pleasure and Sherlock groaned out, “Nineteen.”
To Sherlock’s horror, John’s face twisted and he followed the command. His whole body was quivering and Sherlock made a strangled desperate sound. He needed to command his sub. He needed to get John out of here. John was his sub, his responsibility, and here he was, following another Dom’s commands.
Sherlock smiled brightly and spun in a circle, pulling John along. Joy filled John as he realized Sherlock wasn’t taking the piss. This was real. Sherlock was in love with him. John needed an outlet for the elation he felt. He threw his head back and laughed as they spun.
Blood dripped onto the ground from Sherlock’s wound. The dark red staining the pristine white floor.
“Two, three,” hit above and below the last one. Sherlock didn’t even feel pleasure from the plug. Only pain as the cane hit him. He whimpered.
John twisted his finger before removing it. Sherlock whimpered at the loss but stopped when the smooth plastic of a toy pressed against his entrance. It was small, not requiring too much prep.
“Oh,” he gasped. John had worn that when he went out. He’d talked to people, rode the bus and the tube with it in.
“Tell them I’ve had an emergency.” He couldn’t very well tell them that emergency was going to be his baby brother storming in demanding that Mycroft stop his marriage ceremony. He’d hold the mail so the envelope wouldn’t be delivered until it was convenient. If only he could always plan his brother’s tantrums.
“Just leave me alone. I can delete it all and you can pretend it never happened and we can go on as normal tomorrow.”
John moved faster. If that was a person, a human, they'd die before he even got there; if not from decompression then from the cold. And if the cold didn't get them the lack of oxygen would. But he had to try.
"Of course," Sherlock said, as if not having a list was crazy. "Eat something. I'd like to have sex tonight too."
There was a loud crack before pain bloomed in a line across Sherlock’s arse. “Ah!” The fog lifted a bit but came back in thicker. “One, thank you, sir.”
Gently pressing his lips to the scar Sherlock thanked every deity he didn’t believe in that John hadn’t died that day.
“She didn’t ask me anything about the bomb.” And that was strange to him. He would have thought, that since he discovered it and was seen running from the scene that they would have had a few questions for him.
He found the living room filled with boxes. His boxes. The boxes from his house with Mary. Also, there were a bunch of contacts from Sherlock’s homeless network milling about.
Mycroft groaned. His American counterpart, Steven, was clearly under stress. "My return didn't go smoothly."
The water was hot. Hotter than he liked it. John had once said he had only cold and lukewarm showers in Afghanistan so he liked baths when he could get them and hot showers when he couldn't.
Probably the last, Sherlock decided. He pulled the comforter off and left it in a pile on the floor. He stretched his body over the sheets and realized he didn’t know how he should pose. Should he be on his back? No, John would want him looking at him, wouldn’t he?
He licked up John’s cock, dragging his pink tongue up the bottom before swirling it around the head. Then he stretched his mouth around John’s cock, looking John in the eye as he bobbed up, down, up, down before hollowing his cheeks and sucking.
Suddenly the feathers were gone and John pressed his lips to Sherlock’s. Sherlock let John invade his mouth, he sucked on John’s tongue, letting John know that he was ready to please him. John took Sherlock’s mouth like a man starved. He bit Sherlock’s lower lip, sucked on Sherlock’s cupid bow, he wrapped his hand around the back of Sherlock’s head and pulled on Sherlock’s curls.
“Oh, God!” Sherlock only had himself to blame. He knew John wouldn’t go easy on him unless he requested it. He could request it at any time, all he had to do was ask or say yellow. He wouldn’t though, he was stubborn and he loved the feeling he got when he accomplished what John set out for him.
John rang off without requesting that Mycroft contact him when he heard from Sherlock. He was angry. The worst part was that he knew that if Sherlock had told him he was going off on a dangerous mission John would have dropped everything and followed, leaving Rosie to whomever would take her. God, he was the worst father. Sherlock had done what Sherlock had always done, making the call without consulting anyone. John wouldn’t thank him; in fact, he might punch him when he came back.
John followed Sherlock into the office. While Sherlock confirmed with their counsellor that they were in the right place John looked around the room. He’d been right to walk behind Sherlock. The coat covered everything and John didn’t have anything to stare at. And since his mind was on Sherlock he wasn’t imagining him either. John’s nerves were so bad and his leg was so painful that John didn’t have the mental energy to spare thinking about what was below the flappy woollen thing.
He knew he was supposed to let the counsellor lead the appointment but when she handed over the folder that had John’s information in it he couldn’t help himself. He descended upon the information like a man starved.
When he did the creature jumped backward and tripped. They fell and scooted backwards. They stayed there for a bit before the curiosity of the creature got the better of it and it stood to look at John's face.
The man on the screen was clearly enjoying the rough treatment. Sherlock hissed as he slid the dildo home.
John was looking at him, staring. His pupils were dilated and Sherlock realized John was waiting for a command. Well, of course, he was! John was a sub. A sub wasn’t going to lead a sexual encounter. At least, a sub that had been abandoned wasn’t.
Of course he wasn’t, the look John had given him had unsettled him. He needed to be lost in sensation in order to come.
John dragged the leather over the plug in Sherlock’s hole and Sherlock rolled his head and moaned. Sherlock stretched out his hands and closed them, kneading the sheets like a cat. When John tapped lightly at Sherlock’s testicles he threw his head back and moaned.
“Two, three,” hit up over his shoulders. “Four,” hit down Sherlock’s spine. The belt burned instead of stung and Sherlock was settling into the sensation.
John wondered why his Dom wasn’t using any command. At the same time, John was grateful he wasn’t. He felt such compulsion to follow Sherlock’s orders as it was that he feared if Sherlock unleashed a true command in that deep voice he’d be brought to his knees.
The case took several irritating days. The clues were scattered and hard to come by. Sherlock said he felt like he was working through fog. John insisted he take the antibiotics anyway and that they didn’t cloud his thinking. Though, the alarm John set because they had to be taken at the same time every day had alerted the criminals to their presence dragging the case out even more.
Bill started biting Sherlock’s shoulder. He reached for Sherlock’s cock but John swatted his hand away. Sherlock cried out an objection but it went unheeded. Bill rolled and they fell off the cot. Sherlock landed hard onto floor, his arms protecting his face. He shouted as his erection was smashed.
John tested his restraints, tight but not too tight, made of silk instead of metal and knots tied so Sherlock could free himself if it became too much.
There was a jangle as John attached Sherlock’s feet to a spreader bar. He’d said that being restained would help. He found it hot when John dominated him. Now, Sherlock was exposed and John spread the bar further. The sensation made Sherlock arch his back. God, it was hot.
Sherlock looked like he’d been cornered. After a second his whole demeanour changed and he was aloof. “I have no specific qualms regarding a sexual relationship. If anything the data will be useful to the work.”
John's face was bright red but his cock got hard quickly. Sherlock saw that it was John’s adrenaline kink. Sitting in the middle of a restaurant, in front of a window, getting a handjob in the middle of dinner.
John was beautiful and Sherlock wanted to unwrap him. He wanted to carefully peel each item of clothing away from John’s body and touch the exposed skin. He wanted to explore each freckle and scar. He wanted to
Well, thinking about this was useless. He didn’t know any Doms willing to lie and he didn’t have the money to pay the fee.
Sherlock lifted his feet and John manhandled them out of the way so he could take his spot on the couch. He lifted the remote and turned on the television. Sherlock rested his feet onto John’s lap and opened one eye to take a peek at what John was watching. It was some drama, boring. Sherlock closed his eye and went into his mind palace.
The Dom who had kidnapped John stuck his head in the room and John froze. What was he doing here? John readied for a fight, lifting his cane. The Dom seemed unimpressed.
There was a hiss in the air and the sound of leather hitting flesh and Sherlock moaned as he felt his skin on his shoulder prick. “Fifteen.” He could feel that one welt. He stretched the skin to make it burn.
Sherlock blushed and tried to hide himself. He was still in an argument, however, and he was going to win.
Sherlock smirked but kept his pace. Both he and John groaned loudly when Sherlock bottomed out. Sherlock waited there, petting John’s back as they both adjusted.
John brushed a finger over Sherlock’s erection. Sherlock moaned and pushed into the contact. John wanted him to come untouched though so he took his finger away quickly.
Sherlock didn’t know if John just didn’t know how to tie such a knot or if he needed the reassurance that Sherlock wasn’t going to molest him. Normally he’d be able to deduce it but sentiment (and lust) was messing with his deductions.
“Fuck,” Sherlock swore. He hadn’t even noticed that he was low last time he masturbated. He didn’t have a backup tube.
Sherlock tried to shake his head but couldn’t. He wasn’t there. What they’d done was hot, but it took too much of his attention and he hadn’t been able to focus on himself.
“Strokes with five different implements. We’ll start with twenty-five spankings and work our way down to five with a cane,” John said.
They’d been sitting in a dirty ally for five hours. John should have insisted on a shower first but too late now. He kicked off his pants and ran hot water over the flannel.
Sherlock nearly chocked when he cried out. His legs shook but he couldn’t close them. John watched his cock start to bob. His eyes rolled back in his head.
“Oh, thanks.” John gave his Dom a tight smile. He didn’t really need looking after. He hoped his Dom wouldn’t buy him clothing and expect to feed him. He wanted to be independent.
The counsellor moved on to Dom space and Dom drop before Sherlock was done with her. Although, he knew her knowledge was limited to the basics, being a sub herself. While she and John chatted Sherlock arranged all the sub care information on his hard drive. He found his hard drive was getting full and storing all sub info under “John” wasn’t going to work because some related only to crime. But, other information in the “sub” folder and sub-folders could help John in the future. He’d have to reorganize the whole thing. Perhaps he could do it in a different way so he’d get more storage space.
John turned, hoping that Sherlock had just gone to get lube but Sherlock was sitting back on his heels. Cheeks pink, eyes side and bright.
So, Sherlock still thought the relationship was a fake. John hadn’t made any progress at all. And Sherlock was using them cuddling as evidence. Maybe he hadn’t enjoyed it after all.
“Good boy,” John said and moved the feather’s down to Sherlock’s belly button. Sherlock tensed and released his abs as the feathers danced over them. John dipped the feathers into Sherlock’s belly button and Sherlock exhaled noisily but managed to hold still. “God, you’re gorgeous,” John murmured. He lowered the feathers, running them through Sherlock’s pubic hair. It was clear Sherlock wanted to move his hips, it must have tickled terribly so John moved on quickly. He dragged the feather down, moving to the side and running it along the inside of Sherlock’s thigh, ignoring Sherlock’s bobbing cock.
John clicked the button and Sherlock jolted as if he’d been shocked. Sherlock leaned back on his elbows, bowing his chest toward the bed. John swatted his pushed up arse and he made a high pitched squeal John found incredibly hot.
Another crack and pain bloomed over his hip. “Two,” he said as he rut against the sheet. His erection had wilted a bit during the spanking, taking some of the pressure off but now it was filling so fast he felt dizzy.
She had told him stories, how she’d gone to school, even had offers to go to university, had a bright future before her scent changed from beta to omega and she was sold to their father. Their father was a kind man, sweet to her, he never forced her to do anything she didn’t want to do. It was why Sherlock was seven years younger than Mycroft. He was an accident, and Mycroft never let him forget it.
Sherlock wasn’t sure he’d be able to keep John if they engaged in a sexual relationship, John might get frustrated and hurt, and leave. But the fact that he’d seen Sherlock’s fear and soothed it gave Sherlock hope.
“Mycroft!” John shouted from his door and he knew he didn’t imagine Mycroft wiping his eyes as he got into the sleek black car.
Sherlock started sucking every time he thrust his tongue forward, forcing John’s hips back to take him deeper.
He didn’t know what he was going to say next; he’d just been rambling. Whatever it was, it didn’t matter, because Sherlock stepped forward, took John in his arms, tilted his head and kissed him. It was sweet, chaste, just a peck, then it was gone. Sherlock pulled back to deduce how the action had been received before diving back in.
Rosie’s chin started quivering. Oh, god, she was about to cry. If she ruined her makeup she’d kill him.
“Sher—! Sher—! Sherl—aah!” John was fairly certain he’d never been this hard. His pants had turned into pleas. “Sherlllllock…”
John went over to his jacket and pulled out two condoms and a tube of medical lubricant, just as Sherlock had deduced. He was happy to be proven correct.
Sherlock twitched but held his cock firm, just like John had told him to, and kept it from touching anything.
Sherlock belonged with Irene. John thought Sherlock was asexual before The Woman. But then he’d gone and had a lot of steamy sex with Janine. John had read all the articles. Twice.
Sherlock didn’t answer he just came over to John. He reached down and stroked John through his trousers.
“This is a horrible idea,” John said, his voice slightly muffled from where his face was pressed against Sherlock’s shoulder.
John looked down to see his flesh pushed out around the bars. His cock was trying to get hard but couldn’t. He saw a bead of clear fluid drip from the top.
John was taken aback. He gaped at Mycroft, who was running his hand through his hair and straightening his suit.
Knowing better than to wait for news of the rogue alien escape pod to hit the general populace, and that it'd be too much to ask that the pod would go unnoticed, Mycroft phoned the council member that took his place as leader while he was away.
“Yes,” John said. He thought it was better to admit it seeing as how Sherlock knew the truth anyway and lying was pointless.
Sorry for not following through on everything, I'm going to update the tags and mark it as complete since this is an acceptable ending place. :)
The handwriting was sloppy, but the message was clear. The pen had been pushed down hard - John remembered how angry he’d been and how there had even been marks on the top of the coffee table. He’d run his finger over them, worried that Mary would see, then remembered that she was gone.
John felt his face heat but couldn’t help the giggle that escaped. Sherlock started chuckling and soon they were both laughing, heads pressed against each other, finally stopping with a kiss.
Sherlock tensed, he rocked back and forth as John watched. His legs fought against the restraints and John watched sweat slide down Sherlock’s back and precome leak from his cock.
Sherlock did. He wasn’t watching the screen though, he was watching John palm himself through his trousers. What was happening? He had a methodical plan for seducing John Watson and this wasn’t part of it.
His arse hit against the cold tub and he only had the tip of John’s cock in his mouth. He licked it and played with it, rubbing his tongue under the glans, swirling his tongue around the tip. He couldn’t back off, he had to have John’s cock in his mouth and it made him shiver. The tubs sides were angled so the dildo pressed against his prostate. He could already feel himself leaking. He shivered in the cold room. This was filthy.
“It’s a nightmare, you’re fine,” Sherlock’s repeated words sank in, after allowing John to pin him to the bed.
The thoughts of stopping disappeared as the blood left John’s head, his body deciding it was urgently needed elsewhere.
Sherlock emerged, looking delightfully rumpled. He yawned and mussed his curls. He didn’t say anything, just turned on the kettle.
Sherlock deduced that John had gone over to his house, intending to pack it up so he could sell it. He didn’t want to waste money on it now that he didn’t have a job. He’d done two—no, three—rooms before starting on Rosie’s.
“Hm?” Sherlock asked. He needed to catch this Evee for candy for his Flameon but the bastard thing kept jumping.
This was the most comfortable John had been since he returned. If he’d known his husband, his Dom, would be like this he would have been thrilled to be married. He regretted that he’d been too busy dreading the ordeal to enjoy it properly.
“Sherlock,” John said, irritated. He wanted a response, either an apology for being the cause or some commiseration.
Bill tried to pull away and Sherlock aborted his attempt to get John to touch his cock and forced Bill back to his neck. He turned his head to the side and James was waiting for him. After a quick snog he was assured that everyone was fixated on him and he focused on John again.
Sherlock realized he’d pulled back off John -- only the tip of John’s cock was still in his mouth. He moved his body forward slightly; James moved with Sherlock but didn’t push in further until Sherlock had John’s cock in the back of his throat again. Sherlock hummed, pleased with himself.
He didn’t blame his sister for not wanting to come. And he hadn’t been to her wedding so he didn’t hold it against her. (Even though he’d been in another country being shot at, at the time.) Still, he didn’t have any other family and he probably should bring at least one witness. He didn’t want his new Dom thinking he was incapable of friendship.
Sherlock squirted lube onto his hand and spread it over his cock. Then he squirted a dollop onto John’s arsehole and worked it in with two fingers, scissoring them to test how loose John was. John put up almost no resistance, in fact, he was squeezing on Sherlock’s fingers, trying to suck them deeper into his body.
Sherlock closed his eyes and set his head on the bed. His shoulders hitched with a sob as the tears ran. The next hits landed one on one cheek one on the other in rapid succession. “Nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three,” Sherlock counted in-between sobs. He was miserable and the punishment wasn’t even half over. Even the pleasure-pain he was getting from the butt plug wasn’t helping.
He rolled his eyes at himself. He was acting like a bloody teenager. He set his razor aside and opened the door.
John marched up to the door without waiting for Sherlock and entered the counselling centre. He had to lean heavily on his cane and he was irritated that it was no trouble for Sherlock to keep up. He asked the receptionist what room they were in and hobbled to the lift, pretending to ignore his large annoying shadow.
John swung the paddle three times rapidly over Sherlock’s feet. There wasn’t just one hit for Sherlock to adjust to the sensation. Two on the right and one on the left. Sherlock pulled on the restraints around his ankles and arched in surprise. The butt plug shifted. He gasped and moaned. “Three!” He shouted because John had moved up and started paddling Sherlock’s arse.
Sherlock stopped, deducing what he could. There wasn’t much, the light was too dim to get a read on the driver. When Sherlock stopped both John and the cabbie did too.
Sherlock took his hand away and John thought it was punishment but it was just so Sherlock could lick it again.
“Shit,” John said, realizing that he’d attacked his lover. He crawled off Sherlock quickly, down and away to the foot of the bed. He turned away, swinging his legs off and pressing his bare feet to the cool floor. He held his head in his hands, horrified at his actions.
Sherlock pulled off without meeting any resistance—John’s hand wasn’t there to restrict, only guide—and glared at John.
John disappeared as fast as he’d come. He knew Sherlock could hear him walk around the bed and he fumbled with the Wartenberg Pinwheel, it falling to the ground. He hadn’t meant to but perhaps it would engage Sherlock.
There was a lot they had to take care of first. Safe words, limits and John wanted to work up to that. He wanted sweet sex, romantic blow jobs and desperate frottage before he got into the more serious stuff.
John got another finger in and scissored a bit before cursing and pouring some lube over his cock. Sherlock felt the cold goop drip down as John poured a little over his hole.
The counsellor cleared her throat. Once she had both men’s attention she said, “Well, I think we should start with sexual profiles.” When neither man contradicted her she continued, “Sherlock, let’s start with yours. I saw that you had ‘t’s next to all of your responses.” The man nodded but didn’t say anything. She decided to pry. “Why didn’t you update your sexual profile before turning thirty?”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth pulled up into a smile. “William Sherlock Scott Watson, it is, then?”
John stood and took Sherlock hand. Instead of leading him to the bedroom Sherlock led John to the bath, where the tub was filled with steaming warm water and bubbles.
John’s movements became erratic and Sherlock took John’s hips into his hands, pushing him forward as he moved back and pulling John close as he snapped his hips forward. He kept the angle the same.
John scratched the beard on his chin. “I’d decided not to marry unless it was the love of my life.” With a grimace he mislead her. “And since the love of my life died… Well, I wasn’t lucky enough to have two loves. I only got one.”
Together they stripped Sherlock’s shirt and pushed him back onto the cot. He leaned over to remove his shoes. It went slowly because he wasn’t focused on his task, more on watching John and James strip.
Sherlock crawled up slowly and laid on the bottom edge of the bed. He knew John did this so the belt didn’t wrap around and hit something he didn’t want it hitting. In this position, the plug put a tiny bit of pressure on his prostate. The little bundle of nerves used to be sensitive but now what made him hiss in pain before made him sigh in pleasure. He thrust forward and got more prostate stimulation. He moaned.
The handcuffs were unbuckled and John hissed in sympathy. Sherlock figured they were rubbed raw. He could feel them now that John had drawn his attention to them. They didn’t hurt as much as he expected. He felt like he was floating and he realized he was approaching subspace.
Sherlock had never been in this position. John was deep, his hips snapped against Sherlock. Sherlock looked up and saw fire in John’s eyes. It made his toes tingle.
John had denied his sexuality at every opportunity before Sherlock’s fall. But now he wasn’t so defensive.
“Oh, no, he’s been great actually,” John said. He realized just how many times he called Lestrade to complain about his flatmate and cringed.
James started kissing the back of Sherlock’s neck and Sherlock angled his head to give him better access.
John tested the massager he bought, making it buzz as he added batteries. He’d been embarrassed at the shop picking it out but imagining it in Sherlock gave him the strength to ignore the shop girl’s, “Have fun!” as he left.
At a loss for what else to do Sherlock masturbated. John could be very stubborn, especially when it came to Sherlock’s health. And being wound up like this was detrimental to case solving.
Sherlock looked up at John, needing assurance. James had prepared him well, there’d been no pain, but there hadn’t been any pleasure either.
So, when John said he wanted to go out that night Sherlock had put on his best suit and the purple shirt John liked so much and tucked the little box with John’s ring into his pocket, just in case.
When John was done with Sherlock’s foot he wrapped the pinwheel around Sherlock’s ankle, only touching the parts not touching the mattress, not giving Sherlock any sensory input other than that provided by the little metal pins.
No, he wasn’t going to subject his sub to his family’s snide or pitying (depending on the family member) comments. John wouldn’t appreciate it and Sherlock didn’t want to endure it.
Then Sherlock screamed, an ear-splitting shriek and John worried he’d killed him. But more come shot out of the tip of Sherlock’s cock, dripping messily over the bed and Sherlock’s legs.
“Mmm,” a hum was the warning Sherlock got before another, more compact body pressed against his, this time from behind. Smaller hands groped his arse. There was a hiss as John inhaled.
Sherlock grunted in response and John realized his Dom had just come. He must have been desperate to wank instead of wait for John to be able to finish him.
Yet he was the most beautiful man Sherlock had ever laid eyes on. Sherlock wanted to peel him out of that uniform and take him to bed.
When he got back upstairs with the frozen peas John was sitting on the edge of the bed tugging on the cage fruitlessly making little destressed annoyed sounds.
It probably wouldn’t matter. After this appointment, John would probably laugh at him and call him a freak.
“John Watson, that man has been in love with you since you shot that cabbie—yes, I know about that—and if you break his heart, I’ll break your legs.”
“I don’t want to fuck you,” Sherlock interrupted. It was strange. He normally didn’t care if he topped or bottomed, there was just something about John. He wanted to be able to see him.
“We were at Sherlock’s flat. Your stuff is in a second bedroom. Before Sherlock, you were having trouble getting hours.”
“John, John!” Sherlock shouted, alarmed. His cock was hard now. John knew the sensation was different.
“Well, I can see you boys are in the middle of something. I’ll leave you to it,” Mrs Hudson said brightly.
Sherlock sighed again. John had gone out. He probably thought Sherlock was asleep, as if Sherlock could sleep when they were done with their antibiotics and he was once again free to wring orgasm after orgasm from John’s willing body.
Their silvery eyes were wide and they were taking gulping breaths as they shivered. Their lips were blue.
The tension released and Sherlock pounded into him, trying to avoid his sensitive prostate, coming quickly. His vision went white and he realized he had stopped breathing. He took a deep breath and carefully pulled out. John slumped down bonelessly onto the bed.
What if John wanted to see Mummy for Christmas? Sherlock wasn’t sure he could live through that again.
Sherlock looked horrified, rightfully so. “You thought I—dear god, John! Even in our past lives you weren’t that dim.”
“What?” Sherlock asked with a smile before biting along the top of John’s shoulder. “They’re love bites, John. Proof that I love you.”
John had survived a warzone by trusting his instincts and they were telling him that something was wrong. But it wasn't about the creature in front of him (well, other than the fact that it obviously wasn't human). Something was wrong on the craft.
John realized he shouldn’t be standing next to the bathroom door and left to turn on the kettle. It clicked off before Sherlock emerged and John made a cuppa for each of them and stuck some bread in the toaster.
Sherlock wasn’t sure he had ever had a thought ever. His whole body was alight. All his nerve endings sang. It was better than the drugs.
His arm was numb, he’d been shot. But he wasn’t in any real pain. The sun was beating down and John’s pack was heavy. He could see Sherlock in front of him. The idiot was standing up, wearing that heavy coat in the stifling heat. He was using binoculars, trying to find the sniper.
if he was lucky he’d live. He’d have to. He couldn’t die. It wasn’t possible. He was too smart, too remarkable. He was an unappreciated hero, and heroes don’t die.
When their eyes met, Sherlock’s widened in surprise. John was looking at him in a way no one had ever looked at him before. He didn’t recognize the emotion but it made his chest feel odd.
Right now, John was fond/horny and something else Sherlock had never been able to place. It must be loving.
Sherlock growled. Bastard! He stood and took a swing at the man but everything was fuzzy and out of focus and he missed, nearly falling on his face.
Rosie started wailing and John put his phone in his pocket. He’d hear it if Sherlock decided to text from wherever he’d gone off to.
Sherlock looked around, all eyes were on him. Everyone was watching him getting fucked roughly by Bill. Clear latex stretched obscenely and snapped, some semen leaking out as James removed his condom. A drop landed on Sherlock’s flank. Sherlock spread his legs more and writhed. This was better than all his fantasies.
Three times in rapid succession the paddle swung down and up, hitting the bottom of Sherlock’s plush arse, causing it to jiggle and pain bloomed not only where John hit but it pulled on the marks left by the crop, causing an additional sting. His erection dragged over the sheets. Plus his feet started to burn. His brain flooded and he forgot his own name.
“Good thing you shave your legs. Don’t have to worry about the hair getting caught up in the scabs,” Sherlock said.
The toilet flushed and it took John a bit to wash his hands. He returned to the couch without turning on the kettle.
His first touches were tentative, Sherlock would think them teasing but the expression on John’s face told him otherwise. John was nervous, or perhaps just cautious.
Sherlock wanked him with the shower gel. Long teasing strokes, twisting a bit at the head of his cock.
He was going to keep talking but John slid down the couch and leaned forward to touch Sherlock’s knee. He was smiling softly.
Thankfully the man let him go after a few more threats. John wasn’t sure what he would have done if the Dom had tried to do more than that. It was obvious the man had some training, not as much as John but enough that he wasn’t helpless. It would have been a difficult fight and John was happy to avoid it. Even though he’d had to endure the man’s touch.
Until Sherlock rested his hand on the back of John’s neck. His hand was warm and large. Strong, but gentle. It was nice and he had to force himself not to lean into the contact.
John would have killed for a relationship with Sherlock (and, if you counted the cabbie, did) before the fall. Then there was the whole thing with Mary. God, that had been a mistake. Sherlock had come back from the dead, a miracle, and John had shunned him. John had hit him, had beat him, had been horrible to him, and Sherlock was still there sitting on the couch with John.
And, oh, that was better. He was being shagged by two men, two army men, two muscular, blond men, sandwiched between their huge cocks…
“I feel the same,” Sherlock said. It was long overdue, their getting together. He captured John’s lips and kissed him slowly. Working John’s mouth open and tangling his tongue with his.
Sherlock ran up the stairs to go get John. He woke him gently and when John sat up Sherlock realized John was hard.
It worked. John’s mouth ticked up in that dangerous half smile Sherlock loved before the first slap landed on his arse. John didn’t hold back and Sherlock felt warmth bloom in his arse cheek. “One,” Sherlock counted obediently. This was a common punishment and he knew what was expected.
Sherlock took a quick shower and wrapped a towel around his hips, forgoing a dressing gown in case John was still feeling amorous.
Sherlock blinked in confusion. Why was John embarrassed? He was bisexual, it was a sex scene, something most people felt attraction during, and he had a normal physical response, probably helped along by the movement of Sherlock’s feet. If anything, it should be Sherlock embarrassed because he provoked it.
John was trying but Sherlock had licked his palm and was stroking John to full hardness. Once John was hard in Sherlock’s hand Sherlock turned to look at the house, keeping a slow rhythm over John’s cock.
John sighed happily. He realized his hands were all over Sherlock, petting and kneading his arms. “I can’t believe I get to see you again.”
Sherlock spread his legs further, his eyes glued to John’s large cock. It wasn’t outrageously large, but it wasn’t average, either. It was a deep dusky red, glistening with lube. He groaned when John sped up.
Once he was sure John was fine he allowed himself to be led away. He listened to the counsellor explain sub drop carefully. He hadn’t deleted all the information about sub care from school, but he had deleted some (since he’d never thought he’d have a sub he cared about).
John opened the door, stuck his head out and asked Sherlock, “Well? Are you going to join me or not?”
The plug was a little wider than the sound, especially around the ridges but John really wanted Sherlock to put it on.
Sherlock wanted to meet up but he wasn’t making sense. It was almost as if he were running away. John needed to clarify.
"She's been murdered. Somebody wanted it to look accidental," the creature stated as if it was boring but there was a light in their eyes. "What's that?" They pointed at the communications equipment.
Sherlock reached out, exposing himself, and ran his hand down one of John’s arms. It was muscular despite the rest he’d taken to heal. The scar on his shoulder was still red and angry and it was easy to deduce how much trouble John had had in physical therapy. Sherlock looked away from the mark and pulled John’s arm forward, admiring the tan line around his wrist.
John soon found himself on his knees, resting his body weight on his elbows, face pushed into a pillow.
Sherlock could deduce how little food John had at home and declined the apple figuring it would be better for John to eat it, if not now then after their appointment. John was a proud man and Sherlock didn’t think he’d stand for Sherlock buying him food after they were done with the councillor.
Mycroft clicked on the link that would take him to John's profile. He read it through twice, not believing in luck but uncertain what else this could be. It was too perfect.
“Now, I want you to pick up the plug.” The penis plug John had bought had little bumps, ridges around the outside and was hollow on the inside. There was a ring around the top that was meant to wrap around the cock head.
His foot twitched sideways but John ignored it like the curling of Sherlock’s toes. John dragged the wheel over each of Sherlock’s tendons down to the tips of each of Sherlock’s toes and back up to Sherlock’s ankle. Starting from Sherlock’s big toe all the way down to the littlest, curling around each nail, inside, outside, inside, outside. The giving Sherlock the exquisite torture he craved until his entire foot was covered in lines of little red dots.
John must have felt the same need to be close because he leaned forward, hovering over Sherlock. He pulled Sherlock’s legs over his shoulders and bent Sherlock in half. Sherlock locked his ankles to keep his legs in place. He shook as John went deeper than anyone had gone yet.
He was jolted out by John shifting around on the couch. He opened an eye in irritation to glare at his flatmate and saw that John was flushed. Sherlock could hear the noises from the tv, fake sex sounds. He nudged John with his feet to try and get him to settle down so Sherlock could go back to the important work of thinking. This seemed to make John shift more and Sherlock upped his efforts. This had gone on for nearly a minute when his foot hit something.
John was in line with his shopping at the Asda when his boss called out his name. He tried to be vague about the nature of his emergency and still have an explanation for why he was doing shopping. She told him to come in early,
“I have had a lot of fantasies about us over the years, involving a lot of sex of a sort I’ve never had. I thought since you felt the same way about me that I did you that you wouldn’t mind playing them out with me.”
John was embarrassed by his bedsit and he made Sherlock wait in the taxi while he ran up and changed. He didn’t know how he ended up with such a posh Dom. Shouldn’t they have matched him within his own social sphere? God, as if he weren’t pathetic enough. He really didn’t need to invite the comparison with that… specimen.
Sherlock’s expression made the whole thing worse. He was terrified. John wondered if he knew this man, knew what was going to happen to him… whatever it was it was going to be bad. John chocked on a sob when he realized this might be the last time he ever saw him.
Sherlock opened his mouth but realized he had no idea what the proper command was. Would it be too much to tell John to kneel? That was only for collaring ceremonies, wasn’t it?
“Thirteen!” Sherlock shouted as pain bloomed over the bottom of his feet. He writhed on the sheets and whimpered with need. “Brilliant, you’re brilliant. God, you’re perfect,” Sherlock babbled as he got a fresh wave of endorphins.
By the time she was focused on him, discussing Dom space and Dom drop and the difference between the two and what to do in each case, John was recovered.
John had flipped the switch so they could hear NASA but hadn't flipped the one so NASA could hear them. Without going back to the communication room he couldn’t contact them for help, not that it mattered, they wouldn’t get here for a year.
As soon as they were out of the sun the soldiers stripped off their jackets and Sherlock did the same. The wardrobe went ignored—they just dropped their garments on the floor. His bedfellows weren’t planning on taking their time, then. John and James pulled off their formerly white vests which had been stained over time by dirt and sweat, and Sherlock could only stand and gape. They had tan lines. He hadn’t realized they would have tan lines. Stupid of him to have missed—
Three days later John limped up the stairs with Sherlock’s help. He was embarrassed, the suspect had trained her housecat to attack any intruders and he stepped forward to protect Sherlock from the beast. He hadn’t anticipated how difficult it was to fight a nine-pound animal hell-bent on eating his leg.
“Anyway, turns out he’d been dying the whole time and never told anyone. I think that’s why he never married, personally. He didn’t want to leave his spouse alone.”
John looked down at Sherlock fondly. Sherlock didn’t laugh. In fact, John wouldn’t be surprised if he came home to find a kitten Sherlock decided to train for them to have. He also didn't tease John or mock his masculinity. He treated John the way he always had before. Which, John thought, was a big hint that they'd been in love with each other from the beginning.
The official started talking and the Dom looked away. John took a couple breaths to try to get himself under control. He examined the man while his attention was elsewhere. He was almost strange looking but not unpleasant. Not at all unpleasant. In fact, John would say William was way out of his league.
Sherlock had added to it. He included the proposal and John saying “yes” and them keeping bees on the rooftop. He’d stopped there, not wanting to include the wedding both because he didn’t want to give his plans away and he didn’t know what type of wedding John wanted.
John pushed him away and Sherlock sat up reluctantly. He carefully arranged his towel over his erection. John noticed and whatever he wanted to say was lost.
John came back and set the glass on the nightstand. He rubbed cream into all of Sherlock’s sore spots, being very careful and gentle. Sherlock soaked in the attention and had a small smile when John was done whispering praises and tending to Sherlock’s welts and bruises. He said he hadn’t broken the skin and Sherlock smiled, John was always so careful, so perfect.
John groaned. He wasn’t patient. He wanted this. He wanted more. He wanted it all. He wanted it now.
John just hummed in response. Then he ground his crotch against Sherlock’s once, twice then in a slow steady rhythm that drove Sherlock wild.
“Yes!” Sherlock latched on to the thought. If John was rough he would be distracted and he could just float on the sensation. “Choke me.”
John didn't bother answering. Instead, he looked to Sherlock for assistance. Hadn’t he made it clear that Sherlock was allowed to hurt him? He doubted Sherlock could kill O'Murtagh with his bare hands. Plus, the suit provided excellent protection.
John started giggling. “Like I can take you seriously! You look just like you did when we first met. What are you, twelve?”
“And by the time I figured out I was in love with you I was too late and I was happy to stand aside because I want you to be happy. That’s all I want, is for you to be happy.”
This omega smelt like… sun after a spring rain. He still had a sweet base note, but it wasn’t cloying.
Sherlock’s became breathless when he first caught sight of his sub. His uniform had been taken in poorly, he was too skinny, he was limping, he didn’t look up at anyone and he looked like he hadn’t slept in a week.
John watched as his friend got sucked deeper and deeper into his game. He was always on his phone before and he hadn’t realized it could get worse. It was affecting the work. He wasn’t taking cases, even interesting ones and he didn’t care.
John took both their erections in hand and stroked. He set a brutal pace and came not a minute later.
He took Sherlock’s cock in his hand and wrapped his mouth around the head. He groaned, Sherlock had been using strawberry flavoured lubricant and it was surprisingly delicious.
“Hold still for me,” John ordered and started dragging a feather over Sherlock’s skin. He started at the tip of Sherlock’s right hand, brushing over the pads of his fingers before dragging along the backs of Sherlock’s hands. He flicked the feather against Sherlock’s wrist, just above the ribbon. Sherlock inhaled sharply but didn’t flinch.
Lestrade hadn’t heard from Sherlock in ages. Understandable, as he’d been busy with his new relationship with Molly. And, Molly had been occupied with Lestrade so she’d been no help either.
“Great!” the counsellor chirped, breaking the spell. “I’d like a follow-up appointment in a week, cover any problems you two are having and see how you’re settling in. What day is best for you?”
They shook again when Sherlock caught his lips in a kiss and he nearly whimpered when Sherlock whispered in his ear to keep watch. John turned his eyes to the house they were supposed to be watching and felt Sherlock pawing at his trousers.
Sherlock closed his eyes for a second, just a second, it had been a very powerful orgasm and he was a bit tired.
As he wrapped his hand around his cock he moved back on the dildo, angling his hips so the drag was just right across his prostate. The precome was dripping enough that he could work his cock without additional lube.
All he could smell was sweat and sex. His whole body was slick, his legs and cock burned, he was being touched by so many hands, but none of them were where he needed it. Testicles slapped against his balls, raising higher with each thrust. His forearms slid on the carpet and his fingers balled into fists.
“I want you to dominate me,” John repeated. “I want you to take the riding crop to my back, pour candle wax on me. Hurt me.”
John started running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. It was the first time anyone had ever touched him like this. Gently, like they cared. Like they wanted to bring him pleasure.
John guided Sherlock so he was bent over the edge of the bed, his nearly purple cock trapped in soft cotton sheets. After a brief argument, John took the pair of Lestrade’s handcuffs that Sherlock had stolen and locked Sherlock’s hands behind his back. He put a small but long butt plug in, with the placement Sherlock knew it’d drag over his sensitive prostate with every strike.
John's head was swimming. He had been thrown from the spacecraft when they crash-landed. He sat on the red dirt and flexed various parts of his body, searching for a break. He had some bruises and possibly a concussion but otherwise, he seemed fine.
John glanced up at the counsellor to see if he was allowed to look but she was staring at Sherlock with a frown on her face. John glanced at him and saw that he’d abandoned the folder on the floor and had John’s profile open. He was examining it as one would a slide on a microscope.
James was behind him now (when had that happened?), he was rubbing his erection between Sherlock’s arse cheeks through their clothing.
John felt it, he looked like he did that first night, cable knit jumper and all. He looked over at Sherlock and saw he was in that thrice-damned shirt. God, he loved that shirt.
Sherlock let go of John and kept walking. John was tempted to run after him to hold his hand again but reminded himself that he wasn’t twelve and was in the middle of a police station.
James wrapped his hand around the back of Sherlock’s head and pulled so Sherlock would look up at him.
"Oh!" Sherlock gasped as he held the pipe. "You're explorers! Are you trying to colonize this planet?"
“Here, use mine,” John said, startling himself. He needed the man to come closer. When he saw him he’d know. Those eyes wouldn’t be the same. Then John could—
John wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s neck and yanked his head down for a kiss. John’s lips weren’t chapped, they were slick. Of course, he worked in the hospital, he had access to Chapstick. He was a doctor or… something… knew… dehydration…
John held in a sigh. He could tell by the tilt of her words she’d already had more than a few. Thank Christ she wasn’t slurring yet, she might remember what he had to say.
Sherlock shook himself from his thoughts quickly enough John didn’t notice. He raised up to his knees and tore open the packet.
Sherlock swallowed thickly. He shouldn’t do this, he should allow John to seek out competent partners. But he didn’t want to. He wanted John all to himself. He wanted to put a nice ring around his finger,
He wanted back to those early days when it was just the two of them against the world. Sherlock was happy they were having sex but their relationship had broken when he jumped and it had never been the same.
“Cock, I want your cock,” John said. He needed something more than a finger. Though he was pretty sure he’d come as soon as Sherlock entered him.
John walked backward, pulling Sherlock. Their kissing became sloppy, the movement making it hard to maintain proper contact. It didn’t bother John, and Sherlock seemed fine with it until John pushed him back into his chair.
Blood stained where Sherlock had fallen and John started sinking, the sand impeding his progress. He needed to get there. He couldn’t let Sherlock die. Not now.
James moved as if to kiss Sherlock but paused just before their lips met. “You think he needs everyone to focus on pleasuring him?” he said to Bill.
“Oh, yeah,” James said. He walked towards them and Sherlock could see his erection before the tip of it nudged his cheek.
And sexually frustrated. Apparently, Sherlock didn’t eat on cases and neither did he have sex. Though, the last one, at least, was probably accurate.
In that one word Sherlock could read the answer, yes John always moved like that on prostate exams. Sherlock felt sorry for John’s patients.
Sherlock's brain finally disengages from his project and he focuses on his mother, thinking about everything she's
He was so involved with his thoughts he hadn’t noticed that his father had left and was shocked when he returned, saying it was time.
John left after his glass was empty. He browsed in some shop windows, trying to find the perfect gift but came up empty-handed. It was getting very close to Christmas. John was frustrated and mad at himself.
“Tell me how it feels,” John said. He lost composure watching the rod move. He undid his flies and palmed his own cock.
Water didn’t work well as a lubricant so Sherlock uncapped his conditioner and poured a generous amount onto his hand. He leaned down to spread some on both his and John’s erections. Then he had to bend down so he could take them both in hand.
Clara had promised John that she wouldn’t press charges if Harry behaved herself during the divorce. Clearly, Harry had said something. Again.
Sherlock slid up John’s cock and thrust his own cock deeper. Then carefully took more of John’s cock into his mouth and slid his own cock out. He slowly worked himself into a rhythm, hands gripping hard to keep a writhing John Watson in place.
“Oh!” he gasped as he ran straight into Sherlock. He took a step back and saw Sherlock look at him piercingly. He was deducing John.
“Oh! Oh! Oh!” Sherlock gasped as John’s thrusts propelled him up the bed until his head hit the headboard.
Sherlock fondled his balls then reached behind, applying lube to his hole. He worked a finger in and a second.
It took some time to prepare. John boiled the steel sounds to disinfect them and then it took them time to cool. John took this time to make sure the lubricant he bought was sterile and grab a pair of sterile surgical gloves and disinfectant from their first aid kit. He disinfected a tray and set everything out on it.
With narrowed eyes, John looked at Sherlock. Doms didn’t like being bound. Had he taken this seriously at all or had he just made stuff up?
A movement in a dark shop window caught John’s attention. He looked at it, but there was nothing there. It was a reflection. He looked at the street and realized there was a car following them. A cab.
He was a great brown dragon, much like John. Though, John’s brown was lighter and sandier. Like sand, John had spots in a mix of yellows, dark and light browns. John was their medic, but he was still combat trained. He had fantastic control over his dragon fire and was more accurate than a lot of dragons with his type of weapon. His range wasn’t long, though, and his skillset was too valuable to waste on putting him on the frontlines.
“Ah, Jesus!” With one hand James pulled Sherlock’s hair and with the other he held Sherlock’s head still while he thrusted.
Sherlock smiled and kissed John. When he leaned back to look into his lover’s eyes he realized that he hadn’t got to watch John’s orgasm face.
Sorry about not post, I ran out of meds and had to see the doctor and when I don't have meds I can't do anything, let alone write.
Making a noise of disagreement, Sherlock slowly and gently took John’s hand, stroking the top and causing John’s fist to relax. “I hurt you,” he said.
The plug made the cage so much worse. John had grown accustomed to the weight, he’d even adjusted to the frustrating throbbing sensation when his cock had tried to get hard. But now he had something rubbing against his prostate. He wildly imagined that he was leaking so much that he had a wet spot on his trousers. He hadn’t, of course, but it sure felt like it.
So, I’m back. I didn’t think I would make it to the new year but since I did I thought I should finish this story properly. I'm happy to answer any questions. They can be dm’d on twitter
Sherlock imagined John, sitting on the edge of his chair, legs spread, Sherlock’s fingers up his arse and his face buried in John’s dark pubic hair. Mouth filled with that huge cock. John’s come voluminous after so much prostate stimulation. Sherlock could keep him on edge for hours. Teasing him with his hands and tongue until he begged to come. Then swallowing everything. Having John’s taste on his tongue.
Sherlock had just given Lestrade his statement when the alarm went off and John announced it was the last pill. John had lied to Lestrade and the other officers, saying Sherlock had exposed them with one of his experiments. He’d discussed this with Sherlock beforehand. John hadn’t wanted to blame Sherlock when he was actually the one at fault but Sherlock had insisted that it was the most believable lie and had told it to Greg the next time he saw him.
He wanted John’s ring on his finger, proof that John had chosen him and he wanted his ring on John’s finger so all the various people who wanted to flirt with him would know that he was taken. That he was Sherlock’s.
He gave John’s arsehole one last good suck before deciding he’d done an adequate job and moving up to lie beside John.
Don't worry about the advent fic messing with this schedule. I have the next four chapters written so if I get behind it's not a huge deal. Me forgetting to post on Wednesday, however, is a huge risk. lol
Then the world turned upside down. John was straddling his legs and hips, pinning him to the bed. His wrists were trapped above his head. He put up a token struggle then looked up at John, licking his lips.
“Fuck,” he heard, whispered above him and he looked up to see Sherlock looking down at him like he was the sun.
Now the blond captain was fucking the brunette. Looks like everyone got a turn. Sherlock grunted as he matched the rhythm. He heard the bathroom door open but dismissed it.
John did his morning ablutions, rolling the thought around in his brain as he shaved. If Sherlock were bisexual, did that mean he was interested in a relationship with John?
It took only seconds for Sherlock to lose his patience. “Cock! Touch my cock,” he said without using any command. This was going further, he wanted John to be able to protest.
John blinked up at him, mouth set in a grimace. He might have agreed with Sherlock except for the red lump on his forehead.
John wanted to tell him to stop but didn’t want to ruin it by scolding Sherlock. He might be in a weakened state and John didn’t want to misstep.
Mycroft continued as if John hadn’t spoken. “There won’t be a funeral, this time.” He pursed his lips. “I was against even this but he insisted.”
With Sherlock secured James looked up at Murray. “You going to just stand there or are you going to join us?” he asked him.
He could take in more this way. He could see John’s abdominal muscles work from below his stomach. How John’s erection had started leaking a puddle onto Sherlock’s stomach. How John’s muscles tightened on the way up and different ones tightened on the way down. How the muscles in John’s arms shifted, rippled. How John bit his lip and gasped whenever he hit his prostate. John rolled his hips as he sunk down and soon he was sweating. He gasped and Sherlock started raising his hips to meet John’s and soon they’d worked themselves into a rhythm.
John’s ring, Sherlock’s physical claim, caught the light and Sherlock's need became too much. He bent forward onto his knees, wrapping a hand around his own cock and stroking it roughly. He chased orgasm, uncaring that he might chafe himself. The scarf tugged at his wrists with each movement, reminding him he was still bound. He bit his lip, he’d never been this hard in his life.
Sherlock didn’t seem to bothered by it. He arched his back, causing John to gasp, raised his arms and stretched like some sort of big cat.
Sherlock was able to listen to John’s stories and engage with him properly. John glowed in the light of the candle Angelo brought for their table. When John started giggling with a glass of wine in his hand Sherlock nearly broke and proposed right then.
Sherlock looked up at John, confused and a little irritated. “What do you mean no?” He could tell John wanted it and it wasn’t like John was ever the one to say they had to get to crime scenes right away.
“Shh.” John didn’t want Sherlock to be insecure. He wasn’t going anywhere, ever. He had everything he ever wanted. Much more than he ever thought he would. As grand as it was to stand in Sherlock’s shadow and laugh over Chinese, John always wanted more.
As Jawn spoke another Terran in a suit came out with a large pipe in their hands. Sherloc couldn't tell much about the Terran except it had
But he observed everyone in town, she was the exception, the only exception as far as he could see. He wouldn’t be that lucky.
Sherlock groaned and John felt his fingers card through his hair. Sherlock didn’t push his head down just flexed his fingers and stroked.
Sherlock didn’t resist as John pulled him back and flipped him over. He blinked blearily up at John.
“Alright,” Sherlock said, agreeing and ending the conversation. He would just have to be more careful. It wasn’t just him anymore.
John instead said, “Well, I’ve been busy. I do have a daughter and Sherlock does his own thing. It’s not unusual for him not to contact me for weeks.”
John prayed for whatever gave him the patience for Mycroft’s games in the past and pushed the conversation forward. “Yes, well, that’s the thing. He leaves me out of dangerous cases but he usually contacts me to tell me all about them after.”
The pressure at his arse grew and grew and suddenly eased as the head of James’s cock pushed in. James paused, his panting breath cooling Sherlock’s back and his rough hands digging into Sherlock’s hips.
With a huff, John forced the papers back in the folder, slammed the folder shut, threw it on the floor and glared at his Dom.
John opened his mouth to say that he had a home but he didn’t know if Sherlock would want to live with him. He hadn’t minded Rosie on the occasions John had fallen asleep on the couch or crashed in his old room. He’d even gotten a cot for her. But, having a child around occasionally and living with one were two different things.
“Holiday, huh?” Sholto’s expression turned when he looked at Sherlock. “Who are you and what are you really doing here?”
The water started to get cold and Sherlock helped John out of the tub. He wrapped a large towel around John and started to dry him. He used a smaller towel to dry John’s hair and he kissed John’s tears away.
“Why, sir?” Anthea was startled and Mycroft understood why, he never cleared his schedule and he had an appointments scheduled. They’d need an excuse.
John took Sherlock’s face in his hand and Sherlock nuzzled into the contact. He opened his eyes in time to close them for a kiss.
who can't be blamed for any remaining errors, since I change things every five seconds right up to posting.
“I know you’re ready to go again and I don’t want you to have to wait,” John said, talking to Sherlock over his shoulder.
She nodded. “I don’t remember him, at all. Though he used to babysit me. Mum used to say he never married because he was in love with Martha. That he was waiting. She thought they were soulmates.” She smiled at the term.
to see John. He had James move to the side so if Sherlock looked down he could see John and could still suck enough that James wouldn’t go without.
“Fuck,” he said. He was so cold he could be fucking John and he’d still have trouble. He tried to wiggle a little, get a stream of water to warm up a bit and he slipped, just barely catching himself on the edge of the tub.
“Living arrangements,” she said. “We recommend that the couple live with each other. It makes it easy to fulfil the time requirement.”
"Ah, ah, ah!" O'Murtagh put a little pressure on the airlock latch. "The other door is open. I flip this and you and Watson go out onto Mars's surface. Good luck surviving that, it's getting dark."
Now that I'm done with the Advent Calendar fic I'll be updating this more regularly. Thanks for sticking with me! <3
Sherlock looked into John’s eyes, memorizing each different hue that made up the iris before turning his attention to John’s eyelashes. They were long, blond, the tips nearly white, and when Sherlock caught John’s mouth in a kiss they brushed against his cheek.
Sherlock strutted out and posed on the entrance to the living room, leaning against the wood separator so John could see his tail.
Sherlock walked up and spread his legs. He didn’t have to spread so far in this position and he groaned as he sunk between John’s thighs.
Before things started to get awkward the counsellor moved on to the list of subjects they needed to cover in their appointment.
Sherlock made desperate sounds as he sucked John’s cock. John could hear the lube squelch in his other hand, the buzz of the massager and it was music to John’s ears.
John had been wary about dominating Sherlock. They’d had a long conversation before he agreed to it. He was glad he did. He liked praising Sherlock and it was incredibly hot to have him at his mercy.
Sherlock could taste semen and latex. God, this was filthy. John’s cock was smooth, silky, warm and alive in his mouth. His saliva washed away the stronger tastes and he could taste skin. He made himself drool more to flush the tastes faster.
John allowed it so Sherlock took it as welcome. He kissed John while he peeled his nightclothes off, covering every bare bit of John’s skin with the press of his lips. He kissed over John’s nipples, down his stomach, up one leg, down the other, each of his toes, then he took John’s cock in his mouth and sucked. He licked and lapped at it until it was hard.
Sherlock strode out into the living room and interrogated the client. It was a boring case, the spouse was having an affair, and although there might have been some features of interest, there was a little something there about with whom she was cheating, Sherlock didn’t care. He had something better to occupy his attention.
Client! Sherlock popped up and ran to their room to get some clothing on. John ran into Sherlock’s room too. Sherlock looked at him, brow furrowed in confusion.
“Seven, eight!” Sherlock said with a half shriek as John landed two dead centre, dangerously close to his testicles. He tried to close his legs to protect himself, but he’d forgotten about the spreader bar. His ankles pulled at the restraints and he groaned as he realized he was exposed, trapped. God, it felt incredible.
Sherlock huffed out his nose a bit and when he relaxed more, he moved back so only the tip of John’s cock was in his mouth. Then he shifted forward so John was all the way down his throat again. He repeated this until James shuffled into a good position.
“Mycroft?” John rubbed his hand over his face. He didn’t quite believe Mycroft was here, standing on his doorstep.
Sherlock looked smug and slipped his finger out. He loosened his grip and just let their cocks glide together. He held John’s hips in place and John writhed. Sherlock controlled everything. He was completely at his mercy.
“Very well,” Mycroft finally ceased the cryptic game he was playing. “Sherlock has resumed the case he’d taken before Moriarty reappeared.”
“No, don’t lie. I know that look. I saw that look in your eyes before you jumped off that building and I swear to god if you do that again, if you try to leave me behind I will… I will…” John stammered trying to think of a threat.
Sherlock held his hand still as John moved over it. John traced lines on Sherlock’s bones, drew outlines around Sherlock’s fingernails, pushed harder over the pad of Sherlock’s thumb. Sherlock’s digit moved with the force, the pricks would be darker there.
Sherlock waited until John had a sandwich and some tea in him before cuddling up to him.  He pawed at John until the wretched turtleneck was on the floor. Sherlock kicked it under the chair. He’d dispose of it later.
He carefully extracted himself from John and put on his dressing gown. He padded downstairs to find he had eighteen missed texts and three missed calls.
Sherlock worked them in his hand before grabbing more lube. John felt a finger prodding at his arse. He tried to relax but Sherlock was just circling.
Sherlock sat down in his chair and kicked off his trousers and pants. He spread his legs wide and John smiled as he knelt between them. He stroked Sherlock’s thighs, the hair tickling his hands, and felt Sherlock tense when John leaned forward, breathing on his cock.
The war had started before John had been born. There were times of peace but the land his clan held was valuable and it was inevitable that other clans would attack for resources. No matter the peace treaty drawn up, eventually, one of the clans would break it and try to take their home. The brown dragons didn’t have hoards of gold or gems, no, nothing so trivial. The brown dragons controlled the mines that held the rocks that allowed dragons to shoot fire as opposed to just heated air.
Talking to Sherlock was out of the question. He had an algorithm that he was very proud of that had the shortest distance walk to the most pokestops and John really didn’t want to hear about it again.
“My wife,” the man said, finding his voice. “She’s been receiving these. She’s always very upset when she gets one and won’t tell me what they mean.”
Sherlock shut the door behind John and turned to look at him. John was fidgeting nervously and his eyes flickered between Sherlock and the items in his room.
“Bloody hell, Harry,” John was reeling. The siblings didn’t have the best relationship and he knew the divorce was hard on his sister (even though she was the one who started proceedings) and of course she was always more difficult when she’d been drinking but this was unreal.
They swapped places, while John scrubbed his back he washed his front. John spent a lot of time cleaning Sherlock arse too. Spreading his cheeks. Washing circles around his hole before washing over it. Tapping on it a few times before circling again. He pushed the tip of his finger in and twisted it. Sherlock was enjoying the sensation and he let John work for a little while longer. When John reached for conditioner for lubricant Sherlock turned around.
John licked his lips as he watched Sherlock do so. The shiny metal had to be cold by now. It was going to be in Sherlock. God.
John shook his head and glanced down, apparently ashamed. The counsellor could see this was upsetting Sherlock further. They were misunderstanding each other.
Then John buried his face in   Sherlock’s crotch and Sherlock yelped as warm wet heat enveloped his cock.
Sherlock figured that if John didn’t want to get married again he’d politely decline and their relationship would carry on like normal. Sherlock wouldn’t mind if John didn’t want to marry him after what happened with Mary. As long as John stayed by Sherlock’s side Sherlock was happy.
“I’ll give you a blow job.” John smiled. It was clear he had intended to say that in the first place.
Fully clothed Sherlock exited the bedroom to see John. He was standing in the hallway clutching a baby blanket. He looked up at Sherlock, eyes glistening.
He bought Sherlock a scarf, he knew Sherlock liked them, and gloves, his current pair had a little hole at one of the fingers, and they were very nice but they weren’t the perfect gift.
John had, almost magically, made Sherlock feel safe and comfortable. When the appointment was over Sherlock felt a bit floaty. Once they were out of the building and Sherlock was trying not to giggle at John’s attempt to catch a cab Sherlock was still feeling good.
“Nonsense,” Sherlock said airily. “I quite like the results, as long as you’re the big spoon.” He tried to lift his hips again. He couldn’t, but the attempt made his point clearly.
She didn’t bother putting on a mask, even going so far as to say her thoughts aloud, “He’s good-looking, and in the military.”
John hurried out of the room and Sherlock removed the last of his clothing. He stood in his room and wondered how he should be standing when John came back. Should he just wait like this? Sit on the bed so he wasn’t towering over John? Lie down and look relaxed?
He carefully fit John through the little metal rings. Then he locked the contraption around John’s testicles so it would stay in place. The thing came with a little lock, which Sherlock took the keys for eagerly and placed them on a chain around his neck.
Sherlock had a pained expression and just as John started to worry, Sherlock said, “I’m sorry. I just can’t take you seriously with that
So, when John was so deeply asleep he wouldn’t mind a little jostling Sherlock curled himself around John’s body, putting John’s head on his shoulder, tangling their legs, wrapping his arms around John’s body, closed his eyes, and fell asleep.
Sherlock nodded at John and tried to use a corner of the sheet (half ripped off the cot) to remove the semen from his abdomen. But it had already dried. He frowned at it.
“I know I’m not traditionally attractive though quite a lot of my ‘fan base’ as you put it finds me bed-able.
“Awake already? Slightly faster than I expected, though, that shouldn’t be a surprise, given your history.”
Sherlock leaned into John’s space, breathing on his neck as he grabbed his cup of tea, two plates, both slices of toast. He leaned back as if nothing happened and sauntered into the living room to the table in front of the window.
Just when John got the idea to reach under the towel there was a knock on the door and Mrs Hudson’s little, “Yoo, hoo!” could be heard above their heavy breathing.
He bounced twice, thrilled and excited. He liked it when John took control. When Captain Watson made an appearance it made him tingle.
There it was. Sherlock hadn’t been lying after all. John smiled down at the birth certificate. Of course, Sherlock would abandon the other names. Too common for him. The git had even lied about his birthday.
Then he remembered how she’d talked about Mr Hudson over breakfast and the stag night, how everything she said had grated on him, that he’d thought her silly, but they were just the same, weren’t they? John knew Mary wasn’t the one. He’d always known. He was just too damned stubborn. He was supposed to be the brave one - he’d been to war.
This was the part of the case that John hated. They had to wait for someone to do something or go somewhere before Sherlock had the last bit of evidence he needed. And this usually resulted in Sherlock and him tucked up in some dark alley next to a rank skip.
"Yeah, well over here they don't care much. They've been on the line with the Chinese and the Russians all day trying to pool resources for the next launch window." There was muffled shouting before the American man said, "Shit. Somebody told the news. This is getting out of hand. You'd better report to your government, looks like Watson survived. Hope you got a good rest on the ride back, you're in for a hell of a welcome back."
Sherlock leapt out of the bed and scrambled into the room. He shut the door behind him and chased John into the shower.
“Mmm!” Sherlock yelped in surprise. God, but he was huge! Sherlock couldn’t tell if he was bigger than his largest dildo but it felt like it. The condom clung despite the lube which Sherlock could feel leaking down his perineum and testicles.
“Get checked,” Sherlock ordered. “I have an experiment I want to run on diet’s effect on semen’s taste.”
Sherlock had a plan. He’d done a lot of research. He’d wanted to propose at Angelo’s or maybe the Chinese restaurant they’d gone to after their first case together but both Angelo and the internet said that was a bad idea. Sherlock didn’t want John to feel any pressure to have to say yes to save Sherlock embarrassment and he didn’t want John to say yes but then say he didn’t mean it when they got home.
Sherlock blindly reached for his keys and fit one into the lock. When John heard the click he sobbed.
He stepped forward and took Sherlock's face into his hand. His thumb brushed Sherlock's cheekbone as his other hand buried itself in Sherlock's curls. John pulled him down, stood on his toes and kissed him.
John took Sherlock’s face in his hands and kissed him, long and slow, keeping the rest of his body away so Sherlock wouldn’t touch him.
“Did you get it taken care of?” Bill asked, shaking off Sherlock’s attempts to hold his mouth to his skin.
John held his cane ready as he left the room. He wasn’t sure he wasn’t about to be kidnapped again. But when there was no one waiting for him in the hallway John relaxed a bit.
It was intriguing. He decided it was better to confront the driver here instead of leading him to the flat. The man might already have Sherlock’s address—it was on his website—but it’d be safer for John and Mrs Hudson to be out in the open. Sherlock glanced around, checking for possible accomplices before walking to the vehicle and rapping on the Driver’s side window.
“Look,” Lestrade’s face was pinched and he looked like he was at the end of his rope. “Sherlock is a great man.”
John looked over and saw that Sherlock had turned to his back while he was talking, and was looking up at the ceiling. He was so uncomfortable with emotions. It made John melt a little to see how Sherlock cared.
“Where’s John?” Sherlock asked. He felt well enough, though unfortunately it wasn’t a fun high, he wanted to know where his John was.
She glanced over at John and saw his mouth hanging open. Before she said anything he interjected, “You’re a virgin? You? Seriously?”
John narrowed his eyes at Sherlock, he possibly guessed Sherlock had been stealing his things, but he didn’t say anything.
“Not impossible, just improbable.” Sherlock’s whole body hurt. He needed to do some stretching before he tried that again.
was the experienced one so he should be giving orders in a fight. But with a score like that he’d have no choice but to obey.
"Yeah." John was startled by the creature's lack of attention span and unsettled by Mary's apparent murder. Plus, his head was killing him.
Sherlock huffed and sputtered indignantly. “At least I chose something I thought you’d like! You show up here looking like that and have the audacity to tease me.”
John chuckled at Sherlock’s antics before groaning. Sherlock had found a sensitive spot on John’s shoulder, right above his scar. After sucking a mark there Sherlock examined the skin thoroughly. John had multiple surgeries to try to repair the damage. He knew it still hurt John, that it got locked up when there was bad weather and it would ache for days if he landed on it.
"My name is Sherlock," Sherlock said again. Their expression made it clear they thought John was a bit dim-witted.
“Yes, but you’ll be having a sub soon. Don’t you think it should be tidied up a bit? You want your first impression to be a good one.” Mrs Hudson frowned a bit with a thought. “You will be living here, won’t you, Sherlock?”
The bands were simple white gold and he had the date they met 29-1-2010 engraved on the inside. He thought maybe there was some clever line or something he should include but he hadn’t realized just how much he loved John until he was away and by then he was too late. He wasn’t going to include anything about second chances on the ring, though he was grateful for them.
John was humiliated. At first, the appointment was going well, he had to force himself away from the thoughts of all the ways he could take Sherlock’s virginity, and he’d even teased his Dom about his job. Plus, Sherlock didn’t put any pressure on him, moving into his flat would help with his expenses. And Sherlock had said there was a second room. If they decided not to have sex or if John found he needed space he had a place to go.
He had Sherlock help him into the bathroom. Sherlock left to get their first aid kit and John shifted anxiously. He and Sherlock hadn’t had any alone time since the case started. The last time they’d been naked together was when they’d watched porn together. John was hoping that the next time they were naked they’d progress to touching each other. He normally didn’t have a problem cleaning Sherlock’s injuries or having Sherlock clean his but now their relationship was different. John didn’t want Sherlock to see him weak or injured.
John lost his patience and used Sherlock’s distraction to rock forward and slam back. Sherlock gasped before deciding to let John set the pace. John’s hand went between his legs to stroke himself but Sherlock batted it away. He started moving counter to John so he was fucking John harder. John arched his back and bowed it, trying to find an angle where Sherlock was hitting his prostate. Sherlock tilted his own hips and John cried out.
John let out a deep breath and pushed Sherlock away. He ground his teeth and was able to force himself back onto the couch.
John decided to let him sleep. He might pay for it later, Sherlock wouldn’t need sleep again until the case was solved, but he might stay up anyway so at least this way he’d get some rest.
He gripped John’s hips hard, digging his fingers into the flesh. He spun John and gasped. He pulled John’s cheeks apart to get a better look.
Sherlock tried to rut against the air but all rocking his hips did was move the massager back and forth over his prostate.
But that didn’t matter. Nothing mattered. Sherlock was falling. He was speeding to the hard pavement. John knew Sherlock wouldn’t escape unscathed. Maybe,
Instead of moving along the inside of Sherlock’s thigh John dragged the pinwheel over Sherlock’s shin. Sherlock did nothing but groan as John moved over the thin skin.
In response Sherlock nuzzled down John’s neck, burying his nose under John’s collar where he hadn’t washed. He smelled, John, his scent strong under the clothes he was still wearing from yesterday.
Carefully, so he didn’t get any shampoo into John’s eyes, Sherlock washed John’s hair. He washed the space between John’s toes and he gently shaved John’s legs for him.
, Watson, but if you think I'll let you go down as the first man to set foot on Mars you're wrong," O'Murtagh said.
Since John looked rather crestfallen the counsellor said, “And now that you’re actually married? Does that change anything?”
he said and rolled onto his back. He lifted his arms up and stretched them over his head directly below the hook on the wall.
It took John a moment to process Sherlock’s lips against his own. He’d hoped for this outcome, but he hadn’t really believed it would happen.
“Anything! Everything, I don’t know. Just fuck me!” Already it was getting to be too much. He was overwhelmed.
She begs with her eyes for him to understand. Her hands clasped, white knuckles standing out in her lap.
“I don’t want an open marriage. I’m willing to try sexual things with you if that’s what you need.” It was hard to say that. It wasn’t that he was scared to have sex, per se. It was the same problem John had, really. He didn’t trust people. He didn’t want to open himself up, to ridicule, to pain, to rejection.
The first thing on that list will be looking up John H. Watson and finding out exactly what he was getting himself into.
Yep, I'm alive. Updates will be spotty, I'm trying to do about 5 million things at once. Haven't forgotten about this or anything else, I take down stories I abandon.
Fair warning, I don't know squat about sounding. I got all my information from these websites: https://www.lovehoney.com/bondage/cock-ball-toys/buyers-guide/what-is-urethral-sounding/   https://mrracy.com/urethral-sounding-guide/ and I hope I didn't write something terribly wrong. If I'm giving bad advice please tell me in the comments. If I can't re-write the bit then at least I'll leave a new note in the comments.
"You've gotten attached, haven't you? You know it's not human, right? As the medical officer, you should know better than to bring an alien life form onto the ship. Unless it's controlling you somehow." O'Murtagh's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Is that it? Has it contaminated you? Maybe after I dissect it I'll do the same to you."
“Couldn’t anyway,” Sherlock said. He’d tried it before, his legs always got in the way and he couldn’t get it in his arse properly if at all and if it were the other way he didn’t fancy breaking his nose against the headboard if John got too vigorous. The dido was small enough that it was a concern.
Sherlock heard the door shut and he waited for John to come up the stairs. When he didn’t he peeked his head out of the bedroom.
John must have come to the conclusion that Sherlock was a virgin and was upset about it. Sherlock was ashamed. He’d never felt the need to have sex, to trust someone with his person, to endure the messy swap of bodily fluids on the promise of endorphins. Planning a scene sounded boring and not worth his time. Masturbation worked quite well for him when he needed it. He knew that he was a freak, being a virgin in his thirties, but he hadn’t really cared. It wasn’t relevant to his work. On the few times he’d imagined having a sub he’d always thought the sub would either hate him or at best tolerate him. Never that they’d want to have sex with one another.
Mycroft had a box set on the coffee table, on top of it was a thick manila envelope and on top of that was a letter.
The man pointed it at Sherlock and suddenly there was a crack of a gunshot and the sound of broken glass and the man was bleeding onto Mrs Hudson’s carpet.
“Please, sir. Please punish me, hit me hard, make me feel it,” Sherlock said. The break gave him a breather and now he was starting to feel like he was floating.
“You use a cane while you walk but you don’t rely on it when you stand. It’s not impossible but unlikely you’d been shot twice, and you move your left arm stiffly. Your guest at the wedding had an RAMC tag, a nurse, and you were clearly the doctor on his team, you had captain’s insignia, being a sub it’s hard to gain such a high rank without some sort of additional training. So, you see? You were right.”
Oh, God! There was blood. So much blood. It was coming from his head. His head. Oh, God, that brain, that beautiful brain… John reached out; he could see the light fading from his friend’s eyes. John could save him, he just needed to get through.
Sherlock shuddered. John had marked him. He’d claimed him. He owned him. He found that incredibly arousing. John wanted him as much as he wanted John. He captured John’s lips again.
Taking that as a sign that he wanted more Sherlock removed his finger and lubed up the finger next to it. He pushed the two inside and John groaned.
John pressed himself closer to Sherlock, going so far as to tangle their legs together. It was a little awkward, with their height differences and John’s position, but they found a way to make it comfortable.
He didn’t use any teeth but did lick. Dragging his tongue down John’s shaft. Over one testicle then the other before moving back to John’s cock, sucking it through the fabric.
Sherlock rolled onto his side and decided to rest on his elbow, hand supporting his head. Now, where should his other hand go? He’d seen pictures of people with their leg bent up to expose their genitals. Was that too forward? He took the pose (he was seducing John, after all), but he angled his arm to cover his penis. It was best to be coy, he felt more comfortable and it’d be reasonable, him being a virgin and all. He didn’t cup his hand, he just let it rest on the sheets naturally. He didn’t want John to know he was nervous. He was a Dom, he needed to fill that role properly.
“Your little pet isn’t here. Told ‘im to wait on the street. It’s getting late, he shouldn’t have ta wait for too long.”
They made their way to the hospital lab and, god, Bart’s had changed everything. Could it be any clearer that he was old? Sleek computers, fancy digital equipment, things John had never seen.
The latex of the condom didn’t taste good and Sherlock closed his eyes so he could focus on the shape of the cock inside it. He worked his way down, wrapping his lips around his teeth as he added saliva so he’d slide. He only opened his eyes when pubic hair tickled his nose.
John, finished with Sherlock’s top half, nudged at Sherlock’s legs, directing Sherlock until he closed them. Then he climbed up and straddled Sherlock’s thighs. Too low to provide any stimulation to Sherlock’s cock but high enough that the pressure wasn’t uncomfortable.
“We haven’t heard from him,” Mycroft said. “But that’s expected. We won’t hear until the next phase is complete.”
Sherlock held in a whimper but felt his hips thrust against air. He tried to back into James, but the hand on his arse held him out so he couldn’t walk back. Was there some way to turn…?
John took the ring and slid it onto his own finger. He frowned when it stopped before the second knuckle.
Sherlock didn’t have a plan, but he was good at coming up with one in the moment. He didn’t have a play room, he hardly had any toys at all. He supposed he could take John out and get a basic set, at the very least... But, John was standing now, licking his lips and blushing. Sherlock could see how turned on he was. Which was nice, however, the important thing was that the cane was abandoned. If Sherlock suggested they go out it would break the mood and John would look for the aide.
She took a long sip of her drink and watched her aunt share a tearful story with a woman John didn’t recognize. John was trying to mentally get her to move on. He now wished he didn’t know the story.
Sherlock covered his awkwardness with an aloof mask and told John to come. But, it came out as annoyed. Which was… not good.
John didn’t know what he was looking at. It didn’t make sense. These were the health records of someone who’d been tortured but they had Sherlock’s name on. Lacerations, how many stitches it took to close each one, broken bones, bloodwork indicating malnutrition and—
He could go to Mycroft, his brother had to have a dossier on the man. He also didn’t believe that Mycroft hadn’t meddled in the matching either.
The people on the pavement behind him cursed and steeped around and John went into the shop. It was an antique dealer so many of the rings were for women. John looked in the cases and realized he was searching for a wedding ring. He wanted to marry Sherlock.
The images from John’s dreams flashed every time he closed his eyes. He tried not to move so he wouldn’t disturb Sherlock’s rest as he avoided sleep.
Sherlock shot him a glare before taking the head of his cock into his mouth. He wasn’t shy. He just hadn’t been expecting this. John was above average and James was well above average. When he’d been imagining this scenario he’d always pictured the men as average sized or below so he wouldn’t be disappointed.
Sherlock stopped in front of a nondescript door and took a breath. He double checked the suite number written on the wall and turned the knob.
John pulled out and Sherlock closed his eyes. He felt come splatter on his cheekbone and forehead. It ran down his face. Since none of it was near his eyes he opened them and looked at John.
The air next to Sherlock sang as John loosened up his arm, doing practice swings so as not to hurt Sherlock by accident. There was the dull thud of the crop against the bed and Sherlock moaned. He needed that. “Please, sir, hit me. Do it hard,” he begged.
There was a hand in his hair and his head was forced up. His back was forced into an arch and he groaned. His eyes watered and he opened them to see John again.
Sherlock huffed out his nose but stopped moving his hand. He worked his mouth down, removing fingers as he went until his nose was buried in John’s pubic hair again. He glared at John and hollowed his cheeks again.
Well, that hadn’t been John’s plan. But, it would work. He had to admit it was a better plan, seeing as how Sherlock didn’t expect anything in return if he were locked up. And John would be able to keep himself in check.
Jawn stopped and turned around. His thumb and forefinger were pinching the bridge of his nose. "Can you stop asking questions for a bit? I'm worried about my crew and I have a headache."
“John Watson, when we met you said that something had finally happened to you, that I was strangely likeable and that I was charming.”
"No!" Sherlock shouted and stopped the hit with one hand. He started bleeding from his arm and struggled over the pipe.
“Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,” were harder and Sherlock felt water gather at the corners of his eyes. He rutted against the sheet to move the butt plug and get some pleasure.
They didn’t work well together although their profiles had been a ninety percent match. Just because their sexual preferences matched didn’t mean their personalities did.
John shuddered and twelve strokes later buried his head in Sherlock’s neck. He came, stifling his cry with Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sometimes Sherlock forgot that John was so small. Each time he helped him up the stairs (which happened far too frequently for Sherlock’s liking), John’s arm wrapped around Sherlock’s shoulders and Sherlock’s arm around John’s waist, he was surprised at how short he was. John had the incredible ability to take the whole room or be invisible.
Sherlock felt the next spank hit lower, nearly the top of his thigh. It was even harder than the first two. “Three,” he groaned as his cock was pushed against the sheets with the force of John’s blow.
What was Sherlock playing at now? Pulling John on top of him and cuddling. Pressing his erection into John. No hint of embarrassment. In fact, he seemed to be taunting John, daring him to do something.
“And when I met you, I felt exactly the same. I needed an assistant and there you were, perfect for the job. But you were more than an assistant, you were my friend.”
“Right,” John said, irritated that Sherlock had gone off on another long dangerous mission and left him home. But, what could he do? He couldn’t very well go with him, not now that he had Rosie.
Sherlock snapped into high alert and followed John’s stare to the cab. John looked up to see Sherlock’s reaction. Sherlock’s eyes were narrowed and he was frowning. He released John’s hand and John knew they were in danger.
He snapped out of his daydream and saw that John was tense, his jaw set, his shoulders stiff and he was glancing suspiciously at a cab.
He’d make John pay for making him wait like this. He’d keep John on edge for hours, torturing him with pleasure until he was incoherent. Only then would Sherlock take the cage off and, if John didn’t come immediately, Sherlock would keep him on edge for another hour before letting him come.
“John,” Mycroft greeted, his voice taking on that same pinched sound it did whenever he was dealing with something unpleasant related to his brother.
Sherlock could see John’s hand hovering in his peripheral vision and he took it and put it on his head. It was what John wanted, he was just too polite to go for it. Sherlock wrapped his fingers around John’s and pulled a bit, showing John he liked his hair pulled.
There was the sound of John undoing his belt and Sherlock shifted eagerly. Not needing prompting Sherlock begged, “Sir, punish me, I need it. I’ve been bad. Let me prove how good I can be.”
“God,” John moaned. Sherlock pushed his feet as wide as they’d go in the restraint and angled his arse up, pushing into the bed and making a scene for John’s enjoyment.
Bees! Now, on the roof. And while he watched them John could be with him, taking care of the plants.
John went in for another kiss but Sherlock pulled away, gripping John’s thighs with his hands. He pulled on them. Spreading them. Then he dove for John’s crotch.
“Aaah—! John!” Sherlock squirmed, fighting with himself. He wanted to push back, to push John further in. But he remembered John’s movements when he was doing this and he really didn’t want to break John’s nose.
The profile painted an interesting picture. John was not a trusting person. The profile painted a picture of a man who was cautious. Perhaps he’d had his limits pushed or broken before.
Holding John’s eyes he licked up his finger before sticking it in his mouth, hollowing his cheeks and sucking with a moan.
John put on his coat and went down the stairs. John’s bed had been moved in front of the door so John had to go out the back door.
He knew Sherlock was excessively possessive of him and he might have been upset about that if it a) didn’t result in fantastic sex and b) John wasn’t equally as possessive of Sherlock. He felt like growling as Sherlock released John, rolling over and checking his phone.
Sherlock looked up. If he was mad that John had given him instructions he didn’t give any indication. He wrapped his large hand around John’s cock and worked it while saying,
John slid all the way in and Sherlock sighed. John was perfect. He slid out a bit and his cock dragged along Sherlock’s prostate.
“I heard him talking to the official, he doesn’t have anyone to give him away so they’re going to skip that bit,” Daddy said.
Sherlock laughed. “I’ll see what the client wants, you can see if you can find something in here that fits.” Sherlock knew he had something because he was guilty of stealing John’s clothing and stashing it in his room. Usually, it was for experiments but sometimes John threw clothes away that just needed some mending and Sherlock was happy to send it away with his laundry.
an understatement. Give me a moment." There was muffled shuffling and a bit of shouting on the end of the line before the American said in hushed tones, "What in the
Sherlock ignored his family, stopped in his dressing room to grab his coat, and swept out of the building, John following. Sherlock slowed his pace so John wouldn’t get left behind.
Sherlock bristled and opened his mouth. The counsellor sensed the coming words would be unkind so she jumped in. “And what do you do, John?”
Hands were on Sherlock’s legs and his arse was lifted. Sherlock’s sweaty back clung to the carpet as James held Sherlock’s hips and John lined up. Sherlock’s legs were too tired to do anything other than dangle on each side of John’s body. Bill held Sherlock’s wrists to prevent him from reaching for his cock and watched.
Sherlock ignored him and licked and sucked, relishing the taste and the thought that he was cleaning John up and he wouldn’t have to get up. There seemed to be an almost endless deposit of come and Sherlock’s jaw started to get sore again as he fucked John with his tongue, feeling John’s muscles clench and loosen as he writhed below him.
“Look,” John said, “I know your job is hard and that Sherlock isn’t that nice to you. And granted, he’s a little odd, but he’s sweet. I think you need to focus less on trying to get revenge for whatever he’s done and more on the crimes you’ve been assigned.” He stared pointedly at the unsolved pile on Lestrade’s desk. It was alarmingly large.
“I need a walk,” John announced. He couldn’t tell Sherlock he had an STI with all these people in the house and he really needed to get the thought that Mrs Hudson had heard their amorous activities out of his head.
Mycroft wished for the days where his biggest problem was whatever trouble Sherloc had gotten into. He decided the best approach would be to show up at his old offices in person. If he called they'd just try to leave him out of the loop until the crisis was over. If he was there they'd give him small tasks because they'd be short-handed. Then he'd be able to work his way into a position of control.
James came up next to Sherlock. He wanted to have Sherlock lie back and thrust into his mouth but Sherlock needed—no, that was nonsense, he
John couldn’t say more though. He didn’t want to admit that he never should have married Mary, that he loved Rosie but he was secretly glad she was in someone else’s care, that he’d considered not getting Sherlock—the love of his life—a Christmas present.
Sherlock thought. John wasn’t very receptive to commands outside the bedroom and he had a zero for danger and a positive score. They even tested him an additional time to see if he was a switch because of it. John, when in danger, wanted to give the commands, not obey them. Sherlock, with his scores, could make John obey him simply because he was more dominant.
“Please, John. Don’t be so pedestrian. This is better!” Sherlock’s whole face lit up. “There’s crime in the afterlife. Can you believe it?”
Sherlock liked it when John let Sherlock be in control but he wasn't opposed to him taking the lead either.
"Boring," they stated with a wave of their hand. "That's what they were using. That's why they were murdered. What is it?"
Sherlock had figured all those emotions out long after, while he was replaying the incidents in his mind palace. Cataloguing each expression for future reference.
“I consider myself married to my work. I’ve never had the urge to have sex so I haven’t bothered,” Sherlock said haughtily.
John gathered Sherlock’s hands and held them by the wrists above Sherlock’s head. Sherlock dug his heels into John’s back and John grunted as he increased the speed of his thrusts.
Sherlock licked at the seam of John’s lips and John groaned. He opened his mouth and wrapped a hand around Sherlock’s neck to pull him closer. His other hand grabbed Sherlock’s lapel and pulled.
“No,” Sherlock said imperiously and sauntered back to the bed. He leaned over unnecessarily, and John smiled at his cheek. After sliding between the sheets, Sherlock patted the space next to him.
Sherlock dearly hoped John didn’t have any family or friends that were Doms. If he did and Mummy found out they hadn’t come to his wedding she’d flay them.
He phoned Mike, thinking a pint was in order but he didn’t answer. He phoned Lestrade, who did and was happy to get drinks.
The counsellor got Sherlock to sit and she yammered at him while John recovered. He was grateful to her. He didn’t want those piercing eyes focused on him while he was feeling weak.
With it the thief's paths made sense. He was robbing houses around pokemon gyms. He could sit and case the places and no one would find it suspicious.
“Nine!” Sherlock had nearly forgotten about the spanking during John’s pause. “Ten, eleven, twe-lve!” Sherlock’s breath hitched as they landed right over the same spot. He was already feeling tender and John wasn’t even halfway done. He still had more instruments to go too.
Instead of bringing the feather down over the top of Sherlock’s thigh as was logical John went back along the side of Sherlock’s abdomen and returned to Sherlock’s nipple.
Sherlock glared at his brother. “I know that. I mean, why haven’t you stopped it. Why did you match me?”
Sherlock threw his head back as he tensed and knocked his head against the hard floor. He saw stars as he came.
There were a few relieved chuckles and after a few seconds of finding the rhythm again, Sherlock started floating.
Most of the people he knew were overseas but he thought his nurse, Murray, might be on leave. He had his email address. It wasn’t much notice but it was his best shot.
“I’m glad you did,” Sherlock said. He wanted to ask John all sorts of questions and he might have if he were still the same man he was when they first met. Now, he knew better. John didn’t want to talk about that time, about his discharge and Sherlock wasn’t going to force it.
John was feeling rather brilliant. Light feathery touches to one side of his body and sharp pain to the other. He never pressed hard, never drawing blood. But he knew it could hurt, like when John dragged the wheel over Sherlock’s bony ankle.
He lined up and slid into John slowly, holding John’s hips as he did, John fought his hold, trying to impale himself onto Sherlock’s cock quickly. Despite how loose John was and how he was bearing down, encouraging Sherlock’s progress, Sherlock was determined to take John at his own pace. He was also a little worried about hurting him.
John snorted. That was the exact reason he had never looked the man up. If he remained in London there was a chance, a slim, stupid, pathetic chance, that they’d run into each other. John was sure he’d recognise him even if he had changed his hair.
“Cheeky,” Sherlock said with a smirk. It seemed like John was more comfortable than Sherlock thought.
John’s brow furrowed when he looked at the date again. He’d thought Sherlock’s birthday was on the eighth. The woman had texted him then; they’d even celebrated it on that day the next year. Not that John had thrown a party - Sherlock hated parties - but he’d brought a cake and…
Finally, John made it to an airlock. He peeked through the window and the other door was shut. Praying he wasn't about to kill O'Murtagh in his hurry to save a stranger, John opened the door, pulled the being through and shut it. He activated the airlock and examined the person he'd found.
Sherlock reclaimed John’s mouth and John felt dizzy. He grabbed onto Sherlock’s bare back, trying hard not to claw it and not succeeding. God, he was a good kisser.
"Yeah, well that malfunction just took out a crew of seven. There's an Englishman on there you know! An Irishman too. We'll be lucky if any of them survive!"
“Sherlock,” John groaned. He kissed down Sherlock’s neck. When Sherlock groaned John bit down. Sherlock moaned and John sucked a mark there.
John rolled his eyes and pulled Sherlock into another kiss. It started getting heated and John pulled back so they wouldn’t have their first time on the foyer floor.
"No," John growled. He hadn’t told NASA about Sherlock, and he decided that he was right in that decision. Everyone would agree with O'Murtagh.
John ignored her for the moment and opened his door, intending to chase Mycroft down. All this talk about trusts and estates and funerals… it sounded like Sherlock was dead.
John came in, rushing up the stairs to find the door to their flat closed and locked. He dug through his pockets to find his keys, simultaneously annoyed and thankful. He hadn’t seen Mrs Hudson since the couch incident and he really didn’t want her walking in on them in flagrante delicto—though it wouldn’t be the worst thing she’d caught them at.
John wanted to tell him that he wasn’t in danger, that it was Sherlock, making himself the largest and most obvious target in the world, that was going to be killed. He couldn’t get the words out in time. The shot rang out and Sherlock fell from the rock, tumbling down and landing in a heap.
“Thanks,” he said, trying to keep the disappointment out of his tone. “And, as a wedding gift, can you just apologize to Clara and try to get through the divorce. Don’t let her antagonize you.” He added that last bit so it wouldn’t sound like he was taking Clara’s side. He knew his sister was the antagonist (most of the time).
Sherlock reached his hand back. He glanced at the date on the packet and realized he had no idea what the date was.
The puddles mixed before starting to sizzle and eat into the wood floor. The exact thing he hadn’t been able to accomplish for days and now he didn’t even know how he’d managed.
It was a little tricky getting back down with the spreader bar but Sherlock managed to land on his sore feet. He made a little breathy moan at the pleasurable pain. He tangled his fists in the sheets and closed his eyes. He really hated the cane. But this was a punishment so it had to include something he didn’t like. At least John had saved it for last and the least amount of strikes.
“I am, sir,” Sherlock said between pants. John required a response to each of his questions. It was a test, a reminder to use a colour if it got too much. Sherlock didn’t have to answer, exactly, just form some sort of word.
When the car stopped in front of the alteration shop John didn’t bother trying to hit on the woman again. He’d seen the ring on the Dom’s finger and he figured she belonged to him. He’d only tried in the first place because she wasn’t collared and he wanted to have penetrative sex one last time before he was married. Who knew after tomorrow if he’d ever get another chance.
He knew he’d made the right decision when John came back, scarf in hand. John stopped, staring with his mouth open.
His shout made his ears ring and he felt Sherlock’s prick stiffen against his own and the splatter of warms semen puddling with his own.
Sherlock tugged at his sleeves, trying to get them to sit properly under the suit jacket. He hadn’t gone out to buy a new suit for this. He figured John would either like him or he wouldn’t (more likely wouldn’t) and that he didn’t need to pretend to be something he wasn’t. It’s not like any illusion would last long anyway. He couldn’t change who he was, he’d tried and it didn’t work.
The thing was, it wasn’t just the sex. Sherlock was unique. He’d been ballsy enough to proposition group sex but had been scared when it had started. Something in John had melted when Sherlock had looked up at him with wide eyes as James had lined himself up.
So, Sherlock wasn’t surprised when Molly grabbed John on their way to the lab. Lestrade had blabbed and Molly probably thought Sherlock needed a moment to set up.
Inside was a smaller clear bag and inside that was a headband with Pikachu ears and a tail. Attached to the tail was a… butt plug.
Before John knew it he was being handed a glass of water. Sherlock told him to drink it and he started playing another song on his violin.
Sherlock had intended to give John the sheet and wrap him up, to tell him to run down and get Mrs Hudson’s sealed back up bottle. To use the stairs to help John with his leg. But John was leaning over Sherlock, and his hard cock bouncing in his face.
“Hm?” Sherlock came out of his thoughts to look at John. His face was hidden in shadow. Sherlock caught glimpses of his expression every time a car drove past.
Sherlock had scowled when the official and John said “William.” He’d told Mummy to tell the official to use Sherlock but obviously, Mummy hadn’t done so. Or maybe she had and there was some stupid useless rule that said it had to be his legal first name.
“London,” Sherlock said. He guessed that John had assumed that from the accent but he was happy John had asked -- he was smart enough to know that an accent could be faked.
“Jesus, fuck,” James said and he knelt down, stroking Sherlock’s spine with one hand and his flank with the other. He smeared the come into Sherlock’s skin.
him. His sub thought he’d done well. He’d brought his sub, his John, more pleasure than anyone before.
His eyes were wide and there was colour on his cheeks. There were the beginnings of a tent under that skimpy towel.
“He was in the military, he’s having trouble getting a job now that he’s been invalided out, probably because of his psychosomatic limp. He’s trained to… be a doctor? Yes, a surgeon. But the tremble in your dominant hand makes that impossible now. You were shot somewhere, arm? No, shoulder. And even though that tremble comes and goes it’s not entirely psychosomatic.”
John didn’t tease him though. He just gave Sherlock the smile he did when he felt sad about Sherlock’s past and kissed him on the forehead.
It was clear now: Sherlock holding him during the night made him feel trapped and brought back the memories.
“I can’t find my bloody key,” John said. He barely recognized Sherlock’s voice. It was rough, husky and much deeper than normal.
Sherlock answered John’s next question without him having to ask it. “I told Mike this morning I was looking for a flatmate. Now, here he is just after lunch with an old friend. Wasn’t that difficult of a leap. Unless…” Sherlock looked him up and down, “…you are looking for a flatmate, aren’t you?”
“James, it’s fine, he likes it,” John said. He was scowling at Bill but then he looked back down and smiled.
“Good boy. Good boy, Sherlock. Good boy. Who’s my good boy?” John dragged the pinwheel up the outside of Sherlock’s thigh and ran it down Sherlock’s hipbone.
“No, suspected only.” It was why he went to great lengths to keep them apart and only let them meet when John was present.
He’d seen the scars, the physical tokens from Sherlock’s trip to Serbia. He understood that Sherlock had been restrained, had been beaten before. So, he was surprised when Sherlock said he wanted John to dominate him.
“Oh, this isn’t my wedding ring. I saw it and it reminded me of this time.” John chuckled a bit. “Do you ever have that one memory that is just… that captures everything you love about someone?”
They sat in silence until the cab stopped. Sherlock got out first and John followed, slamming the door behind himself. He juggled his cane with the second apple and the apple core, finally shoving both the latter in his pocket with a grimace.
John pulled Sherlock to the floor and groped him before undoing Sherlock’s laces and taking off his shoes.
James stopped moving and held Sherlock’s hips in place with one hand, the other resting on his back. “Will you be missed if you don’t come back?” he asked Murray.
Sherlock’s back was aching and his abdominal muscles were cramping. Still, he kept his pace. John had to be getting close.
And the man couldn’t get more irritating. He was so graceful he seemed to glide as he walked and his long coat billowed out around those legs.
James wrestled him; hot, hard muscles slid, slick with sweat, against Sherlock’s wiry frame, until James had him pinned down, back against the cot.
John’s cock was getting harder so Sherlock sped all his movements, he rocked back and forward as fast as he could while kneeling on one hand. His hand blurred on his cock. He groaned, saying John’s name with a full mouth, humming for John’s pleasure.
Sherlock was still asleep when John came out of the shower so he decided to get the shopping done. If he could manage to escape without a list from Sherlock he could usually get what they actually needed instead of forgetting everything they needed to eat in favour for stuff that Sherlock would use to blow up the toaster.
The pressure around his cock lessened and Sherlock was able to move the two thrusts he needed to come deep in John’s body.
“Let it back in. Fuck your cock, Sherlock,” John said, uncaring that Sherlock wasn’t calling him ‘sir.’
When he stepped into the hallway he saw Mrs Hudson and she looked stricken. Sherlock could see when their eyes met that John had upset her but she didn’t blame him.
“Nn!” The nasally noise was involuntary and the only response John was capable of when Sherlock wrapped his lips around John’s glans.
This was happening, this was really happening. John felt blood go south and he lifted his hips but Sherlock was still kneeling and John found nothing but air.
“Sorry,” John said, and with a shake to clear his head he stood, walking to the door that connected to the loo, turning on the light on the way. “Are you all right?”
Then John took out the prostate massager and had Sherlock stand. He covered the device in lube and only gave Sherlock a minimum of preparation before sticking it in. John clicked it up to the third setting before making Sherlock sit back down.
