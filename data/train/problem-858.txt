We were now rendered respectable, or as near as could be without full knowledge of the disreputable harridan with whom we had thrown in our lot.
John’s useless hands came to rest lightly on each side of that bobbing, dark head, and he looked down and watched, drinking in the sight of swollen pink lips stretched wide around his aching cock. He resisted the urge to grip tight and fuck himself right down that throat.
“What are you doing now?” John whispered behind him.
He walks across to her desk, completely devoid of anything school-related and picks up his jacket and keys.
Mummy just sighed and opened all the windows “Oh dear Sherlock, those eggs we bought at the market yesterday must have gone off somehow, I must tell cook to get some more”
“More of the same I hope”
“Yes, it is and you must be Billy?”
“Yeah” said the bouncer nodding in agreement, “ Do as your girlfriend says now Sherly, piss off and stop wasting my time”.
He wrenched his hand back and marched across the room in search of another one of those delightful neon drinks and someone suitably annoying to insult, anything to take his mind off the painful twisting sensation in his gut.
“We have left no trace of indecent conduct,” I said, “we are fully clothed, but for the rings….”
I was quite happy to take her arm, she would be a delightful companion to sit by, and her knowledge of my family gave me comfort that my position in society had not yet been truly lost.
“I was hoping you’d say that…Sir”
“It doesn’t matter John” said Sherlock, because it honestly didn’t. John came back, and that was all he needed to know about John’s feelings. “So will we be platonic friends who share a bed or will I be banished to the living room sofa on my own?”
John looked shocked and I hastened to reassure there was no duplicity at play, “William is my given name, Sherlock comes after, and Mycroft has a second name of Sherringford”.
Sherlock closed his eyes and leant his head back against the padded seat, the rocking motion, and the gentle rattle of the wheels on the road soon lulling him to sleep.
“Enough…please!...just kill me right now, it’d be kinder”
A carriage turned into the street, the lamp at the front unlit. John ran at pace, raised his arm for it to draw to a halt, and he wrenched at the door, and bundled me inside before him where we both collapsed onto the padded green velvet cushions. I lay at a stretch across one side, taking heaving breaths of fuggy, smoky, tobacco scented air. John pressed his head back face raised up to the ceiling, his legs were splayed wide and his back had slouched low, arms resting atop his thighs. He sighed and closed his eyes, breath still heaving from our exertions.
He stood up and let the duvet slide of his shoulders to bunch up on the floor, leaving John eye level with his arse. What choice did he have but to stare, skin prickling with the sense memory of having his tongue up there half an hour ago.
“That. Was. A. Mistake.” He retorted icily, as he lifted his hands away and rocked back on his heels, stepping away to sit on the edge of the bed, putting a little more space between them, “One I can assure you I have no intention of repeating ever again”.
I should move from this place. I should go. It would be so easy to fall, to stay, to take up a pipe and breathe it into my lungs, to forget about Irene, and Mary and John. I could stay, find a rich man, for in this place they were plentiful and offer up my youth and beauty to his pleasure, forget my past, forget my home, give up my future to the unknown, and accept my fate. Whore. That is what you are. Forever and always, bought and sold.
It’s the same argument again and again. Sherlock hates this. They could break this fragile thing they have so easily.
The clinical stink of the hospital hit him, the second the automatic doors slid open, disinfectant, canteen food and sickness. Mycroft had texted the room number, second floor, room one, one, three, a private wing naturally, nothing but the best for a Holmes. Not that John resented it, whichever way Sherlock got the very best care was more than fine by him.
Mycroft disconnected and calmly examined a sheaf of papers on his desk as if he hadn’t just ordered what amounted to a massacre. Sherlock was appalled. This was so far beyond the brother that he knew and….loved? He shuddered at the thought that he, of all people would succumb to sentimental feelings regarding that fat, annoying oaf.
“Do keep off the brandy Sherlock” Mycroft called after him “Uncle Henry isn’t here to carry you to bed this time” everyone chuckled politely.
There was only just enough to fill two dishes, but he would go without. Mother needed it more than he did if she was to get well, her chest had grown much worse during this recent cold, damp spell. John had spent long hours pouring over the medical book that mother kept stuffed in a wooden chest upstairs, and a pneumonia was his best guess. She could die if he couldn’t raise the money for a doctor, but he couldn’t tell Harry that yet, she was worried enough about the unpaid rent.
His boss, the footage from the club, he could only mean Doug Miller the owner and the big guy must be one of his sons. He thought of Irene and if they had seen them talking tonight… was it her? had she told them what Sherlock had asked her about? …but she had seemed so sincere, that she liked Sherlock, even cared. John felt slightly sick as he thought about their little encounter tonight. She had been quick to spill the beans, when asked what she knew, risky in the middle of the club where she worked, and after his row with Sherlock had been a convenient shoulder to cry on, materialising from no-where at his side at the bar, the promise of free alcohol and a sympathetic ear. And he had gone with her, without question, let her lead him right out of the club to her private room, pouring drink after drink as he lost track of time…..
‘So?’ Mike shrugged, ‘Don’t jump to conclusions. Maybe they have enough actresses already? They’re always banging on about how students do it to pay their way through Uni, you know, lap dancing, stripping, escort work sometimes. Porn’s gone mainstream these days mate, there’s really no shame in it.’
It was cruel to push John’s buttons like that, but he had to say yes, he just had to. Sherlock needed this like air.
“I want you to fuck me now” he breathed hoarsely. John moaned and fisted a hand into his dark hair.
“On the lash? That council estate we went to this morning really rubbed off on you didn’t it?” he laughed. Sherlock pouted, pretending to be offended by the taunt, nipping at an earlobe just enough to hurt.
My mistress called for the maidservant, a stout and ruddy girl of no more than one and twenty to take my trunk to my new bedchamber already prepared to receive me, playing her part well in ensuring me that I was to be no common domestic drudge but a companion, both to herself and the honourable guests of her house. The exact terms of my employment such as they were, remained as yet unspecified, my mistress assuring me that I would discharge my duties admirably in due course after a little training up in the conversational arts.
to, because I
I did. Set up a narrow flight of stairs upon the uppermost floor, Tom’s room had been small, but fine for one bed and two lads to share. The girls had the floor below, four generous rooms and two closets.
“Yes, indeed” Mycroft gave a hollow laugh “What fascinating company my brother seems to keep…I do hope it won’t be necessary to move schools again…pity about the Watson boy, six whole days, he was doing so well”
“You’re such a fucking tease Sherlock” he raised his head a little to stare into Sherlock’s lust-blown eyes.
He wrenched the door open and headed out into the freezing cold night. This was what Sherlock had wanted him to work out, to finally realise. This was why he was tormented at school, skiving off and fighting, both with other kids and hi own parents. Stupid,
But Victor was not so easily cowed, he should have remembered that about him, did remember, how he could push through Sherlock’s walls, see through the act, laugh at his childish posturing.
The lights were out, pyjama pants and sleep-mussed hair suggested he and just knocked Victor out of bed, but he hadn’t been asleep for long, the lingering smell of brandy on his warm breath as they stood, just a little too close, just inside the living room, Sherlock’s back against the wall, still panting a little after his energetic burst up four flights of stairs.
sucking dick…is that really so difficult for you to comprehend?…no-one
“I get to keep you as my sex slave, do anything I want, tease you until you’re
“Yes, just do it”
Running the gauntlet of the Holmes family kitchen would be even more of a trial by fire, John thought, hoping to execute a quick smash and grab, bring something back up here and suffer the stench of smoke, anything to avoid Mycroft’s knowing smirk and penetrating gaze.
“I want you to…I want to try…it’s just…oh god, what if I’m shit at it Sherlock?”
He ran his hands down over his face in frustration but when he looked up to ask where this meeting place was, something he couldn’t bare to believe he didn’t already know, Billy had already gone.
Sherlock stifled a groan. Billy sticking his oar in wouldn’t appease John it would only serve to piss him off even more. This was not what he wanted from tonight, no more rows, he was done with all that.
After two more trips back to the bathroom to spew and half a bottle of Oral-B mouthwash, they were ready to go. Sherlock had piled on some extra layers, a soft fleece zip-up, a relic from a school camping trip (that thankfully didn’t irritate his itching skin), and black DM’s with thick socks instead of the ubiquitous thin canvas Converse. The shivering continued, regardless.
“What are you doing, you can’t get up” he whined like a petulant child and pulled the covers up over his head with a huff.
“Yeah?” John smirked, as he spiked up his hair in his fingers looking in the mirror on the dresser to perfect an effortlessly tousled appearance, “I dunno, I could probably take my pick from all those posh gits in designer suits”.
“Sherlock? Oh my goodness…just look at you! What on earth have you done!”
It was weirdly comforting.
He knew what the next words would be before they even left Victor’s lips.
“I want you to come inside me…I want to feel it” he said into their clasped hands.
There was a brief moment of smug satisfaction when Sherlock was rendered temporarily speechless, as John’s hand curled under his body and finally, finally, wrapped around his cock, already slick, working him in long slow pulls. Sherlock shivered and arched his back, cat-like, and John realised, too late that that had been his plan all along, the sneaky git!
To Be Continued……
The waistband wrenched down and his erection sprang free only to be engulfed in warm wet heat which made his hips buck reflexively. Mycroft decided to give up at this point, basking in the rippling sensations.
“Why did you leave?”
The early evening snowfall had quickly turned to slippery ice with coated the roads and pathways, making them truly treacherous. It was so damn cold, she thought, turning the heater up to full as she reduced her speed and turned the corner, left, towards town. You could die of exposure on a night like this, it happened every winter, there was always some local news story tucked away on one of the back pages, people walking home from nights out, sitting down for a rest and never getting up. She thought of Sherlock’s skinny frame, not enough fat there to provide any sort of insulation, the cold would cut through that boy like a knife through butter.
‘Oh indeed mistress, I should like it very much’ Tom replied pacing in circles around me so that he could take in each and every angle. I blushed under the intensity of his gaze, anxious that I would be found wanting in some way.
He grouched and grumbled down the stairs, practising his ‘fuck off’ face for whoever had dared to interrupt his epic Sunday sulk. He undid the latch and angrily wrenched open the door.
“I got you a date”, Sherlock said smiling mischievously, “Saturday at six…you’re meeting here. It’s my brother Mycroft you’ll like him, he’s a miserable git too, but I sort of owe you one after all that”
John stood by the door, back against the wall with a hand pressed tight to his ribs where Greg had hoofed him into next week.
“Especially if they already happened to be dead….come on John, time to crash your first crime scene…we have work to do”.
God Sherlock. What did I tell you? Six feet safe minimum distance maintained at all times and at least two impartial witnesses J
I did cry this time, twin tracks of hot salty liquid coursing down my face as I ran, blurred and blind down the stairs and into the passageway. I heard shouts at my back as I burst through the door, shrieks and screams of rage and frustration at the flight of the bird from its gilded cage. But I was much too fast, giddy on adrenaline and fear but oh so filled with joyful exuberance as I pounded across the cobbled street and leapt up into the carriage that I knew stood waiting for me.
“You still feel so tight….It’ll hurt too much”
He feels the pressure as the blood rushes south and fills his skull.
“Perhaps”, he smiled.
Blue eyes locked on icy grey….
Fuck.
If John wished to believe that they were here for the sake of Lestrade, then who was he to point of that they were actually here for a less than noble cause? John would be going back home to Mary in a couple of weeks, it was for the best, they all had agreed, so tonight was his last reckless night of drunken revelry before impending fatherhood turned on the brakes.
Oh god, he was actually going to a family dinner at Sherlock’s house, with Sherlock’s family, this wasn’t just a ‘thing’ any more was it?
Fifteen minutes and a taxi ride later he stood outside a run- down old pet shop in one of the less salubrious parts of town waiting for a contact from the not too distant past. Sherlock was not too proud to admit (at least to himself, if not to others – most importantly John) that from time to time he still needed this and if Mycroft, or any other of his close acquaintances (he was still loath to call them friends) had any suspicions, they never said (not that he would have stopped anyway – it was his life after all). This felt too exposed however, out on the street, however quiet it appeared to be, and Sherlock knew from bitter experience that one should assume that watchful eyes were everywhere. He stepped into the alleyway on his right, which still afforded a full view of the street as well as providing shelter from the increasingly icy breeze.
He let out the breath he’d been holding and sank to the floor, slumping forward, feeling sick and dizzy with relief.
Sherlock bristled at what he considered to be the grossest insult, but thankfully, to John’s relief, opted to take advantage of their newly won rapport and get to the crux of why they were really there.
“This is where it all started, well, most of it anyway”
“Jesus fuck Sherlock” he grunted, caught unawares by the sudden, violent switch, leaning back in for another kiss anyway, pulling Sherlock flush against him, his hard cock digging into Sherlock’s hip through the thin fabric of his pyjama pants. Who had the upper hand now, Sherlock wondered, and did he really care, as Victor’s warm hands pushed up under his clothes and traced over his chilled skin leaving a firey trail, thumbing circles around his nipples until they hardened to tight erect nubs, body responding despite the conflict in his head. He moaned so softly he wasn’t really sure he had, disgusted with himself but helplessly turned-on despite all the doubts as he let his hands drift down to cup the swell of Victor’s arse through his thin cotton pants.
“Yeah, I kind of got the impression that you liked it when you attacked me in the corridor straight after…you really are a bit of a kinky bastard aren’t you Sherlock?”
No, that was not how it was going to go, not this time, now it was John’s turn.
Ten cocks at parade rest, a rogue’s gallery of Scotland Yard’s (not so) private dicks. Sally was head judge and the winner would receive a Christmas kiss.
As if in answer, Sherlock gave his balls a tug, a silent but insistent ‘get on with it John’. The sucks and licks were uncoordinated now suffering greatly from lack of focus, because really, it was fucking hard to concentrate on giving head when the person you were giving it to also happened to be sucking you off. He must have been doing something right though as Sherlock went rigid for a moment and gave him a warning squeeze on the arse, but he didn’t let go, didn’t want to, not when they had taken this thing so far, but Christ, no-one had warned him just how much stuff there would be and the weird texture and mildly clinical taste of come. But hey, it was all good protein and it wouldn’t kill him, supposed to be good for the skin too, or did you have to rub it in for that, and shit, why the hell was he thinking about that anyway when his own cock was on the brink of off-loading into Sherlock’s mouth.
The danger night, once a regular occurrence, had made an unwelcome reappearance.
‘Good morning sweet prince’
“Come on but… it can’t be… not really?”
With a course of action fixed, I could not sit idle. I dressed myself in haste, washed quickly, ran a damp cloth over my face and neck, wiping sweat and grime and John from my body. I meant to set out for St James’ square with intent to take a carriage from the avenue. But as is the way with the dogs at your heels, Mrs Davis blocked my way upon the stair.
Nothing broken, a split lip, an initial assessment as he gingerly probed his face. He’d done this before, that much was clear.
Sherlock reached for the lube and squeezed some out onto his fingers. He cocked an eyebrow as John frowned at him, “What?”
“But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s ….like
“Hmmm” Sherlock chuckled low and soft as they lay face to face now, blinking lazily at each other in the brightening light, utterly wrecked and debauched.
John drifted into consciousness as a rough, wet tongue lapped eagerly at his face and a wet sticky nose pressed into his cheek and snuffled loudly. He forced his eyes open with a groan, Christ it fucking hurt, and curled on his side on the hard damp ground. Every muscle and bone protested as he gingerly tried to move, stretching out arms and legs, fingers and toes. Bloody hell he felt like one giant fucking bruise. He tried to sit up and his vision swam as a wave of dizziness and nausea washed over him.
“Of course I knew. I’m neither blind nor an idiot.” Sherlock said, and shrugged his shoulders and started to walk again. “Stealth is not your strong point John – you should work on that for next time.”
It was quite the speech, coming from Sherlock, the longest they had ever spoken on the subject of messy ‘feelings’ and John had a pretty good idea why he had chosen to say this now. Victor Trevor, the fly in the ointment. Sherlock making clear that whatever had gone on between them it had not been motivated by love. At least on Sherlock’s side. So what had it been? Just sex? John bit his lip and willed away the tight, sickly knot in his chest. Sherlock had made his intentions clear now, so maybe it was best to bury this. He should drop it now.
A thin trickle of blood ran down from his swollen mouth and Sherlock caught it and brushed it away.
….sir…it seems I owe you some belated congratulations”.
(An hour ago he was riding Sherlock’s cock in his head).
“Perhaps one element was a little alarming in some respects but bravo brother dear, it is still completely in character”
John barely registered Mary’s voice as he continued to stand and stare. He might even have drooled a bit too. Too-tight jeans outlined every inch of thigh and tousled curls jumped around wildly with every flick of his wrist. The bastard. Why the hell did he have to look so good… and fuckable too? And why had he agreed to come here tonight? His denims felt uncomfortably tight. Fucking fantastic….an inappropriate hard-on to add to his shame. This wasn’t helping, not one little bit.
“That” he rubbed his stomach and let out a loud, satisfied belch, “was fucking fantastic”
“You look like a man in need of a very stiff drink”
“Don’t be so dramatic John, it’s hardly Afghanistan”
He froze as he felt a sharp press of steel to his back.
They dressed quickly in the clean laundered clothes and stood feeling slightly awkward by the kitchen table, in a flat they had no right to be in. The sound of Mrs Hudson’s footsteps clattered up the stairs.
He coughed, nervously. ‘This aint no Molly-house lads’ he said, with an expression of real regret as he brought himself together and looked me in the eye, for we knew how things stood with him, ‘And people talk…namely, about those bonny young lads what are currently sharing a room that has only the one bed, which they are known to be currently sleeping in together and doing god knows what in…except I do know, he added, ‘having been there meself many moons ago’.
Finally.
He should have guessed. This was the boy who knew John had been tracking him on Oxford Street today without even turning around.
And then, as if to oblige my voyeuristic desires he sighed and stretched, rolling over onto his back as he did so, with an arm flung across his eyes to block out the light. He did not wake, chest rising and falling with the even measure of deep, contented sleep and so I was favoured with the full exposure of all his naked charms. It was a most perfect form. Such delicacy of complexion, such smoothness of skin, furred at the centre with soft blond curls the blushing peaks of two nipples poking above, erect from the night-cooled air. His limbs were so exact in shape and form, gently muscled arms to hold me tight, strong, firm thighs the power of which I had lately felt, the relentless delicious thrusting as he fucked me still fresh within my mind.
“Fuck that, you’ve been to the police station haven’t you?” her lack of protest was an answer in itself and John’s heart sank. Sherlock would never trust him again. He stormed down the hall and pulled on his parka and a thick, knitted scarf.
“What about him” bloke two said, looking Greg over while he stood there mouth gaping open like a fish. Three months he’d been here, ninety days since he’d knocked on the door begging for somewhere to sleep after he and his boyfriend had had a domestic and Greg had walked out with a bag of clothes and his wallet. No shags in all that time, he must be climbing the walls listening to Sherlock banging away nearly every night of the week, different faces drifting through the flat half-dressed almost on a daily basis.
John fought to suppress the disappointed whine at the back of his throat, while his cock bobbed in mid-air and continued to grow, until it lay, engorged and leaking now, flush against his abdomen. Sherlock pushed up from his crouched position and John reached out, a firm but insistent hand on his shoulder that spoke for him – don’t get up…not yet…please…
After a quick shower that predictably turned into more of a snog and grope than a wash and scrub (apparently inevitable following any period of time spent in close proximity, naked), John tiptoed back across the landing to the unused guest room for his clean things, ready to die of embarrassment should Mycroft appear. He was sure it was obvious they had fucked last night, and even more obvious what they had done this morning after the noise they had just made, but he could hope for a tactical avoidance, couldn’t he?
“Just stay there a sec” Sherlock wriggled out from beneath him and John collapsed onto the mattress, sprawled on his back until Sherlock pushed him over onto his side. It took a few moments to register that the crazy idiot had flipped around to bring them lying head to toe, well, more like head to…another sort of head. He had never seen someone else’s cock this close, long and dusky pink, a sticky bead of fluid gathered at the slit, bobbing tantalisingly right in front of his face, just begging for John to reach out with his tongue and taste.
“You’re right, it is none of your business” was the only response he got as Sherlock turned his head away to look out of the window, his own ghostly face stared back at him as he brushed angrily at one hot, stray tear that could’ve been mistaken for a bead of condensation running down the glass, at least he hoped that was what Greg thought.
“Sara don’t….just stop….Mike…mate…” ( John wanted the earth to open up and swallow him whole)
Sherlock let out the breath he had been holding. Charlotte emitted an alarming squeak and clapped her hands together eagerly like a seal, her tits bouncing far too near John’s face, like an invitation.
“You have a concussion you knob, and we can’t have sex in your hospital room…Mycroft and Greg are outside and the doctor’s coming back to check on you in a bit”.
him! He would not have left me otherwise, and you knew that!”
“Like this”
Huh, if you could call pizza and beer that.
To myself, he made light as did my mistress, speaking in praise of this worthy cousin and extoling the virtues of his wealth and rank and that if I be a good boy and please him he could make my fortune bestowing many gifts and favours should I play my part to his satisfaction. But nothing could be more abhorrent to me and I could not hide my aversion from their keen eyes, giving them little hope that the matter would be concluded with success.
“Yeah…just on holiday…The Cotswold’s” he mumbled, pulling out his earplugs , hoping upon hope she was here by herself and not with him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Yes, marvellous, a week of Mycroft scrutinising his every move, such as casual enquiries as to whether Sherlock had a girlfriend yet and what on earth was he doing with a mini-fridge in his bedroom packed with petri-dishes full of fungal spores. Of course he would also complain constantly of the sheer tedium of his daily existence, and moan about his weight while sneaking seconds of sherry trifle when he thought that everyone else had gone to bed.
John opened his mouth to protest.
The paper crumpled in his hand and he threw it into the empty grate where it lay and unfurled again.
“The gentleman on our left”, John muttered from the side of his mouth and discreetly motioned, “Sitting by the brewery wagon, why does he stare, do you think ?” I squinted to where John had indicated, my eyes adjusting slowly to the light, to where an old gentleman peered at us in open curiosity, and something else, a tension as he fumbled in his pockets, cast his eyes down then back up at us warily.
One team remained, the thick-set crew member consulting with a beleaguered looking paramedic. The fireman clasped a hand to his shoulder and paramedic nodded his head, then walked briskly back to the ambulance to have a hurried conversation with the rest of his team.
The house was a wreck, the roof none existent, only a few blackened beams remaining. The upstairs windows had blown out completely leaving dark gaping maws of jagged glass and charred black brick. Downstairs the windows remained intact and the front door was broken and twisted beyond saving where the fire crew battered it down to gain access once the fire had been brought under control.
John choked on a mouthful of tea.
“No you’re fucking not” John pokes him in the ribs and makes them both laugh.
“God, yeah, this water is fucking cold now isn’t it?” said John, misinterpreting, as he scrubbed his own hair vigorously gave a cursory once over to the important bits and reached over to turn off the spray.
‘Please, I must impress upon you Sherlock you must not call me sir. It is John, and John only, Watson if you insist, but from this moment on we go forth as friends’, he gave pause and smiled at that final word so playful as his mind turned to that which we had so recently shared. I could not help but return it with a smile of my own. ‘And equals also’, he concluded with a determined nod.
“I just fucked up , I was never unhappy”
He trailed off and huffed in disgust, the door bursting open again to reveal his brother and a doctor, a different one this time and the same nervous little student nurse. Mycroft rolled his eyes at them both, and John patted his hair down guiltily, still mussed and sticking up where Sherlock’s hands had been tangled in it minutes ago. The erection was gone though, thank god.
Maybe he should make the effort and go tonight, he’d done nothing but moon around the flat all week in between classes and his best mates’ patience had obviously worn thin. He shoved the pillows off his head and sat up with a groan, his body still stiff and sore. The bruises on his ribs had mostly turned a sickly green, but he didn’t need the painkillers anymore. Popping pills just made him think of Sherlock, abusing his body again. John hated that hazy feeling, like cotton wool in your head, and that idiot did it for fun? Living with a parent hooked on tranquilisers and an alcoholic sister kind of kicked any sort of urge to experiment right up the proverbial arse.
“I deserve it John, you know I do”
Victor shrugged, a little ruffled, pupils blown and half-hard now, not really caring that the question was largely rhetorical, “Hey, you could always have a piece of this fine ass, you know the offer’s always there”.
“Fucking Glen again?” Marcus huffed in annoyance, letting a large gym bag drop from his shoulder onto the kitchen floor with a thud.
“What? No!” John looked genuinely offended that Sherlock would think that.
John bid me make haste, we must go now before the house finally woke and we were discovered, ‘for if I leave this place without you now I fear you will be lost to me forever’. So I kissed him once swiftly and rose, leaving him to catch up the discarded remnants of his clothes as I made my way as silently as before to the bedroom, pulling on breeches and shirt, stockings and shoes trying desperately to avoid every squeak of floorboard and rustle of material and all the while keeping one ear cocked for signs of life. My possessions were few, just the battered trunk I had arrived with and the small leather purse with the remainder of my inheritance, hidden by Tom on my arrival lest Mrs Turner claim this also as her due. The board beneath the bed lifted with ease and I drew it out with a sigh and looking up, my heart leapt in my chest as I saw Tom’s eyes, open and fixed upon me. I froze.
He stepped forward and caught Sherlock around the waist, thumbing lightly over the silky material of his shirt.
It was John’s turn to lean, propped upright with one fist in his mouth to stifle his cries and the other fisted tightly in Sherlock’s dark curls, a mixture of comfort and pain. John’s cock felt hot and heavy under his tongue as he licked the first long stripe from base to tip, tasting the velvety skin, not caring where John’s cock had just been. He sipped at the head and his lips suckled gently, Sherlock’s own special lollipop, salty and bitter as sin.
this sort of thing. Not ever. The risk of injury was much too high. The list of activities he was forbidden to engage in had grown ever longer with each passing year he’d danced. Horse-riding, ice-skating, roller-blading, skateboards, were all categorically banned. But somehow, his desire to impress had led to this completely reckless decision. All for a ride home with the best looking boy in school.
“Oh God…I am
Back in the gym the slow dance starts and couples take to the floor. Mary sways in the centre, wrapped in the arms of the six foot goalie, Bill something-or other, the one that always teases John about being such a short-arse. They pass under the mistletoe and she giggles when he sticks his tongue in her ear.
Three hours, a shower, two cups of tea and a slice of toast later, Sherlock crept across the silent school grounds. He’d wriggled out of the lift to Uni, claiming he had to go back to his digs for books and clothes, which wasn’t too far from the truth as it happened. Most of the school would be in the mess hall eating breakfast dressing for classes, or if you were Victor Trevor, still in bed with the covers pulled over his head. Sherlock could see him through the window, still open just as he had promised thank god. Sherlock would be eternally grateful they’d managed to bag a room on the ground floor this year, he’d had two sprained ankles last term, from falling off window ledges pissed in the dark. Pulling all-nighter’s was Sherlock’s speciality.
“Fuck off”
“Well you do realise he had a skinfull last night and I’m definitely not talking about one too many drinks”
“Yeah…well…look Sherlock…you don’t have to…say no if you want, but….can I kiss you? You see, I’ve just spent the entire night thinking about your mouth…”
“I am dying for a cigarette though, and before you say another damn word, it’s my fucking room and I think I just earned it for that quite spectacular performance, don’t you?”
‘Are you hurt?’, I asked, my amusement masking any concern I may have felt. I tried to supress my laughter as he scrabbled for purchase and sought not to place his hand on a most intimate part of my anatomy, and my thighs parted half on instinct and half in sympathy at his plight. His head was buried in the crook of my arm, so I placed my hands upon his shoulders to aid him, pressing back to help him rise. But oh, that devious young libertine, instead of rising he used his weight to turn my body, grasping the tops of my arms to push me down until I lay along the full length of the seat. I should have been scared to be trapped this way, even more so when he planted a knee either side of my body and straddled across, arse planted square upon my thighs, but instead my whole body shuddered in anticipation, still and pliant. His weight held me pinned , but any desire to move evaporated when he untucked my shirt and ran his hands from my stomach up to my chest. His palms felt searingly hot as they trailed along my skin, heated and tingling until they wound a teasing path around each nipple. I made the most embarrassing of noises, torn from deep within my throat, wild and needy as he continued to pinch and roll. I arched into his touch, my head thrown back exposing the length of my neck. He took this as invitation, which I confess in my heightened state it was and he kissed at the pounding pulse beneath my skin, feeling out the beat of my heart against his tongue. The glorious sensation that he coaxed from the tortured nubs of flesh sent forth phantom, feather-like tremors of pleasure along to the head of my cock as if they shared some mysterious connection. My hips moved of their own accord, canting up helplessly against the weight of him still heavy upon my thighs, but indeed, you must believe me when I say I was driven to it by a desire too impetuous to resist, for I confess, I could not help it.
Mabel nodded sadly, “I think we might finally be getting somewhere….I think you might have already guessed where we’re going next”
“What?”
“You have been cozened by a whore…you will cast him off this minute or I swear that you will never see another penny of my money…you will be dead to me, ridiculed and scorned, denounced by all who know you as a whoremonger and sodomite…and if that is your choice then go…I will here no more of it …you sicken me…you and he both”.
Sherlock’s eyes were incandescent, brain firing on all cylinders now, pulling John along in his wake.
“Your heart”, he went on, “is currently beating at almost double its resting rate, your perspiration levels have undergone a significant increase in the last minute or two and most importantly, I can feel the distinct outline of your semi-erect penis against my thigh. If you weren’t at least marginally interested your body wouldn’t be responding like this and you would have left ages ago….but you’re still here…now what does that tell you?”
Bed…a bed would be good he thought, as his limbs turned to lead, suddenly so heavy and tired. Soft pillows, cool sheets, a warm naked body and…freezing cold feet. Cold feet. John. His bed. Pressing over him. Inside him.
Oh god, he had to ask.
You couldn’t be a successful junkie without becoming something of an expert in the art of deceit.
Sherlock stood ready at his side to hand out the gifts to the ‘lucky’ girls and boys and John tried desperately not to think that his bloody crotch was just about level with John’s eye-line.
She really is rather good at this, Sherlock thinks, it could provide a very lucrative career path for an independent-minded girl like Irene.
“ My point? Nothing really, except pointing out what a massive slutty man-whore you are. Is there anyone left in London you haven’t slept with yet Sherlock?”
“Motorbike?”
Sherlock looked adorably wide-eyed for a second, but shook his head, seeming almost shy again. It confused John, this juxtaposition of the brashly arrogant and the bashful and uncertain. What was his deal? Everyone had a deal. But John couldn’t figure Sherlock out.
I shook my head, “I think you are mistaken, had he touched your arm for much longer then I fear I would have cause to break it , he annoyed me so”.
“He’s like that anyway…that’s just Mycroft”
He flashed John an innocent smile before turning around and flouncing out, the little silver bell on the top of his hat jingling madly as he went.
It was almost better than sex.
“Okay, can I do this one please?” Sherlock looked up. Harry, when the hell had she come in? John shot her a desperate look and shook his head. Shit, she was going to make him do something dangerous, like playing chicken on the road outside or climbing out onto the roof. He had done both of those before reality kicked in and they realised one of them could be seriously hurt.
“We are about to make our imminent and daring escape”
“Yes, well the only flavour Mycroft’s sex life comes in is boring Vanilla” Sherlock laughed despite himself.
“You can save your explanations for now young man, let’s just get you two sorted out first shall we? I’ve had the night storage on so there should be plenty of hot water for showers if you don’t dilly dally and I popped some shampoo and whatnot on the side of the bathtub if you need it. Sorry I can’t stretch to toothbrushes, but there’s toothpaste and you can use your finger – I hadn’t expected company, you see”.
“You need somewhere to stay for the night? I know a place, I’ll take you there if you like, but it’s no five star accommodation”
“There were others, and it made him a little….
“Don’t be.” Sherlock spun around to face him, and John caught the brief flash of anger before it switched to cool indifference again. “Mother doesn’t give a fig. She’s always hated the place.”
“John, please understand my concerns, the last such attatchment that Sherlock formed ended rather…
John smirked. Nothing took your mind off your own romantic troubles faster than ripping the piss out of your similarly unfortunate friend. (Although romantic didn’t really apply when it came to Sherlock, did it?)
need to escape from?” John asked, sprawling out a little more, head propped up against his hand.
“Ah, right….and what happened to ‘not your fucking counsellor’?”, because it had to be said, and it still stung, the arrogant bastard.
He looked up at the sound of a young, gruff voice. Graham, or Greg or something, wasn’t it? He was in his final year at John’s school, a football player, had aspirations to join the police force (would be a reasonably intelligent addition – should do well), but not averse to bending the rules or turning a blind eye from time to time. Sherlock lifted his chin and gave Greg a brief nod of affirmation. Not a rapist or a serial killer, then.
“Ah the rules…and what happens if I want to…
“You said that ten minutes ago, and you still aren’t done, come on John, you look fucking gorgeous to me, in fact, if we don’t leave right now I’m going to start undressing you again” Sherlock whined, as his hands snaked forward with malicious intent. He grasped the front of John’s belt, the loop sliding between long pale fingers.
The hours would drag until he would see him again tonight, every minute without John seemed unbearably long and tedious, the very air denser, more difficult to move through, to breathe, and he deserved to suffocate like this, fall victim to his own unforgiveable selfishness, because John was good, and deserved better than he could ever give him, and he was bad, evil, putrid flesh on worthless bones.
“You can tell as soon as you look at me, whether it’s a lie or the truth, I know you Sherlock, the only one that’s lying is you… to yourself….I have time, think it over, I know it’s a lot to take in….. but you know we could be good together”
He positioned Sherlock face first against the wall and his cock gave a desperate throb, trapped beneath the confines of tight jeans. He braced his hands, shoulder height and turned his head to the side, pressing his cheek against the wall. It was smooth here, covered by layer upon layer of whitewash, the rough surface smoothed down over time. John pressed in close behind him and nudged his legs further out to the sides.
“Does he indeed”, I snapped imperiously and felt a little ashamed at the wounded expression that crossed her sweet face. More softly I continued. “And he couldn’t tell me this himself…why may I ask?”
Sherlock turned to look at him, poised in the act of pulling on his jeans, “You mean…like, a date?” he asked uncertain, thinking this might just be about the sex.
“I should…but no…no I don’t…get up”
“Begging your pardon young sirs” she had said, and my eyes shot wide as she bobbed a quick curtsy and scuttled back out of the room again as fast as she could go, whilst I lay in a state of extreme mortification and growing arousal at the proud erect cock pressing at the crease of my thigh. Later that day she had ventured to return and pleaded her assurances that our secret would be most safe with her, for she cared not a jot how we chose to spend our nights together and had seen much worse from the other residents.
“I don’t understand”.
“In the end, are you really so obvious Sherlock? Thank you for confirming what I already know”
Whatever had Sherlock done without him? This was amazing!
Shit. Should he cross the street, turn back, or just keep on straight? John hovered on the edge of indecision, instinct screaming at him to run, a nagging voice in the back of his head that had followed him across town from the club. He let out a sharp breath as the drivers’ door opened and a man jumped out, white overalls almost glowing in the dark, just a builder or plasterer, most likely and not a shady member of the criminal underclass after all. He crossed to an all-night café and didn’t even turn his head.
“That’s not all though mate, they were shooting their mouths off, claiming that they saw you and Sherlock out there, by the storage sheds, and right before their eyes you morphed into a couple of fucking birds….can you believe that? I almost pissed myself I laughed so hard…you, an Animagus?...fucking morons”
“Thank you Mrs Turner, I’ll be right down”
“Sherlock hails from the country too”, John said, in an attempt to draw me in and deflect her attention away from him, for he knew me too well, insecurity the weakness I had failed to cast off in our time together despite the attentions he gave.
The ‘hurt my brother and I’ll kill you routine’, how utterly predictable, Sherlock thought. He would try, for John though, even if a meant an Oscar worthy performance. He drank some more.
, John thought as the mountain of a man that Moriarty had sicced on him kicked his left kidney.
Sherlock scooped up some of the bath in his hands and lifted it above the waterline, letting it trickle through his fingers and back into the tub. He supposed John’s denial was not unlike his own denial of himself as a sexual being. He sighed, readjusting his head on the towel and staring at the ceiling.
been a pawn—she had always felt so ordinary, had spent her whole life, it seemed, slowly making it square by square across the years. But now she had reached the other side, and she had been queened.
he was kissing me.
But his moment of rage subsiding, Sherlock swallowed and began to formulate a plan; if John couldn’t get past his feelings, there was only one thing to do. “Of course I feel something,” he said, finally, barely louder than the running shower. He steeled his nerves and looked into John’s eyes. “Of course I do.”
Sherlock whipped around and faced John, who was now thoroughly uncomfortable. “You remember where the computer lab is located, yes?”
Sherlock’s stomach dropped at the words, even though he’d known, coming in, that that would be his brother’s answer.
“Is that true?” Ella prompted.
I might come back to this one later, but this was where I originally planned on ending it so I've marked it complete for now. Thanks for reading :)
“I’m not a dad.”
“Don’t be an idiot,” I told him. Of course I still loved him. Why would he think I wouldn’t? Just because I was uncomfortable, and confused, and had never loved anyone before.... John’s mouth settled into a thin line, which is how he looked when he didn’t know if I was being rude or fond. “Of course I still love you,” I clarified, with more determination than I felt.
“I’m going to fuck you, immediately,” I told him.
Anna scowled and muttered something under her breath, something that most definitely included the word “wanker.”
I pulled on him again and tried to stop thinking. He gripped my shoulder and squared his hips. “God,” he gasped, and looked at me. His eyes were dark, his eyelids heavy, and his lips were flushed, his cheeks, his neck. “You.”
“Look,” Lestrade continued, “at this point the only thing your statement could help with is soliciting sympathy from the jury. You know, make them want to kill the bastard as much as I did. But my lawyer can do that perfectly well by himself, if he’s halfway decent. There’s enough circumstantial evidence to get anyone with a heart on my side. And like I said… how I finally come out of this is not nearly as important as how
Mycroft had laughed. “You’ve used that one before, little brother. And it didn’t work that time, either.”
John made a move to sit down and almost stumbled. He was very tired and had lost some of his sense of balance. He sat down and leaned over until his elbow rested on the floor, then his shoulder. The fire’s heat licked his knees and his forehead with its sharp tongue.
Molly twisted her lips again. “Yes, I know.”
The standing guard spoke into his radio. Then he spoke again. “It’s fucking busted,” he complained. “These sodding things. Don’t ever fucking work.”
she was going to go out of earshot when Sherlock and John were having a domestic.
heads a moment ago.
“The ultimate expression of human closeness is sex,” she told them. “Even someone who has never had sex,” she gestured toward Sherlock, “has an instinctual knowledge of this. And for someone who is as… out-of-touch with their own emotions as you, Mr. Holmes, sexual pleasure has become the only way you’ve found to express your feelings—and you found it the moment John kissed you. You love John, you fear for him, you would be lost without him. But these are things you don’t know how to say, or maybe feel like you can’t, because you’ve built this persona for yourself where it’s not acceptable for you to have a normal human feeling, or any at all. Even John Watson, the object of your love and affection, thinks you aren’t capable of these feelings.”
Anna rolled her eyes and put her hands on her hips. “All of it, of course. I
Moriarty turned back to Anna, who had slumped in the arms of the guards. Tears were falling from her eyes as she looked at the bodies of her three band mates, realizing that
me!” Sherlock challenged. “Make me understand!”
First, Sherlock refused to sit down and eat dinner with them because he said he was “not hungry this week”—which got him close to a boxed ear from the lady of the house, who hotly told him that they ate dinner as a family, and when Sherlock was in
John smiled again, a little sadly. “You can’t.”
“This was a mistake,” I said, completely ignoring his advice.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows.
“That—oh—that you love me.”
I snorted, to prove I wasn't flustered by his (rare) correct observation. “Are you a psychologist, in addition to a surgeon? When did this happen?”
But now, he had no choice.
,” she whispered. Her eyes spilled over again.
“I’m not lying!” I lied, in a way that no one would ever believe in a million years.
“Are you wearing jeans?” John asked, flabbergasted.
“Be where?” John set the cups and food on the table. “Do we have a case?”
“Well, besides solving crimes, you know,” John retorted, reddening with embarrassment.
“You know…” Anna cleared her throat. “That you two were still in love.”
She smiled, and got out of the car.
“Oh!” Mary let out a relieved breath. “Only a week, then?”
“Sherlock doesn’t have standard human emotions,” John spoke up. “It’s not his fault, it’s just the way he’s wired. He doesn’t react to things, like death, the same way that most people do.”
In response, Sherlock grasped John’s hair at the base of his neck and tugged, forcing his head up so that Sherlock could drive his tongue into John’s mouth. His other hand snuck its way to the small of John’s back, pulling his lower body flush with his own. Then, he reached down and used both hands to undo John’s belt buckle. “Fuck,” swore John, shocked at how quickly they were moving.
He was surprised and pleased to find that, while sex was a large component of love according to
“Ok-kay,” said Sherlock, bobbing slightly in the water as he kicked his legs to stay afloat.
Sherlock laughed bitterly. “My brother has no sense of morality when it comes to catching enemies of his country. Knowing him, he’d use Anna as bait. No, Mycroft is the last person who should get involved in this.” He sighed. “But you’re right, Molly… Anna needs a place to go if something should happen to me. And I should be much obliged—no—honored, if that place would be with you.”
I was lounging on the sofa and he was standing in front of the doorway, swinging his umbrella back and forth on his wrist. I frowned at him from over my laptop screen. “That’s not what I said.”
As soon as she was gone, Sherlock went to his chair and collapsed in it.
, Sherlock. My whole
. I’ll be suspended!”
“That wasn’t your decision to make! She’s
you miss me, all week. The private jokes, the old, annoying habits… I mean, John, I stopped leaving my clothes outside the loo ages ago!”
John kissed him with renewed vigor and Sherlock reciprocated in kind. Their hands had got involved and were sliding and pressing and grasping places that were rapidly escalating the situation. That was how John found his shirt unbuttoned and his hands up Sherlock’s vest under his jumper on his bare skin. Sherlock ducked and John brought both articles of clothing over his head and Sherlock’s torso was exposed. Sherlock reached inside John’s shirt and folded it off both shoulders and away and then he was tugging John down to the blankets that were still on the ground in front of the fire. The fire crackled as Sherlock pulled John on top of him so that John was able to press his weight onto parts of Sherlock’s body that he hadn’t been able to adequately while standing. Sherlock inhaled sharply and John pressed again and ground down and this he had been sure would have put him off going any further in real life, to feel another man’s cock against his own. But it didn’t and he did it again and again and Sherlock’s hips canted upward to meet his downward stroke. John kissed him hard and with his tongue all the way into Sherlock’s mouth so that there was no space between their lips and they breathed together. John felt the familiar heaviness in his groin, which turned into tightness and acute pleasure with each repetitive movement. The sound of their breathing was so close together that John thought it was almost deafening until he heard Sherlock whimper, and then that was even louder. “Oh,” breathed John, because he’d never imagined Sherlock would sound quite like that and it was better than he had thought.
John looked toward the sound and there was Sherlock, awake and dressed in his original clothes. The green down coat and the sturdy snow boots. John could just make out the ends of his dark curls poking out from the stocking cap. He was standing about the same spot where John had first noticed him when he was chopping wood, and his mouth was turned up on one side in a smile. The snow started to fall.
you do something like that? What would make it justifiable, to you?”
,” or he might have just grimaced and remained silent while John got his fill of human contact. But, in that moment, he instead lifted his arm and rested his palm along the center of John’s back.
It seemed like I came forever, the longest orgasm of all time, probably. It was probably unhealthy, how much I came. I came until I couldn’t even hold myself up anymore, and collapsed on top of him, my cock going soft inside him. I could feel his heart beating like a hummingbird’s, hard and fast through his chest. And then he rutted against my stomach, and I realized, he still hadn’t got off.
He nodded. “Then let’s begin.”
“So what are we going to do about Anna?” John finally asked, turning around. His demeanor had grown very cold. “We going to share her, switch off weekends? She’s a child of divorce, now, is she?”
“You coming along to the cemetery, too?”
Anna crawled out of the duct, making a face as she climbed over the guard that she had killed. She glanced down at his nametag—
“You did change clothes, though,” Sherlock remarked. “Should have had a hot bath, like me.”
That night, after the rest of his family had gone to bed, Sherlock had snuck out of his room and poured over all the dictionaries and encyclopedias, learning everything he could about the word “sex.” His parents had had nothing to do with it.
“Let me,” John whispered. “It’s okay, let me.” He reached down and smoothed his hand over Sherlock, and Sherlock closed his eyes. “Shhh,” said John, stroking him. “I’ve got you.”
“Nevermind that.” He waved his hand in the air. He was really bloody stoic now, completely ignoring my attempts to get him off track. “Tell me about her. Or him.”
Sherlock just stared at him, trying to figure out how to handle the situation.
“You know,” Sherlock said to her, “you really shouldn’t take candy from strangers. Haven’t your parents ever told you that?”
, she thought. But the butterflies were stifled when she heard the tone of Sherlock’s voice on the other end.
Sherlock sighed and sat up in his chair.
I felt the warmth of his fingers through my sleeve. An intrusion of my own bodily temperature. It felt foreign and welcome at the same time. Part of me wanted to grab his face and kiss him. To give in, and let everything else go to shit. But I couldn’t do that. If I didn’t stop this now, I wouldn’t be able to go back. I would never get the Work back, again.
Sherlock set his tea on the coffee table and carefully lay down on the sofa, and John lifted the blanket from the back of his old chair to spread it over him. “Let me get your shoes,” he said, and knelt down.
I was starting to see animal shapes in the apple sediment. “I’ve never been in love,” I admitted, with reluctance. Why was I suddenly so ashamed of it? I’d never been ashamed of it before. In fact, it had been a point of pride. I didn’t go in for that sort of thing; it was beneath me. Love was only for weaker, sentimental beings. Not me. Never me.
And afterwards, John had ordered take-away from three different restaurants that he’d missed and had dusted off some of old vinyl records that Sherlock had stockpiled long ago for some case or another, and they’d listened to music lying on their backs in the middle of the sitting room.
deviant there, if that’s where you’d stopped,” he continued, coldly. “But you both have a special fetish: to kidnap, rape, and (I suspect)
Sherlock’s hands fell down into his lap. “That was before.”
He flew into the kitchen table. It screeched on the floor and there was a crash of glass as a few leftover test tubes from my last experiment fell off and shattered. He caught himself of the edge and looked at me, his eyes wide with surprise. I came toward him again and grabbed his coat to stand him up, and before he could react I spun and threw him to the door. He tripped and fell, then scrambled to stand again, looking at me in awe. And I realized, that though he’d hit me plenty of times, in all the years we’d known each other, this was one of the the first times I’d really ever done to him. “Get out,” I hissed, in a voice I hadn’t heard come out of me in a very long while. The last time I remembered it, Moriarty was telling me he was Richard Brook, the storyteller—just a storyteller, it's on DVD. “Get out, before I make you.”
She spun around and unloaded the clip into Moriarty’s bemused face.
He got halfway across before the ice cracked and he fell into the water.
Sherlock had started up the stairs with John following close behind when he heard sounds coming from his flat, walking and banging around, and he thought he smelled… what was that, chocolate biscuits? Was Mrs. Hudson up at this hour? Sherlock unlocked the door and opened it wide.
“You were...” I was getting distracted. “You were...”
Mary had been quite serious about John not coming home, and so Sherlock had got his wish—for him to move back to Baker Street. But it wasn’t anything like the fantasy Sherlock had dreamed of; John had been absolutely intolerable, driven to near lunacy at the guilt he felt for leaving Lestrade at the Yard that day. At first John had taken to drinking the anguish away, and then, when Sherlock finally outlawed it, he’d taken to crying.
Sherlock averted his eyes. “I don’t recall.”
, he thought, the word jumping out of the back of his mind.
“You have?” I didn’t even recognize my own voice. It was thick and... and it croaked, like a... frog? Yes. A frog voice. Fuck. My metaphors were degenerating rapidly.
John could almost hear it click into place in his head. “Because you said you’d help her. She thought we would help her.”
“No,” said Anna, looking at the table. “He wasn’t.”
Sherlock shook his head and turned to see Anna sneaking two more dollies into the bag. “Are you really going to play with all of those toys?” he asked, skeptical.
“No!”
“Because,” said Sherlock, shaking John’s hands off his right foot and sticking out his left for its turn, “you’ve never once mentioned them or gone to see them in all the years I’ve known you. I’ve heard of your lesbian, alcoholic sister, but not your

become so demanding?”
“Be… where?”
“It’s hard for Sherlock to fall in love. His mind just doesn’t think in that way, the way yours and mine think. We dream of a handsome man to come a sweep us off our feet, to have a wedding and babies and all the rest.” Anna’s young eyes twinkled at the thought. “But Sherlock has different dreams…” she hesitated. “Well, I’m not actually sure what they are, but I know they don’t include a pretty lady to marry and ride off into the sunset with. If I had to guess, I’m sure they would include you—” Molly poked Anna on the nose affectionately “—growing up and becoming a successful young woman.”
“No,” said John, tickling the bottom of his foot, “I mean the best day of my life.”
John ignored him, looking incredibly amused. “And you’ve forgotten something else, too.”
Carruthers gazed fondly at him, slowly wiping the lenses of his glasses on a cloth that he’d produced from his rear trouser pocket. “Teresa, we might have to keep this one for a while. He’s incredibly entertaining.”
anything.
“I know,” Sherlock said, heavily. “I’ll sort him out.”
The Major turned his head back to look at him. “Aren’t you?” he asked. But the question was almost rhetorical, and Sherlock was stunned for a moment as he asked himself the same one.
John shook his head, warning him. “Don’t.” John’s provocation was backfiring, and he was not happy about it.
When John finally made it back to the hospital, he found Anna curled up sleeping in a very uncomfortable-looking chair next to Sherlock’s bed. He paused to look at her, her dark hair hanging across her face in pieces, breathing so shallowly that she might have been dead. Then he picked her up and gently laid her on the window bench across the room, and covered her in a hospital blanket. He went to sit in the chair she’d been in and had a deep, long sigh. It had been quite a whirlwind week, but all of the danger had passed, and John just felt…
Sherlock could feel Carruthers’ shoe resting next to his own. He lifted his leg and brought it down with as much force as he could muster, grinding his heel into the top of Carruthers’ foot. Carruthers yelped and retaliated by punching him in the back of the head, right where Teresa had hit him before.
“Yeah, that’s what I need. You always know what I need, Sherlock,” she retorted, her voice filled with contempt. She turned around and put on the nearest t-shirt, then searched the floor, finding her backpack under her desk. She flung open her wardrobe and began to shove clothes into the bag.
“And Annalise,” I went on, using her name. Normally I just called her “the baby,” because it was easier to divorce myself from any trappings of sentiment that way. But that was the opposite of my goal here now.
That “something” didn’t have a definition, yet, but it was powerful, strong enough to make John upset. Was it sexual? It had to be, to trigger the “I’m not gay” remark—which, by the way, was complete bollocks and had been ever since John had first uttered the words in the warehouse with The Woman. Sherlock was surprised at the level of denial that had prevailed over the years after that first lie. He wondered what had happened in John’s past to make him so afraid to admit that he liked men, too.
I sighed. “Yes, I know,” I conceded, “but I was... mistaken.”
I suddenly felt unsettled.
“I think it’s probably better if you just go to him, John. I don’t want to…. I don’t know anything, for sure. Don’t want to assume.”
Sherlock watched him through his grey-blue eyes. “Thank you, John,” he said. He lifted his hand and held it out for a shake goodbye.
. She couldn’t say the ‘M,’ at first” Molly explained. “She called
“Molly, slow down,” said Anna. “Let’s stop and talk about this.”
Sherlock leaned forward, his hands already on the glass wall, and pressed his forehead against it in an image of defeat.
“Two weeks was a bit long, though,” he said, turning back to Sherlock. “Lestrade called and invited us to the party tonight, so we figured it was a good excuse to come back a couple days early.”
Sherlock strode through the front door and sighed. John was sitting at the kitchen table, both hands wrapped around a cold cup of tea, staring at him from haggard, hooded eyes. “You didn’t sleep again,” Sherlock observed. It was not a difficult deduction.
“It was something you needed,” said Sherlock, quietly. “You needed it. You said you wanted to know the plan, but you didn’t, all you wanted was to hear that I loved you—and I
Molly thought. No, Anna had seemed quite convinced that she was there to get information from Moriarty. And again, Anna would have to be very, very smart to get into a situation where she could kill the man. Moriarty simply wouldn’t let himself be in a situation like that; he was very clever, and very careful. And Mycroft knew that….
Sherlock looked up at her. “She joined a
Ella looked up from her notebook. “Mr. Holmes, why do you think John kissed you?”
There was dead silence on Sherlock’s side of the door. John sat there, waiting for an answer, not knowing what he’d do if Sherlock said “yes.” He supposed he really would have to move out, because how could he subject Sherlock to his presence when they’d never be what Sherlock wanted them to?
“But—“
“Nonsense. Of course we will train you on the technical aspects, but, my darling, you have a natural gift for deceit. To put it most indelicately, it’s in your blood. We can help you to access it, by letting you… ‘off your leash,’ so to speak, in a way that Sherlock always refused to do.”
Sherlock hesitated. “I did take a slight detour, after.”
There is a lady next door, doing arpeggios, whilst we are having sex.
“I know what I said!” Mycroft yelled back, clearly just as livid.
John came, suddenly, and Sherlock was distracted from his train of thought by the feeling of semen hitting the back of his throat. He swallowed a few times, trying not to taste it (he’d been prepared, had tasted his own the night before as an experiment), then crawled up on the bed next to John and stared at him. John’s chest was heaving and his eyes were still closed in ecstasy. God, he was gorgeous like this, reduced to a state of complete exhaustion from physical pleasure—and all due to Sherlock’s prowess.
in him that no one else, as far as she’d seen, had ever been able to do.
. Then he concentrated with immense effort and managed shift his weight—didn’t move any particularly distinguished muscle, just completed a weight shift.
John took a deep breath and looked around behind him, at the door, knowing that he had to find a way to will his body to turn and match his head, to put one foot in front of the other and go home.
The landlady waved away his comment with her hands. “Now you keep out of the waves,” she said, bending down to Anna’s level. “And keep an eye on Sherlock for me, we know how he can get into trouble.” Anna smiled and looked over at him, and he rolled his eyes comically, making her giggle.
But John didn’t go to the loo. He padded down the hall, and instead of turning left, he turned right, into the laundry room.
Suddenly, Carruthers’ eyes grew dark. “I’m going to have to ask you to leave, Mr. Holmes. I don’t know who you think you are—“
“Are you going to tell us what you’ve found, now?” John asked, annoyed, his elbows on the table and his chin resting in his hands. Molly’s head jerked up suddenly from between her arms, at the sound of his voice. “Or are you going to keep us in the bloody dark?” Sherlock had been at it for over an hour, and daylight was just coming in the windows… and the lack of sleep the night before was catching up terribly with the other two.
“But you loved him,” John insisted. “Wasn’t it absolute agony, not being able to be with him? How did you stand it?”
apologize,” admitted Sherlock. “I just refused to accept it.”
Suddenly, John placed his tongue and the base of Sherlock’s prick and gave it a firm lick all the way up to the very tip. Sherlock moaned before he could stop himself, and then he knew that John had won.
John’s eyes widened in surprise. “Then why did he say she was his?”
, he thought suddenly,
In a flash, Anna closed the umbrella and flipped it upside down. She flung it out and hooked the handle around the man’s wrist, then twisted the umbrella with both hands. The motion, combined with the surprise that the thief felt and the relaxed grip he’d had on the knife while he’d focused on grabbing Molly’s purse, made the dagger go sailing out of his hand and onto the ground. In an instant, Anna picked it up, and with no hesitation swished it out to slice at the man’s right arm. “Yow!” he yelled, turning his injured arm away from the knife, his left hand going to the wound. Without stopping to think, Anna smoothly switched the knife to her right hand and stabbed him directly in his (now exposed) left side.
John looked up in surprise. “You? Help me raise a baby?” He tried to picture it, and the picture was, frankly, hilarious. He started to smile. “I’d pay to see you change a nappy. Or try to deal with her when she cries. I can hear it now—‘John! Why’s she crying? What for? Make it stop!’” He chuckled, his mind jumping to all the other scenarios they might come across. “I suppose you’d be okay with the ‘not sleeping’ thing,” he said, thoughtfully. “God, you’d probably have her doing experiments before she could talk. Solving crimes by age two. She’d grow up in the bloody morgue.” He was thoroughly amused now. He could just see it, a toddler in a long, black coat, collar all popped, the miniature version of Sherlock Holmes. Someone to teach, someone to train—Sherlock would absolutely love that, he could show off all he wanted and she’d eat it all up, hero-worship him. He’d be over the moon. Until, at least, she became— “A teenager, though. Oh, you’d have a field day when the boys started coming round. You’d scare the living shite out of them.”
“Oh yes I did. I got an erection examining some old lady’s rotten toenails.”
The fuzzy bubble Sherlock had been living in all day day dissolved in an instant. And he lashed out.
“Yes, he’s wholly admitted that I’m his friend. Best friend, at that,” John offered, giving Sherlock’s parents the benefit of the doubt.
want to die, and as a doctor, he knew the human body’s limits. Sherlock really shouldn’t be as worried as he was. After all, he didn’t like being worried. It made his stomach roil and fogged his normally sharp brain. It made him feel out of control. He shouldn’t worry, John was right, it was just a passing sadness, Sherlock just had to let him deal with it in his own way. Maybe he
,” repeated Moriarty, rounding his gaze on Anna’s blood-speckled face. He stepped beside her and kicked the blade away. “She’s good at that, has she told you? Killed those awfully boring little band members of hers, all at my instruction… or
And just as the two of them cleared the doors and escaped into the parking lot, the building exploded.
“Oh my God,” she said again.
Sherlock’s hands curled into fists.
John didn’t bother with a cab—he took the car instead, drove like a madman out of the city. The faster he got to Sherlock, the faster he could help him, and the less time his imagination would have to run wild with thoughts of what might have happened or what he would find.
“She’s out of bullets!” John suddenly shouted. Mycroft and Sherlock both started and realized that they’d been too busy bickering to notice how Mary had stopped shooting.
At this juncture I judged he was angry enough to leave (for a little while anyway, not permanently). However I wasn’t ready to see him go yet, so I said the one thing I knew would make him stay:
John listed to the radio now because of what he had said to Sherlock, that he would come home. In the snow it would be a half-day’s walk to the junction shop where the roads were plowed and they could get a ride to the nearest town and eventually make their way back to London. However John had to consider the animals that he would leave behind and if they went out to the shop he’d have to find someone willing to hike back in and take care of them. The chances were pretty slim this time of year, especially now that the snows had come and even with the weather forecast they could still be unpredictable.
Donovan shook her head. “No, ‘fraid not.” She looked at John. “It’s a damn good thing you’re here,” she said. “We’ll need you to help us get his statement.”
“WE HAD SEX!” John bellowed. “That’s ‘playing along
John’s thrusts are indelicate, he doesn’t even wait for Sherlock to get used to the sensation. He digs the pads of his fingers into Sherlock’s hips and fucks him. He fucks him and fucks him, grimacing and sweating, and Sherlock is shaking under his hands, and moaning, “Yes, yes, please, John, John,
“That’s quite enough!” hissed Sherlock, his face a dark shade of purple. He took a very deep breath. “You obviously need some time to… calm yourself.”
“Can you turn it up?” Sherlock asked.
The women froze abruptly, Molly letting out a little yelp of surprise. “Into the alley,” said the man, his gaunt eyes glaring at them from beneath his hood. He used the knife to motion to their right, where there was a small alleyway.
“You wouldn’t dare.”
Anna gritted her teeth at hearing Sherlock’s name, but she kept her face neutral.
John fought to control the emotion roiling inside of him. He needed to be patient, but it was becoming increasingly difficult...
Snow began to fall.
. I wanted to die.” The parents began to avoid him, and the best way for them to avoid him was for their children to avoid his. So the whispers and gossip trickled down to the little ears of the children, and poisoned them against Anna Watson and the man who was raising her.
John picked up several stones and put them in his palm. He curled his hand into a fist like he was a superhero who could crush them in his bare grip. He sniffed once, and then let the rocks fall out. I could see the little red and purple imprints they’d left on his skin. “I never wanted to ruin you.”
is too long,” John replied softly, helping Sherlock to slide off his trousers. Sherlock’s erection jutted out beneath his pants, nearly free—John reached down and finished the job, then pulled Sherlock back into a kiss.
“John!” Sherlock snapped, frustrated. “We don’t have time for this, Anna is the grasp of the most malicious criminal in London, waiting for us to rescue her—“
“Perhaps,” he replied.
Sherlock stood, slowly, his face white as a sheet. He closed his eyes for several seconds, then opened them. “Okay,” he whispered.
Sherlock blinked, bewildered still. “What’s that?”
“I can’t,” she sobbed, her outstretched arm beginning to shake. “I won’t.” She didn’t want to kill either of them. She didn’t want to kill anyone, anymore. She knew Sherlock would hate her if she killed John, but if she let Sherlock die, she would hate herself. There was no winning, here.
He’d started making a mental list.
a coward. A no-good, bloody coward who broke your heart and didn’t have the balls to admit I was wrong. I would have rather been miserable for my entire life than accept that I made a mistake. And by the time I’d realized what I’d done, it was too late.”
. I know where every
“Sorry, ‘You
(The not making promises thing; that was in the past, too.)
Sherlock bent his head to kiss John again. John’s lips met his, soft, parted, shaky. John lifted a hand to the back of Sherlock’s neck, not necessarily pulling him in, but holding him, tenderly. Sherlock closed his eyes, this time. His hands went to John’s waist—again, not pulling, just resting, touching tentatively. They kissed for a few seconds, then both pulled away at the same time.
He didn’t have a response for me on that. He clenched my elbow harder, then sniffed and let it go. He looked at the ground instead of at my face. “I’m gonna get that cab,” he said, and glanced at me quickly before turning around and going back into the building.
Anna watched Mary’s face turn electric with excitement. “You two,” she spoke to Sherlock and John, “sit. Anna, come and do the honors.” She motioned for her with one of her guns. “The key,” she said, “in my front pocket.”
. “Okay,” she said, with more confidence than she felt. She gripped the sides of her seat.
Sherlock lifted him from the dresser and shoved him toward the door. It took all of his willpower to prevent himself from throwing David down the stairs and breaking his neck. The boy ran as fast as he could out of the room, and they heard the front door slam as he exited the flat.
“Probably because she’s been hanging around with
Sherlock sobbed, pathetically, knowing that he wouldn’t, knowing that it was only fuelling Carruthers’ desire, but unable to control himself. “
Mycroft smirked. “No guns for you, I’m afraid. Not yet, anyway.” He registered her disappointment. “Anna, you need to think about the situation you’ll be in. You’ll be playing the role of Moriarty’s daughter, not his hired assassin. I highly doubt you’ll be given a gun. If anything, you’ll probably have a company of armed guards following you when Moriarty’s not there. Maybe even when he
They pulled up to 221B.
John smiled. “I bet it drove Sherlock crazy, that she didn’t pronounce words properly.”
“Help with what?”
Sherlock shook his head after her retreating figure. “I think she’s gotten even more ornery since she’s been back,” he said. “You’d think the whole ordeal would have made her a little more reserved, but no, it seems to have had the opposite effect.” He sighed and turned back to John. They were both keenly aware that they were standing there alone, now.
“Naturally,” Sherlock said, handing him the photo. “I may not be an errand boy, but neither do I pass up opportunities to have my brother owe me a favor.” He smirked. “And judging by the desperation in his voice when he asked me, I surmise the favor will be a rather large one.”
Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief. “Okay,” he called, trying to calm himself. He stared down at his crotch. “Go away,” he muttered. He waited for thirty seconds, trying to take his mind off it. Then a minute. Then two minutes. Then three minutes. He began to grow frustrated.
“It was the first time I’d ever cried in front of your father, and he held me until I couldn’t anymore. He said that it was okay, that Mycroft was only six, but I knew I had ruined him already. I realized I’d passed on the same struggle to him that I’d always had, and it was no bloody way to go through life. I looked at your father, who was happy, who was the epitome of a loving human being, and I thought, God, what have I done. So I told him, I want to try it again. I want to get it right, this time. I have to get it right. And so we had you.” She looked at me, her eyes swimming.
Before long, John’s swearing became incoherent noise and his hands had made their way into Sherlock’s hair, winding through his curls. Sherlock stopped and looked up. “Bedroom,” he commanded. “Now.”
Sherlock and Anna, bundled up against the cold, making their way through the drifts.
Anna crept up the stairs, looking at him. “What—“ she started, as John came down the hall with a backpack on his shoulder. “Where are
“The police are always deeming accidents,” Sherlock barked, beginning to pace.
John’s face grew more serious, but the lightness of the laughter was still in his expression. “Sherlock…” he ran a hand through his own hair and blinked, clearly trying to find a way to start the conversation. “This really doesn’t make much sense to me,” he began. “I feel… I’m not sure what.” He sighed. “Look, all I know is that after all this, these past couple days, I actually sort  of…
Molly rolled her eyes. “Oh God, I know. Anna named her. She was probably eighteen months old and it only made sense in her little mind to name
Sherlock unlocked the door and John stepped in front of him, then turned around suddenly. “Mrs. Hudson, is she… has anyone told her….”
“Stoppit,” John snapped. “Just fucking stoppit, with the fucking guilt trips and the nagging and the bloody ‘You don’t care!’ nonsense, because you
John squirmed uncomfortably under her comment. He was used to people thinking that he and Sherlock were a couple (although, not so much since he’d been married) or that Sherlock was in love with him, but it was doubly awkward to hear it from Sherlock’s parents. He couldn’t exactly use the “It’s not true, I know Sherlock better than you,” defense.
Sherlock was a little bewildered. “Do you remember me?”
Sherlock thought about it. Why was it so important that Anna go with him? Of course he wanted her to grow up with a firm knowledge of who John was, what a brave and wise and kind man he had been. Sherlock had impressed those facts upon her whenever he could, setting up pictures of John in her room, telling her stories about their adventures together. She lovedthose stories. Yet he also… he wanted her to
he thought.
“Same difference,” Anna replied, then lapsed into silence. Suddenly, she sat up. “Do you have double-jointed thumbs?” she asked, promptly holding hers up and popping them backwards. “I’ve always wondered where I got my double-jointed thumbs.”
. It chilled her to her very bones.
Mycroft glared at him. “I
John blinked at him. “Yeah…”
Mycroft’s eyes burned bright with intensity. “At any cost, dear brother.”
“More,” John said, and I pushed in and out a little, this time. “Ah,” he moaned. “More. Move a little bit to the—yeah—“ I shifted, and then John was crying out. “Oh yeah, oh yeah, right there, fuck, fuck, oh Sherlock, fuck me,
John reluctantly let her go and helped her sit up so that she could see him properly. She put her hands on his shoulders to study his face, crying shamelessly, and he was doing everything in his power not to do the same.
“Clearly not,” Sherlock agreed. “Apparently this is a thing, people bombarding hospital rooms. John is overwhelmed, though, you can see him pursing his lips at every exhale of breath.” He nodded toward where John was standing, doing just that. “I suspect he’ll want them all cleared out, soon.”
John began to gape. “Well… I… it… it was pretty obvious, wasn’t it?” he said, turning red. Then he laughed. “What, you’re not saying that you… you and Molly…” Sherlock just looked at him, and John’s eyes grew very wide.
If John hadn’t just come, the look on Sherlock’s face would have made him do it. It was flushed completely, his curls damp on his forehead, his eyes half-lidded and his bottom lip hanging loose with his panting. John pulled him in close and tugged on his cock, and their mouths met in a kiss. Sherlock began to whimper, his voice rising as he got closer and closer—John could feel the pressure building beneath his fingers—and he grasped the back of John’s neck. “I—I—I—“ he choked, then tensed and screwed his eyes shut as he came in between their bellies. He caught John’s mouth with his own at the end, kissing him desperately as the last few spasms shuddered through his body.
To John’s utter wonderment, Anna stopped crying. She stared up at Sherlock, not sure what to make of him and their movements and the music. “Well, bugger me,” said John, collapsing in the nearest chair and gazing with fascination at the pair of them. “Sherlock Holmes, baby whisperer.”
, John.”
came along.”
And that’s when Sherlock realized that Molly wasn’t the only one enjoying this.
) and more importantly knows what to do now. When Mycroft and I were growing up the “what to do now” mostly entailed punishments for our various antics (mine, experiments in the house; Mycroft’s, torturing me), but as we got older and started to have problems that had nothing to do with making trouble at home, she was a wealth of (mostly good) advice that we could always count on whenever something came up that we just couldn’t solve on our own. Admittedly this was a very short window of time, between making trouble for her and trusting our own instincts enough not to have to ask for help. But through it my mother was our main go-to.
John’s mouth hung slack, his breath coming in loud bursts. “Say it again,” he ordered, and moved his index and middle finger to rest over Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock’s shirt stretched up and out of shape as he twisted his arm underneath it.
John watched his slender, alabaster hand grasp the bottle and tip it smoothly into the tumbler. He felt a little drunk. “I know,” he answered, trying not to slur. “And I hated you. For doing that.”
“No. Mrs. Hudson… she’s getting too old for that sort of thing. And,” Sherlock continued awkwardly, “I’ve always thought of you as a sort of—a sort of mother to her. If I had… if I wanted… wasn’t so… well, we could have been a... family.” He cleared his throat most uncomfortably. “Anna would have been happy with that, at any rate. Gotten what she wanted.” He smiled, remembering the candle-lit dinner.
“Yeah,” said Molly. “There was a fishing boat that sunk last night—we’ve got several bodies to exhume… well, have a good evening.” She leaned in to give Anna a hug.
“Ugh!” the man yelled as the wooden spear pierced him. He released Anna completely and she stood up, spinning around to look at what she’d done. Mycroft was at the man’s side, calling for help, and several other people came into the room to tend to the attacker. Then Mycroft stood and grabbed her by the forearm to lead her out of the room.
“But, did you change her nappy?”
“But you need him! He knows how to find Anna!”
at each other from across the room, or something. None of this, ‘Don’t talk until you’ve been questioned by the government for nine hours,’ or, ‘I think you’re a spy for Moriarty and I don’t trust you one bit,’ or, ‘Hello, half-naked woman in my flat—’”
"I don't want you to be angry with me!"
“It's the landing that kills you!”
Sherlock breathed in hard and deep as he woke up from this nightmare. Where was he? His view moved from one piece of the room to the other very fast. John. John! He was next to him.. he was fine.
"I'm just magical." He said simply, a wide grin on his face.
Sherlock looked at his back. Trying... Trying wasn't enough...
Sherlock hurried to bring his clothes in the right position again and ran his fingers through his hair in a fruitless attempt to make them look untouched.
Amelia
He was in the middle of the hallway when he heard the footsteps of John behind him and looked at him from the corner of his eyes. He was very aware that this mysterious behavior made him more interesting, especially to John who sought the adventure. A giggle escaped his throat.
Sherlock was moaning John's name as he went faster, it was... incredible! And he went faster too with his hands. He wanted more of this touches, as soon and much as possible, he wanted to be released!
"That's what bothered you about it?" Okay, he didn't see that coming.
Sherlock was highly nervous. He knew what John wanted to do the second that he started to move his hands. They'd both be... He closed his eyes for a moment. No, he wanted this. He wanted this. Then why was there still something inside him telling him it wasn't natural? It was... he didn't even know what it was. Being touched was something that didn't come naturally to him. And that special area... it was even more... special. Why couldn't he just enjoy it? He wanted to. He did. He loved being close to John, he loved his kisses, his touches, his love... but this was all so fast. Couldn't they get to it slower?
"Not what I want to hear right now Sherlock." John said lowly, pressing his head further against Sherlock's shirt.
John let out an obvious breath of annoyance as he heard the shaking in Sherlock's voice. The male ran his fingers through his hair stressfully and slowly closed his eyes "Sherlock... Please don't lie to me" he muttered quietly before standing up slowly "Where are you? I want you to come home Sherlock, to me." He said firmly before reaching for his coat, slowly slipping it on "Tell me the address and i will come in a cab to get you... Sherlock, You cant keep running away from things because you are afraid of.. Showing emotion" he said firmly. "Please Sherlock, I know you are a 'Sociopath' But you have a heart. I can see the emotion in your eyes when we talk... Please come home" he said, tightening his grip on his phone before slowly rubbing at his eyes. "I love you.." He muttered quietly
"I'm just going to see if I can stand up by myself, I won't be a mo."
"Yeah, go down to the end of the hallway, and they'll be on your left. Breakfast is served in the canteen from 5 to half 8, buffet. I'll just get your key card and you can go to your room, it's number 211."
I'm dying!
Sherlock didn't know what to say about that. John was right.
John let out a growl and bit his ear rather Sharply but he didn't break the skin "Dont tempt me soldier or i will have you on this table right now" he smirked before pulling away from him "Well... I think this was a very productive meeting.... But I'm still interested in this plan of yours.... To get Moriarty out of hiding" he muttered quietly before slowly running his fingers through his hair, trying to cool down and calm his racing heart.
“What are you still doing here? Shouldn't you be off getting me a pardon or something? Like a proper big brother?”
John glanced back when he saw Sherlock, a slight smile of disappointment on his lips when he saw the detective walk from the bathroom fully clothed "its really no problem Sherlock.." He muttered before turning away from him, carefully sipping his own drink before shrugging "not that i can see, sorry Sherlock... There may be something in your emails perhaps?" He suggested before tightening his grip on his mug. The male frowned deeply and his heart beat heavily in his chest, the doctor wanting to kiss his detective and eventually, he got the courage. The male stood up, placing his tea down onto the table before walking into the kitchen, watching the detective sip at his tea "Sherlock." He said firmly, smirking as the detective turned towards him. John stepped forwards and grabbed the front of his suit, pulling the man in closer "i refuse to allow last night to be a one off thing" he growled before pressing his lips a little roughly against Sherlock's, quickly tugging and nibbling at his bottom lip.
“For god's sake, Sherlock. Say something!”
Sherlock sat there in deep thought. He was plotting. Probably Mycroft could have helped him, but he wouldn't go to him unless it was really necessary or he would have already made a plan. He surely was kept busy hanging out with the inspector anyway, and when Sherlock would call all he'd say would be that there was important government business he had to work on. Funny how neither of them could manage not to get involved.
At least he managed to move somehow. And made it outside the building.
John's heart leapt up into his mouth. Sherlock had somehow read his mind, and what he saw there was the small push on the Boulder to send it flying down the hill. He knew Sherlock was entering a nervous breakdown, and he was helpless against it. Panic rushed in. His face paled. "No, no, don't do that to yourself, don't do this, please! I chose to run with you, I chose to come here, it wasn't a mistake it was me making a choice to stay with the man I love. Sherlock," He said desperately, grasping Sherlock's shaking hands as he knelt down, "I'm here, I'm not going anywhere, I know the risks, my mother knows the risks, and we accept them. Please, please, please Sherlock.... Don't do this..." John begged quietly, his eyes wide.
But the touch on his cheek … it felt so right and left him wanting more.
I stepped into the shower and turned on the water. There was a fight in my head. The first voice told me to slow things a bit, so I wouldn't have to be confronted with John. After that dream I had had last night I could barely look at him. I had never dreamed anything like that before, the beginning was embarrassing enough, embarrassing and dumb, and the ending was still as terrifying as it had been in the night. That's what the second voice referred to. I had to hurry to solve the case and protect John. No matter how much I wanted to avoid him right now, I knew that I couldn't live without him. What a confusing paradox. I would simply have to shut it out. For my own best and also John's. I had managed to do that before, I would be able to now. Anytime we met, every time I even heard of him, the... feelings became stronger. John was an extraordinary person, unlike anybody I had ever met before, and whatever it was that dragged me towards this fellow, it was inescapable.
John glanced over to the detective and he could see the change in emotion. The doctor let out a small sigh and reached over to him, Gently squeezing his thigh "Everything will be fine, i will keep you safe from Moriarty and whatever is planned.." He muttered, leaning over to Kiss his cheek before turning his attention back to the roads. The male gripped at the steering wheel and he sighed softly "We are going to be driving for a while, is there anywhere you want to go before we get onto the motorway? Get some food, drinks.." He muttered, glancing over to him quickly before smiling slightly "everything will be okay.." He promised
She looked over to her computer screen and began typing on the keyboard along with the occasional mouse click. By now, the radio had changed to a new song.
What if this now was a trap? Mrs. Hudson was in danger... maybe we would be in danger going upstairs. Choice! I had to make a choice!
"Just don't give yourself a reason to shut everything out, because I'm included in that 'everything'."
Sherlock looked up from the body and at John now. Should he just... well, yes.
I looked at him in surprise. How did he... yes, it was him. Of course he knew. But... how was I to react? Simply tell him the truth? I couldn't lie to John anyway. I was aware that sooner or later he would find out, and if I had lied to him, he would be mad at me.
John: What was that?
“Well... Kind of. I just have to distract myself“, he replied as he remembered that he had promised John to be honest with him from now on.
That will definitely not sit well with Harry, not at all, if she was pissed off about some piece of jewellery, then she will blaze with fury when she found out that John inherited all of the money, heirlooms and the house, especially when he was the one who, as she would say, abandoned them, whereas she was the doting daughter who stayed by her elderly mother's side and nursed her. Which, he supposed, wasn't entirely false. John's eyes fluttered.
“I never said he was alive, I said he was back.”
Sherlock stood like a dog awaiting it's master to throw a stick, and John liked it, the suspense, the excitement and desperation within his normally calm eyes. The ball was in his court, and he was going to draw it out.
Pleasure bubbled up in him, like a volcano about to erupt. All of his senses were heightened, he could feel every bead of sweat on his skin, every spring of the mattress moving, Sherlock's moans were deafening in his ear. His heart pounded viciously in his chest, as if it were about to burst out, and it felt like it too. He could've looked at it from a medical view, as sexual stimulation did provoke a higher heart rate, but in the moment, John couldn't give two shits about that. He was in the final stretch, Sherlock had began to relieve himself with his hands, and John's stomach was in the firing range, not that he minded. John increased his tempo as his primitive urge overtook him. It demanded more, faster, faster faster! He was on the cusp, his moans descended into desperate, loud grunts.
Sherlock: John?
He laughed.
I almost ran into Sherlock as he had stopped in front of the apartment's entrance. I was about to say something, to tell him to hurry, as he moved on. He walked slower now, not straight up to the laptop, as I would have if I hadn't stopped to watch what he was doing, but took off his coat and his scarf.
Sherlock couldn't help himself but looked around when they walked inside. It was a nice house, not big, not small, average.
John had leaned over to him, his eyes were full of worry. Of course he was worried! Sherlock looked terribly ill.
“So, when do we start? Hm, hm, what about.. now?”
They went outside where the sun was surprisingly shining. Sherlock wondered how John's mood had changed into a good one so fast, but still he walked on. He had to make him promises and keep him entertained so he's stay with him.
John let out a loud squeak of shock as Sherlock suddenly pushed him up against the wall of the cubicle. The male whined loudly as he felt Sherlock's hands on his body before he quickly nodded "Yes, yes im all yours" he moaned before kissing back deeply, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's neck, allowing the detective total access to his bodt "Fuck... Just wait until tomorrow" he muttered, pulling him in a little closer so that he could grind against Sherlock's hardening bulge with his own, the doctors cheeks turning an even deeper shade of red
John waved her question away with an air of tiredness. "I'll tell you in detail after I get some tea, but basically, there is someone watching us back in London, and we need to get away. Don't worry," John started, when he saw the anger in her eyes, "They don't know we're here. You and mum are safe." His reassurances didn't make a big difference to her attitude, but it did enough to switch her anger to reluctance, and keep John and Sherlock welcome in the house. She looked John up and down, her eyebrow arched. Silence. If he stood too close to her, John could smell the lingering scent of alcohol on her, and although she didn't appear to be drunk, John had every suspicion she was. In a way, she resembled Sherlock, who had also mastered the art of pretending to be sober. Of course, Sherlock was properly sober now. She waved her hand dismissively to the room on her left, obviously done with trying to break John. "You know where everything is, don't you?" She asked with a hint of bitterness. Harriet knew that he didn't know where the cups or the tea was, John could tell. She had always liked to play these little games of control and humiliation, even when they were children, she did it, poking fun at him when his friends were around, telling him constantly that he was doing it wrong, things like that. He walked into the kitchen, and almost immediately spotted where Harriet kept her prized collection of alcohols and liquors. Definitely still a drinker then. John thought to himself, if someone lit a match near her when she breathed, she would go up like a firework. Sherlock had stayed in the hallway, observing and deducing God knows what about John's family. His movements were signalled by the creaking in the wood floor made by his footsteps. Please come in here, John thought, let me hold you, let me set your mind at peace, my little tin soldier. Sherlock remained in the hallway. Now that he thought about it, it was probably best to let him do his deductions, take his mind off of things. John stuck to what he did best, making tea, or at least, trying to find the objects he needed to do what he bloody did best. It had taken John 15 minutes to discover where the cups and teabags were, much to the delight of Harriet, who had stood in the second doorway on the other side of the room for the last 5 minutes, smirking, a bottle of red wine held loosely in her grip. Probably empty. The kettle was easy to spot, set down near the sink. The same one that John had last seen in this house. It was a whistler, meaning that it was heated on the stove, and when the water had boiled, it whistled, hence the name. By then, Sherlock had joined John in the room, and had sat down at the table. Seeing that the famous detective was now at her disposal, Harriet took the seat opposite him. No doubt she would try to seduce Sherlock, and despite the current situation John and the detective were in, it still made John eager to see what Sherlock would make of it, and the humiliation Harriet would experience.
"God, you're perfect.." John breathed.
“Precisely. No matter what awaits us there, it will show us who we are dealing with.”
Sherlock stormed towards him, took the pillow and threw it far away: “Come on, it wasn't that bad! Not at all a reason for killing y...”
He didn't dare open his eyes, in case the light still hurt them, or in case he couldn't see anything ever again. Darkness was his comfort, his safety. Sherlock... He was there, John knew he wouldn't leave him. His heart hammered.
Sherlock smirked as he exposed his John, was this what flirting was like? He hoped it was and not insulting again. The difference was hard to see.
John let out a cry as the pillow was yanked from his arms, the solider desperately trying to grab it back but it was too late, Sherlock had already seen the tears in his eyes. The male breathed carefully, his chest aching and he quickly wiped and rubbed at his eyes "What do you want Sherlock..?" He asked, slowly standing up and pushing past him when he found that he couldnt stop his tears. The male sniffed and shook slightly, letting out a slight cry when he couldn't stop his tears flowing "Just leave me alone Sherlock" he said, this was the first time the male had ever cried in front of the sociopath, and he never wanted to be in this situation. He wanted to be held by the other male, protected... looked after. The Solider sighed and bit at his bottom lip "im going to go to sleep okay..?""
Some time later I stood in the door frame of Sherlock's room. He laid in his bed, he was asleep. On the one hand I was glad that he would be fine again, on the other hand I was still worried and couldn't just leave him, go home and forget about what had happened today. Tonight I would stay here, look after him and help him if it was necessary. I had called Mary and explained the situation to her. Although the child could be born anytime now, she said it would be fine and she would just call Janine for a sleepover.
It was Mary to reply. Sherlock barely even listened. His thoughts were stuck on John and he was still in his own world somehow and had to concentrate hard to handle reality. Mary wanted... to take him to hospital.
Sherlock could sense that John was not okay, so he tried to stay as calm as he could.
"And I had several mouthfuls..." John said quietly, feeling sick all of a sudden.
Mary: Oh, the posh boy loves the dominatrix. He's never knowing the under cliché, does he?
Garnet red, premium manifacture, obtained by the carmine scale, imported from southern Mexico, not keen. Painted on there while John and I had been distracted, like 15 minutes to get to the walls and let everything that had helped reaching the place disappear. Ladder? Too small. From out of the windows? Too complicated. Aerial ladder? Possible. Eye-catching? Definately. Asking people on the street if they had seen somebody? Not really my area...
“Sherlock!”, John screamed just like on that day when I had jumped. I couldn't see him no more.
The substances could have still been there somewhere."
“If you're thinking this is about your sister you must mistaken this for a family vacation which it's definitely not. The danger is real, John”, as he was saying the last sentence Sherlock's voice started to shake, which he tried to stop as he continued, “We're on the run, not up to mind family business or shopping tours...”
Damn...! Only a sharp intake of breath, nowhere near the shout he was hoping for. He couldn't do it again right after the first time.... He would have to wait a while before 'slipping' again. At least he knew that it had an effect on Sherlock, he could use that to his advantage. John trailed his lips further down to Sherlock's stomach, and felt the grooves of muscle under them, like sloping hills. He wanted to kiss Sherlock's lips again to taste him, and brought his up to meet the slightly parted lips of the detective.
Sherlock looked at John and couldn't stop admiring how understanding he suddenly was. Knowing how he felt, although he tried to do what's best for him and still doing anything to make Sherlock feel comfortable.
Sherlock breathed in sharply as he heard John's voice next to his ear. Honestly... he wouldn't even mind to vanish to the bathroom for some time.
Why wasn't he holding him, orrrrr near him? God he was tired. Sherlock... John flopped his arm slightly as a hint for his detective to wrap his long arms around him. His fingers brushed against the smooth skin of Sherlock's bicep. Maybe... John should, should, should......John should take the initiative and hold Sherlock. If only his body would cooperate. He sank further into the bed.
He then moved on to John's shoulder and placed small kisses on it while he ran his fingertips over the strong body.
John connected his lips with the side of Sherlock's face, and held them there for a second, almost transferring his love to Sherlock through touch. He returned his nose into Sherlock's hair, inhaling the scent. "You don't have to say anything, anything at all."
John blinked when Sherlock told him the plan, a smirk growing on his lips and he suddenly leaned forwards, grabbing a hold of Sherlock and pulling him into a deep kiss "Mine..." He muttered against his lips before cupping his face, continuing to kiss the detective for a few moments "Mine" he muttered once more before slowly pulling back "this sounds like a great plan" he muttered
Sherlock lifted a hand as he wanted to comfort John and hesitated as he thought of where exactly to put it. He decided to pat John's shoulder, but soon he let the hand rest there. Poor, poor John.
Meanwhile, John lay on the stone cold floor, hearing the fight emanate from the living room. His head still ached, and his joints felt like jelly. There was no way he could stand up. Their screaming hurt his ears, and he blocked them with his hands. Had Harry really meant that she didn't care if he died? He felt a sharp pain of sadness pierce his heart as he realised, she more than likely did. He slumped his head against the floor, the cold reviving him somewhat, and lay alone.
"I'll... Stay awake if that makes you feel better.... I don't want to particularly fall asleep now with that thought in my mind..."
Sherlock stared at John for a while before he could get himself to speak. He didn't want to see him as broken as he himself had been before, he didn't want to let him go through that. But John had asked him to be honest with him, to trust him and to share his thoughts with him. So he would.
He took a deep breath before he returned to his cold “focused-on-the-mind” self. Where had he stopped thinking? Right, right. Luring Moriarty out of the shadows.
„Miss me?“, he asked and couldn't help but smile when he saw his John again... he thought he had lost him! This was relief.
John's world froze. An innocent? A-a bystander? He felt a cold stab of shock hit his heart, and the frost spread through his entire body. On the outside, he appeared normal, but his eyes were staring. "Wh-when did you find out..." He asked numbly.
As Sherlock heard John's answer he nodded slightly, then he went to the door... which seemed to be another problem. How would he open it? He went a bit down and managed to somehow. Walking to the car wasn't easy either as it was dark and Sherlock couldn't see where he made his steps. And once he was there... well, how would he open the door of the car? The entrance of the house had been simple compared to that...
From this chapter on Amelia Watson has written John instead of Tiffany.
“John, this is the last thing you have to worry about now”, Sherlock replied in a calm voice and reached out for John's hand, thinking that could calm him, “I just wanted to tease her a little, that's all. You are very well aware of the fact that you are my only interest.”
"What's your fault, the headache? The fact that my sister is a bitch? The fact that I love you no matter what? One little migraine isn't going to send me running for the hills, the same as Moriarty isn't."
As they arrived at the elevator and waited for it, Sherlock held John even closer. He wanted and needed this closeness now.
John: It's amazing, text her then
"Love you." He panted.
“We're looking for the best of climbers. The one that wouldn't fail the job. It's him.”
"Okay, John, everything has gone through my mind already so many times. We could try to find him directly, attack him, use the element of surprise, we could use his tricks and weaknesses against him, but I don't know. Is an attack really the best option? Because going into defense is only procrastination...."
Tears started to form in his eyes now, “He wants to kill you and John, I couldn't live with that, I couldn't live without you.”
“You're alright...”, he said to John, but more to himself to convince his heart. It was just a dream. Nothing to be scared about. He leaned against John's chest trying to calm down. His breath slowed down with the seconds passing by. John was talking to him, kind and loving words.
Sherlock would keep holding John until he would make a move to go to a different position or leave the hug.
He let Sherlock take him into his arms. The tight embrace was his protection, and he pressed his head onto Sherlock's chest, trying so hard not to cry. Harriet. His sister. The one he had once made a castle for, out of old pieces of wood, day in and day out. She wanted him dead? Did the house really mean that much to her? He clung onto Sherlock's shirt.
"So, you're the Sherlock Holmes I see get talked about on the tv?" Harry asked in a low, seductive voice. Her lips were curled into a feline smile, and she bit her bottom lip. John scoffed quietly, earning him a quick glare from her, quick enough to miss. She went back to gazing at Sherlock with fake awe. John noticed that the detective was extremely still, like he was a statue made of stone. He didn't reply to Harry, but despite that, she still remained determined to catch him. Her eyebrows flicked up, and that smile grew larger. "You're a shy one huh? Tell me, are you this quiet in bed?" John inhaled sharply. "Are you ever quiet full stop?" Sherlock replied cooly. She flinched slightly, before edging closer over the table to him. "I can be, if you want." She whispered, licking her lips as she stared at Sherlock's. She leant over even more, and pulled his tie into her slender hands. Sherlock snatched her wrists, and Harriet let out a gasp of surprise. John stopped pretending to make the tea, and snapped around. He knew, that even though Sherlock would never return her actions, he felt jealously rise. "Get out, I need to talk to John." Sherlock growled. She ripped her hands out of his grasp, gave both him and John a glare of rage, and walked swiftly out of the room, coddling her wrists. John watched her go out, and sat down where she was previously. "What the hell was that?" John ordered.
"I thought I didn't have a chance... that I couldn't survive... but then I remembered that Magnussen was still out there and you were in danger. And I just couldn't let him hurt you. So I continued to fight. I was dead... but I fought myself back. For you."
“Am I not? Let's make this more interesting, shall we? You solve the case, I let him go. Doesn't that sound fair?”
John frowned in confusion, what was he on about? He thought this was just about his rude sister, but evidently it was much deeper than that. "Sherlock, I was on about Harry... What are you on about?" He asked cautiously, emphasising the 'you'.
"Yes?" He chuckled lowly, wanting to know what Sherlock had to say before he kissed him again.
I went upstairs, he worried me. He usually didn't shout like this. He wanted me to come to him, but he sent a message or something. Yes, it would have been strange in this situation, but we're talking about Sherlock!
"Oh, right..." Sherlock had completely forgotten about it and now that he was remembered on it a slight blush appeared on his face.
John moved his head upwards slightly to look at his detective.
Sherlock: *looks down* Well, no need to turn it into a big speech, right? John Watson, I don't text her back because it's you whom I've completely and irreversably fallen for. I think I... love you.
John turned his body so that the side of his face was against the warm skin of Sherlock's arm and put his full weight on. He was still paranoid that it was going to hurt him. His eyes fluttered over to the scar on Sherlock's chest from where he was shot by the late Magnussen, the tissue rippled and shone a slight silver from where John was lying. It was beautiful, in a twisted way. He wanted to run his fingertips over it, but he wasn't sure whether Sherlock would be ok with it, he knew personally that he felt uncomfortable whenever his ex-girlfriends had noticed it when he had been getting undressed. Instead, he draped his arm over Sherlock's torso and tucked his hand underneath, between Sherlock and the mattress.
"Sherlock, I..." He tried to pull himself up again, but failed for the second time.
The screen turned off and we heard a huge explosion outside and below us. Mrs. Hudson! I ran downstairs to look for her at once. There was smoke everywhere, the walls all black, the curtains burning.
“Moriarty has poisoned us, I walked into a waiter when I left the restaurant, and I hadn't noticed it back then but he had watched me leave... it was him to put the poison into our food... When we had gone into the bathroom just anybody had followed us, and he actually had wanted to help. We have only interpreted it as a threat... Do you remember what he said? “Oh, oh you think this is a threat? I just wanted to pay a visit to my favourite restaurant as I recognized you two. How could I have known that I'd interrupt your sweet tête-à-tête?” He really meant that... he wasn't Moriarty and what he said was true... Our heads have turned it into something dangerous... I'm sorry John, I should have known.“
They stopped in front of the car.
His hands slid onto Sherlock's waist and swept over his back to rest on his neck before he pushed Sherlock's face down to his. He began to give him small kisses all over his cheeks, his mouth, forehead, everywhere. They were like his mark, to show that he loved Sherlock, and nobody else could have him. His lips finished their journey by pressing onto Sherlock's.
Sherlock's eyes opened wide in surprise of what John was doing, simply... kissing him! It wasn't like this had never happened to him before but... this was the first time that it actually meant something to him. That it overwhelmed him. Took all his thoughts and his breath away.
“Oh god, John! Please tell me you're okay!“ Sherlock jumped up. The proof was written all over John's face. There were little red points showing that there had been pressure on his face, vomiting. Also he wore that certain look of disgust although he were trying to hide it.
"I know, but maybe we should actually use it, i mean, can you think of anything else?"
He wanted this damn thing off now, he wanted John, he wanted his skin against his own, he wanted to touch him.
"Why, why give me all of that? I left you, this is the first time I've visited since I left 8 years ago, surely Harry deserves at least half, if not all of the house and belongings?" John asked, his voice becoming urgent and high.
He opened the door to the morgue, where Molly waited for them already.
“You're right, all is fine. What am I even doing?”, Sherlock caught himself again realizing how stupid his reaction about this was. He wasn't this weak. This dream couldn't hurt him.
John's world narrowed to the feeling of Sherlock's lips on his sensitive neck and he let out an involuntary gasp. Goosebumps rose on his skin and a shiver of pleasure ran through him. He pulled Sherlock tighter to his body.
John placed a hand firmly on Sherlock's chest to make him stop, and stared up into his eyes with his stone hard look.
“Mrs. Hudson?!”, I shouted. She must have been here somewhere. But where? “Come on, Mrs. Hudson, make a sound!”
Sherlock felt rigid, probably due to sitting up without back support for over half an hour. It must be uncomfortable...Maybe, if John applied gentle pressure on his chest, he might fall back onto the bed, where John could hold him better and his back wouldn't ache as much.... Then again, he didn't want Sherlock to become agitated or to freeze up. This act of kindness was not without it's cautions, anything could make Sherlock feel pressurised or anxious. He was like a 6 foot bomb, albeit an extremely handsome and gentle one. He was in a delicate state, not in a weak or emotional way, but in a way that he was testing the waters on touching John affectionately. Sherlock was watching the ripples cautiously from the windows of his mind palace, John knew he was there at the moment. The way he looked into nowhere, the slight loosening of his arm around John. These were signs that he wasn't fully in the real world. John understood, and was happy that he at least felt comfortable to be the first one to engage in contact willingly. It was small steps, small steps...
“When I was at the abandoned factories...”
Sherlock could hear John snapping at her, but he didn't listen. Those stupid ordinary people didn't deserve his attention. He kneeled down and observed the heap.
It was in this moment that Sherlock knitted his brows in an angry way and lifted his view. She didn't even finish her sentence, her blabing, when he had laid John on the floor carefully and rushed to the living room. He saw Harriet there, that stupid grin on her face, she just let herself fall on the sofa. Sherlock pulled her up again before she had even sat down and pinned her against a wall. "John almost died and that's all you've got to say about it?!", Sherlock pressed through his teeth fiercely.
"I know." John said, a hint of protectiveness in his voice. He didn't need protecting all of the time, he was in a bloody war, and in war nobody was treated like they were weak and defenceless. But, John couldn't help a small, tiny part of him enjoying Sherlock defending him. Unfortunately, the majority of his mind had no time for it, but if it pleased Sherlock then he wouldn't mind being the princess rescued by the prince. For the time being, anyway. "But that was meant for both of us, you know?" John added, arching an eyebrow.
Sherlock looked away and stumbled into the room in a clumsy way, trying to act normal, but amazingly failed. “I'm sorry...“, he managed to stay and held on to a chair.
Moriarty?! I turned around, looked around. He stood there, right next to John. No. No! How...? I took a step back.
"Do you now?" He said in a voice like crushed velvet, low and seductive.
"What is that supposed to mean?"
"See you as what?" John furrowed his eyebrows.
"Hey," He said, burying his nose into Sherlock's dark curls, "I know you feel scared, to tell you the truth, so do I, but we can't let that fear and feeling of vulnerability make us give up. At this moment, Sherlock, your emotions are a cocktail, yes, but if you leave it long enough, the ingredients might separate from each other. Give it time, that's the best remedy, time and love. And don't worry, I'll be with you to the end of the line, forever."
“No, but I can hurt him”, Moriarty said and shot John's shoulder.
"Mhm." John hummed in agreement.
Sherlock's footing seemed to be uncertain, and John was worried about being dropped by accident onto the stone floor, but Sherlock didn't slip, and remained upright the entire time. When he reached the car however, he halted, and John felt him duck down to try and open the car door. Sluggishly, John intervened and took the keys from Sherlock's hand before lowering them down to the door and twisting. Nausea had begun to stir in the back of his throat, and he tried to swallow it down. It wasn't too bad at the moment, he just hoped it wouldn't grow.
The fall was over. The game was on.
John growled when he watched Donovan, clenching his fists before scoffing "I didn't hallucinate..." He breathed, flexing his fingers before glancing across to Sherlock, studying the detective before clicking his tongue in irritation at Anderson's comment "Anderson.. If someone had burnt the body, the smell would be horrific in here. Trust me, i know what a burning corpse smells of" he glared over at him before flexing his fingers, Listening to him mention a previous case. The doctor shrugged his shoulders and slowly walked around the room, glancing up at the ceiling as he tried to see if there had been any way of Moriarty escaping even if he had managed to survive. "I shot him dead.... Even if he had managed to survive, where is the trail of blood?!" He frowned deeply before sighing, turning to look at Sherlock with slightly worried and frustrated eyes. "Why cant he just... Disappear? Stay away from us..?" He groaned in irritation
"Fuck yes!" He whispered loudly, shaking his fists triumphantly in the air.
~ John's point of view ~
Sherlock was bending down again now, and gently put John in the passenger seat. John could see the concentration and worry in his face as he manoeuvred his arms so that John wouldn't get hurt. He noticed that he avoided touching his head, which was understandable. It made John love him even more for being protective, it was adorable how much he cared for him. Sherlock slipped his hands out from underneath John, and stepped back to see whether he was in a comfortable position, his eyes darting over John. John smiled gratefully and leaned over to buckle his seatbelt.
Sherlock's breath went deeper and harder the more John was doing all those things to him. To feel those fingers in his hair was wonderful. Exciting. And their bodies next to each other... incredibly tempting. Sherlock couldn't help himself and changed his position again, looking at John, always in worry if he would mind. Now that he got finally access to his chest he wanted to caress it and he did. He took his place in between John's legs, then he ran his hands over the hot skin to get an idea of it first. It was smooth and hard at the same time, muscly but soft. He crawled somehow on top of John and started to kiss the skin right below his neck first, the sweet and tempting hollow that he loved so much. Sherlock's breath fastened and he went for it more eagerly. Then he continued moving downwards and kissed John's chest, always hoping that John liked it too.
