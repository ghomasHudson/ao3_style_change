“You know what?” John continues. “Perhaps it wasn’t even him. Molly says he works for the British government, but the man I met is just some arsehole police officer in Las Vegas.”
“No, not in general. But you were smelling me just now. And earlier, in the sitting room. It was kind of obvious.”
“Aw.” Gabriela leans forward and kisses Sarah on her forehead. “You’re adorable when you’re jealous.”
"You've got to take it easier," Sherlock utters just above the helix of John’s ear, and John feels the words on his burning cheek.
Once he’s fully seated, Sherlock turns his head back, reclaiming John’s lips and continuing to kiss him passionately. His lower body moves in waves as he rides him, and John bucks up into him, slowly, slowly, slowly.
He’s a med student at Harvard, for fuck’s sake. He can name every single bone in the human body. He’s a fantastic student, and a brilliant diagnostician, and he’s got no fucking clue how to explain what happened last night at The Strand.
She reaches back into her pocket and pulls out a white envelope. “I’m not going to tell you,” she says. “But I think you’ll find everything you need to know in this letter.”
"I suppose that's one way of putting it." John laughs, taking Sherlock's hand into his, a gesture that causes Sherlock's heart to become briefly tachycardic. "God, I can’t wait until we’re home to kiss you again. I saw a stage prop storage room on the way in. Looked empty."
John knows she’s right. He knows, deep in his bones, that there is no other choice. Because— although he's aware of how mad he may seem, he is utterly overwhelmed with the knowledge that it’s their destiny.
One thing is certain, however: when he's with John as of late, he smiles much more than usual. He smiles when John plays with his hair and kisses the top of his skull and uses his nicest words. It might even be his new favourite thing to do with John, second only to going on cases with him, which is saying a lot.
“Sorry, sorry,” he apologises as he stumbles through. “Didn’t mean to reveal your identity to...whom, exactly? Though to be fair, I’m certain every word I said got soaked up by that thick, shaggy carpet."
But as gravity pulls him down from the third floor of Royal Albert Hall to the pavement, there’s only one thing on his mind.
: Everyone but Molly (bonus knowledge that hasn’t yet been revealed: Donovan would quite like to have sex with her)
"Wait. No, I can't just guess right away. I'm supposed to ask questions. Narrow it down. Hence the name, Twenty Questions."
“John!” Sherlock can’t contain the gasp that escapes him as he clings tightly to John with every limb.
Light pours in. Bloody awful light. John rubs his eyes for far to long, hoping he’ll go back to sleep. “Already?” he groans.
is the love of your life, Sherlock? He’s more...diminutive than I imagined. A pity, really.” He side-eyes John, who still has him in a tight hold. “You think you can satisfy him, John? You wouldn’t believe what he can do, this one. I had him first, you know.”
John allows his entire body to settle over Sherlock’s, like a warm John-blanket. And then he kisses him; a full body kiss, this time, lips and tongue and teeth. A warm, intimate embrace. Sweaty, naked skin on skin.
He’s not exactly hiding their tryst from her—she’s far too clever not to have noticed it by now. But her feelings for William do complicate things a bit. If it bothers her, however, she’s never let on.
John bursts into laughter, which Sherlock would love to listen to for the remainder of the morning--but regrettably, he must finish what he needs to say.
Sherlock wants to kick himself. No. John regrets what he's done, all because Sherlock was too awkward to reply.
But it's not until John combs his fingers through his hair that he begins to truly lose control. They drift over his scalp, tugging lightly at his curls, and it's positively earth-shattering. Sherlock's body twists and turns, and his moans become near-whimpers, and he thinks he might even be saying John's name.
Feeling the fierce urge to express his gratefulness, he bends forwards, wrapping his arms around Brook’s shoulders. He has never hugged anyone on purpose before—he wonders if he's doing it correctly. It feels odd. Odd, but nice—especially when Brook lifts his arms loosely in some semblance of returning it.
He takes in a deep breath. "John. I look at you as you carry out the most mundane tasks imaginable—reading the paper, watching television, washing dishes—and I think to myself that you are the most fascinating person I’ve ever known. And that I couldn’t love you more, but with that, you always prove me wrong. You are everything to me. My best friend. My partner. My hero. The reasons to love you are infinite, as is my love. And I'd like to remind you of that tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that. And every day that follows until I can no longer speak."
“I can’t believe this is happening,” John remarks quietly as he removes Sherlock's final piece of clothing.
John swears as Sherlock pulls away suddenly. Sherlock gives him a smug grin, reaching over to the nightstand and removing a tin jar from the drawer. He pops the lid open, scoops out some petroleum jelly, and he slathers it liberally over his cock. He then leans over John’s body, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him closer until they're fully aligned, his slick hardness brushing against John’s opening.
"Thanks for the tip." John peers up at him defiantly. Obviously, he would do it a thousand times over if it meant saving Sherlock's life.
“Obviously, I noticed it immediately,” she purrs. “But I decided it would be more fun to pull my knife to your face after you’ve orgasmed. Don’t you think?”
"Oh." Sherlock freezes. His stomach twists and his throat goes dry. “Mrs. Hudson must have taken too many herbal soothers and forgotten to clean the shelves.”
It’s what he said to me that day. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life. So I am leaving Boston, and leaving The Strand behind.
But eventually, it does. And when they break the kiss for air, William looks at John, and John gets the feeling they’ve been looking at one another for longer than he knows.
“Hush,” she says. "When did you become so grumpy?” She can’t contain the grin on her face. “Oh, wait. You’ve always been that way.”
He and John never speak of this again. They don’t need to; they’ve said goodbye far too much in this particular lifetime.
The man glances up over his newspaper, surprised, crows-feet eyes squinting in amusement. “Watson. You don’t normally call me that unless we’re making love.”
"I'll just slide my arms beneath your shoulders,” he says to John. “And after that, I’ll pull you on to the bed so you're sitting upright. You think you can take it from there?”
"Perhaps you should pass on the cake, Marci,” William suggests. “Judging by the fit of your jeans, you’ve put on ten pounds this semester alone. Come to think of it, you’ve been nursing the same drink all evening—oh!” He claps his hands excitedly. “John must be taking you to the pharmacy to pick up a home pregnancy test!”
The way he speaks, the desperation in his voice—John understands nothing, but knows he’s telling the truth.
“Great,” she says. “I’m learning a lot. But it’s still fun to hear about other people’s love lives. Are you two officially together, then?”
“I can neither confirm nor deny your theory." Sherlock takes John's hand as if he knew John hoped he would; carefully, knowing it's still damaged.
John smiles a bit sheepishly. "I played once upon a time. My grandmother began giving me lessons as a child. I sort of gave it up when I went into the military. Perhaps I'll take it up again some day. What's wrong? You seem distraught."
Fear and dread rise from Sherlock’s stomach to his throat as he starts to realise what John is saying.
John’s own hips surge up and down until he can feel William’s hardness align with his arsehole. And when he hits that sweet spot, he gasps and arches his back, biting his own lip to keep from crying out.
“—be my boyfriend! Aha!” The words finally make their way out, though Sherlock notices that his eyes are beginning to grow wet.
The man rests his elbows on the table, fingers interwoven, and sets his head on his hands. “I’ve got a few questions first, Mister Watson.”
John sighs with frustration—again, frustration. It’s the only identifiable, quantifiable emotion that William seems to evoke in him.
“Alright,” John says slowly. He expects his world to come crashing down. It doesn’t. “It’s just—the stars. They haven’t come out yet.”
John responds by choking on absolutely nothing and then coughing for a moment or two. His eyes flit to Sherlock, who sits with his arms across his chest and a smug smile on his face.
“Lads and ladies of Las Vegas,” he declares jubilantly. “Welcome to our show: A Life for a Life! When the sun comes up, a life will be taken. Whose life will it be? Will it be our brave hero, John Watson? Or will it be his lascivious lover, Sherlock Holmes? The stakes are high, but so is the Stratosphere hotel and casino—so stay tuned to see why that’s relevant!”
Sherlock rolls over to one side, resting his head in his hand, and he smiles at John flirtatiously. “I haven’t read it yet.”
His eyes fly open, and he raises his head off the pillow. “John. Perhaps we ought to have gone with the vampire and werewolf costumes.”
John gets ready for bed the same way he always does; he says goodnight to Stamford as they head to their own bedrooms, looks at himself in the mirror while washing his face and brushing his teeth, and he knows that on the outside, he appears no different.
There is not much else he can do besides wait, hoping and hoping and hoping that John does not come.
"Yeah." John glances briefly at the crutches and then back to Sherlock. He’s intentionally aloof in his response, though it’s true—he's learning to walk with crutches very successfully. It would be something worth celebrating if weren't the reason he’s leaving.
Sherlock swallows thickly. “Yes,” he croaks. He clears his throat and tries again. "Yes." He swallows. “Water? I need water. Where do I get water?”
It's a seed that became sowed in John's head long ago, perhaps that fateful evening one January, when they first stepped into the restaurant. And by the time he realised the seed had even been planted, it had already grown and sprouted several more seeds, which in turn became a labyrinth of lush green trees and weeds and twisty-turny vines.
The very first time John and Sherlock exchange kisses and love confessions, they’re in the alleyway after a candle-lit dinner.
He’s suddenly struggling to breathe, and he doesn't want to look—but the words blur together, directly above Brook's head:
John gapes down at the sight of their fingers intertwined, his eyes comically wide. Sherlock pretends not to notice. Instead, he begins telling the story of his first serial murderer case as if he never has. He has. John’s listened to it no less than a dozen times. But this is the first time to hear it while Sherlock’s touching him. This version of the story is much better.
“Aren’t you the slightest bit curious?” John asks one morning (six days later), as the two of them are drinking tea.
Molly proceeds hastily, removing John’s coat and unfastening the bungee cord from the harness he’s wearing beneath it.
But he doesn’t wait for an answer or an explanation. He opens it—and on the other side, he finds a small, dark staircase.
“You did?” John never even considered the possibility, though he was admittedly a bit distracted by the pretty dickhead behind the bar that night.
It’s really quite lovely, his laugh. He laughs with his entire body—this is something Sherlock knows about him, but it’s the first time he’s
“You okay?” Gabriela closes her book once more and sets it onto the bedside table. “You look like you just saw a ghost.”
He checks the time as he reaches his destination. 6:57. At 7:00 sharp, a black limousine pulls up to the curb, and Mary steps out.
He doesn't count the number of days it's been since John has shaved. Or think of how John becomes more irresistible with each passing one. He doesn’t fantasize about the rough skin on John’s neck, or the smooth skin of his chest, and how they might feel beneath his own lips or fingertips. Doesn’t attempt to solve the mystery of which is more luminous: the patches of silver in John's hair, or the moonlight shining upon it. He doesn't anathematise his own eyelids for growing exhausted and closing, forcing him to miss a second of how beautiful John is while he sleeps.
“Ah, John.” Sherlock’s fingers remain crossed beneath his chin; he doesn’t look up. “You’re still awake?”
"Nothing is the matter, per se," Sherlock responds. "It's just...you're mostly naked right now, and it's all I can think about, and I'm not quite sure what to do about that."
He meets Sarah and Gabriela at the back end, and Sarah explains why she came back there: at some point the prior evening, she’d apparently lost her wallet—so the two of them came to search the area.
"And furthermore, today is Saturday!" Sherlock exclaims. "Traditionally, you've spent Saturday nights with your boring girlfriends, presumably to engage in various mating rituals. But it
The words suddenly cross Sherlock’s mind, seemingly from nowhere, and he wonders where he’s heard them before. Perhaps they came from a book of fairytales.
The Strand, closed, with no explanation. The blood-red letters "IOU" splattered onto the door. William's disappearance. Molly's photograph on the wall, and the mysterious, flickering message: GET SHERLOCK.
Sherlock's heart skips a beat. The two have spent nearly every day, alone, doing nothing. Sherlock has wondered when John would become bored of this, but in the past three weeks, the only thing he sees when he observes John is that stupid, beautiful smile.
“N-no!” John stammers. His face grows hot as he shoots a glance at Marci, who looks back at him expectantly.
Sherlock rubs his temples. “You’re ridiculous. And I fail to see why I require you to approve of this person, anyway. I’m simply going to choose, and you’re going to have to deal with it.”
"Blah blah, blah blah blah." Sherlock hears the brilliant words flowing from his own mouth as he divulges his findings on the victim. Lestrade nods along, because he’s fluent in gibberish.
John’s heart is in his stomach, but he feels a tick of relief. “Did you say Thursdays at 7:30? Can’t be her—she’s got an anatomy lecture at that time.”
He keeps kissing him and kissing him and kissing him, and John doesn’t stop kissing him back. Doesn’t stop allowing himself to be kissed, to be adored, to be his.
He kisses John as though it’s the very first time; as though he's been stuck with the want of it for far too long. As if this single kiss carries the weight of ten thousand; as if it has no beginning or end.
The corner of Brook’s mouth turns upwards. “Not at all. Actually, she's the one who encouraged me. She would say: in our universe, there are countless beautiful mysteries unsolved, and mankind is curious by nature. She didn’t believe it to be a coincidence.”
It isn't only his life flashing before his eyes, but many lives—and in every one, he and John are together, and they are happy. As he thinks of what he is about to do, it offers him comfort.
William rises from the piano bench; he sighs into John, surging forward and sealing their mouths together. John kisses him back sweetly, pouring his love out, hoping to take every ounce of sadness from his lips. But even as the kiss is broken, William tastes like tears.
“First, I seduce her.” Gabriela takes another sip of her drink before she seems to realise she hates it. She sets it down onto the table with a gagging noise. “Then, I’ll attempt to get her talking about herself. And about Sherlock,” she adds. “If we’re lucky.”
Steam drifts in from the hallway as John showers in the other room. He whistles some out of tune rock ballad. As always, his apathy for pitch annoys Sherlock; but likewise, his heart bursts with affection for him in all his ignorance.
The haunting music of the pipe organ echoes from every wall. Sherlock doesn't recognise the melody, yet there's a familiarity that resonates deep within him. Buried in his subconscious—something he knows he knows, but doesn't know why. Perhaps it was a nursery rhyme his grandparents sang to him as a boy? A tune from another life, or another universe altogether?
Sarah takes him by the arm. “I know,” she says. “It’s alright. Whatever you need to do is fine. But even detectives need sleep."
By the end of week one, John begins daily physical therapy sessions. His targets are simple at first: basic range of motion, coordination and strength training—but soon, it’s time to try using the wheelchair. With two fractured legs and one broken arm, he requires quite a lot of help getting in and out of bed—but he's thankful for any chance to move about.
There’s an inconvenient lump in Sherlock’s throat that seems to have formed down in his chest. It threatens to work its way upwards and spring out through his eyes, so he squeezes them tightly and swallows hard, just to be safe.
Showing how you feel is often easy. But the feelings don't gain life until you give them a name. And no matter how much you may regret what comes of that, there is no way of shoving those words back into your mouth.
Mycroft can't hide the expression of bewilderment on his face; it fades into a tiny smile of acknowledgement.
Sherlock inhales, feeling warmer still. And before he takes another breath, John is touching him again.
Sherlock fumbles for his phone in his pocket and pulls it out. It promptly flies out of his hands and next to John's head, just as a second text alert chimes in.
“Goodnight, love.” Molly wraps her arms around Sherlock for an enthusiastic embrace. She’s always been an excellent hugger. Before letting go, she stands on her tiptoes to whisper something in his ear. “Talk to John a bit more. I think perhaps he was surprised to learn about some of your past sexual experiences. And he’s quite the jealous type, as you know.”
So he checks in every few hours or so. For the cats and K-pop stars, of course. And if William happens to pop up on her photo feed, John can’t do much about that, now, can he?
“It's fine,” John reassures him. “I have another two weeks or so before the Spring semester begins, and I’ll surely be able to catch up on my studies. But right now, that’s the least of our worries. Let’s just focus on finding Moriarty.”
John sucks in a short breath, unsure of whether he’s shocked, confused, grateful—or all three. “That was you?”
Because John knows this flight of fancy will end after the sun goes down. He knows why, and he knows how. So even as the temperature falls outside and raindrops become snowflakes whispering against the windowpane—John continues to burn.
John slides his tongue over his bottom lip, battling the urge to tell the man off. What he can’t fight, however, is his own gaze as it wanders down William’s body, settling on the white, pristine dress shirt he wears. It’s so tight, it doesn’t fully button; perfectly form-fitting over the man’s lithe torso, hugging the curves of his chest and complementing the ivory skin of his neck. The bartender may be a dick, but John supposes it doesn’t matter as long as he can make drinks.
Sherlock looks at him. He’s bright red, licking and biting his bottom lip, eyes flashing with a desire unrestrained. His expression wavers between tortuous pleasure and wide-eyed admiration.
Gabriela's face is buried into Sarah hungrily, and even as John drops to his knees behind her, they can't be pulled from their own world. He finds it insanely arousing—the two of them, so in love with one another that nothing can break into their cloud of joyous lust.
“Oh my god? Sherlock!” she squeals, reaching over Ms. Smith’s entrails to take his hands. “The two of you confessed your love?!” She jumps up and down with excitement.
John wants to ask William what he means, but William has already taken his mouth away from him, pulling him in for another breathless, passionate kiss.
He doesn’t want to touch John. But if he wanted to, it would be so easy, and he’s ninety-four percent certain it wouldn’t be terrible.
A dear friend of mine, Sergeant Lestrade, led the investigation and handled the press, ensuring my death appeared to be real. My brother, who works for the British government, was able to build a new identity for me and send me to the US. I was to be William Scott, a bartender in Boston. I soon met Molly, Irene, and Mary, who were enlisted by my brother for my protection. Besides their being somewhat of a family away from home, each of them possesses their own invaluable skill. Molly is a technological genius. Irene is powerful and influential among people of a higher status, and has the remarkable ability to get people to talk. And Mary is a skilled weapons artist with a sharper shot than anyone I’ve ever met.
Sherlock tears their lips apart. Touches the side of John’s face. Presses their dampened foreheads together, feels the feverish warmth of John’s skin.
John’s legs can’t carry him quickly enough as he runs past the lengthy driveway. He reaches the corner of the house and turns. His breath hitches.
John hangs up. The girls watch him expectantly. “It's a—erm. It's an escort service. For S&M or...something. It's called The Whip Hand. They have a website."
“And how much time do we have before he comes looking?” John is sure Sherlock is referring to his brother.
John racks his brain. A bead of sweat forms at his brow. He suddenly doesn’t know a single word, nor does he know a single person. "Like Martha!"
William swears at John for torturing him, so John roughly pushes his cock in—but only the very tip. He stills himself for a moment and then pulls himself back out. He drags the cool, silky tip of his cock underneath William’s entrance, above it, around it. Ruts against it until William nearly sobs with desire, begging for John to fuck him.
The tall man purses his lips, narrowing his eyes into a dull, grave expression. “In that case,” he says. “I hope you will heed my warning, Mister Watson.”
On the sixth night of their routine, while they watch television, their fingers interlocked—he gets an idea. Without thinking too much, and without explanation, he lifts John's hand to his mouth, turns it over, and places a kiss to his open palm.
The air in the alleyway behind the restaurant is heavy, still, and silent. Too silent. John’s got nothing to distract him from the flitting of "should haves" and "why didn't yous" in his brain.
Sherlock heaves a sigh of frustration, swooping up from his armchair. “Could you stop doing that?” he pleads.
Molly stares blankly at him for several seconds. Then, she breaks into a fit of giggles. "Oh, boy. I should have paid more attention during organic chemistry! I’m sorry, Sherlock.”
It shuts Sherlock up completely (after he makes an embarrassing noise that he will never admit to making). He lies back and shuts his eyes, focusing on John, and only John, breathing and sighing and trying not to buck wildly; murmuring John’s name as he rakes his fingertips through his own hair.
John stirs in his lap. He yawns, rubs his face for a few seconds, and opens his eyes, allowing them to adjust. As things seem to come into focus, however, they immediately widen with alarm.
His eyes continue to bore into Sherlock. Sherlock focuses intently on a wilting lily. He sort of wishes he could wilt right now.
“Sorry,” Sherlock murmurs. He’s still got to get used to someone wanting him around as much as John does.
But what is practice without performance? That’s the entire point—to convince everyone that one tall, dark, very handsome man and one small, grumpy, very bandaged man are very, very married.
William blinks at him a few times, letting his hands drift to John’s hips. “I must confess...I know exactly what you mean. Earlier, when you appeared...I thought I was going to lose you, as well.”
He doesn’t know where he’s from. If he has a husband or a dog or a child or maybe even a wife. Whether he has any passions, or simply tends the bar all night so he can study all day. Doesn’t know his phone number, or his address, or his astrological sign. He doesn’t even know his surname.
Sherlock laughs at him. "I'm sorry. I would have let you know I was going to do that, but I didn't want to overdo it with the narration."
John wraps his arms around Sherlock's shoulders with as much strength as he can muster, burying his face into the crook of Sherlock’s neck.
Out of John falls a shaky sigh. He doesn’t mean for it to happen; he must have been holding his breath.
John stares at her photo, and she's got that fantastic smile John is so fond of. She still appears younger than her age. But according to this article, she is 23 now, so at least she told him the truth about that. And she's apparently a technological enigma, which she never really mentioned, either. So why the hell would someone so talented and accomplished be a hostess at a bar?
Her gasp of excitement is so loud that she almost bursts his eardrums. "You were kissing, weren't you?!"
"Yes. I like the way it sounds." Sherlock dips his head back, exposing his Adam's apple for John to put his lips on. "Should I stop?"
John chuckles and tilts his head in thought. "Something that can't be replaced, I suppose. Something sentimental. Before she passed, my grandmother gave me a book of Chopin piano etudes she used to teach her students. I promised I'd practice them, but I haven't yet. So I would probably save that."
“I thought so, too. But that evening, Gabriela and I returned home after dinner with friends, and he was waiting on the steps of our apartment building. He was clearly drunk. He told me he missed me, wanted me to come back, tried to wrap his arms around me and kiss me.”
He doesn't think about it for too long. As he walks through the bedroom door, he hears Sherlock coming after him, calling his name while he approaches.
He grins widely. "That’s the fastest I’ve ever gotten drinks from the bar! And they’re on the house! Except for yours, John. William said something about you insisting on buying.”
Sherlock’s eyebrows come together with distaste, forming the wrinkle on his forehead John adores. “Don’t be ridiculous, John. I solve murders, usually by consulting with the police, pro bono. Well, I used to, until I learned that my partner was a murderer, and then I had to die myself, so...” he trails off.
John used to insist against it, because he and Sherlock are not a couple, but he gave up insisting after the third or fourth time. Angelo is the more insistent insistor—and besides, it's generally not advisable to argue with the person handling your food.
The moment she leaves, the tension in the air becomes so thick that John feels as though he may suffocate.
Sherlock promptly closes his eyes. Because it might be the only thing to curtail him from touching John's cheeks, from feeling his body heat, from kissing his scruffy face off.
"Yes." Sherlock clears his throat. The words he's about to say feel oddly and thoroughly pornographic. "That's good, but for it to be convincing, you'll probably need to go further. Rake your fingers through my hair a bit."
That’s when he understands Mary's willingness. Why she would reach beyond her duties to help Sherlock and himself. He nods again. “Alright.”
Once Sherlock and John return to their flat, they remove their costumes and carry out their bedtime routine; it all happens much more silently than Sherlock would like.
John, John, John. Why is it all he thinks about? From the moment John smiles at him and says good morning—with that oddly beautiful bit of scruff growing on his chin—to the moment they drift off at night.
Her lips curve upwards into a smile. “Mycroft may have a flair for the dramatic, but he’s a very good brother. Even though the two of them drive each other absolutely mad, Sherlock is the most important person in his life. And he’s the only family Sherlock still has after...you know.”
Sherlock purses his lips together. Frankly, he doesn’t even care to enjoy John’s heavenly John-scent anymore, so he pushes himself away.
The heartrate monitor is suddenly very loud and very, very fast. The air is thick with an odd, silent tension. They hold onto each other's gazes until Sherlock forces words from his mouth to break it.
With that, John bursts into laughter, and Sherlock forgets that he's annoyed with him. "That's true. Alright, then. My turn. What am I thinking of?"
"What? How could you possibly—?" John throws his hands into the air in a gesture of resignation. "No, you know what? Forget it. I was wrong; you're quite bad at this game."
Next to the counter, John finds a music stand. There's an open book there: Bach Partita for Violin No. 3. Each page is covered in scrawled out notes and personal edits. Beside the music stand, hung over an armchair, is a silk white dress shirt. John touches it. It's definitely William's: he’s seen him wear it. He's seen it as it's slid off William's shoulders and into a pile on the floor. But that knowledge does nothing to prepare him for the name tag pinned neatly over the breast pocket.
John is also very good at saving Sherlock. Too good, one might say. He's saved him so many times that Sherlock's lost count. And though Sherlock doesn't particularly love playing the part of damsel in distress, there's a part of him—deep,
She regards him for a moment, her stern features beginning to soften, and she sets her hand atop his shoulder reassuringly. “His safety is a priority to all of us. As is yours, John. I give you my word.”
“Yes, generally,” Sherlock responds, curled up in his armchair and browsing the web for blood coagulation techniques. “However, it depends. To what are you referring?”
Sherlock cannot believe the audacity of this man and the tea-stained shirt he's wearing for the second night in a row.
John is right. Mrs. Hudson spoke to them as she always does: chipper and loquacious and with a wide and loud selection of opinions—not at all surprised to find them in the midst of an amorous encounter.
He's got so much to lose. What he has with Sherlock is singular and worth keeping. He would give it up for nothing. Well, not
He looks at him the same way he always has: as though he’s the most beautiful thing in the universe. As though he’s hung the moon. As though he's more valuable than all of the world's gold. As though he could easily peer directly into his soul, if such a thing existed.
After Sherlock leaves, John sits silently in 221B, though his head is a mess of very loud, very confusing thoughts.
"Good idea." Sherlock subtly tilts his head until the rogue curl in question falls forwards. "However, I think we ought to practice first."
John pulls himself from Sherlock’s body, quivering with anticipation as he settles on his back. He takes a deep breath, spreading his legs apart, offering himself to Sherlock completely.
He wants to ask Sherlock if he knows how loved he is. Because although his life may have been filled with people telling him differently, those people know nothing about him. If they knew him like John does, they would love him too.
He expects Sherlock to respond with his typical sharp wit and playful defiance. He doesn’t. He meets John's eyes, instead, and doesn't look away.
Sherlock leans his head into John’s neck, his ribs contracting with laughter. “There is only one person in the universe I would risk both influenza and imprisonment for.”
It's not as though Sherlock regrets what they did, though it does scare him. He wonders if John regrets it. He wonders if John is going to stop wanting to share Sherlock's bed with him. He even wonders, for a moment, if he's fled the flat altogether, escaping down the stairs on his tiny, semi-broken legs.
The two men kiss and fumble at one another's clothes until they reach their candlelit bedroom. They collapse into a magnificently large bed, where they explore one another’s bodies with eager tongues and fingertips. They hold each other and whisper words of endearment until they can no longer bear the wait.
"Oh," John breathes, lifting his hands to the sides of William's face. "Hello. I thought I'd lost you." He caresses William’s cheekbones with his thumbs, and at first, William leans into John's touch, appearing overcome with relief. Seconds later, though, his face twists with confusion.
Gabriela begs for Sarah’s tongue, and John slows down his strokes, taking a deep breath. If he’s not careful, he’ll come before they do.
He wavers between the desire to immerse himself into John deeply and swiftly; or to gently sink into his cherished body. He does his best to alternate between the two, and his skin buzzes from a spark deep in his waist that explodes outwards like a firework, sprawls out like a budding rose, and in the deafening silence and blind darkness he could swear he’s seeing stars.
That’s why it’s an absolute tragedy that he’s thinking about William. He’s got a strong sensation that the bartender’s eyes are on them, and have been for most of the night—though he’s somehow refrained from checking for confirmation.
His descent would align magnificently with the Virgin Sacrifice—if John didn't show up to save him. But he does show up. He shows up, grumpy and heroic. He yells at Sherlock a little bit, and calls him an idiot a little bit, and then he yells at Mrs. Petrova (more than a little bit).
“I...” Sherlock savours the taste of John’s lips. “I am. Yes. Very much. As long as it’s alright with you.”
“Exactly!” Sherlock is practically wriggling in his seat with excitement. “Do you think your colleague at Bart’s hospital could get her hands on the lab results of the tissue that tested positive for cyanide? I think it’s worth looking into.”
He rests his forehead against Sherlock’s, tucks his arms beneath his as Sherlock pushes up into him. John pushes down in equal measure, and they hold onto one another, bodies enveloped completely.
"So you claim every day," Sherlock states, but doesn't argue against it—his cheeks burning the bright pink shade John has come to adore.
I’ll never get tired of writing scenes where Sherlock stumbles and John catches him. This is probably my 89th version of it. It’s just so soft, especially when he touches his hair. 🥺🥺🥺
Brook and Sherlock soon become inseparable. They spend most of their spare time together: hours of exhilarating conversation mixed with late night investigations in Brook’s lab, solving cases both old and new. Due to Brook’s prestige in the field, they have a constant incoming of cases, and between the two of them, nothing goes unsolved.
John sets his other hand onto Sherlock’s chest, and onto the protective vest that he wears. Though it’s less of a vest and more of an undershirt. John has never seen anything like it, but he’s sure—
"No need." John brushes his fingertips over the cool skin of his neck. He moves a step closer to him still, and closer, as if gravity were somehow working to pull their bodies together.
“Mmhh. Ngghhhh, Christ.” John bites his bottom lip. He wants to say more, wants to tell Sherlock how he longs to wrap his fingers around his silky, magnificent cock. But he seems to have gone speechless, so he lets his actions speak for him—taking both of their lengths into his hand at once.
They talk about everything and nothing until the sun comes up. Sherlock refuses to sleep, he says, because he doesn’t want this perfect day to end. John kisses him on the shoulder and promises that tomorrow will be even better.
John’s face and neck burn with embarrassment, which is somewhat of a welcome condition in the face of the biting wind. He spins back on one foot to look up at the man at the doorway. “Yeah, hi, William. I was just, erm, in the neighbourhood, but I’m going now.”
Sherlock grazes his thumb over the tip and brushes his lips against John's ear. "Now that I've given you all of me," he breathes, "What comes next, John?"
"Have you ever played Twenty Questions?" John asks. "I feel like you'd be good at that game. It's basically just deducing."
The following morning, John sends Sarah a simple text saying that he thinks they want different things, and that they should end it. She thanks him for his honesty (which John finds laughable) and wishes him the best.
"She would never throw you out,” John says. She'd better not, anyhow. John would throw himself out right along with him, and that's a lot of throwing.
"And earlier!" Sherlock moves to the edge of his seat, giving his friend a sidelong glance. "You complimented me. What is it that you said? I can't seem to recall…"
"Of course." John flattens his palms over his knees. "So. Care to share what's going on in that beautiful brain of yours?"
John’s not completely accustomed to having Sherlock care for him this way—he’s very good at it. Or good at faking it, as the case may be.
“I’m here, Sherlock.” John rakes his fingertips through Sherlock's hair, voice as hushed and soothing as it is certain.
John tucks his hands beneath Sherlock’s buttocks and pulls him in, maneuvering him until he’s settled into the perfect position. Sherlock releases a rattling sigh as he begins to rock back and forth, rubbing the sensitive flesh of their cocks together.
He never, ever thought it would come to this. Poor observation skills were to blame for him not to have noticed John’s love. But as for himself, not realising how madly and deeply in love he is with John—what a fool he’d been.
As he leaves, Gabriela hugs him. And then Sarah does. And then Gabriela does again. And then Sarah joins her, and the three of them hug and pretend they aren’t becoming emotional. The girls wish him luck, and he promises to message them as soon as he figures things out.
I can’t say enough about how important your comments are. I’m no good at responding, but I see each one, and they are what keep me writing. So if you enjoy this, please leave comments—short ones, long ones, simple ones, complex ones. Just one, or one per chapter chapter, or one every two chapters...there’s no such thing as too many.
As the weeks and nights go by, John continues to stay with Sherlock. Because it’s no longer Sherlock's bed—it's theirs. He's got his own side, with a nightstand where he keeps his watch, and his books, and his wallet. He stays not because he needs to, but because he must.
is probably not the answer most guaranteed to grant him passage. So he comes out with the first response he can think of.
Hi! It's no longer Halloween, whoops! Thankfully, John and Sherlock's love can be enjoyed every single day of the year. Also, porn.
With a low hum, Sherlock pulls him closer; nibbling at John's bottom lip gingerly before trailing his tongue over it. John’s lips part, and Sherlock licks into his mouth, commencing a slow tortuous forwards and backwards motion of hips. It elicits a chilled moan of anticipation from John, driving him absolutely mad in the best and worst possible way.
"Your vitals are looking good, Doctor Watson," Gemma chirps. She seems to have blissfully ignored all of...whatever the hell that was. "Blood pressure is a tiny bit low, but nothing to worry over.” She pauses, looking down at her watch. “Hmmm. In the past thirty seconds, your heart rate has skyrocketed."
John feels frustration burning at his eyes as he tries to comprehend all that this young Sherlock is saying. He blinks, and with the flutter of his eyelids, everything around them changes. The empty blue sky suddenly becomes fuchsia, and it contains three golden suns; the grassy meadow becomes an enormous desert of nothing but crystal white sand.
William finally releases him completely, and John feels it deep down in his bones—like the air has been ripped from his lungs. He closely regards the man before him, searching for a sign that he’ll reconsider. And though he’s stopped crying, his face remains blanketed with a stoic sadness—and there’s no question that he’s made up his mind.
“Great plan.” John rearranges his body over his, wrapping him up in his arms. Sherlock notes that John is still fully erect, which will help move the plan along quite nicely. And from what he can tell, all of this talk about
Suddenly, the lights in the room flicker off. Then, back on. He turns his head—a framed photograph on the wall catches his eye. It’s a portrait of a young woman wearing a cap and gown. The inscription reads:
But with a relative lack of homicidal intentions, he’s sure marriage could be quite nice. Two people together—living together, waking up in the morning and doing nothing together until they go back to bed and do it all again. And when they aren't doing nothing, they're probably doing things that are fun, also together, because they enjoy one another's company. They do things that aren't particularly fun together, too—such as shopping and cooking and hosting the occasional guest. Two people—with an unwavering attachment and commitment to each other, who drive each other crazy with an approximate ratio of 11% irritation and 89% adoration (give or take, depending on the alignment of the space globes, or whatever drivel people pay attention to). Two people who, above everything else, are fiercely loyal and protective of one another—and who couldn't imagine life any other way. Not in the present, nor the future—both near and distant.
"Were you planning on staying down there for awhile?" John asks. "Because I had an idea of something we could do to fill the time."
William immediately presses a hand onto John’s chest to push him away, the sadness on his face only intensified. "What are you doing?” he hisses. "What if
“I didn’t go to the bakery this time,” he says, retrieving a bottle of wine from the cupboard. “In fact, I received a call from someone about a special delivery. Something I...you...have been waiting on for quite awhile. So I stopped off on the way home and got it. A bit of a challenge getting it back here, especially without you seeing it. I wanted it to be a surprise, though I guess I’ve spoiled it now. Well, you’ve yet to find it. Anyway, so I hauled the gift onto the tube, and after that, I came back to Baker Street. Wine?”
"Yes." Sherlock offers the box to him. His hands are noticeably trembling, even as John slides the ring on, but John thinks nothing of it. He’s probably just had too much caffeine.
Sherlock stills himself. “It surprises you.” He looks directly at John, but John won't meet his eyes. "It surprises you that I've had sexual experiences with other people, because I have always said that I'm not interested in sex. You know that closeness is what I am interested in; therefore, it also surprises you that I wasn't in love with them."
“So let me make sure I’m understanding this correctly,” John says. “Your psycho ex shows and tries to stir shit up with you. But you and Gabriela fight back like some sort of vigilante girl gang. And once it's all over with, in a completely unrelated move, you fall on your arse and end up in hospital.”
“It makes no sense. No sense at all,” Sherlock laments. “Anderson is a moron; Donovan is insufferable. And yet I’ve had only semi-pleasant exchanges with them since arriving at the party.” He purses his lips thoughtfully. “Could it be a Halloween miracle? Are they performing a prank on everyone? Might they have endured simultaneous concussions? Surely, this is a mystery that will require a bit more research.”
John shifts in his armchair, visibly uncomfortable. “Y-Y-yeah, I… heard you the first time, but, erm..." he sputters. “The solution to
“If someone wanted to get you to William..." Gabriela asks. "Why wouldn’t they just...take you to him?"
But tonight, as nervous as he is, he's thankful for Sherlock’s gift of gab. And he’s even more thankful when Sherlock gently retracts his fingers from his wrist and weaves them between his.
"I think a drink might be good for you, Sherlock," he concludes. "It would be healthy for you to relax and have a bit of fun. Besides..." he pulls himself from the floor. "That floor must be murder on your spine."
, John? Did he not run from you as well, and beg you not to follow him?” Moriarty snickers. “And here you are, the both of you in danger.”
Sherlock nods slowly as it becomes clearer what John is saying: his unwillingness to discuss Sherlock's past is rooted in fear. Fear of returning to a state of anger and confusion. And it dawns on him as well that back then, many of his own actions were rooted in the same denial.
He thought of John then. He thinks of him now. It’s obvious that John Watson is the best person in the world. How could anyone argue otherwise?
Sherlock's expression grows more and more bewildered, and John does not blame him one bit. "Since when do you call her that?"
If we aren’t convincing as an atomic couple, we may as well just be singular atoms running off to form bonds with hydrogen...or oxygen!"
He certainly didn't seem bothered when the two of them arrived and discovered that there was only one bed in the cabin. He offered to sleep on the floor, but Sherlock refused to allow it.
After that, Sherlock says nothing more on the topic. He simply gazes openly at him, as though he’s waiting for him to say something profound.
There are two layers of clothing between them, but John clenches at him, begging him to rut harder, hoping that somehow he will penetrate him. So William slides his hands down to John’s knees and grips them firmly, spreading them as far as they will go, pressing against him relentlessly; and their mouths and tongues slide together as they gasp and groan in between the filthy words escaping their mouths.
"My point is: I didn't care." Sherlock raises his head to the sky as a single star peeks out from the clouds. "John, you challenged my beliefs, and I didn't care, because I was happier than I'd ever been. I didn't know what was happening, and I can't tell you exactly how and when it happened. I only knew I wanted more, and that I wanted you."
And it's not the first time he's thought of these things. He's thought about them many times—even before they were fake married. But back then, it was a fleeting curiosity that he fully suppressed. He had no choice. Nothing could possibly come of such a fruitless desire. But tonight, John's presence has disarmed him. And the sounds that he makes as he kisses Sherlock back—low moans and rumbles and delighted hums—only serve to disarm him more.
"From milking cows. Your dead man—he was a farmer." Sherlock raises his eyebrows, quite pleased with his conclusion. "It seems he was working out in the field mid-afternoon while temperatures were high. Put a wet towel on his neck to avoid becoming overheated. Didn’t work out—it got caught in his tractor, thereby asphyxiating him.”
"John's in there," he thinks, equal parts eager and apprehensive. He takes a step towards his bedroom, imagining John's form fitting shirt and the scruff on his neck.
“I’m...simply trying to figure out why you seem suddenly...different, somehow. Did you hit your head?”
The man responds with a catty lift of the eyebrow, and he sighs dramatically. “Let’s cut to the chase,” he says. “What is your relationship with Sherlock Holmes?”
“Sherlock,” John continues softly. “Do you realise how much better my life is with you in it? I've never told you, really. But yeah. You...made me feel alive when I was nearly dead, you know? And you bring me joy every single day. Even on the days I want to wring your neck,” he laughs. “You...make me very happy, Sherlock, and I can’t quite imagine my life without you. I don't think I want to, actually."
“I’m asking you to order a drink,” William responds matter-of-factly. “Where you choose to go with said drink is of no interest to me.”
”Thanks,” Molly says after they’re able to compose themselves. “It’s nice to hear that. Easy to forget that sort of thing when you’re constantly around other brilliant people.”
"I don't want to think about it." Sherlock jerks his head away, unbothered by the pull of Moriarty's unrelenting grip.
“Perhaps not. Neither should you. You can't simply allow someone to force you into a life of exile."
Sherlock crooks one eyebrow before he continues, taking a step forwards between John's legs. When he crouches down, the errant curl trickles out over his forehead.
Molly holds the envelope towards John. “He entrusted me with it,” she says. “Therefore, he trusted me to make the best decision. And I truly believe this is it.”
Sherlock pauses, gazing down at John. The candlelight flickers on his skin; his cheeks are a deep red, and his lips a dusky pink. His forehead is drenched with sweat, and his formerly combed-back hair has become unkempt, strands of it sweeping down his face.
“I apologise for startling you,” the man says, though the unveiled amusement in his voice says otherwise. “No need to worry about my brother; he’s stepped out to get a cup of tea for you. He will return shortly.”
Their breaths are loud and fast from the exertion of holding John's body up. John thinks he might be sweating; he's most definitely turning red from his cheeks to his neck to his ears. He feels Sherlock flex his biceps two or three times, whether out of nervousness or to hold John steady, it's not quite clear.
"Which was at The Strand...where my wallet was." Sarah's eyes grow wide. "Holy shit. Do you think someone intentionally pickpocketed me just to make sure you found that book?"
,” he says. “Sometimes I wish you could see yourself through my eyes, you know. How much you’ve grown in the past two years. Even after all this time, your brilliance never ceases to amaze me, Sherlock. You're so invaluable, both in your talent and your friendship. I feel incredibly fortunate to experience the joy of both.”
Moriarty flashes his teeth with amusement. “What I have described as madness, you have just described as death. And look at us, facing the consequences of our poor decisions here, together. We are truly are alike, Sherlock, are we not?”
“Yes." Sherlock stops breathing, which means he should probably call the paramedics, but whatever. "Yes. That.”
It’s two in the morning, and thankfully, everyone decides that’s the final question: the game ends up a draw between Molly and Anderson.
“It’s simple. Everyone holds up five fingers. We all take turns confessing something we’ve never done before. Any person in the room who has done that thing puts down one finger. Last person to remain with fingers up is the loser.”
"John." Sherlock hovers over him timidly, unsure of whether he's welcome to take the seat beside him.
the most blatantly obvious source of information—William’s dear friend, and an actual employee of The Strand.
“Were you planning on ordering, or did you choose to sit here because it makes your voyeurism more convenient?”
Lestrade purses his lips together, nodding thoughtfully. "Well. That's a surprise. But you can't blame me for assuming it's been longer, you know? You're practically already married. Always together, making lovey dovey eyes at one another, giggling like school boys. It was quite obvious from the very start that you were mad about each other, no question."
Sherlock blinks a few times, silently stunned. He looks at Molly in awe, then to John, then back to Molly, and finally, he takes her by the shoulders.
“Of course. I’m sure I’ll even pick up a few things we can try.” And they kiss. With tongue and everything.
John walks down the driveway, deciding he’ll let himself cry once he’s returned to the car—not a second before. He doesn’t want to risk Sherlock overhearing him. So he chokes back his emotions, reaching for his phone and any distraction it might provide.
John chuckles softly. "As appealing as it sounds to have you...scoop me up...We can’t have you getting hurt as well.”
Doctor Molly Hooper, receiving her diploma upon commencement of her PhD. Molly was featured in Time Magazine's
But as much as he loves these two women deeply—and would do anything for them—the bond he shares with John is different. Molly and Mrs. Hudson are his friends. They're his family. John is his friend, and John is his family, and his home. And his comfort and his peace, and his conductor of light, among so many other things, countless and nameless.
“Legend has it,” Sherlock says valiantly, “...that kissing tall, handsome geniuses on All Hallows’ Eve will protect one from the cold, bony grasp of death.”
Upon seeing the gorgeous dark red succulent, a flood of nostalgia takes him. “My grandmother had one,” he says. “I’ve always been fond of them.”
John seems sure, according to the card lying on Sherlock’s nightstand. But love is a fickle thing, so is he
"Yes, that would be more convincing," John agrees. Starting at Sherlock's temple, he glides his fingertips across the side of his scalp. He then returns to his temple, repeating the action again, and again, and again.
William lifts John’s body to his, spinning him around and laying him over the bathroom counter. John’s head falls back like a ragdoll’s; he grasps desperately at William’s shoulders, digging his fingernails into his skin. William steadies him in place, sinking his hips into the seam of his trousers, his hardness creating warm, magnificent friction.
He wants to kick himself for being a complete idiot. After how little he knows about Irene, why hadn’t he considered the possibility that she could be dangerous? Especially given Sherlock’s state of mind, and their strange disappearances. God, he’s been completely blinded by love, and now, he’s gone and endangered his friend.
And there John is. All of him. He sits upright, his bedsheets tangled at the foot of the bed. His skin is dewy and glowing and freshly showered; his hair tousled and damp. The only thing he wears is a thin cotton towel draped over his waist.
Towards the end of the second week— after constant prodding from John, and Molly, and Lestrade, and Mycroft, and Mrs. Hudson, and according to Mrs. Hudson, "God himself”— Sherlock finally agrees to take a case. It's on a Saturday evening just after dinner. He makes his way to Ealing to help Lestrade with a matter of missing persons. He solves the case in four minutes and locates the persons in another seven. It takes over an hour to get back home in traffic.
For a very short time after the incident with Mrs. Petrova, John doesn't experience much clarity. The events that immediately follow are quite muddled. He’s in and out of consciousness, and there are noises and lights and voices, and it’s difficult to tell what’s real and what’s a dream.
Although they've kissed countless times before, this feels like the very first. It is, in a sense. It's John, and it's Sherlock, and it's
"She was a brilliant shot, but an incredible moron,” Moriarty continues. “What sort of bodyguard isn't even aware that her client wears a protective vest? Jesus! It's such a rookie mistake. Am I right, Sherlock?"
Sherlock smiles. He holds John closer, basking in his warmth. He was not at all expecting have an enjoyable time tonight. Thanks to John (and a little bit of pot) (but mostly John), it’s been lovely. And if this is what every Halloween, every occasion, every day with John will be like, he will gladly keep him around for all of them.
“Morning,” John says, envisioning a million good ways and bad ways Sherlock could respond to a single word.
John spins around to find Sherlock standing inches away, looking down at him, holding John’s scarf in his hands.
Sherlock lays his head back on his pillow. And with John next to him, the cyclone in his brain fades into a light breeze on an autumn afternoon, bright from copper leaves.
“He’ll probably… get you drunk on Bud Light and try to convince you that the Metric system doesn’t exist.”
Molly holds a hand up to intervene. “Right. Let’s fill John in on this little detail fist. John...” She looks back over to him. “Irene, Marci and I don’t just work with Sherlock. We sort of...work
“But those things never actually happened. It can’t be a memory, Sherlock, if there’s nothing to remember.”
“Yeah?” John’s embarrassment quickly turns into excitement. “Do you think I could come along with you to Bart’s, then?”
William’s breath hitches. His body becomes tense, but just as quickly, he relaxes into the kiss with a deep, deep sigh. He allows his mouth to fall open as John’s tongue sweeps in. With another heavy breath and a surge of electricity, he wraps his arms around John’s body, scoops John up into him, holds and kisses John with all he has left in him.
John continues to stroke Sherlock’s hair. “It’s my first time being a boyfriend to someone who means so much to me. What do you say we learn it all together?”
John's lips are stunningly soft. Sherlock enthusiastically categorises his taste, categorises his scent—even more heavenly when paired with the moans that rumble deep in his throat. It's all overwhelming and insane and wonderful. And though John may be the most unobservant man on the planet, as the kiss becomes more heated, he seems to know exactly what Sherlock wants. He nibbles at his bottom lip, presses his lips to his neck and jawbone, and makes him feel things he didn't know he could feel. A desperate longing he's only heard of, a pulsating beneath his abdomen that his body barely recognises. He never could have guessed how much he needed this—John's mouth on his—god, how could he not have known? If someone had told him three hours ago that he would be kissing his best friend, he wouldn't have believed it for a second.
Sherlock tightens his grip on the stem of his wine glass. "Everything! Take, for example, the way you're dressed. It's quite odd."
“Incredible,” she breathes. “Good god, Miss Gomez, you can fuck. But now that your tongue has made me come more times than I can count, I’ve got to ask you something. Did you think I wouldn’t notice the microphone behind your ear?”
Lestrade nods, opening the car door to exit the vehicle. “But as I’m sure you know by now, there’s much more to the story. We can go into more details later.”
Before I continue, perhaps I should reintroduce myself. My name Sherlock Holmes, although you know me by another. And a bit over two years ago, I died.
The man coughs daintily into one curled up hand. “Do you love him, Mister Watson?” he asks, reaching for a glass of water.
John believes her, and he believes he’s made his own point quite clear. So he leans in to kiss the top of her head, much like Sherlock had done before. “Thank you.”
Supplementing logic with texts from the Bible—it’s something Brook would do, though he knew it carried no weight with Sherlock, an atheist. And Sherlock would prefer to keep Moriarty out of Brook's memories.
"Yes." Sherlock takes John’s hand into his and slowly guides it downwards. "How very observant, you are, Doctor Watson,” he says as he moves it further to the space between his legs. "...Where it counts, anyway."
“I can’t believe you’re here!” she responds. “I’ve missed you!” She leans away from him, her arms gripping his sides, her eyes brimming with tears. “You good?”
Sherlock clears his throat. "Pardon?” He definitely heard him. But for John’s sake, he will pretend he didn’t.
John watches Sherlock leave, and he makes his way to the sofa so he can plop himself down and wallow in self pity. He stares wistfully at the closed door of their flat—pining for Sherlock, and pining for adventure.
“Sherlock may have started off as an assignment,” she says as Gabriela takes her hand reassuringly. “But he’s become more than that. He’s my friend, too. And at all costs, he must be protected. How am I supposed to sit idly by as the man he loves digs the both of them into a deeper and deeper hole?”
John grips firmly at Sherlock’s hips, and he lightly digs his nails into his flesh. Sherlock groans lowly and backs himself up into him, forcing him to go more deeply, until he brushes against his prostate. “John,” Sherlock sighs. “Deeper. Deeper, oh god,” and John skilfully and relentlessly pumps into him. “Yes, like that. Christ, John, you’re so deep, deeper than anyone has ever been before, oh God—“
As Sherlock watches him, he’s pretty sure he’s wearing the most ridiculous grin he’s ever worn in his life, but he doesn’t care, because he’s
The melody of the pipe organ returns, and it's all Sherlock can hear. He allows his eyes to fall closed as he immerses himself in the music.
John decides it’s time to give in. He takes a deep breath and swallows stiffly, vaguely hoping that the confession will become stuck. It doesn’t.
Sherlock bites his lip to keep a moan from escaping. He doesn't know if it's part of the plan for him to be enjoying this so much.
With this, the center screen flashes back off. The two outer monitors simultaneously turn on, displaying the same bright red lettering:
John is relieved and proud that he makes it as far as he does—but just before they reach the bed, he hits his breaking point, and his legs give out completely.
They arrive at their hotel around half past three. It’s quaint and carries historical charm, set among a broad street of casinos, vendors, and American-style diners. The furniture and walls are definitely aged, but their room is far larger than John had expected—more of a studio flat than a hotel room.
She waves him off with a dismissive hand. “It was the life I chose to live, and if karma repays me, so be it.”
Blah blah blah blah blah. John continues on about something uninteresting, but Sherlock isn’t listening; he’s got a million other things on his mind at the moment. Of course, the bakery was simply a hypothesis based on John’s known habits. But it doesn’t even register with Sherlock that his assumption was off the mark.
“I was barely able to walk when we went on our first case together, but you didn’t seem to care back then.”
William is visibly relieved, but he continues to shield the vodka shelves. “Noted,” he says thoughtfully. “Belvedere isn't a poor choice, but may I suggest the American Star?” He pulls a tall pink bottle from the shelf and twists off the cap. “It’s infused with chiles, and it goes down with a smooth, smoky flavour. Perfect for a Bloody Mary.” He dips his forefinger into the bottle and holds it to John's mouth. "Try it."
John would surely not want anything more. He's too busy going out on dates with other people. And although John may care for him, he definitely doesn't have romantic feelings towards him. He's never even brought him flowers. And apparently, flowers are an important step in forming a romantic attachment.
"Actually, your explanation was nonexistent.” John folds his arms over his chest. “You think you can just spring something like this suddenly and expect me to play along? That’s not how it works, Sherlock. Sex between two people... it shouldn’t be used simply as a means to an end.”
He doesn’t stop to breathe until he notes the befallen look on William's face. He sighs, continuing a tad less harshly.
Beyond their bedroom walls, all of their lingering glances become furtive; their smiles become restrained. Beyond the walls, John ignores every buzz of sensual magnetism between them. He tears his eyes away each time Sherlock's standing close enough to puncture him with his gaze. Ignores every desire to hold Sherlock's hand when their knees graze together beneath the table.
Miraculously, they watch the movie to the end. William pretends not to cry. When John wipes a tear away as evidence, he simply grumbles that Irene ought to become better at removing dust from the shelves.
"I've had practice." Sherlock is unable to resist impertinence, even in the eyes of death. He's referring, obviously, to the fact that he's been pretend-dead for two years—but he tries to shake off the strange vision of himself on the rooftop at Bart's.
John pats him on the back, passes over his card, and leaves him to fend for himself. “Yep. That’s the one. Cheers.”
Carefully, he lays Sherlock onto his back once more. Sherlock keeps his legs wrapped tightly around his waist, and he whispers into John’s ear that he loves him. John whispers it back as he presses into him inch by inch.
Mary reaches over John’s lap and takes his hand. “I'm certain he knows. But you’ll have the chance to tell him very soon.”
John chuckles softly, rubbing small circles at Sherlock's jaw. "No need to be sorry. It's just..." he pauses.
"I know that it's been a long three weeks," John says. His eyes fall to the floor, and Sherlock immediately misses that soft blue gaze. "But I don't think there's anyone else I could have done this with. If I had to be isolated with someone, I'm glad it was you."
"Right?!" Donovan says enthusiastically. “Fantastic idea, actually.” She then turns to stare at John, admiring his wires and foam balls for a tad bit too long.
That every night, while they’re in bed, his fingers burn with the desire to reach over and touch him.
John is certain he’s real, this time. He’s hunched forwards in a chair with his head on the bed, his cheek flat against the mattress. He’s snoring. John thinks he might be drooling as well.
He checks his phone. It's three in the morning, and he’s got a text from an unfamiliar number. He places it face down onto the bed, because he already knows what it’s going to say. And he needs just a few more seconds to live in a world where that message doesn’t exist.
John’s eyes fly open at the sudden absence of William’s warmth. He’s not entirely sure what’s just happened; all he knows is that he’s insanely aroused—and insanely confused. He frowns at William, who simply looks back at him expectantly.
“Yes. I like that idea.” Sherlock‘s voice and breath become rough as John presses soft kisses to his neck. “You mean like Christmas and Easter, right?”
He squints; the photograph is somewhat blurry, though he’s positive it’s the Molly from The Strand. He’s also positive she told him she’s 23 years old and a current PhD candidate at MIT—yet, the caption states she has already obtained her PhD.
She tilts her head to one side. “Yes. Well, partially. I had help.” She swallows. “But please don’t ask who helped me. I won’t tell you.”
“Don’t apologise,” John says. “I've only got one working hand, apparently. Might as well be doing something useful with it."
She squeezes his hand. “Sarah says you can, as long as she’s allowed to watch.” She lets go of his hand. “It’s ultimately up to you, though." She stands. "I’m going to return to the sofa, get on my hands and knees, and eat out my girlfriend. You can stay here and watch for as long as you’d like; or you can join me on the floor and watch us while you fuck me from behind."
John is hard in his pants. God dammit. A cocktail waitress walks by and offers him a drink, and he quickly waves her off with an embarrassed “No thanks.”
John receives about a half dozen text messages on the day of New Year’s Eve. Two from his sister, one from Mike, a flashy one in Mandarin, one wrong number.
believe that you could take him. But...he’s a powerful man in the industry. I’d seen the way he dealt with people he felt wronged by, and...he made their lives hell. I didn’t want to risk it.”
They exit the scene. Lestrade is probably calling out to him, but thankfully, Sherlock is fluent in ignoring him.
He has never kissed John like this; with the throbbing desperation of wanting to give him everything. Every part of him, every piece of the universe that the universe will allow. To hold him. To make love to him. To be his.
John thinks about kissing for the rest of that evening, even when they find the criminal and handcuff him and turn him in to Lestrade.
"Bed," he instructs, and he guides John into their bed, works on removing John's shirt, on pressing his lips against every piece of John's upper body he can get to. His collarbone. His sternum. One nipple, and the other.
Sated by their release, they collapse into their carseats. They elect to put on their clothes, and Sherlock rests his head in John’s lap; John kisses his temple and whispers sweet words of affection. They weave their fingers together, their eyelids growing heavy, and they sleep for the remainder of the drive.
It’s their third kiss, yet somehow still different from the first two; it’s chaste, heartfelt, and short. Heartfelt and short, like John.
John actually fears he may become overheated and melt into a puddle from Sherlock’s simple, barely-there touch. But Sherlock, thankfully, doesn’t seem to notice how awkward he has become. Even better— he doesn’t pull away. Neither of them do. And although John is hot, hot, hot—he is frozen in place, and couldn’t move away if he wanted to.
Sherlock smiles down at him, the unbridled fondness in his eyes boldly apparent, even in the dark. “Watson." His voice, barely above a whisper, tickles John’s mustache. “I would kiss you right now, but I fear I may become ill as well. And who shall take care of you then?”
"Death. Madness. Love. It’s all the same—do you see that now, Sherlock? It’s all the same.” He drops his voice low, breathing into Sherlock’s ear: “It was all. For. You.”
“For now,” comes a miffed voice from the other end of the room. John glances over to see Irene seated at the edge of the bed, wearing a satin robe, her arms and legs crossed. Clearly, she’s far less excited to see him than Molly is.
Sherlock's mouth drops open so far it practically hits the ground. He drops his water bottle as well. It does hit the ground. It hits the ground with a loud clattering sound.
"Ha! Funny." Lestrade stares at the two men, waiting for them to acknowledge the humour in it. "Oh. You're serious?"
“Yes. I assure you. None of it is real.” Sherlock reaches his right hand to his ring finger and tugs the ring off. “So you’ve got nothing to worry about. Now will you please just shut up about it?” With that, he drops the ring into the pocket of his trousers.
Stamford looks at the card, and then he looks over to William. “That bloke? The one who walked directly off the catwalk and into his evening job?”
“That’s a lovely necklace you’re wearing,” Sherlock remarks, noting the tiny crucifix hanging from a gold chain around Brook’s neck. There is an inscription on it:
The world seems to fall away. The room turns impossibly still—even with murmurs of hospital sounds in the background. John's fingers skim back to Sherlock's shoulder, back up his neck; then to his jaw and over his cheek, where he tucks his hair back again. Then, his hand falls away.
John averts his eyes, trying not to stare at her like a creep. But he notices dozens of other pairs of eyes on her—including Sarah's—so he doesn't feel
“I’m fine.” Sherlock bends over to retrieve his phone, deliberately not meeting his eyes. “Just saw some disturbing news about...” he pauses, desperately trying to recall any news article he’s scrolled past recently. “About dung beetles.”
The earpiece booms in John’s ears. He hears Gabriela scream again just before the sound goes off. He rips his earbuds out, throwing them to the ground as he runs “No. Gab!”
It was probably a terrible choice to yell at her. It was definitely a terrible choice. But he doesn’t have much time to reflect on it before the woman slaps him across the face, hard, and everything goes black.
And the moment he does, memories pour into his mind—if that’s what they can even be called. They aren't
It’s far from the first time he’s woken up rock-hard and drenched in sweat after dreaming of William—but it’s the first time since they ended things.
She crouches down in front of him, reaches across his lap, and sets her hand over the one he’s got wrapped around his cock.
His heart skips a beat. He’s immediately astonished by how unguarded William seems to have become. His aloofness has been overtaken by melancholy; his face twists with regret.
“Oooh,” Gabriela says with amusement. “Wearing sunglasses and a sports cap at the penny slots. You sure you haven’t been to Vegas before?”
"I love that idea," Sherlock says, plunging his tongue back into John's mouth with a keen sense of urgency.
They practice kissing in the morning at the foot of John’s bed, John’s legs wrapped around Sherlock’s waist so he'll stay upright. They practice in the afternoon at the entryway as Sherlock goes to leave. (Though intended to be a brief goodbye kiss, this often requires multiple run-throughs). They practice kissing in the evening as the television plays in the background, until their evening kissing practice pours into their bedtime. And at bedtime, they practice kissing each other goodnight; lips and fingertips practice roaming over each other’s scalps and necks and shoulders until they fall asleep.
“And the same goes for the backup pistol she left in the limo." He pulls a second gun from his coat pocket. "Though I'm sure she didn't think I'd use that single bullet to kill her." Carelessly, he tosses both guns to either side. John knows they're both likely empty, but he throws his body protectively over Sherlock’s, and in doing so, knocks him over as well.
“Um, sweetheart.” Sarah reaches across the table to take John’s hand. “Have you forgotten that’s she’s, like, in Las Vegas?”
“You stopped in at the launderette earlier.” His eyes snap open. “After that, you visited the bakery at the corner, where you ordered a cherry tarte. You ate half of it and gave the rest to the stray dog that sits outside of Speedy’s Cafe.”
Sherlock slowly moves himself downwards over John's eager body; trails his tongue over his sternum and ribs and past his abdomen. Over his navel, to his hipbone and inner thighs, over his thick cock and heavy testicles. Settles in, spreading John's knees apart and plunging his tongue into him without warning.
"Good one," Anderson continues. He turns his head to Donovan, who sits besides him on the sofa; both of them are dressed in a steampunk getup. "I wish we'd thought of that one!"
They step out of the car and onto the tarmac. Gabriela welcomes them with a hug, followed by some egregious winking and congratulations for what sounded like a very pleasant car ride.
But instead, Gabriela turns to face him. He feels like a voyeur being caught—but strangely, that does nothing to hinder his arousal.
"Mmhmm." John rests his elbow on the table and his head in his hand. "Good thing she did that. You’ve only got a dozen more, all completely identical."
“Aaaahhh. Joh-" But before he can finish his thought, John surges forwards, sealing their mouths back together. He licks into Sherlock’s mouth without mercy as Sherlock writhes against him, and neither one of them is being delicate or tender anymore.
John traces the letters of William's name with his fingertips. "William," he whispers. "Where have you gone?"
“It’s alright, Sherlock. I know you, and I expected this. There’s no hurry. And if you’re never ready to approach the topic, that’s fine as well. We will still be friends, if that’s what you want.”
"No!" John chuckles. "I mean, yes. Yes, I want to do that. But you're wrong. I am so proud to be yours, and I love that everyone knows. I
What a question. What a question that’s completely normal to ask, but that John and Sherlock have not planned for at all.
John rocks into him with all of the speed and force that he can muster, and that’s when Sherlock tells him he loves him.
"Good." John releases a warm breath against his ear. "Because I need to tell you that you've never been more gorgeous than you are right now."
They kiss until they fall asleep. And if it’s the last time, neither of them acknowledge it. They kiss without desperation or longing. They kiss sweetly and slowly. They kiss as though they’ve kissed a million and a half times. It’s entirely possible that they have.
After he takes a moment to collect himself, Sarah appears besides him, handing him a blanket and a glass of water.
Mid-afternoon, they fill bowls with stale popcorn and settle in front of the television. William adamantly refuses to watch sports, but only half-heartedly refuses to watch
Sherlock switches off the light on his nightstand and the two men settle in. The room becomes blanketed in silence, dim city lights coming in through the window. They lie on their sides, facing one another, and Sherlock again finds it impossible to look his friend in the eye.
“You’re so lovely that it’s actually painful to tear one’s eyes from you. I know; I speak from experience.”
She joins Irene on the sofa and they continue with a few minutes of small talk. Gabriela seems to have a way of narrating what’s going on without making it seem awkward or out of place, and John is thankful for that.
The man opens his mouth as if to answer, but he quickly decides against it. "Let's cut to the chase. What is your relationship with Sherlock Holmes?"
(His third mistake, apparently—though Sherlock refuses to answer for Stravinsky's sweeping interpretation of the bassoon's chromatic range). He finds her just before intermission, during the climax of Danse de la terre, on the third floor next to a row of xylophones.
His girlfriend, Sarah, in a booth near the opposite side. A man wearing an expensive suit has his arm around her shoulder. She laughs as he whispers something into her ear. John briefly doubts his own senses; but even in the dark, he’s certain it’s her. And he can’t look away, though he wants to—especially when her eyes fall closed and the man brushes his lips against her neck.
The air is pregnant with words at the tip of their tongues, but their kisses continue tucking them away. They kiss in silence, their arms and legs entangled in the crisp bedsheets. John can't help but let his mind wander. He hates that things are going to change.
"Yeah?" John says this with the precise combination of surprise and relief Sherlock predicted. The question causes the first beat of hesitation in him since they awoke, but he doesn't stop driving their bodies together; doesn't let go of Sherlock, doesn't stop pressing warm kisses to his neck. "Alright. That's..." he quickly gives up searching for the words. "...yeah. Good to know, I suppose."
"No," she muses. "You're not really the flower type, are you? And I suppose John knows that, since he's in love with you."
Sherlock stretches his arms and sets the palms of his hands onto the bed. He lays his head onto them and peeks up at John expectantly.
“No!” Molly laughs. “God, please do not use my prior relationships as reference. There’s a reason I took time from dating. I kept attracting losers—and neither you, nor John, are losers. You are both fantastic and both very lucky.”
“Indeed.” Sherlock grins, playfully pinning him back to the wall with a happiness he can’t contain. “Which leads me to ask—would you mind showing me that last...technique...one more time?”
“I know what you’re thinking, pet.” Moriarty turns away from the skyline. “But I assure you, John Watson will come.” With his clownlike grin, he begins to slink towards Sherlock like a hungry tiger.
John shoves his phone into his pocket, his eyes stinging with tears. He blinks them back harshly. A refreshing winter breeze blows in, and he tilts his head back as it passes.
When the kiss is finally broken, Sherlock doesn't release his grip on John, but he releases a heady sigh.
Perhaps I should reintroduce myself. My name is Sherlock Holmes, although you know me by another. And a bit over two years ago, I died.
He swallows thickly before speaking—John wonders if he’s holding back tears. “When we first met, I am aware that I was quite rude..."
The lights are shut off at Baker Street when Sherlock returns at a quarter to midnight; it appears John has not waited up for him. Not that Sherlock expects him to, of course—but there's a melancholy part of him that wishes they were able to carry out their evening routine of talking for hours. However, if they did, and they sat in bed and talked and talked and talked, chances are, they'd end up talking about last night.
Three weeks, by his estimation. It's been three weeks since the blizzard; three weeks since he and John became stranded in this horrible cabin in the woods. Sherlock doesn't mind the isolation, of course—but he's on the verge of going mad.
“He didn’t tell us—for our own protection,” Irene finally speaks up. “He doesn’t want us coming near him until he’s sure the danger has passed.”
John momentarily loses his senses. He also loses his grip on the book, and it slips from his fingers, falling to the floor with a loud, echoing thud.
“Interesting. It must have felt strange for you to go from a religious upbringing to a career in science.”
“Do you remember when we made love in our Victorian flat? Or on the sofa at Baker Street in Central London? Or inside the tiny cave in Ancient Greece?”
“You’re welcome. I’m really, really happy for you, and I know it will all sort itself—“ she looks back up to see Sherlock dialing John’s number on his phone. “What, you’re calling him now?”
What good would it do him to be honest? He’s got what he needs for tonight: closure and a dozen kisses from a pretty, mostly sober girl. And he tries to convince himself that he’s only imagined the look of disappointment flashing over William’s features—which becomes much easier as it dissolves into an icy glare.
Sherlock’s eyes fall closed as he releases a rattling sigh. It's wonderful. He feels tingly and happy.
"Got it." John grins at him as he tosses his trousers to the ground. And just like that, he is completely naked. Sherlock swallows and takes it all in.
"Dangerous," Sherlock repeats. A gutting realisation fills his chest. "This is my fault. I shouldn't have brought you with me."
Sherlock carefully ties the scarf into a knot. Once he’s finished, his eyes raise to John’s. “When have I ever been simply polite?”
It's a good thing John's lips are suctioned to Sherlock's neck, because Sherlock is so startled that he nearly leaps up from the table and launches the smaller man towards the source of the voice.
Sherlock swallows. “Yes. Because, you know...” His gaze falls to John’s fingers around his wrist. “Your head is precisely the level at which I can smell your hair. Rather difficult not to. Lavender, by the way. New shampoo? Also, you’re quite short, John.”
“I completely understand what you mean.” John takes her hand in his. He finds her openness refreshing. “And you know what? You can’t help who you love. This is just further proof of that.” He squeezes her hand lightly. “I mean, what sane person would choose to fall in love with men? Because when it comes to relationships, men can be fucking nightmares.”
He pulls his body from the floor, chest heaving, fists clenched with agony and rage. He hasn’t stopped shedding tears; although he knows Sherlock is alive, his heart has yet to catch up.
Gabriela sets her elbows onto the table, batting her eyelashes at him as she rests her head in her hands. “How will you reserve the booking?”
Sherlock is not the least bit pleased with John’s antics this evening. Although he is severely lacking in the observation department, he is quite gifted at being completely insufferable. He just wants to
Neither of them seems to know for sure, but the answer appears to be: nothing. So they simply continue lying there, soaking each other in with every one of their senses.
“I’m fortunate to have met Mycroft,” she continues. “And that he believed I could change, and offered me this mission. I’m certain I’d be locked up or dead, otherwise.”
His vision is blurred from tears. But as he glides his fingers over Sherlock’s chest, he finally feels it: a tiny bullet. It’s lodged into Sherlock—
John straightens his back, clenches his fists, and gives the man his most solemn glare. "I could be wrong," he says in a low, threatening voice. "But I'm pretty sure that's none of your god-damned business."
"Sherlock," John rumbles deeply as he kisses him back. “Sherlock, Sherlock.” And Sherlock’s name in John’s mouth is more divine than any religious artifact, more marvelous than all the mountaintops in Africa.
Gabriela laughs gently. “You were out like a light. You’ve got a bit of drool, there. Would you like a tissue?”
Sherlock's throat tightens and he lets out a rattling sigh. This is probably his new, even more favourite thing to do with John.
The move surprises John, but in an undeniably pleasing manner; he curses through clenched teeth before he releases another low, rumbling moan.
“Of course!” Sherlock grins widely and pats the open spot on the bed next to him. “No sex, John. None. Not even a tiny bit.” He’s very proud of himself for not laughing as he says this, because there will, as they both know, be heaps of sex.
It’s the most incredible thing in the universe, this love they have. Perhaps the most incredible thing in any universe.
Gabriela drops her skirt and underwear down to her ankles and leans backwards into the wall. Sarah falls to her knees, pulling Gabriela's hips forwards and her knees apart before burying her face into her wet opening. Gabriela tosses her head back, sliding her hands up to her own chest, pinching her nipples as Sarah licks and sucks and tastes her.
John grits his teeth but doesn’t look away. Unfortunately, Mycroft may have a point. Sherlock has avoided sentimental attachments for as long as John has known him. As far as he knows, it’s been in the name of the work—but John’s had suspicions that it may be more complicated.
And John wears shining armour quite well—but even John's armour gets dinged up on occasion. These are the times he's
“Oh! Good morning, Doctor Watson!" the woman says cheerfully as she walks over. “Good to see you awake. I'm Gemma, the nurse on duty."
”John. You’re amazing and I love you,” she sniffles. “And I’ll remember what you said. I promise.” She reaches her hand up and ruffles his hair. “But only if you promise to live by those words, too, yeah?”
On day two, he concludes that trying not to think about William isn’t doing him any good. Perhaps the solution is the exact opposite: to think over the situation as much as possible in hopes of gaining some understanding of his own frustration.
Mary's grip tightens around her knees. “Quite a lot, I suppose. My own role in this mission, to begin with. But I’ve already risked a lot by simply getting you here.”
Sarah, Gabriela, Irene and Molly sit in a circle on the floor, hands joined, laughing and whispering conspiratorially. After Vegas, the four of them quickly became inseparable. The day they returned, Mycroft insisted Sherlock remain under protection, and Sherlock insisted on enlisting an attorney and a medic. He wouldn’t take no for an answer, and that’s how Gabriela and Sarah officially became part of their team.
It isn’t even two full minutes before Stamford returns with a tray full of drinks. As he sets it onto the table, the girls oooh and aaaah with appreciation.
But when he wanders into his usual cafe that afternoon for his usual study session, he encounters something...not usual.
about this. He ruffles his own hair in frustration. “It has been four months and sixteen days since you’ve had sex with anyone, and your hormones and your sulking are so tangibly
John exhales another shaky sigh, turning his head to kiss Sherlock softly on his inner wrist. "You say you've never had anyone want you the way I do. But that isn't true. It boggles my mind that someone so observant fails to notice how utterly captivated others are by you."
At first, Sherlock regards both of them with an eerie calmness. “He goes with me.” His eyes flash with determination, and his voice is steady as a rock. “This is not open for discussion.”
"I actually had the opportunity to volunteer at a hospital there," John explains. "Years ago. After completing medical school."
The car comes to the end of a small cul de sac. A house sits before them, taller and surrounded by far more green than the others. On its side, there is a row of small, wooden chests.
Sherlock feels light-headed and a bit out of breath. Something stirs deep in his stomach; he prays it’s something he ate.
“Did you mean what you said earlier?” John’s need to know has grown more powerful than his own pride. “To Mycroft?”
And so there they are: just two pretend husbands sitting quietly together on a hospital bed. Just the two of them, Sherlock and John. And John's glowing skin. And John's bewitching abdominals. And one very thin towel, which is probably too small to actually count as a thing that's there.
Sherlock is safe and protected by his loved ones; that’s another reason to be grateful. And John loves Sherlock, and Sherlock loves John, and there is nothing that can come between them—of that, John is now certain.
Apparently, it takes a lot of energy to bask in the glow of being fake newlyweds, because that’s exactly what he does.
The room grows warm; warmer than Sherlock can stand, and he finally pulls back from John to take a moment to breathe.
Sherlock says nothing further; he walks swiftly towards his bed, toeing off his shoes on the way. He collapses onto the mattress, shuffles his body next to John, and wraps his arms around him—just to make sure he doesn’t leave.
"Then I can only assume your hesitance is out of concern for me. But please don’t be afraid; I'm not as breakable as you think.”
“Sherlock is absolutely right,” he says steadily. “We were pretending. One hundred percent.” He looks at Sherlock. “But it’s over now.”
John listens in as Gabriela greets Irene enthusiastically. He can hear Irene’s reciprocal response, the kisses to one another’s cheeks. Gabriela offers her a drink, and she accepts; they continue idle chit-chat as she prepares it.
John chuckles, but only responds by giving Sherlock’s upper arm a light squeeze. Sherlock mourns the days of yore, when he would simply argue back.
"Mmm. Yes." Sherlock rubs his hands together to create heat. "Could it possibly be due to the fact that it's cold and wet where I'm standing?"
John’s not okay. What Sherlock just did and said was particularly jarring. But thanks to years of military service and his time as a doctor, he’s very good at
John stands at the foot of the bed, and as he watches Sherlock, the fierce military man instantly melts away. Warmth and happiness bubble up in Sherlock’s chest. John looks different now, he thinks. His hair is mussed, his cheeks are flushed, and his eyes are lakes of royal blue. He looks gorgeous. He looks loved.
John moves on, ignoring her comment. “...and your job is to protect Sherlock. And he fled Boston, so you followed him. And that’s why The Strand shut down.”
“Not yet.” Mycroft, perhaps out of nervous habit, begins to dust off the sleeves of his suit jacket. “It’s our assumption that he moved underground. We will continue to survey the area heavily until he resurfaces.”
He holds his gaze as he makes love to him, his eyes wide and dark, and he tells him that his joy feels absolutely infinite. That there is no greater pleasure than being buried deep inside John’s body, that he loves him more than he ever thought himself capable.
This is their first time kissing outside of Baker street—it feels raw, amorous, and sort of dangerous. And though it’s urgent and brimming with passion, Sherlock has many new sensations to catalogue, so he thoroughly intends to take his time.
Less than a metre away is the moonlit silhouette of Moriarty, staring pensively over the edge of a building and into the night. With a chillingly precise awareness of his surroundings, he speaks even before Sherlock stirs.
Amongst their noises of blissful adoration, Sherlock becomes increasingly grateful that it's past Mrs. Hudson's bedtime—otherwise, she'd definitely overhear. Knowing that John prefers stealth over style, he smashes his lips into his in order to stifle his moans. And for good measure, he smashes his body closer as well.
He hears footsteps on the staircase within seconds. "John, are you alright?" Sarah and Gabriela come through the door.
In the past two weeks, he’s learned that being John’s boyfriend is quite immeasurable in O-SHIT terms. If it were measurable, however, he estimates it would be somewhere in the realm of nine hundred billion trillion quadrillion.
"So what's John's knob like?" Molly asks casually as she places a heap of tentacled seafood onto her plate.
"When I was seven years old,” he says, “my parents dragged me along to a conference in Holland. I was completely uninterested. On the day we left, it was like pulling teeth just to get me into the vehicle. But they promised to take me to any museum in Amsterdam that I chose. I begrudgingly agreed.”
one of John's pretty body parts. He mentally scolds himself for being so perverse, and fills his head with unappealing images.
It's a cool evening, half past something or other. John tends to lose track of time when he and Sherlock are in bed together. Tonight, Sherlock's eyes are a shocking shade of blue-green, glowing aqua like the clear waters of the Aegean Sea.
He’s right. It is important to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes. Sherlock considers what he knows about married life. His parents are happy in their marriage, but he was always too busy pursuing his own interests to study their behaviour. The only other source of knowledge he has comes mostly from his cases—where at least one party wants to/may have/definitely did kill the other.
"Your impertinence is tiresome. We're leaving," Sherlock announces, taking John by the arm. "Let's go."
The room erupts with sounds of pleasure. Sherlock bucks up into John, clenching around him with everything he has. John hardens his abdomen, slowing the rush of pleasure while gathering all of his strength to push back. Sherlock uses his legs to pull John in deeper, deeper, until they find a rhythm that works for the both of them, graceful and passionate as dancers on a stage.
The way Sherlock feels as he slides into John's tight, warm, perfect heat—the throbbing, aching pleasure—is something he's never even imagined. Something of dreams, of fantasies, ridiculous things only poets write about. Every sensory cell at his disposal is buried into the most wonderful and beautiful human he’s ever met. How on earth did he become lucky enough to even know this man, to become his best friend, to share a bed with him?
“John, I’m—“ He leans away, his eyes wide. His hair is gorgeously mussed; his cheeks are flushed and damp.
to say. That Sherlock’s the most treasured person in his life; and far more treasured than any person in his past. That he's never known anyone kinder or wiser.
But he has a network of dozens of people, as I came to learn. And somehow, my new identity got back to him, as well as the fact that I am alive. Upon receiving this news, my first thought was of how I would never be able to say goodbye to you. I was nearly ruined by the realisation—but then, there you were. At the doorstep of The Strand. And it was Christmas, and I sensed how desperately we needed one another.
As he climbs to the top, he comes to a room. It appears to be a living quarters of sorts. There's a small bed and a tiny refrigerator in front. Against the wall, a couple of large shelves, filled to the brim with books. On the other side, a counter, littered with crumpled-up scraps of paper and various scientific instruments, including a fairly state-of-the art microscope.
“I’m not going anywhere,” John murmurs. He reaches his hands up, softly cupping the back of Sherlock’s head. “I know you believe that your loneliness will protect you, but it won’t. Just look at all of the people in your life who love you."
Sherlock peeks out, slowly lowering his hands. "Alright," he says with caution, taking his own glass from the table. "Cheers. To what are we toasting?"
Besides, both of them are brimming with the urgency of pining for far too long. So with the same lack of grace they've displayed thus far, they wrestle and tug at one another’s clothing until they’re both completely naked.
Before John can even make it past the threshold of his hotel room, he’s got an armful of tiny redhead wrapped around him.
Sherlock realises he's collapsed onto the bed besides John. He opens his eyes and squints--though for some reason, John appears quite blurry. "Yes," he responds. Why wouldn't I be?"
A shiver runs through Sherlock's body at the sensation of John's hands on him. It's like nothing he's ever felt. John is warm. John is soft. John is safe.
"Christ," he laughs breathlessly and sighs, allowing his body to relax. "You are a wicked, wicked man."
“Just the one time, after I learned he was in love with me. I mean, I suppose we didn’t sleep that much. We spent a lot of time kissing.”
So he takes William’s head into his hands and kisses him tenderly, his chest aching with a clear, deep affection.
“Oh, fuck.” John leaps from his chair, knocking over a tray full of quarters, sending them pouring to the ground with a loud pitter-patter. He ignores it, making his way towards the elevator.
Gabriela lifts her arms and laces her fingers together behind her head, giving Sarah free reign of her body. She takes note, massaging her chest through her shirt, flicking and squeezing and twisting her nipples until they grow visibly hard.
“John,” he murmurs, the first coherent thing to come from either of their mouths since they fell into the bed.
He doesn’t say this aloud. Where would he even begin? What are two people to talk about when they’ve got less than ten minutes before they part ways indefinitely?
John continues to kiss him wherever his lips will reach—he’s so very relieved, so happy to be holding him, and he’s not going to let him go.
Brook suddenly snaps out of his haze, familiarity settling over him. “Sherlock! Jesus, where are my manners?” His voice is coloured faintly with the warm cadence of an Irish accent. “So sorry. I was in my, uh—brain attic, if you will. It sometimes takes a moment for me to come out of there.” Rising from his desk, he extends a hand in greeting.
"Hold on to me very tightly," John instructs. "I need you to promise me. Hold as tightly as you can, and do not let go for any reason. Do you promise?"
Sherlock knows he came to the kitchen for a reason, but he can’t recall what it was. He’s certain John will be the death of him in one way or another.
Breathing together on purpose. Breathing together, not on purpose. Falling into a happy, dreamless sleep.
But there is one constant; one unwavering truth: in each one, their lives are shared. Sometimes it's for a great deal of time, sometimes not. But they always, always, always find each other.
Irene returns, wearing the same dress she arrived in, and the three women make towards the door. As Irene passes John, she pauses, leaning in to kiss him on the cheek. “Take care, darling,” she says. “See you soon.”
Sherlock places his hand beneath John’s chin and lifts it upwards, kissing him softly on the lips. He then leans away from John, cupping his face in his hands. He beams down at him. “John.”
Sherlock's eyelids drift shut, and he exhales another shiver. “I will never grow tired of the way your body reacts to my lips alone.” He rolls his hips into John’s, showing that he’s every bit as erect. “Come along; I will give you the rest of me.”
John, for as long as I live, I will find comfort in knowing that you and I can raise our heads to the sky and be looking at the same stars. And somehow, I know that I will find you again, be it in this lifetime or another.
She goes on to warn him that her story isn’t particularly a happy one, and asks if he’s sure he wants to hear it. John’s hands are shaking from nerves and his mouth is dry, but he’s sure.
They solve the murder in less than forty-five minutes, and on their way back, John takes Sherlock into an alleyway to kiss him until the stars come out. Days later, with the sound of fireworks and Auld Lang Syne fading into the background, he kisses Sherlock at midnight.
“On the rocks. Bitters, sugar, orange peel garnish. Why wouldn’t I?” William pulls out a glass and begins skilfully mixing the ingredients.
"No. I trust both of them implicitly." Sherlock releases the embrace, leaning back to gaze at John, and he notes the sad expression from earlier has returned. He decides he doesn't like it one bit, and then decides he's going to kiss it away. So he shifts forwards, bringing their bodies closer.
Grudgingly, Sherlock pulls himself down from his seat upon the table and follows Brook from the laboratory.
My world became unsteady. I was plagued with guilt and grief and confusion. Though I knew without a doubt that he was a deplorable, vile human being for what he’d done, I wanted it not to be true.
“I want you to handcuff me to the bed,” he hears Gabriela moan. “Blindfold me. Wrap your legs over my legs, and rub your clit against mine, over and over, until I’m just about to come. Then ride me with your wetness, sliding it over my naked body until it reaches my mouth.”
Yes. This is very good. Kissing is good. Talking is boring. Who needs talking, anyhow? Kissing is a far more enjoyable use of their oral cavities.
“Oh, god.” John’s grip on Sherlock's back tightens; his body goes stiff. “Oh, fuck,” he curses. “God, yes. I love you. God, Sherlock. I love you.” A deep rumble escapes from his throat, and he pulls himself hastily from Sherlock just as he begins to come.
“I—can’t thank you two enough," John says. "After I quite literally ruined your lovemaking session—“
John nods, though Lestrade’s answer does very little to alleviate his anxiety. Sherlock, observant as ever, wraps his arm around his shoulder for comfort. John lays his head on his chest, and they ride the rest of the way in silence.
“Shut up!” Moriarty roars, his voice softening again in the words that follow. “There are rules. And we must play by the rules—we wait until sunrise.”
Neither of them could ever imagine what it would be like to fall or fly without the other. And now they will never need to—not in this life.
“Not foolish at all!" John blurts out. Apparently, he still knows a couple of words. He takes another drink of wine, hoping it may lubricate his vocal chords.
Even better—his pretend husband, as promised, helps care for him whenever he can. This is how John inadvertently (though perhaps, fatefully) learns that Sherlock is stronger than he looks. It also (definitely fatefully) leads to their first of many kissing rehearsals.
With a strained grunt, Sherlock spins the two of them away from the bed and towards the adjacent wall, setting John down onto the bedside table. "This will be better," he explains as he tries to catch his breath.
John swiftly sets his phone onto the table and takes Gabriela’s. “Oh my god. The long black hair..the ruby red lips."
John downs the rest of his Old Fashioned, and they head out the door into the frosty mid-afternoon air. Hand-in-hand, they race down the snow-covered roads.
William fumbles with John's trouser buttons. “Removing your clothes, in a darkened swimming pool.” He tugs them apart. “May I?”
John's lips part, and William tilts the glass, carefully pouring the drink into his mouth. John swallows it down, and it's exactly as delicious as he imagined it would be.
"Of course, John." William purses his lips together; his mouth twitches. “If I missed your wedding, I could never forgive myself.”
John feels like he's missing something. His eyes wander from his phone, to Sarah, to Gabriela, and back to Sarah. “Wait. You’re okay with that?”
It all feels like a singular movement. The bag of ice falls to the ground. Sherlock reaches for John at the foot of the bed, pulling him into his lap. John wraps his legs around his waist, and their mouths find each other, starved for one another’s taste—hot and sweet, desperate and longing.
"I don't know. My mum would make them for us when we were kids. Became a comfort food, I suppose. It's not bad. You should try it."
He sits up, his head throbbing. Dizzy, he reaches up to touch his fingers to his sore, swollen face.
He soon finds himself in front of room 201. He pauses before the door, and the bronze numbers tower before him, and he begins to question his own sanity. Briefly, he considers turning back—but decides against it.
He maneuvers and guides John until they are in perfect alignment, and John slowly sinks down until Sherlock is buried inside him.
“Sounds really lovely.” Sherlock stares at him for several seconds before responding, appreciating a side of John he's never seen: childlike sentimentality.
Until he walks into The Strand the night of Stamford’s birthday—and sees William, bent over the bar, wearing a white cotton shirt and dark jeans that perfectly display the curves of his beautiful arse.
She holds up her forefinger, signaling for him to wait, and she whispers something in Gabriela’s ear. Gabriela nods, reaches over her, and takes John by the hand.
His imagination takes him through every imaginable scenario this night could bring—good, bad, better, worse—but it doesn’t really matter, as long as he can see William just one more time.
The two women look across the table at one another and burst into laughter. Mrs. Hudson links her arm affectionately through Sherlock's. "Oh, don't worry, dear. We're just happy for you. Anyhow, as your landlady, it's my responsibility to know everything that happens beneath my roof."
John smirks, strengthening his grip on him. Without warning, he spins their bodies, pulling him from the sofa.
John watches her shift continuously in her seat, nervously wringing her hands. A former assassin, he thinks, though she's not being candid.
He has absolutely no plan, but he knows he’s got to see William. He's got to try. He can’t give up, not without one final chance to be with the man he loves.
Sherlock proceeds to make a gagging noise. "From the bottom of my heart: no. And please...don't make me food. Ever. Again."
"What is that supposed to mean?!" Sherlock leans towards her with a look of intimidation, arms crossed over his nucleus.
The sound of his name alone sends John. His thrusts gain speed. Sherlock is an observant man; he notices his effect immediately. Nuzzling against John’s ear, he playfully whispers his name again, holding onto the vowel until it becomes a moan.
“Do you remember when you and I were in the field of dandelions, and you taught me about our other lives?”
Both of them have settled into their own shared routine in the evenings: Sherlock brings dinner, they sit down and watch television—which John enjoys, and Sherlock pretends to enjoy for John's sake, but only because they get to hold hands. After an hour or two of this, Sherlock lays his head on the bed and John puts his arm around his shoulders. He tells him nice things and kisses the top of his head and runs his fingers over his scalp until they fall asleep.
"Your faith in me is much appreciated, as always,” Sherlock says. Then, without warning, he heaves John’s chair forwards at full speed.
Their days largely emulate life before John's injury, the one clear difference being that John no longer goes with Sherlock on cases. John is not thrilled about this arrangement. He misses the adrenaline; the marvelous experience of watching Sherlock's phenomenal genius-at-work as he solves a crime. Alas, he’s had no luck trying to discuss it with Sherlock, who is quite masterful at diverting the conversation elsewhere.
Sherlock gasps as his body goes stiff, tears stinging his eyes, and he pours his love out into John. John is so utterly awed and overwhelmed by his beauty that he can’t seem to catch his breath; without warning, his cock pulsates and he comes as well, untouched.
“Yes.” Sherlock finds her reaction puzzling. Why would Molly Hooper be so profoundly happy about the two of them being in love? “Apparently it’s been the case for some time. Who could possibly have known?”
John undoes the first two buttons of Sherlock's collar. He kisses his clavicle and shoulders; he slides his tongue over the pulse point on his neck. He nibbles at his jaw and at his earlobe, murmuring words of affection.
William suctions himself to John’s body, claiming that he produces more heat than a furnace—so he’ll have to share. John wraps the two of them tightly in their cocoon of linens until there’s not a hair’s width of distance between their skin. William thanks him. He presses the cold tip of his nose against John’s neck, and he presses his dry lips to John’s throat. They kiss inside their cocoon until their cheeks are flushed with heat and their skin is drenched in sweat. The silent room is filled with shivering sighs as their cocks grow hard, sliding luxuriously together until the two men are overwhelmed and overheated.
William lays his head peacefully on his stomach and murmurs a sleepy good morning. His voice fills the emptiness in John’s chest, and the pain seems to disappear. And when he touches John, all of his loneliness fades into a barely-there memory; a brief chapter in another person’s story.
They stand frozen, knowing that if they cross this line it can’t be uncrossed. So they breathe steadily, waiting for permission or a reason.
The nurse never comes that night. Apparently (though perhaps, also, fatefully), there was a mix up with the shifts. Someone definitely got fired over that little mishap.
"William did imply that he was in danger. And given...well, I don't think William's even his name. Perhaps he took on a false identity to run from whatever the danger is, or was."
"I presume you're referring to your bitterness at the notion of sharing me with others," Sherlock says reasonably.
Ignition startup, engine on, blast of the heat. Reverse, turn the wheel, drive. Silence, small talk, stereo on. Street sign, stop sign, tick-tick-tick of the turn signal.
Sherlock removes his tongue and draws it over the smooth skin of John's testicles as he presses one finger into him. He twists the finger, twists his tongue over the base and head of his cock until the area is wet with saliva and pre-come.
Sherlock is completely gone, though his heart soars. He takes John by the shoulders to kiss him, soft and lazy. He sighs happily, and rests his chin onto the crown of John’s head, and listens to the buzzing hospital noises around them.
John groans, rubbing his temples harder as if to revive the memory. “I was...in the casino… and a woman slapped me…”
“You already are.” William takes a ticket from his billfold and slaps it onto the counter. “How will you be paying?”
The phone rings and goes directly to voicemail, and in his message, John pours out his entire, whisky-drenched heart:
John places another kiss there. And another. And another. Brings his lips to the shell of Sherlock's ear. Releases a warm exhalation that causes Sherlock to shiver.
John pulls out his skin-tight dark denim trousers, a soft burgundy jumper, and brown leather boots. He teases his hair a bit, applies a whisper of black eyeliner, and spritzes on his second most expensive cologne.
"Absolutely. But before we do that—" John sighs. He knows he's got to tell him about leaving. He may as well just come right out with it. "I just wanted to, erm.”
So he lets Sherlock kiss him, slow and lazy. Lets him brush his tongue against his as John brushes his fingers through the curls at the nape of his neck. (They're his second favourite group of curls, after the errant ones, of course, which he tucks away for Sherlock as often as he can).
John’s lungs are actually probably imploding now, and he really needs to sit down, because his knees have gone weak. But he doesn’t. Instead, he breathes in more cold air and hears himself calling out William’s name. Feels his legs carrying him down the alleyway behind the building. Feels his hands, banging and pulling on the back door.
William follows her, still saying nothing—which drives John mad—and continues on with whatever task he was doing previously.
William tilts his head upwards. His eyes are wet with tears, and he clears his throat as if he may choke on the words. “I’m afraid I have fallen quite deeply in love with you.”
He wanders through the downtown area aimlessly for quite some time before he reminds himself that he ought to call a cab.
John's eyes fall below Sherlock's neck. His shirt hangs off one shoulder, unbuttoned, exposing the smooth glow of his skin and the collarbone that peeks out above it. John can’t stop himself; he releases Sherlock’s chin, tracing the collarbone with his fingertip, dragging it up to his neck and back to his jawline.
“Delicious,” Sherlock says with an appreciative grin. Still clutching onto John’s wrist, he glides his tongue over his bottom lip to collect the sticky bits of buttercream that remain.
When John stirs a few hours later, Sherlock rises from his chair, tugged by the urgency to be closer to him. As John's eyes slowly come into focus, he sees Sherlock, and his face lights up with a smile so bright it could recharge the sun. He opens his mouth to speak—but he's too exhausted to produce a sound, so he beckons for Sherlock to come nearer.
"Sherlock." Brook says his name gently, as if he's worried it will break. He opens his mouth to speak further, but the kettle begins to whistle. So he steps into the kitchen to switch off the stove, and doesn't say more.
He returns moments later, and shortly thereafter, the psychiatric specialist visits. Coincidentally, she's someone John knows from his undergraduate program.
Sherlock inhales deeply, reflecting his deep, deep annoyance. He also notes that in the past ninety seconds, John's pulse has begun beating quite quickly, and that small beads of sweat are forming at his brow. And that he’s compulsively licking his lips, as though they’ve been covered in an addictive mixture of cocaine and chocolate and honey—the same evidence John always exhibits when he wants to have sex with someone. And unless John has suddenly formed an attraction to newspaper ink, Sherlock is entirely sure he wants it to be with him.
John stands before an antique mirror, wearing a grey bespoke tuxedo. His black shoes are almost unbearably shiny, and a sprig of dried lavender is pinned to the collar of his jacket. He stares at his reflection, fully knowing that he’s looking at himself, but the man he sees feels unfamiliar. The dark skin around his eyes has grown far more prominent, and his hair is cut very short, embedded with wisps of grey.
He has already theorised, based on circumstantial evidence from the past two weeks, how much John loves kissing him (a lot); however, he was not quite prepared for how much John loves kissing him after he's solved a case (
Molly’s face lights up, her heart suddenly in her eyes. “Yeah, he’s pretty fucking amazing, isn’t he?”
John doesn’t break his gaze, even though it burns him. “It’s like you said earlier. I suppose I just needed a drink.”
John tugs at Sherlock’s curls to tilt his head back, and Sherlock whimpers at the loss of the kiss. But he soon forgets as John places wet, open-mouthed kisses onto his neck, and his collarbone, and his Adam’s apple, and his shoulders, sending waves of electric currents through his body.
John’s on top of the world. He’s got William’s attention—not that he cares, of course—and he’s about to take a pretty girl home.
Sarah takes his other hand, and John happily follows as the two women lead him out of Sarah’s crowded apartment.
Sherlock smiles at him, and the corners of his eyes crinkle, and John’s heart races. “I would have been fine without it,” he says.
But John doesn't seem to mind. He shuffles his body closer to his, and Sherlock holds his breath without meaning to.
The two women glance at one another, and they seem to have an entire conversation without using any words.
“And beautiful, and mysterious, and captivating. As I said...it captures your essence. Though I’m still slightly confused about what it is you actually do.” He gestures towards the scientific equipment. “I’m assuming you don’t use this stuff to brew beer.”
“Oh.” A smile settles on Molly’s face. “That’s cool! I’ve met Sarah a few times at the bar. She’s pretty great.”
Sherlock's glad that he did the crazy thing and lied to the medics. This is what he's most certain of, above everything else.
And it bloody well is. His encounter with William is the first thing on his mind when he awakens in the morning. And when he makes his breakfast. And when he takes out the rubbish. And when he showers—especially when he showers. It’s the first thing on his mind as he collects his textbooks and school bags and walks to the cafe to study. And as he orders his regular tall soy latte, and as the couple sitting next to the window offer him their seat, and as he opens up his anatomy textbook to his favorite chapter.
So it continues: John and Sherlock caught in a state of limbo. Somewhere between fantasy and reality, between friendship and love, between the ring on John's finger and the ring that is not on Sherlock's. Somewhere between the day and the night, between the blankets and the walls—they've unwittingly orchestrated a second act.
“God, John.” Sherlock’s fingers scrabble wildly over the sheets to grasp onto anything they can. “I’m already so close, I—Ohhhh.” He can feel it in his whole body, the trembling sensation, like the rainfall before a flood.
Some say that while a person is experiencing a traumatic event, time slows down—even stops. But today, for John, time disappears. One second, he’s in front of the house, and he hears a gunshot—
“Noted, and already forgotten.” John glares across the table, standing tall, his shoulders wide. “And if you continue to fuck with me rather than letting me go,” he utters, clenching his fists to his sides. “...
Sherlock bends downwards to kiss him again, but they're both smiling so wide that the attempt is wildly unsuccessful.
“Yes! We’ve met. He was here yesterday as well.” Gemma grins and nods at him. “Quite the supportive husband you’ve got there! Could I grab your arm to take your blood pressure, dear?"
The girls sprawl out onto a leather sofa, and John sinks down into a large armchair across from them.
unforgettable. A New Year’s Eve threesome with two gorgeous women? That’s a tattoo he’d gladly wear.
Sherlock circles his arms around him, pinning him back onto the couch. He seals their lips together once more, hoping the message is clear. Somehow, this kiss is different from the first. It's slower, lazier, warmer, steadier. Warm and steady, like John.
They practice kissing in the morning at the foot of John’s bed, John’s legs wrapped around Sherlock’s waist so he'll stay upright. They practice in the afternoon at the entryway as Sherlock goes to leave. (Though intended to be a brief goodbye kiss, this often requires multiple run-throughs). They practice kissing in the evening as the television plays in the background, until their evening kissing practice pours into their bedtime. And at bedtime, they practice kissing each other goodnight; lips and fingertips practice roaming over each other’s scalps and necks and shoulders until they fall asleep.
They make love, right there on the hard floor, and it's sweaty and awkward and beautiful. And they climax so urgently and simultaneously that it almost feels like a single orgasm rather than two.
At first, Sherlock assumes this must simply be another one of John’s darling marijuana-induced rhetorical questions—but once he follows where John is pointing, he sees otherwise.
She unwinds her arms from John, and another high-pitched squeal comes out of her. “You called an Uber for me?”
Sherlock appears too exhausted to argue. He takes John lightly by the arm, guiding him to the vehicle—but Mycroft holds up a stiff hand to stop him.
when he's tipsy. He’ll go on about one topic until you’re sure there’s nothing left to say—and somehow, he’s able to drag out many false finales before the end.
He places kisses and small bite marks on John’s neck, continuing this rocking motion. He spreads John’s legs further apart with each one, bucking his hips with so much force that John wonders if their trousers will be ripped open.
He folds his arms around her and pulls her in, hugging her gratefully. “There’s just one more thing,” he adds.
Upon entering the motel room, Sherlock and John murmur with approval. Thankfully, regardless of how the outside of the motel appears, the quarters are quite nice. There's an enormous bed, and there's a shower—god, John can’t wait to shower.
He’s thankful, now, that she didn’t; still, he'd been livid with Sherlock for driving her away. Of course, that was before he followed him to the bathroom for their secret rendezvous.
John allows himself to enjoy Sherlock’s touch, and probably more than he should. Probably more than he ought to, considering the pain he’s in as he stubbornly climbs the stairs with his only partially healed limbs.
"No. I understand why you did it.” John looks at him so sweetly that his face would probably melt if it got rained on. “And considering I'm likely stuck here for at least a couple of weeks...I'm on board with pretending to be married if it means you get to stay as much as possible."
The look of utter reverence he gives John can barely be put into words. He bites at his bottom lip, breathes steadily, and begins to push himself in.
"Because you already know me better than anyone else." John turns his head towards him. "And half of those things you figured out on your own. So I’m not really sure what you
"Yeah? Well—” John clears his throat. Sherlock’s not wrong. “Alright. You've got me. I'm actually impressed. You did amazing, Sherlock,” he says as he admires the band. “The ring is perfect. Thank you.”
John's eyes fill with such deep affection that it nearly takes Sherlock's breath away. And he thinks he might detect a hint of moisture forming, and...
And suddenly, William’s body is crowded against his. He towers over him, peers down at him; his racing exhalations hot on John's neck.
“Who’s that standing next to you in the picture?” The man looks familiar to John: long nose. Thin lips. Condescending glare.
As he and Gabriela take a taxicab to their hotel in the old downtown district, John notes that Sin City is somewhat less lively than expected. It seems more of an expansive desert metropolitan area than a city of flashing lights, but Gabriela assures him that nighttime will be much different.
"Sorry. What? I—" Brook watches Sherlock as he makes his way to the kitchen and turns on the tea kettle. "It's the middle of the night. I was sleeping. Just...give me a moment to catch up."
John stops scrubbing. He decides his effort to remove the stain is pointless, so he tosses his shirt on the sink and spins to face William.
And even if it’s not—Sherlock doesn’t know what to do with this information. It swirls in his head like a cyclone, picking up pieces of debris in its path: questions such as “why?” and “when?” and “how?”
When he returns, Sherlock sits quietly at the foot of the bed. The look he gives him as he approaches is so tender that it steals John’s breath. But he carries on with his caretaking, bracing Sherlock’s chin and setting the bag of ice softly on his cheekbone. Sherlock winces again at the shock of the cold, and John chuckles at how innocent, almost childlike he seems.
"Do not compare yourself to John. He is a hundred—a thousand times more human than you are, and I will always choose him over anyone and anything, including my own life."
John wanders in and towards the back, although it feels as though he's treading through sludge. Clothing is strewn about the room. Teacups and plates on the floor in front of open cabinets, as if someone left in a hurry.
William's presence in the room is overwhelming. Though he may not be there physically, it's somehow undeniable.
John dissolves into laughter; he never tires of how adorably clueless Sherlock often is with basic biology. "Don't think we'd see any geese, either." He glides his thumb over Sherlock's waistband. "But if we did, I'd definitely need to protect
They celebrate next Christmas at The Strand, surrounded by everyone they love. Mycroft and Lestrade are tipsy and holding hands beneath the corner table—though not as furtively as they seem to believe. Stamford and Elizabeth dance slowly to jazz music, their eyes sparkling as much as the ring he put on her finger the day before.
Sherlock backs away, using every inch of effort he has not to cry out in pain, but John just glances back down at his utterly boring newspaper.
With no mobile service and no John, he was left to scour some Cosmo-whatnot magazine. There was an article he skimmed through with the title:
John smiles, sighing with relief. "Yes. I'm well. And you?" The formality of their words causes John to ache. His fingers twitch at his sides, eager to touch him.
“Have fun, you two,” Sarah says a bit wistfully. “Wish I could go, but there’s no way I can take off work with such short notice.”
And while nothing beats being on a stakeout with John Watson, what they're doing tonight isn't half bad, either.
“Alright.” Sherlock thinks John shouldn’t need to do anything alone now that he’s got him—if that’s what he wants, however, that’s what he’ll do.
In him, there is a void—a hollowness that can’t be put into words. He is not plain—but his smooth, childlike features are offset by his stern jaw and soulless onyx eyes. He’s slight, but his shadow stretches across the garden like the legs of a spider.
But when John and Sherlock are having dinner, the sun begins to set over the Thames. And the candle's flame always casts golden waves across Sherlock's skin, and John always looks. It's one of his favourite parts about dinner with Sherlock: that he's allowed to look for as long as he likes without finding a reason.
They fall asleep married. They wake up, just John and Sherlock. Flatmates. Friends. Partners in crime.
“Sherlock’s brother,” Molly explains. “He’s the one who enlisted the three of us. He’s a sort of...erm...government…” she stumbles over her words as if she’s forgotten them. “A… government something or other.”
Sherlock takes his reaction to mean that he can continue. He kisses John's palm a few more times, and then he kisses him on the inner wrist even more times. He trails kisses up John's arm and to his inner elbow, and when John doesn't protest, he follows the opposite pattern, kissing his way back to John's palm.
Mycroft opens his mouth to protest, and this is where Sherlock breaks. He lunges forwards, twisting his fingers into the collar of Mycroft’s suit. “
“No. No, not at all. We’ve got a half dozen cases right now, and we will continue to take more. It’s just one investigation, my friend. And I’m looking forward to seeing what you make of it.” He smiles at him reassuringly.
John takes one tiny step. “I’m...I'm going to sit next to you on the bed now,” he explains. “But it's just so that I can see.
He utters these words, his body still trembling through his orgasm; and then he repeats them, the words a hot gust of breath in John’s ear.
But Sherlock is already sliding off of his lap and onto the floor, kicking his trousers over his ankles. John inhales sharply, clutching onto Sherlock’s shoulders as his lips slide effortlessly over his cock.
"Since always!" John's nerves are causing his brain to go completely haywire, and his mouth is not far behind.
Both hands are on his shoulders, rubbing slow circles with his thumbs, and Sherlock can feel the tension falling away almost instantly.
John circles his arms around Sherlock and rests his chin on top of his head. “I like you the most, too.”
“Yeah. I—” he stammers. “I’ve been waiting on the sofa since you left me there twenty minutes ago. I would have checked on you sooner, but I promised you I wouldn’t go anywhere.”
John begins to come, fast and hot and completely untouched, spilling himself onto Sherlock’s stomach as he calls out his name in return. “I love you, Sherlock,” he says. “I love you with everything I am, everything I always was, and everything I ever will be.”
“Oh, John.” Sherlock’s chest clenches, and he can't resist the urge wrap his arms around John’s waist, pulling him in for a tight embrace. "Nobody has ever told their family about me before."
When the second gunshot rips through the air, Mary’s mouth falls open. Blood rips from her chest, and she gasps as her body arches forwards, dropping to the ground.
At that, he finally shook my hand to leave—but before turning away, he bent over to whisper into my ear:
John doesn’t answer. He realises, suddenly, that his fists are clenched so tightly that his knuckles have gone white, and his jaw is clenched so tightly that it aches.
“Ah, yes.” she continues, looking down at her clipboard. “Well, that’s why I’m here, actually! Do you have a few moments? I just want to discuss some of the potential side effects of the concussion.”
John's fingers reach through the flap of Sherlock's underwear and wrap around him almost instinctively. He exhales shakily, a whoosh from deep down in his chest so powerful that it causes his head to lull back.
If this letter has made its way into your hands, it means that either I’ve died, or that Molly has given it to you despite my wishes. If the latter is indeed the case, please remind her that she has drunkenly poured her heart out to me many times, and I know just enough about her to be dangerous.
"Holy cheekbones," Elizabeth remarks. "What a stunner. Don’t think he’s into women, but if he was, I’d crawl beneath that bar so fast—“
Molly finally gives up, moving her hands to her lap. “Sorry, everyone. Seems as though the ghosts are all busy tonight.”
Sherlock refuses to acknowledge the sarcasm in his tone. "They had a fascinating selection. There was the iron maiden, of course. Essentially a standing coffin, completely lined with sharp spikes and large enough to contain a living human. The thumbkin, which, despite its childlike moniker, was a vise used to crush the bones in a victim's fingers and toes. And there was The Rack, which just stretched a person out from head to toe, more and more, until they were stretched so far they would just p—"
Gabriela kisses her on the cheek reassuringly. “I’ll be thinking about you when I’m playing with the dominatrix.”
Sherlock shrugs and takes another sip. He seems bored by the topic all of a sudden. "This wine is very good. Château Pape Clément, I believe."
happiness. Perhaps we weren't the ones to share the news. But I have the privilege of celebrating our love with
Sherlock bends down further and hooks his arms beneath John's, engaging his muscles and pulling John's upper body into his.
John’s head spins. His neck is hot. His anger is mounting. He looks down at the stains on his shirt, and then back up at William, who regards him unapologetically.
And behind a locked door, the two men bring one another to ecstasy with their hands and their mouths and their hushed words. In the evenings, while Sherlock stands over John’s wheelchair, palms flat against the wall while he rocks his hips into John’s mouth. In the mornings, hands beneath the bedsheets, Sherlock’s cold lips pressed to John’s neck, both of them still groggy from sleep.
"What was that?" John heard him fine. He just wants to hear him say it again in that deep, sexy French accent.
John's chest clenches. Of course, he knows how hollow he has felt himself since Sherlock went missing, but he hasn't taken much time to consider how equally miserable Sherlock must be.
Lestrade glances at them through the rearview mirror. “You’ll both be staying here tonight,” he says to Sherlock. “Your brother and I will remain here as well.”
“It was like I became two different people. I would study and go to classes and see you when I could—and I’d spend evenings at the restaurant, then with Nicholas. I was in deep. I gave him as much of my time as I possibly could. But eventually, he demanded more and more of it.”
Sherlock with his love right now if he could. But instead, he brushes a final kiss to his forehead and gently pulls away, carefully rolling Sherlock on his side to face him.
Sherlock thinks he detects disappointment in John’s tone, but he chooses to ignore it. “We could always tell her we’re practicing restraint techniques.” He lifts his eyebrows suggestively.
"Yeah, of course we noticed.” Lestrade takes a bite of his doughnut, nodding towards the adjoining room. "We saw you on the security camera."
“My brother is wearing one as well. So unless it’s an uncanny coincidence, or both of you somehow became married to different people while you were in hospital…then it actually is of my concern.”
“Good.” Sherlock holds out both hands, palms facing up. John gingerly places his own atop Sherlock’s; they’re soft and stained with dye from the dandelions. “Close your eyes, John,” he instructs.
“Bart’s? For a case?” It suddenly occurs to John how much he misses going on cases, but he makes every attempt not to convey his burst of melancholy.
And as hot and sweet as those earlier kisses always were, this one is absolutely savory. Slow. Purposeful. Not a means to an end.
Sherlock brushes a quick, barely-there kiss onto John’s temple. “Please. John, can you do this for me?”
They lock eyes. John goes in for the kill, approaching William swiftly, honing in on him, crowding against him, stopping only when their lips are so close that the two men breathe the same air.
The women look over to the bar, waving and smiling, and William gives them a flirtatious wink in return.
They fall into one another as though space and time were created for them alone; they pull and tug desperately at each other so that they may somehow be closer. William oh-so-quietly murmurs to John in between kisses that it’s John, too—it’s always been him. “You keep me right,” he says, and he swears to John that he will love him for as long as he lets him.
Sherlock carefully sits—but he doesn't sit too close. He doesn't want to make John more miffed than he already is.
“Careful,” John says. His expression is kind, although Sherlock wishes it weren’t; he would greatly prefer to be mocked for his lack of grace.
John chuckles, shaking his head incredulously. “Every time. You never miss an opportunity make fun of my stature, do you?”
After John untwists himself, he looks up at Sherlock with a smile, and reaches over, brushing his callused fingers lightly over his face. With his other hand, he firmly grips Sherlock’s chin, tilting him down to bring their lips together. Their short, irregular breaths mingle in the air between their mouths, quick and unsteady.
“I’m a mercenary. My loyalty goes to the highest bidder.” Her hollow voice pierces through the rage buzzing in John’s ears. “And Mycroft was outbid.”
John kisses him firmly on the lips. “If anyone objects, we can blame it on my current state of feverishness.”
“I find it funny when you say that.” Sherlock is distracted by the dandelion he twirls between his fingers. He’s no older than twelve or so. His reddish-brown hair is just as curly—if a bit messier—at this age; his jawline is soft, his cheeks bronzed with freckles.
As John’s eyes adjust, he sees a small, round table in front of him, and a tall man with a crooked nose sitting behind it. The man appears to be a police officer, though somehow, he doesn’t really seem to fit the bill.
Stamford—his best friend since freshman year of uni; the person he’s leaned on the most. Sarah and Gabriela, who have been profoundly generous with their time and effort. Sweet, open-hearted Molly, who trusts him deeply. Even Irene has proven to be a significant part of his support system, though they got off to a rocky start.
“Nah,” Mary says. “Don’t worry about that. I’m the one he’ll be angry with. So don’t waste any quality snogging time with that.”
about before they spent all of their time snogging? Has John lost his memory? Has his vocabulary been significantly reduced due to head trauma? Or has John always been dreadfully boring, but Sherlock simply forgot due to his high proficiency in other oral operations?
"Nice words." There's a glimmer in his eyes as they wander over Sherlock's face. "I could tell you that you're brilliant and beautiful."
Brook’s smile is bright against his olive skin, and premature crows feet settle at the corners of his heavily-lashed eyes. His sports coat and slacks are neatly pressed, hanging comfortably on his lean, muscular frame. His face is dusted with nearly two days of scruff, and thick waves of dark hair lay tastefully disheveled at the top of his head.
“Oh!” She exclaims. “It’s only you two. With all the pounding into the walls, I thought someone was trying to get in!”
With low rumbles of pleasure, he begs Sherlock to keep fucking him. Sherlock holds onto him and tilts him back so that his body is supported by the pillow. John very nearly goes limp in his arms, but he's still begging Sherlock not to stop.
One of John’s shirts has a loose thread on the hem that's been there for as long as John's had it. Sherlock's unsure of why he's never cut it off. Another of his shirts is a size larger than the others, and regrettably less form-fitting. Yet another has a pea-sized tear in the fabric of the breast pocket; Sherlock refers to it as John's "pea hole" shirt. And there's the shirt he wears now, which has a tea stain 6mm below the collarbone. Sherlock calls this shirt "Twinings" in honour of John's favourite brand of Earl Grey.
“Sherlock." John takes a step towards him, fighting back the urge to smooth his hair away from his eyes. He reminds himself that
And of course, there's love. The mysterious invisible force which--even more than gravity itself--drives us all in every direction. It's real. Sherlock knows this, now. John Watson has truly made him a believer.
Gabriela raises it, wrapping it around Sarah, and Sarah slides her hand in between her legs. She rubs vigorously at Gabriela’s clit over the crotch of her lace underwear until it becomes soaked with her arousal. Then, she glides her fingers underneath, sliding them in and out of her wetness.
“It’s the most ridiculous thing, actually.” Sherlock fidgets, laughing nervously as his gaze moves. “I may have said something to the medical staff after you were injured. And to that end, there may be certain...implications involving the two of us.”
"Listen!" Moriarty points outwards excitedly. "The bird sings! It's almost morning, my friend. It seems you will get your wish."
"Anyhow." John ignores Sherlock's admitted lack of knowledge on the governing of Texas firearms. "There was this dock that floated on the lake. Harry and I would spend every day there. We would swim in the lake—it was over one hundred degrees Fahrenheit, so that was a given. We would go fishing, we'd be eaten alive by mosquitoes, and we'd let the sun burn the hell out of our skin. In the evenings, we would listen to the cicadas, and catch fireflies, and stare up at the night sky. There were so many stars, you sometimes couldn't tell them apart from the fireflies. And the sky really is bigger in Texas. Lying on that dock, surrounded by sky—it felt sort of like floating in space."
Sherlock is highly amused and highly riled by John's ongoing tantrum. Partially because he enjoys the emphatic sniffing sound John makes when he becomes angry. And partially because it's the most entertaining exchange they've had in days.
One evening, there was a knock at my door. I opened it—it was Moriarty. He was a shell of who he once was; I could no longer detect a single piece of Brook in him. But I wasn’t afraid of him. I knew that whatever happened at that point was simply my destiny.
John knows that it’s silly to be a tiny bit saddened by Sarah’s happy ending with Gabriela, and he wants to kick his own arse. But now, he can’t stop thinking about what it had felt like to wake up in William’s arms.
He doesn’t turn to kiss John goodbye, nor glance in his direction, for there is danger in biding time. In this shared bed of theirs, the sight of John’s naked body—draped in moonlight and thin cotton sheets—would rob Sherlock completely of his ability to leave.
Next up: Molly attempts to hold a seance. John attempts to save Lestrade’s life. Neither attempt goes as planned.
"Yes. As much as I could have, given my breadth of knowledge. But it doesn't matter. It wasn’t until I met John Watson—and found a part of myself I didn't know I'd been missing—that I learned love's true meaning."
"John!" Sherlock lowers himself onto the table, bringing John with him. "Your lips need to stop moving so I can kiss them."
He wants to ask Sherlock whether he knows he's saved his life in every possible way. Wants to ask how it's even possible that every moment they're together—whether on an adventure or sitting in complete silence—is more electrifying than any crime they could solve. More gratifying than curing any ailment. More poignant than fighting on any battlefield.
"Mmm? John?" Sherlock's eyes snap open. He jerks his head up from the bed and looks over. "John," he repeats, exhaling with relief. "Oh. You're awake."
John keeps his eyes glued to William from across the crowded bar. William wraps his blue scarf around his long, pale neck, and he walks out the back door.
"John," he says roughly, taking John's face into his hands and kissing him. The kiss is not soft, nor tender. It burns; it’s possessive, and it's charged with Sherlock's desire. John gives himself over, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's waist to scoop him in closer. As water pours over their soft naked bodies, they glide their tongues messily over each other's lips, their hard, twitching cocks sliding together. They kiss feverishly, until their mouths are red and chapped and fatigued; their skin all dried out from the water.
He hears a fuzzy sound from his earbuds before Gabriela’s voice comes through. “Hey, friend. Can you hear me?”
He moves to stand besides him. "John Watson is my boyfriend! And the best thing to ever happen to me! And also! By the way! He is a very, very talented kisser! He does this insane thing with his tongue that makes me squirm! Every! Time! It's unbelievable! And!" he takes a deep, deep breath. "I love him!"
Not even the alcohol can dull the booming bass that erupts from the speakers, or the clamoring of hundreds of drunken people. It doesn’t dull the bright lights, either, or the scent of various colognes battling the smell of sweaty bodies.
It's a blatant tongue-in-cheek homage to the infamous "Dear Boss" letter, a handwritten confession by a person identifying themselves as "Jack the Ripper." The letter, written in red ink as well, begins with the words "Dear Boss," and contains boastful descriptions of the Whitechapel murders. It also contains jabs at the police, including the mention of cutting off someone's ears and sending them to the police "just for jolly."
He begins to wonder what will happen once he walks through the bedroom door. Will it all be different? Last night was one of the most amazing nights of his life—will Sherlock want more nights like that? Will things remain the same between the two of them? Will things change? And if so, will they change for the better?
she repeats insistently, but she bites her bottom lip to hide a grin, and Sherlock knows she’s not as angry as she’s pretending to be. "If he sees you two, this will have been for nothing."
That night, Sherlock does what any fake husband would do: he stays there, next to a bruised and sleepy John, and he watches him breathe. He also decides he can't leave John's side. Not tonight. Maybe not ever. Perhaps that's something fake husbands do, too.
He follows the phantom from the cabin and into the dry night, where he becomes caught in an embrace that is colder than the Arctic wind. He feels a needle in his arm, and the soothing lilt of a madman’s voice just over the shell of his ear:
There is John and there is Sherlock, and there is love. In a small bed, in a small cabin in the woods. In a sleeping world which has become unfamiliar in the weeks gone by.
She pulls back to look at him, her thick eyelashes as dark as the black polish on her nails. Her hair is swept to one side in a loose ponytail, and her smile sparkles like the silver hoops dangling from her ears. Her strapless dress is elegant and sensual, hugging her waist and hips, and she unconsciously smooths it down to keep it from creeping up her thighs.
John shuffles his feet, his eyes falling on the corpse’s spleen. “I mean, she could help you. She clearly fancies you, and I’m sure she’d kiss you, if you asked.”
The back door of The Strand, which, only hours before, was covered in dark red letters, has been completely painted over with thick, black paint.
Moriarty laughs. “Did you forget? This is Vegas, honey! The games don’t end until the sun comes up! And our game is multiple choice. So, who will take the great fall? It will be up to Sherlock
Sherlock’s eyes fall closed. He wants to beg him not to continue, but his words are lodged in his throat.
“I’ve, erm—” Sherlock swallows thickly; he’s so close that John feels his Adam’s apple bobbing in his throat. “I’ve never done this with someone before.”
“Don’t kill Sherlock yet, I told her!” His voice is suddenly very loud. “We aren’t ready! Don’t mess up the plan, Miss Morstan!” The stairs creak as he climbs the deck. “She never liked to do things if it wasn’t her way. Shame. She was one of my most talented killers.”
John smiles at him. “Take my hand, darling,” he says softly. “There’s something I want to show you.”
Looking down from the third floor of Bart's hospital. Prepared to fall. And John, who looks up at him from the pavement, desperately begs for him to come down. But he can't. John does not, cannot understand that Sherlock is doing it for him.
It’s now Sherlock who is all sweaty and tachycardic. Also, he might be going into shock, or cardiac arrest, or both at once, because either of these scenarios are far more likely than John Watson being in love with him.
John shakes his head, shoving his hands deeper into his coat pockets. “I shouldn’t have come here, actually. I was just leaving. I’ll...bye.”
John reads the message five times. Surprisingly, he doesn’t feel annoyed or anxious or angry. Actually, he feels nothing.
John fumbles, and his phone slips from his hands and into his lap. “Yeah. Yes, I’m good. I just...read a news article that was a bit disturbing.”
Marci rolls her eyes and laughs. “Mike’s okay. And I was never actually pregnant—Sherlock was just being a dramatic arsehole.”
During one of those days, John and Stamford are at the table in their apartment eating breakfast. John asks Stamford about his plans for New Years Eve, and Stamford grows visibly uncomfortable. Apparently, Elizabeth’s best friend is throwing a party at her house.
The man scoffs. He reaches into his pocket, his fingers sliding past the holster of his well-polished gun. “If you’re searching for Sherlock Holmes,” he says, “I regret to inform you that you’re out of luck. Sherlock Holmes, as the world has come to know him, is dead.”
John’s cheeks grow hot—due partially to Sherlock’s inquisition and proximity, and partially his own embarrassment. He shuffles his feet nervously and shrugs. “It’s not a big deal. It just hit me how much I miss going out on cases with you.”
John thinks Sherlock is better than he gives himself credit for, but he doesn't argue. His mouth is far too busy for that.
John opens his eyes. William is still there. He's there, but he looks broken, and John can't bear the sight of it. So he takes a step forwards and kisses him on the lips.
John inhales slowly, steadying his breath. After all, Sherlock’s fate—and perhaps John’s own—depend upon on how this meeting goes. He decides not to remind Gabriela of that.
John’s heart jumps into his throat as she saunters by—tugged upon both by relief and nervousness. He’s glad she showed, but is apprehensive about what the night could potentially bring.
“Sherlock!” A haughty voice calls out. John instantly recognises it; it's Mycroft, Sherlock's brother. He approaches the two of them, dressed in a bespoke suit. He's accompanied by a man in his early thirties with black and silver hair who appears to be an
When he finally pulls away, John grins up at him, eyelids heavy, and it's Sherlock who can't produce words.
"Erm, yes? I do know. Of course I’m right. Glad we’re clear on that.” Sherlock leans back in and puckers his lips. “Let’s kiss.“
“Did everyone else see what that little wooden thing just did?” Lestrade flails his arms towards Mrs. Hudson’s ouija board, his face paler than a corpse’s.
But one thing stands out to John more than anything else: the way she looks at William. It’s a look that John knows well. It’s the same way his grandfather would look at his gram before he passed. It’s the look that Clara gave his sister on the day of their wedding. It’s the look that Sarah gave to the man wearing the suit and tie as they left the bar the other night.
And…John stops breathing again. The scent of Sherlock's aftershave, the heat and the sweat, and freshly baked macarons—the combination is surely some sort of wildly effective, previously undiscovered aphrodisiac.
“Mmm.” Sherlock snakes his arms around John’s waist. “Need you closer, please.” With that, he pushes himself in, pressing their bodies together as tightly as they will go. He wedges his head into the crook of John's neck, not allowing for a single inch of space, and he scoops him in for a firm, full embrace.
He glances over her shoulder at the other barmaid: a dark-haired woman who’s all curves and bright red lips. She wears a tight black leather corset and an even tighter black skirt, batting her eyelashes flirtatiously at her patrons as she makes their drinks.
Sherlock gazes back over the edge and into the city. "I truly gave up on love before I met you; believing that the only matter of importance was my brain. Solely the hard drive in my head mattered, and everything else served to rob that of very useful resources. Over time, I managed to turn my soul to stone."
Tearing his eyes away, he checks his phone for messages. Still nothing. He screams internally as he begins to type.
“I’ll find a way to make it up to you.” John grins, pressing his hips forward into Sherlock’s, proof of his already burgeoning hardness. “Now. I was told you were going to take me to bed.”
John takes a deep breath and exhales. Shakes his head, repeats Sherlock's name several times. Leans forwards to set his wine back onto the table. Brushes his elbow against Sherlock's knee. Goosebumps. Finally, he looks back over at Sherlock, his expression bewilderingly soft. "You honestly have no idea?"
"Your priorities are foolish. Perhaps you ought to reevaluate them." The words, when said aloud, are heavier than Sherlock was expecting.
John inhales. “Alright, then.” He pauses for a moment, clearing his throat. “I’ve got two very important questions. To start: where is Sherlock now?”
Even if the person behind this door means to harm him, he’s willing to take that chance. Because it could be anyone. Even Sherlock.
"Hm. I’d like to kiss you in Paris, in front of the Eiffel Tower. In Bali, on a white sandy beach. In the chilly autumn rain. On Christmas morning, beneath the mistletoe. In front of—"
And that's when his foot becomes stuck in the leg of his trousers. They end the kiss only to break into giddy laughter, grabbing on to each other as they tumble down to their knees.
John doesn’t actually feel feverish. He’s sure his face is only warm because he hasn’t stopped blushing since this dream began. He stands anyway, and he finds himself immediately wrapped in Sherlock's arms. It feels like the most natural thing in the universe.
Moments later, Sherlock orgasms—he freezes, stuttering and pouring himself into John. And while he comes, he quickly wraps his slender fingers around John’s hardness and pulls. He throws his head back to expose his pale, sweaty neck, and the vision of Sherlock in the throes of ecstasy is all John needs; with one small stroke, hot liquid floods out of him and over Sherlock's fingers.
"I notice it," Sherlock states. "I simply didn't care enough to pay attention. Not until it was you, anyway. I most definitely paid attention when it was you."
Molly pulls a small bottle of Irish whisky from her handbag and pours it into her coffee. She holds it out to John in offering, but he declines. She shrugs, screws the cap back on, and returns the bottle to her bag.
He looks up to find Stamford waving from a booth across the room, accompanied by two pretty women John doesn’t recognize. John shrugs apologetically and turns back to William—just as another customer approaches the bar.
There’s a thrill in not knowing whether you are the predator or the prey—will you pounce first, or will you first be pounced upon?
“I had this thought, or an occurrence, rather—“ Sherlock stammers. “That is to say, a thought that occurred to me…” he briefly pauses as if summoning coherent words. “And, well, I discussed it with Molly, and she thought it was a good thought, so I thought, perhaps—"
Instead, he watches John closely as he opens the cupboard door, his eyes roaming over his body. It suddenly occurs to him how oddly out of character John’s current attire is. Typically, he looks as though he’s raided his grandfather’s wardrobe—but not now. Right now, the jumper he wears is dark cashmere and quite form-fitting, as are his denim trousers. Hm, yes. Quite form-fitting indeed.
Sherlock holds him, basking in the sensation of his cheek pressed into his neck, and he forces himself to ignore his aching heart for a few moments longer.
"Oh, god," John rasps. Every brain cell, every molecule of his existence is overcome with the anticipation of Sherlock's touch. He bites his lip hard and brings his hips forwards in a gesture of consent.
to take you on your knees against the wall, spreading you open with your arms pinned above your head? Does
That’s when he hears a loud gasp of shock from Gabriela, flowed by Irene’s voice, crystal clear, once again.
John shivers at the sensation of Sherlock’s gentle lips tickling his skin. “You know...should you decide to go back to solving murders, I could be your partner. With my medical knowledge and your powers of deduction, we’d make a great team.”
It’s a simple, innocuous act between two lovers, and it's likely happened dozens of times, but it digs hard into John.
“Yeah, I’ve heard of the murders," he says nonchalantly as they sit for lunch between lectures. ”I thought of you, of course. Right up your alley, isn’t it?”
Gabriela takes out her wallet and hands her credit card to him. “Looks like you need me, Watson. Book the appointment under my name. Gabriela Gomez, attorney at law, at your service. I can get her to talk.”
When I began writing “Dive” in December of 2019—just six months ago—the world was different. “Sheltering in place” and “essential worker” and “Zoom sessions” were expressions that hadn’t yet made their way into the public consciousness. George Floyd and Breonna Taylor’s murders had not yet spurred a revolution.
Who could have guessed that Sherlock Holmes would one day learn to crave entanglement? But even if it’s fake entanglement, he does. He craves entanglement with John—more than he craves nicotine or morphine or amphetamines.
Sherlock digs his fingers into the sofa beneath him, fumbling at it, overcome with the need to touch something. Then, he remembers that John is something he can touch, so he raises his arms behind himself, clasping the back of John's head. He pulls him in, pressing him closer until their kiss is deeper than the ocean.
Before long, the hardness between their legs is throbbing with the need to be released. Sherlock, ever observant, reaches down and unfastens John’s trousers first, and then his own. Their naked cocks pour out, dark and thick.
He sets his phone back down and continues to doze lightly for a few minutes, his heart filling up as he thinks of the previous night. Obviously, he and Sherlock will need to talk about what happened, but for now, he just wants to bathe in the afterglow.
It's the most emotionally charged encounter they've ever had. And just like that, it's over. And just like that, Sherlock thinks—perhaps he means all of it too.
This, though—this was the most intimate encounter he’s ever had. And after something like this, what’s next? Does one keep in touch—or move on? He has no idea how to contact William, anyway. He supposes he could call The Strand, but wouldn’t that be a bit presumptuous? Or would it be worse to ignore him and move on as if nothing happened?
Thirty minutes. It won’t be enough time, but John supposes no amount of time ever could be. But there will be more time for them in the future. Somehow, he knows this.
“And also...” John adds. “...not to be completely shallow, but Jesus, you are bloody gorgeous. I can’t tell you how long I’ve wanted to touch you like this. Though I suppose it’s been since day one, at Bart's.”
Sherlock would hit him if his hands weren't tied. Instead, he leans forward, glaring at him with as much ferocity as he can muster.
"I have the privilege of celebrating our love with you, John. Every hour, every moment of every day, for as long as you will allow—and that, to me, is the loveliest thing of all."
When John finally slows to a sputter and comes, he whispers Sherlock’s name hoarsely into the cool, damp skin of his neck.
." He huffs. "By the way, your pre-coital conversational skills are atrocious. Zero out of ten. Not sexy at all."
"It does.” And it looks like it's something John ought to wear for the rest of his life. "You must have deduced the exact size of my finger using some of your fancy techniques."
Hello from the other side of the most brutal writer’s block I’ve experienced in my 4 years as a writer! I made it out aliiiiive
"He’s brought his entire game tonight, hasn't he? Desperately trying to woo you. Dressing up, flirting, wine and dinner. Flowers? Are there flowers?"
“Yes." Sherlock turns to his side, gazing over at him, and it feels as though they're floating beneath a cloud of giddiness. "Though it had far more benefits than I predicted.”
He brushes the snow from his coat sleeve and huffs a goodbye under his cloudy breath. If nothing else comes from this insanity-fuelled excursion, at least he can say he got some closure.
Sherlock's and Mrs. Hudson's mouths drop open as they gasp in unison. Mrs. Hudson takes a drink of her tea and pretends she didn't hear the question.
She breathes in. “What the girls said earlier to you, about not knowing of Sherlock’s whereabouts? That’s a lie."
“Since day one?” Sherlock’s voice cracks like a pubescent schoolboy. But it’s alright, because John loves him.
Her voice is what triggers his memory. She’s got a British accent now, but before, when they were having drinks at The Strand, her accent was definitely American. It was on Stamford’s birthday, and she was there with her friend Elizabeth, and she was flirtatious and all smiles and touched John quite a lot.
Once Sherlock's curiosity gets the better of him, he leans over John's shoulder to inspect the hymnal from which he plays. The notes on the page are blurred and scrambled, but the title is quite clear:
John throws his head back and laughs. "And there's Irene Adler, making an unexpected appearance, something she is uncannily good at."
John instantly feels the need to backpedal. "I'm sorry, Sherlock. I didn’t mean to take it that far. I just got caught up in the act."
Past the altar is a magnificent stage. It contains a sprawling, sky-high pipe organ with an enormous ivory casing of cherubs and angels. Poised before the keyboards is John, adorned in hospital attire, playing each note with the dexterity and elegance of a virtuoso. He's so engrossed in the music that he doesn't appear to notice Sherlock's presence. Sherlock doesn't mind but to watch; because although John paints a lovely picture with the touch of every key, it's he who is the masterpiece.
lengthy one if that staff is Doctor Torres. (That's Sherlock's use of creative license). An impromptu (and often unbeknownst) performance for Molly or Mrs. Hudson when they appear unannounced. (These performances usually end with cheers and a standing ovation. Or bouquets of flowers and other gifts. Sometimes, there are tears of joy. Mrs. Hudson is incorrigible.)
"I, erm...I mean, I think the...tight jeans look great on you. Although—did you want me to get you a home pregnancy test? Because I can, if you need one."
Molly’s cheeks flush with embarrassment. “Yeah?” she says sheepishly. “Tell her thank you for me, then.”
When all is said and done, it won’t matter; half of a soul cannot survive alone. When one dies, the other eventually wilts. When one is set ablaze, the other quickly burns. This is how love operates.
“Yes, she’s here. It’s fine. She already knows all of the important details, such as your status ‘down there.’”
"Hello, Doctor Watson," she says with a friendly smile. "I noticed you’re my patient only just before coming in—and although I'm pleased to help you, if you think it might be a conflict of interest, we can request a reassignment."
William stands next to him and says nothing. John also says nothing. But his brain has quite a lot to say. And it mostly wants to go on about the naughty things he and the idiot next to him could be doing. He suddenly notes how warm the room is. He’s sweating. He’s
Also, it’s adorable that he’s small but fierce and brave and a bit scrappy, sort of like a Pomeranian
“Good afternoon, Doctor Hooper." He deems Molly's presence worthy of a formal greeting at best; her allegations worthy of no acknowledgement at all. Joining her at the examination table, he looks upon a male in his early fifties whose neck is covered in dark bruises and lesions. "Strangulation," he surmises. "Accidental."
The kiss instantly grounds John. His head is no longer spinning, though the fluttering of his heart only accelerates, quickening with their breaths.
Sherlock chuckles. “My dear Watson. What libations did you partake of this evening that you don’t recall the year, or recognise your own home?”
“Hmm.” John wraps his arm around Sherlock’s shoulder, and Sherlock tucks his head onto his chest. “I’m going to say it’s a little of both.”
“Apologies,” she says. “That one isn’t for sale. It’s quite rare, you see. I can put you on a waitlist, but you may not receive it for another year or so.”
Sherlock crosses his arms angrily. “Let her. I refuse to argue with a fake entity.” He waves a hand at Donovan. “Continue, if you must.”
“I don’t know where we are, or how we got here,” John says softly. “But there’s one thing I do know: whoever awaits me outside that door—they aren’t you. And in any world, in any universe, it’s you. It’s
And if he and John can fool the world into thinking they’re in love, they can fool the world into thinking they’re not.
"Go away right now," Sherlock chimes in. "Or I will throw one of these katanas at you—just to see if they are, indeed, real.”
The sounds John makes—and the thickening beneath his waist—become a clear indication of his arousal. Sherlock always enjoys the stiffness in John's pants when they’re being intimate, even during the times he can't follow suit. And John knows this, obviously. So he clutches onto Sherlock's buttocks to control the rhythm of his movements, canting his own hips in a reciprocating motion.
Sherlock releases John's arms, peels his body away, and reaches to the bedside table for a bottle of lube.
They talk about everything and nothing until the sun comes up. Sherlock refuses to sleep, he says, because he doesn’t want this perfect day to end. John kisses him on the shoulder and promises that tomorrow will be even better.
"Got it," John says, cutting him off. "That sounds very happy, indeed. For you." He smiles, and he proceeds to say other things, but Sherlock is only vaguely paying attention. John looks so kissable with his lips moving like that.
Without breaking the kiss, he circles his arms around John's shoulders and pulls his body over his. He covers him like a blanket, sinks into him completely, and still wishes they could somehow be closer. He licks fervidly into John's mouth, continuing to grind their hips together.
The sun rises over the harbor, and the sky becomes billowy and pink. They gaze out, watching the snow drift down from cotton candy clouds.
“Sherlock.” John reaches out and wraps his fingers around Sherlock’s upper arm, gently tugging him back. “Wait.”
recall, with an unnerving clarity, is the puzzling way John stared as he evaluated every inch of him. It causes an acute physiological response in Sherlock that isn’t entirely familiar—nor entirely unpleasant. As he squirms in his seat, he briefly wonders whether he ought to wear this particular shirt more often.
That last part was something he didn't actually intend to say out loud. Because if he knows Sherlock—and he does—he will now have to provide evidence to support his claim.
Scientifically speaking, everything about this moment is completely perfect. And like many instances of pure perfection, it began with a murder.
The air rushes out of John’s lungs as he hits the wall with a thud. He’s never felt so powerless in his life—but he wants this. God, he wants this. So he pours kisses into William's open mouth, sweeping his tongue over his lips and teeth, only coming up for air with tiny, desperate gasps.
Nevertheless, Sherlock continues to guide him steadily over his swelling hardness as his other hand wanders to the front of John's boxers—and he wraps his own fingers around the astoundingly stiff and (truly) generously-sized member.
“I’m here,” he shushes him gently. “I’m here, sweetheart. And you’re here, and we’re both safe. Please don’t cry.”
Sherlock clenches his teeth. “You're not him. Your words have no meaning nor resonance with me. You know nothing of love, you disgusting, vile madman.”
He’s glad he saved Sherlock. Real. He’d do it again if he had to. Real. Sherlock's lips are plush and dry and maddeningly beautiful. Real. They’re pressed into John’s lips as he gently cradles his head in his hands. It’s the perfect kiss—simple, earnest, blissful. The type of kiss that could only occur in a dream.
“We'll take you there," Lestrade says, "but before we leave you alone, we need to go over a few important matters."
"Hold on to me," Sherlock murmurs—so John clutches onto his shoulders, leaning forwards and resting their foreheads together. Their eyes drift shut, and Sherlock arches his hips upwards; John bears back down onto him until they fall into a familiar pattern. Sighing and moaning and burning for each other, they make love.
"Yes, I’m alright.” John looks down at himself to examine his injuries. He’s got one arm in a sling and one leg in a cast. Much of the rest of him is bruised or bandaged. “Well, no. I feel like I got thrown from the third floor of a building, but all things considered...not bad."
”Thank you,” he murmurs, and he finds himself in a vaguely familiar position. Brook’s arms are around his waist, his stubbled jaw pressed against Sherlock's cool skin. Sherlock feels an urge that was at one time completely foreign; but he's not as naive as he was before—and he is no longer Brook's student.
face becomes wet with saliva; he’s buried between John’s legs so deeply that John wonders how he’s even breathing—hell, he’s not entirely sure how he’s breathing himself.
“In his letter, he called you Mary.” John's tone isn’t accusatory; it’s simply an observation. “Earlier, you said you use a fake name. So I assume he’s referring to you.”
John's once-deep strokes become soft caresses, sending chills through Sherlock's body. Sherlock simply cannot get enough of this. John’s hands must be magic. For the first time in as long as he can remember, his head feels clear, and so he simply lets himself be.
“No. Not that.” John pushes himself to keep going, though his heart is roaring in his throat. “The feelings. Were they real to you?”
“This is someone who ran away, presumably to be safe,” Gabriela reminds him. “She could be fine with seeing you, but she could also refuse to accept the booking. Especially if she’s sworn to secrecy, or whatever.”
Sherlock takes his hand. He doesn’t ask where they’re going. It doesn’t matter, as long as it’s with him.
He wraps his fingers over Sherlock’s thin wrist, and when he feels the life flowing beneath his skin, relief overtakes him, and he nearly collapses again.
Sherlock lifts his gaze, and John watches him back, eyes wide with awe. The adoration in his expression is so open that the lump in Sherlock's throat returns. He knows by the way John looks at him that it's time—so he rises up, opens the bottle of lube and pours out a generous amount; tucks his knees below John's thighs and pushes his legs back.
That night, the three of them chat for hours. Not solely over the topic of John’s penis, of course—though it does make a conversational cameo or two. And for better or worse, Molly and Mrs. Hudson now know as much about his and John’s relationship as he does. Which is to say—not a whole lot.
