Steve’s brows drew together, causing a tiny line to form between them. “The way she’s excited about the Captain America part of me. My Tony might have been but we got off on the wrong foot pretty much immediately so I never saw that side of him. And there is Pepper not being here. Their relationship had its ups and downs but she was
Squirming, Toni tried to steer the conversation back to its original topic. They could worry about her numerous issues later. Or never. Never was good too. “In the case of calling Strange, he’s not a bad guy but he’s very into things being in their rightful place. What if he takes one look at Steve and says he’s ripping apart space and time by just being here, and wants to send him somewhere? Then I’d have to fight him and his cape to stop him.”
With Pepper busy running Stark Industries and Rhodey serving his country, Toni didn’t have too many down time moments with friends. Usually she would be held up in her workshop and while she one hundred percent enjoyed that, she discovered that she also liked hanging out with Steve too. She already knew she’d miss him…when he left.
Doctor Strange’s words about the tether sat on the tip of Steve’s tongue but he swallowed them down. Obviously Toni was feeling some kind of way about everything and while telling her about the tether’s growth was something he needed to do, he couldn’t bring himself to say anything at the moment. He didn’t want to make her feel bad or force her into some odd crunch mode that burnt her out. She did everything for everyone already.
Toni snickered. “Then you really don’t know me at all,” she teased. “Man I’m starving. Do you wanna sneak out of here and get something to eat? I know a great place that sells the best cheeseburgers. My treat! I’ll even get you a malt to go with those khakis. Or would you rather have a root beer?”
Toni rested her chin to her knee. Her pajama pants had tiny Captain America shields on them. “What about all the evil shit in your reality that would eventually need kicking?”
Steve cleared his throat and turned back to his drawing, blinking when he realized Bucky was staring at him with a positively shit eating grin that had
“I’m fine,” Steve mumbled but he was already letting her pull him up. His head was fogged and dizzy; there was a chance he had a slight concussion if the sudden pounding was anything to go by. “I—I need. Where…”
“No,” she replied slowly. “It’s reinforced so go nuts. There isn’t any like, tension there right? It’s none of my business but…”
“You know Pepper gave you her seal of approval and said you had a cute butt.” She grinned and leaned against the counter. “I don’t think Rhodey will be doing the latter but I’m sure he’ll like you. Because of the patriotism and what not.”
“I was there when Toni used the stones. I thought I was about to watch her die, and in that split second I remembered all the times I’d been less than nice to her. It’s funny how that’s what went through my mind instead of fear or anger. It was just regret that I’d never get to apologize.” She uncapped her juice and took a long sip. “Once upon a time I thought she wasn’t capable of being a hero and yet there she was, wielding those stones like some kind of titan. And if shit happened an hour from now and she had to again, she’d be strapping them on.”
, not until their reconciliation. Then Tony’s presence was like a constant, low simmering thing that calmed him more than he’d realized. Just Tony standing close behind him as they made a plan to retrieve the Stones, hovering with that warmth only Tony could project.
“Yes,” Jarvis replied with a note of a smile in his artificial voice. “His Uncle has expressed it’s good for him to have a female figure in his life since the untimely passing of his Aunt. Ms. Stark doesn’t consider herself a good role model but I can confidently say she has been a wonderful influence over young Mr. Parker.”
Judith’s responding giggle was high pitched with twin spots of red appearing on her cheeks. “Thank you so much.” She turned to Toni. “Marry this one dear. If you don’t, I just might.” And then she was gently pushing Adam out of the room and towards the elevator.
“I was scared. I wanted to protect him from it but once I found out Bucky was the Winter Soldier, I was scared of what he might do to Bucky too. And I’d
die and you were kind of okay with that for whatever reason? That you never once thought for a second it’d be Tony?”
Yet somehow standing in the kitchen of Toni’s tower just—well it just fit. He already knew where everything was and although he was still reluctant to settle in, his room was shaping up to be
As Rhodey headed for the door Steve glanced back to Toni—who offered up a gentle smile—before following. They walked in silence for a moment to the long glass walkway that connected the two sides of the tower, presumably for when you didn’t want to take the elevator or when it just wasn’t feasible. Rhodey stopped midway and leaned against the railing, hands clasped together. Far below was the lobby where during the day people milled around doing their jobs.
Steve exhaled deeply; that felt like a punch to the gut. “They were mostly about holding superheroes accountable for things they did, destruction they caused, that type of thing. I wasn’t—I wasn’t against them per se but there were parts of them I did not agree with. Mostly
—and unzipped it to peer inside. “Ooh this is nice. I’d say it’s too nice for cosplay but I’ve seen some awesome costumes at Comic Con. Is this…Carbon Polymer Kevlar weave?”
“Seeing as how we are dealing with the subject of Time, perhaps it would be beneficial to call in an expert in the field,” Jarvis suggested. “I believe you have one on speed dial.”
Steve was in the middle of removing his suit, the top pulled down to his waist. In any other situation Toni would have made a crack about his
Like her male counterpart Toni tended to look good in whatever she was wearing, whether it was tattered jeans with holes at the knees or a fancy blouse just hiding the arc reactor. He had no trouble admitting that she was a beautiful woman—he wasn’t blind—but this was the first time he’d been brought up short by it.
Steve rolled his shoulders. “I’m not sure. Seeing those red and gold chains around me—maybe I should be upset but I don’t know. I’m not. I’ve spent a big chunk of my life being connected to a Stark in one way or another. Or helped by a Stark. Toni managing to help me stay grounded the second this universe realizes I exist? It—it’s heavy stuff, Buck.” His voice dropped lower. “Strange contacted me yesterday with a bit more information but I haven’t told Toni yet.”
Thankfully he was saved by Jarvis. “Ma’am Colonel Rhodes’ flight has almost reached Newark Airport. He should be here within the hour if traffic permits.”
Steve’s jaw clenched. “We didn’t ask you for commentary. Can you shed any light on the situation or not?”
But anyway he didn’t hate this reality though a part of him kind of wished he did. It just…it would be easier if he did.
moments.” Her eyes drifted down to his hands. They were smoother than she’d thought they’d be; gloves probably kept the calluses at bay when it came to handling the shield. “How are you?”
Being with Peggy again had felt wonderful. Getting used to 1945 wasn’t easy but each day got a little better. Besides she was there to help and he figured that was all that mattered. Eventually he’d stop missing his friends and the internet. Get used to clunky stoves and action shows on the radio. Get used to Howard Stark bursting with energy and charisma that was so familiar it actually hurt. The days would pass and he’d remember the forties while looking forward to experiencing the decades he’d missed. He and Peggy had an honest to god house with a white picket fence and really, what could be more
Bucky shook his head as he strolled through—shirtless—on his way to the kitchen. He flashed Steve one of his patented asshole grins to which Steve promptly ignored.
Strange smiled. “Yes I can see that. Perhaps you should start from the beginning if you don’t mind.”
“I kinda feel like he doesn’t see anything else considering I’m alive and his Tony isn’t. Also I’m a woman and his Tony wasn’t. However your points are valid. He’s had his asshole moments and I called him on them.”
gotten him back after thinking he was dead,” he explained. “It was just easier to not say anything. To wait until Bucky was okay and then I was going to explain it all. Sit the team down and air out all of the dirty laundry. But Ultron happened and then Wanda lost control and people died, and the Accords were drawn up. Then Zemo framed Bucky for another murder and it all just went to shit.”
Steve’s stare burned her skin with a fire-like intensity and although she didn’t want to meet it she didn’t exactly have a choice. It stripped her bare and had she been wearing the armor, the face plate would have snapped down thinking she needed protection. As it were however nothing sheltered her from those expressive blue eyes; she was just surprised to see no trace of resentment or blame in them. After all he was floating in this reality—and not back with Peggy—because of her. She hadn’t actively done anything but it made a morose bit of sense that it was her fault.
“So you and Nat huh? I’d say I hope you’re treating her right but if you don’t she’ll just kill you.”
Snorting at her own silly little thoughts, she lit up at the sight of an elderly woman easing out of the elevator carrying a large tray of covered food. “Mrs. Linley! Why didn’t you have Jarvis tell me you were here? I would have come down and helped you!”
“Fine no lies, geeze. Strange said it had something to do with Steve possibly carrying around too much energy and the Wraith aka time monster wanting to put him somewhere where he was already connected. Like here. Because of me.”
It hadn’t taken long for Steve to realize a lot of the bravado of Tony Stark was a deflection. Granted it took him a bit longer than he’d liked to admit, and there’d been that brief exchange with Pepper when he’d called to yell at Tony about secretly funding his road trip, but in the end he got it. A lot of what Tony did was because he’d felt if he didn’t go the extra mile no one would want him around. It wasn’t about flaunting his wealth it was about using it to keep people close—if that’s what it took anyway. And understanding that one facet about Tony had changed a lot for Steve.
Pepper smiled. “I’m sure I will. You seem to like him. Don’t get me wrong I’m happy you’re making new friends, Toni. I realize now that I’m running your company and we aren’t dating anymore that we probably don’t spend as much time together. It’s nice to see you not locked up in your workshop all of the time with DUM-E and You. As wonderful as they are you still need to see the sunlight every once and a while.”
survive? You’re not a bad guy Steve—I can tell—so don’t take any of this personally. It’s a spiel I’d give to any newcomer.”
Blinking rapidly she stood and pulled her shoulders back, fitting a different type of armor into place. “Instead I just collect ‘em like strays. If T’Challa would stop playing hard to get I’d be adding Shuri into the mix. If Peter was single I’d put them in an arranged marriage. Think of the future spider-panther babies.”
A brow rose. “A lot of people didn’t create a new timeline to make sure he got enough hugs though. That’s good, it’s good. Makes me think maybe me and the Cap here would have been good friends too. Kid me would be bursting at the thought.”
Toni waved the feed away and hopped up, pulling her in for a big hug. “I’m fine! Just been busy helping Steve. And he’s not
If Tony Prime had felt even a fraction of the love and admiration Steve obviously felt for him, well of course he’d been devastated to learn he was lied to, especially about something like his parents’ deaths. In that moment every fucked up thing he’d ever thought about himself—that his father had said or Obie had said—had no doubt exploded to the forefront of his brain. And cut just as deep as shrapnel to the chest.
. Steve settled back into bed while Toni got on the phone with Pepper to do their Toni and Pepper thing. He could hear her from outside in the hallway and now that he was paying attention, now that he knew what to look for, yeah he could see it. He could see
Although Steve wasn’t a stranger to the city he revealed he hadn’t spent much time just…walking around doing nothing because if he wasn’t fighting he was in Washington for SHIELD or away. The
Tony do anything, trust me on this. He knew what was at stake and what he had to lose, but he helped because he
She smiled. “Sure. Guess we’ll have to find other ways to entertain ourselves then. Shirtless calendar is still on the table. I could have Pepper set it up in seconds. We could get you a flag and everything.”
Judith laughed and patted her shoulder. “You are such a troublemaker. I noticed you ordered more food than usual. Are your little friends coming to visit?”
Perching on one of her leather stools, Toni rested her chin in the palm of her hand. “He really likes having you around. He’s acclimated well to everything since we got that brain washing taken care of. Sometimes I still want to punch him in the face with my gauntlet but…I don’t know. He annoys Clint so I feel like for that alone he deserves to not get punched.”
wasn’t the right word but in the moment that’s just how you felt. Like you weren’t good enough or like everything you thought was real had just been a clever lie.
“Just…” He sighed but otherwise didn’t move. “I’ve seen a lot since waking up and learned a lot too. I’d made peace with the idea that we’re not alone in the universe but now I’m wondering what the point is?”
Steve snorted lightly, smoothing his hand across his chin. “Of course it doesn’t have to be all or nothing. The question is though what
Sighing, Toni leaned forward so that her elbows rested on her desk. “I’m super happy that Rhodey is here and that he’s gonna be sticking around for a little while at least. But…he’s gonna take one look at me and clock that
“This place is very similar to home so it’s not super hard,” Steve explained. “And anything I don’t get Toni is there to bring me up to speed.”
Watching everyone laugh and shovel dumplings into their faces just sort of brought on an odd sense of melancholy. Like being alone in a crowded room. Not to mention parts of the conversation had made her squirm with guilt she had no reason to feel. Tidbits about the Accords and briefs mentions of the tether keeping Steve in their reality. Things they hadn’t really touched on but should probably have a conversation about at some point, especially the tether.
Judith Linley was eighty years old going on forty with bright blue eyes and long white hair that she usually wore in a series of stylish braids. She was the owner of a charming little bakery downtown that made
Bucky stood and lightly slapped Steve upside his head. “Can’t be. You always took all of the stupid with you.” He pulled Steve up into a hug. “I’m glad you’re here though, whatever the reason.”
Flustered, Toni pulled away from him and walked over to the far side of the lab where DUM-E was “organizing” a pile of junk.
Toni moved to the refrigerator and pulled out a bottle of water. “I’ve had to make sure Steve doesn’t wander into traffic.” She handed Rhodey the bottle. “But the gist is Steve is from a universe or a reality like ours but with a few marked differences. For instance I was a man there and I died. Jarvis can show you a picture of my handsome guy self later. At the root though was Thanos and the stones.”
“No Toni, no.” He stood. “I—seeing you—seeing you or any version of you would never cause me bad thoughts. All of this is just unexpected and it—it’s been a long day. I feel like I haven’t slept in months.”
He expected to be attacked next but instead it shot past him like a blur, disappearing out of the alley and down the street. Following it seemed both stupid and practical so he took off behind it, breaking from the mouth of the alley…and directly into the path of an oncoming car.
“No and even if it were possible, I wouldn’t do it.” Strange’s expression became severe. “A tether is a divine tie and trust me when I say they don’t develop out of the blue. Removing it could cause you serious harm. It could fracture you.”
—were safe, the world was safe and lately the only thing she’d had to fight were run of the mill bad guys. Everyone was thriving.
“One of these days I’m gonna smother him to death,” she mumbled punching her pillow. “I’ll have the armor hold him down.”
A woman’s face floated into view, big brown eyes stretched to capacity as hands grabbed at the side of his neck. “Hey yes alive! Dude what the hell? You don’t just run out into the middle of the street like a crazy person! Because
Completely unoffended by her taunt, Bucky flipped them both off and disappeared down the hallway. “Nightie night!”
For one mad moment, Steve had the sudden urge to press a kiss to the top of her head. Why? He had no clue and honestly he refused to look too deep into it. He also refused to think about their earlier hug and how nicely she’d fit in his arms. It just…
Toni snickered darkly. “Oh second thought, cancel that J. No supplies for the Captain. I can’t afford it. Oh and burn Barnes’ too just in case he gets any ideas about sharing.”
Shaking his head, he pinched the bridge of his nose and slouched in his chair with a small smile. Here he was a kid from Brooklyn having seen so many crazy things, now worrying whether it was right or wrong to check out the woman who was basically his friend gone too soon. Tony Prime would be laughing his ass off if he knew, teasing Steve mercilessly about it. Hell he and Natasha were probably in Heaven giggling like school children about the whole thing.
“Well the snap happened and people were blinked out of existence. Carol was off world helping her Skrull friends when Thanos arrived and try as we might, we couldn’t defeat him. It seems the only true constant for both of us is Scott being stuck in the Quantum Realm. He got out and Carol came back, and we decided to take the fight directly to Thanos. On Titan.” She wet her lips and gazed into the middle distance. “He was a bit mad by then. The stones had driven him even crazier and he kept rambling about some chick and how she didn’t care about what he’d done.”
to take accountability. Superheroes aren’t above the law just because they save people on a daily basis. We have people who monitor those types of situations.”
But that wasn’t what she wanted to do, not really. Yes, it was too late to sit both guys down and force them to say what needed to be said, but would offering up her own forgiveness not do
It was a shitty thing to say but he couldn’t help himself. The idea of Tony’s death being a simple twist of fate? No. Fuck that.
Steve chuckled. “I have your back too. If it’s needed. Which reminds me…are you okay? Earlier there seemed to be something bothering you.”
She pressed her fingers into her chest over the arc reactor and thought back to a dirty cave in the middle of the desert. To horrible men barking out orders and threats in the same breath. To Obie digging meaty fingers into her skin and yanking, smiling all the while. “You didn’t destroy Tony when you—when you did what you did. You hurt him and he probably lost faith in you for a while, but you didn’t destroy him. Besides I’m sure he was totally guilty in his own way of something or other. He had to be because it kinda takes two to fight. But hope is a Stark flaw. It’ll beat out resentment every time…given long enough to flourish. Hope that things can be fixed or mended. Hope that a ruined relationship can be set on the right path again.”
Wetting her lips and eying him speculatively, she twirled her hair up into a quick bun and backed away slowly. For a moment Steve felt bad thinking he’d scared her, but then she tapped her chest and that familiar hum of power filled the room. He watched in a state of complete shock as armor—
Steve smiled and his eyes crinkled just a little. “Yes ma’am. I’m…Steve. It’s very nice to meet you.” He shook her frail hand like it was made of glass. “Your food smells delicious. I can’t wait to try it.”
Just as he was about to reply, the elevator beeped and the door heaved open with two figures walking out. Steve’s words choked off and he just stared, not sure which of them punched him in the gut more. “…Bucky?”
Steve bit the inside of his cheek. “Maybe except you didn’t see the Captain America from here die. He was already gone when they found him but I’d been fighting side by side with Tony for…the whole battle. And before… We survived
“Oh good you’re still in one piece!” Toni announced dramatically. “See Rhodey? Bruce didn’t chop him up or put him in skin tight latex.”
It turned out to be some odd eighties movie that was part sci-fi and part musical, but Steve enjoyed it for what it was. He woke up the next morning to the smell of Belgian waffles and raised voices. Throwing on a t-shirt and jeans, he quickly made his way into the living area to see Toni—hands on her hips—looking rather unimpressed at the imposing figure Nick Fury made in front of her.
Nodding he let her go and pushed away from the table, getting up with the need to move. Perhaps there were more than a few unresolved feelings where Tony and his death where concerned. Honestly he hadn’t wanted to think about any of it because it had been too heartbreaking. Easier to bottle it up and bury it down especially once he’d landed in 1945. He’d told himself it would be okay because he’d make sure this alternate Tony would have a better life. If Howard was cold then
Fidgeting, Toni began to move around her lab touching various things just for something to do. It was dumb. If breaking the stupid tether sent Steve back to where he wanted to be then—then why not just
Pepper didn’t say anything, just continued to stare at the picture but that was okay. Something like this took a minute to be processed and it wasn’t like Toni didn’t still have
When Toni was younger there were times that she hated how differently her mind worked when compared to other people. That she could solve things in seconds when it took other people hours. That she could just
Toni shrugged. “Official reports say the cold probably stunted his healing abilities where the tear was concerned. If there had been no tear, then the cold would have just preserved him like it did this guy. Maybe it just wasn’t meant to be.”
, watching as Tony interacted with Clint’s kids. Children just seemed to gravitate to Tony and at the time Steve had idly mused it was because they were emotionally the same age. He knew better now of course. Tony was
Plenty of women and men found Tony Prime attractive. Before settling down with Pepper he’d been quite the playboy or so the tabloids would have had everyone believe. Steve had never really thought about it for more than a passing moment but yes, Tony had been good looking. More than that his mind and the things he could come up with had made him incredibly sexy. But unfortunately Steve had found himself circling around Tony’s less than stellar qualities…or perhaps he’d just set himself up as an antagonist so that he wouldn’t be dragged into Tony’s hypnotizing orbit.
“That’s two things,” she said quietly. “Alright so I didn’t somehow lure Steve here with my red and gold wiles. How do we make it so he can stay in 1945? Can we give the tether to Peggy instead of me?”
“But why put me here in an alternate timeline? I mean is it to eventually erase me when this all disappears?” he questioned.
Avengers compound that he’d felt even a sense of home. Tony hadn’t touched their rooms though general weapons he’d stored there were missing. Everything else was the same however and sinking into his bed that night nearly made him weep. Half the population was gone, Tony was missing and everyone was adrift but for one brief minute he’d been content. Naturally he felt horrible afterwards.
“I mean everyone knows who I am already though. This will no doubt be in the paper. I can see the headlines now;
Bucky shook his head. “I’m no narc…your secrets are safe with me. You know it’s alright to see her as your Tony and think she’s…nicely proportioned, Stevie. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing.”
“Ms. Stark spends her time undertaking several humanitarian duties, as well as personally awarding scholarships to young people via her foundation. She speaks at formal events, does surprise visits to her interns and continues on as the figurehead to Stark Industries. She also spends time in Queens looking after Mr. Parker.”
She made a face. “Natasha. But most people just call me Toni. Anthony huh? Was his arc reactor bigger than mine? Don’t say yes because you might give me a complex.”
but that he always wanted to do the right thing; always wanted to save everyone that he could. She said he was so brave and quite dashing. And dad well…he thought Captain America walked on water.”
Steve snorted lightly. “True.” He reached for something on a plate and popped it into his mouth, sucking a bit of cream off his thumb.
Steve picked at the carpet, pulling up stray pieces of lint until he had a little pile. “Tony and I weren’t on speaking terms when Thanos first attacked Earth. If we’d been together—but we weren’t. It had been a year or maybe two. Sam, Natasha and I were on the run because of the whole thing with the Accords and being against them. Well I was…Natasha wasn’t. I think Sam just got involved because he’s my friend.” He paused to inhale and exhale. “Here Nat saved Bucky but there it was me. I knew what he’d done to Tony’s parents but I didn’t tell Tony. Nat and I didn’t tell him and he found out in the worst way possible. That asshole named Zemo showed him footage of Bucky murdering his parents while Bucky and I looked on. Tony asked me if I had known and I said yes. We fought. Bucky and I against Tony. That day changed everything.”
Rhodey hit Steve companionably on the shoulder. “Congrats. She’s yours for two goats and a soft pretzel.”
Steve had missed him. More than once he’d wanted to go see him but wasn’t sure if he’d be welcomed. Fear kept him from finding out until Scott returned, then not only did they have a chance to bring everyone back but he had a reason to see Tony again. Something concrete that wasn’t just for old time sake.
was actually a smart phone. A Stark Phone at that. On the bright screen was a photo of a man with dark hair and dark eyes and an impeccably trimmed beard. He was wearing a dark suit sans jacket with a blue tie and holding Cap’s shield while sporting a big grin.
Toni snorted, folding her arms over her chest. “Yeah and I’m sure the Prince Charming hair and the bulging muscles have nothing to do with it.” She slouched back against the counter. “But thanks for the assist. I knew you’d be handy to have around.”
Toni poked him in the stomach and disappeared down the hall towards the master bedroom. Once she was inside she stripped, leaving her clothes on the floor and practically skipping into the shower. The hot water felt amazing on her slightly sore muscles. She wasn’t tired but it would be nice to spend the rest of the night watching dumb movies to wind down. But first she needed to talk to Steve about what they’d touched on earlier. On her perhaps not being able to get back him to Peggy. There was no way she believed he’d be okay with staying here, not after everything he’d been through to be with Peggy again.
Normal was overrated as far as Toni was concerned. “It sucks you had to go back to 1945 to feel normal. We were pretty normal today.”
She motioned to the elevator. “You can crash if you want. You don’t have to keep me company or whatever. I actually have a few projects I should get on before people start blowing up my phone. I’ll be in my lab if you need me.”
Bucky grabbed two bottles of water from the fridge. “Hey I’ve slept in worse places. Sorry though to interrupt whatever weird thing you were currently doing.”
Steve sighed. “Alright so I was glancing in her direction. Am I supposed to pretend Toni isn’t good looking?”
“I don’t know. More often than not Tony and I were arguing about something. Never thought I would miss those fights but…”
“I don’t think she needs me to watch her back. But I’m happy that you’re looking out for her.” Realizing his food had grown a bit cold; he sighed and popped it into the microwave. “Bucky really thinks I should stay?”
Not for the first time Steve was thankful for whipcord reflexes otherwise he would have dropped his entire plate of spaghetti onto the kitchen floor. Though they were so clean he probably could have just scooped it up and ate it without consequence. But as things went he was glad that wasn’t the case, and instead turned to see Natasha leaning casually against the doorframe, red curls held out of her face with a simple clip of pearls. He cleared his throat to buy himself some time but it was
again but she’d been the one to blurt it out in the first place, which meant she sort of owed it to him to talk about. “To be honest Steve I would be hard pressed to believe there is a T. Stark out there without self worth issues. It is what it is. But those issues are what pushed me to—they are what pushed me. When someone told me I couldn’t do something or when they acted like a woman couldn’t run a company, I made sure they ate their words in the end.”
“I’m fine, Toni. I heal quickly…you know that.” His baby blues were soft as he gazed down at her. “It was worse than this but it’ll be gone soon.”
“Hey Strange, how’s the cape? What took you so long to answer? Did you have to magic your phone from the fifth dimension or something?”
Judith beamed, her eyes drifting to Toni. “Aren’t you sweet? I also do wedding cakes. Just…something to keep in mind.”
“Perhaps but I can say with crystal clarity it was not a decision my other self made lightly. Trading one man’s life for billions may sound good on paper but that’s not what he thought, because it’s not what
Steve looked for something to throw at him. “Shut up dipshit. Next sparring session I’m putting your ass through the ring.”
Steve watched his plate go around and around while Natasha’s words danced a two step inside of his head. It had only been what, two days since landing in this bizarre world so honestly he hadn’t had much time to do anything besides hold on. But if it took Strange a bit to figure stuff out, he could be here for weeks. Hell, months. What happened if he got used to everything? To training with Bucky and living in the Tower. To this new Tony… Not to mention what if Natasha was right? What if he somehow got back to 1945 and Peggy didn’t remember him being there at all?
“Yeah it doesn’t work that way but you get an A for effort.” Amused, he picked up their dirty dishes and carried them to the sink. “I’m up for the other things you want to do though. But I—we should also talk about getting me home.”
She picked up a miscellaneous wrench and smacked it against her palm. “Is he this annoying where you’re from, because he’s super annoying here. I’d heard about him when he was a doctor and it was always how much of a brilliant asshole he was. Why the universe thought someone with
Steve registered the car moving quickly and erratically; the weaving in and out of traffic making his stomach give a rather unpleasant roll. They reached the emergency room in what felt like record time, and she somehow got the attendants to give him a wheelchair as well as bypassing the waiting room to be put straight into a private room to see a doctor. He would have chastised her for it but it felt nice to be stretched out in bed, especially when the serum started to heal him.
. How could a grown man make throwing a metal Frisbee look so fucking…sexy? Technically it didn’t make any real sense and yet somehow Steve managed to pull it off. And it was so much more satisfying to see in person (and in color, ha!) as opposed to those old reels her father used to have. The sound it made as it crashed into a series of assholes before arcing back…epic. Toni didn’t want to fan girl but she couldn’t help herself. While she didn’t say anything over coms she secretly couldn’t wait to replay the footage over and over again at her leisure. For pleasure and for upgrades because she was nothing if not methodical.
“I thought it would be fun for you. Something light and stuff. If you’re bored we can do something else. See a movie or what not. I mean it’s not like you aren’t used to New York. You come from one just like it so no need to point and go
Just like when he’d crashed that plane in the Arctic. Except he’d gotten a second chance and Tony had not.
“Of course Ms. Stark,” came his dutiful reply. “Shall I contact Mr. Lang and inquire about obtaining more Pym Particles?”
“How can I top that? What’s bigger than time travel? Like Thor and Carol have already got traveling to other planets in the bag. Hm I guess I could go down since they went up. What do you think Steve? Should I go down?”
Jesus it was terrifying to be needed so badly. Idly she wondered if this was how Pepper had felt. If how Rhodey sometimes still felt when it came to her.
“I’d fight with you of course,” he replied eyes on where her fingers were tapping against her mug. “While I’m here, anytime you need me.”
Back out in the lounge area he found Toni in a wine colored tunic dressed cinched tight at the waist by a black belt. The arc reactor was nestled into place as always, the bottom hidden by tiny white buttons. She had on dark leggings and stylish shoes and it brought to mind another Tony that always looked good no matter the occasion.
, and honestly Steve had agreed. He’d assumed they would have a conversation after Thanos was defeated and ultimately they did…just not the one Steve had anticipated.
His back was totally fine now, had been mere minutes after Toni pressed the bandage into place and yet a part of him hadn’t wanted to remove it. Just the gesture of it; remembering the chastising worry in her eyes as she’d checked him out. It was dumb but none of them had been in the business of asking each other if they were okay back home. If you were alive then you were obviously fine. Yet Tony always tended to check even if he’d played it off in jest.
“Yes ma’am.” Steve chuckled much to Toni’s delight. “I have to ask, is this not strange for you at all? I mean you’re taking it pretty well.”
. She’s still Tony and it feels weird to think…” Steve trailed off, not sure how he wanted to finish that sentence. “I don’t know. I know she’s not the Tony I knew or remember but Jesus Buck, they’re so much alike. Sometimes I look into her eyes and it’s like I’ve known her for years. I showed up here and she had no reason to trust anything I was saying but she was willing to give me a chance to prove I was who I said I was. I’ve said some stupid shit to her out of misplaced anger and she’s forgiven me.”
“Look who came to threaten you to be nice to me!” Toni giggled cheerfully. “Pep this is Steve Rogers. Steve this is my Pep.”
meant she’d said something smart mouthed while Adam looked on and he apparently hadn’t appreciated it. It hadn’t been rude but not everyone understood her sense of humor.
“It would be my pleasure to assist you Captain Rogers,” Jarvis said effortlessly. “At the very least I’m sure you will want more clothes.”
“You. Where I come from it was me and Nat going up against Pierce. And then we roped Sam into the mix when we needed help.” Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “I didn’t even know it was you until we engaged in hand to hand. We’re beating the hell out of each other in the middle of the street and then I accidentally pull your mask off. It was like seeing a ghost. We uh—we went up against each other again and you nearly killed me. I think I would have let you.”
He sliced that thought off before it could fully form. “What do you know about Pym Particles?” he asked instead for the sake of his own sanity.
Unwrapping his fork from its cream colored napkin, he started to eat. “You’re welcome.” Pausing, he looked at her. “She sacrificed herself for the Soul stone. So that we could bring back everyone Thanos had snapped away.”
She could have killed him. Wanted to with a fire she’d felt for those terrorists in Gulmira but in the end Natasha had talked her down.
going on. Not to mention a part of him had feared her answer. Had feared her saying yes Pierce was still puttering around with Project Insight in his back pocket.
Tony, and honestly whatever Tony that saw the note probably wouldn’t have heeded it anyway. He still would have sacrificed himself to save the world because that’s what heroes did. They gave up
“Part of it. After realizing that time travel was a thing, I started thinking more and more about my past. About Peggy. Though if—if Tony hadn’t died I wouldn’t have gone back to 1945. I can’t say for sure how I know I wouldn’t have gone back but I just do. I was the leader of the Avengers but he was…” He exhaled deeply. “He was the heart. I don’t think all of us realized it until it was too late though. Peter knew, and Nat knew. Without Tony everything just appeared fragmented. He
” She made the sound with her left hand. “I woke up from a coma a month later with no hand and some odd scarring on my back that sorta looks like fulgurites. Consensus is had Carol not been holding me I probably would have died; that she helped absorb some of the energy. So no I’m not
Anyway with the enemy of the afternoon being some dumb guy with more weapons then brains, Bruce had decided to stay at the tower unless he was absolutely needed. After Thanos and lizard men, going head to head with some dude’s toys was like having a slap fight with a kindergartener. Yes, some kindergartners probably hit pretty hard but it still didn’t compare to having a planet thrown at you by a mad Titan. Though every time some new person popped up trying their luck at taking over the world, or taking over New York, Toni held her breath. History had a way of repeating itself and she wasn’t silly enough to think nothing else was lurking around the corner. If not more aliens, then another head of Hydra.
Judith scoffed. “I don’t want to impose. You could always fetch it later and bring it to me when you have time…” Her voice trailed off as Steve walked over. “Well now…”
“I’ll tell the team to come in tomorrow so we can get them up to speed. Send the jet for Bruce because he should be here for this. They are gonna freak out,” she said happily. “Good times all around.”
“First if anyone can take care of themselves, it’s Steve Rogers. Besides it’s not like Bruce is gonna try to cut him open. And second…I don’t know. It’s nothing so why bother anyone?”
Her smile was small and secretive. “They don’t hurt but they aren’t the only reason or even the main reason. The tower is my home and at any given time it’s filled with misfits that I’m proud to call my family. They come and go—sometimes to different planets—but the one constant is Toni. Even if she’s in L.A. or Miami for some reason she’s still
Anyone else would have slightly chastised her but Steve just laughed and shook his head as if he were charmed. He fixed her with that sad look again and then held out his arm so that she could slip the shield onto it. “It looks good on you,” she told him. “Now I’ve seen the old video clips of Cap handling his shield. No one else could throw it or catch it the way he could. Show me what you’ve got.”
In those five years Steve didn’t have much interaction with Tony; nothing that could be considered meaningful anyway. He’d attended his wedding as most of the remaining Avengers had though the ceremony itself had been a subdued affair. After that Tony and Pepper left for their lakeside cabin and Steve had thrown himself into whatever he could to keep his mind off of Thanos and the reality that his friends—that no one snapped—was ever coming back. He’d thought about Tony though and asked Natasha for information when he felt it was appropriate.
“Well if that timeline doesn’t exist anymore where exactly would he be going back to?” Rhodey questioned with a frown.
“Wow,” Pepper whispered. “He’s gorgeous. I can’t believe you’re a man in another reality. It’s hard to make sense of it—that we have clones running around out there.”
Natasha wet her lips. “James doesn’t think you should go back. He’d never say it to you though. He thinks you should give this reality a chance before you make up your mind, and I agree with him. If being where you are from is so hard perhaps this is better.” Easing off the stool, she put her juice back in the fridge. “Stick around and let Toni spoil you. She’s good at that.”
Yet it had been nice to help alleviate some of Steve’s sorrow; to cuddle with him and gaze out at the city lights as he sorted through the shit in his head. Back in the day the very
After putting all of the stones back where they belonged—it’d taken longer than he’d assumed it would, having to dodge past versions of his friends and himself at times—he’d used the Pym Particles to jump back to late 1945 to be with Peggy. Naturally she’d been confused about the whole thing and he’d explained as much as he could but it hadn’t really mattered in the end. He was there and they were together, and things could finally be as they were always meant to be.
at a problem and immediately know several ways to fix it; things others never would have thought of. Sometimes she’d hated being the smartest person in the room because not everyone understood or nurtured that sort of thing. Hell her own father hadn’t and he’d been the closest thing to an equal intelligence wise she’d had back then. But on any given day she was
“He was one handsome devil.” Toni crawled over the couch and dropped down beside him on the floor. “Mind if I get a copy of that? I want to show it to Pepper and Rhodey.”
“It’s possible I’m becoming too attached to him,” she admitted softly. “Having him around I mean. I catch myself making like, future plans of shit we could do together and then I remember he probably won’t be around that long.” Turning to her tablet, she tapped in a series of numbers and a bright blue hologram flared to life in the middle of the room. It was disjointed much like a broken mirror but all of the pieces had notes beside them. “I’ve already started working on a device that would fool the Time Wraith into thinking he belongs in that other timeline. It’s…slow going only because I’m not sure that timeline even still exists. The universe has a habit of correcting what it considers a mistake.”
ego should be in charge of a magical rock that can control time I’ll never know. Would’ve been better off giving it to a toddler.”
“Oh geeze I didn’t need any of those images,” Steve replied with a cringe and smile. “Wakandian arm?”
“True but he’s been fighting for longer than any of us have been alive. If anyone deserves to kick back and put their feet up it’s him. Besides sometimes I think a person might be just looking for something to settle down for. He found that in Peggy.”
Toni made a mental note to ask him about that. “I hope Pepper got your size right from my—ah—descriptions. If not I guess I’ll just have to take your measurements myself.”
Steve shoved his hands into his pockets. “Toni tells me that you know all about Thanos because you fought him here too, except things ended differently. Well in my reality after he was defeated I took it upon myself to return the Infinity Stones to their rightful locations. Afterwards I—I decided to stay in 1945 for…personal reasons. I was there for about a month when a Time Wraith ripped me away and dropped me here.” His bright blue eyes shifted to Toni. “Toni has been helping me and taking care of me while we try to figure stuff out.”
“Toni…” With a sigh he dragged his hand through his carefully coifed hair. “This is about you and me. Apparently it’s always been about you and me. If the situation was reversed would you blow a hole in my chest if it meant getting home?”
moments about the whole thing. To think in another universe she’d somehow made it work with Pepper to the point of vows and babies; it was amazing. However she understood here that hadn’t been in the cards for a number of reasons. They’d been on the rocks for a while before the Mandarin incident because of her paranoia and afterwards while things had gotten better, it hadn’t lasted long. By the time Ultron almost happened they were well and truly over.
It was obvious that Steve didn’t miss fighting—he had retired after all—but there was something to be said about him on a battlefield. The way he fought; how he used his body while in combat and seemed completely aware of his surroundings at all times. How fast he moved and how his strength was just a small facet of the things he could do. He anticipated his opponent’s movements, used their own momentum against them to catch them off guard and ultimately knock them into the middle of next week.
that timeline but it would be as if he were never there or—and this is what we’d be hoping for—as if he left. ‘Cause if he was there and left that’s easier to explain than having to start from scratch. I can’t be sure without a peek or evidence and I think I might need Strange for that.” Toni closed the hologram. “Providing he is willing to help me. I was worried he’d be more concerned about Steve being here but he didn’t really bat an eyelash. I guess
Pepper smirked. “You feel like you already know me? Mm well it’s understandable if what Toni has told me is true, and this doesn’t sound like something even she could make up. However preconceived notions never did anyone any good.”
“Sounds like something her and my Tony have in common.” Steve paused. “She uh, she’s a bit less encumbered though that my Tony. I know that some of it is because we don’t have that volatile history but it’s more than that.”
Glancing down at the top of her dark head, he smiled to himself at the oddness of the situation. The idea of resting on a couch while Tony Prime slumped against him was so foreign he’d never considered it. Tony was a tactile person but he’d never been that way with
“Well not to me but Pepper thinks I should give other people chances to be philanthropic too.” Shrugging, Toni crossed over to the broken treadmill and gave it a pat. “Your watch is over, good buddy. Don’t worry I’ll make sure your sisters and brothers don’t suffer the same fate.”
. I can go down to her workshop and she’s all over it…and if I make enough noise she’ll pop up on a screen asking me what the hell I’m doing. Always willing to drop everything to come back if need be.” She headed for the doorway. “She said you didn’t have that where you are from. The Tower I mean. James and I aren’t here as much as I’d like so you staying would work out for me. Maybe I’m selfish but I’d feel better knowing Toni had someone on hand to watch her back. Besides DUM-E and Jarvis that is.”
Rhodey grasped her wrist—the one with the artificial hand—and just sat there, letting her hug him until her heart’s content. After all these years Toni still had no idea what she’d do without Rhodey. She had no clue as to what type of person she would be without his calming influence, and she was happy she’d never had to find out. Stuck in that cave surrounded by the desert heat, she’d known if Rhodey was alive he was looking for her even if no one else was. That he wouldn’t stop until he found her…and in the end she’d been right. Granted she’d escaped on her own (not excluding Yinsen’s contribution at all) but it wasn’t a surprise that the first face she saw afterwards was Rhodey’s.
“Or maybe it just went over your head?” She suggested. “I can’t imagine someone taking one look at you and deciding
Groaning, Steve flopped back to the pillows and raked a hand over his face. “No, thanks Jarvis but I’m okay. What time is it?”
“Something tells me you did more than stand there, Steve. If I know the other me he—he went out like a boss. He saw what needed to be done and he did it because there was no other option. No other solution except the one he could make.” Her eyes lowered to the floor. “It’s what I’d do. I flew a nuke through a space portal because it had to be done. Scared the hell out of me and I figured it was a one way trip, but what was the alternative? Everyone dies? Being a hero is about sacrifice. It’s messy and at times thankless, yet he
an expresso maker but I let him have one because when I want to poison him it’ll be the easiest to go for.”
. It took Pepper a while to realize I was flirting with her because she wasn’t expecting it. And I wasn’t exactly someone people took seriously. Or maybe he didn’t want you to know he was flirting with you.”
“I heard you.” Strange smirked. “And before you say it yes I know what love is. But it’s a big step to commit yourself to another time on the off chance that things may work out. From what I’ve read about Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter they never exactly spent an ample amount of time together than wasn’t fighting a war. That means adrenaline comes into play which can heighten otherwise benign emotions. Most of their
Toni slouched so that she could rest her head against his shoulder. “I know the feeling. Everything wasn’t roses and sunshine here either. People say things happen for a reason but I think that’s bullshit. But it’s nicer than saying life is a random collection of accidents. I guess you can look at it as…things happen that get you where you need to be. And sometimes those things have to be utterly terrible.”
She fumbled for a black mug. “I was half asleep when I got a new idea for a Stark watch. Thought I would draw up some plans. Why are
“I…” Trailing off, he thought back to the strained relationship he’d had with his Tony in the beginning. How Tony had only ever called him Captain or Rogers or some other made up name, somehow making each sound like a dig against him. And then slowly over time he’d became Cap and Steve…until a bunker in Siberia turned those just as hollow as the others. Made them sound vicious in Tony’s mouth, laced with pain and betrayal.
Toni flinched. Not a lot—anyone else probably would have missed it but he saw it and immediately felt like an asshole. “Toni I’m sorry. I—”
“I’d known about what you did to Howard and Maria for a while and I’d kept it from Tony. I said it was to protect him but…it was more for me than him. Zemo showed him footage of you murdering them and—and fuck. It’s us against Tony.” Steve frowned deeply. “He wanted to kill you and I couldn’t let that happen. What you did as the Soldier wasn’t your fault. But he wouldn’t—he wouldn’t…I kept thinking if he would just stop, if he would just
And there it was. The answer to the question Toni had been wondering since he started telling this depressing tale. It shaped so much of Steve and it was like he didn’t even realize it. Pushed it aside or down—something she was familiar with—until it could be morphed into something that made sense. Tony Prime was dead and Steve needed it to make sense so he was replaying
Steve held his hand out to be shook again and Rhodey complied. “I get it. And you don’t have to worry about me. I also just want what’s best for Toni.”
to make it out of old timey bubble gum wrappers but she argued against it. Anyway as you can see water does it in a pinch. It’s like when you toss a toaster into a bathtub.”
Steve’s expression—which had already been gentle—practically melted. There were a thousand different unsaid things in his eyes looking like they were all bursting to get out. “You’d do that for me?” he questioned before shaking his head. “What am I saying of course you would… I wouldn’t let it come to that. I’d just go.”
“I see,” Jarvis said slowly. “Friday is Ms. Stark’s back up assistant program. She is a very capable AI.”
“I’ve never thought so. I have always enjoyed your conversation,” Jarvis said truthfully. “Besides I had thought you would be spending time with Colonel Rhodes. You were very excited for his arrival earlier.”
A small part of Toni assumed they’d reconnect when the world calmed down but it wasn’t in the cards. Instead she watched Pepper and Happy grow closer and closer, though to their credit they did try to fight it, probably worried about her feelings. It hurt—of course—but Toni wasn’t the type to let others suffer if there was anything she could do to stop it. So she’d offhandedly given her blessing one day while they were all trapped on a private flight to India. Promised she’d be fine, that she just wanted them happy.
That annoyed Steve to the point where he found himself scrubbing so hard at a plate that he was rubbing the bright red roses off. “But they didn’t appear when we were collecting the stones. Wouldn’t that be a big deal? Traveling through time with the sole purpose of bringing back half of the population?”
pastries Toni had ever tasted. Really they were like a religious experience and Toni regularly ordered more than she should but who could turn down a honey drizzled glazed donut? Or twenty-four?
There was a tiny wrinkle between Steve’s brows but whether it was from anger or confusion was anyone’s guess. “She was a he, actually. Anthony Stark. Iron Man,” he replied. “And honestly they’re like two peas in a pod sometimes. I see differences; some small and others gigantic. But if I had to pick one thing they have in common it would be the selfless desire to protect even if it means they suffer in the process. And shouldering blame even when they aren’t at fault.”
“A little anxious,” he admitted. “We didn’t have many team dinners back home, and even if we had this is still different. I know everyone and yet I’m still a stranger.”
Considering that information would probably be useful to have, Toni agreed. “Alright. J call Strange and let’s get this show on the road. Keep your fists ready just in case, Steve.”
Pepper surveyed him with a critical eye before shaking his hand. “It’s nice to meet you, Captain Rogers. I’ve been hearing interesting things about you.”
Smiling, she squeezed his thumb but didn’t let go and suddenly he was reminded of a handshake that perhaps went on a little too long, as if neither participant wanted to let go that time either. If he’d known it was the last time he’d ever shake that hand he’d probably be still holding on right now.
meant she’d have a target on her back, one her last name couldn’t always shield her from. And one that sometimes her last name just caused more problems. She’s been through a lot of shit but Toni has always been one of the strongest people I’ve ever known.
His brows rose towards his hairline. “How are you going to prove I am who I say I am? I really don’t have a stamp, Toni, but if you want to look that bad…”
Steve stretched his arms out in front of him and Toni smirked but didn’t say anything. He rolled his eyes without any heat and said, “Any theories on who sent those assholes to terrorize us?”
Toni jogged around a corner and ducked into a nondescript alcove that almost appeared to be a building flaw, if not for the fancy black keypad that only tended to be revealed when Jarvis deemed it so. She typed in the code, stretched her eyes wide for the retinal scan and then slipped inside once a door hissed open. Inside was an array of different things that she’d collected over the years; gadgets and paintings and old Avengers gear that she’d long since upgraded. Sometimes she destroyed them but other times she kept them around for sentimental value.
The woman shushed him and pushed him into the front seat of her car. “What you need is a doctor and a bunch of x-rays to prove you don’t have internal bleeding.”
Steve rubbed at the back of his neck. Seeing Natasha would throw him if it came to it but he’d deal. He’d adjust. “I think so. Now that I know what to expect.”
He wet his lips. “The Accords. They didn’t happen here, did they? I mean I’ve brought them up several times but you’ve never really commented on them.”
Sticking out her lower lip, she huffed. “You’re a mean man. However if those are your terms then I accept. It totally stops me. I’ll make it stop me.”
Before Steve could reply the door to the lab hissed open so that Toni and Rhodey could step inside. That slightly haunted look was no longer in Toni’s eyes, so he reckoned she must have talked things out with Rhodey. That made complete sense considering how close they were, but Steve already knew he was going to pull her aside the next chance he got to make sure she was okay. There wasn’t much he could do if she wasn’t but sometimes one just needed to be a shoulder to lean on. His shoulders were more than sturdy enough to carry whatever was bothering Toni.
. So we roll up to his planet and the battle for the universe begins. Carol takes him on head to head and he has to call in his lackeys to get a foothold. She manages to yank the gauntlet off of him though and it goes bouncing across the ground.”
. The whole ordeal—and seeing Peggy in 1970—made him tired and long for something he’d always figured he couldn’t have anymore. But the stones would need to be returned to their precise timelines…so he volunteered because he was Captain America and Captain America fixed what was broken. This time? He’d also fix himself. Perhaps it was a bit selfish but after seventy years wasn’t he due a bit of selfishness? A bit of happiness?
“Well that’s up to you.” Bucky stood. “However I wouldn’t run for the hills just because I thought Stark had a nice ass.”
Before Steve could argue or whatever he planned to do, Bucky was clapping him on the shoulder and leaving the room.
but in the end he had to be the one to finish it. And all I could do was stand there. A super soldier—peak of human perfection—and all I could do was stand there while my friend died.”
Steve nodded. “It is.” He watched as she turned his uniform this way and that, slender fingers smoothing over the Avengers logo on the shoulder. “You—Tony made it for me. My Tony.”
“Abuse!” Toni shouted. “But I’ll let it slide because you’re one of my favorite people. And you’re coming with me to that charity dinner for first responders.”
“You’ve got quite a few tales, don’t cha pretty boy?” Without waiting for a reply she hopped out of her car and headed across the garage. “Up! I gotta hit my vault. Hey Jarvis, unlock the elevator for my broad shouldered friend will ya? And open up the vault! Mama needs one of her toys.”
“Oh?” Grinning he took her seat at the counter, hands resting in his lap. “Are—are you actually going to share your feelings with me? Wow. You really are
it. Sleeping was bad because I had to find a good position that didn’t make it feel like it was crushing anything. Eventually I sort of got used to it more out of necessity that anything else. Don’t miss it though.”
So she worked on her experiments and fired off texts and wandered around the Tower enjoying her second chance at life to the fullest. Having Steve on hand though…well it was interesting to see all of the empty little pockets he was filling.
“And what if I can’t do it?” Her big brown eyes fixed on his face. “What if I can’t get you back to Peggy?”
Toni’s relationship with Captain America had been complicated because on the one hand she’d resented how important he’d been to her father, but on the other hand she’d totally absorbed that love and admiration for him that everyone else seemed to have. That and staring at posters of that perfect bone structure had been an enjoyable pastime.
There was a pop in Steve’s ears and a myriad of colors exploded behind his eyes, distorting his vision. He sunk down to the floor as his chest tightened; signaling the oncoming panic attack. They’d been frequent after first getting out of the ice. Waking up from a bad nightmare drenched in a cold sweat, unable to catch his breath because what if he was still there? What if waking up seventy years in the future was just a weird dream his inactive mind came up with? And he wasn’t relatively safe and sound but frozen solid in the cold. In the dark. All alone.
“Didn’t stop you from being a hero to a lot of people. As a symbol and as the actual thing,” Toni responded matter of fact. “I mean I…may or may not have had your poster over my bed as a kid.”
room. There was so much space to hang pictures and have couches for a cozy little art nook. Toni had gotten him his own mini fridge because she said he couldn’t trust anyone when it came to desserts, not even her. And the view; the view was simply spectacular. There was something about the wide open windows that made him feel at peace. Waking up to the sun warming his face—as if Jarvis just knew he’d want the curtains open—and the blue sky stretching on forever, it made his choices seem  limitless.
“Hm.” Rhodey folded his arms across his chest. “Strange to think there was room for two of those assholes. Or more.”
“Well okay you’re going to need stuff while you’re here but you let me and Jarvis handle that. Not that you’re like on house arrest or anything. You can go where you please…I doubt anyone will really pay too much attention to you unless to like, check out the hot guy.”
One minute he’d had his Cap uniform in an old duffle bag, telling Peggy they needed a safer place to keep it instead of their closet—
Groaning he stumbled against a set of dumpsters, eyes wide and chest heaving as he realized he was back in the future. Flashes of escaping S.H.I.E.L.D’s facility after first waking up pushed themselves to the forefront of his mind but he shook them away. He made to take a step forward when a noise behind him caught his attention. Slowly he turned and watched in horrified fascination as a—well he didn’t know
She was at the door to his room when he caught her, wrapping strong fingers around her small wrist. “Toni, wait. Thank you.” He opened his mouth to say more but instead pulled her close for a hug.
Toni stood and stretched with a loud groan, bones popping as she twisted. “For the record I like how you keep standing up for guy Tony. Warms the cockles of my non shrapnel filled chest to think he had someone like you in his corner. All Tonys must be protected at all costs…as the internet is fond of saying. Now! Barring rabid frogs what do you want to do today? I have a few ideas but you’ll probably veto like five of them however in my defense having my very own Captain America shirtless calendar is something I need—nay deserve.”
“I’m not Hydra. I am from a universe where things are the same but different. Toni can explain it better than I can,” Steve admitted. “In my reality Toni is a man. Iron Man. Well he—he was. He died helping to defeat Thanos. But most of the people who exist here also exist there.” He decided not to mention that Nat was also dead. “You’re there…or a version of you. Seventy years after I’m pulled out of the ice and working for SHIELD, the Winter Soldier shows up and tries to assassinate Nick Fury. And then me and Natasha. Apparently SHIELD had been infiltrated by Hydra for years and was finally making their move.”
“He is,” Pepper admitted with a chuckle. “So can I meet the infamous Steve Rogers or do you plan to keep him all to yourself?”
to know. “Buck I—how are you here? Don’t get me wrong I’m happy that you’re not still under Hydra’s control but I sort of played a big part in breaking their hold on you. I assumed without me…well…”
Toni huffed. “I think you’re equally to blame but since it’s two best friends getting to be the terrors they missed out on I won’t make a fuss. Might even rebuild it so that the next time you use it, it puts you through a wall.”
Returning to his room, Steve got a quick shower and slipped into dark jeans and a black t-shirt before combing his hair back out of his face. Wearing modern clothes wasn’t something he’d thought he’d do again, not until they became fashionable of course. And even then he assumed he’d be too old to care. While in Washington he’d wore what everyone else wore to fit in, or to blend in. After being on the run and dealing with existing after the snap, he hadn’t cared much about being how he
Steve heard the car slam on breaks but because of the rain there was no real traction. It hit him square in the side, sending him crashing into a couple of garbage cans someone had left out on the curve. His ribs flared with pain and he rolled onto his back, blinking slowly as rain pelted him in the face.
Honestly the whole thing just made Steve disappointed that there hadn’t been more dinners and downtime back at Tony Prime’s tower. He’d say they should have made time but really, none of them had thought
“No need to throw yourself on that grenade. Besides after what you’d been through you should be able to call wherever you want home. Strange isn’t God—he doesn’t get the final say. And if he tries we’ll tell him about how his doppelganger basically set the other me up to die, guilt tripping him into helping you get back to Peggy. This is a foolproof plan.”
it was, some kind of tattered robe draped thing—rise out of the ground and screech at him. It had hollow holes for eyes and fangs for teeth, and it screamed directly at him like he’d somehow managed to offend it simply by standing there.
right here, you on the ground and bleeding could happen. Shit. Okay c’mon I’m taking you to the hospital.”
Without warning he was sliding into her path and cutting off her steps. His hands came up to grasp her shoulders before smoothing down to circle her wrists. Startled she blinked up at him, the sound of the wrench clattering to the floor falling on deaf ears. “Please don’t,” he said faintly. “Toni being here with you isn’t some hardship I’m forced to put up with. It’s—well it’s not where I saw myself that’s true but it’s—it’s not
Grabbing up her jacket, she slipped it on and motioned for him to follow her. “C’mon. If anyone says anything just smile and nod. They’ll be too busy swooning for a follow up.”
They finally got their dance…and quite a few more in the following month. Made so many plans for their future together. And yes in the back of his mind he knew this would create an alternate timeline or whatever but that would be okay. He couldn’t change his past anyway so the odds of things
He smirked. “I think you already know the answer to that question. Now why did you want to know about—” He abruptly cut himself off as his eyes landed on Steve. “Ah.”
Toni shook her head. “Nope he’s actually Steve Rogers. Vetted and verified. In his reality they did the whole Thanos song and dance, so you can imagine that drama. He wanted to settle down in 1945 but the aforementioned time monster kicked him here instead.”
Sitting at the kitchen counter with his sketchbook open in front of him, Steve found himself shading in familiar dark eyes with lovely long lashes. He’d made it a point to draw both Tonys side by side, one eying the other with amusement. Having actual downtime to draw wasn’t something he’d brought into the future with him. There was always work to be done or things he needed to catch up on. At most he’d find himself doodling during check ins with Fury. Now that he could enjoy his artsy side again he realized how much he’d missed it. After mentioning it briefly to Toni she’d placed an order for some serious high grade supplies; hence the art nook in his room.
“It’s this tone you get in your voice, like you’re holding in so much emotion it weighs down your vocal chords. Makes your voice a little deeper…to give your words more importance,” she explained stroking her fingers down the front of his throat.
“Then focus on the future,” Bucky interrupted. “I can’t bring Howard and Maria back, but I can fight alongside their kid when she needs it. So I do.”
The fingers on Bucky’s metal hand tapped restlessly against his thigh; the arm itself a shiny black with what looked like gold threading. “Natasha. A long time ago in the Red Room I was the one who trained her. We worked a few missions together and sometimes things got…personal between us. But with the mind wipes it’s not like I remembered. When I was set up to take out Fury I was thrown back into her orbit. Pierce got wind of her contacting Stark for help after Fury ‘died’ and guess who he sent to handle them?”
Her laugh was sudden and loud. She even let out a little snort that was sort of adorable. “While I usually never turn down the chance to check out a fine ass, I actually have a more foolproof idea. But it’s a surprise. For right now I…tentatively believe you…”
totally implied. Tony was supposed to live and you were supposed to carry on together. Instead he died for you and everyone else…and that’s fucked you up. Would it be wrong to say that you probably thought
“You’re terrible.” He laughed again, cheeks faintly pink. “Changing the subject—I thought we worked very well together. Very cohesive. Kinda felt like I shouldn’t have been giving orders though but in the moment…”
“You have a point,” Steve responded with a touch of amusement. “Otherwise I’d just be giving into Toni’s mad shirtless plans for me.”
Easing down beside her, Pepper rubbed her thigh. “Well now you have the chance to get to know him. And so do I. How long will he be staying?”
Bruce and Rhodey snorted in unison. “I’ve been running routine diagnostics,” Bruce replied with a smirk. “Steve’s cells are incredible. That accident in the artic must have been very severe for the Steve Rogers here not to survive.”
Now that she was down here surrounded by things that brought her joy, she kind of didn’t want to leave. Just the smell of metal and burnt wires put her at ease.
Steve had been struck dumb. It was one thing to see Nat again; he’d been more or less prepared for that but Bucky? Without him being there to get through to him he was sure Bucky was still the Winter Soldier. Still deep under Hydra’s control and doing God knows what. Truth be told he’d wanted to ask Toni about SHIELD and if they’d been compromised but there was already
She wasn’t about to admit out loud that Barnes’ idea wasn’t terrible, especially as a last ditch effort. If things got out of control quickly she’d shut everything down and drag the armor home if she had to. Hopefully however it wouldn’t come to that. So far the ring leader of this rag tag band of whatevers hadn’t shown his or her face, which meant the situation could go either way. Could be someone bent on world domination, or just a very intelligent person bored out of their mind. It was hard to say which was more dangerous.
“It is,” he said faintly. “You know I didn’t even know this was on my phone until a few days after his funeral. I—there hadn’t really been time to check it out. It was more for emergencies anyway in case our communicators messed up. He’d use the suit to hack into the phone.”
“Fuck. Sounds familiar.” Bucky rubbed his chin. “Okay. Steve rescues me during the war. Where? And what’s the first thing we say to each other?”
“You can still resent him. I sort of resent my parents for leaving me.” Show and tell over, she snapped her hand back into place and wiggled her fingers. “You said whatever it takes but you didn’t
“My name is Steve Rogers.” Steve offered a hand to be shook and Strange took it. “I’m from…well another reality.”
no point. If the multi-verse exists it’s a chaotic place formed randomly, and trying to make sense of it would explode your brain.”
Steve chuckled; his heart was still racing, beating a staccato rhythm against his ribcage. “I’ll be there in a minute.” Guessing that Jarvis relayed his message to Toni, he crawled out of bed and made his way into the bathroom. Splashed cold water onto his face and stared at his reflection, resisting the urge to grip the sink and ultimately rip it from its mooring.  “I’m sorry, Peggy. I’m so sorry.”
But so Captain America was considered MIA for years until he wasn’t, and then he was finally laid to rest and people started talking about how nice it was to finally have him home. “It’s what he deserved,” they’d said. “Now he can finally rest in peace.” Toni got the sentiment but…oh well. That wouldn’t have satisfied her father and had Aunt Peggy been really able to comprehend information it wouldn’t have satisfied her either.
“After the shit I’ve seen? It’s just another Thursday. I mean it is a bit surreal to be sitting here with maybe Captain America from another reality. And yes I do wanna pepper you with questions, so many questions about where you’re from and the others there, but you got socked in the head pretty hard earlier and I don’t wanna break you. Just in case.” She wiggled her brows at him. “Once you past my test however all bets are off! You can ask me stuff too…unless you think you know me already.”
. Nothing that Tony didn’t also send to say Bruce and Carol. Iron Man wasn’t seen as much either but perhaps that was because crime went down drastically. And well now that he was a family man Tony knew where his priorities were.
Crackers forgotten, Toni grabbed something out of the fridge with a big smile. “Yes honey bear is finally on his way! I’m gonna go get a shower so that I’m fresh and clean for when you guys meet.” She turned to leave but caught sight of his drawing. “Wow that’s really good. Hey can I have that when you’re done? I wanna frame it…or put it on the fridge.” He nodded wordlessly and then she was off, disappearing down the hall.
The love and fondness that Toni felt for him manifested in a bright grin that she couldn’t have hidden even if she’d wanted to. “Hi.”
She wasn’t upset at Steve’s revelation about Barnes and the ensuing drama his appearance had caused in Steve’s reality. Perhaps in the past it would have stung but to be honest, Steve picking Barnes made sense considering all they’d been through. Though she supposed she could say that having not been in the situation, unlike Tony Prime. Still she also understood the pain he’d felt at being discarded because
Rhodey shrugged. “I’ve met a talking raccoon and a talking tree. Captain America from a different universe almost makes the most sense. However Toni hasn’t had time to really fill me in on the details.”
“Pardon the interruption, Ms. Stark…” Jarvis sounded downright regretful for breaking the tender moment but his voice caused Steve to gently release Toni, his face hot and a little pink. He honestly couldn’t remember the last time he’d blushed, or why he was even blushing now.
It was a thread she would pick at. Maybe that was why she asked, “Are you being super nice to me because you feel guilty for how you treated Tony Prime?”
, since we’re both in the hero business and all. Kinda feel like he might just be trying to get me into bed though.”
“I would,” Steve replied. “Nothing good comes from lying to your friends. But the tether doesn’t bother me. How could I not like something keeping me safe? I’d rather be chained here—literally and magically—than hurling through space forever.”
As she shampooed her hair her mind drifted to shirtless Steve in all his super serum glory. God he was one gorgeous ass man. Of course if his personality was shit his looks wouldn’t matter at all. Well, okay they would a little since asshole had never been a deal breaker for her. But that was the past. Truthfully she didn’t have the patience for an overly cocky pretty boy; just one of the reasons why she’d never accept Strange’s invitation for dinner.
She drummed her fingers on the table. “I did. Sounds like the difference is Carol showing up when the big lizard things oozed out of the portal and started wrecking everything. We hadn’t met her before then. She caught me when I lost consciousness and afterwards we became pretty good friends. She shares my sarcastic sense of humor.”
“Yeah that sounds like something a Stark would say.” Steve snickered, feeling better about, well just feeling better. He was still going to talk to Toni about Siberia however. He just needed to. “Toni made plans for us to hang out but afterwards if you want to go for a run or whatever I’m down. See who’s faster.”
Whizzing around to the back of the line, Toni fired directly at the street, heating up the asphalt until it was thick like hot fudge. The soldiers tried to keep marching but found it extremely difficult; their black boots getting stuck as the road quickly hardened, trapping some of them in place. It was easy to then blast their heads to pieces. The ones she missed Steve took out with the shield. It bounced between them like a ball in a pinball machine probably hitting a new high score.
only a matter of time before he sought her out. Of course it was just as likely that Jarvis had told on her. You could never be sure when it came to sentient AIs that housed a mothering streak.
“Ooh you cougar you.” Toni chuckled. “You should let me do something nice for you guys. Sexy weekend in Hawaii maybe? I think they have nude beaches.”
Anyway though after easing into a parking space and cutting the engine, she’d just stared at him…alright she was still staring at him. The entire situation was insane but she’d seen aliens pour out of a hole in the sky so, yeah. She’d roll with it. Besides if a raccoon could talk then a Steve Rogers from a different reality could tumble into hers. Finding out why was the real point, and maybe getting him home later if that’s what he wanted.
a Tony thing to say. “Toni.” Exhaling deeply he forced himself to look at her. She was sans armor again and close, smelling like metal and expensive perfume. “I think I’m losing my mind.”
“You’re like a freaking space heater.” Toni knocked her forehead to his bicep. “Surprised you didn’t melt all that ice within a year.”
mirror the components needed to act as a successful tether. Steve, what was the Toni like of your world? Was she similar to this one?”
There was one time he could remember above the others because it was mere weeks before SHIELD revealed its Hydra heads. Tony had called him up asking him if he wanted to try this new sushi place that had just opened up in Vegas. Offered to fly him out (
Laughing, Steve put his sketchbook off to the side and sat up. “I’m not sure how to reply to that but from what I saw, Pepper didn’t have any complains when it came to dating you. You really ought to stop selling yourself short, Toni. By now and after so many years you should realize how amazing you are.”
Bruce chuckled. “That does make all the difference. Since Thanos things have been…well let’s just say not much tends to phase us anymore. We’re not complacent but going through all of that changed us. Me quite literally.”
“No uh, no.” He cleared his throat as he came back to himself. “It’s just…I don’t really consider myself
She made a face. “Steve please stop thanking me, you’re gonna give me the heebie and the jeebies. It’s…fine. You need help and I can provide it.”
She shook the fence. “We’ll figure out the details later. Do you want me to hack the ball thing and give you a real challenge?” She motioned to the people that were starting to pay attention to him. “Give the people a thrill.”
anyway though. And no doubt Bucky would be telling her everything because when it came to Nat he became less a metal armed killing machine, and more of a metal armed bunny.
Steve all but pouted. “It’s not the same, Toni. They aren’t my Dodgers anymore. But thank you for the offer.”
Steve came awake at once, looking around frantically before ultimately realizing where he was. “Toni,” he said slowly. “So this wasn’t a dream, huh?”
“Duh yes.” She put her hands on her hips. “Might take a few but if guy me can do it then I can to. And I’ll make mine prettier. However what you should be asking is can I make something to keep the Time Wraith from chucking you out of 1945 again. And yes Virginia I can. Most likely…as soon as we figure out why they don’t want you there in the first place. Jarvis can you set aside some play time for me to start on that?”
“I bet you could make anything if you put your mind to it. I mean another you did figure out time travel.”
“Eh you never know. In any case if I can’t die in an expensive nursing home surrounded by hot nurses, then blaze of glory would be my second option.”
want it to have her physical prowess when it comes to fighting. It’s totally for sparring practice when Nat is away.”
“Yes. I believe you were having a nightmare, sir.” The curtains slid open by their own volition, letting bright sunlight into the room. “Should I alert Ms. Stark?”
The words sounded nice to hear but Toni got the distinct feeling they weren’t as cut and dry as they seemed. But then nothing about Steve was cut and dry. He had the eyes of a man who’d seen too much in a short amount of time, and she tried to remember how she’d felt while going up against Thanos. Helpless, hopeless and utterly dejected were just a few adjectives that came to mind.  Things got better but you didn’t forget. Remembering was important.
reality. Like your world but with marked differences. Of course I’d have to look into the science and maybe check you over for that Captain America stamp I heard is supposed to be on your ass.  This all hedges on you actually being Steven Grant Rogers and not just a cute mental patient. As for why the Wraith would put you here? No clue. Yet.”
Another reality; he could try to wrap his head around that. “There is no stamp but I am Captain America. Don’t—am I not here?”
Shaking her head, she splashed cold water onto her face, letting the droplets drip down her neck. “No but I will be looking into it. We don’t want to be caught unaware especially if next time they escalate to something bigger. Let’s hope it’s someone that wants money or whatever. I find those bad guys easier to deal with than the ones that want to be like, King of New York.” She huffed. “But first I want a hot shower and pjs. And maybe a sundae. I’ll find you after I’m done.”
“The helicarrier we were fighting on exploded with us on board. I went into the Potomac and you pulled me out—saved my life. That’s when I knew my best friend was in there somewhere and that I—I had to get him back. No matter what.”
make up for it, speak up about it. Yes it would be weird to be Uncle Steve but he already knew it was better to have Tony in his life as
“There is still time for you to have children Toni if you want them,” Steve replied with a grin. “Older—erm—there is just still time.”
“Thank you. Unfortunately, it comes with the job.” Steve cleared his throat and angled for a subject change. “So are you still an Avenger or…?”
) but Steve had scoffed at the idea. Who in their right mind would fly over three thousand miles just for sushi? And Tony had laughed in that way he did and said
She nodded and tapped her finger against the metal. “So they found Captain America with his shield naturally and decided most of his things should be put in a museum. It was a piece of history and history should be shared with the world. Now that’s all well and good but there are idiots out there who would try to steal it, melt it down because of its nature and do all sorts of things afterwards. SHIELD thought it made more sense to put a replica in the museum and keep the real thing deep in their concrete bowels.”
Toni could understand that. More time to just be Bucky and Steve instead of Soldier and Cap. “I watch him and Natasha spar some times. Then I leave before they do something that blinds me. We should spar. I could put on the suit and you could not hit me because I’m a lady.”
“Yes ma’am,” Steve replied earnestly. “I know you aren’t the Pepper I’m familiar with but I hope we can become friends. I’d like that anyway.”
Steve’s mouth quirked into a tiny grin. “Point taken. Though I don’t think there is a reality out there where Toni Stark would die of something so trivial.”
She strolled over to the railing and looked down, hands rubbing at the smooth metal. “Yup. I kinda own a farm. Moving on I won’t be nosy and ask what you and Rhodey talked about because I have an idea. I’d apologize but it does make me warm and fuzzy when people have my back.”
“No I get what you’re saying I just…it’s weird.” She pinched the bridge of her nose and drummed her fingers on the countertop. “Theoretically a being such as a Time Wraith could also be connected to speed and I mean if anything is made up of dark matter, it’s definitely those guys. But speed itself didn’t have anything to do with Steve’s trip. That was more quantum mechanics and Tony Prime’s brilliance. I just—” Leaning back in her chair, she rocked it from side to side. “Huh. Alright it’s possible that the Wraith was called because of the buildup of energy that Steve had to have been carrying from putting the stones back to where they belonged. Maybe all of that energy was supposed to go back to his actual reality and when he
experience it. There is no need to break yourself simply because you can be put back together again. And anyone that would ask that of you is a dick.”
“Yeah.” He wanted to ask about SHIELD being compromised but there was something else tickling at the back of his mind. Something bigger. “You said you knew about Thanos and the stones. I—how did that go down for you? Were people not dusted? It took us five years to come up with a plan because that’s how long it took for Scott to get out of the Quantum Realm.”
Still watching Toni remind herself that he wasn’t always going to be around didn’t make him feel very good. She knew this arrangement wasn’t permanent but he supposed it had skipped her mind for a minute. Sometimes it skipped his too.
Villains tended to have patience. They’d simply plot for years and years because they realized they only had one real shot to get anything done. Once they were out in the open, once they revealed that they existed they no longer had the element of surprise.
“No, no nothing like that.” He shrugged. “We just—we never got the time to spar just for the hell of it. Back home if we were fighting it was because he was trying to kill me. I kind of wish there’d been time to just mess around in the ring because we could.”
She considered his question. “No. Wait. No It—it’ll be fine. This city has survived the Chitauri, Thanos and Bruce when Starbucks ran out of pumpkin spice lattes. You might want to grab an umbrella though.” Before anyone could reply, she blew the front valve off the nearest fire hydrant, sending a cascade of cold water gushing up into the air. Picking up a car door that had accidentally been ripped off, she used it to direct the flow so that it flowed over the soldiers. “Shower time!”
Steve—who’d been taking a sip from his water bottle—coughed as he started to choke just a little. “Wh—what?”
“It’s strange to hear about events here yet know I wasn’t apart of them. I keep trying to work out how things were solved without me around.”
“Yeah I get that. Do you not think you deserve forgiveness because of the Siberia stuff?” Bucky inquired. “Because it seems like water under the bridge no matter what reality you come from.”
Toni picked up a wrench just to have something in her hand. “That’s doubtful. He wants to get back to Peggy and honestly I don’t blame him. Aunt Peggy was awesome. Anyone would want to be in her orbit… Plus they have their whole
Toni opened her mouth to reply but a doctor finally came in, looking quite curious as to why they were sitting on the floor. Although Steve was sure he was completely healed by now he let himself get a cursory check up, glad there was no need to have blood taken or whatever. He was given a clean bill of health but told they would keep him for a few hours
“I told you that I can’t make it though I can see why you’ve forgotten…” Pepper inclined her head towards Steve. “I have to be in Zurich remember? For a meeting with
Rhodey snorted again but he was smiling. He extended a hand and Steve shook it. “It’s nice to meet you, Steve.”
Captain. Though don’t tell Carol I said that. But he’s Captain America. Granted from another reality but he’s the real deal. Got stranded here by a time monster…sort of.”
She grinned. “Sure. You can retire here and become Toni’s new assistance. She couldn’t stop singing your praises when we spoke.”
Of course she did. She wasn’t an idiot. At this point she fucking bled red and gold. “I’m Steve’s tether.
Toni snickered but squinted at him. The things he said sometimes… “Ha ha. Anyway my penthouse is on the top floor but you probably already know that. I’m not sure right off hand who has what floor but I do know the guest suite on the floor under mine is free if you wanna claim it for now. Why don’t you go on up to the penthouse while I grab that surprise I mentioned earlier.”
Snickering at her own dumb thoughts, she turned her attention back to the task at hand. An army of literal plastic-like soldiers—like people sized G.I. Joes—were currently marching down Park Avenue, shooting at anything that moved with some type of laser rifles. Natasha and Barnes were picking them off from behind a few parked cars while Rhodey flew overhead, drawing some of their fire as he dropped tiny bombs onto them. They exploded like confetti; body parts flying this way and that.
“Rhodey look what I’ve got.” Toni poked him in the shoulder and gestured to Steve. “May I present Captain Steven Rogers aka Captain Amercia. Fresh from another universe and still with that brand new Captain America smell.”
“Alright chief you’re really making a good case here,” she breathed. “This is gorgeous work and it does look like something I would come up with because I do gorgeous work. Enforced against concussion blasts for optimal protection and dark for stealth purposes, but still very Captain America-y. You’ll have to model it for me. However the million dollar question; where is the shield?”
Toni folded her arms over her damp suit jacket. “He’s at a convention in Washington but I could get him on the phone if you really need to talk to him. How do you know Bruce?
“Aw…how patronizing.” Came a voice behind them though it was tinged in jest. “Are you two done deciding my dowry or should I go back and poke Bruce with a stick some more?”
Steve could see it. His Carol and Tony would have gotten on like a house on fire if given the time. “I gather with her powers Carol changed a lot for you guys. With Jarvis still being around Ultron must have not happened...”
And although he’d never said so out loud; Tony dying was the catalyst for him going back to 1945. No more Iron Man had felt like the end of his era. Time to do what
“You know if you wanted to see the Dodgers play I could just fly us to Los Angeles,” Toni said as he cracked another ball out of sight. “Because I am rich and own many jets.”
knew Tony Prime using the stones and dying was the only way to save the world, and he said nothing so that it would come to pass. Don’t be a buzz kill, Doc.”
Pain erupted in Steve’s temple, and he gripped the edge of the bed so hard the metal railing dented. “I—I don’t… What the hell is going on?! Tony Stark is a man and he died. I—Bruce! Where is Bruce, I wanna talk to Bruce Banner.”
“Hey Cap.” She put her tablet on standby and gestured to the food on the counter. “I didn’t know what you wanted so I got the full breakfast buffet thing. The pancakes are to die for. Eat up.”
Later at home alone she’d drowned her sorrows and then updated everyone’s gear and weapons to the point that even Natasha was impressed. Over time it got easier and now she really was fine with their relationship. Some people just weren’t cut out for the picket fence life.
“Before Thanos I’m not sure I would have believed you about alternate realities.” Rhodey shook his head. “I mean with Toni I always knew anything was possible but… Then he showed up and I met a talking raccoon from outer space, and we learned more about the Infinity Stones. Sometimes I really miss the days when all we had to worry about was Justin Hammer or whatever.”
“Don’t I? Steve Rogers died here but everything before the ice still happened. Howard still helped with the serum and so much more…”
“Peggy!” Steve shot up in bed as if he’d been electrocuted, legs tangled in the soft cotton sheets.  He rolled onto his side and nearly brained himself on the bedside table, arm flailing out to knock over a lamp. It hit the carpet with a soft thump.
She smirked. “Ooh superheroes; they’re just like us. Anyway I’m calling because I have a question about time.”
Pepper kissed her cheek and flowed into the hallway the minute the door opened. “Good. Take care and I’ll be in touch. Oh expect a visit from Rhodey tomorrow.”
Her expression softened. “Maybe 1945 isn’t your place, Steve. I know you don’t want to hear that but it could be true. Some things happen for a reason. Look at all the shit that went down for me to become Iron Woman. Obie and Gulmira and Yinsen in that cave. Take out even one and things could have ended up differently. Without Yinsen I would have died. Without Obie being a back stabbing bald fuck head and selling me out, I never would have been kidnapped or possibly even gotten the idea to be Iron Woman.” Coming closer, she put her hand on his shoulder. “It’s possible 1945 didn’t need Cap anymore.”
“Okay.” Toni hooked her arm through Pepper’s, waiting until they were in the elevator again to ask, “So what did you think?”
Bucky shook his head. “Nothing to explain. I don’t know you who are pal but putting on the face of a dead hero—
Toni exhaled deeply, weighing the pros and cons of even attempting to sort out what was going on inside of her head. “I just…have you ever had a moment where you’re like outside of yourself looking in? And even though it’s not sad what you see just sort of makes you sad?”
Steve couldn’t help but laugh. He’d been doing that quite a bit in the last twenty-four hours and it felt good. “Why do you deserve that, Toni?”
“C’mon you know that’s a third date type deal. Besides just figured he might want to talk some more. He looks like he has a lot he wants to get off that…chiseled chest of his.”
In the beginning Steve hadn’t known how to take Natasha’s bluntness; it was only rivaled by her ability to lie to your face without so much as blinking. But—and he realized how ironic it sounded—he wasn’t one for secrets and when she deigned to tell the truth she did so without beating around the bush.
“Yeah the universes can be dicks,” Toni murmured. “I’ll explain more later but you just got here! And I know there is a part of you dying to talk to Steve because of how much you love America, and he’s like the
He nodded and took a seat on a stool at the counter. “I just don’t want you to think I’m taking advantage of your hospitality.”
Judith cackled. “He’s such a sweet young man. You tell him I’m bringing back those muffins he likes.”
like that while dressed like some type of Christian missionary? Toni wasn’t the religious type but she’d listen to him tell her about the good word all day long just to be able to stare at him some more.
Toni visibly squirmed but she appeared pleased so he decided it was a win. “Yeah yeah so and anyway rules of the universe state probable changes depending on mitigating factors. There is most likely another universe where Pepper and I are both guys and we probably adopted adorable babies or something. Luck of the cosmic draw. As long as the multiple Peppers are having a blast all is right in candy land. Well unless one hooks up with Rhodey then I might have a few choice words and places to aim my repulsors. Gotta have a line somewhere, Steve.”
superheroes having to register with their governments. I didn’t like anyone having that aspect of power. Tony thought that type of oversight was needed. In the end I suppose it didn’t matter since they turned out to be such a small part of our beginning conflict.”
Steve closed his eyes and absently leaned into her touch. Somehow it felt familiar even though it wasn’t. “And I said I’d be moving in permanently. I remember.” He paused to gather his thoughts. “I know you can do remarkable things Toni but I don’t expect you to do the impossible. Time travel notwithstanding. You have the Time Wraith to contend with this time around. If you couldn’t get me back to Peggy, I know it wouldn’t be for a lack of trying. I’d be sad of course but it’s not like I couldn’t easily make this place my home. Hell in a way I already have.”
“No worries dear, I brought Adam with me. And I told you to call me Judith.” Mrs. Linley gestured to her son as he trailed out behind her. “Besides if I can’t carry a single tray what good am I?”
Launching herself back into the air, she returned to the fight, working to keep most of the damage to a centralize area. The soldiers seemed to have no interest deviating beyond whatever they’d been told to do, and so far
He chuckled again. “I think you two would have liked each other after getting over the shock. There would have been no problems left with two Starks running around.”
She nodded. “Jarvis can order you one but perhaps going in for a fitting wouldn’t be the worst idea.” Her cell phone chimed and she stepped off to the side to answer it.
Exhaling deeply, he wrapped his strong arms around his waist and squeezed. “I was going to make sure things turned out differently in that new timeline. Not just for me and Peggy but for—for Tony too. It wouldn’t have changed anything in my timeline but it was something I needed to do.”
“Okay.” Amused, he got up for orange juice and refilled her mug with coffee. “Did you get any sleep last night?”
“Why don’t we start from the beginning then?” She offered with a tiny smile. “Like…why were you in that alley? Why do you think I should be a guy?”
Steve smiled and folded his arms across his black shirt. “It changed me too. For five years after the snap everyone just sort of coasted, went through the motions of what was expected. After finally getting everyone back there was a different kind of chaos. We had to mourn those lost in the second battle with Thanos while trying to help those five years behind suddenly acclimate to their new worldview. It was…a lot.”
“How about we just set a time for a nice dinner with everyone who happens to be around?” Rhodey suggested wryly. “I’m here for a while, and Bruce is supposed to get in later today. We could do it tonight.”
Seeing this version of Tony all vibrant and snarky severely reminded him how much he missed his Tony. How no matter what he’d never see him again.
grinned. “Yeah I know I must look like a drowned rat.” She peeped at her reflection in the tiny mirror over the sink. “Or not. This is what expensive makeup gets you. Feel like a drowned rat though. But yes I am she. With the money and the brain and the suit…and the lawyers so don’t sue.”
Clearing his throat, he snickered. “Yeah? Sometimes it’s like I can never get warm but I think that’s all in my head.”
Adult Toni didn’t mind being alone anymore because it didn’t make her feel like no one cared nor had no time for her. No matter how busy her friends were if she needed them they were there; even Pepper who had her hands full being a boss in the literal and hyped sense of the word. Sometimes just
Steve gazed at her like he was committing her face or memory or something equally as sappy. It was a bit unnerving…wondering what he was thinking about her. Or about
“I get that,” Steve said slowly. “The bigger your worldview the bigger the threats that can harm it. The idea that there is something, anything bigger than Thanos chills me to my core. I don’t
Toni made a face. “Sure but only if you wanna knock Rhodey and I out of the sky too. An electromagnetic pulse would knock power out for at least three or four blocks.”
But Toni’s hand was smaller and if he listened very closely he could hear the whirring of servos or what have you powering it up. Still it was
“Throwing you?” Bucky chuckled lowly. “I’m still not sure I believe anything Stark just said. But she’s not an idiot and she wouldn’t have you here if you were dangerous or Hydra or whatever.”
“I…suppose not.” He adjusted the bed to an incline so that he wasn’t just flat on his back. “You haven’t told me your name yet though. I’m Steve.”
The machine rattled out its last ball and Steve caught it with his bare hand without even turning around.
