more,
The three hours that he spends listening to music in the privacy of his suite is the most peaceful Steve has felt since he woke up. Not even yoga with Bruce or a fifteen-mile run could help silence the constant humming in his head.
that he completely misses to see the slight shaking in Tony’s hands as he pours the steaming liquid into his mug. Clint, clearly dumbfounded at the sight of his very human friend clutching an alien god’s weapon in his other hand, continues to openly gawk at the sight, mouth hanging open and all.
“You’re so cute, babe,” Steve murmurs with a grin, overwhelmed with affection just then.
Tony’s eyes well up, and this time he doesn’t bother fighting them back as he allows the tears to fall. His heart twinges at the sweet words uttered affectionately to him, and he feels an uncanny sense of relief settle deep in his bones.
“Yeah, I know,” Tony answers quietly. This time, he doesn’t hesitate to draw Pepper closer and wrap his arms around her slim frame. As Pepper hugs him back just as tightly, Tony mumbles, “I’m sorry for worrying you.”
“Sir is currently asleep. Do you want me to alert you if he wakes up, Captain?”
that’s even what’s supporting him upright.
“Fuck you, guys,” Clint declares. The transition between that deadpan declaration and then belting out the lyrics to one of Journey’s greatest hits has a snowball effect on everyone as they start another round of laughter.
God, that sentence shouldn’t even make sense.
, mind you — and he was surrounded in the same blue light before he dropped to the ground like a sack of potatoes. So excuse me if I
Tony blinks back.
When Tony’s voice falters, Steve moves without a second thought and closes the remaining distance between them. He pulls Tony into a hug, arms wrapping around his trembling frame in a tight embrace, and he feels Tony melt in his arms as he buries his face into the crook where Steve’s shoulder and neck meet.
So when Thor sees Tony at the gym a week later, the genius fighting against a robot he designed to be his opponent in the boxing ring, the Asgardian instantly jumps at the opportunity presented to him.
It’s only when the portal finally,
Are you okay? Did you have a nightmare?
“I hope this ‘very valid reason’ is worth the trouble of you
Tony makes a cutting motion towards the nearest camera and he lets out a sigh of relief when JARVIS disconnects the call. Too exhausted to stand up and make the short walk to his bedroom, Tony makes himself comfortable, head resting on a cushion at the arm of the couch. He adjusts his position a few times, ensuring the woolen blanket is wrapped snugly around his body before he closes his eyes and lets out a deep sigh.
Following the attack of an unknown species of alien from another dimension that even Thor doesn’t know the existence of (“I believe they traveled to Earth by accident,” the Asgardian prince said after the battle was won. “They most likely did not mean any harm, however the hostile reception they received said otherwise.”). If Steve were to describe what they looked like, he would say that they looked a cross between the

He can perfectly imagine the shit-eating grin on his dear captain’s face when Steve says, “Now where’s the fun in that, Shellhead?”
Tony blinks. “I, er… how can you tell?”
At Steve’s raised eyebrow, Tony can’t help the blush that spreads over his cheeks. “Uh. Yeah? I mean,
“Okay, I have a very valid reason, and given the dire circumstances, I figured it’s better to ask for forgiveness than to ask permission,” Tony starts to say in a placating tone.
“Ah, sorry, I got carried away,” he explains sheepishly, grinning when Tony rolls his eyes and bumps his shoulder. “Anyway, I don’t recognize it, but I keep hearing ‘ho’ and ‘hey’ repeatedly.”
With a groan, he grabs the device from the bedside table to see what it is, only to blink in surprise at the text message.
“You know you can count on me, right?”
up close and personal with Captain America.
Terribly sorry again for the delay, but I hope you enjoy reading this (albeit short) chapter!
help and you’re gonna say ‘you don’t think so’?”
. That long. Pretty fucking long.
Silence greets the group after that. Until Clint breaks it.
“Everything I do feels like it’s never enough,” he confesses quietly, eyes trained on his rough, scarred hands. Hands that have created and destroyed. “I have… a company. I create stuff to help people. Make their lives comfortable, easy. Sometimes safe. But before that, I made a lot of mistakes. I mean,
enough to allow himself to relax and just
Sure, Nat’s come a long way to letting her walls down around them, but they are all aware that there are still so many layers to the redheaded assassin that even Steve knows it’ll take a long time for them to completely
to do, is a huge difference from all the other public figures who do, or attempt to do, the same thing.”
“I didn’t think it mattered,” Tony says self-deprecatingly. He would never admit out loud that that night opened doors for him. Doors that he didn’t know existed until that fateful night.
There’s a heavy pause before he hears Bruce make a frustrated noise. Steve doesn’t like the sound of that.
“Huh, okay,” Tony replies. Steve inwardly cheers at the news, knowing that he’ll get to spend more time with the genius. “In that case, shuffle play on the current playlist, J.”
“Sleep well, Captain.”
“It’s like I said. Physically, I’m fine,” Tony repeats. Then he raises a hand to his chest, right where his arc reactor is, and he adds in a softer tone, “But I’m not okay here. Something’s missing. Something… important.”
They’re all in the communal floor one night after spending most of the afternoon thwarting off another alien invasion. JARVIS had ordered them dinner while they showered off the filth and grime from the afternoon’s battle, so when Steve arrives last he’s greeted with the sight of his team sitting around the coffee table in the living room. Boxes and cartons of takeout is scattered around them, an entire box of pizza already empty by Thor’s side.
And just like that, they all disperse to the kitchen. Pepper says goodbye to them, claiming that she has paperwork to do, and kisses and hugs Tony before she walks to the elevator.
So if that means she has to swallow her inquisitiveness in seeing Tony wield Mjölnir with her own eyes (JARVIS has refrained them from seeing the footage of Tony lifting the hammer, for some reason, though the redhead can guess who gave the AI that particular order), then so be it.
Steve’s brows crease in mild confusion. “What’s perfect?”
dancing a jig in their respective places at their worktables. Peter’s working on his web shooters while Tony’s doing some tweaks to his suit.
Steve opens his mouth and closes it. He does that a few more times before he huffs out in laughter with a shake of his head. Tony continues to stare at him, and he can discern that Steve’s contemplating on something before the blond man blinks. Determination is evident on his face when Steve meets Tony’s eyes once more, and the engineer forces himself to stay rooted in his spot when the man closes the distance between them.
Tony looks pensive for a few seconds longer. “Well, to put it simply, it’s like I’ve lost interest in activities I normally enjoy doing,” he eventually answers, turning to meet their curious, if not concerned, gazes. “It doesn’t mean that I don’t want to do them. Just that… I don’t think I possess the inclination to do what I normally enjoy doing. I want to, but at the same time I can’t be bothered. I’m not sure why, but I’m guessing that it has to do with whatever I was hit with.”
Next, Tony lifts and waves his arms to see if he can move the rest of his body, and then his feet and legs, and he’s flooded with relief when his limbs and joints move without struggle, albeit a little sluggishly.
“Always, Shellhead.”
“I was at the gym,” Thor answers with a shake of his head.
Steve, who’s been quietly drawing on his sketchpad for the past hour and a half, suddenly looks up at the scene unfolding before him.
Well, here goes nothing.
Tony feels himself blush, and he attempts to shift his position, but Steve’s arms tighten around him, preventing Tony from escaping (as if he wanted to). Knowing he’s only going to fight a losing battle, he allows himself to relax in Steve’s arms once more. With a sigh of contentment, Tony closes his eyes and burrows his face further into Steve’s neck, shamelessly inhaling the man’s scent.
“You’re taking his pulse?” Steve asks after a while, unable to keep quiet any longer.
Steve looks up in time to see Tony, back turned to him, gently settling the hammer down on the workbench.
“About damn time,” Tony mutters in relief.
So sorry this is late. Work's been stressful, but I hope the long chapter makes up for it.
“Yeah, it’s okay,” Steve answers with a lopsided smile, which Tony returns with a small grin. “Quite tame for our standards, but it’s still okay.”
not fair.
From the corner of his eye, Steve notices the owner — a Ms. Norma Fletcher, a kind woman who’s seventy-three years young — looking at them with a fond smile. Steve catches Norma’s eye, who winks at him and gives Steve a
Fuck. She fights back the panic that’s rising when she counts at least twenty of the robots in favor of re-charging her Widow bites and re-loading her gun.
Steve thinks what he said wasn’t funny at all, but considering that they’ve been drinking for at least five hours now, and taking into account the fact that a drunk Tony is a happy Tony, it stands to reason that anything anyone could say at this point would be greeted with laughter by the genius.
He can feel Tony’s heavy gaze on him, but Bruce does his best to act nonchalant as he moves back to his table to clear up his workspace. He pretends he doesn’t hear Tony clear his throat again, pretends he doesn’t glimpse from the corner of his eye the way Tony inconspicuously swipes at his eyes. He pretends but deep down Bruce takes this moment as a learning curve.
Really, she should get a reward for keeping her mouth shut this long.
Admittedly, he’s no better in the situation since Steve’s also resorted to calling Tony names. ‘Doll’ and ‘darling’ are what he uses frequently, but one time he called Tony ‘babe’, and Tony looked at Steve with this really sweet, really soft expression it made Wanda throw marshmallows at them and Sam to walk out of the communal kitchen.
Too speechless to say anything else, all Steve can utter with sincerity is, “Thank you. Both of you.”
“Sir, this is your only functioning suit. Mark 34 is still in need of repair after the last battle.”
“JARVIS?” Tony inquires, an edge to his tone that nobody misses.
There’s several moments of tense silence following his tirade, only broken by Clint clearing his throat.
He just hopes he comes up with one sooner rather than later because he's starting to get desperate.
, Tony thinks almost desperately.
to leave, but I couldn’t let the others know I was sneaking away! And if I hadn’t done what I did, you would’ve told Steve and…” Tony’s voice trails off. When he’s met with silence again, Tony sighs out loud. “I’m sorry. I know you’re not happy with me, but. I
“Thought you might like the company,” Tony says with a shrug, although there’s a faint flush to his cheeks that Steve finds really… adorable.
Tony isn’t sure how he developed that habit, but if he dares to reminisce further, he’d pin it down to his mom. His childhood, although not completely a happy one, was still filled with love and laughter, mostly thanks to his mom and Jarvis the butler. He can vaguely recall his mom humming to Tony when he was sick, or when he would have nightmares. Actually, Maria Stark was a musically gifted woman, and she was the person who taught Tony how to play the piano and violin. She was also the one who taught him how to sing — well, it was more of Tony reading notes and copying his mom until he eventually learned it all.
Steve listens to the music some more before he answers, “Someone who’s going through a break-up?”
Pepper’s bright blue eyes widen in shock at those words before they narrow, clearly not satisfied and a little suspicious at Tony’s half-hearted response. He sees her open her mouth to retaliate, but something makes her pause, instead opting to scrutinize Tony from head to toe. Tony, on the other hand, does his best not to fidget on the spot, but judging by the way he’s tapping his fingers against his thighs, and the way Pepper tracks his movements with a keen gaze, he knows he’s failed spectacularly.
In that moment, Steve had the sudden urge to take Tony in his arms again, while simultaneously wanting to hunt down every single person who’s wronged the engineer in the past. Then, thinking that Steve’s part of
Her smile turns melancholic, blue eyes shining with emotions that Tony is all too familiar with. Having loved and lost, it’s a grief that has eased over time, but remains a constant companion. Tony knows that look. He’s seen it in the mirror every day since he was sixteen.
“Why,” Bruce starts, and he has to clear his throat twice before he continues. “Why are you telling us this, Pepper?”
Swallowing past the tightness in his throat when his gaze lands on the portal several hundred feet above them, Tony’s mind flashes back to the dark void of space and the sight of hundreds of those ugly creatures before the nuke decimated them. He grits his teeth and banishes those memories away before he pushes through the crowd. Tony discards his grey suit jacket then loosens and tosses the burgundy tie over his shoulder before he activates his wrist gauntlets. The Leviathan is gliding several hundred feet above while hordes of Chitauri rappel to the sides of the buildings, shattered windows and crumbling rubble falling to the ground where people continue to run for their lives.
, rather Tony absolutely adored him to bits. It broke Tony’s heart when Jarvis died a few years after he was named CEO of Stark Industries, and there were days when he wished he exerted more effort in being there for the man who loved him and raised him when he needed him the most.
“Sounds like a great guy, your George,” Tony rasps out after a while.
Raising one eyebrow, Tony answers him with a touch of sarcasm in his voice. “Yeah? Care to enlighten me?”
“Life. Death. Purpose. Anything under the sun, really.”
. Yeah,
They still disagree on a lot of things, mostly about work and how the team should operate, but less now on the inconsequential things, like who’s turn it is to wash the dishes. Hell, there were a few instances than Steve can recollect where he and Tony shared an almost amicable conversation over a meal or whenever they end up working out together at the state-of-the-art gym. Plus, there were also the team building activities that they would all participate in every week to help boost the team’s morale and strengthen their bond. Movie Nights are a weekly thing now, and they’ve recently introduced Game Nights into their routine as well.
Tony winks at him, not hesitating to say in a conspiratorial tone, “Oh, that’s not the only thing I've got planned for tonight.”
Pepper smiles sharply. “Good.”
Tony thrusts Mjölnir up, calling forth the lightning and directing it at the Chitauri nearest to him. A piercing cry echoes around the genius as the lightning hits its intended targets. Next, he pivots on the spot and redirects the current of electricity at the creatures behind him, racing forward to meet a stray Chitauri head on and countering its — his? Her? Do they even use pronouns? — attack by swinging Mjölnir and hitting the creature in the center of its chest. The Chitauri flies back several feet, taking three others with it before Tony leaps and brings Mjölnir down on the ground. A strong surge of electricity spreads across the ruined concrete and towards the oncoming horde, tendrils of lightning coiling around them and burning them from the inside out.
. And what unsettles me is that part of the results I got from JARVIS revealed that Tony’s… I mean, I admit, at first I thought it was just a glitch — that it didn’t make sense
“Not all good-byes have to be permanent, either,” Stevie chimes in, wanting to contribute to the conversation.
At this, Tony stiffens, and Steve’s instantly on high alert when he notices the engineer white-knuckling the tablet in his hands.
The feeling of despair wells up inside of Tony as Pepper continues to look at him, her beautiful face torn between an expression of deep concern and betrayal. Concern for his well-being and betrayal for, well, for hiding
Tony ignores Clint’s indignant squawk as he shifts his feet so his stance is perfectly balanced. With a loud exhale, Tony thrusts Mjölnir up and calls on the strongest surge of lightning he can muster before directing the current towards the enormous Leviathan. The electrical charge hits it directly on the face, but it doesn’t go down despite Thor and Jolly Green impaling jagged pieces of its metal armor in its body. Gritting his teeth, Tony is briefly distracted when he tastes blood in his mouth, but immediately casts that thought aside in favor of commanding more lightning to hit the serpentine body.
“You’re welcome, Sir. Good luck.”
I know this chapter doesn't make up for the long hiatus, but I hope it was worth the wait. Unbeta'd, and all mistakes made are mine and mine alone. Thank you so much for your support and enthusiasm. It means a lot to me.
Tony more. God, what would his mother say or do now if she sees Steve not minding his manners to Tony? Especially when the man has been nothing but a gracious and incredibly generous host to them after all this time.
This time, Tony looks pensive as he considers his next words. “I think it does. Among other things, I mean.”
? With
“You get a free pass this one time,” Natasha claims with an arched brow, smirk in place.
Well, shit.
Tony forces himself to roll his eyes before he musters a cheeky grin. “Hells yeah, I’m sure! Sorry for, uh, worrying you? Nothing wrong, I swear. Just been a tiring week, is all.”
And he’ll do that once he finds a suitable weapon to fight with.
Tony huffs out a laugh, disbelief writ on his face.
Tony yawns as he grunts a greeting back.
“I’m sorry, babe,” Steve expresses apologetically. Tony blinks, both surprised at the apology and the use of a pet name. “I didn’t mean to — I never thought you were —”
“Rhodey?”
“He was back to wearing that Black Sabbath shirt,” he says.
When he’s alone in the elevator, Steve leans heavily against the wall as he exhales loudly. Smiling goofily at the ceiling, he finds that he doesn’t mind this mating dance he and Tony are doing if it means they get to trade innocent kisses like this.
He twists the cap of the milk jug until it’s properly sealed before handing it out to Tony who’s closest to the fridge. Clint would do it himself but he’s far too comfortable in his position to move.
His teammates, especially Steve who hasn’t left his bedside in the Tower’s med-bay following the intense battle, had excitedly showed him video reactions and tweets of Tony wielding Mjölnir. Apparently expending that much effort and energy using Mjölnir had completely drained the genius, who only woke up after losing consciousness for almost fourteen hours.
“Anyway,” Steve starts after clearing his throat a second time. “I’ll stay here and wait ‘till you’re done with whatever you’re doing. The others have ordered dinner, and since JARVIS informed me —
“Beats me, but I really hope Rock of Ages doesn’t make an appearance.”
It’s the evening of the aftermath of another successful battle that Steve finds himself and the rest of the Avengers lounging in the living room.
if you want to chat!
It’s one thing to start with an open mind and actively get to know someone, regardless of their backgrounds or the red on their ledger, and another thing to have a preconceived notion about someone and expect them to act the way you expect them to.
This time, Jarvis’ expression turns soft as he gazes down at Tony’s tense features, and the older man doesn’t hesitate to raise a hand to rest it reassuringly on Tony’s shoulder. Surprisingly, he’s warm to the touch, and the familiar gesture nearly brings the engineer to tears.
They’re in the middle of fighting an army of robotic spiders (the irony is not lost on her) when she hears Clint’s panicked voice over the comms, the archer perched somewhere high as always.
It took twenty minutes until all the guests got to pat Steve on the back, or hug him, or kiss him on the cheek. Tony definitely doesn’t combust with jealousy when he spots one SHIELD agent manage to peck a blushing Steve on the apple of cheek.
“How’s Tony?” he asks, voice almost a whisper.
“Steve?”
“Sure? Serious? Crazy? Sleep-deprived?” Tony ticks them off his fingers. When Pepper doesn’t say anything, only continues to look at him with a half-concerned half-proud look, the engineer sighs deeply before he drains his glass. “Yes to all, in case you’re wondering. But honestly, Pep? I don’t know what the fuck I was thinking when I decided, to, well. You know.”
me, like the way you’ve all been treating me this whole time. My point is that all I ask of you is to exert a little patience with me. Would you grant me this courtesy, at least? I’m not a god or a super soldier. I’m getting old and I have health issues. And now I’ve revealed too much and I just made this whole thing way too awkward. So I’m leaving. Bye.”
It’s Bruce who voices their confusion.
She smiles sadly at them, and something twists deep in Steve upon seeing that.
“Of course! There are only two Leviathan left to destroy. The Hulk and I can deal with it together. Summon her away, Tony!”
Whatever happens next, Steve desperately hopes that he still gets to have this. Even if Tony decides that he doesn’t want to explore whatever has grown between them, Steve would push through the heartbreak and choose to remain friends with the genius rather than lose him. Because losing Tony would mean losing a part of Steve — the part that has grown to accept and love the future. He considers Tony his anchor because it was the eccentric genius who helped him the most to adjust to the twenty-first century.
Fair enough. How about dinner at our usual diner when I get back?
Silence reigns after that as Tony and the rest of his team becomes occupied with taking down the army of Chitauri. He helps Hulk in taking down the second Leviathan, however more of those alien bastards rappel from the warship.
“Shush now. Enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime performance, Cap.”
God, he can’t even curse in his current state! How is that even possible?
Steve sighs and then shakes his head. “We can cancel the party —”
“How can you tell?”
goes unsaid, but Pepper’s smart enough to read between the lines.
“You don’t get to make that kind of decision for them. They chose to be in your life for a reason, didn’t they?” At Tony’s reluctant nod, the elderly woman nods and continues. “Then you gotta trust
Natasha shoots the super soldier a pointed look, and Steve instantly read that as

Steve blinks and his focus returns to the present.
“Assemble on 34th,” Steve adds. “Tony, what’s your status?”
“Tony, you’re
It takes less than a day for him to buy his own iPod.
“What? Tony, no, wait —”
“Ineffective, sir, unless Mr. Odinson can hold his position for an indeterminate length of time in order to destroy the mothership.”
— Herman Hesse;
“Mr. Odinson left it there by accident after I alerted him of Mr. Barton attempting to break into the safe that contains his pop tarts,” JARVIS replies after a short pause.
Tony has a wide array of smiles that Steve’s taken note of over the years. And the smile that Tony’s sporting right now is one that he’s only ever used for Steve, and Steve alone.
Clint murmurs, “This should be fun.”
He doesn’t have to see the grin on Thor’s face when the Asgardian proclaims, “Not at all, my friend!”
“Tony?”
“Hm, it's still open to his company e-mail,” Clint supplies before he returns the StarkPad back on the couch. “Tony wouldn’t be that careless.” Then, the archer glances at the coffee table and a frown forms on his face. “Coffee’s gone cold. He didn’t drink from it.”
“You really need to revise your definition of what constitutes as a party,” Natasha sighs.
Still chuckling, Tony quips back, “Yeah, but I know you love it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Before the super soldier can answer, Bruce swiftly cuts in. “I think that that
“I was in my room,” Clint supplies next.
“Just— next time you want to go out… maybe let us know first?” Steve adds with a beseeching look at him.
, really — to see the real Tony Stark underneath all the layers of defenses he’s put up. I can only hope that it’s not too late.”
“You’re too kind, Steve Rogers,” Tony observes, and it’s Steve’s turn to blush.
So Steve swallows past the dryness in his throat and allows himself this moment of weakness. He runs his thumb across Tony’s cheekbone and jawline before drawing his hand away. He tries not to feel
For the next several minutes, Steve remains quiet but vigilant as Bruce carries on with checking over Tony. He scrutinizes the arc reactor while asking JARVIS questions that Steve knows is full of science jargon. Bruce also uses a pen light to examine Tony’s eyes and the insides of his mouth, much to Steve’s bafflement.
about him.
Doubtful that the day he uses Mjölnir in a fight
But Tony’s just so drained, and Pepper’s away on business for another two weeks while Rhodey’s in Afghanistan. So that leaves him with his teammates, and honestly, Tony’s desperate enough that he’d willingly left the sanctuary of his penthouse suite to seek their company. Doing so is a testament to how helpless he’s become, and the thought of Steve — of any of them, really — turning Tony away after this breaks something in him.
Well, if he’s being honest, it’s mostly thanks to Tony and his AI JARVIS, really. He considers it a miracle that he hasn’t mentally collapsed from information overload. Sure, he’s been defrosted for nearly two years now, and sure, he’s got the serum running through his veins that’s helped enhanced
He knows that look. He’s seen that look on Tony’s face more than he would like, and personally he
, what Thor just suggested, and it’s clearly not my area of expertise. But… it could be.”
Tony glares half-heartedly at him before his expression shifts into a contemplative look. “Hmm, yeah, probably not. But right now, I’m fucking swearing off of tequila. I’m sticking to my scotch, thanks.”
And again.

“Whatever you say, Tony.”
Then Tony beams at him, and it’s such a dazzling smile that it makes Steve’s heart soar and expand at the same time. God, how much he loves this beautiful, stubborn, brilliant man.
“Try it?” Natasha prods gently.
would’ve done if I woke up in your time. No offense, but just the thought of the lack of plumbing is enough to give me the hives. I’m also pretty damn sure I would throw a tantrum in the first half hour at the lack of Internet. Anyway, my point is that it’s okay if that’s how you perceive it
Steve is unable to hide his shudder this time.
, and decides to nip this whole thing in the bud.
“Sorry not sorry.” There’s a pause, and then, “Also, have I mentioned that I got the best seat in the house? ‘Cos lemme tell you, Cap, your boyfriend is lookin’ mighty
from me.”
The engineer glances at Steve again, an inscrutable expression on his face when he says, “Call it intuition? Trust me, I know what depression feels like. This isn’t it. There’s a difference between
Tony tries to ignore the butterflies fluttering in his stomach as he says as nonchalantly as he can, “I still haven’t given you your gift yet, Cap.”

“I wasn’t aware we had a specific topic of discussion to begin with, sir. But do carry on.”
good of an actor.
The engineer’s tone is even, but laced with an emotion that Steve can’t discern, when he says, “I’m fine, physically.”
(Tony wins, but only because Steve’s throat is tight with emotion seeing as he was too busy imprinting this very moment to memory.)
“Aye, Captain!” Thor booms excitedly.
He stands up to properly greet Tony, and when the genius steps out of the elevator, he’s lost for words when he’s greeted to an unusual sight.
“No! N-no, it’s fine,” Tony rasps out with a shudder as he forces his eyes open. His skin crawls uncomfortably, and he feels too big and small at the same time, leaving him disoriented. Letting out a deep breath, he shakily adds, “I’ll — I’m fine, J. I’m gonna go there. In a bit. Just, uh, just need to freshen up.”
“Hulk and I have yet to defeat the last Leviathan,” Thor pronounces. His statement is supported by Hulk roaring and soaring towards the last ship standing.
That was the only time they dared to bring up that topic, and honestly Bruce is part confused and part curious to find out why that’s the case. Because from one genius to another, shouldn’t Tony be intrigued to learn more about Mjölnir? Now that he’s armed with the knowledge of being able to lift it, Bruce half expected that Tony would be all over the moon about it, eager to scan the object and study it from all angles.
“I’m fine, Cap,” Natasha says through gritted teeth. Then after a beat, she darkly adds, “But Thor won’t be.” She attempts to move her leg but ends up gritting her teeth to prevent a scream when the throbbing pain intensifies.
“Ms. Potts and Agent Romanoff appear more serious compared to the others.”
For a moment, it hurt to breathe, and Steve had to inhale deeply and swallow past the lump lodged in his throat before he’s able to speak.
This time, when Pepper smiles, it’s small but genuine. “Don’t thank me for that, Bruce. Tony trusts all of you. Did you really think he’d still here, comfortable and open around you guys if he didn’t?”
Tony has his back turned already, but he smirks when he hears Steve laugh out loud at his parting words.
“It’s the middle of the night, Tony. I doubt that it’s still open —”
The next thing he knows, the song is drawing to a close, and Tony’s nimble fingers play effortlessly over the keys as he sings the last words.
“You’ve discovered something,” she states simply. When Pepper looks at her, and then nods after a beat, the redhead adds, “The way this Tony is behaving is familiar to you, then.”
“You do know that just made you sound childish, right?”
“But my room’s so far,” Tony whines in protest.
Fuck. Whatever.
positive response. It’s like waking up in the twilight zone.
, birdbrain.”
“I was the one who was an asshole to you earlier,” Clint had said with a somber expression. “I’m sorry, Tony. That was inconsiderate of me to say all those to you, and I’ll understand if you don’t forgive me anytime soon.”
“Did you just—” Steve starts, but Thor’s fervent response drowns out the rest.
Steve chuckles. “Yeah, right.”
“Yes, Dr. Banner,” Thor agrees solemnly. “I would rather be aware of Anthony’s status and be prepared to come to his aid than to remain ignorant of our friend’s plight.”
“What the fuck?” Tony declares, dazed. He physically shakes his head, unable to grasp the reality that he’s just wielded fucking Mjölnir in the kitchen at four in the morning. “J, why the fuck is Thor’s hammer in the kitchen counter?”
, and to
“Steve?”
“Tony,” Bruce interjects in a gentle voice, and the engineer averts his eyes from the others’ alarmed looks to the physicist’s forced calm demeanor. “Can you describe to me what’s missing? Clint is right, your arc reactor is there.”
, because you
“Jesus, you’re gonna send me to an early grave, Rogers,” Tony mutters under his breath before firing his thrusters to catch his adrenaline junkie of a boyfriend.
Steve reaches out and threads his fingers with Tony’s right hand, and Tony looks at him through his lashes with a sheepish smile, gently squeezing the super soldier’s hand in thanks.
This time, Steve’s unable to hold back his laughter. Tony face lights up, eyes crinkling in the corners.
ordinary day after all.
“Is doubting himself?” Steve finishes with a frown.
Nearly two months have passed since the first incident it happened, and Natasha is nowhere near to witnessing Tony lift the alien weapon. Under other circumstances, she’d try to convince Thor to goad Tony to lifting the war-hammer, but since that first attempt over one of their team dinners, and the stern talking to they got from Steve after Tony escaped to his workshop, Natasha thought that sometimes respecting people’s boundaries is better than forcing the issue on them.
“I used to, especially the first six months after waking up from the ice,” he replies easily. “These days? Not so much. But every now and then I’d find it hard to fall asleep. So it’s either I hit the gym and let off some steam by destroying a few punching bags, or I come down here and make myself a drink.”
Steve and the others hum in agreement. There’s a furrow between Natasha’s brows and Clint is twirling an arrow with a contemplative look. Thor opens a new packet of pop tart.

Tony’s brows furrow in confusion. “What?”
“Oh, god,” Clint adds.

that stirs in his gut.
. It’s just there, and I know I’m missing something, but I don’t know what it is, and it’s killing me. This shouldn’t even hurt, but it does. It does, and I don’t know how to make it stop. I can’t make it stop. Even when I’m asleep, I still feel it. I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay again, and it terrifies me that I’ll always feel this way. This
When it’s just Steve and Tony left, the super soldier licks his lips as he looks down at Tony.
Steve falls asleep after taking another look of the last photo Tony sent, which is already saved in a secured folder comprised of photos of him and Tony, but mostly of Tony.
It’s been over a year since the Chitauri invasion, and Steve finds himself adjusting well into the 21st century. Of course, it’s all thanks to his teammates — the Avengers.
There’s a crease between his brows when he says, “Um, Tony. I think you’re describing a few symptoms of depression.”
With one hand wrapped around Steve’s, he stares in joy when Tony takes hold of Mjölnir in his other hand. Steve knows he’ll never tire of that sight, either.
That is, of a
Despite the scalding shower he just took, Tony’s disheartened to find that the cold is starting to creep in his chest once more. He comes out of his en suite, goose bumps starting to break out throughout his nearly naked body as he stumbles to his dresser and chooses the comfiest clothes he first gets his hands on. Now dressed in his thickest pair of sweatpants and burrowed in three layers of sweaters and two layers of socks, Tony feels marginally better, but the coldness remains persistent. So he does the next best thing, which is to get in his king-sized bed and under the covers.
There are four resounding snorts over the comms after that declaration.
“Why didn’t you call me sooner?”
“Then he’s back to normal again, and the cycle repeats,” Natasha concludes.
Nobody makes a move or utters a sound, too stunned in that moment to react.
know you. Well, I know all the parts you’ve shown us all these years, and yeah, I may not know you as well as Rhodey and Pepper, but I like to think that what I’ve garnered from my own interactions with you all these years is as just valid. The point I was trying to make earlier is that though you may choose to shoulder your problems on your own because they
“So the only way to close the portal is to go
Tony smirks at him and flops gracelessly on the vacant spot beside him on the couch with a satisfied groan. Steve swallows inconspicuously, distracting himself from doing something drastic like
Fortunately, the Other Guy is pleased with that approach, too. At least that’s another thing they both agree on.
This time, when Tony looks up at her and their eyes meet, he doesn’t bother to hide his confusion when he registers the forlorn expression on his friend’s face.
“I’m sorry. That was uncalled for. I just —”
“Not gonna lie, Tony. You gave us quite a fright, and we’re a bit disappointed,” he replies in a low voice. “But we’re not mad. We’re more relieved that you’re okay, actually.”
Good luck, indeed.
“Focus, birdbrain.”
“Thor, buddy,” Tony says over the comms. “I need a huge favor from you.”
lift Mjölnir. I mean, it’s an alien weapon created to be wielded only by the worthy. I’d be intimidated, too, if I were in your shoes. But… you’re my friend, Tony. And though your unease about it confuses me, a part of me worries more.”
“I sure did,” Steve replies. “Thanks for making the effort, Tony.”
All Tony wants is to
Steve turns to see Tony stand beside him, a glass of scotch on one hand.
“Shut it, Clint,” Nat says, but there’s no heat to her words.
It’s still better than nothing.
Their gazes lock then. Tony’s smirk softens into a smile but his whiskey eyes are heated, and Steve knows he has a similar look on his face. Slowly, he pulls one hand from his pocket and raises it to trace a bead of sweat that’s trailing down the side of Tony’s face. He sees Tony’s eyes flutter as the genius sighs quietly. Steve’s heart is hammering against his ribcage as he wets his lips, throat dry at the sheer
Steve curses under his breath before he addresses the AI once more. “Alright. JARVIS, will you please alert Bruce of Tony’s situation? Tell him I’ll meet him in Tony’s penthouse.”
Now, Tony is perfectly aware of his flaws; he’s loud and larger than life, arrogant, doesn’t know how to be part of a team (that’s still a work-in-progress, and even he knows he’s marginally improved in that department), presumptuous, self-absorbed, and a laundry list of issues that could go on and on. Despite that, what
“Up and down the boulevard!” Natasha joins in before swinging a bottle of vodka to her lips and chugging down a third of the contents down her throat.
“Yeah. That’s the pattern, basically.”
Right?
Because if there’s one thing Steve loves, it’s fireworks. His birthday also falling on their country’s Independence Day is just the icing on the cake, which gave him more opportunities to go crazy with the pyrotechnics show.
Tony shakes his head and nods. “Yeah, all good. Barton just, y’know, being Barton.”
. Oh my god, I’m — shit — I don’t know what to say. I don’t — wow.”
. Words won’t even do justice at how amazing you are. I mean, we definitely got some talking to do but,
) fades away.
“Hang on, Steve. Stark’s suit is a lot more complicated than you think.”
“Well?” Natasha asks with a raised eyebrow. She can feel sweat dripping down her forehead, and her face must be a lovely canvas of dirt, soot, and blood. Just another day at the playground.
find a cure.”
He’s confused at first as to how he ended up in his bedroom. Shaking off the cobwebs in his head, he distantly remembers soothing hands and soft lips.

“I’m afraid I can’t say. But do know that you are perfectly safe with me, sir.”
After going on a total of twelve dates in the span of six weeks, Tony is astonished at the pace of his newfound relationship with Steve. If it were somebody else, the genius wouldn’t have hesitated to bed them after the first date. Somehow, because it’s Steve, and Tony is undoubtedly enamored with the man, he doesn’t mind taking it slow. In fact, he prefers the pace they’re taking, and Tony thinks it’s a breath of fresh air from the usual approach he takes with his partners. The difference between them and Steve is that this time, Tony knows it’s long-term. Their physical intimacy has mostly consisted of heavy make-out sessions, a little groping, and some necking.
“Er… sorry, what?” Steve stammers, feeling his cheeks flush with embarrassment.
“I—uh, I don’t. I mean, I…” His voice trails off and he huffs out a breath before he tries again. Like his companion, Tony turns to look ahead of him before he eventually utters, “There’s no burden. I’m just… puzzled.”
Clint, who’s sitting cross legged on the carpeted floor beside Natasha’s armchair, is the one who speaks next, much to Steve’s surprise when he hears the understanding in the other man’s voice.
So to have Clint tell him all those things strikes a strong chord in Steve. He’s not hurt or offended, no. He’s
“So tracing back the scans of his brain activity from after his accident to a few days ago,” Bruce concludes after showing Steve and the others the graphs that he and JARVIS made. “There’s a sporadic, but consistent, uptick of activity when he’s presumably asleep. The question is not only
“Honestly! One text, s’all I’m saying. One text to let me know of what happened, to let me know you were alright. But did you? Did you? No, you didn’t. And it’s so ironic ‘cos if it were something silly that DUM-E did, you’d have sent me video footage and a bazillion texts. But it seems that this wasn’t important enough ‘cos I had to hear it from Pepper, who heard it from
“Thank you, Sir,” is the soft reply, laden with understanding that's mixed with exasperation. “After all, I am here to protect and look after you. That is my prime objective. While I understand your concern about Captain Rogers and the others, they only operate the way they do for your best interest. It is, after all, your safety that we are most concerned about.”
“Yes, Sir, it did,” JARVIS replies. If possible, amusement is laced in his tone as he adds, “Would you like a playback of what transpired for further proof?”
Steve’s annoyed at himself for being surprised for
Currently, they’re in the common area. Clint and Thor are busy preparing a late lunch, Bruce is seated in the armchair, reading a medical journal while Natasha’s cleaning her guns in front of the coffee table. Steve’s sitting on one side of the couch while Tony’s on the other end.
“Oh, I beg to differ, dear.”
Tony shrugs. “Jarvis?”
“Thanks, buddy.” There’s more weight in Tony’s voice when he says those words.
What could go wrong, right?
Tony shrugs and gets up from the stool to approach Steve. He looks over his shoulder as Steve cuts up the cheese. Steve gulps and does his best not to lean back into Tony.
All those weeks of forced quarantine has driven the genius to execute something so reckless. A spur-of-the-moment decision made after realizing he was alone in the common area with no company. Even if they keep telling him that it’s for his own good that he needs to stay in the Tower, at least until he “returns to normal”, Tony knows he’s become somewhat of a prisoner in his own building. Which, really, doesn’t paint a pretty picture. He may not be completely himself, but even Tony admits that he’s starting to get a case of cabin fever.
Not when Steve and the rest of the team — also Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, JARVIS and the bots, and now
Tony’s blank expression clears as realization dawned on him.
Clint arches an eyebrow at Tony, who directs a glare at one of the cameras installed in the common area. The archer hears Tony mumble “traitor” under his breath as he turns his back on Clint to focus his attention on the coffee machine.
Tony shrugs. “Good thing we have good plumbing, then.”
“Sorry, sorry,” Bruce says hastily, and Steve finds himself barely keeping up with the scientist’s rambling. “I think we just made a breakthrough, Steve. Well, not yet, but soon we will. The answer’s
God, he’s so beautiful.
Wow, he’s got issues, alright. How pathetic that must make him.
Tony returns his smile with a bashful one of his own, and Steve feels his heart stutter at how
The others turn towards Steve for guidance, and the blond man blinks at them before he resolutely straightens his shoulders.
There’s an awkward silence after that. Tony’s staring at his mug with an intensity as if it holds the answers to life’s questions while Steve remains quiet as he gathers his thoughts.
Well, Tony’s thought long and hard (he-he) about it, alright, and he’s gonna stick by his decision. With a deep breath, he steadies himself before repeating the song once more. With less than two days until the party,Tony feels a tendril of panic go through him at the lack of time he has to practice. Thankfully, he can also learn by ear instead of reading notes, but regardless of that tidbit, he wants his performance to be flawless.
Clint shoves away images of his teammates getting it on (he doesn't want to lose his appetite, thanks very much), and instead he diverts his attention back to his breakfast. He finishes pouring milk in the bowl and takes a few bites before he speaks up.
Tho don’t tell Pepper I said that. Please. 🤭
“No, no, I’m fine,” Tony quickly declares, but the way he gravitates closer to Steve says otherwise. “Just… just feeling cold. Nothing to worry about, Steve.”
as soft as it looks.
That he, Tony, was worth getting to know as a person, as a friend.
. Like, there’s a barrier that prevents me from accessing that.”
“Tony?”
It’s actually pretty pathetic how crazy Tony is for Steve. The engineer would even go as far as to accept the very sad fact that the rest of his teammates, bar Steve for obvious reasons, are painfully aware of Tony’s feelings for their leader. Tony’s not certain how long they might’ve known, but he’s guessing that they’ve known it for almost as long as Tony’s been in love with Steve. So,
, Steve thinks, a heavy weight settling in the pit of his stomach.
“Because despite your opinions about Tony and Iron Man, he’s going to need all the support he can get from you. And frankly, I don’t think any of you understand just how much Tony needs you,
“J said there are no internal injuries except for a femoral shaft fracture,” Tony relays, and Natasha’s gaze must’ve turned murderous because he winces and adds in a guilt-laden voice, “I’m sorry. I should’ve been faster.”
Shit. Sorry, I forgot about the timezone diff. Ignore this if I woke you up.
Steve can feel a blush heat up his cheeks, but he doesn’t break away from Tony’s doe-eyed stare. There’s a faint stubble growing on his cheeks and chin, and a part of him can’t wait for that signature goatee to make an appearance soon.
With a heavy sigh, Bruce nods his head after several moments and then removes his glasses to rub his eyes. It’s only once he’s worn his spectacles again that he starts to speak, and Steve doesn’t miss to hear the doubt laced in his weary voice.
Up close, Steve can see the freckles that lightly dusts over Tony’s nose. His long lashes flutter as he evenly meets the super soldier’s steady gaze, whiskey-colored eyes suspiciously bright with emotion. Heart thumping like a drum against his chest, because he’s never been this close to Tony like this, Steve reminds himself to breathe and focus on the matter at hand.
Pepper sighs and then says, “Not as bad as I expected, but not as good as I thought, either.”
He feels for the handle, and when his fingers graze something solid, he distantly wonders why the coffee pot weighs considerably less than he imagined. Chalking it up to his mind playing tricks, he shrugs and proceeds to poor the hot liquid into the white Stark Industries mug in his grasp.
“Also in my room,” Natasha says.
“I would be more than happy to assist, Dr. Banner,” JARVIS’ voice comes over the speakers.
Tony just hopes her advice — or ideas, because Pepper often has good ideas — is something he can agree on.
be an important aspect to what’s wrong with me.”
And though it saddens him that after all this time, three months to the day since Clint had spread the news of Tony’s ability to lift Mjölnir, Tony still appears to be uncomfortable whenever the subject is broached and doesn’t hesitate to shy away from it.
“Don’t make me puke my lunch, lovebirds,” Clint adds.
Steve blinks rapidly. He clears his throat and wets his lips because there’s a reason why he’s here in the first place.
when Tony showed him everything, and the extra tight, extra long hug he received from the super soldier was testament enough to how happy he was.
“Okay. Could be quicker, but okay. Thanks. Nat?”
Tony nods as he covers his yawn behind his hand before replying, “I did. But then I, uh, well— you know. I woke up and I couldn’t fall asleep again.”
“I, uh, yeah. About that.”
Steve hesitates for a moment, but finally he stutters out, “Um. I don’t know if you were aware, but you were kind of singing earlier. When you were standing in front of the fridge. Uh, I don’t know the song, but your voice — it sounded really nice. I mean, you have a very nice singing voice. Just, um, saying.”
— Steve swallows inaudibly at the sight before him.
by that time! It’s just too coincidental for you to say these words to me when I’m stuck in my own head, not knowing if I’m just having a conversation with myself or my subconscious or… or — ah, fuck it, I don’t know. And I
At that statement, Steve sees Tony visibly react. The genius jerked as if electrocuted, blinking those beguiling doe eyes rapidly as he stiffly moves to put the ruined gauntlet back on the table before glaring at the nearest camera.
A confession.
The mention of their leader causes Thor to smirk in amusement, briefly recounting an incident the other day that involved a burnt meal and his two besotted friends covered head to toe in flour and eggs, the mess not able to hide their blushing faces.
“Can’t be a sexy thing,” Clint mutters to himself, only to yelp when Natasha slaps him upside the head.
Unless Pepper’s learned to hack our phones, your secret’s safe with me. 😉
“You arrived in time, Blondie,” Tony quips. “Now the party can officially begin.”
Another humming and Tony finds himself chuckling darkly. Minding the porcelain shards of the shattered mug and blaming it on his lack of sleep and proper nourishment, the engineer slowly reaches out a hand to lightly caress the faint markings of the hammer’s face. He allows himself several long moments just holding onto Mjölnir and feeling the now pleasant humming of her power resonate within him.
As the phone rings, Tony exhales.
But instead of the aromatic smell of black coffee permeating the air, Tony startles awake when he hears the mug smash into a hundred pieces. Brows furrowing, Tony blinks twice and looks at his hands.
“Sir was working for fifty-eight hours straight that time with little to no nutrition and an unhealthy amount of caffeine,” JARVIS offers then, the traitor.
There’s a huff of laughter beside him.
He’s still massaging his cheek when he glumly admits, “I didn’t mean it that way. I just wanted to see if the Tony I —
Tony, who’s in the middle of jumping over the corpse of a Chitauri in order to aim a jumping roundhouse kick at another about to stab him, blinks a few times upon hearing the voices of his teammates over the comms. He absolutely forgot about communicating with them out loud since he started fighting with Mjölnir.
Fuck, these assholes are definitely toying with him like a prey, and that thought just pisses Tony off even more.
Tony’s forlorn look is replaced by a puzzled one as his grip on the arc reactor tightens and he shakes his head.
“What the fuck,” Steve hears Clint murmur.
Everyone does as they’re told with no questions asked, Thor’s booming voice promising destruction upon their foe. Tony’s jogging soon turns into a full sprint after he glimpses at least three Leviathans coming through the portal, the last one entering the largest he’s ever seen and it’s clear from the sheer size of it that it’s the mothership. Tony races past upturned poles and jumps over slabs of concrete and burning vehicles when he feels the heat of the Chitauri’s weapons whizzing past him. Berating himself for throwing down the same weapon in favor of running, Tony curses again and proceeds to run in a zig zag pattern.
The sight of Tony clutching Mjölnir, albeit uncomfortably, while in his Iron Man suit easily outshines the throbbing pain coursing through her in that moment.
?” Bruce interrupts with a pointed look. Steve blinks and he flushes slightly at the mild accusation in the physicist’s tone. Bruce sighs again and then shakes his head. “I’m sorry, that was uncalled for. It’s just that sometimes, Steve, you forget that there’s more to a person than the persona they project, and Tony’s a prime example of that. He has more layers than an onion and has walls of defense higher than the Great Wall. We’re well aware that the two of you don’t really get along and aren’t the best of friends, but come
“Please take care of yourself,” Tony says with an almost pleading look.
Pepper snorts, and Tony’s lips twitch in amusement.
“That wasn’t your fault,” Bruce’s voice suddenly interjects.
man. And I’m sorry that it’s taken an accident for me — for
All things considered, it was a good way to end a productive and manic day.
After placing a second batch of grilled cheese sandwich on the pan, Steve feels Tony approach as the latter opens the fridge to take out a jug of milk. At Steve’s raised eyebrow, Tony grins boyishly at him.
“Hey, Tony,” Bruce begins in the most casual tone he can muster.
Tony shrugs. “DUM-E broke the coffee pot, and I wanted coffee so I went to the kitchen to make some. I was past the point of functioning like a human being that night that I accidentally grabbed M instead of the coffee pot.”
Tony nods mutely, and he blinks back the stinging in his eyes because
? So much for being a sharp-eyed super soldier.
“Yes, sir.”
“It should have, yes,” JARVIS replies haltingly.
He doesn’t know how long he stands there because he was in the middle of admiring Steve’s perfectly chiseled features (and those lashes are
Tony waves it off as he drains his glass. “Free alcohol, baby — oh no, I paid for this. Still. There’s alcohol, so. Plus, I like Martin, he’s one of the best Engineers in my department. Too bad he’s going back to Portugal, but it’s okay.”
“Always a pleasure, sir.”
who Natalia Romanova is.
Okay, enough of these feelings talk! Besides, he has more important things to think about.
“It’s alright. I don’t mind.”
Tony at all. Steve wouldn’t go so far as to remark that it’s like having the engineer’s twin with them, because God knows one Tony Stark existing in this world alone is already too much to handle. No, that’s not it at all. If Steve were to guess, it’d be like having a version of Tony from an alternate dimension. If that even makes some damn sense.
Pepper rolls her eyes but doesn’t say anything. But if her knowing smile is anything to go by, there’s no doubt in Tony’s mind that she was able to read between the lines. She always does, anyway.
Thor cocks his head. “I beg your pardon?”
, his inner voice supplies helpfully. With another deep breath, Steve continues. “We start from the beginning. We befriend Tony Stark.”
Before Steve can call out a greeting to the unwanted visitors, the creature in the middle, who’s probably the leader of the group, takes a step forward and cocks its head at Steve and the others.
Steve cocks his head as he lets that information sink in. Tony and Thor have been
to do more.” Tony licks his lips, and he lifts his head to look at the sun setting on the horizon. His companion remains quiet, patient. “And the… people in my life who care for me… say that what I do is more than enough. That I have more than made up for it. But I don’t think that I do. And I also know that some people, er, think otherwise. That I don’t deserve the second chance I got. Because they have a preconceived notion about me based on past behavior and such. I mean, they didn’t
While Tony continues to take notes on reparations for his suit, Steve meanwhile inspects one of the blueprints displayed in front of him, absently noting that it’s a schematic of new arrows for Clint. He keeps track of Tony’s movements from the corner of his eye, lest the stubborn genius injures himself further. He hears him clear his throat, back now fully turned to the super soldier, and Steve is momentarily distracted at the view of Tony’s round, plump ass. It’s a spectacular ass, alright, and Steve got so lost in another fantasy of him worshipping Tony’s body that he completely fails to hear the whooshing sound behind him signaling the arrival of one of their teammates entering the workshop.
“Aye. Even I admit that that was mildly disturbing.”
As if Tony isn’t capable of expressing thoughts and emotions well beyond a 12-year-old.
“Steve…”
“You’re a shameless man, Stark,” Steve voices out with a shake of his head.
“I know that, but I can operate the suit from here. Well, it’s JARVIS who will, and I’ll call out patterns from the sky. The public doesn’t know I’m out of commission, right?” When Steve shakes his head, Tony continues in that same calm, tight voice. “Then I don’t want to give them a reason to question the lack of Iron Man’s presence. I— it’ll be okay, guys.”
Steve blinks, and when he looks around he sees the same astonishment he feels mirrored on the others’ faces.
“JARVIS, how long has Tony been asleep?”
Sharing one last grin, they leave their little spot at the corner of the venue, shoulders brushing against each other in solidarity.
Tony, not
“Deal. I mean, I promise. Wanna pinky swear on that?”
What?
After a few seconds, Tony starts to sing.
The breaks between missions aren’t as scarce as Steve initially thought it would be. They could go weeks without hearing the blaring alarm to assemble, which made the super soldier restless at first. It took him several months and accepting an invitation to join Bruce in his daily routine of doing yoga at the crack of dawn to finally allow himself to relax the stiffness in his muscles. Albeit not much, but it’s progress and Steve still counts it as a win.
“That sounds like a good idea,” Tony nods at Bruce, his smile turning faint. His gaze turns inward then, as if he’s recalling a memory. It’s only thanks to the serum that Steve’s able to hear Tony mutter under his breath, “Maybe I’d get answers about why I’m in-between.”
“Stay safe,” Steve whispers, breath tickling Tony’s cheek as he continues to look fondly at the brunet.
In a too calm voice that even Tony thinks sounds suspicious, he replies, “Yeah? And what’s gonna happen after I get all my answers, J? What’s the endgame?”
Looking forward to it. 😊
“Yeah?” Tony looks up from his tablet for the second time, a curious glint in his eye.
Besides, it doesn’t matter now. Not anymore, anyway. What’s done is done, and he’s already made his decision. All Tony can do is make each second of this moment count and milk every look Steve’s giving him now.
“You should be a brand ambassador for Hintz, then.”
“We need a new plan,” Natasha interjects firmly, crossing her arms over her chest and leaning back in her chair.
It’s probably in his imagination that Tony squeezes his hand, and Steve probably shouldn’t think too much if it takes another three seconds before they let each other go, even as they walk in closer than normal proximity towards the waiting elevator.
Knowing that Bruce is currently holed up in his lab with the assistance of JARVIS, in the process of getting to the bottom of Tony’s predicament, gives Steve hope that they’re a step closer to solving the mystery.
as well, Captain.”
“Yeah, well, I haven’t been sleeping much,” Tony grumbles under his breath, but he does as he’s told and slowly makes his way to his bedroom, heedful of his still tender ribs and tired muscles.
Once Bruce and Tony are seated — the former settling beside Steve and the latter taking the vacant one opposite him — they start to pile up their plates with the food Natasha and Steve prepared. The super soldier keenly observes Tony carefully spoon oatmeal onto his bowl, how he hesitates for a fraction of a second before he picks up the container of maple syrup and pouring a significant portion into his oatmeal. From the corner of his eye, Steve notices Bruce wince at the amount of maple syrup Tony just poured, but his focus shifts to Tony’s again when the engineer added almonds and a few berries onto the bowl before he starts to mix them together at a slow pace.
It takes Steve longer than expected to process what just happened in the last five minutes before he releases a shaky breath. One look at Tony’s sleeping figure and the super soldier unconsciously finds himself drawn towards the man, picking up his ministrations from earlier.
A heavy sigh.
“Bruce, do you have any updates on the weapon?” Steve vocalizes.
, to which he responds with a small wince.
Hahaha I know. Sorry, don’t know why I said that. Just me being maudlin.
Once finished with his impassioned speech, Tony hastily gets up from his seat, the chair scraping loudly against the tiles as it was roughly pushed back. Without another word, the engineer quickly walks out, his fists clenched by his sides — and his stride doesn’t break, JARVIS acting ahead as the elevator doors slide open to take Tony far away from the gobsmacked team.
“You’re not alone in this, Tony,” Steve murmurs, and there’s a promise in his tone that the engineer doesn’t miss.
But one thing’s for sure: this much good press will certainly increase Stark Industries’ stocks, thus keeping the board of directors happy and off his radar for several weeks, which Tony prefers and considers a blessing in disguise.
“You know,” he starts conversationally. He waits until Tony lifts his head to meet his gaze to continue speaking, “In the twenty-six months I’ve been awake in this century, you’re the first person to tell me those things. And it’s true. It can be overwhelming. Some days I feel like I’m going to lose my mind because there’s just
“Don’t bullshit me, Tony. My being out of the country hasn’t stopped you before from reaching out to me before.”
“No no, it’s fine,” Tony reassures Steve with a shake of his head. He unconsciously bites his lower lip as he stares unseeingly at his tablet, brows scrunched up in contemplation. Eventually, Tony lets out a sigh, and he sets the device aside so it’s now laying face down between him and Steve. “It’s not that I
“See? Was that so hard?” Oh, he’s having so much fun teasing Tony. It’s made sweeter because it’s just the two of them.
The silence lasts for a minute, maybe more, before Tony reacts. He hears the shorter man breathe out shakily, jaw snapping shut as he blinks several times. Steve patiently stands and allows Tony to gather his bearings. If their roles were reversed and it was Tony who poured his heart out to Steve, the super soldier would most likely react the same.
. I suppose I can understand that it must be overwhelming to know that you
from Avatar and the
who approached Steve and extended an olive branch, not the other way around. It’s not to say that Steve was afraid — well, okay, he was partly afraid — but it’s more of him being anxious of making a first impression that often prevents him from building new bridges.
Mjölnir insists stubbornly.
Tony bites his lower lip, and Steve sees the conflicting emotions in his dark brown eyes before the engineer eventually answers, “Will you — ? I mean, I… Steve, I — I need…”
Steve’s lips twitch into a small smile, and he looks at the Norse god with gratitude in his eyes.
“You really think I’m worthy?” He asks, not expecting an answer but is astonished when the humming intensifies. Tony swallows past the lump that quickly grows in his throat, and it’s through sheer force of will and stubbornness that he manages to say, “Nah, girl. This is probably just a one-time thing. I’m pretty sure I’m gonna crash in the next couple of hours, so I’m chalking this up to another accident, because God knows this night’s been a clusterfuck from one thing to another. And there’s no way this is gonna happen again.”
But before he can say anything else, he sees a small herd of Chitauri coming towards him. He shoots a repulsor blast at the nearest before he executes a jumping roundhouse kick at another. He sidesteps the next alien then does a somersault over an upturned taxi to avoid getting hit by the energy-based weapon. In a spike of adrenaline, he runs towards the next alien, successfully blocking the jab that would’ve hit his sternum before he flips them over until the spear-like weapon is in his hands. He fires off one round at the creature, not waiting to see it go down like a sack of potatoes before he swivels to aim and fire at the half dozen Chitauri advancing towards him.
he’s felt.
Steve curses then as he swivels his head to look at where Iron Man is positioned above them.
Blushing brightly at the photo, Steve sends it to Tony before he loses his nerve and types out his reply before hitting send.
In the distance, he can glimpse his teammates taking down stray Chitauri, and after a quick conversation with Mjölnir, he addresses the Asgardian prince.
“Bet you were sick and tired of that place, Stark,” Clint quips with a teasing grin. “I know I would have.”
of fantasies involving the Captain and himself.
Steve, aware that his teammate is currently having an internal conversation with a sentient weapon (good God, how is this his life? The future is
Smiling wryly, Tony ducks his head and shrugs helplessly. “I have decades’ worth of issues to overcome. I’m not gonna feel better about myself overnight ‘cos of a couple of heartfelt speeches. I’m not gonna wake up tomorrow and finally believe that I’m that person you guys preach about. But I suppose, what I’m trying to say is that… I
. But thinking back to last night’s drinking session with his teammates, Tony still can’t bring himself to regret allowing himself to get carried away with his alcohol intake.
Steve frowns, but before he can open his mouth, Bruce beats him to it.
But alright. Since he’s being so honest with himself right now, it doesn’t hurt to think that the real reason why he’s started writing this stupid list in the first place is because it’s Tony that he has to befriend. Tony, whom he’s butted heads with since the beginning and has proven Steve wrong about most, if not all, of his initial assumptions about the genius-billionaire after reading his file for The Avengers Initiative. There’s just
“Jarvis, will you please—”
“What is it?” asks Steve, apprehension evident in his tone.
Around the world, people had reached a consensus and started trending different hashtags like
To help her case, Bruce interjects with an easy smile. “Seven billion people got to see you wield a war-hammer created solely for a god, and everyone’s shitting their pants because who they once assumed to be a harbinger of death and destruction actually turns out to be the worthiest of them all. Just saying,” the mild-mannered scientist adds with a shrug.
Given the fact that he’s also recognizable with his signature goatee, the genius had no qualms shaving it off as well. Really, it was starting to itch anyway. And being clean-shaven for the first time in,
So his brain might have short-circuited at the view. Christ, what did he do to deserve this?
Blinking a few times, it takes the scientist half a minute to answer.
“I still can’t believe that Bruce Hulked out at Avalon,” Tony comments with a chuckle. He’s swirling his straw around the contents of his second chocolate milkshake, arms resting on the table as he sips his drink. He chuckles once more and then says, “I’ve never seen Wanda look so horrified at getting a front view of Hulk Jr.”
Which is the mothership since the damn portal is still open. From the corner of his eye, Tony sees a lone Chitauri limping from behind a broken post several feet from where he’s standing. His eyes almost instantly lands on a piece of sharp, jagged metal that’s probably from one of the shattered vehicles. Tony picks it up, only to toss the metal into the air before swinging Mjölnir. His aim hits the poor bastard in the jugular, body slumping to the ground a second later.
“Steve,” Tony breathes out.
Steve could be wrong, but there’s a (slight) chance that his hunch could also be right.
“Something’s not right,” Natasha points out, Widow’s Bite charged and her Glock at the ready.

The look on Tony’s face is one Thor believes he won’t forget, and the ensuing “sparring” that takes place soon after is one the Asgardian counts as a victory. It takes several occurrences before he notices Tony’s body language start to loosen the more Thor coaxes him to train with Mjölnir, citing that it is imperative he learns to handle her in a fight, even if he possesses his Iron Man suit. After the ninth consecutive time he interrupts Tony’s workout, his friend looked almost completely at ease, if only because he’s also grown fond of Mjölnir. Thor would even go so far as to assume that his dear hammer may have played a significant part in easing his friend’s anxiety.
It's only after several seconds pass that JARVIS finally decides to speak up.
“Initiating TIB-A Protocol,” JARVIS answers serenely, but there’s no mistaking the tinge of concern in the AI’s tone. “Sleep well, sir.”
Truly, it was a perfect decision to skip Movie Night for this.
When Mjölnir first spoke to him that fateful night he first lifted her — god, it felt like a lifetime ago, just thinking about it — to say that Tony was shocked at that discovery would be the understatement of the century. Accepting the truth of his ability to wield Mjölnir didn’t take him long, but accepting his
“Tony, get the hell out of there,” Steve orders, panic evident in his voice. “Let’s regroup at the corner of 33rd street. Thor and Hulk — take down those Leviathan ships before it causes more structural damage. Clint, make contact with SHIELD and alert them that we’ll need all hands on deck.”
Absolutely filthy reasons.
He lets out a shaky breath, doesn’t miss to catch sight of Bruce’s left hand twitching from his position beside Steve. Steve, who’s still standing and staring at Tony with a worried look.
Unbeknownst to him, Tony didn’t realize that much sooner than later, it would become a reality.
Tony flushes slightly as he flounders for words. Upon seeing the engineer blush, Steve is suddenly struck dumb when his heart skips a beat, and it obviously had nothing to do with the news of Tony’s sudden inability to say the word ‘fuck’.
“The scan was finished yesterday, and I’m still busy studying the schematics of the weapon.” Then the physicist turns to Tony with a tentative smile on his face as he adds, “Tony, if you’re feeling better, would you like to come down to my lab after? I could really use your expertise in this.”
He’s not surprised when he sees recognition spark in Tony’s eyes.
Or, part of a plan.
“I love you, Tony.”
Before Steve can think of a response, a voice interrupts them. “Lo and behold what?”

Steve and Bruce shake their heads while Nat smirks at them and playfully quips, “Guess you haven’t dug deep enough in SHIELD’s servers to see that video of Clint serenading Fury.”
“Almost there, almost there,” Tony chants.
Bruce takes several deep breaths before he manages to reply, “I think it’s safe to say that as of this moment, it’s just Science
“Yeah. It does,” Tony admits with a small smile.
“We do not speak your language,” Steve addresses the leader with a shake of his head. He takes a step forward. “What business do you have in our planet?”
“… How is that even related?”
“Dunno. Twenty-six hours, I guess.”
It takes Tony half a minute to recognize the face of the person who was following him, and when he does, his stomach lurches uncomfortably at the sight of the man he hasn't seen in more than two decades.
Bruce shakes his head. “No. It’s more like he’s
“There’s another thing I noticed,” the redhead muses.
somewhat of a precaution. To not get carried away. To not lose objective. To solve the mystery and help Tony get better.
“Can’t believe I’m gonna say this but I never pegged you to be the type of person to completely zone out,” starts Tony, and he’s smirking as he takes a sip of coffee from his perched position on the kitchen counter. “If I had known I’d lose your attention while talking about the Energy Crisis, you should’ve said so.”
