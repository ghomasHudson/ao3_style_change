Holmes, who derived no small amount of personal satisfaction from the boy’s display of intelligence and initiative, was unsparing in his praise of the boy, whom he was beginning to look upon as a protégé, of sorts. “I tell you, Watson, he could go far with the right sort of education.”
“I have been about totally frustrated is what I have been about,” Holmes shouted irritably. He emerged a minute or so later in his favorite dressing gown, and took the whiskey and soda that Watson handed him, nodding his thanks and sipping appreciatively.
Lanterns were brought in short order and the others stepped aside as Holmes, on hands and knees, spent the next ten minutes crawling the length of the dank passageway, poking into every corner and cranny. He finally emerged into the daylight with the knees of his trousers covered in filth, a glint in his eye, and something tenderly clutched between thumb and forefinger. He held it up for the others to see, his thin lips turned up in a triumphant smile.
“Guess? Dear chap, I don’t guess. Just look at the two of you: Your boots and trouser bottoms are covered with mud — that distinctive brownish-blackish muck you will find only in the mean streets of the East End. A spattering of the stuff is even on the upper legs of your trousers and on your hats over there. You must have been crawling around in it half the night, noses to the ground, I shouldn’t wonder.” He snorted. “Obviously called out to investigate the murder of that poor woman, eh?”
“Please make yourself comfortable, gentlemen,” said Holmes. “I see our Mrs. Hudson has provided you tea. May I freshen your cups? No. Well then, help yourself to cigars if you like. You will find them in the coal scuttle by the fireplace there. I won’t tempt you with a brandy or whiskey, seeing as you are still on duty.”
Watson took a deep breath. “Well, Holmes, it’s at least as horrible as the other. More grotesque, if anything.”
Warren approached within inches of Holmes and waved a finger under his nose. “It’s my aunt Fanny’s arse, that’s what it is! Now, what do you think of that?”
Abberline removed a pocket notebook from his coat and flipped through the pages, finally coming to the section he was looking for. He cleared his throat.
After leaving the mortuary, despite the lateness of the hour and lack of light, Holmes had insisted upon a visit to the scene of the crime. As anticipated, the visit was unfruitful. Holmes could do little more than ascertain where the body was first discovered, and “take the lay of the land,” as he put it. Buck’s Row, where the body had been found, was much like any of the other mean streets of Spitalfields, a narrow, gloomy passageway lined with rows of ramshackle tenements smelling of rotting garbage. One end of the alley let out into Baker’s Row, the other into Brady Street.
“Watson, this is more in your line,” he said, gesturing toward the body at his feet. “I would value your opinion. In the meantime, I’ll just take a brief stroll.” He then wandered off, examining the ground as he went, like a man who had just dropped his last coin and would go without dinner unless he found it. Several of the police detectives exchanged looks. There were incredulous smiles on the faces of more than a few.
Chandler smiled grimly despite himself. “I’m somewhat of a student of your methods, Mr. Holmes, and realize the importance of leaving things undisturbed as much as possible until a thorough search has been made for clues.”
Holmes brooded for a minute before answering, then shook his head violently as if to rid himself of depressing thoughts. “My next step? Why, a good wash-up and dinner! If I am not mistaken, that is Mrs. Hudson’s footfall upon the tread, and she most assuredly is accompanied by a leg of mutton, if the smells emanating from the kitchen are to be credited. And I, dear fellow, am famished!”
“You were the first to arrive, I am told,” said Holmes. “How very fortunate for the rest of us who followed. Would that you could have kept the herd at bay.”
Holmes reached out his hand, and in a small gesture of apology for his harsh words gently adjusted the collar of Abberline’s suit coat. “You need not attempt a reply, Inspector,” he said with a grim smile. “There can be no adequate response, and I expect none.”
“Leather Apron,” mused Holmes, “Leather Apron. How very convenient.” The sarcasm in his voice, though gently expressed, was unmistakable, and Abberline visibly blanched.
Abberline cleared his throat and continued: “We have a most dreadful mess on our hands at the moment, Mr. Holmes, a horrible mess, and frankly I am at a loss as to how to deal with it. I don’t mind admitting to you that as things now stand, the matter would appear to be beyond the capabilities and resources of the Metropolitan Police.”
“Holmes? Holmes?” bellowed Warren, making it sound like an accusation. “I thought you said Home Office!”
Abberline shook his head and looked up, meeting Holmes’s gaze finally. It apparently took some courage for him to do so. “He is known in the area as ‘Leather Apron.’ He habitually wears one, you see. He is a cobbler or boot finisher by trade.”
The questions came in rapid-fire order and were delivered at something approaching parade-ground decibels, apparently his normal speaking voice. “From the Home Office, are you? I knew it! I can spot you bloody Home Office wallahs a mile away! Well, I won’t have you snooping around here with your striped trousers and effeminate ways! I won’t have it, d’ya hear! Don’t be bothering my officers with a lot of damn fool questions! They have better things to do with their time, or should, by gad!”
He was obviously exhausted from being up all night; his face was drawn, his eyes empty. He was a man who had suffered shock and was emotionally drained.
His voice trailed off and with a faint gesture of futility he let the sentence hang in midair. He returned to his chair and burrowed deeply into it.
“Well, Mr. Holmes,” he said by way of greeting, “your prognostication was entirely correct. It would seem that you have your other murder.”
“No,” came the shouted reply. “The telegram says merely, ‘Come in haste. Another Whitechapel outrage.’ And then the address, Twenty-nine Hanbury Street.”
I call to your particular attention that at the behest of the late Dr. Watson, included in the document attached hereunto, none of the contents of this file may be publicly revealed until the year 2000, or until such time as fifty years shall have passed from the date of his death, whichever comes later.
Watson could restrain himself no longer at this admission. “What refreshing candor from a Scotland Yard man,” he said, smiling broadly. “You are to be congratulated, Inspector. You fellows usually show great reticence in admitting half as much.” He gave Holmes a wink. “Something to do with this Whitechapel business, I would wager.”
Chandler, in a tone of voice containing more than a hint of doubt, joined the conversation: “There are many smokers present among us, Mr. Holmes. You yourself are one, I believe, as is Dr. Watson, whom I observed smoking a cigarette a short while ago. Surely, it could belong to any one of us.”
But Holmes did not reply. Instead, he gazed pointedly up at the ceiling, and for a moment Watson wondered if he had even heard the question. Finally Holmes drawled: “I think it would be best, old man, if I kept that knowledge to myself.”
“Do I? Do I indeed? Well, let us try a little test, shall we? Take, for example, the couple sitting at the table to my left and slightly behind me. You’ve been eyeing the young lady avidly enough during our meal. I deduce that it is the low cut of her gown that interests you, for her facial beauty is of the kind that comes mostly from the paint pot and is not of the good, simple English variety that usually attracts your attention. What can you tell me about the couple in general?”
“If it were me,” said Thicke, “I would ‘ave made straightaway for Brady Street and thence for the underground station at Whitechapel Road. Easy to get lost in the crowd there.”
Holmes nodded. “I doubt if he made his escape this way. He must have used the passage and walked right out through the door, calm as you please. A cool fellow, this.”
As they threaded their way toward the entrance minutes later, Watson had to step to one side to avoid colliding with a man rushing headlong into the restaurant: a short, round individual with a large mustache, who after a hurried glance around the room made directly for the table occupied by the couple in question, profuse with apologies once having arrived. He was carrying a bulky briefcase and was dressed in a sagging dark business suit, not of the best cut or material. His voice, which could be clearly heard over the hubbub of the restaurant, had a decidedly middle-class accent —
“Would it be presumptuous of me to ask who this suspect is, Inspector?” There was a slight edge to his voice.
Holmes leaned forward in his chair with anticipation, his eyes glinting fiercely in the light of the table lamp.
Chandler shrugged and glanced around the yard. “Well, as to that, I don’t know. If I missed anything, it wasn’t for the lack of trying. But I’ve been all over this yard with a fine-tooth comb and haven’t come up with much, just a few of her poor possessions that were scattered about — and this.”
to have been seen, in your words — that alone makes him the prime suspect? I should think that if he resides there, he quite possibly has legitimate business to be seen there.”
Watson, who had been handed the telegram as soon as he was bundled half dressed into the hansom by Holmes, was trying unsuccessfully to make out its message by the feeble light of the coach lamp, but the jouncing and buffeting of the speeding conveyance made it impossible.
It was not long before they were ushered to a table, despite several parties of late diners waiting to be seated; for the eminent Mr. Holmes and his companion were not unknown to the manager, Mr. Crathie, who ruled his domain with a majesty and manner the czar himself would have envied. Shortly after taking their places, they were served a light supper of smoked salmon and capers, accompanied by a frosty bottle of hock.
Holmes, who was fastidious in his dress and surprisingly fashion conscious, and the possessor of an extensive wardrobe now that his success permitted it, allowed a slightly patronizing tone to color his reply.
As he came closer to the pair, the man made an effort to hide his face, an act which called attention to himself all the more, resulting in Dick’s being somewhat more observant than he would have normally been. He was dressed as a gentleman, a “toff,” as Dick described him to his listeners in the pub. He wore a deerstalker, probably brown, and a long dark coat, and he carried a small satchel of some sort, made of shiny leather or a similar material. He was of average height and he had a mustache. The two words Dick heard him speak confirmed he was a gentleman because the words were spoken in a cultured, upper-class accent.
Watson, after a while, got up to shut the window. He felt chilly all of a sudden. Holmes had always shared his confidences with him, even in the most sensitive of cases. If he felt he could not confide in him in this matter, it must be very, very serious indeed: Far more serious and sensitive than anything Watson could think of. He remained at the window, gazing out at the street below.
That was the sum total of Dick’s description of the man. Because of the poor light in the street, no more could be seen. And nothing more was heard. Dick continued on his way, and that was the last he saw of Annie Chapman.
“You have as good a chance of being right as wrong,” responded Holmes, “inasmuch as there were only two ways our man could have gone.”
“Yes, I see.” He looked around him. “She probably led the way through the passage from the street and he took her unawares as they entered the yard.”
Waving Abberline’s effusive thanks and apologies aside, Holmes took a protesting Watson by the arm and proceeded out the door.
“This, I think, you will find of some interest,” Holmes said to Abberline, handing him the small glassine envelope. “It was discovered a short while ago at a location where the Chapman woman may have last been seen alive. It, in all probability, belonged to the man with whom she was seen, the very same man who may have accompanied her to number 29 Hanbury Street.”
Abberline shook his head. “No, nothing of the sort. Except, as I said, the first quick look-around that Neil conducted right after discovering the body. Not ideal conditions to find anything.”
Accordingly, upon consultation with the firm’s solicitors, and having determined you to be the only surviving son and heir of said Dr. Ian Anstruther, Cox & Company deem it will have acquitted itself of its responsibility by delivering over to you the aforementioned file.
Abberline kicked the ground with a foot. “What bothers me is that there are no signs of a struggle. As you can see, there is no proper paving here, just a patchwork of stones and earth. If the woman put up any sort of resistance, you would expect to find some indications of it. Yet, the ground doesn’t seem to have been unnaturally disturbed. She must have come here with him voluntarily, or even brought him here. Certainly, she was not dragged by force.”
“Quite by accident I arrived on the scene within minutes of the body being discovered. I’m on nights at the Commercial Street Station and was making a tour of the area. It was shortly after six A.M., and I had just rounded the corner into Hanbury Street when I encountered three men running toward me, shouting. At first I thought it was one man being chased by the other two, and that the three of them must be the worse for drink. Then I thought it must be a house on fire, they were that agitated. Then they were upon me and shouting, ‘Murder! Quick... it’s horrible...’ I tell you, Mr. Holmes, I have never seen anyone in such a state as I did these three. Well, as they led me the way back along Hanbury Street toward number 29, I tried to piece their story together.” He slipped his notebook out of his coat pocket.
“Wh’ell h’anyw’ys, h’its h’imposs-ee-bul ta figg’r, dere’s so much, ah, so much, watcha-callit goin’ about.”
He paused and tugged at an ear. “But of late there has been something new, which is why we” — he nodded toward Thicke — “have been temporarily assigned to the East End, along with a dozen or so other chaps. During the last several months there have been a rash of murders that are distinctly out of the ordinary, that don’t fit the usual pattern — unusually vicious crimes, all committed with a knife, all perpetrated against women, and all of the women being ‘unfortunates,’ as they’re called — common prostitutes with hardly a copper coin to their names. In other words, Mr. Holmes, these murders don’t appear to have any motives, none at all. They appear to have been committed for the thrill of it! The sheer bloody thrill of it, if you’ll pardon my language.”
He led Holmes over to a cold water tap in a corner of the yard. Nearby, on the ground, lay a leather apron, saturated in water.
Holmes looked at him quizzically from across the table, an amused smile on his thin lips. “Murder! Murder most foul! Really, Watson! Surely you are not so completely unobservant that you failed to take note of the cries of the news vendors as we left the theater. The street is fairly ringing with their voices! ‘Orrible murder in Whitechapel,’” he mimicked. “‘Sco’ln’ Yard w’out a clue.’”
The first gray light of dawn was filtering through the window draperies when Holmes finally climbed into his bed, his once-immaculate evening clothes an untidy pile in the corner by the dressing table. No sooner had he pulled the covers over his shoulder than there was a light tap at the door and Watson stuck his head in.
“Yaas,” Holmes drawled, the single word heavy with sarcasm. He examined his fingernails. “The wealthy American couple, just come over from Paris on the boat-train without their servants. He’s in railroads, in the western regions of the United States, I believe, but has spent no little time in England. They are waiting — he, rather impatiently, anxiously — for a third party to join them, a business acquaintance, no doubt — one who is beneath their station but of no small importance to them in any event.”
It was a fragment of a bloodstained envelope bearing a regimental crest and postmarked London, 20 August 1888.
Watson did not know how long he remained at the bow window, how long he gazed unseeing at the passing scene beneath him, but the shadows in the street had lengthened considerably when a familiar, slight, unprepossessing figure, dodging through the traffic, caught his eye.
Holmes leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes, and the tips of his long, slender fingers came together in front of him.
Conversation between the two old friends was minimal, even monosyllabic, but there was nothing awkward about it or strained, merely a comfortable absence of talk. Small talk was anathema to Holmes in any case, but the two had known each other for so long, and were so accustomed to each other’s company, the mere physical presence of the other was enough to satisfy any need for human companionship. Communication between them was all but superfluous in any case, their respective opinions on almost any subject being well known to the other. And besides, throughout most of the meal Holmes had his face buried in one or the other of his precious newspapers, punctuating the columns of type as he scanned them with assorted sniffs and grunts and other sounds of disparagement occasionally interspersed with such muttered editorial comments as “Rubbish!” “What nonsense!” and, for variety’s sake, an occasional cryptic and explosive “
Watson glanced over Holmes’s shoulder. “Oh, that pretty little thing with the auburn hair — the one with the stoutish, balding chap, eh?”
They were at the mortuary within the hour. A hastily summoned four-wheeler conveyed them through the night to the slums of the East End, although the cab’s jarvey was most reluctant at first to take them.
Several theaters seemed to be emptying out at once along the Strand, and the street was rapidly filling with even greater throngs of gentlemen in crisp evening dress and fashionably gowned women, their laughter and chatter vying with the entreaties of the flower girls and the urgent cries of the newsboys working the crowd.
Abberline, who had stood there stoically though all of this, swallowed hard. “May I introduce to you, Sir Charles, Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. Gentlemen, the Commissioner of Police, Sir Charles Warren.”
“She be identified as one Mary Anne Nicholls,” said a gravelly voice from the shadows, that of a mortuary worker. “Polly Nicholls, she be called, forty-two years old, mother of five, prostitute. Only known address be a doss-house at number 18 Thrawl Street.”
The mortuary, located in Old Montague Street, was but a short walk, but it is a walk into a London few respectable Londoners even knew existed. The area of the East End known as Whitechapel, though in close proximity to the lofty sacred precincts of St. Paul’s, is a low and hellish place, and the few adjoining acres called Spitalfields, which they had now entered, is the lowest level of that hell. No more than a quarter-mile square, the darkened narrow streets and alleyways of Spitalfields contained the worst of London’s slums and the very lowest form of humanity. It had been fifty years since Charles Dickens had described the district in
In appearance, Hanbury Street was not very much different from Buck’s Row, the site of the earlier murder: It was forever in shadow. Narrow and dark, the sun’s rays rarely ever reached its recesses, and the brooding tenements that lined both sides of the street seemed shriveled with cold. They were dilapidated affairs, three-storied brick structures for the most part, with shops on the ground floor and flats above. A few contained boardinghouses on the upper floors: doss-houses, as they were called, reeking dormitories with rows of beds at four pence a night. Holmes and Watson picked their way through rotting garbage to where a small circle of police officials in civilian clothes was gathered in front of an open doorway at number 29. The doorway was located alongside an empty storefront which, as indicated by a weathered sign over the darkened window, was at one time occupied by a barbershop, N. BRILL, HAIRDRESSER AND PERFUMER the sign said in fading block letters, while other, smaller advertisements in the storefront window extolled the virtues of VASELINE and BRYLCREEM hair dressings.
The bath was accomplished with minimum awkwardness on John’s part, with no help from Sherlock, it should be said, who seemed not to have a modest bone in his body; dropping his trousers and pants where he stood and stretching languidly as John tried to steer him toward the bath tub.
The counting worked.  John’s ferocity melted away and he watched with tender affection as Sherlock, lying wilted on the sheets beside him, finally opened his eyes to look around for John.  When he found him, he smiled, said, “I love you, John,” in a rough whisper and closed his eyes again.  John grinned to himself; obviously a short rest was in order.
Satisfied Sherlock was recovering, John, wanting to examine him for injury, began to tug gently at the dirty T-shirt which Sherlock was still clutching.  He had an idea that Sherlock might like to feel the water directly on his skin now that he was stronger and to do so might help to revive him faster; he was still limp and unresponsive despite the improvement in his hydration. But as John attempted to pull the shirt from Sherlock’s fingers, Sherlock suddenly tightened his hold on it and tried to wrench himself from John’s grasp with a sharp cry of “Nō!” and a sob of anguish.  His movements were so violent that John almost lost his grip on him and he nearly tumbled to the hard floor of the shower. John cursed his thoughtlessness; of course the flow of water would dull their ability to scent one another. Sherlock could no longer sense him and in his dazed state he almost certainly thought he was back in the cruel hands of his captors.
“What I want is you, John.  I love you and I like caring for you but also I can’t begin to tell you how much your love means to me.  I want it for always. That you love me is a miracle; I think you might be a saint, John!  And if not, I intend to worship you forever as though you are one, regardless.”  He squeezed John’s hands.  “Now, was that your main objection to the idea of marrying me?”
John studied him carefully before saying, “Alright, but I think a bath is more advisable, given the state of your coordination and balance.”
John said nothing further and Blackburn remained silent as John put the vehicle into gear and drove ahead into the cold darkness of a rainy London night.
Sherlock had no opportunity to continue for John lunged suddenly at him; knocking him off his balance. Sherlock gasped as his feet shot out from under him on the water-logged leaves that littered the road and he flailed his arms backward wildly, grasping with his long fingers for a purchase on the rain slicked metal of the car. But he needn’t have bothered. The impact and direction of John’s tackle was such that he was lifted up and splayed on his back on the bonnet, arms flung wide, coat flapping open and his legs spread. Coordination still poor, his head snapped back and would have made hard contact with the steel bonnet had it not been caught in the palm of John’s hand, where it was eased down and held firmly. The pistol, still in the grasp of John’s other hand, landed with a deafening slam beside Sherlock’s left ear. It was followed immediately by John’s mouth landing on his with no less force; hard, bruising and biting. Sherlock’s mouth fell open under the onslaught and stayed that way, held by John’s thumb against his jaw.
John’s posture was just as rigid as Mycroft’s. He said, undeterred, “Well, regardless of who you are, you and I have a deal.  My conditions stand.”
Utterly out of control within seconds, he didn’t wait for an answer. He tore the T-shirt away from Sherlock to expose the whiteness of his belly and genitals to the torchlight. Sherlock appeared untouched but to John, maddened by aggressive alpha instinct and tortured with unfamiliar emotions, even this action wasn’t enough to reassure him that Sherlock hadn’t been violated by the other alphas. He could not scent Sherlock; all he could smell was the odour of his rivals on Sherlock’s skin and it was driving him wild. He snarled and pushed Sherlock’s slender thighs apart to see for himself what, if anything, had been done to his omega. Spiraling into madness completely, he even had the wild idea of claiming Sherlock as his own, right then and there. A remote part of his mind tried to protest, horrified by his sexual aggressiveness, but it wasn’t strong enough to stop him.
Sherlock was taken aback. Unsure how to respond he paused a moment. But before he could say anything further, to his surprise, John spoke again, his voice frayed but insistent. "They won't… tell me….. Do you know...is Harvey….still here?"
The effect of the water on the youth was startling. His breathing eased within seconds. With a soft sigh he turned his face to rest against John's bicep where John felt the light puff of air as he exhaled. John thought he caught a soft murmur of the word léodwynn, or home, followed by a murmured, “Iċ i þance."
He mentally shook himself and continued. "I'm sure that DI Lestrade will vouch for my partner's and my character." Here he looked hopefully at Lestrade. "Is there any possibility that we could look after the child in the short-term? Only temporarily, of course."
Watson accepted the file and turned to exit the office with barely a nod to Graves. Graves shrugged and dismissed him from his mind almost immediately: John H. Watson M.D.; Captain of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers; Honourable Discharge, Diagnosis PTSD − was a cold fish. But as long as he performed for the firm, Graves couldn’t have been less interested.
"John, John, wake up please. It's me, Sherlock, we can talk about this, but you need to wake up first, alright?"
But John had not run. Instead he had bent and grasped around for Lestrade's dropped weapon, and when he found it, he straightened, took careful aim and fired at the man who was trying to strangle Sherlock. The murderous curate was dead before he hit the ground; John's bullet, perfectly centred, passed through his heart and out again to lodge in a shimmering patch of mosaic on the far wall of the Chapel of Holy Souls.
Extensive research had already been conducted on Blackburn, presumably by the parties who had failed to apprehend him up to this point. Obviously the man was extremely intelligent and wary to have eluded capture for more than three months, the length of time they’d been trying to intercept him. John’s expression was grim when he finally rose from his seat and made his way to the basement of the building and to his assigned equipment locker. Blackburn’s hard work and dedication to the cause of terror, pain and death would come to an end tonight.
“Oh, my poor, sweet love.  Here, come here.” John crooned, putting his arms around him, “It’s okay, I understand. I would have been terrified too, Sherlock.  Is that why you have such a hard time sleeping even now?”
John turned his head to look speculatively at Sherlock once more before concluding, “Something about this whole case just isn’t adding up… and it hasn’t from the start.” He frowned again before saying in an anything but friendly tone, “Regardless, when we get to London, your handler and I are going to have a little chat about your safety and wellbeing going forward, Sherlock.”
With this reassurance, the boy scrambled to his feet and made straight for Sherlock, who was still standing perplexed, in the centre of the room. John made a silent plea to Sherlock to understand and play along, but he had no such luck. Unfortunately, Sherlock being Sherlock, he was deaf to silent pleas of any sort and remained motionless.
John usually enjoyed this time too but on this night he seemed unable to settle, sighing and fidgeting until he finally rose and could then be heard rummaging in the hall cupboard. Sherlock was unsure of what was actually in the hall cupboard, never having opened it himself, so he couldn't be certain as to what John was doing. He began to worry again, though, because something clearly was bothering John. He pondered in front of the telly for some time about what it could be before he realized that the flat was quiet and the film over. He sighed, turned off the telly and made for their bedroom.
John eased himself on top of Sherlock, holding Sherlock’s hands still with his own and locking their mouths together.  He offered deep, slow kisses while he gradually introduced his, by now, fully erect cock to Sherlock’s body. A touch of it against Sherlock’s side and his eyes flew open and he involuntarily winced away.
John, without turning, gulped and bit out a desperate laugh, “No, Sherlock, I’m beyond help! I think we can both see that!”
"Yes, I understand John." Sherlock stopped, not sure how to tell John what he had learned, unsure what his reaction would be. "John, because of the circumstances of his death, as standard procedure, the doctors ordered an autopsy on Geoffrey. His body was sent to Bart's. It…he…is still there, John, held until a post-mortem examination can be performed. It can take a long time, sometimes up to eight weeks before it's done…" What Sherlock did not tell John was that Harvey had refused his claim to Geoffrey's body and approved its disposal post-autopsy.
John’s heart rent in two at Sherlock’s grief.  He drew himself up over him, pressing against him and growling anxiously; frustrated that there was nothing he could do to alleviate his pain. Even as he acted, John knew it was an alpha response to its distressed omega, not that of a doctor to his patient, but he was powerless to stop it.
"I brought you chips…" Sherlock stopped, confused. That had not been what he had meant to say. But John seemed to think nothing of it, for he simply smiled and responded that he liked chips and what a good idea they were for lunch which eased Sherlock's confusion and somehow made everything alright.
John gave a sniff, followed by a small laugh.  “If you are sure, then yes, Sherlock.  I love you and I want to look after you for the rest of your life too.  I can’t think of anything more wonderful than being your husband.”
London’s popular press could be forgiven for indulging in sensationalism in this particular instance, for it was indeed a sensational occurrence. Victorian England had never experienced such a horrible, vicious crime. Such a thing was virtually unknown, unthinkable. Murders were indeed committed, but generally in connection with a robbery or as a result of a personal dispute. But rarely was the victim a woman, even of the lowest order. No Englishman would treat a woman so cruelly. If this kind of depravity existed at all, it existed on the Continent — in Germany or France or Italy. That was to be expected of foreigners, after all. But to have such a thing happen on home soil was simply without precedent. The public, highborn and low, was deeply shocked, and the popular press accurately reflected that view.
Holmes waggled a finger. “We must not guess, Wiggins. What we need is hard information. Now, tell me, did you or any of the other lads find anyone who actually saw anything? Someone who, for example, may have run into this, this ‘Dark Annie’ person in the streets before she was murdered?”
He then gripped Sherlock’s hair and forced his face up to Ed’s cock while pinching Sherlock’s nostrils closed with his other hand. Ed gripped the base of his cock and eagerly readied himself to thrust into Sherlock’s mouth when Sherlock would be forced to open it to gasp for breath.
His patient closed his eyes but his struggling had produced a fit of coughing and he gasped for air.  “Iċ i firmette, Ælfric, wæter, iċ i bidde!”
“Relax, Sherlock and breathe. Slow down, pay attention to where your hand feels best. Try holding the base of your cock with one hand and rubbing with the fingers of your other hand just below the head. Use firm pressure, like you’re giving a massage. That will eliminate the friction on your skin.”
John inhaled sharply and went rigid. “Sherlock!” he choked hoarsely. He drew in a ragged breath to steady himself. “Not now. We must get you away from here. Please, will you do as I say?”
“Yése, myn Ælfward.” Sherlock, comforted, lifted his face to press a quick, soft kiss on John’s lips and burrowed close, rubbing his cheek against John’s chest and closing his eyes in pleasure.
If Sherlock didn’t realize it though, should John tell him? If he did say something, what if he was wrong or if no further developments occurred? He would have upset Sherlock and perhaps strained their relationship for no good reason. If on the other hand he didn’t say anything and Sherlock was suddenly blind-sided by it in the future, the outcome could be devastating for him. He’d been pretty clear that he didn’t want any part of a typical Omega reproductive cycle.
“There, there…calm down please. I’m not going to harm you.”  John urged Blackburn to settle again with soothing hands.
"You know what?" he tried again, "I'm a doctor and you probably know that doctors help people, right? If you look at me you'll see."
John emerged from his room some time later. He came quietly down the stairs, glanced tentatively at Sherlock − who smiled reassuringly at him − and went to the kitchen. He appeared to be making tea. That was good thought Sherlock, feeling relieved; making tea was always a good sign.
Sherlock walked toward them slowly. December couldn't be seen inside the coat, although he could be heard chattering happily, having had his meal and drink and also presumably feeling relatively dry and warm.
Sherlock was horrified. John was ill! Why hadn't he seen it sooner!? Why hadn't he insisted that John tell him what was wrong yesterday when he'd first noticed something off!?
John no longer needed to ask questions: a wave of scent had caught up with the soldier and his catch, settling around them like mist in John’s tent.  John, a full blooded and un-bonded alpha was struck forcefully by the unmistakable, compelling scent of a young omega; an omega in heat, or very close to it and, John sniffed again, a virgin.  The second odor that struck him, as vile as the first was sweet, was the dark stench of aroused alphas, a number of them, of varying social status, eager to get to the young omega first and prepared to fight for the opportunity. John reacted instinctively; adopting a rigid stance, shoulders back and chest out, prepared to defend or attack, which ever was required first.
Sherlock was unmoved. He gave the interior of the cathedral an assessing glance and indicated to Lestrade that he thought they should split up. He then motioned that he intended to reach the Chapel of Holy Souls by the more exposed north side of the nave while Lestrade and John should stay to the south side. He then confirmed that Lestrade was armed before nodding his head firmly at John in an indication that John should stay with Lestrade. John lowered his head in acquiescence but his gaze didn't leave Sherlock. He watched him until he could be seen no more in the darkness.
Nevertheless, when he bent to the couch it was with gentle hands that he checked the condition of a motionless Blackburn. He noted with satisfaction that Blackburn was sleeping soundly and comfortably.
It hadn’t been a great shot John chided himself.  He’d aimed for the man’s heart, or where he’d estimated it to be, and instead had hit had him in the shoulder, severing a subclavian artery. John gave a slight shrug. Apparently, Moran was shorter than he’d remembered.
“Because the newspapers would love to hear all about the attempted kidnapping and torture of an innocent British citizen from home soil by the CIA, in collusion with this country’s Secret Service. I’m sure you are familiar with the name Maher Arar?”
John had succeeded in calming him by easing his distress over Mrs. Hudson, whoever she may be, and Mycroft. And Blackburn, once he was no longer agitated, had settled into confused mutterings.
Sherlock sat up unsteadily but determinedly. His voice, as hard and cold as his eyes, followed John. “You may be correct on the friends point.  As for the rest of it, Doctor, you are mistaken!  I assure you I am an amateur at nothing I do; chemistry, detection or otherwise.” He paused.  “Which is more than I can say for your clumsy efforts at kidnapping and incapacitating me! And…” He added coldly, “And it’s quite obvious that you fall short in the friends department yourself!”
"John! John, that's not what I meant," Sherlock reached to stroke John's cheek reassuringly. "I meant that I'm not used to feeling…er…aroused and I'm afraid I'll do something that hurts you or scares you." He looked down at his feet, "I'd rather die than harm or frighten you." He looked up at John again, a plea in his eyes.
Sherlock was going home to Baker Street. Once there he mounted the stairs two at a time and when he reached the landing he flung open the door of the flat. God, if anything had happened to John…he was truly frightened. But John was there, sitting on the sofa with his book. How attractive he is in the brown check shirt and the blue cardigan−the same deep-blue as his eyes−like autumn woods and quiet streams, thought Sherlock, momentarily distracted, I knew those were the right colours...
John resisted. “No, Sherlock! No! This can’t happen!” He repeated somewhat dazedly, “London, I’ve got to get you back to London. Just get you home.” He pulled a boneless Sherlock up and since he wasn’t moving of his own accord, pushed him; not in the direction of their vehicle but toward the Mercedes. Reaching it, he shoved Sherlock unceremoniously into the passenger seat and said, “Stay here, don’t move, please!” and shut the door.
John was calming as the storm of his grief passed. He lay still, his face tucked against Sherlock's shoulder, content, it seemed, to stay there for now. Soon likely he would fall asleep. He was still weak and he tired easily. Sherlock would wait until he awoke again and then make him a cup of tea; Sherlock was incapable of cooking or making much else but John seemed to appreciate the tea and so it was enough.
When John arrived shortly after, they settled at the table in a companionable silence to eat Mrs. Hudson's Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes and carrots.
John fell back as if stung. He put a hand to his mouth and his face burned with embarrassment. "Oh God, Sherlock, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have. Please forgive me! I acted without thinking, I'm just so glad you aren't hurt or dead, that I…"
Sherlock was looking up at him, obviously listening and rapidly processing what he was saying, so John took another chance and bared his soul. “I want to know that you trust me Sherlock, absolutely, not only with your own life but with the lives of our offspring, our children, if we have them. I want you to believe without doubt, that if you become pregnant, I will provide safety and security for you and your baby. It’s a vulnerable time for an Omega and I need to know that you trust me absolutely and completely, to take care of you both.”
John hugged Sherlock again and took a chance, “I’ve lived with you for five years now−even though you weren’t here for two of them,” he paused to poke Sherlock in the side in mock punishment, enjoying Sherlock’s wincing response, before he continued, “and I’ve observed you Sherlock, you are a very sensual man.”  John hoped like mad that that statement wouldn’t frighten Sherlock…
Watson’s posture stiffened. For the first time Graves saw a flicker of emotion in his eyes. And it wasn’t a nice one. “The target is working with QAT?”
“Alright then.  Let’s talk more about how magnificent and amazing I am.  I liked where that part of the conversation was going….”
He rounded a corner between two unused portables and saw ahead, as he’d guessed there might be, a large bunker, some distance away, backed by the barbed wire fence that encircled the base.  It was on the other side of a broad expanse of dry grass which might once have served as an air strip. John paused only for a second before deciding to sprint over it.  It was unlikely that Moran would suspect that John would follow them so quickly, if at all.  He would assume John was on medical duty likely for several hours at least.
Desperately, John tried to come up with an alternate strategy… Sherlock couldn’t hear him but perhaps the other way around might work? Sherlock trusted him as a protector, he might be thinking of him now, enough for John to sense him… and Sherlock couldn’t be far away, he hadn’t had time to go any distance; proximity would help.
Both Abberline and Chandler considered this new information. Chandler scratched his ear thoughtfully. “I don’t know. Even if you’re right, such a trifle doesn’t tell us much.”
Abberline shook his head. “My lads have been through all of those buildings, Mr. Holmes. We have questioned everyone who was in residence last night — everyone within sight of this yard. And of course we’ve questioned the residents of this building — all sixteen of them. Only one individual admits to hearing anything out of the ordinary, a man by the name of Cadosh who lives next door. He said he was in the yard behind his house — the yard that adjoins this one — at precisely a quarter past five — relieving himself no doubt — when he heard a woman’s voice sharply say no followed by the sound of something falling against the fence. He thought nothing of it at the time, he said. Didn’t give it a moment’s notice. Just turned right around and went back to bed. Said he hears much worse most nights.”
“Precisely! To suppress a scream and at the same time to pull her head back and bare her throat. Excellent, Watson! And which bruise would you say was made by the thumb?”
Chandler spoke up from the rear. “We’ve already searched here, Mr. Holmes. I assure you, there was nothing to be found: only rubbish, as one might expect.”
The topmost document was a letter, a sheet of heavy foolscap yellowed with age, bearing the logotype of Cox & Company, Charing Cross, London. It was dated July 30, 1929, and was addressed to Mr. Elwyn Anstruther, F.R.C.S., Harley Street. At first reading the brief contents were uninteresting, disappointing, a dry and formal communication from banker to client.
It took a flashing of police credentials and a most impressive display of Sergeant Thicke’s official manner to change the man’s mind. It did not change his humor. He lapsed into a sullen silence for the duration of the trip, a silence frequently punctuated by venomous over-the-shoulder glances, which expressed his feelings far more eloquently than words.
Holmes’s eyes narrowed and his lips compressed into a thin line. Chin in hand, he gazed at the sight intently.
Abberline referred to his notebook. “As I have said, we’ve interviewed everyone who lives in the immediate vicinity, or has legitimate business here, and we have a fairly complete list of those whose business would have had them up and about at that hour. We’ve cross-checked it, of course. No one that we’ve been able to question saw anyone who looked the least bit suspicious or out of the ordinary: Not a soul. No one who didn’t belong, no one who wasn’t known, no one who acted strangely.”
“Yes. But the inspector was not interested in my views, and I realize now that I was wasting his time.” Holmes waved an angry Watson to silence, for he had opened his mouth to protest. “So, with your permission, sir,” Holmes continued, “Dr. Watson and I will now take our leave.”
He stood looking down at the woman’s body for a long moment as if his gaze alone would extract the information he sought.
Inside the folder Mr. Jones found a thick sheaf of unbound manuscript paper, yellowed and somewhat brittle to the touch, the top sheet containing a dozen or so lines set down in a neat but spidery hand. Mr. Jones gasped, scarcely believing what he read. There were two names that seemed to separate themselves from the jumble of other words on the page and leap into sharp focus — two names from long ago. Both were remembered with awe, one with something approaching reverence, the other with utter horror:
It was not until considerably later in the afternoon that he reappeared, his expression troubled and thoughtful. His only response to Watson’s questioning look when he walked through the door was a shake of the head and a curt wave of dismissal. Clearly he was in no frame of mind for questions or conversation. He fell into his chair, placed a finger to his lips, and lapsed into deep thought.
Abberline sighed heavily. “Look, Mr. Holmes...” he began, spreading his hands in a gesture of helplessness.
“Now, look at the bruises here on the face, on the side of the jaw, and on the other side as well. What does that suggest to you?”
“Why, it suggests that our assailant was left-handed, Inspector. It would be quite natural for a left-handed person to grab his victim with his right so as to leave the dominant hand free with which to wield the knife.
Watson, well used to Holmes’s eccentric ways, resolutely ignored him, content to occupy his time by idly observing the passing scene. The captain and waiters, on the other hand, could not ignore him: An untidy pile of discarded newspapers was piling up at his feet, and they were in somewhat of a quandary over what to do about it. Holmes, of course, was totally oblivious to it all.
“I went over dere to where ‘e said,” explained Higgins. “Me ‘n me myte, Burt. An’ we rummages ‘round a bit an’ found ‘em in da stweet. I t’ought ya myght lyke to ‘ave ‘em.”
Gingerly, the body was eased onto the wheeled contrivance, covered with a scrap of canvas, and taken away. Holmes stood off to one side, looking on quietly. He then turned and started pacing up and down, deep in thought, his walking stick on his shoulder like a soldier’s rifle. The others observed him silently.
They then lapsed into silence, each wrapped in his own thoughts as the hansom sped through the city.
The stench from the streets was all but overpowering, a witches’ brew of smells: the familiar odors of poverty — garbage, excrement, boiled cabbage and decay, stale beer, cheap gin and unwashed bodies — was intermixed with the stink of coal gas which permeated everything, and the gagging vapors from the slaughterhouses and tanneries and small, run-down factories that were scattered about the area.
Holmes, who had little patience with those whom he deemed to have “less alert intelligences than his own” (It was
“Formal attire would usually be a last selection; an everyday frock coat or ‘Prince Albert’ and more casual garments for traveling and for weekend country wear would customarily be the first, second, and third choices.”
“Nothing,” repeated Holmes half to himself with a sigh. He then fixed Abberline with a keen, penetrating gaze. “Inspector, has it not occurred to your minions, whose foot sizes do them credit, that the very act of seeking out evidence can, if not accomplished artfully and with some care, obliterate that which they seek?”
“An’ he carried sometin’ like a Gladstone bag, but mebbe smaller, like wot I seen da doctor ‘ere carry some-da-tyme.”
Holmes glanced up at the windows of the surrounding buildings looking down into the yard. “No one heard anything, of course?”
After only the briefest of glances at the terrible sight, Holmes looked around him with an almost casual air, scanning the yard and the surrounding rooftops as if the dead woman were incidental. The sense of urgency and extreme excitement that he exhibited all the way from Baker Street was now nowhere in evidence. Instead, he displayed a cold, analytical air, calm and self-contained, almost disinterested.
It was a thought that appealed to that small part of him which was French, and he left the carriage smiling, leaving Watson to wonder why.
“This is most disturbing,” Holmes murmured, shaking his head. “Most disquieting. I cannot credit it at all.”
“Oh, yes — part of the time, at least. But for all that, the people we questioned who knew her said she was a decent sort.”
Holmes looked at him with new respect. “I see I’ve not misjudged you, Inspector. An astute observation on your part, one that most would miss.”
“I have no doubt the author was telling us,” he said after a time, “that we are all capable of such a transformation. Or, should I say transmogrification? — such a wonderful word, don’t you think? — capable of it even without the benefit of a remarkable chemical potion; that we all, each and every one of us, have the capacity for good and evil — the capability of performing both good works and ill — and precious little indeed is required to lead us down one path or the other. While hardly an original thought, it is sobering nonetheless.”
“If the popular press are to be believed —” He broke off in midsentence and laughed. “What a silly premise to go on, eh? Still, if there is even a shred of truth to their rather lurid accounts, this particular murder contains features that are not entirely devoid of interest. But what intrigues me more, Watson — what intrigues me infinitely more at the moment — is your astounding ability to filter from your mind even the most obvious and urgent of external stimuli. It’s almost as if you have an insulating wall around you, a magical glass curtain through which you can be seen and heard but out of which you cannot see or hear! Is this a talent you were born with, old chap, or have you cultivated it over the years? Trained yourself through arduous study and painstaking application?”
he did not suffer gladly; fools he suffered not at all), considered Warren coldly: “I think, Sir Charles, that you should uncock that finger, unless you intend to use it.”
With a flick of the tails of his coat, Holmes plopped himself down in his favorite chair and tented his hands in front of him. “Now, pray tell me how I might be of service.”
“That fragment of the envelope that was found near the body, bearing a regimental crest — the Sussex Regiment, I believe. Has any progress been made in tracking that down?”
, good form and Mr. Jones’s integrity demanded the bottle be returned undisturbed to its place of rest. Besides, if the truth be known, he was really partial to cognac.
“It wasn’t until they were in the process of undressing the body to prepare it for the doctor that the discovery was made.”
“Here, Watson, we will never get a cab in all this. Let us make our way to Simpson’s and wait for the crowds to dissipate.”
Holmes drew on his cigarette and continued, the exhalation of smoke intermingling with his dissertation. “That they are recently come from Paris is equally apparent: The lady is wearing the very latest in Parisian fashion — the low decolletage is, I believe, as decidedly French as it is delightfully revealing — and the fabric of the gown is obviously quite new, stiff with newness, probably never worn before. That they arrived this very evening is not terribly difficult to ascertain. Their clothes are somewhat creased, you see. Fresh out of the steamer trunk. Obviously, their appointment at Simpson’s is of an urgent nature, otherwise they would have taken the time to have the hotel valet remove the creases before changing into the garments. That they are traveling without personal servants can be deduced by the simple fact that the gentleman’s sleeve links, while similar, are mismatched, and the lady’s hair, while freshly brushed, is not so carefully coiffed as one might expect it to be. No self-respecting manservant or lady’s maid would permit their master or mistress to go out of an evening in such a state, not if they value their positions and take pride in their calling.”
John poured tea happily and urged Sherlock to a chair. He piled Sherlock's plate high with food and sat down across from him expectantly.
As he sat, the minutes ticking by, Sherlock again felt that sense of deep contentment he was starting to expect in the proximity of John; the flat was quiet and dim, warm from the fire, and John was safe in his arms…and what was his sweet scent? Sherlock breathed deeply. Fresh honey. Or was it vanilla? Actually, maybe it was more like sugar-sweetened chamomile tea…so light, so pure. And compelling. Once more he had the strong urge to bury his nose between John's neck and his shoulder and just breathe him in. But he shouldn't, he thought, if John woke it would probably frighten him, so it was best not to do it…still, Sherlock wanted to very much.
Sherlock began to speak, only to be cut off abruptly by John who glanced quickly across at him and said, “We should be safe now for as long as it takes to reach London. They won't have expected us to have been able to hijack one of their vehicles.”
Unbeknownst to Sherlock he was terrifying to John. Up close he was overwhelming; tall and broad-shouldered with an untamed ruffle of black curls descending over his forehead and his strangely glacier-coloured eyes, which were at that moment fixed intently on John. To John he looked like a wolf; a large, threatening Alpha wolf. John quailed. Panic rose in his throat and he gulped.
Mycroft raised his eyes briefly ceiling ward and breathed out slowly, “I can see I am to disappoint MI6 unless... both of you perhaps…?” he trailed off hopefully.  John, holding Sherlock’s head against his shoulder looked across at him and said, “I’m afraid not.  I’m retired.  I have a home life to attend to now and it’s going to keep me very busy. For the rest of my life, in fact.”
The place was cold and damp; it had obviously been vacant for some time. John guided Sherlock into a small kitchen where he settled him at the table.
John smiled through his tears at Sherlock's tense expression, "Yes, yes, Sherlock, thank you, thank you so much. You can't imagine what this means to me. How…happy this makes me. I can say good-bye now and…thank him. I'm sure it sounds strange," he looked at Sherlock hesitantly, "but after he was with me, I wasn't lonely any more, I talked to him every day about the things we would do together after he was born and how happy we'd be…and I want to tell him how sorry I am too that I couldn't protect him, couldn't stop him from being hurt the way a father is supposed to do. I need to ask for his forgiveness Sherlock…" John was sobbing once more, deep gulping gasps racking his body as he bent over under the weight of his grief and regret.
John fell silent again but to Sherlock his silence seemed for the first time since he'd met him to have a meditative element rather than be simply pure, mute grief.
And so the morning had progressed. When John had finally looked at his watch at noon he was able to say to Blackburn warmly and truthfully, “You are out of the woods.” He stroked Blackburn’s forehead approvingly. “You’ve been amazing. But you need to rest now…” and when his patient’s brilliant eyes opened warily, he said, “I’ll be here to make sure nothing goes wrong, so you can sleep safely.” John smiled and nodded understandingly, “I know you’re tired and it’s alright to rest now.” At John’s last words, Blackburn’s eyes slid shut and for the first time that morning, when he went still, it was in deep sleep instead of unconsciousness.
Then John heard Moran say in a false croon, “Too late. I know how to deal with the likes of you!  Open your trousers! Do it, or I’ll slice your throat open, now!”
Neilson’s jaw tightened in annoyance.  “We were having some trouble picking him up. He was onto us. So we hired a merc… er… an outside agent.”
The voice didn’t thaw one bit, but it said, “I agree to your terms. I will be there shortly to pick him up.”
"Mmmm. Yes, a bit too obvious," said Sherlock, "I began to investigate what else all three victims might have had in common. In doing so I searched the names of all the applicants for Reverend positions in all three parishes for the past five years. Father Stansell's was one of about six names that appeared on all three lists. The other priests were easily eliminated as suspects (two have died of old age, one has retired to Switzerland and the other two now work in South Korea and Nigeria respectively), leaving only Father Stansell. His receiving the latest letter and John's account revealing how it was delivered were all I needed to reach a solid conclusion."
But he said nothing other than, “Right then. Well, the place is nice, or, could be nice, with a bit of tidying, so, ah, alright then. Let’s give it a try.”
John must have dozed off close to dawn for his next awareness was of being startled awake by sharp rapping on the outer door of his quarters.
John picked their way back to the entrance following the same path he’d used to enter the bunker. This time he had the light of the open door with which to orient himself, so the going was faster.  He was almost out of the building, just feet from the entrance, when he sensed and heard Moran’s return. He hissed a string of oaths under his breath and flattened himself quickly against the wall just inside the bunker's wide entrance; Sherlock held securely with one arm and his drawn pistol in the other.
John waited five tense minutes before leaning over Blackburn again and re-taking his vital signs. To his consternation, the man’s condition was deteriorating! Christ! He’d have to get Blackburn to a location where he could be properly treated if he was going to have a chance of pulling out of this state. There was no time to lose. His brow furrowed with anxiety, John threw his medical bag back into the car, slid behind the wheel and drove from the car park.
As John watched him, he saw the youth’s mouth tremble slightly and, although it was difficult to say for certain, what he thought were tears on his cheeks.  With a gentle hand, John cupped the omega’s chin and tipped his face up towards his own. “You must be a very special person to have survived such a traumatic event and traveled so far from your home,” he smiled and stroked a tear away with his thumb. “What is your name?”
Then, mindful of John's silent warning, he said nothing else, instead settling for fixing Doris with a flinty stare. The scream quickly subsided under Sherlock's reassurance, but muffled sobbing could be heard; which for John and evidently for Sherlock as well, was just as heart-wrenching as the scream for they both remained quite pale.
Something wasn't right...as John held him, rather than relaxing, Sherlock's body stiffened and his emotions began to tear at him again.  He curled into a ball in John’s lap and sobbed. “I don’t feel well. It aches, John, I’m empty and alone…Please help me!”
John, by now focusing his attention lower, paused in his careful rinsing of Sherlock’s small feet and complicated toes to ask, “Do I seem to you like a man who prefers to avoid danger, liefling?”
It was at this point that John moved. He stepped forward from the shadows to assist Lestrade, disregarding that he was revealing himself in the moonlight. The man struggling with Lestrade, for it was now clear that it was a man, just then succeeded in getting the gun. When he saw John, he raised it with deadly purpose and prepared to fire it.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow at John. He wore what John was coming to realize was his usual brash expression, but John could see from the pallor of his skin and the weakness in his posture that his prisoner was still far from well.
John grinned back and rose from the edge of the sofa. Still holding Sherlock’s hands, he tugged him up and growled, “Then get! Into bed now!”
When he reached them, she said without actually looking at Sherlock, "Thank you sir, both of you, for assisting the child, not everyone is so responsible. Now if you'd like to just hand him to me, I'll take him into care."
John heard the sounds of a slight struggle which ended with a sharp abbreviated cry followed by a scream so loud it rattled the galvanized metal walls and ceiling of the bunker. This was followed by agonized gasps and tortured choking from the Sergeant and what sounded like a derisive snort from Moran.
Once more helpless and heartsick, Sherlock could only hold and try to comfort John while he fought his way back to the present from reliving the anguish of losing his baby. John seemed to take comfort from Sherlock's hold; he pressed his face into Sherlock's bare shoulder as if trying to absorb his strength and struggled to control his breathing. Sherlock tried to help by stroking his back and murmuring comfort into his ear.
Captain John Watson heard the rough order and a scuffle outside his tent followed by a grunt, the sort emitted when someone is struck with a kick or a punch, followed by a derisive laugh.
He rapped on the door of the loo and called, “Alright in there?”  When he received no answer he turned the door knob and put his head around the door.  Sherlock was standing upright, but clutching the basin for support with one hand, his grubby shirt dangling from the other.  A broken china toothbrush stand and toothbrushes lay scattered on the tiled floor.
Now would be the best time for John himself to rest so he settled in the chair across from his patient and closed his eyes.  John knew sleep was unlikely, it was difficult for him to sleep at the best of times, and stranded, mid-job with an ill hostage, off-course and overdue, was hardly the best of times.
John reached the entrance of his tent in a few short seconds, halting silently alongside the door, taking up a stealth position with gun raised, listening – and scenting.  If Moran was inside and near Sherlock, he was about to die. John’s focus had narrowed to one deadly objective; neutralize the threat to his omega.
Sherlock shook his head.  “Nō,” he whispered huskily.  “But so strong…” he lifted frightened eyes to John’s, “What will I do?”
There was a thoughtful silence from December following this remark, before he said sadly, "I'm not lucky, I don't have any friends."
He climbed out of bed and, not stopping to put his T shirt on, he went straight to the kitchen. He almost wilted with relief to see Sherlock making tea. He had had an irrational fear that he wouldn't be, that fate would once again tear them apart just as they were on the verge of finding each other, as it had once before...
The smile was accompanied by a proud, "He's like me John. He prefers motion to stillness. You see? He's sleeping easily now."
John patted the sofa beside him. “C’mere Sherlock. Sit beside me. Bring your book and we’ll just sit together. It makes me happy when you’re near me.”
Sherlock was surprised but relieved to learn that John had apparently agreed. He hadn't wanted to resort to subterfuge to get to John although it would have been easy enough. Even if lives were at stake, the idea of deceiving John, who had obviously been shown little respect in his life, felt wrong.
Moran, having found nothing in the sergeant’s quarters was now alert to the possibility of an interloper having stolen Sherlock, and both scented and heard John at the same time.  He pulled his gun and halted abruptly, trying to discern their exact location in the bunker.  After several seconds, he took a few stealthy steps closer.  He likely believed he had the advantage of surprise on his side and he was eager to recapture Sherlock.
Not the long chapter I promised.  But next week's is the longer one.  To be posted on Tuesday Dec 27.
He reached for his prisoner’s pulse and found it weak and slow. John cursed again. He would have to stop somewhere and properly examine Blackburn. That Blackburn was faking unconsciousness was out of the question. Obviously, he was intelligent and skilled at escaping captivity, given his demonstration earlier, but no one could fake the heart rate or pallor and shallow breathing that John was observing.
“Sherlock! What’s wrong?” There were no more sounds from the room although he thought he could detect ragged breathing.
John was still humming when he met Sherlock at the door to see him off. John wasn't working that day and seeing him now, wrapped in his robe, his hair adorably askew, Sherlock very much wished he could stay home too but a case beckoned…He would come for lunch most definitely though.
Sherlock nodded. “Pæt ælfcynn are our allies. We are the guardians of the lakes and the Dúnælf are our guardians.  It is a cooperative arrangement.  We are few in number and must devote the majority of our time to science; the lakes are fragile and require constant monitoring.  We have a skilled defence force, the Dúnælf train them, but it is a small group. The Dúnælf stand with us when needed. They are fierce fighters; like you Ælfric, although not so strong.” Sherlock reached with a shy hand to touch one of John’s muscular arms.
Sherlock moved to the living room to take up his violin. He began to play softly while watching a peach and rose-pink sunrise steal over the city. He had always had the sense that there was something more for him in the universe than his work, but he hadn’t known where to look for it and so had given up hope of ever attaining it. He knew now it was love that he had been seeking, of course. And love had unexpectedly revealed itself in John and the intense joy of caring for, protecting and nurturing another. John was the difference between a world of dull grey and a world of flowing colour. And now Sherlock had had a glimpse of colour he would always yearn for it. Yearn for John.
After a long look, Sherlock broke into a happy smile and began to plant excited kisses on John's face interspersed with eager exclamations of, "Yes! Yes, John. And soon, is that alright?"
John began to awaken. In the darkness of Sherlock’s bedroom, lying snug against Sherlock’s back, holding him close, John floated in that timeless space between sleeping and waking. Whatever it was that had alerted him wasn’t bad. It was good, so good! His world was perfect…he was happy and excited… Ah. That kind of excited.
And so they stayed for some time, lost in one another, in the softly shadowed entryway of the cathedral, secluded from the open nave and intimate for being so; the ideal place for glorious first kisses and whispers of new love.
Now finally, the church almost empty of others, John saw Sherlock approaching him and all but glowed; radiant with happiness that Sherlock was unharmed and as confident and commanding as ever, if not more so due to his satisfaction at having solved a difficult case. Sherlock, his eyes on John's face couldn't reach him fast enough; his long legs gracefully vaulting three chairs in succession on his way to where John was sitting. From there it was difficult to say the order of things, but arms reached to hold, eyes met and then slid closed as eager mouths found and clung to one another. There were two blissful moans, one deep and resounding in the now empty church and the other a little higher, a light sound of pure joy.
Even as he growled this order, John turned to the door and reached behind to pull the automatic pistol from his belt, from where he’d placed it the previous night upon learning some of the details of Sherlock’s circumstances. Glancing back to ensure Sherlock had obeyed him and was motionless and low on the couch cushions, John moved to position himself along one wall of the hallway leading to the door and called, “Hang on, hang on! I’m coming.” He then darted silently across the hall to wedge in adjacent to the handle side of the closed door. He reached carefully to turn the door handle; touching it with a slight rattle and as he did so, without notice, two gun shots were fired through the door, at man height, and it was shoved violently open.
“Yes, of course you do,” John had agreed easily as he propped his patient up into a position where he would find breathing easier.
Meeting her eyes in silent gratitude, John accepted the baby, drawing him close with a deep sigh before dropping his eyes to gaze downward.
He stopped to let the idea sink in before continuing, “Frankly, Mycroft is not my concern, like I say; he’s a grown man who refuses to take responsibility for the harm he causes.  But I do want you to be free of him, out of his control, and understanding the fear that drives his behaviour might help you.  My second idea is that for now, would you like me to speak to him? To request on your behalf that he stay away from us for an indefinite period of time? If I approach him, I think he will listen to me, Sherlock.”
Lestrade's mouth fell open once more in shock. However, before he could recover himself to speak, the social worker answered John, "No, I'm afraid that's not possible.” She gestured and added vaguely, "There are rules. He will have to come with me now, but don't worry he will receive the best of care."
“Hush!” John exclaimed, regretting his impulsive words.  His voice full of concern, he explained, “It is the way of trauma; pain catches us when we least expect it.”  He sat up and drew Sherlock onto his lap, sleeping bag and all.  “Would you like to tell me what happened? How you came to be separated from your people?” He nuzzled the top of Sherlock’s head with his lips.  “You will find that I am a good listener.”
John fluffed a sofa cushion aggressively. So his Alpha senses were a little off. He already knew that, that’s why he was making an effort again, trying to regain some of his former prowess. And he would have caught-on, before long, as to just what Liz had been up to. For heaven’s sake that was why he had been sitting in the living room chatting with her and not upstairs in his room, fucking the daylights out of her! Not that he would have been able to figure out about her girlfriend. He grudgingly admitted that he had Sherlock to thank for that. He had no wish to tangle with a jealous dom. He punched another cushion into shape with more force than necessary. He wanted a family, he always had, and he wasn’t getting any younger.
He enfolded John in a tender hug, being careful not to squeeze him too hard and murmured in his ear, "Home early? Dinner? May I feed you and the babies some of your favourite wontons?"
He locked both arms tightly around Sherlock and laid his cheek against Sherlock’s back and began to thrust into him. The sensation was bliss beyond anything John could have imagined! Even sexually experienced as he was, he had never felt the level of physical and emotional arousal that he felt now. Too late, he realized that he was utterly unprepared for it; a fierce instinct to dominate and subdue his Omega absolutely, was swamping him.  He tried to fight it but he was already lost, helpless against the powerful drive to claim Sherlock. He gritted his teeth with the effort to stop before he hurt Sherlock or frightened him, but his body disobeyed him and he continued to push into Sherlock, hardly withdrawing before surging against him again.
Dragging his attention back to Lestrade, Sherlock said shortly, "Well, I should have thought it was obvious but of course not to the lot you work with." His look dared Lestrade to contradict him but Lestrade patiently did not, so he continued, "You've got three murdered priests; each of whom received a threatening letter shortly before their deaths. The victims held the parishes of St. Joseph's, St. Agnes and St. Alphonsus. And by-the-way, a bishop at Westminster Cathedral is the most likely next victim unless your force can get themselves organised enough for once to prevent a crime."
John stared at him for a moment and then smiled. He squeezed Sherlock's hand and smiled wider when Sherlock responded in kind. And to Sherlock it was as though the sun was suddenly shining on Baker Street even though the January night outside was rainy and dark.
Thank you all so much for reading and a special thank you for letting me know what you thought of the story. And thank you anonymous prompter for such a touching and sweet concept.  There is never too much love!
Lestrade grasped his hand and quickly assessed him…hmmmm, a courageous man but gentle, not a murderer even if his ex-husband by most accounts might have merited it.
John halted and drew a sharp breath but ignored the insults. He demanded, “Why the hell didn’t your handler pull you before last night?! QAT was right behind me.  And you knew it.  That’s why you came with me without a fight.  Even unknown, I was a better option!”
“Fótwærc… níedhelp?” John struggled for the words. Sherlock might not be fluent in modern English, but his knowledge of Old English was far superior to John’s.
Never mind that, it was irrelevant now.  He would track their scent, they couldn’t have gotten far. He’d find them.
Sherlock closed his eyes and parted his lips involuntarily in response to John’s touch but he continued his story, “I usually work alone, although the council does not always approve. I prefer it,” he said. “The first two days went well; the water and the atmosphere were clear, but at dawn on the third day something went wrong. A mist emerged from the lake such as I’d never seen before. At first of course, I did not know what was happening. But observing the signs at the water’s edge, within a short time, I knew the only explanation was that the lake was disappearing, and therefore something terrible must have happened.” Sherlock’s words faltered. “I returned to the city as quickly as I could.  But by the time I drew near my home the mist and the lake along with it had gone… The city was in ruin, there wasn’t a living person remaining… my parents, the council, all were dead…” Sherlock wilted in John’s arms, overwhelmed with grief and sobbed.
Before John could question why he was there, the man, whose badge indicated he was a sergeant, spoke, his voice surly, “We found this pretty piece on patrol.  The Major said to give it to you.  It’s a reward, for saving his butt-boy, Matheson. Moran always liked a bit of fun.  Major reckoned you’d be the same. If you can make him sing, so much the better.” With that he raised an arm, lifting a small figure by the back of the neck, displaying it to John and grinning unpleasantly with blackened teeth.
There was what could only be described as a taken aback silence on the other end of the line. But it was only momentary; the remote drawl sounded again, “How very singular of you, Captain. Why, may I ask, should I?”
"John, my name is Sherlock Holmes and I am a consulting detective, at present investigating the so-called chapel murders. I would like to hear about what happened in the church yesterday, when you feel well enough to tell me."
That was a mistake; for even before he’d finished his sentence the intruder found himself bowed backward, almost off his feet, caught in a punishing arm lock with a furious John hissing in his ear, “That’s right. I’m a doctor,” John deliberately wrenched the man’s arm up his back causing him to squeal in pain, “… and that means I have a lot of latitude in how I exercise my duty.  And right now I see you as a direct threat to my patient.” He wrenched the arm up once more and growled, “I will kill you if you aren’t out of my sight within three seconds!” John dragged the man backward to the entrance of his tent and flung him to the ground outside. He then pulled his sidearm from its holster, he was never without it, and took aim at the man’s crotch − a clear shot as the soldier was on his back with his legs splayed − and began to count aloud, “Three, two, on…”
He loped back to their car and, reversing it up the road, parked it in the nearest farm lane, well out of view. He then snapped the number plates off, shouldered his duffle and returned to the Mercedes and Sherlock. He tossed it all into the back seat, but not before he’d pulled rapstraps from the duffle with which to restrain the two agents. Seconds later they had been dragged, still unconscious, into the ditch and John was sliding into the driver’s seat of their vehicle beside Sherlock.
Sherlock groaned in frustration and turned away, bringing his knees to his chest in a tight clench. “Why not, John?!” he begged, “What is wrong with now?!”
He felt concern at John's obvious over-anxiousness to please, knowing that it almost certainly sprang from a profound fear of conflict. He was well aware of the psychological impact that years of abuse had on victims and wondered if Sherlock was up to dealing with John's complicated emotional needs. The Sherlock he knew rarely questioned himself and was not tolerant of hesitancy and insecurity in others. Watching the two of them together now though − seeing Sherlock's light touch to John's hand, intended to reassure but unnoticeable unless one was looking for it − Lestrade realized to his surprise that Sherlock was very attuned to John's feelings and what's more, comfortable with providing the emotional support John needed.
"Yes, John," Sherlock sounded somewhat dazed, which was to be expected, but also tender and loving. "Yes, John. I am very happy."
After a quiet lunch, and approximately three hours after John had presented Sherlock with his cup of tea, the door of the flat swung open and Lestrade walked in unannounced. To be fair, this was in his usual manner, much in the same way that Sherlock would walk into Lestrade's office uninvited and at will. But John, reading his book on the sofa, was unaccustomed to this ritual and started violently at the sudden appearance and scent of a strange Alpha; a small sound of panic issued from his throat and he sought for escape, his eyes darting frantically to the staircase behind Lestrade.
The next time John awoke, he was alone in Sherlock’s bed and rare London sunshine was streaming through the open curtains of the bedroom. John looked at the window in surprise; he hadn’t realized that Sherlock had a window in his room. Any time John had glimpsed Sherlock’s bedroom previously, it had been dim, if not actually dark. He looked around with interest. It was startlingly neat in contrast to the comfortable shambles in the living room and kitchen of the flat. Sherlock’s collections of bones, seeds and what-not were orderly displayed in the bookcase or framed and mounted on the walls. His silk dressing gowns, John grinned, were hung in order of preference with his best blue striped one first in the row. There were a few photographs too, head-shots of someone…John stared. Sherlock had several pictures of John himself spaced out around the room, one on his desk, two in the bookcase and one hanging on the wall behind the door-where one could see it when the door was closed. The one on the desk dated back to the first month they’d met; it was cut from a press-shot taken the day of the news conference following the shooting of the murderous cabbie; John remembered it as being the first time he’d seen himself appear in a newspaper.
Sherlock didn’t respond. He was staring at John with an oddly perplexed expression pulling at the muscles of his face. It was as though his facial muscles were so unused to forming themselves into that particular expression of puzzlement that they didn’t know how to do it and had commenced fighting with one another over it.
"What?" asked John and Sherlock in unison. December took no notice of this confusion; it was part of the daily ritual. He continued with eager excitement, "I got a 'B+' on my science test!"
John, even the hardened soldier that he was, was unprepared for the nausea he felt rising as he listened to Sherlock’s emotionless tones.
John collapsed sobbing again, but Sherlock could make out his words, "He knows where Geoffrey is." John hugged his body, "Sherlock, I want Geoffrey, he needs me, please help me find him, please…"
Sherlock who had been engrossed in his laptop, leapt up as if electrified, a vicious snarl erupting from his throat and confronted Lestrade who quickly raised his hands in a placating gesture and backed up toward the door, stunned surprise written on his face.
The camp was silent.  It hadn’t been a sound that disturbed him… but John was alert, awoken by something. Then he felt it, a soft brushing against his cheek… he opened his eyes in the semi-darkness to find Sherlock’s face near his own, his expression a study in fascination as he stroked his long fingers lightly over the beard growth on John’s chin.
John hesitated, unsure of the limits of his self-control. He’d never been tested to this extent before. But he sat down beside Sherlock on the bed and heard himself say, “Yes, of course if you want me to.”
At John's enthusiastic nod, he dropped his head to the crook of John's neck and began to laugh, part in giddy joy and part in real mirth.
Sherlock was sincere in his declaration to John. He meant what he had said whole-heartedly; relieved, in fact, that John trusted him enough to stay. Having said that…something was not adding-up. Not that Sherlock was an expert on sex, by any stretch of the imagination, but he was sure that John was physically responsive to him…he thought back to their first kiss in the church and smiled. Yes, John had definitely been sexually aroused then. So Sherlock resolved to give the matter serious thought.
Lestrade and his team had spent the last three hours searching for information on Harvey Smith in all the databases at their disposal, of which there were many. A great deal of unpleasant information about the man had emerged. Although Harvey had never been arrested or charged with an offence, he was the subject of a number of criminal incident reports (including several for partner assault and battery) in Birmingham, Coventry, Bristol and Leeds; his last four cities of residence. In addition, MI6 was very interested in his role as manager of several of his father's lucrative security contracts with some very unsavoury foreign dictators. It seemed that both his and his father's arrests for violations of international law and security sanctions had been imminent.
John continued as though Blackburn hadn’t spoken, “And when you have had some soup and a roll, you may have this.”  He placed a single cigarette on the lamp table beside the couch. “Nicotine withdrawal symptoms will put too great of a strain on your system at right now, otherwise I would insist you go without,” he said, by way of an explanation.
“No! God no!” John leaned forward to grip his hands, “That isn’t what I meant at all! I love you very much Sherlock, more than ever, and make no mistake, I want you, badly!” He explained urgently, “It’s just that I think you need some time to figure things out, to get used to how things are different for you now. People often change their minds about important things during a personal crisis−”
He then grasped both of John’s hands in his and said, “John, I have something to ask you.  I don’t expect you to answer right away but it would make me very happy if you would consider it…”
With that, Sherlock rose and strode furiously from the kitchen and down the hall into his bedroom and slammed the door, leaving a surprised John staring after him, holding an ice-pack and a blood-stained flannel.
Sherlock hummed in agreement and settled his head on his pillow. There was peaceful silence for a long moment before John broke it by murmuring, “I have another idea Sherlock…”
"We arranged a time to meet in the afternoon but then a case-meeting came up so I wasn't going to be able to make it. I couldn't reach him on his mobile so on the off-chance he might be at the church, I stopped by at lunchtime to let him know. When I arrived, the church was empty as far as I could tell; I stood in the foyer for a few moments before deciding that I would leave a note for him."
Sherlock nodded reluctantly.  “And I do not know why I need you.  I should not.” He sounded miserably confused.
John was up early the next morning. He beat Sherlock to the kitchen once more and by the time Sherlock arrived fresh from a shower, John had prepared a mushroom omelette, toast and a pot of tea for them. Sherlock sniffed the kitchen appreciatively and saw with approval that John was wearing new trousers, a red check shirt and the deep-green cashmere jumper that Sherlock had purchased for him (Sherlock had hoped that John wouldn't necessarily recognize the wool as cashmere as it might seem extravagant, but it had been unusually soft and thick and he very much wanted John to be warm and comfortable …). Now seeing him, Sherlock congratulated himself on his wardrobe choices; the warm tones brought some slight colour to John's cheeks and highlighted his attractive sandy hair while the style lent him a quiet sort of dignity that was just right for John.
His tone then turned from dismissive to deadly, "The murderer will not find John to be such an easy target."
John looked away and then back. He said hesitantly, “Sherlock, it’s because I don’t know...” He halted, “I mean I want you to bond with me not because your body is driving you to do it, although I enjoy the knowledge of that very much, and not because you are afraid and want protection from other Alphas. I am willing to protect you always, regardless of whether we are mated or not. What I want is for you to be with me just because you love me, Sherlock. I hoped that when you were comfortable with your new identity you might start to sort those things out…”
Blackburn raised his head.  “Call me mad but I think a strong opiate is in order when one is about to be carved to pieces with a scimitar before the night is out. However, what do I know? I’m not a doctor.” He glared pointedly at John.
John assessed the situation; he wanted no part of what was being suggested of course, he was an honourable soldier and a medical doctor, but he would have to accept the sergeant’s proposition if he was going to be able to assist the poor creature being dangled in front of him.
Reynolds looked up at him in surprise. “He came in an hour ago, on the supply flight.  We need a resident surgeon and we can’t wait forever for headquarters to send us one.  I’ve hired him on contract; a neat solution to my problems, Captain.”
“Shut up,” ordered John harshly, unable to keep the venom he felt toward Blackburn out of his voice. He hadn’t intended to speak to Blackburn, there was no need to, but something about the man was irritating to John in the extreme. John tried to refocus. It was Blackburn’s bloody arrogance that rankled so much. But this was a job, nothing else. Personal animosity had no place in this type of work. John knew very well that emotions of any sort only clouded one’s judgement and created risk.
At Sherlock's brief nod, brief because the bodyguard's hand was still pressed firmly against his throat, the doctor motioned for everyone else to leave the room.
John faltered, “I...I know I’m thinking farther ahead than you have probably, but…but…that’s the way I am, I guess, I…I’m sort of old-fashioned…”
He carefully eased the sheet down between them, trying to move as little as possible so as not to disturb Sherlock. As he withdrew his arm from around Sherlock’s middle to bundle the sheet between them, two things happened; to his surprise he encountered Sherlock’s cock, stiff and thick, laying against his belly and, as John unintentionally brushed it with his forearm, he heard a breathy moan of “John…” come from Sherlock’s lips. And by God if that didn’t do something for John!…although what it did was not very helpful at that moment.
I want to acknowledge and express a grateful Thank You to Ariane DeVere for the absolutely fantastic work she has done transcribing episodes of BBC Sherlock.  It is from her work that I recovered the name of "Neilson" the CIA agent who hits Mrs. Hudson and who Sherlock consequently tosses out the window of 221b onto the dust bins more times than he can remember in "A Scandel in Belgravia".
John was back to the vehicle in seconds, holding the key he’d retrieved from under the potted geranium on the front step of the cottage.
John pressed anxious kisses to Sherlock’s eyes before cupping his face in his hands with infinite gentleness, “I know you don’t, and that’s partly why...I’m…holding back, Sherlock. Before we can be together, we need to understand each other better. What’s between us has to be about more than just a desire for hot sex. Understanding and partnership take time to develop.”
John's eyes widened and his voice was a ghost of a whisper, "Do you know where his is? What happened to him Sherlock? Even if they put him in the…if they didn't save his body…I want to know. I just need to know, Sherlock."
“In a relationship, I mean when…people…are dating… how important do you think sex is? Is it the…most important thing for…people, would you say?”
Sherlock was indignant. “I do not snore−” he began, before adding “Oh, you’re teasing me again aren’t you, John?”
The cab took them down Victoria Street where, across Cathedral Piazza, the massive church dominated the square. Its walls were deep in shadow but its looming 210 foot bell tower and the upper reaches of its Byzantine brick and stonework were illuminated, adding to its imposing presence. Sherlock waited until they were past the square before instructing the cabbie to let them off at Ashley Place. Well out of sight of the church, concealed in a stand of Plane trees−stark in mid-winter; they set off back toward the church, their shadows indistinguishable from those cast by the branches above.
John applied everything he had to keeping his patient alive.  The Flumazenil had to be re-administered hourly until Blackburn’s condition was stable and his breathing had to be monitored continuously. It would prevent any further depression of his central nervous system, but respiratory failure was still a great risk. He was barely breathing on his own; he managed it only with assistance from John who, each time Blackburn began to choke, which was often, adjusted Blackburn’s position to clear his airways.
Sherlock spent a fruitful morning in Lestrade's office, ignoring the DI's grumbling about compromised passwords and security clearance infractions. It was absorbing work, he loved to be on the trail of a killer but he surprised himself with his eagerness to return to Baker Street and John. He was simply worried about John's welfare he told himself, which was perfectly natural under the circumstances…never mind that what he actually found himself thinking about was John's illuminating smile at dinner the night before and how wonderful it felt to know that he, Sherlock, had been the one responsible for it.
He gazed down at John trying to make sense of his new discovery. His world now seemed to begin and end with John…what was it that used to be the centre of his world? His work? Himself? He couldn't remember.
As he was assessing the surroundings with single-minded determination, he suddenly became aware that Sherlock had started to strategize to save himself. He would have known he was being hunted; as his panic receded, his Omega instinct would have told him that. And he was now trying to turn around and go back to the flat. And what’s more, Sherlock knew that John was coming for him. John wasn’t sure how he, himself, knew this, but he didn’t question it, he simply rejoiced; Sherlock was beginning to trust himself and let his instinct guide him. He was starting to function as one-half of a whole; he and his other half, his Alpha, John.
Sherlock helped John unfasten the trousers.  God, that fabric really is wonderful thought John absently as he folded them carefully and placed them with the shirt.  The silk boxers followed but were not so neatly folded as John, emotionally overcome with admiration and love at the sight of Sherlock naked before him, suddenly pulled Sherlock firmly against him, head to toe, in a full body hug.  He groaned in bliss at the sensation.  Sherlock was breathing shakily and hugging him back and for John it was as though the gates of heaven itself had opened; never had he dreamed that he’d one day be doing this with Sherlock!
John spoke in a rush, “Are you sure you don’t want me, Sherlock? I know Gaia Omega are weak and needy and not suited to your lifestyle but I can adapt, I can be self-sufficient and a good mate. I will do whatever you want if you let me stay…please...” he was looking at the floor and speaking in a whisper.
Either one or both of them would have walked him home from school except that Mrs. Hudson frequently insisted that she be the one to meet him "…because I hardly get to see the dear boy otherwise..."
“Okay then.” He gave Sherlock another squeeze.  “Now, how about bed?  You seem tired.  A cup of tea and to sleep?”
Blackburn opened his eyes again to stare at John.  He said, “You’re a doctor.  A military doctor...” Then, in alarm he said, “Stay away from Moriarty. He’s mad!” He fought to rise. “He’ll kill you!”
December nodded and beamed. A smile as bright as his eyes thought John, even through the layers of dirt.
“Perhaps you’re right John, and your indignation on my behalf is touching, really it is.” He raised the mocking eyebrow again, “But it’s long in the past now. I am happy with my work; and I would be unable to do it if I had the burden of dealing with hormones and heats etcetera. I no longer think or worry about my body, I haven’t done so for years and I like it that way.”
"And don't try to turn away! You'll listen to everything I have to say to you unless you want me to break your sodding neck!"
"No worries, just next time I decide to visit you; I don't expect you to bite my head off, okay? He is pretty special alright, but it's obvious he's completely gone on you, you know."
“May I take you clothes off?” Sherlock’s voice was gravel, low and husky, and John felt the vibration of it all the way down to his toes. He nodded abruptly, unable to find his voice, and began to help Sherlock pull his T-shirt over his head.
Sherlock had not let John out of his range-of-sight for a second while the obligatory police work was being completed. John sat quietly in the cathedral's narthex with a shock blanket wrapped around him; insistently put over his shoulders by Sherlock.
“The reason is you, John. I was waiting for you, although I didn’t know it at the time. I’ve been waiting for you for 25 years, John. And now that you’ve arrived and I’m ready for you I just don’t see any reason to continue waiting.”
A couple of hours later, John was stirring tinned soup on the cooker when Sherlock appeared in the doorway of the kitchen.  Clean, dark curls gleaming and dressed in his expensive suiting, he presented the very picture of elegance and careless ease.  John, confronted with this vision of astonishing good looks and poise, found to his internal dismay, his breath hitching slightly and the tingling physical awareness he’d felt earlier, return full force.  God damn it! What the hell was wrong with him?! For one thing, Sherlock was a patient and for another, he was a man, for God’s sake!
Holmes led the way, stopping momentarily to snatch up a selection of evening newspapers from grimy hands. Then the pair of them, holding on to their silk hats against the crush, forced their way through to the curb and navigated the short distance to the restaurant, gratefully entering through etched-glass doors into an oasis of potted palms and marble columns, ordered, calm, genteel murmurings, and starched white napery.
Having more pressing matters on his mind at that time, it was not until a number of months had passed and Mr. Jones once again had occasion to rummage through the contents of the safe, that the presence of the portfolio (and the Armagnac) came to mind. The temptation to open both came upon him, the portfolio because he was curious, the Armagnac because it had been a particularly arduous day. But one just doesn’t break the seals of a bottle of old and rare brandy on a whim or without proper occasion, especially since it had remained undisturbed in its sanctuary for how many years? Its very presence, though known to few, had become as much a part of Claridge’s as the marble and mahogany and gleaming brass of the public rooms, and though there was little likelihood of a rightful owner returning to reclaim it, or of some hidebound traditionalist writing an indignant letter to
The sky had brightened considerably in the meantime, but still the day promised to be a drizzly-gray one. Visibility was such that it was just possible to make out distinctive features of the buildings they hurried past. Holmes leaned forward expectantly in his seat, peering onward.
“In the meantime, I shall hold on to this for the moment, if I may,” Holmes said, tucking the cigarette carefully into an envelope he had taken from his pocket, and then into his wallet. “I believe it may have even more to tell us once I have had the opportunity to examine it at greater length and submit it to chemical analysis.”
“That’s from Abberline,” snapped Holmes, gesturing to the crumpled message in Watson’s hand. Once again he called up to the driver, “Faster, man! Can’t you go faster!”
Holmes looked up sharply. “A quarter past five?” he asked. “You say he was certain of that — most precise?”
“Yes, it was he who suggested that I come to you. You are known to me by reputation, of course — the assistance you have rendered to the Yard in the past is well known to us all, as is the fact that your unofficial status and your — shall we say, um, unorthodox methods — can sometimes bring about more satisfactory results than we in an official capacity can achieve.”
Holmes and Watson elbowed their way through the crowd with increasing difficulty, conversation made impossible by the press and clamor around them.
Watson returned his gaze. “A kidney has been removed, and the uterus as well, and I don’t know what else: We will have to wait for a proper autopsy. Holmes, I tell you, I don’t know what to make of this; I have never seen anything like it.”
Thicke said. “Lambeth Workhouse markings. The only personal articles found in her possession were a broken comb and a piece of broken looking-glass. She hadn’t a farthing to her name.”
“Really, Holmes, you exaggerate,” Watson replied defensively. He was both hurt by Holmes’s sarcastic rebuke and just a little annoyed.
It was almost dawn before Watson and Holmes returned to Baker Street. Both were tired and somewhat disheveled from their labors, the distinctive mud of Spitalfields now caking their shoes and trouser bottoms.
“Well, never mind,” he said quietly, feigning a nonchalance he did not feel. He looked over his shoulder at Holmes with a puckish little smile. “I mean, after all, it’s not as if you refused me the name of your tailor.”
“H’ats ryght. Lyke the kynd youse and the doctor ‘as on,” he said, pointing to the high starched collar that Holmes was wearing. “But unusua’wy ‘eigher, lyke ‘e ‘ad a wery long neck.”
Holmes threw back his head and laughed. “But it is so very simple. As I have told you often enough, one has only to take note of the basic facts. For example, a mere glance will tell you that this particular couple is not only wealthy, but extremely wealthy. Their haughty demeanor, the quality of their clothes, the young lady’s jewelry, and the gentleman’s rather large diamond ring on the little finger of his left hand would suffice to tell you that. The ring also identifies our man as American: A ‘pinky ring,’ I believe it is called. What Englishman of breeding would ever think of wearing one of those?”
Holmes interrupted: “You speak of the murders of that Emma Smith woman last Easter Monday and, what was her name, Turner or Tabram, who was found a fortnight ago with, how many? — thirty-nine stab wounds?”
“Come, Watson,” said Holmes, “I think a visit to Clarences would do us both a world of good, and then perhaps a soothing steam at Faulkners, if that meets with your approval. What say you, eh?”
“Oh, no great mystery, really. The man’s suit of clothes is obviously Savile Row from the cut; custom made from good English cloth. It is not new. Ergo, he has visited our blessed plot before, at least once and for a long enough stay to have at least one suit, probably three or four, made to measure.”
Watson gasped and would have laughed outright had not something in Abberline’s demeanor — a look of apprehension, perhaps — brought him up short.
“Perhaps, Inspector, I can prevail upon you to begin at the beginning,” he said softly, enunciating each word with great care. “Leave nothing out, I implore you.”
“The handkerchief? That’s Inspector Chandler’s. He was first on the scene.” Abberline went over and carefully lifted a corner of the handkerchief. Beneath it, neatly laid out in a row, as if part of an elaborate ritual, were two brass rings, a few pennies, and a couple of farthings. “Hers, probably,” he said. “The rings were apparently wrenched from her fingers, the coins taken from her pockets. Chandler left them just as he found them.”
Warren nodded. “You do that! And let me tell you, sir, that I concur wholeheartedly with my officer! He acted quite correctly, quite correctly indeed. This is no business for amateurs, and certainly no business of yours, and I’ll thank you to keep your nose out of it. And one thing more, sir. Should you ever meddle in police business again, I shall have you taken in charge. Taken in charge, sir! Count on it!”
Watson went there at once, where he retrieved the note Holmes had left for him. It took a moment to decipher the hurried scrawl:
“My dear Inspector Abberline, my method is based upon the examination of such trifles. It has long been an axiom of mine that it’s the little things that are infinitely the most important. Whatever this ‘trifle’ may or may not tell you, it tells me volumes. It tells me that the man who smoked it is someone of substance, a gentleman of refined tastes with the wherewithal to indulge them. It tells me that he was present at this location less than twenty-four hours ago, probably less than twelve. It tells me he was in somewhat of a hurry, for he took only two or three puffs. And that he tarried at all to do even that tells me that he is addicted to tobacco and is no doubt a heavy smoker. I would venture to say that he knows the district well and is no stranger to it, otherwise it is unlikely he would have found his way to this particular doorway off this particular street by sheer happenstance. It is, you will agree, a rather unsavory address and a good bit off the beaten path. Shall I continue?”
The leather portfolio was more easily explained. It had been left in the care of Claridge’s management by a gentleman who had been a permanent resident for as long as even the oldest staff member could recall. He was a retired surgeon by the name of Anstruther who, being a childless widower and the last of his line, had no family, and being quite elderly, had outlived all of his friends and contemporaries.
Watson bestirred himself and crossed over to the tantalus and gasogene as Holmes made for his room, removing his suit coat.
, yet little had changed for the better, and not even someone with his powers of description could prepare the unwary for the worst of it. Spitalfields was a place that penetrated the soul with feelings of repulsion and dread.
He smiled. “Merely a harmless eccentric, I believe. But I am not alone in my views. Many of your methods are winning growing acceptance by my colleagues, among them Inspector Abberline here. Oh, we are scoffed at by some of the older chaps, the so-called graybeards, who have little patience with scientific detection. But the younger ones that are coming into the department now are more open to new ideas, so please, Mr. Holmes, don’t tar all of us with the same brush.”
Once he and Watson had been relieved of their hats and sticks and provided with mugs of tepid tea, Holmes lost no time in getting to the business at hand.
Chandler agreed. “That’s my guess. Yet our men haven’t been able to find anyone who saw a stranger about. Of course it was very early in the morning and still was dark, and most people would have been in their beds.”
Dark Annie was not alone when this fellow, Dick, claimed to have seen her. She was with another man, a “mark” whom she had apparently just encountered in the street, for they appeared to be haggling over price as Dick approached. He said he overheard the man ask her, “Will you?” and she replied, “Yes.”
“As far as we can tell,” said Abberline, “it had no connection with the murderer. It was the woman’s apparently. She probably picked it out of a dustbin somewhere and used it to wrap some tablets in, some medication she picked up at the clinic. We’ve established she appeared there the previous day complaining of feeling ill.”
When he finally did speak some little while later, it was in a quiet, subdued manner, his words hesitant, uncertain — so uncharacteristic of him as to cause Watson to look over in surprise, his attention gained as readily as if Holmes had shouted.
The boy sniffed loudly again. “H’its a foine pickle, Mr. ‘Olmes,” said Wiggins. “The ‘ole of Whitechap’l is in a panic, an’ ‘at’s no lie. Da streets is fairly buzzink w’iv da news of da murder. An’ da stories going about? Yer wouldn’t credit the ‘alf of ‘em, you wouldn’t.”
Watson emerged from his bath wrapped in dressing gown and towel to find Holmes, still occupied with his chemical apparatus, hunched over the cluttered, acid-stained deal table in the corner, test tube poised over Bunsen burner, totally oblivious to the pungent odors issuing forth from his efforts. He had been thus engaged since their return from Whitechapel over an hour earlier, hardly pausing to remove his suit coat, which was still draped untidily over a chair where he had flung it. When Watson returned from dressing ten minutes later Holmes was gone, a thin blue layer of haze the only sign in the room that he had been there at all.
Abberline sat back, his face resuming its anxious expression. “Dr. Watson is, of course, correct. We have spent the better part of the day and evening in the Whitechapel district trying to come up with something — anything at all — that would give us a clue to this heinous crime. I tell you, Mr. Holmes, I have never come up against anything like this before. It’s the most horrible thing I have ever seen. Without doubt, the most horrible, vicious thing.”
Watson looked pained, but he bravely, perhaps foolishly, continued: “You said he was a railroad man. How do you come by that, eh? And your conjecture that he is waiting for an urgent appointment, a business engagement, you said — and with someone beneath his station? How do you arrive at those conclusions?” He snorted. “Admit it, Holmes: pure guesswork, plain and simple!”
“And you, I fear, are beginning to sound like one of those socialist fellows who are always stirring up so much trouble.”
“Holmes!” bellowed Warren again, a spark of recognition appearing in his eyes. He lowered his head menacingly, his mustache quivering. “Not that so-called consulting detective feller, are you?”
Watson stood up and massaged the back of his neck. “There’s not much more I can tell you at this point. As I say, the autopsy may reveal more. But one thing’s for certain — one thing I have no doubt of whatsoever.” He patted his pockets for his cigarette case. “He would seem to have no small degree of anatomical knowledge. He’s no stranger to
“Well, of course we knocked on all the doors facing Buck’s Row and questioned everybody who resides in the vicinity, but most of them were asleep, or so they say, and heard nothing. But you know those people, how suspicious they are of the official police. They’re not likely to share any information with us, even if they did know something.” His voice trailed off. He was noticeably tired and was having difficulty organizing his thoughts.
Abberline was a soft-spoken, portly man with a high brow and heavy whiskers who looked and sounded more like a bank manager or solicitor than a policeman. He favored Watson with a quizzical look.
Abberline looked embarrassed. “Well, of course a search was made the next morning, but nothing was found. As for footprints or suchlike, bless you, Mr. Holmes, but Buck’s Row is paved with cobbles. And the muck in the street, as Dr. Watson has so astutely observed on my boots and trousers, was by then so churned up by so many footprints, it would have been useless, quite useless, to even try to isolate the one pair that might have been of any interest to us.”
It was the higher-ranking Abberline (for his aura of authority was just that much more in evidence) who came forward to shake hands with Watson, while the other man, Thicke, was occupied juggling his teacup, desperately looking for a place to set it down.
Holmes smiled grimly, only the touch of color in his cheeks and the tightening of his jaw revealing his true feelings; Watson stood there sputtering with rage while Abberline, a very pale and visibly shaken Abberline, cast his eyes heavenward and breathed an audible sigh of relief.
Holmes gave him a contemptuous sidelong look. “To the contrary, all too easily. I had only to visit three tobacconists in Belgravia before ascertaining the manufacturer. It was Grover’s, of course.”
Watson sighed, a resigned expression on his face. He smoothed his mustache with his hand, a gesture of exasperation. “And the rest? How did you deduce all of that, dare I ask?”
Holmes cast him a sidelong glance and smiled thinly. “You have far too generous a heart to truly believe that, your Tory soul notwithstanding.”
“Well, one t’ing. ‘Ee sez ‘e caught a flash of da bloke’s collar when ‘e turned lyke. It were funny, ‘e sez, ‘cause it were diff’rent.”
Holmes ignored the sarcasm. “There’s no doubt in my mind about it. Give a young chap like that some decent schooling and he could make his way in the world.”
“I ran an eye over it, but I can’t say it’s been examined closely,” admitted Chandler. “You’ll have noted those bloodstains on the boards just above where she is lying, but there’s nothing else as far as I can tell.”
Watson was startled by Holmes’s response, his curt, even cutting response — and more than a little hurt. It was rare for Holmes to keep anything from him, to deny him at least a civil reply, no matter how delicate the question or ticklish or touchy the matter at hand. But more than that, his remark had been made in such an offhand manner, in a tone so aloof, so patronizing, that had it come from anyone else it would have been grossly insulting. As it was, Watson did take umbrage, did feel some resentment. Color rising in his cheeks, he looked down at his hands to cover his confusion.
Holmes removed his hand from his pocket and held it outstretched, a small, glittering object in his palm. “Popped a button, I think you will find.”
Holmes clapped his hands delightedly and rose from his chair, laughing. “Wiggins, you are a treasure, an absolute treasure! If I had not already invented you, I would have to do so at once. You do me proud!”
Holmes laughed outright. “All right, Wiggins, come in. But next time you must knock, and no excuses. Now, what have you to report?”
Abberline paused to wipe his brow with a handkerchief taken from his sleeve. Holmes and Watson waited expectantly, not making a sound. Only the ticking of the clock could be heard, and the hiss of the gas lamp.
middle class. Watson shot Holmes a sidelong glance to see if he had noticed. He need not have bothered: Holmes’s face was a mask of perfect innocence. There was just the glimmer of a smile, the mere hint of a smile on his thin lips, nothing more.
“Yes, of course. We scoured the area thoroughly,” replied Abberline. “Twice, in point of fact. The lads have even sifted through the rubbish and have searched the alleys and doorways. I can tell you, Mr. Holmes, that except for what is before you, we found nothing — nothing that can be tied to the crime, in any event.”
