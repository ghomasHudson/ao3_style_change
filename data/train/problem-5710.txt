Tony just barely restrained the urge to shove the captain over the side. “
Tony looked helplessly at the hospital bed, Steve standing next to him, staring down the doctor giving him news he didn’t want to hear and refused to believe, as if his refusal to believe would make her
Tony ended up in Steve’s lap as Steve settled himself against the wall with Tony’s chair level to his shoulder.
“Is it because of this?” Steve asked, motioning in between them. “You don’t want anyone else to suspect? Or you can only handle touching me when you’re pissed off?”
No less happy to be flying through the air, Clint put the wind to his back and ran full-tilt with it pushing him along. He just barely made it over the larger pool, and then caught a lamp-post to change his direction. Tony managed a smile and with his rolling eyes, and turned his attention back to Steve. He had both feet firmly planted and his shield out in front of him, but the wind was steadily pushing him backwards. Another dozen yards, and he would be tumbling into the blackness.
Tony opened his eyes and found himself staring up at a woman. She had long, straight brown hair, and she was
“Might not be anything,” Tony said. “There’s paint so dark that it absorbs damn near 100% of light.”
Tony’s head cocked slightly to the side, and he gave Steve a piercing look that made his hackles come up. His eyes were luminous in the sunshine, wide and unblinking, the dark slits of his pupils looking almost sinister. After a long moment, Tony blinked, and the spell was broken. He stretched again before moving toward the tree line.
“Are you going to get up?” Steve asked from behind him.
.” When Steve froze like a cornered rabbit, Tony just examined him. The resemblance was eerily close. In the darkness, the differences would be unnoticeable. “Seems like we have a similar itch, and maybe a mutual way to scratch it.”
“Stop pushing me, Stark.” Steve warned, catching his wrists and squeezing them just hard enough to hurt.
He felt Steve’s faint shudder and loosened his grip. Steve didn’t immediately pull away from him, but he hung his head and breathed slowly through his nose. “Were you… You and – him? Were you?”
Still holding the kitten in his jaws, Tony looked over to the hapless monster. He was staring at the escaping kittens with burning, hate filled eyes, mute now in the grips of what Tony recognized was obsession.
Steve hurried to interject, like the introduction was a foot in the door.
What he didn’t say was that Tony used to thrill him as much as anger him. Tony didn’t say it either. He reached down to grab Steve’s belt buckle, and gave it a hard yank as he pulled the belt’s tail out of the loop.
Ahead of them, Captain America ran to the edge of the water, helpless on the ground, every line of his body expressing his frustration and fear. He put a hand to his ear.
“Why? Because it’s too good to be true? That you have friends who love you, family? Me?”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony said soothingly. “Let’s get you back to your mommy.”
He yowled, hissed, and kicked frantically to get out from under Steve’s belly, which only seemed to help Steve in his quest to sniff every individual fur on Tony’s body. When he felt Steve’s blunt nose press against his ass, Tony turned and swiped him hard on the muzzle.
“I’m trying,” Tony gritted out. “I’m looking for him. Jesus fucking Christ, just tell me where he is!”
Already at the top of the hill and lounging on a fallen tree, Tony watched them climb.
, with delicate bone structure and intelligent eyes. “Jane?” he asked, confused. She was Thor’s girlfriend. Except Thor wasn’t real, he was a construct of Tony’s seriously fucked up and obviously over-indulged imagination.
The puppy asked.
Tony snorted. Like he was really going back to ‘his’ universe, even if they were able to find a way to open a portal. There was nothing back there for him, and day one in the new universe, he already had someone in his bed who was enthusiastically happy to be there, and also handed out orgasms like candy. What did it matter if he was a stand in for a version of himself who was obviously a better man than he?
Steve just stared at him. “I thought you were being polite,” he said quietly. His expression had shifted from angry to devastated, and it just made Tony mad.
, maybe in English, or German, but to Tony it just sounded like a babble of angry sounds. He hissed at the man, who took no notice of him.
Processes finally fell into place, and he managed to inhale and exhale in the correct sequence. The dark spots in front of his eyes faded, and he became aware of the motion of his chest, the dryness in his throat. People were moving around him, alarms were going off, there were hands everywhere, and he finally realized that he was struggling against them.
Noise of pleading that Tony ignored, because he was ignoring Steve like Steve didn’t exist. As soon as Steve’s nose was out of Tony’s space, he twisted his hips so his back was to Steve, and then turned his attention back to the wolf.
his voice as colors, lines, equations written in the air. They faded, and he found Steve standing next to him, wide-eyed and glowing with equal parts worry and hope and fear and joy. He twisted and found Rhodey on the other side, eyes luminous in his face, lips practically disappearing into his mouth.
Riverstones did not immediately reply, though Steve heard – or maybe felt – a sort of background humming that he interpreted as confusion, tinged slightly with suspicious.
Steve would have thought of this version of himself. They looked similar – not identical, but very close. The Steve he knew better maybe had a more prominent jaw, a wider face. Tony thought that he was maybe a touch taller, and a bit broader too, but that could be the effects of the slimming bodysuit. This Steve was still packed with muscle, still looked like he could snap a tree trunk over his knee if he wanted, still looked like Captain America. He wasn’t though, that was someone else in this universe now. There had also never been such a thing as the Ultimates. They’d been called Avengers (God, that was stupid, but so was Ultimates).
He came back to Steve’s forehead pressed into his stomach. They were both slick with sweat, and Steve mouthed slowly at his skin. “I almost killed you.”
“Join the fucking club, Steve. It’s about time.”
Before Steve could respond, a sleek golden dog with a wedge-shaped head, and alert, pointed ears ducked out of the house. The puppy spilled out after her, bouncing eagerly around her feet. In the next moment, four more puppies tumbled through the door. The last in the bunch was barely awake, and weaved on her feet as she followed her littermates.
Despite the earlier scare the spreading puddle had given some of the bystanders, there were still crowds of people pressing up against the relocated police barricades. As Steve watched, a trio of snickering boys took baseballs out of their hoodie pockets, waited until the nearest officer had looked away, and threw them over his head. Steve stepped forward and deflected two of the balls off the curve of the shield, sending them sailing back over the crowd to a spattering of startled applause.
The other cat didn’t even acknowledge that he’d spoken. She rushed forward to grab the kitten, and then dragged her back a few feet. She set immediately to grooming the crying kitten, licking her roughly, frantically.
Looking troubled, Steve lowered him slowly back to the desk, and then leaned over Tony’s chest again, careful to keep his weight to himself as he slid the knots away from Tony’s wrists. Tony’s back instantly protested having his weight on his spine again, and his shoulders throbbed from the release of pressure as soon as the belt fell away. Steve didn’t let him suffer there for long. He slipped one arm under Tony’s shoulders, and the other under his knees. A soft breath was all he had to show for the exertion as he picked Tony up, and went down to the floor. They joined the sour coffee, Tony’s combat belt, and the rumpled remains of his paperwork.
Steve took a sharp step forward, shield arm coming up in a gesture that was as familiar to Tony as the sight of his own hand raised for the repulsor. Tony took an automatic step backwards, hands coming up defensively, but Steve knocked his hands aside with a lightning fast snap of his wrist, and grabbed the back of Tony’s neck.
Startled, Steve whirled and bucked, trying to throw the threat off. Tony dug his claws in.
Tony’s teeth clicked shut. He stared wide-eyed, chest jerking up and falling down with the
The tunnel widened out into a funnel as the villagers got closer, and then the leading edge opened up. Walker stopped at the edge of the green light, but adult cats darted right in, running for the exhausted babies. Some were joyfully and immediately reunited with their litters, but it was obvious that the priority was getting them somewhere safe. They could be sorted out to the proper parents later.
, Steve suggested nervously, unconsciously taking a step back toward the arched entry. He looked over his shoulder, more than half expecting the entrance to have disappeared in the fog.
“We’re going back,” the captain decided. “You’re going to medbay!”
and a crack, the trailing end of it flying over Tony’s head. Despite feeling the air of its motion, Tony hadn’t flinched; even trapped under Steve’s bulk and at his mercy, he couldn’t make himself believe that Steve would hurt him. Steve maybe didn’t agree. His jaw clenched and relaxed several times, and his hands squeezed the webbed belt so hard that his gloves creaked.
Steve winced. He straightened his spine in a fluid roll, his expression settling into something distant and cool. “I’m sorry. Obviously I’ve misread.”
“Steve.”
? – and handed Tony a pen and a clipboard to write on.
have really thrown something if he’d had anything in reach that didn’t weigh at least a hundred and twelve pounds. He kicked his stool away instead and let it clatter on the concrete floor. Steve spun automatically, hands coming up like he thought Tony might be attacking him.
, Tony commanded once he was settled.
“None,” Steve answered.
“Nighteyes!” A shrill female voice cried. “My baby! Where is my baby?”
, Riverstones said contemptuously. When Steve barked out a protest, Riverstones just looked to the hoard of rats filling the hall. They had formed up into one mass, their eyes focused on Redskull with unnerving intensity.
When the grizzled captain of Howard’s survey vessel had shown up asking where his grant had gone, Tony had considered throwing him out. Instead, he’d put on two layers of long underwear, bought a parka, and gotten on a creaky boat to go explore glaciers. Just like the old man had year-after-miserable-year.
Following his gaze, Fury explained, “SHIELD is what the SSR became after you… well. Margaret Carter and Howard Stark had a reason for the name, I guess.” He nodded respectfully toward Steve.
Tony looked away from the struggle in the sand and turned to the Steve who stood beside him. “Did I die?”
A hard impact against his side made him gasp in a wet breath. Hard coils wrapped around his neck and waist. He flung one arm out to struggle free as he tumbled with the new weight wrapped around him, and then twisted to bring the shield to bear.
Getting onto his back feet again, he felt across the wall where a door was most likely to be, if there was one at all. Standing upright, he guessed that he was about as tall as the kitten-napping rat in the woods had been, so if there was any kind of lever it would most likely be –
The village lights were burning brightly, and there was a great bustle of noise as he found his way back to the dogs’ house. He hopped over the fence with some trouble, unbalanced by the kitten in his jaws, and the suit still sitting on his shoulders. He had to put the kitten down for a second, and she immediately curled up by his feet, fighting to squirm under his belly. Tony let his weight rest on her, and she started to purr loudly. He found himself purring in response, the vibration in his chest making him feel better.
“What’s the benefit if I do?” Tony asked tiredly. The door shut behind him and the scene he’d just lived through felt immediately less-real, another dream among many.
“Mr. Stark?” A hand landed on his shoulder. Tony felt it, but he shouldn’t have because the armor – “Mr. Stark?”
Fury watched him carefully with his one eye, head tipped slightly like a bird to bring Steve into focus. “Seventy years, Cap.”
“You need to see the physician,” the captain said firmly.
Steve shoved him hard enough to tip his hips over and nudged his nose into Tony’s belly. Tony promptly put a foot against his face and pushed hard. Steve made a
Tony opened his eyes and found his vision closed in by the eyeslits of Iron Man’s armor once more, an even older version of the armor than he’d been walking around in with Steve at his side in the mansion. It was heavier and there wasn’t even a cursory display on the inside. He looked down and found that he was standing at a helm, his hands on a wheel, dozens of controls and levers and buttons at his elbows. He looked toward the voice and found a giant of a man in a red cape and a bewinged helmet standing at a porthole. They were obviously deep under water.
The last she said uncertainly, as if she would rather not encourage their presence, but she was too polite to tell them to leave. Steve hurriedly stepped away from her so she didn’t feel crowded. She looked at him with undisguised curiosity as did.
He traveled some distance out of the village to find a makeshift bathroom for himself. He didn’t want to end up shitting in someone’s vegetable patch. Relieved, and mess firmly covered up with dirt and dry leaves, Tony took a meandering path back toward the village. The suit being folded up as a backpack threw his balance off, but he was reluctantly to fold it back down over his fur.
When the kittens stopped whining, he knew that they’d just about had it. He understood wanting to get them as far away from the cliff as possible, just as he had wanted to get the men of the 107
Rhodey reached over and grabbed Tony by both arms. He shook him hard enough to make Tony’s head swim. His vision went white-blue-black-blue-white-gray-white-blue. He moaned, as his stomach turned over and squeezed hard.
They both froze and stared at each other, ears slowly rotating forward.
Tony pushed himself away from Natasha’s shoulder and made a noise that sounded like
, hit the stone floor, and mowed down an advancing wave.
‘multiverse.’
get to ask that,” Steve ground out. “You got to forget. I can’t, and it’s not my responsibility to make you understand.”
“You can’t keep your temper with me because it gets you laid. Classical conditioning.” Tony shifted and stretched as well, arms and legs going wide. When he relaxed, they were pressed together from shoulder to elbow.
The terrain grew steeper still until Steve was fighting for each upward step, hopping up more than running. The smaller Riverstones took each step deliberately with grim determination. Far ahead of them, Tony bounced from tree trunk to stone to tree trunk, looking more like a squirrel than a cat as he made judicious use of his thrusters to sail between branches.
“I found her in the woods!” he said hurriedly.
Steve offered, ducking his head. His tail tucked slowly down between his legs, and he inched forward to nudge at Tony’s hindquarter with his giant, wet nose.
Tony decided to ignore the insinuation, and instead turned his attention to the cliff. He had been doing his best to explore the modified suit’s functions as they’d travelled, and had discovered that he could still talk (Meow?) at the suit, though it did not reply as his typical AI did. It was lonely in the suit without a comforting voice to chat with while he was problem solving, but he supposed that Jarvis hadn’t been able to come through with him.
had fallen in. Tony had jumped in, because he was stupid.
“I miss you, Shellhead,” Steve said. He set his forehead against Tony’s helmet. “I miss you. Come back.”
Steve bit back the automatic curses, and then perked up. Tony couldn’t understand him. He could curse at Tony all day and call him a self-righteous, over-inflated, self-important, egotist asshole with more daddy issues than money, and that there was not enough sarcasm on the planet to hide his big idiotic heart, and Tony would never know. So Steve did. It came out in a rolling yammer that made Tony start to growl immediately.
Tony asked. He was aware of the dogs’ ears twitching in response to his words, but he wasn’t going to take the time to translate himself just so the local canine population could understand him talking to his suit.
“He doesn’t,” Tony insisted, but his voice shook.
Tony’s jaw slackened. He closed his eyes tightly. The room rocked like they were on the ocean, and Tony’s memory shifted again.
Steve looked over his shoulder at Tony, still crouched low to the ground with his ears pressed to his skull, and then looked to the wolf.
feel better,” Steve said, but he twisted to look behind him, and then shifted his weight in anticipation of a jump.
Steve looked around again. He had no idea who Fury was, or what kind of organization he belonged to. They’d already tried to trick him once. The spectacle had gathered a crowd and people were watching them curiously, but the armed guards who’d jumped out of the cars were holding the onlookers back. No one seemed especially confused by their presence, and they were reacting as if these black-clad people were police of some kind. S.H.I.E.L.D was stamped on the side of one of the vehicles in a very official-looking gray logo.
Tony huffed.
“Don’t be stupid,” Tony said, his fingers moving in a complicated programed-and-never used pattern.
He wanted to turn around. He wanted to follow Steve to the common room – Steve had called him
Steve snorted so loudly it sounded like a cough. Tony decided to ignore the comment, which was becoming more fun by the moment. Maybe when he got back to being a human, he could continue the gaming of just ignoring things. He’d always been good at selective hearing, but mostly that was obtained by talking over people. If he could master the cat-trick of pretending people didn’t exist, his life would be a lot easier.
Steve asked.
Steve said. He looked back at Tony, who was abruptly uninterested in the preceding. He turned and aggressively groomed his fur back into place.
, he announced.
Steve looked mildly confused to find Tony down in the road instead up in the shallow scoop their bodies had made as they’d slept. For that matter, Tony didn’t remember inviting Steve into his scoop in the first place, so it wasn’t his fault if Steve didn’t like get his bladder massaged. Tony felt his tail start to thump in the packed soil as Steve just sat down at the top of the hill and stared down at him.
“Technically it’s
“There it is,” Tony groaned when he finally felt his own orgasm building like slow fire between his legs. “Fuck, Steve. Stay like that, just –” Steve obligingly held himself at the same angle, his hand working over his cock in fast jerks while he clenched tighter and tighter for a third time.
up to the door. He flashed a smile at the agents who’d been chasing after him, and held the door open for Steve and Anthony while the agents glowered.
Steve asked when Riverstones turned for the tunnel.
Steve said like he was humoring Tony. He twisted to look at Tony over his shoulder, his tail curled up so it nearly rested on his back.
“You threw it off the bed,” Steve said between heavy breaths once Tony had let him go.
. There is no reality, no universe that exists outside my head where you-!” He pointed at Steve where he sat with his magazine, fingers under Tony’s hand. Tony felt the illusion of warmth and a tickle of pressure at the center of his palm.
Before Steve could yank away from him, Tony tightened his grip. “No, darling. We certainly were not. Your counterpart would
” Tony howled somewhere in his head, while his hand filled out mission reports (
Unable to help it, Steve laughed. The noise disturbed Tony’s rest, and he extended one back paw to shove at the underside of Steve’s jaw. Steve licked his exposed head, and Tony made a discontented noise as he tucked himself deeper into Steve’s fur.
His larger stride brought him even with Tony in a few moments. They walked quietly next to each other as the second moon crept toward the horizon, and the sky behind them grew steadily lighter. The road dipped down a hill the closer they got to the village, and Steve realized that what they had seen of the village from the top of the rise had been only the upper levels. He craned his neck back as they passed under an arch of slender braided trees wound with flowering vines. Mist wound between the trunks of the trees and stretched fine tendrils over the road. The main road was lined with oddly shaped buildings of various sizes, all squeezed in together without regard for relative size. Further back, more houses, larger, had been built against the massive tree trunks, and looked to drill directly into them. Crude steps wound up these trees to homes perched further up in the boughs. Rope bridges stretched between the higher levels, and glowing globes dropped down from branches and the undersides of bridges, giving the whole village an ethereal quality.
Tony was so taken aback by the question that he just blinked at Steve for several seconds. “What?”
Steve caught him with a soft murmur of noise. “You don’t have to do everything alone,” he said.
“Let go,” Steve ordered shortly.
was a German bomber. A regular American soldier had boarded it and forced it down in the ocean to stop its perfectly normal bombs from reaching American soil. Captain America was a comic book hero created to punch Hitler at a time when America refused to get involved. He was a fantasy.
Natasha had Kilgrave in a full body bind, her thighs wrapped around his upper legs, arms pulling his elbows back. He jerked his head while Clint struggled to get a muzzle on him. Bucky hauled Steve to his feet and Sam got under his other arm. They dragged him into Tony’s line of sight, Bucky waving a flashlight to get his attention. Tony froze, body trembling with tension, staring at Steve with disbelieving, wide eyes.
“Just – Oh, God – Give me. A minute. Two, maybe,” he panted, words interrupted by aftershocks.
a sonorous voice said.
“Shut up,” Clint ordered. “It’s a team
, the self-sacrificing bastard. After that, what did it matter if Tony made it out alive? Maybe there were some parts of the world that deserved to be saved, but none of it was
. Whatever that inky pit of blackness was, it must have transformed him into these animal bodies. Which just left the important question of where they were, and how the hell they were going to get back.
“Fine,” Tony said. He craned his head back.
Turning his back on Steve, Tony relayed the brief tale to worried murmurs from the gathered crowd.
“Come back,” Steve repeated, and pressed a kiss to Tony’s helmet. “I’m waiting for you.”
Afternoon was stretching quickly toward dusk when Walker hopped lightly down a shallow hill, and landed in a packed dirt road. She sat down and pointed her nose toward the quickly descending sun.
Steve said, the words coming out a mishmash of the strange telepathic communication, and the yips and barks of his vocalizations.
Walker blinked. “What strange names you have.”
overhead before he had to come up with a rejoinder. The jet landed in the nearest intersection, Clint performing a crazy spiral to fit into the residential street.
“Tony,” Steve said softly. “Tony, just open your eyes.”
The strange anxious twist in his chest bloomed into hot, angry acid. “That is not fair,” he snarled, pointing a finger at Steve, who just crossed his arms over his chest. “You’re the one who leaves! You’re the one who only comes to me when you have steam to blow off.”
“Tony, please. I’d do anything for you to just come back. I miss you, Shellhead. I miss you.”
“I didn’t mean it that way,” Tony said. He slouched into a chair and put his forehead in his palm. “I’m just tired. Ignore me.”
Moving slowly and deliberately, Steve set a hand to Tony’s left thigh. The muscle jumped up eagerly to meet his palm, and he pressed the heel in as he pushed his hand up to Tony’s waist. Tony made another one of those embarrassing sounds, but he kept still under the patient onslaught as Steve loosened his belt and slowly pulled it free. It dropped to the floor,
“What is that you want from him, hm?” Tony wondered, stroking Steve almost idly. He leaned forward enough to lick a stripe up Steve’s neck. “You want him to peel you out of this uniform?” He left Steve’s erection laying on his belly, and wedged a hand behind him to get to the zipper. What a gloriously useless uniform. Steve curled forward to give him access and let Tony pull it off his shoulders.
Steve did not miss the parallel, but he let it slide.
“Or is it going to be
Her voice faded to a murmur as the sunlight got brighter, the beeps and ticks of the machines growing louder. Tony watched Steve’s expression set harder, his eyes narrowing, his lips turning down at the corners. He was terrifying in the intensity of his belief, his surety that Tony was going to manufacture a miracle and wake up. Maybe it was hard for Steve to accept considering what he’d woken up from.
Tony recovered ungracefully.
“Let me,” he said, but that was too honest and too much like begging, so he added, “Catch my breath.”
“Tony, we don’t have to –”
“Let’s not throw balls at possibly-alien holes of nothingness anymore, hm?” Tony suggested. He tossed the ball back, and the tallest of the kids belated caught it inches from his nose. Tony gave them a brief salute and the kids fled, fighting over the ball as they darted out of the crowd.
. His jaw got tighter and tighter, but his hand stayed gentle on Tony’s, thumb rubbing soothingly over Tony’s knuckles, as if Tony might be offended by the doctor’s lack of faith.
Tony leaned into him and nodded, lips stretching into a smile. He was barely aware of the nurses moving around him over the warmth of Steve’s hand in his own.
The kittens were sorted out, and most were returned to their parents. The ones that were left must have come from villages even further afield, and they were fostered out to grateful moms until their homes could be found.
“I’m not! This
, and everything about it was gut twistingly, skin searingly wrong. It made his teeth hurt and his joints ache, but he couldn’t look away.
Steve jumped, yelping at the sudden high-pitched voice. Tony cackled. The puppy standing at the edge of the road wagged his tail furiously.
“Stop moving,” Steve said.
Tony didn’t mention that, impact gel or not, he probably looked like he’d been in the rock-filled cement mixer more often than not. He reached over and flicked off the lights, plunging them into near total darkness interrupted only by the faint glow of a few electronic clocks. Tony noted absently that he would have to put tape over all of them later if he wanted to get any sleep.
At the sound of traffic and honking horns, he turned his head to look out the window. The familiar press of New York buildings was just outside, but something about the view looked flat. The air through the open window smelled weird. A radio was playing softly on the sideboard, and even that sounded strange. Too clear, and too familiar. He put it down to déjà vu as he sat up and looked around. He was wearing an SSR t-shirt that stretched too tight across his chest. Even the material felt strange.
Steve stared at the approaching dog in shock. She was… she was beautiful. Beautiful like Peggy had been beautiful. She had solemn dark brown eyes, and shapely legs, and her coat glistened in the early morning light. He blinked, and tossed his head, feeling intensely uncomfortable. The dog looked between them curiously, and then executed a surprisingly graceful bow of her shapely head.
Curses sounded over the comms, garbled by the wind.
He knew that the captain would move if Tony turned back for the cabin. He also knew that Steve wouldn’t go with him. His head dropped back, and he forced his spine to straighten.
It didn’t matter. Tony yanked his arms out from between their bodies, and used them to drag Steve closer. His shoulders hit the wall with a painful thump, but Tony barely felt it over the sharp sting of Steve sucking on his split lip. It was brutal, and felt like fighting more than anything, but Tony wanted it so badly he could scream.
“If this is a world where superheroes don’t exist, why are you looking for one?”
The familiar shape of Times Square finally brought him to a halt. He stared at it all in horror, turning useless circles. Ads playing actual resonate tones thundered above him, all the people with their clamoring tones, the cars, the impossibly bright, clear lights making the ads glow even in the middle of the day. Giant black automobiles like small, sleek tanks converged on him, and he didn’t even try to run. He was in New York, or dreaming, or this was someone’s version of the afterlife. Where was he supposed to run to? His legs felt suddenly weak.
Tony shoved a hand through his hair and pulled hard. “How the fuck did we get like this? We’ve been friends for more than a decade, we’ve fought together. We used to
“Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark are you alright?”
“You don’t even have to wait for me for five more seconds,” Tony snapped. “Enjoy your show. See you tomorrow.”
Steve made a coughing noise that Tony guessed was meant to be a clearing of his throat.
. Maybe he brought Captain America home in a block of ice. What then? Display his shield at the Smithsonian? Send his body on tour like an Egyptian mummy? Maybe pick through Hydra’s allegedly magical weapons and find some new terror to unleash on the world?
In the air above them, War Machine broke off from Iron Man’s side and curved away from the gaping hole in the sky, jerking and twisting as Rhodey tried to regain control of the armor. He would eventually – it was only ever meant to be used in case of emergency, in the event that Rhodey became incapable of handling the controls himself and needed assistance to land. It was never meant to stand up to the concerted effort of the pilot to resist.
The door opened and Steve blustered in, mostly in uniform (different than the uniform on the submarine, different than the uniform in the mansion house, different again than the uniform on the helicarrier (Helicarrier?)), and carrying an armful of paper.
Beneath the armor, his fur was moist and pressed down close to his body. He stretched, grateful to feel the breeze on his body. Hopping down, he made his way outside to relieve himself. The street was alive. Mostly dogs with their puppies, but he could see mice scurrying beneath their paws. He wondered briefly why he didn’t feel any particular urge to chase them, and then chastised himself silently. They were obviously thinking beings. Not wanting to run them down and pull them apart shouldn’t be a surprise.
Thor, his dream-memory supplied, a god – not a god, an alien with the name of a god. A hammer no one else could lift. They were on an Avenger’s mission in a submarine off the coast of Alaska. The particulars of the mission are fuzzy except for the notion of a man who swam like a fish and refused to wear anything other than underwear.
Despite his carefully measured tone, Steve glared as if Tony
“I don’t know why I can’t keep my temper with you,” Steve confessed.
The tossing of the ship was suddenly a comfort he wasn’t ready to give up. He didn’t want to step through the door, didn’t want to put his feet on solid ground.
His lungs re-engaged with a jerk and he sucked in breath that felt like inhaling sand. His priorities realigned, complaints rearranging in order of intensity, and air shot to the top of the list, pushing
Steve managed finally. His growl petered out to a short
. He wasn’t a
“It’s open,” he called begrudgingly.
Steve took in a breath, and then nodded. He gestured questioningly to a chair, and probably didn’t notice how much Tony hated that they had to be this careful around each other. The Steve Rogers that he actually remembered would have given his door a cursory knock, and then peered around the edge of it to see if he was busy. Even if Tony was on the phone, he’d have come in as long Tony didn’t wave him off. There wasn’t much that Tony hadn’t been willing to share with him, and there had been more than one occasion when Steve had hid in his workshop for most of the day while Tony conducted business.
As if in answer, he heard the shuffle of boots somewhere above him and to his left, accompanied by the murmur of deliberate communication. He recognized the sound immediately as a trained fighter clearing a stairwell. He considered getting up and moving into a defensible position, but it just seemed like so much effort. He waited as the boots thumped down the stairs, and wished he had a drink. It had been a few hours. Or more, depending on how long he’d been unconscious.
“I don’t have them,” Rhodey said stubbornly.
“No,” Tony croaked. He stepped-slid-slipped down the stairs and leaned against the wall. The corridor ended and hallways ran out left and right. The left-hand side was illuminated. MEDBAY, the sign read, blue on white, and underlined in red. The right-hand side was dark, the sign rusted over. LAB 2. It might as well have said
Steve, holding back the heaviness in his chest, murmured, “Language.”
Steve said his own goodbyes Riverstones and Moonlight’s litter. He exchanged nose bumps with the adult dogs, wuffed out farewells to crowds of mice, and stood on his back legs to shake paws with the kangaroo. She was delighted by this, and sat back on her tail while she shook his paws vigorously.
Steve snarled something in response, but he’d stopped squirming and eyed Tony speculatively. Tony abruptly remembered that dogs didn’t have full color vision, so maybe Tony just looked like a cat. He wracked his brain trying to remember if cats did, but it had never been a particular interest to him, just trivia. He looked around the clearing again, but he couldn’t definitively say what colors he could see when they were on an alien planet. For all he knew, there was no red on this planet.
Setting down his fork, the captain stared at him hard. “I said we’re taking an expedition out tomorrow. Do you want to go?”
shower, Commander,” Tony pointed out.
“Captain Rogers is requesting entry to the lab, Sir,” Jarvis announced over the music. Tony thumbed the welder off and nudged his faceplate up. He glared at the hunk of metal on his workstation and set the welder aside. It wasn’t like he was getting anywhere with it.
Steve reached over suddenly and caught his hand, and Tony had the conflicting impressions that he was still writing and that his hand was immobile (and cold) under Steve’s grip. He wanted to turn his hand over and lace their fingers together, he wanted to pull his hand away, he wanted to see how the hell words were still appearing on the page when he wasn’t writing them.
He looked up slowly. His eyes were rimmed with red to match the flush in his cheeks. “I almost killed you, and you can’t remember it.” His lips, swollen and moist, curved upward in a parody of a smile that came dangerously close to being manic. “I can’t forget. Where the hell does that leave us, Tony?”
Tony crossed his arms over his chest and watched dully as the spec that was Iron Man angled up into an even steeper climb. He had a bomb held to his chest, designed by Richards to close the tangled crossroads he’d inadvertently created between multiple universes. Between everyone on hand, only Iron Man and War Machine had the flight capability, speed, and shielding to carry the bomb, and between the two of them only Tony really understood how it worked. Most days, Tony really hated that he’d ever learned the
A moment later, Thor landed in the street with a rush of wind, startling Steve into a half turn. Noticing the flinch, Thor set his giant hand on Steve’s shoulder and tilted his chin down slightly. His voice lowered below his customary boom. “Are you well, my friend?”
Tony had his arms held out from his body in preparation for the suit, but he kept his eyes on Steve’s face, expression so carefully blank that Steve knew he was on the verge of breaking.
, he commanded himself. He would find Steve tomorrow and it would all be over.
“Why have you stopped coming to team movie nights?” Steve asked one afternoon, apropos of nothing, while Tony ‘caught his breath’ in Steve’s lap. Steve started tapping his fingers impatiently on Tony’s side, so Tony gave up and slid out of his lap. He didn’t settle on the couch, but climbed directly to his feet and started gathering clothes, putting some space between them.
Steve glanced between their still-naked bodies. He barked out a brief laugh and stretched, bumping his calf into Tony’s. “Maybe we should suggest this as negotiating tactics for the UN.”
“Tony?” he gasped out. He could feel his lips moving but he couldn’t hear his own voice. It was disconcerting and he tried again, screaming Tony’s name. Bucky put a hand over his mouth to stop him and Sam pointed across the room. Rhodey had Tony in a bear hug, but Tony didn’t seem to notice. He thrashed like a wildcat, face wet with tears, mouth open in a scream that Steve could feel in his chest but couldn’t hear. He was lunging at Kilgrave, feet shoved against War Machine’s thighs so his back bowed at an alarming angle, tossing his weight side-to-side in an effort to get free. Steve had seen Tony angry before. Angry Tony went quiet, cold. Angry Tony contained his rage and channeled it into controlled destruction. Angry Tony fixed things. He’d never seen Tony handle anger like this, as if he was two seconds away from his own Hulk transformation.
“We’re watching
Possibly despite himself, Steve laughed.
, Tony informed him cheerfully.
“Old horror movies tonight,” Steve continued unexpectedly. “
Steve nodded. “On edge,” he admitted with a gesture to the inky blackness eating the street. “You ever seen anything like this?”
Tony finally managed through all the growling.
He got to his feet and waved a vague goodnight to the room. He considered the penthouse, but eventually asked Jarvis to take him to the workshop. Tony didn’t even bother with the pretense of working. He grabbed a blanket and pillow out of the cupboard and curled up in the spot where he and Steve had almost-kind-of cuddled.
“You’re in the lab.” Tony closed his eyes and tried to make his stomach stop twisting. “That way is the medical bay.”
The commotion finally resolved into shouts of panic. Tony snagged the kitten and hurried to cover. He needed to see what was going on, but he couldn’t leave the kitten alone, and he couldn’t just take her out into a fight. She remained quiet and sweetly trusting as he crept around the house to peer into the street. There were no rats running rampant through the street, just the same villagers he’d seen earlier that day.
Steve wobbled at a sharp burst of wind, and lost another foot of ground, but was apparently determined to keep his position. Meanwhile, trash flew by at speeds that made even the crumpled bits of paper dangerous. The crowd, at least, had willingly yielded to suggestions to run.
Hopping back up to his boulder, he found a sunny spot and decided to take a break while Steve got himself loose.
“Last time I try to help you,” Steve muttered, twisting to sniff at the wet patch on shirt. He bit at an itch on his back leg while he was there, and then dropped into the road and rolled around a bit. The shield scratched against the dirt, but he managed to more or less get the shirt dry.
Tony got up to follow her without acknowledging Steve’s antics, which earned him a disappointed huff. Still ignoring him, Tony veered off to the left and hopped up on a fallen tree. Steve trotted along underneath him, and the wolf seemed to be ignoring them both as she ambled through the undergrowth.
. The phrase made him flinch automatically. He took a hesitant step backwards. The armed people all tensed. He was in some hellscape’s reimagining of ‘home’ and every tone around him screamed with foreign music. His bonds were all gone – there would be no Bucky coming around the corner, summoned by Steve's distress, no Peggy striding out of the alley with her handgun out in front of her. He was alone.
Tony yowled with laughter. He felt his tail go up for the first time, curling up at the top in an expression of pleasure. Not half so pleased, Steve snarled at him again. He twisted around and started tearing at the fabric with his teeth. Tony suspected that he started having fun about half way through, growling and shaking his head to tear at the seams. Tony probably could have helped, but he was tired, and not interested in getting in between Steve and his chew toy.
Steve stepped out of the doorway, but didn’t close the door. He stopped at Tony’s side and looked up. His expression was one of profound sadness as he watched, like he knew what was going to happen. Of course, he did know what was going to happen, because
Riverstones blinked. The great bushy white brows over his eyes drew together, and he tipped his head sideways.
Steve’s eyes widened briefly, and then went flinty, but he nodded. He grabbed Tony’s wrist and made quick work of looping the belt around it and pulling it tight. Tony yanked back on it just to see if Steve would let him, and Steve respond by dragging the belt sharply upward.
Switching back to infrared, Tony crouched against the wall. He waited several tense seconds for any signs of motion, or flashes of heat in the darkness. When nothing presented itself, he turned around to examine the stone behind him. He started to hear Steve’s impatient whines within a few minutes, and then Riverstone’s grumbles as well, but he ignored them while he looked for anything that might open the door.
Steve’s ears swiveled, and he cocked his head. Sounding hesitant, he said, “Wuff.”
She gave him a sympathetic look that made Tony cringe, her eyes flickering over to the monitors. “Captain Rogers, I know that this is hard for you to accept, but he is in a coma. He’s not responding to you consciously.”
“You’re a bad liar,” Tony snapped. “We are not moving that…” His teeth bared in an ugly snarl. He drew in a breath and calmed himself. “Kilgrave could have lackeys watching this place, already in place in case he’s captured. We need all the air support we can get.”
he screamed, his voice going shrill in an effort to rise over the hum of the engine, the whip of the wind, and the splash of the icy water against the boat. They were racing over water the color of a cold corpse, arrowing toward a landscape of ice and snow. The sun hit the ice and turned it a shade of white-gold that he couldn’t quite describe. Even through the tinted goggles, it made his eyes sting.
“You have done this before?” Tony asked, holding still while Steve made tiny, jerky motions on his finger. He obliged Steve by pressing upwards again, and enjoyed the resulting shudder.
“Haven’t you crawled through enough shit to deserve to
“However it happened,” she said gently, “The end result is the same. He’s… he’s like a computer without an operating system.”
Steve looked disappointed, but he took his hands away from Tony’s ass and moved back. “Sure,” he said with a shrug that he was trying to pass off as casual. He gave Tony a tight smile and turned away. “I’ll leave you alone.”
The Steve beside him said nothing. Tony felt the pressure on his hand increase. Behind him, Steve broke off his reading and said in a cheerful, teasing voice, “If you could wake up and explain how this works to me, I’d sure appreciate it. You know how the future confuses us old men. I need you to… I need you. We’ve been stupid about each other for too long. You deserve better from me.”
“And the crappy street food?” Tony prodded.
Something big crashed through the brush to his left, and Tony was moving almost before he’d registered the noise. Paws digging into the damp soil, he sprang out of his hiding place and made a run for the trees. He’d never moved so fast in his life. For a moment, he forgot that he was running for his life and relished in the coordination and fluidity of his feline body. The moment he recognized how coordinated he was feeling, he promptly went tumbling tail-over-whiskers into the grass. His feet were quickly tangled up, and he lost track of which limb went where.
“Who made you try harder after Afghanistan? Or was it Vietnam?” Steve asked.
Tony’s ears pricked forward. The squeak came again, but more distinct this time. It was the cry of a very young kitten. Equal parts curious and concerned, Tony listened in for the direction of the noise. The dragging sound came closer, and then closer again. A gigantic, wiry gray rat limped across the ground, each step crunching over the dry leaves, while its fat tail dragged behind it. Over its back, it had a squirming, crying sack.
Riverstones suggested when Steve shoved himself out of the hole in a flurry of panicky whines and the scrape of his shield on the stones.
). Tony hadn’t been there for that one, had only seen the images in the aftermath, but how could they both be real?
Only once Kilgrave was thoroughly bound and under anesthesia did Clint deactivate the sonic device attached to an arrow partially embedded in the table. He must have shot it through the skylight and then repelled in after it. As a safety measure, they kept the headphones on while Kilgrave was loaded into a sound-proofed box in the back of a reinforced semi-truck. Rhodey locked it and then flicked his faceplate up. Steve gratefully pulled the headphones off, though he left them down around his neck.
Before he could gather up the nerves to eat the cooked food, a scratch at the door had heralded a big gray tomcat. He’d come in backwards, his tail up in the air, and holding a great flopping fish by the tail. Steve had shifted over, and the tom had joined them at the table, dropping the fish in front of Tony and inviting him to dig in.
In the next moment, Tony was flying through the air. He twisted, dizzyingly on four axes. He impacted hard with the wall, and crumpled down to the floor, still landing on all four feet for as much good as it did him. He felt the shock of landing shoot up his legs, and had to just lay still for a second to overcome the disorienting blow.
“No! I am but two blocks to your north, and the air is as calm as a babe’s sleeping breath. I will see if I cannot discover its source. Are you in danger on the ground?”
Breathing past the sudden heat behind his eyes, Tony called out, “Yes?”
He closed his eyes and pressed his hands to his face until purple and yellow lights exploded behind his eyelids. When he opened his eyes again, the room had solidified, and it was still his own body on the table, soaking wet and tinged blue with the cold, dozens of wounds that had frozen over.
Letting go of Steve’s waist, Tony wedged his hands between their bodies and pushed sharply. Steve’s back hit the door, and he blinked at Tony in confusion. Tony let him have a few breaths of wondering what the hell was happening before going after him. Their bodies collided, and Steve almost caught him in the groin out of reflex. Unexpectedly charging at a trained soldier, and at a man like Steve, was never a good idea, but it was part of the thrill. Tony knew that Steve could throw him across the room if it came to that, which just made pinning him to the door all the more exciting. Their mouths met again, and Steve finally got with the program. He grabbed the back of Tony’s head hard, using his grip to move Tony’s head into a position he liked. Tony retaliated by biting his lip. He grabbed Steve’s free hand and slammed it against the wall. It was an immediate struggle to keep it there, but it felt good.
He turned to the right, ignored the captain’s exasperated sigh, and slid down the wall. The corridor stretched, and narrowed, closed in on him until his vision was reduced to a horizontal slit.
A moment later, Steve came slamming down after him and disappeared into the inky blackness without causing so much as ripple. Not even stopping to think of how much of a
“You’re not avoiding anyone?” Steve prompted softly.
Steve’s ears went back, and then he turned away from Tony and resumed trying to get his pants off, paws scrabbling uselessly in an attempt to get to the belt.
He shouted as his equilibrium slowly reasserted itself.
Steve shook his head mutely, and squeezed Tony tighter to his chest. He nestled his forehead into Tony’s neck. “I’m sorry,” he whispered into Tony’s collarbone. “I keep thinking that it’s not fair to apologize when you don’t remember what I’m apologizing for, but I can’t just. We can’t stay like this.”
Steve’s ears drooped, and his jaw hit his chest again. This time, he couldn’t stop the whine that rattled high in his throat. He
“Oh,” Tony rasped. Ridiculously, he felt himself relaxing as he recognized the familiar form. Steve, looking ghostly in the light of a glowing shield, was obviously dead. Ergo, Tony was dead. “This makes more sense.”
coalesced into a tangible weight in his pelvis and sent shocky pulses down his legs and up his ribs.
Tony howled. The wind howled with him. “No. He’s here. He’s here, he’s waiting.”
Steve’s eyes glowed in the encroaching darkness. He tipped his head to one side and glanced back at the trio in the sand. “I guess that’s up to you.”
Tony calculated the force of the wind, the distance to Steve, and how long he had before the reaching tendrils of darkness met. The wind speed was hovering at just under 40 mph, with sharp gusts shooting up over 50 mph. In theory, the thrusters wouldn’t start having trouble keeping up until the wind speed got closer to 100 mph, but he hadn’t been able to test it above 80 in the field.
. She didn’t look at him as scrubbed his hands across his face and steeled himself to stand up. He was so fucking tired. He wanted to fall back to her shoulder, but he doubted he could pull off it-was-an-accident-I-swear twice in one night.
Tony looked up at him curiously.
Tony demanded, rounding on him. He had his ears pressed down to his skull and his tail lashing around his feet.
Okay,
was suppressed so far under
Tony looked up at houses set higher along the trunks. His whiskers stretched forward in obvious longing, but he said,
“Let’s get you home to mommy, okay?” he asked. He wanted to get her out of there in hurry in case the rat came back, maybe with friends.
Steve moved to stand next to him. He crossed his ankles one way and his arms the other, right-over-left, left-over-right. “Sure. Want to tell me why you’re really hiding?”
Tony wished he could still lift one eyebrow. He tried, but all he managed was swiveling his left ear to the side. Steve obviously didn’t interpret the gesture correctly, and looked off to the left, alert for any signs of movement.
“Iron Man?” Steve shouted to be heard over the rain. “What are you doing?”
Thousands, and thousands of rats.
Struggling out of Bucky’s grip, Steve stumbled the last feet to Tony’s side, reaching up to put a hand on his face. Tony went limp in Rhodey’s arms, and Rhodey finally let him go. Steve caught him with his good arm, but Tony didn’t fold into him. He snatched the flashlight away from Bucky and shined it on Steve’s chest. Steve looked down to see all the blood soaking through his torn uniform. He grabbed Tony’s hand and pushed his fingers into the bullet wound to help him find it amidst the mess of torn, bloody material. Throbbing heat radiated out from the contact and Tony jerked his hand away immediately. He took the bandage that Sam offered and pressed it over the leaking wound. Steve put his hand over Tony’s, but he didn’t try to hold him when Tony slipped away from him, leaving the bandage behind. Turning enough that he could see Steve, Kilgrave, and Rhodey, he held out his hands. Rhodey, secure behind the War Machine helmet, did nothing. Tony gestured to his wrist with a tightly controlled jerk of his fingers, and Rhodey shook his head. Tony wanted his Iron Man bracelets and Rhodey either didn’t have them or wasn’t giving them up.
A woman in a lab coat walked into the room. Tony stared at her as she looked up from her clipboard. 5’8” with dirty-blond hair pulled back in a tail, Jolie-mouth, Scandinavian features.
Curling his fingers into his palms, he looked up. “How?”
Natasha nodded and Rhodey stiffy opened a panel over his chest. Tony didn’t wait for him to retrieve the bracelets, but reached in himself and pulled them out. He snapped them over his wrists, but then gave Steve an uncertain look.
Tony said with sweet innocence. Steve bared his teeth. Riverstones rolled his eyes.
Just when he was ready to demand that they stop to the let the kittens sleep, he saw a dark shape just over the next hill. As he watched, it resolved into the form of dozens of running animals, and dozens more behind them. Finally, he recognized the great form of the kangaroo, and realized that it was the villagers, and not just from Riverstones’ village, but other villages as well. Leading them was the familiar hulking gray form of Walker.
He didn’t think he could have gotten a better response if he’d set a firecracker off at Steve’s feet. Steve yanked him forward to get him off balance, and then picked him up in one smooth motion, spun, and dropped Tony on his desk. The cold coffee flew off the edge, hitting the ugly industrial carpet with a dull smack, and papers went everywhere. Sorting out the stacks again would be a mess, and Tony did not care. He wrapped his legs around Steve’s hips, locked his ankles, and squeezed. Steve retaliated by digging a thumb into Tony’s inner thigh. Tony knew the trick, and he’d been on the receiving end of it more than once during sparring practice, but even though he’d been expecting it, the sudden pain at the pressure point made his grip loosen.
A pained whimper made him automatically drop to his belly. His ears pricked forward to track the sound, and his tail went very still. For the first time, Tony took in his surroundings. The sky was a pale blue-gray, he was in grass that went over his head while he was crouched down, and surrounded by dark trees. The air smelled wet and sharp like ozone, and two faint shapes of moons were visible just over the trees.
“Leave,” he snarled. The words fought across his tongue and his teeth almost bit them off. He sounded more animal than man, mad with anger and fear. “Leave. Go.”
Tony’s shoulders slumped. Pieces were slotting into place, the crazy knot that his mind was slowly unraveling, strands straightening out from the tangle of others. “You’re better off without me.”
“Never,” Tony whispered. “You make me… You make me try harder.”
“Tony?” Steve tried again, not moving away from the touch, though his voice was strained.
Steve suppressed a whine. He sat down and straightened himself out, holding his head up high.
“You’re very nice to your friend,” Riverstones commented softly as they began to climb a steeper hill.
“That’s not very nice.”
“No brainwaves,” Tony said finally. “No operating system.”
“Fine,” he said. “Fine. I’ll go see the goddamn physician.” He pushed away from the support of Steve’s arms and walked down the corridor with one hand against the wall. The ship continued to rock, knocking him gently side-to-side, Steve trailing silently at his back.
On the other side of it, Stephen Strange stood with his hands up. His cloak ruffled up until it could perch on his hips like an irate mother berating them for missing dinner.
, Steve offered, stopping with his forepaws on the log.
Tony winced. No one had called him Antonio in years, and it would take some getting used to. “Tony’s fine. When we’re alone like this.” He waited a breath for Steve to protest the idea that 'this' was anything more than a one-time deal. “Provided that you’d like to be alone like this again.”
and Captain America’s presumably frozen corpse, though Tony knew that the captain and crew mostly used it for their own studies.
Riverstones gave him a worried look. “Can’t you tell an animal from a person?”
Steve stopped him as they crossed into the kitchen, and turned to face him. Tony was aware of Steve’s hand on his arm, but he couldn’t feel it through the armor. He imagined he could, though, the warm expanse of his palm pressed into Tony’s skin, long artist’s fingers curled around his bicep.
“And the crappy street food,” Steve agreed. He smiled, and for a moment, every terrible thing between them faded. Tony felt the first stirrings of hope, and thought that maybe there was a better way forward for them.
“I look enough like someone you can’t have to make it worth your while?” Tony guessed, and just held down a laugh when Steve looked away from him in shame.
Tony stretched, and Steve waited for him to answer.
“But not tonight,” Tony decided, pulling his hand away and wiping his sticky fingers on the bedspread. Steve made a sound of pure mourning, not exactly a keen, but almost a sob. The truth was that Tony was tired, mellowed by the whiskey, and his knees were burning slightly under him. If there was another night, he would be better prepared, ready to spend hours taking Steve Rogers apart, but not after the day he’d had. He squeezed most of what remained in the tube into his hand and slicked himself roughly, and then gave himself another few pulls when the sound made Steve groan and push closer to him. An interesting reaction for another evening.
“You should see the physician when we get back on board!”
Steve snorted. He pushed himself off the couch and started gathering up his clothing. He didn’t say anything else until he was tucked away and buttoned up, belt buckled and shoes back on. “I’ll see you for training tomorrow?”
At the top of his rat lungs. He activated the suit’s external lights as he lunged forward in a great leap, but just missed the rat as he scampered out of the way. The three of them gave fast chase while the rat squeaked and shouted as loud as it could manage, staying just inches ahead of Tony’s flashing claws.
The lights from the village were visible through the trees for several hours before they started seeing signs of habitation. Steve’s stomach was trying to eat its way through his ribs, and Tony had become steadily crankier as the night had worn on. The first moon had already set, and though its absence had made the sky seem darker, the air somehow smelled like morning was fast on the approach.
the big kangaroo commented.
been removed. Slugging back the last of his whiskey, he set the cup on the tiny table, and sauntered across the room. Steve’s eyes widened as he realized that Tony knew what he’d been unable to ask.
Steve’s jaw clenched. He met Tony’s eyes defiantly. “And what is it that you want? To hold

“Like an overgrown golden retriever chasing the sprinkler,” Tony muttered.
is a dream,” Tony protested weakly.
Steve laid down as soon as the last of the kittens had been dug out from their secure hammock of the underside of his shirt. The rest of the kittens were gathered off his back, but Steve stayed on his belly for a while. He set his head between his paws and just watched the commotion as kittens were loaded into the kangaroo’s pouch, carried by the scruff, or urged onto the backs of dogs of all shapes and sizes. Above them, birds cawed what sounded like encouragement.
, I think.”
They followed Moonlight and her excited gaggle of pups into the house, leaving the excited whispers of the villagers behind them.
of all people? Tony liked her – they’d more-or-less grown up together, but he couldn’t imagine her on a submarine.
“When I first found you…” Steve trailed off uncertainly. That was different. The Steve Tony knew didn’t do uncertain. Tony was pretty sure that Steve’s answer to uncertain was ‘punch it in the face until it dies.’ This Steve’s entire body radiated uncertainty, anxiety, maybe a touch of fear.
Steve’s jaw clenched. “Right. Wouldn’t want to pass up the chance to fuck a national icon.”
the elegant dog said after a few moments of the interrogation. “Leave the cat alone.”
“Y-es,” Steve panted when he remembered to answer Tony’s question. “Just not for a while.”
He realized.
he added, as if this would lend further weight to his claim.
Moonlight’s head went back, obviously startled by the suggestion, but a flash of motion grabbed her attention before she could reply. She stood up, dislodging the hopeful puppies into a pile of squirming limbs, and walked regally past Steve into the road. Steve turned to follow her progress, and found a group of mixed dogs, cats, and what looked like mice trooping into the village. A pair of birds swooped overhead, cawed, and then disappeared into the trees.
“Looks like a human, but how it possible?” Another familiar-not-familiar voice said. Hank Pym in the red and blue skin-tight costume of Ant Man… or Giant Man, though it didn’t make sense that he could be both when they were contradictory monikers. High Pockets, Tony’s dream memory offered, and Blue Eyes, though the pet names aren’t his own. He remembered Jan van Dyne’s voice supplying them all, and why would it be
Steve said.
Steve stepped away and just looked down at him. His face was impossible to read, chest rising and falling steadily while Tony squirmed in an effort to get comfortable.
Tony snorted. “Nice show. I’m assuming all of this is to put me at ease so I won’t go looking for whatever spy equipment you didn’t take away?”
The boat slowed as they approached the beach, and two figures in the front jumped out to pull the boat up the shore. Tony lurched again as the hull scraped over the black sand. They anchored it to the ice and two of the puffy winter-gear figures stayed behind with the boat while Tony was jostled into the center of the rest of the group. Tony’s thighs trembled and his stomach hallowed out. He felt weak and cold through the core.
“Are you going to get up?” Steve asked.
“Seems like our wants are compatible.”
“Okay.” If it had been anyone else, Tony might have looked at his watch to point out that it was after 8 at night, and it was a conversation that they could be having in twelve hours or more. If it had been anyone else, Tony might have picked up his pen and gotten back to work just to let them know that he was busy, and his time was valuable. Tony just waited, because it wasn’t anyone else– it was Steve, and goddamnit, but Tony was still stupidly in love with him.
“Watch your six, Cap,” Tony warned. He wished Steve would just get onto the opposite side of the dangerous puddle of

, Tony thought, annoyed. Never mind the temperature of the water, or physics, or the ridiculous notion that Hank could change the size of his body (The Hulk, Tony’s dream-memory reminded him in a nauseating explosion of images: himself in a giant suit of armor begging the Hulk to go to sleep (what?) and Bruciebear tearing through his clothing as he turned green, and the Hulk leap-frogging over buildings, punching a giant sky-worm (what the
“Take. Your hands. Off of him,” Tony said in a low, growling voice.
“Are you free on Friday?” he asked so softly that Tony barely heard him over the TV.
“Because you
Tony thought about challenging him, but subsided. They were in dangerous territory, and neither of them had ever been able to step back from a confrontation. Even when they’d been good together, they’d played off each other like fire and oil. Tony let his arm relax, and Steve wrapped the belt once around the buckle, protecting Tony’s wrist from the bite of it. Tony wondered briefly at the consideration, but it was Steve. Even when it was someone he so obviously hated, Tony didn’t think he was capable of intentionally harming a sex partner. At least not without permission.
They fumbled together in the darkness, Steve’s hands skating carefully over Tony’s body like he was looking for each of the bruises. Under the alcohol, the pressure of his touch on each sore spot felt almost good, but he wasn’t in the mood to be coddled. He finally knocked Steve’s hands away, and leaned out of his reach.
When they eventually separated for air, Steve was panting. His pupils had blown open so wide that there was only the thinnest rim of blue around the edges, and his erection pressed hard against the fabric of his suit. Tony boldly put a hand over it and pushed. Steve’s mouth dropped open and he curled his body like he was trying to trap Tony’s hand against him, but then pushed helplessly forward. Tony bit at his ear, and then turned his hand over to use his knuckles to massage Steve’s cock through the fabric. Judging by how little was between them, Tony guessed that he was commando under the uniform, and wasn’t that fun?
“Where are you, Tony?” Bruce asked, his voice suddenly soft and sad.
“You’re not a coward, Tony,” Steve said softly.
