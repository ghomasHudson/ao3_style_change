“When did you plan on telling me, before or after we slept together and I accidentally bit you?” He said angrily.
"I know you probably just got your soulmate tattoo. But it might be years before you meet them. And. . . . They'll never know. So why shouldn't you have a little fun? After all, it's your birthday party. "
"Dean! What kind of question is that? You've been through so much together, you're true mates, he wears your mating bite and you wear his. Why the hell wouldn't he want to marry you?" Sam could only wonder.
Greedily, Cas drew him closer and kissed him hard. Dean‘s hands clung helplessly into Cas hair.
Even if he didn't like admitting it, Cas missed his roommate like crazy. It was bad coming home after a hard day and the room smelled. . . strange. Just not like home. He knew Gabriel was right. Dean and he had scent bonded. However, he also knew that this had not happened intentionally and Dean was certainly not happy about it.
Fuck! Two weeks. There went his job at Benni’s garage.
It was exactly fifteen days after the incident when Benny visited Cas at the library.
Dean showed Benny's roommate the note. Gabriel shook his head in disbelief.
"Cas, stop it. You don't have to apologize. I don't want to know how many times you've heard me. I should apologize to you", Dean muttered.
”Yeah, they said it was my mating gift and also a gift for Dean for saving my life."
Dean heard the clapping of skin to skin and Cas' needy moans in every room. There was no escape. Not even in the farthest guestroom. It was the most horrible experience in his whole life and it made him feel sick. He wanted to go into the bedroom and drag away the Service Alpha from Cas so badly, but he couldn't. Not in Cas present condition. His heat was very bad this time and they were waiting much too long. Dean wanted to call the Omega Service much sooner, but Cas had stopped him. Of course, he knew how much Dean suffered when they had to call for a service.
Dean was glad they finally changed the subject. For the next hour, they were occupied to plan everything. The only problem was where they should get the beer but Charlie's mom helped them and agreed to buy it if they promised not to drink the harder stuff.
With a deep moan, Dean opened his mouth to deepen the kiss. When Cas started to grind against Deans groin, the Alpha knew he was lost.
“Cas….” Dean asked a bit louder.
“No! Oh, my God. I am so sorry Cas. Of course, helping me is the last thing you would want to do…” Dean wasn't even able to look Cas in the eye.
“I am packing my things. My flight leaves in three hours.”
Dean laughed. So that's why Crowley was here. They were all afraid that he could have told the police.
„I told you that I don’t want an Alpha Service!“ Dean answered angrily.
“Please, promise me you’ll take care of him. I beg you, Charlie. He will need a friend.”
What did Sam mean? Why should he use the blockers again?
Sam choked. „Please don’t kiss! I wouldn’t survive it! You are so cute together it’s gross!”
Dean knew he'd have to spend his savings to pay for the tattoo. Actually, he wanted to use the money for new tires. But that would have to wait. Maybe he could do some extra shifts at the garage.
Five minutes later she knocked on his door. It was a good thing that she didn't live far away.
Oh, the other man was in a hurry to get away. Wow, that hurt. Although it shouldn't be a surprise.
“I am sorry Mr Novak. You must excuse my wife. She is a hopeless romantic and firmly believes in the principle of soulmates. Which is probably because we are soulmates ourselves. " John said apologetically.
What the fuck?
Now he had his answer. Cas was on top.
With triumph in his eyes, Sam looked at his brother.
"What does that mean exactly? Is there a way to get the tattoo back or not?" Dean wanted to know impatiently.
"Yes, for the first time in my life I'm doing really well. I feel like I'm finally who I was meant to be, and I have Cas... Can you believe that we are true mates?"
“Ahh, Cas,… Oh God! Cas… Cas…” Dean tried to muffle his sounds a little bit but he wasn’t sure he did a good job, because his orgasm hit him so hard, it was nearly impossible to do anything else than to repeat his soulmates name.
A glance at the clock told her that it was almost 6 pm. Oh! They were supposed to be at Ellen and Bobby's barbecue at 6. Damn it! That would be close. She had been so lost in thought that she almost missed the time. Jody quickly grabbed her keys and her jacket and stood up.
By the time they finally got to Dean's house, it was already afternoon.
It was awfully hard to get used to Cas's look, so polite and somehow unapproachable. For a moment Dean wondered what would happen if it didn't work out if Cas remained numb. Would Dean still try to stay close to him, or would it be too painful?
"Oh, my God, Dean. Have you gone completely insane? The man needs you now, not in four or five years. "
"I'm sorry I'm so direct, Jo, but even a blind man can see you're in love with Dean. Your chances are good. He likes you, that's for sure. And at the end of the day, he wants a beta, not an omega, even if it's his True Mate. "
"Oh, I... I don't want to disturb. . . . . I... " The teacher stammered
“Oh yeah. I know some news. You are an asshole.”
But before he was even back in bed, his phone vibrated.
“I will, Charlie. And… thanks”
Meanwhile, Dean put the bowl with the salad, a plate of garlic baguette and a bottle of water on a tray and looked at Cas.
“ Cas, you're shaking all over your body. What has happened?”
Cas let the tube drop to the floor. His eyebrows were furrowed questioningly, and when he looked at Dean his eyes turned sparkling, dark, and predatory.
The next days went by in a blur. Maybe it was because of the hormones, or because of the fact that his father betrayed him or it was because he lost Cas, but with every passing day, he got more and more depressed.  Sam tried to talk with him about Cas a few times, but Dean refused to even think about the Omega.
Dean changed his position to get a better look at Cas. The movement squeezed Cas' knot and ...oh fucking hell. This felt so good.
I really really enjoy reading them. <3   <3   <3
Exhausted Castiel crushed on his bed. He was all knocked out and was just happy that he could finally close his eyes. He didn't even want to continue reading his book tonight. Tired, he reached for the light switch of the bedside lamp and wanted to turn it off when his eyes fell on the red folder in his open bag. Fuck! He'd forgotten all about that. He promised Mrs Bradbury he'd read the paper. For a brief moment he thought about reading it through quickly the next morning, but then he decided against it. With a deep sigh, he rose again and went back to the desk. Reluctantly Cas fished the portfolio out of the bag. He could only hope that the essay wasn't too long because it was hard for him to keep his eyes open at all, let alone concentrate on a text. But when he saw the front page, he became curious because it didn't reveal anything. It was just an empty white sheet of paper. He turned the page quickly. To his astonishment, he noticed that the next page was crumpled and someone had tried to smoothe it out again. Cas had the feeling that someone pulled it out of a bucket. The next thing he immediately noticed was that this was not Mrs Bradbury's handwriting. He had already read some of her texts and would have recognized her ornate letters immediately. That was odd.
When Dean bottomed out, he stopped moving because he knew Cas would need some time to adjust.
"So, enjoy your meal!" she said. Castiel felt bad that her cheerfulness got a little bit on his nerves. Of course, Mary was in a good mood! Her eldest son was celebrating his eighteen birthday. She must have been so proud..
Gabriel grinned maliciously.
He pushed down his jeans and showed Charlie the tattoo.
His back was arching from the mattress, his inner walls were clenching and clearly, there wasn’t enough breath in his lungs and his brain. He was crying Cas name again and again and Jesus fucking Christ! This was so intense!
Goddamn it! That was exactly why he kept it a secret! He didn't need Dean's consideration and compassion. That only made things worse!
"Dean..."
“Don’t you dare! Don’t you fucking dare to tell me you did this to prevent me from anything!”
„I know you have to. I know. And I wish you luck. Both of you.“
I really hope you will enjoy this chapter. Things get a little bit dramatic.... ^.^
Sam cleared his throat.
It was pathetic!
Dean could tell despite his drunk state that Cas was angry. He wanted to kiss him so badly. . .
Somehow everything was less embarrassing than Cas had imagined; it was even pleasant. As Dean caressed his back, Cas smelled Dean's neck and rubbed his belly. It was nice, to be honest. It took about half an hour until Cas’ knot went down and they were able to separate. As soon as they had put on their wet clothes in preparation for going into the house, the car for the carcass recycling company entered the yard.
Dean went back to the stove to finish dinner.
Dean knew there was a logical explanation behind all this, but his brain wasn't capable of putting all the pieces together.
"Yes, this is for you. I know how awful hospital coffee is. Think of it as a matting gift. " Sam grinned and handed the bag and the mugs to Dean.
“No.. yes. I…” Cas was stumbling.
***Dean***
“How many male Omegas do you know, Dean?”
“Yes Cas, I am!” Dean answered determined.
“Cas, I love you so much. You have no idea how much I missed you…” Dean said, his voice hoarse.
“Challenge accepted, Cas.”
"You want me to skip school again?" Dean wanted to know, frowning at his friend.
What was that supposed to mean?
Charlie laughed.
Cas was standing there. His expression was furious and… oh god, he looked so beautiful. Even if there were dark shadows under his eyes, even if he wasn’t shaved, even if he lost some weight… And then Dean smelled it. Cas’ scent wasn’t nice like Emma’s, it was intoxicating. Dean wanted more, no he needed more.
“Please, Dean!” He begged, not knowing if he should focus on the soft warmth of Deans mouth or the stretching burn of his fingers.
"Do you need anything else, Master?" The servant looked at Dean questioningly.
The smell of panic spread throughout the room.
“Dean…I…”
Fuck!
And why did everything in him want to kiss away that wounded expression on the Omegas face? Desperately Dean drove his hand through his hair. The sooner he got rid of those unwanted feelings, the better.
His father took off his fire cap and drove his hands nervously through his hair. Only now did Dean realize that his father was still in his fireman uniform. He hadn't even gone home to change. So this was more serious than Dean's mind wanted it to be.
Dean had difficulties to breathe. He was leaking precome and he felt his orgasm built.
Probably the farm should have already burned back then. It was pure coincidence that nothing more had happened. And Dick had made it very clear that he wanted to buy Castiel's ranch.
“I just cut myself with the knife. It’s nothing…”
"Dean's Dad won't let the Male Omega Care Organization into their house. Since there are no more Omegas in Dean's family, Sam would be on his own. I'm sure it's not easy without someone who understands you, who tells you what to do. No one expected him to be an Omega."
"You mean I should go home with Dean to help his little brother?"
Oh, sweet Jesus! This would be over pretty damn fast. Dean spat in his hand and wrapped it around both of their hard lengths. Cas started to suck on his neck were he bit him the first time they had sex. It still felt amazing when the other Alpha touched the sensitive spot. One of Castiel's hands was stroking through Dean's hair, and the other joined Dean's hand around their cocks. Together they found a rhythm. Dean couldn't help but look at their fingers moving together. He recognized that Cas' knot was already forming and squeezed it with the other hand.
“No! He would never let me go and I’m not sure if I would be strong enough to leave. I have to go now.”
Now we go just a bit back in time to look at Cas point of view.
"...but you think Dick might have something to do with it," Cas finished the sentence.
Fuck, Dean was no virgin but he never had gay sex. So Cas had much more experience.
He quickly lubed up two fingers and impatiently pushed them into his waiting hole. After only a few trusts, he added a third finger. He was already so close.
“Mr Novak for how long have you known Mr Winchester?”
“I am feeling like I am getting a cold, but apart from that everything is fine. I’m looking forward to Thanksgiving. You are coming home, aren’t you?”
“Now don’t kill the mood and come here soulmate!” Dean ordered bossy.
"Oh. . . okay. . . " was all John said.
Sam explained the situation and watched in awe when Cas grew more and more angry.
To be honest. Dean was very proud of Castiel as well. He had managed this situation with bravo.
To make his statement even clearer, he leaned down, slowly tracing Castiel’s scent gland with his tongue. It was a bold move but Dean was getting a little impatient here. Something sweet filled his nostrils. It was a mixture of lemongrass and the smell of salty seaside. Amazing!
He couldn’t have heard that right, could he?
"No, I bit you, but...but there is no bond between us. We're not true mates." He knew that Dean would hear the disappointment in his voice. Saying it out loud hurt more than Cas was willing to admit. But why? Why did he want the boy to be his true mate so badly? It was ridiculous. Cas had never been overly romantic.
Happily he smiled at the other Alpha next to him. Even now they were holding hands. The two were so disgustingly in love, it was really cute.
“Dean is my new employee,” Cas told Balthazar everything. About the fire, about Dean's work at the farm and about the confusing fact that he was able to smell his feelings.
„Wow, wow, easy tiger. I am sure I don’t wanna see your dick!”
He forced himself to listen to Lisa and ignore Cas. He even managed to flirt a little with Lisa. But then he looked back at the place where Cas was supposed to be and. . . he was gone. Both, Cas and the Alpha girl were gone. Dean felt panic rising inside him. Damn it! Where were they going so fast? If they had gone upstairs, they would have had to pass him. Dean would've noticed. So they could only have gone in the kitchen or outside.
Dean met Sam and Cas at the bar.  Sam looked at him in surprise when he stepped out of the car.  “She must have not been too thrilled about that,” he said as Dean walked up.
“Awesome.  Yeah, I’ll be right over.”
Sam nodded and motioned to the chair across from him.  Sam kept Cas busy until it was time to go.
Dean approached, glaring down at the man with stone cold wrath.  He kept his gun trained on the man’s chest.  “Hello.”
“Sure.”
Dean hesitantly followed Sam in.
Sam caught the hint and left.
“But what if he doesn’t come back, Dean?  Maybe it’s just over for him?”
Cas happily returned the embrace.
The shot went off and the man sprawled forward on the ground.  “You can come out now,” Dean murmured, “He can’t hurt you anymore.”
Sam turned to Dean, “Well, at least that means we can leave.  We might want to come back after they close though.”  He looked around.  “This place is definitely sketchy.”
“Fine, Cas and I will use these.  You can go be a good law abiding citizen.”  Dean grabbed Cas' hand and dragged him off to one of the games.  Dean wasted no time and quickly taught Cas how to use the stringed quarter.
Dean shook Cas awake.  “I can’t believe you fell asleep on the book.”
Dean scoffed at him.  “Get your own.”
“Well, he made me wonder...how you really feel about me.”
Dean realized it was the first thing Cas had said since he’d showed up.  “Yeah, and it means their nest is likely nearby.”  Dean now had something to look for and went back to his own search.  He finally found what he was looking for in the storage closet.  He pried up the floorboards revealing a tunnel.  A ladder secured to one side led down into the darkness.  “I think I found it,” Dean called to his companions.
Cas shrugged.  “The third one, I guess.”
“Want anything, Cas?” he asked over his shoulder.
"I agree with you, Sam. Only Dean is unconvincing."
Dean let go of Cas cock and started to lick between his butt cheeks. He spread them with relish and drove his tongue around the rim of the hole. Oh, God, this would be his end. There was a rush in his ears, his heart was beating so fast.
Five more months, Dean thought. Then he would never see this man again and there would n’t be anything left to remind him of his soulmate. He didn’t know whether the thought calmed him or frightened him.
Cas was scenting him like...like mates did?
„Dean, maybe you should talk to him,“ Charlie said with a very serious face.
"Have you met Dad lately?" Dean wanted to know when he and Sam were alone in Ellen and Bobby's dining room. Everyone else was busy preparing dinner.
Oh, Lord! Could his stupid heart just stop beating so fast? Please! What did he do to the universe to deserve being attracted to the biggest player of the whole campus?
"Yeah, Dean was taking Mary to Bobby's garage to pick up our car. A few days ago, the car suddenly broke. But thank God Bobby was able to fix it. We really wouldn't  have any money for a new one right now." John explained.
“Fuck! Cas! You…you are an Omega! Fuck, fuck, fuck! How is this even possible?”
Cas didn't know what to do. Of course, he wasn’t unaffected by Balthazar's kisses and words. And he was terribly horny. For days! He just hadn't allowed himself to do anything about it because he was afraid that Dean would sneak into his thoughts.
“No, everything is fine. Thanks. I hope this is the last wave. It’s exhausting. How can you stand this every three months?”
Was he blushing? Maybe he was a virgin. Although, Dean couldn’t really imagine, because come on… This guy was really hot!
He took the vase to fill it with water from the nearby water well. Then he placed everything at the grave.
The Omega let himself slide to the floor, his head supported in both hands. He trembled with tears.
Cas took him firmly in his arms and kissed his forehead.
Dean started to take off his jeans but Charlie raised her hands defensively.
„No, not usually. But your case is different. It was your first rut with your true mate after every hormone in your body was suppressed for years. So I think it’s quite normal for someone like you to have an extraordinary long first rut.” Dr Crowley explained.
“Sam told you Dean is in California. So I am going to look for him. I’m going mad here.”
„Dean, fate won’t ask you. And you are not right. There are many couples out there who live happily ever after.“ Sam was talking to him like he was a four-year-old.
"Never do such a thing again, you hear, never! I've almost gone mad with worry!" Dean muttered into Castiel's neck.
Dean remembered exactly one conversation when he was sixteen. He was in love for the first time in his life. Amanda Heckerling was an omega and her parents didn’t want her daughter to be together with Dean. The whole thing ended with Amanda withdrawing from him more and more, leaving Dean heartbroken. He could still remember his father's words when he found him crying in his room.
“That’s a shame. So I think we should repeat these things as soon as possible when we are at home!” Cas suggested while stealing another kiss from Dean.
"You. . . . You two had sex yesterday, didn't you? I went upstairs because Dean didn't come back for so long, and then I… I heard you. " She didn't look at him, but just by her posture Cas realized how hurt she was. Pity spread through him. He knew how much it hurt to love Dean Winchester.
Jesus! This was heaven! Or hell! Or both! Cas had to concentrate not to come right there.
„Go away, Dad!“ Sam said.
Dean was confused and a little alarmed.
"You don't understand ..." Dean answered.
“Maybe you meant well, but what you did was terrible. Goodbye, Dad.”
“Hey, mom.” Dean tried to sound as normal as possible.
“I hope you don’t mind. Your new fellow is a beta. There was no other option.” Donna mumbled with her mouth full.
“That means you will meet your soulmate soon. Wow, that’s exciting!”
Jo made herself comfortable on the couch and turned on the TV while Dean went upstairs with a cheeseburger, chips and a glass of orange juice. First, he knocked on Sam's door.
Pills? What was this about? Cas was confused?
This knowledge has been passed down from generation to generation and saved the family from being discovered. However, Mary had never paid too much attention to it, as she herself had never been dependent on the herbs. In a society like the one they were living in, all instincts were frowned upon. And since people with a second gender were sometimes exposed to their instincts if they did not suppress them with herbs, these people were considered unreliable and weak. As a result, tenants left the land and the fields remained uncultivated, business partners withdrew and engagements were broken when someone turned out to be more than just human. In short: a life as a gentleman or a lady was not possible. This led to no lucrative business, no good marriage, and all descendants lost any of the prestige associated with the family name. So it was no wonder that Lady Mary's family had been busy keeping their little secret for generations.
“What the fuck? I didn’t…”
“Fucking idiot!” Sam cried.
"Not helpful! You're supposed to be my mental support and not drag me down ... After all, you're my best friend. Listen Chalie, I can't just knock on his door and tell him that I'm his soulmate. Of course, he would kick me out. I removed our soulmate tattoo. Fuck! I would if I was him. I feel so stupid. But I have to do something. "
Instantly Cas deepened the kiss as his hands began to slip under Dean's T-shirt.
Goddammit! This felt so good and they were both so hard. Dean was about to explode and they hadn't even started yet!
“Mr Novak!”
The prospect of Cas going home with him calmed him down immediately.
"What happened? "he wanted to know.
During dinner, Dean was remarkably quiet, but no one dared to ask him why because everyone could imagine what was on his mind. Even if there was a reason to hope, they didn’t know if it really worked.   They all knew that there still was no certainty now. According to Sam's research, there were enough cases in which a full rejection could only be partially reversed.
Dean swallowed and shook his head. No! Of course not. There was no universe where he was able to think about his little brother using sex toys.
No! Of course not! What did he think?
“John, this isn’t right. It’s weird that someone doesn’t want to meet their soulmate.”
"No, don't worry. I didn't say anything. Although it was really a dick move of you guys to just walk away without me, so I got caught. " Dean said.
"Hello, Mr Winchester. I'm Dr Crowley, and this is your nurse Rowena." He looked at the patient file and studied it briefly.
“Thank you!” Cas said.
"Thank . . . thank you, that's very thoughtful. . . . "
Ten minutes after the doctor left, Sam excused himself to leave as well. As soon as he was in the hallway he called Cas and asked him to come to the hospital. Cas arrived only half an hour later.
„Do you want to do me or the other way round?” Balthazar asked breathlessly. Cas had no particular preference. Mostly they took turns. But now he wanted to be at the receiving end. He wanted to give Balthazar control.
After a few hours or maybe after only ten minutes the door opened and the nurse entered the room together with the doctor. Both scented the air in surprise. Cas knew that true mates emitted pheromones during their mating which warned others not to come closer. Too easily misunderstandings could arise and a couple could feel threatened by the additional smell of another Alpha or Omega. There had been cases where this had led to fights and injuries. So he wasn't surprised when the nurse immediately turned around.
“Yes, I am. I won’t let him go without a fight. Maybe we will break up in the end but he has to look at me and tell me face to face that he doesn’t want me anymore.”
“Is that so?” Dean teased to lighten up the mood. “But I planned to have a shower after breakfast…”
Jesus! What had happened to his voice?
Cas did quick work with his own clothes. He had to feel his soulmates skin. Now!
When he switched on his cell phone for the first time in three weeks, his fingers trembled.
Somehow he would survive this year. He had to.
Benny looked at him with a strange expression but he nodded.
Dean nearly lost it there and then when he saw Cas hungry gaze.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Gabriel? What did Gabriel have to do with this?
At least since the night two days ago, when Cas, for the first time in all these years, had brought someone home, Dean was sure it was more to it. It was just after midnight, and Dean himself had only recently returned from a movie night with Charlie. Suddenly he heard the key in the lock of the front door. Dean was surprised and pleased that Cas was home so early, so he wanted to ask Cas if he wanted to have another beer with him.
When they were in Deans room, both of them looked at each other. Dean hadn't often thought about mating in his life, actually, it was exactly what he always wanted to prevent. But if he had imagined it in weak moments, then certainly not like this.
Dean was only five years old at that time but thank God he understood the seriousness of the situation. He grabbed his brother and ran outside. When he noticed that his mother was not in front of the house, he wanted to run inside again to get her. Maybe she was still sleeping, he thought. But neighbours held him back.
Dean nodded, then followed the doctor into the office.
“Approximately an hour ago.”
“Cas, move!” Sam shouted as he ran into the room, gun in hand.
Dean looked at him in the mirror.  “Are you ok?  You’ve been awfully quiet lately.”
Miss Peregrine moved aside and let the hunters through.
Cas nodded.
Dean put the fork away and pressed his hand briefly over Cas‘.
When he came back to the stable a few minutes later, Cas was on the phone. Cas now stood away from the carcass to face Dean, seemingly more composed again.
"Hey, Clarence! I've tried calling you a few times. I have something really funny to tell you. "
“I don’t understand. Why is this important?”
"I'm sure the calf will make it, Cas. We will make sure that it will." Dean assured him and patted a hand on the rancher's shoulder.
Hannah raised an eyebrow in surprise.
When he finally bottomed out he let out a shaky breath.
„Yes, I did. And if you don’t want me to leave you right now in the middle of your rut, I would suggest you bit me back, asshole!“
„He was in a complete turmoil when he came to our room. Said he tried to rape you.“
With her arms crossed in front of her chest, she looked at him expectantly. Not for the first time Dean had no desire to deal with her jealous behaviour. He wanted to talk to Cas and not argue with Lisa! He wanted to know that his friend was okay. And he wanted to assure Cas that nothing was going to change between them. Even if Dean didn't love Cas like that, he would always be his friend. At least if Cas wanted that too. Fuck! What if Cas didn't want that? What if Cas wanted Dean to move out now? The idea made him shiver.
"Yeah, sure thing. You could offer me a cup of tea instead, Lisa. " Benny answered with a smirk on his lips.
I hope you are not too upset with me because of what happens in this chapter. But I promise I will make it up to you ^.^
"I am Castiel. Usually, I'm not a party animal but a friend forced me to come. Now she is flirting with her crush and I am all alone, watching Dean Winchester and his new flame. Pathetic, isn’t it?
Dean wasn’t able to repress the tears from falling down his cheeks. There was no way to stop them. Of course, he fucked up big time, like Sam said because there was no universe where Dean Winchester would live happily ever after with something like a true mate. And of course, it was his fault. He should have talked to Cas about his fear to love someone, about ending up like his father. But like always he wasn’t able to use his words. And so Cas didn’t look for a note. He just assumed Dean rejected him.
It was already the second night where Cas was alone in his bed and he didn't like it at all. Everything felt wrong. The bed smelled too little like Dean anymore and everything was cold and empty. After Dick Roman's appearance, Dean had withdrawn. Or maybe Cas had withdrawn and Dean had just reacted. Cas wanted to talk to Dean about everything so bad, but he didn't know how. The problem wasn't that he thought Dean had anything to do with the fire on the neighbouring farm. He also knew Dean wasn't just using him to ease his workload. The boy worked as hard as Castiel himself. Sometimes even harder!
Oh God! This would be a very very long year.
Frightened, the beta girl looked at him and blushed. "I... "
Cas scent got angry and Jo also didn't seem happy about Cas's presence.
Maybe it was stupidly dangerous not to let Dean in anyway, even though Jody disagreed. If the boy knew about their speculation, he might be able to defend himself better if they intended to blame him for everything. Cas got up and ran after Dean.
His inner omega recoiled even before Cas could react. Hadn’t he used scent blockers, she would be able to smell his rejection at least now. Castiel was about to gently pull away when he heard a furious growl behind him.
"Which we can't prove, Dean. As hard as it is, your father's right. We have to wait. "
Cas sat up and looked around the room. The tray with the burger from the night before was still on the desk. With a sigh, the Omega stood up and went into the bathroom to take a shower. Somehow he wondered why he wasn't desperate, why he wasn't sad that Dean didn't want him. But he just felt numb. Like he's in a dream. It was weird. He put on jeans and a T-shirt and went down to the kitchen. He had to admit that he was very hungry by now. Besides, maybe he should bring some food to Sam as well. For sure the Omega had a rough night.
Sadly also for the fire at the Winchesters' house.
“Is he at Sam’s place? Or is he at his father’s house?”
“We both know that you can’t resist me forever, Cas. So how about we cut all this and come to the fun part. I’m sure we both can use this to our advantage. I would even give you a part of the money from the bet with Gabriel. What do you think?”
Dean could smell Cas slick and it almost drove him crazy.
“Dean,” Cas groaned and fucking hell, the other man sounded as wrecked as Dean felt.
"Do you think the cow will make it?" Dean asked carefully.
"Okay. I have to finish correcting these book interpretations here, and then I meet Mrs Johnsen for lunch, but I can read it tonight. Do you want me to correct mistakes?"
She was interrupted by the Omegas phone ringing. He didn’t know the number but there was always hope it could have been Dean.
"Two male Omegas under my roof. It's an honour, Castiel."
“Oh! Oh… uhm ok. Yeah, I would like that.”
“You only wanted to see me in your clothes,” Cas replied.
Dean would have liked to hear what the rest of the conversation, but Charlie pulled him away relentlessly.
Cas: Night Meg!
Cas captured his lips again but before the kiss could get too heated the two policemen came in to start their interview with Dean and Cas left.
The Omega was concentrating on patching up Dean’s injured finger.
He bucked his hips to draw in the fingers deeper.
"Was that the reason why she was here?" he asked.
The poor secretary blushed even more. In another life, Dean wouldn’t have thrown this chance away. Lisa was beautiful, funny and clearly interested. But this was still his old life. Even though he had moved away from Lawrence for miles, this didn’t change the fact that for him there was only Cas. And this fact would perhaps never change.
This chapter is beta-read by the lovely @thatwasamazing. Thank you so much, honey!
He hoped that no one would be at home and he could sneak into his room without anyone noticing, but unfortunately Mary Winchester was unpacking groceries in the kitchen.
"Oh, my God!" Ellen screamed, "We have to celebrate. Jo, get the champagne out of the fridge, please!"
“I thought we could move at the end of next week. We could come back here for a few days before College starts if you want.”
"No, there are hundreds of pills for house dust allergies. Unfortunately, Relevium does not help against allergies, Mr Winchester. It is one of the strongest suppressants on the market, licensed especially for alphas that have lost their true mate. "
Dean shook his head.
The woman clicked her tongue and walked away.
Dean shook his head and shifted his weight.  “Nothing.  I don’t know,” he mumbled.
“I’ll go with Dean,” Cas said.
him I was taken but I didn’t think it would hurt.  I got up to leave and after that...I don’t know what happened after that.”
Dean bolted upright, snatching his gun from under his pillow.  He dropped it when he saw Cas standing over him.  “Jesus, Cas!  Don’t do that.”
The kisses stopped.  Dean opened his eyes  “What is it?”
“This is the game of hunters.  How did you think we got our spending money?”
“Well have you got a name?”
Cas nodded and put his hand on the safe.  Blue-white light surged around Cas and the lights flickered.  The safe blew open with a crack and Cas powered down.  He reached in and pulled out a bunch of newspapers.  He unfolded them and showed it to the others.
“Everything hurts.”
Dean pulled into the parking lot.  “A psychiatrist?”
“Justice is not for you to decide!”  Takhar rushed at them, wooden claws aimed to tear through them.
Dean nodded.  “I hope so.  I really wish demons would stop getting angel blades.”
<3   <3   <3
Dean’s hand was flying over his dick. Fuck he was so close, so fucking close.
Dean gasped! Cas was breathing hard.
"Come on, Dean. It wouldn't change anything. He would still be your soulmate. "
Dean sighed.
He felt the wave of excitement that reached him through the bond. Fuck! If this wasn't doing things to him. . .
Fuck! How could he ever think he was straight? The imagination that it wasn't his fingers that forcefully thrust in and out his hole, but Cas cock, was more arousing than anything he had ever experienced in his life or seen in porn.
„You should turn around. It would be easier for you…“
"No problem, Mr Winchester. I am glad to help. " Cas replied with a smile.
The feeling of Cas' finger inside of him was strange but so good, and it became even better when Cas used his other hand to stroke his dick. Dean felt himself slowly relaxing as Cas pushed his finger in deeper and deeper. After a while, he started to thrust in and out. And when the other Alpha inserted a second finger and thrusted deeply, he must have touched Dean's prostate because immediately Dean's whole body was in flames.
“Mr Novak you are listed as Mr Winchester’s first emergency call. He had a car accident and...”
“Come on, Sam! You never saw us together. How would you know that, huh? I am sure he doesn’t care about me. So, let’s eat breakfast. Also, you should have a shower and I will change the sheets…”
So, the story is finished. What's missing is an epilogue. So if you want to know how everyone gets back to Milton Castle and meets Jack and Gabriel and how Cas deals with Mr Roche, maybe you should come back on Sunday.  ^.^
"An accident?" Ellen asked.
"No, you're absolutely right, Dean, I really don't understand. Explain it to me."
"You are a saint! Thank you! I could use a good cup of coffee. Two cops want to interview me right now. I think it's about Dad. "
"What? No ... I didn’t say that, I ... "
"Dean, I can't take this anymore. I need you.  I need you so much. "
“Good!” Dean said and smashed their lips together again.
So Cas bared his neck. Dean took a deep breath and closed the gap between them. He licked over Cas scent glands, sad that he didn’t smell anything of the Omegas intoxicating scent and then he bit down until he tasted blood. It took all his self-control not to go down on his knees.
How could he ever think Dean would have left him? But even if he wanted nothing more at this moment than to belong to this man, to love him again, he couldn’t do this. There was a fifty per cent chance that the Alpha would suffer until his death. No way!
Fuck! He was so screwed. So fucking screwed!
"What do you mean?" the younger Alpha wanted to know.
“Sam, what’s the matter. Is anything all right with Dean? God, you scared me to death.”
"Jesus, I never thought you'd be so inhibited. Don't tell me you never use sex toys during your rut. "
And fucking hell, Cas was gorgeous. Dean had never seen a naked Alpha before, besides himself, and he for sure never thought that the sight would arouse him. But Jesus, he had been so fucking clueless. Seeing Cas was hotter than anything he had ever experienced in his life.
"Just wait and see, Cas."
He felt Dean's fingers crossing with his own. It was so good to finally tell the truth.
"No," Cas interrupted Dean's considerations.
No! Mr Novak didn't want a soulmate. He made it very clear. So the man wouldn't get one either.
"No, we don't, but we can still meet our true love."
"Of course, I know you two are Alphas. Like I said he is gay. He likes knots. You don't really have to. . . just keep him happy. It doesn’t matter how old he is. Maybe he will be … grateful if he thinks he has a chance. You know what I mean. Just let him see. . . what he might want to see. . . " Crowley suggested cautiously.
Then Dean kissed him and the world stopped spinning.
“I must say, a clever way to bypass my instructions.” With a smile on his face, he winked at Cas who was too mortified to say something. John rolled out of the kitchen in his wheelchair still laughing and Cas couldn't believe Dean's father wasn't angry. Cas also quickly went back to his room. He sat down on the bed and positioned the laptop in front of him. Sometime during the third episode of Doctor Who he must have fallen asleep. When he woke up by a knocking on his door, he was a bit disoriented at first. The empty popcorn bowl was next to him. The tv show had continued. Apparently, he'd slept an hour and a half. Then he heard the knocking again. He rose quickly and went to the door. To his surprise it was Dean. “Dean! It's just after midnight. I have. . . “
Although Dean knew that this was the best of all possibilities, he wanted Cas to be happy, this thought almost made him cry every time.  That's why he didn't call Charlie or Sam. He didn't want to know. He just wasn't ready.
Even though Cas hated himself for it he wasn’t able to resist to glance at the other from time to time. Getting impatient Cas fixed his glasses.
It didn’t only hurt, Dean felt guilty as well. Guilty that he wasn’t able to be happy for the Omega. That he hated his true mate even if he never met him.
"Hey, Charlie," there was nothing he could do about his voice sounding surprised and hopeful.
“Dean you could lose all your happiness. I don’t want that for you.”
Dean heard what his father said, but his brain refused to process the words.
“Why? Don’t say you don’t enjoy the view?”
They positioned the laptop in front of them and decided to watch some episodes of Prison Break. Dean knew the first few seasons, but it didn't matter. It was just to get as close to Cas as possible and kill time. It was hard for Dean to just lean on Casat first because he didn't know if it was all right with the Omega, but Cas just put his hand over Dean's shoulder and pulled him closer.
"I doubt it," he replied.
Dean only nodded.
What the hell…?
Dean got up from his bed, an evil smirk playing on his lips when he approached Cas.
"It was during the English lesson. He suddenly became completely pale and looked at his hand in disbelief. After that, he left in the middle of class and a short time later Mr Crowley came and told us that Mr Novak got sick. Oh, God, Dean. You should have seen his face. I felt so sorry for him. Are you sure that this wasn't a mistake? You know I love you and I'll support you in everything you do, but right now I'm not sure if you hadn't just got Mr Novak wrong. "
So, here it is the first part of dean's POV. I hope you like it ^-^
"What does that mean for Dean?"
"What? Dean, you promised me. "
Oh God! His roommate was so right. He overstepped any and all boundaries. But he never would admit it.
This was going to be a long year!
She always said.
„Tell me what you want, Dean. I’ll give you everything,“ Cas moaned while nibbling on Dean’s ear.
"Sorry, Bela. I am not in the right mood tonight. " He apologized and pushed her hand away.
Cas took another deep breath and knocked on the door.
She presented him a red portfolio.
"And what do you think?" the boy wanted to know.
“Cas, I love you. I love you so much” Dean whispered while he kissed Cas shoulders. And Cas knew it was the truth because he could feel it through their bond.
"I'm sure we learned about all of this in biology, but we didn’t pay enough attention. And who's thinking about getting the tattoo removed anyway. . . " Charlie shook her head like she still couldn't believe Dean really did it.
"That's exactly why Dean! I don't want you to give up on anything because of me. You're my best friend, and I want you to be happy. I don't want to be a burden. You're supposed to live your life the way you want. I always knew you'd get married and have children. Family has always been important to you. It just hurt not to hear about you moving in with Lisa from you. But I will get over it. Believe me! It would just be nice. . . it would just be nice if we could stay friends" Cas declared.
“This is the smell of an unmated Omega in heat. You should try to inhale as much as possible. In a few days, your rut should start. But after you inhaled we should move you to …. to a place which is more … um …soundproofed.”
Yeah, it's Sunday and I made it on time.
Wow! That was. . . surprisingly direct… and also odd. Dean's brother thought they were True Mates. That meant Dean must have talked about him. Did Dean think they were True Mates, too? Damn it! Then why was he avoiding him? Wasn't it every Alpha or Omega's dream to meet their True Mate? Was it because Castiel was a man? But somehow Cas knew that wasn't what caused Dean's behaviour. Everyone knew Dean slept with men and women. But they were always Betas or sometimes even Alphas. So it was much more because he was an Omega. Dean was clearly not interested in having a true mate. That had to be the reason. He didn't want to commit forever. He wanted to continue his easy life. Without limitation by a mate. Because if they were to bond, Dean wouldn't be interested in it anymore. He would just want him forever. And that's probably what the Alpha wanted to prevent. Castiel was sure of that.
Bobby shook his head. “No, I have things to do.”
“No problem.  I understand.”  The man went and got them both drinks.  “Cheers,” he said as he handed one to Cas.
“You don’t trust me?  Did you hear that, Moose?  He doesn’t trust me.”
Sam walked up to the desk.  “Hi, appointment for Dean Winchester.”
“Yeah.”  Cas’ hand stopped moving and he looked up at Dean.  “Do you want me to heal these?”
“And how have you been dealing with it?”
“No, I don’t think he even knows I’m looking for him.  We had a fight and he stormed out.”
After a few minutes it was over.  The fire went out, leaving just a puddle of silver liquid behind.
Dean nodded.  “We will.  Thanks for letting us hang out here for a bit.”
“Yeah.”
Cas ran over and touched Dean’s forehead.  He could feel something growing in Dean as his lips began to turn blue.  He tried to keep Dean breathing, keeping the plant tendrils creeping out of Dean’s mouth and nose at bay with his powers.  “Hurry, Sam!”
As they headed to the door, Sam called out, “Wait!”  He turned back and went over to one of the walls.  A painting had been knocked and hung askew.  The corner of a safe was peeking out behind it.
It was a cover all counter spell.  From what Cas had said, whatever the witch had done should be covered by it.
“Alright.”  Dean snapped his phone shut and relayed the information to Cas.
“Don’t worry, I was joking.  Crowley, just, don’t stay here.  I don’t trust you not to kill us in our sleep.”
Sam pursed his lips and nodded slowly.  “Right, that’s...reasonable.”
“A bit, yeah but, it’s Cas.  He doesn’t always know what those things mean.”
Bobby nodded slowly.  “Yeah, he is.”
“Great.”  Dean and Cas joined the search for the hex bag.
“I see.”
Cas walked into the bathroom and turned on the faucet.  He gathered up his bloodied clothes and put them in the tub to soak.  He sat down heavily on the toilet and rubbed his eyes.  He stared at the swirling red water in the tub as it ran down the drain, letting awareness follow it as the thundering of pouring water surrounded him.
Cas’ blush got darker as Dean kept staring.  He looked desperately at Sam, who had come in when Dean called.  Sam just looked between him and Dean, trying very hard not to laugh as he explained the situation to Bobby over the phone.
Sam’s voice broke into Dean’s artistic trance.  “Did you sleep at all last night?"
“I, uh, lost someone a few years ago.  He thinks I’m not dealing with it well and maybe I’m not but that’s my problem.”
“I could have called and said I’d be late.”
Dean didn’t bother to wake Cas when they got there.  He simply picked him up bridal style and carried him to their room.  He laid Cas on the bed.  “There you go.”  He waited for Sam to get into bed before turning out the lights.
“You couldn’t have known what would happen, Dean.”
Dean grabbed another cue and held it out to Cas.  “Please?”
Cas nodded shakily.  “Okay.”
“Hey, can we stop somewhere first?” Sam asked as they walked out to the car.
“Oh, I doubt they are unrelated.  Luckily, the self proclaimed King of the Crossroads is our bitch.”
Cas glanced back to make sure Dean wasn’t watching him before heading towards the bathrooms and found Crowley standing against the wall.  “What are you doing back here?”
The bartender looked at the photo for a moment before shaking his head.  “No, don’t think so.”
Dean looked at the number briefly before flipping it open.  “Hello?”
“Anyone who reads the books knows you’re head over heels for Dean.  Actually, anyone who saw you two together would know that but the books are very clear.  See, Chuck knows all your little thoughts and feelings.  He also knows Dean’s.  Dean’s not nearly as straight forward.  He doesn’t know how deep his feelings run.”
Cas thought it over for a moment.  “Fine, what should I say?”
Cas glanced between Dean and Crowley.  “Sure,” he said finally.
“Okay, and why is Cas wearing your clothes?”
“Sorry, it’s just that I think it happened again.  I heard it on the radio.”
“What I’m about to say will be...wierd, but just go with it.  When I said he was an angel, I meant that literally.  When angels die, wing marks burn into whatever is behind them.  In this case, it was me.  He saw it coming.  He told me to let go but I couldn’t.  It hurt, of course, but no more than dying hurt him.”  Dean shrugged
Crowley followed Sam out the door.
Cas saw the shift on Dean’s face and began to panic.  “I’m sorry...”
Dean shrugged.  “Alright.  Can we go now?”
Before they had even left the house, Crowley turned to them.  “I think I’ll be taking my leave.”
“Cas?”  The man hesitated.  “Oh, him.  He did mention he was taken.  You picked a good toy.”
“Yeah, can’t imagine that’s the most comfortable way to sleep.  Come on, we’ve got a ghost to hunt.”
“What happened?”
Suzzie walked him out in a bathrobe.  “Hey, Dean,” she said, stopping him at the threshold, “I don’t know the situation with you and Cas, but my unsolicited advice is tell her.”
Dean squeezed his hand.  “You’re safe.”
“Of course.”
Dean started a pool game with a group of truckers and invited Cas to play.  “Come on, buddy.  I’ll teach you.”
Dean was slightly taken aback.  He reached out but hesitated.  His hand hovered over Cas’ shoulder.  “Cas, what-”
Dean rolled his eyes.  “Whatever.  I’m gonna call him and see what he knows.  Keep an eye on Cas.”  Pulling out his phone, Dean stepped outside.
“No, that was just the best I could come up with.  Did you guys believe her?”
Dean laid back down and quickly fell asleep.
“I don’t understand.  The FBI doesn’t investigate just anything shady.”
“But I did!  We had agreed to meet up.  I knew it was dangerous but I thought I would get there before him.  I was late, the demons got the jump on him, and when I got there he was on the ground, bleeding out.”
“Yeah, it was called Marble’s Arcade.”
Cas did as he was told, dropping his clothes in a soggy pile on the floor.
“Alright, I’m done.”  Dean rounded on him and forced him to his knees.  He put the gun to the back of his head.  “You really deserve worse than this but I can’t risk you surviving.”
Dean tore the pictures out of Sam’s hands.  “That was rude,” he said.  He smirked at Sam’s exasperated sigh.  “Alright, Cas, ready?” he said, tucking the pictures into his jacket.
“W-what do you want?”
Cas glanced at him.  He was several inches taller than Cas and wore a leather jacket over a gray shirt.  “I’m looking for a friend.”
“Yup,” Dean said before heading to the first bar.
They walked in and Dean told Cas what they had found the day before.  “Ghost was cremated so whatever it’s tied to, we figure, is probably in the house.”
Dean quickly covered the burn with his shirt collar.  “It’s something he left with me,” he mumbled.
“The short answer is yes.  I don’t want other people offering favors.  It screws with the job market.  If I need to help you guys to stop them, then that’s what I have to do.  It’s just business.”
Dean thought it over for a moment.  “Not a bad idea.  Any ideas to kill the time?”
Sam shrugged.  “Looked like he was made of wood.  Wood burns.”
The man struggled to his feet  “Please, I’m sorry.  I’ll give you anything.  We...we can share.”
Cas didn’t notice the stranger’s smile and nodded.  “Thank you.  Dean always said I…”  Cas’ already slow words trailed off entirely as his brain shut down and the world went dark.
Dean didn’t argue.  He put away his art and ate the crackers.  Then he followed Sam out the door and headed to the latest crime scene.
Cas winced at the touch.  “Dean…”
Crowley shrugged.  “Ask to buy him a drink. That’s usually a good place to start.”
Cas immediately realized something was wrong.
"But I promise I will help you as best I can. My brother can be a stubborn jerk, especially when he's convinced he's not good enough for someone." Sam said and he seemed to be very determined.
"Too many clothes" was all he was able to mumble.
Slowly, almost reverently, Cas brought their Soulmatetattos together, touching Dean’s inner tight with his wrist.
Cas could only laugh dryly.
”Is this okay?“ Cas asked.
After sharing a moment staring at each other through hooded eyes Dean climbed onto the bed and kissed Cas tenderly almost shy.
The doctor nodded. "Yes, almost forty-eight hours. "
He was way too close for Castiel’s liking when he leaned down to the omega. Cas was able to keep a whine from escaping his lips.
"Come on Cas. Even you must have recognized that he is damn hot! "
"Dean..." Cas moaned in his deep rough voice.
Goddammit! Dean imagined Cas's hard cock, which was probably already leaking precum.
They both started talking at once.
"You were in Lawrence? But why now?"
„Fuck, you are so tight!“ Dean heard Cas whimper.
“Could you… could you come back in a few minutes? I… I…”
Rowena shrugged her shoulders.
“How is Dean?” Sam asked without looking at Cas.
“I’m sorry! I’m so sorry, Cas. I…”
"Yeah, yeah. I'm sure if Dean were just drinking tea, we'd have one by now. "  The Alpha winked at her.
Why? Why on earth did his father do that?
„I guess, but with the blockers, it won’t have the same effect. Suppressants are only suppressing his heats, but the blockers have the effect that no one would smell him and that he doesn’t smell others as well.”
Dean didn't want to think about what could have happened! Cas could have died! The thought made him sick. Dean didn't want to live in a world where Cas didn't exist. Oh God, the very idea was unbearable!
“Yes, please. I could really use a cup of coffee right now. I wasn’t able to get much sleep in the last few weeks.“
“Oh! I nearly forgot.” Gabriel went to his desk and took his purse.
Dean wasn’t sure if his brain was working properly.
“Please Mr Novak.”
„Did… did you hear me scream or…“ Dean wasn’t able to finish the sentence. He didn’t want to get his hopes too high.
Cas sighed deeply, his shoulders sank.
He couldn't stand seeing Dean like that.
After a few minutes, he deflated disappointedly.
"Dean is already here by the way ."
„Dean! Please…“ Cas pushed his hips against Deans harder now.
Cas wanted to sit up and take a closer look, but something held him back. Only now did he realize that the weight holding him was a human being. A person who stuck his nose right into Cas's neck and inhaled Cas scent deeply and peacefully. Fuck! The blockers no longer worked! The whole room already smelled like him. If Cas didn't do something quickly, everyone on their floor would soon smell it. He tried to free himself from the clammy embrace.
"Dean! Of course, I don't hate you! I love you!  Four months isn't eternity. We can do this. "
“Dean! THAT WAS A JOKE!“
Dean grabbed him by the arm and pushed him towards the garage. There he opened the Impala and sat down on the driver's seat. Crowley sat down next to him.
“Fine. Great actually.” Dean replied still cuddled near his Omega.
So, this chapter is still Cas POV, but the next will be Dean's POV. I promise ^-^
Maybe it wasn’t wise to look at his messages in the bistro during lunch break, but after the short conversation with Lisa and a very busy morning shift, he couldn't stand it anymore. He wanted to know how Cas was doing and he wanted Sam and Charlie to know he had arrived safely in his new life.
“I am so sorry, Dean,” Sam said.
“Fuck!” Dean growled when his thrusts became harder and faster. They were both panting very hard now.
The tears came back although Dean was laughing now.
"Would you please take this to Sam?" he asked the Omega.
„You know you are not so hard on the eyes yourself,“ Dean mumbled happily.
"Dean, please. I can't tell you..."
"Cas, it's time for you to let go. Today could have gone worse." Meg said in a soft voice. Of course, he knew she was right. He was lucky he wasn't badly injured.
Dean looked at him in disbelief. When he recovered from his shock, he smashed their lips together. There was no tenderness in the kiss, it was pure lust.
Oh! Now Cas was able to understand. Of course, Dean didn’t want him, but he definitely wanted to know how the freaky male omega acted. He was studying him. Like he was a laboratory rat.
“Oh God, Mr Novak. Didn’t you imagine how hurt your soulmate would be thinking you didn’t want him?”
"That's why we can't start before noon and why everything has to be done before the rain starts."
"Gone? Where are you going?" Ellen asked with a big frown on her forehead.
I try to update at least once a week.
"What do you mean, you felt it?" Cas wanted to know.
John smiled and reached out to shake hands.
”Don’t stop, Dean I beg you… don’t… I…“ Cas cried shamelessly, shaking apart beneath Dean. After another moment he came all over their joined hands in thick ropes. Dean’s breath hitched. ”Fuuck!“ he cried.
Castiel sat down and rested his head on his hands.
“Besides you, none. Why are you asking? Male omegas are really rare and….oh. I see.”
“You went into heat.”
"Yes, we’ve been smoking and hiding behind the small building. Alist..., one of my friends, threw away the match and the dry grass caught fire. The others ran straight to the car and drove away. I tried to put out the fire, but it had already started to grow too uncontrollable. . ."
Lisa's announcement that Dean would be looking for an apartment with her this summer, had more than just shocked Cas. He and Dean had been living in the small apartment for three years and of course Cas should have known that Dean wouldn't stay in the tiny apartment with him forever after he finished college. But somehow Cas had always thought that they would look for something bigger together.
Dean couldn’t stifle a sob.
Dean and Cas exchanged terrified looks, but then both had to laugh. The situation was so weird.
"Please wait, Mr Novak. Don’t you want to give Dean his present yourself? " She asked.
"I know, and we're all really sorry. Really! Ruby went completely nuts and we just didn't think. What happened when they caught you?"
With a sigh, Cas started the engine and drove to the Winchesters house. Mr Winchester welcomed him at the entrance.
“I never forgot my pills. Please, Sam, stop it. It hurts to even think about it. Please call the Alpha Service Dr Crowley.”
However, the nurse didn't want to let him go just like that. She insisted that someone had to pick him up. So he had no choice but to call Meg. He had asked her not to tell the others what had happened, but obviously, she told Dean not only about the accident but also about Castiel's feelings for him.
The Omega stood in front of the Frathouse with the alpha girl and they were kissing. No! This was his Omega!
Jesus Christ! This would be over very soon if Cas went on like this.
"Hey... Dean. Please look at me," Cas said and took Dean's face in both hands. Tenderly he stroked Dean's cheeks with his thumbs.
“Charlie, you can’t…”
In a far back corner of his brain, there was a little voice reminding him that Jo was in the house, that she was probably wondering where he was, that she might hear them. But all these thoughts vanished into thin air as Castiel's hands slipped under his T-shirt caressing his stomach.
Gabriel looked around and only now seemed to realize that Cas had packed all his belongings.
"Of course I did. The walls are thin as paper", Dean replied, focusing on his pancake so he didn't have to look at Cas.
Here we go. Thank you so much @thatwasamazing for beta reading again ❤💗
Very soon the kiss grew heated again and they were rubbing their hard cocks together until Dean couldn’t take it any more.
“Cas, Dean is gone forever.”
Angry she turned around and went back into the house. Dean sighed deeply. He knew she was mad at him now. Damn it!  He felt like the biggest and ungrateful asshole when he went back into the house, grabbed his jacket and left the party.
Cas hung back in the shadows where the man couldn’t see him and watched the scene unfold.
Cas’ grip tightened around Dean.  “Where were you?  Where were you?”  His voice grew distorted as he repeated the question over and over and his suffocating grip crushed Dean in his arms.
Cas smiled sadly.  “I know.”
“Did you ever find the people who did it?”
Angie took the card and nodded.
Dean looked at Cas with concern.  He opened and closed his mouth several times before just sighing.
Dean kept the knife pressed against his spine as they walked out the back door.  As soon as the door closed behind them, Dean shoved the man forward and drew his gun.
“So I have to join you. What a shame!” Cas stated with a grin on his lips while he wiped away the tears with his fingers.
"Thank you! It makes it easier for me to understand Dean. "
Dean shouldn’t feel bad because of the Omegas relieved smile. No, he definitely shouldn’t!
Cas wondered if Dean had saved him. The boy smelled slightly of smoke. But before he could think about it any further, the door opened and a nurse came in.
Cas could only laugh dryly.
Cas whole body tensed.
Oh God! Dean shuddered.
He knew he would have to let go of Cas hand eventually to hold the fork but he made sure their thighs were bumping together.  It seemed nearly impossible not to touch Cas. But it was okay, he knew Cas wouldn’t care.
Rowena looked at him in surprise. "Yeah, sure. Why not. "
"What? Do you mean Cassy? My cousin is your new roommate? "
“Fuck Dean!” the Omega cried and Dean added another finger.
“But…” Mary was confused.
Dean wanted Cas to fuck him! Holy Christ!
„Okay, Doc! So it is the Alpha Service then. But I won’t use the Service Omega for anything else than smelling his scent.”
„I think…“ The Alpha said. „I think sex with this bond will get very interesting.“
Neither of them was in the mood for teasing. Short and precise, Balthazar prepared him before he pushed inside. From the very beginning, he picked up a fast and urgent pace. The biggest shock for Cas, however, came with his orgasm, which literally overpowered him as his thoughts suddenly allowed themselves the prank to imagine Dean.
"Shit, man, I'm really sorry. You have an advantage, though. " Crowley said
“What would you prefer?”
Helplessly, Dean shuddered beneath him.
So he just leaned against the wall, drank one beer after another and watched the crowd. It was just before midnight and so far he had managed to stay in the background surprisingly well. Especially considering it was his birthday party.
He reluctantly broke away from Dean and went to open the door.
“Do you have any plans?” She wanted to know.
He had no idea how he was supposed to get through this breakfast.
"Yes, about a week ago. "
Without realizing it, Dean started to stroke Cas back. Somehow Cas fit perfectly into his arms. Almost like he was made especially for it. With every breath of Cas amazing scent, Dean was forgetting everything around him more and more. All that mattered was the Omega in his arms. With one hand he tried to draw Cas closer to him, while the other hand was now buried deep in the Omega’s hair. Perhaps he would have had the situation under control if his former roommate had behaved passively if he had not reacted to Dean's touches. But when he heard Cas moan quietly and the Omega started to suck at Dean's Scent glands, Deans self-control melted like snow in the sun.
„Hey, little cousin. You all right?“
Cas: “Hey Meg.”
He cleared his throat and sat down.
"Two male Omegas under my roof. It's an honour, Castiel. "
He'd turn eighteen in one week. Then he would be old enough to get a tattoo and remove the Soulmate tattoo without the permission of his parents. Somehow this thought made him confident. He would be able to live a  life without his soulmate. It wouldn’t be easy but it would be possible.
But at least Cas now knew that he didn't have to get his hopes up. Dean was straight and the mere thought that Cas had slept with a man seemed to repulse him.
Without warning, Dean ripped open Cas’ shirt with his hands. The buttons flung through the air but the Omega couldn't care less. Impatiently he fumbled with his fly. When he finally managed to push his pants and boxer briefs down, Dean also managed to take off his T-shirt and the pyjama pants.
Then Cas got dressed. However, his shirt was completely unusable without the buttons. Dean didn't remember being the reason they were torn off.
"Did you get your mark today, Dean?" Sam suddenly asked with his mouth full.
“Tell me if I am hurting you,” Dean demanded.
Cas felt incredibly guilty. Although he had no feelings for the Alpha right now, he knew that this misery wasn't Dean's fault alone. On the contrary. Damn it! He really hadn't considered for a moment that Dean might not have rejected him. He had really believed his true mate would just leave him even though he knew what would happen to the Omega afterwards.  In retrospect, that was just wrong. He should have known Dean would never do that. Just the way Dean cared about his family and with all the things Sam had told him, he should have realized Dean wasn't a bad person. How else could he have been his true mate?
“Wow! I am really honoured. And I promise I will guide you…”
Dean tried and of course, he was aware that he was the cause of all the complications. But it was so fucking hard.
It took some time until the beta came back.
"Wow, that's very generous of your brothers Cas," Jody said.
“I would very much prefer to ignore him, but I think that would be very impolite.” He whined.
And this was it.. this was all it took for Dean to fall over the edge.
Dean tried to go slow first, but Cas wanted him to go faster and harder and Dean was so on board with that. Even if he knew he wouldn’t last.
“You are so fucking handsome, Dean,” Cas whispered in awe, his eyes roaming over his body.
Wow! Dean’s intonation made it very clear how absurd the idea was to him.
Castiel let out his breath in relieve. He didn’t know why it was important for him that Deans father liked him, but it was.
“Yes, I did. I don’t believe this whole true mate thing. You and Gabe tried everything to find them but you didn’t. And only for the record, even if Balthazar would have been my true mate it wouldn’t matter because Dean is the one and only to me and I will get him back, by all means.”
Dean heard the annoyance in Cas’ voice. Ha! So the Beta was affected, at least a little bit. Dean didn’t leave him as cold as he always let him think. For the last few weeks, the Alpha had been unsuccessfully trying to seduce Cas. Dean didn’t think he was irresistible, but he had to admit that it had never happened to him before, that someone didn’t even react. It annoyed him not just because of the bet.
