By the seventh time, he wonders if this may not be so applicable to Sherlock. Maybe Sherlock, unlike John, may
John feels like a schoolboy, sullen with longing; nose pressed up against the shop display, breathing mist onto the glass.

recognising it.
Sherlock is without the right words, he told them to hang and now they’re rightfully deserting him, spilling out of his grasp as inarticulate particulates. So he gives up and kisses John on the forehead forcefully, once, then twice.
He hears a distant, foreign voice say, “Don’t.
Moriarty grins, lips stretching thinly over his teeth, glistening with saliva. He shrugs off the heavy robes, revealing a sleek, grey suit beneath. Reptilian-like, his tongue darts out to lick his lips.

“I don’t know, Sherlock-”
John face goes funny at that. He closes the door, and then leans against it, drawing Sherlock to him. “Are you sure you want to?” he asks quietly, the utter moron. Sherlock holds John’s hip, and carefully grinds his erection against John’s in answer. John’s eyes slit shut, as if in pain. When he opens them again, they’re the most desperate blue Sherlock has ever seen. “I don’t mean just this.”
, not when they could pretend to resolve their issues and suppress the morning’s events in typical, painless fashion [relatively speaking. Sherlock is restless with the knowledge of being in love, complete with an aching, phantom feeling nestling in some aorta or another]. Not when the arch of John’s foot is perfect against his pyjamas, its presence a hot water bottle of the best kind. But John only lowers himself to the ground, twisting himself into a cross-legged position, and shifting until he is very, very close to Sherlock.

“Rebecca?”
I hate this hiatus so much.
John sucks down on his nipple, then another, and Sherlock’s hands grasp at the sheets. He’s loud, and trembling. John’s breath, damp on his chest, John’s belly expanding with every inhale against Sherlock’s, his hand now only jerking Sherlock off, moving faster and faster, pulling rougher and rougher. John’s penis slaps against Sherlock’s pelvis, and Sherlock hisses when John’s thumb swipes across his glans, circling it. Everything is heat and delirium, like a fever breaking, and a feeling in his abdomen tightens and builds in crescendo, a many-stringed, high-strung symphony, and Sherlock hurtles through his orgasm with curious awareness, John’s name stuck in his throat.
After Angelo has gone it takes a few, desperate seconds to remember where they had left off.
John leans forward on the counter top, and smiles. A dark blush spreads across Sherlock’s cheekbones-
, “-messy. And yet.”
“Forgive me,” Sherlock whispers, pressing his clammy forehead to John’s, trapping sweaty curls. “I didn’t want to do it- not like
Sherlock stands up, and walks towards John, retying his scarf, head downturned— John reaches up to cup his face, catching him unaware. Sherlock flinches, then relaxes, eyes unblinking, breathing shallow. His hands hang limp by the side. This close to the light, nothing can be hidden.
In John’s book, experiencing nightmares is one problem wherein the first step to a solution is, quite firmly,
And what would Sherlock think? Would he act hurt, secretly delighted that he’s not the only one who’s been
John briskly walks into the poorly-lit, empty reception area, and pauses, wondering how to proceed. There are narrow, dingy stairs, leading down to the parking levels and other, suspect things— and up, to the residential floors. Ah, here: John hurries into the open elevator, knowing instinctively where Sherlock must be, blindly swinging one leg inside—
“I was the model patient. Core temperature and body functioning as per the normal, recovery trajectory.”

The pale of Sherlock’s back is criss-crossed with angry, red ridges— mottled, with the yellow, blue and purple of bruises all ageing differently, colours fighting for territory on this expanse of broken skin.
“Yes, I can tell.”
Sherlock Holmes does not remember how he got here.
. It’s— it’s started to fall out,” Sherlock confesses, the gravest he has been throughout the entire conversation.

John blinks his eyes open, realising they had been closed. The Woman: naked and knowing, now wrapped in a dark coat, lips painted in a red sneer, growing smaller and insignificant— Sherlock: fragile, determined. Sherlock, toppled by the wind, plummeting— no,
The sound must do something to John, because he abruptly gets on his knees and adjusts himself, straddling Sherlock’s thighs, and begins to mouth gently at Sherlock’s throat. “Oh,” Sherlock says, full of surprise and realisation, like a deduction falling in place. “
, none of this makes up for the fact you could’ve
“I kissed you,” John then says, which is confusing, seeing as John quite patently
“I said,” Sherlock starts, and then blinks, because the sudden tenderness on John’s face is on the blinding side of bright. “I said.” He clears his throat, and drops his voice to a whisper, for there is no other way. “I’m glad I wasn’t unconscious for that.”

“They didn’t have a vacancy when I first called, which is funny-”
“John-” he says, with a bowed head (

Sherlock whips around, scarf untied, and leans into the light. A frown crosses his face, and then clears. “Mycroft,” he utters, sounding tired.
“No?” And all of a sudden, the conversation feels very old.
“Won’t she— oh.” John watches as Sherlock’s quizzical expression rearranges, now blank. “She already knows, doesn’t she? How long? No, don’t answer that, I don’t want to-” He strokes the webbing between his thumb and index finger. “’Course she knew before me,” he says quietly, almost talking to himself.
John likes a good laugh, same as any bloke— within reason. He does not enjoy cruel jokes— the sick, twisted ones. It stands to reason that he is not very fond of his epiphanies.
Sometime, around noticing a stoic marvel standing behind the fluttering yellow crime-scene tape, apart from the flashing lights and police. Upright chin, hands clasped behind the back. Traces of a steady aim, complex morality, and astounding loyalty, all beneath plain, squared fingernails. As unmissable as the gunpowder would have been.

“’Something sad’?” Sherlock gives a small smile, amused.
Sherlock stops John from saying more, and they stay like that, lips moulded together, until John exhales shakily into Sherlock’s mouth.
[John would discover the stash, if Sherlock let him. John would yell at him, getting right in his face, if Sherlock let him. Close enough to smell the clean detergent and musk that is wholly his.

“Well, today’s case, you know,” John starts—
- rage at piss splatter from a steady stream of urine into the fireplace beneath, say, when I felt like giving an irreverent scoundrel the socking he was never bestowed at birth. I feel stirrings of the old Wilhelm at such moments. The recollection is not unpleasant. Indeed, it is faintly nostalgic.
He tastes like a saviour, of stale sourness and rain.
what happens next- and prepares himself for it-
But the equilibrium had shifted, and when John moved back in, he made Sherlock suffer more and more of the smaller indignities. The ones that bubbled, remaining unsettled, panging sharp. Stalking off for a ‘walk’ and ‘fresh air’, clicking the laptop shut and stomping up to his room, staying the night at Stamford’s [Stamford!] whenever arguments came circling, closer and closer, around that gaping drain of two static years that Sherlock, no matter how hard he tried, could not fill with enough justification or appropriate groveling. As if

"And what good will that do?" Sherlock snaps, his jaw working viciously with unsaid acid, acid he longs to throw at Mycroft, who's just standing there, so unperturbed, so uncaring. Unwrapping an éclair with long fingers, neat as can be, as if he has all the time in the world.
Sherlock’s eyes snap upwards to his, impossibly fast, shocked-
“I’m forbidding you to leave.”

As ever, John’s left fist betrays him, the muscles on his hands working furiously. It takes him two tries to get the words out. “You are not
: I wrote this fic in 2015. In November 2017, Louis CK was accused of sexual misconduct by 5 women following a New York Times investigation, and confessed to the same. He returned to the stand-up circuit after a short hiatus, and is yet to demonstrate any credible ownership of his wrongdoings in his material or statements since. I will leave the YouTube link up, because I think it's important to acknowledge where I drew my inspiration from, and I think Parker Posey gave an incredible performance. However, I would personally encourage folks considering watching Louis' material/fans still loyal to him to abstain, and instead try out the sheer wealth of crazy good material by female comics out there (Emily Blotnick, Aparna Nancherla, Tig Notaro, Fern Brady, Hannah Gadsby, etc.)
John pushes past Sherlock, who is unmoving, and walks up the stairs in a daze, heart hammering against his throat.

, she was right, but she was also wrong— because some times are
John frowns, and then his lips purse the way they do when he doesn’t want to grin. He pivots with his one hand on the armrest, dropping heavily onto the seat. His feet graze the carpet, bracketed by Sherlock’s legs. He shifts one of them, and Sherlock watches, as if detached from his body, the foot fitting snugly under his calf.
“-oh, don’t you?” John’s voice is hoarse. “That’s funny, ‘cause it’s starting to feel like exactly that.” His breathing is heavy. “Sod this.” He yanks his [maroon] cardigan off the collapsible chair at the bedside, grabbing the rolled-up copy of the morning’s Guardian, clearly about to leave.

John switches off the light and walks out, feeling distinctly conflicted.
“We can’t continue this. Circumstances have- arisen, and I- it’s not

Sherlock right down to the bone and settle in his marrow, like a malignancy, so that he understands the enormity of what he did to John Watson— “Wouldn’t want to reach conclusions

,” John hands it to him, “but plain honey, sure, why not-”
He looks up again, and feels a sudden, sharp wall of pain as Molly slaps him.
“This?” Sherlock is sitting weirdly- on his haunches, and upon his armchair- fingers steepled, and staring into the kitchen. He looks down, appearing to have realised that over the (ridiculously designer) black shirt he’s wearing (and fetchingly stretching) is John’s (beige, humbly knit, peasant) cardigan. “Oh. Yes.”
“Did he ever came back for another summer?”
Sherlock remembers to breathe.
Taking the punch as quietly as possible, John gets out a weak, “No, why?”
10:23
“I know,” Sherlock replies, keeping to himself how he had searched for the best agency to sell the book to at the time. They stare at each other for another long moment, only being reminded that they can’t stand in the middle of the street much longer when Toby barks, waiting by the front door. Sherlock takes advantage of the few minutes left before he has to let go of John’s hand to catalogue its warmth, and he’s almost prepared when they break apart.
What is the most
"That he did," Lestrade agrees. "Once he and Sherlock  were officially together, we focused all of our efforts to plan tonight. Sherlock made sure that Horsen would chose this club in particular, and even guessed the movie he had in mind."
“Sherlock?” John’s concerned voice asks, and Sherlock realises they’ve stopped in the middle of the kitchen.
I want us to get there, together, at our own pace.
Sherlock,
“No, no, no!”
A whole lot of emotions crashes over him, making it just a bit harder to breathe properly or look at the bouquet without smiling like - surely - an idiot. He puts Rosie down without taking his eyes off the flowers.
“Did I smell toast in the kitchen?” John asks, anything but staring a second more at this thing.
“All the researched I’ve conduct said that most good dates end with a kiss,” Sherlock says, not exactly certain where this new courage came from. “And you said it yourself, you had a very good time.”
"I don't know," John teases, moving to kiss his nipples now. "I quite like this." Sherlock makes a frustrated noise, tugging harder and John finally rolls back on top of him. He kisses Sherlock tenderly, not moving yet. "Tell me, alright?"
Sherlock let his head rest on the door again, breathing out slowly to regain some control. “Yes,” he replied before moaning when John bit down at the sensitive skin where his jaw met his neck. “Now.”
"I thought I'll drop by, yeah," she replies, hugging him back. "It's not as if I've been waiting for you to move here for years after all."
"Are you still afraid now?" John asks, understanding exactly how Sherlock must feel.
Anna at the reception is surprised to see him, especially so that a doctor didn’t showed up. John assures her he can take care of his patients, glad to know he won’t have time to think too much all day. He spends the next seven hours keeping busy, not taking a moment to himself and skipping lunch to make sure Tom won’t know he’s there. He’s far from being in the mood for a chat or pep talk right now.
“One of my colleague.”
“I…” John begins, having settled deep inside him now. “God, Sherlock, I-”
The waitress came back with their drinks and John sipped in silence. Sherlock never touched his. It was only twenty minutes later that the solution to their case presented itself.
Sherlock finally looks at him, almost daringly, “I remember him too, John.”
“I know for a fact that the bed is large enough for two.” Sherlock finally replied and John’s smile could have lit up the entire airport.
"Stop," John interrupts him. "Of course you know, you always know everything, don't you?"
"She only congratulated me four times, which is remarkable," Sherlock says, an amused smile on his lips. "She also said she always knew the two of us were made for each other," he adds with another roll of his eyes.
“I’m coming,” John whispers, silence the only answer to his promise.
John's hand is reaching out of his of pocket and gripping Sherlock's coat before he can stop himself, breathing heavily, "See," he whispers. "There is so much we need to say to the other, so much to explain." Sherlock closes his eyes, his shoulders dropping. "But not here."
“I think you’re taking the whole seducing me part very seriously,” Sherlock whispers. “A success in every aspect so far.”
It doesn’t matter.
Sherlock wonders if someday, ten, twenty, thirty years from now, he’ll be able to make him understand just how far from ordinary he is. John’s hand closes around his wrist, a gentle stroke of his thumb making Sherlock shiver. He smiles.
Victor glances at the door and back to him, “Are you and Sherlock together?”
John takes the punch without a word, looking down at his feet and sighing.
"Oh," Sherlock says suddenly, pulling away and staring at him with wide eyes. "I didn't tell you."
the regular you and it’ll
John smiles, "Is it alright to ask it?"
John laughs, the sound filling the air, and it only takes a second before Sherlock leans in to catch it between his lips. “I’d love to come up,” he says, keeping Sherlock close. “You haven’t told me about any of the cases you solved after all.”
Sherlock wakes up with the ghost of John’s compact body around him. He doesn’t let go of the dream yet, wondering how exactly he could go back and fix it.
“John, better realise now that it will always be alright,” Sherlock replies, grinning.
Sherlock nodded, shaking the hand John was offering, “Thank you for your help with this case.”
“I’d like to collect data,” Sherlock replies, sounding just hesitant enough for John to fall a little more in love. “About you.”
“Yes, alright, about us.”
I have to say, Sherlock.
my time, writing this list
John finds that he had been waiting a lifetime for this.
“Was Victor in real troubles?”
"John," Lestrade calls, followed by two officers. "We'll take it from here. Sherlock is waiting for you in the car."
Quentin is off and running toward a tall, blond man in less than a second, all but knocking the man - Timothy, to the floor. John and Sherlock follow quickly, Quentin’s scream earning them glares and sighs.
Since Sherlock and John are now talking, I'm gonna use this format a bit more,  I hope it won't be too confusing.
"Pa'?" Comes Rosie's voice again. "Are you there?"
"Why didn't you?" Sherlock murmurs.
Thank you all for still following this story,
“Do you want to do something about it, together?”
Some days, some nights too, they make love as if it was their first time doing so all over again.
John.
come back.
“You'll have all the information you need in there,” Sherlock declared handing him Marks’ documents.”I’m sure you can manage on your own.” Sherlock added before giving him his best smile, John letting out a muffled giggle next to him.
“We did, yes.”
“And you’re the one you chose to tell me about this whole charade at the last minutes,” John replies, knowing it would get a Sherlock’s full attention.
XX32:
I’ve missed it too.
Only the bedlight is on when he gets in, Sherlock looking down at his phone on the left side of the bed. He doesn’t look up and John thanks him silently, getting rid of his robe and pushing the cover away on his side. He sits down first, his back to Sherlock, and places his watch and phone on the bedside table. He allows himself a moment more before lying down, stiff as a stick on the mattress.
. It’s his hair on the pillow, his hands on your hip, his breath against your skin. It’s knowing he’s right here, where you can reach for him, where you can feel him,
for his own enjoyment. Strange, how being in the middle of the crowd can make you feel surrounded and yet alone at the same time. Music had always been the one option he could always rely on when needing to shut the world out, and it is exactly what he’s desperate for now. He pays the driver quickly when they arrive and he doesn’t allow himself to linger outside, knowing all too well how fast he could change his mind. The music is loud, almost louder than he had expected, when he goes inside. He leaves his coat in the club locker, looking down at himself and realising he’s probably not dressed for the occasion, but not caring at all. He’s not here to fit in or even mingle with others. A perfectly tailored suit will be just fine.
Sherlock feels himself blush, and he’s glad his face is currently nuzzled to John’s neck. Of course it’s going to happen, he knows it’s going to happen, had been thinking about this
Rosie seemed fine. She laughed, a lot, and most of the time when John is the one making her laugh. She loves him, that much is obvious. He loves her too, of course. What wouldn’t he? She’s a beautiful baby, even I cannot deny it.
: 04:56 PM
“Maybe we don’t need to be so stressed tonight,” John says, soft and gentle.
"Did you have your gun with you?" John shakes his head. "Did you hit Horsen?" Another shake. "Are you certain?"
Sherlock waits patiently. No matter what John might think or what they already discussed, he knows his mother and father are going to fuss over them both without thinking twice about what all that happened.
in it.
Buttoning his Belstaff again, Sherlock considered calling Mycroft to see if he could find him a plane for tonight. Looking for an hotels near the airport would be hell, and by now most of the room must have been booked. The mere thought of going through all the hotels around here was making Sherlock want to pick up his phone.
“Not really,” Greg says, walking to the kitchen and rubbing Rosie’s hair slowly, “But I had a day off and I thought I’d come see you. It’s been a while.”
“You think they should have try,” Sherlock says, finding his eyes again. “Risk their friendship?”
“Yes,” John replies honestly. “I’m scared I’ll be the one that ruins it all, the one that will not be able to make you experience pleasure and passion and all that you deserve.”
John doesn’t reply, doesn’t even turn to look at him. Sherlock curses at himself. He won’t get any closer to kissing the man if he talks to him this way.
“We’re coming in,” Sherlock replies, not looking away from John’s eyes.
“Whatever you want us to be.”
“Thank you, John,” Victor says, having not lost his own - damn, smile.
Being myself, didn’t work
"Easy for you to say," John exhales loudly.
“John,” Sherlock cuts him off. “You woke me up in a middle of an erotic dream in which we were, much like now, about to make love. I think it says enough.”
“Good.”
He lets them resonate in the air for a moment, filling the silence without making it easier to wrap his head around the veracity they hold. Sherlock isn't sure how many times he hoped for this simple and yet breathtaking fact to be true. Ever since you met him, a voice supplies for him, but he ignores it. It doesn't matter, in the end. The truth is he's been in love with John Watson for too long to put a date on it, and now that it was all within his reach, Sherlock finds himself being too scared to even move from this bench.
“Look what I’ve found.”
Sherlock studies him for a long moment, eyes roaming all over his face, "I love you."
“Thank you,” Sherlock replies, and John wishes he would just look at him.
“I’ll just use your full name for the account,” Lestrade says absently, more to himself than to him but Sherlock can’t help but start worrying anyway. “Christ, don’t look at me like that. I can stop, you know.”
Sherlock thinks.
Sherlock blushes so quickly that John can’t help but laugh.
Sherlock sighs, pulling their join hands up and between their chest, resting over John’s heart. He needs to feel it, to make sure John is just as shook, just as much affected by what just happened, what is still happening.
“Was that a question?”
They stare at each other, not saying a word, and for a moment John wonders if Sherlock has stopped breathing entirely. He flexes his hand into a fist, waiting and refusing to look away. Sherlock’s eyes are roaming all over his face now, and once more, John feels the same thrill at being under his focused stare. He could remain there for hours, letting Sherlock read on his face all the things he cannot speak out yet.
I haven’t been able to stop staring at it for the past few hours? Minutes? I’m not even sure anymore. Has reality always been this flexible? I stare at this picture and I can’t help but deduce all there is to see.
Are we- I mean, is it okay?
“I…” Sherlock begins before clearing his throat. “Even if I care,” he starts again, looking anywhere but into the DI’s eyes, “there’s not much I can do.”
Am not.
“Come in,” John says, moving to the side, and Sherlock only has the time to notice his cripsed hand on the door handle before getting inside. He stops in the living room, eyes roaming all over the room, taking in everything that has changed since he last visit, proves that John’s life went on, here. “Are you alright?”
“Want one?” John asked, pointing at his drink.
"John," Sherlock breathes softly.
"Doesn't look like he ever will," Mycroft replies, and the words wash over Sherlock like a sudden rush of bright happiness.
Thank you again for all the kudos and comments!!
Pauline.
“Of course”, John hummed, “You can have the bath first. I’ll try to make the bed habitable in the meantime.” He tried to hide how reluctantly he let go of Sherlock. Really, he would rather have kept his arms slung around the other’s body but there was probably no point in trying. It was a one night stand after all and Sherlock had just subtly reminded him of that.
"I can remember the day I took it perfectly," Sherlock breathes, wishing nothing more but to erase the sad lines all over John's face. "You insisted we celebrate her birthday even if we were in the middle of a dangerous case. Just the three of us."
They kiss lazily for a long moment, Sherlock seeking his lips as soon as each kiss ends, and John obliges him happily. He can feel his body starting to react from the closeness of Sherlock's in the most delicious way, each touch electrifying. It isn't hard to guess what the shivers running through Sherlock mean, and John finds that he rather likes being the cause of each and every one of them. Threading his fingers through Sherlock's curls, he breathes, "There's still so much I want to tell you, to ask you," he smiles, kissing Sherlock's temple, "but it can wait for tomorrow, you must be exhausted."
“This,” Sherlock murmurs, “but with me on my back and you inside me.”
he disarmed me,
But, as usual, John had smiled and laughed and looked at him with something bright in his eyes, and Sherlock had lost control all over again. How could he think of trying if it meant losing
"No," John says, clearing his throat. "When?"
“Maybe eating would have been a good idea,” he says, smiling inside his own glass.
"You mean more jealous," John replies, smiling as he uses one hand to force Sherlock to look back at him. "It worked."
at this point I don’t care
Sherlock is holding a small tube in one hand, the other clenched around the door handle, "I didn't have any condoms but I thought that we didn't need any since I've never done anything, and considering you are a doctor, it seems logical that you get tested regularly. Besides, I don't ever plan on doing this with anyone else, so condoms aren't that necessary when you think abou-"
Not just one kiss, even if the first one was beyond anything I ever dared to imagine. No, he kissed me four times. Four. Each kiss different from the previous one, every one of them absolutely perfect. I couldn’t care less about experiences or previous data, if I get to kiss John - and only him - from now on, then I won’t ever complain again. Just kiss him. If he lets me.
Sherlock puts the phone down slowly, inhaling deeply, “Nevermind who this is about. I don’t care.”
“That was supposed to sound, I don’t know, cute,” Lestrade sighs. “You tell me, then, what should I write?”
“Tonight. I told him to spend the day at work today,” Sherlock says, leaning down to pick up the mattress. “Can you help me get this downstairs?”
“No. I was thinking later tonight.”
“Clearly it’s not working,” Sherlock points out, another long shiver running through John despite the duvet.
It’s him.
“Good,” John says, nodding sharply. “Take your covers. I’ll wait for you upstairs.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I recall talking about goodnight kisses,” John breathes out, watching as Sherlock’s entire body seem to shudder at the words. “What do you think?”
John's eyes find Sherlock again immediately, "What?"
Sherlock’s smile is bright in the dimmed room, “Glad we agree.”
Sherlock perfectly remembered the solid muscle of John’s stomach and the way his shoulder blades had rolled when he had put on another shirt. Sherlock could have laughed at the not so subtle teasing if he hadn’t been too busy hiding his burning face. John was handsome and denying it wasn’t going to help him right now. Of course Sherlock wasn’t oblivious to sexual attraction, or even to sex in general. He had experienced it, three times, before realising that two minutes of pure bliss wasn’t worth all the troubles. Flirting, kissing, small talk. All of it dull and quite tendious. But then, Sherlock hadn’t feel this pure want, this need to touch and caress and taste with his previous sexual partner. It had been efficient, both parties only interested in a one night stand and it had fit Sherlock’s plan nicely.

"Sorry if I caused any trouble tonight," John apologizes, putting his coat back on.
Sherlock. A lot more. And
"We've talked about this before," Sherlock almost cuts him, and his intense stare forces John to look back at him. "We did, John, many times and I thought we agreed to move past it all."
Not him. Me. SH
Sherlock is rolling his eyes again when John kisses him, pulling away when he feels Rosie's hand pulling his hair, "Daddy!"
John knows he’s surely dying for a smoke. He had been trying to stop for month, and even if it was still a success, John knows how hard it was on him.
“Mummy took us there for Mycroft’s birthday once,” Sherlock says. “I spent most of the time sulking since it was making miss a very important step of an experiment, but it didn’t stopped me from enjoying the meal quite a lot.”
“We could dig up some unsolved cases,” Sherlock offers.
Sherlock shuts his eyes tight, the words he wished to speak so many times on the tip of his tongue and the same fear he’s experienced all these years spreading throughout his entire body. Is this why John had come then? To be friends again? To continue just like they had done all this time?
I'm back!!
Sherlock doesn’t ever want this to end.
Sherlock searches for something to say, something that will make John understand if he could do anything to prevent the both of them ever leaving this bed, he wouldn’t hesitate for a second. But there are John’s lips pressed against his own, and the fear of never having enough time to catalogue each and every point of contact slowly fading away. John is kissing him, and Sherlock kisses back with the certainty that he’ll be doing so again in a few seconds.
Sherlock’s lips are parted, shock and guilt and something unidentifiable, splayed messily across his face—
-“ Sherlock’s voice is thickening- John is numb- “-do you understand? You were dying, and
The t-shirt slips off with a soft sound, tousling Sherlock’s hair.
“How…”
.” His hands clutch at the carpet uselessly, and then, by degrees, he brings them to John’s hips. He tugs at John’s shirt sides, pulling him so that they’re flush against each other, John’s chest on Sherlock’s, rising and falling with short, shallow breaths. John’s teeth, now nicking at his pulse point, tongue laving it over— their erections brush against each other and it’s almost too much to
Sherlock clears his throat.
He hears the medic say John cannot accompany Sherlock on the ambulance.
A primal instinct pricks at him, and Sherlock grips the edge of the wood, ready to
A man, with golden hair and sharp, handsome features. Shadows conceals one half of his face— John has the niggling feeling there is something warped beneath, something skirting hideousness— but when he turns his face to the dimming light, there is only smooth skin.
John startles. “Wha- no, never. I had the time, after my discharge, but you have to climb up all the way, and my

I know these things, but I am often removed from them. I access them with an indifference I cannot help. I view them from the other side. The memories are filmed over with dust and distance. It is only a matter of time before they are assigned to the metaphorical rubble heap.
"It's alright, but you really need to focus. Now, John's vitals-" Molly gestures to a monitor which wasn't there a second ago, that has a wide, transparent screen. Rivulets of blood drip down from the inside, colouring the surface a horrible, vivid red, over and over. Attached to John's left wrist is an IV drip, which is pulsating a thunderous black; tiny flashes of electricity continuously spark against the plastic covering.
“And yet. Possessing, as I do, a vast intellect, it is not inaccurate to assume that a corresponding subconscious must be cluttered, and complex, in the same proportion. I examined my subconscious- and it is mad, John- stark, raving

“But I’m not holding you.” James replies. “
That night, John rubs the glass of his watch-face clean (the metal is getting noticeably scuffed, ought to buy a new one), and dabs himself with a tiny amount of cologne. He inspects himself in the mirror, and grins. It has become an accepted annoyance of John’s life- like the third button on the TV remote that never works, or the rattling doorknob to the loo that cannot be tightened: flat-sharing with Sherlock Holmes is not conducive to healthy, long-term relationships.
“Do you know you do that out loud?”
The single word pounds into his head with every heartbeat, in a harrowing refrain.
to resent you- and try being difficult- to see if I’m able, or just too…dependent.”
But there is only silence from Mycroft. The man has straightened himself, and is looking very carefully at him.
“Mycroft,” he says steadily, “if you’re going to help me-
A harsh yell comes, and Sherlock hisses. The adrenalin surges once more, and they are up and running, off like lightning, knocking a trash can in their haste, leaping over locked gates.
“Tosspot,” he remarks matter-of-factly, gingerly spreading the ointment. “You utter tosspot.”
Sherlock lets out a hitching breath under the scrutiny.
-” he begins to exclaim, sounding thoroughly exasperated, and John brings their heads together, pressing a quick kiss to Sherlock’s lips. He splutters, and blinks several times. John grins, and kisses him again, slower this time. Both their lips are chapped, cold and dry, and somehow, this doesn’t matter in the
“Would you like to kiss it?”
And thank you very much for reading.
“I’m not asking you to know, I’m asking you to consider, unless you don’t know whether to consider, which is a unique kind of indecisiveness-”
Alright.
A few hours later, the elder brother-- Mycroft-- attempted to pry me out of Sherlock’s hands. A dramatic tussle. Flattering at first, but I know better now. Chess pieces-- a toothbrush-- an errant word-- all could serve as a fitting proxy for reasons to battle between those two.
The third time he is woken like this, John does a breathing exercise- inhales, exhales, slowly closes his eyes- until he is calm enough to drift back to sleep.
They just sit together, reading or writing or being, as the light wanes, ever so slowly.
They’re hunched in the cellar of Angelo’s, and the support beam overhead casts a thin, fuzzy strip of shadow over Sherlock’s broad, pale forehead— like a crown of thorns—

Methodically, Sherlock works backwards:
John enters the living room and hangs up his coat, left fist clenching and unclenching. Sherlock is back on his armchair, lounging (an art form, with

John draws his head back, bewildered, glancing at the screen— oh,
A beat of silence. Then, wordlessly, Sherlock resumes typing, and John wanders into the kitchen to put the kettle on, feeling silly and triumphant.

“No,” Sherlock says thickly.

“Administer it to him. Give him an overdose, and then give yourself one as well. I-” Mycroft’s voice falters. “It will save the two of you a lot of pain. Contrary to what you may choose to believe-” Mycroft inhales, chin pushed up, steeling himself, “-I do not wish to see you in that kind of agony. Ever, if I can help it.”
“You sure?” He yells over his shoulder, turning back for an instant, but James is nowhere to be seen.
“John,” Sherlock says sharply, “Your dinner is-”
Sherlock turns to the window.

John shifts his weight to the other foot, unsure of where the conversation is leading to.

. After the universe has balled up and rolled out and righted itself, and the infinite contained within has once more reached stasis.
John laughs, and Sherlock follows a second later. The breeze picks up, causing Sherlock’s curls to lift and fall. John feels an unexpected stab of sorrow, of unknown origin, and then his mind provides the reason, reloading the last eight hours— The Woman’s Tune— his outburst—
If Sherlock survives, he’ll either quit smoking, or smoke two packs a day. Living and dying are, after all, the same equation, they tend to the same limit, and having the process conducted on one’s own terms now seems a squandered extravagance.

It’s a rhetorical question, and while John doesn’t expect an answer, it won’t stop him from being angered at Sherlock’s non-responsiveness. John’s aggressiveness can be like flame to phosphorus, and doubly visible.

The phone rings, insistently. John rears his head, groggily, and silences it. A short respite, and then the phone shifts, bit by bit on the wooden top of the nightstand, with repeated vibrations. John burrows into a pillow, and then surrenders, checking the display. It is 3:06 am.
John snatches his cane and hurries up the stairs without looking back, through the chequered tables and into the night air, where he finally takes a deep breath—then another—
“Sherlock,” John leans forward, placing a tentative hand next to Sherlock’s. The fiddling stops.

John’s body has been laid upon the kitchen table, still naked, amongst the beakers and test tubes. Sherlock sweeps it away hurriedly, all onto the floor- there is the tinkling of breaking glass, and a hiss of spilt chemicals- a Bunsen burner clatters to the ground, noisily-

. Look at me.”
“Brilliant,” he exhales. “Beautiful.” And in John’s mind, there is a secret ambiguity to these compliments, a slyness he can get away with, where Sherlock can’t possibly know John means both the performance and the performer.
It’s The Woman’s Tune. Not The Woman’s Ringtone, that’s different, John reserves a special, nostalgic annoyance for that text alert. No, it has been a long while since this music haunted him.
“Good. And are you, er, quite done with this riveting tale?” It’s tricky, but John reckons he’s got this three-layered tactic of Sherlock’s well and truly spotted. It’s when he tries to sound distracted or bored, while trying to sound interested, while

But John turns back sharply before leaving, the movement seizing something swiftly in Sherlock’s stomach. For an instant John’s face is unguardedly upset: the corners of his lips pulled down and parted, eyebrows drawn in together.

John walks back to the partition, and comes up carefully behind his own chair, hovering. He drags a sleeve across his mouth. The stance seems deliberate, as if the solidity of the armchair is an acting fort. Cushioned protection from Sherlock. He digs the heel of a palm into his eye, muttering, “S’only been a day.”
“Is that…is that my cardigan?”
“Right.” A beat. “I have
John presses a clumsy kiss to the corner of his lips, then his cheek, and rolls off. He takes his penis in his hand, fist moving in a blur, and Sherlock clambers on top of him. He plunders that wry little mouth with his tongue, dipping in and out, swallowing all of John’s moans for safe-keeping, pinching and rolling John’s nipples between his thumb and index finger. When John tries looking away, Sherlock grips his chin, looking right into the blue.
, and
There is an insistent pressure around his numb fingers. John is holding his hand in both of his, squeezing Sherlock’s knuckles together. He can taste sour bile on the roof of his mouth. Then John leaves his hand, and Sherlock’s fingers feel lost.
The final proof. He always suspected it (evidence of absence: can’t prove a negative), but now he
"He was never into practical jokes, but yeah, maybe." John shrugged.
He leans back and away, sitting on his heels on the bed, and Sherlock almost whimpers at the loss of the warmth and contact, but John is still moving, and suddenly his head is down between Sherlock's parted thighs.
"I knew I shouldn't have come" Jake muttered.
He came closer, feeling his breath catch and his eyes sting. He wanted to comfort her one last time, to tell her he's sorry for not protecting her this time.
Until this point John hadn't said anything, but they had been walking for 10 minutes now and he had no clue what the hell was going on.
Later at home, John was changing when his eyes fell on his badge. He gawked at it for a few seconds then smiled. It said J. Watson, not John Watson.
"Why are you doing this?" Rupert finally lost his clam demeanor and snapped at Sherlock. "You don't even know me! And why would I attack John? I just met him! I can't possibly be the murderer!"
Sherlock shook his head, his face inscrutable.
"Hey, fart-face," John takes a step towards him, "Mind your own business, yeah?"
"I cut… I cut you… I cut you with that knife! I felt it go in" He stammered hysterically "You felt it!"
But Mike was looking at the wounds on his face and fingers. Much like John, he was first and foremost a healer and a care-taker.
Sherlock looked at the lovely face filled with doubt and confusion, and at that moment he knew, he had to help John Watson.
"Do you see me?" he asked
John held him in his arms gently like a fragile flower, peppering soft kisses all over his face.
"I don't"
"Was this why you became a doctor?"
"And why were you asking other prisoners questions?"
"It's a key to my flat, so that you don't have to pick my lock and sneak in anymore." John says simply.
"No. How is he?"
What were the odds, really? But John was driven by complete and utter desperation. He could not resist it, he was literally sick with yearning. A constant fever was ever aflame in his heart, and a shiver ran through him insistently. He wasn't even denying it anymore, he had met the love of his life, and he had to see him again.
John shook his head slowly, his eyes going wide.
"Right. What are you hiding from?"
Sherlock watched him pace, running his fingers through silver blonde hair, until he finally collapsed on the stairs with a shuddering breath. Sherlock kneeled in front of him. He wanted to see if John could look at him again… see him, so he waved a hand slowly between them, but John didn't seem to notice anything. He looked lost and tired and anguished as he gazed into nothingness. Sherlock had never seen so much emotion in one human face, it was amazing.
"Don't be ridiculous. I can't be impossible, I exist."
"How could you possibly be sure I'd be able to get you to the hospital in time?"
John tried his best not to snort, and quickly intervened before the situation deteriorated.
"I can't John, I'm still in prison uniform, and the only person who knows I'm undercover is my obnoxious brother."
"How did you know where to go?" John asked again.
"You brought food" he glanced at the table, but didn't seem like he was excited about the idea.
John failed to stifle a laugh but didn't answer.
"I don't know. Sometimes my head feels too empty." He paused for a minute, smiling at the fact that Sherlock was so talented at making him talk, he could get a murder confession out of him if he wanted to.
It wasn't long before John was breathing deeply. His right hand was lying on the bed so close to Sherlock's face, tantalizing him. It was warm and unbearably comfortable, and Sherlock couldn't stop staring at John's mouth as he took deep steady breaths.
"That's me. All those cells. That's all you are. That and all the space in between" John said.
I hope you liked this. I'd like to thank everyone who left comments and kudos, you guys encourage me to write more and better and you're just lovely, seriously thank you!
"I'll make tea"
"You want me to baby-sit some delusional friend of yours as a favor," Sherlock glared at him, he really wasn't that desperate for a case after all. "Probably a personal trauma masked by an invented conspiracy theory. Dull."
Suddenly all that mattered in the world was getting his hand there. He swiftly pulled Sherlock's trousers down his thighs, while still kissing and teasing at his nipples.
"Don't move. It's okay, I won't let anything happen to you." He whispered in his ear.
To which Dimmock's annoyed reply was to nip it in the bud or "don't cash your paycheck." When he saw John coming he looked annoyed and gave him a tight smile.
"You should have told me you were coming," Sherlock says, wrapping both arms around her waist. "I would have prepared your bedroom."
They kiss lazily, tasting each other’s smiles.
Still too dazzled by how much John just betrayed about himself in the split second that just happened, Sherlock doesn’t immediately understand what is happening. He watches as John takes another step back, the man laughing next to him. “No wait,” he all but yells in panic. “I choose him,” he says, moving away from the man and reaching for John’s arm. “I choose you.”
“No, it’s fine,” Greg smiles, eyes roaming all over his face, and John busies himself with toast and jam. He hears Greg taking off his coat and sitting down, “I’m barely seeing Sherlock too.”
Sherlock licks his lips, already panting, “Yes.”
He could stay and wait for the soldier to wake up. Last night had been good, really good and Sherlock could still feel John’s lips against his temple for one last kiss, even if none of them had mentioned it at that time. Surely Sherlock could find a way to hold John’s attention on him again.
"Am not," John protests, kicking Sherlock's foot with his own.
Did it feel good?
"Over here," comes an all too-familiar voice.
“I’ve left you a message,” John continues.
I understand, next time.
I could just read his l-
, he thinks.
"And," John continues, "we can't just go trick or treat in the middle of the afternoon."
A long minute passes before Sherlock turns around in his arms, looks directly into his eyes and whispers, “Are you scared?”
“Timothy Tournier and France, Paris Gare du Nord.”
John holds him tighter, “I have never been on the bottom, as they say, but I slept with a few men before.”
Sherlock picks her up, listening to John’s footsteps in the stairs. It is still a bit strange, knowing he’s going to get a kiss as soon as John walks in, but he finds that he cannot wait.
“Most people are boring.” Sherlock replied and turned to face John, “Are you a Christmas person then ?”
Feelings that mean
“I have a feeling you’ve been adding more than there was when you told him,” John says, not sure when exactly Sherlock had woken up and what he already heard.
"Don't mess it up, Lestrade," Sherlock says before leaving the room.
Aware that any movements could wake Sherlock up, John forces himself to relax as much as he can. How many times did he dared to imagine such intimacy? All too much, if he’s being honest with himself. Whether they just spent the night together or not, each and everyone of John’s fantasies end up with a quiet, soft intimacy he’s been dying to share with Sherlock since, well since the very beginning really.
Yes. We’ve received
“Yes,” John smiles against his lips, keeping him close for another kiss. “Let me get my things.”
Street Westminster.
Sherlock feels himself blush again, finding the courage to say, "I wouldn't have minded."
Sherlock couldn’t wait to see Mycroft’s face. His brother had been more than opposed to his departure in the first place, reminding to Sherlock that University would to start again soon and that even he had to study, a fact that Sherlock had proven wrong in a matter of seconds. Of course Sherlock had ignored him entirely, choosing to forget that he was under Mycroft’s care for yet another year and that his brother actually had the power to make him stay in London. But then, Mycroft always knew when to back away.
, he thinks. The perfect to start they’re holiday where they are supposed to be a family and, apparently, madly in love. Sherlock can’t be sulking as soon as they arrive.
Is is supposed to be a joke?

She mumbles back, playing with her favorite toy, and John contemplates going out. Just getting away from these grey walls and doing something, - anything. He should just walk over there, put Rosie in her stroller and go. Just bloody go and deal with this once and for a-
John’s head fall sto his chest, nuzzling against his neck. Sherlock breathes him in.
When Sherlock emerges in the kitchen, coat and scarf still one, and - yes - empty handed, John is almost ready for the wave of relief washing over him.
XX67: Why shouldn’t it be fine?
"I..." John begins before clearing his throat, already at a loss for words.
A second passes, then, "I'm seeing Ella again."
You know…
“No, no, no,” Angelo says immediately. “It’s on the house, don’t worry about that.”
“How did you find me?”
XX67: But we didn’t.
Sherlock walks past him to get the costume Matt had placed on the sofa, "You were right. You should be pleased. Matt is attentive and understands me in many different ways. I'm happy with him."
"You're not an idiot, no matter what I say, and you know relationships aren't what I’m... best at," Sherlock begins carefully. "We've already established that framing Horsen was easier thanks to the whole virgin angle, but it also means that..." he sighs, falling silent.
I’ll just cook
His colleague was eyeing John, clearly not knowing if he should arrest John despite the obvious army affiliation. Sherlock sighed, not quite missing John’s smile as he did, and turned to face the guard.
*	*	*
Sherlock smiles at him, something bright in his eyes, and John knows without a doubt how they’ll end this day.
we came in.
Sherlock obliges him quickly, climbing half on top of him and claiming his mouth again. John lets his hand trails down his back and onto his arse, massaging slowly. With one hand still around him, Sherlock starts to stroke him.
John, too speechless to react in any ways, doesn’t notice Sherlock backing away slowly. He catches his eyes, getting the silent message clearly, and slowly, he turns his back to the two men, walking away.
12:47 Is This Evidence of A Parallel Universe? - Youtube www.youtube.com
“I thought about doing the same so many times,” John smiles. “It’s alright.”
“And what’s that supposed to mean?”
Sherlock doesn’t reply.
John smiles, breathing out deeply at the memories, and he’s just about to pour himself a mug of tea when he hears the gate opening. With a deep breath, he goes back outside, old habits dying hard. He only has to wait a few seconds before a boy appears with his bike and a newspaper in hand. “Oh, hello,” he says when he notices John.
No one replies, and John begins to fear the worst when he catches sight of Sherlock sitting in his chair, eyes closed. "Sherlock?" He calls again, and this time Sherlock's eyes fly open.
"Mycroft, did you do a fucking background check or not?!"
Sherlock glances at him, then his violin, “Now?”
“Oh, thanks. Still haven’t read yours?”
"Are you certain?" Lestrade asks.
Unable to move, John looks from Sherlock to this Matthew, somehow trying to make sense of the situation. Matthew slowly lowers his hand, turning to look back at Sherlock, and the small shrug Sherlock gives him makes all of John's body shudder. No. This can't be.
“Ladies and Gentlemen, the flight 654 to London will be delayed indefinitely. Our flight attendant are at your service for any question. Thank you very much for your understanding.”
“Yes” John moaned, “Definitely” He pressed his lips to the underside of Sherlock’s jaw, pushing the other’s head up and back as he kissed his way down the long neck. When his lips encountered the shirt he reluctantly brought his hands up to undo the buttons, licking and kissing each revealed patch of skin. With the last button he gently nipped at Sherlock’s belly button while his hands parted the shirt.
All the lights are off when they reach the house. Sherlock does find the hidden key very quickly and they make sure to be as silent as possible as they go up the stairs. John goes to the bathroom first, making a quick work of his evening routine and letting the place to Sherlock. He goes to lie down in bed, checking his phone until he hears Sherlock coming back. He puts it aside then, lying down more comfortably. He closes his eyes, wanting to give Sherlock the privacy he needs to get into bed too.
John is smiling, all soft around the eyes.
“Why what?” John frowns.
“I’m standing by my word, you can have the bed.” he smiled and put his backpack down next to a small couch. “I’d just like a shower and later I’ll be fine with this couch. So get as comfortable as you like.”
“Are you coming?” he asks, the words out before he can do anything about it.
I hope you enjoyed this one,
Sherlock smiles, his entire face lighting up, and John holds on tightly to his suit.
“Still,” Sherlock says, “I would have read it from beginning to end.”
Sherlock considered walking behind the desk for a second. It would be the easiest way to make sure his suspect hadn’t booked a private plane, but two security guards were walking towards him. Leaving the desk quickly, Sherlock made sure to lose himself in the crowded hallway, taking of his coat to fit in.
Pauline.

“He should be out of the shower now,” John hurries to say, moving away to let Victor pass. “Come on up.”
John doesn't reply just yet, studying Sherlock closely and realising he had been suspecting something was off for a while now. Ever since Mummy Holmes had called, actually. Sherlock had informed him that they were going to spend four days there, and John had barely been able to ask why before Sherlock had stormed out of the flat. He had continued to avoid the subject ever since, and John had only managed to find out that his parents had been asking to see Rosie for quite some time now.
As you can see, John reacts the only way he can, but don’t worry, it’ll get better !
Frozen in place, Sherlock watched as John secured the man’s arm and feet, his lips moving fast and his chest rising quickly. John was in his element, his body ready for any act of defense from Marks, and Sherlock felt an unfamiliar heat spread through his entire body.
They all stared at him frozen. Susan burst into tears, and Jake put an arm around her.
"Inmates in cell block are compromised lockdown and breached A-wing through the guard's station. A-wing is shutting down"
"Sarah, I can't go to the beach now"
The image triggered a flash of memories in John's mind. Blood, stained wedding bands, vacant eyes. He shuddered and shook his head, secretly thankful that Anderson wasn't looking in his direction.
"Hey Mike. I just thought I'd say hi"
"Why so rude, brother mine?" Mycroft said as he let himself in and sat in the chair across from Sherlock. "And here I was thinking you'd be in a good mood, given the recent… developments." He obnoxiously over-uttered every syllable in the last word with a creepy smile.
"It's not a good time, doc." He said with a huff of annoyance, as if John was the cherry on the top of his shitty day.
"The one who looks like he just smelled a fart?"
"We'll have all the time in the world to prove it to you. Right now I need to show you something. I need your help John, please" his eyes were open and pleading, somehow stripping John of all his defenses. He sighed in resignation and found himself walking behind a possibly insane prison inmate again.
John smiled "Because I like them the most"
"So? They stole one of the guard's keys? Not unlike what you did" John retorted, a tone of anger in his voice.
"Mr. Knight." John called as he sat opposite him.
Your silence is star-like, as distant, as true.
It hit him like a ton of bricks. Everything suddenly fell into place in his head, and the euphoria of it made his heart thrum madly in his chest. He moved away from the window, standing in front of John to shield him from the man he now knew was the murderer.
"Not the way you do" Sherlock said. This was it. John was going to find out, and he would lose him forever.
"Well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, genius and world's only consulting detective, this is a key, and people use it to unlock doors. Awfully useful, you should try it."
"She and I are the same, and I want that. I want somebody who can feel my hand when I touch them"
Molly was still dragging John by the hand and was now heading straight for Sherlock's table. John wondered if Greg had set her up for this.
"I'm really tired, Sherlock. I think I'll go to bed now. I'll… see you around." John says even as he moves towards the door hastily.
"But I didn't mean work." Bill panted behind him.
"She won't understand"
At any rate, this was how Sherlock started working with the New Scotland Yard. Greg and Molly had come for dinner at Baker Street. Though Sherlock had not seemed very interested in most of the conversation, he had turned his head suddenly like a cat once Greg mentioned a particularly difficult case he was working on. Sherlock had asked a couple of questions before announcing "It was the brother in law." They all stared at him until he impatiently explained how he reached the conclusion.
Sherlock pulled him down for a kiss, and John’s groan was muffled in his mouth as he pushed deep inside one last time and came
"What happened?" He asked Bill again "She must have been too young to just pass away."
"I killed her" Henry said in almost a whisper, and John shivered at the cold, lifeless voice.
"Young married couple found shot to death. Husband was 29, wife was 27. Coroner thinks the husband put a bullet in his wife's head, then turned the gun on himself."
"Sure doc." Dimmock glared at Sherlock as he uncuffed him and let him go inside.
"All right. Give me a minute," he said as he turned to look at the room. His clever eyes roaming his surroundings.
"He's an idiot for not introducing us before." John said and made a grab for one of the files.
Sherlock stares at him for a moment, and then suddenly breaks into a mad fit of laughter.
"John Watson!" He said to the receptionist, who looked at him in horror
"Hey there, lovely" John crocked weakly, opening two puffy eyes, looking at Sherlock, and smiling as if he'd just had a long Sunday afternoon nap.
"What? You know him?" Sherlock practically pounces at a startled John, who just stares at him.
"Watson" he answered, still clenching and unclenching his hand, trying to stop the shiver, but as soon as he heard the following few sentences on the other end of the phone call he was wide awake, on his feet trying to locate his trousers.
"What's this for?" Sherlock asked, eyeing the device.
John could only hear gunshots, screams, and a chopper outside. When he opened his eyes, Costello was on the floor bleeding, but Dimmock was nowhere to be seen. John shifted and realized he was being held tightly in Sherlock's arms.
A few minutes later, Rupert came down the stairs from where he had been fixing the leak on the roof. He too said that he did not see anyone leaving or entering the house other than those standing here.
"Yes… yes!" Sherlock answered.
"You started it!"
John forced his brain to function again and willed his mouth to speak.
BTW sorry for all the mistakes I must be making, Sherlock would be appalled, but please keep in mind English is not my first language.
Sherlock's heart beats at an unreasonable rate as he gets in the car and gives the driver directions. His mind is racing. Is it possible that Greg has discovered the truth before him? That with one look at him and John, he was able to observe and assess the situation correctly? Is it obvious to everyone except him?
"Mr. Knight… Henry," John repeated "Do you know where you are?"
"No, you arsehole. I was going to invite you over to dinner with me and Myc, and you could bring that friend of yours we met at the ball. John" Greg smiles and winks.
"It's true"
"Have you packed for me?"
"Perfect" Sherlock said with an air of wonder
"You asked… Mycroft?"
*****
"Max is a cameraman, Rupert is a visual effects artist, and Jake is a director."
"Is this okay?" He asked into the skin under Sherlock's ear. Sherlock hummed in response because that was all he was capable of with John practically worshipping him like that.
Then the smile disappeared and was replaced by a look of such deep concern it made John's heart ache
your work right now, so consider yourself married to me until this case is closed." Almost immediately, he regretted the poor attempt at humor. Alright, change of topics… Go!
"Why do you want him to?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"A game? This was a game to you?" John's voice shakes.
happens!"
"I fell in love"
"I've seen the patient's file, John, and it wasn't your fault"
John stormed out of the operation room and headed for the break room, his anger getting the best of him.
"He sees a crime where others just see personal turmoil.
Once again, I've got to apologize for the pretty lousy deductions, but if you have any suggestions or feedback it would be great to hear from you. Love.
"So why did you do it?"
"They don't have any backpacks on them."
"Is this blood?"
"He can fall. He can give up his existence as he knows it… give up eternity and become... one of us."
"Just trying to fly low, avoid the radar. Do my time and get out." John recognized Sherlock's distinguished voice and posh accent.
To his delight, Sherlock blushes and stares at his shoes for a moment before he replies.
and taste the blood, split, on my thighs of sweetness.
"You never sleep whether I stay over or not"
A high-pitched beep came from John's pocket. He retrieved his pager. "I have to go but I'll be right back" He looked at Sherlock "Just stay right there" He said, as if he was expecting Sherlock to vanish right this moment
"What were you investigating in the infirmary?" he whispered in the dark as he slid down the wall and sat on the floor. He felt Sherlock moving to sit next to him.
Though his ways are hard and steep.
"But I have a friend, he's a police detective. And… for the past two years or so he's been obsessed with a string of deaths."
So, before the door to his flat opened, Sherlock yelled over at Mycroft to go away and never come back, but sadly, you could only do so much when you're not an exorcist.
He closed his eyes, and took an unconscious step back. Somehow, it felt the same as the day he had found them there, the same stab of pain and loss all over again. He couldn’t suppress a startled gasp at the feeling of a warm hand on his shoulder.
When he asked Anderson if he had spotted them lying around, the nurse gave him the look… that look, the one saying he had fucked up. On the first day on the job John was lectured by the warden and almost everyone working at Pentonville about the importance of keeping keys safe and out of reach of prisoners.
If John hadn't dedicated years and years of his life to study the human heart and its every detail, he would have confidently sworn that he felt his heart smash into a million pieces at the moment. Black, liquid ache crawled through his stomach into his chest, prickling and painful in his eyes. He felt his lips tremble, but he pursed them and stepped back
"You want to watch anything?" he said, looking at a spot near the door opposite Sherlock, who sat in a chair by the window. "Me neither."
"But we know who did it!" Max interrupted "It’s the creepy bandaged man from the woods!"
"No" he says before he loses control over the situation and leaves as fast as he can.
"What do I do, Mycroft?"
Sherlock felt it coming, all his muscles tightened. Heat, ten folded, ran through his veins. His hips bucked into the sensation. It was as if lightning struck him with pleasure, he could feel the electricity everywhere, his toes clenched with it, and he felt something hot spurt between them in the water.
"Let's get back. I'm scared." Susan finally spoke. Her face was pale and there were tears in her eyes.
"Henry?"
"Oh, that was smart. I admit that threw me in for a loop at first, but it's also simple. What if the killer wasn't outside at all that moment? What if it was just an illusion? A simple trick using a dummy and some piano wires."
Okay, as promised, happy ending. Of course I cannot stomach sad endings, they kill me!
Sherlock's tired eyes remained fixed on John's face as he gently cleaned the cuts on his face. He stared at him, as if contemplating a treasure he was afraid of losing.
Theses pains were too spread across to pinpoint in one place. Other pains were different. They stung like a hot needle on the side of his lip, above his left eye, and on the tips of his fingers. These felt hot and piercing, calling for more attention.
Sherlock could not feel the cold breeze on his face as he climbed onto the ledge, but he knew he would soon. He lifted his face to the heavens, and spread his arms for one final embrace of life as he knows it.
He was engulfed by the taste and smell and sound of his lover, it wasn't long before he was relishing a creamy warm liquid as Sherlock came with a shout, and it wasn't long either before John was having the best orgasm in his life.
Once has was finished with the procedure, he stepped out of the OR and into the adjoining empty room. He sat and tried to take long deep breaths as he stared at the floor.
He was silent for a moment as he took another bite "You wake up all smelly, and aching from head to toe and hungrier than you've ever been, only you have no idea what hunger is or any of that stuff... so it's all really confusing and painful, but very… very good"
"You ought to remember, caring is not an advantage." Mycroft pulled him out of his reverie.
"He got away when he heard Bill and the others approaching. I didn't… I couldn't do anything before checking on you." John explained, still staring at Sherlock, as if fearing he'd disappear any second.
Back at his flat, John sat in a comfortable chair, head thrown back, and a cup of tea in his hand. Sherlock sat opposite him, wondering how a mortal could look so angelic. Once more, he tuned in to John's beautiful brain. He had grown addicted to the lovely swirl of thoughts, random but fascinating. However John's thoughts right then were serene murmurs, almost like a prayer:
Dinner was brief and everyone talked amicably. They laughed as they told embarrassing stories about each other from their days at uni.
"I couldn't have if you hadn't pointed out the photos to me. Sentiment." He rolled his eyes.
At first Sherlock didn't seem to pay him any attention, but then he suddenly lifted his head and eyed him suspiciously. He seemed to be trying to decide on what he wanted to say. John simply watched the strangest expressions of confusion and puzzlement pass through the pale face before he finally spoke.
The man was put in a chair in the tiny room, he was aimlessly staring at the wall, looking almost catatonic.
"I have a feeling"
"Yes. In the past 27 months, there have been three cases in London of supposed murder-suicides among couples married little more than a year."
Second chapter is on the way. Thanks to anyone reading!  xoxoxoxo
John opened the door to 221B after a long day at the hospital. He was looking forward to seeing Sherlock and basking in the beauty and unconditional love that he emanated.
"I can't see you, but I know you're there"
"No. You were in your REM stage of sleep judging by the continuous movements of your eyes, plus rapid respiration, face expression, and restlessness. What were you dreaming about?"
"Yes, and I don't think this is the best subject to discuss right now, yeah?" Susan snapped, then gave them all a fake smile as she tried to recollect herself.
Greg stared at the phone screen, unable to think of anything to say back to that until another text arrived.
"You know my last name"
Important discoveries are made.
"It's impossible"
Sherlock laughed, and they both sat in silence for a long time.
His heart sank and his brain froze. The bandaged stranger was looming over them, holding his axe above his head.
"I play the violin, and sometimes I don't speak for days on end" Sherlock suddenly said in a perfectly neutral voice.
"I love you" John said once they broke apart, relishing the warm breath on his face.
Sherlock didn't care, he had John, alive and safe, in his flat… in his bed, and he wanted to stay locked with him in their warm cocoon, to kiss and touch and smell him every waking minute of his life.
Greg stared in agony as golden skin glittered with sweat, he hungrily watched the muscular shoulders moving gracefully, the blonde sparse hair on John's chest barely visible on equally golden complexion, he waited desperately until John finally… finally pushed down his trousers and pants.
For a moment John was a bit startled. He hadn't really known what to expect when Greg told him about some friend who can help with the case, but he definitely did not expect a young man looking like a super model, sauntering into the crime scene as if it was his living room. They shook hands and John tried not to stare.
"Just... you. I bring you along on a trip to relax and
Once the decision is made to abandon the pants, Sherlock quickly throws on his shirt and slips into his trousers. He is fastening his last button when a voice comes from the bed behind him.
Mycroft stood facing the sun, eyes closed. The others had been there already, all facing the sun, long black coats rippling in the wind. It was a formation, a ritual as old as time. Everyone would welcome the rising sun every day. No one questioned it. Sherlock rather liked it.
He sees a pattern where others see only random tragedy. He can't find proof but he won't believe anyone who'd tell him otherwise either."
"I don't feel taken advantage of"
Next chapter is the last one :) Thanks so much for reading!
John nods slowly "He never recovered. Never got over it. I tried to help, but he didn't want my help." John smiles sadly at him, and Sherlock feels like he wants to hold him.
The door was wide open, crime scene tape, technicians, crackling sounds of radio, and the smell of death…
"I'll see you." Sarah smiled warmly at him and left the room.
At that precise moment, thunder struck loudly outside, and all the lights went off, drowning the place in complete darkness.
He had fallen asleep in a chair by Sherlock's bed after tending to a severed toe. Officers claimed he had sustained it by stepping on a sharp tool. Rubbish.
"Who are you?"
John's mind was still racing. He was thinking of everything Sherlock had said. It was silly and childish of him, but all he could think of was the fact that he had only been a pawn in his scheme after all.
"How did you two meet?" he asked, this time observing every change in Greg's expressions.
"So, how do we play this? You hook me up with a few a few weeks' supply?" he asked rather playfully with a mischievous grin.
"Oh my God. Come on, take these off, let me see"
"What's yours?"
"Don't be ridiculous" Sherlock says, not lifting his eyes from the heavy book he is reading "There's never food in my fridge."
“You did everything you could” the reply came calmly and confidently
He began with small licks, afraid that this would be over too soon, and caught with the tip of his tongue the thin stream of cum that was running from Sherlock’s pink ring of muscles.
He had just finished with the last patient when he heard voices outside the door. He listened to the conversation intently.
"I'm not. Look at the grooves that the piano wires made on the railings outside. As a special effects artist, you'd have plenty of experience rigging up a thing like that, Rupert."
"I was there in the stairwell... when you cried for your patient, and I touched you. Remember?"
"That’s not what people normally say."
Greg latched on with his lips, sucking the pink ring as his tongue probed deeper chasing after whatever was left of John’s essence, and hoping against hope their mouths would meet somehow on Sherlock’s body.
"I would appreciate it if you didn't move. No need to wake him up." He nodded at Sherlock "This is more about you, really."
He tried to move again but he was shaking so violently he could not control his limbs. He turned his face to see Jefferson staring back at him, tears were now falling from his eyes, digging pale paths on the grimy face.
"North. Uh, Scotland" Greg hastily interjected.
John fell silent. The conviction with which the man spoke was incredible
"So, you and John, how are things?" Bill asked as he blew air into his fists to warm them. Sherlock glanced at him suspiciously before turning back to search for a blonde head among the dense trees. He soon spotted Susan's red coat and changed direction, Bill at his heel.
"What? Are you sure? I mean… it was just a fraction of a second, I don't remember noticing…"
He leaves one hand pressed next to John's head on the wall and trails the other down his lovely neck, and then further down to feel muscles moving softly over the heaving chest. He breaks the kiss and John almost whimpers and looks up at him, already drunk with lust.
"Hey, that wasn't just me" He giggled, actually giggled! God, how the hell did this turn into flirtation so quickly?
Sherlock frowned at the question, but the people standing above him were now looking behind them at a medic who appeared out of nowhere
John found himself wondering what he was thinking about for some reason.
Sarah looked puzzled and just a bit concerned, and well of course she had a reason to. John smiled "You were right. I'm not okay, I'm going bonkers"
"Maybe, but here I am very much alive, aren't I?"
"So, um… Happy Halloween, I guess." John said as they finally shut the door to 221B behind them.
"Anyway, it was a long time ago." John holds his hand tenderly as they get out of the car, and he doesn't let go all the way to the building.
He leaned slowly and pressed a kiss to his forehead, and Sherlock suddenly went tense, seemingly realizing what John was about to do, but there was not time to do anything. It was already too late.
He fell silent. John had had trouble sleeping since adolescence. His insomnia had helped him through med school, but definitely not in his work life.
"What? Why not?"
"He does look like that, doesn't he?" He has this habit of turning his face away when he laughs and John adores it.
He unlocks his door and gets inside, only to come face-to-face with a long figure sitting in his sofa in the dark, holding his pen light and one of his medical textbooks. John flinches, his heart jumping wildly before he realizes it's Sherlock.
John gets home after a long day at the hospital. His shift has been even more exhausting than usual, and he just wants to lie down and not think of anything until next morning. Maybe he'll pop in on Sherlock, he thinks smiling to himself, and watch crap telly with him or look at his disgusting experiments.
When they finally reached the other edge of the bridge of death, they were able to take a good look at the estate. It was a rather big house, one of those old Victorian houses, but it was obviously renovated and regularly maintained. Still, there was something haunting and morbid about it. This coupled with the fact that it was tucked away in the middle of the forest without internet or phone reception made Sherlock make a mental note to pull a full-fledged sulk later on.
The fancy hall is already buzzing with guests in sparkling dresses and dark suits. John heads to get drinks but Sherlock grabs his arm to stop him
"Am I too late?" Sherlock said miserable as he took John's hand.
"Why are you giving me a key" Sherlock rolls his eyes.
"But I don't want to do this anymore, can't do this anymore." John whispers as if every word is costing him so much.
She leaned in and kissed him, and he kissed her back, still trying to wrap his head around all of this.
Right, Sherlock had to focus now. He turned to the woman standing over her daughter. She was so agitated, her thoughts ripped through his own head immediately: "oh god, what do I do? Alright, stay calm, you can reduce her temperature with a cold bath before going to the A&E." Sherlock watched as she scooped her child, whispering reassuring words to her as she put her in the cold tub. The little girl, Samantha was her name, started sobbing weakly, until her eyes connected with Sherlock's.
