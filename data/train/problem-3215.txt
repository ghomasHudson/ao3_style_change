in your presence is better than nothing at all, but this-this I cannot watch. Watching you crumble beneath the burden of that mark is something I refuse to see. You are going to destroy everything I have ever sacrificed for you." Castiel cannot fathom the gall of the man in front of him. Why must he be like this?
She smiles at the answer. It's totally their thing, and it warms her heart to know that even though the two lovers (and Sam) might be having issues, they can fix this. Like they always do. She briskly walks to the kitchen and busies herself for a little while.
"Subtle, Sammy," Dean called out to the back of his brother's head as he walked out into the night. It seemed that as the door closed, all the air left with Sam. Dean had no idea where to start and the silence kept dragging on, becoming heavier with each passing moment. Where had his honesty and courage gone? With his memories back, it seemed that there was no longer any room for them.
"You were doing just fine," answered Castiel cheekily. He tried to bring their lips back together but his progress was thwarted with a finger on his mouth.
Castiel takes a second to breathe and calm himself before resting a tentative hand on Dean's knee. If Dean has been forced to make a decision then the least he can do is make it easier for him. "I will leave now, then," he answers before softly getting up from his seat and making his way out the bunker.
"Aw, come on. You need some cheering up! We've got ice cream in the freezer, the only thing we're missing is some cookies and an awesome movie!"
"You were dying, Sam. He told your brother that he was Ezekiel, and by the time I met up with you guys, I no longer had Grace and therefore couldn't differentiate him from any other Angel. I know that this doesn't justify your brother's actions, but he thought he was doing the right thing," Castiel consoled.
"Hasn't worked much so far. Plus, this is totally a one man job. I'll stay here in case Kevin comes back," answered Sam quickly.
Castiel whimpered when Dean got up to rummage through one of the drawers for lube. When he turned back around, Castiel was running his hand along his length.
They were minimalist in nature but they were still distinguishable as himself and Dean looking into each other's eyes, as was their habit. The shorter one had blue eyes, and the wood in place of his hair was stained dark brown and had miniature wings placed on its back. The wings were painted black with blue highlights. Castiel is sure he has never made his wings materialize on this plane in front of Dean before and is surprised that the man instinctually knew what they looked like. The taller one has green eyes and little dots for freckles all across the cheeks.
A muffled “jerk!” came from beneath Sam’s pillow in response. Castiel huffed in annoyance from his spot on Dean’s bed. He was dressed only in a tee shirt (Dean’s) and a pair of boxers after their shower earlier.
He couldn't keep the tears of joy from coming down his face. He had been aware enough to stay invisible so that he could spend the next few hours watching over his charge without startling the humans. As Dean was whisked away from his parents to the ward where they kept the new borns, Castiel took it upon himself to follow the baby down the hall. He checked to make sure that his charge was free of any and all ailments and that he would sleep comfortably. The Angel couldn't keep the fond smile off his face for the entire time that he spent in his charge's presence. The hours seemed to fly by before Castiel remembered that he had left his garrison mid-practice. He lovingly gazed at the miracle in front of him, and leaned down to press a kiss to his brow. He spared one last caress to the cheek of the slumbering baby before he flew back home.
In an unabashed manner, Castiel found himself settling on the bed. What a relief it was to drown in his favorite scent. Before he knew it, he was sound asleep.
"Shhh, sweetheart. It's alright. Be patient, I ain't through with you just yet," the eldest Winchester breathed against plump lips.
"I wonder if that Angel's ass was just too innocent for the likes of the Winchester, and he's decided to replace him with our previous King," taunted the Demon to his fellow loyalists.
Alright, lovelies! I've caught up now! Chapter 7 is being written right now and it's almost halfway done, so don't anticipate a long wait :)
"Cas! Cas, baby, come on. Wake up!" Dean shook the Angel's body until he saw Castiel's eyes flicker open. "Oh thank God! Are you ok?!" As he asked, Dean took the chance to really look at Castiel and he couldn't keep the tears that welled up in his eyes from falling. There were countless bruises and cuts lining the torso of his lover. Castiel hissed as Dean ran a tentative finger along a particularly nasty bruise along his ribs.
"Haha, Dean, very funny," Sam answered sarcastically with a small smile. That moment of glee didn't last long, however, because Sam wasn't going to just let this blow over. "You know, this isn't the first time that this has happened? I keep noticing chunks of time missing, man. And I keep getting more and more tired, I don't feel like I'm resting anymore. I-I'm scared, Dean," Sam whispers. He feels remorseful about dropping this huge load onto his brother right before he leaves to see Castiel, but he can't keep it a secret anymore. He's not feeling better.
"There ain't nothing easy about this, Cas, and I'm not letting you leave until you've got everything you'll need to survive without us. I think it'll be ok for you to stay at least one night anyway, man. C'mon," said Dean as he turned to lead them away from the stairs, but was stopped when Castiel tried to pull out of his grip.
“Ok, we’ll come up with something for next time. But for now…I say we take advantage of the fact that my brother is gone,” Dean smirked.
"Well, it's not your day for getaways, is it?" asks Dean as he roams around, trying to find a way out of the house. The Hunter takes a moment to calm himself. He can't allow his attitude to get in the way of their escape. "Alright, so tell me about Cain."
The drive back to the hotel was fairly short, and the boys decided to stay the night before making the drive back to the bunker the following day. Sam quietly and quickly gathered his things as Dean puttered around the mini fridge and passed Castiel a beer.
“Are we expecting anyone else?” asks Dean as he makes his way towards the door. However, before he is halfway there the door unlocks and in walks the one person Sam was unknowingly praying for.
"Fuck, baby, you're giving me that look again and I can't tell who's going to be what this time," Dean said with a breathy voice.
"No, I wasn't pulling your leg, Dean. It is one thing to watch acts of a sexual nature, and quite another to perform them. I am merely more confident in putting what I've learned into practice now that I have some experience," Castiel stated nonchalantly.
Castiel didn't bother hiding the seriousness on his face. "You have lost your speaking privileges, Dean, since you are incapable of taking a compliment."
Dean could only whimper in response. He didn't trust his mouth to say anything coherent anyways. Castiel cannot lie, he had pictured this moment for years, and now that it's here, he is going to revel in it.
Castiel has to fix his features before getting mad at someone that is ignorant of the situation. There is no reason to alienate himself from the people that haven't betrayed him.
"I'm sorry, Sam," Castiel spoke sincerely. He hadn't considered this from Sam's perspective at all, and he can now see the error in thinking so closed-minded. Sam may do things that seem harsh at first, but there is always so much heart in the thought processes he goes through before making such decisions. Castiel can appreciate that kind of thinking now that he has an explanation for Sam's anger. Now he cannot help but feel horrible in helping Dean keep this secret.
"You'll find out soon enough," Castiel answered with a smirk. He leaned forward and kissed his hunter until he could feel them both beginning to nod off. Both men immediately fell asleep after wiping themselves clean with a spare t-shirt that was just within reach.
"I can see that. What about you, handsome?" Sadly, it seemed as if Castiel was not listening. He was entirely focused on the body before him, his eyes hungrily tracing every angle. Desire was the biggest emotion in his expression, but awe was in the forefront.  "Cas?"
"No, Cas, it ain't. It's my fault. All of it. Everything. Sam. Almost lost Kevin. You. I'm sure Crowley's going to find a way to fuck us over either before or after Abaddon. I just-fuck-I'm such a screw up. Fucking poison. You guys should just cut your losses and leave me."
Dean laid an arm around Castiel's waist to bring him in closer before falling asleep with his nose in Castiel's hair.
Castiel was sure there was something wrong when he couldn't get the Hunter to make eye contact as he entered the Angel. That was the one thing that they always shared, a meaningful stare as they became whole. It felt wrong to not have that experience this time. He became still when he realized what was happening: Dean was using him for sex for gratification's sake. He'd never felt so hollow before, and he couldn't keep the tears from welling in his eyes.
The next few minutes were filled with heavy breaths and moans from both men. Dean's could feel himself on the cusp of coming again, but there was something he was missing to bring him over the edge. "Cum inside me again, Daddy. Fill me up," Dean whispered against the angel's lips.
"Hmm," Castiel grunts having nothing else to say. It's difficult enough for him to interact with those he has known for years. He gets the feeling that Charlie isn't easily offended.
"AH!" Dean yelled in surprise. He looked up into blue depths and surrendered himself to the rough meeting of their bodies as Castiel brutally pushed in and out of him. He could feel his cock valiantly begin to harden as Castiel hit his prostate with precision. "Fuck, Daddy! You fuck me so good," Dean whimpered.
"Please what, darlin'?" asked Dean as he made a bruise with his mouth on the inner part of Castiel's thigh. "What do you want?" he urged when he didn't receive an answer.
"I'm sorry, dude, I just wanted the least amount of people to know this secret so that it would have a smaller possibility of leaking. Just don't tell Sam and keep an eye on him for me, alright?" asked Dean as he placed a hand on the honorary Winchester's shoulder. There was nothing wrong with being precautious.
"I'll take that as a yes. Now, you are going to sit here like an obedient dog while I have my way with you," whispered Castiel seductively as he pulled down the rest of Dean's clothes. "Although, 'dog' doesn't quite cover your size. That is quite the behemoth you have there."
"First of all, don't call it copulating, that shit just ain't right. Second, I'm totally into the fact that you're into trying new things," he replied. The Hunter's mind was already reeling with the possibilities.
“Dean, I hadn’t realized this,” Sam began through a fit of giggles, “but you’ve got to be the posterchild for Daddy issues.”
"Please, do," said Castiel as he pulled Dean in for a kiss that set his very soul on fire. They pulled apart just as it was getting hard to breathe. They brought their foreheads together and basked in each other's presence before the blue eyed man initiated another heated kiss. "Fuck me, Dean," he said as he pulled away. Dean shivered again at the state of the shorter man's voice.
Dean looked down at his gun as if it was a foreign object, but otherwise didn't react to what Sam had said. The trio slowly crept towards him. When they were a few feet away from him, he finally looked up at them at all.
“Green, baby, I’m so green right now,” the hunter panted. He was nearly in a place of euphoria with the direction things were going. He thought he was going to be teaching his little angel something new, but this was so much better. Dean heard a loud slap that he was sure was heard all over the motel followed by a sharp sting on his ass that made him yelp. “Jesus H. Christ, Cas, FUCK.”
"Alright. I'm sorry," he breathed. Shakily he continued, "Ok, I-I got home to the bunker last week, and Kevin told me that Sam had been acting weird the whole time I was with you. So we acted like shit was normal, and a few days ago we followed him and he met with Metatron, Cas. METATRON. We don't even know what the hell they're scheming! So we hightail it back to the bunker and set up a trap to catch him. God help me, Cas, I almost lost Kevin to that son of a bitch!" Dean was hyperventilating now and Castiel had to calm him once more before he continued.
It was a good thing that he wasn't looking up when he revealed these things to Dean because he would have seen the exact moment that his brother's heart skipped a beat and broke a little.
“Well…that would be the rugaru barbecue stench that’s followed us back here. I’m going to have to get some freshener for Baby tomorrow because she’s a lady and she deserves to smell clean. For now, though, I need a shower and my four hours.” Dean begins to rummage through his bag for a clean shirt and boxers. He takes one step towards the bathroom before turning with a lascivious look on his face that Sam wishes he could forget. “Ya comin’, Cas?” he asks coyly over his shoulder. He pauses for a second and then continues into the room to start heating up the water.
"It's alright, Cas, I'm nervous, too, alright?" Dean spoke. If Castiel was going to be honest, then so was he.
Castiel smiled and stepped in. He lifted a hand behind Dean’s head and brought their lips together roughly. He was surprised at how he still thirsted for these lips despite having been together and knowing each other for years. “I never get enough of this, Dean.”
"You are truly a work of art," marveled Castiel out loud. He didn't give Dean time to counter his statement before he was running his tongue around his rim. Breathless moans were filling the air before long and were answered by the sound of enthusiastic slurping. The angel was soon working in a finger alongside his tongue, patiently working them until Dean was able to take a second and then a third.
"Wow, Cas, I-I don't even know what to say." And he honestly didn't. What could be said to that anyway?
"I'm sorry, Dean. I thought that was the best way to handle the question of my leaving," whispered Castiel.
Dean leaned down to help bring Castiel into a standing position and then proceeded to carry the man bridal style to the Impala. Once seated, Castiel promptly fell asleep and the Hunter was left to ponder their next move. Neither of them was in a state that would allow them to go back to the bunker that night, but they couldn't stay in this town either. Dean made the decision to drive for an hour and a half before stopping at a convenience store. He changed his bloodied shirt before stepping inside to buy all the supplies he would need to clean up Castiel's wounds as well as some food and water. After driving a few more miles, he found a fairly cheap motel and paid for the night.
Dean dropped his phone on the counter and pressed his palms into his eyes. Great, why couldn't he tell that Sam was only joking? "Fuuuuccccccckkkk, I need a drink," said the older Winchester as he made his way out of the kitchen and into the library. The Men of Letters were so damn classy, they had booze where they read.
Castiel seemed to grow more and more annoyed as the silence stretched. Dean knew that Castiel had at least surmised that the topic was sexual in nature, and despite Castiel’s reservations about being overtly sexual with things in front of others, he was never one to shirk away from his appetite for sex with Dean, and he was always willing to scratch things off of Dean’s kink list.
"It'll be fine, Cas," consoled the younger Winchester. Sam honestly doesn't know what to do right now. Too much has transpired in the past week for him to be able to comprehend fully the circumstances they are in right now.
"Yes, of course, Dean. I will leave immediately. I am in Oklahoma so I can be in Lebanon by this afternoon at the earliest, beloved. I will call you when I get a bus ticket with all the information."
"As you wish," Castiel purred. Removing his fingers he grabbed the lube again and squeezed a fair amount onto his hand and rubbed it onto his erection. Castiel gripped his Hunter by the hips and flipped him over onto his back in one swift movement.
"You never change, you know that?" said Sam as he steered his brother out of the library. He saw the look that Dean and the librarian shared and gave his brother a glare to which he received a shrug and a smirk. "Alright, so...first, I oughtta go see my History professor. He wants us to write an essay and I'm a little lost on what he wants. After that, I can show you around."
"I fear that he won't," the shorter man spoke with a slight tremble to his voice. Before he could get lost in his memories, he picked up his coffee and downed as much as he could.
“Dean, you should consider going to bed as well. It is very late, and we are planning on leaving fairly early in the morning,” said the angel, full of concern. He would never stop worrying about his human's health as the man refused to acknowledge he needed to change his bad habits.
Castiel was hard in his boxers despite not having touched himself to this point. Every noise that escaped his hunter's mouth sent another bolt of lightning that tore down his spine and went straight to his cock. They should have forayed into this months ago.
“Why? I merely went along with your assumptions of me, Dean. You always assume that I am clueless when it comes to certain things. While that is occasionally true, there are things that I am completely aware of. And while I did not have sex until that reaper a few years ago, I had been watching and listening to humanity for a long time. I know what BDSM and kinks are, I’ve just never acted upon that knowledge. And how does that adage go? Assuming makes an ass out of you and me?” The angel laid back in the bed with a smirk.
Castiel gives a look that Dean hasn't seen in a long time and has to admit he has missed. It's that particular condescending "I'm-an-angel-of-the-Lord-and-I-am-holier-than-thou" expression that is facing him right now.
Kevin looked reluctant at first but conceded nonetheless, what else was he to do? "Yeah, man, I will. Have fun, dude," he ended with a smirk as he exited the room. Dean shook his head with a chuckle and a relieved sigh. He's been skeptical about allowing Ezekiel into Sam without his knowledge because, in his experience, nothing that's supposed to be good actually stays that way. For now, however, he has someone keeping vigilance while he is gone to see the man he loves.
Tight. Hot. Perfect. Those were the only words on repeat as he pushed forward into his lover. He hasn't had much experience to compare this to, but he knows that nothing will ever compare to being with the one person that has ever meant this much to him. "Fuck, Dean, you are so amazing."
"I-I love you, too, Dean," Castiel wipes at his eyes furiously. "God, I love you so much it hurts! I wish that we didn't have to part on such terms but you better go through with your promise.
"Yes, of course. Well, moving past the obvious, I suppose...I think he just really misses seeing me physically. Calling and texting only goes so far and it has been a fair amount of time since I have seen him last."
"Mmmmm, as am I," groaned Castiel. "God, Dean, I can't go faster, but I need more," the Angel panted.
"Go find the blade. I don't want to see you until you've found it. If you come to me without it, or at least information on how to get it, I will not hesitate to kill you where you stand."
"Come on, guys, let's get home," Dean spoke tentatively. Sam saw Castiel's shoulders slump a little before he turned to follow Dean out the door and towards the car and he couldn't help but feel sorry for the angel. He just happened to fall in love with the most emotionally repressed person the world has ever known.
"Alright, Cas. I've got you some cell phones that Charlie rigged for us so that we don't have to keep buying minutes. I'm giving you more than one so that if you lose one or something, you've got another. I got you a couple of credit cards and IDs too so you don't have to worry about starving or not having a place to stay. If we ever happen to be doing a job and you're close by...I'll make sure to bring you anything you need. I just want you to go around and do whatever the hell you want, dude. Sight-see, hike, whatever your little heart desires."
"Whoa, Cas! Calm down, man. Look at me. Breathe just like I am. Good, you're doing good." Sam was giving exaggerated examples of breathing so that Castiel could mimic him. He could only guess as to where the Angel's thoughts have gone, but he could give a very educated guess. Screw whatever the hell was going on between the brothers, Sam was going to beat the shit out of his sibling for Cas' sake.
A nervous cough came behind the two men. “Um. I don’t know if you guys are, but it wouldn’t surprise me if you do.” Castiel shook his head to assure everyone in the room that no, they have not done anything they are implying.
So, this chapter is named after one of my favorite Rise Against songs, and it is very fitting for this chapter. The song tells a similar story to the one I've made for our favorite pair. Good news! I've mapped out the rest of the story (loosely) and there are potentially 7 more chapters, maaaaybe 5 b/c I might be able to combine a few of them if one of them is running a little short. Also, I don't ship Sastiel b/c it doesn't make sense to me. (I won't hate on it though) I just wanted to clarify that even though you are going to get a lot of Sam and Cas interactions for the next several chapters, this is still strictly a Destiel story. Now, I would tell you to enjoy, but this is just another morbid chapter :(
"Whaddaya want, Zeke?" Dean asks with a hint of disdain to his voice. He really, really hates that he's put his trust in someone he doesn't know. Sure Castiel vouched for him and all, but who's to say this is even Ezekiel to begin with?
"Fuck, Dean!" Castiel harshly pushed into Dean as he began to cum harder than he did the first time. Dean jerked himself to the sight of Castiel coming and feeling each spurt of cum join the rest. It didn't take long for him to join the older man in bliss.
Castiel could only thank his absent Father that Dean wasn't with him, but there was the matter of the ticket that had fallen near his feet that would spell out for these renegade Angels where his lover is. He absently put his foot forward to cover the ticket, and merely scowled at his siblings as he pushed the ticket beneath the bench he had occupied.
Dean wasted no time in pulling himself up and dropping down like an old pro. Every time he dropped back down onto Castiel's lap, he'd squeeze while rolling his hips. Each drop would bring a grunt from Castiel. The angel could only hold onto Dean's ass to help leverage and set a faster pace. All too soon, both men could feel themselves rushing towards the finish line.
“I don’t know much right now, Cas, just that you’re my hot best friend that I’ve been stupidly not having sex with. Is there something wrong with me? That guy and that chick didn’t say much.”
"Oh no, sir, we are not going to play that game, mister," she stated as she slapped the table in front of her. "You don't love someone for that long, and let them go at the first-sign of trouble. -Ok, not the first time, but you know what I mean."
"Because there is no one on this planet that gets you like he does and vice versa. Now," Charlie continued, changing her tone. "Kevin told me you guys need my help with tracking down some people, right? When we get the world back in order, we'll make sure to put
"Sorry, Dean. I didn't mean to scare you. I just wanted to tell you something before you leave," finished Kevin with a nervous glance over his shoulder.
"You're not being needy, Dean. You're worried about your brother. I hope my presence will provide you with as much solace as you seem to think it will."
"Are you gonna come all pretty for me?" Dean whispered after a few moments. Castiel nodded and whimpered as he reached down to jerk himself to completion. All it took for the Hunter to follow was to hear his Angel screaming his name. Dean collapsed on top of his lover after he thrust through their highs.
The Angel wasn't mad at Dean, his heart just felt heavy at the knowledge that he was being used for his body, rather than something to love, and use sex as the extension of that love. When Dean had promised to make love to him the first time, he had yet to break it until now. For Dean, though, he'll be whatever is needed.
"Do you recall what I told you at the theater a little while ago? When you called to give me a 1 hour warning of your arrival, I prepped myself, Dean," Castiel explained as he removed Dean's hands from his waist and seated himself on Dean in one quick motion. They both held their breaths as they got used to the feeling of being whole again. Castiel slowly brought himself up and down before gaining a moderate pace. Wrapping his arms around Dean's neck, he kissed at the juncture between neck and shoulder and licked his way to Dean's ear before whispering, " And do you know what? It felt so good, Dean. My body was shaking in anticipation because it knew it wasn't going to have to feel
The Angel didn't have the energy to try to comprehend what he'd just read. He doesn't know who Charlie is, but obviously he has some sort of rapport with Dean. It was disconcerting to know that there were people in Dean's life that he knows nothing about. He was quickly wandering through the halls before he finally just stepped into a random room. He hadn't realized where he'd ended up until he'd been standing in the room for a few minutes. The first thing he noticed was that he was in Dean's room, the second was that his anxiety levels had gone down just from standing there. He gave a frustrated sigh as he sat on the edge of the bed. What was he to do with himself? How can he fix what's wrong with their relationship? That is, if it still exists.
"Dean. Stop it. When we fix your brother, because we will, we are going to all of us sit down and talk. I know that you hate what you have termed hen moments-"
"Yes, the snake was Lucifer, but the Angel on guard that allowed the snake into the Garden was Gadreel." Castiel could see how the words affected Dean, and he wished he could take this all away. Dean seemed to sway on the spot, and the Angel rushed forth to steady him.
“It’s a little difficult to explain, dude. Just go to sleep.” He knew resistance was futile when it came to Castiel stubbornly wanting to know something, but he really didn’t want to have this conversation with his brother in the room.
"Cas, care to elaborate?" asked Sam with a concerned edge to his voice. The younger Winchester motioned for the two of them to sit at the table. He had a feeling that he was going to need to be seated for whatever he was going to learn.
After paying, Dean went to the room and opened the front door as well as the door to the bathroom before going to the car to retrieve an aching Castiel. With the adrenaline and caffeine no longer running through his system, Dean is feeling sluggish and has trouble carrying his lover but somehow manages to make it to the bathtub before he carefully places the Angel down. He then proceeds to unclothe the blue eyed man as carefully as possible, grimacing when pulls a hiss from Castiel.
Dean almost dropped his phone in shock at the voice that was speaking to him and everything that entails. The fact that he didn't know that voice sent a shiver down his spine and made his heart heavy. "Who the fuck are you? And what the fuck are you doing to Castiel?" growled Dean after a quick recovery.
Castiel is in a daze when he finally hears the door to the bunker slam shut, signalling Dean's departure. His heart clenches painfully in his chest, and he can feel the familiar sting at the corner of his eyes. He hates being human, the constant whirling of his emotions is the most annoying thing he has ever had to endure. Emotions are weakness.
Castiel preened a little under the hungered stare of his beloved, and stole a moment to stare at miles of freckled skin. “We need a better cover story, then. It’s not fair.”
“That won’t do, sweetheart. Wanna know what the good ol’ doc prescribes for something like that, Cas?” This time, Dean used his bent forefinger under Castiel's chin to make him meet his gaze.
Who better to sacrifice themselves other than the Righteous Man? His birthright was to become the vessel for the strongest Archangel to help bring about the end of the Apocalypse, so why not do it one more time?
"You are so fucking pretentious, you know that?" Dean angrily exclaimed. "First, you won't tell me why the fuck I couldn't remember
Later, as the brothers and the Angel ate their dinner (Dean's special burgers, fries, and homemade apple pie) Sam decided to break the awkward silence that was suffocating everyone in the room.
"Yeah? Dean spent forever putting it together. Wouldn't let me pick anything to go in there," Sam replied with a pointed smile at his now blushing brother. He totally deserves an award for being the best little bro.
"Here you go, sir, have you and your friend gone through the menu yet?" she asked politely. Castiel chuckled to himself thinking of the only way to make things more difficult for Dean. He promptly releases Dean from his boxers, and sucked him down in one swift movement. He heard Dean choke and cough to cover his moan before answering the waitress. If Castiel could laugh, he would.
"You're not the one that needs to apologize," the Angel stated. Castiel can only hope that he can get over this because this morbid feeling that has been hanging over him for the past 24 hours has been overwhelming.
"What? Why?" Dean couldn't keep the anger out of his voice. Typical Castiel leaving when things got just the tiniest bit difficult.
"Mmmm say it again, Dean," demanded Castiel as he spread his legs to allow Dean to stand between them.
Castiel had spent many years contemplating just WHAT could make the beautiful soul before him ever make it's way into Hell. Sure, Dean was not the most chaste of men, but surely he would have to commit something heinous in order to deserve such a punishment. Castiel for the life of him couldn't fathom anything that Dean would consider doing that would be horrible enough...until he saw Sam draw that last breath in Dean's arms. The physical pain that Dean was feeling was enough to force the Angel on his knees and made him despondent for a few days. It was a wonder that Dean was still able to function under the pressure of such a heavy heart. He could see everything that was going through his Hunter's mind, and gasped when he realized just what would land Dean in Hell. Watching Dean kiss that abomination to seal the deal sent Castiel reeling. He was elated that Dean no longer felt the loss of his brother, but now he was aware that he was going to have to witness his charge get torn apart by Hell Hounds. And not in ten years, but one.
Yet, despite the betrayal he went through with Castiel a few years back, those feelings were ever present. If anything, they were stronger. He knew they had to be because he had found it within himself to forgive the Angel over and over and over. This would probably always be the case when it came to Castiel.
"Because I didn't want to worry you, baby, but fuck, I-I need you here. We've got Crowley doing that thing he did to Alfie when he cracked him open last year to see if we can get to Sam, but I can't watch anymore. Can you take a bus to get here, sweetheart? I need to hold you," Dean pleaded.
. It figures that Castiel would make it here first. He was going to turn around before he was stopped by Castiel's answer.
"He would never have given me the blade. Who can say no to you? Hell, you've even got Angels on their knees for you, darling."
"I missed you too, Sammy. Did you get taller?! Anyway, almost had to beg Bobby and Rufus to give me time off to see you. I had to help them catch this really bad mother of a dude before I earned my time off, as if I haven't already. Grumpy old coots. So how is school going? Is my money making it's way to ya on time?" Whenever Dean asked that question, Sam always felt a little guilty that his brother was having to help him pay for his stay at the school. "Yeah, Dean, they are." Now, big brother has always been a mind reader when it comes to his little brother; he saw that flash of guilt make it's way across his eyes.
"Daddy, please," Dean whimpered. He was trembling with the force of trying not to move. He didn't want to disappoint Castiel on their first attempt at real kink, but he cannot help the fervent need that has awakened within him.
Castiel was in that midway point between the waking and slumbering world when he heard the door to his room open. He doesn't need to open his eyes to know that it's Dean.
"Yeah? What kind?" asked Dean absentmindedly as he got a new spoon to stir the stew with after putting the original in the sink.
Just as he is about to answer Rowena there is another knock at the door. The three occupants of the room look to one another in confusion.
"Sweetheart, would you just let me finish before your mind goes a mile a minute in the wrong direction?" Dean spoke soothingly, rubbing a calming hand up and down the other man's spine. "Now, look at me, Cas. There we go, look at you, gorgeous. Now, how's about a smile for, daddy?" Castiel couldn't keep the corners of his mouth from lifting even if he still had his Grace to help him maintain his emotionless facade. "That doesn't count, baby, a real smile." The Angel found himself obeying immediately, a full smile gracing his lips. "Mmm. Perfect. Now, back to what I was saying before," Dean continued, "I've never done that before but I'm not unwilling to do it if that's what you want, Angel. You didn't hesitate to do it for me so why should I be a hard ass and not return the favor? I gotta warn ya, though, this ass might be the only virgin part of me, but I'm sure it's gonna rock your world better than that chick that had her way with you," he ended with a smirk. Castiel could only look at Dean in shock for a moment before his mouth caught up with his brain. Smirking, he ran his finger back down the cleft of Dean's ass and circled his fingers around his entrance.
"Cas, please tell me that I never had you on the rack. And don't lie to me," he growled the last statement.
"Fuck, Dean. Don't stop. Deeaaaannn." That last version of his name set Dean afire from within. He knew he was close but he wanted to make sure that Castiel finished first.
The Angel sat in silence as he fidgeted with his hands nervously. He obviously could not tell Sam that which he couldn't tell Dean. Or...maybe he could? After all, Dean had asked the same from him, had he not? That line of thought wasn't going to do anything but help the bitterness already present in his heart. He took a deep breath and looked around the kitchen. He knew he would have all the time he needed before he had to speak; Sam would allow him whatever time Castiel would require.
"Sam, it's my job as your big brother to make sure that you get the best of everything, ok? If that means I gotta work my ass of doin' shit I ain't so proud of, then so be it. So long as you get to do what you want and get to be good at it, that's all I can ask for my efforts, alright? Now wipe that guilty look off your face before I punch it off," said Dean sternly. He knows he's being hard on him but he needs Sam to understand that he'd do whatever it takes to make sure he does something worthwhile with his life, and he sure as hell doesn't need to see that guilty expression every time. It'll break him eventually. "*Ahem* So anyway, Sammy, how about you show me all the stuff you been doin'; where your classes are, maybe some of your hot teachers, too," finishes Dean with a suggestive tone and waggle of his eyebrows.
"You never divulged why you specifically kept me for all of those years. That was something you kept to yourself because you honestly had the tools to kill me at your disposal. I can, however give you a guess." When Dean made no signs of saying anything, the Angel breathed to speak again. "I think you subconsciously knew, or hoped, that I would be the one to raise you, but I couldn't take you broken as you were. You cracked your soul in half when you finally succumbed to Alistair's offer," Castiel's voice cracked as he continued. "It took me 35 years to reach you, and by the time I got to you your soul was blemished. It was no longer the beacon that it was when I first ventured into Hell. We know now that I wasn't actually supposed to reach you before then, but it still feels like I failed you, Dean. So I spent those five years doing whatever it took to heal your soul," Castiel finished.
Dean returns to his task and takes Castiel into his mouth. Immediately he feels hands in his hair, gripping almost too tight. He uses his tongue as a distraction for what his fingers are doing.
Castiel sat in his bedroom for a few minutes waiting for Sam to go into his own room. The Angel knows that Sam is aware of his sleeping pattern, and he is grateful that the other man hasn't questioned him about it because his answer is not one that he is comfortable saying out loud. Castiel is not sure that he and Dean are still together, and he really just wants to drown in the scent he has come to associate with love before it is taken away from him for certain.
"That's alright, sweetheart, why don't you lie down for me?" Both men whimpered as Castiel unseated himself and laid down on the seat with one arm stretched back against the door to brace himself. All Dean could do was stare down at other man as he wantonly spread his legs with an expectant look in his eyes. "Look at you, sweetheart, all spread for me, your pretty little hole just twitching, waiting to be filled." It was Dean's turn to talk filthy.
"We're looking for the weapon the Archangels used to kill the Knights of Hell: the first blade. We need it to kill Abaddon." Cain's fist clenched by his side at the mention of that name. "Look, I get it, you're retired. We're not here to get between you and the Demonic AARP, but it's bad out there, and I'm just looking to even the odds."
Breathing heavily, Sam barely registered Castiel stepping out of the kitchen as well. He watched as Dean went to gather the strength for a return punch, but was surprised when his older brother held back.
I totally forgot to mention this before (and if I have, just ignore me lol), but I named this after a line from the song "Hold On" by Alabama Shakes. I tend do this a lot actually, I listen to a lot of music that has a lot wonderful things to say and I use it as inspiration for my work :)
"F-five...five years?" Dean gasped in shock. He held his head cradled in his hands. Out of the corner of his eyes he could see Castiel's hand coming to touch him, but he shook his head. He doesn't deserve the comfort. He watched as the hand clenched into a fist and laid back on top of the comforter. "Why?" he asks simply.
"So, Cas, how'd you like your room?" he asked looking pointedly at Dean. He has seen those figurines, he's not stupid. If anything, it solidified every theory he had about the two men across from him.
"You are enjoying submissiveness in a way I would have never anticipated but perhaps should have foreseen," Castiel observed aloud. He knew in that moment that they were going to have a long discussion before they really delved into this new territory, but for now, he was going to enjoy what his lover was gifting him with. Without warning, he roughly yanked Dean off of his dick. Saliva had collected all around his mouth, creating a picture Castiel hoped he'd never forget. Once more Castiel was pushing back Dean's knees to meet his chest, exposing his hole, and he wasted no time in sheathing his cock inside to the hilt without any gentility.
"Fuck, Cas, are you sure?" Dean whimpered. He merely nodded as he placed a hand behind Dean. The Hunter roughly pulled out of his grip and turned to look away. "I just...I just need a minute. I'll be back. No one bother me." The three men watched as the eldest Winchester walked out of the dungeon.
Castiel was at a loss for words. Dean had been more expressive in the last 4 minutes than he has been in his whole life up until now, and he can't let this go to waste. He brought a shaky hand to cup Dean's cheek lovingly. "Please, Dean. Show me what it means to have wings again," he whispered, "I need to remember what it means to soar."
"You've done so well keeping quiet, beloved, I want to hear everything you've been holding back," the angel cooed softly in Dean's ear.
"It will," Dean smiled. "Feelin' better already knowing that you're going to be here in a bit. Be careful, sweetheart."
Dean chuckled darkly to himself before reaching back into his jacket to replace the knife and fish out his father's journal. He quickly flipped through, skimming until he found the area in it that corroborated with Crowley's story. The Demon meanwhile spared a glare for a man a few stools down before bringing back his attention to the Hunter.
Dean stands up from the bed, and heads to the shower hoping, that metaphorically he can absolve himself from the sins he is going to commit before he actually does them.
“It’s no problem, Cas. I’ll just get us some food. We passed a diner on the way here. I’ll take my time,” sighed Sam. He places his bag on his bed, grabs the keys, and heads out the door. The roar of the Impala filled the room before the two men saw the headlights back up and then turn away as Sam took off.
The man across from him has spent years of his life observing people. Sam knows that he is not getting the entire truth here, but he cannot blame Castiel. Things are different in Hell, surely something happened between his brother and the Angel that just can't be talked about with others. Sam, for what it's worth, will just play along until the next time he sees his brother. Dean is a lot easier to crack, and the younger Winchester is sure that Castiel is keeping something to himself for the sake of his lover's reputation. That dick has no idea just how lucky he is to have someone so loyal to him despite the mistreatment.
"Yes, well, he learned from the best," said Dean as he slowly approached the professor. "You could say, when it comes to performing, I'm the best there is, actually."
Dean's breath hitched the moment he'd been manhandled into position. He was immediately reminded of those times when he'd pissed off the man in front of him enough to elicit being pushed against walls. It always sent a shiver down his spine if he's being honest. Dean could only stare down at the cerulean eyes before him that were beginning to lose the battle to lust. "And how do you know what I have and haven't done, Castiel?" Dean whispered.
For as long as he can remember, he has never felt this particular kind of need within him. If he needed a fuck, he went and found one. Simple as that. From the day he met Castiel, however, his number of conquests has diminished with increasing frequency and his dreams drifted from the voluptuous forms of busty asian beauties to that of a blue eyed Angel. It took him a long time to get over the fact that Castiel in his true form may not have a gender but that he is currently residing in a very male vessel that he won't be leaving. Once he came to terms with that, however, Dean had come to the realization that he wasn't just looking for a one night stand with Castiel. In fact, he caught himself in many a day dream that were entirely too domestic for his consciousness to swallow which only scared him and made him push the man away.
The hunter turned to look at Castiel and he winked and shot a smirk towards his brother. "Sure do, Cas. I was just messing with you guys," he laughed. "Had you goin' for a second there, didn't I, Sammy?"
A few minutes later, Charlie was walking back into the library with tea for herself and for Castiel, the only other person still in the room.
"I'm going to head out first thing tomorrow for Oz." Castiel didn't miss the excited gleam in Kevin's eye.
"On your back. Take the panties off while you're at it." Dean hurriedly complied. As soon as he was settled, he opened the bottle and proceeded to dollop a healthy amount on his fingers before bringing them to trace around his hole. "Quickly, Dean, I don't have much patience left."
. "The most pressing thing that comes to mind, darlin', is that I need to find my baby brother. Whereabouts could I find the Law section?"
"I will take that as a yes," chuckled Castiel. "Could you get on your hands and knees for me, beloved?" whispered Castiel into his ear. When Dean didn't immediately acquiesce, Castiel firmly gripped the jaw of his lover to regain his attention. Lowering his voice, Castiel looked into Dean's eyes and commanded, "I
“And what am I worth to you, Cas?” the taller man asks hesitantly, as if the answer would scare him.
Castiel had to work hard to refrain from saying that his heart can't have what it desires since he is having to leave Dean behind, but he decided against it and merely nodded in response.
"It was better this way. I'd still be there if I had awakened you." Dean knew he was right, of course, but that didn't mean it didn't hurt like a son of a bitch.
"Here," Castiel answered, pushing two fingers inside of himself, hastily pulling them in and out of himself. If the Hunter was going to tease, well, two could play at that game.
An hour later, Dean was freshly showered and finally coming to lay down next to the Angel. It seemed that the moment he laid his head on the pillow, he was met with a nightmare.
"Either way, it served your purposes. I am currently in Alta, Utah. But I want it to be a surprise so tell him that you caught wind of a hunt here and send him to the only motel in town. I will inform you of my room number when I get one."
The Angel spent almost no time packing his things as he usually kept most of his stuff packed in case he needed to make a quick getaway. Looking at his watch, which read 2:30am, he sighed and opened the door to his motel room. After checking out, he began the trek to the station.
"Regardless," Castiel continued, "I thought we were going to participate in intercourse when you arrived."
"You mean the me that cut into you everyday for five years?" Dean shoots back bitterly. Flashes of what he has been remembering the past few months come to the surface, and he feels sick to his stomach.
"Baby," Dean began with a sigh, "Sweetheart, you know I'm shit with stuff like this. Just hear me out, ok?" Castiel nodded as if answering aloud would discourage Dean from continuing. " I uh...when I was younger and exploring my sexuality...Dad caught me with another guy during one of our hunts. Now, he didn't say anything or hurt me, but...he did look at me and treat me different, like he couldn't fully trust me anymore. And-and it fucked me up, ok? After that I started sticking to the ladies to show him I wasn't messed up-"
The Hunter doesn't know if he can handle this, but Castiel has the right to know why he's being forced out the door. He bites down on his lip as he forms the words. "Look, it's Sam," he breathes, "Ezekiel is in him right now and he doesn't know; he's trying to heal himself and Sam at the same time. Zeke thinks that having you around will bring the Angels to us and he says he's not strong enough to take care of us if you attract them here. He told me that if you don't leave that he will and I can't deal with that. I just can't let him leave with Sammy when they're both so fragile, man! God, and it sucks because you're going to think that you're expendable to me and you're not! But I don't know what else to do, Cas!" By now he was speaking through his hands because he could feel a headache coming on and it was hard enough trying not to get emotional while looking at his Angel. Yes, his. He's not sure when he became possessive over Castiel, but he thinks that it probably happened when they were in Hell.
The taller man didn't answer verbally, but he did answer physically. Gripping onto the Angel, he inhaled the freshly showered scent from the pale skin laid bare. Licking a stripe from the base of his neck to his ear, Dean almost effortlessly had Castiel in a pile of trembling nerves.
There was really no way past this but through. “I could show you,” the eldest brother whispered, his blush growing more pronounced. Dean could tell that the angel was still confused, but he could see the arousal in the other man’s eyes, and he could feel Castiel’s cock stir through his boxers next to his left thigh.
In answer, the seraph brought their lips together once more and allowed himself to get lost on the taste of the two of them together. He could only groan in satisfaction. Soon, he was laying kisses down towards perky nipples that were mercifully sensitive and he lost who knew how long teasing them to the point of oversensitivity. Then he continued to map his way down Dean's torso, pausing to lave attention at Dean's soft middle. A perfunctory lick down his cock and balls and Castiel was looking up at green eyes full of anticipation. The seraph grabbed a pillow to lift Dean's hips to a better angle and he spread freckled cheeks and was mesmerized by the delicate pink hole before him.
Castiel backed away to give the other man room to get up and rummage through his bag for the lube. He lay with his back to the headboard, lazily stroking his cock to relieve some of the pressure. He chuckled a little as Dean's enthusiastic return to the bed caused them both to bounce a little.
“Speak for yourself, Samuel, I’d love to catch an eyeful of those two in action.” Rowena looked right at the bed just as she walked in. A pout immediately painting her face when she saw the bed was empty.
“What ever could you be implying, my dear?” he frowned in mock innocence. “Stop covering yourself, Dean. You are obscuring my view.” Dean stopped fidgeting and stood with clenched fists and an indignant look on his face.
The day that Dean was born is one that Castiel will forever cherish. He had been out commanding his garrison on drill sequences when he felt a pull in the back of his mind. He had ceased speaking mid command and flew to the hospital just as his charge drew his first breath. He realized right then that the constant buzz in the back of his mind for the past ten months that had been growing louder and more insistent had been a sign of his charge's arrival.
After a brief pause Castiel takes a breath to say, "Sam, I am aware that you are a perceptive individual. I'm sure you know that Dean and I have-"
"Crystal. We have a deal, Winchester. One of the utmost importance. I do not back off on my word; bad for business. And d'you know if I had a soul, I'm sure it would be heavy with sorrow at the amount of confidence you share in me," the Demon drawled.
In his own room, Dean is restlessly tossing and turning, his stomach in knots. A part of him wants to be selfish for the both of them but the part of him that doesn't want to deal with the aftermath is keeping him glued to his bed. His window of opportunity is closing quickly and here he is being a coward.
Sam is just about tired of seeing his brother moping around the bunker. He's 98% sure that the two men have consummated their relationship (
"Fuck, Cas, what's the lesson I'm supposed to learn here, huh?" Dean whimpered. His baby is way too good at getting him riled up, but this quitting business right before the good part was going to drive him insane fast.
After conversing for a little while longer and bidding each other goodnight, Dean was able to fall asleep with the prospect of seeing Castiel in a week's time to soothe him into slumber.
"I don't have time, Kevin. I'm out, alright? I'll be back tomorrow with Cas. You guys keep working on Sam. Call me if anything happens and let me know if you need to change tactics. You keep an eye on Crowley, alright? Don't take those cuffs off of him and I made a trap at the door to the dungeon so he can't get out. If you think he's doing something you don't like, you drag Sam outta there and you leave that son of a bitch in there to wallow until I get back, am I clear?"
"Is that so, Mr. Winchester?" replied Castiel in a deeper voice as he stepped closer into Dean's personal space. "I refuse to believe that statement without a proper demonstration for proof," he said flirtatiously into Dean's ear causing him to shiver and grasp him by the hips.
"I still should have known better. Just like your brother." Sam huffed in annoyance again. "He did what he thought was right, Sam. I will leave you to rest now."
"Because I am not going to coddle him anymore, Samuel," Castiel stated sternly. "There are consequences to his irrational behavior and he is going to learn one way or another! We are in this mess because I allowed him to get to me, but not anymore. Dean Winchester is going to learn to live with the consequences of rash decisions." Silence commenced while the Angel mentally went back through the argument he'd had just had with the eldest Winchester. He hadn't intended to break up with Dean, but perhaps it was for the best. This way, they could forget. He couldn't keep a stray tear from leaking down his face. He fiercely wiped it away.
"Hey, um, I'll be right back, guys," said Charlie as she stepped out after a tense moment of silence.
Turning off the tap, Dean started to carefully wash Castiel who continued to keep his eyes closed as if he was too tired to hold them open any longer. He carefully avoided the scrapes he had accrued from his torture, but he would accidentally brush something that would make Castiel cry out. Dean could no longer hold back the sobs when he saw the tear tracks traveling down the Angel's face.
When Castiel didn't answer, Dean turned to the Angel and he sucked in a breath at the fear etched on his lover's face.
"I gathered this from the erotic film 'The Cowboy and the Twink', I believe. I have learned how to use the internet on the phones you gave me."
"I just...I just realized that I have to get back to Sam today. And it's a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. I fucking love laying next to you. This past week has been the most relaxing thing I've ever experienced and it's fucking ending."
"Listen, the only other person that I ever felt this strongly for was named Cassie. She and I didn't work for reasons that don't matter right now, but when I heard your name for the first time, I just knew you were going to be something special to me. And you are, man. That whole 'profound bond' spiel that you gave a few years ago is one of many things I would like to call this thing. I just-I want one night with you now as a promise that the next time I see you and every time after that, will end in this way. But it's not about the sex, Cas, I need you to understand that I want to build something with you that will blow everything else away. You're always going to be my Angel, Cas, literally and figuratively and," he said as he brought a hand to the other man's face, "I want to give you your wings back if only for tonight."
"You guys need some help?" The tell-tale sound of a gun's safety clicking off resounded loudly in the large room.
"Dean, shhhhhh it's ok. Relax for me, beloved," consoled Castiel, rubbing soothing circles at the base of his lover's spine. He partially slid his finger out and gently pushed forward once again, this time hardly meeting any resistance. Gradually, Castiel worked up to three fingers in and out of the man before him before neither could take anymore.
"Allow me to exploit it first," answered the Angel with a smirk. The Angel approached the other man with a wild look in his eye that sent another shiver down the Hunter's spine. Dean started to slowly crawl away from Castiel with worry etched on his face.
"I just...I was hoping I would be able to see you. Sam said there was a werewolf case in Utah that I'm gonna take care of. If you were close enough, I was going to come see you, but you're in the opposite direction," Dean answered sullenly.
"I honestly don't know, Kevin, but he's got Cas and I'm pretty sure they're torturing him. Let's hope these guys are stupid enough to keep the GPS on so I can find 'em." Dean leaves the two men to their extraction business as he rushes upstairs to a laptop. He immediately types in the web address for tracking the phone and sees that the phone is in Columbia, Missouri six hours away. The Hunter hurried to his room to pack a bag of random items that he and Cas would need (because he's going to find him without a doubt) and calls Kevin on his way out the bunker to leave instructions.
Dean felt his heart clench a little as his brother walked out of the room, and it really constricted in his chest when he saw the scowl on Castiel's face, the confused gleam from Kevin, and the sympathetic look on Crowley's. He clenched his jaw as he scurried to his room once more. He had a lot to think about right now.
"You're going to play hard to get? We have time for a montage?" retaliated the Demon in a tone full of sarcasm.
"I mean he became the deadliest Demon to walk the face of the Earth. Killed thousands. The best at being the worst. And then he just...disappeared. Everyone thought he was dead-or at least hoped he was." Before the two men could continue their conversation, they were interrupted.
"Like Eden? Adam and Eve? Wasn't that Lucifer?" Dean asked for clarity's sake. He's never been to Sunday School, but he knows that much at least.
"Dean, what's wrong?" questioned Castiel. As he turned to meet his favorite pair of green eyes, his eyes widened in shock at the sheer panic he saw there.
Castiel hesitated here. He had been vague enough so far, but he had now reached territory that he couldn't share with much depth at all. He decided on a partial lie. "I did that which was begged of me by my duty: I needed to replace some of the harsher memories so that he would mentally stay intact. He doesn't know that I am the one that messed with his memories, however. He thinks that I allowed another to do so, and he is cross about it." Castiel finished his statement with an aversion of his eyes.
Before Castiel could continue reminiscing about a time so many years ago, he was interrupted by an awkward cough.
"Oh, shit, Daddy, yes!" Dean moaned. Who knew the literal angel in the room was going to be the one with the dirtiest mouth?
"Hey, baby, I found a casual looking place that we can try," Dean said sheepishly as he makes his way off the highway.
"You know, I'm not sure when you started calling me that, but I really, really love it. Now, get on that bus before I glue you to my side," said Dean as he gave a playful slap to the Angel's rear. Castiel placed his bag in the compartment underneath the bus and slowly made his way to the doors. He hesitated on the first step and turned around and grabbed onto Dean sobbing and grasping tightly at the Hunter.
The Angel pulled out all the stops and worked Dean until he could feel the hand gripping his head almost unbearably tight. Clue number one that Dean was close to coming. It was at this moment that the Angel shoved Dean back into his pants and made his way back to his seat. The incredulous look that was staring back at him did nothing to deter his happiness.
"I would love that," Dean could hear the smile in his Angel's words and couldn't stop the one that was now making it's way onto his own.
Just when Castiel could no longer hear her footsteps, he felt a hand grab his hair forcefully causing him to moan. "Cas, I don't know what the hell has got into you but you better hurry this up. Put that pretty mouth of yours to work. Quick," growled Dean, muffled somewhat through the obstruction of the tablecloth.
"What is going on? Why are you talking like this?" asked Dean perplexed. What has gotten into the Angel? None of this is making sense. He found a solution to their Demon problem, and here he is being chewed out for it.
"That so?" he smirked, "Well, I hope I don't disappoint, professor. I haven't had the distinct pleasure of hearing about you, I'm sad to say. I move around a lot and Sammy here can't get a hold of me often. I hope he's doing good in your class," Dean says with a mock stern look towards Sam.
"I'm sure Cas knows what got into you," countered Sam with a wink. He loves poking fun at his brother and he totally walked right into this one. Too bad the joke was on him.
Sam gave a humorless chuckle before continuing with his interrogation. "I get why my asshole of a brother did this, but why did you keep this from me? I thought we were friends, Castiel!"
"You know what, never mind. Forget I called, Cas. I'll talk to you later." Dean abruptly hung up and immediately regretted doing so.
"I love you, too, Dean," replied Castiel. After reaching up for one last kiss he finally made his way onto the bus. The men stared at each other until the bus finally made its way out of the lot. Dean let out his frustration with a cry to a God he really hopes still has His ears on. It's not fair that Dean Winchester has to make the hardest sacrifices.
"I promise, sweetheart. Come on, let's pack the car and I'll drive you to the bus stop," said Dean before he lost his resolve.
"Why would I fix this?" Castiel has been working hard to be open to Charlie, but he's not going to just sit there and be told what to do. He mentally pauses when he realizes that that is a trait he must have picked up from Dean. He is caught between wanting to slam his fist down on the table, and quirking a smile.
A few days later, Castiel and Sam were doing research for the second or third day in a row. They were getting antsy for Kevin's return with Charlie, so they decided to look through the library for possible solutions to pass the time. As the clock chimed one in the morning, the Angel decided that he'd had enough for the day.
"You're problem, mate, is that nobody hates you more than you do. Believe me, I've tried." Well, isn't that just part of his charm? He really cannot believe that he is hearing this from the King of Hell of ALL people.
Dean scoffed and everyone practically heard his eyes roll. “Whatever, Dad,” he responded sarcastically as he made no move to go to bed.
"I wasn't asking you, Blue Eyes, I was telling you," she smiled. She pushed him towards the cupboards and yelled out ingredients for him to take out while she dug through the refrigerator.
Castiel heaved a great sigh of relief at that knowledge. He slowly reached his hand over until he could intertwine their fingers. "I'm glad that you were just as nervous as I am. I was worried that I was the only one and that I would disappoint you," he whispered.
The moment that Dean pulled Baby into the garage, he tore out of the car as if electrocuted. Castiel steadily walked to the trunk and took his and Dean's bags out before heading inside. He knew that Dean would first go to check on Sam so he headed to place their things in the Hunter's bedroom first.
"Alright, hold on. I'm almost done here." Dean takes off the last piece of his lover's clothes and turns on the water to a comfortable temperature before retrieving a bottle of water from the adjacent room. Once he deems the temperature adequate, he puts the stopper down to allow the water to collect. Dean places a hand behind the Angel's head to bring him forward enough to drink from the bottle, only allowing him to sip at the water. Too much at once and Castiel would only throw it back up. Knowing that cleaning the other man was only going to get himself wet, Dean undressed until he was only clothed in his underwear before he bent back over Castiel with a washcloth in his hand.
"Dean," he spoke turning to the hunter, "When I was being held hostage I vaguely heard something in a half delirious state that I deciphered just now. Ezekiel died in the fall. And if this is Gadreel, then we have more to fear than I thought."
“Guys. Guys, wait. Who’s the hot guy? Is he someone we know?” Dean interrupts just as Castiel opened his mouth to reply. There was a shocked silence for a few seconds before Rowena and Sam laugh so hard they have to cling to each other to keep from falling over. The angel turns red in the face and looks at the far wall to his right.
Dean couldn't keep the tears from escaping his eyes either, and he let himself hold his Angel for a minute before pulling back for the last time. "Come on, Cas. I need you to be strong for me, ok, sweetheart? 'Cause I can't trust myself right now. I want to bring you back with me so fucking bad, but I can't. So I need you to be strong for me, ok?" Castiel slowly nodded, wiping at his face. "Good. I love you so much, baby. I need you to know that, alright?" whispered Dean with a quivering voice.
"Because fucking enough girls gives you a good idea about what feels good to the dick ramming in and out of you," he answered, face slack with pleasure at his lover's ministrations.
"Shhh," interrupted Cain. As soon as the man brought his finger down from his lip, Crowley was no longer able to form words.
After eating dinner, Dean begrudgingly dragged Castiel to the theater to see some cheesy rom-com. He was loathe to find out what other sadistic ideas his lover had in mind, and for the first thirty minutes of the movie he was tense and hardly paying attention, but after thinking that maybe Castiel was done with lesson-teaching he finally relaxed. Dean had chosen the seats in the back just in case.
Sam heard the yell from across the bunker and immediately sent a text to the Angel. He hadn't expected his brother to be yelling angrily.
It is quiet for a moment longer before Dean replies. "Cas, look, it's not you. I kinda prayed to you the other day before I found out you had your Grace taken, but...I've already forgiven you, buddy. For everything that you've done and might do because, honestly, I'd rather have you in my life for the wrong reasons than not in it at all for the right reasons, d'you understand?" He reached out to grip Castiel's shoulder and felt that he was shaking. He wasn't prepared for the crying face of the Angel in front of him. And that's "Angel" with a capital "A" because he will always be one to Dean.
After eating a simple breakfast with Sam and Kevin, Castiel took to walking around aimlessly throughout the bunker. He had the whole day to kill, and so he meandered in and out of rooms for hours without paying much attention. He spent a lot of time in the storage room, rummaging through odds and ends he came across. One item that caught his eye was a box that wasn't as dusty as everything else in the room with a note on top. It read:
"Yes," he answered simply. He paused before continuing with, "I hadn't anticipated the Grace dampening shackles, but I had a mission. I had to restore you body
"Wha-what're you doing here? Please tell me you're not the werewolf!" pleaded Dean. In his defense, he's still a little groggy. Not the best thing when potentially fighting a werewolf, but what can you do?
The Winchesters spent all of yesterday trying to figure out how to get Dean out of his memory predicament which has only worsened the longer Dean is under the spell. The icing on the cake was finding the witch that cursed the elder brother dead last night. Now that means he has to resort to calling Rowena again, and he really doesn’t want to owe her one. But for his brother, Sam would do just about anything. Except…
With a slow, dirty swivel of his hips, Castiel began a brutal pace that caused the headboard to hit the wall behind it. He was quickly racing towards the finish line.
The eldest Winchester wouldn't meet Castiel's eyes the entire time that he was taking care of the abrasions on his lover's torso and it tore at the smaller man. He needed the reassurance that only meeting Dean's loving gaze could bring him. The longer the silence bore down on him, the harder it was for the Angel to keep his tears at bay. He heard Dean's breath hitch when one landed on his hand.
"Oh, well, 'sweetheart,' and I are getting reacquainted. Much time has transpired since we last saw each other and there are some things we need to talk about." There was a grunt and muffled scream that made Dean's stomach turn in knots.
"And how do I know this isn't a trap?" asked Dean with trepidation. He's had too much bad luck recently, and he would rather not add to it.
Castiel merely shook his head. Sam didn't have time to ask just what happened when he heard his brother come into the room. He saw his friend immediately tense. Sam fixed his brother with a glare before turning to leave. "C'mon, Cas, let's go back to the library." He didn't want to subject his friend to his brother's presence.
"As in Cain and Abel?" Dean decides right then and there that if Crowley is lying to him, he's killing him and he'll just have to figure out the Abaddon stuff on his own.
He knows that Dean is trying to focus on the road in front of him but fails to do so, and his mind wanders into territory he isn't equipped to handle. The latter is evident in the way his knuckles will turn white from the force with which he is gripping the steering wheel.
"Isn't that a good thing?" hesitates Charlie. The Angel turns a stern look to the unsuspecting ginger causing her to flinch.
After taking a detour (that left Dean feeling a loss he couldn't place...he keeps thinking about the color blue for some reason. And not just any blue, we're talking deep ocean blue), he and Agatha made their way to the Law section of the library where Dean saw the hunched figure of none other than his brother Sam.
"It's a code. One of my dad's storage lockers," Dean concedes. "He may have put something about the case there."
"I didn't say that I don't love my dick of a brother. I love him more than anything, he's all I've got in this world, but I was done. He needs to let me go."
Dean stopped midway from removing his shirt to chuckle, "You know, I was starting to feel a little guilty about corrupting an Angel, but considering what you said earlier and just now...you've been a dirty, nerdy angel loooooooong before I came around. Actually, have you been pulling my leg with the whole innocent thing this entire time?!" Dean asked in mild shock having tossed his shirt somewhere on the floor.
"Oh, you don't mean that, we're having fun," he smiled. "Take heed, love, we need all the help we can get. And, yes, that is
When he came back out, Dean made no move to show that he knew someone was in the room with him until Castiel gently grabbed his hand.
"Because," began Castiel as he put his had behind Dean's head, "I've never heard that word said in that particular drawl of yours; it is sending my libido reeling. And one more thing, if I may."
"I've been chasing that blade for decades," Crowley interjected. "The closest I got to it was when one of my droogs-Smitty-got wind of a protege demon of Abaddon's who claimed knowledge of the blade. Sadly," he added, "before Smitty could nab the guy, a hunter by the name of John Winchester nabbed the protege. I was wondering if there is anything in the John Winchester Memorial Library that might lead us to the first blade-to killing Abaddon."
"What, darker than you?" Dean had to turn to the Demon for real now. What could possibly make the King of Hell nervous?
“The fuck is so funny, Sam?” Dean growled. He should have known better than to expect his brother to stop laughing immediately to answer. After another minute of Sam’s carefree, smile inducing laugh, he finally stopped and wiped the tears from his eyes.
When Castiel came to a few hours later, it was to a growling stomach. He meandered into the kitchen to grab something to eat when he was confronted by Sam and Kevin.
Castiel roughly grabbed Dean's hair to whisper in his ear, "I want you to open yourself up like a good little girl, and ride Daddy like you mean it."
“Yes. I…I have done some awful things,” the man answers in a tone that would cause any heart to break.
In fact, the Angel honestly can't remember a time when he wasn't in love with Dean...even before the Hunter in front of him was born. As a fledgling, he would ask his Father when his charge was going to be born. This would earn him a fond chuckle and a pat to the head. "Do not fret, Castiel, he will be here before you know it," his Father would answer. The Angel could only pout with petulance.
"Cas," he croaked. "I said I wanted to be alone." Dean angrily yanked his hand from Castiel's grip when he didn't say anything. "Did you fucking hear me?!"
"F-fuck, Cas, we gotta do that some time." The visual that Castiel painted had gone straight to his cock. He palmed himself through his jeans for some relief.
After bringing each other to climax, they quickly finished showering and were dressed just in time to hear Sam walking back through the door. After the brothers finished eating, the eldest Winchester decided to watch a movie before going to bed. He finally settled on Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom after flipping through most of the channels twice.
“Because what do most people with daddy issues do, man?” When Sam was met with silence, he rolled his eyes knowing his brother knew exactly what he meant. “And I don’t know if you've considered this, but…Cas is probably the oldest person on earth. Daddy kink to the max, dude.” Sam was greeted with charged silence that made him smirk. Castiel was going to be so confused and he was going to have to watch his brother try to explain this away.
"You sound very angry, Sam," observed the Angel. "I'm not angry, I just feel like I'm suffocating. I literally cannot breathe because his depression is so far gone. Kevin left so that he can get fresh air a week ago and packed enough to be gone for a month. Dean isn't letting me out of his sight so I don't have that option. Please, Cas? Do this for all of us?" Sam knows he sounds desperate and selfish but he really is doing this for his big brother.
Stepping into the warm shower made Dean shiver with anticipation. His heartbeat was becoming more and more erratic as Castiel stepped closer to him. Just before meeting for a kiss, Castiel stepped back and looked the other man in the eye.
"Touch yourself, Dean," commanded the Angel in a gruff voice. The Hunter hardly moved his hand over his shaft before he was coming harder than he'd ever had. As his orgasm ripped through him, he clenched down on Castiel causing him to choke out a groan before spilling his seed deep within his lover. Castiel slowly pulled out as they came down from their highs and plopped down next to Dean.
"Nah, it's alright, Cas. You just keep enjoying your cross country travels," answered Dean a little bitterly.
"Castiel. My name is Castiel. It is a pleasure to finally meet you, Dean, I have heard much about you from your brother. I must say, you are not what I pictured."
"Cas!" Dean spoke with a tremble of desperation. "Baby, please, I need you to fuck me harder, I'm so close."
Half an hour later, he was holding a ticket for Lebanon with an ETA for around 2pm in the afternoon and he sent the information to Dean via text with the warning that it was subject to change. Looking at his watch again, he saw that he had about 2 hours before the bus left and set an alarm on his phone for an hour and half later before nodding off on his bench in the station.
Castiel didn't answer at first because the question was so random. Of course there are the obvious things that he misses like being to flit around quickly, having superhuman strength, and having the ability to heal. After another moment's consideration he answers, "My wings. I miss flying in general, but I genuinely miss my wings."
"Be a good boy for me, Dean, and come." With that, Dean felt a coil within him burst and untouched for the first time in his life, he came on command. "Oh, fuck, Dean, you look so beautiful like this," Castiel grunted. He continued to fuck Dean through his tremors when his own orgasm caught him off guard. Each pulse helped along by the Dean's inner muscles continuing to pulse around his cock rapidly. He snapped to undo Dean's restraints and the hunter immediately brought his hands up to caress everywhere he could reach.
that, Zeke! The only reason you're in my brother right now," Dean yells as he points a finger in warning, "is that that
Seeing Castiel lose himself so wantonly made Dean go over the edge into his own release. After coming down from their highs, Dean pulled out of his lover and laid next to him gasping for breath.
He can still recall the countless hours he spent learning to be the best Angel he could be, and he's not sure when the transition happened, but he's sure it was not too long after that conversation that his Grace would flutter with the thought of Dean Winchester. As millennia after millennia passed, he would turn his head eagerly to the Earth at the mention of any name similar to that of his charge only to be disappointed every time it was a false alarm. He had almost given up hope until the day he received the sign of the impending arrival of his charge.
"Oh, no," he spoke as the two men watched a figure walk from behind the house. "We need to leave here now," the Demon hissed in undertone.
"That sounds great, Cas," replied Dean, "Maybe I could go with you next time and you can show me around."
Dean had not been anticipating getting punched the moment he walked away from Castiel, but now that he had been, he was pissed. Just as he's getting ready to reciprocate the hit, he sees the frightened look on Charlie and Kevin's faces. He doesn't give himself time to think about where Charlie even came from when he just turns to his bedroom to grab his things and leave.
"Oh, yeah. Here it is. Yeah, he picked up a protege who had bones with Abaddon, but that's about all it says," grumbled Dean. He failed to close the book before Crowley could steal a glance at the pages.
Dean glared at the Demon in front of him for a moment before conceding. "Cas said he was gonna be here hours ago, but he never called. I'm just worried." As if on cue, Warrant's "Cherry Pie", Castiel's ringtone, started blaring from the phone in Dean's pocket causing him to blush and Crowley to chuckle.
"Oh, don't you worry, sweetheart. Daddy won't disappoint," said Dean as he hoisted Castiel onto his desk and started kissing and divesting the clothes off the celestial body in front of him. He was left in only his pants when Castiel spoke again.
"Horribly." There was no use lying, he didn't sleep well unless Dean was there. Those weekends that he would spend with Dean would be the only time that he would get any kind of consistent sleep.
. Makes me want to throw up," deadpanned Sam. He couldn't keep the small smile from his face, however and Dean knows that Sam is only pulling his leg as is his duty as little bro.
"I know, I'm sorry," the hunter chuckled. He continued his exploration of the writhing being in front of him until Castiel was an utter moaning, breathless mess. Dean had never taken so much time to worship the body of another as he was doing now. There wasn't a centimeter of skin untouched and Castiel's body was flushed to match the many marks Dean had taken the time to make.
The phrase "Oh really", dripping with sarcasm was the only warning Sam got before he was flung to the floor by his brother who crashed on top of him. The hot stew hit the both of them on their chests causing the brothers to hiss in pain briefly. They grappled along on the floor, Sam keeping the spoon from Dean and the older brother trying his hardest to reach it. After wrestling around for a moment, the Winchesters rolled apart from each other gasping for breath before making eye contact and falling into a fit of laughter.
Castiel, on the other hand, tries his best to keep from smiling. He is purposely trying to get on Dean's nerves for selfish reasons. It is definitely giving him a gratifying feeling that it's working, and he plans on having Dean eating from the palm of his hand by the end of the evening. A month away from a lover is never easy and while he can understand Dean's want for human tradition, he wishes that the hunter had waited until after they fornicated. Now that he has partaken of the forbidden fruit, he seeks to indulge himself. Often. Gluttony may be a sin, but what weight does Hell hold on a being that has lived for countless millennia as a harbinger of Celestial Justice?
The Hunter wakes with a gasp and stares at the man next to him. Early morning light is just now coming through the windows so he figures he's had several hours of sleep. He looks at his trembling hands and runs them through his hair. He didn't forget the dream this time. He doesn't realize he's hyperventilating until Castiel stirs.
"No. No, Cas, you didn't say anything wrong. I just-that's beautiful," replied Charlie, wiping at her eye. Silly, girly feelings. She's a sap for a good love story and she knows it.
Dean nodded and bit his lip to keep from retorting. He'd been bad by acting the way he had and Castiel had every right to hit him in response. He could be good for his angel. He
"Dean...it's been s-I'm not going to last," breathed out Castiel as his movements became more erratic.
Dean had taken a few weeks off from bounty hunting with his Uncle Bobby and his best friend Rufus to visit his brother in one of the big cities on the coast because it's been way too long since they've seen each other and it just felt unnatural to not have interacted with him in so long. They couldn't even communicate via letters since Dean and Co. didn't really have a permanent address to which Sam could write. So now Dean is is making his way discreetly into Boston on his black, fiery mare of a thing named "Baby". He knows it ain't all that manly but...she's his baby, plain and simple.
"I am speaking of the fact that I have resigned myself to a lot of things in the time I've known you," Castiel answered, pacing about the kitchen to help with the sheer anger boiling through him. "If you needed me to be a soldier for your cause, I did so. If you needed me to help you carry a burden, I became your strength. If all you needed was an empty hole to fuck into, I was that, too. I was even willing to take your love in the form of hatred, or as the dirt beneath your shoe because
"I have to agree," Castiel panted. Both men winced as he pulled out. The shorter man looked down at his softening cock and was struck with an idea as he stared at the cum gathered on it. With a wicked smile he clambered over Dean's body until his cock was hanging right above swollen lips. "Clean it, slut."
The Angel can still recall those years that it took for him to reach Dean in that dark abyss 45 years ago (in Hell/Earth years.) He and his garrison were dispatched from Heaven the moment that Dean's soul was dragged to Hell by the hound that tore him apart. They laid siege to the gates of Hell for nearly a month before they finally broke through. The chaos that ensued was almost unspeakable. The further and further they trudged into the void, the larger the legions of Hell seemed to get. Each more ferocious than the last and Castiel was beginning to worry that his brothers and sisters would fail before rescuing the Righteous Man. He was also afraid that it would break him. His sole purpose, his reason for existence, was to rescue the Righteous Man, and if he couldn't do that then he would at least make it easier for the next garrison to do his job. He would go down with a fight.
The Angel spends what feels like an hour in Dean's shower before he stepped out into the room naked. He hears a surprised gasp just as he turns the corner. When he looks up, he sees the man he has been trying so hard not to think about, but had obviously failed in doing so. He can feel a blush of anger and embarrassment and arousal beginning to paint itself across his skin, luckily, Dean hadn't turned the light on when he'd walked in, so the only light present was the one shining from the bathroom behind Castiel. Slowly, his eyes take in the man before him...he barely registers that there is something different about him.
In a way this answer was both good and bad. On the one hand, he can see his mistake. He hadn't considered Sam when he made that decision. On the other hand, he may have lost his brother. He turns around and encloses himself in his room once more. He is surprised when he hears the door to his bedroom open, and Castiel walks in.
"About thirteen hours, give or take. It's in a tiny town called Alta. The attacks are all happening around the only motel in town. Your best bet is start there."
Next thing he knew, the Angel was being tossed onto the bed. He watched as Dean stripped off his clothing and grabbed lube from the bedside table. Castiel felt goosebumps raise on his skin as Dean crawled over him, but when he leaned in for a kiss, the other man avoided his lips. This confused the Angel more than anything else.
"I-I didn't know I wasn't supposed to! I just didn't want to have to repeat anything. Sorry," Kevin replied sheepishly.
The Angel turned to face Dean so quick the hunter was afraid he was going to snap his neck. "You are? That doesn't make sense. You are nothing if not confident."
me," moaned Dean as he scrambled to comply with the order. Dean had thought he was turned on before but damn if the Angel didn't have him halfway to completion already.
It has been four years since Castiel has joined him in the pit, and Dean is ecstatic as he readies his tools for the day.
"I'll think about it. Dinner will be ready in 15," replied Dean with a tone of finality. Sam grunted in response and left to his room once again until dinner was ready.
“Home, sweet home, boys!” Dean exclaims as he throws open the door to the room. The second the light turns on, the men wince at the design and colors strewn about the room that the boys had yet to adjust themselves to over the past few days. It looked as if it hadn’t been upgraded (or cleaned) since 1976.
When the blue eyed man finally went to caress the crotch of his lover, Dean promptly grabbed his hand and turned to him with a stern look on his face. "Quit being a cock-tease,
Dean stepped into the room in front of him after dispatching those in his way. The sight in front of him made his heart lurch. Castiel was on his knees with a hand in his hair holding his head back, an angel blade against his throat.
The little Angel's eyes widened in realization. "I'll go study right now, Father! I have to be ready for when Dean comes!" That was probably the last time that Castiel saw his Father, but the memory still brings a certain warmth to his heart.
Castiel quietly left the room when the Hunter reached his release. Now, Dean was stuck with his thoughts.
"Are you kidding me? I've been wanting to meet you for a long time, Castiel! And the only impression I have of you is of an impassioned guy that cares a lot about an idiot that doesn't know any better," smiled Charlie. "Which was the same impression I was getting from the books, so if anything, you've only solidified what I admire about you," she blushed.
Sam nods and he purses his lips as if to keep from saying something. He looks at the floor for a moment before looking up and telling his brother to have a safe drive and to remember to take The Pill since Castiel doesn't know that an Angel Blade won't keep them from getting pregnant. The brothers part with smiles on their faces that droop a little once Dean sits down in Baby.
“Oh," he gasped in surprise. Well, that won't do. "I’m sorry, Daddy,” Dean whispered. The shiver did not go unnoticed by Castiel.
Sam, Dean, and Castiel were in the middle of BFE, Montana (Dean’s words.) The trio had caught wind of a rugaru that recently started wreaking havoc in a little town in the middle of the Midwest. After a few days of investigating and actually hunting and finally ganking the rugaru, however, the eldest brother was ready to drink and crash into one of the beds and get his four hours before beginning the trek back home.
Castiel effortlessly walked them over to the nearest bed and transplanted Dean there as gently as possible. The human laid back with his chest heaving in lust, his bottom lip caught in his teeth. He watched as Castiel calmly took his trench coat off. The tie was next. Here, Castiel hesitated as he stared at the blue material in his hands, a blue stare met green with a flash of mischief.
Dean takes a moment to process what is essentially news to him about himself. “Um. Wow. That’s-that’s a sad life to live, Cas. Maybe that’s why I haven’t made a move yet. Maybe you’re too good for me. You’re an angel after all.”
"When I was a foot away from you, you stepped even closer and asked who I was. When I said I was there to rescue you, you pulled me into an embrace. Do you remember what you said?" Dean shook his head. "You said you didn't feel you deserve to be saved because of what you had done and that I should take the person on the rack in front of you. You cried into my shoulder and I could think of nothing to console you except to remind you that you had work to do on the surface, that your brother was lost without you. It was your sense of duty that finally broke through to you and I was enthralled.
Please note that I love parallelism even in my fics so although I used a lot of dialogue from the show in the chapter, I wasn't being lazy. The interaction between Dean and Crowley and Cain in this particular episode was absolutely perfect, and I needed it. I did tweak it to fit a few things in there as well.
Another thing the Angel recalled was that as he continued to carve his way through demons, his wings changed. Their prolonged exposure to Hell Fire had turned them to black. He remembered vaguely wondering if they would stay that way. He had long been chastised by his siblings for his wings' fickle change in color. As a Seraph his wings should have been ivory in color, cupids had wings of pure white, and Archangels were the only angels with unique colors, etc. Now he would surely stand out amongst the ranks, but he couldn't find the energy to be bothered. He was fulfilling the mission for which he had been created and any distinction he accrues is welcomed.
“Guys! You better be dressed when I open this door!” Sam’s muffled voice came menacingly through the door. The knob jiggling indicating that he was going to walk through in just a second.
"Is it Sam? How may I be of assistance?" Castiel asks as he tries to sit up only to find Dean's hand on his chest stopping him. "Dean wha-" He is cut off from asking his question by a pair of tentative lips on his own. Before he loses himself in the sensation, he pushes Dean back with a confused glint in his eye and a tilt to his head. "What're you doing, Dean?" This is more than he could have hoped for, but he can't help but question the motives behind Dean's actions. He doesn't want to explore a new side to their relationship one time and then be forced to forget about it.
"What? No! Of course not!" Sam is well aware that he isn't convincing anyone with that act, but he could try.
When she stepped into the empty hallway, she took a minute to take a deep breath and quickly analyze everything that she's learned. She had been so excited to see Kevin in Oz because as fun as it had been, she was missing home. Ironic as that may be. Charlie was really excited to know that she was going to finally be able to meet Castiel in person! She'd read enough of the books and fan fiction to be a little intimidated by him, but she was eager to meet the man that stole her metaphorical brother's heart. Looking back at the past half hour, though, hasn't changed her mind about him. This is still the Castiel she read about, and the Castiel that Dean is still in love with despite the little (ok big) domestic mishap they just had. Charlie resolves herself to play peacekeeper and she reached into her pocket to type out a message:
“You goddamn bastard. You were just playin’ dumb, weren’t you?” Dean stuttered. He suddenly felt so exposed. He tried to cover himself with his hands in his embarrassment.
"I get what you mean, long distance relationships always have a strain to them. It's what I'm calling for actually."
he thinks to himself. He sets the little guy down and gets up from the ground and immediately tries to find a way back to his brother…um…Sam. Yeah, Sam.
Dean abruptly pulled his hand back to stand. The shorter man could only sigh and resign himself to his current fate. Dean was not likely to let off this treatment for a while. The other man walked out the door without a glance back at Castiel nor a thank you. The Angel went to replace the first aid kit in the bathroom before meeting everyone in the dungeon once more.
A few hours and a shower later, Dean and Castiel were packing their things with somber expressions on their faces. The sound of the last zipper closing left a heavy silence behind. Dean hadn't noticed his eyes were closed until Castiel spoke.
Castiel could only shake his head. Sam doesn't know the whole story. If he did, maybe he would abandon the Angel as well. Maybe he deserved it. Perhaps his relationship had been doomed from the start. He shouldn't have allowed himself to get in so deep. Were they even still together? Is it a mutual understanding that arguments acted as a break up? Castiel couldn't keep his thoughts from their darker route, and the next thing he knew was that he could no longer control his breathing.
"Yes, of course. He is one of my more eager students. You needn't worry about his performance," answered Castiel as he took an almost imperceptible step closer to Dean.
"Because you have hardly spoken a word in the hour since I definitively confessed my feelings to you after you regained your memories. If you're trying to think of way to let me down gently, I'd rather leave." For Castiel to speak so curtly, he knew the angel was angry and on edge. Dean would have to navigate carefully if he is going to get anywhere tonight.
Sadly, this is a very short chapter. I have two more to upload before I'm caught up where I am on ff.net (I am Chrisinele-hime there) When I update there, you guys will get an update here either the same day, or the following day.
"Oh it's too late for that, Dean. We've got your lover here spilling blood all over the place. We would have preferred that he spill words, such as your whereabouts, but we can't get him to open up that pretty little mouth of his that we're sure he opens up nicely for you," mocked the voice.
"Sam, that's enough! We're not going to talk about this. Cas is leaving because he wants to and that's that!" Sam is taken aback by the ferocity of Dean's words. He's aware that he may have crossed a line but these guys have been avoiding the inevitable for too long.
. But I don't know if I can forgive you for what are about to become. Even for the sake of the you that took me five years to fix."
Sam shot his brother a shocked look but before he could say anything, he saw Castiel's demeanor change...he thinks it's about time he showed himself out. He's got a week before the essay is due anyway. He slowly backs away and takes Baby with him to the local bar to try to clear his mind. The other two men had already forgotten Sam's presence.
The sound of the slap hit Dean's ear before he realized he had just been spanked by Castiel. "No words, Dean. You are, however, still allowed to make noises."
Sam smiled briefly at the statement before remembering his original intent in seeking out his brother. "So, I was digging around on the web earlier and I noticed some anomalies in Utah," he stated as he stood up and turned to help his brother from the floor.
Dean's jaw dropped in shock before he giggled (Or not, if he's telling the story to Sam.) "You've been working on your flirting skills, handsome?" asked Dean as he stepped close enough to Castiel to grab him by the waist.
Castiel smirked before taking Dean's member into his hand and giving a few lazy tugs before kneeling before him. He gave a quick glance to Dean and smirked again at the debauched look on the cowboy's face before slowly taking Dean into his mouth.
"Well, sounds like you boys have a lot to talk about that doesn't involve me!" Rowena exclaimed sweetly before snapping her fingers and disappearing. They rolled their eyes in amusement. She probably brought up all those things just so she could find a way to leave before they offed her too.
Without pause Castiel answers, “Everything.” The silence that follows weighs heavily. Electricity in the air is nearly tangible. They both shift closer, breathing each other’s air. Blue and green challenging one another to take the final plunge.
"Did you sleep well, Cas?" inquired Sam. He knew Dean was home, and he can only imagine what the two men did last night.
"Alright, I'm sorry, Charlie," chuckled Sam. "Come on, Kev, I'm gonna need some help carrying all of this stuff."
"You are aware that I was unconscious and under duress for much of the last 36 hours, correct? Everything was hard to understand under that cloud of starvation and torture." Castiel growled. He knows how touchy the Hunter gets when something is wrong with Sam, but it can be down right annoying...at all times, really. "But Dean you need to listen to me. You have no idea just how bad this is for Sam. Gadreel is the one that caused the fall of man from the Garden."
Dean had driven straight through the entire day, only stopping for bathroom and food breaks. After napping in his car for a few hours, he was now standing outside of the room of the suspected werewolf, favorite gun in his back pocket loaded with silver bullets. It was nearing midnight and the light was still on in the room. Making sure that he had a silver coin in his hand, he knocked on the door. He ran through his cover story one last time before the door opened to reveal the last person he was expecting to see.
Castiel gradually slowed the thrust of his hips until he finally came to a stop. With a grimace, he pulled out and watched his come begin to leak from the abused hole, and without thinking, he leaned forward and swiped his tongue to gather it.
The angel wrapped slender fingers around his lover’s quickly hardening dick, the water smoothed the glide of flesh on flesh. Dean groaned appreciatively and mirrored the other man’s actions. "Me neither."
"You were dying, Sam. He told your brother that he was Ezekiel, and by the time I met up with you guys, I no longer had Grace and therefore couldn't differentiate him from any other Angel. I know that this doesn't justify your brother's actions, but he thought he was doing the right thing," Castiel consoled.
"With pleasure," Castiel purred. He brings their lips together hungrily and tears at their clothes until there is nothing left between them. He pulls back from the kiss when he is out of breath but keeps their faces close enough so that they are breathing each other's air. The Angel rakes his blunt fingernails down his Hunter's chest until he is gripping Dean's member. He watches as the Winchester's pupils dilate further and he worries his lip with his teeth to hold back a moan. Castiel keeps a firm grip on the seat behind Dean's head as he positions himself over the erection in his hand. Just before seating himself, Dean grabs him by the waist and hoists him up a few inches.
"Want me where, Castiel?" Dean asked as continued to push the other man's knees closer to his chest.
Dean finally stops at a motel for the night, a good 10 hours later. The drive had taken it's toll on him, and he thinks about going out for a few drinks but decides against it. Now that doesn't have driving to distract him, all he can do is think back on earlier that morning. As he lays there on the lumpy bed, he brings his forearm up to the light of the bedside lamp. He constricts his hand into a fist and clenches his jaw. After 10 hours he can say that yeah, ok, maybe Castiel had been right and he allowed himself to be manipulated, but what choice did he have?
An hour later and the group are parked outside of the house when Sam turns to address everyone else. “Ok, guys, remember that these witches lost their brother and they are pissed. Who knows what they’re doing right now. Cas, you’re on your own and Rowena you’re with me.”
Without so much as a glance towards his lover’s sibling, Castiel brought himself to loom over Dean and stated in a voice that brooked no argument, “Get another room, Sam. Do not dawdle.” The two men continued staring at each other as they heard Sam scrambling to grab his things without a complaint. The second that the door slammed, Dean was placing a hand behind the angel’s head to bring him in for a searing kiss.
"As you wish." Castiel could do nothing but do as his lover wants when they were both so close. The seraph pushed Dean's knees to his chest and fucked him.
"Dean, I-" Castiel starts. He stopped mid sentence because Dean's grip on the wheel tightened once more and he shook his head while sighing. "But-"
"Whatever, Sammy, I can't help it. I get to see my man in a few days," said Dean with a devilish smirk on his face. It seemed to light him up from the inside out, but there was an immediate panicked look that flashed across Dean's face that made the younger Winchester confused.
Castiel pauses for a moment and continues looking out of the window next to him before he proceeds to answer. "It is not of import. I was merely reminiscing past interactions with some of my brothers and sisters," he lies. If he were to speak about the things he had been thinking about just now there was no telling how that will go, and he just wants to spend what little time he has with his lover in peace.
"I said, it's alright, Cas!" Dean yelled. He didn't mean to yell, but he was frustrated. Why was the Angel not even trying to come see him? Why does he have to ask? He should just know.
After Dean and Crowley left to follow the lead from Tara, they found themselves outside of a quaint little abode. Tara, they discovered, had been another Hunter that had helped John with the Abaddon's underling. After scolding Dean for working with Crowley, she revealed that she had spent years of her life chasing after the blade, but was deterred when she couldn't find an ingredient that Crowley just so happened to have. If Dean's "it's a trap" bells, weren't ringing before, they're most definitely starting to now.
“But I don’t understand,” countered Castiel with as much innocence and insistence as he could muster.
Dean curses to himself. He had waited to come to the bunker really late so that he could avoid seeing his brother and Castiel. Looks like he failed miserably at that.
"I cannot tell you, Dean." The Angel can feel an irrational amount of anger coursing through his veins. He wants to tell Dean everything, but if Dean is to keep his sanity, he needs to experience that memory for himself. Castiel wishes that that moment of weakness all those years ago could have been the one time he could have held steadfast to his own desires. They would not be in this predicament if Castiel hadn't coddled Dean.
Dean was now holding Castiel's hips so hard he was sure they would bruise. "Shit, darlin', what'd you do?"
Castiel knew the exact moment that Dean was no longer worried about what he was going to do because he turned into a lax vegetable next to him. He needed only to wait for the opportune moment. Towards the end of the movie came the love scene which the shorter man decided to take advantage of. He slowly turned towards the Hunter and brought a hand to the inside of his thigh and began rubbing circles there while discreetly bringing his hand closer and closer to its prize. He pressed his lips to Dean's neck and smiled at the sigh he received and the subtle movement of the other man's neck to allow better access.
"No. No, you are going to learn for yourself," said Castiel as he petulantly crossed his arms over his chest.
"It's alright, Dean, I understand. I will come close enough for you to visit soon, I promise," answered Castiel soothingly.
"Well, enough. Let us take you some place more...private. We have much to discuss," sneered the man in front of him.
"Well you were talking and then you stopped...oh! I'm sorry! I didn't introduce you to my brother. Dean get over here!" Dean clutched at his rapidly beating heart for a brief second as he tentatively made his way towards his brother. When he finally reached them, Sam put his arm around his shoulder. "Professor Novak, this my brother, Dean. Dean, this is my History professor."
"Yes, we will be getting to that momentarily, but first..." smirked Castiel. He maneuvered himself behind the Hunter and laid a kiss to each cheek before spreading them. "Oh, Dean. You look so beautiful," he gasped running a teasing finger around the rim of the Hunter.
"Dean, we are both free of STDs, I regularly give you a checkup, and I would rather feel you uninhibited."
"Hm, debatable. You just have the patience and control of a saint," countered Dean. "Not that there was anything holy about what we did," he smirked.
Castiel only smirked in response as he proceeded to rub Dean's member through his boxers. The hunter rushed to bring the tablecloth back down and brought his hand to his mouth to stifle the moan that ripped through him. It was at this moment that the waitress chose to come with their drinks.
Dean rests his forehead on Castiel’s  shoulder and takes a calming breath. His heart feels as if it is going to punch through his chest. Also, weren't those two just in the room with them?
The look on Sam's face and the news he just received caused Castiel to heave a great sigh. These boys never mess up by halves.
The following few days seemed to fly by in a blur and found Dean making sure he had everything he needed for his stay at Kansas City. He nearly jumped out of his skin when he turned around to find a slightly disheveled Kevin standing behind him.
"Dean! Oh my God! I've missed you so freaking much!" said Sam as he made his way towards his older brother and hugged him tightly.
"Tch. Yeah. Well, I remember everything. Including my talk with Death. I was ready to die, Cas. In that church and again in that hospital. I was going to do it so that we could put a stop to this shit. But that-that rat bastard selfishly took that away from me. It was MY choice, Cas. MY choice to make. That son of a bitch out there just can't stand the thought of being alone, and has to drag me back into the mix of things when I'm just tired. So fucking tired," Sam exclaimed.
The Angel glared at his lover's closed door as he walked by and stepped into Sam's room. He could hear the shower going and decided to wait on the chair near the bed until Sam came out.
"-asshole of a brother did this, but why did you keep this from me? I thought we were friends, Castiel!"
"No. Because in doing so, he has condemned his soul to demonization," the Angel explains. There is a moment of silence before the news sinks in.
The eldest Winchester makes his way into the room where Castiel is contentedly eating his burrito. He can see those blue eyes light up when he says they have to talk. His heart breaks when he sees those azure eyes staring back at him in fear and confusion after being asked to leave.
Dean made his way into the school that he had dropped off his brother several months ago and realized...he had no idea where the kid would be! Before he started to panic, he rationalized that the best place to start would be the library. After asking for directions, Dean made his way to the large building in the middle of the campus. He earned many (appreciated) looks from a plethora of the men and women bustling around. Dean had always prided himself in his looks; there wasn't anyone that his smirk and excessive charm didn't work on. It definitely helped when they were on the hunt. Smiling widely (from his ego boost) Dean made his way into the library and walked up to the librarian in charge; an older blond woman with an angry frown on her face. He leaned up to the desk where the woman was seated and pulled his best smile for her and waited for her to give him her attention. When she did, her face went from mild annoyance to awestruck.
Dean. That was the Dean that had to do what was necessary to survive: a nerve laid bare. The Angel can still recall the pleas of the man before him after he rescued him from Hell. Those words still do nothing but send a stab of pain through his borrowed heart.
Castiel teased his tongue on the area behind Dean's balls before taking them each in turn into his mouth. "Cas," Dean panted pathetically. He was unconsciously working the angel's fingers in and out of his hole in desperation. "Ba-baby, please," he pleaded.
“Ok, ok, Dean. Remember I told you our best friend is an angel?” Sam wheezed still trying to catch his breath.
After a few more slaps to the ass in front of him, Castiel brought the panties down to right beneath Dean's cheeks. He had decided that Dean didn't deserve a barrier to take part of the shock. The first slap on bare skin made Dean cry out even louder. "Fuck, Daddy, that feels so good! Please don't stop," Dean sobbed. Several slaps of varying strength landed in different locations after the hunter's pleading. The one that made him cry out the hardest was the one that landed right on his hole.
"FUCK!" Dean cried out in frustration. The angel could see that Dean was delirious with pleasure as he was nearly babbling, his body arching and writhing in a way that told Castiel it was not consciously done.
"Now, what kind of gentleman would I be to make such a pretty young thing such as yourself show a big ol' brute like me around? I don't wanna waste your precious time," he answered in a flirtatious whisper.
"Let's get dressed, beloved, I do not wish to stay sticky and dirty in the backseat of your car for much longer."
Castiel nods before speaking. "I knew his name and what my service for him would be before I even heard my own name. Father made sure that I would become the Angel Dean would need, and when you're given something like that, how do you not fall in love with the object of your study? He is the only thing that I know better than anything else."
"Ah-that's a funny story, really," Crowley nervously chuckled from next to Dean. "Bit of a misunderstanding. Really, we should-"
. We can observe human tradition after a romp in the sheets. A month with only my hands for company is taxing. Now, you and I are going to walk out of this theater, you will drive us to a secluded area, and we are going to fulfill a fantasy I have had for years," explained Castiel through gritted teeth. He hardly waited for Dean's response before roughly grasping the Hunter's hand and leading him away.
Dean's heart throbbed as he heard the way his brother spoke about him. Of course Sam has every right to feel this way, but that didn't mean it didn't hurt like a mother fucker hearing it anyway.
"Well, it was worth a try. I just wanted to see a smile on my brother's face again. The last time I saw him smile with his whole heart behind it was when you were here-"
"I've been trying to speak to you for the past minute, squirrel. What has you in a tizzy? Besides Moose's current status, of course."
"To be quite frank with you, beloved, I feel we have taken things quite slow enough." And boy, was he not lying. They're creeping up on a decade of knowing each other. "In fact," he continued, "if we take things any slower, I'm not sure either of our cocks will be able to function anymore without any supplements."
The shorter man greedily thrust his tongue into Dean's channel, earning another moan. He continued this barrage for a few moments, and after swirling the trembling hole one last time, Castiel pulled back and smiled at the needy noises coming from his lover. Hastily, he made a grab for the lube that he had set on the bedside table in anticipation for today. After pouring and warming lube on his fingers, he slapped at the ass still being laid bare before him. He gently circled Dean before tentatively slipping the tip of his finger inside. He heard Dean breathe in and felt him tense up.
"No, hear me out. I wouldn't because I love him. I love him enough to let him go. I know he's tired of this fight, too, but it's all he knows. He thinks it's all he can be. So if I were in Dean's shoes, I would have let him die so that he could finally find the peace he deserves. But he took that choice away from me, Cas, and I don't know if I can forgive him."
Castiel’s blue eyes turn wide with fear as he tentatively moves back until his back hits the wall. Dean gets a flash of a memory of the man before him during another instance with the same childlike fear. And someone named Chastity?
"Well, you can consider those an exact representation of my wings. They weren't always so, but I think your subconscious must recall them."
Dean was interrupted before he could respond by the reappearance of their waitress who took their orders after giving them a weird look.
Castiel nodded and brought their lips together. Dean entered the Angel with great care all the while laying kisses everywhere he could reach. Once fully seated, he laid still to allow for both to grow accustomed to being whole in each other.
"Yeah. It's right next to mine. I even put stuff in here from the storage that reminded me of you or I thought might interest you," replied Dean with a nervous cough.
"Fuck, Dean, you look so delectable like that," Castiel whimpered. "Mmm, baby, I'll bet. Let's get this shower over and done with so we can get to the good stuff."
"I...I-uh...I'm not sure how to ask this of you. I'm almost certain your answer will be in the negative so j-just never mind." Dean stopped what he was doing with his mouth on the Angel's neck to look into those deep cerulean eyes...except they were being averted.
Never had Dean felt his dick begin to fill out so quickly in his life. He immediately turned around and presented his flushed face to look at his lover. He was met with a smug look. One that Dean knew all too well.
Just as Dean is making his way out of the bunker, he is confronted by Ezekiel. He knows his brother well enough that Sam never stands at full height like that because he hates coming off as intimidating to those shorter than him (which is practically everyone.)
As Castiel continued his speech, Dean couldn’t help but feel a little ashamed. The other man was right, Dean was always assuming that Castiel was innocent and naïve, and while that is somewhat true, he should give the shorter man the benefit of the doubt. “I’m sorry, Cas.”
"What do those numbers in the margin mean?" the Demon asked pointedly. He is not going to allow the Hunter to hold out on him on such an important case.
"Well, yeah!" blurted Dean. "I couldn't let that numskull pick stuff for your room. He wouldn't know what to put in there," he added defensively.
"You can't search the bottom of the ocean, but I can," answered the Demon. He can tell when someone is avoiding a topic. "So, I'll find it, and bring it to its new owner," he continued. He daintily exited the car, but was stopped from walking off when Dean spoke again.
"Is Dean alright? Is he hurt?" asked Castiel hurriedly. Sam can understand why the Angel would automatically assume something was wrong if it wasn't Dean calling him to tell him the news. It's just how it is: Sam only calls when Dean can't make the call himself.
"How could you love such a monster, huh?" Dean shouted. "You know, I had another dream a few days ago. I kissed you, and then carved into your chest for your heart because I wanted to see your 'love' pulsating in my palm. What kind of freak deserves you after that?!" Dean has to curl his hand into a fist so that the man across from him can't see how hard its trembling.
As Dean was thinking to himself, Sam had already made it to his teacher and now Dean's getting to hear him speak and see his face.
The Angel sighs from his seat in the Impala for what seems the hundredth time since the two lovers had set out on their way back to the bunker. Dean had already called ahead to forewarn the others of their arrival within the hour. The suffocating air was heavy enough that the Angel felt as if he were going to be bent in half from the pressure. Dean hadn't spoken a word except to ask the other man if he needed to stop somewhere to let him know. Castiel couldn't help but feel as if he would pull his hair out. As an Angel he never needed to read Dean's mind because of the five years they had known each other in Hell, and he doesn't need to have the ability now either.
“I’m so not getting into this right now, Cas,” mumbled Dean. He turned up the volume on the TV as if he could use it as an excuse to avoid his angel's curiosity. No such luck.
"Really? Got any more?" asked Dean with his mouth an inch away from his lover's lips. Castiel pondered for a moment before answering, "If having a flaccid penis were Hell, then I will be the one to grip you tight and raise you from Perdition. How does that one sound?"
The men arrive just in time for Castiel to purchase a ticket to Louisiana before the bus parks and starts taking in its passengers. The lovers give each other a desperate kiss.
Sam and Castiel looked at each other in confusion. Neither decided to address the elder brother’s odd behavior out right and instead ignored him. “Dean’s losing his memories because of a curse a witch put on him. We’ve got to fix it before he regresses to the point where he can’t function and dies. To put it simply.”
"Oh good. You picked my favorite answer. I'll be seeing you in a few hours. For your sake, Cas had better be alive."
Dean grabbed the back of Castiel's neck and brought him closer still, the new angle causing Castiel to hit that place deep within him that would be his undoing. "Cas!" he gasped, "Fuck, baby, I'm so close!"
Dean had never moved so quickly in his life. Castiel scrambled out of the way to leave Dean the whole bed. As the younger man positioned himself, the angel moved to the foot of the bed and took in the sight before him. His hunter. His strong, amazing, loving hunter lay before him on display almost vibrating in anticipation. The seraph’s mouth began to water as he focused on the satin-covered ass in front of him. He needed to get his mouth on it, and soon. But first, he had to deliver.
"God, Dean, you feel so good," panted Castiel unconsciously pounding harder into the body beneath him.
Castiel pulled out and watched as Dean's hole clenched on nothing, the fluttering causing his lust to surge once more. "Your hole is so hungry for my cock, Dean." The man in question nodded furiously. The angel lined his member up and pushed in quickly only to pull out again. He could feel the frustration coming off the hunter in waves. He continued to tease Dean like this for several more thrusts. Pushing in just to immediately pull out. There was no thrill that equaled entering his lover and he was going to exploit it until neither of them could stand it anymore.
"Cas, fuck, if you keep doing that, I don't know how long I'm going to last. Let's get in the shower, hm?"
It was Castiel's turn to blush again. He was looking everywhere but at the people in the room. At the sound of a large sigh, the angel looked up to meet green eyes full of mirth and, dare he think it, affection?
"So, I know that I said we won't be doing any work today, but I got to thinking that we really could use some help around here," said Sam while Castiel fished around the cupboard looking for something edible. They'd need to go shopping soon.
There was a pause as Dean steeled himself before speaking, "Listen, Cas, I wanted to apologize for earlier..."
"That sounds extremely promising, Dean. Though I think I would have opted for a Batman mask. You would obviously be wearing a Robin one," he smirked. How fortunate that Metatron had seen fit to download pop culture into his brain so that he could see the red flush that immediately took over freckled cheeks."
Walking up to the motel room that Castiel was waiting in found Dean nervously trying to calm himself. He thought he'd worked this out already in his mind on his way there, but obviously he's still having this crisis. He hopes it isn't obvious to Castiel and he prays that he can get over it. The last thing he wants to do is worry his Angel. He has no doubt that he loves him, but he still can't say where these nerves are coming from. Maybe the distance really was taking its toll? The eldest Winchester can't wait for Ezekiel to finally finish healing himself and Sam so that he can bring Castiel home and be done with this long-distance nonsense. He takes one last calming breath before knocking on the door. He shakily inhales another when he hears the door open and his breath hitches when he sees the nervous blush and smile on the face of his darlin'. He can't keep from smiling as he walks in. You know, maybe he was just nervous after all. He can do this.
