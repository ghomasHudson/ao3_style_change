221B was as he left it that morning: vacant and unkempt. He was never one to bother with company and Mrs Hudson hadn't ventured up to tidy in a few days. It was just as he liked it. Everything in its place and nothing out of the ordinary where his comfort was involved.
In a haze, John realized he seemed crazed and moaning nonsense as he bucked down onto Sherlock's tongue, coming with enough force to rattle the table dangerously. Below him, Sherlock's eyes snapped shut, squeezing closed firmly as his body froze up, wracked with spasms.
Sherlock could hear them bickering before they'd even stepped through the door, the woman's voice pitched high and stentorian. "Oh, shut it, you! We wouldn't be here if you could control yourself," the woman huffed, banging through the door without so much as a by-your-leave. "If you're going to be so maudlin about it, I should just let you suffer on your own."
John watched him, willing his body to calm. The words had sent a jolt of arousal straight to his already tortured erection, still trapped in the suffocating confines of his trousers and pants. “God, you have a dirty mouth.”
Of course, Holmes caught his reaction and smiled, pleased. He motioned to the bench opposite himself. "Sit," he ordered, not unkindly.
"Sherlock," John began hesitantly, and Sherlock's scowl only grew darker. "I didn't know you were coming."
"Alright, Sherlock, but... you should use it anyway, you know, get out of here for a bit. You've been cooped up since..."
“You are,” Sherlock insisted. His hand came up to cup the side of John’s neck in a large palm, forcing John to tilt his jaw up as his thumb pressed lightly over John’s carotid artery. “I can see your pulse racing from where I’m standing."
“Thank you, Miss Vicky, for your concern. Now, get out. I’m tired,” John sighed, holding the door open for her.
Skin almost as pale as cocaine and just as sweet on the palate. John was more than a marvel, more than a wonder, and unequivocally stronger than any addiction Sherlock ever suffered.
Ice spread throughout his belly at his own rebuke, but Sherlock kept a firmly, bland expression and gathered up the containers. “Get dressed,” he ordered without sparing John a glance, avoiding the hurt he knew he would see in John’s eyes. It would be all too easy to walk over and kiss the frown from his lips, but Sherlock had already shown the cracks in his façade. He’d held John not fifteen minutes before and struggled with himself not to lay them both down and wrap himself around him. He’d already shown his hand, and that was more than enough to be getting on with.
How had he not guessed that Sherlock's secret kink would involve whips and chains, and every illicit thing John could think of. The man was a complete control freak, so why wouldn't he want to dominate in bed, as well?
"Aaaaand being shot at a few times, how could I possibly forget," Jasper finished, rolling his eyes playfully. "Maybe you can come with us next time."
Sherlock didn't reply to John's question (plea), instead sweeping past John and picking the tray up with slightly trembling hands and jerky movements, before shoving the whole lot into the drawer of the bedside table, careful to lay it flat on the bottom. “You should go home, John.”
Suddenly, the blindfold was pulled away, and the only thing John could focus on were those electric eyes, spearing him, and that glorious body moving within his own.
The child fussed a little and Sherlock laid down beside him, placing a hand lightly on his back, feeling it move with John's breaths. He hadn't forgotten Lestrade's presence, merely blocked it out in lieu of giving John all of his attention.
Usually, Sherlock would coil the rope over his back and bind his middle to the chair, but his instincts told him that entrapping John completely in such a way would be unwelcome. Instead, he passed the rope under the chair and repeated the same motions with the other arm before running it underneath to where John’s thighs rested against the legs.
Before Molly could reply, Sherlock was pulling the pram out of the room and down the hall, leaving behind his mess and a confused pathologist.
The cab pulled up to an Italian bistro called Angelo’s, and Jasper smirked reassuringly as they walked through the door. They were greeted by a large, exuberant man patting Jasper familiarly on the back, then John, once they were introduced. John's leg was bothering him at that moment, so he was ready to find a seat.
It's been three weeks since Jasper fled 221B, and counting. John didn't quite know what to think of Jasper's disappearance, nor the situation he'd found himself entangled in. The only thing he wanted was to go out into the night and search for his best friend, but if he was anything like his father, Jasper wouldn't be found.
There was a vibration against his stomach, an intermittent hum against his shirt, the same one from the night before.
Irene snorted in a very unladylike fashion and nudged him with her foot, before tucking it back to its previous position. “I don’t care. Besides, you’re currently sitting on my couch as John Watson, wearing an ugly jumper and khaki trousers, which I’d forbade you from doing the day I met you. So. No excuses.”
He’d chosen dark navy, something that wouldn’t wash him out on what was looking to be dreary day. “Ah, thank you, John.” Finally, he allowed himself a peek and wished he hadn’t.
"Hey," Jasper nudged him with a foot, "you alright, mate?" His green eyes peered at John in concern under floppy curls, using his index finger to push his glasses up the bridge of his nose. John hadn't even noticed when he'd put them back on, sure that his friend was smart enough to take them off before engaging in a pillow fight.
Sherlock sat up abruptly at that, before leaning back in his chair, one leg crossing over the other imperiously, hands steepled before his lips. "Let's not mince words for the sake of our 'guest', Lestrade," the leader bit out with a malicious gleam. "You know as well as I that hunters are highly competent trackers.  It's just as well that they would stay in communication with their home base should they perish, thus the reason they are not kept on tighter leashes while pursuing our kind."
John walked unsteadily to his vanity and wilted onto the bench. Irene was right. He looked dreadful, and for some reason, that excited Sherlock. John’s reflection appeared wrecked and mussed, and he would even go so far as to say skanky. He reached for a wet towelette and carefully wiped away the smudged make-up, until he began to resemble something human again.
"You're a bit intimidating," John murmured, afraid that if he spoke any louder, the moment would be broken.
Unfortunately, the weekend, it seemed would continue that way. By the next day, John still had not heard word from Sherlock, or any indication that the night they shared would eventually be acknowledged.
“John, you berk, where’ve you gone,” Sarah complained affectionately as they embraced, before moving to their respective seats across from one another. Sarah was always beautiful, but this time she seemed a bit haggard, though John would never dare say so aloud. Her eyes were dark and searching as she stared back, and the space beneath her eyes was a shade darker than the rest of her skin. “Mike said you haven't been round much.”
"Harry Watson," she introduced herself, thrusting a hand out between them. Sherlock flicked his eyes down to the hand, and back to her face dismissively. Sherlock didn't feel inclined to indulge in niceties. He only wished to speed past the greeting and get straight to
John nodded, swallowing against a tide of uncertainty and suspense as svelte hands trailed tingles over his ribs and below. At his thighs, the fingers skirted around until they pressed against the back of his knees, urging them up into suspension. The second coil of rope circled his thigh, spiraling down until they were knotted at his knees and tied to some part of the bed post. The same motions were repeated with the other, until he lay vulnerable and exposed, legs in the air, and every hidden crevice of his body open for perusal.
Above him, Sherlock was chanting his name beneath his breath. Every whisper of his name brought a sense of rightness and reassurance that it was him that Sherlock was thinking of between his legs. The thought renewed his passion, and John surged up, smirking as Sherlock spread his long legs wider and thrust his hips toward John’s waiting mouth. John devoured him, leaving Sherlock sputtering above him as he sucked his cock with abandon, enjoying the wet squelch his lips made when they met his wet hand at the base of Sherlock erection.
When Sherlock was finished, he stopped, peering around one last time, a quick, one-footed spin, and he was turning to John with bright eyes. “We need food,” he said, and rushed past John, out of the room.
He searched through several empty cabinets until he finally found the tea. "Got it," he called back.
John got up then, too, pulling the sheet around his waist in an attempt at modesty. It was too late for that, John figured, but if he was going to have a row with Sherlock, he would so so with his dignity intact, at least. “Sherlock, I never said that.”
John cleared his throat and three sets of eyes snapped to him, each with varying levels of desperation. Though Julia hardly knew the strange man, there was something familiar about the way he couldn’t tear his eyes away from John. Like he was afraid that John would disappear if he looked away for too long. His gaze lingered in random places, seeing things in her son that Julia couldn’t begin to comprehend. He’d been left behind, too.
"Back in a moment," Sherlock told him, running a hand through his curls as he stepped out into the hall. John could hear the door to the loo open, and shortly after, the sound of running water.
John knew whom she referred to, thought about him non-stop. There was no escaping the shadow of Sherlock Holmes. “No, I—No.”
As much as he avoided Alfie's regular haunts, John found himself stumbling into trouble where the thug was concerned more often than was healthy. Alfie almost always found a way to make John's night go from bad to suicidal in under five minutes.
Sherlock ran a hand through Jasper's hair, noting the thickness of it, the unruly curls so like his own. Jasper shifted and Sherlock pulled away, his throat tight as he reached over and pulled the jumbled blanket over his son. He lingered for a moment longer, running his thumb over Jasper’s brow, his chest warm and swollen with affection.
So Sherlock went with what he knew and pushed John back until he was lying on top of him, reaching for that seemingly infinite expanse of smooth skin. He was rough, and Sherlock knew that he would be sorry for it later, but just right then, he needed John to know what he couldn't get his mouth to say.
John felt himself being slammed back against the seat, his breath rushing out of him in one harsh exhale. Sherlock was leaning over him, his features twisted and furious as his hands held fast around John's lifted wrists. They were both panting, refusing to back down from one another.
"Yes, urgent. We have an appointment we have to keep, and you are still my personal assistant, are you not?"
John could feel the front of his pants dampen, cold fabric settling against the head of his cock. He licked his lips and waited, eyes flicking between Sherlock's covered groin and that unwavering stare.
Lestrade smiled easily and shoved his hands in his pockets. "You know, rarely has anyone challenged Sherlock the way you did and lived to tell the tale. I like you, mate, and besides the fact, I wouldn't abandon one of my own." Lestrade's smile melted away. "We've turned away many wolves seeking shelter over these past few years, we don't know who to trust, but I've got a feeling about you. And Sherlock, as abrasive as he is, I think he likes you, too."
, Inspector?" Sherlock left his question intentionally vague, wanting Lestrade to come to the conclusion on his own.
Mycroft tapped the tip of his umbrella against the floor twice, a titter of light amusement emerging from the back of his throat. "Yes, and I'm sure that offer extended to your bed, did it?"
John shrugged again, bringing the bottle to his lips, looking anywhere but at his curious flatmate. "You could say that," he finished dryly, wishing that the ale could hit him - and Mike - a little sooner, drag him under until he couldn't remember a thing.
Sherlock shot John a curious look, eyes running over his face for a fraction of a second before he continued. "So named after the fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel. The children dropped breadcrumbs to retrace their steps when they ventured into the forest, and the hunters have taken that idea and reinvented it, quite cleverly, I might add."
Sherlock wanted him so very badly. For all the shame he felt at the thought, heat settled in the pit of his stomach and inched its way down, until his cock was suffused with blood. John’s answering hardness pressed against Sherlock’s navel, a pointed response to his doubts that John mightn’t desire him any longer.
For the last hour, John observed Sherlock ignoring everyone else, in lieu of lying supine on the couch with his eyes closed. His breaths were deep and even, but that was the only indication that he wasn't just an unoccupied vessel. John wondered where the leader's mind was, or if he was thinking of their impromptu tryst in the woods, that morning. John was incapable of conjuring up any other image, than a blood-soaked, feral man rutting against him. It was driving him to madness.
John looked up to meet Sherlock's clear blue eyes, staring down at him with a swirling amalgam of emotions ranging from predatory to impressed. A challenge; that was what Sherlock wanted.
Sherlock sat back on his knees and wrapped large hands around John's hips, driving forward uncontrollably in movements that hitched John up every push, and knocked the breath from his lungs.
Sherlock's silence pulled his stare away from the infant and back to Molly, who seemed to be as riveted with the child as he was. She bit her lip and turned her head to look at him.
Sherlock went first to start the kettle, then to his mobile, which he’d left sitting on the coffee table the night before.
Anderson's mouth fell open piteously, speechless as he was singled out and insulted before the pack.
John smiled brightly, longing to experience that kind of excitement for once in his life. What must it be like to live with Sherlock Holmes?
John stared, his eyes switching back and forth between Sherlock's eyes and his mouth, then back again. He thought of his dream of Bill. It was all still so fresh in his mind, then having to bury his mate's body. Sherlock was right; John would have resented Sherlock, and most of all, himself.
Somewhere off in the halls, a door closed softly. John turned and slid into the last pew, smiling with nostalgia as he remembered being short enough to sit and kick his feet into the seat in front of him. Harry was always good in church, but John nearly always got a thorough tongue-lashing afterwards because he could never pay attention during Mass. Every once in a while, John could get his mum to crack a smile, but his father never so much as glanced at him until the vicar gave his final blessing.
Sherlock pointed his tongue and buried it inside of him, his breath hot on John’s hole as he panted. Sherlock had unzipped his trousers and released his cock from his pants, and if John tilted his head just a bit, he could see it hard, and red, bobbing up against his shirt as he brought John to the brink and back with his lecherous mouth.
John was not shocked in the slightest when his friend pulled back with a pack of fags already halfway empty. John shook his head, watching as the other boy pulled a lighter from a side table and lit up. "Does your dad know you do that?"
John narrowed his own right back, wondering what the hell the bastard was thinking. It was dark, but Sherlock stood out like a spectre in the night, all pale skin and incandescent eyes.
When they were seated comfortably in the back seat of the car, John angled his body towards Sherlock and watched as the man tapped away on his phone. "So, where to?"
The sharp click of heels over marble tile pulled John from his fretful revelry. The woman came to stand a bit away from him, gesturing to the corner that she had turned into a few moments before. "Mr Holmes will see you now, Mr Watson."
,' John pleaded silently with himself. He absolutely did not want to be standing in front of Sherlock Holmes—his new employer, mind—with a boner.
Sherlock nodded once, and then pivoted to stand before the fireplace, giving the room and its inhabitants his back. "Good, now that I've properly forewarned you, and you still endeavour to continue your foolhardy mission, I might as well accompany you."
“Um, my flat isn’t very far from here,” John mentioned, half-smiling, mostly out of nerves than anything else. “If you want, you could come back with me.”
John stared coyly up at his lover and parted his lips, watching as Sherlock unconsciously mimicked the action. Sherlock lightly placed his finger against John's tongue, his eyes narrowing at John intensely, depthless and prurient.
"Shit!" John hissed and slid out of the booth, away from the puddle of tea creating a mini-waterfall as it trickled over the edge of the table. The tea was hot, but not scalding, thankfully. Holmes stood up as well, though a bit more gracefully, not even a speck of tea had landed on his pristine suit. The sight just made John grind his teeth even further.
Between Sherlock's disdain and his own shameful thoughts, John was beginning to realize, with dawning horror, that he was throwing a wobbly because Sherlock actually went to work. In all honesty, John hadn't stopped to think of it that way, only the fact that he'd gone asleep alone and woke up in likewise fashion.
a very busy man. Surely you understand." His words were short and clipped, spoken through tight lips. The effect was immediate. John felt ashamed, as if he'd been thoroughly reprimanded like an errant child.
In the window, Sherlock stood with a fag dangled between his fingers, smoke swirling into his mystifying eyes. He was pensive as he peered down at John, a beautiful, lonely figure back-dropped in darkness. Sherlock nodded once, slowly, and then disappeared behind the curtain.
The bell rang over the front door and John didn't bother looking back, instead staring down at the menu as he thought of ways to excuse himself that would convince Jasper.
A groaned "Sherlock" reached his ear, echoed by a growl that managed to send John's heart on a marathon run inside his chest. There was obviously something intimate going on in the next room, and John fell back onto the bed, feeling a familiar tug in his lower belly.
It was nearing midnight when Sherlock let himself and John into 221B. Mrs Hudson had already swept through and turned every light on in the flat besides the bedroom and bathroom.
The alpha spared no thought to quick deaths. The man’s loud wails gave way to wet gurgles as he strangled on his own blood. John turned away as he noticed a piece of flesh between Sherlock’s teeth.
He almost wished the same could be said for himself. Almost. No matter how much he hated the impact one tiny little man could have over him, Sherlock felt like he could breathe for the first time in years. John’s presence caused a ripple effect in every aspect of his life, and Sherlock found himself all too receptive to it.
“Come on,” Sherlock said after a moment, and stood to shrug on his coat. He was long and elegant in his bespoke suit, and the coat gave him a dramatic flair that John quite liked. Long legs, fit body, striking eyes, cutting cheekbones, and those curls all made for a stunning representation. John couldn’t tear his eyes away and Sherlock knew it, too, by his wry expression.
“I think you're doing a fine job,” John mollified, smiling gently as Sherlock's eyes met his with some surprise, then restrained pleasure.
John sat up sharply at that, becoming aware for the first time that morning that he was completely naked. "Wh-what, I thought you said he'd be gone a few days."
John wanted to turn and see if Sarah was melting under that decidedly aggressive glare that Holmes had her pinned under, but he was enraptured.
"Funny you should ask, when I'm sure you've had me all figure out the moment I stepped foot through the door," John returned placidly, his eyes hardening around the edges as he stared back, unperturbed.
After their early morning activities and what was happening now, John felt so torn between getting up and walking away, and lunging across the small space that separated them. John had never met a man that looked so hungry when their eyes fell on him. In every interaction they'd had, there was that constant, covetous beast lurking just beneath the exterior. Earlier had only been a taste, and John was curious what else that beautiful mask was hiding away.
The world narrowed, and Sherlock squeezed his eyes closed as the pain grew and grew until he thought that his heart might very well tear itself right out of his chest.
what Sherlock couldn't say. He didn't have the words, yet something bubbled up at the back of his throat and stuck there like glue.
"Quite a desperate bid for my attention, Moriarty," Sherlock was mumbling to himself as he returned to the room. With a deft flick, the envelope landed on the bed between John's splayed legs, the pictures spilling out and their pointy ends stabbing John's flesh. Sherlock undid the knots on the bed posts quickly while muttering an unapologetic, "My apologies, John, we will have to revisit this at another time. Stay here; sleep. We have much to discuss in the morning."
"You mean, when Förstner..." Lestrade gestured vaguely towards his neck, unsure how to proceed. "That's
Long after Victor retired from his life's work, Sherlock remembered clearly his mentor's flawless manipulations of the Alpha's under his care. Throughout the years, Victor had tamed many impossible Alphas, and profited greatly from it, as well as made a name for himself amongst the A/B/O community. Sherlock, being Victor's protégé, naturally inherited his mentor's legacy and expanded it. Some would call it therapy, but taming entailed a level of psychological intimacy that delved further than simply talking over one's problems.
John stood beside Lestrade, warily observing the tense exchange between the alpha and his jilted lover. It felt like they were all infringing on an intimate moment, as it seemed. There was more to this argument than Victor's ability, or lack thereof, to inform Sherlock of possible threats in a timely manner.
Sherlock's lips met his only to tear away, then back again, softer than before in a tortuous cycle. John caught Sherlock's plush, bottom lip between his teeth before he could lift away, running his tongue over the wet skin. Between Sherlock's ministrations and emotions running rampant, John's insides were trembling with adrenaline and euphoria. He could almost believe that the last twenty-four hours hadn't happened, and that Sherlock hadn't revealed a less than refined side of himself, but then the moment wouldn't be what it was.
The woman tsked in disapproval at Sherlock and turned, freezing when she saw John standing there, appearing swallowed up in Lestrade's large jumper.
“Lestrade is being extremely thick today. I wasn’t able to get here any earlier,” Sherlock explained, his nose wrinkled as he mentioned the Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard.
He’d been radiant, and Sherlock—well, Sherlock didn’t much know what he would have done if they were the only two in the room. Lady Grey had been in her element and to pull her out of that would have been a dire misstep on Sherlock’s part.
As John slept on, Sherlock, too wound up to fall back asleep, prepared for work. He made quick work of his shower, shaved, and brushed his teeth before returning to the bedroom for clothes.
John had been a... surprise. Granted, their relationship had begun tumultuously, but the subsequent battle with the hunters had forged a tenuous camaraderie between them. Then it had become something more, something... dangerous and unexpected. What happened in the woods the day of the ambush hadn't been planned. There was no way for Sherlock to have known that seeing John bathed in blood and standing by his side would affect him so drastically. John had already given him his submission, but at that moment, he'd given loyalty without a thought.
His fingers were shaking as he placed the phone on the vanity and stood back to look at his costume.
“Any pain in your leg or shoulder?” Sherlock enquired, to which John responded in the negative. “Brilliant.”
Sherlock snickered, though the smile faded when he noticed Victor’s pitying stare in his peripheral.
He wanted to believe that Sherlock would look at him like this forever; he wondered if someone would ever stare at him the same way, and inspire the same ardent longing.
Sherlock breathed a small sigh of relief as he released Murray's hand, though he kept a neutral exterior. Glancing at his watch, Sherlock stood and placed more than enough on the table to cover their fare, plus a tip. “Good. I'll have my assistant call you for your banking information.” Sherlock threaded his arms into his coat and tied his scarf around his neck, his eyes staring vacantly out of the window. When Murray stood, Sherlock turned to look at him, his lips in a tight line. “If possible, bi-weekly updates are preferable. I'll pay extra for pictures, but it isn't required.”
Looking down at the paper, John scanned the first question. "Now Mr Holmes, you have amassed quite a fortune at such a young age. To what or whom would you credit your success in your entrepreneurial endeavours?"
It had never happened this fast before with anyone, not even he and Jasper, who had slowly been gravitating around one another for years now. John had known that eventually they would either collide at some point or drift away, just not when. It seemed after meeting Sherlock, all of that was out the window, and John didn't know what to make of that.
Sherlock was breathing hard into his ear, a constant crescendo that joined John's until he was coming into that hot mouth. Sherlock was devouring it all like a starved man, moaning softly as John's come erupted over his hands.
From inside, he heard a murmured expletive, and John’s irked tenor muffled by the door. “Just a minute!”
What was probably meant to be a tender moment progressed quickly, escalating from short, close-mouthed nibbles to wet, desperate and demanding. It was like having his first gulp of water following a drought, indulging in the moist heat of John’s mouth, blunt-tipped fingers tugging on his hair and a rigid cock twitching to life against his sternum.
"Pity," Sherlock drawled, a slow smirk creeping up to his lips. "It never ceases to amaze me how responsive your body is to me. I want to see how far I can take you before you reach your threshold."
John added another finger and a deep groan rumbled slowly up Sherlock's chest, crawling up Sherlock's chest and throat until it escaped his lips and into the dark room.
Sherlock unlocked it and stepped inside. The room was empty and the bed neatly made. Two fingers of whisky awaited him at the table, next to a bottle of Glenfiddich and a carafe of water. The room was large, but not overly so. There was room enough for equipment, but otherwise, it was comfortable and closed.
“But it can never compare to having a man’s strong, muscled back beneath my hand, a pair of hairy thighs spread out on my sheets and a
John's skin was crawling almost intolerably, the wolf inside prodding insistently at him to relinquish control and give over to the beast. He grit his teeth at the unpleasant sensation building up, like claws raking violently down his chest; of a million tiny insects marching under his skin; fire licking at his feet. Changes were always intense for John, so much that it left him gasping and curled into himself when it was over.
So, he was the black wolf that attacked John that night. That didn't make John feel any better about this. "If you try anything, I won't be held accountable for your sudden 'unfortunate' demise."
was who the unsuspecting citizens of London entrusted their safety to! Sheer stupidity; the amount of it made Sherlock want to gag. He didn’t have time to sit down and draw out a diagram for Lestrade. Surely, the badge he toted around like a key to the city was worth
"Don't be ridiculous, John. This is hardly London Tower." Sherlock scoffed, following him into the kitchen at a slower pace as his eyes swung curiously around the room. "Took you long enough to wake up. I got tired of watching reruns of Downton Abbey."
Sherlock's lips traced a narrow path down the line of John's stomach, pausing to dip a curious tongue into his belly button before continuing. John flinched as those lips teased the jut of his hipbones, nothing more than a fleeting caress. Sherlock's curiosity led him further south, his aristocratic nose pressing into John's skin, inhaling and storing away information that John could only guess at. All the while, Sherlock's hands played a dangerous game, teetering on the edge between sensuality and sexuality. Wherever Sherlock placed his mouth, his hands were sure to follow, running and mapping, liquefying John beneath his capable fingers.
Sherlock crossed his legs to keep from going to him, comforting him. “Yes, well. It still would have been nice to know you were back.”
John listened with a sense of dread. He wasn’t sure which part unsettled him more; the fact that Moriarty had escaped sentencing, or that Sherlock had fallen off the map for a period of time. All of it was odd, and none of it reassuring.
He stood up and shoved his feet into his shoes, grabbed his wallet and keys, cell phone in hand, and made for the door. But first, one last look.
of my will not to lose the restraints and spread your legs as far as they’ll go, force your belly to the floor and fuck you until your insides are plastered with my come.”
It was inevitable that they would get to that point where trust was implicit to move forward in a relationship, but John never thought about what it would be like to hear Sherlock say those words to him. His stomach rolled uncomfortably, because if Sherlock trusted him, then John would hate himself if he let that go to waste. Would Sherlock feel the same way after John told him about Moriarty?
“She was raised in a predominately Catholic environment,” Sherlock had told him after Mina made her excuses and scuttled out of the flat with a quick kiss on his cheek, dashing Greg’s hopes for a post-date shag. “Believe me, you wouldn't have gotten far with that one. She doesn't believe in sex before marriage and is under the illusion that all homosexuals are living in sin, hence her best imitation of sucking on a lemon when either John or myself are near. Really, Lestrade. Less than a minute of conversation with her and this was all fairly obvious to me. Even John could figure this out, and he’s-”
Jasper inhaled sharply, immediately regretting it when the frosty air invaded his air supply, stinging as it nipped the back of his throat and settled. “Fuck,” Jasper hissed, and turned on his heel, walking quickly in the opposite direction.
for helping me get this chapter out successfully and being there to bounce ideas off of. You are wonderful! Thank you all for the kudos, comments, and bookmarks, and all of those who have stuck with and defended this story from the very beginning! You know who you are, and I am very thankful to you! Also, to my new readers who came out and supported me, you also have my gratitude.
John raised a hand to the back of Sherlock's head, tangling in the chaotic curls there before he tugged his head down. Sherlock followed willingly, his eyes slipping closed as he stepped forward to wrap his arm around John's waist, drawing him near.
The sound that issued from his lips was loud, raw and animalistic as he threw the phone, gaining minimal satisfaction as it clattered noisily to the ground. Down, down he went, spiralling, sinking to the ground as his world collapsed again.
The air was cool against John's nude body, a constant reminder that he was in a highly vulnerable position, under Sherlock's complete control.
Sherlock chased him back to the wall, his large hands pushing back the robe to settle on John's hips. One of them sighed, and John’s legs were rapidly becoming useless with every swipe of Sherlock’s thumb over the skin of his midriff. John’s lipstick was probably getting all over Sherlock’s mouth and chin, but neither of them spared it a thought as the man’s tongue penetrated his lips with ease.
“He enquired after you and I'd informed him that you went to stay with your uncle for a few days. He was unsure whether to leave, but we both know you would have been angry with me had I sent him away, and to be honest,” Sherlock flicked his eyes up then, and met Jasper’s, “I didn't want to.”
John flicked his eyes up to Sherlock. “But I really don't want to get arrested for indecency if someone were to walk in and see my naked arse, so you'll just have to use your imagination.”
It was the tall, dark-haired man from earlier, and he was more striking up close than from where he’d stood before. And he was staring right at John with those penetrating eyes of his. For the first time in years, John felt self-conscious.
Mycroft whipped around to face his – no doubt, younger – brother, a hint of surprise on his face, the first real expression to crack through his perfectly impassive facade. “However did you allow that to happen?”
Maybe it was the caffeine in the tea John consumed that morning or the fact that he was about to be stuck in a building for hours with a man that routinely sent him into cardiac arrest, but he felt giddy and ready to jump out of his skin.
Usually, once Sherlock reached the bottom of an issue, it wasn't hard to proceed from there. Any other client, and Sherlock would be halfway through the session and quickly reaching a conclusion.
sorry for being a broke Uni student, I hope all this," John snarked, twirling a finger around to indicate their surroundings, "hasn't offended your delicate sensibilities. Sorry, Sherlock, I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place if you wanted a taste of the finer things."
The interior was just as elegant as the architecture suggested. Everything was all clean, sharp lines and monochromatic colours. John was scared to touch anything. Even though he had put on his best clothes—a deep, blue cashmere jumper and his least worn, but most expensive trousers—John still felt shabby and inadequate.
Before he could answer, the curious stranger interrupted his thoughts. "It's alright if you don't want me to know." The man shrugged, "You just look like you've had a rough time of it, is all."
“Is staying with my brother for a time,” Sherlock spoke in a low, rumbling burr, slinking forward to wrap a hand around John's waist. “Like I said, being stubborn.”
John found a booth not far from the door and slid in, while Mike made a beeline for the bar to order the first round. A gentle buzz from his pocket pulled his attention from the window, and before he could stop himself, John had the phone in his hand, anxiety a shock of static in his gut.
A soft creak pulled his attention to the door, where the timid woman from earlier stood, regarding John with wariness and what John could only describe as pity. He swiped a shaky hand over his cheeks and straightened his back like the soldier that he was, feet now flat on the floor.
Sherlock walked to his chair and sat, motioning for John to take the opposite seat. Sherlock caught his gaze and held it, searching for something he wasn't quite sure of yet. Some unidentifiable emotion kept him riveted to John, an unfortunate, wriggling, writhing mass in his chest.
John was dressed for the chilly weather in a cotton babygrow with mittens and a hood with animal ears, as well as a jacket to go over it all. When John returned to his former self with the intention of murdering the culprit for such dreadful clothing, Sherlock would be sure to point the finger at Mycroft. As loath as he was to admit it, Sherlock caught himself thinking the word 'adorable' more times than could be accounted for. It was out-of-character for him, and Sherlock wanted nothing more than to have his John back. He was becoming
The host at the door offered to take his coat, but John smiled and declined politely, intent on keeping it on. There was no harm in an extra layer between him and his date.
Sherlock looked surprised for once and then afterward, delighted. John had been happy to have impressed Sherlock, especially on the first case he was privy to, and hoped that soon, the detective would ask him along again next time.
John reached up on his toes and wrapped his arms lazily around Sherlock's shoulders and let his lips tease lightly against those sharp cheekbones. "Well then, by all means, Mister Holmes, your place or mine?"
“The way you dance on the stage, I wondered how you’d look in my bed, moving those hips the way you do.”
Not eating had always been a usual thing for Sherlock, but the John he remembered never went five hours without a bite. Wining and dining John had become a guilty pleasure of Sherlock’s, if only because he adored John’s little idiosyncrasies, even the ones he did unintentionally. The way John would tap his feet beneath the table when he found something pleasing on the menu, or the way he would wiggle in his seat after the initial taste. Now, John could hardly slow down long enough to savour his meals.
"John," Sherlock said his name softly in a way that made him forget about everything but that voice. "I want you here. With me."
Sherlock circled him once, one hand dragging a searing trail round John's waist, over his hipbones, lower belly, until Sherlock was standing in his line of sight again.
Sarah rolled her eyes, the first real sign of anger she openly showed. “I would have missed you anyway, John! Me, Mike, your parents—hell, do any of them even know you’re back in London?”
"So you've decided to accept my offer." It was more of a statement, than a question. Nevertheless, John answered with a nod, shoving his hands in his pockets as he stared at the plethora of dangling lights and paper lanterns that lit the streets.
John nodded, rubbed the tears from his eyes before his friend could see them, and jumped off the couch. "Have you got anything to eat? I'm feeling a bit peckish."
Lestrade cleared his throat quietly, drawing John's attention back to the older man as he turned and started down the hall, motioning for the other two to follow. "Usually before we eat in the morning, we do a run of the grounds. Sherlock requires us all to meet in the lounge room."
Sherlock gently withdrew his fingers and took a measured breath, breathing a bit harder than he was before. John could see his cock pressed against his trousers, the silhouette of a long, hard ridge. From his pocket, he procured a plain black plug, thick round the body and narrow at the tip, and added lubricant before placing it against John's loosened hole. With a quick flick of his eyes up to John, Sherlock pressed it in with unhurried precision until the tip just barely grazed his prostate.
John could feel his lungs growing lighter with every step closer to the basement exit. He couldn't help the sigh of relief when Lestrade opened the heavy steel door to an empty corridor that ended at a set of stairs at the end, which John assumed would lead them above ground. John allowed the door to slam shut behind them, satisfied to be breathing air that didn't smell of mildew and, well... wet dog, if he was being honest with himself.
John pulls his threadbare coat tighter around his body, in the meantime, getting a whiff of his own sour scent. Unless he got to a loo to wash up, he wouldn't be getting any business that night. Thankfully, he's not far from a place where the shopkeeper is a kindly woman who has a penchant for indulging the young strays.
John groaned in aggravation, a headache creeping up on him. "I'm not, Mike! Just you wait until you've heard the interview."
Sherlock - graceful, inviting, refined, even in his nakedness - stared down at him with an incalculable gaze and brushed the tip of the crop over John's sensitive nipples, pink and swollen from Sherlock's teeth and tongue.
John did as asked, draping himself over the seat, which left his arms and legs free, and his side resting against the padded back of the chair.
John stood slowly on shaky legs, bones creaking in protest against the change in position. One small step found him stumbling sideways against the rusty pipe he'd been chained to all night. John hadn't felt this week since he was a pup. His body had healed, but a night on cold, damp cement hadn't done a thing to replenish his energy.
Sherlock could feel John’s pulse pounding away directly over his as the man leant down to capture his lips.
Sherlock took a step forward, then another, relishing the bob of John’s throat as he swallowed, the slight puff of air he was close enough to feel as John gasped, and most of all, the delicate peony flush blooming on the crest of his cheeks.
Sherlock beckoned him to stand beneath the lowered bar and took his wrists in hand, pale eyes softening as John exhaled tremulously and flicked his eyes up to meet Sherlock's tentatively. Sherlock brought one wrist up and placed his lips over John's pulse point, a lingering kiss pressed gently over his skin, before doing the same with the other. "I'll take care of you."
"And who might you be?" Mr. Holmes, when he spoke, commanded attention, and John found himself wanting to hear that mellifluous voice again, just so he could feel his stomach flop.
John giggled and Sherlock joined in, chuckling lightly on the other side of the screen. “Stop it,” John admonished. “We can't giggle. We’re in a confessional!”
Sherlock was rocking back and forth, somewhere out at sea on a boat weathering a storm. A pitch black nothingness lit by strokes of lightning stretching like spindly fingers across the sky.
Mike paused and John closed his eyes, praying that Mike wasn't asking for what John thought he might be. But alas...
John gasped, wondering how it was Jasper got away with calling his father a git, but as he turned, he could see the edges of Sherlock's lips pulling up and knew it was all in good fun.
Sherlock, already seated, stood as John approached, his eyes scanning him scrupulously from head to toe. Even something so simple caused his stomach to flip flop pleasantly, and the skin of his neck to warm.
Irene smiled, her eyes gleaming in a way that made John shift nervously. “I think I have the perfect thing.”
Sherlock eased his hand beneath his gown and skirted around his cock to massage his balls, pulled tight to his body. His head leant forward of its own volition, warm against the cool glass, foggy with his breath as he took himself in hand and stroked.
Did he? John tried to think back to that moment. When he’d turned around, Sherlock was standing by the vanity with his jacket. And his phone had a lock code!
Sherlock was looming and John couldn't remember seeing the man move at all, but suddenly there was an inch of space between them and John couldn't be strong with Sherlock so close.
Sherlock was loathe to admit that it had been a rather perilous oversight on his part, and the pack had been equally perplexed that their alpha hadn't smelled the trap from afar.
“Remarkable,” Sherlock cut in, his brows furrowed as if he were confused by the words coming out of his mouth. “Interesting, intriguing, exciting. To meet you has been… not boring in the least,” he said. “The world can be such a dull, tedious place full of mindless idiots who don’t know how to use the evolutionary advantage of having larger brains than other mammals, just living out their little mundane existences. My mind, I… I constantly need a puzzle, something extraordinary to fuel it, whether that be from the cases that I solve or experiments, but rarely do I find someone who holds my attention the way you do, John.”
Sherlock was closer now. John had no idea when it happened, when either of them moved, because his feet felt rooted in place. “John,” he said, failing to pitch his voice to Lady Grey’s. It was his, it was him, and Sherlock would have to take it in whatever way he chose, because John didn't want to have to pretend with him. He was nervous, though, and too afraid that Sherlock would see that he wasn't like Lady Grey and walk away.
John stared at the message, staggered. So this was it. Sherlock must have told Mycroft what he’d decided. Now, it was all so very real, and soon, John would be leaving London and headed to places unknown. Sure enough, Mycroft would put him in active duty. He was a problem and Mycroft Holmes was a powerful man that had the power to render John moot. It was frightening.
A sense of dread welled up before he could turn his head to look. The voice was familiar in cadence, a slow, seductive drawl that catapulted his pulse into hyperactivity. It seemed what little fortune he'd had stored away, had finally dried up. With a deep breath, he turned to greet his guest.
The man across him sighed deeply, like a man heavily burdened. There was no real commiseration in his eyes, though his voice held the low coaxing of an adult with a child. "Time really is not on your side, in this matter, I'm afraid. However, as a show of good faith that you will come to the right decision, I'll allow you a week of consideration. Despite my protestations to your presence in my brother's life, I'm not a cruel man. Do use this week to say your goodbyes, Mr. Watson. Whether the army is your choice or otherwise, it will be the last time you will see Sherlock."
," Sherlock said sotto voce, and tightened his hold on John's wrist, though not enough to hurt but to bring attention to, "is why I never let my heart rule my head." Sherlock's thumb skimmed over his pulse in a delicate press, and John was sure Sherlock could hear John's heart thumping aloud. "
John stepped forward, slowly, as if approaching a frightened animal, hesitant. Sherlock only watched him, though his chest heaved with the weight of his despair.
Irene smirked at his offer, though she'd pulled out a phone and was texting rapidly. "Oh, don't bother. Sherlock isn't one for phone conversations. He prefers to text." She smirks again, that irritatingly attractive simper that makes him feel like a child being indulged. "You must be dreadfully bored, with no one to keep you company. Personally, I find it rather stuffy here," she stated dryly, bright gaze wandering over the chrome fixtures of the lights overhead, and the colourless walls.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, his eyes flitting skeptically over every inch of John’s person, as if he couldn't figure him out, as if he were an apparition. Finally, Sherlock's gaze locked with his and John felt a something click into place. He smiled, feeling much like a seventeen-year-old boy again.
Bill’s next words were soft, yet they clamped down on his throat like pincers, and every attempt at ambiguity and avoidance flew out the window, and there was just the simple truth of his words. “You're getting distracted.”
Holmes cut abruptly into his thoughts, voice crisp and precise as if he knew that John's attention had swayed briefly. "It's all about power as well. I have the livelihood of all these people in my grasp, and any moment, I can decide that I want to cut back on labour costs or that I simply don't need as many employees, and boom," he said, illustrating the sound with a vague hand gesture, "someone is out of a job."
Sherlock didn't waste time with pleasantries when he dropped into the seat across from John, anxious to know how much time they had left.
Greg could feel the heat crawling up his neck, the gradual warmth spreading up his cheeks and to the tips of his ears until he was hot like a furnace.
Jasper turned and laughed once he saw the bland look Mycroft was giving him. “Yeah, okay,” he agreed, throwing his hands up in surrender. “So, you rang?”
“Squats,” John smirked, though it didn’t last. His jaw slackened as Sherlock’s fingers found his prostate and with one flawlessly executed twist of his fingers, John was writhing on his hips. A string of expletives spilled from his lips as Sherlock turned the tables and began to milk him for everything he was worth.
John retired to his room, a small crowded area that felt even more so now that he'd been in the grandeur of Holmes's office building. He had to keep his room tidied and things put away to make more room for himself.
Sherlock stopped in the midst of an eye roll, his mouth open to say something snide, but the searing look in John's eyes stopped him short, and his lips snapped closed.
He couldn't think about it; the body of his kin as victims of the wild, their bodies being picked apart by scavengers. People he once loved, now just rotting cadavers; comrades he'd fought and laughed with, once flush with life.
"You were cross with him, but you forgave him almost as quickly." Now Sherlock was smiling a bit, crows feet appearing handsomely at the corners of his eyes. "I admired that about you, because it was like Jasper mentioned... That you understood him. There are very few that do."
Thank you to my loyal readers for sticking with me and I hope you enjoy this chapter as much as I did writing it.
"Look, Sherlock," John began, shoving his hands into his pockets, uncomfortably, "I want to help you find Jasper."
Sherlock didn't know why he felt the need to reassure John, but just to wipe that pitiable grimace off his face, Sherlock would say anything.
John broke off into a soft, harsh sound that resonated in Sherlock’s bones. Whatever John was trying to say, Sherlock felt it vital to let him get to the end of it.
Sherlock's voice dropped a register, until it was sliding over John with as much tangibility as a touch. The candle between them only ignited a devilish spark in Sherlock's eyes that hindered John's ability to draw in a breath fully. He was already half hard in his trousers, and Sherlock was running his tongue over his teeth like he already knew.
So, we've finally reached the conclusion of ItG, and I am so very happy to have gotten here. First and foremost, I have to thank my good friend
Lady Grey owned every woman on the stage as she moved in the centre, gliding through the steps with no effort. With each hitch up of her knees, the muscles beneath the skin of her thighs flexed enticingly.
John's knees around his ribcage might as well have been vices. Sherlock couldn't breathe so he took back his oxygen from John's lips. He thrust a hand between the mattress and John's head, latched onto his fair strands and pulled until that mouth was gaping and slick. Being inside him again triggered that incremental descent into insanity, a sluggish trickle like honey tipping out of a jar. He’d felt it before, that intensity that he knew he'd experience every time with John.
Really, was this his sad way of asking Sherlock whether he would be there tonight? John usually went for the straightforward approach, but the thought of flat-out telling Sherlock that he wanted to see him made John feel unusually bashful. Two messages came in, subsequently.
At first, Sherlock wasn’t sure how to proceed, and when John stepped in the loo, he’d shifted from foot to foot. When John returned, he’d held a bowl of steaming water and a rag, which he sat at the vanity in his bedroom.
"Now," Förstner began, "unless you want your partner, here, to die, I suggest you back up through that door. Hands up."
They were halfway into their homework when John could feel a migraine coming on, and he dropped his biro on the table to run his finger over his temples.
The moment seemed to stretch on forever, until finally, the sound of Sherlock's Italian leather brogues, clicking loudly against the marble, filled the silence. "Another one London's Finest couldn't solve with their tiny, little brains, I assume," was Sherlock's snarky greeting to Lestrade, though the man didn't seem the least bit perturbed by it. Yeah, he was definitely desensitized to the Sherlock-affect. John's employer was a certified nutter. "My coat, John," Sherlock stated, with a flourishing gesture in John's general direction.
John smiled with a cocky little twist to his mouth, shrugging. “Try me, Sherlock.” The words were out before John realized it, and surprised, he touched his fingers to his lips.
Remembering that he was not alone, John glanced over to see Molly staring back with a sad, but fond quirk of her lips. “You’re lucky, you know?” She said. “I’ve never seen Sherlock show an interest in anyone, and this is not our first scene together.”
The smirk was swiftly replaced with annoyance. "That is the general idea, yes. John, when was the last time you had your hearing checked?"
The air-con kicked on with a little rattle and Sherlock continued writing with a little shake of his head. It wasn’t enough to clear his thoughts, but at least he didn’t have to recall again the disappointment in Mycroft’s eyes.
"I want you to tell me why you believe you're here," Sherlock challenged, nearly giddy with the prospect of a fiery exchange, and finally -
Jasper leaned back, one of his hands traveling slowly up John's back and fingers gliding softly along the nape of his neck. The moment was heavy with unspoken words and John could feel their chests against one another, heartbeats elevated.
' The name flashed bold and bright within the otherwise pitch dark room, illuminating John's pinched features.
Someone was shouting John's name over and over, and Sherlock nearly snarled for them to shut up, until he realized it was himself forming those words, begging for John to breathe.
Holmes' eyes squinted as he thought, one abstracted finger tapping restlessly away on the armrest. "It can be difficult at times, however it helps that the employees I work closely with are all picked by myself. They are highly intelligent and capable people. Not on
Sherlock was pushing his head down, and without a second thought, John was stroking the foreskin back with one hand and licking his way up the ridge of Sherlock's cock. It was way too much, and not quite enough. John had never felt this hungry, this eager to please someone in his life, and yet this man could order him to get on his knees and do something he'd never done before.
His mother laughed again, this time a bit maniacally. "Oh, you know it keeps my headaches at bay, you remember I used to get those a lot, John-"
Sherlock stood, looming over his son like a dark cloud. “Just where do you suppose you were going to go, Jasper? You've no friends other than the one you left at Baker Street-”
Perhaps John should have been paying closer attention, maybe he might have seen Sherlock's stormy gaze settle intensely on him, colder than it had been in weeks.
"You know what happened," Lestrade paused, breathing deeply, slowly, in and then out, "and you know what I came from. For me, do this for me, Sherlock."
Holmes shifted in his seat, a sardonic smirk pulling at the corners of his lips. "It is exactly as it sounds, Mr Watson. People are not my area; I don't have friends, mainly because I don't suffer fools gladly. Unfortunately, the earth is overpopulated by them."
Sherlock nodded and John nodded back, pursing his lips. “Right, and how long have you known about this?”
As hard as he tried, John couldn’t stop thinking about the goodbye kiss, about the entire night. He’d had an inkling that Sherlock would be an attentive lover, but what had transpired had been mind-blowing, otherworldly, and hopefully not a one-time thing. Even in all that, their final moment had been the most memorable. No one had ever touched him like that, cared for him in the way that Sherlock seemed to in that moment. Although their acquaintance had been brief, John felt that he’d known the man for a lifetime.
They were nose-to-nose, and John’s warm breath fanned across his face as he laughed. Sherlock stared, unable to look away even for a moment. “This package comes with two… I hope you know that,” John said, and his smile faded slightly.
In the shower, John leaned his head against the shower wall, allowing the water to slide over his tense muscles. The bruises on his body were fading now, a violet color that proved unflattering now in a way it didn't before.
“Okay, not a chatty bloke, then.” Murray, turned back to the phone in his hand. “You're not – you know, stalking him or anything, are you?”
and Morgan for helping me make this chapter readable. You're both amazing and your expertise has been invaluable.
Instead, to take his mind off of Sherlock, John took the train to Sutton to spend the duration of the weekend with his parents, stewing silently the whole way over.
Even though John never slept in his own room any longer, he still kept his medical kit there and a full wardrobe upstairs. Sherlock's wardrobe didn't allow room for any of John's things, what with the amount of space his disguises and bespoke suits took up.
Sherlock had never lied to Jasper, but the urge to do so was strong, if at least to spare him the hurt that knowing that particular bit of information would cause. Instead he answered truthfully. “Yes,” he said, before pressing his lips together.
Sherlock pushed him again, until they were halfway across the room and the backs of John’s knees were touching the side of the bed. “Lie in it, John. Lie in the bed that you've made!”
John's smile softened into something less lethal, yet just as ambiguous. Why was the man so infuriatingly hard to read? "' Sherlock Holmes, tamer of over fifty feral Alphas, all within two years of practicing. Will he be the next Victor Trevor?'" John stopped, moving closer, and Sherlock couldn't withhold the small shiver that rolled up his spine. Less than a foot of space between them when John paused. "I don't know, Sherlock Holmes, do you think you can tame me?"
Sarah laughed and stepped closer, her eyes turning softer and her lips, pouty, as she advanced with all the hypnotizing grace of a lioness waiting for the right moment to pounce. "Come
Things continued to decline in the weeks following, to no surprise of John, until things finally came to a head one evening.
John caught Irene’s eyes in the mirror and allowed a smirk to curl the corner of his lips. “It’ll be fine, Irene,” he said, hoping to mollify her somewhat. “Look at this place you’ve got. I thought we’d be working out of seedy clubs for the rest of our careers.”
"William vous respectez votre frère lorsque vous êtes dans ma classe!" Morris yelled which startled everyone
"Uh no thank you I'll pay for it myself I'm the one taking him out!" John said handing Mycroft the money back.
“You forgot this bud. How's little Jacks?” Jeremy said going over to his nephew and great nephew. After tickling Jackson he went and sat on the love seat, that conveniently appeared underneath the wall mounted flat screen, after Kohen and him started visiting more.
“Sher what'd you two do?” Mycroft asked while Greg was cuddling up to him on what was now their love seat.
“Alright we came into new fundings so everyone has new uniforms and practice gear with their names on it. Practice starts September twenty third. Any questions?” Tvrdy asked
When Sherlock, John, and Jeremy arrived at the station, Jeremy took them to his office. It was a fairly big office since he was second in command. He had the boys sit down. Sherlock solved ten cold cases, while bouncing ideas off of John. By the end of Jeremy's shift all three of them were tired. He dropped them off back at the school, because the others had grabbed their stuff and Jackson for them.
"Pourquoi diable est mon frère dans cette classe pour ?" Sherlock said speaking his fluent French and got everyone's attention while Molly was just laughing.
“Well William I don't think you need my help figuring that out!” John said going down to kiss his boyfriend.
“Lizzie what do you want to wear, and you can take a shower?” I told Lizzie after waking her up. She jumped out of bed, and hugged me. I got down on my knees and kissed her forehead.
“Yes, yes I understand.” Sherlock leaned against Myc, who was now sitting directly next to him on the king size bed.
“It's already done.” John said then stood up and took Jackson back to his crib. When he came back out Picket and Mycroft were off talking Sherlock, Greg, and Anderson were talking about their first basketball game that was tomorrow.
John woke up the next day at the hospital, and was greeted the sight of Sherlock on the hospital bed feeding Jackson. “Mornin’ babe.” John said siting up to look straight at Sherlock and Jacks.
“It doesn't matter right now.” Irene said, and when Sherlock was about to protest she just glared at him.
“I know. I've been getting there because Uncle Jeremy and Kohen have dropped me off and picked me up. They will be in in a little bit. I've been going there a lot because I got a job there so I could support my son.” He said turning to Mycroft after Jackson was placed on his lap.
“Well our family might be, but I'm going to prove I can do this without their bloody money.” Sherlock said as Kohen and Jeremy entered the suite with Sherlock's back pack.
Soon enough all the boys were ready for the party. Sherlock and John in Button ups and blue jeans, Mycroft in his full out suit, Jim in his brand new AC DC shirt that Anderson bought him and his jeans. Phil in a Nirvana shirt  that he stole from Jim, and jeans. And Greg in his ripped jeans and one of his blue polos.
After soccer practice and lunch  John, Greg, Sherlock, and Anderson headed to the basketball court for the meeting.
"Night babe I love you. And you to Jacks.” John said as he kissed Sherlock on the lips where he was by the bassinet then leant down to the bassinet and kissed the second best guy in his life on the forehead. Him and Sherlock had agreed that Jackson would be both their sons because they plan to stay together forever.
“Yeah, but Greg there's something I should tell you. I don't know if you know about it or not, but I should tell you.”
“Alright.” John said as he started moving inside Sherlock never letting his mouth get far from Sherlock's. He started moving faster and faster when there was a knock on the door. “Shit!” The two whispered.
“We came for Christmas, made that promise to Mrs. Hudson, you know how she loves London. I also decided to show John around while we are here.” Sherlock says wrapping his free arm around John’s waist.
“Alright.” John said as he entered the room first then suddenly stoped as he saw Sherlock holding the baby. “Is he yours?” John asked
When the game started the five starters got in position for the tip off, Mike Stamford stood a few feet behind Greg since Greg was the tallest starter. The Bakersville hounds(The Sherlocks team) got the tip off and the game was at full speed. When half time came had only been rotated out for a minute or two, so they were tired. They went to the locker room for the half time lecture. They were standing there listening to Morris lecture, when suddenly Tvrdy was rushing over to stop Sherlock from falling.
"Ok class. In this class you will only talk in French. If you have to use your devices to look up how to say something you may." Professor Morris
"He is staying on campus. More specifically here. A bed will be moved into the the first bedroom, which I believe is Mr. Lestrades and Mr. Andersons. And Sherlock you will behave." Mr. Picket said
"After you were released from the hospital. You came back to Baker Street, punched me and kissed me against the door."
"I will always love you. No matter what, John. You're not weak. You are very strong and I love you so very much." Sherlock pulled the blanket over him. "It's not a weakness to go into a ward. And I won't send you away, okay? I just think that that might help you better."
"No. I mean... When we first met, I never thought that you would want to be my friend. When I realized my feelings for you, I never thought you would consider me worthy enough to be my boyfriend. I never expected any of this to happen."
John passed the violinist every day, and each day he stopped to listen. He felt a certain pull to the dark-haired violinist.
"Jesus, John. How did you even manage to get through med school and the army with that alcohol tolerance?" Greg got him out of the pub and supported him as they walked slowly back towards Baker street.
"No!" John said sharply. "I don't want to forget you..." He bit his lip as he looked down at Sherlock. "Unless... You think I'm too much of a burden?" Oh God. Of course, he was a burden to Sherlock. Why didn't he see it before? He was too wrapped up in his own troubles to see the troubles he was giving Sherlock. "God, I'm sorry." He sighed and covered his face with his hands. "I just..."
." He shrugged. "Either way, it helped for a bit, though I stopped talking to Harry when I got back."
"That he's my best friend." He leaned his head against the bed. "You are, Sherlock. Even if you're my boyfriend or fiancé or eventually husband, you will always be my best friend."
Sherlock closed his eyes, feeling relieved as he heard John leaving the room. He really didn't want to have to deal with a drunk John who would just tell him that he was going to pack his things and leave him, break up with him. He didn't know what a drunk John Watson would say, and he would rather deal with John when he was in full control of his faculties. Sherlock listened to the sounds coming from the living room and relaxed. He heard the footsteps coming out of the living room and he tensed for a moment, because he thought that John would come back, but the footsteps wound up going upstairs. Sherlock knew that he was being a tad unfair to John, that he should be nicer, but he really didn't want to deal with him when he was drunk. Most probably, drunk John would do something that sober John wouldn't approve of. Something like forgiving Sherlock.
was going on. He heard the door open, and he stood up. He turned around slowly, holding his breath. When he saw who it was by the door, he let out his breath in a whoosh, with a small moan. "That's... not possible." Everything spun.
"Here, breath into the bag," the detective said softly. "Please, just calm down, please, calm down, John. I came back half a year ago. We had this conversation already."
John smiled slightly. "That's what the tea is for, Sherlock... Keep me calm." He smirked. "Or is there some big secret about the tea that would shock me?" John teased, but then he stopped. "There isn't anything more, is there?" He pulled the kettle out of the familiar place and started filling it up with water.
"You said a ward would make you suicidal. So even if It's just part time who can say that you wouldn't want to kill yourself when you realize that you're in a ward again."
"No, we are not going to talk. Not while you're drunk like this. Your breath makes me dizzy." He sighed. "Maybe when you're sober again."
"No no no no no..." John muttered quickly, stepping closer to Sherlock instinctively. "I didn't mean it like that... I'd never think-" he sighed. "I just meant that it's helping, that's all."
be real..." John grabbed at the air as he realized that Sherlock had rushed away, and his stomach sank. He didn't know what the hell was going on... Before he fully processed that he had left it, Sherlock was back at his side, holding a paper bag out to him.
The doctor pursed his lips at that. Holmes had never called him by his Christian name. It was Watson or something even more formal than that.
He cleared his throat. "I was fourteen, and yeah, I was sent to a ward. My parents..." He sighed. "They didn't really understand that the worst thing to do is send your suicidal kid
"I'm sorry, John." He said quickly, entwining their fingers with John's. "And I'm very glad that you like it."
Sherlock groaned when he noticed the black car pulling up the curb. He pressed his hand to his eyes and stepped forward, waiting for the tinted window to roll down. "Bugger off, Mycroft. I'm not interes-"
"I'm just reminding you, so you won't keep your feelings or thoughts to yourself, because you think they might hurt me or something like this."
John stepped over to the table and set his water down, spreading his arms out and placing his weight on it. "And the second time..." He rubbed his chin roughly. "Second time was after I got back from Afghanistan."
Watson was sitting in his chair in the sitting room, reading the paper. Gladstone was at his feet, and snoring as he tended to.
John swallowed roughly as he finished reading the entry and quickly jotted down "16 June - Attempted suicide" on top of the list of numbers, and added "18 June - forgot in the morning. - 1 day" by the 1. He sighed as he closed out of the journal and skimmed through a few others, trying to find references to when he forgot. He opened up the entry from 30 June:
"Downtime." Sherlock quickly responded. "I've cut my time with cases because of your episodes. I don't take as many cases as before."
John smiled and said goodnight, glad to have someone in a similar situation as himself to talk to. He walked around the hallways a bit on his own before finding his way back to his own room. Before heading to sleep, he added a journal entry for the day:
. You forgot again and apparently you and him are fighting, but why? What happened between you two?"
John heard Sherlock's voice strain a bit, and he frowned, holding on to the chair for support. "I don't want to leave you... I just need to think." He bit his lip, not looking at the other man... His fiance. "I... It's just, I wanted you all those years from a distance, and I never thought you'd noticed... I didn't think there was a chance. And then you died, and now you're back, and all of a sudden we're-" He motioned towards his ring on the table, "-engaged, and I don't know..." He was breathing rapidly, starting to hyperventilate again, "I don't... know how to... react."
John resumed scrubbing the dirty plate. "What do you mean?" He shut the water and started wiping down the plate with a dishcloth. "You said in the video that you wouldn't be there because of my friends...?" He bit his lip slightly, realizing that he just gave himself away for memorizing the video. Ah, well... He probably already shared it with Sherlock once before... In an earlier "memory cycle", if it could be called something so crude.
Captain John H. Watson had been a doctor during the second Anglo-Afghan war, and even though he had been injured, he managed to stick it out until his company returned to England. He returned with a medal for his service and a cane for his limp.
"Mine." He answered quickly, walking over to him and looking at the note. "You forgot and smashed nearly all pictures because you thought you were imagining them. The notes somehow helped you to stay calm."
want you!" John looked up at Sherlock with puffy eyes. "And you know it. You know that I want you, so you know that if it works out just right, we could be together... If I get selfish... If I stop caring about
"Well..." He shook his head, chuckling softly. "I pickpocketed him as a homeless person and got him to chase into an abandoned warehouse. I pulled off my costume to reveal myself, and yes, he punched me. Broke my nose actually. And then he hugged me like a long lost son."
"Because...Why would I come back? Why would I come back if you threw me out before? Why would I come back with the knowledge that you don't want me anymore, John?" He asked and shook his head.
John's brow softened as he sighed. "I don't want you to have to change your life around me..." He frowned as he took another bite, now halfway done the egg. "I know how much you need your work, and I can't bear being the reason you aren't doing as much."
Surprised at the lack of reaction, John loosened his hold on Sherlock's hand, and stepped away, running his hand through his hair. "I told you?" His voice was quiet, and he smiled shakily. "'Course I told you, you're my fiance." It was getting easier to think of him in that way. Fiance. Not even boyfriend... Fiance.
"But don't you see that this here is putting me through much more pain than any attack would be able to? This is you deciding against me, when you forget me it just...happens." He breathed out again.
"Don't... John, don't hide your feelings away. Your face just hardened. You seem like you're locking them away. Don't do it."
John smiled softly, his eyes watering. "That sounds pretty romantic." He took another drink from his tea, finishing it off. He stood up and took the teacup to the sink to rinse it out. He dried it with a dishcloth and put it back in its place in the closet.
John picked up his hand slowly to touch the side of Sherlock's face. Then, in a flash, he leaned in and kissed him gently on the lips.
John shifted on the bed for comfort and swallowed roughly. "I don't want to be ill, Sherlock." He shook his head. "I don't want to be an invalid."
He quickly sent out the email before he could read it over, and started looking around in his files for the journal, but he drifted off to a drunken sleep before he could find it.
And then there was Pete. Pete was shy and just watched John for most of the meal. After they all returned their trays to the kitchen, he pulled John aside. "Is it true you're Anterograde too?"
"I know, John, but that doesn't mean I just stop being afraid. I just fear that something changes and you'll forget about me too."
"I know, John. I know that this is quite a shock for you. And it's going to be a shock every time you forget about me again." He answered slowly. "We don't have to... You know?" His voice trailed off as he stood up and stepped closer to the doctor. "Take deep breaths, John. Try to calm down."
Sherlock started working cases with NSY, and by extension, so did John. Their lives seemed to be repeating in theme, but this time they could be together. Properly.
John stared at Sherlock for a few moments. "I love you too, Sherlock..." His voice shook a bit. "But we can't. If anyone knew..."
"Yeah, but you never punch too hard. You might be all hard soldier boy and whatnot, but you never use all your strength when you punch me." He explained, looking up at John and watching him. "What are you thinking?"
"My mode of dress is no business of yours." Watson growled. "I would thank you to keep your experiments limited to your closet. If you would like to walk around all of London in a mere sheet, go ahead. But do not impose that on me."
John and Sherlock fight and forget about the tea... Who cares about who more? Well, they both feel they do.
Greg chuckled as he leaned forward to look at the ring. "That bastard. He didn't tell me anything! I thought you two were acting differently, but I would have thought you'd tell me. Well congratulations then. You're engaged to him. Do you really want to break this up?"
Sherlock sighed and took a deep breath. "Do you want to know what that is? Or do you want to try remember on your own?"
"I can't..." John looked up. "I can't keep doing this to him, Greg." He shook his head and downed the rest of his beer quickly. "I just can't..." John motioned for the bartender and asked for a double shot of scotch. "I know he loves me, and I just..." He sighed as he ran his hands through his hair, looking down at the table. "I can't keep stringing him along." The bartender put the shot down in front of John, and he downed it quickly, making a face as it burned the back of his throat. "You know... He really believes I'm going to start remembering again."
!" John insisted, "I'm not..." He bit his lip, looking down. "I'm not good enough. I'm damaged goods."
"Why am I crazy? It's the truth. You're warm and caring and lovingly. You're calm and loyal and good. You step into a room and everyone looks at you. You smile, you make a joke and everyone falls in love with you."
John entered the flat slowly, looking around, half expecting any traces of Sherlock to be gone, and finding out that the previous night had been a dream. As he looked around, his eyes fell on picture frames that he hadn't noticed before... And pictures. Pictures of them together... John walked over to the mantelpiece and picked up one particular picture-frame, smiling at the picture within. It was the two of them by a tree. John smiled as he gazed at the picture, and made to replace the frame where he found it, when he felt a small piece of paper on the back. He turned it around and saw that there was a small post-it note stuck to the back with his handwriting on it. "Hanover Sq 15 Sept, 2013." There was another small scribble beneath it, and it took him a moment to decipher his own handwriting. "10 days without forgetting!" John smiled widely and replaced the frame where it was, and picked up the one that was next to it, which was just Sherlock in profile. He turned it around to see if there was a note, and found one; "In Bart's- concentrating on last bit to a case. He nearly hit the camera from my hand because of the flash, but admitted that the picture came out well and let me keep it."
"John please..." He lifted his hand to touch John's shoulder softly. "Please calm down, okay, honey? Please. Don't panic. It's alright. Everything's alright, okay?"
John shook his head slowly. "But there is the question, no?" He chuckled. "Tennyson. 'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.'" He sighed. "If I'd have had you and
"Yes, obviously not when you're half-asleep. At least do me the favor of eating a proper breakfast, Holmes?"
"No, that's not what I meant. I knew that you wouldn't have a problem with me being gay, I knew that you'd never judge me for that, but I was afraid that if I was going to tell how about my feelings, you'd leave."
Sherlock took a drink from his tea and sighed heavily. "When I came home, here, I found you in my bedroom. You tried... tried to kill yourself. You swallowed sleeping pills with alcohol. When I came up here you had already stopped breathing. I performed CPR as best I could and called Mycroft to get you to the hospital."
"Well..." Sherlock shrugged, blushing softly. "If you want me to be honest, I cried after reading them."
He held himself back from writing exactly which facility it was. He had left the address on the table in the kitchen next to his phone, along with a note to Sherlock:
"Sherlock." He shoved his- Well, he didn't know what Sherlock was to him at this point. But he shoved Sherlock's shoulder. "Sherlock."
Sherlock nodded and shrugged at the same time. "I know. I always think about it. Every time I wake up, I think and wait if you're able to remember. And then I think about the mistake I've made. I still feel guilty."
"Oh, John. This would never change my view of you. Never. I am surprised, yes, but only because I wasn't expected it at all. But I don't think any different of you." Sherlock sighed and moved a bit, moving his hands up to the table and showing John his scarred wrists. "I know what you're talking about."
"I know..." Sherlock said quietly. "But I'm afraid every time that you'll forget me in your next episode."
"PTSD." Sherlock said, watching John closely after he sat down. "You have a tendency to react like this. And it's nothing to be sorry about. At all." Sherlock said with a slow shrug and leaned back in his chair. "Maybe you should lay down and get some sleep."
John reached his other hand over, running his hand through Sherlock's curls absentmindedly. "Am I seeing a doctor for it?" He stopped briefly. "Come to think of it, am I still working?" He resumed playing with Sherlock's hair. "Do you like this, by the way? I don't know any of your likes and dislikes now... It's driving me mad."
"Since when do I have a normal life, John? I experiment with body parts in my kitchen, I solve crimes for the fun of it, and I get off by deducing people. My life is not normal. Never has been, never will be." Sherlock looked down and took a deep breath. " So this is it, then...? You're breaking up with me, now?"
John laughed and shrugged, leaning in to kiss Sherlock again. "You're crazy if you think I'm better than you." John pulled away and rubbed his leg against Sherlock's. "Why do you think I never told you how I felt?"
"Oh no..." John laughed as he covered his face. "I remember those." He lowered his hands so they just covered his mouth. "How bad we're they?"
"Well I'm not the John Watson you know." John shot back, his voice cracking. He took a shaky breath and took another drink. "I don't even know who I am, but I am definitely not him anymore." He sighed, starting to feel slightly dizzy.
John set his phone back down, feeling more nervous than ever. Perhaps the right time to admit his feelings for Sherlock was going to come sooner than he’d expected.
“How?,” John interrupted his friend’s explanation. “How on earth could you know that? Sarah, from the surgery, set this date up for me; I was meeting a friend of hers. You don’t know her so she couldn’t have told you. And I certainly didn’t tell you so how the hell did you find out?” John was anger was only made worse by his confusion over how the detective had managed it.
“John, excellent,” Sherlock smiled as he answered the door. “Take-away’s just arrived.I thought you might be hungry so I took the liberty of ordering Chinese” Sherlock said, gesturing toward the food and two eat-off trays set up on the floor in the middle of the front room. Sherlock’s papers and experiments covered the furniture and most of the floorspace but it seemed he’d cleared this little circle for them to eat. It reminded John of building forts in the living room with Harry when they were kids.
“Yes, it is, and another round would be great, thanks,” John said cheerfully. He felt oddly thrilled by pretending he was on a date with Sherlock to this overly chummy bartender. It was like when he was a kid and he swore for the first time. It was the thrill of saying something he knew he wasn’t supposed to, something that was off limits, but strangely, he wanted to say it anyway.
“Oh John, I’m sorry… I shouldn’t have let you… I should’ve thought…” Sherlock was uncharacteristically anxious and lost for words.
“Right well after that she just sort of went off on her ex-husband, who I guess was quite a bit older and was the reason she wasn’t interested in older men now. I listened for a while, to try to be polite, but then it started getting ridiculous and I asked if we could talk about something else and then she just snapped ‘why?’ and I was a bit annoyed at this point so I said ‘because I don’t think you’re at your best when you’re complaining about your ex and I like to get to know you’ and that really set her off… And then she pretty much just left in a huff... Before we even finished the first course” John finished his story and looked up at his friend. He had felt truly angry at the restaurant, in the car afterwards and even just now when he was retelling the whole miserable ordeal, but looking up at Sherlock, who was listening intently as he ate his Chinese food, John suddenly felt his anger dissipate. The whole evening seemed quite funny all of a sudden and he grinned at Sherlock as he said, “Pretty bad first date, huh?”
“Oh,” Sherlock replied. He looked completely deflated and he’d been so happy before about the success of the party; John immediately regretted saying anything.
Bonus points if you got that the case was an allusion to the original Conan Doyle story, "The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle"... And as always thanks for reading, kudos-ing and commenting! <3
“We can’t see him right now, Rosie,” John said, kneeling down beside his daughter. “But I’ll be home tonight and we can both come back and see him tomorrow.” He hugged his daughter fiercely, suddenly feeling the need to hold the people who mattered most to him very close. “I love you so much, and so does Sherlock, he’ll tell you himself tomorrow.” John held his daughter by her shoulders and looked her right in the eye. “Alright?”
“It’s Valentine’s silly, did you forget?” Molly giggled. “They’re a gift,” she added. “From my very thoughtful boyfriend.”
John immediately regretted everything he’d said, as all the shock and fear that came with the news began to fill his body and make him feel slightly light headed. “Is he going to be alright?” John managed to ask.
“Oh I know, you’re going on a date with my little brother,” Mycroft said, not hiding his enjoyment at John’s shock.
Sherlock cut Mrs Stevens off mid-question. “As you know Mrs Stevens, your son is gay. He came out to you last spring and you preceded to send him to one of those horrid religious conversion camps over the summer. I do not know why you’re surprised that he’s left considering that you emotionally abused him for months because of his sexuality. Now I will not tolerate having a despicable and disgusting bigot like you in my home any longer so I really must ask you to leave.” Sherlock never yelled, but his rage as he said all this was actually frightening, even to John.
Right, so she saw everything. Now what do I say, how do I recover from this?, John thought, but Sherlock was way ahead of him.
“Oh nonsense, John, you’re always a great help. I wouldn’t be able to solve half the cases I do without you, or at least I wouldn’t be able to solve them as quickly.”
John smiled and glanced sideways at Sherlock sitting next to him. “Are you setting us up for sand sculpting disappointment?”
“I… I know this may come as a shock, but... I’ve been thinking about it for a while now and it’s real, I’m not... Overreacting or anything like that… I… Sherlock, you are my best friend. You’re an amazing, intelligent, loyal, brave, caring person and… I think, no, I know I’ve started to develope feelings for you… Feelings that are more than friendship, that are, you know, romantic… And well, there it is, I said it, I’m falling for you Sherlock, and it’s up to you how you feel about that, but I want to see where it goes if you’re interested so I guess… That’s it.” John felt somewhat out of breathe when he finished and he realized he’d been hyperventilating the whole time. He felt even more shaky and anxious now, but the deed was done. He couldn’t take it back, but he could retrieve Rosie and run from what he’d just done. So John made for the door, purposely not looking at Sherlock, but then he was stopped when he felt his friend grab his wrist.
John stared at the display of chocolates before him. In desperation, he’d settled on chocolate as a classic (not boring, classic) gift. He’d had no better ideas and he’d needed to make a decision before he ran out of time but now he was faced with another choice to be made: which box should he get?
“Yes but you didn’t have to say it so... so bluntly.” John was trying very hard to control the volume of his voice so Rosie wouldn’t hear them “She’s my daughter, Sherlock, not yours. It should’ve been up to me to explain that to her.”
“I’m getting Rosie, paying for our sweets and we’re leaving,” John said finally. How could he explain to Sherlock that his feelings were as strong as ever he just wanted the moment to be right when they told other people, especially Rosie. After all, for practically her entire life it had just been her and her dad, another person in the picture could be a lot to adjust to for her. John just wanted to be cautious especially with Rosie, he wanted, no he needed her to accept and be happy about his and Sherlock’s relationship. Rosie had to be his first priority, that’s what being a parent meant, so if she didn’t like the idea of him and Sherlock together they might have to hold off on things, as much as that would tear John apart. He knew Rosie adored Sherlock so he knew this could work, the morning on the beach had proved that. They had been the family he’d always wanted, or a version of that at least. He just needed to break the news to Rosie carefully so she would see it that way too.
I feel so sorry for baby Jackson. And also you might be mad because another twist next chapter that will leave Sherlock and Anderson weirded out for a bit.
The next morning around seven I woke Will up. “Sunshine, do you want to take a shower before my boyfriend gets here?” Will lifted his head from the bed and nodded, but made no move to get up. “Come on, what do you want to wear?”
“Hey.” Will says back and we kind of just get lost in each others eyes. After about ten minutes of just standing there Will suddenly moves when a new song comes on and I can tell he likes this song. “I love this song, my brother always listened to it when he was home from school.” WIll says with a sad smile debating whether he is happy for this song or not.
"So, Mycroft will be staying in our dorms and will get his teaching degree with our help." The Principal, Mr. Picket said
“Ok!” Sherlock said trying not to smile, but couldn't help it. And as soon as John saw that smile he pushed him up against the wall in their rooms and started kissing him. Exploring his moth with his tongs and Sherlock's to image trying to fight back but failing.
“No.” Sherlock said turning around and laid down bringing John with him since they had the couch to their selves. Jim and Philip were on one love seat and Mycroft and Greg on the other. Which of course Mycroft bought all the living room furniture and the t.v.s and mini fridges.
They grabbed two slices each and a soda each, then sat down in the living room. "So, Sherlock what were you afraid your brother would tell us?" Anderson asked actually concerned.
“So we should finish packing!” John said trying to get them to do something else. Him and Sherlock went to finish packing. Then heard Jim and Philip wake up.
“Hey, I’m practically an uncle to you, why wouldn’t I drive you.” Tony said picking up the carseat and clapping a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “Let’s get you three into town.” They went out to the car and headed towards town. Tony pulled up in front of a store with a big sign that said Rick’s.
As soon as I saw Will, I adored him. He’s cute and smart, he’s not my first guy crush, but he is the first one that happened immediately and made me feel like I do right now. When I asked him if our dads were right about him liking me, I thought he was adorable as he stumbled on the words, I can’t help but kiss him. I lean in and press our lips together. Will only hesitates for a second before kissing back. I pull back after about a minute from our slow sweet kiss, and smile. “Hey.” I say, because I don’t know how to say what I want to.
“Here they are you both need to sign. So they know you agreed on full custody.” She said looking at Sherlock.
“Mr. Picket, your nephew here woke up our Baby!” Sherlock said referring to the fact that Jackson was both his and John's.
They ate with a little bit of conversation. Then Jeremy and Kohen decided to turn in for the night, but first Jeremy asked if he could talk to John and Greg. Sherlock and Mycroft went and set up the playpen in his and John's room. Him and Mycroft were talking, as Jeremy and Kohen talked to Greg and John.
"Good, now go onto bed. You'll need all the rest you can get." Mycroft said to John. "School starts very soon for you four!"
“Whys he here?” Mycroft said coming out of his room with only shorts on and a towel drying his hair.
“How bout Speedys’?” John asked pulling Sherlock to him by the waist. “I mean Mrs. Hudson knew there was something between us.”
When they got into the suite Sherlock went to their room. He bent down and picked Jackson up from the crib and laid on the two beds pushed together. He laid Jackson by him and then laid in the middle. When John came in he moved Jackson to the bassinet right next to Sherlock's side of the bed. He then laid down on the other side of the bed and wrapped his arms around Sherlock. It was already nine at night so they fell asleep like that.
“You can call me Will, and she likes Liz or Lizzie.” He said then walked back to his drawings and started on another one.
“Ok!” Sherlock said throwing John a pair of boxers and basketball shorts from Johns dresser. Then took out a pair of boxers and a pair basketball shorts identical to Johns from his own dresser. They were their school basketball shorts for warm up days. Then they changed.
After dinner Tuesday night they all decided to turn in early. “Hey Sher, let's go lay down!” John said pulling his boyfriend up off the couch.
“Yeah ok.” He said getting up and putting his son in the bassinet and then wheeled him to the next room that the doctors directed to. It has a bed, T.V., and a few chairs in it. He picked his son up and laid on the bed as Molly went to get the rest.
“Oh Will about last night, Leon called back after he checked.” I told him not sure if he still wanted adopted or not.
“It is broken in three places they need to realign the bones then cast it, I’all be on crutches for eight weeks then I'll have four weeks of physical therapy, and I'll have to wear a boot during that time.”
“No, I hid it so no one could tell my parents. Well, I told them I couldn't help. They told me if not then as soon as they were gone, call the cops, and run. That's exactly what I did. I was the last thing my parents saw, they wanted help, but I didn't know what to do so once I called the police I was gone.”
“Yes, and I have full custody I can move to another room at school, but Picket said if you guys are ok with it he can stay in the suite.” Sherlock said scared of what they'd say.
“Welcome home, you two. Why don't we go grab a snack, since we just drove three hours?” Greg asked us as we came in.
“Yeah, could you put him in it, it's hard to pick him up when I can barely stand?” Sherlock asked his brother, even though he was looking into his little boy's eyes.
“Uh one second.” They both grabbed a pair of shorts and slid them on. Then John went and opened the door.
"Oh John. John, John, John. Deductions. The way you look at him firstly, it's not hard to tell Mr. Watson. However, I have to make sure you are, how you say, good for him. Do you truly like my brother then, John?"
November twenty forth, Thanksgiving Day, came along the boys had a team breakfast for soccer and basketball, then they went over to Kohen and Jeremy's place. When they arrived with their overnight bags, since Kohen had been persistent on Mycroft, Greg, Sherlock, John, Molly, Sally, Philip, Jim, and Jackson staying the night. They had each couple Share a room and Jackson stayed with his fathers.
“Hey Sherlock, come out to your guys sitting room real quick. You can find your jerseys in a little bit.” Picket said coming into the room.
"Yeah I started remembering everything clearly when we were thirteen, and it just got to much, even the drugs weren't helping me forget.”
I've was sick when writing the last art of this chapter, so let me know about mistakes so I can lix them, Thank you hope you enjoy.
"Now Sherlock there are 2 rooms, a west room, and an East room. I would perfer that you stay in the West one." Mycroft said to Sherlock.
Shortly after breakfast so around nine Jackson was a sleep in his fathers arms. John took him from Sherlock when Sherlock was about out and took him into their room. He came back out, sat back in his spot, put an arm around Sherlock who just laid his head on John's shoulder. They were all glad for parents week so they didn’t have class. Greg, John, Jim, Sally, Harry, and Sarah's parents came by everyday of that week all wanting to get to know each other and the kids. Sherlock caught up with Jim’s little brother, who thankfully was nothing like Jim. The parents all wanted to spend time with little Jackson, and John and Harry's parents became Jacksons Grandparents. They were all kinda sad when the end of the week came but everyone's parents promised they'd visit often.
“Don't do anything stupid don't forget you do have the rescheduled soccer practice.” Mycroft yelled at them as he and Greg headed to their room and Jim and Philip to their own.
“You know I think you and some kids I know will get along pretty well, now let's eat before it gets cold.” We ate breakfast and then Will asked if Phil wanted to go play video games with him and of course he did. Me and Liz went and played legos downstairs.
We spent the rest of the day going shopping for clothes, games, toys, sketchbooks, composer music sheets, bedding, and the instruments. Now at ten o'clock it's just me and William up. “We should get some sleep, my boyfriend will be here around eight.”
“Well, barley eating kinda does that to you. Hey Sherlock you know how I'm a detective, well I was wondering if you would like to come with me to the station tomorrow. Your always saying you'd like to be a detective, I even got you permission to go to the crime scenes with me and my team.” Jeremy said, chuckling at his nephew.
“Hey, hey look at me.” Myc said soothingly, and then added, “You are nothing like mother, father, or Sherrinford. Do you understand me?”
“I'm not hungry.” He said then turned to Jackson pulling out a stuff bee from his backpack, “Hey look what I've got for you.”
“William!!!” He then screamed ass he came all over them both. As he calmed down after collapsing on Sherlock he said, “Aren't you glad at least these walls and doors are sound proof?” He then cleaned both him and Will.
"Because, that college doesn't have dorms, and only halve the teaching courses. And we can provide the rest." The principal took a breath. "But until there dorms are ready they all need places to stay."
I'm trying to sound hopeful, but I'm sure she sees right through it. “We will, some how somewhere. We need to be good here first though, that way we have a chance. Promise me?”
"Hello James." Sherlock said, completely aware of how drunk his old friend really was, and then completely aware of how tipsy he himself was.
John brushed his teeth and changed his clothes, and tried to go to sleep in his new bed. Don't get him wrong, he was tired alright. Physically from moving, and emotionally from the whole confrontation with Mycroft. John just couldn't sleep. John also couldn't help but stare at the beautiful creature in the bed across the room. John found himself fantasizing about the taller, dark haired male. *How I would love to run my fingers through his dark brown hair.* John thought to himself. *To gaze into his cerulean eyes for hours, trace his prominent cheekbones, kiss his pale pink lips, and hold his tall figure close to my own.* And with that thought, John was finally calm enough  to fall asleep.
“Ok, good I was kinda worried. Hey Myc, Greg, Jim, Philip, and girls. This is my son Jackson Tyler Holmes. I'll be staying here for a day then he's coming to live with us at the suite, Picket already approved it.”
When Greg and Mycroft saw John and Sherlock go to their room they decided to go to “bed” their selves. Myc saw Sher and John's phones on the couch and picked them up and started heading to drop them off to the boys when Greg stopped him.
Next they went to Aca Deca where their Biology Professor Mr. Nicholas taught it and got them ready for competition against the rest of Nebraska, and if they make it the rest of the country.
“I don't know if you've realized, but my favorite new student teacher, who also seems to live with you is in all of your classes.”
It's October fifteenth exactly one week after the party when things start going bad for Sherlock (or good depending on how you look at it).
Sherlock and John headed out the door with John behind Sherlock so he didn't realize when John was stopped by Mycroft. "You better take care of my baby brother!" he warned. "I will, I don't know why your so dead set against me taking care of him, but I can so just leave it!" John then ran to catch up with Sherlock who was about to his car, because they both agreed to take Sherlock's car but John driving it.
“You need to stop working yourself so hard, I know your using the job as a distraction to but in eight weeks you get to go back to being JV starter for basketball and Varsity starter for Soccer then you'll have track too.”
“So your serious, about adopting us I mean.” We were still stopped, but I needed reassurance before I let Liz know.
“It is three floors, well technically five, because the attic and the basement are the same size as the other floors. I turned the attic into a game room for you, and my boyfriend picked out some of the games he thought you would like. I'll show you it in a little bit. Liz the basement is a huge play room for you I'll show you in a bit too.”
“You know what Mycroft, Greg I know what you were just doing, but I don't really care because you’re my favorite.” Mr. Picket said, and saw John smirk down at Jackson. “Oh, and John Sherlock better get that science work done if you fail a test you can't play until you pass one.”
Later at the restaurant Sherlock saw the live lobsters in the tank. "That is just cruel. Why would they put live lobsters out and catch them in front of the families."
“Yes, to both. I love to draw, and write. I also think both of us would like to meet your boyfriend.” Will said, but he sounded like a scared kid, not his normal self.
“No, it's not, you don't understand Myc.” Sherlock said sitting down, since his leg was starting to hurt.
“You're a science teacher, PE teacher, and coach. You coach Soccer, Basketball, and Track. Occasionally you help out with Baseball. You were also married before like him, both of you were married to women although you did like both. They cheated on you both, and then after you divorced them you realized you had feelings for each other.” Will said which took me and Phil by surprise, but left a smug look on Liz.
"I decided I would help my little brothers teams by supplying them with equipment and gear." He finished.
"Yeah! Well except slam the door in Kohens face." Anderson said, then realized he said his first name.
Kohen walks over to the couch where Jin was laying and picked up the remote. Everyone expected that he would simply turn it down but surprisingly enough he didn't turn it down at all but he chucked it at the tv, only to have it miss the left side by about two inches.
"Don't worry we don't care. Your trying to stay better and that's all that matters." John said to Sherlock, and the other two agreed.
“Well, I think it's set up now. Let's put Jackson to bed, he looks ready to fall asleep.” Mycroft said as he and Sherlock finished putting up the playpen. They stepped back and admired their work. Sherlock picked Jackson up from his bed and held him cradled in one arm, while he held onto the bedpost with the other.
Half an hour went by, and for some reason these drinks were getting to them so much faster than the rest of them. Jim and Sherlock were having a long conversation about how they had been for the past year where they weren't together, and suddenly it was like they were never apart. They had decided to have a staring contest, and as if something new (or old) clicked in both of their minds they were kissing. Then a voice rose over all the rest.
He walked into his and Mycrofts room where he found Mycroft on their bed with his shirt off showing off his abs that barley anyone knew about. “Did you get them their phones?” Myc asked his boyfriend as he backed Greg up to a wall.
"So now you're even good at History?" I whispered with my lips almost touching his ear which sent a visible shiver down his spine and earned him a smirk from Me.
"I'll be back. I'm going to take Molly and get us all some food from Speedys'." Sherlock said, going and grabbing Molly.
“Yeah she's the only one who knew about me and Jim. But let's just go.” Sherlock said leaning on John as they started to walk to the Lambo.
They were unpacked by twelve so since the others were still “unpacking” they decided to go out on a lunch date.
"I said I'm taking him out he's my boyfriend, you're not going to pay for our date!" John said practically screaming at Mycroft. Then calmed down and turned to a confused looking Sherlock "But would you like to go to Red Lobster, Sherlock?"
“He's coming by to talk to you two and take you home with him during breakfast. You and Elizabeth will go to the sibling room early, so you can tell her. Okay?”
Phil and I headed up to the attic to play video games. I picked out Injustice for the Xbox 360. I chose to be Nightwing, and he chose Batman. I won, but I'm pretty sure he let me. Afterwards we watched some T.V., and talked for a while. He asked me, “Is there anything you want to do besides be in a band, when you get older?”
It is November fifteenth nine days before Thanksgiving that Jackson turns a month old. Sherlock walked in to the suite at seven a.m. “Where have you been?” John questioned him as he entered the living room and saw all five boys, Jackson, and the four girls.
I woke up screaming. I have this dream on the anniversary of my family's murder, and some other times. Though I've never had it that graphic. I was still screaming about a minute later when Leon came in. He just came in sat down on the bed with me. He hummed a little, but he always did. See the thing with me and Leon is he was my dad's friend. My dad was a detective, and Leon was working with the local police when we first came to the states. Leon had always been there when our dad was shot, or put in danger. He would help Mycroft calm me down. It took me a little bit to focus, but when I did I realized there was another figure by the door.
“Yep! She texted me and wants me to meet her there. It's St. Francis, right her in Grand Island, Nebraska.” He said pulling his phone out to show her the directions.
"Well I'm Sally, that's Harry, and she is Shara." She said pointing to the person walking through the door.
"Alright let's go then." John said, grabbing both their coats, his wallet, and sherlocks keys and walking out the door with his boyfriend.
“Yeah.” John said taking the bottle, then once Jacks was burped John took him and started feeding him again.
Around five thirty P.M. Sherlock, John, Greg, and Philip were deciding what to do for dinner. They decided to go freshen up then decide. There was a bathroom connected to each bedroom and one in the hall. Sherlock and John called their room 221B and Philip and Gregs was 221A. They lived in 221 Baker dorms.
"Ah shit! I can't let him in, and not my brother, but I'm already in trouble probably." Sherlock exclaimed pacing back and forth. "I'll answer it!" Greg popped up excitedly. "No...!" Sherlock said but was to late to stop Greg.
“Why? I love having you pinned underneath me. Now Mycroft also put new pajamas on the dresser last night, and I really want to help you get dressed, since I can’t get you undressed.” John says getting up and pulling his boyfriend with him. John pulls out the new pajamas and starts to dress both him and Sherlock. Both Pajama sets were basketball themed and had their last name on the back, with their numbers.
While they walked to practice they all learnt that all four boys were sixteen and of course freshmen. John could tell Sherlock was nervous and started walking by him. “Hey, Sherlock what's wrong?” He asked the curly haired boy. “Nothing.” Was the only answer he received.
“Ok, thanks dad!” He said hugging me then running to the room that is his. I couldn't help but smile, he called me dad, and wants this to be permanent. I walked to his room, and when we got there he was so happy about all the stuff in there. I had some comic books, movies, and some music. In the music there was Black Veil Brides, Bring Me the Horizon, some country, and some pop. “Dad this is awesome! Wait, I have a question. How can you afford all this?”
John gets confronted my Mycroft about his crush on Sherlock, and catches himself fantasizing about his 221B roommate.
“Are you two boys and Jackson ready? Mycroft took his own car, so when ever you two are ready to leave we can.” Tony said from the couch where he was waiting with the carseat for Jackson next to him.
“You still have this?” He asked his uncle as he looked at the cover of the album, the cover said Sherrinford, Mycroft, and William.
"Yeah he was a great friend when he talked you into drugs! And when he used Molly!" Mycroft said yelling at Sherlock.
Sherlock was not looking forward to his first day at the Bakersville High school in the United States. It was of course another plan of his brothers to get him to socialize. Sherlock already had a spot on the soccer team and the basketball team. He was the star of his middle school soccer team or football in London. He had tried out for the basketball team and made it. Now it was just school.
“Yeah babe I know and I love you too.” Sher replied rapidly unbuttoning John's blue button down. Then they both moved down to their pants. When they were completely naked and on the bed John got out the condoms and lube he rolled a condom on and then stretched Sherlock. When Sherlock was stretched he lubed up his own cock and positioned it in front of Sherlock's entrance. He captured Sherlock's mouth as he slowly pushed in to Sherlock's hole. “Fuck!” Sherlock said.
“That's great kid!” Kohen and Jeremy both said, then Jeremy quickly added, “Yes I just said kid because first off you are not technically sixteen until January sixth, and second sixteen is not and adult here like it is in London.”
When the trio arrived at the soccer meeting they were greeted by coach Morris. "Ah! William, John, and Greg, correct?" Morris asked them. "I go by Sherlock not William." Sherlock answered. "Ok, I'll try to remember." Morris replied. "Why don't you boys go find seats." He said pointing to the bleachers behind him.
“Alright, well, we all forgive you as long as it wasn't on purpose.” Sally said so no one could say anymore.
They were back on the court and when it came down to five minutes left in the third quarter Morris was yelling out at his team the play numbers to set up. Sherlock went to shoot the three pointer, but as he jumped a member from the opposing team came up and pushed him. The ref called it, but it was to late to control Sherlock's anger. Sherlock held his anger in through the free pointers, but then as soon as the other boy was on the court again, Sherlock was out of it and completely pissed. They started playing the game and the boy tripped Sherlock as he ran up for a layup. Sherlock landed on the leg that had already given out on him in the locker room. Sherlock was laying on the court and couldn't get up. Jeremy and Kohen had rushed down there with Mycroft, they had the stretcher brought in and Mycroft and Jeremy helped the paramedics get Sherlock on the stretcher.
“Philip! I just put him to sleep!” Sherlock screamed at Anderson. While Sherlock continued screaming John got up went picked up Jackson, while Jim turnt up the t.v. to drown out Sherlock's yelling. John came back with Jackson all wrapped up and sat on the couch where Jim had moved so he didn't get diapers thrown at him.
“Your boyfriend.” I said and then realized, I again could have ruined this. If he doesn't leave us because of that, then he really does want us. “Sorry, I um… d-didn't mean to.”
"Good babe, so all the same classes except math." I said with my lips twitching upwards. John just looked at me grabbed my hand and dragged me to the history room. All four of us plus Sally and Molly had almost the same classes, so we all sat by each other except in math, also French because Sally had Spanish. Me, Anderson, and Molly had the same schedule. Then John, Greg, and Sally had the same schedule except Sally's Spanish.
!" He hiccoughed. "The only thing I know is that I can't keep doing this to you..." John looked up and bit his lip, his eyes swimming. "The look on your face yesterday when you walked in..." He jumped as the kettle started whistling. "I'm only going to do that to you again and again and again..." John repeated as he turned and shut the flame.
Sherlock looked at John and nodded, before he let his head fall down. He looked at the blanket and moved his fingers over the fabric, staring at it. "But...I don't want you to feel obligated to lie to me, John. I want you to feel free and tell me everything what's on your mind."
John gazed up at the building and took a deep breath before stepping in resolutely. They were a little surprised to find a random man walking in to the facility, but he slid them a paper with Dr. Morstans' number and information, explaining the situation. It took a while, but eventually they gave in. A session with a random psychiatrist later, John was shown to a room.
want to be engaged to you..." He said softly. "But I'd rather ease into it." He smiled. "Hence my question... Would you like to be my boyfriend... again?"
John forced a smile and quickly turned away. He had been about to share that part of himself with Sherlock, but when he had thought he already told him... It shocked him, and now that Sherlock may not know... He swallowed and grabbed a cup from the counter, quickly putting it in the sink to fill it up.
"Nothing! I-" He turned off the water and took a long drink. He looked at Sherlock briefly and pressed the cold glass against his lips as he turned his head to look away. "I just..." He sighed shakily. "That wasn't the first time I tried." He mumbled quickly and then pursed his lips, not daring to look at Sherlock's face.
"Yes, I know. But the last hours you weren't yourself and now you're starting to be my John again." Sherlock blushed and looked down.
There was a faint sound of footsteps. "John..." Sherlock almost whispered, staying in the doorway. "Don't lie to me. Talk. Open up. Please."
"He..." John sighed and took another swig from his beer. "We..." He frowned. "I don't even know..." He sighed and looked down at the beer he was holding. "He deserves someone better."
a Doctor, maybe not a specialist in amnesia, obviously, but she understood." He said softly, sounding like he had said this all before, which was quite likely.
