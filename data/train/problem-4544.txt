He sees the disappointment in his little brother's eyes. The hero just lost his pretty red cape, but Dean doesn't give a damn. John just lost his.
« YOU are too complicated. Send this one to hell! »
The parking was full. He grumbled.
« So, here we are, at last »
« Hmm »
« He’s currently in RR ; you’ll be allowed to see him as soon as he’s transferred to IC. » the doctor replied with a smile.
He pushes the door and finds himself facing the same scene as that year. A donkey-shaped pinata hangs in the middle of the room. All the guests are dressed in jackets and hats, sweating under layers of clothes, but all smiling.
“He’ll always come first.”
And then nothing but silence for several minutes.
She felt honored and smiled...
Neither Chadwick nor Jewel had managed to get any support whatsoever from Castiel as he didn’t want to mix in.
« Really ? » Dean said, adjusting the hat on his head.
He slowly ran his hands against his lover’s thighs and grabbed his hardened dick. He caressed it and, slowly, leaned toward it.
«Cass… Don’t worry about this. I called Sammy, that lawyer friend of mine, remember ? He took care of everything after Tessa passed away.»
« Dad, can I put the second movie now? »
"You 're going to pay for this" he said to Castiel as he joined his daughter.
« You don’t seem to care about my taste in clothes when it comes to borrow my shirts » he replied, coming down the steps.
“Castiel?” Sam asked, worried.
thank you for being here.
“House aperitif for everyone,” he repeated grumpily.
"You can't let them dictate your life, Cass! Damn it! ", letting go of his grip.
« Come here, handsome » He walked around it, grabbed the reins and straddled it.
« OK » she nodded.
« Why is that? » Dean went on.
Chadwick opened the door.
Castiel pulls his friend towards him. John finds himself on all fours, between laughter and hiccups.
« Because I need some more time, Pumpkin » he replied with a smile. « And because the both of us still have a lot to talk about»
"What does that mean ? Really?", as he looked at him.
« Er… a… what ? »
« But he looked sad when he said it» Chadwick went on as he stood up.
She knew Castiel well enough to know something was bothering him. His eyes were speaking for him. And what she saw in there was sadness.
« I find this rather hilarious. »
« How many guests do you expect? » Balty asked, grabbing a cup.
Dean closes his eyes again.
« Healing process ? My ass ! » he said, raising the tone of his voice.
« So, theater tonight ? »
« How many times have I told you not to let your fingers too close to his mouth while holding that toy. Throw it away, this squeaky noise is getting on my nerves.»
Castiel ended up falling asleep on the sofa... All he dreamt of were emerald eyes lost in his own eyes and he woke up in the morning with that bitter feeling that he had missed a new beginning. He left for work with no enthusiasm because to be honest with himself, Castiel didn’t like his job... He was supposed to quit after Nathan’s return from military service... They would have left for the Western coast where they both wanted to open a vintage shop... It was Nathan’s dream, not his, but at that time, Nathan was his own dream anyway.
« Gimme five minutes »
They chatted about this and that.
Dean gently pulled his face away. He desperately needed to watch him, to dive in those eyes, pupils dilated.
« Speak of the devil » Dean whispered with a smile.
“Ellen,” his eyes were wide with exasperation.
" Tell me I’m dreaming… So now, who’s behaving like a kiddo here ? " Castiel sounded discouraged.
« Boy, I don’t know what’s got into you but you seem to travel a lot lately » Bobby said, drawing circles on his temple with his forefinger.
He loved their peculiar friendship, the strange and ambiguous security. He couldn’t give him more and felt extremely selfish, but that was it.
It's not every day you turn 21.
Dean was lying on his back, hat on his face.... legs folded… Castiel had not idea what to say or do, somehow apprehending Dean’s reaction.
Then he looked in the rear-view mirror.
"It's a funny name," seriously.
« Thanks… but you’re prettier » Lisa replied, extending a hand.« Hello »
« No, Cass » Dean said, leaning towards him. «  We are a family, we take decisions as a family, all together… If you don’t wanna go, so be it… Period »
« I believe you’re incapable of taking care of anyone.»
« Daddy… I’m sorry… I’m so sorry ! »
« So ? What do you think ? » showing a pair of blue fringe boots.
« What is it ? » Jewel asked as she ran to Castiel to help him.
« I promise I’ll live as long as I can and I’ll turn your life into a nightmare, is this ok for you ? » He stated with a smile.
"Hello, Dean," he answers in that hoarse, low voice that became his.
« Don’t tempt me» Dean laughed too and walked out the door.
They talked about their day, Dean told them Balty had come to visit and that he would come back another day and introduce them to Bryan. The children were enthusiastic about the news, as they missed Balty so much. Castiel side glanced at Dean who winked back.
« It’s been so long » she smelled her eggs.
Lost in his thoughts, he didn’t hear the door open and didn’t see the dog run in the kitchen.
With his head down, Benny smiles under his cap while uprooting the weeds growing between the slabs of the courtyard with the tips of his shoes.
He suddenly pulled the reins. The horse reared a little.
" I’m not Michael, Cass…I’m not playing with you. The way you feel about me, I feel the same about you...Do you understand ? So yes, I believe in us and I’d like to know why you thought otherwise after all we’ve been through to get there".
« Try not to let him feel your stress then » he smirked.
« Cass ? »
He and Jo talked a bit about his work as Bobby was sitting with the children.
"Why would you care? ... It was just a cranky guy, Cass ... .nothing else".
« Go ahead and mock me, he who laughs last laughs best when Spring comes »
« Stop this ! » he pushed her away again.
" And… that we… " he couldn’t finish his sentence.
" Chicken! " he said, lying down again.
« What are you getting at? »
All of a sudden, Dean felt everyone was looking at him. He glanced at the queue in front of the cash desks… He saw the smiles… the pokes…
They had helped Castiel load his luggage in the car and now they were looking at him, putting on his winter coat in a deadly silence. He spoke first.
« He’s a man»
« We should come here more often, Jewel’s right. »
Castiel put his hand on his own erection, yet did nothing to relieve the tension, the pain would wither and disappear as his lover was gradually falling asleep.
"How can anyone be so blind, it's beyond me," he sighs.
"About 20 years ago, when we were still traveling with Dad, I saw you with... with that boy... It was an accident, you weren't supposed to be there... Or me for that matter.... I must admit that at the time, it was quite a shock,... My brother's Casanova in the arms of another man, there was something to be surprised about", with a clumsy smile.
« Look at Dad’s face » Chadwick was laughing too.
" I care about him "
The irremediable loss…
"You know, i like to think i'm his friend just like you and I are with Jody, Claire, Donna, just like we were with Ash, Ellen and all the others. But the bond you share, it...it's not the same, Dean, do you even realize that ? "
« True ! After all, I’m Batman » Dean said in a mocking tone.
« Screw you » he pushed his chair back, intending to stand up.
" Seven hours on the road, it helps...Trust me."
« No... That was probably Cass. Sounds like him all right » he replied, tenderly tousling his son’s hair.
He saw the same sadness he had seen on his face when they were in the car.
This house, a silent witness to the fact…
" Jewel thought it was great " Chadwick mocked. " I didn’t find this… great " he repeated with a bit of sarcasm emphasizing the last word.
Dressed in black pants, white shirt with the first button undone, short black leather jacket, needless to say that Castiel was creating a sensation.
« Good evening » He felt relieved as he recognized two of the people he had seen in the afternoon.
« Yes, I think it’s beautiful... C’mon…Sally is impatient to introduce you to your adoptive protégée» he said as he stood up with difficulty.
« I’m sure you understood me perfectly »
« Tell him what, Lisa ? How many times do I have to tell you that I don’t love him » Dean’s eyes were pleading.
He looked at Castiel, bare-chested and suddenly he wanted him, he needed to feel his body next to his and it hurt so much. He was afraid to let go...
Just silence.
« I did… They are very pretty» he sat on a stool and tried to take off his boots.
« Yes, I have»
He put down Jewel and turned to her.
« I’m so sorry »
Bryan walked out of the kitchen, as he felt it was better to leave the two of them alone, knowing Dean wouldn’t confess in front of a stranger. Dean let out a heavy sigh, wanting to free himself of what was on his mind.
« Cass » He kneeled before him.
« Assbutt »
Castiel watched him, standing straight at the top of the hill.
“And I don’t live alone,” Dean added tit for tat, lowering his gaze.
It took him more than a year before he ended up in the arms of someone else, but it never was for more than a night or a couple of days... Castiel refused to become attached, Nathan’s shadow taking all the place.
« I’m all right » Dean said with a smile « Sit down. I’ll pour you some coffee » Dean walked away, letting his hand slide down Castiel’s back.
« Castiel!... Castiel!... Help me! »
Ashamed of what he was. Devasted by the image of the broken hero he offers his brother.
« Why do you ask? » There was some surprise on Dean’s face as he chewed the first bite.
« Balty » he stood up and walked towards him.
“Bobby!”
Dean couldn’t help but shiver again when he felt the warmth of the other body abandon him.
« So, we have…» he started, pointing at the dishes, one by one,« scalloped potatoes, green beans with bacon, dried tomato salad and this…» he leaned over to examine the weird plate.
« You’re asking so gently » he pushed him against the wall, a hand on his crotch.
« There lies all the difference. My father never forgave me for the choice I made »
Castiel slowly pulled his t-shirt above his head and abandoned it with a smile… trying to reassure him as a mother would reassure a child.
« AND WHAT SHOULD I TELL HIM? » he reached out as if to beg for a solution.
How could he explain he was so difficult to admit that part of him.
« Dean? » She took a look in the bathroom.
As he swallowed the last bite of his fried chicken, he discretely looked at the people around the table. Jo was teasing Chadwick about his dance class girlfriend… Bobby was laughing at Balty’s nonsense.
« They will never agree to that »
« Sit down and let me do this»
"You looks like shit ! ", trying to play down a situation he doesn't know the ins and outs yet.
« I gotta go » He kissed Jewel and said goodbye to Megan.
" Yeah… We are a family and I love him too " Chadwick granted his father a last smile and walked out of the kitchen.
The highlight of the show was the hood covering his head, properly equipped with big ears on each side.
And you're not there. You may be just a footprint of ash ... and it kills me not to know ...
" Cass ! " Dean shouted.
Would he accept to help him anyway ? Besides, what was he supposed to tell him ?
« I can’t... It’s physical… I… I’m sorry, Cass »
« What was this about ? » Dean finally uttered.
The reflection of the flames were shining in his eyes.

Jewel approached and pushed the start button, Dean and Castiel trying in vain to keep up.
« It’s complicated » he sat down too.
« It’s not complicated between us… It’s just us» Castiel corrected. « Us, nothing but us » he brushed very soft kisses on his lips.
« Forget it, it’s VERY frustrating, but it’s OK. What do you mean by obvious ? » She rearranged the band holding her pony tail.
« She said she can’t. »
« I observed you this morning… You’re quite a rider » Garth finally complimented Castiel.
Dean smiled... A huge bone which the dog immediately ran away with to the kitchen.
He smiled as he remembered… Tessa had really started something.
" You take care of the laundry… I’ll take care of Apache "
"Okay" he just says and he feels the angel's lips on his neck. His hair tickles his cheek and for the first time in years, Dean dares to surrender.
« OK. » Castiel suddenly said.
Cass had promised he wouldn’t ever tell him he loved him again, yet this was the most beautiful love declaration of all.
"I gotta hang up... Yeah... I promise... Me too... Say hi to Bobby and Ellen for me... Bye," Dean says, hastily hanging up.
Halloween night was about to begin.
She was well aware of Chadwick and Jewel’s existence.
Dean crouched next to Castiel who was still moving although he seemed rather dazed.
Dean was ranting as he painfully carried the old shabby scarecrow back from the cellar... He pitched it in the little green spot that was supposed to be an alley and hung the skull-and-crossbones knocker on the door...
He trotted with his children.
« If she refuses that you attend the festival, nobody will. As of tomorrow, I’ll look for another dance class for Jewel. Who does she think she is…that bitch ? She perfectly knows how much you mean to us. »
« Oh look, Castiel, he loves you already»
Sam who saw his brother’s eyes and the sudden urge to erase the sadness that the angel has been in his blue oceans since the first day.
« Yes ? »
« I think you’re very handsome » a little voice said in his back.
Dean's 12. Charming, funny guy, a bit cunning, with a desarming smile. Contrary to what his attitude might suggest, Dean is a good student.
« Yes » she nodded, pawing the ground.
"Jerk ", with tenderness. " You should have to talk to me... You should've told him... we wouldn't be here today."
Dean put his back on the table.
“Jewel!” Her brother was now staring daggers at her.
He finally sat down with a big smile on his face.
“He was human.”
"Did Sam call you? "
He woke startled, it was a sign, he was sure of it… He took the impala and crossed the border.
« Don’t be sorry… I’m happy for you, Dean. And one more thing » she said, leaving the room
« Our rodeo horses are famous all around, but we had to diversify our business to make ends meet »
She used her apron and, with application, she spread out butter on his nose, trying to get rid of the flour.
« It’s an interactive robot dog I offered her for Christmas» Dean explained, looking at the ceiling.
« The young lady over there staring at you with puppy-dog eyes is Jewel »
« Oh no, Jewel... Not this one!» Dean looked upset.
« Yeah, but this time, we’re talking about their own father… and me»
" Yeah, I saw that "
« No, I bit myself while eating...Hence… » She showed her unfinished meal.
« C’mon Jewel. Let’s go watch the Simpsons» there was a sad smile on Chadwick’s face.
She was laughing so hard, trying to get her foot on the yellow mark that the dog, intrigued by all this noise, joined the party.
« Chicken » he repeated under the amused eyes of his children who seemed happy to taste a little of every single plate.
« Give me a chance» Zeke approached Castiel until their lips almost touched.
He was his father’s son all right, Jo thought as she watched him taking care of the little girl. He wouldn’t say anything but she has observed his expression when she had asked Jewel; the answer was painted on his face. The children were well aware, way before their father.
Castiel is his only exception. Anyway, since the notion was completely abstract to his friend, Dean didn't really have a choice.
« I love Castiel, so much, but it has nothing to do with the way I love you. My life is with you, my future is with you… I love YOU, you know that, don’t you? » He insisted as Bryan hadn’t said a word.
He rested his arms on the shovel. It wasn’t a real kiss, he thought, trying to convince himself... It had just been dictated by the fear of losing him and a way – not that smart, to say the least – to offer him a piece of that dream Castiel had been waiting for during the last ten years.
« What would you be sorry for ? »
« Madi »
Hell would never walk on Earth again… His new master would see to it…
« I don’t believe it. I’m sure of it, and I’m not the only one who feels the same way here... »
That evening, Dean revealed another side of his personality, unknown until then. He was the greatest coward of the universe, at least, in his universe that much was certain.
The main reason – or at least one of reasons - why he had called Balty was that the man was bi and as far as he could remember, Balty had first been straight before, and besides, he knew Castiel intimately.
« Do you wanna talk to the kids ? Yeah, you too… Good night » he smiled.« I wouldn’t dare… OK, bye… I put you through to Jewel » the impatient little girl was pulling his pants leg.
Chadwick nodded.
Dean leaned and read the title.
« The more, the merrier »
He even thought of tampering the Impala’s engine to force them to stay until everything was said and done...
All of a sudden, everything was much more easier and he regretted to have kept it secret for so long. Then he thought about what to say to their relatives and friends. How could he announce he was in a relationship with a man ? Especially Castiel...
« What truth? » his voice was nothing more but a faint whisper. « He knows the truth. I suspect he’s known for a long time ».
« I love you too, Dad, I love you a thousand times more » Jewel said, putting her arms around his neck and kissing him.
Castiel couldn’t help but laugh as he watched Dean bouncing and making faces probably because of the pain caused by bouncing up and down on his butt.
"No, but do you realize what you're saying ? ", uneasily.
Zeke looked down and walked out the door. Lisa felt her heart twist and it hurt like hell.
He wrote a few words and put it back in his pocket… He wouldn’t answer again tonight…
Indubitably, only the grown-ups were making things a lot more complicated than they actually were.
« So it’s true !» Dean was surprised. « I thought this was history ? »
« All right » she closed the door and ran down the stairs.
« I couldn’t find the box » she said, lowering her eyes.
« Give yourself to him… For once, Dean, try to be the passive one. Let go. Believe my long experience » he managed to make Dean smile a little. « Of all the men who could cross you path, you got the best. Don’t you lose him, because you could lose your greatest love story» he put his hand on his arm. « You gave your love to Tessa. Now give your love to Castiel. The three of you were meant to meet »
« I knew you’d like it... No hard feelings ? »
His health prevails over all the rest, I ask you a little patience. (and for that, there'll be a bonus surprise in the end of this story )
Dean inspires deeply, dreading this January 24th.
Is there a future for us ?
"Those were the two longest damn days of my short life, man," as he stepped aside to face him.
“What d’you want me to do?” He turned in his seat to face his brother.
« So? » she was insisting.
« Go home… I’ll join you later on. Could you take care of the kids for a few hours?»
« We’ll have to wait for too long until then » she pouted.
« Dean » he let out in a whisper, closing his eyes and lowering his chin.
" What’s so complicated ? " the boy went on, frowning. Castiel was listening to the conversation, with a little smile on his face. Chadwick was the stubborn kind and obviously hurt by the silences. All he wanted was answers to simple questions, even if he had to push his father to the limit and make him face his own doubts.
He turned to Castiel who was standing in front of the painting, arms crossed and head tilted.
« Hello... Please excuse my poor outfit, I came straight from a party organized by my godfather, I should say my mentor... » He extended a hand towards Dean « I don’t usually dress up as Edward » He smiled although it seemed obvious he was feeling uncomfortable.
« Cassie ? »
« OK then… I’ll go get some caffeine supplies. »
“Apparently not.” Castiel said with a sad smile.
« About last night » he started, rubbing the back of his head.
« A little bit more, Jewel… there… that’s better. »
« Dad isn’t there ? » Jewel was a bit surprised.
" Are you mad at him ? " Chadwick asked. Castiel didn’t answer. " He loves you very much, you know "
« Why ? » Castiel repeated already, disappointed by the answer that he was about to say. « Because he was nothing but a rich spoil brat… a handsome and smart one… because he always got what he asked for, because he always succeeded in everything he undertook, because he thought you can buy anything… He offered me a car, and then holidays at the end of the world… The moment I looked at something in a shop window, he would buy it for me... I ended up refusing all his gifts, which made him mad. I wasn’t happy. He was unable to understand that I didn’t give a shit about his money. All I wanted was him »
" Shit! " Castiel grumbled, taking off with his feet.
Castiel complied, looking into the empty eyes of his pumpkin.
" Already ? "
The young man complied, looking at Jo in search of some silent support.
He smiled for himself and thought he’d never trade place with anyone for anything. He had his share of bad luck. His father was never there for him. His mother had died too soon. And his beloved Tessa…
"I saw how everyone was staring at us ... Dean. I… I… I don’t wanna be an obstacle for you."
« I’ve already explained it, Pumpkin. Santa can’t be everywhere at once in just one night. Even if the elves are helping... »
« I’m here » he called from the kitchen.
"Insomnia ... So ..." he makes a vague gesture towards Castiel.
Weeks went by and Apache settled in the family. Every Saturday, after their swimming and dancing classes, the kids and Dean – as well as Castiel when he was free - would go to the canine education center. Apache was learning to obey… when it pleased him !
Apache welcomed them with a lot of licking and yapping. Castiel walked straight to the kitchen with Jewel on his tail.
« Together,… well sort of » Dean scowled. « Castiel seems to be happy for him and Balty remains a member of our big family, that doesn’t change anything»
I would like to thank all the readers (in the shadow or the light) for taking the time to read my fic.
« Would you please set the table while I start cooking ? » he grabbed the eggs, the butter and the cheese.
« I got it.. let’s go » he stood up, shivering all over.
" ARE YOU READY ? " Chadwick shouted to the men.
Castiel stepped back a little, surprised by the harsh tone of the boy’s voice.
« Come with me. There are 4 of them. You may choose one »
« A kiss shared in a moment of despair isn’t enough for me anymore… It’s just not enough, Dean »
Some angst in this chapter but don't worry, everything gonna be alright.
He knew Castiel was standing behind him, waiting, and when he felt the man was about to walk away, he turned around and grabbed his wrist.
« I told you to wake me up last night to take over... » Dean gently scolded him.
« Here you are ! You’ve been gone for ages. Where have you been ? »
Ash grew pale.
Dean held her tight against her and kissed her. Apache sat between Castiel’s legs, waving his tail in contentment.
When he pulled in front of the school, Chadwick looked at Castiel.
So, Castiel proposed to turn the little princess into a zombie...
« If you need some help, you can count on me… I love oldies and challenges»
« So, who is this guy? » she asked pointing at the man walking in front of the parade, held by two elves who struggled to keep him on the right path.
At most, he was allowed to go for a trick-or-treat tour with his class comrades, under his mother’s severe supervision...
« Put this on... »
He took his car keys out of his pocket and headed for the alley where he had parked his car.
Castiel came back at that exact moment. He remained frozen, with his mouth open, unable to ask Dean where he had put the bottle of red wine.
« Balty, you can skip the details » Dean corrected. « You could have at least talked to me about this before spreading the news. » he went on, unable to hide a slight irritation.
When Castiel joined him, Dean was clinging to the pommel, trying not to fall, shaken like a plain bag on the saddle.
He folded the card back and closed his eyes, savoring the words of the man who had been his beacon for the last ten years.
He bit his tongue.
Jewel started to laugh.
« Is it that hard to say ?» Balty smiled a sad smile. « Because your silence is more eloquent than words, you know»
“I’m sorry, so sorry… Cas, forgive me” He picked him up and made his way to the door.
« I don’t wanna hear ONE word !» Dean said in a quiet voice, threatening them with the giant plastic honey pot he was holding.
« Not that… just that you were in love with him » Balty played with his cup. « You weren’t ready yet… I had forgotten how much she had meant for you… Castiel has told me but… I so wanted him to be happy. He means so much to me »
" No, you're perfect ... It's not that ", he answers, by waddling. " Really sorry ".
« So where is that caterer of yours, huh? » Bobby muttered, looking at his watch.
Balty seemed to turn prematurely senile in front of the dog and adopted a peculiar language in front of him.
« Actually, I’m sure of it » she looked him in the eyes. Her eyes were sparkling.
" Hello Gorgeous" stroking her neck .
« Well, to be honest, I’m speechless » Franck confessed, feeling a bit perlexed. « It sounds rather… weird» he scratched his head.
« Enjoy your Sunday »
« Yeah… sure » she crossed her arms on her chest.
« Dean » He felt the gentle touch of Jo’s hand on his shoulder.
« CAAAAAASS » Dean shouted as his horse passed by and galloped in front of him.
“But Dean, what about Erael? She’s killing innocents.”
« I think we all thought the same » Balty said, more seriously than ever.
Castiel wiped the very first tears away before they ran down his cheeks.
« Don’t mention it… I knew you’d love it. »
The afternoon went by, Dean’s enthusiasm came back, motivated by the enthusiasm of the children ... Castiel came closer. As they left the shoe store, it seemed as if none of this had ever happened.
"Frank? "
She huddled up to him a bit more. Here he was, Dean Winchester telling her he loved her. She had heard those words so rarely, even though he had a way to tell by just looking at her...
« It looks like he completely recovered from… well, the … » Bobby turned his cups several time in his hands.
"Happy New Year, Dean".
" 10 years of solitary pleasure, talk about blessing!" she raised an eyebrow.
Not that he was homophobic, he hadn’t really even thought about it…
« Dammit, man, it’s my bed » he said, leaning on him. Castiel was fast asleep.
« This and the fact that you have a hard-on when you think of him and no longer for chicks, I think it’s pretty clear to me »
Sam joins him.
« Take the soft ball in the tent » Chadwick shouted.
« What about yesterday ? » Dean wondered where Castiel was getting at.
« Dammit ! He’s a lot more fuckable today » Castiel whispered, leaning to grab a handful of popcorn in the bowl Dean was refusing to share.
When he returned, Dean had prepared a little snack.
The spirit of Christmas was here again and Dean didn’t feel sad, as he usually did.
« I’d better take a shower to get rid of it all» he smiled, trying to hide the turmoil sneaking in his heart.
« Do you really wanna build a snowman ? » Chadwick asked, somewhat amused.
« I must say it’s a rather brave attitude » Dean stated, turning his beer bottle between his fingers.
« Where is he ? » Jewel asked, casually stroking Apache.
Dean’s face went pale and his expression hardened.
I pissed you off the whole meal just for the pleasure of seeing your impassive face suddenly hide from misunderstanding.
Probably because of you watching me via the reflection of the window while you pretended to look out the landscape go by.
« This young lady monopolized the discussion with Castiel and her brother isn’t happy about it »
“Don’t be jealous, honey... I just wanted to feast my eyes... That guy isn’t even gay, it’s obvious... You’ve got nothing to fear,” he said, winking at him.
Garth approached him and shook his hand a bit longer.
The tension is dropping as fast as it has risen and Sam doesn't seem to know what to do with his big carcass anymore.
Dean smiled in return, yet he felt a twinge of sorrow.
Dean walked behind the counter.
Bobby watched them leave… he raised his eyes to the skies … and smiled.
« Nobody likes it, Jewel, but he’s got to visit his mom » her brother said, putting an arm around her shoulders.
It's the Easter holidays. Unlike other years, the Winchesters don't go to the Singers. John has decided to close the garage for a week to spend some time with his boys.
«Are you happy ? »
All that time, Meg remains faithful to her unicorn. Yet she knows Clarence will never be his. She knows the nature of his doubts and torments. She knows who his unicorn is, even though this one refuses to see the obviousness, hanging around a Cassie who has become the only person allowed to break his personal space.
“You are feeling the pain I felt when he annihilated my family… I did nothing but apply divine justice.”
Dean nodded and headed to the kitchen. Castiel threw his bag on his shoulder and glanced one more time at the tents on the floor.
His eyes sparkled as he had been waiting for this moment forever and Dean knew it was problably the case.
« I beg your pardon ? ».
« If something happens to me… you know ? I’d like you to have custody of the kids » he said, staring at the floor.
« What ? » he asked, feeling his gaze upon his back.
« We could go there all together, as we used to » Chadwick said, looking at his empty plate.
His eyes met with Jo’s and they shared a smile.
« JEWEL » Chadwick called out loud. Their father was back, meaning they could finally eat.
« I like this » Dean whispered. « I like being with him but I feel like… » Dean leaned on the counter, obviously lost. « You’re the only one I can talk to about this. I’m so sorry to bother you with my feelings, but I don’t wanna lose him, you know....» he squeezed the counter border. « I never thought it would screw my head after the first step… but I realize that… that I’m gonna have to … If only I could refrain from overthinking all the time » he violently hit the counter with both hands.
He dropped the trench-coat and the jacket, untied his tie. He rolled up his shirt sleeves, absentmindedly, absorbed in his reading. His long fingers underline the sentences at an insolent speed for the common man but who seems to frustrate him because too slow. He frowns, moistens his dry lips.
« NEVER »
He tried summoning again and again no one came until a young girl appeared.
« This is from Chadwick and me… Well, more from Chadwick, because I don’t have enough money, so I made you a drawing»
Lisa’s words were hitting back like a boomerang...
He turned to Chadwick and showed a threatening finger covered with the sticky substance...
« Dammit, Balty » he raised his eyes to the ceiling.
« How did it happen? » she sounded genuinely perplexed.
« Tessa »
« OK Boss » Mark said, putting his foot on the first barrier.
Castiel raised on one elbow and leaned forward.
At night, when the children were sleeping, he loved to tell tales of his encounters in every detail over a last drink…
He was surprised to find Jo already up. She was sitting on a chair with a leg folded under her, looking at nothing over her coffee cup.
Several years ago, he had accepted to go camping with her on the West Coast, in one of those big national parks that so favored. She had been a den mother in her youth. Dean hated nature. But he loved Tessa.
« Bobby? » Balty was surprised by Bobby’s reaction.
« I finally tamed you, my beautiful stallion... Why would Castiel fail to do the same with Dean ? »
« What time is it now? » Dean mumbled, looking at the clock on the wall. 11h45. Madison should be there any minute. As well as Cass »
« You have reached Dean Winchester’s voice mail. I’m not available for the moment. Just leave a message and your coordinates and I’ll get back to you as soon as possible »
He doesn't want him to see.
Castiel turns to face Dean.
He suddenly felt a pressure on his arm, he startled and raised his eyes. Bobby had arrived, Bobby was here with him!
« I’m aware of that, Cass... But that doesn’t mean you gotta take it with you everywhere you go. » Dean whispered in a sweet voice as he walked closer to Castiel.
“How much?”
Castiel hesitates, then moves closer, finally pulls a chair and sits down.
He smiles, sheepishly, and get out of the room.
Dean steps back.
" Yeaaaaaah " she was jiggling against her father.
Chadwick turned to his sister and shared a smile...
« Dammit, Apache !» he shouted as he swam back to the land.
He drops his bottle between his knees, fixes the ground so as not to fix him.
Jewel cried. Chadwick and his father weren’t feeling good either.
“The scent of death… You still smell it… It chases you… It will always be there… You abandoned him?”
« Err… yeah… sure » he looked surprised.
The children quickly got tired of the pool and started to stick with Pedro, the groom who accepted their help for the daily routines: maintaining the watering places, cleaning the loose-boxes, giving the horses a rub-down, maintaining the material.
« Cass » he said in a faint whisper.
« So I’ve heard that you’d like to adopt a little male, right? » Ella smiled.
“Where is she?”
All the ingredients were set on the table. Jewel was all smiles, and Castiel wasn’t smiling at all.
« A little word of encouragement and keep your knees squeezed to make it walk»
Then I wanted to point out that the next chapter will be posted in three weeks instead of two.
And all this time, Apache was running from one to the other in search of patting, shyly proposing his tennis ball.
« I’m not hungry »
« Nothing. Go to sleep.... Tomorrow is another busy day »
The water was indeed rather cold.
« But you’re their father!»
His gaze wanders to the hallway leading to the rooms. Thoughts and desires collide in a dark muddle.
« Your turn, Castiel » Garth encouraged.
With his head back on the shower wall, Dean leaned into the waves of pleasure, giving a damn if anyone could hear. He didn’t give a damn that a man kneeling between his thighs.
« Thanks, man » holding tight and refraining from moving an inch.
He then turned to the dog
« But we already have one » Jewel snapped back, as she thought of Bobby. She started to pout.
Castiel pulled away after a few minutes.
« It must be awesome to herd the cattle » There was a blissful smile on Dean’s face.
Bobby wasn’t actually their uncle. Jo was Dean’s half-sister. Dean’s mother, Mary, had remarried Bobby’s nephew, Mark, who at that time already had a little girl, Jo.
« Are you aware of the impact of what you’ve just said?» he asked in a broken voice.
« Some kind of family, huh ? »
« Fatigue has a weird effect on me » Castiel smiled.
Chadwick cosplayed a Walking Dead character. Castiel had given him a fake bite that was covering half of his right cheek and had smeared on fake blood on his face and clothes...
They left their luggage in the lobby. Dean started to take his jacket off when he saw Jo walking to him.
I hope you will enjoy this final. I have a lot of affection for this fic, this stepfamily family has become over the words, a little bit mine. I hope it will be the same for you.
He gently stroke her hair.
« He still needs to learn some manners, but I’m properly equipped » he went on with a large smile, taking the whip from his belt.
« And very modest, to say the least » Castiel smiled in turn. « So for Wednesday, may I tell him it’s ok ? »
Balty rose on one elbow.
« Deannnnnn » she rushed and put her arms around his neck.
He looked through the window... Nothing’s changed. A little white lie which nobody believed anymore...
" Cass... It’s not that I don’t want to… It’s just that… I don’t know what to do or how, right now. "
He crushed the slightly damaged edge with the end of his index.
« Castiel…come and have a look »
« C’mon. The children are waiting for you» Jo put an arm around his waist and held him tight for a few seconds.
« I’m gonna visit a widow who’s done grieving : she’ got a splendid villa with a heated swimming pool. I love to make love in lukewarm water» he laughed when Castiel had called him.
Dean lay on his back, staring at the ceiling.
« Every time I approach it, it recedes » he grieved.
He felt so lost and at the same time so sure of what he wanted...
« That should do it, pumpkin …they said 2 tablespoons… »
" Chad, why don’t you tell me what you really feel about this... " Dean was leaning on his knees, looking down, expecting the final verdict... possibly a denial that would put an end to his illusions. Because if his relationship with Castiel, as clumsy as it was, was likely to endanger the well-being of his kids, he would for sure put an end to it, however it might hurt. He also knew that Castiel would agree, as he had confirmed several times.
" For me?” she asked with sparkles in her eyes.
Balty looked down.
Eventually, he started to relax, softly rocked by the silence of the place which was filled with only bird melodies.
He opened the door, yawning extensively, took off his clothes, keeping his boxer shorts only and slipped between the sheets.
" Cass...Cass "
« Are you so afraid of what would happen? » he softly caressed his lips with his thumb.
He smiled.
Damn Cass ... I love you so much .
" I’d like to point out that I don’t feel like sleeping with all my friends " Dean laughed in turn.
Zeke stared at the empty armchair.
« I hope it’ll be better than last time » he claimed, giving a suspicious glance at the food preparations.
« He’s got a sharp ear too… You’d better be careful » Dean said, shrugging his shoulders and finishing his beer.
Dean entered their room and let out a long sigh as he collapsed on his bed.
« No, I’m not. We split the tasks at the office. He’s gonna do his best to work a little at home, but this flu fever doesn’t help for sure »
« You’re so old-fashioned» Jo teased him.
He has aged.
A caress to Apache, a last smile to Dean.
He understood, right this moment, that he would love Dean forever and nothing would ever change that. He had that kind of immune disease that’s eating you up from the inside and eventually kills you.
It took them quite a while to say their final goodbyes. Jewel hugged each of the four men, Chadwick thanked them again and again.
« Dunno » Castiel was visibly irritated « Listen, Zeke, go home. We’ll talk about this tomorrow, ok ?»
« I am, Franck » Dean immediately answered, surprised by the rapidity of his reaction.
The seconds stretched as if they were hours.
Bobby had to try four times before Castiel finally accepted his invitation.
« Shit, my ass hurts » he said, holding his butt.
It was an ordinary attic. One window stained with years of dust, spider webs, dust, boxes and luggage filled with memories from their childhood and adult lives.
Jewel was the first participant to run... Dean leaned on the fence and waved his hat with energy... Jewel trotted around the barrels, her mare seemed to master the circuit.
He started to tickle her and suddenly their eyes met. His smile vanished at once.
He put a coffee spoon in what was left of the melange Jewel had poured in the mixture.
« I need to sleep » he said, walking upstairs to his bedroom.
« As you wish » he replied, finishing his beer.
« Are you OK, Cass ?» Dean was laughing, although he felt a bit ashamed by the turn of events.
« Now, c’mon, sweetie. Let’s go talk to Madame Fournier, shall we? » He tried to keep his voice extremely low to calm down Jewel while he felt the pain crawling into his own heart.
Chadwick raised and howled. Jewel almost fell from the bed and screamed. As a matter of fact, it was a mixture of scream and laughter.
« No need for one. I’m still your father, as far as I know. And I said no. Now, move on, get your stuff or you’re gonna be late for school.»
« Children are often right » Castiel said as he closed his flask.
« Pleased to meet you… Madi told me so much about you » the man said with sparkling eyes, looking at Dean then Castiel, as he extended a hand.
Vin spent the rest of the afternoon with them. Then he reluctantly said his goodbyes, as he had to go and visit his parents. Jo guided him to her room so that he could change before leaving.
Bobby gently patted him in the back.
"Hey," Dean cuts him off, raising the angel's chin with a fingertip." Give me some time ", with a soft faded smile.
« I don’t agree.» Castiel was now petrified.
« Let’s go, little monsters »
« What do you mean? » Dean smiled as Castiel opened his eyes.
"I don't want to disappoint you, Mr. Winchester, but I prefer my lover with more breasts and fewer balls," as he swallows his slice of pie.
“Dean.” He stood.
Dean watched him go upstairs... He remembered the dark look on his face when Balty had mentioned his past horse-riding classes… He hadn’t practiced for ten years, but it was easy to guess that it was related to the period he was living in New York and consequently, the years he was living with that companion he had always refused to talk about.
« No » He said eventually, with a final smile. He let out a sigh.
" C’mon ... .We still has 3 more rooms to visit and obviously your son looks as lost as you are as regards modern art "
Castiel remained motionless then let go of Dean’s hand and pulled up his boxer shorts and his pants as he leaned towards Dean’s face.
« What do you want ? » Castiel stepped back a few steps, looking around for help, but the alley was otherwise deserted.
« I can love you for who you really are »
« Yeah, right » the boy smiled at Castiel, exhibiting the camera in his hands.
« The advantage with Castiel is he don’t need condom… he never had another lover besides me when we were together » a content smile spread on his lips.
Damn Cass, it's raining.
"Next time, I’ll take care of Chad and you take care of the little one" Castiel replied, throwing the pile of clothes on a chair.
End of chapter
« Are you OK ? » Castiel was worried now.
« Madison! » Castiel almost shouted.
It is...
Castiel put a finger on his lips to silence him.
« Balty » Bryan seemed to take offense.
" I don’t have any, you silly. He’s gonna pee on your christmas tree " he slammed the door shut.
The next holidays became their favorite subject in the days that follow.
Both children looked at him with anger.
« I present you the real Wink » he pointed at the old man walking out of the stable.
Castiel heard the panicked cry, turned his head to look around and lost control over his own sled, sliding on its side.
" You know me " Dean confessed with a muffled giggle.
«I thought you knew how to ride horses ».
« Oh really? Well, good girl!» Bobby replied ironically.
« Like an uncle, right » Castiel repeated as his eyes went from one kid to the other.
« No way » Chadwick answered, looking deep into his eyes.
« Castiel? »
« No Bobby. »
Castiel closes his eyes..
He took off his jacket and smiled to the cries of the children, surprised by the dog.
He and his father hardly speak to each other anymore except to exchange commonplace things. Most of the time, they meet like two ghosts haunting the same walls.
« Would you mind giving me your telephone number? I’d like to keep in touch »
« We’re ready, Castiel » Jewel shouted from the living room.
« That’s it, laugh it up! ».
Castiel raised his head and look into her eyes.
« Listen, Cass... I gotta be honest with you »
« I know, Pa’»
« What ? » he stared at his son.
« He will never love you » Zeke kept repeating. « You treasure your dreams rather than real life... You’re pathetic. Look at you !» Zeke looked at him up and down. « You keep hoping for more all the time. I’m sure that you’d still believe in him even if he kicked you out of his life. That guy sucked the marrow out of you. »
Dean suddenly felt a big lump in his throat.
Castiel's staring at a stain on the table.
« No. Why d’you ask ? »
« Cass...We need to go now...» Zeke called. Dean winced when he heard the nickname.
Castiel didn’t reply, not knowing how to interpret Dean’s response...
When Jewel was done, he took the dough which was stuck on the table and put it as a top on the mold …Then he pinched the edges to weld them together.
The children stood up without another word.
« Let’s do this then »
" Do you love him? " Chadwick asked at last.
"Good idea," Dean stated as he walked away, a bit pissed.
Dean pouted... The beer was too warm.
"I love you too... but... I don't have your courage... he's my dad, Cass."
She had finally told him she loved him. He had felt overwhelmed as well as scared because he was unable to tell her the same… Only Tessa had heard these words from him.
Mark had been watching them for a while. He smiled and pulled his hat on his forehead.
« Did you hear what your brother said ?» he was looking for some support to his convictions.
« You fucked her » Castiel finished with a bitter tone.
Dean looked at Castiel and smiled.
"That old man was right," John approves with a sad grin. "Most of them have been living proof of that for more than a decade... I have some apologies to make to you, son, and to your brother... But more than that, I had some to make to
« About yesterday »
He took a deep breath, trying to chose the most appropriate words to say.
Hope to see you in two weeks.
« Great! » the boy smiled.
It is raining and I would like all this rain to wash me, purify me.
"On this... I'm expected. ",Castiel adds turning his back and walking away.
He had given her an apron that reached down her ankles. He tied it high behind her neck in an clumsy attempt to make it fit.
« Have you heard that, Jewel ? That was THE ultimate reference» he said, gently poking her.
They called each other every day, unable to stand more than twenty-four hours without hearing each other. Wasn’t it love too?
« Yet I should be the one to thank you for letting me be part of your family in the first place. »
« He will finally be able to move on »
« Why do you think I’m feeling like horseshit ? » he said, suddenly standing up. « How do you want me to tell him? »
Castiel hadn’t moved an inch. Nor Balty, who seemed to hesitate between uttering a sarcastic remark and keeping his mouth shut, to respect his lover’s silent attitude.
She then turned to him.
« What? » Castiel asked, raising the lid of the corn casserole to prevent water from overflowing.
He took a run-up and jumped in the water, his body curled up in a ball.
Dean didn’t say a word. He just nodded and quickly walked away.
Sam and his nightmares.
Castiel felt it would be wise to take it to his place, to avoid Dean finding it. They opened all the windows and the back door to ventilate the house.
Bryan had stepped aside, sipping his beer and petting Apache’s head. He met his lover’s eyes and winked. The latter winked back.
« A teacher of mine used to say that any person has been granted intelligence and that beauty is just a matter of perspective» Dean stated in a casual tone as he observed the emaciated guy standing in front of them.
« Jewel.... You’re cheating. You have to jump » Dean shouted, sweating and jumping like an idiot.
« Hi Dad » Chadwick replied, taking a bite in his slice of pie.
« No...Of course not, Chad… I’m just a little sad » he tried to smile.
« Ready for a little race ? » Castiel proposed with a smile.
« Gotcha ! » Castiel whispered.
They had never exchanged Christmas gifts in his family. Christmas was supposed to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, son of God. No Christmas tree either, to his father claimed it was a pagan tradition. Just an enormous crib where Castiel had the right to put Baby Jesus at midnight.
In a glance, Castiel knew he wouldn’t be home for the night.
« It was even more fun than last year» she was skipping in joy.
He swiftly stepped back, ran to the door, grabbed his coat and bursted out.
« Yes, here » Dean snapped in a low voice, kneeling before Castiel. « Here and now...Because I may not have the courage and because… I want it, Cass ». Still staring at him in the eye, he detached his belt buckle and let his fingers slide along the zipper.
« What do you mean ? »
« We’re gonna make it, Son… Don’t worry »
He crumbled to his knees and began to cry.
He should have wanted to get up and flee… He knew too many women who could read your soul and then twist it but his own was already destroyed, it wouldn’t make a difference… All there was left was a sliver for his brother, everything else had now disappeared in a never ending gulf.
« I’m gonna make it clear, I won’t go any further than down the street this year » Dean said, tasting the soup with a satisfied click of the tongue.
Silence filled the room again...
Chadwick came out of the pool, grabbed his sister’s hand and dragged her inside.
« Tell him, Castiel. Tell him you don’t mind us having a dog. »
« Shall we go camping again, Daddy? » Jewel begged.
« I thought you were new in the neighborhood » he said, staring at the picture of a sunset on a desert.
« You’ll say goodbye next time... C’mon now… meal’s ready » Dean ordered, gently pushing her towards the kitchen.
Castiel leaned with both hands on the sink and tried to calm down. His heart hurt so much, he was gasping for air.
« See you soon, big boy » he briefly squeezed his shoulder.
« Dean » she stepped closer. « I’d like to ask you one question. You’re not obliged to answer ».
Their eyes met.
"Cass? ", Dean asks resting his bottle on the table.
While they were drowning the pancakes under a heavy layer of maple syrup, the children talked about the last Christmas they remembered at Bobby’s and recited their wish list.
Dean hadn’t said anything; just a few phone calls and all was in place, because it had to be, because the time had come.
« Hold it ! Be gentle with the merchandise... » Balty gently pushed him away, laughing.
It is with laughters, guidances and encouragements that Dean, blindfolded, tries to break the papier-mâché donkey with a broomstick.
Dean and Jo helped Bobby to wash the dishes, hitting each other with the towels while the kids were dancing again.
Castiel was leaning forward, his arms resting on his knees. Jewel observed him, intrigued. Chadwick stared a desperate look at Jo.
«Just relax… you’re so tense you’re gonna snap»
« When do we eat? » Jewel broke the link and Dean took the opportunity to regain his composure.
" I’m aware I’m asking you a lot, Son, and I’m sorry. It fell on me with no warning. I’d have preferred to fall in love with a woman. It would have been simpler for everyone. But it was a man " he laughed, perplexed." Besides, it had to be Cass.... "
Dean throws his cotton candy on the ground and immediately hugs him.
« Yep... »
To forget how stressed he felt, Dean went to the garage and started to work on two cars that had to be given back to their owners at reopening. Kevin was absent until Saturday, so the place was free to work.
« I’m sorry » Zeke apologized.
« A professor, dammit ! » he sighed. « He could’ve chosen a dumbass, with a pretty face, but of course, Mr. Castiel had to chose the intellectual type ! »
« Sit down and eat your breakfast, smart ass » Castiel retorted, pulling out a chair for him.
A trap for Castiel… An act of vengeance.
« What else… » Zeke laughed.
The ate in silence. The kids were exhausted and would surely go to bed soon. They actually barely touched their food.
“Will you stop with all those dammit? That’s annoying... No, wait, what’s annoying, actually,” she straightened up to face him, “... is you being that bloody macho man who didn’t even find the courage to ask him what his name was... Dean, magic stuff like that happens only once in a lifetime... You can’t miss that chance or you will regret it forever...”
"But..." Castiel says petrified
« Chad » Castiel’s voice was nothing but a whisper and he had to brake in a rush before the light turned red.
Of course he hoped to fall in love again but it hadn’t ended that well with Lisa, his last serious affair...
« As you wish »
« What are you thinking about? » he frowned.
« Cass ? » Dean put down his beer on the table and walked towards him.
« Lisa » he grabbed her hand and tried to pull her closer to kiss her. She allow that last contact. He felt her hand against his chest, but she was pushing him away. He could feel her perfume one last time.
wwwwwwwwwwwwww
« Daaaaaaaaaaaad ! » Jewel shouted, rushing in her father’s arms.
He hung up and looked at his puffy eyes.
« What about the peels ? » Chadwick threw « Dad will understand at once when he sees them»
« Yes… Hi»
Dean was counting the days with apprehension and impatience.
She was not him.
« If … if a woman… » he insisted on the last word.
« Er… Cass... a man who invites you to a restaurant has a precise idea in mind »
Castiel’s put one hand on Chadwick’s shoulder while he was holding the little hand of Jewel, playing hopscotch on the paving stones, trying to avoid the edges.
« No kidding » Dean went on with a happy voice.
Dean smiled when he left the house, making sure his son had taken his mobile. As for the rest, with Apache by his side, he wouldn’t risk anything.
Bobby gave Jewel a genuine fake diploma of the best godmother to Tessa as well as all the material she needed to care for her so-called goddaughter.
« But I don’t know how I can manage THAT, I have a job and I won’t have the time to take care of that little creature.»
You know me, this kind of emotion always shits, it's not really my thing. So I tightened the steering wheel and stepped on the accelerator.
" Yeah ?" Dean rubbed his face.
She only learned several months later that he had let his pain explode in front of Castiel...when they were sorting Tessa’s belongings in various boxes several weeks after she died. He had collapsed, holding a pj he used to hate. Castiel had walked closer and suddenly Dean had let go for good.
« Lisa and I broke up last night » he said in a whisper.
After those few months during which they had supported him in his mourning, his friends had decided to take things in hand.
« Anyone ? » Zeke’s eyes were asking for some explanation.
« Calmos, little girl » Dean ordered.
Yet, when Dean reached the point of no return, he stopped moving, leaving Kate in a state of frustration and grumbling against his lips.
A very familiar shadow.
" Chad, I’ve asked you to tell me the truth "
Metallica resonated between the walls, in an attempt to silence the wild thoughts rumbling in his head.
When his mother had given him back his friend, she had offered him the most precious gift: a family. The family she couldn’t promise herself.
"Why don’t you shut up?” Dean grumbled.
Dean turned around and again, he felt that uneasy feeling, because, dammit, that man was…
In the end, Castiel won with ... 15%
Castiel left the exhibition premiere around 6 p.m. : he had been bored all along and had shown up by sheer politeness. He thanked Greg and his wife for the invitation and said his goodbyes. Greg accompanied him to the exit.
"Say it like that, I swear i understand he's gone," Sam despairs, running a hand through his hair. "It didn't occur to you that he must have surprise by your offer ? "
« Why don’t you talk to me, Baby? » He said, taking him in his embrace.
« Hi » she blushed.
He heard someone opening the door at the same instant he saw the dog suddenly jump on his feet.
Hands in the pockets of his trench coat, Castiel steps forward and watches the fair. He feels an arm around his shoulders.
« You haven’t given up yet with this, right ? » Bryan closed his eyes, feeling annoyed.
"It means what it means," Sam stands up. "Call him."
He remembered Tessa’s face, even if the only souvenirs of her were now pictures and from time to time a forgotten dream… he was staring at nothing and saw her smile. Then he heard the echo of Castiel’s laugh in a deep warm voice.
Castiel, white shirt and rolled up sleeves, sprawled on an worned armchair looks to the other side of this trailer becoming his lair.
« Honestly? No » he said, raising an eyebrow.
« Look… Look, Jewel… Cows… Cows !».
Sometimes, he would feel brave enough to turn around and grant him a kiss on the lips with a smile.
" Because this is none of your business " Dean finally uttered in a neutral tone, looking daggers at his son. " And from now on, I’d appreciate you speak to me in a different tone, young man... I don’t wanna hear another word till the end of breakfast or I’ll get mad for good " he said, hitting the table with the palm of his hand, which made the cups and cutlery jingle all at once.
" What ? "
" OK, so what do you suggest ? "
« I’ll take care of it, I swear, cross my heart. »
Castiel meets Bobby's worried and apprehensive face. He lets himself be carried away by Dean without taking his eyes off the old man.
He feels his warmth, he hears his breathing, he dares not look at him. He doesn't want to break this moment between them, sharing of silence and unsaid
« What? » Castiel turned around, obviously surprised by Dean’s intervention.
"Here," grabbing his son's free hand and slipping a ring into it. "It was... your mother's... it's a little damaged... the fire...", suddenly seeming sobered by these memories so vivid in his mind.
"It was great" sighs a happy Sam leaning back against a pole. "Thank you", turning to his brother, biting into his candy apple.
That’s when he realized Dean hadn’t moved his head from his leg the whole evening.
Dean was rinsing the saucepans after starting the coffee machine for the nth time of the afternoon. He suddenly felt a hand force him to turn around before his lips were captured in a harsh kiss, his face trapped in Castiel’s hands.
« I love it» Chadwick claimed.
" Did you get some news from Castiel ? "
« It’s very good » she admitted, swallowing the rest in one gulp.
« Good morning, big boy... French toast this morning, is that all right? »
" Yes, Dad ? "
« Well… I guess so. They don’t explain how to do it … Anyway we don’t have a brush, so… let’s do it »
« Watch out, Jewel, or you’re gonna decorate the whole room. »
The kids had been begging for months, yet Dean had systematically refused to give in.
" Jared won’t miss boring Dean with his trucks…. He’s got that problem with a transformer or something like that"
« Would you care for a drink: beer, coffee, soft drink? »
“Your description isn’t very clear.”
« It’ll be my pleasure. »
« You should be ashamed of yourself… using children as human shields » he was showing a threatening finger.
Maybe tomorrow
He feels so alive…
« What’s happening between the two of you ? »
He looked at his reflection in the mirror, wearing a simple short, and imagined Castiel’s silhouette looking back at him.
First and foremost, thank you to read this story. Love you
"Nothing, Dean ... You're right, I'll talk to them ... If there are problems in the future, we’ll figure it out when the times comes, even if we have to modify a few habits of ours".
“Dammit... What the hell is happening to me?” He wondered as he let himself slip to the ground.
He was about to leave the kitchen when she called him back.
“DEAN!” He shouted from his study. “It’s for you... Pick up the outside line.”
He heard Dean giggle.
Jewel stood up and ran into Jo’s arms.
He felt Castiel slowly getting back on his feet and when he took his lips, he felt his own taste in the other’s mouth.
« What a mess » Castiel whispered.
They ate in silence, sharing looks and absent-minded smiles.
« Don’t worry » the boy soon disappeared around the corner of the street.
Castiel had taken all the initiatives although never crossing a certain limit… He somehow knew Dean wasn’t totally ready for it yet.
" I thought you understood "
« My Baby… » he said as he took a closer look at the plastic box protecting the car. « She’s magnificent »
He had filled them with a chocolate bar which would melt in hot milk.
« Why is that? » Dean was surprised.
They laughed, they talked, they exchanged a few serious ideas.
« I’m sorry if my attitude made you believe that my feelings for you were beyond friendship »
« I guess so » he laughed.
She patiently waited until Inias finished cleaning up their table and sighed.
« Isn’t that your prom vest? » Bobby noticed.
Dean spent all morning at the garage, dealing with administrative paperwork. He hated this but somehow he had to take care of it as his accountant was to visit him at the end of the week and everything had to be clean.
She stood and left the bar without looking back… By the time Dean realised it, he stood and made to follow her… He opened the door to find nothing… The road and nothing else…
However, it was far from final… Wink stepped aside as soon as it felt Dean’s weight on the stirrup.
« Let’s show them what we’re made of » he whispered to Wink’s ear.
She was going to introduce him to the family; as all the previous lovers hadn’t been that appreciated, she felt rather anxious.
« While we’re at it, better get a male, right, Cass ?» as he winked at him.
He needed to find the courage within himself. He looked down at the obvious sign of his desire and lowered a hand on the bump that could have been the other’s.
“Live my brother, be happy…
« I’ll only be away for two weeks. Besides, you’re gonna spend Christmas Eve at Uncle Bobby’s. It’s gonna be great, right? Furthermore, Jo will be there this time...»
Jewel raised her hand to wipe his tears away and blew them away from her little fingers.
“Goddammit!” Dean exclaimed, taking a step backward to catch his breath.
"Who?" Dean replies, pulling his chair next to his brother's one, tired features by his short night.
He took a deep breath and prayed to find the courage to go ahead.
Yet he couldn’t’ leave her… She was all he had left. His father’s family refused to hear about him and on his mother’s side, he only had an aunt left, long forgotten in a home for the elderly and with a faulty memory… He was now the only person left in his mother’s life and despite the moral wounds, he could never forget she had never abandoned him.
"Okay," Dean answers after a moment of surprise. "I'm okay with that. ", with a sweet smile.
« You’re gonna pay for this.... and I hope you’re right »
« I love to see you happy, that’s all....Is that a crime ? »
« It’s Jewel» that totally woke up the father in him.
« Daddy, you look very handsome » Jewel was smiling.
Chadwick was walking Apache and Kart, Mr Andreï’s pittbull.
She loved Dean. She loved Sam too but everything changed when he moved in with them. She tensed up, refusing to share her life –their life- with a big child...
Dean turns around, alert.
And sometimes, like today, he would let go all together and kiss him with passion, greeting Castiel’s hand on his hips and his fingers on his skin. He felt ready to lose himself and Castiel was then starting to hope again.
« Holy mackerel, kids, I missed you so much» he grabbed Chadwick’s shoulder as the boy walked closer.
The happiness that breaks suddenly in
« And? »
« Dean ? » Castiel looked at him, worried.
"Thank you Pedro " he seized the reins .
« I’d like to have a good time with this little pansy» he said, patting on Jaimie’s elbow.
Santa Claus finally managed to get up but Santa’s wife, carried away by the momentum, couldn’t stop on time and knocked off the security agent who clung to Santa Claus in a desperate attempt to regain his balance.
Dean had never been the expressive kind of guy, particularly when his feelings were concerned, even during the years he had spent with Tessa. So there was nothing different between him and Castiel. Except what had led to their deeper bond, long look exchange, silences that were more eloquent than words.
"It’s beautiful ... I visited it with a friend of mine, an archaeologist, two or three years ago ... The children are gonna love it and so are you, for sure ... It's full of dinosaurs, you'll feel in your element"
"That’s it ... I said one more game "
“ You’re gonna blow them up” Dean said with a wink.
« Pardon ? » Castiel didn’t seem to understand where Dean was getting at.
« It looks great, I mean it, Cass » Dean took him by the shoulders, granted him a genuine tender smile and handed him a full spoon.
He turned to the stairs
« I... » Dean’s face was quite red now. He stood up.
« Thanks… I owe you one » he replied, tapping his arm.
"Before he had paradise and his feathered ass-brothers-hole, the question didn't even need to be and then I remind you that it was YOUR idea, not mine," Dean defends himself.
They paused when dinner was finally being served. Jo was exhausted after only two dances and gave her place to Jewel who was a lot more performant than her at this. The dog was watching them all with a puzzled expression, wondering why they had to jump like they did, like fools. He let out a long discouraged sigh.
« She said Daddy and Chadwick and Jo can come but not you. But I don’t want that. I don’t want you to be away. »
« You mean that, Cass? »
« Thanks. I’ve had a great time with you guys » Dean said when it was finally time to leave.
« I’m sure it is » he said, looking back again at the TV screen.
« Bobby »
He watched the envelope for an hour, whisky glass in hand, Sam spoke but he never heard him… Disconnected from everything except him. Locked in his memories… Dean smiled, this last lie… And in his eyes, the ultimate goodbye, the ultimate deed… He should have told him the words that would put him back on track… There were so many lies and so many things left unsaid between them…
Four months they were building up a relationship, step by step.
The boy raised his eyes and left the room.
This Zeke was handsome too, well, from his male point of view... He seemed to have been granted all the criteria to be seductive... Tall, well built, beautiful face... Nice at first glance. Besides, he was intelligent to say the least.... Professor of literature...
