“I guess…” The boy let out a breath before breaking into a smile. “I almost forgot to ask. How is Eileen?”
Still smiling, Sam turned his head to see how Miracle was doing. The dog was engrossed in a game of chase the tail with another dog. He turned his head to look for Dean and Jack. The latter seemed to have gotten better at throwing. The ball was actually reaching Dean this time.
“I found a really good recipe for homemade pizza ages ago and I’ve been dying to try it,” Dean replied, stopping at a fridge to examine its contents. “Claire and Kaia are visiting us for the first time so I wanna make dinner special. Didn’t you miss Claire?”
Jess intervened before there were anymore questions. “Cas? I think you should lie down. I bet you haven't slept all night. You aren't looking so good right now.” she said, standing up.
The Omegas stood in place, unsure and waiting for direction. Cas motioned for Dean to wait as he tried to make for Alistair's quarters. “What? Why the hold up?” whispered Dean as he frowned at Cas.
"By that standard, it would then be rude or unacceptable to try and influence others by omitting or lying about information."
"The sigils are the most important part because they will bind the Nakki to the area once they are inside as the sigil will grant passage but not exit, which is why you must complete them accurately. A misplaced line could put us all at risk." DJ then hands both Dean and Jack a piece of paper with a sigil on it and what looks like a ceremonial dagger.
"Bobby also was extremely adamant regarding the statement that family doesn't end in blood, and while the two kids in there may be of your blood, you've also been a father figure to Jack and Claire."
When they finally reached outside, they see the fleeing duo run into an alleyway up ahead, so they chase after them, which isn't easy as the streets are still fairly crowded with costumed festival-goers.
"The storyline or script rather never specifies your names as it always just takes them as a given as he just writes that one Winchester sibling would kill the other, never worrying about anything because he would never allow more viable children to be born. The burden of one of you," he signals to Sam and Dean, "killing the other is no longer your burden, technically it hasn't been in three years because it's now on us.
"The victim escaped, which means that the other's are going to have to go to the next location on the list since the one we figured out originally was used last night and is now compromised. However, our job just got easier."
"Well, I get off later this evening. I'd be happy-" He pauses and looks at something behind her, and Mation curses in her head, careful not to show anything on her face. "I think your boyfriend may be glaring at me. I apologize."
I wasn't sure if I should tell you blatantly but, I'm feeling nice, so a goat represents the devil and a giant represents a nephilim.
“Man, I don't know know okay, but maybe we should just focus on the fact that he could be 100 miles away from here and we can't call him,” Sam adds, annoyed.
“Perhaps the clothing is limiting our interaction,” Cas states, and Dean looks up, their eyes meeting. Fuck.
He moved his hand to cup Dean’s chin, faking a tender and love filled gesture. Dean’s face was still and hard, but his breathing gave him away.
“Also, we need to leave him alone for a few hours, maybe overnight, and if you want to go in, I have to go first,” Cas instructed and saw that Sam grew even more confused, “just trust me.”
Dean’s eyes were like staring into a green abyss, a window to the now twisted and mangled soul that was once lively and bright. Dean’s tongue slowly traced his bottom lip, a fighting gesture to push Cas farther.
Cas just eyes him again and replies, “You know as well as any that you are a complicated person Dean.”
“Um well, it seems we both of us could stand to be a little more honest - but how about we just go find the lost angel,” Dean insists.
“Don’t,” is all he says before turning away from him to stare out the window. As they drive, trees and masses of bushes blow by them.
“Well, I can’t find my car. It seems I had left it when…” Cas hesitates at the memory, “when we came back. Sam can probably tell you the rest.”
Before Dean can even begin to stand up, Sam is already on his feet, “no, Dean, maybe you can shut me out when it comes to your personal turmoil - or whatever - but this isn’t just about you anymore. I’m not leaving until you tell me what’s going on between you and Cas.”
He finally convinces himself to go back to his room. As he walks closer, he dreads entering, his hand hovering over the doorknob for a few seconds. When he opens the door, Crowley is sitting on his bed, fully dressed.
Getting himself together, and pulling on a t-shirt, he walks out of his room. He notices the khaki color of Cas’s trench coat, as he walks near the library.
Cas turns to looks at Sam now, his face softening, and nodding slowly at Sam. And he and Cas are walking back to the Impala. Dean should’ve known he can count on his younger brother.
“Hi Luke, I’m Dean. Now that we have that taken care of, I think it’s socially acceptable to ask you if you might wanna head out of here.”
Cas’s next breaths are especially heavy, his teeth pulling his lip up to bite it, his hips moving ever so slightly up and down. He is absolutely, fucking, beautiful.
“Man, I’m just tired. What is it? Like 4 in the morning? Let’s sleep and I can pour my heart out to you first thing,” Dean stands up and gives Sam one last half hearted smile. He hears Sam mutter, ‘not likely,’ under his breath but he just keeps walking back to his room.
“Hey, not to ruin the moment,” Dean sighs, “but why was your phone here earlier, after you already left?
Dean walks inside, and familiar surroundings welcome him. He takes a once over at the place, which is decently packed for a random Wednesday night, and people are laughing, arguing, and best of all: drinking. Bars like this happen to act as a kind of home, something they never had growing up. And bars are the one place he can be whomever he chooses and ignore any problems that threaten to take hold once he leaves.
There is enough light (in combination with the impala headlights and the full moon) for them to both see in what condition the other is in. Cas looks over to the road, clothes lightly rustling in the chilling breeze. He looks worn out, like he’d been searching through a dark and empty cavern for years, in hope of finding one last breath of air.
“Yes, and you're an angel,” Dean stared into Cas’s eyes with an unbreakable will, his lip upturned as if he enjoyed being tortured and subdued. “While we’re at it let's mention how, well, hot and bothered this makes you.”
“Hey, is it flying?” Dean asks Sam, standing in a field watching a small little pig start to hover above the floor. After growing wings.
“Look - I know I fucked up,” Dean begins. Cas looks back down, to continue reading. “Maybe we can - I don’t know - talk? We never really did that.”
Castiel looked around the gas station, waiting and waiting to see another human. The sun was shining brightly through the windows, lighting up the magazines and snack foods that he had always seen *him* eat. But... nevermind those memories or his past life. His mission now was to stay alive.
“I have an idea,” Cas leans up to whisper into Sam’s ear. He can tell that Sam was about to lose it from having to witness his brother as a complete monster, the beads of sweat and purple under eyes told the whole story.
“Then he insisted on leaving and with the look on his face, I couldn't object. And that’s when I called you. Dean, what the hell did you do?” Sam’s face is etched with worry and insistence.
“What in hell,” Dean growled, his face contorting from the burn. Dean let out a sound that seemed to mix a growl and a yell.
Cas takes Dean’s silence as corroboration and starts back on his path away from him. Dean takes a step back, and stands there, watching Cas steadily growing smaller and fading into the distance. Too many questions stir in his mind, too many regrets and too many failures. He tries not to think about the pained image of Cas, and the fact that he hadn’t looked Dean in the eye. Not even once. He holds at bay the self-destructive words that no doubt describe Dean perfectly. Things like heartless, cruel, evil, and monster.
Dean watches as Sam gets a little more insistent, his hands coming up and the muffled sound of his voice raising. Cas shakes his head and Dean can hardly convince himself to stay in the car. Then, suddenly, surprising, spontaneously, Cas looks toward Dean. Their eyes aren't quite connected but its that same haunting, terrifying, amazing look. It’s takes everything for Dean not to get out the car and -
“You said that my soul’s been touched - or whatever - by - you know,” Dean starts, his stomach turning slightly at the thought of presenting his idea to Cas, “and that happened because a demon was in me. Cas, you’re an angel. Maybe you need to be in me and then everything will be okay.”
“I have some ideas of how we could use this tie,” Dean looks down, the blue fabric lying snugly around Cas’s neck. He stares at the thing like it’s as sexy as a naked breast.
Cas glances down, smile fading, “I thought I already understood what humanity felt like, but, actually being completely human is just so - overwhelming.”
Sam finishes his last loop and sits up, setting the needle down and grabbing the tissue for one last alcohol swab of the area. He nods to Dean that he can put on his shirt and he does so.
Dean lifts his head, to see Cas with his eyes now open. They are glazed a bit, and unfocused, his breathing beginning to stabilize.
Three small little prayers that all come from him. The human that is causing his grief, who is contacting him with his soul once more, and it serves to act as a metaphorical slap in the face to Castiel. Contact like this should feel reassuring, and remind him of the soul’s purity and beauty. But now, a small bit of unholy excrement has been able to touch it and defile it in the most ungodly way. Castiel can sense every single bit of this, with its laced and latching hold of the man’s soul like it’s only purpose is to destroy God’s Creation.
Dean rests his head in hands for a moment and looks at him, “you know things have been complicated with…”
“Dudes usually don’t get hard around each other either but I guess we can ignore that for now,” Dean smirks slightly, not trying to think too hard about what all this means.
Castiel rests his weight onto his arm, clutching the table for support. His eyes focus strictly down, counting every mark etched into the dark, smooth wood. Perhaps filling his mind with unnecessary information may cause a shortage of some sort. Maybe he can simply forget the things he’s witnessed. It’s a shame human bodies don’t function that way, but nevertheless he keeps trying. Ringing and static starts to fill his mind, and three small echoes emerge amidst the call:
Dean pulls away, settling his right hand onto the steering wheel. Cas looks at him with concern, and is seemingly a little somber at the loss.
“Is someone upset that he was rejected? Can't accept that he was given the oldest excuse in the book?” Dean’s voice feigned sadness and sympathy, his eyes even softening, but the switch to black contrasted the narrative.
“With your feathered friend? Yup, I thought he was about to eat me yesterday, man talk about jealousy,” Crowley chuckles.
“More than anything,” Cas reaches his hand up, curling them around Dean’s neck, placing one, slow, tender kiss. They bask in the moment, the air, the sound of their breathing, the look on each others’ faces. It’s so much yet not enough.
The human with the beautiful soul which left a mark on Castiel as he grabbed it and hurled it toward Earth to be free from damnation. The soul that never belonged there in the first place. He, having heard the full story, acknowledges the irony of the righteous man serving in Hell due to the strength at which he loved his brother. And now, there he was, the beautiful soul, the man who deserved to be saved, the human Castiel devotes his life to, engaging in hedonistic acts with a beast void of and in defilement of God’s light. It was disturbingly blasphemous, and Castiel never dreamed that sort of thing would matter to him ever again but… for some reason it does. To watch that soul, which had recently been saved yet again from the torment of perdition, willingly infect itself? With the King of Hell? With Castiel’s personal arch nemesis? That was the most horrifying event he’d ever seen. And knowing all of the things Castiel has seen, that truly speaks a lot, in and of itself.
“At least we stopped the goat from eating the giant,” Sam shrugs and runs his fingers through his hair, the strands glistening in the sunlight.
Dean just lets his hand stay at his knee for a moment, letting Cas get used to the idea of it all. He travels his hand over the whole of Cas’s calf, and he seems to be slowly relaxing and focussing on the touch. A small part of Dean wishes there weren't any pants in his way, but he keeps going, now up along his thigh. Feeling the pressure and movement of a hand still seems a bit new to Cas. He stirs a little when Dean’s hand grips lightly at his  hip, his breath coming in slightly louder. Dean moves closer, now just a few inches between their position on the bed. Dean moves his left hand farther up stil, onto his side, his hand reaching inside Cas’s trench coat.
“Shit, Cas. You know I'm sorry right? It’s like I told you, I’m fucking sorry. I was the one that started all this and now i'm the one that destroyed it and hurt you in the process. Fuck, you should really just get away from me while you can,” Dean laughs bitterly at the end.
Nodding, Dean leans back in for another deep, needy kiss. They’re both tasting something new and they both absolutely love it.
Cas finished scanning and moved to work the buttons on the register. Not 30 seconds later, the man slammed his fist on the counter.
Cas rushes to place himself on top of him, continuing their kiss, roaming his hands along Dean’s arms and shoulder, and neck, and hell, everywhere he could find. Dean kept with mostly running his hands through Cas’s hair, touching and roaming.
Cas chuckled darkly, “as I recall, aren't you ‘too straight’ to do anything with me? As you so thoughtfully said before.”
Fuck. That makes him want to wretch. How dare he hurt Cas like that? He had no idea that Cas could literally SEE that Dean was - what? - cheating on him?
“Not with anyone? I mean if there’s any way to live as a human, I’d say it’s taking advantage of the perks,” Dean shrugs, attempting to make this as casual as possible.
“I hope you have a loving family. Maybe friends. I hope you are not out here, alone, like me. You deserve better than that, my friend.”
‘Am I gay? This doesn’t make me gay right? Maybe I can just pass it off as being very close friends, because that wouldn't be gay… right? If I’m just slightly closer to my friend then most guys? Well none of it, like, MEANS anything. I’m just… close with Cas. Yeah, we’re just close.’
He wandered over to the cigarettes and the mints and the… pie. He stared for a few moments, for whatever reason. He wasn’t sad… he was just numb.
“Um, well when I went into the kitchen a couple hours ago, Cas was just lying on the floor like he passed out or something,” Dean tenses at that, “but he was okay, mostly. I tried asking him what was wrong but he just sort of wouldnt look at me and whispered something like, ‘the righteous man has fallen.’ And later he finally told me that it involved you.”
I loved being able to just write a truly happy scene, and also to have a go at smut again. It's very different than what I have written before but I like it so much more because I just wrote it the way I wanted to. Without focusing on the graphic stuff but still keeping it physical and intimate - it's not perfect but it's my best smut I think I've written so far.
Suddenly, it all comes back to Dean, every night and every touch. With both angel and demon. Dean can’t do this, he can’t let Sammy know what an absolute fuck up he really is.
“Well, at least we can make up for it,” Cas reaches out his right arm and cups Dean’s left. They stay like this, holding hands and Dean staring at him with bemusement.
“I remember a lot from that time. Like when you told me to leave and forgot to mention that an angel was possessing your brother,” okay, that definitely stung, “So, yes. I remember.”
“Don’t worry, you’re still hot,” Dean adds to comfort him but quickly, randomly, thoughts come racing into his head.
“Now, I can touch every part of you, Cas,” Dean whispers into Cas’s ear, and begins to trail his hand up his thigh again. Cas’s breath stalls, waiting for his hand to cross the next few inches to his…
He finally let the water drip onto Dean’s sensitive cock and watched as a stripe of burning appeared along with Dean’s cry of anguish. “Holy shit stop!”
Cas looks back at him, fervid and fierce. Dean continues down the shirt, each small button taking a couple seconds. He notices the  way Cas’s breathing patterns are unstable, watching his chest rise and fall.
But holy crap, Cas just asked if there’s something he can do about his boner. And there is nothing about that which isn’t eliciting about a million dirty jokes in Dean’s mind.
Cas looks like he’s trying to fight something that’s eat at him on the inside. His eyes show both anger and sadness. Both indignation and devotion. Dean hasn’t lost him completely, but he imagines that he must be very close, probably. He takes a breath before speaking.
“If you don't hurry up I'm gonna change my mind,” Dean remarks playfully, but fuels Cas to scramble at grabbing Dean’s flannel and pushing it off Dean’s shoulders. Dean helps a little. Pulling the sleeves off his arms behind his back. In quick repetition Cas grabs the edge of his black t - shirt, sliding it up Dean’s torso. Air in the room glides over dean’s exposed skin, reminding him that he’s nearly bare. Cas pulls the shirt up and over, tossing yet another article of clothing limply on the floor.
“Wait, Cas, is that you? Cas?!” Dean calls out, standing close enough to notice the features that all remind him of his friend. And then Cas turns around, warily avoiding Dean’s eyes.
“I cracked him, he should be more compliant to the treatment now, no need to thank me,” Cas accidentally let out some of his snarky side to Sam, and Sam raised an eyebrow questioningly.
Dean was taken aback, and hesitates for a moment. He could never seem to get used to the blunt way in which Cas speaks.
“I - I thought we weren’t supposed to talk about it,” Cas’s words come out a bit stumbled and hasty.
Dean glides it down his arms and lets it drop on the floor, with all that remaining to be his tie and white button up. Urgency tries to take him over, telling him to just yank everything off as fast as humanly possible, but that doesn't’ feel right. For some reason, standing here, staring into the ex-angel’s lust filled eyes is more important.
“Maybe, and I’m also going to assume that if you’re willing to talk to me you might be willing to do something about it,” Dean leans against the bar counter, looking up and down at the stranger in front of him.
“And that’s good. Yeah, I can just - get mine fulfilled somewhere else,” Dean hopes this will be a comfort, but Cas tenses up.
“You didn't think to say something like, ‘oh hey your friend just walked in on-’ gosh, you’re so-” Dean’s words are coming out too harsh, too fast, and he just can't think about anything other than the way Cas had looked at him…
A clinging noise alerted him immediately. He turned, ashamed that he had left his post. A good employee should not do that.
“So let me try to get this straight. You did something to seriously upset Cas, like...” Sam pauses, shaking his head, “a lot, and then you go out on a hunt?”
Sam isn’t finished yet but Dean has to look away. To think Cas was in such bad shape… because of him?
4. Slight warning for Dean's borderline homophobic thought process - it's nothing too different from what the show has depicted but I thought I should warn you just in case.
Cas grinned to himself, hunter-turned-demon completely oblivious to the gears turning in his head as he kept rubbing the gland. Dean’s stare was hot and heavy and almost took the breath out of Cas before he gained his composure. He looked down to find a clear liquid trailing down the length of Dean’s dick, precum. It made him feel proud since he barely had to touch Dean at all to make this happen. Cas kept going, rubbing, and beginning to make Dean lose it. He watched as Dean threw back his head with a smack and clenched his fists tightly.
“Well, is there something I can do about it,” there is worry in Cas’s eyes, and he genuinely seems to want an answer.
Dean is still about a foot away but Cas shifts uncomfortably again, his pants seem to be getting even more tight.
As Crowley’s hand does it’s thing, Dean leans his back into him, noticing for the first time… the feeling of bare skin.
“Yeah but normally we also don’t talk about sex,” Dean shrugs, “screw normal. Just, sit still and tell me if anything feels wrong or if you want me to stop.”
“Just wanted to be prepared,” the smirk is permanently tinged in his voice, “this is nice, right? See, I told you foreplay was important.”
There are moments when Castiel longs for the time he had spent as a full powered angel. He misses the simple act of flying, at times the self-righteousness, and overall how complete and intact he still he was. He realizes now that he took it all for granted, but life had been that way for millions of years. He relied only on his strength and superiors to guide him, and it was all gloriously easy. For he hadn’t made a single decision yet; therefore, he hadn’t destroyed the world yet. And living that way hadn’t become impossible just quite yet. All that time, it was so simple and immensely less painful. That was God’s plan for Castiel, and he had chosen to defy every single last bit of it. He mocked the role he was destined for, and played another part. Yet, sitting in a small kitchen in a rather secluded town of Lebanon, Kansas, he has absolutely no regrets on the matter. It all leads back to that moment when he ultimately learned that the written script had to be burned; he needed to define his own mission alongside two men that finally opened a door for Castiel that he never dreamed of opening all those years ago when he was a full powered angel.
A mix of nerves and surprise cause Dean to start laughing, hugging his stomach with his hands, “yeah, you’re absolutely  wrecking me, Cas and it's fucking awesome.”
“Aw, is ‘Deany boy’ giving up?” Cas expertly transitioned his face to the fake sympathy Dean had given him, and Dean’s arm tensed.
“You think i'm gonna go human from just a few touches? Didn't you get the hint Casie? I. Don't. Want. You.” Dean took his time emphasizing his words, trying to dig deep. His mouth inches away from Cas’s.
“He doesn't actually have his car,” Dean says it a little faster, hoping maybe Sam would just say ‘cool’ and not question him about it.
Dean hesitates, “yeah - well - that’s how I feel, all the time. I want to have that with you, all the time.”
“No, I, uh, I mean,” Dean calms down, not sure that he should even ask this or why wants to, “can angels like get freaky?”
He wanted, maybe needed, to tell Cas what was really going on. All he could think about was the way Cas looked so damn heartbroken, and he realizes that things are better this way. He should be free of me.
“Dean,” Cas sits up a bit more, to try to look Dean directly in the eyes. Although, Dean won't face him, “you can't possibly think that I don't want a relationship with you.”
After a few moments, Sam walks up from the hall. He looks between Dean and what's in is hand, “is that Cas’s phone?”
They watch each other, both debating how this can turn out, every once in a while roaming their eyes over the other’s lips. They remind each other of what they've been through. With Cas, it’s betrayal and worthlessness. For Dean, it’s self-hatred and disorientation. Neither of them want to think too hard about any of it, and focussing on each other’s breath is much more comforting. Looking at each other again is especially comforting. And Dean sees an angel, one just trying to understand. Always. Just. Trying. It’s inspiring, even, how much the guy cares about this little planet. He probably knows billions of them, but yet, he cares about this one - and about the little humans on it - and about Dean.
It’s kind of funny in a sad way that everyone close to him assumes hunting would be his first reaction to a stressor. It’s even sadder that sometimes that was true.
Cas fixes his eyes on the floor, he ponders over something and mumbles “it really wouldn't make any sense - there’s just -”
He looks in a cabinet to find their cheap whiskey, dental floss, and sewing needle. Grabbing a plain t - shirt for later, he walks leisurely back into the war room. Sam is back to napping again, but now with a beer in front of him. Dean clears his throat with a loud, ‘ahem.’
“If you knew what I actually wanted, you would have ran off. It was clear that -  well none of it matters,” Cas begins to stand up.
3. I had to throw in a little jab at Dean's decision in season 13 finale (doesn't change the timeline of this story - I'm just salty). So I hope you see the symbolism.
He spoke softly to the little red bug, admiring its black specks. This little creature was innocent, just looking for a place to belong. He needed and wanted love, and Castiel would offer this to him.
Cas turned to the side and walked over to the cart containing multiple weapons and tools to aid torture. He gazed over all the options and pulled out exactly what he needed. As he turned back to Dean and showed him the clear bottle, Dean groaned.
“Okay, well. We need to head to where the roadhouse was, folks around there might know if anyone from our families made it and where they are.” said Jo, glancing at Amy. Her son had been taken from her during the raid, they could only hope that someone had taken him in.
Cas seemed to sense it and reached for Deans cock, his big hand gripping it and pumping as he held him around the middle, pulling him as close as he could.
Sam kept giving Dean looks, checking in on him and making sure he was okay. It was irritating, but there was also comfort in knowing Sam had his back. Sam really did try to be supportive but in a clumsy way that usually ended up with Dean yelling at him to back off.
Bobby ambled across the yard to the side of the house, pulling a large flat bed trolley of firewood ready to be stacked in the woodshed. Getting ready for winter seemed to be a full time job during autumn. Mentally taking stock of the supplies he would still need, he began unloading and stacking the firewood according to size in the shabby, but sturdy lean-to that served as a woodshed, only half filled at this point. It would take him a couple more weeks to ensure a plentiful supply of fuel for the coming winter. His food stocks were in pretty good shape, he would have to hunt some game and preserve it to round out his supplies, but his crops had been plentiful this year and the rows of mason jars and sacks and barrels of dried goods filled the shelves of his pantry in the basement. He had done some good trading this year, one of the settlements had managed to grow enough wheat to trade a surplus and they had desperately needed a water filter, something Bobby could put together with his eyes closed, so now Bobby would have bread this winter.
“I can imagine. The others said something similar when they woke up this morning.” said Cas gently, sensing Deans discomfort over the admission. To Deans relief, he changed the subject.
Once it was ready, Cas excused himself and left the table, scooping up his clothes and wash bag as he went.
“Hey, guys. Pools open till ten pm, when I go off duty. Then I gotta close up and cover the pool, okay?” the young guy said cheerily.
The next few days were spent exploring, fishing and bonding in a way the men had never done before. Without the constant threat of danger hanging over them, they relaxed and enjoyed themselves.
They slowly moved across the camp site, where Benny was busying himself removing the bodies of the dead bandits and Amy was rebuilding the fire, she had tied baby Matthew to her back in a sling and he was fast asleep.
“Cas, you clearly aren't well enough to go anywhere. I meant what I said before, if you try to travel right now, it would probably kill you.” said Jess, getting out of her chair as if to wrestle him back to bed herself.
Cas stepped forward, his head tipped to the side as if confused, he held one hand out in front of himself and pointed at the Beta who was now looking terrified.
Jack gave his Daddy an indignant look. “I can do it myself, Daddy. I'm four now, you know. I'm not a baby anymore.” he said grumpily. He climbed down from Santa's lap and headed for the bathroom. He paused at the door and looked back. “Hey, Santa. Don't go nowhere just yet, okay? I wanna say goodnight.” he asked, his wide blue eyes were pleading.
Dean sighed. “I’m alright, but Sam should know better, Jack takes everything so literally.” he grumbled.
Dean gave a small grin as he sat down at the table. “Oh, man. I love watching the food network. I've got a couple of recipes I'm dying to try out. Saw one for a teriyaki steak rub that looked amazing. Had this salad that went with it that had chunks of orange in it, even I would eat that.” he said, looking wistful.
“I'll come get you, if that's what you're askin'.” said Bobby, a ripple of relief going through him.
“Aww, Hell!” said Bobby, almost running to the radio. “Go get Sam and Jess” he barked at Garth, who nodded and ran off.
As Dean approached Cas' door, he took a deep breath and tried to calm his racing heart. Psyching himself up as if he was going into battle, he paused to take another deep breath and knocked on the angels door.
“Okay. We'll do the asking thing. I guess it's only weird if we make it weird, right?” he said, wiping the tears from his face with his sleeve.
Jack stripped off his shirt and was standing at the ladder the time Sam reached it. Cas was beginning to look nervous as he stood nearby.
“We’ll switch it up later. Got something I wanna talk to you about.” Dean said looking nervous as he started the engine.
Dean swung his legs over the side of the bed and stretched again. “Yeah, we talked till almost two am. I think I crashed halfway through a sentence.” Dean said, taking the coffee Cas offered him gratefully. “Thanks, Cas.”
“That makes you one of the good guys, Cas.” said Dean huskily. A different sort of tension in the air now buzzed between them.
“I get what Sam see's in you. What you did last night was amazing. I mean that. If anyone can give Cas the chance to survive, it'll be you. Thanks Jess.” said Dean, looking embarrassed.
“Shullub umm hod” said Dean, through a mouthful of food. He swallowed noisily and repeated to Charlie's confused face “I said, shut up, I'm hot.”
Sam ran his hands over his face and pushed his hair back, stretching his torso and yawning widely. “I'm gonna hit the shower, and then make a run to town for groceries. Anything you want in particular?” he asked, looking at Dean who was now massaging his temples.
Charlie growled under her breath. “Are you done? Because enough with the fucking pity party, Dean. Cas loves you. You know it, I know it, everybody knows it. He's off saving the world and what are you doing? That's right, whining like a bitch. Get the fuck over yourself, because I'm done dealing with your moods.” she snapped before bursting into tears.
Dean sighed, nervously tapping his fingers on the steering wheel. “I’m thinking about retiring.” he said quietly.
“Out with it, Castiel.” said Michael, his tone taking on it's usual coldness, his posture stiffening.
“Yes. Technically he killed my Omega mother, my Alpha father didn't survive the bond break. It's a little complicated, from what I can gather. Hannah and I have never gotten the full story. Michael refuses to talk about it.” said Cas sadly.
“Don't do that again.” said Cas, grumpily “We're almost there, that's the rock I was talking about.” Dean looked at where Cas was pointing, the silhouette of the rock stood out against the gradually lightening sky. He slowed down and steered towards it. Pulling up a few minutes later, he let the truck idle as Cas jumped out and ran over towards a shrub growing off to one side. He turned to the tiny window at the back of the cabin to talk to the girls “Hey, ladies does anyone need the bathroom? This is the last stop for a while” he chuckled as all three of the Omegas scrambled out of the truck bed and disappeared behind a rock.
He paused at the door with a soft smile. Cas was perched on the edge of Jacks bed, he had shed the Santa suit and was dressed in a sleeveless tank that showed off his tanned muscular arms and loose cotton pyjama pants with a unicorn and rainbow pattern. The pyjamas had been a gag gift from Sam, but it had backfired when Cas had actually loved them. The dork.
Cas rolled onto his stomach, looking down at the hunter. “I could grow a beard I suppose.” he said, running a fingertip from Deans chin down to the middle of his bare chest, marvelling as the goosebumps raised on his skin and Dean’s nipples hardened.
Sam smiled. “As long as you don’t throw up in the pool, I think we’ll be okay.” he said with a chuckle.
Dean nodded appreciatively. “Okay then. Looks like I have to adjust my view of you. I figured you for bein’ an innocent, now I know you’re a horn dog, just like the rest of us.” he teased.
“It's fine now, Sam. He's not gonna Alpha out on us. I tripped his instincts when I had a nightmare and stunk up the joint with Omega distress.” sighed Dean tiredly.
Sam chuckled. “Nah, he’ll be okay. The cramp thing is a myth. Plus it’ll keep him busy for a while and out of your hair, so you and Cas can talk, if you want.” he said, his tone nervous.
He thought back to what Sam had said, had he been attracted to Cas this whole time without realising? How was that even possible? He thought about the many demons and angels that had insinuated that there was something between them, he realised he had never really denied it, or even felt disgust at the thought. He had always assumed that Cas didn't have those sort of feelings so he had ignored it. Now he could see it in a new light.
Sam chuckled. “Try not to blow a gasket. I'm here if you wanna talk.” he said, standing up. He eyed the whiskey bottle on the desk and picked it up. “No more of this stuff tonight. If you can't sleep, read a book that doesn't have pictures.” he said, gesturing to the stack of graphic novels on the night table.
Jack stood in the water looking up at Sam with a grin on his face. “Okay, Sam. How do I swim?” he asked.
“Castiel! Michael wants to see you. One of the plains clans was raided yesterday, they fought them off, but Lucifer's second in command was seen leading the attack. Michael wants all the Alphas in an emergency war council in case he decides to look here instead.”
Jess looked stern. “You haven't slept in three days? Okay, that's it. Bed. Now.” she motioned Sam to help her and Charlie stood back, allowing them to stand either side of Cas, helping him out of the chair and across the house to the library.
The sun was well over the horizon when he woke up with a start. He'd finally realised what had been niggling him. Witnesses hadn't said anything about vehicles! They must have vehicles to transport the Omegas and goods back to their settlement, but none of the witnesses had mentioned seeing or hearing even a single car or truck. Castiel realised he needed to look at it a different way. He'd assumed the clan used the decrepit road network. He silently scolded himself for his stupid assumption.
“Gee, Sam. Hello to you too.” snarked Dean, picking up the hand shovel again and digging around a particularly stubborn root.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I won't know till I look at it, but it's probably just worn brakes.” he sighed. “Look, come with me. I'll show you what I'm talking about.” he said, grabbing the angels arm and pulling. “I wanna talk to you about something anyway.” he muttered lowly.
They worked efficiently, stripping the carcass and salting it, before wrapping the meat and tying it off to the poles they would use to carry the large carcass out of the forest. Shouldering the poles, they began the march back out of the forest. John leading, occasionally pointing out uneven ground or stray rocks to Bobby, preventing him from tripping.
Dean blushed again. “I wasn’t sure what to make of it. I’d only just realised I kinda liked him like that too. I told him I’d have to think about it.” he said, taking the turn onto a busy street with slow moving traffic.
Cas looked at him with hope in his wide blue eyes and Dean smiled and leaned in, pressing a soft kiss on the Alphas mouth.
As they reached the truck, they were surprised to find that Benny had moved the bodies here too. Judging by the drag marks on the ground, he'd dumped them in the ditch on the opposite side of the road. However, the cab was still drenched in blood and had started to attract flies. The coppery scent was cloying and both Dean and Charlie gagged.
Dean looked sheepish as he realised his enthusiasm was starting to wear on the others. “Already checked it this morning, She's good to go. But, I guess I should probably check the spare. Want me to look at your truck, Cas?” he asked hesitantly, looking at the angel for the first time since they had come home and patting him on the shoulder.
Jack wondered how he would actually ride the bike (if Santa left it) as when Jack had sat on Papa's bike one time with Daddy's help, he hadn't been able to reach the pedals or the handlebars. Maybe the bike would be smaller? Jack hoped so. If he got a bike, maybe he would be able to go to work at the hospital with Papa in the mornings instead of going to kindergarten. Making sick people better sounded like more fun than going to kindergarten. Although he hoped they still got cookies and milk at snack time, that was the best part of the day in Jacks opinion.
Last chapter of fluff, next chapter things start getting serious, with some new characters and surprises in store.
Charlie twisted around in order to poke Cas, who frowned at the finger Charlie was currently digging into his ribs. “Dude, we just became best friends.” said Charlie, happily. “I'm honoured, thank you.” said Cas, completely seriously. “You should be” warned Charlie, with a wink.
Cas nodded, wisely keeping it to himself that he thought it had more to do with a release of tension than anything else.
Santa ran a hand over Jacks head soothingly. “Probably after you've gone to bed, little one.” he said softly.
Back at the motel, everyone quickly changed into shorts, leaving t-shirts on for the walk to the indoor pool. Cas wore a pair of Deans shorts that were loose on Dean, but fitted Cas a little more snugly. His ass and thighs were bigger and the tight material was a little distracting for Dean who was trying not to stare as Cas walked ahead of him next to Jack, who was chattering excitedly.
Cas huffed a laugh. “I suppose it is. I confess to feeling a little self conscious and awkward still.” he said, crossing his arms and cupping his elbows, he was having a hard time looking at Dean in the eyes.
The journey to Bobby's homestead had been planned with military efficiency. Everyone knew their role and an hour after dawn, the camp had been broken down and the trucks loaded with everything they would be taking with them. The trash being burned or buried and all evidence of their occupation covered up.
Charlie nodded and tried to stand, holding her arms out as if to hug Bobby, she hesitated, unsure of how it would be received.
Switching off the main lights, Dean took a moment to admire the Christmas tree and the strings of lights hung up around the room. It looked so cosy and domestic, he could hardly believe this was his life. When he and Cas met they were both veterans, Cas from the air force and Dean from the army. Both had scars beyond the surface and more baggage that an airport carousel. But they had both healed and made a life together that had value and worth.
Dean sniggered and then scowled as Ellen smacked the back of his head. “Ow! Fuck sake!” he muttered.
Dean blushed scarlet and Ellen dashed out of the room laughing as soon as Cas turned around looking confused.
When Sam had discovered a tiny baby skunk in an illegal trap, Cas had freed it while Sam and Dean hid behind a tree, terrified of being sprayed. Cas had healed the little guy and Jack had begged to be allowed to keep it. Dean had put his foot down and said no. Cas had gently explained that the skunk needed to live in the wild, Sam had taken the little guy out to a rangers station, along with the remains of the illegal trap.
Cas looked alarmed. Instinctively reaching to pull Dean in for a hug, he checked himself before he completed the manoeuvre and awkwardly patted Dean on the arm instead. The uncharacteristic clumsiness did not go unnoticed and Dean gave Cas a dirty look as he cringed.
There was no more to do and they were waiting on Cas to show up so they could leave. Sam was pointedly ignoring Deans hints to go and get him and Jack was completely oblivious, even in his excitement.
“Aww, it’s no trouble. Back where I’m from, it’s just the right thing to do. You run into trouble ‘round here, you call the station and ask for Bill, that’s me.” said Bill, climbing into his car. “Take care of yer boy now, the special ones are precious.”
Dean grimaced. “Yeah, that's not good, Cas. You need to tell me this stuff so I can fix it before you crash it. I mean, I know you'd be alright, but what if you hit someone else?” he scolded.
“No problem, kid. It was Cas’ idea really. I just rolled with it.” Dean said, looking over at Cas who was smiling at Jacks excitement.
Dean shrugged. “Sure. Ain't like we're on a schedule. It's gonna take a couple of days to get there anyway, what's a few more hours? Just, don't tell her anything about this, okay? Not till I've figured it out a little more.”
Dean could feel the warmth coming from Cas' body and he could detect the faint scent that was just Cas. Petrichor and something spicy. Cas felt solid, as if he had roots going deep into the earth itself. Dean relaxed and put his arms around Cas shoulders, feeling the tension bleed out of both of them. Dean marvelled how different it felt when he allowed himself to take comfort. It was a nice feeling, Cas made him feel safe.
“Yeah, shit.” Dean said, still looking spaced out. “I’ll see you in the morning, Sam.” he mumbled, hurrying to his room without looking back.
best bet was to distract them from you. He probably told them you were dead. You wanna know why? Because he trusts
It didn't work, his heart sank as Jack burst into tears. “I don't understand. I want my Papa!” he wailed.
After carefully wriggling into a pair of simple cotton pants with Jess' help, Cas let her adjust his bedding until he was comfortable. He felt sleepy and yawned widely, making his jaw crack. “Take a nap if you need to, Cas. We'll get some broth ready for when you wake up.” said Jess. Cas nodded and within moments was sound asleep.
Cas looked confused again then a look of dawning realisation came over his face and he rolled his eyes. “Oh, I see. Sausage fest. The sausages are penises.” he said, making Dean choke on his own spit and he could hear Claire roaring with laughter from the phone again.
The door to Alistair's quarters was locked from the outside, Cas pulled Alistair's keys from his pocket and began to test each one, the third key slipped in and turned with no resistance and Cas gingerly turned the handle and cracked the door barely an inch and waited. Hearing nothing but his own heartbeat, Cas opened the door a little wider and peered out. It was a large room that had been used as a kitchen, one wall was taken up with two huge stoves and a pantry and a large table with a bench sat in the middle of the room. Thankfully, this room was clean and smelled faintly of soup.
“Size.... 12. You got big feet, buddy. Not as big as Sam's though. Fuckin' sideshow Bob.” he said aloud, so only Cas could hear. He heard a huff of laughter.
He wondered if he had known whether it would have changed anything about their friendship. His heart sank as he realised he had probably hurt Cas so many times over the years and the angel had taken it mostly without a word of complaint.
“You- you look um- great. Yeah.” Dean said dumbly, stepping back and leaning on a rack of shirts for support. He couldn't stop staring Cas' lean torso and bulging biceps.
“Okay, so we’ve both got a solid plan for retirement, right?” Dean said, glancing over at his brother.
“Hi, are you still here? I thought Ellen or Amy would have taken over by now?” she whispered quietly, quickly glancing at Ellen who was still asleep propped up.
Dean looked at him proudly. “Hey, there you go. I knew educating you on popular culture would pay off. Next movie night we’ll watch Top Gun and Tootsie” he said, deliberately touching Cas on the knee and holding his hand there for a moment.
Cas shook his head. “He says it’s urgent. He drank three bottles of Gatorade after Sam warned him about dehydration in the heat.” he said regretfully. “Speaking of which, you should get into some shade soon, you’re starting to burn.” he added, looking concerned.
Cas rolled his eyes, indicated the truck and whispered “Then I hope you can drive, because I can't.”
The first hints of Destiel and some emotional whiplash in this, plus a little bit on how the differences between the genders and their instincts work.
Sam look at his brother proudly. “Look at you, being a mature adult in a relationship.” he said with a smile. “They grow up so fast.” he said, pretending to cry.
“I don't believe so, no. Even if I hadn't let my instincts take over, I probably would have killed him anyway. It was the same for me when I found you all in the compound. Omegas are precious. They give life. It's abhorrent to harm them.” said Cas, lifting his head and meeting Deans eyes.
Mary waited until Dean pulled the truck onto the main street before she decided to bring up the elephant in the room. Or the truck, whatever.
“I tell you what, we'll sit down at some point and go over everythin', 'cause that all sounds pretty good. Maybe we can make a start on some of your ideas before you get back here for good.” said Bobby clapping Cas on the shoulder.
Bobby had a theory that it was why forced matings were so prevalent. After all, an Omega dying after a forced mating, would have no physical affect on the Alpha. It may be upsetting, even devastating, but it wouldn't possibly
was, but registered the loss all the same. He stood up on shaky legs and grabbed the jeans Cas had left on the back of his chair and pulled them on, deciding at the last minute not to bother with the belt, he pulled it through the loops and dumped it on the chair.
The distant sound of an engine had Bobby on alert immediately and marching to his porch where his shotgun rested upright against the front step.
Cas figured that breaking in via Alistair's quarters was the best way to get into the building and avoid the guards. After all, it was unlikely they would be discovered, Alistair was currently dying 40ft below ground and unable to raise the alarm.
“No, I swear. He walked out of that changing room and I swear, it was like.. like Whoa! He just looked so good. I was confused, because its Cas,
“Aww, you big baby. Try having a concussion and then come back to me whining about a headache.” jeered Jo to Dean who was trying unsuccessfully to sit up. He managed a crawling lurch and vomited into the basin that Jess had left next to him, sparking Sam off into another round of retching.
Cas' expression went hard and his jaw clenched in anger. “It never ceases to amaze me that when things get hard, you Winchesters suddenly forget all about the so called 'Free will' that was so
Cas stood up and took the pan from Sam, checking the taller mans burn and healing it immediately. He gently pushed Sam towards the table and continued serving the food himself. “There was a pizza place near the Gas'n'sip that sold single slices for a dollar. The owner would often let me have two slices even if I did not have enough money to pay for it. He was very kind. I offered him a free coffee whenever he needed gas, but he always declined.” Cas said, putting the pan back on the stove and bringing the bowls of food to the table, placing one in front of each brother.
Dean climbed out of the truck and helped Charlie down from the cabin before closing the door and taking her elbow, helping guide her over the rough terrain in the almost pitch black.
“Cas! Cas, I’m sorry. That was a dick move. I didn’t mean to hurt you, but I did, and I’m really sorry. Please don’t leave.” he begged.
“An hour or so. I figured we’d check in, go grab a bite somewhere and then Jack can play in the pool to his hearts content until bedtime.” Sam said with a chuckle.
Dean watched his husband and son as they swayed, mortified that Jack had been so upset at what he had seen.
Dean whined. “You don't get it, Cas. They've all been teasing me about my little crush on you. If they saw us, they're gonna be unbearable.” he folded his arms crossly.
Ellen nodded and cupped his jaw. Tears were running down her face. “I'll do my best, hon. We'll get you comfortable first, okay?” Cas nodded. It was getting harder to speak.
(Boy, do I have some surprises for you!) I know there isn't a lot of Destiel so far, but to be fair, in this story they only met 2 days ago! It will be a bit of a slow burn. I'm not normally a fan of those, but I'm finding that on the writing side of things, they make more sense.
“Santa” he breathed, his eyes filling with tears. “You're really here.” he said, his throat thick with emotion. He was really here. With the red suit and the big black boots and the enormous white beard and everything.
So, back to the last chapter. Dean and Sam make an agreement. Cas is a sweetheart. Dean gets an education. More sexy times ahead.
Cas’ breath hitched and he swallowed heavily. “Perhaps I should go. If I’m making things worse for you-”
Cas looked up, the pain on his face was mixed with sympathy for Dean’s distress. “I’m not helping, am I?” he said quietly.
“Hey, guys. Room for one more?” Dean whispered, chuckling as Jack merely raised an arm and patted the other side of his bed to indicate where Dean should sit. Cas gave Dean one of his lazy half smiles that still made his tummy flip even after all these years. Dean slid onto the other side of the bed and ran his hands through Jacks hair soothingly.
“Looks good. It's correctly placed, that bruising is something else though. Your whole arm is black and blue. I'll splint it slightly differently so it's more comfortable and you'll be able to move your hand at least. Sound good?” said Jess as she began to re-wrap his arm. It was throbbing now.
"I have everything set aside for you to take with you, don't worry about everything fitting knowing a witch or two does have its benefits in the long run." Amara states as she strides into the room, Naomi following close behind. Amara gestures to a suitcase beside one of the circular tables in the room, "that suitcase has been enchanted to fit everything that you may need for the duration of this mission; of course, there may be things you need to source yourself, but this should at least provide some comfort for yourself and the children as they grow up. Think of it like Mary Poppins bag if you will, if you understand that reference, I've been watching Disney movies in my free time, or at least I was before my brother set 'the end' in motion." Amara continues forward to the table covered in various objects. Amara picks up one of the talismans and gently places it over Naomi's head.
Sam pulls into what is now their fourth attempt to find a place to stay in this town; they really should book ahead instead of finding a place to sleep up to chance. They knew there was a Christmas festival going on, yet it still came as a surprise when the first three places were booked solid.
"You can't promise that not when the empty could literally take you away at any moment," Jack interjected.
"You live extraordinary, strange lives, and yet you weren't even phased with being sucked into the TV and being a cartoon," DJ states, seemingly like he doesn't know what to do with the information that he's been given.
"A Christmas monster, really you couldn't have found us something simple? Like a rugaru or a wendigo?"
"What are you getting at?" Dean asked harshly, wanting them to get to the point; Sam was now looking at the kids in horror, seemingly having figured out the direction that the children were leading them down. While Cas looked pained and his gaze was solely focused on Dean, Dean refused to spare him a glance, worried at what he'd find there.
"Ugh, no, see my.. my son's never experienced Christmas before just adopted him recently, and my brother saw an ad for the Christmas festival that's happening, so we drove straight here. We're kind of hoping that you have a room left?" Dean talks, trying to look sympathetic.
"Not yet, but I will. I can tell you, though, that we're headed in the wrong direction currently. We need to be heading North-West if my general guidelines are correct. I'll have the actual location pinned in about 10 minutes." DJ explains, pulling out his laptop to help the search. Presumably, Dean's not even going to try and understand what DJ is going to do on that thing.
"Ya, he is," Cas confirms, "but um.. somethings different, Jack is ah, well, he's been to the garden that's the crossroads of divinity and humanity nobody has been there since the exile, till now, till Jack."
"So do you have powers? I can sense you're not as powerful as me, but I can sense a tingle of power radiating from you, and you entered my dreams so you must have something."
The kid finishes and says a small thank you to the crowd before leaving the stage quickly. Dean exchanges a look with his brother while the crowd starts snapping their fingers for some reason.
The Nakki's are slowed down, but they are still moving towards Marion, but Dean hears Sam, DJ, and Jack start the incantation.
"I've been thinking about the true spirit of Christmas because comparing what Sam tells me about Christmas versus what you explained about Christmas in heaven; they appear to be very different."
Dean looked contemplative for a moment. "Well, I guess that's it then." Dean looked at his glass a moment more before picking it up and downing the last of the liquid. "I think it's time that I head to bed, too, no telling what tomorrow actually has in store." Dean got up from his seat and walked around the table in the direction of his bedroom.
Dean is thankfully taken out of his thoughts by the sounds of twigs snapping as a fair of footsteps draw closer. Perhaps Sam was right to locate him the furthest away from where they would be arriving because he already wanted to shoot the thing. Marion was holding hands with the monster and smiling up at them while they walked forward. Dean watched them intently, waiting for their signal.
"I meet the demographic of the other victims, and it would provide an easy way to have them lead up back to the water without them setting off a warning signal to the other Nakki, thus making our efforts worthless."
"The lore states that instead of a peaceful transfer of life by giving one's self to the water when it was their time to die, the soul of a young woman who had killed herself after having been wronged by her village gave herself to become a rusalka with the intent of getting revenge on those that wronged them."
"So, can we eat?" Jack finally pipes up, breaking more of the tension resulting in Dean and Sam to laugh and the others to smile softly.
Because that is what Jack is to him, no matter how much he likes to deny it in his head. Jack has been a constant dollar coaster for Dean, having blamed him for Cas' death right off the back and threatening to kill him as well. To coming to like the kid over time to wanting to be the one to kill him after Mary dies. He wanted and was willing to kill the boy he saw as his son despite believing that family meant everything to him. He had momentarily turned into his father, his Dad had been prepared to kill Sam, his own son, if he had to because of the Demon Blood, and in turn, Dean wanted to put his own son down because he had lost his soul and couldn't control powers that no one else on earth had. Dean's stomach was churning uncomfortably.
"She was able to give a basic description, and while they can shapeshift, they only have one human-looking form. We're looking for a white man, late 20s to early 30's dark hair with a beard, with a tattoo of cancer and pieces symbols tattooed on either wrist."
Sam pulled back from Jack but gave him a watery smile looking down at the Nephilim. Sam stood up straighter as he took a step back to let Jack have some personal space but continued to smile at the boy.
I wanted to somewhat introduce one of the children in this chapter but it was already over 6000 words and I didn't want the chapter to feel overcrowded.
Both Dean and Sam take a breath, and Cas looks them both over before opening the door to where Jack is with the brothers following close behind. The three of them stop in front of the table where Jack is sitting hunched over with his head tilted down, looking upset.
"Of course, I forgive you, Jack." Dean choked out a whisper. Sam gasped softly somewhere beside him, and although Dean couldn't see it, he knew Cas was looking at him with that look, the look of admiration which becomes more intense as Dean continues to say all too familiar words.
"Wait, I had kids with Naomi! Nope, nope, nope, this is not happening."Dean panics and starts moving, suddenly this went from being weird to being too much to handle; he barely hears Jack when he starts to speak again.
Cas grimaced and nodded. “Yes, but it was worth it.” he smiled back. “Was it too much for you?” he asked, a slight hint of nervousness in his tone.
The Omegas had quickly bonded in their mutual hatred of Alistair, and had been plotting various escape plans in the weeks of captivity. None had come to fruition, Alistair had been doing this for a long time and was way ahead of any scheme the Omegas came up with, although it amused him that they had tried.
Cas chuckled. “It’s Sam’s turn this morning. He already texted me to tell me he’s gone to get everyone coffee and donuts.” he said, combing his fingers through Dean’s hair.
Omegas, naturally submissive and extremely fertile, were highly prized and fought over. Especially male Omegas, which were
Dean stood open mouthed in the parking lot, staring into space. Sam walked up to him with a questioning look. “Everything okay? You look spooked.” he said stopping in front of Dean with a look of concern.
Santa chuckled. “Not until morning. You want your Papa to be here too, don't you?” he asked, pointedly.
“Hello, little one. Did you escape from your mama? She'll be looking for you.” he said, his voice croaky.
“Heeeey, Jack. Did you brush your teeth? It's time for bed, little man.” said Dean, trying for nonchalant.
“Jody puts us on a shower rota at her house, with a time limit. She says there are too many people and only one bathroom for us to stay in there too long. She says we have to respect the others living with us and we are not allowed to masturbate in the shower because that is disrespectful. We are supposed to do it in our rooms, with the door closed.” Jack said, completely straight faced.
“Hello, Dean.” he said, gesturing for Dean to come closer. Dean went gladly, standing between Cas' legs, throwing his arms around him and burying his face in Cas' neck. He breathed in deeply, inhaling Cas' scent of petrichor and newly turned earth.
Bobby sagged in the chair. “Balls!” he growled into the mic. “Okay, I guess we'd better start workin' on plan B. I take it after you kill that son of a bitch, you'll be headin' back here?” he questioned.
Sam looked proud at his brother for asking for help. He wisely said nothing, instead he dragged the last meatball through the sauce and chewed it thoughtfully.
Dean huffed a laugh. “I’ll go first. I’m just a puny human, so I ain’t gonna be blindfolded to even the odds.” he said, picking a smooth rock from the little pile Jack had made and turning it over in his hand.
Cas spun around on the spot and looked at Balthazar intensely. The Beta flinched, expecting another punch.
“Claire, I’m sorry if this is weird for you. I really am. But we’re in love. We’re gonna retire, get a place together, maybe even get married someday. If you don’t think you can deal with it, well, I don’t know what to tell you.” Dean said stepping forward and putting his arm around Cas protectively. Cas leaned against him, giving him a sad smile.
Dean swiped the tears from his face with the back of his hand. “Cas I’ve been running on empty for so long, it’s like I went numb or something. It’s the only thing that kept me goin’. I’m only just realising that the feelings were there all along, but I buried ‘em. I think Michael did something to me, he took away something and now I’m feeling everything again. It’s too much all at once.” he sagged as his greatest fear and the reason for his erratic behaviour in the last few months finally came out.
Almost all of the guards had run towards the gates at the commotion and Castiel took his chance, darting out from behind the truck and ducking into the wooden building, it's door left half open in the tall Alphas haste to check on the commotion. He took a shaky breath and surveyed the room, letting his eyes adjust to the dark.
Cas nodded and it seemed an actual effort for him to slow down and savour the food. The medicine was beginning to kick in and the combination of warm food and poppy syrup took its toll as his eyes began to droop. He tried to fight it, but the second time the bowl almost slipped from his fingers Bobby intervened. “I think you might be done, boy. Take a nap and I'll take a look at your info, we'll finish up our chat when you wake up.” he said quietly as he took the bowl from Cas' loose grip. Cas couldn't even answer as he slumped down, falling asleep almost immediately.
Mary smiled. “There, see? It doesn’t have to be hard. There’s nothing we can’t do if we put our heads together.” she said brightly.
“Stay on your front, it’s easier for you, this first time.” Cas murmured. “I won’t hurt you, it’ll be good, I promise.” he said, kissing the side of Deans neck with small feather light kisses.
Dean's heart hurt for Cas. He longed to comfort him and words were not his forte. He'd never felt so inadequate.
Jess smiled “Yes I am. But it helps that you are otherwise strong and healthy. You would have most certainly died otherwise.” she said, pulling out a pot of strange smelling ointment.
Cas thought about his own siblings and considered whether his relationship with them could be improved with a lot of alcohol. It was certainly something to think about, and he said so to Jo, who laughed so hard that Dean clutched his head and whined.
He had pulled Jess aside and told her that the subtle approach was wasted on Sam, if she wanted him, she'd have to be blatant about it. She had stepped it up, Sam had finally noticed her and flirted back, and now poor Bobby and Garth were drowning in UST.
reason for forced matings, but it was a partial explanation. He often wondered why it was different for Omegas, they didn't suffer the same physical reaction when the Alpha died. Maybe one day someone would figure it out, probably long after his time.
“That's just one of the perks” she smiled as Sam waved back “Now, shush and let's get bundled under these blankets so we can keep my patient warm.”
Dean smiled and began smoothing the blankets distractedly, tucking the Alpha in snugly, prompting Cas to immediately wreck them by pulling his arms free. Neither commented on the silent battle over the blankets as Dean replied “We're still a couple of hours out from Bobby's. There used to be a city here, some place called Sioux falls, been flooded a couple of hundred years or so now though.” He began arranging the blankets around the Alpha again, making Cas huff in irritation as he once again pulled his arms free and swatted at Dean's hands as he automatically tried to straighten the blankets again.
Bobby Singer liked the quiet life. He liked his porch where he would sit in his old rocker of an evening, drinking a home brew or some of his semi-famous moonshine and contemplating. He liked his office, chock full of books from before the collapse, a stockpile of lost information (He had learned damn near everything he knew from these books). He liked his engineering shed, tinkering away at pre-collapse technology until he knew how it worked and could replicate it if needed. He liked his impressive collection of salvage, old cars and technology piled high in an organised chaos that only Bobby truly understood.
Balthazar continued “It split the clan, people who once spat on you for your beliefs were suddenly ready to kill their nearest and dearest to avenge your death. Others sided with Michael, wanting to wait Lucifer out. Some left the clan right then and there, wanting to opt out altogether. It was a mess. I knew then I had to get Hannah out, so Alfie and I grabbed her and whatever we could carry and fled. I sneaked back a couple of days later and by then more than half of the clan were dead, including Michael and Raphael, or they'd run away. Uriel triple-crossed everyone and led a purge on all who opposed him. The fools following him either don't realise that they've done Lucifer's work for him, or they don't care. Uriel played everyone, including his own brother. There is no-one left to fight Lucifer.”
He returned an hour later, face shaved and shirtless, with a handful of wet bandages and a sheepish look on his face.
“Not today. Like I said, I don't think what he did was right. But I understand loss. We've all lost people, it hurts and it never goes away. Grief does funny things to ya. But it don't excuse hurtin' other innocent people just so you can get your revenge. He lost sight of that and I think he gets that now. If he wants a chance to start over, I ain't gonna stand in the way of that.” she replied, before turning to attempt to get Cas to drink some water.
Less than five minutes later Dean and Jo came back from the pantry with a small bag of supplies and a large flask of water. Dean stifled a chuckle at Cas standing awkwardly with the rest of the group, trying his best not to seem threatening to the traumatised Omegas. Charlie seemed to be holding up well, but Amy looked like she was about to pass out. Her injuries from the beating she had received were still fresh and her breathing was slightly laboured.
Jess had given Cas some more poppy syrup and he was once again asleep, Dean had nodded off a little while after and Jess was drifting somewhere between asleep and awake. Just as the sun began to go down, all three were startled awake by Bobby hitting the horn loudly as he made a sharp turn onto the road leading to the homestead.
Dean grinned. “Spear fishing? Cool.” he said, sipping the soda and grimacing. “Urgh, When am I allowed to drink one of those beers?” he asked no-one in particular.
“We need some fresh water boiled and some more poppy syrup. Jess and Ellen are just finishing sewing him up now. I'll let Jess fill you in on the rest.” with that she left the tent to go wash her hands.
Sam smiled. “Then there's glamping, a kind of romanticised version of camping, but with hot showers, hair straighteners and Wi-Fi.” he chuckled.
Hanging off the side and tangled in the mic lead by the optic nerve, was the bandits ruined eyeball.
Dean smiled at Ellen, she was in her element. Running the roadhouse gave her the experience at feeding a lot of people and handling drunks. Between her and Jo, the hungry masses were fed three times a day. Charlie had taken over the radio duties and had actually made the system more efficient. Amy's experience in trapping and skinning came in useful for feeding so many. The skins and furs were hung out to dry on the top floor of the barn.
Benny also took an interest when Cas began to incorporate some sort of martial art into his exercise, Jess had forbidden any sparring for the time being, so Cas performed a few Katas and battle drills by himself until Dean too found himself following the movements. Before long, everyone except Bobby and Ellen found themselves on the lawn after breakfast each morning, learning the precise but fluid movements that Cas used.
Dean laughed. “It was your bright idea, Santa. One of your best, I'll admit. Did you see his little face? Oh my God, Cas, he was over the moon.” he said, sipping his wine.
Dean unzipped the opening to his tent and peered out. His face was still puffy from sleep and he had a serious case of bed head.
Most clans lived in fear of raids and lived in highly defended settlements. Some clans moved periodically, trying to stay ahead of the rogue clans and protect their Omegas.
“It won't be a problem, brother.” Benny's voice stated from behind them, making them all jump. “Sorento was a nasty sonovabitch, but he wasn't too smart. Always was too busy tryin' to keep his position as the old man's second and worried about someone killin' him off to get it. He was so paranoid, he never shared where he would be workin'. Nobody knows he was here, they won't even know where to start lookin' once he shows up missin'. Not that anyone will miss him that much. He really was a sonovabitch.”
“But is it romantic if we agree on it first? Kind of defeats the purpose, doesn’t it? Hamm, I really do need to think about this one.” Dean pondered aloud.
“Oh, uh..” Cas started, but struggled to think of anything to say. Dean rarely saw the angel as flustered as he was currently.
“Bobby, I'm real grateful for your offer, but your place attracts visitors. You keep everyone informed of rogue clan movements, that means you get info from all types. Not the types I want around my boys. The only way I've kept 'em safe so far is by keeping our heads down and moving before interest can be stirred up with the wrong people.” John sighed and ran a hand down his face, before continuing. “I don't like it either, but it's better than the alternative. If anyone from a rogue clan heard about the two male Omegas at your place, we'd all have targets painted on our backs. I'll die before I see my boys as slaves. We'll trade the extra meat for dry stores and me and the boys will head out to Rufus's cabin before the snow hits. Only we know about it, so we should be safe for the winter.”
“Boy, I ain't reached the ripe old age of never-you-mind without knowin' a trick or two. No such thing as too much when it comes to weapons. Now, I believe the words yer lookin' for are 'thank you Bobby'.” the older Alpha snapped as he climbed back down from the truck.
He smiled and sipped his beer as Bobby added mischievously “Didn't you nail that gate shut after that?”
He looked up, trying to see the person at the top, but whoever it was, had no lantern and was invisible in the darkness.
“I didn't tell you because I knew you would not trust me if you knew I came from a clan that trades Omegas. Especially after what you had been through. Please believe me, I intended to see you all home safely and then be on my way. I had no other agenda. Now that I...” his voice broke and he looked visibly upset. He took a breath and continued “You have all been so kind to me, I consider you all my friends. I felt that I would be betraying you if I kept this from you any longer.
Sam ran his fingers over the new bite mark where his neck met his shoulder, it had stopped stinging now and had begun to heal over already. Jess smiled at him from the other side of Bobby's workshop as she too ran her fingers over her matching bite. The bond was already strong and close proximity to each other was making them almost drunk from the influx of bonding hormones flooding their systems. For the next few weeks it would be almost painful to separate for any length of time, it would ease off eventually, allowing them longer periods of time apart, but even sitting on opposite sides of the room was like a physical ache right now. Jess gathered up the project she had been working on and cleared it away, not able to go any longer without at least scenting Sam. Joining him at the bench where Sam had been making wooden roof shingles, she wrapped her arms around his waist from behind and stood on tip toe to kiss him on the back of the neck, scenting him deeply as she did so. Sam twisted around in her arms and wrapped his arms around Jess, dropping his head into her neck to scent her too. The shiver that went through both of them made them both sigh as they clung to each other almost desperately.
Sam watches as Cas closes the door behind him, and suddenly Sam in a room filled with children, three of them if Jack is counted. Jack looks pained, looking at Marion and DJ, he wants to stop all of it to stop their pain, but he doesn't know how.
Everyone in the room is startled and flinches when Jack comes bursting into the room with numerous fast food bags. Jack's greeting dies on his lips when he catches sight of the two strangers sitting on the couch. Jack's head did a little tilt, something that he'd picked up from observing Cas for so long, his gaze trained on Marion.
"I still think that we should go to that poetry thing, right now it's our best lead, rather it's our only lead right now, it starts in 20 minutes maybe we'll get lucky" Sam urged as he started to pack up his things.
"The summary? Have Naomi go back in time, steal Dean's stuff from the fertility clinic, go to the alternate universe, impregnant strangers that would be most likely to give up children for adoption, have us grow up in foster care for at least 10 years, Naomi figured out foster family's made of hunters so while we grew up around humans we started our training pretty much as soon as we could walk. Hand to hand combat and traditional weapons. Naomi removed us from Foster care when I was ten to further training from an Angel's perspective and so start preparing us more thoroughly for the mission which of course she didn't explain to the fullest extent until shortly before we came to this world, which was probably a good thing because we would have tried to get out of it, but it's too late for that, the ball is already in motion." Marion expressed while DJ continued to remain quiet, Dean feels like it's like looking at two parts of his personality sitting side by side, it's a little unsettling.
Castiel was nothing if not persistent. When he got his head on about something, he pursued it until he got an answer. Dean should have learned that by now.
As he closed in on the gates, he sent out a message on Angel Radio to the archangels, calling for an emergency meeting along with Kelly. If she was involved, they would know it was about Jack.
He knew of them, of course. But, he never thought about experiencing them. Getting to go to school for a year, itself, had been a miracle.
“I mean, unless you want the full high school experience, you wouldn’t miss out on much,” said Kaia. “You probably like the learning part more.”
There was a poltergeist wreaking havoc at a church in Montana. A priest had died and several others were injured when several statues in the church exploded on its parishioners during an evening mass.
The clogs in Dean’s brain turned as he figured out where Castiel was getting at. “So… they took some angels back? And demons?”
The second day went just like the first day – pacing, movies with Dean, and a breath of relief when they picked up Jack.
Castiel picked up his own burger and took a bite. As expected… molecules. He could never taste anything. Yet, Dean always seemed to forget. Or chose to ignore it as he would pile Castiel with food, especially if he made it. But, although he wasn’t able to taste the food, Castiel always made sure to show his enthusiasm for it because it boosted Dean’s morale and confidence and Castiel liked seeing him happy.
He chose the school for that little tidbit. If the students had such strong convictions and beliefs, there was so much Jack could learn from them.
It felt like the war room was further than it actually was but, finally, they made it. Everyone had already chosen their own seats around the table but both heads were left empty. The map table, itself, was heaped with so much food that Dean wondered how they managed to make room for the plates.
Dean flashed him an exasperated yet fond look. “Yeah, well, I think, having all of us here, together, sharing a meal and celebrating Thanksgiving, is kind of a miracle, itself. You know, we consider all of you family and… um…”
"When you looked 21. Now, you look just like any other kid who just reached puberty so we're treating you like one, got it?"
How did you get out of the Empty? Was there a way all along and they hadn’t known? Why didn't he back come sooner?
Hope sparkled in her eyes, now. Castiel felt like he was intruding in a moment between the two so he excused himself and headed for the refreshments table. The chaperones were all told to check the punch every now and to ensure that the students hadn’t added alcohol to the concoction so Castiel did just that. He ladled some punch into a plastic cup and took a sip. Even if he could only taste the molecules, Castiel could tell that the flavor of punch was bland but it lacked any alcohol content so he deemed it safe for the children. He finished the cup and threw it away before turning back to check on Dean and Miss Johnson.
At that, she laughed and kissed his chin. “Me too.” Then, she looked down at her lap. “This life though… it’s not for raising kids. At least, kids who won’t end up like us.”
“But, I’m glad that this chapter is closed,” continued the boy, oblivious to their concerns as he stared at his hands on his lap. “I think mom would be happy. And they can finally have peace.”
“It’s okay,” signed Eileen, with a smile. “I understand. And we’re not in a rush. We have all the time in the world, now, Sam.”
On any other day, Dean would stand here and argue. But, seeing as they had a lot of cooking to do for the rest of the afternoon, he settled for sending Jody another glare, which she laughed at (the audacity of this woman!) before barking an order to get started on mixing the spices.
Within seconds, Sam comes into view. He looks awful. The mop that he calls hair looks like it hasn’t been brushed in days. The dark circles under his eyes are even darker like he’s some kind of giant raccoon. And his clothes are the same ones he wore during their hunt.
“But, Jack, we can’t tell them the exact circumstance of how your mother died,” said Castiel, gently.
“Send them in, please,” replied a voice. It sounded strict and authoritative – and not the fun kind.
Dean held out his hand in a silent request for Sam to hand his gun over to him. Sam tossed it to him and then retrieved a knife from his back pocket.
He showered, got dressed in clothes he chose the night before, packed up his brand new backpack, and skipped out into the hall towards the kitchen. The unmistakable scent of breakfast tickled his nose as he entered.
“Well, there’s Balthazar… Hannah… Samandriel… Rachel… Anna… Hael… Gadreel… And many others that we knew Jack could trust.”
“It’s alright. We won’t punish you. You’ll be punished enough with detention. But, please, do not smoke marijuana and share your life story with the others in detention.”
Lowering his eyes with shame, Gabriel shook his head. “He’s not dad,” he said, with less vitriol this time. “He won’t leave us just like that. Not the way he did.”
Jack told her everything that happened since then – her brother’s betrayal and lies, the erasure of humanity, and the Winchesters risking it all to save the world one last time. And when he told her that he now had Chuck's powers, she had been surprised yet pleased. She told him that even though she loved her brother, it was finally time for him to get knocked off his pedestal.
They didn’t have to wait long. Jack ambled out through the doors, backpack behind him, lunchbox in one hand, and a heavy-looking textbook in the other. He noticed Dean looking pointedly at the book.
They both watched as Kaia joined Jack and Sam at the table, sitting on Jack’s other side. She peeked at his notebook, nodding along and listening to Sam lecturing. Jack appeared thrilled at her company and began to talk about what he learned, eager to show off his knowledge.
“We are giving Jack one year to do what he wishes. He can stay on Earth, go to school, whatever he wants. And, after a year, you and he will return here and resume your duties. He will be the Winchesters’ responsibility and you will act as his messenger, Castiel. We expect monthly reports on his health and how he’s coping. If he is, at any point at all, in danger, or his true nature is discovered, you will both return to Heaven, immediately.”
After partaking in the apple pie for dessert, Sam volunteered to help Castiel with the dishes while Eileen spent quality time with Miracle.
He turned his head to see Castiel looking like he wanted to disagree but a smile was tugging at the angel’s lips.
So, when he awakened from his nightmares, delirious and regretful from watching Jimmy sacrifice his life to save his daughter, the heavy weight of his wings was the first thing he acknowledged. He nearly cried from joy. Next was the fact that he was in his true form and not his vessel. It was strange, at first, as he hadn’t been in this form in so long but it felt good, like stretching muscles that had been stiff for so long. And the last was seeing Jack, his son, welcoming him with a wide smile and open arms. His son whom he didn’t think he would see again. It was, indubitably, a joyous moment.
He had said it so much this night alone that Castiel knew he couldn’t ignore it any longer. There was a reason Jack ran away from Heaven. And there was a reason he didn’t want to go back. As his chosen father, Castiel was supposed listen. And he didn’t. Jack reacted, as he was entitled to. But, Castiel would listen, now.
At first, Mr. Klein managed a smile, elated at the information. But, then, seeing the photos, his face crumbled once more. He reached out for a photo of a pregnant Kelly while his wife grabbed the cardigan and hugged it to her chest.
Sam didn’t mean to have it all spilling out. He didn’t want to worry Jack any more than he needed to be. But, he rarely expressed how deep his worry and concern for Dean really was. Sometimes, he would talk to Jody about it but she already had four of her own to worry about, he didn’t want to add one more. He could talk to Bobby but, no matter how hard he tried, he just wasn’t the same as their Bobby.
“No, no, you’re not overstepping. I’m grateful that you and your brother are there for him. I just… I feel somewhat… useless.”
So he told himself as he struggled to breathe through his nose as he followed Sam out of the kitchen and back to the war room. His brother threw him a few looks over his shoulder but the glare Dean sent him shut him about offering his help.
The hunter felt himself go cold at that, a lump in his throat forming. He didn’t want to think of Castiel being gone tomorrow. They just got him back.
Castiel’s lips twitched, a smile threatening to show itself. But, then, he schooled his face back to inquisitive and approached Dean, taking the seat beside him.
Quietly, the older Winchester stood up, headed for the kitchen counters, and snagged two knives. Sam followed behind him, taking the second knife Dean wordlessly offered.
“Hello! Can I interest you, gentlemen, in our homemade honey?” greeted an older woman with graying hair in a bun and large round glasses. She spread her hands over her wares, proudly displaying them.
“Dean? Are you okay?” Castiel placed a hand over his knee under the table, flashing him a worried look. “Do you not like the food? But, that’s impossible, you cooked it.”
“Yeah, of course,” he signed to her. “By the way, thanks for getting all this together. I wish I could have helped.”
But, there was a part of him… a very small part of him… that still questioned if what he was feeling was something worth exploring or if it was simply the result of a selfish desire to keep Castiel around
Jack and Jack seemed to return the sentiment. Sometimes, when Dean passed by Jack’s room, he could hear Jack talking to the dog, having an actual conversation with him. It was endearingly cute, if not a bit odd. But, then again, Jack had always been an odd duck. He got it from his dad (not Lucifer).
The couple left, hand-in-hand, Eileen with a slight bounce to her steps. She was so small next to Sam but Castiel knew that behind that small stature was a strength that rivaled a thousand bulls. He was glad that she and Sam found each other. She was good for him. And it helped that Dean stopped worrying when the two were together.
So, Jack had auditioned and, somehow, got the role of the angel Gabriel in the Christmas segment. Mr. Turner said something about there being an “angelic” demeanor to Jack’s acting. Meanwhile, Jack had no idea that his uncle had such a pivotal role in the birth of a holiday. It was a mystery why he never told Jack about it. After all, Uncle Gabe loved to brag.
Another one of Dean’s regrets. Leaving a newly human Castiel to fend for himself, not even trying to fight harder to keep him around. Even though he had been forgiven, the guilt would always follow Dean for the rest of his life.
He started to move away but Castiel’s hand flew to grab his hand before the hunter could take another step.
Eileen bit her lip. “I… well… I’d be lying if I said it didn’t cross my mind, sometimes. I just didn’t think it was something I could have… or something that you want.”
Finally, after what felt like forever, Dean, Sam, Castiel, and Eileen lowered their phones. One by one, they stepped forward to give him goodbye hugs and Eileen kissed his temple.
It wasn’t until he was grilling the burgers that he realized that Castiel never answered his first question.
“You know, some people say what they’re thankful for during Thanksgiving dinner. We didn’t really get to do that.”
Dean shared updates on his work at the Garage and how he might be up for a promotion pretty soon. Castiel talked about his bees and how smart his co-workers were for their ideas of honey flavors.
“He dresses like you,” Castiel observed. “Or is it that you dress like him? Why is he so angry at that athletic boy? They don’t seem to like each other at all.”
Dean hummed again. “I’m thankful… that you and Jack are back home with us. I’m thankful… that we survived. I’m thankful…”
“I still don’t get it. Did Jack just change everything? And you still haven’t said how you got out.”
“Dean, are you alright?” He felt Castiel’s hand wrap around his arm and he met the angel’s eyes of concern.
For a moment, Dean felt himself freeze in place as he took it all in. There was something about the scene that made him not want to tear his eyes away.
But, he couldn’t help but worry about Dean, too. Right now, his brother didn’t have a partner. And, he didn’t seem interested in having one, either. Dean hadn’t hooked up or flirted with anyone in ages. And Sam didn’t want to be one of those younger brothers that were all up in their older brother’s business. Maybe Dean preferred to be single. But, Sam didn’t want him to be alone.
Dean kept his ear out for the two cosmic beings, not wanting them to hear this very chick flick conversation.
“Before he is God, he is our nephew,” retorted Gabriel, his eyes narrowing at his older brother. “Shouldn’t we want to put his happiness, first?”
Castiel placed a tentative hand over his and, to Dean’s surprise, he didn’t mind the touch. Castiel was a warm furnace against his freezing cold skin.
Still... he couldn't help but wish that Jack did see him as a father. Because Dean certainly saw him as a son.
Dean cleared his throat again. “That’s… that’s good. Happy for Rowena. She almost killed us when she found out Crowley died. At least she finally got everything she always wanted. Did you know she left all of her witchy stuff to Sam? He brought them all back here from her apartment. Has a room for them and everything. I can show you later.”
No, they wouldn’t have done that. And Dean would have never forgiven himself if Castiel had returned and realized they had abandoned Jack. He barely forgave himself for treating Jack the way he did.
It stirred something in Dean. He felt like he was intruding in a moment, yet, he couldn’t look away.
“No.” Dean pinned him with a glare. “Lisa is a chapter I’ve closed a long time ago. She has her own life now and I’m not stupid enough to go back and mess it up for her again.”
Dean pursed his lips, thoughtfully. For the longest time, he stayed silent and Sam was too afraid that something would break in the silence if he spoke. So, he clamped his mouth shut and waited. His eye subtly wandered to the papers on the desk, trying to read it.
And Dean wasted no time meeting his lips. The action surprised Castiel so much that he took an involuntary step back, the edge of the counter pressing against his back.
Dean grabbed a box of bowtie pasta. He could just mix these up with some of his homemade tomato sauce, they still had a couple of jars left in the fridge.
Sam briefly shot them a grin before following the kid to what appeared to be a thrift store. (Dean released a sigh of relief at this. He had nothing against name-brand stores and they could pretty much afford anything now with their limitless credit cards, but it was the principle of the thing!)
Before Jack could ask her what she was thinking, Castiel’s echoing voice broke through his subconscious.
“Damn, never thought I’d see you guys act like this.” Claire sidled up to him and pressed her back to the wall, too.
“I’m just spending time with Miracle. We’re watching a movie called ‘Air Bud.’ He seems to be enjoying it. It has other dogs in it. Would you like to speak to him?”
Just as Dean pulled up to the drop-off queue, Jack remembered. “Oh, I don’t have baseball practice today. Thanksgiving break and all.”
For a moment, Sam wished he could take it back. But, it was out there now. He just had to brace himself.
“Well, it matters to me!” Dean snapped. “Okay? And I am happy. I got Sam and Jack and you. I couldn’t ask for anything else. Except, maybe a million bucks so we can finally take that beach vacation.”
Jack had raised his head fully now, looking thunderstruck. His lips were parted, as if he wanted to say something but can’t figure out the words.
How could he even begin to explain this? He couldn’t tell her the truth. The truth was all kinds of crazy! And he was doing so well here. He was living a normal life. And he didn’t want the Winchesters and Castiel’s efforts to ensure his identity was secure to go to waste.
Squaring his shoulders, he went back to his friend, trying not to look like he had almost just had a heart attack.
By the time he was finished cleaning up and getting dressed, noises downstairs and a cooing of Miracle’s name indicated that Castiel was back from the store.
He was sure the food was as delicious as Dean claimed. After all, Dean took food, seriously. Besides, Sam, Jack, and even Mary back when she was still here all loved Dean’s cooking.
But, if Sam continued sending him that smirk every time he said, “Hey, Cas,” Dean was gonna chop his hair off while he slept.
Sure, Dean still had trouble expressing his feelings (thanks for that, Dad). He rarely even said the words that Castiel freely expressed. But, the advantage of them having their so-called profound bond was that he didn’t need to really say anything for his partner to know how he truly felt about him.
Less than a week later, Dean found himself outside of Jack’s school, wearing one of his nicer FBI suits, sans the tie.
“What about the angels?” Raphael spoke up, in a low voice. “Are we keeping this a secret from them?”
“We don’t have to make any big decisions like this now,” she signed to him. “Let’s just focus on finding a place for us, first, okay?” A look of doubt crossed her face. “Do you still want to move in together?”
To his surprise, Castiel shakes his head and lets out a chuckle. “No, the paramedics did. Sam called them as soon as I arrived after you lost consciousness.”
Castiel’s hands were folded on top of the table and his back was straight. Next to his hand, his cup of pistachio ice cream was beginning to melt.
“You’ve never done this before, Cas,” continued Dean. “I raised Sammy so I’ve got some idea. And I helped out with Ben when I lived with Lisa and I didn’t even know what to do, at first. It just takes some adjusting. Just because you don’t know how to do these things for him right now doesn’t mean you're a bad dad.”
Dean muttered curses under his breath as he tried to maneuver to an empty spot. Castiel found one and pointed it out so Dean squeezed in and parked.
“Not yet. But, if you make the team, you will be. Like Zayn. With the jacket and everything.” She snorted. “I can’t believe I ended up friends with jocks in high school. If only middle school Casey could see me now. She’d be so disgusted.”
This angel who saved him. This angel who taught him to believe and have faith. This angel who loves him despite his faults and mistakes.
“I was thinking mac and cheese,” Dean replied as he folded up the grocery bags to be re-used for later.
After lunch, Dean went back to his show and Castiel to his book. This time, both were in the living room. Miracle interrupted them at some point, begging Dean to play, to which he obliged and they played a half hour’s worth of fetch. Then, it was back to his show.
Jack looked more or less the same as they saw him last, a year ago. Same tousled dark blonde hair, same white jacket and light blue jeans that Sam remembered getting for him at Walmart, and the same shy, innocent smile that reminded everyone about how young he actually was despite his physical appearance.
He turned to Castiel and found the angel looking contemplatively at a rack of shirts. Dean, then, remembered that Sam suggested that Castiel get some things for himself, too.
With a huff, Dean got to his feet. “Alright, fine. Whatever. Finish your breakfast.” He grabbed two pieces of bacon and angrily stuffed them in his mouth as he left the kitchen.
Dean resisted the urge to facepalm. Instead, he cleared his throat. “So, is that it? Can we take Jack home now?”
“Did you even hear my prayers?” Dean’s voice cracked but he couldn’t find it in himself to care, too lost in the memories of the past year.
“Cas… I don’t know about… about how I feel. Like you said, it’s complicated and I’ve never…” He swallowed again. “But, know this one thing, okay? I want you and Jack here. Don’t ever think that you’re not allowed to be here. This is your home and we are your family. Okay?”
Dean entered the room, going straight for the bed. “We gotta clean this place up, Sammy,” he stated, brushing a finger across the side table and grimacing at how much dust accumulated on the digit. “Send the kid out to walk Miracle or something. Can you grab his stuff from storage?”
Jack watched as Dean ambled over to Castiel, who gave the mug of coffee one more stir before handing it over to the hunter with a, “Good morning, Dean.”
The angel wondered if Dean was always this polite with a potential lover. Not that he was Dean’s lover or anything. They hadn’t even placed a label on what they had. Granted, it had only been days ago that Dean confessed and agreed to give Castiel time to think about whether he wanted this to go further.
The kid looked hopefully at his surrogate father. He was practically bouncing on his feet – from nerves or excitement, Dean wasn’t sure. But, looking at Castiel’s face, the angel seemed to hesitate, unsure of the importance of this request.
Eileen chuckled again. “He texts me about what happens at school, sometimes. It sounds like he’s really fitting in.”
He laughed at her and shook his head. As she disappeared from view, he joined the other three at their table. They watched him as he took a seat across from Jack.
Castiel shook his head as he sat down on Jack’s empty place next to Dean. “I’m alright, thank you. I will wait until everyone finishes.”
Once he had chosen a school, Sam forged all his necessary documents and he and Castiel went and got Jack enrolled. He met the Vice Principal and answered a few questions for her about his schooling and upbringing. (According to the story Dean and Sam concocted for him, he was homeschooled by his mother until her death and his custody was given to Castiel, his paternal uncle.)
Jack put his code in, gave the door a little slam, and waited patiently as it slowly opened for him. He quickly swapped his books, double-checking his little planner to ensure that he had everything he needed. Then, he turned to the photo taped to his locker door.
“So… you’re okay with this?” Sam asked. “You’re not worried about… I don’t know… Repercussions from Heaven? He
When everyone was in the kitchen again, they made the pizzas. Dean filled his pizza with so much pepperoni, ham, and sausage that he feared it would be too heavy and take more time to cook. Meanwhile, Sam had used his own low-fat cheese on his (the heathen!) and topped it with mostly vegetables – peppers, mushrooms, and onions. Castiel stuck to just cheese.
“Okay,” Jack responded but he didn’t sound like he believed Castiel, at all. “But, I’m selfish, aren’t I? For asking this?”
And then, finally, gathering everything he needed to summon a demon and driving to the nearest crossroads. Sam managed to stop him, pleading with him not to do it. It was a bad idea, he said, Castiel and Jack wouldn’t want him to do this. Sam would personally call Rowena and put a stop to the deal if he had to.
Dean carved the turkey and wine bottles were passed around several times. Jack talked a mile a minute about school to anyone who managed to catch his eye. Garth finagled Eileen into a conversation about the best ways to dispose of a body. Gertie regaled Alex and Patience with a tale about how her brothers almost bit off the mailman’s fingers when their teeth started coming in. Sam looked to be in a serious talk with Jody about managing a Hunter’s Network and Bobby chimed in, despite how far away he was. The babies cooed, babbled, and shrieked. Miracle prowled under the table, hoping to catch some scraps.
Downing the freshly ordered whiskey, he groans at the song beginning to play over the chatters of the rest of the bar.
"Cas!" Dean runs around the bunker like an idiot, dodging corners and door knobs, speeding his way to catch up with the surprisingly quick angel.
They keep planting small, warm, yet deep kisses on each other, focusing on just the feeling and need of the other. When Cas’s moans get louder, and his stomach tenses, and his mouth lingers open, Dean whispers comfortingly.
And so Dean does just that. He plants his lips on Castiel’s for the first time in weeks, maybe months. They act slow, still both weary and a bit uncomfortable with each other. The kiss is soft, mostly consisting of light grazes. Then Dean feels two hands very lightly press against his hips, holding him. Dean uses this as confirmation that he can move his own hands up to Cas’s shoulders, wrapping his arms behind his neck. It feels new all over again, except now, the pricking of stubble doesn't freak him out. Insead, it’s welcomed because it reminds him that this is the man he truly wants.
