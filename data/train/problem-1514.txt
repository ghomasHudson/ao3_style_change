<< Oh, please! >> exclaims Sherlock, rolling his eyes.
John punches the inspector's desk, causing a few sheets to fly across the floor.
<< No. I closed myself when I didn't want to be found. I had a secret hiding place in the kitchen >> he replies, thinking back to the door poised on broken hinges.
<< Forget it >> John says, grabbing the two colored bottles.
He tries several times to start a conversation, but every attempt dies on his lips. The pain of Sherlock is so contained but at the same time desperate. He is holding the letter Mary wrote to him, dedicating her last thoughts to him. A writing as a small child, full of grammatical errors to make the skin crawl and a sincere love to tighten the heart.
<< A nightmare. A damned nightmare >> John mumbles, rubbing his lips on which he still feels the pressure of those of the creepy woman.
<< And is it really so frequent that people meet there for other kinds of health benefits too? >>.
<< You talk about it as if you know them well >>.
<< Your opinion, John? >>.
<< Fox? What are you doing here? >> Greg asks him too jumped up.
Sherlock follow the footprints to the entrance of the building. The door is open, wide open. The precious carpet of the large living room has been dirtied by footprints of excited run. It will remain stained forever.
<< To my dolls. I have five of them in my bedroom and they listen to me and make the nightmare go away >>.
<< Mark told me that he double-checked the test he did to me at the beginning and found out it was wrong. I don't have the necessary requirements to stay in the group >>.
<< I didn't talk about emotional involvement, John >>.
<< I think it is better that I go >> he says, getting up from the sofa on which they sat down, after a day spent outside the city, with the only positive note of having escaped the bad downpour that hit London.
<< No, we don't talk about it. I dared too much. Is there any news? >> asks him, turning the conversation elsewhere.
<< Really? >> Mycroft asks incredulously.
“Who cares, Johnny? Are you happy? Then it's okay! " retorts Harriet in John's head. His sister was very present in his thoughts. From the moment they found Rosaline's body and, unlike the pangs in the stomach totally cured by Sherlock's kisses and caresses, Harry's voice persists. Evidently she has something more to say to him. John does not like the idea of getting out of the warm bed and the scent of Sherlock that surrounds him, but he feels he must end this story.
A small thing with an indecipherable color and big trembled eyes was wrapped in Sherlock's scarf. The same small thing who now wanders around their living room wagging his tail.
<< Do you think it's the continuation of the crazy game in which Moriarty involved Sherlock last month? >>.
<< You have no fault, Lizzy. The faults are of those men and women who have set up all this mess >> John try to remedy.
Sherlock will have the opportunity to meet the sauna master during this Aufguss, which seems to be the good news of the moment.The event is more than an hour away and Sherlock allows himself to rest his head on the bench and close his eyes.
"Exactly" Moriarty applauds him, laughing. "This is how it works, my dear. They use you for their comfort and then throw you away. Like a broken toy. Like a filthy whore. "
<< Greg is not only that. It seems to me that I understood that he ... saved your life >>.
<< Mum keeps the important things here >> says the child, coming down from Sherlock's back to run to the first drawer of the desk. He pulls it but it is locked << Uff! >> snorts.
<< Even the case on which Mr Holmes had been called to investigate is frozen, like everything around here. Gentlemen, I advise you to return to London. Here you can not do anything except look at your hands in front of the fire for the next few days >>.
<< Yes >> retorts John. Mycroft sighs producing a long hiss. As if he was trying to stay calm, although he doesn't seem like he is going to lose it.
<< But you're not a detective. You're a doctor >> chuckles the woman, who obviously does not realize how much John's anger is growing.
<< If it is not Mr Ford, who would be the kidnapper's aims? >> asks the man, astonished.
The child leans against Sherlock and holds the puppy in his arms.
<< She ... her name is Molly >> he says and his stomach twists.
"I destroyed something beautiful, ”thought John, before opening that damned mouth and giving voice to the most senseless, useless and painful speech he've ever had. Every time he raised his eyes to meet Sherlock, he saw his face ever more astonished, incredulous. Each time it was a stab in the heart and, although John wondered why he was doing all this, he failed to stop. He could says that was a joke and that he wanted to make fun of him. They could have pretended to quarrel for a while and end the argument with some great morning sex. No. John went on, despite Sherlock's silence, despite wanting to ask him to say something. And it was devastating when Sherlock finally said something.
<< In fact, it was clear enough to tell me that he doesn't trust me >>.
Sherlock takes the razor in his hand and rejoices in realizing how much stronger his grip is now. At the base of the blade there is a layer of what seems to being encrusted blood. Sherlock's stomach closes in disgust and not only from the idea of having to use a dirty razor and not even being able to try to clean it, for fear of unleashing her anger. Sherlock's stomach closes with the idea of how that blood got there. For some days now he has been accepting the deduction, so far put aside, that he is not the first to have had the good fortune of being rescued and treated by Mary. That object and its sad layer of dirt are bringing more evidence in favor of its terrible thesis.
<< I have adjusted them by adapting them to your size. If you had had a jacket and elegant trousers in your clothes, I would have spared myself the trouble. Fortunately, you have at least one decent white shirt >> Sherlock says. << The good thing is that you will have to wear it only to stage our arrival >>.
<< Ah >> replies his father. << What does this mean? >>.
"Aren't you afraid of death, then?" Moriarty asks incredulously.
<< Do you allow me to choose? >> asks John.
Sherlock just gives him a look.
"How selfish you are!" continues his sister. "You have been literally have women of all colors since you are here. Sherlock is the first time that ...".
Sherlock feels no pain. He tries to defend himself as he can, using the trolley as a shield, but very little coverage guarantees that small weapon. Mary is on another planet. Release her fury, that's what she does, and Sherlock just has to resist.
<< One to whom I do not create problems >> retorts, taking his suitcase.
<< There are so many things to throw them in jail for life >> Greg nods. << You know well, however, that I will have to report and do not want to hear about exclusive journalism and similar bullshit, Fox >>.
<< Even the ice burns. More than fire. And it's more sneaky and do you know why? >> asks Sherlock. He almost seems to see Moriarty sitting in a corner in the darkness of this hole. << Because ice before killing someone warms it up. A pleasant warmth that comes from a painful tingling. It is as if he wanted to rock before he killed. That's how I always imagined death, James. A pungent pain followed by a sweet heat, satisfying like an orgasm >>.
"Assuming she didn't bury them on his land," John thinks shivering.
Sherlock is speechless. He had already considered in his Mind Palace that possibility, also mentioned by Mycroft. Hearing it, however, put into words by John himself is quite another thing.
<< The plaster at the base of the chandelier is chipped. There are pieces of one of the chandelier's  decorative crystals broken on the ground. The bullet broken it before to got stuck in the ceiling. Judging by the sign it left, the bullet seems small ... a blank pistol >> Sherlock says.
<< Yes, Mycroft! And since I can't count on you >>, he says, grabbing the phone records abandoned on the desk, << I will conduct my investigations in another way >>. John takes one last look to Mycroft, before heading for the door. He puts his hand on the handle, but before opening it he turns back once more towards him. << Do you know, Mycroft? I really hope you are right and that I am wrong. I hope so because if it were not so, in the unfortunate hypothesis in which I am right, well ... I would not like to be in your shoes >> John goes out, taking care to slam the door.
<< He treated me like a whore, Mycroft. You can not even imagine how it feels >> he whispers, the voice broken by tears that strives to tame.
Sherlock opens his eyes and it doesn't take long for him to realize that they are in Baker street, lying on top of each other on the living room floor.
<< Yeah >> he whispers. For the first time he is agree with his sister.
<< Mary ... do you realize you are in trouble? >> John asks her direct and the woman shrugs.
"Well, as you can see he is 'on the other side'" Harry chuckles satisfied.
Sherlock winces at Mary's question. Fortunately, there are the lively eyes of her child version in her face.
<< How are you? >>.
<< I would rather say an exterminator, given the place where we are, Lestrade. The devil, as well as its opposite, are only a literary creation >>.
<< Why idiot, John? Not very careful because of alcohol and in a situation that I don't envy you at all, but why an idiot? >>.
John arrives at 221B with the mood under his heels and that pain in the abdomen more insistent than ever. He will have to take a gastric protector, otherwise he risks an ulcer, which is not a welcome prospect. He takes a long shower feeling the need for hot water to relax his neck, his shoulders contracted and to wash away his thoughts. When he comes out the bathroom, John finds the consultant sitting in his armchair. John nods and puts the kettle on.
<< Neither do I >> retorts John, standing up. << He says that he was unable to save her >>.
<< Sherlock did not reply to your messages? >> John asks in amazement.
"Yeah, let's end it!" Sherlock thinks, preparing to take the hit.
He never considered himself beautiful. His face was judged expressionless by some and by the disturbing mimicry by others and, although he persist in saying that he is disinterested in the judgment of others, these considerations still weigh today as boulders. Sherlock has always been proud, however, of his eyes and hair. The cut, the shape and the particular color of his eyes have given him many positive awards. Even when they were judged disturbing, the judgment was expressed in a fascinated tone. The eyes of the man in the mirror are circled in black, tired and frightened. The sclera of the right eye, the one involved in the blow taken to the head, is bruised with broken capillaries that make it disgusting and terrible to look at. The color of the irises, then, is a dull gray, without any hope.
John invites Lizzy to enter and she makes the soles of the heavy  amphibians resonate by moving just two steps beyond the threshold and then stopping. Finding her father and brother standing there in the center of the room has the effect of immediately snapping her up, like a cat hit by a few drops of water.
Morgan barks, attracting the attention of the three men. Sherlock looks for  him and finds the dog in front of the stairs, his nose facing upwards.
Mary's heavy footsteps muffled by the snow move away. A door is opened and then closed again. The engine starts and the van leaves.
"You fear that if you bringing women here, they might be interested in him by forgetting you, isn't it?" Harry continues in her hateful tone. John nods and runs his hand over his disconsolate face.
<< It wasn't my intention >>.
<< Sharon Milton >> says more to himself than to those present. Trampling on the sheets of paper, Sherlock approaches Greg, John and William, followed by Morgan. << Here is our winner >> he says turning the form towards them.
<< And why call it ‘Spa’ if it is a sauna? >>.
<< It is not true >> Sherlock replies, looking at him seriously.
Sherlock and John get on the cab, nervous and tense. Sherlock looks out the window, biting his lower lip so hard that it leaves ugly red marks. John puts his hand on Sherlock's closed fist. The consultant opens his hand and lets John to tighten it.
<< Yes, he has a funny name and wears a funny hat and if you also lived with him you would notice many other damn funny things >> John growls and this time the inspector also feels he has to put a hand on his arm.
<< Guys can be bad, John. I don't know if you had the misfortune of being targeted by bullies at school. I assure you that it is not a good experience >> Sherlock whispers, taking the cell phone, just touching the doctor's hands, eager to keep them to himself.
Sherlock says thet his desire is desperate, but his kisses are slowly. Kisses slow and loads of passion, so different from those of that night. John lets himself be completely overwhelmed. In the flood of emotions that he feels, he tries to take the lead, but Sherlock immediately moves away from him.
<< Not immediately >> replies the consultant. << I need to reflect on some things. Here is my number >> he says, giving him a business card. << Keep me updated on what is happening at home and call me if you need. I will put one of mine on your sister, so that he control her and prevent her from doing crazy things. What you told me is very useful for the case we are conducting together with your father. I will do everything I can to get your sister out of this situation >>.
<< I didn't behave well with Sherlock >>.
<< Honey, I assure you that it is the best compliment I could receive from him >> Greg reassures her. The smile that the detective gives to the consultant is so beautiful as to lead the latter to look away embarrassed. John realizes how important they are to each other and strangely his stomach is not pierced by any painful twinge. Indeed, he looks at them, moved and pleased. These two men so distant, but united by the love for the work they do. The constant struggle to try to bring the truth to the fore and make sure that justice is done is the quality that John lacks. John is used to obeying orders. To act even before thinking, both as a soldier and as a doctor. John realizes he has so much to learn from these men that he has the honor of being able to define friends. At least Greg for sure. As for Sherlock ...
<< Call Lestrade and get it over with >> John says to Sherlock, looking disgusted at his hands skinned by his fists.
<< Hey, don't worry what do you want to do? >> John asks him, blocking what looks like a tired attempt to get out of bed.
"Why don't you do your business?" John thinks, biting his tongue so as not to give them a voice.
<< He's right >> Sherlock confirms. << After Silver's death you noticed other oddities besides this game. Please don't leave anything out >>.
<< Oh my God! >> he exclaims, capturing the attention of the inspector, who indulges in a colorful curse when he sees the furrows on the wood, surely left by human nails.
<< A team of technicians would do better >> Greg whispers, observing the driver's seat belt which seems to have been voluntarily released.
The doctor turns up his nose unconvinced by this last joke. But he see George relaxing and taking a breath.
<< Yes, it also happened to me to take the telephone and not hear anything on the other side. Someone called and as soon as some of us answered he putted down. Mr. Ford said it was just a joke. Ms Ford, however, was seriously nervous about the thing. She had a nervous breakdown two weeks ago, when the telephon rang  every hour. She begged her husband to call the police, but he didn't want to know about it. I think that what happend it is caused by the carelessness of that man. I know that it is not good to speak in this way of my boss, but I don't care that someone kidnapped him. Ms Ford, however ... she does not deserve it >> says the cook, being moved and new tears are dried from her handkerchief. Sherlock places a hand on her shoulder and the comforting gesture takes John and Greg by surprise.
<< I didn't have to tell you ... what I said. I realize I was wrong >> John says, taking on his part of responsibility.
<< Now I think it's better you go to breakfast. I feel your stomach muttering up to here >> says John, pricking William's belly with his finger. Morgan barks by placing his paws on William's belly.
John's words come back to him. Sherlock thought that John would never address that topic. That would continue to leave it there, suspended. A way like any other to be able to dream of some possibility, which his words have instead crumbled, throwing it back into reality. Tough. Sad. Lonely. This trivial criminal investigation raised a catastrophic fuss. Sherlock doesn't know how they will come out. He acted like the usual capricious child, just to hide the sadness he felt rising from the heart.
<< I can not tell you more, I'm sorry, you know how Sherlock is about it >> John replys too roughly, must admit.
Suddenly Mary stands up and with rapid movements grabs the tray and goes to the door. Before leaving, she pauses for a moment, as if she had remembered something, then leaves the room.
<< Since returning from the pub, you mean? >> Greg asks him and John nods, carefully watching the wooden floor under the snow-wet boots. << Oh my God, it is already difficult to deal with him when he is sober, I dare not imagine when he is drunk >>.
"You have to survive, Sherlock!" John exclaims, in the captain's peremptory tone. “Your goal now is to get out of this room, save yourself from this woman. We'll think later about the rest! "
<< It is hundreds! We will take a lot of time >> says Greg.
<< Oh >> Mary whispers. << You studied it well, then >>.
<< I let him understand that I would like to meet him in private >>.
<< Oh >> says him amazed.
<< Damn idiot! >> John scout.
November 30th
<< You know Sherlock's methods. For a year you have seen him at work, you have help him to reason, you have follow him in his deductions >>.
John sniffs the air. It's the first thing Sherlock usually does when they come to a new crime scene. He come in, look around and smell the air. Sherlock is able to list one by one the smells he perceives and give each of them his exact sense of being, like a hound. John finds yet another fantastic gift of the brilliant man with whom he has the honor of living and who now tries to emulate.
<< Of course my novel are more violent, but I wonder know if she read her novel to you. Those scenes of sex and those of violence have not disturbed your soul, nor that of the members of the club, evidently >> she says, hitting a vase by the baseball bat, sending it into a thousand pieces. William, holds Morgan tight.
<< It's not a problem for you? >> John asks.
<< I don't care >>.
<< Yes, Mary had shown them to me. The day before that 'the other' took me to the pit. I had already understood that she had nothing to do with the other murders. These have given me proof >>.
<< 60 beats >> John says shaking his head. << Did you eat today? >>.
<< Are you questioning me, detective? >> asks John approaching Sherlock. Their noses almost touch each other as they observe the gleam of their eyes.
Fox is a character I created. He is the protagonist of my novel. It appeared, together with his investigative journalists colleagues, in another of my fanfictions (Hasta la verdad, siempre!) That I will publish here in the future
<< What was your rank? >>.
<< Are you really sure? >> Mycroft asks him, resting his elbows on the desk.
<< How you can use that shampoo? It smells too strong and ... >>.
The wind blows strong here in the pit. It is freezing and inclement. Scratches the skin mercilessly, like a beast. It then laughs at its misdeeds, wrapping itself in its coils, before moving on. Sherlock trembles from head to toe. He lies among the rotting corpses covered with frost, which whitens them making them even more bleak.
Sherlock's mother raises her hand to indicate a distant point. He follows its trajectory and barely perceives the sound of an engine, the clang of chains against the asphalt, the glow of two headlights cleaving the black of the night.
Baker Street. Come if you can. If you can't, it comes the same. I need you. SH
Sherlock looks at the child, that watching them attentively, pretending to pamper Morgan. The consultant go to the child and crouches down near him. Morgan doesn't waste time showing Sherlock how much he missed him.
<< She is shock. With what she is experiencing it is understandable. I told Peter to convince her to come to me of her own will to tell me everything >>.
<< Yes, I'm here >>.
<< Sherlock >>, John exclaims exasperated, << we are in front of the corpse of a desperate girl who has made an extreme gesture pushed by who knows what suffering. I will not allow you to minimize what happened, recognizing it as interesting only for an element that caresses your need for complicated cases to solve! >>.
<< And what is a Londoner doing here in the north west? >>.
<< This >>, Sherlock says, taking the photo of the drawing made by Daisy Cooper in his hand, << is the logo of a portal called Fenix, put online about six months ago >> he says, taking a seat in front of the PC. << As you can see, it looks like a harmless portal in which to exchange ideas and reflections on various issues concerning adolescence. The phoenix is a symbol of death and rebirth and the mind behind this site compares it to this particular period of life.

"Not to have sex with them."
<< I love you, Sherlock >> whispers the child, sinking his forehead in the hollow of Sherlock's neck.
<< You started, Sherlock, remember? >>.
<< Excuse me >> he says, embarrassed for not being able to even get up.
"True as that may be, you're acting a bit more obsessed than usual."
"If your parties are so bad, why does your family let you host them?"
"Their wedding was just so... them. And while ours was not an accurate depiction of either of us, it doesn't make it any less special." she admitted, glancing over her shoulder to look at him. She had been laying on her stomach with her book laid out on the covers at the foot of the bed while he leaned against the headboard on a pile of pillows. At her comment, he set his own book down on the bedside table, shifting to climb out from under the blankets.
I know... I'm late. But on the bright side, I've determined that I can knock a chapter off the count and still fit the content I have planned into what I have left. I can't guarantee that I'll be on time on Sunday either, but I'm going to at least try.
"Oh, my dear, Molly, it's been ages. What has kept you away?"
She felt the grip on her arm tighten a moment but it was so brief she wasn't sure if she'd imagined it or not. He didn't seem to want to let her go.
"How is it?" Sherlock asked quietly and Jane's eyes fluttered open to meet his.
"You can't or you won't?"
"I did not make up any of those details about that man."
"With your permission, I would like to approach my parents about our marriage." He suggested hesitantly.
"I'd be delighted." she agreed. Harriet smirked, wandering off to enjoy other delights that the evening had to offer.
"No, actually, the burns are fine. Well, as fine as they can be." Sherlock nodded, considering something. Whatever it was he hadn’t said it yet, instead his eyes were locked on the darker skin tissue on her left shoulder.
"I was sure you would come over yesterday, glowing about how you had reclaimed your husband. Did something happen?" Jim questioned, raising an eyebrow as he tried to catch her eye.
"Maybe I am a little girl." he grumbled bitterly.
"That's fine... Did you have someone in mind?"
"With all due respect, mother, you did not. I simply came because I haven't had the opportunity to meet Sherlock's bride." A sweet melodic laugh came from Euros and she playfully swatted at her brother's shoulder.
"It was fun while it lasted. Let's not do this again."
"That would be unlike you."
"Please. All I did was convince your husband to let you pursue your passion since he's being so stubborn about being with you," he assured, patting her back before pulling away. "Now, I realize that it's rather late to begin working today so let me escort you back to your home and you can start in the morning."
"Yes, make sure she gets rosemary tea before bed and once she wakes up. Twice a day should suffice. I'll return in a fortnight to make sure she's well."
"Your methods are certainly unconventional," Greg admitted, looking rather amused.
"It's not dusty," she said weakly and he nodded.
John was going to refuse but he paused. It wasn’t like he was going to use the money… he might as well help this pretty lady earn a living, even if it was a dishonest one. Hesitantly, he nodded and her smile widened impossibly. She dragged him into a store a few meters away.
"John." He still winced at his name, an ever constant reminder that he wasn't home, not when his heart belonged to Sherlock.
"I would shake your hand, Mrs. Holmes, but I imagine you'd prefer I didn't at the moment," Sebastian said bashfully. Jane nodded her agreement, not wanting to imagine where his hands had been or what they had been doing. Frankly, she was sure it would be a miracle if she made it out of this situation without a permanent blush on her face.
Mary Morstan had a shift today and was about to leave the estate when she heard the knock. She opened the door and gasped in surprise at the unexpected scene.
"I understand that you are aggravated with me. I apologize for my hasty decisions; they were wrong of me."
Together this uncomfortable pair walked a block and a half to a tea shop. Jane watched her cup the entire time until the lady poured some tea for them and she made sure to keep her cup as far away from him as possible in case he had any plans to drug her or something.
"As brooding as ever. Honestly, he's picked up a fascination with staring at the window pane since you showed up on our doorstep. He won't even drink his tea." Mrs. Hudson continued to ramble about his behaviors for a few moments more before she noticed the sad, longing look on Jane's face. "Don't you worry your pretty little head on it, Jane. I know he's being a right bastard about this now, but he does love you. Perhaps he needs some time and then he'll come running back to like he's starving for your attention."
"Yes..." Sherlock's mouth dragged the word on, almost making it sound like he was posing a question. He was, in fact, it was just silent. Why are we having small talk? Jane could practically hear it ringing in her ears even though he hadn't spoken more than a single word. Or perhaps the question was 'why are we talking at all?'
“You’re not going to reveal anything out of the ordinary, I very much doubt that anyone will notice. But try it on and we’ll decide.”
"You saved my life. I was merely returning the favor. I don't like owing anyone. I much rather prefer when people owe me. But we're even now, so I suppose that's that." Sherlock asked, shaking his head. "Since you have medical experience, is it wrong to assume that you have the ability to read?"
"And?"
“Thank you…” she murmured sincerely. She moved across the room, carefully bent over and handed him the book he had dropped. “It’s been a while since we’ve seen each other…”
Once he'd pulled the layers of satin and lace off of her, his hands began immediate work on the lace of her bodice, but he kept her close as if he couldn't stand the thought of being more than a few inches away from her. His lips and tongue roamed the entirety of her neck and shoulders as the strings of her stay loosened. As was his custom for the night, he threw whatever fabric he could get off of her on the floor. She pulled off his waistcoat, and it joined her dress.
"Doctor Watson, my apologies."
The next day, Moriarty stopped by, actually concerned for her.
“The same to you, Ms. Hooper.”
“Well spoken, dear.” Ms. Adler murmured, moving to stand beside him and take his arm. Sherlock gave Jane a concerned glance which she merely batted away with an affectionate smile. “We look forward to seeing you all at our wedding next week!”
"It's fine, Holmes."
"Molly and Mr. Lestrade's wedding made our own feel kind of stuffy in comparison." Jane mused while reading a book in bed next to her husband the following morning.
"Yes, Holmes, do whatever you need to do." Sherlock turned to leave but glanced over his shoulder.
“This was your plan all along, wasn’t it?” she joked and he giggled.
"Maybe Sherlock should start the introductions, Sherlock, dear?" The little girl looked up from the spot on the ground she had been staring at as if brought to life for the first time since John had seen her before returning to her dazed state, looking at John, but somehow not.
He could think of no place better to die. The wind was rustling the branches, and other than the occasional sound of a leaf flickering about the forest floor, it was quiet, like the area which should be teeming with life had been abandoned by its inhabitants. He sat down at the base of the tree and closed his eyes as he leaned against the trunk, just admiring the blessed silence for several minutes. Finally, his eyes fluttered open again, and he glanced wearily at a golden hue in the fog as the sun began to peak over the horizon.
"Mama, who's coming?" he asked, looking up at her with creased brows. It was indeed very rare for them to greet anybody at the steps of the palace. Most guests had to petition an audience to meet with his mother, even when Lord Lestrade, his mother's advisor, returned from his travels, the man would meet her in the throne room.

"Well, it's not my place, but if I were you, I would start with the truth." Mary murmured. "Though, no matter the outcome of the duel, if Jane rejects Moriarty's proposal, you do realize that he'll expect you to actually marry her, don't you?"
"I may not be considerate enough to respect other people's privacy, Jane, but you are my wife." he murmured, catching her eye. "The exception to all of my coarse behaviors."
It felt like it took Harry what felt like an eternity to get him and it made sense since London wasn't exactly close. Six and a half torturous hours later, Harry was rushing in and pulling her brother into a fierce hug which he eventually returned.
"There are rumors about that?" He shook himself out of his thoughts and cleared his throat. "That wasn't what I was going to ask you..."
"Virginia, dearest, let the man speak. He can't very well explain himself if you don't let him. We all know you worry for him, but he did come with the intention of speaking with us about something he deems important." Mr. Holmes interrupted, looking at his wife with a gleam of amusement in his eyes.
The young girl bit her lip. “Wait here a moment...” she murmured, walking back to the stable door and disappearing. John contemplated running back to the forest, perhaps the woman was going to get the police, and he’d been slapped with a fine for public indecency. He was about to depart but halted after a few moments, when the girl returned again with a gown and some proper undergarments that John couldn't even guess how to put on. He'd taken too long and although she hadn't come with a cop at her heels, he didn't feel like he should be here still. “Here. I know it's not much, but it's better than nothing...”
"I'd like to stay here and wait for my sister." John stated but there was hardly any enthusiasm behind it. Of course, he missed Harry but the cost of seeing her again didn't seem worth the trade-off. In this time, he was John Watson, a poor ex-army doctor with zero friends and no future. In Sherlock's time, he was so much more. He was a wife, a friend, and living a much more lavish life than he was now. The present wasn't desirable, neither was a future without Sherlock. "Can I ask a really weird question?"
"Like hell, you will. You'll be stiff for the duel."
"Mmm... you always make me feel so lovely." she mused, leaning into his lips.
“I… erm… I wanted to thank you properly for today.” Jane murmured, with a strained smile. “I was in a strange place with no friends and no clothes, and you took me in, clothed me, fed me, and gave me a side of your bed. Thank you, I don’t know anyone who would do that where I’m from.”
"Most ladies I've ever talked to all think you're very handsome." Jane murmured, rubbing her thumb over his sharp cheekbone.
"How weird?"
"So a boyfriend named Jane? That's gonna be tricky..."
"You going missing... It made me take things more seriously. At first I was drinking more than usual, but after a while, I realized that me getting pissed every night wasn't going to help bring you back."
"What do you mean?" Sherlock swallowed thickly at the question, cheeks burning hot with embarrassment.
“Goodnight, Ms. Watson.” Molly murmured.
Virginia spoke a lot about Sherlock and his childhood for Jane's sake. Sherlock spent a majority of the dinner red-faced from embarrassment and fury at his mother for all the anecdotes.
The next day, Jane could hardly wait to get started. She dressed in a simple brown dress that was less likely to stain should anyone ever come in with a wound that needed stitching and after familiarizing herself with where each supply was kept, she set to sewing as she waited.
"Truth be told he had it built for you before you vanished. He couldn't imagine that you enjoyed spending your days cooped up in that dark old manor of his. So he built this place with the intention that you branch out as a physician. Of course, then you disappeared..." A pang of guilt hit her full force as she looked around the room, tears threatening to spill down her cheeks once more.
“I don’t know if it’s possible, Bill, but I’m going to talk to you as if you can hear me anyways, because you’re the only person I give a damn about now and... you’re gone.” John said to the trees as if his best friend was somehow among them. “I know what you did for me, and I can’t thank you for it, not when I couldn’t do the same for you…”
"Um... This is Mr. Sebastian Moran... The man I have chosen as my partner of sorts..." Moriarty gestured to the man. He gave a small bow.
"A bad one." John retorted and she stuck her hand in the water and splashed him, causing him to chuckle.
"Let me see." she murmured, examining the bitemark on his hand with a raised brow. "Did you provoke her?"
"No! No, no no, no! Sherlock!" He let out anxious cries that he knew the man would not hear. That had been centuries ago. Sherlock Holmes was long gone from this spot and John's misery grew at this fact.
"I know. It's just going to be weird without you. You ever gonna come back?"
Molly and Jane joined hands and spun around as a chorus in an unfamiliar language left her uplifted yet dizzy. The next verse continued on simply enough as the first, with one minor difference, one of the singers had pulled a pair of spoons out of seemingly nowhere and proceeded to bump them together, causing a beat to rattle out of them.
"I am giving you a dress as a means to help you seduce your husband this evening." Jim corrected.
"J-Jane... Your breasts..."
"The pleasure is mine, Mr. Moriarty." Jane said politely through a painted smile.
"Well, I did say under normal circumstances." Amanda pointed out with a small chuckle, ruffling his hair affectionately.
"It was the least I could do. You've saved me a total of three times now, I just wish I could've been more reliable for you."
"I may have had a minor lapse in judgement..."
“No, of course not! What sort of host would I be if I made you sleep on the floor?!” Molly replied, shaking her head fervently. “Let’s get your stay off so you can sleep comfortably.”
Euros on the other hand was a wild card, as Jane had learned from her future mother-in-law. Euros had no intention of ever marrying, not that any man with a positive reputation would endeavor to bind her in matrimony. Euros had long since lost her virginity, and with that loss made the discovery that she was infertile. The fact seemed to bother her little, and Virginia speculated that it actually gave her the courage and freedom to live however she chose. She would spend a large majority of her time chasing after any man who could be found wearing a red coat and badge. Men in uniform were, apparently, her type. She survived well enough but she never received much money from her parents. Euros was bound to be defensive of her older brother once she learned of his marriage.
"He's resting. He's going to be fine. The chances of it getting infected are low but I will continue to make sure that it doesn't." Jane assured, leaning against the door and brushing her bangs out of her face with the back of her wrist.
Sherlock nodded dutifully, his eyes filling with worry. He carefully picked Mrs. Hudson up and took her to the parlor, resting her on the sofa.
"Oh, come on. It's not that outrageous. After all, we're fiances, and not only that, but we don't even have to touch. I'll even sleep on top of the covers so no one has grounds to be accusatory."
"I said that it's fine."
"Do you prefer him over me?" He almost sounded hurt and Jane's expression morphed into a frown.
“That’s rather simple for a medium.” He mused and she nodded in agreement.
"About?"
"That is how a maid is supposed to act, though I guess it's no surprise that Moriarty favors you. He has always found stubbornness to be an attractive trait in a woman." Sherlock mused, limping inside and collapsing onto an armchair next to the fireplace.
"Fighting for you was my pleasure. The aftermath was not particularly enjoyable, but I would do it again if it meant that you wouldn't have to experience unwanted advances."
It sounded like a bunch of superstitious lunacy to John. He shook his head as a local loony went on about these mysterious disappearances on great length and a dramatic booming voice while John sawed away at his bangers with a knife, occasionally stopping in his labors to pop a piece of the savory sausage into his mouth. What did he care anyway? There was really no point in dwelling on those disappearances, not when there was a purpose to coming to this little town of Baskerville which sat cleanly on the borders that split Britain and Scotland.
"Ms. Watson!" Sherlock exclaimed, voice cracking. Pink returned to his cheeks.
Once Sherlock was sufficiently weaving through the crowd, Jane stepped out of the study as well, staying toward the back as Sherlock climbed the steps where he was well seen and gave Moriarty a stern glance.
After breakfast, Jane went on her way to the forest, resuming her mission of finding that holly tree. Luck, it seemed, was not on her side. She really should’ve paid better attention to the surrounding landscape.
"So why are you in London?" Jane asked curiously.
"I suppose that's true. But can you blame me for my shit guesses, you've not given me much to go on." John was quiet, considering his sister a moment.
"Is that what I am? A puzzle? For a moment there I thought I was a human being but I suppose that was just wishful thinking." Jane replied sarcastically, rolling her eyes. She sighed, shaking her head. "Is there anything I can get for you, Holmes?"
He decided that it was all some strange festival he hadn't been made aware of. Some sort of regency celebration. The one thing he couldn't seem to explain was how he had become a woman. It made no sense, he didn't feel any different. He looked at his shoulder and sure enough the gnarled scar was still there. Then it occurred to him that he had just run through town. Come to think of it, he hadn't used his cane since he sat down next to that holly tree. Where was his cane?
"It's perfectly fine. I would be remiss if I didn't contribute somehow." Sherlock explained, chuckling. "By the way, Mr. Lestrade sent me a letter. He mentioned something about you dragging him into the woods to get a pine tree?"
“With child?” was all Sherlock could manage to get out in a somewhat sensible sounding way.
"Well, since this is my first check up with Molly, I'm gathering as much information as I can so I can better prepare for her pregnancy. For example, you'll both be happy to know that the baby is in the right position." Jane informed with a smile, pressing her ear against Molly's abdomen to listen for a heartbeat.
With a newfound sense of panic, John bolted upright in his bed and looked around the room. It was a full moon tonight so the light that entered the room effectively removed all shadows that could hide a human being. There was no one that he could see, so he proceeded to stand and investigate the places that could hide the owner of that voice, namely under the bed and outside the door.
"What do you mean?" he asked with furrowed brows.
"Can I hire on a personal maid that will speak to me?"
"No, I do not want a girlfriend."
It felt strange to refer to herself by that name since she'd been going by Jane for nearly half a year now. She now couldn't say if she preferred the life of Dr. John Watson, or Ms. Jane Watson. On one hand, John's life was over, it had ended the day he marched up to that holly tree and tried to pull the trigger. What more did he have to live for in the future? Jane wasn't treated the greatest but at least she had made friends and none of them treated her like she was broken. Friends. She pondered for a moment whether Sherlock Holmes fell under that category. He had risked his life in an attempt to save her from Moriarty's advances, and somehow she knew that was the most selfless thing he had done in his life. Yes, Sherlock Holmes could be considered a very good friend.
"Jane..." Sherlock carefully lifted himself to look her in the eye with an incredibly determined look. "That could never be the case."
"I will, thanks."
Sherlock let out a remark about the autumn rain and grumbled the other half of his complaint. Despite it only being about a mile and a half away, it took nearly an hour to get to Reichenbach Manor because of Sherlock's ankle but soon they were at the proud oak doors of Moriarty's estate. Jane knocked politely and continued to support Sherlock, arm wrapped around his waist. They were both completely drenched from the onslaught of raindrops that had bombarded them on their unsavory adventure, shivering from the cold which seemed to even permeate their bones.
"Should I start calling you John when we're in private, then?" he wondered aloud, pulled back just enough to catch her eye. Jane groaned, shaking her head.
"Okay, Joh-" She saw him start to flinch again and paused "... Jane." Harry wrapped her arms around him and hugged him. "Does that make you my sister now?"
"Alright... Thanks."
“I don’t want to, James,” Jane stated firmly, arms crossed over her chest as she huffed in frustration. Moriarty knew from the use of his Christian name how very serious Jane was being. She had never once called him by his first name and while he derived a small bit of pride in the fact that Jane felt close enough to him as a friend to call him such, he was also wise enough to take her concerns seriously.
"M...M...M..." Jane's expression fell for a moment as Mrs. Hudson couldn't seem to get out any words, staring out in her direction but not at her.
"Not even if it's a place to stay until you can convince your dear husband to take you back?" Moriarty questioned, looking at her expectantly.
Sherlock Holmes was very, very different from that man. Sherlock always gave her the opportunity to back down, though it had become a more subtle thing in the last two months, and Sherlock would get his answer from how cheeky Jane's responses were and he was sure she did it to encourage him. There was another thing that Sherlock did that was vastly different from any other partner Jane had ever had: he always made it feel like he was worshiping her. He had never once said 'I love you' and yet it was incredibly easy for Jane to believe that he did, and Sherlock was definitely a romantic, more so than Jane had been.
By now, his heart was racing, his head was pounding, all sense of vision had blurred until all he could see was the woman he loved gazing up into his very soul and the way the room seemed to be spinning was sickening. This felt all too familiar. This felt exactly like two years ago and the horror that Jane would vanish, by door or magic, was welling up inside him, making it almost unbearable to endure the silence that filled the study, drowning him. His hand was shaking now, she’d been so quiet, what on earth could she be thinking? This wasn’t hesitation… this was something that felt worse. Was she silent because she didn’t believe him? Perhaps she wished for another heartfelt confession like the one the very first day she disappeared from his life? But would that really change anything? Slowly he released the grip on her hand, preparing to collapse in a nearby armchair before his knees gave out and his heart overcame with grief.
"My house is a good six miles away. It would probably be best to just take me to Reichenbach Manor since it's closer. Moriarty won't mind me visiting unannounced." Jane paused at that, looking up at Sherlock in shock.
"Oh, I'm with child," Molly admitted, hand resting on her stomach. Jane felt a twinge of jealousy. What would she give to be able to have a child with Sherlock?
"What would you propose?" Jane hesitated a moment, thinking.
“I… am not the person you think I am…” Jane began with a deep breath. “Four years ago, Jane Watson didn’t exist… I didn’t exist… not here in this time, anyway.”
"Well..." Sherlock hesitated once again and when he saw Jane open her mouth to once again pull information from him, he explained quickly. "If either of us win the duel, assuming Moriarty wins and you reject him, he will be expecting us to marry..."
“Oh my!” She whispered, looking at the woman dressed only in undergarments. “I apologize for shouting. You startled me...” she looked away with a bright blush tinting her cheeks. “Don't you have any clothes...?”
Sherlock obediently followed her inside, trying to look anywhere but at a half-decent Jane. He breathed a sigh of relief when she closed the door behind her and waited patiently on the other side of it. Within twenty minutes, Jane was stepping back into the sitting room, fully dressed and actually wearing makeup. Molly had insisted.
"Missing posters?" John asked absently and the ranger nodded. "How long have I been missing?"
"You're Jane?" Harry asked in disbelief, pulling up a chair and sitting next to him.
"Not at all, just trying to determine how determined you are." she smirked.
"King Wolfguard Carlton Holmes the Third and Princess Willow Sherlock Scotland Holmes of the Kingdom of Angelo." Queen Amanda replied, and as if summoned, a crown started to appear from the steps, then a man, then a little girl. She was definitely younger than John, but she looked incredibly scary with the scowl on her face and her bloodshot eyes. John swallowed thickly before his mother's first statement about this guests came to mind. Horror crossed his face as he looked up at his mother. This terrifying little girl was to be his bride? Sure, that was still years off as he was seven, but this was just too much.
"I've been a little occupied helping my friend, Jane Watson, settle into town. She's living with me, though finances have become a burden." Mary turned her attention to Jane, looking her over with a friendly smile. She offered a hand to shake Jane's before turning back to Molly.
"It's just after four in the morning." The response he got was another groan. "I suppose I could find another lady to accompany me. Perhaps Ms. Morstan? Oh, or maybe little Ms. Lestrade would be intrigued enough."
“I can tell whatever it is, it’s serious…” Molly murmured though she didn’t press any further. Instead she simply smiled reassuringly. “Well, until your business is done, I will host you. I know my accommodations aren’t that plentiful…”
"Much better after resting. Perhaps it was something I ate that had me feeling unwell." Jane reasoned, climbing the stairs once again and returning fully dressed.
"Well, I did actually require a surgeon this morning. I lost a duel, I'm ashamed to admit. I am doing well, though. Dr. Watson stitched me up in such a way I have never seen. I'm told that the likelihood of infection is low and that I should recover quickly if I take plenty of time to rest."
"Just... stitch me up, Dr. Watson." Sherlock murmured, watching her with fascination as she quickly organized the supplies she had requested.
"Jane?" Sherlock looked up, concern filling his eyes. It was the first time he had called her by her first name. Mary came in and saw just in time that Jane had fallen back into Sherlock's arms from the pain.
"Is that so surprising?"
"But before I could tell him that I loved him too... I was back in the present... And now there's two centuries between me and that moment and I don't know if I'll ever seen him again..."
“I see…” Sherlock replied, only looking mildly relieved. Whatever was on his mind, the scar on her shoulder was not the heart of it. Though, she didn’t have to wait long because he broke the thought-filled silence after a moment or so. "I know you consider yourself to be 'just a maid,' but that may be subject to change soon..."
"Not at all, I've never met the man in my life." Sherlock confessed with a chuckle.
"That speechless?"
“I… I don’t think I’ll make it to the pub with you, C-Captain…” Bill said in a weak voice that could hardly be heard over the gunshots that surrounded them. He was in a great deal of pain to be sure, but shock had already drowned his nerves in a haze, making it easy for him to give John a loopy smile with a hint of regret.
You have all been so patient, waiting for me to upload the last chapter of this work; thank you. It took me a long time to determine exactly how I wanted to write the ending to this story, and even now, while writing this note, I'm not sure where my fingers will take me.
<< Yes, John. Lestrade, contact the Milton Keynes district. Alert them of what's going on and send your team over there. I'll join you at girl's house >> Sherlock says, closing the call leaving them with a thousand questions. Sherlock takes the package of sheets of reliefs he made and flies to find a cab.
<< What an honor! Sherlock Holmes the  consulting detective! Break my arm if you want. You will never find out where I keep them hidden >>.
<< Is this what you will do then? >> Mycroft asks him. << Do you take the blame for what she did, saying you was wrong to lie to her? >>.
<< Thanks >> he whispers, moved, holding the shawl with his hands to feel it more firmly on the skin.
<< Shut up >> John says, pressing his lips against Sherlock's lips. << You always talk too much. Too much >> John says, stroking Sherlock's nose with his own nose.
<< Even his nose may not work >> retorts John, acid and tired. << It is not even clear which is his front and which is his back >>.
<< My sister did it. Draw that damned phoenix everywhere now! >> says visibly shivering and John with him.
<< As my colleague said, we need to rest >> replies John.
<< Remember the grandmother's house, who daddy putted up for sale, because he says we don't need it? >>. The child nods. << Since we like it instead, I decided that you and I will go there. Tomorrow I will contact the agency and release the house from sell office. Kelly will come to work for us and also Ulrika. Now I want you to take your camping backpack and fill it by your favorite clothes. In your school's backpack you will put some books and some of your toys. I will send someone else to get the rest >>.
Sherlock, followed by the group, goes to the door, opens it and and observe the back garden.
<< How is it possible that, if you are accustomed to these things, you have not taken steps to prevent similar situations! >> John shouts. << We are talking about a club, not a private home. A place where many people gather. How is it possible that precautionary measures have not been taken even for minimum safety? We are in 2011, by god! >>.
<< My dad, my mom and my brothers was the bad guy, not me. Why everyone indict me? They always indict on me. They made me do so many tests, so many injections and they said, all those doctors, that my head is not well. No one, however, came to mind that maybe the crazy one is not me. That they who killed people were more so than me. I'm stupid, yes, but I'm not crazy and I'm not a murderer! >> she exclaims firmly.
"Calm down, Sherlock!" John says. "You have to stay calm. It is possible that it will take days before someone notice your absence, because of this damned storm. You must resist! She is crazy. Totally crazy, but she calm down if you obey her. If this entails a few  meals, I would say that it can be done, don't you believe it?. "
James grabs both of Sherlock's wrists and jumps towards him. Sherlock cannot keep his balance and together they fall into the pit. This, however, is much more profound. Infinity. They fall down for a time that seems eternal, a time in which Sherlock has only the mad smile of his archenemy before his eyes.
<< I'm dirty and I don't want to dirty you too >> Sherlock whispers.
<< Mrs. Ford ran up the stairs, chased by the kidnapper >> He says, indicating the two sets of footprints present one on the other, but clearly visible, imprinted on the carpet of the staircase. << However, she was unable to reach the top of the stairs. The kidnapper took her by the hair and pulled her down >> Sherlock says, pointing to a lock of long brown hair that has fallen on a step. << At this point I can assume that Ford recovered, but the kidnapper keeping the woman under gunshot. The man succumbed to blackmail and could stumbled a few steps, as that other chair tilted against the wall and the crooked picture indicates. The kidnapper dragged the woman. The footprints left on the wax here become more broken and marked, a sign that Ms. Ford has tried to resist. Footprints and the trail of broken objects lead us to that side >>.
John feels called into question and looks away from the perpetually judgmental Mycroft's eyes.
"I'm still a pervert, for the Hide version of Mary, it's better that I remember it."
<< Hey, what the fuck is wrong with you? >> Martin growls.
<< A person who knows he is at risk of being involved in a series of aggressions against suffering people and know how is the attacker, reports him to the police . Would you really want me to believe that you left your reputation in the hands of a man who usually takes advantage of others' weakness? I don't believe you, 'master' >> sherlock says, placing emphasis on the last word.
<< Sherlock >> insists the brother, catching his hand . << Is it possible that you didn't understand what the man you fell in love with is made of? >>.
<< It depends on the type of mushroom. The most common are respiratory and asthma problems, inflammation and dermatological problems, allergic reactions, physical fatigue, dizziness and headache, sensitivity to light, but also problems of concentration and memory, change of mood, anxiety and depression >>.
<< Fortunately for you, no, Gavin. Otherwise you would have to deal with making me sweat here for a banal heart attack! >> Sherlock roars, tearing his jacket from Lestrade's hands.
"Jesus, they make her go around alone" he sighs. John's eyes are increasingly attracted by the features partially covered by the blue scarf and by the enormous hands forced into leather gloves.
<< A Spa, Sherlock, is a wellness center, a place where people go to relax, do massages, the sauna, Turkish bath and many other things like this >>.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm a bloody idiot!" he repeats, sighing again.
With a blow of a baseball bat, Sharon destroys one of the appliques and open with a kicks the bathroom's door. She checks in the shower cubicle and tears it to pieces, furious at yet another failure.
<< Mary ... she told you about ... >>.
<< One of the 'professionals' who holds the seminars. That's  the way they call themselves >> replies Sherlock.
<< I can always take back the proposal >> retorts Sherlock angrily. << And anyway, no, if I offer myself it is to shorten the investigation time. I will be away for a couple of weeks at most >>.
<< I'm really sorry >> mutters to himself and maybe Greg hears it too, but decides not to give him rope.
<< And who probably he wants more. Tell me, please, that you don't have in mind to do what I think, Sherlock >>.
"She still has the razor with her. Don't play with fire, Sherlock," his brother Mycroft tells him.
<< I didn't do anything exceptional >> Sherlcok mumbles embarrassed, motionless in the strong arms that hold him.
<< Now you're the one who says things that don't make sense! >> he exclaims annoyed. << I go away to spite John >> repeats teasing. << I am certainly not the one who made 'spite' >> he points out, by crossing his arms over his chest.
<< I think it's the dog's way to take our sorrows on them and make us smile again >>. Morgan barks confirming Sherlock's words and licks happy William's face. He laugh, and look for refuge from that festive attack in the consultant's arms. Sherlock is amazed at the gesture of the boy, who presses his face against his chest in an attempt to steal it from the dog. Sherlock looks for John's gaze and finds him smiling and moved. No. Satisfied.
<< You are not a bad father. Believe me, I know how is a bad father >> says Sherlock, turning his gaze slightly to his brother, standing by the door of his study. Taking Greg by surprise, the consultant takes the pack of cigarettes from his jacket pocket. << You stopped with this stuff, remember? >> he says, winking at him.
More than words, the tone used by Mycroft affects him. Free of any emotional color. Live in spite of everything. Accept any kind of violence for the sake of survival.
Sherlock looks at the footprints in the snow. The man was not alone with his assassin. There are other footprints, smaller, some very small.
<< Yes, there is something they call 'Evening relaxation: a magnificent bath of sound waves produced by our splendid Tibetan bells capable of giving relaxation and lightening the spirit'. It starts at 10 pm >>.
<< I see it >> Sherlock replies, massaging the wrist. << Yours is a real jealousy scene and I really don't understand it, since I don't think we're together! >>.
<< Are you still try to running after your flatmate? >>.
<< And ...? >>.
<< If he continues like this, his heart will burst, Dr. Watson. We have to do something >> the nurse try to take him off. John realizes how much the situation is deteriorating, but the idea that Sherlock may fall prey to an induced sleep again scares him. Unfortunately, the nurse is faster than him, that attempt to propose alternative solutions, and injects the sedative into the IV.
<< How do you know? >> asks him, her face pale and tense.
<< Glad you got there >> he blurts out, passing a hand to remove the sweat from his face.
John is furious at the idea that they may have arrived late. He quickly descends the stairs and moves like a fury toward the big woman.
<< Why this decision? >>.
<< What you have repeatedly asked me: I wear a shirt >>.
<< I found it! >> John exclaims, pointing the file on the pc. << Sharon describes in detail where the old cottage is located. She lead the child there because she want that he assists to his mother's murder  >> says John, pointing to the screen. << Where's William now, Sherlock? >>.
<< We just have to wait, John. We risk ending up like Jack Nicholson in "Shining" if we went out there >>. John chuckles nervously.
<< Sources tell me I don't have a heart, Fox >>.
<< I'm afraid I have not explained well >> says Sherlock, joining his fingers under his chin. << There is no competition, John. That evening it was raining and Fox and I we were wet to the bone. So when you arrived I was in dressing gowns and he was in the shower. You, however, saw a part of the story and mounted it for your use and consumption, even thinking that I was neglecting the case and give myself a very trivial adventure, when, instead, I spent the night in the social media of that girl. I would say that if there is someone who should feel offended and humiliated that is me. You really believed that I could bring perfect strangers to bed. >>.
<< I fully agree with you, John >> Fox nods, while the two Holmes look at him with the same skeptical expression.
<< I know, and I admire you for this. Two days have passed since we found the car and, despite the research, we have not come to the head of anything >> sighs Greg, passing his hand over his tired face.
<< The trust you place in this group of investigative journalists is admirable. I must admit that although I do not approve of your methods, I recognize you are capable of carrying out excellent investigations, to the point that I could propose to hire you. Too bad that I, unlike my brother, don't trust journalists. "Nunca confìes en un periodista
<< I don't know if it was an accident >> Sherlock admits, taking off his shirt. John puts his hand over his eyes: Sherlock is doing a striptease at the crime scene.
<< Oh ... well, there were priorities ... >>.
<< Mary ... >> whispers the consultant, leaving them speechless. The two men exchange another look. Neither of them could have imagined that the first word Sherlock would say once awake would be the name of his jailer.
She turns off the light and closes the door, leaving him in the dark.
Sherlock risks losing his grip on the razor handle, when the woman sits heavily beside him on the bed. Her huge thigh in contact with his bare side, sends a retch back to his throat.
<< Behind a gesture of this type there can be a thousand reasons, Mr. Jackson. At the moment I have few elements to be able to give you an answer. I need to find out the meaning of that drawing and for this reason, I will have to take away your daughter's notebooks >>.
<< Oh yes, just me >> she laughs cheerfully. << I am very sorry for Silver. I didn't want to do it, but your mother forced me >>.
<< Lizzy came very shaken by the only one she attended two weeks ago >> George intrudes, eager to say what he knows. << I was afraid they had done something bad >> he says visibly swallowing. << Lizzy continued, however, to say that it was not fair they had thrown her out of the group >>.
<< News, Mr. Holmes? >> he asks.
<< Do you regret having had a nightmare? >>.
<< I don't care >> John replies. He order the meal, choosing from the menu shown in the flyer that the receptionist gave them, the dishes that can be to Sherlock’s taste. << I will go away when they have brought lunch >>.
<< I give her a few more minutes before exploding >> John replies with a smile.
<< Very interesting choice of words, Fox >> underlines Mycroft.
<< Being together >> concludes John, now determined to go all the way. << Is it for Moriarty? >> asks him and Sherlock nods.
John watches Sherlock walk away wondering how he got there. How did he understand. John never mentioned it. Never mentioned it to anyone, to tell the truth. Yet Sherlock understood it. John is amazed, admired, but also frightened. Although six months have passed since he followed Sherlock in his investigations and saw him solve puzzles he still cannot say that he is used to it, by drawing up deductions from things that most people would never have seen.
<< We have a kidnapper known by the Ford, who arrives armed with blank pistol at their door. After a fight, The kidnapper fires a shot to intimidate them, but gets the opposite effect. He is forced to hit Mr Ford and chase Ms Ford. The kidnapper keep her under the threat of blank pistol to convince Mr Ford to reach this place and get into the driver's seat >> summarizes John doubtfully.
<< You do not see what ... >> John blurts, raising his hands to heaven. << Do you want me to believe that while a stranger was sleeping in your bed you were awake working on the case? >>.
The shift in the clinic is slow and boring. Colds, rheumatism, gastritis ... must be the equivalent of jealous husbands and petty thefts from Sherlock's point of view. John has made up for the hour of delay and is about to leave, waiting for the clock of the stamping machine to strike at six. He has repeatedly thought of sending a message to Sherlock, both to apologize for the illogical gesture he has made, and to ask for updates on the case. John wrote many texts between one patient and the other, but in the end he always deleted them, putting away his cell phone with a sigh of heartache. Yet another painful twinge pierces his stomach and takes his breath away. John puts his hand on it and tries to breathe deeply to relieve the pain.
<< Well ... it may happen that an artist has a block or that she work on something so intimate that she still do not want to show it before she have given it shape >> says the father, passing his hand embarrassed on the neck. The mother cries silently, her eyes downcast and her hand, pressed to a handkerchief, pressed to her lips.
<< How do you know it? >>.
<< I ... I still apologize for that >> John says, looking away. << I guess Fox didn't like this. He thought that I was the a man prone to violence >>.
<< Well >> John replies with a smile. << As before that Saturday >>.
<< From your point of view yes, Sherlock. I think that would also be good for you to relax. It's not as bad as it seems >>
<< I don't see what else it could. I mean, you have a reputation to being with women on three continents! >>.
<< Of course, Mr. Holmes >> answer Fox, with the same fake and licked courtesy. << We have been working on this case for four months. We stumbled upon the Fenix portal while doing research on cyber bullying and online soliciting against young and kids people. We have repeatedly tried to introduce ourselves into the system with fictitious profiles, but whoever created that portal is a good professionist. Very good. To the point of recognizing us as intruders and throwing us out. It is the first time that we are faced with such an impregnable system and being able to take advantage of the collaboration of a girl directly involved would be an excellent turning point in the investigation. We will have to operate from the girl's pc and from the place where she is used to using it. We will act remotely, my colleague, Sky, is currently in Berlin, where we found another cell of the so-called Masters of this portal >> says Fox. << If you, Mycroft, will have the kindness to provide me with passwords, we will connect to the main frame of the secret services that will allow Sky a greater range of action, saving us the effort and time to force the system and all the problems that ensue >> Fox adds with a bewitching smile just bowing his head.
<< Mary didn't kill them. She executed them >> Sherlock points out.
<< I know, I understand it >>.
Bruises on the left biceps.
<< Shut up! It wasn't him! If I'm naked now, I don't owe it to him >>.
Hataway crosses his arms over his chest and frowns.
<< Call it ‘Stockholm syndrome’ if you want. He's not even my type, I have to be really traumatized >> Sherlock plays down with a chuckle.
<< Are you still here? >> Sherlock asks him. John notes that the skin of Sherlock's abdomen is red, a sign that he must have rubbed it vigorously. << You are wasting a lot of time! >> adds Sherlock.
"Already. She froze your heart. "
<< Billy, what is happen? >> asks the woman, peeking from the kitchen. The child runs towards her and holds her tightly.
The cell phone warns him that he has received a text. Sherlock reads it and carefully observes the video that Lestrade sent him
<< Thanks >> John blurts out.
John puts his ear to the bathroom door that connects to Sherlock's room. He opens it slowly and sees a cushion placed on the ground with a bowl of water next to another bowl that hosted the puppy's food. Sherlock sleeps on the right side, covered from the waist down from the sheet. The puppy sleeps happily near Sherlock's bare chest, protected by his embrace.
<< Can you smell this strong smell of disinfectant, Inspector? >> John asks him, entering the bathroom.
<< John, I'm almost certain that there is no aggressor and that guy died from subjecting his body to excessive stress. It was too warm in that place >>.
John holds his breath and counts up to ten, always in the hope of not loosing the effect of the shower. In a sense, Sherlock is worried about him, so he appreciates at least the effort.
<< All too well >> sighs Mycroft, who seems to want to remember everything but that.
<< What? >> asks in amazement. << Why did you call him? >>.
<< I had a nightmare, Mary. I'm sorry >> says promptly. The last thing Sherlock wants now is activate her violent part. He wouldn't be able to stand it after the nightmare he had just had. It would be an insane continuation in the world of reality and Sherlock feels he would go completely mad if it happened.
<< The regrettable fact has just been resolved >> Sherlock interrupts him. The little man opens in a bright smile.
Sherlock smiles, thinking about his skull. He didn't talk to him about his nightmares, but he shared case theories with him. The skull has always listened to him without ever replying, helping him considerably, he must admit, to find the key to the problems.
Sherlock watches them closely. He closes his eyes and tries to recall those few flashes he saw.
<< You will end up stealing my job! >> he says, making William's small pale cheeks blush. << If your mom used to keep her student's homeworks there and you saw its on the table before going up to your room and now its are not scattered on the ground... >>.
<< She will find a person more present than me and capable of loving her >> he answers, thinking of how absurd that thought, that conversation, all this situation is.
<< Yeah >> sighs Sherlock, placing his cheek against John’s cheek. << We can't go further >> he whispers.
<< What if it wasn't outdoors? >> John challenges him, exasperated by his rowing against. << If someone had passed here before the storm raged and had rescued him? >>.
<< Stop it with these bullshit! You have it and you already have also those who have set themselves the goal of burning it. So stop being a drama queen and be careful >>.
<< Because he was a doctor in the army >> Hataway replies in John place, with the sweetness that a father would use for a daughter.
John goes down the seventeen steps and leaves the door just as Mrs. Hudson is about to enter
<< You are totally crazy! All of this wouldn't have happened if you hadn't write your bullshit. Do you really think you can ... >>.
<< No problem >> John reassures him, smiling.
<< Not someone encouraged by you, this time >> Sherlock mumbles, trying to stand up. The leg, however, does not hold him and he falls into Moriarty's arms.
The girl nods in amazement. She blinks on his eyes full of makeup, incredulous in front of the perfect analysis made by the consultant.
<< I understand >> John mumbles. << No, wait, it's not true! I do not understand a shit, however! >> he shout, clapping his hands on the back of his armchair. << What the fuck is going on, Sherlock? Who the hell is that man and why did he call you 'Billy'? >>.
<< Not really >> answers John, who just wants to get out of there, where he are wasting too much time. Mary groped to read Sherlock's name, making the pronunciation blatantly wrong, which. John can't stand her any longer.
<< Where are my things? >> he asks, while she continues to throw hot pieces of chicken into his mouth.
Molly and Lestrade would certainly have room, but they'd also probably side with Sherlock since he was Lestrade's friend and Jane was the one who disappeared for two years. Ms. Morstan wasn't an option either since she lived with her parents still, assuming she hadn't gotten married at this point.
"That's what this is about?" Jane giggled and then she broke out into a full on laugh. "Oh, Holmes, believe me when I say I've had much worse than a man try to force himself on me. I was shaken at the time, but I'm over it."
She knocked twice before entering the study, finding Mr. Moriarty standing in front of a bookcase, observing all the titles as if he hadn't read all of the books on the shelves already. He turned to look at Jane, not at all disturbed or perturbed to see Jane covered in Holmes blood.
"...A bit..." he fumbled, cheeks tinged pink.
“Erm… well… I’ll be honest with you, Ms. Hooper… I don’t have a home in London. I have no money to my name, no clothes besides the ones that you put on my back, and no one to go to…” John stated nervously. “But I do need to stay here in Baskerville.”
“Give me a chance to, please… That’s all I ask, is a chance…”
"What?!" Jim shouted, eyes going dark. "Very well, Holmes. If that's how you want to play it. I'd like to challenge you to a duel. Tomorrow morning. If you win, I'll leave Jane alone, but if I win, I'll ask her if she'd rather marry me."
“Well, you must not come from a place with many decent people.” Molly replied with a sweet smile. “I was just showing you the courtesy of the Christian hospitality I was raised with.”
"How did you know where I live?"
"Well, you could ask her to dance." Jane reasoned and he pondered it for a moment. "After all, propriety dictates that she dance with you at least once this evening. Now, stop staring at her like a puppy after some scraps and go ask her." With that she gently pushed him in the direction of his newfound affection and returned to her husband's side.
"Well, I was sure no one would take me seriously as a physician. And at the time I was an acquaintance of the cook here, so she recommended me and I got the job. Cleaning is something that anyone can do, but I have a lot of experience with it so it was what I was settled with." she explained as they walked down to the kitchens. Once they were there, she allowed Sherlock to find a place he was relatively comfortable as she started her work on the numerous dishes on the counter. He chose to be relatively close to her, watching as she worked with intrigue.
“John…”
"Not at all. I think your service shall prove to be, at the very least, adequate and as he says you're the only member of his staff that I am familiar with. I thought it best to pick you rather than some dull, timid girl who would bore me to death. I find you to be at least a little interesting since I can't figure you out completely."
"I'm smart enough to know that despite being in the other room you heard the conversation. The walls here are too thin." Jane sighed softly, crossing her arms. "You have questions, no doubt."
"Currently, I am seeing if I can decipher what position the baby is in," Jane explained and Molly nodded as if she completely understood while Greg's eyebrows furrowed.
"If this is something that you don't want, you need only tell me, Jane..."
Have a request? Visit my patreon. Your request will take top priority.
"Not happily from what the rumors flying about the village would suggest. IS it true that you didn't even share the wedding evening with your husband?" Jane was speechless and incredibly embarrassed by the statement. She was about to retort but the crowd on the dance floor pulled her to a different part of the clearing and she was suddenly all to aware of the music. She'd been dancing on instinct throughout that whole conversation and she still was.
"You use my own foolish words against me?" Sherlock questioned, smiling tenderly. "It may be an abstract social construct, but it doesn't change the fact that it's how I feel about you. I could hardly take my eyes off of you when you danced, surely you noticed?"
Jane had been walking in the forest, which she returned to every few weeks or so to try her luck. She never lost her sense of hope that she might somehow return to her original time, but it was considerably dulled now and she was fairly certain that she wasn't going to be making as many walks through the trees when winter arrived. She had a satchel on her now most of the time, out of habit. There were many times when he called upon his skills as a surgeon but for something far less exciting than surgery: sewing. She had somehow been put in charge of repairing Moriarty's clothes when the need arose, and though she would rather avoid her rather flirtatious employer it was an impossible task when she was on his estate, except when she was washing dishes. For some reason, Mr. Moriarty couldn't be bothered to enter the kitchen, not that John minded.
"How can I help you become you again?"
"I think I'm all set, Holmes, but I appreciate the offer, just make sure that Moriarty knows to keep his distance, and I'll be set."
“I realize this question may be indelicate, but I was wondering what it was you were doing in my father's stables?” Molly asked, examining the young blonde lady with unabashed curiosity. A flush covered John's face, and he swallowed heavily.
Mrs. Hudson was having a stroke.
Mycroft was engulfed in government work. It took up an extraordinary amount of his time, leaving him only time for meals, which he had at his office in London, and sleeping, which he only did at his office for a third of the week. Often any letter Virginia sent in regards to minding his health went ignored. He didn't read them unless they were marked 'urgent' and Virginia was smart enough to know that if she marked every letter as such, none of them would be read. News of Sherlock's marriage was sure to be marked under the one that would guarantee his reading, though Virginia seemed certain that Mycroft Holmes would express disappointment in Sherlock's decision to marry rather than any sort of happiness for him.
"Who is this, then?" he asked John with a furrowed brow. gesturing to the girl with wild, black curls.
"S-sorry, Lord Lestrade." Mike replied in a squeaky voice.
"I... was wondering... since you're no longer afflicted by last year's incident... if you would mind terribly... um... if we... consummated our marriage..." Sherlock's cheeks were bright red and his words could hardly be heard over the music in the distance.
"I was wondering if Mr. Holmes was home."
"You're very welcome, Holmes. Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone." Jane teased, getting up and leaving the room and closing the door.
"How can you be so sure?" she questioned, raising an eyebrow.
"Are you saying that you only say these things to get me excited?" Jane asked, one arm draped over her eyes as she tried to hide her blush.
"If you can name an afternoon where I'm not sneaking glances at you, Mrs. Holmes, I would be most surprised." Sherlock retorted with a smirk, setting his book down to sip at his tea.
<< Oh, what poultice you are! Come on here! >> the woman says loudly, taking the fork from his hands. << Starts from the broth >> she says, fishing a piece of chicken from the bottom of the other dish. She pulls it up and pushes it violently into Sherlock's mouth.
Sherlock returns the smile. He pulls the tuft away from his eyes and looks away. They are so close that John can feel his breathing crash against his face.
<< No. We only live together >> Sherlock reply, smiling. << I have to go to forensic department and I can't take Morgan with me. How about you keep him with you? He loves to play to bring back sticks and balls >>.
<< Do it! >> She orders, handing him the 'parrot'. Sherlock does not feel the urge to urinate, but communicating it to Mary would serve no purpose. He quickly learned that his benefactress has pre-established times for each type of body function and does not tolerate variations or missed executions. Not only did he find himself forcibly fed, but also forced to urinate and defecate on command.
<< Lizzy, calm down >> Greg asks, defending his ex-wife, despite everything.
In turn, his friend's brother no longer even announces himself with that annoying cough. Mycroft must have understood that John would continue to express his love for the consultant even if the queen herself entered that room or the pope whom his mother had so much in consideration.
<< Do you promise me that you don't leaving me behind? >> John asks him, getting out of bed.
<< Would the… British Government be Mycroft? >> Greg asks and Fox turns to him to nod. The detective laughs loudly. << Explain to me how you think I can help you convince his brother to do something? >>.
<< I'll kill you, little bastards! I'll tear you to pieces >> Sharon screams. Her face is a mask of blood and her body gradually becomes covered with bruises. She disarm William with a kick. The child falls to the ground, the baseball bat rolls away. With an additional effort, she gets rid of the dog, that flies towards the wall against which it collides, before falling to the ground emitting a faint yelp.
<< To punish Margaret for not accepting her stories >> Sherlock replies in his obvious and unnerving tone. << We are dealing with a visibly disturbed girl. A youngh writer who hope to create a best seller. She is alone, without important relationships nor a family. She has a job that does not satisfy her, nor allows her to find a better place to live in. Sharon Milton pours out her anger, her desperation and her dreams in her stories. Finally she collect the amount of money to enroll in her favorite writer's creative writing course and O'Hara has the audacity to reject her masterpieces >>.
<< Oh God, Mary ... it's beautiful >> he whispers moved. A knot tightens Sherlock's throat and his hands tremble as he caresses the live wood, the strings stretched. << Can I, really? >> Sherlock asks, to the woman, who nods looking at him with big and surprised eyes.
<< Ford’s wife >>.
Sherlock knows he was wrong. If he hadn't declared his love to him, maybe John wouldn't have pulled back. Love is too demanding, especially if declared so early.
<< There is news instead, gentlemen >>, Hataway bursts in, << but it is not good >> he adds, breaking their hopes. << A new storm is about to hit these mountains. It will begin tonight and only God knows when it will fade. I ... I don't want to be a hoodoo, but I'm afraid there is nothing for your friend to do. If someone had found and hosted him at this point he would have told us. What is the point of keeping an infirm and perhaps dying stranger at home? >> asks the inspector.
"This is the biggest bullshit I've heard," Moriarty says, laughing. "All this because of that John Watson?" he says, pronouncing that name with disgust. "Are you serious? Just because he fucked you just to get rid of the whim? Oh God, how dramatic you are! "
The woman remains motionless, firm in the formulation of the complicated thought that his question must have structured in her. Sherlock has no weapon kept in the trolley, but, although it may be a small thing against her fury, he can still try to use it as a shield to protect himself from her fists.
<< Enough! >> John shouts, beating his hand on the floor. Sherlock looks at him in amazement. That hard, tense expression has never seen his face. << I shouldn't have left you alone and he shouldn't have dared to touch you >>.
<< You must have had a very 'cheerful' mom and granma, huh? >> John whispers, scratching the puppy's ears. The puppy barks and John tries to silence him.
The man freezes. A towel on the head to rub wet hair, the other tight around the waist. John blinks several times, in front of that unexpected and half-naked presence in front of him.
"I'm a bloody idiot!" sighs, passing his hand over his face, tired of the hours of travel. John walk slowly to what he has always considered the Mind Palace doormat on which Sherlock is used to lie down to access it. John sits down in the exact center. Rigid, as if he were embarrassed to touch the sofa's surface. He hesitantly places both hands on sofa's black skin and the memories come stronger.
<< Oh my God, stop asking me >> John answers pulling him down.
Sherlock finds himself thinking that, if the risk of all that joviality is to find her on him in too intimate attitudes, he prefere to unleash the ire of Mary's dangerous version. Sherlock already thinks of saying something that makes Mary angry, so as to remove that boeful smile from her face and those caressing attentions from her hands.
"No" Sherlock replies. Red in the face, Mary torments a nail with her teeth, while insisting on not looking at him.
<< Have you been to Afghanistan, doctor? >>.
<< I told you to shut up! >>.
<< If you know their existence it means that you have looked at them too >> John says, finally tearing the laptop from his hands. Sherlock tries to get it back, but John promptly locks his hands and back against the seat of the sofa.
<< Are you telling me that you just seduced your attacker? >>.
<< I already told you to stop using us to justify your miseries! >> shouts Lizzy, forcing Greg to hold her still so as not to jump against her mother. << It is not true that he is not a good father and in my opinion he was not even a bad husband >>.
<< Do you know your mother's novel? >> Sharon says loudly, slowly crossing the kitchen. << You love crime book and surely you will have asked her to read her novel, even if it is not a reading suitable for a child >>.
<< If I am in your shoes, I wouldn't go against him. He has reduced to a minimum the woman who reduced you like this >> Sherlock warns him, without hiding the pleasantness he feels in teasing him.
<< Now stand still and don't make a fuss >> whispers that calm voice, so close to Sherlock’s ear.
<< To speed up divorce and exclusive custody of my son, Albert! >>.
<< I'm also fine. Very well >> he chuckles, thinking about the happy moments just passed.
Those words are a punch in the stomach, strong enough to take Sherlock's breath away. A whore. Yes, that's how he felt, even if he never had the courage to say it even to himself. A silly girl in love used as the cheapest of whores. And it was this love that made his price low.
Mary arranges the dress and stands up straight and with her hands reaches one on top of the other in front of her chest, like a diligent child who is preparing to recite the Christmas poem. With an unexpectedly clear, intoned and beautiful voice, she begins to sing about this Irish girl and Sherlock follows her, slowly recovering from his Mind Palace the chords of this ballad that he discovers to knows.
<< It will not be continued, let alone! >> he chuckles confidently, deciding to dismiss it as a matter of fact.
<< I just don't want that he have dysentery, John. He is a puppy. Everyone try to feed him! And try to caresses him! ‘Could I touch him? He's so cute', everyone repeat, over and over. I would like to see how they would react if someone asked them 'Could I touch you? You are so cute ’>>.
Sherlock looks at her in amazement.
"Who knows where in your Mind Palace you took refuge to seek comfort" John thinks every time he sets his eyes on Sherlock's face. Intimately and completely selfishly, he hopes to have been and still be by his side in that imaginary place. Because he saw the same serene expression on Sherlock's face that Sunday morning and these Holmes repeat all the time that the universe is never so lazy as to produce coincidences.
<< I have not connoted, but simply observed. Yes, be surprised! >> John chuckles in turn. << I don't understand why this strange game you are playing, where it seems you want to reduce a friend to a simple useful object >>.
<< Okay, I understand >> she mind, moving away from him a good two steps. John goes to the door that opens by himself.
"You will be hungry and thirsty."
<< I'm William >>  says the boy, looking at the dog.
<< She's coming soon >> replies the consultant. The expressionless face is slightly paler than usual. John sits down in his chair, trying to cheer Sherlock up with his closeness. Intimately he feels the need, in turn, to cheer himself up by having him close, because that beautiful scene of unconditional love has strained his internal balance already quite shaken in the last few days.
Sherlock comes closer to John, who silently presses his elbow against Sherlock's one. They are not accustomed to public displays of affection and perhaps they will never become. Thery are both reserved and shy. That contact, however, has, for Sherlock, the same value as an arm around the shoulders and a kiss. This kind of thing, will happen later, in the private warmth of their apartment in Baker Street.
<< You are thinking, it is not a good thing. Just watch. List what you see >>.
<< The wound has not yet closed >>.
<< Because you are a good girl and you just wanted to stop them. Both to kill strangers and to punish you. That storage room is not nice. It's dark, tight and cold >>.
<< You and your dog are contaminating the crime scene! >>.
Sherlock shakes his head and runs his hand over his face.
<< Basically yes. The brothers are constantly on the road and since the father died they have become accustomed to spending the winter elsewhere. They leave her to look after the bedridden mother. A stroke struck her only a few months after her husband died. Mary keeps going as best she can and I will tell you, Lestrade, that she is not doing so badly. She has the strength of four men and, certainly, sometimes she remains motionless in a disturbing way and then suddenly changes her mood, but it is not a danger neither for others nor for herself >>.
<< Who am I talking about? >> John repeats, laughing. << I'm talking about the person you held captive in the storage room on the first floor. Of the one who played the violin for you in the second floor room. I'm talking about the owner of what was once a blue scarf >> he says, flapping the shred of fabric under her nose.
<< Perfect! >> Sherlock exclaims, letting his head fall on the pillow. Quite bad move, which leads him to an explosion of lights behind closed eyelids.
<< Oh yes, Mr. Holmes >> laughs softly. << When I saw Sharon hit Albert, shouting at him confident and fearless orders I said to myself that I too could find the strength to react. And doing it requires a good dose of madness. I've had enough of Albert's constant reproaches, devaluations and immense ego! I can take care of myself and I am economically able to support both me and my son. As far as possible, I will try to do everything in a civilized way. I don't want to give a bad example to my son and Albert is still his father >>.
<< Oh, really? >> the woman happily asks him, changing her attitude completely. She sits on the chair, planting her elbows over her knees and her square chin in her cupped hands. << Tell me >> she says and Sherlock's stomach closes in terror.
Mary smiles at him, swirling the cream-soaked brush in front of his face. Sherlock squeezes the razor handle tightly in his right hand.
"Really? Can you tell me something I don't know? How, for example, who is the serial killer? "
<< Sir, we will gladly follow you to your  office >> John intrudes.
<< Oh, great! Follow me >> says the little man cheerfully, making their way.
<< You are so unfair >> Margaret says to her between sobs. Mycroft looks at her in disgust, by taking a few steps back. << You have no idea what I went through in the past year! >>.
<< Morphine >> Sherlock says between his teeth, swallowing the refreshing sip. << I didn't want to take it, but I had to be lucid. The leg gave me significant problems. To be honest, he still gives me now >> he says, bringing his hand to his right thigh where, beyond the knee, he feels a dull pain rising.
<< Ladies and gentlemen, our evening Aufguss session will begin in ten minutes. You can start taking a seat >> announces a staff girl.
<< Well, then I would say that I await updates from you >> says Mycroft, standing up, giving them to understand that the session is ended.
<< Captain, I couldn't imagine that ... >>.
<< Er ... wait, how was it? Sitz und still >> John says in the captain's tone of voice. The puppy immediately sits silent. << Better than many soldiers >> John says caressing the puppy's head.
<< Yes, I know that I am not your favorite Holmes and I do not mind at all >> Mycroft says disgusted. << Lestrade, I think it's appropriate that I also come from your ex-wife. She will see my brother, of which he already has a bad reputation, fall into her house, together with another individual of dubious morality >> Mycroft says, giving Fox a look.  The man thanks him with a nod. << I think that my presence, combined with what I represent, can be useful to avoid clashes and further decanting of bile >>.
<< Ah, you are here! >> Lestrade goes to meet them. << The body is in the morgue. As soon as I get the results, I'll let you know. Do you have any news? >>.
<< How did Hope with the lady in pink >>.
<< Mary, I will do everything possible to help you, but they will indict you anyway for killing your brothers and your mother >> he says and Mary burst into tears. She rub her eyes before hiding her face with her hands.
<< Do you know him? >> George asks hopefully.
<< Very dangerous >> .
Mycroft wears a brown coat that goes down to cover him up to the ankles. The hands, protected by leather gloves of the same color, are resting on the inevitable umbrella. A burgundy scarf protects his throat from the cold and loosens it just when he sees them coming.
<< William, Silver didn't bark at his killer >>.
<< Of course, tell it to someone else. In this case, your lack of appetite was not helpful >>.
<< I still struggle to stand up, how can you think I can move from here? >>.
"The slap of the airbag" he thinks, happy not to have broken the bones of his face as well as those of his leg and, he fears, also some ribs. Sherlock must admit that he has less hollow cheeks, though. Regular nutrition with chicken and vegetable broth is taking effect.
<< Well, now that we have established who half of your genetic heritage belongs to, can you tell us what brings you here at this hour, facing the risk that your parents will discover that you have skipped school? >>.
John turns up his nose at the question, that rings in his head with the voice of his sister. In this too long day spent in the company of too many words of that woman, the thought of what happend in Trafalgar Square went several times to his minde.
<< I'm sorry, Edward >> sobbing, stroking Sherlock's damp hair with her hand. << I never wanted anyone to be hurt. I always trembled when my father or brothers brought an injured stranger home. I knew he wasn't going home, whether there was snow or not. They cleaned them of everything and then, when they took them to the pit, they left them there to die >>.
<< Transparent >>.
<< Chief Commissioner, I think you can also go back to the office. We will contact you as soon as we have resolved the case, so that you can rise to the honors of the limelight in front of the press and the majority shareholder >> Sherlock says, walking by the chief, holding the child by the hand. Morgan wagging his tail and run immediately behind them.
<< Exactly >> sighs the little man. << For this reason I need reliable data and as soon as possible and you, sir, are lightning in discovering things. It took you a few minutes to understand the dynamics of the accident >>.
<< Captain, I can not allow you to go alone to Mary Abbott! Especially after what we have discover about her >>.
<< What! >>.
<< Yes, I wanted to know when you could come for the deposition, but I got no answer. I thought you were in a coma, as always happens after the end of a case >>.
<< No, Greg >> sighs again. << Alcohol has nothing to do with it. Not the way you think, at least >> John just glances at the detective. Greg watches him for a long time and though John keeps his eyes down he can imagine his left eyebrow arching as he tries to make sense of his words.
<< It wasn't my idea >> says the man, turning his accusing gaze to the consultant. << But you've already understood that, Dr. Watson. I am of the opinion that ,in the face of desperate situations, acting in the shadows, hiding what is being experienced to the friends, is both more harmful and beneficial. The lie deteriorate the  relationships, my dear Holmes, not the truth and you should know it >> Fox scolds the two brothers, who close in an unusual mutism.
<< I think I have never thanked Sherlock enough for all the headaches thatn he takes me off >> adds Greg, wiping his eyes. << If you, John, who know Sherlock better than anyone else, are worried about him, then I think something is really happened there. The least I can do is help you. The case I am following is at a dead end and only Sherlock's brilliant and absurd mind can unlock the situation. So I think I will accompany you on this crazy adventure. I stand rusty behind a desk >> Greg says, standing up. John is speechless and it takes him a few moments to realize what Greg has proposed.
John nods proudly of his decision and something equally courageous snaps inside of him. He brings his hand close to Sherlock's disheveled hair and let his fingers sink into it. His gesture takes the consultant by surprise, but he says nothing to him. Sherlock relaxes at the light touch of John's hand that caresses his curls.
<< Yes it is >>.
<< Morgan has heard something. We must leave immediately! >> William says, looking at her with huge eyes. The girl is amazed. William is not an easily agitated child, accustomed as he is to his father's outbursts and that unhealthy family atmosphere. Sherlock Holmes' dog growls, then, looking at the door through which they have just passed.
Silence falls like a warm blanket over them. They look away from each other and return to each other several times, unable to say anything else. John eases the pressure on Sherlock's wrists and goes down to take his hands. He squeezes them tightly, feeling them cold.
<< You have been very good, little, really very good >> says, caressing Morgan's nose, dirty with Sharon's blood. The little dog crouches against him and closes his exhausted eyes.
<< Don't you think you're exaggerating? >> whispers John, elbowing him.
<< When I saw him on you I lost my head >> John admits and feels his hand tighten slightly. He grasps and Sherlock slowly raises his eyes to meet him. << Nobody can hurt you and hope to get away with it >>.
A strange atmosphere has arisen. John feels it on his skin, like a kind of warm and protective hug. As absurd as it may seem, it all seems to be born from the change of Mycroft, imperceptible to the naked eye but felt by the belly and skin.
<< I don't think so. You are even more involved than before >>.
<< Especially for him >> John underlines, glaring Martin with his eyes. << However, it would be better if you go to the hospital, Sherlock >> John says, turning to him a clinical and worried look.
<< We would have simulated a  pirates' attack. I was the captain and she was my quartermaster. Downstairs was the deck and my room was the captain's quarters. Mum would gone up the stairs screaming a magic word that would made me understand that I was in danger and I would had to shut myself in the closet and stay there until I heard the password >>.
<< Why are he wearing it, if he can't stand it? >>.
And show us, after this exile, Jesus, the son blessed fruit of your womb.
<< I'm happy to this >> John replies.
<< We will go out the kitchen door, skip the fence and reach my car, parked on the street near the mailbox, okay? >> Kelly whispers and the child, clinging to his reassuring arm, nods in terror.
<< Where did you find him? >> John asks, while Sherlock takes the phone from the boy's hand.
<< Little boy, the men of the scientific departmentare are looking for clues in the living room. I could not make you run around at your leisure >>.
<< Do you understand what he says? >> he asks.
<< A proof of the case of the victim of the Spa >> he says to the girl. << Can you verify that the organic traces correspond with those found on the victim? >>.
<< I ... I know that goes against all logic, which you will not fail to get me noticed, but I ... I know he is still alive >>.
<< For this reason I tell you that you was lucky. And you decided to turn your backto this luck . Pathetic >> Mycroft says disgusted. << Your children are lucky because they have a good father next to them. One of those fathers who continues to love them, who never doubts or gives up and who continues to struggle despite having no faults. The children for whom you says you are fighting and who, instead, you have put them in dangered them, by leaving them at the mercy of themselves, this children are lucky because they will overcome this bad moment, knowing that they can count on their father, although if he stay with them for few time >> Mycroft says, smiling at Greg, who blushes embarrassed by these heartfelt words, which everyone couldn't think could have come from someone like Mycroft.
<< Sherlock! Oh my God, you're waking up >> exclaims John euphoric, stroking his face with a trembling hand.
<< We wouldn't have bothered to come here if we hadn't already tried everything to force that damned portal >> says Sherlock, trying to make his brother understand how serious the situation is. Mycroft takes a look at him, then returns to look at Greg. John does not understand what can go for the genius mind of the older brother of his flatmate. If Sherlock seems incomprehensible to him, Mycroft is a real enigma for him.
<< I understand >> Mycroft says with his stretched smile. << Sherlock, on the other hand, wallows in excess. He exaggerates not to eat, even going to pass out in the worst cases. He exaggerates not to eat, even going to pass out in the worst cases. Exaggerate not to sleep until it completely collapses. I certainly don't have to tell you about all the times he was found deeply asleep in the most unusual places. I think you know exactly what I'm talking about >>.
<< What was the case, for example. The police station databases are all connected and I don't think it would be so difficult to access and verify them >>.
<< Most likely he won't even answer to this John. That's not how it works >>.
<< I didn't know you knew how to sew >>.
<< Come on, stay with me. I'll make you forget it >> she says mischievously, trying an extreme approach that John refuses, trying to keep the instinct at bay to push her away with a push.
<< Come on, I thought you understood. My friends weren't that much between the lines on Saturday >> says John, taking on the same absurdity and tone as Sherlock's obvious.
<< This stuff is freezing! >> Sherlock exclaims, trying to take the wrist from John's hands.
She doesn't have a lawyer, for example, nor did she obviously ask for it. The one assigned ex officio will only arrive in three days, God only knows why. On balance, anything could really happen to her amid the general indifference of those around her.
<< Sure, how could you? You are not able! >> blurts out by taking a step towards him, his fists clenched and his jaw clenched. Sherlock does not make a turn. His eyes remain steady in those of John, who feels mounting too explosive anger.
<< I ... I don't know. The news of their suicides surprised me too. The private seminar was held at Rosaline's home, who took advantage of the absence of her parents to make her home available. The Master was very kind to her and covered her with attentions ... too many attentions, in my opinion >>.
<< He does not realize the treasures he has >> sighs heartbroken Ulrika. << Ms Ford ran to her husband to show the sheet of paper. Usually an husband console his frightened wife and try to understand what happend to her. What's happen was an important thing! Someone entered the internal garden and broak a window with a stone! And another most important thing is that there was a sheet of paper attach to the stone. Instead, Mr Ford said to his wife that she was a crazy visionary. I didn't make it and I peeked >> admits the cook. << Too many times I refrained from running to the rescue of Ms Ford. I know that it's not fair, but I can't afford to end up like Amina >>.
<< Because I kept an eye on you, Lizzy! You promised me that you would go to the school psychologist, that you would ask help >> the brother shouts back, his voice broken by emotion.
<< I never thought, nor said that the truth should be hidden from children >> says Sherlock << Children know what is the truth and they recognize it even when adult idiots trying to hide it >> retorts putting the man back in line. Sherlock gently dry the child tears's wet face with his big hand. << Do you want to see how we will find who took your mom away from here last night? >> he asks. William nods.
<< About prostitution, you mean? >>.
<< If you know, why you want to give it win to him? >>.
<< You are one of them, aren't you? I lost my boots to pick up a godless gay >> growls, grabbing Sherlock's the neck. Sherlock puts his too weak hands on the big and strong one of the woman and tries in every way to free himself.
<< What is? A ski resort? >>.
<< I asked you to shut up >> John says following him at the counter, the puppy on his lap.
Sherlock loses his grip on Mary's hand, however. The arm falls inert on the mattress, producing a little reassuring thud. Sherlock surrenders to the only chance he has of getting out of there: being able to have a clear mind capable of reasoning in the absence of pain.
<< I guarantee for him, Mycroft >> says Sherlock frowning.
When Sherlock ended to told Mary, she start to told about her nightmares. Pieces of the past of a woman with whom Sherlock has discovered that he has many things in common. Mary's nightmares are bigger than his and Sherlock has struggled to listen to them. He wished he had the strength to get up and leave, but, despite Mary making him eat regularly and with less threats and punishment, now, Sherlock is prey to constant dizziness and a nausea that often prevents him from completing the stories. Fortunately, Mary now understands the situation and does not insist. In recent days, then, a constant headache has never left Sherlock and tiredness has dominated him. He is therefore forced to stay there, to listen to Mary's terrible stories, during which she always holds his left hand tight with her, huge and calloused. It is as if Mary wanted to keep Sherlock there, still in that reality made up of sleepiness and brief vigil, so as to make him difficult to understand what the dream is and what the reality is.
<< I don't want him here >>.
<< And in your logic a quarrel, in this case, follows an attempted violence? >> growls John and does not even know why he is getting angry like that.
<< WAKE UP! >>.
<< No, John >> retorts the man, showing him the smile drawn now more like a grimace of pain. << I relived in a time too many similar episodes that happened in the past >>.
<< As I said, you are too involved >>.
The 'dance' that usually takes them to bed has always been accompanied by Morgan's curious and embarrassing little eyes, in their first three months of love.
<< Well >> she replies. << Really, John, I'm fine. I met a really nice girl and ... well, it seems to be working. And you? >>.
<< Be good >> John whispers to the puppy that slips from the consultant's arms to run towards him.
John cast out Harriet's idiocy and he read the short text.
<< I need a shower >> he says standing up. Another dizziness makes him falter. John's strong hands grab him. Sherlock has to admit he's not feeling well
<< There doesn't seem to be a single cause >> she says, continuing to examine the bodies. << Some have a large number of fractures. I can't be more precise, Sherlock. They are many and many have been here for years. That, for example >> says, pointing to a pile of bones almost completely devoid of meat. << It seems to have been here for more than ten years >>.
<< I don't care about his power! >>.
<< What happens? >>.
November 16th
When John opens his eyes, the light of the day invades the room. His back hurts and his belly growls so hard like he swallowed something alive, that now screams invoking to be freed.
<< Yes. So there will be no problems. If will be possible, you will help me as you did today. Otherwise I'll somehow get by >>.
<< Hey, you like pirates: we can calling him Morgan >> John proposes. Sherlock think about the proposal.
<< Really? Mr. Holmes, I knew I made the right choice by calling you. Can I reassure the founding members that it was an accident? >>.
<< Bah, these women are really strange. I wonder what you find in them! >> Sherlock blurts out with a very equivocal and completely unusual flourish of his hand, which embarrasses the other three.
<< Why did you bring Sher ... Edward to the pit, Mary? >>.
<< Actually I'm putting on a chamomile tea >>.
<< He attacked me and Dr. Watson put him right >> Sherlock replies to his silent question.
<< Of course, but I am also an ex-soldier accustomed to the battlefield and action and Sherlock is not a simple detective, but a consulting detective >>.
<< Hey, are you all right? >>.
<< Do you think that the dog's death has anything to do with the kidnapping? >> John asks to Sherlock.
A snort diverts John from the answer he is about to give. The two men exchange a surprised look and then, on the second puff, they get closer to the consultant.
<< Are they dangerous? >> he asks, looking him in the eyes made even more beautiful by passion.
<< Finished is a rather big word, Dr. Watson >> replies Fox. << Let's say that we have reached an excellent turning point in the investigation. Once the brain of the organization is found, turning off the neurons one by one will be easier, but still exhausting. We have already blocked the cells that had been created in Spain, Germany, France and here in England. Gray, my boss, is still controlling the presence of similar suicides in other nations, and now that we put our hands on the mind of the portal, even this process will be faster. Always assuming that he wants to collaborate >>.
<< Of course I'm sure, Sherlock >> says between his teeth, trying to hold back the explosion. << How I'm sure you haven't dedicated the attention it deserves this investigation >>.
<< Why shouldn't we? >> Sherlock replies annoyed.
<< Do you know him? >> John asks incredulously.
John'a abdomen is contracted. What this Mary-child telling him in tears it is terrible. He turns his gaze to the guard, looking for support, but finds only a grim and disinterested look in that woman. The doctor realizes how serious the situation is. More serious than he imagined.
<< Those men. Did you hear what they said? >>.
<< Still in time to fix >> Sherlock says, his eyes closed again in the contemplation of The Beatles' 'Help!'.
They sit in their respective seats and the consultant doesn't seem to want to catch his breath. He diligently places his crutches on the armrest and continues to present his ideas to him. The case is quite simple even in John's eyes, but Sherlock is working on it with all of himself.
John only now realizes the deep affection and mutual respect that exists between the detective and the consultant. Although Sherlock constantly gives Greg an idiot, by never guessing his name, and Greg questions Sherlock's deductions, by screaming at him against the worst things, their balance is perfect.
The doctor just nods to the inspector, without giving too much weight to his words. John follows the track on the carpet, which from the stairs seems to divide in two directions: one door to the bathroom, the other to a closed door.
<< Eh ... your reputation? >> Sherlock asks him stroking his face.
<< Do yuo killed them for that reason, Mary? >>.
<< No, Sherlock. You did it. You used all your resources and you managed to save her from that asylum, to find a more human structure, to convince a jury of her innocence and the judge to give significant mitigations to her sentence. Saving her from herself, however, was such a big undertaking that it went beyond anyone's ability, perhaps even the best of specialists >>.
Sherlock had tried to get away from his body, while the hands of that woman, protected by latex gloves, washed him with no grace.
Hello Regina,
Sherlock told to Fox about the doctor in the e-mails that have been exchanging periodically since, years before, he collaborated with him and his colleagues in Madrid.
<< God, please stop it! >> John mutters, nodding an embarrassed smile to the two women.
<< I am not sure the jokes of homophobic troglodytes to worry me at the moment >> John says, finishing the medications. << So it should go. It is an emergency solution, however. Tomorrow in the hospital we will do better >> he says caressing Sherlock’s chin.
<< As you may have guessed, Fox is one of the investigative journalists who make up the editorial team of 'El mundo'. We worked together on several cases years ago and we kept in touch via e-mail, updating each other on our lives >> Sherlock says, looking up at him before returning it to the cup. << He contacted me with a message when we left the Jackson's house to tell me he was in London. Using the music code, Fox told me he was on an undercover mission for the investigation into cyber bullying they are working on and that led them to run into this portal >>.
<< Sherlock woke up shouting that he had to save you and that you needed his help. I learned, by working with him, that all the decisions he makes and the ideas that jump to his head make sense. If Sherlock said that you need his help, then he must have good reasons and I found out what these reasons are >>.
<< Not at all! >> Greg answers decisively. << Bring your sister back to your mother's house and do your homework >>.
Sherlock opens the envelope. He sits cross-legged on the bed and John imitates him.
<< Nothing, forget it >> John says, letting his hands slide along Sherlock's back, hot and wet with sweat .
<< If my presence here is not welcome, I can ... >>.
<< Because they discovered that you are the daughter of the best Scotland Yard's detective currently in charge >> Sherlock replies. Greg and Lizzy look at him in amazement.
<< The Fenix portal, a complex and well-organized system that has been operating for months in most of Europe and impossible to eradicate >> Sherlock whispers, his gaze lost in front of him. << I feared from the first moments that there was Moriarty behind that hellish circle. The constant failures of Sky always gave me confirmation >>.
<< Because when something circulates on the web it expands quickly and even if you weaken it, it creates emulators with impressive speed >> he says, calling his hand back to himself. John lets it go with regret and gets up immediately after him, following him to the living room desk.
<< The storm, you say? Yes. The wind has dropped and it already snows much less >>.
<< Hey, hey, stay calm! I didn't call you. The Spa manager wanted you here >>.
<< I just thought it would be better if he did not find out that you also lied about Molly >> John says, bringing to Sherlock's mind that detail that has so easily forgotten. << She is really happy to have saved you and imagines you now with Molly at your side, ready to get married. This happy ending was created by Mary and it would be bad to ruin it >>.
<< More than luxurious, I find it tacky >> retorts John, glancing at the bathroom with shiny blue walls and almost entirely occupied by a huge Jacuzzi. Then, remain motionless in front of the bedroom door.Sherlock takes a seat on the sofa in the sitting room and studies the flyer of the services offered by the Spa.
These devaluing thoughts have the right effect. John's 'little friend on the floor below' calms down and the bell that rings, breaking the silence, completes the return to work.
John didn't hold up. He went up to his room, put on the first clothes that came under his hand and went out on the cold Sunday morning of November. When he returned, Sherlock was not at home. John hasn't seen him since. The last things he has left of Sherlock are that sentence and his exit from the scene.
<< An attempted theft? >> asks Greg.
<< That you just need a glance to understand everything and that you are never wrong >>.
<< But no, he jokes >> Mary laughs amused. << My brothers love playing with me >>.
<< You saved my baby's life, Sherlock. I will be eternally grateful to you >>.
Oh very sweet
"No" He would like to say, but the face is so tense and the tongue so heavy.
<< Greg, listen ... Mycroft doesn't know. That is, surely he knows, but I have not confirmed what I said to you >>.
<< Hey, folks, a man from the government has arrived who says he's the brother of your missing friend >> says Hataway, breaking into the dining room of the small police station. Beyond the frosted glass, John glimpses the unmistakable silouette of Mycroft Holmes. John takes a deep breath and with Greg follows the inspector.
<< If you tell it, it will go >> Mary- child encourages him with a smile << I always do it >>. Sherlock looks at her for a long time. Mary untied her hair, which she usually holds tied in a tight bun, and now it falls around her face. In the twilight of the light of the snow that vibrates against the window, that rough face, which becomes mulled when the Mary-child moves the massive body, takes on tones that should be terrible but that Sherlock, now, finds to be even sweeter.
<< Oh, John, such defenseless creatures are able to bring out the best even from the most closed person >> says the lady caressing the puppy. << It is better that you take him for a walk, before I have to take a bucket and a broom. He still has some problems in understanding where he has to do pee pee >>.
John doesn't need to hear anything else. He runs outside without thinking twice. Hataway call him back, but he doesn't want to loose time. John sees the inspector and some of his men running towards him, who is already driving out of that hellish house.
<< Shut up! >> shouts Lizzy, reaching her mother with fury with big steps. << I won't let you use me to cover my father with misery! >> she pointing her with the finger and Margaret looks at her in amazement and bewildered by that heated and unexpected reaction.
<< Have a seat here, please >> says the guard, pointing to a door with the same number on his right. The doctor enters this room four by four with gray and bare walls. A square table is placed in the exact center with a very simple chair on each side.
>> Fox whispers, placing his forehead against Sherlock's. They exchange a smile before parting. << Doctor Watson, I honestly don't know yet whether to say it was a pleasure or not. I'll find out in case we have a chance to meet again. Meanwhile, I salute you and invite you to do something for your explosive anger >> Fox says, hinting at a military salute. He strode away, leaving them on the sidewalk in front of the Diogenes Club. Sherlock lights one of Greg's cigarettes and takes a long drag.
<< You are right. For this reason I will report it. As soon as I finish the criminal investigation and take that bastard I will make known what he did to me and I will try to convince the other victims to do the same. I would do the criminal a favor by being silent and I would fail in my mission: to ensure that justice is done >>.
Mycroft nods and loosens the scarf a little more, accompanying the gesture with two dry coughs.
John walks nervously back and forth in the Diogenes Club's waiting room. His steps are excellently muffled by the thick carpet and the clumsy sound they produce makes John even more nervous. They seem to take away the right importance from to the reason that prompted him to consult Mycroft Holmes.
